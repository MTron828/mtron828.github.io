Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

When it was 5 minutes from 10 am, several people who were going to cut the ribbon went up to the stage. There were six of them, namely Tang Haifeng, Tang Yunfan, Master Xu, Leng Shaoting, Gu Ning, and Tang Qingyang.

Afterwards, the host went on the stage to introduce the process of the news conference.

At 10 am, fireworks were let off. In the meantime, Gu Ning and the others cut the ribbon together.

Accompanied by the sound of exploding fireworks, the six of them pulled down the red cloth from the signboard: Shengning Organization.

The next second, Gu Ning took the microphone from the host and took a few steps forward.

At this moment, Gu Ning behaved maturely. She was very young, but didn’t look childish at all. On the contrary, she seemed much maturer and more powerful than her real age. She was like a ruler.

Gu Ning didn’t bother to hide her ambition today, because the guests present were either experienced businessmen or senior officials. They all had great confidence and pride in themselves, so Gu Ning had to be ambitious enough to be persuasive.

Everyone knew that Gu Ning was very successful now, but they were still amazed by her great ambition. Given her young age, her ambition was too great to be ignored.

“Today, I formally announce that the Shengning Organization is established,” said Gu Ning briefly with a clear voice filled with authority. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Once she finished, she received a big round of applause.

After that, Gu Ning gave a speech which was over within several minutes.

Chen Cangyi stood on the stage next.

After the announcement, people realized that Chen Cangyi was the executive president of the Shengning Organization while Gu Ning was only the boss behind the scenes. She wouldn’t appear unless it was necessary.

Chen Cangyi had some fame in the business world before becoming the executive president of the Shengning Organization because he was the student of a famous finance expert. He had also achieved a lot in the finance industry.

However, during the past year, Chen Cangyi was absent from the finance industry. Surprisingly, he was the executive president of the Shengning Organization now.

After Chen Cangyi finished his speech, he introduced several senior managers of the Shengning Organization to the guests, then Gu Ning invited them to dine at the Huangdeng Hotel.

Leng Shaoting didn’t go with them because over 40 minutes had already passed. The effect of the magical pill would be gone in a few minutes, so Baili Zongyang and Baili Zongxue would discover him if he stayed.

Leng Shaoting needed to leave, but he was afraid that Tang Haifeng and Tang Yunfan would be displeased, so he made up an excuse that he needed to deal with something else, and that he would go to see them again this afternoon.

Both Tang Haifeng and Tang Yunfan were very considerate. Since Leng Shaoting needed to deal with something else, they agreed to let him go first.

Not everyone went to dine with Gu Ning. Some of them left to deal with other things and secretaries who came on behalf of their leaders also left. The rest of the famous businessmen and senior officials went to have a meal with Gu Ning.

Because Tang Haifeng, Tang Yunfan, Master Xu, Jiang Zhongyu, Tang Qingyang and other important figures all went to have a meal, other people tried to spend more time with them. It would be best if they could leave an impression on those important figures.

It took a long time and much effort to build connections and most people were unwilling to miss this great chance.

Most famous businessmen and senior officials managed to form a relationship with Tang Yunfan, Tang Qingyang, Xu Jinlin and other important figures by exchanging each other’s name card. It was the first step to success.

…

After Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye went into the private room of the clubhouse, the atmosphere inside immediately became intense.

Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye felt nothing, but the people by their sides felt quite uncomfortable.

“I heard the Qing Gang has a lot of trouble these days. Situ, aren’t you afraid it’ll be totally changed after you go back?” said Qi Tianlin. He didn’t care about Situ Ye at all, he simply wanted to annoy him.

The Kirin Gang and the Qing Gang always stayed in their own lanes, but they saw each other as enemies and paid special attention to one another all the time, so Qi Tianlin knew what had happened to the Qing Gang recently.

Situ Ye did the same thing, so he wasn’t annoyed by Qi Tianlin’s question. He only relied in a flat voice, “Just some contemptible wretches. The problem has already been solved. Thank you for asking.”

He knew that Qi Tianlin aimed to make fun of him, but he stayed polite on the surface.

His gang indeed had some trouble, but those contemptible wretches weren’t a serious problem. It took him some time to solve it, but it didn’t cause serious damage.

“Humph!” Qi Tianlin snorted. He couldn’t care less about Situ Ye.

However, although he thought that, he wouldn’t say it aloud.

“Well, I also have heard that something terrible has happened in your domain, Qi,” said Situ Ye. He was unwilling to be laughed at by Qi Tianlin.

“They’re merely nobodies. I didn’t need to deal with it in person. My subordinates could easily solve the problem,” said Qi Tianlin arrogantly.

Actually, it wasn’t as easy as he described, otherwise his subordinates wouldn’t have been injured one after another. However, he had to keep his dignity before Situ Ye, so he naturally wouldn’t tell the truth.

Situ Ye was clearly aware of it, but he didn’t bother to embarrass Qi Tianlin because it wasn’t necessary to make every detail public. It was better to stop after making fun of each other for a while.

“Qi, I bet you must have found out that the trouble we’ve encountered these days was caused by an outside force, right?” asked Situ Ye. Although he asked that question, he knew the answer was affirmative. He simply said that in order to talk about the next topic with Qi Tianlin.

“Of course, I’m not dumb! I could easily figure it out. If I believed it was done by the Qing Gang, I would have already paid you back. We wouldn’t be nicely talking to each other right now,” said Qi Tianlin in annoyance. He knew Situ Ye didn’t mean that, but he was still displeased.

“I know, I just want to make sure whether you’re willing to talk about that with me,” said Situ Ye.

“Great, let’s talk,” said Qi Tianlin. In fact, he had the same idea.

“Qi, do you know what force it is and who’s behind it?” asked Situ Ye.

“No idea. Do you know, Situ?” asked Qi Tianlin.

“I have no idea either, so I planned to talk with you about that,” said Situ Ye. He wasn’t surprised that Qi Tianlin knew nothing about it.. If Qi Tianlin had any clues, Qi Tianlin would have taken action early on instead of waiting to talk with him about that right now.
