Chapter 1521: Let It Go

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Well, if you’re unwilling to accept my help, I won’t force you to do so, but you shouldn’t exist at all so you must be destroyed,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, the male ghost got angrier and shouted, “You don’t have the power to destroy me!” She wasn’t Yanluo Wang after all, and she couldn’t make the decision to destroy a ghost’s existence.

The male ghost understood that it shouldn’t exist in a mortals’ world, but it was reluctant to leave.

“You’re a ghost, and you shouldn’t be here. Don’t you know that?” Gu Ning asked.

“It’s not my fault. You mortals ruined my place first!” The male ghost was full of anger, because its grave was totally destroyed.

“I know that they destroyed your grave, so you’re mad at them, which is the reason why I’m willing to let you choose. It’s not my fault either, so you should calm down,” Gu Ning said.

Although she mainly came here to destroy this male ghost because she wanted this land, she wouldn’t sit on her hands once she learned its existence. It was a ghost, and it shouldn’t be here, so she had to completely destroy it.

“In addition, why do you want to stay here? You can’t do anything nor go anywhere. Hundreds of years have passed, so you should let your obsession go,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, the male ghost looked sad. It knew that it couldn’t do anything here and it wouldn’t end up in anything even if it was unwilling to give up its obsession. However, it was quite difficult for it to do that.

At the same time, it was also aware that Gu Ning was determined to destroy it. Therefore, it still had to face her.

“I’ll tell you my story if you can beat me. How about it?” asked the male ghost, sounding as if it was very tolerant and was willing to give Gu Ning a chance.

Gu Ning was amused when she heard it. This male ghost was too confident. It thought that Gu Ning would waste time fighting against it and listening to its story afterwards. It sounded boring and Gu Ning had no interest in its story.

In fact, if the male ghost could give up its obsession and successfully go to the next incarnation, it could have another life. On the contrary, if Gu Ning directly destroyed it, it wouldn’t exist anymore.

Ghosts were unwilling to be totally destroyed, because they had hope to go into the next incarnation.

“No need, you’ll know my ability after I touch you...” Saying that, Gu Ning abruptly rushed ahead and caught the male ghost.

Because Gu Ning moved too fast and the male ghost didn’t expect that she would suddenly do that, it was caught by Gu Ning the next second, then disappeared. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Gu Ning put it into her telepathic eye space, and wanted to let it out after she walked out of this grave pit.

However, right after Gu Ning walked out of the grave pit, she saw someone jump in from outside of the fence.

He moved lightly, and nobody would notice him if Gu Ning didn’t see him by accident.

When Gu Ning was about to tell Gao Yi and Qiao Ya to avoid the man, she smelt the air of a cultivator.

The man should be a cultivator!

Gu Ning was surprised and focused on his face, then found out that he was the middle-aged cultivator she saw when she had a car accident at the airport in City B last time.

In that case, the man must have seen them too, so Gu Ning gave up the idea of avoiding him.

The man, however, felt strange because he came inside for the Yin, but the Yin was somehow gone after he got inside. He only saw three mortals ahead of him now.

He thought that they might have something to do with the disappearance of the Yin, but he was unwilling to believe it. They were merely mortals, and mortals normally couldn’t sense the Yin.

He thought that the Yin probably escaped once it sensed his existence.

The man had that idea, not because he was a narcissist, but because ghosts and monsters could indeed sense the air of a cultivator.

Cultivators were the enemies of ghosts and monsters, so they fought against each other whenever they encountered one another.

Normally, cultivators were stronger than ghosts and monsters, so ghosts and monsters tended to avoid cultivators. If the ghost was able to sense his air from a distance, it couldn’t be a low level ghost.

Gu Ning walked back to Gao Yi and Qiao Ya and told them that someone was coming.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya were surprised, because they didn’t notice it out at all.
