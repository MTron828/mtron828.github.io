“It’s fine. I believe they’ll win,” said Shangguan Yang airily. It seemed that he had great confidence in Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

When Shangguan Yang said that, no one thought he was bragging, because Qing Feng was obviously strong. Even if Qing Feng couldn’t become the number 1, it wasn’t difficult for him to be in the top 5.

As for Qing He, they could also see her excellent martial arts although her cultivation level wasn’t high. With Qing Feng’s help, it was easy for her to get into the top 10.

Mo Qilin could join the top 10 as well if Qing Feng and Qing He were able to help him.

At this time, Baili Zongxue was at the Fusion Stage, so many people attacked her too.

Nobody cared about status here, and there would only be losers and winners, so those who attacked Baili Zongxue weren’t afraid of her family background.

Besides, the four major families were always competing against each other secretly. In order to stop the other families from getting into the second part of the game, they were making things difficult for each other.

Baili Zongxue had teammates, but they were being attacked as well, so they might not be able to help her.

As a result, when Baili Zongxue ran to the third martial arts platform, a cultivator at a high level hit her with magical energy. Baili Zongxue was accurately hit, then fell from the stage the next second.

Seeing that, her teammates rushed to rescue her at once, but it was too late.

Seeing that, the Baili family’s members all frowned at their seats. It wasn’t something they wanted to see, but they stayed calm. After all, they didn’t have high expectations for Baili Zongxue. They let her join in the game only to experience it. Unfortunately she didn’t make it to the second part when the real game began.

However, right when everyone believed that Baili Zongxue was going to fall from the stage, Gu Ning moved and flashed to its edge. In the last second, she caught Baili Zongxue’s hand.

That scene shocked many people. Unexpectedly, she ran to rescue Baili Zongxue. Even Baili Zongxue couldn’t believe it.

When Gu Ning ran to rescue Baili Zongxue, some admired her, some were annoyed, and some mocked her.

People who admired Gu Ning weren’t selfish. They might not help their competitors, but they wouldn’t disdain those who did. People who were annoyed obviously wanted to see Baili Zongxue lose. And people who mocked Gu Ning felt her action was hard to understand because Baili Zongxue wasn’t her teammate. It was a competition after all and kindness wasn’t encouraged. The person you rescued might return kindness with ingratitude!

Baili Zongxue wouldn’t do that, but someone seized the chance to attack her when Gu Ning went to pull her back.

Many people criticized the person for his shameless behavior, but he didn’t break the rules, so it was allowed. However, right when the person was about to succeed, Gu Ning pulled Baili Zongxue back. Without delay, she turned to attack the person with strong magical energy combined with the magical power of Blood of the Phoenix. As a result, the person was hit off the stage and fell into the pool.

Many people were amazed by that scene. To their surprise, a cultivator at the Fusion Stage was able to release such powerful magical energy and beat a cultivator in the primary stage of the Heartbeat Stage off the stage.

The cultivator who was beaten from the stage by Gu Ning was in the primary stage of the Heartbeat Stage, or she wouldn’t have to use the magical power of the Blood of the Phoenix to enhance the force.

Although there was only a level gap between the Fusion Stage and the Heartbeat Stage, it made a great difference.

Seeing Baili Zongxue rescued, the Baili family were relieved. They didn’t expect her to win a prize, but it was a good thing if she could get into the second part of the game.

“Thanks,” Baili Zongxue said to Gu Ning.

“You’re welcome.” Gu Ning didn’t care much about that. She came to help only because it was Baili Zongxue.

In front of the hall.

“Senior Shangguan, I should thank you for your disciple’s help to my granddaughter.” Baili Qifeng thanked Shangguan Yang. Although he should do that to Gu Ning, he couldn’t talk to Gu Ning at this moment. Anyway, he knew that Baili Zongxue would thank Gu Ning by herself. Baili Zongxue was his granddaughter after all, so he must say something to show his attitude.

“It’s just a little favor, Patriarch Baili,” said Shangguan Yang airily. He didn’t think it was a big deal because he was aware of Gu Ning’s relationship with Baili Zongxue. If it was a stranger, Gu Ning wouldn’t help.

“Shangguan, is your female disciple really a cultivator in the Fusion Stage?” Shi Xiaoyang asked curiously.

“Yes!” Shangguan Yang smoothed his beard and said with pride, “She isn’t at a very high level, but her abilities are very outstanding. She has great explosive force. She isn’t worse than a cultivator in the Heartbeat Stage.”

Shangguan Yang didn’t mind telling them something about Gu Ning, but he wouldn’t tell them everything about her. In fact, even cultivators in the Golden Core Stage might not be able to defeat Gu Ning because she had the Blood of the Phoenix which could enhance the impact of magical energy several times than before, let alone cultivators in the Heartbeat Stage.

Knowing that, the other people were surprised again. It was very rare that a cultivator in the Fusion Stage was able to defeat a cultivator in the Heartbeat Stage.

None of them doubted that because they could see the girl was indeed much stronger than cultivators in the Fusion Stage. She was also able to release powerful magical energy and easily knock away a cultivator in the Heartbeat Stage.

The fight continued. After rescuing Baili Zongxue, Gu Ning kept on helping her clear her way ahead once in a while. Mo Qilin had Leng Shaoting’s help, so they soon reached the end and got number cards. Therefore, they could rest for a while now.

When the sixty number cards were all taken, there were over a dozen people who failed to get one standing on the martial arts platform, as a result, they had to grab one from other people.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting protected Mo Qilin and Baili Zongxue behind them. Baili Zongxue was also protected by her teammates, so those cultivators who planned to grab their number cards had to give it up.

Because Leng Shaoting was at a high level and Gu Ning was stronger than she seemed to be, they avoided them and turned to attack cultivators at a lower level.

Some of them succeeded, but some failed again and were knocked off the martial arts platform.

As soon as those cultivators without a number card were all knocked off, the first part of the game was over.
