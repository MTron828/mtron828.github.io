Chapter 2685: Something Is Wrong

??

Gu Ning saw it and Leng Shaoting also noticed. They exchanged a glance with a serious expression.

“Let me go!” said Gu Ning. Since she noticed that Wei Lingfeng was in trouble, she must do something.

“Leave it to me!” said Leng Shaoting. He wasn’t worried about Gu Ning’s abilities at all, but he didn’t want to burden Gu Ning.

“It’s fine. It’s Grandpa Leng’s birthday party. As the eldest grandson, you shouldn’t be absent. Just let me deal with it. It shouldn’t be difficult,” said Gu Ning. Most importantly, it was easy for her to solve the problem by herself.

“Well, you must be careful. Call me if you need help.” Leng Shaoting was persuaded by Gu Ning, but still reminded her to be careful.

Even though he believed Gu Ning would be fine, he still needed to remind her to be careful.

“I know. No need to worry about me.” Gu Ning nodded, then followed Wei Lingfeng out.

Because it was still early, the other guests didn’t leave and there was no one outside except for Wei Lingfeng’s bodyguards.

After Gu Ning walked out, she called Wei Lingfeng, “President Wei, wait a second.”

Hearing her voice, Wei Lingfeng stopped. He turned around and smiled at Gu Ning kindly. “What can I do for you, Miss Gu?”

“Mr. President, can we talk privately?” There were two bodyguards next to Wei Lingfeng, but Gu Ning couldn’t let them hear their conversation, so she needed him to walk to the side with her.

...

“Sure.” Wei Lingfeng agreed. Then he told his two bodyguards to wait for him, and he walked to the side with Gu Ning.

When there was no one around them, Gu Ning said in a low voice, “Mr. President, I just saw your blackened forehead. I’m worried that you might encounter some trouble on your way back home. If you don’t mind, I can send you back. I’ll leave after I make sure you’re safe.”

Although the two bodyguards by Wei Lingfeng’s side were top level and could defeat professional killers, Gu Ning was afraid that Wei Lingfeng might encounter strange creatures that weren’t human.

Wei Lingfeng was surprised. However, because he knew Gu Ning had superpowers, he didn’t doubt her words.

“Of course, thank you so much, Miss Gu,” said Wei Lingfeng. He didn’t think Gu Ning would harm him.

After that, Gu Ning followed Wei Lingfeng and got in his car.

There were five seats in Wei Lingfeng’s car. He came with three people, including two bodyguards and a chauffeur.

Even though it was a chauffeur, he was no weaker than the two bodyguards. And he was extremely good at driving. He was as good as a racecar driver.

Gu Ning sat at the back with Wei Lingfeng. Wei Lingfeng sat in the middle, while Gu Ning and a bodyguard sat next to him.

Wei Lingfeng’s bodyguards didn’t know why Gu Ning would go with Wei Lingfeng, but they didn’t ask. Wei Lingfeng had to be doing it for a reason.

There was a long distance between the Leng family’s house and Zhonghai Garden, because one was in a suburb, while the other was in the city.

Once they were out of the Leng family’s house, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to observe the surroundings. Wei Lingfeng also stayed alert.

Even though he knew he wouldn’t be hurt with Gu Ning’s protection, he couldn’t relax and leave everything to her.

From the Leng family’s house to the urban area, there was a large piece of wild land without any buildings.

Right when they reached this part of the road, Gu Ning sensed two evil people who should be targeting Wei Lingfeng.

However, they weren’t evil cultivators, nor monsters or ghosts, instead they were ninjas.

Ninjas weren’t as aggressive as evil cultivators, monsters, or ghosts. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Gu Ning immediately turned to look at the two ninjas. She saw two men in black clothes and black masks were squatting in the grass not far from them, looking in their direction. It seemed that they would jump out as soon as Wei Lingfeng’s car approached.

“Please tell the chauffeur to stop,” Gu Ning said to Wei Lingfeng. Gu Ning didn’t directly ask the chauffeur to stop, but asked Wei Lingfeng to do it. Because of Wei Lingfeng’s special status, if she directly asked the chauffeur to stop, the chauffeur wouldn’t listen. He only obeyed Wei Lingfeng’s orders.

“Stop the car.” Wei Lingfeng ordered the chauffeur at once, then he turned to ask Gu Ning, “What did you find?”

“I noticed something wrong. Just stay in the car. Don’t get out,” said Gu Ning.

“Sure.” Wei Lingfeng replied. Then the chauffeur unlocked the car door and Gu Ning got out at once.

This time, the chauffeur didn’t ask for Wei Lingfeng’s opinions, because Wei Lingfeng already agreed to let Gu Ning handle it.

He needed to be smart to work for Wei Lingfeng. He should know what to ask and what he shouldn’t ask about.

However, after hearing Wei Lingfeng’s conversation with Gu Ning, they knew that something bad might be happening, so they paid a lot of attention to their surroundings.

After Gu Ning left, the bodyguard sitting by Wei Lingfeng’s side asked, “President Wei, what’s going on?”

Although they shouldn’t ask about everything, sometimes, it was necessary for them to know the situation.

For example, they seemed to be in a dangerous situation, but they had sensed nothing.

They weren’t doubting Gu Ning. After all, Wei Lingfeng trusted her very much, if they doubted Gu Ning, it meant they didn’t believe Wei Lingfeng.

“I don’t know what it is either. We just need to observe it for a while,” said Wei Lingfeng. He trusted Gu Ning and there had to be something wrong, but it hadn’t happened yet, so he had no idea.

Hearing that, the bodyguard stopped asking. Anyway, the incident happened a few seconds later.

Although Wei Lingfeng’s car was parked at a distance of about twenty meters from the squatting ninjas, they had already recognized that it was Wei Lingfeng’s car. They didn’t know why Wei Lingfeng’s car stopped suddenly, but they didn’t think Wei Lingfeng noticed them. Even if he did, it wouldn’t affect their actions.

Instead, since Wei Lingfeng’s car stopped, it was more convenient for them to take action.

As a result, right after Wei Lingfeng’s car stopped, the two ninjas appeared. In the blink of an eye, two people flashed to the front of Wei Lingfeng’s car.
