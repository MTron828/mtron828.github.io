Chapter 2109: I Swear I Won’t Tell Anyone

It was 10 pm at this moment, so there wasn’t much traffic on the road and they arrived at the Military General Hospital within twenty minutes.

After that, they went to the room of Song Haoyu’s teammates.

There was another teammate in the room to guard them. Once Leng Shaoting and the others came, they told unnecessary people to go out. Only Song Haoyu, Leng Shaoting, and Gu Ning were left inside.

Afterwards, Leng Shaoting took out a porcelain bottle with ten power crystals in it and handed it to Song Haoyu. “This medicine is very effective. Help each of them take one first. Their wounds will heal soon. Within three days, if 70% hasn’t healed yet, take another one. They should make a full recovery in a week.”

“This medicine is really effective for nearly all injuries and diseases, but they’re very rare too. Don’t use it when you’re only slightly injured and ill. Use it only when you can’t tolerate the pain, or you can ask me about it.”

In order to remove Song Haoyu’s doubt, Gu Ning gave Leng Shaoting the power crystals before they walked inside. She let Leng Shaoting do the job because Song Haoyu would prefer to trust him given their relationship.

“What? They can recover a lot in only three days after taking this medicine?” Song Haoyu was stunned by Leng Shaoting’s words. He could barely believe his ears, but he was sure that he heard it right.

Song Haoyu’s two injured teammates were also amazed. However, is this medicine really so effective?

Song Haoyu understood that Leng Shaoting wouldn’t fool him, and Song Haoyu’s two teammates also trusted Leng Shaoting, but they thought the effect of this medicine was too good to be true. It was indeed very hard for them to believe it.

“Since you believe in people with magical skills, why can’t you believe in this effective medicine? Don’t worry, I won’t harm them. My teammates also use this medicine to recover when they’re injured,” said Leng Shaoting.

“I trust you, I simply feel it’s too unbelievable.” Since Leng Shaoting was very honest with them, Song Haoyu wouldn’t doubt it again. He turned to ask his two injured teammates, “How about you?”

“We’re willing to trust Major General Leng,” Song Haoyu’s two teammates said.

They couldn’t wait to heal within a week. They were soldiers and carried many responsibilities on their shoulders, so they didn’t want to lie in bed for months, it would make them think they were useless. They needed to recover as soon as possible and catch the criminals.

“Great!” Song Haoyu agreed, then took out two power crystals to give each of them a pill.

After taking the power crystal, they felt a touch of coldness spreading through their bodies, which was quite comfortable.

Within minutes, their bodies became less painful.

Although they were still in pain because they were seriously injured, they could feel that they were recovering, which amazed them.

“Wow…” Both of them were too surprised to say a complete sentence.

“Is everything alright?” Song Haoyu trusted Leng Shaoting, but he still got nervous when he saw his teammates’ reactions.

“They’re fine. They’re simply amazed by the effect of the medicine. Do you feel better now?” said Gu Ning.

“Yeah!” The two teammates replied at once, showing great excitement.

“Really?” Hearing that, Song Haoyu was shocked. He trusted Leng Shaoting, but was still amazed when he heard their answer with his own ears.

This medicine was really effective!

At this moment, Song Haoyu had no doubt at all. Although it was just the beginning and it would take time to see whether the medicine was really effective, it was enough to prove its effect when the pain was greatly released after they took it.

“Shaoting, where did you get this unbelievably effective medicine?” Song Haoyu asked Leng Shaoting excitedly. If he could carry this effective medicine with him, he wouldn’t be afraid of being injured in their future tasks.

Although they were ready to die at any time after they joined the army, no one was willing to die if they could survive.

“Don’t tell anyone else if I tell you,” said Leng Shaoting, staring straight at him.

“Sure, I promise I won’t tell anyone.” Song Haoyu immediately swore. In case Leng Shaoting didn’t believe him, he even raised his hand.

Seeing that, Gu Ning almost laughed out loud. Song Haoyu’s two teammates were also amused.

Song Haoyu normally was very serious, but he was like a kid right now, which was rare to see!

“I met a person with magical skills when I carried out a task. He gave the medicines to me. I bought some from him in case I get injured again in future tasks. This medicine is very rare, so it’s quite expensive. He’s only willing to sell ten pills to me each month,” said Leng Shaoting. That was the explanation Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning agreed on in their car, because they knew that Song Haoyu would certainly ask for the source of the medicine.

Leng Shaoting had the plan to prepare some power crystals forSong Haoyu, but he couldn’t give the pills to him for free every time. Obviously, they needed the medicine for a long time, so it wasn’t realistic if it was free. After all, it was Gu Ning’s stuff, not Leng Shaoting’s, so he needed to make an excuse for the convenience of their deal.

In the military, except for members of the Red Flame, Leng Shaoting had the closest relationship with Song Haoyu, so he cared a lot about Song Haoyu’s safety. He always had the idea of giving them some power crystals.

“You know a person with magical skills?” Knowing that, Song Haoyu and the others were surprised.

“Yeah, I met them not too long ago,” said Leng Shaoting.

“What kind of person with magical skills is he?” asked Song Haoyu. There were many kinds of people with magical skills. As long as they had abilities ordinary people didn’t have, they were called people with magical skills.

“I don’t know, but I’m sure he’s very skilled in medicines,” said Leng Shaoting.

“How much is this pill? Can you help me buy some?” asked Song Haoyu. He looked at Leng Shaoting with great anticipation, hoping that Leng Shaoting wouldn’t turn him down.

“Sure, but it cost a hundred thousand yuan a pill,” said Leng Shaoting. It was actually a very low price for friends, because Gu Ning sold the medicine to Qi Tianlin for a million yuan a pill. Even Situ Ye needed to pay five hundred thousand yuan for each pill.

Most importantly, Song Haoyu and the others didn’t lack money. If they didn’t have much money, the price would be much lower.

Gu Ning had even given medicine to the poor for free!
