3270 I Hope We’re Still Friends

Although Mrs. Chu said nothing about Chu Jianan and Jiang Yihan, she attached no importance to Jiang Yihan. Therefore, she didn’t care that Chu Jianan was still playing around. However, if Jiang Yihan wanted to marry Chu Jianan, she would stop it from happening. She would never allow a girl like Jiang Yihan to marry into the Chu family.

Mrs. Chu disdained Jiang Yihan because Jiang Yihan betrayed Leng Yuqi for Chu Jianan. If the news spread, the Chu family would be humiliated.

Although Leng Yuqi did the same thing before, Chu Jianan hadn’t ended his engagement with Leng Xiaoyao yet. Mrs. Chu would ask Chu Jianan to marry Leng Yuqi rather than Leng Xiaoyao.

Because of that, Mrs. Chu forgave Leng Yuqi’s behavior. After all, it was better than marrying a rich, arrogant, and ugly girl like Leng Xiaoyao.

However, the situation was different. Chu Jianan had ended his engagement with Leng Xiaoyao. He had the right to make the best choice.

!!

If so, why couldn’t they compare Jiang Yihan with other girls?

Jiang Yihan’s family was also rich and wasn’t much lower than the Leng family, but Mrs. Chu wanted a better daughter-in-law than Jiang Yihan.

If Jiang Yihan was born in a first-rate or second-rate rich family, Mrs. Chu wouldn’t care about her behavior at all. Instead, Mrs. Chu wished that a daughter from a first-rate or second-rate rich family could steal Chu Jianan!

Back in her room.

Chu Jiayu thought about it for a while. Then, she still called Jiang Yihan. She wanted to ask Jiang Yihan why she did it.

Now she couldn’t be friends with Leng Yuqi any longer and wouldn’t take Jiang Yihan as her friend either.

Seeing Chu Jiayu’s call, Jiang Yihan was too guilty to answer it. She knew that Chu Jiayu must have heard about her affair with Chu Jianan.

However, even if she refused to answer it today, Chu Jiayu could ask her about it in front of other classmates tomorrow. By then, everyone would know and it would be even more humiliating.

After thinking for a while, Jiang Yihan answered the phone as Chu Jiayu was about to stop.

“Hi, Jiayu, is something up? Why are you calling me so late?” Jiang Yihan asked in a panic.

“Why did you betray Yuqi and secretly get together with Jianan?” Chu Jiayu directly questioned. She sounded displeased, but she wasn’t actually that mad.

Jiang Yihan wasn’t surprised.

Since she decided to answer Chu Jiayu’s call, she knew how to face it.

“I know that I hurt Yuqi because of my affair with Jianan, but I didn’t do it on purpose. I went to a club with my friends one day. I didn’t expect Jianan to be friends with my friend’s older brother. We met by chance and we were both drunk. Jianan sent me to a hotel and we did it. I know we shouldn’t have done that, but we could barely remember what we did that night. If I had been clear-headed, I wouldn’t have done it,” Jiang Yihan said, sounding pitiful and as if she was a victim too.

“Are you still having an affair with Jianan?” asked Chu Jiayu.

“Yes,” said Jiang Yihan.

“You said it was an accident, why did you continue to be with Jianan?” asked Chu Jiayu.

In the past, she didn’t dare to do that. However, after their secret relationship was exposed, Chu Jianan didn’t care about Leng Yuqi’s feelings. Because of that, she dared to pin the blame on Chu Jianan. Anyway, Chu Jianan only cared about her right now. He shouldn’t be mad at her for that.

“Jianan lost interest in Yuqi? How is that possible?” Chu Jiayu didn’t think it was possible. After all, Chu Jianan liked Leng Yuqi so much before. It was impossible that he suddenly changed.

“If Jianan really loved Yuai, he wouldn’t agree to have an affair with me. Jiayu, I know you can’t accept it, but it’s the truth. I don’t want our relationship to be affected. I hope we can still be friends,” said Jiang Yihan. She honestly didn’t want to lose a friend like Chu Jiayu. After all, Chu Jiayu was a member of the Chu family, so she hoped that she could be closer to Chu Jiayu.

“How about Yuqi?” asked Chu Jiayu.

Jiang Yihan was struck dumb for a second, and became a little mad. She felt that Chu Jiayu was defending Leng Yuqi and didn’t take her as a friend.

If Chu Jiayu really regarded her as a friend, shouldn’t Chu Jiayu feel happy for her after hearing the news? VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Nevertheless, Jiang Yihan didn’t say that aloud. Instead, she acted guilty and said, “I know I hurt Yuqi. I want to be friends with her, but I don’t think she’ll forgive me.”

Chu Jiayu didn’t know what to say. She didn’t have moral standards either, so she didn’t think that Jiang Yihan’s words were wrong. She just couldn’t accept it right away.

“So be it!” Chu Jiayu didn’t know what to say, so she said nothing and hung up on Jiang Yihan.

Jiang Yihan felt guilty at the beginning, but she relaxed after having the call with Chu Jiayu.

No matter how Chu Jiayu thought of her, Chu Jiayu couldn’t be friends with Leng Yuqi any longer. Therefore, she didn’t think that Chu Jiayu would be dumb enough to side with Leng Yuqi.

She was only afraid that Leng Yuqi would spread the news because she would be humiliated.

Therefore, she hoped that Leng Yuqi would keep it among them.

However, what Jiang Yihan didn’t know was that Mrs. Chu hated her for stealing Chu Jianan.

If their relationship wasn’t serious, Mrs. Chu wouldn’t say anything about it. Unfortunately, if she wanted to marry Chu Jianan, Mrs. Chu would definitely prevent it from happening.

Therefore, Jiang Yihan was doomed to suffer a double loss.

…

Chu Jianan’s entire body hurt, so he could hardly sleep for a whole night. After a day, he became very haggard, which filled his parents with anxiety. However, they could do nothing about it.

What was worse, they failed to find the criminal.

Although they guessed that it might have something to do with Mo Jinlin or the Leng family, they had no evidence.

Chu Jianan, however, was suspicious of Leng Xiaoyao, because only she had the ability to injure him like that among his enemies.

Unfortunately, no matter how suspicious he was of her, he didn’t have any evidence.

…

Shi Yuran was found in the park by passers-by an hour later. They called the police at once and Shi Yuran was sent to the hospital afterwards. The Shi family was informed of the bad news.

Shi Yuran’s parents were scared upon hearing that their daughter was seriously injured. They immediately asked the police to find the criminals.

They were determined to get revenge.
