3381 Did We Bully You?

They also found He Xuejiao’s behavior despicable. Although they thought it was understandable for her to break off the engagement in that situation, she shouldn’t have tried to get back together with him once he was better!

They had advised her not to rush into breaking off the engagement and to wait for Zou Shuo to receive treatment. After all, medical technology was so advanced nowadays.

Other than because of her family background and good appearance, He Xuejiao didn’t deserve Zou Shuo. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

They were very close with He Xuejiao, so they knew that during that time, she had a boyfriend! She only broke up with him after she found out that Zou Shuo’s leg had healed.

…

Leng Xiaoyao bought several sets of clothes, pajamas, and shoes.

“Wow! A woman’s shopping ability is really strong.” Mu Beihan couldn’t help exclaim.

“That’s why women’s money is the easiest to earn.” Leng Xiaoyao laughed.

Women always had more clothes than men, in various styles and colors.

Men’s clothes, on the other hand, were usually just a few monotonous colors and styles.

Men were much more casual in their choice of clothes.

After they returned to Hanlin Manor, Mu Beihan asked Leng Xiaoyao in surprise, “Leng Xiaoyao, aren’t you afraid of living alone in such a big house? If it were me, I would be scared. Seeing the emptiness here and the darkness over there, my mind would conjure up many scary scenes.”

“What is there to be afraid of? Even if there are ghosts, I’m not afraid,” Leng Xiaoyao said, but Mu Beihan thought that there were no ghosts in this world!

Nevertheless, Mu Beihan admired Leng Xiaoyao’s fearlessness.

After resting for a while, Mu Beihan pulled Leng Xiaoyao up to spar with her.

“Do you need me to use my abilities to fight on your level or do you want me to use my abilities directly?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“I feel like you’re looking down on me.” Mu Beihan was slightly upset and felt a bit discouraged. “Fine! I know I can’t defeat you, but don’t fight on my level. Just don’t hit me too hard…”

Mu Beihan was still afraid of being accidentally injured by Leng Xiaoyao, so she didn’t want her to fully use her abilities.

“Okay.” Leng Xiaoyao found it funny, but no matter what, she wouldn’t hurt Mu Beihan.

The two of them started fighting in the yard. Mu Beihan used all her skills, but Leng Xiaoyao only used 50% strength and still suppressed Mu Beihan completely. Although she didn’t leave her with no room for resistance, it was still quite challenging.

This challenge made Mu Beihan excited. The more she was suppressed, the more courageous she became, and she could resist for a while.

Overall, Mu Beihan’s skills were still at a high level. She could handle about ten thugs at a time and had the ability to protect herself.

“I’m tired… let’s stop.” Mu Beihan was about to collapse from exhaustion so she surrendered. However, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t look tired at all.

“You’re too amazing. You’re not even tired,” Mu Beihan said enviously.

Later on, Leng Xiaoyao taught Mu Beihan some moves, and Mu Beihan learned them happily.

Leng Xiaoyao returned home after having dinner at around 6 pm.

Mu Beihan didn’t want to go home, but her strict upbringing didn’t allow her to stay out overnight casually.

That night, Li Mochen didn’t come back. It wasn’t until the next day when Leng Xiaoyao went out for a morning run that she saw Li Mochen standing outside the door.

Seeing him, Leng Xiaoyao smiled. “When did you come back?”

“Midnight,” Li Mochen said with a faint smile and tender eyes.

“If there’s something important these days, let’s not cultivate. We can wait until we have time,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Cultivation was important, but so was dealing with important matters.

“It’s done for now. There’s nothing important. We can go,” Li Mochen said. He was someone who knew how to prioritize things. If there were really important matters that he couldn’t let go of, he would handle them first.

In that case, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t say anything else.

When the two of them were running in the morning, they ran into Jiang Xiaoxiao again.

Jiang Xiaoxiao didn’t usually go for morning runs, but she woke up early just to see Li Mochen.

Upon seeing Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen, she ran over to them with a polite smile and greeted them. “Hi, Leng Xiaoyao.”

Because she didn’t know Li Mochen’s name, she just nodded and smiled at him.

However, Li Mochen didn’t even give her a glance.

“Hello.” Without embarrassing the smiling face, Leng Xiaoyao still responded perfunctorily.

“Can we run together?” Jiang Xiaoxiao asked.

“This road isn’t owned by me. You can run however you want,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Although she didn’t snub the smiling face, she was impatient with Jiang Xiaoxiao.

Jiang Xiaoxiao felt Leng Xiaoyao’s rejection, so she was slightly displeased and anger grew in her heart.

Leng Xiaoyao was being too arrogant!

In that instant, Jiang Xiaoxiao showed a pitiful appearance. People who didn’t know the truth would think that Leng Xiaoyao was bullying her!

“Leng Xiaoyao, are you still holding a grudge against me for what happened before? I know I was wrong, and I have apologized to you. Can’t you let it go?”

Her words made it seem like Leng Xiaoyao was narrow-minded. Moreover, when Jiang Xiaoxiao said that, she secretly looked at Li Mochen. It couldn’t be more obvious that she was trying to stir things up between Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen.

However, Li Mochen showed no reaction at all.

Many elderly people who were jogging or walking around were familiar with Jiang Xiaoxiao. Seeing her looking pitiful in front of a man and a woman, they stood up for her.

“What’s going on here? Are you bullying this poor girl? Look how sad she is,” said an old lady. Seeing Jiang Xiaoxiao looking so wronged made her think that she was being bullied.

Upon hearing that, Leng Xiaoyao laughed, but it was very sarcastic. “Are we bullying her? Miss, did we bully you?”

The latter sentence was said to Jiang Xiaoxiao.

“No, no…” Jiang Xiaoxiao immediately denied it, but her pitiful appearance made her denial unconvincing.

“Miss, I really don’t know what you’re aggrieved about. You cursed me and my friend because you were in a bad mood previously. I accepted your apology and said I wouldn’t hold it against you, but you are still looking pitiful, as if we’ve bullied you.” Leng Xiaoyao had become impatient and didn’t hesitate to embarrass Jiang Xiaoxiao. She directly revealed the reason behind it.

Once Leng Xiaoyao said that, the people around who thought that Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen were bullying Jiang Xiaoxiao became embarrassed.

However, if Leng Xiaoyao told the truth, what did Jiang Xiaoxiao’s pitiful appearance mean?
