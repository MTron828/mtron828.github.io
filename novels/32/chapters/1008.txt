Chapter 1011 Am I Thick-skinned?

If they had known that Gu Ning’s medicine could cure serious diseases too, they would have been shocked.

Jiang Zezheng wasn’t seriously injured, and the injuries healed a lot under the effect of Gu Ning’s medicine, so the others were about to leave.

Jiang Zezheng planned to call his family so that his family could come and take care of him, but Gu Ning said, “You can leave the hospital tomorrow, and your family will be worried if they know that you’re injured. Why don’t you make an excuse to stay here for a night and then go back home tomorrow?”

Gu Ning wasn’t creating a chance for Zhu Yuanzhen and Jiang Zezheng to share some private time; she really believed that it wasn’t a big deal. It was still up to Jiang Zezheng whether he would do it or not.

“Well, we’re all busy today. Who should stay here to take care of Zezheng for a night?” Gao Chengyun said. He misunderstood Gu Ning, and became a wingman without delay. They were all actually free tonight.

Even Jiang Zezheng misunderstood Gu Ning. However, he hesitated to make a choice because he wasn’t sure where his relationship with Zhu Yuanzhen would go. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Zezheng, if you don’t mind, I can stay and take care of you. I’m free tonight,” Zhu Yuanzhen said. She was very excited to stay alone with the man she liked, but did her best to stay calm on the surface.

“Why should he mind it? We’re all friends, right? Ningning and I have to go back to the Tang family’s house now, because her parents just got married and will leave on their honeymoon tomorrow. She won’t see her parents for a long time if she doesn’t go back home tonight,” Cao Wenxin said, and held Gu Ning’s arm while walking out. She also gave Gao Chengyun and An Ran a knowing glance.

“Oh, I need to go meet my client right now. You can never keep your clients waiting,” Gao Chengyun said, and stepped out.

“I just remembered that my cousin is coming to visit me today. I’m afraid that I’ve gotta go now.” An Ran also made an excuse and left.

In the end, only Zhu Yuanzhen was left with Jiang Zezheng.

“Um, thanks,” Jiang Zezheng said, feeling a little shy.

“It’s fine. What do you want to have for dinner? I can go buy it for you,” Zhu Yuanzhen asked.

“Anything you can buy. I’m not picky,” Jiang Zezheng said. He knew that Zhu Yuanzhen was very clear about his likes and dislikes.

“Sure,” Zhu Yuanzhen said.

...

“Ningning, did you do that on purpose?” Cao Wenxin asked Gu Ning once they left.

“I didn’t, I simply think that it isn’t a big deal and he can leave the hospital tomorrow,” Gu Ning said and felt amused.

She just gave some advice, and Jiang Zezheng made the decision on his own.

“Ha-ha, I thought you did that on purpose so that they could share some private time!” Cao Wenxin said with surprise.

“It is indeed a great chance for them to get to know more about each other,” An Ran said.

“I hope so! Actually, I think Zezheng has a good impression of Yuanzhen, but Wenxin distracted his attention before, so he didn’t notice Yuanzhen. Since Wenxin already has a boyfriend now, he is beginning to notice that Yuanzhen really cares about him. However, he is hesitating to get closer to her because it seems like Yuanzhen is just a plan B for him,” Gao Chengyun said. Jiang Zezheng told him everything, but didn’t allow him to tell anyone else.

Nevertheless, as Jiang Zezheng’s good friend, he thought that he should do something.

“Since he has a good impression of Yuanzhen, it’s highly likely that they could get together,” An Ran said, and Cao Wenxin nodded as agreement.

Gao Chengyun suddenly realized that he shouldn’t have said that to them. “He told me not to tell anyone else about his feelings. Don’t let him know that I already told you all.”

“Relax, we’ll keep it secret,” An Ran and Cao Wenxin said at once.

They were all good friends, and good friends supported each other.

...

When they walked out of the hospital, they separated and Gu Ning along with Cao Wenxin went back to the Tang family’s house.

Gu Ning’s phone rang the moment they arrived home, and the caller was Leng Shaoting. The next second, Xin Bei called Cao Wenxin. They had just gotten off the plane at the airport in the capital.

They chatted with each other for a short time, then hung up, because they would have more time to talk with one another at night.

Tang Haifeng and the others understood that the callers had to be Leng Shaoting and Xin Bei when Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin answered a call at the same time, so they all looked at them with a smile.

Gu Ning didn’t mind it, but Cao Wenxin felt a little embarrassed and made an excuse before she ran to the bathroom.

“Wenxin, are you shy? Look at Ningning, she doesn’t care about it at all,” Tang Haifeng joked and raised his voice so that Cao Wenxin could hear it.

Everyone laughed with happiness and Cao Wenxin flushed red. Gu Ning, on the other hand, pretended to be annoyed. “Grandpa, am I thick-skinned in your eyes?”

Tang Haifeng was struck dumb for a second, then laughed out loud. “I didn’t say that, but I think you’re right.”

It sounded as if Gu Ning admitted that she was thick-skinned.

Everyone in the hall was amused again. Gu Ning also beamed.

Dinner was soon ready, and everyone went back to their own rooms after finishing it.

Although Gu Ning said that she wouldn’t stay in the Tang family’s house, the Tang family still arranged a room for her.
