3267 Are You Doubting Yaoyao’s Abilities?

Song Meiyu was reluctant to accept the result, but she could do nothing about it, so she had to leave.

When they got back to the living room, they didn’t go upstairs, but waited for Leng Xiaoyao and the others.

“Maid Zhang, get me a cup of tea,” said Song Meiyu.

“Sure.” Maid Zhang answered and immediately went to pour a cup of tea for Song Meiyu.

…

In the underground room.

After the first cut, no green showed, so Leng Xiaoyao continued.

When she started, Leng Changyuan and the others waited at the side nervously. Only Leng Xiaoyao stayed calm as usual.

They were disappointed when they didn’t see green after the first cut. Even if they were aware that it was impossible to cut out jade in one cut, they were still looking forward to seeing green.

After the second cut, green showed. Leng Changyuan and the others immediately became excited. “There is green. There is green!”

Leng Xiaoyao, on the other hand, didn’t look excited. Leng Changyuan asked, “Yaoyao, why are you so calm?”

“Because I have confidence in myself. Even if there isn’t jade in this one, I am sure there must be jade in the next one,” Leng Xiaoyao said confidently.

“Fine!” Leng Changyuan didn’t know what to say. He felt that Leng Xiaoyao was too confident. If there was no jade, she would be embarrassed. Luckily, it was green, so he didn’t want to be the wet blanket.

“What type is it?” asked Leng Yecheng.

Leng Xiaoyao observed it for a while, then said, “It isn’t clear yet. I need to make another cut.”

Leng Xiaoyao continued to cut the raw jade material. Although there was green, they were afraid that it was only a thin layer, so they were still worried.

After the third cut, they saw that it was a complete piece of jade and felt relieved.

The jade was bright green and transparent. Its texture was fine and moist with few cracks and cotton lines. The jade crystals were fine columnar, fiber (variable crystal) aggregates. The outline of the crystal was clear. When knocked it made a metallic crisp sound.

“This is a piece of high level jade. It’s gold-wire jade,” Leng Xiaoyao said with a big smile. Even though she knew there was high level jade inside, she was still very happy after finding out the type.

She could make a fortune with it.

Leng Xiaoyao absorbed the magical power of the jade and felt quite comfortable.

Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng didn’t know what gold-wire was, but they understood that a piece of high level jade could be worth a lot.

Gold-wire jade wasn’t rare, but it wasn’t easy to get either. In fact, high and top level jade was difficult to cut out.

At that moment, Shen Xiyin admired Leng Xiaoyao more than ever.

“I am sure there must be more high quality jade in this pile of raw jade materials since you can cut one out so easily,” Leng Yecheng said.

Leng Xiaoyao replied. “I agree.”

Leng Changyuan was somewhat worried. “If other people know about it, will it…”

He was afraid that the fortune might bring them bad luck.

“There is no need to worry. I don’t think anyone would dare to steal raw jade materials in the Leng family’s mansion,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t think it was a big deal.

“I’m not worried about that, but I’m afraid that you’ll be in danger,” Leng Changyuan exclaimed.

“I’m so strong. I don’t think anyone can hurt me, but you must be careful,” said Leng Xiaoyao. She was suddenly worried about their safety. “Oh, when I went to City Qin, I got several safety talismans. I’ll go fetch them later for the three of you. Remember to carry it with you. Don’t let it touch water. Take it off when you need to take a shower and put it back on once you finish. Grandpa, uncle, I know you don’t really believe in it, but it represents my good wishes, so please don’t turn me down!”

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t realize that she should give them a safety talisman until today. One could never be too careful. Although they weren’t likely to be hurt, it was still possible.

Shen Xiyin had witnessed Leng Xiaoyao’s abilities, so she believed in her completely. Since Leng Xiaoyao said that they needed it, she was more than willing to accept it.

“Sure, we’ll carry it with us everywhere,” said Leng Changyuan. He didn’t really believe it, but he would accept it if Leng Xiaoyao gave it to him.

“Thank you, Xiaoyao,” said Shen Xiyin. She couldn’t promise that she would always be safe, but with Leng Xiaoyao’s safety talisman she could be at ease.

Leng Xiaoyao continued to cut the raw jade material. A while later, the jade was out. It was as big as a basketball and was worth a lot of money. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Leng Xiaoyao chose another raw jade material with strong magical power. However, this one was much smaller.

They didn’t think that it was easy to cut out jade. After cutting one piece from the first raw jade material, they thought that it would be very hard to get another piece from the second one.

However, they also felt that it was likely to cut out jade again after succeeding once. Anyway, they had mixed emotions and were even more nervous than earlier.

After the first cut, green showed. They were excited and relieved.

Afterwards, they observed the quality of the jade.

Its texture was fine and pure without blemishes. The color was clear, bright, mellow, and a uniform emerald green. Leng Xiaoyao was also excited when she saw it. “This is old-pit glass jade.”

Hearing that, everyone was astonished and excited.

Even though both the old-pit glass jade and the gold-wire jade were at high level, there was a difference between their value. The old-pit glass jade was more precious than the gold-wire jade.

“Is this a dream?” asked Leng Yecheng. Although he knew that Leng Xiaoyao was good at stone-gambling, he still felt that it was unbelievable. How could it be so easy for Leng Xiaoyao to cut out jade?

“Are you doubting Yaoyao’s abilities?” Leng Changyuan asked unhappily. Even if he was also amazed, he understood that it was real.

“Of course not! I’m just surprised.” Leng Yecheng denied at once. He would never doubt Leng Xiaoyao’s abilities.

Shen Xiyin also found it amazing, but she said nothing.

After Leng Xiaoyao cut the old-pit glass jade out, it was as big as two fists, so it was extremely valuable too.

“Alright, that’s enough for today. You can make some jewelry with these two pieces. I’ll see whether I can cut out jade of other colors,” Leng Xiaoyao said, giving the two pieces of jade to Shen Xiyin.

Shen Xiyin, however, didn’t dare to take them. “It’s too valuable. I can’t take them. And I actually don’t need so much. Why don’t you give me several parts according to the sizes I need? It takes some time to make a piece of jewelry. After I finish one piece, you can have a look. When you’re satisfied, I’ll continue!”
