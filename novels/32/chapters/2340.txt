Chapter 2343: Protect Yourself First

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Well, I think you can just stay. We can do it after I arrive,” said Leng Shaoting after thinking about it for a while. He was still afraid that Gu Ning might be injured if she took action alone.

“Shaoting, I know you’re worried about me, but I need more practice to improve my skills. If you’re always worried and won’t allow me to put my skills into practice, I can’t make progress. Since you already told me about it, you can’t stop me from catching the criminal,” said Gu Ning seriously. She knew that Leng Shaoting was worried about her, but she needed practice to improve her skills.

During these days, she rarely had a fight. Only Shangguan Yang and Jing Yunyao practiced with her when they were free, but it was different from a real fight. If she wasn’t in real danger, she couldn’t exploit her potential.

Since Gu Ning said that, Leng Shaoting understood that he shouldn’t stop her, so he gave in. “Fine, but you must protect yourself from being injured. They are holding one of my soldiers hostage, but if there is any danger, protect yourself first.”

Leng Shaoting wasn’t selfish and he cared about his soldiers, but it was unreasonable to put Gu Ning in danger just to rescue the hostage. If the hostage couldn’t be rescued and Gu Ning was injured, it would have been a bad decision.

“No problem, I promise that I’ll protect myself well. If there is any danger, I’ll run away,” said Gu Ning. She mainly wanted to set Leng Shaoting’s mind at rest. She would do her best to save people, but wouldn’t put herself in danger. She was helpful, but she couldn’t save everyone.

Hearing Gu Ning’s promise, Leng Shaoting was relieved.

After that, they hung up. Gu Ning needed to change, then she went out and contacted Leng Shaoting for the location of the criminal.

Leng Shaoting called Ai Weishun and told them not to take action.

Knowing that Gu Ning asked to take action alone in case her abilities were limited, Ai Weishun wasn’t mad. He knew that Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting weren’t ordinary people. Both of them had super powers, so they were naturally much stronger than them.

Although they knew that both Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning had super powers, they weren’t clear about their specific abilities. Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning also kept some secrets from them. Therefore, Ai Weishun understood why Gu Ning wanted to take action alone. However, he was also worried about her safety.

“Boss, are you sure that Gu Ning will be fine alone?” Ai Weishun asked with concern.

“Of course, no need to worry about her,” said Leng Shaoting. He actually didn’t want to let Gu Ning take action alone, but Gu Ning insisted and he couldn’t stop her.

Since Leng Shaoting said that, Ai Weishun said nothing further.

Xin Bei was ready to go out, and would meet Ai Weishun and his other bros with Gu Ning. However, before Gu Ning came, he received Leng Shaoting’s call and Leng Shaoting told them that Gu Ning would go alone.

Xin Bei was astonished. He directly asked Leng Shaoting, “Boss, are you sure you’ll let Gu Ning go there alone?”

He was aware of Gu Ning’s unbelievable abilities, and believed that Gu Ning could solve the problem, but he was surprised that Leng Shaoting would agree.

After thinking about it for a while, he realized that Leng Shaoting had to agree if Gu Ning insisted.

“She insisted,” said Leng Shaoting, sounding a little unhappy.

“Fine!” Since Leng Shaoting already agreed, Xin Bei couldn’t stop Gu Ning.

As soon as Xin Bei finished the call with Leng Shaoting, he saw Gu Ning. “Gu Ning, are you sure that you’ll be fine if you take action alone?” Xin Bei walked towards her.

Although he believed in Gu Ning, he still couldn’t help worrying about her.

“I’ll be fine,” said Gu Ning.

“You must be careful. No matter what danger you run into, protect yourself first,” said Xin Bei. Although one of their mates was held hostage and he was very worried about him and hoped that Gu Ning could rescue him, Gu Ning was innocent after all. If anything dangerous happened, he still wanted Gu Ning to be safe.

“Sure,” said Gu Ning, then drove away.

At this moment, Leng Shaoting sent photos of the criminal, the person with superpowers and the hostage to Gu Ning.

After remembering their faces, Gu Ning called Leng Shaoting and asked him for the location of the criminal.

Leng Shaoting tracked them by hacking into surveillance cameras. Because their car never stopped moving, he could only tell Gu Ning their current location. Gu Ning couldn’t end her call with Leng Shaoting so that Leng Shaoting could tell her wherever they went over time.

Gu Ning sped up and immediately chased after the criminal.

…

Seeing Xin Bei coming back after walking out, Cao Wenxin asked, “What? Don’t you need to carry out a task?”

“No need. Someone else replaced me,” said Xin Bei as he hugged Cao Wenxin. He didn’t tell her that it was Gu Ning. Cao Wenxin was pregnant now, so he didn’t want to worry her.

Cao Wenxin didn’t bother to ask further about it. It was Xin Bei’s work and his work was always confidential. She was a smart girl, and knew what she shouldn’t ask about.

…

The criminal obviously didn’t intend to stay in the city, so he moved towards the suburbs until he reached a barren mountain, where there were no surveillance cameras. As a result, Leng Shaoting couldn’t find out where he was right now.

Gu Ning had to search for the criminal on her own afterwards.

Normally, criminals would find an unobtrusive place to stay for a while after they came to the wilderness. It was the best place for them to hide since there were no surveillance cameras.

It was large, but Gu Ning could easily look for what she wanted with the help of her Jade Eyes. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Leng Shaoting lost the criminal, so Gu Ning ended her call with him and directly put her phone into her telepathic eye space.

After Gu Ning drove into a place where there were no surveillance cameras, she put the car into her telepathic eye space as well, then set out on foor to find the criminal.

The car would be noisy and would easily be noticed. Gu Ning didn’t want to alert the criminal.

Gu Ning walked very fast, but barely made any noise. At the same time, it was a little windy, so nobody could hear her.

With the help of her Jade Eyes, Gu Ning searched for the criminal as she walked.
