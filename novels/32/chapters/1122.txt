Chapter 1123 The Same Person?

“Probably because of something important,” Zhang Zhiheng said. He didn’t think that Leng Shaoting would have a close personal relationship with Gu Ning.Wang Shijie agreed.

...

Zi Beiying and her friends left the clubhouse at 11 pm.

Xu Qinyin and Xu Jinchen didn’t get in their car until Zi Beiying started her car.

On the way back home, Xu Qinyin asked Xu Jinchen, “Jinchen, what do you think of Zi Beiying? I think she’s a good girl and you two could be a great couple.”

Xu Qinyin really had a good impression of Zi Beiying, and would love to accept Zi Beiying as her sister-in-law.

“You don’t need to worry about me. Why don’t you find yourself a job or a boyfriend first?” Xu Jinchen said. He was somewhat unwilling to talk about this topic.

Xu Qinyin pouted. She was a little disappointed when Xu Jinchen refused to give her an answer. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Nan mentioned the same thing to Zi Beiying in the car. “Lady Zi, I think Mr. Xu is a great man. You two look very beautiful when you’re together.”

Hearing that, Zi Beiying flushed but did her best to compose herself. “You must be kidding!”

Nan understood that Zi Beiying was avoiding the question, which meant she was nervous. It seemed that at least Zi Beiying didn’t hate Xu Jinchen.

Nan closed her mouth and dropped the topic.

Qi Ziyue and Tang Yaxin stayed in the same ward. Although they had received the best treatment, they were still in a lot of pain and could barely sleep.

Tang Yaxin kept swearing at ‘Tang Aining’ till Qi Ziyue told her to shut up.

Tang Bingsen also heard that both of them had been beaten by a woman called Tang Aining, because Qi Ziyue couldn’t keep it a secret from him.

After coming back from a business trip, Tang Bingsen went to the hospital without delay.

Qi Ziyue then told Tang Bingsen about what they had been through and what ‘Tang Aining’ had in her hands.

Tang Bingsen then investigated ‘Tang Aining’, trying to figure out a good way to get rid of her.

“This ‘Tang Aining’ is very skilled at fighting, and she was able to beat five armed bodyguards within a minute,” Qi Ziyue said. “She’s as strong and cruel as the Tang Aining we know.”

Thinking of that, Qi Ziyue even trembled a little in fear. He was a coward after all.

“I wonder whether they’re the same person. Tang Aining could still be alive! It couldn’t just be a coincidence that they share the same name and fighting skills!” Tang Yaxin said all of a sudden. However, she didn’t really believe that, because she had witnessed Tang Aining’s body being burned.

“No, they can’t be the same person. I think this woman must be a good friend of Tang Aining, so she is using Tang Aining’s identity to avenge her death,” Tang Bingsen said with certainty.

Actually, both Tang Yaxin and Tang Bingsen were right, but normally people wouldn’t believe Tang Yaxin’s guess.

“No matter who she is, it’s very clear that her target is the Tang family. She’s dangerous and we must take it seriously,” Qi Ziyue said.

“We’ll kill whoever dares to stand in our way,” Tang Bingsen said with an evil expression. He would get what he wanted by hook or by crook.

“Dad, why don’t we hire a professional killer to do it for us?” Tang Yaxin suggested. She couldn’t wait to see ‘Tang Aining’ killed right away.

“Alright, I’ll deal with it, and you two should have a good recovery,” Tang Bingsen said. In fact, he had the same idea as Tang Yaxin.

The next day, Leng Shaoting got up early to prepare breakfast for Gu Ning. They had breakfast together, then Leng Shaoting left for the military base.

Gu Ning, on the other hand, called Zi Beiying and Xu Qinyin to go to Charm’s store with her.

Zi Beiying and Gu Ning arrived at almost the same time, so they waited for Xu Qinyin together in the parking lot.

Gu Ning and Zi Beiying were very attractive young women, so they attracted a lot of attention from the men around them once they got out of their cars. Even Nan was a cool beauty with short hair.

Several men tried to strike up a conversation with Nan, but they were all scared away by Mengda who was tall and strong.

During this time, Zi Beiying told Gu Ning about what had happened to Wu Mina. Gu Ning showed no sympathy for Wu Mina because she thought that Wu Mina deserved it.
