Chapter 1545: An Enemy in Love

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

She wanted to know whether Leng Shaoting would be displeased. If he didn’t mind it, she would agree to play the game with Qi Tianlin.

Although it was just a game, Qi Tianlin had an ID which looked to be a couple’s name with hers. Therefore, Gu Ning thought it was necessary for her to ask for Leng Shaoting’s opinions.

Leng Shaoting didn’t give her a reply right away, so Gu Ning thought that he must be busy now.

Actually, Leng Shaoting already read her message, but he didn’t immediately reply to Gu Ning because he was in a bad mood. If Qi Tianlin didn’t have an ID which looked to be a couple’s name with Gu Ning’s, he wouldn’t mind, but Qi Tianlin did.

He knew that Qi Tianlin liked Gu Ning so it was a challenge to his ability. After thinking for a while, Leng Shaoting logged in the game and changed his ID to be “the Husband of the Future Queen”.

It might seem childlike, but he accepted the challenge.

After that, Leng Shaoting sent Gu Ning a message back.

Leng Shaoting: Sure, but I must join you and you can’t be in the same team with him.

Gu Ning was amused, but she accepted his conditions.

Gu Ning: When are you free?

Leng Shaoting: Between 12 pm and 2 pm.

Gu Ning: Great, he and I will be in different teams, and we can beat him together.

Afterwards, Gu Ning suddenly remembered that she didn’t tell Leng Shaoting that she was going back to City B today. If she didn’t tell him, he would be upset when he found she was absent.

The opening ceremony would be held tomorrow, and she planned to go back to City B this afternoon and come back to the capital the day after tomorrow. She would leave for Kunlun Mountain once she came back to the capital so she wouldn’t have much time to spend with Gu Man and her other family members.

She wasn’t sure when Leng Shaoting would be back in the capital, so they wouldn’t book the plane tickets until he was back. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Gu Ning sent Qi Tianlin a message later and invited him to play the game after 12 pm.

In fact, it was not only Gu Ning; Qi Tianlin was also busy, so it wasn’t easy for them to find some free time to play the game together.

It was already 11:30 am now, so Qi Tianlin agreed.

When it was 12 pm, Gu Ning received a message from Leng Shaoting and Qi Tianlin at almost the same time, asking her whether she was prepared.

Gu Ning told Leng Shaoting that she was logging in.

Without delay, she told Qi Tianlin that they would be the leaders in different teams so that they could compete against each other. In that case, she wouldn’t be in the same team with Qi Tianlin.

Qi Tianlin didn’t think it was a problem, so he agreed.

Once Gu Ning logged into the game, she saw many messages and many players wanted to add her as their friend.

Gu Ning spent some time adding them as her friends. After that, she suddenly noticed that Leng Shaoting’s ID was changed in the game, and she was amused by his childlike behavior.

She had a jealous boyfriend, but she was happy with it.

The second Gu Ning made a team, she added Leng Shaoting as her teammate.

Other players needed Gu Ning’s permission to join her team, but she actually didn’t care who would be her other teammates, because she was confident that they could win.

Qi Tianlin frowned in annoyance when he saw the ID of “the Husband of the Future Queen”, but he didn’t know that the player was Leng Shaoting.

Anyway, many of Gu Ning’s fans made up an ID which followed Gu Ning’s ID in the game, like “the Knight of the Future Queen”, “the Lover of the Future Queen”, and so on.

Other players also noticed the two unusual IDs in the two teams. One was “the Husband of the Future Queen”, while the other was “the Future Emperor”.

Some of them began to joke about it.

Player A: Hey, the Husband of the Future Queen, you have a rival in love now, but we’ll support you since we’re in the same team.

Player B: Right, we’ll support you to protect Goddess Gu.

Although it was a joke, Leng Shaoting was displeased and couldn’t wait to teach Qi Tianlin a lesson.

The Husband of the Future Queen: No matter who tries to steal my wife from me, they will be beheaded.

Player A: Wow, sounds so cool. I like it.

Player B: Me too!

Player C: I’m so excited now.

Qi Tianlin was displeased too when he saw the above messages, but he didn’t bother to argue with them.

Gu Ning wore a resigned look, because these players were adding fuel to the flames.

Qi Tianlin soon had enough teammates, so the game began.

When the two teams reached the battle stage, they were ready to fight against each other.

Leng Shaoting directly faced Qi Tianlin once he stepped on the stage. Because his level was higher than Qi Tianlin’s, his role in the game was more powerful as well.

Other players were also in fierce fights, and Gu Ning helped her teammates sometimes.

A short while later, Qi Tianlin’s teammates were all dead, and he was alone on the stage.

Gu Ning was left with two teammates, so only three members of her team stayed on the stage.

However, Gu Ning and Player A didn’t go to help Leng Shaoting but stood aside and watched his fight against Qi Tianlin, because it was quite obvious that Leng Shaoting was at an advantage.
