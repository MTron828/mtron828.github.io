Chapter 126: I Heard You Don’t Like Women

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning let An Guangyao take full responsibility of the company, so he would deal with the following things.

Those who wanted to buy Shenghua Real Estate had kept an eye on it. Thus they soon received the news that Shenghua Real Estate had already been bought.

The minute the news went abroad, everybody who planned to buy Shenghua Real Estate at a low price felt disappointed.

Four hundred million yuan actually wasn’t a high price, but all of them wanted to pay a lower price than that. In the end, they had all lost the great opportunity.

At the same time, some doubted that Shenghua Real Estate had been bought, and thought that An Guangyao had borrowed the money he needed, because no one knew who the buyer was and An Guangyao was still the chairman of Shenghua Real Estate.

As for the shareholders who were all dismissed, everyone also believed that it was only because An Guangyao wanted to fully be in charge of the company. No one knew that An Guangyao had transfered the shares to Gu Ning.

Anyway, Shenghua Real Estate stayed afloat.

It wasn’t 4 pm yet when Gu Ning left, and it was too early to go home.

All of sudden, Gu Ning thought of giving the gun back to Leng Shaoting. She was free now, and intended to invite Leng Shaoting out, but what should they eat?

Gu Ning wanted to have an expensive meal.

While she was thinking about that, she went to change her clothes and remove the makeup.

After that, Gu Ning had an idea. She was going to eat lobsters and crabs.

Then she called Leng Shaoting.

When Leng Shaoting received Gu Ning’s call, he had just gotten back to Fenghua Luxury Mansion with Xu Jinchen.

He hung up Gu Ning’s call, and told Xu Jinchen to stop the car. He then asked him to get out directly.

“What?” Xu Jinchen was struck dumb. He had no idea what Leng Shaoting was going to do.

“I have something to deal with and I need the car,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Why do you need to be in a hurry? Can’t you drive me to my home first?” Xu Jinchen complained. Leng Shaoting looked at ease. It didn’t seem like something important was going to happen.

“No.” It was an undeniable rejection. Xu Jinchen had to get out then.

Leng Shaoting opened the door of the passenger seat, stepping outside. He passed the front of the car, sat in the driver seat, and left directly, leaving Xu Jinchen at the same place.

It was Xu Jinchen’s car actually. Leng Shaoting grabbed it from him.

Gu Ning called Leng Shaoting to meet in a seafood restaurant near the downtown. Gu Ning wasn’t in the downtown, but wasn’t not far away either. It took her 40 minutes to get there by walking.

The appointed time was 5 pm, so she planned to walk there.

Unexpectedly, Leng Shaoting arrived at the restaurant at 4:30 pm. He was half an hour early.

Leng Shaoting didn’t realize that he was half an hour early until he had arrived.

Since when had he become so active? Even if he wanted the gun, he had to wait till five pm.

Anyway, he could only wait since he was already here.

Leng Shaoting stopped the car at the parking lot outside the restaurant. And he was waiting in the car glancing at his wrist watch to check the time once in a while. It was the first time that he had felt that the time passed so slowly.

Around 4:40 pm, Gu Ning finally appeared in Leng Shaoting’s sight. Although she was 50 meters away, he recognized her in the first look. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

When Leng Shaoting noticed Gu Ning, his anxiety disappeared immediately.

He didn’t get out of the car until Gu Ning came near. Leng Shaoting met Gu Ning face to face, like it was a coincidence.

Gu Ning was stuck dumb for a second. She felt a little displeased. “I didn’t expect you to be here so early. I said that I’d give the gun back to you, and I will. You don’t need to rush.”

This was the first time that someone had been unhappy because the other had arrived early for a “date”. Besides, Gu Ning was being slightly unreasonable now.

Leng Shaoting had arrived early, but he didn’t force her to give the gun back to him right now.

Well, it was mainly because Gu Ning still had a bad opinion towards Leng Shaoting. She got displeased for no reason when she met him.

Leng Shaoting also disliked Gu Ning’s words, but he didn’t say anything because he was here for the gun after all.

Gu Ning guided Leng Shaoting, walking into the restaurant. They received many surprised looks. However, this time, those looks weren’t for her, but for him.

“There is nothing to look at,” Gu Ning said with annoyance. Leng Shaoting frowned a little. He didn’t like Gu Ning’s attitude, nor the attention, but he couldn’t stop others from staring at him.

Gu Ning asked for a private room. She ordered lobsters, crabs, fish and so forth.

The two sat across from each other, but no one said a word.

Gu Ning looked at Leng Shaoting. She liked his appearance, but she was unhappy that he was going to take the gun back.

All of sudden, an evil idea dawned on Gu Ning. She asked, “I heard you don’t like women?”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was upset. “Who told you that?”

He thought that it had to be Chen Meng, because Chen Meng had just met Gu Ning.

It wasn’t the first time that Leng Shaoting had faced that question. He had been upset, but hadn’t been nervous before, but now, he felt nervous.

Facing Gu Ning, he was nervous for no reason. Probably he didn’t want her to believe it.

“I don’t want to tell you,” Gu Ning said.

“It’s not true,” Leng Shaoting explained.

No, it was not true. Although he hadn’t fallen in love with any woman yet, and he hadn’t thought about that question either, he was sure that he liked women, not men.

Then, the two fell into silence again.

Before long, the dishes were on the table. Without hesitation, Gu Ning started to enjoying the meal, while Leng Shaoting sat still.

“Why aren’t you eating?” Gu Ning asked.

Actually, she didn’t care whether he ate or not, but he kept looking at her. It was strange.

“I’m not hungry,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Well, am I too beautiful that you prefer to look at me instead of eating?” Gu Ning joked.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was struck dumb for a second. He then realized that he had been absent-minded staring at Gu Ning. He panicked a little, but retorted, “Of course not.”

Gu Ning couldn’t help but roll her eyes. She wasn’t blind to miss that detail.
