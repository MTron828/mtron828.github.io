Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Jing Yunyao planned to take the tree vine to buy some clothes after he was covered with her clothing, but the tree vine wanted to wait till Gu Ning was back, so they listened to him.

Although the tree vine only looked like a little boy about three years old, he was actually hundreds of years old. Therefore, when he wanted to hold Gu Ning’s hand, Leng Shaoting pulled him to the side and said with displeasure, “Boy, you better stay away from my girl.”

Hearing that, everyone was surprised. The tree vine was just a little boy!

Although his real age was hundreds of years, he had the appearance of a 3-year-old kid. Did Leng Shaoting have to be so serious?

“He’s just a kid,” said Gu Ning resignedly.

“He’s a male and he’s at least three hundred years old,” said Leng Shaoting. If it was a little girl, he might not be displeased. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He didn’t know this little boy was the tree vine earlier, so he didn’t stop Gu Ning from hugging him.

Gu Ning didn’t know what to say, neither did the others, but they could understand Leng Shaoting’s worries.

Anyway, it was their own affair, so they didn’t interfere.

“Master…” The tree vine stared at Gu Ning pitifully. He felt that Leng Shaoting was being a jealous boyfriend. Although he was a male and was three hundred years old, he was a monster, not a real man.

“Um, fine, walk by yourself.” Gu Ning didn’t want to annoy Leng Shaoting, so she didn’t hold the little boy’s hand.

“Alright!” The tree vine didn’t argue with them. He wasn’t a real kid, so he knew what he shouldn’t do.

After that, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting took the tree vine to buy some clothes.

Although the tree vine had lived for three hundred years, this was the first time that he had ever been a human being. So he was extremely excited to see the world.

He asked about everything that he saw.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t think he was annoying. Leng Shaoting could get along well with him as long as he didn’t go to hold Gu Ning’s hand or ask for a hug. He just didn’t want the tree vine to touch Gu Ning, he could stand anything else the tree vine wanted to do.

They soon reached a shopping mall. After they got out of the car and walked into the crowd, they attracted a lot of attention. Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were a beautiful couple, and the tree vine looked adorable as a little boy. So they were too attractive to be ignored.

Even though the tree vine was wearing clothing adjusted by Jing Yunyao, it fit him very well.

Many people guessed their relationship, some believing they were a family. However, Gu Ning was too young, so they thought the little boy should be her younger brother.

Some people wanted to have fun with the cute little boy, but they were scared by Leng Shaoting’s cold aura.

“Sis, what’s that?” The tree vine asked Gu Ning when he saw a game machine. Because Gu Ning reminded him not to call her master outside, the tree vine called her sister.

“It’s a game machine,” said Gu Ning.

“What’s a game machine?” The tree vine continued.

Leng Shaoting turned to stare at the tree vine and said, “You have too many questions. Ningning will be tired. I’ll let someone educate you later.”

The tree vine opened his mouth, then shut up.

Gu Ning also felt it was enough, so she said nothing.

They took the tree vine to a kids’ clothing store of an international brand. Once they walked in, the little tree vine attracted the attention of several saleswomen.

They were also amazed by Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s beautiful appearances, but they were all married, so they were more excited to see a cute kid than a handsome man.

“Wow, he’s so pretty!”

“Right, he’s even prettier than the model of our brand.”

“Right!” A saleswoman turned to look at Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting, then asked them politely, “Sir, Miss, are you shopping for clothing for this kid? Do you need my recommendations or do you want to shop on your own?”

The tree vine was so adorable that she wanted to match clothes for him, but Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were here, so she had to behave.

“I believe in your choices. You can pick clothes for him, as long as he likes them. Um, we need twenty full sets for him. He only needs to try on one set and we can get twenty of the same size. It’ll be tiring if he has to try all of them,” said Gu Ning. She thought it was annoying to shop for clothing, and they needed a lot, so she let the saleswoman do it for her. She believed that they had good taste.

In addition, the tree vine was very beautiful, so he should be pretty in any clothes.

Although this was a kids’ clothing store, there were many rich customers. And rich people always bought a lot of sets at a time, so it wasn’t strange that Gu Ning wanted twenty sets. However, it wasn’t common either, so the saleswoman was slightly surprised.

She couldn’t handle it alone, so the three saleswomen did it together.

Before that, they invited Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting to rest in the lounge and they poured tea for them.

The tree vine didn’t care much about the clothing, so he was fine with Gu Ning’s arrangement.

Due to Leng Shaoting’s presence, he didn’t dare to bother Gu Ning.

There were customers with kids in the store, and they were also amazed by the tree vine’s beauty. However, some of them got jealous.

It wasn’t a big deal if they were just jealous, but a boy around five years old was unhappy that the tree vine was so welcomed. He immediately walked to the tree vine and tried to push him.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting saw it, but did nothing, because the boy couldn’t really hurt the tree vine.

As a monster which was hundreds of years old, the tree vine saw the boy coming to push him. He didn’t avoid the boy, but just stood there.

When the boy pushed the tree vine, the tree vine didn’t move at all. Instead, the boy felt as if he had knocked into a wall and bounced backwards. He fell on the ground and instantly started crying.

Hearing his cry, the three saleswomen turned to look at him. When they wanted to ask about it, the boy’s mother ran over and helped her son get back to his feet. “Oh my dear boy, what happened?”

“He pushed me!” The boy told on the tree vine.

The tree vine pushed him? The boy was so unkind to lie!

“How dare you do that to my son! You don’t have any manners at all. I must teach you a lesson.” The woman got mad and wanted to slap the tree vine.

Although the woman was no match for the tree vine, it looked like a three year old kid. If it appeared too strong, it might cause unnecessary trouble. Therefore, Gu Ning needed to stand out at that moment.
