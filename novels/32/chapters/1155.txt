Chapter 1156 Accept One Condition

“It is possible as long as you agree to one condition I lay down,” Gu Ning said. “I can support you to finish your education and cure your father’s leg.”Gu Ning thought that it wasn’t a bad idea if Yuan Mao could work for her in the future. He could be very loyal to her since she was willing to support him.

Yuan Mao rounded his eyes in shock and couldn’t believe his ears.

“Miss Gu, are you sure?” Yuan Mao asked.

Gu Ning smiled. “Of course, I’m willing to solve these problems for you and help you out.”

“Really? I can’t believe it!” Yuan Mao was thrilled and astonished. He indeed ached to go back to his school, but he wanted his father to get good treatment first.

Although his father only broke one leg, his father couldn’t work as usual to make enough money. And because his family wasn’t rich, and they could barely afford the medical fee.

“Yes,” Gu Ning said with certainty.

“Well, what’s the condition?” Yuan Mao asked. He wanted this chance, but he was afraid that Gu Ning might tell him to do something illegal. He was very cautious and wouldn’t easily be tempted.

Although he was young and lacked social experience, he remained calm.

“You must sign a labor contract of 10 years with Shenghua Real Estate after your graduation, which means that you must work for Shenghua for at least 10 years in the future. You’ll get a decent pay and you can choose to stay or leave after 10 years,” Gu Ning said.

Ten years weren’t short, nor was it too long. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

If Yuan Mao thought that Shenghua Real Estate was a great platform to put his skills into practice, he would stay. If he wanted to leave for a better company, Gu Ning wouldn’t force him to stay either.

Gu Ning appreciated talented people, but she hoped that they would work for her voluntarily. She wasn’t sure whether Yuan Mao would agree with it, because it was a little strict.

Yuan Mao was surprised again after hearing the condition.

What? I must sign a labor contract of 10 years with Shenghua Real Estate?

Yuan Mao didn’t think that it was an unreasonable condition, but thought it was to his advantage. After all, it was difficult for graduates to find a good job nowadays.

Exactly because of this situation, Yuan Mao couldn’t figure out why Gu Ning was willing to wait for him.

Even if he was successfully accepted by a university, it didn’t mean that he would be an outstanding architect.

Yuan Mao asked, “Miss Gu, this condition is totally to my own advantage, so I don’t understand why you’re willing to do that. There are plenty of skilled architects in the world. Why don’t you hire them? If I can’t become an outstanding architect in the future, I’ll be useless for Shenghua.”

Gu Ning smiled. She liked smart people who valued personal loyalty above money, and she believed that Yuan Mao was one of them. She also understood that it took time to test one’s loyalty, and she was patient.

“You’re right. It probably won’t do my company any good in the future, but I have confidence in my decision and you,” Gu Ning said. “You can think of me as a kind person who’s willing to give you a helping hand.”

Yuan Mao was struck dumb for a second. He didn’t expect that a stranger would be so kind to him when he had nothing to offer. After all, there were more good people than bad people in this world.

Since Gu Ning was willing to help him, Yuan Mao didn’t ask further about it.

“Thank you so much, Miss Gu. I accept the condition you lay down,” Yuan Mao said.

Yuan Mao was grateful to Gu Ning, and he realized that he met a generous benefactor.

Yuan Mao never doubted whether Gu Ning was able to make the decision to let him sign the contract with Shenghua Real Estate, because he could see that Gu Ning was a very important figure in the company. Although Gu Ning looked young, she wasn’t ordinary at all.

Afterwards, Gu Ning went to General Supervisor Chen’s office together with Yuan Mao.

Once they were gone, the others began to discuss it.

“Who’s that girl? She seems to be an important figure.”

“She must be, since she could easily fire Supervisor Zhang and Zhang Shun.”

“Right, but what did she say to Yuan Mao just then?”

“Will Yuan Mao be fired too?”

“I don’t think so, because Yuan Mao looked very excited. He must have heard some good news!”

“Did the girl decide to help Yuan Mao?”

“...”

They talked about it for a long while, but nobody knew the answer.

...

Gu Ning told General Supervisor Chen to pay Yuan Mao his salary before she left with him.

Although Gu Ning didn’t explain it at all, General Supervisor Chen understood that Yuan Mao was super lucky today and was picked by Gu Ning. He actually also had a good impression of Yuan Mao.

Zhang Shun was already fired, but he didn’t leave yet, because he was waiting for Supervisor Zhang. Therefore, he saw Gu Ning walking out with Yuan Mao.

However, Zhang Shun wasn’t as smart as General Supervisor Chen, and he didn’t understand why Gu Ning did that.
