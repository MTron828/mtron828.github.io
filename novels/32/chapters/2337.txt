Xin Bei went to see Leng Shaoting again, and told him that he was going to propose.

Leng Shaoting didn’t know that Xin Bei wanted to get married as soon as he went back home, so he didn’t think about that.

If Xin Bei was going to propose, Leng Shaoting certainly would let a few of their brothers go with him. Because Leng Shaoting needed to deal with something, he wouldn’t go with them, otherwise he would go to see Gu Ning along the way.

Leng Shaoting told Ai Weishun and Zhao Weixian to go with Xin Bei since they were free now. Two soldiers who were led by Xin Bei also went with them.

Leng Shaoting’s subordinates were all men, so he didn’t think they could set up a good proposal. So he decided to turn to Gu Ning for help. After all, Gu Ning was a girl, and knew girls much better than men did. Cao Wenxin was also Gu Ning’s cousin, so Gu Ning knew her very well.

After Xin Bei and the others walked out of his office, Leng Shaoting called Gu Ning.

He chatted with Gu Ning for a short while before he got to the point. “Ningning, I need you to help me with something.”

“What is it?” Gu Ning asked.

“Do you know that Wenxin is pregnant?” asked Leng Shaoting. He wanted to make sure whether Gu Ning knew or not.

Gu Ning understood that Cao Wenxin must have called Xin Bei and Xin Bei shared the news with Leng Shaoting afterwards.

After all Xin Bei needed Leng Shaoting’s permission to leave so that he could propose to Cao Wenxin.

With Leng Shaoting calling her and saying that he needed her help, it must have something to do with Xin Bei and Cao Wenxin. However, Gu Ning didn’t know what exactly it was.

“Yeah, I know. Only she and I are aware of that right now. She doesn’t know how to face her family, so I told her to relax for a few days. I bet Xin Bei already heard the good news,” said Gu Ning.

“Right, Xin Bei just asked me for leave. He wants to propose to Wenxin right away, but he doesn’t have much time to set up a good proposal. Can you help us with that?” said Leng Shaoting.

“He’ll propose?” Gu Ning was surprised, but it was understandable that Xin Bei wanted to make a quick proposal after knowing Cao Wenxin got pregnant. “No problem, I’ll handle that.”

“Keep it a secret from Wenxin. Xin Bei will contact you once he arrives. You two can discuss what to do next,” said Leng Shaoting.

“Sure, I know,” said Gu Ning.

She definitely wouldn’t let Cao Wenxin know, or it wouldn’t be a surprise!

“Well…” All of a sudden, Leng Shaoting gave a sigh.

“What?” Gu Ning asked with a smile.

“Ningning, why haven’t you reached the age of consent yet? I have to wait another two and a half years.” Leng Shaoting complained. It was torture for him to wait so long.

Although they were determined to marry each other and would get married sooner or later if nothing unexpected happened, it wouldn’t be legal until they had the marriage certificate.

“Pffttt.” Gu Ning snorted with laughter. It turned out that Leng Shaoting was upset because Xin Bei was going to propose to Cao Wenxin.

“It’s not my fault. It’s fate which made me be reincarnated in a body of eighteen years old. Anyway, if I was reincarnated in the body of an over twenty-two year old, I might not have met you. I might have had a boyfriend or gotten married already,” said Gu Ning. It was hard to tell what exactly would have happened.

Compared with other possibilities, it was the best result that she was reincarnated in Gu Ning’s body.

Leng Shaoting was scared. It was true that he might not be able to meet Gu Ning and be together with her if she was reincarnated in another person’s body.

“So, it is what it is,” said Gu Ning.

“Right, and we’re fated to be together this life.” Leng Shaoting stopped complaining about it.

“Yes, we’re meant to be together,” said Gu Ning with a smile. She was willing to please Leng Shaoting by saying something he wanted to hear.

After chatting for another while, they hung up. Because Gu Ning was driving, Leng Shaoting didn’t want to distract her.

Xin Bei needed a romantic proposal set, so Gu Ning didn’t go to eat in the Tang family’s house, but went to work on it right away.

It was a lot of work and she alone couldn’t finish it within a limited time. She needed a professional planner.

Due to the weather, they could only make the proposal indoors. So after pondering over it, Gu Ning chose Shengshi Hotel.

She would call Cao Wenxin to dine together in the hotel, which wouldn’t arouse any suspicions.

In case there were no good rooms left later, Gu Ning went to book a large private room first before going to meet a professional planner.

Because they didn’t have much time, they hired a lot of people to finish the set up at 3 pm.

At noon, Gu Ning received a call from Xin Bei. Xin Bei said that he should arrive at City B before 4 pm and the city center at about 5 pm if nothing unexpected happened.

Xin Bei didn’t tell Cao Wenxin that he was coming to City B today. Instead, he told her that he would go to see her tomorrow. He made an excuse that he was occupied today and couldn’t leave until his work was done. Therefore, Cao Wenxin thought that she would only see Xin Bei tomorrow.

Gu Ning also called Cao Wenxin at noon. She said that she was going to treat a few friends this afternoon and invited Cao Wenxin to join them.

Cao Wenxin seldom turned Gu Ning down, so she agreed.

Afterwards, Gu Ning called Gao Chengyun and directly said that Xin Bei was going to propose to Cao Wenxin at Shengshi Hotel today. If they were free, they could come.

Gao Chengyun was greatly surprised to hear the news, but he already got over Cao Wenxin, so he wasn’t very sad.

Cao Wenxin was still his good friend, so they had to be present. Even if they weren’t free, they would clear their schedule for that.

Therefore, Gao Chengyun agreed at once, and Gu Ning reminded him to keep it a secret from Cao Wenxin.

Gu Ning didn’t tell them that Cao Wenxin was pregnant. She thought that it was better to keep it a secret for now. She would let Cao Wenxin tell them later.

…

At 5 pm, Xin Bei and his bros arrived, but they had rushed over, so Xin Bei didn’t buy a proposal ring yet. He needed to buy one right now.

He could buy an average ring for the proposal, and book a custom-made ring for their wedding.

Before long, Xin Bei bought the ring he needed. Although he didn’t have time to carefully pick a ring, the one he bought wasn’t cheap.

At 5:30 pm, they reached the set. Upon seeing the set Gu Ning made for him, Xin Bei and the other men were all amazed..
