Chapter 609 Do You Want More?

Although Feng Xueqin disliked Liu Xinqi’s face and body, she still had to admit that Liu Xinqi was a master at sex. There was no doubt that he was a master at sex given his rich sexual experience. If he had a good-looking face or a sexy body, countless women would be willing to have sex with him for free. Therefore, Feng Xueqin gradually started enjoying it and then let her desire guide the way.

Liu Xinqi did fulfill his promise and didn’t hurt Feng Xueqin in bed, but Feng Xueqin still felt exhausted after hours of making love in different sexual positions. It was so exciting that she forgot that the man who was penetrating her was Liu Xinqi. Feng Xueqin also had to admit that it was more exciting to make love with Liu Xinqi than those strong young men.

Seeing Feng Xueqin enjoying it, a touch of disdain flashed by Liu Xinqi’s eyes. It seemed to be true that a woman’s body would never lie. Feng Xueqin’s pleasure was the approval of his skills, so he moved even harder. Men all wanted to prove their sexual skills in bed, and they got more excited if women enjoyed it.

“Are you satisfied?” Liu Xinqi asked with an amorous smile.

“Yea-yeah!” Feng Xueqin said listening to her heart.

“Do you want more?” Liu Xinqi asked again.

“Y-yes!” Feng Xueqin’s voice was full of desire, and Liu Xinqi continued to penetrate her violently.

“Am I better than your strong young lovers?” Liu Xinqi asked once more.

Liu Xinqi, of course, knew that Feng Xueqin had many young lovers. She was loyal to Tang Yunfan, but her body wasn’t. In addition, Feng Xueqin had sexual desire too, and she couldn’t tolerate years of her life without sex.

“Yes!” Feng Xueqin said.

Liu Xinqi didn’t stop a second and was getting increasingly violent. Feng Xueqin even begged him to stop a few times halfway. However, Liu Xinqi wasn’t willing to stop because he didn’t get many chances to have sex with Feng Xueqin. So they didn’t stop until hours had passed. They slept for a few hours, then it was daybreak. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, Feng Xueqin touched Liu Xinqi’s cock by accident in her sleep, and Liu Xinqi was turned on again. Once he was turned on, he couldn’t sleep any longer, so he began to press on Feng Xueqin and penetrate her once more.

“You...” Feng Xueqin was annoyed, but didn’t resist. Nevertheless, Feng Xueqin closed her eyes the entire time, because it was bright now, and she was reluctant to see his face.

“Well, you can turn to me to satisfy your sexual needs,” Liu Xinqi said.

Feng Xueqin didn’t say a word, but her silence was also an affirmative answer. After having violent sex with Liu Xinqi, she thought that those strong young men were less attractive now. In fact, Feng Xueqin thought that what Liu Xinqi said wasn’t a bad idea.

Gu Ning sent Gu Man to the Tang family’s house as usual before she left. She went to pick up Yu Zi and then told Su Tongnuo to go to the building of Tanghuang Entertainment. They were going to shoot the video advertisement today.

When they arrived, some people in the hall saw them and got excited at once. Because of the hot post on Weibo, everyone got to know Gu Ning’s identity, so they paid more attention to her today.

“She is Goddess Gu!”

“She’s so beautiful!”

They all complimented Gu Ning and ignored Su Tongnuo, but Su Tongnuo wasn’t annoyed or jealous at all because Gu Ning was indeed very outstanding.

Gu Ning remained calm, and didn’t think that it was a big deal, because she didn’t have any vanity.

They would shoot in the same photo studio as before with a video director.

It wasn’t complicated, and was just a short film of dozens of seconds. Although they needed to shoot many scenes, it could be finished within half a day if everything went well.

When they gathered in the photo studio, they introduced themselves to one another before they started to discuss the script.

Lu Xiao had sent the script to Gu Ning yesterday, and Gu Ning sent it to Su Tongnuo later. Su Tongnuo was a good actress, so it wasn’t difficult for her to finish the shots.

When it was 4 pm, the video ad was finished.

She was going to the capital tomorrow for business, so she decided to give these photos and the video ad to K in person. In addition, it was about time to arrange for K and Chen Cangyi to work for her.

When they walked out of the building of Tanghuang Entertainment, a young girl ran over with her face full of excitement. “Tongnuo, I’m your loyal fan! Could you please take photos with me?”

“Sure.” Su Tongnuo agreed. In fact, she really appreciated what her fans, especially those loyal fans, had done for her.

“Thanks! I’ve argued with those haters on the Internet to defend you,” the young girl said with pride.

“Oh, thank you so much!” Su Tongnuo said kindly. “Let’s take photos together now.”

“Great!” The young girl opened the camera on her phone and took several selfies with Su Tongnuo. Afterwards, she stared at Gu Ning with anticipation. “Um, would you mind taking several pictures with me too? You’re my idol as well!”

Gu Ning was amused. She wasn’t a star after all.

“No problem.” Gu Ning didn’t reject.

After taking photos with Gu Ning, the young girl left happily. Once she walked away, she posted her photos with Su Tongnuo and Gu Ning on Weibo without delay.

“I’ve been waiting for a whole day outside of Tanghuang Entertainment, and I met two goddesses! They’re so kind, and we took several selfies together! Love!”
