3312 I Can Be Your Guide

Li Mochen couldn’t fall asleep and could see the window of the master bedroom on Leng Xiaoyao’s side from his room. He watched as the light remained on.

He rarely smoked, but took out a cigarette this time, lost in thought.

Li Mochen didn’t go to bed until the light turned off in Leng Xiaoyao’s room.

…

Leng Xiaoyao got up at 6:20 am, tidied up, and was ready to leave.

By the time she reached the door, Li Mochen was already there.

“Good morning!” Leng Xiaoyao greeted him with a smile.

“Morning.” Li Mochen responded.

They then went for a run together.

They met many people who were also out for a morning run. All of whom were drawn to the handsome and beautiful pair of Li Mochen and Leng Xiaoyao.

An old man even approached them and asked about their relationship.

When he found out they were just friends without partners, he eagerly tried to introduce them to some potential suitors.

People who could live in Hanlin Manor weren’t ordinary. The Shen family alone had at least over a hundred million yuan in assets. Even if they were senior officials, without anyone in the family doing business and earning big money, one couldn’t afford a house here. After all, the villas in Hanlin Manor started at around thirty to forty million yuan.

Therefore, it wasn’t bad that this old man came to introduce potential partners to Li Mochen and Leng Xiaoyao.

However, Li Mochen and Leng Xiaoyao politely declined, not because they were picky, but because they didn’t need it.

The old man was disappointed by their rejection. He worried about his grandchildren who were also successful, but had yet to find partners due to their focus on their careers.

“Elder Tang, haven’t you noticed it? Although they’re not in a romantic relationship, it’s obvious that they’re interested in each other and just haven’t made it official,” an old lady said to him after Li Mochen and Leng Xiaoyao had run off into the distance.

“Ah! Why didn’t I see it?” Elder Tang was surprised and confused as he hadn’t noticed it.

“Well, my intuition is rarely wrong.” the old lady replied, believing in her gut feeling.

“Tsk! Why does it sound so complicated? Fine, even if I do an introduction, they may not be interested in my grandchildren.” Elder Tang was a bit discouraged, not because he was belittling his own grandchildren, but because he felt that everyone living in Hanlin Manor might have a higher status than his family.

Although the Tang family had some influence in the capital city, it was only average.

People living in Hanlin Manor were all wealthy, but there were different levels of wealth. Some had assets worth tens of billions, hundreds of billions, or even trillions of yuan…

If Li Mochen and Leng Xiaoyao had hundreds of billions of assets, they wouldn’t be interested in his grandchildren with only tens of billions of assets!

It didn’t mean that they were snobbish or anything, but within high society, how many marriages were truly free!

…

After their morning run, the two went to have breakfast.

As a high-end villa area, Hanlin Manor wasn’t only good in terms of quality and landscape, it also needed convenience in daily life. Therefore, there were restaurants and supermarkets in the villa area, which was very convenient.

After having a good breakfast, the two went to the supermarket to buy things they needed for lunch.

Because Leng Xiaoyao was treating him to a meal, Li Mochen didn’t insist on paying for it. Instead, he helped carry the groceries back home as a gentleman.

After they got home with their groceries, Li Mochen went back to his house across the road. Because he had just finished running and was covered in sweat, he didn’t want Leng Xiaoyao to feel uncomfortable with his smell.

After Li Mochen left, Leng Xiaoyao went back to her room to take a shower and change clothes.

After getting cleaned up, she came down to the living room with her laptop and drawing board to work.

Li Mochen wanted to go over to Leng Xiaoyao’s place after his shower, but he felt that it was too early and didn’t want to be too eager.

However, he found that time passed by very slowly when he was alone.

He somehow wasn’t used to being alone. In the past, he loved being alone.

At 10 am, Li Mochen went over to Leng Xiaoyao’s place. At this time, she started cooking and even stewed some pork ribs.

“My cooking skills are not that great, but don’t be too critical!” Leng Xiaoyao said. She thought her cooking was passable, but she didn’t have the confidence for it to be good.

“I won’t,” Li Mochen said. Even if it wasn’t good, he wouldn’t criticize it. “Do you want to go somewhere after lunch? I can be your guide.”

“Aren’t you busy?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“Not busy,” said Li Mochen. As long as it wasn’t something he had to handle himself, he could arrange for Mu Yuan and Meng Fan to take care of it.

After thinking for a moment, Leng Xiaoyao said, “I found a few office buildings online that I need to visit in person. I’m planning on moving Xiaoyao Technology to the capital city since I’ll be based here from now on. If you’re not busy, can you be my driver?”

Leng Xiaoyao accepted his help because having Li Mochen with her was much more convenient than going alone. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“No problem.” Li Mochen agreed at once.

After cooking the meal, it was already 11:30 am, which was perfect timing.

Because it was only the two of them eating, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t make too much food. She made stewed pork ribs and two stir-fried dishes, which was enough for two.

“It’s delicious,” Li Mochen said after tasting the food.

It wasn’t just a polite compliment or perfunctory comment.

He could eat delicacies or simple food, but to him, there was no difference between them because they were just meant to fill his stomach.

However, after eating Leng Xiaoyao’s food, he felt something different. He felt a kind of emotion he had never experienced before – happiness and satisfaction.

He even wanted to eat more of Leng Xiaoyao’s food.

“Really?” Leng Xiaoyao asked uncertainly. Although she knew her cooking skills were average, she was still happy to receive Li Mochen’s approval.

“Yes, really,” Li Mochen said seriously.

“If it’s delicious, then eat more. After the National College Entrance Examination, when I come to the capital city, you can come over and eat with me,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Eating alone was boring, and having someone to eat with would stoke her appetite more.

“Sure.” Li Mochen agreed without hesitation. He couldn’t help feeling happy inside, regardless of whether it was just a courtesy. Even if Leng Xiaoyao didn’t invite him, he would still want to come over.

After finishing the meal, Li Mochen took the initiative to clean up, and Leng Xiaoyao didn’t argue with him.

After resting for a while, they left.

Because the office buildings Leng Xiaoyao wanted to see were all in the southern district and not far away, they arrived quickly.
