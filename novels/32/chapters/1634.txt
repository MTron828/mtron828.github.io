Chapter 1635: Compete for a Parking Space

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The news about the Tianying Gang was still a hot topic on the Internet, but it didn’t attract much more attention as time went by.

It was almost 5 pm when Gu Ning arrived at the capital.

She was alone today, so she dined outside. And because her car was parked at the parking lot of the airport, she drove by herself this time.

However, shortly after she came back, she encountered trouble.

Gu Ning wanted to have steak, so she went to a western restaurant.

Because the parking spaces were limited outside the restaurant, there was only one parking space left when Gu Ning went over. Right when she was about to back her car into the parking space, a middle-aged woman suddenly stood in her way and stopped her car from moving inside.

“Hey, this parking space is already occupied. Go somewhere else!” shouted the middle-aged woman to Gu Ning in a very unkind tone. Given Gu Ning’s temper, she was quite displeased.

If the middle-aged woman showed a good attitude towards her, she wouldn’t be mad. However, the middle-aged woman was rude and unkind.

Gu Ning opened the door car and got out of it. She walked to the middle-aged woman with a cold expression. “Ma’am, I don’t understand why this parking space is already occupied. I arrived here before you.”

There was a car stopped not far from them, and the middle-aged woman came out of it. The car was also a luxurious car and was worth about two million yuan. It was obvious that the middle-aged woman was rich, but it wouldn’t change the fact that she was acting like a barbarian.

This middle-aged woman probably planned to bully Gu Ning because she thought that Gu Ning’s car wasn’t as expensive as hers. However, not every super-rich person would drive a very luxurious car, because most super-rich people kept a low profile.

In addition, Gu Ning’s car wasn’t cheap at all; it was a Hummer which cost her over a million yuan. However, her car wasn’t as expensive as the middle-aged woman’s car.

Unfortunately, it was useless in Gu Ning’s eyes.

“I told you that it’s occupied, and you should go to park your car somewhere else!” The middle-aged woman was still very rude.

“Why don’t you go to park your car somewhere else?” Gu Ning was mad.

“Don’t you have any manners?” The middle-aged woman criticized Gu Ning.

Many people walked by them, and they heard the middle-aged woman’s loud voice.

“What? It’s ridiculous! You were rude to me first, so I don’t think I should be polite to you,” said Gu Ning. “If you showed a good attitude towards me, I’d let you take the parking space, but your terrible attitude has ruined everything.”

“You...” The middle-aged woman didn’t know what to say now.

Onlookers also looked at the middle-aged woman with disdain.

“She’s so shameless.”

“It’s obvious that this young girl arrived here before the woman.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“I agree.”

“...”

“Shut your mouth! Do you know who I am?” The middle-aged woman was angry from the humiliation. Nevertheless, before she could say something else, a female voice interrupted her. “Mom!”

After that, a young woman walked to the middle-aged woman. She then turned to look at Gu Ning. She wasn’t as arrogant or aggressive as the middle-aged woman, but was quite gentle. Unfortunately, Gu Ning still saw the jealousy in her eyes.

“Miss, I’m sorry. My mom has an appointment with her friend, and we’re already late. My mom just wants to see her friend as soon as possible,” said the young woman.

This young woman was actually Shen Zhilin, and the middle-aged woman was her mother, Chen Qiuyin.

Shen Zhilin knew that Leng Shaoting had a very beautiful girlfriend, but she didn’t know that the stunning girl standing in front of her right now was Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend. If she knew that, she wouldn’t be so calm.

“Even though you’re in a hurry, you can’t steal other people’s parking spaces,” said Gu Ning. Although Shen Zhilin had a good attitude, Gu Ning saw that she wasn’t a good person.

She must agree with her mother otherwise she wouldn’t come to help her mother. Besides, she apologized to Gu Ning simply because she noticed that the situation wasn’t to their advantage.

“You’re right, and please accept my sincere apologies. Miss, please forgive us this time,” said Shen Zhilin. In fact, she was full of anger and hatred towards Gu Ning at this moment, but she had to pretend to be nice. After all, it was their fault. Most importantly, they were in a public place.

“Zhilin.” Chen Qiuyin was dissatisfied with Shen Zhilin’s behavior. She didn’t think that they needed to apologize.

“Fine, forget it,” said Gu Ning. She was unwilling to waste time arguing with them.

After that, Shen Zhilin pulled Chen Qiuyin away, and left the parking space to Gu Ning.

Gu Ning then got in her car and backed it into the parking space.

“Zhilin, how could you give the parking space to her,” said Chen Qiuyin in annoyance.

Shen Zhilin was displeased. “Mom, you should change your personality towards other people. Didn’t you see everyone was blaming you? It’s super embarrassing! Don’t make us a joke in public.”
