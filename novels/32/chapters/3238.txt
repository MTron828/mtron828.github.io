3240 Follow Us If You Don’t Know the Direction

After the yacht Leng Xiaoyao and the others sailed in stopped by the shore, they didn’t get out at once. Instead, they waited till Leng Xiaoyao finished drawing the talismans.

Dai Ya and Lin Musi saw them ahead and thought that they were waiting for them.

However, this place was really creepy and strange. Once they got close, they felt a cold wind and shivered.

Luckily, there were more people with them, otherwise they would have given up right after they came.

“This place is so strange. Do we have to go inside?” asked Lin Musi, hesitating.

“If you don’t want to go, you can wait in the yacht,” Dai Ya said. Although she was a little scared too, she was already here and there were other people with her, so she wasn’t too frightened.

“I don’t want to be alone!” Lin Musi refused at once. She would rather go inside along with the others than to be left alone. At least she would feel safe with a group of people.

Right after Dai Ya and Lin Musi arrived, Leng Xiaoyao finished three talismans. She gave them to Mu Yiyang, Mu Yuan, and Meng Fan. Li Mochen was no longer an ordinary person, so average monsters and ghosts couldn’t hurt him.

Even though Li Mochen was only in the early stage of cultivation, the power in his body was waiting to explode. Once he could make full use of the power, he would be even stronger than Leng Xiaoyao.

“Shouldn’t Mochen have one too?” Mu Yiyang asked confusedly. Mu Yuan and Meng Fan also turned to look at Leng Xiaoyao with confusion. Although they understood that she must have done that for a reason, they still wanted to know why.

“I don’t need it,” Li Mochen said.

“Brother Mochen is different from you.” Leng Xiaoyao put on a mysterious smile, but she didn’t elaborate.

Anyway, since she said that, it should be unnecessary for Li Mochen. “Is Mochen like you now?” Mu Yiyang asked curiously.

“Yes, but it’s a secret for now,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Mu Yiyang and the others were surprised. Were Li Mochen and Leng Xiaoyao really so different from them?

Compared with Mu Yiyang, Mu Yuan and Meng Fan were less surprised, because they were aware of the secret.

Nevertheless, no matter how curious Mu Yiyang and the others were, they didn’t ask about it since Leng Xiaoyao said it was a secret.

After that, they got off the yacht.

Dai Ya and Lin Musi walked towards them.

“Hi, my name is Lin Musi. May I know your names?” Lin Musi introduced herself politely, but she focused on Li Mochen the entire time.

Honestly, Li Mochen and the others didn’t care about their attitude at all.

Li Mochen didn’t give Lin Musi a glance. Mu Yiyang said nothing either. Only Mu Yuan replied. “We’re just strangers. I don’t think it’s necessary to know one another’s name.”

Lin Musi was displeased because they embarrassed her so openly.

Although it was Mu Yuan’s reply, Li Mochen’s attitude showed that he had no interest in her. As a result, Lin Musi was extremely embarrassed.

Seeing that, Dai Ya immediately snapped at Lin Musi in case she said something unacceptable. “Musi, come here.”

Although Dai Ya didn’t want to lecture Lin Musi, she still reminded Lin Musi to behave. However, if Lin Musi still refused to listen, she wouldn’t bother to stop her again.

Lin Musi was reluctant to accept the result, but she still walked towards Dai Ya.

“Sorry, we won’t bother you again,” Dai Ya said. She wasn’t displeased. After all, they were strangers, so they had no duty to treat them well.

Leng Xiaoyao and the others said nothing. They directly turned around and walked onto the island, followed by Dai Ya and Lin Musi.

The island was covered in rocks and dense forests, so the roads were very rugged. Leng Xiaoyao and the others walked slowly all the way. In fact, there was no need to rush, and they were observing while walking.

The Island of Bones wasn’t very large. According to the data, it was about 1.5 kilometers long and seven to eight hundred meters wide, so Leng Xiaoyao’s magical senses could cover one-third of it at a time. She could also feel where the strongest evil power was.

Without delay, Leng Xiaoyao led them to the place with the strongest evil power.

Lin Musi was a little displeased when Leng Xiaoyao walked in front of them, but she said nothing after thinking for a while.

Due to the strong evil power on the Island of Bones, there were many snakes, rats, and other small poisonous animals.

Luckily, Leng Xiaoyao and the others had good eyesight, so they easily noticed the poisonous snakes and insects and forced them to stay away.

Dai Ya and Lin Musi didn’t have that ability. As a result, they touched the poisonous snakes and insects every once in a while. Fortunately, they weren’t weak, so they quickly got rid of them.

“These things are disgusting!” Lin Musi was angry and disgusted.

Even if she had been through a tough time before when she learned kung fu, she had never been in such a disgusting environment. Therefore, she regretted coming here.

“Tolerate it even though you’re disgusted. And be more careful. Don’t be injured by them,” Dai Ya warned. Although she felt it was disgusting too, she decided to face it since she was already here.

Left with no choice, Lin Musi had to tolerate it.

Walking ahead, they didn’t only see snakes and rats, they also saw many skeletons. It was so scary that Lin Musi vomited.

“Dai Ya, I think we should leave! I can’t stand it any longer.” Lin Musi couldn’t tolerate it and wanted to leave.

Dai Ya frowned. “Do you know the direction?”

“I…” Lin Musi was struck dumb for a second. She had no idea where they should go. Without a guide, she wouldn’t be able to leave.

Because no one had visited this island for many years, there was no road. Besides, there was white mist all over the island, so they could only see things four meters around them. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“If you don’t know the direction, just follow them. If we go back alone and get lost, we will be in trouble,” Dai Ya said coldly. She didn’t remember the route. Even if she did, she didn’t dare to return with Lin Musi.

Without Leng Xiaoyao and the others, she wouldn’t have even dared to come here.

“Do you believe she knows the way?” Lin Musi argued. She was talking about Leng Xiaoyao.

If another person was their guide, she would say nothing. Unfortunately, it was Leng Xiaoyao.

There were so many men with them. Why should a girl do that job?

Why did these men allow her to?

Lin Musi thought that Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t a good person and was convinced that she was cheating these men.

She was too good at making up rumors and held a strong bias against Leng Xiaoyao.
