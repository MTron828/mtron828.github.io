3048 Who Humiliates the Leng Family?

What was most frightening was how close the Leng family’s car had been to the exploded car.

Before long, Leng Yehua and Song Meiyu saw Leng Yuqi, and immediately walked towards her.

Leng Yuqi didn’t see them until Song Meiyu called her when they reached her side.

“Yuqi, are you alright?” Song Meiyu pulled Leng Yuqi’s hands and checked her from head to toe to see whether she was injured.

!!

“Mom!” Leng Yuqi burst into tears. There was no one she could rely on before her parents came, so she had to tolerate it, but as soon as she saw her parents, she was relaxed and cried in Song Meiyu’s arms.

“Alright, alright, dad and mom are here. Don’t cry, my daughter.” Song Meiyu comforted her at once.

“Where is Leng Xiaoyao?” Leng Yehua asked. He disliked Leng Xiaoyao, but he ought to care about her in such a situation.

“I don’t know,” Leng Yuqi said.

“Get into the car with Yuqi. I need to see Liu,” Leng Yehua said.

“Sure,” Song Meiyu replied, then she went back to the car with Leng Yuqi. Leng Yehua walked to see Liu and told him that they would take Leng Yuqi back home first.

At the same time, Leng Yehua also asked where Leng Xiaoyao was now. Uncle Liu told him that Leng Xiaoyao left to deal with something.

She left to deal with something? It was late at night. She was a young girl. What did she need to deal with?

Leng Yehua was instantly angry and immediately criticized Uncle Liu. “It’s late now. Why did you allow a young girl to leave alone? Why didn’t you stop her? What if she does something wrong and humiliates the Leng family?”

Leng Yehua didn’t care about Leng Xiaoyao’s safety, just her behavior.

Honestly, he didn’t care about what Leng Xiaoyao did either, he simply wanted to defame her.

Uncle Liu was displeased, not because Leng Yehua shouted at him, but because Leng Yehua defamed Leng Xiaoyao.

“Mr. Yehua, I don’t think Miss Xiaoyao will humiliate the Leng family.” Uncle Liu defended Leng Xiaoyao. In fact, Leng Xiaoyao had humiliated the Leng family many times before, but she was completely different now.

“She won’t? Isn’t she humiliating the Leng family all the time?” Leng Yehua was even angrier since Uncle Liu defended Leng Xiaoyao.

“I believe what Miss Yuxi has done humiliated the Leng family much more than Miss Xiaoyao’s deeds,” Uncle Liu said, implying that Leng Yuqi had stolen Leng Xiaoyao’s fiancé, which was totally unacceptable. If the news went abroad, the Leng family would be extremely humiliated.

“You…” Leng Yehua didn’t know what to say. Because he felt guilty, he didn’t continue to talk about it. He snorted, then turned around and left. He didn’t ask further about what Leng Xiaoyao had left to do.

He really hoped that Leng Xiaoyao would do something to humiliate the Leng family, so that Master Leng would hate her.

Moreover, Uncle Liu, Liu Songming, was only a chauffeur. How could a chauffeur talk to him like that? It was annoying.

“Where is Leng Xiaoyao?” Song Meiyu asked. She didn’t care about Leng Xiaoyao, but she wanted to know what Leng Xiaoyao went to do so late at night.

“Who the hell knows!” Leng Yehua answered in annoyance.

Seeing that Leng Yehua was so mad, Song Meiyu was confused, but didn’t dare to ask about it.

At that moment, Leng Yuqi was reluctant to mention Leng Xiaoyao, because she didn’t want people to know that Leng Xiaoyao had rescued people from the flames.

However, it was impossible to keep it a secret, because those who had taken a video of that scene had posted it on the Internet.

If only a few people did that, the news might not get much attention, but there were too many people doing it, so it quickly went viral.

In addition, people loved to read news about heroes, so Leng Xiaoyao received countless compliments ten minutes later.

Li Mochen was also praised.

People were especially amazed when Leng Xiaoyao removed the car doors with her hands.

Leng Xiaoyao paid little attention to them and kept on watching the surveillance videos.

There was nothing strange along the road until she saw the restaurant in which Lu Changwei dined.

Something happened in the parking lot of that restaurant.

The story was that Lu Changwei and his chauffeur went to dine with his colleagues at that restaurant at 6:30 pm. They chatted during the meal, so they didn’t separate until 9:05 pm.

At 8:30 pm, a man in black with a baseball cap and mask walked into the parking lot and stopped before Lu Changwei’s car.

After seeing that there was no one around, the man lay down under the car, then left a few minutes later.

It was obvious that he was setting a bomb next to the oil tank.

In that case, once the bomb exploded, the oil tank would break and the car would burn faster. It seemed that the man’s aim was to kill Lu Changwei.

Coincidentally, Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen showed up halfway and rescued them, but the credit should go to Leng Xiaoyao.

Although they were still alive when they were moved out of the car, without Leng Xiaoyao’s magical energy, they wouldn’t have survived. After all, the explosion was very powerful.

After Leng Xiaoyao saw the man who set the bomb, she began to collect his information.

About ten minutes later, she learned that the man was called Jin Dawu. He was a wanted criminal. He was previously arrested, but he successfully escaped from jail half a month ago.

Shortly after Jin Dawu escaped from jail, he targeted Lu Changwei. There must be grudges between them, because he tried to kill Lu Changwei right after escaping from jail.

Otherwise there must be a mastermind who used Jin Dawu as a pawn. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

If so, it must have been planned that Jin Dawu would escape from jail.

As for the truth, Leng Xiaoyao still needed time to find out, but she already had information about Lu Changwei and his chauffeur, so she could stop for the time being.

Even though she wasn’t sure whether Lu Changwei was a good man, she would investigate to the end since she was already involved.
