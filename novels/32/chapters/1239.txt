Chapter 1242 It Indeed Is a Scheme

“What should we do now? What do they want to do? Will Zhengyu be in danger?” An Qian asked with anxiety.“Relax, I can protect myself well, and I’ll find out the truth as soon as possible. You don’t need to worry about me.” Le Zhengyu comforted her at once.

“How can I not be worried? We have no idea what they’re planning to do right now,” An Qian said. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Zhengyu, how’s your relationship with the director, and how’s the Manager Qian’s relationship with him?” Gu Ning asked.

She thought Manager Qian and the director might be scheming together against Le Zhengyu.

“You know we’re all good actors in business and nobody knows other people’s real thoughts. We seem to get along well with each other at work, but I do have bitter conflicts with Manager Qian,” Le Zhengyu replied.

“If so, we need to investigate it. Zhengyu, if you don’t mind, you can tell me the basic information about Manager Qian and the director. I’ll call you once I find out anything about their real relationship. If it has something to do with Zhu Yinyin or her boss, I’ll give the evidence of their affair to you as well,” Gu Ning said.

Since Le Zhengyu said that he failed to find out the truth within a short time, it meant that it wasn’t easy for him to find out.

However, they must find out the truth as soon as possible in case Le Zhengyu’s enemies trapped him.

“That’ll be much better. Thank you, Miss Gu!” Le Zhengyu was cheered up, because he could only rely on Gu Ning to help him.

Since Gu Ning was able to find out Zhu Yinyin’s dirty secret, it wouldn’t be difficult for her to find out the director’s real relationship with Manager Qian.

After that, Le Zhengyu told Gu Ning their basic information before Gu Ning left.

It was an emergency, so Gu Ning called K when she was driving home, and told him to help her deal with this problem. In order to find out the truth as soon as possible, Gu Ning briefly told K what had happened.

It was very late at night, and Gu Ning arrived at Fenghua Luxury Mansion after a dozen minutes.

When she got home, she took a bath and dried her hair before she went to lie down on her bed, but she didn’t sleep right away. She was waiting for the result from K’s investigation.

Normally, K could finish the job she gave him within an hour if she wanted him to help her find out some information, and it would take him less time if the work wasn’t difficult.

After a few minutes, Gu Ning received K’s call and K sent her an email.

Gu Ning checked her emails at once, and got what she wanted.

The director indeed...

K found an important document in the director’s email box, and it said that the company made a decision to transfer the director to another affiliated company in another city and Le Zhengyu would replace the director in City F.

Although this director had received this email, the company hadn’t made the announcement yet, so no one else was aware of it.

Something happened later, and the project which should have been Manager Qian’s work suddenly fell into Le Zhengyu’s hands. Besides, the director frequently contacted Manager Qian and Zhu Yinyin these days.

Even though Gu Ning still didn’t know the specific reason why the director did it, she had enough evidence to figure out the truth.

It was obvious that the director had an agreement with Manager Qian to cause Le Zhengyu trouble at this time so that Le Zhengyu wouldn’t be smoothly promoted. In that case, Manager Qian could replace him.

Without delay, Gu Ning called Le Zhengyu.

Le Zhengyu couldn’t sleep after knowing that it could be a scheme behind his back. Therefore, when Gu Ning called him, he picked it up right away.

“Hi, Miss Gu, have you found anything?” he asked in a hurry.

“Yeah, and it turns out to be a scheme, which isn’t a surprise,” Gu Ning said. “Your director just received an email saying that he’ll be transferred to another city and you will replace him, but the official announcement won’t be made until a few days later, so the director is working with Manager Qian to cause you trouble. They don’t want you to become the director.”

“What?” Le Zhengyu was greatly surprised. He couldn’t believe that the director refused to tell him this news and even worked with Manager Qian against him behind his back.

“Give me your email account, and I’ll send what I’ve found out to you. If you still need my help in the following days, feel free to let me know,” Gu Ning said.

She was going to leave it to Le Zhengyu, but she was still willing to help him if he needed her help.

Since Le Zhengyu could become the director of a very famous company at such an young age, he had the ability to handle a crisis well.

Gu Ning had K’s help, so she was able to find out the document before Le Zhengyu.
