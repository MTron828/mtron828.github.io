Chapter 1858: Oh, I’m Scared!

Even though Chu Peihan said that Ke Lili had caused her trouble first, Mrs. Ke didn’t care about it at all, because she didn’t think there was anything wrong with it.

In her eyes, her daughter was superior to other people. Only her daughter could bully others and she would never allow other people to bully her daughter.

Gu Ning and her other friends stood still, because they knew that Mrs. Ke couldn’t hurt Chu Peihan.

Ke Yongqiang didn’t stop his wife from doing that, because he agreed that Chu Peihan needed to learn a lesson after bullying his daughter. However, he was a grown-up man after all, so he let his wife do the job.

Ke Lili smiled with satisfaction. She waited to see Chu Peihan being humiliated by her family.

Unfortunately, right as Mrs. Ke’s hand fell, Chu Peihan raised her hand and caught her wrist.

“You...” Mrs. Ke rounded her eyes in shock. To her surprise, Chu Peihan caught her wrist so fast.

Mrs. Ke was too arrogant to believe that it really happened.

After being caught, Mrs. Ke struggled, trying to get rid of Chu Peihan, but only found that Chu Peihan was much stronger than her. She wasn’t able to move at all and felt great pain once Chu Peihan used greater strength.

“Chu Peihan, let my mom go!” Ke Lili criticized Chu Peihan at once. Because she had been caught by Chu Peihan like that before, she wasn’t surprised to see her mother caught, but she was angry.

“Let her go!” Ke Yongqiang was also quite displeased.

“Sure!” said Chu Peihan with an evil smile on her lips. She let Mrs. Ke go, but she actually threw her away with a lot of strength without hitting the people behind her. As a result, Mrs. Ke heavily fell to the ground.

“Mom!”

“Juan!”

Seeing that, Ke Lili, Ke Yongqiang, and the couple with them were all scared. They tried to support Mrs. Ke, but it was too late. Therefore, they could only watch her fall.

With a loud sound, Mrs. Ke felt the pain all over her body.

“Mom!”

“Juan!”

They immediately rushed to help Mrs. Ke get back to her feet and checked whether she was injured.

The noises soon attracted the hotel manager over.

“May I know what’s going on here?” asked the hotel manager.

“What’s going on here? This girl just attacked my wife in public!” Ke Yongqiang roared pointing at Chu Peihan. “I didn’t expect to see such a violent student like you in the film academy. I’m going to tell your dean. If you can’t learn a lesson from your behavior, you won’t behave yourself in the future!”

In fact, Ke Yongqiang wanted to beat Chu Peihan, but felt too embarrassed to do so. He was a grown-up man after all and cared about his image.

However, Ke Yongqiang totally forgot that his wife had tried to slap Chu Peihan first, so he was merely a selfish person too.

“Oh, Mr. Ke, I bet you must have forgotten that it’s your wife who tried to slap me first. Should I stand still waiting to be slapped? By the way, Ke Lili also tried to attack me first. If I hadn’t learned some fighting skills, I would have been injured by her. I was just defending myself, but you believe it’s violence. Don’t you think it’s unfair that you indulge your wife and daughter to attack other people? One may steal a horse while another may not look over a hedge, right? Well, I don’t think you have such great authority to do so,” said Chu Peihan mockingly, showing no fear of Ke Yongqiang.

“You...” Ke Yongqiang didn’t know what to say all of a sudden. Although he was reluctant to admit it, Chu Peihan indeed told the truth. Both his wife and daughter had tried to attack Chu Peihan first, so they were injured afterwards.

Anyway, his wife and daughter were injured in the end, so it was impossible for him not to be angry.

“No matter what, we were injured in the end, so it’s your fault!” Ke Lili blamed Chu Peihan for everything. She didn’t care about whose fault it was right now, because they were the ones who were injured. “Dad, you must do something for mom and I!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“You’re so shameless,” said Chu Peihan with disdain.

“Right, no matter what, my wife and daughter are injured in the end, so you must apologize to them. I can forgive you then,” said Ke Yongqiang. Because his wife and daughter hadn’t done the right thing and they were in Shengshi Hotel with many important figures around, they were unwilling to be watched by other people.

“Apologize? Ridiculous. It isn’t my fault. Why should I apologize?” said Chu Peihan.

“You...” Ke Yongqiang was mad. To his surprise, this girl was so determined. He squinted and said in a threatening tone, “If you don’t apologize, I’ll tell your dean to expel you.”

“Oh, really? I’m scared.” Chu Peihan suddenly acted scared, but she actually wasn’t scared at all. “Do it now! Tell the dean to expel me!”

It wasn’t her fault anyway, so she wouldn’t be afraid.

Even if the dean really agreed with Ke Yongqiang on that, he might not be able to expel her.

“You...” Ke Yongqiang was furious. He didn’t expect that Chu Peihan wasn’t afraid of being expelled at all, which made him think that she might come from a powerful family.

Thinking of that, Ke Yongqiang stopped arguing. He had to figure out Chu Peihan’s family background first.

“Great, very well, let’s wait and see! Let’s go!” Ke Yongqiang threatened Chu Peihan in the end to save his face.

“Dad...” Ke Lili was unwilling to leave like that, but she shut her mouth once her father gave her a warning glance.

“Yongqiang...” Mrs. Ke was also reluctant to accept this result. She was heavily thrown to the ground today and was utterly humiliated, which was totally unacceptable in her eyes.

“Let’s go home now,” said Ke Yongqiang in annoyance.

Mrs. Ke didn’t want to go, but she could only give Chu Peihan a glare before walking away with Ke Yongqiang.

After the Ke family was gone, Chu Peihan turned to stare at Gu Ning looking pitiful. “Boss, if I’m really going to be expelled, you must help me.”

At this moment, she didn’t look as aggressive as earlier at all.

Chu Peihan could handle it on her own, but she was unwilling to drag the Qing Gang into this trouble.

Gu Ning was amused. “Don’t worry, you won’t be expelled.”

Hearing that, Chu Peihan smiled relaxedly, holding Gu Ning’s arm. “You’re the best!”
