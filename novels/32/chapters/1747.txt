Chapter 1749: Can’t Live Long

“The medicine that can help your limbs recover. You need to sign your name!” said Gu Ning.

Hearing that, Tang Bingsen felt relieved. He believed her words, because she indeed needed him to sign his name.

Within half a minute, he began to feel the change of his body. His limbs weren’t so stiff and he was able to move his hands now, but there was still a big difference from his previous condition. Anyway, he had no problem writing.

“You promise to let me go once I sign the contract, right?” asked Tang Bingsen. Although he knew he couldn’t resist at all if “Tang Aining” regretted it, he still wanted to make sure that he wouldn’t be hurt. He was pushing his luck.

“Of course, I will keep my promise,” said Gu Ning with certainty. Actually, she had no intention to kill Tang Bingsen, she simply wanted to torture him.

Afterwards, Gu Ning took out the contract and let Tang Bingsen sign his name.

Tang Bingsen didn’t bother to read the contract and signed his name without hesitation. Anyway, he lost the company now, and it was meaningless to read the contract.

When Tang Bingsen signed his name, Gu Ning took a video of him without him knowing, in case he regretted it in the future. She had to keep the video as evidence.

In fact, as long as he signed the contract on his own, it would be no use regretting it. Gu Ning simply kept the evidence to avoid unnecessary trouble.

After he signed the contract in duplicate, Gu Ning took it with satisfaction, then left.

Tang Bingsen could only watch Gu Ning’s leaving back. He was angry and unwilling to accept the result, but he could do nothing about it. Gu Ning didn’t want his property, she just wanted his shares of the Tang Organization, so he wasn’t penniless.

When Gu Ning went back to the living room, she untied Tang Bingsen’s secretary and security guards. Although they were free now, their bodies were very weak and couldn’t fight against Gu Ning. Therefore, they did nothing and watched her walking away.

Once she was gone, they walked into the ward to check Tang Bingsen’s condition.

They were relieved after they found that Tang Bingsen was fine.

Because they heard Gu Ning’s conversation with Tang Bingsen from outside, they knew what had happened, and were just worried that he might be hurt. Since he wasn’t injured, they asked nothing.

The two mercenaries were hired by Tang Bingsen. If Tang Bingsen were still killed under their protection, their reputation would be ruined and it would affect their career. As for the secretary, he was absent today, so he would be affected too if Tang Bingsen was hurt.

Right at this moment, Tang Bingsen abruptly spat out a mouthful of blood before he passed out. His secretary rang the bell at once to call the doctor.

...

Gu Ning sent Tang Qingyang a message after she left the hospital. She told him that she succeeded and would give him the contract tomorrow.

She knew that Tang Qingyang couldn’t sleep after he learned that she went to meet Tang Bingsen, because it had a greater effect on him than it did on her.

Tang Qingyang stayed awake the entire time, waiting for Gu Ning’s message. As time went by, he became more and more anxious. It wasn’t because he didn’t believe in Gu Ning. He believed that she would be successful once she took action, but he couldn’t sleep until he heard the result.

When he saw Gu Ning’s message, Tang Qingyang almost jumped up in excitement. She succeeded! They really succeeded!

There were no accidents, just countless surprises. He was fated to stay awake during this night, and couldn’t fall asleep because he was too excited.

What made him most excited wasn’t this windfall, but the result Tang Bingsen had.

Tang Bingsen might have a breakdown after losing the Tang Organization, which was what Tang Qingyang looked forward to seeing. He wouldn’t mind if he couldn’t see it, it was enough that he knew that Tang Bingsen was having a hard time.

All of a sudden, Tang Qingyang’s excitement was replaced by upset. He got up from the bed and went to the study, then he took out an album from the drawer and opened it. The first photo was a family photo of three, but only he was alive now.

“Dad, although I didn’t take revenge with my own hands, someone did it for me. I’ll soon take over Tang Bingsen’s company, and he’s having a very hard time now.”

“I can’t kill him, but I don’t think he can live long!”

When Gu Ning was back in Mountain River Garden, it was nearly 1 am. She got home so quickly because it was very late and there was a little traffic on the road.

Normally, she had to spend 40 minutes on the road, but she came back in 20 minutes tonight. She didn’t want to keep Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao waiting for her, so she sped up along the way.

At this time, Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao were still awake. Because they were cultivators, they wouldn’t feel tired even if they didn’t have sleep for days. Sometimes, cultivators spent months on cultivation and only slept for a few days. They would feel more energetic when the energy moved around in their bodies, and would only feel tired when the cultivation was over.

Although Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao were waiting for Gu Ning to come back, they didn’t sit there and do nothing. Instead, they were practicing kung fu skills in the backyard.

It was very late, but they were in a big house. There were many green plants between houses, so nobody would hear them.

When Gu Ning’s car just drove into the front yard of their house, Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao felt it. They stopped at once and went back to the living room.

Gu Ning parked the car and walked to the door, but the door opened before she touched it and Leng Shaoting showed his face.

Gu Ning felt guilty when she saw that Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao were still waiting for her.

“I’m so sorry to keep you waiting. I was busy doing something else.” Gu Ning apologized. Even though she knew that Jing Yunyao wouldn’t be annoyed, she should show her attitude and couldn’t forget her manners.

Actually, she apologized not to show her manners, but because she really felt guilty.

“It’s fine,” said Jing Yunyao. She didn’t want Gu Ning to feel guilty, so she explained. “We’re cultivators, so we will be fine even if we don’t sleep for half a month. In addition, we didn’t sit there and do nothing. We were actually practicing kung fu skills in the backyard. Shaoting is always busy, so we seized the night to practice.”

If Gu Ning was an ordinary, weak girl, Jing Yunyao might be worried about her safety, but Gu Ning wasn’t. Moreover, what Gu Ning did was very important. There were some things better done at night.
