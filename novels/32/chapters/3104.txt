3105 You’re Popular

“Um, I don’t know. Let me try it!” said Leng Xiaoyao, taking out her phone. After thinking for a while, she typed down: A girl cut out violet jade and the confederate rose jade from two half-cut raw jade materials in City Chang.

The next moment, there were results. The titles of the articles were basically the same as what Leng Xiaoyao had typed down. There were only a few different words.

However, it had gone viral much faster than Leng Xiaoyao had expected. It already became a piece of hot news and aroused people’s jealousy.

After that, Leng Xiaoyao showed them the news. There were photos of Leng Xiaoyao as well, but not many people knew it was Leng Xiaoyao, because only a few had seen her with make-up.

!!

This time, they had to believe it.

“Xiaoyao, you’re popular now. I think you shouldn’t wear make-up next time you go out. It won’t do you good if bad people recognize you,” Mu Yiyang said with concern.

“Right! A person’s talent will arouse the envy of others. If other people know about your skills, some of them might have bad intentions.” Si Yiqi chimed in.

“Don’t worry, I normally don’t wear make-up. Even if I run into bad people, I can protect myself too,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Although she wasn’t worried, she was touched by their kindness.

Suddenly, they remembered that Leng Xiaoyao was very good at martial arts. “You’re right. You’re so good at kung fu. I don’t think anyone can hurt you, but you can never be too careful. So you better be cautious,” Mu Yiyang said.

Whether Leng Xiaoyao had the ability to protect herself or not, it showed that they cared about her.

Lu Ke was even more impressed by Leng Xiaoyao now. This girl was extraordinary! She was excellent at stone gambling and martial arts. In addition, both Mu Yiyang and Si Yiqi admired her, so she must have other skills he didn’t know about.

Therefore, Lu Ke didn’t dare to look down on Leng Xiaoyao.

“We’ll tell you before we set off. We can get to the airport at the same time, then go there together,” Mu Yiyang said.

“No problem,” Leng Xiaoyao replied.

“Don’t worry, Mochen and I will be in City Chang. We’ll make the arrangement,” Si Yiqi said.

Just like that, it was done.

“Xiaoyao, since you’re so good at stone gambling, why don’t you help me with it at that time?” Mu Yiyang said with anticipation.

Although he wanted to try, he clearly knew it was impossible for him to cut out jade unless he had extremely good luck.

“No problem, I’ll pick several for each of you, but I can’t promise that there is jade in them. I know a bit about raw jade materials and I have good luck, but I can’t see what’s inside. I can’t be sure whether there is jade,” Leng Xiaoyao warned. Although she could tell whether there was jade, she decided to keep a low profile.

“Of course, no one can be sure of that,” Mu Yiyang said. Although he said he needed Leng Xiaoyao’s help, he wouldn’t solely rely on her to cut out jade. He still hoped that he would have good luck too.

“Thanks, Miss Leng,” Si Yiqi said. He also wanted to have a try. Perhaps there would be jade in the raw jade materials Leng Xiaoyao chose for them.

Li Mochen couldn’t stand it when Leng Xiaoyao chatted happily with Mu Yiyang and Si Yiqi. He somehow felt unhappy, so he changed the topic and interrupted them. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

No matter what they were talking about, Leng Xiaoyao could join them. It seemed that there was nothing she didn’t know. For example, Li Mochen mentioned a crime, and Leng Xiaoyao gave a detailed analysis as if she was a professional detective.

To be specific, she seemed to be better than a professional detective, because she could analyze the crime from the beginning to the end.

“Xiaoyao, how could you be so accurate? People might think you’re involved in the crime.” Mu Yiyang admired Leng Xiaoyao more than ever and felt slightly hurt. They just introduced half of the crime, but Leng Xiaoyao already had a conclusion.

“Is it difficult? That’s just my analysis, not the final result!” Leng Xiaoyao said. Her analysis wasn’t the result, and could only be used as a reference.

However, if they wanted to know the result, they needed to analyze it.

“But your analysis is the final result,” Mu Yiyang said. He felt hit when Leng Xiaoyao said it wasn’t difficult.

“Well, that can only prove that my analysis is right. An analysis isn’t the result, but it’s necessary in order to get a result,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Miss Leng, can you tell me what you do?” Lu Ke finally asked Leng Xiaoyao for her background.

“I’m a senior high school student, but I’ll soon work in the same industry as Executive Lu, because I just took over a technology company. Since we’re all Brother Mochen’s friends, I hope we can compete openly at that time,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

She was willing to compete fairly. Since Li Mochen had a relationship with Yufeng Technology, she didn’t want to play tricks.

A senior high school student?

Lu Ke was shocked.

Although Leng Xiaoyao looked young, he thought she was over twenty years old. However, she was much younger, although she behaved much more maturely than her age.

To his astonishment, she was a senior high school student. In that case, she just turned eighteen years old.

Leng Xiaoyao said that she just bought a technology company, which meant she was going to join the technology industry.

This time, Leng Xiaoyao told them her other ability and surprised them once more.

However, Li Mochen already knew about it and was also aware of Leng Xiaoyao’s hacking skills.

“Miss Leng, don’t worry, even if we’re not Mochen’s friends, Yufeng won’t compete unfairly, but if anyone dares to play tricks against us, we won’t hesitate to fight back,” Lu Ke said.

Yufeng was a very large company with outstanding services and a good reputation.
