Chapter 2832: No Need to Elaborate

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Although the man who went on a blind date with Xia Maiqi didn’t fall in love with Zi Beiying, maybe it was because he knew he didn’t deserve her, his friend started liking Zi Beiying.

His friend wouldn’t stop talking with Zi Beiying and repeatedly asked for her number and WeChat account, but Zi Beiying declined.

Even though Zi Beiying deliberately implied that she already had a boyfriend, his friend wouldn’t give up.

It displeased Zi Beiying, Mengda, Nan, and even Xia Maiqi, but they said nothing because his friend didn’t do anything offensive.

Because the blind date was arranged by Xia Maiqi’s boss and the man was very gentle, Zi Beiying couldn’t embarrass them and leave.

The man was a gentleman, but Xia Maiqi already had someone she loved, so she had no interest in him.

Why did she come out for a blind date when she already found her love? Because she didn’t want to upset her boss and because the man she loved had affection for another woman. It was unrequited love, so it wasn’t wrong if she went out to see other men.

“Miss Zi, it was very nice to see you today.” Man B, who was interested in Zi Beiying, wanted to drink with her once more. He already did that many times, but he kept on making up excuses to drink with Zi Beiying.

Luckily, Zi Beiying was good at drinking, otherwise she would already be drunk.

Man B wanted to be close to Zi Beiying, but there were people sitting beside her on both sides, namely Mengda and Nan. The two bodyguards had serious expressions, so Man B didn’t dare to go closer.

Man B clinked glasses with Zi Beiying, so she had to drink with him. After all, it wasn’t too much.

In addition, Xu Jinchen was coming. Anyway they wouldn’t stay too late even if Xu Jinchen didn’t come. They would leave before 11 pm.

…

Due to the short distance, Xu Jinchen arrived about ten minutes later.

“Miss Zi, you can drink a lot,” said Man B.

“Yeah,” said Zi Beiying in a flat tone.

“I wonder what your boyfriend does?” asked Man B.

“He’s a soldier.” Zi Beiying replied briefly.

“A soldier? Then can you meet often? Isn’t it bad for your relationship?” Man B asked with concern.

Although he asked that question, he was happy to know that Zi Beiying’s boyfriend was a soldier, because it meant they would rarely see each other. In a year, they might only see each other several times. It was impossible for them to stay in love.

In that case, he had a chance to steal Zi Beiying away.

In his eyes, he didn’t think it was humiliating to steal another man’s girl. He believed it was a sign of his ability if he could.

Man B had great confidence in himself because he was good-looking and was born in a rich family.

Although his family background was hardly comparable to Xu Jinchen’s and Zi Beiying’s, he didn’t know that.

He could see that Zi Beiying wasn’t born in an ordinary family, but he didn’t think there was a huge gap between their families.

“We don’t see each other often, but not rarely either. As long as we’re not busy, we meet every weekend,” said Zi Beiying.

Hearing that, Man B was struck dumb for a moment. He didn’t expect Zi Beiying’s boyfriend to have so much free time.

Man B thought that Zi Beiying’s boyfriend was an average soldier, or a low rank official.

“Aren’t soldiers very busy?” asked Man B.

“Yes, average soldiers are very busy, but my boyfriend isn’t average,” Zi Beiying smiled while saying with pride. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Although both Xu Jinchen and she were born in powerful families, she wasn’t as outstanding as him when it came to their own abilities. She relied on her family’s shares to live a good life, while Xu Jinchen was a very young senior colonel.

Among his generation, he was one of the most outstanding soldiers in addition to Leng Shaoting.

There were few soldiers who could reach the rank of senior colonel at his age.

“Not an average soldier? Then what’s his rank? Is he one of the special forces?” asked Man B.

“Yes, he’s a special forces soldier with a rank,” said Zi Beiying.

Knowing that, the man was disappointed, because Zi Beiying’s boyfriend might be more influential than he thought.

If so, he wouldn’t have any chance.

“What’s his rank?” asked Man B again.

“I don’t think it’s necessary to elaborate on that,” said Zi Beiying. She was unwilling to talk about Xu Jinchen’s title.

Since she said that, Man B had to stop asking about it.

Because Century City wasn’t far from Wuxian KTV, Xu Jinchen soon showed up.

The moment he walked inside, Man B was stunned. He recognized Xu Jinchen, although Xu Jinchen didn’t know him.

Surprisingly, Zi Beiying’s boyfriend was Xu Jinchen.

In that case, not to mention stealing Zi Beiying away, he wouldn’t even dare to have a crush on her!

Even though he recognized Xu Jinchen, he pretended that he didn’t know him.

After Xu Jinchen came, Mengda and Nan moved away, leaving enough space for the couple.

Zi Beiying only told the two men that her boyfriend’s surname was Xu. She didn’t tell them his full name, so they called Xu Jinchen Mr. Xu.

Once Xu Jinchen came, Man B stopped clinking his glass with Zi Beiying and talking with her.

At about 11 pm, they separated. Zi Beiying asked Mengda and Nan to drive Xia Maiqi home, while she left in Xu Jinchen’s car.

When they were gone, the two men were left in the room, and Man B finally relaxed.

Man A didn’t know that Man B recognized Xu Jinchen, but he could see that his friend became much more nervous after Xu Jinchen came, so he joked. “What? Didn’t you enjoy chatting with Miss Zi? Why were you so quiet after her boyfriend came?”

He didn’t think it was a big deal that Man B tried to get close to Zi Beiying even after knowing that Zi Beiying already had a boyfriend. After all, Man B did nothing offensive and simply wanted to drink with her.

“Because you don’t know who the man is,” said Man B. He still felt scared because he was afraid that Zi Beiying might complain about him to Xu Jinchen. It could cause him a lot of trouble!
