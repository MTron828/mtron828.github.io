Chapter 85: A Quarrel In the Shopping Center

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Jiang Xu went to deal with his business, while Gu Ning along with Gu Man and Gu Qing took a taxi heading to the Commercial Building in downtown.

Gu Ning proposed to buy clothes first, but was stopped by Gu Qing. “Ningning, you already bought us clothes yesterday. We don’t need to waste more money on clothing.”

“It’s not enough! My mom and I have dumped all of our old clothes. We also need to buy new clothing. Relax, we’re not going to buy the designer brands, but some common brands,” Gu Ning comforted.

They didn’t need too many luxurious clothes. Luxurious clothing was only for important or special occasions.

In daily life, they could wear ordinary clothes.

People wore designer brand just to show off. Many medium-level brands were also of great quality.

Gu Qing listened to Gu Ning at the end.

They went to a medium-level brand of clothes to shop for Gu Man and Gu Qing.

Even though the brand was just medium-level, it was still a luxury for Gu Man and Gu Qing because they had never been to places like that.

Therefore, they were intimidated when they stepped in.

Gu Man and Gu Qing weren’t wearing good clothes, and seemed poor, plus both of them behaved in an unconfident way, so the saleswoman assumed that they couldn’t afford anything. Thus she didn’t even bother to greet them.

Gu Ning ignored the saleswoman. She guided Gu Qing and Gu Man, walking around casually. If they liked it, they could buy something. If they didn’t like it, they would leave.

Gu Qing chose a piece of clothing. She turned the price tag, and was shocked. “Gee! It costs 1,800 yuan!” 1,800 yuan was her salary for half a month!

Although she knew the clothes Gu Ning had bought for them cost much more than that, she still though the price was too high when she saw it with her own eyes.

Meanwhile, a sarcastic female voice sounded, “If you can’t afford a 1,800 yuan piece of clothing, then don’t ever step in here. Look at what you’re wearing. You only deserve cheap stuff.”

Gu Qing felt utterly embarrassed. She lowered her head in shame.

Gu Ning was upset. She looked to the woman, which was surprisingly familiar. Gu Ning lifted the corner of her lips. She looked evil, and called, “Oh, isn’t this Ms Jin?”

The woman heard Gu Ning’s voice. Her face changed immediately. “Who are you? I-I don’t know you!”

Gu Ning was now sure that the woman must have gone to get her jewelry identified, given that she was being so diffident. If her jewelry had been real, she would have been mad to see Gu Ning again.

“Don’t you remember? It was last Sunday, in the jewelry store...” Gu Ning reminded her on purpose.

“Shut your mouth!” The woman panicked and interrupt Gu Ning.

“What’s wrong?” At that time, a woman in her early forties dressed in an extravagant way walked over from the other side. Her eyes rounded when she saw Gu Ning and her family.

Both Gu Qing and Gu Man were surprised and felt uneasy to meet the woman.

Gu Ning squinted her eyes with coldness. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The woman was Lin Lijuan, Gu Xiaoxiao’s mother.

“Gu Qing, Gu Man, what are you doing here?” Lin Lijuan asked in surprised.

It was beyond her imagination that Gu Qing and Gu Man would show up here. In her eyes, they always wore cheap stuff from the street stalls.

Gu Qing and Gu Man didn’t want to talk to Lin Lijuan at first, but they were relatives after all. It wasn’t appropriate if they ignored her question in the public.

Accordingly, Gu Qing said airily, “We’re just here to have a look.”

Gu Qing didn’t want her to know that they were here to shop.

In front of Lin Lijuan, they preferred to pretend to be poor forever.

“Oh, I thought you picked up money on the roads, and you dare to walk in a place like that!” Hearing that, Lin Lijuan suddenly changed her tone. She didn’t bother to hide her complete disdain.

“Lin, do you know them?” the woman asked.

“Yeah, yeah. I’ve told you about them before. They’re my sisters-in-law.” Lin Lijuan sneered.

It seemed Lin Lijuan had badmouthed Gu Qing and Gu Man often behind their backs.

The woman immediately looked at Gu Man and Gu Qing with intense dislike. But since Gu Ning was here too, she didn’t dare to laugh at them.

“Gu Man, you were brave to move out from the old house, rather than apologize to us.” Although Lin Lijuan was still mad at Gu Ning. Gu Man and Gu Ning had paid for their behavior. Thus she wasn’t as annoyed as before, but now, seeing that Gu Qing was with Gu Man, Lin Lijuan believed that Gu Qing must have let Gu Man stay with her. She was immediately irritated. “Gu Qing, did you let Gu Man stay with you? Our mother has made it clear. If you dare to let Gu Man stay with you, we won’t help you anymore.”

It sounded like they had helped Gu Qing.

Gu Ning, who had been ignored, couldn’t help laughing in an ironic way.

Lin Lijuan didn’t notice Gu Ning until now, but when she looked to Gu Ning, she was amazed at her first glance.

Yes, she was amazed, because Gu Ning was totally different now.

Gu Ning was more beautiful than before, and she didn’t abase herself before anyone any longer. She looked elegant to some extent.

“That makes it sound like the Gu Family has ever helped my aunt. As far as I know, my aunt had relied on herself ever since she got married.” Gu Ning stared at Lin Lijuan. She didn’t bother to hide her complete dislike either.

Lin Lijuan immediately wore an unpleasant face.

She was embarrassed by Gu Ning’s words in public.

Then, Gu Qing followed up. “Lin Lijuan, let’s be clear. We have never ever received your help! Besides, Gu Man doesn’t stay with me now.”

She had indeed never received help from Gu Qinxiang. She wouldn’t let Lin Lijuan take advantage of her.

“You...” Lin Lijuan’s face seemed more unpleasant. But she couldn’t deny the truth.
