3357 Let Jealousy Get the Better of Her

Half an hour later, Leng Xiaoyao came down with a computer.

“Niece Xiaoyao, what did you find out?” Song Zhenyang asked eagerly.

“I found out that it’s a conspiracy. Those big orders were also part of the conspiracy. The mastermind behind it is your peer and friend, Fengxing Building Materials. They may have a personal grudge against you or simply cannot stand the fact that your business is better than theirs, so they bribed a person in charge of your supplier, but it’s not a big deal. You can use the evidence to make them stop or report it to the senior management of the supplier. They shouldn’t let go of the business opportunity,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Everyone was shocked to hear that. Leng Xiaoyao really found the truth.

“I can’t believe it’s Zhang Hantao…” Song Zhenyang looked gloomy, but he wasn’t too shocked. Although he had a good relationship with Zhang Hantao on the surface, they were actually wary of each other in private.

As for grudges, he and Zhang Hantao hadn’t had any conflicts, but Zhang Hantao’s stores business was indeed far inferior to his own.

Zhang Hantao was really capable of doing such things! Because he knew that Zhang Hantao was unreliable, he didn’t make deep connections with him. They were just superficial friends.

“Zhang Hantao? No way! He has such a good relationship with Zhenyang.” Aunt Song thought that Zhang Hantao and Song Zhenyang had such a good relationship that he wouldn’t harm them.

“What’s so surprising about that? For interests, some people would even plot against their own blood relatives, let alone just friends! Besides, I have evidence here!” Leng Xiaoyao said with sarcasm, without any implications towards Leng Yuqi, just stating the facts.

However, in the eyes of everyone else, she was implicating Leng Yuqi. As a result, Leng Yuqi and her family were extremely displeased, but they couldn’t say anything.

Regardless of what they thought, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t care. It was a fact that Leng Yuqi had plotted against her.

“Take a look for yourself.” Leng Xiaoyao handed the computer to Song Zhenyang for him to see. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

After reading the evidence, Song Zhenyang felt a surge of anger.

“So should I go to see Zhang Hantao with this evidence or go to meet the senior management of the supplier?” Song Zhenyang asked for Leng Xiaoyao’s opinions. Leng Xiaoyao’s importance in his heart was skyrocketing!

“It’s Zhang Hantao who wants to harm you. You can directly find him and teach him a lesson so that he will behave in the future. If there is no one being bribed at the supplier’s end, they won’t do these things,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Okay, can you give me this evidence?” Song Zhenyang said, following Leng Xiaoyao’s advice.

“Just wait a moment. I’ll go upstairs and print it out.” Leng Xiaoyao said and went upstairs with the computer.

“Leng Xiaoyao is really amazing!” Song Xicheng admired her greatly. She was good at studying and even knew how to hack. She solved the problem that had been troubling his father for a long time within half an hour.

Nobody dared to deny Song Xicheng’s words. Only Leng Changyuan proudly added. “Of course, she’s my granddaughter after all.”

Leng Yuqi, who was also Leng Changyuan’s granddaughter, was sad. She knew that she had been forgotten by her grandfather.

Since she broke up with Chu Jianan, she regretted stealing Chu Jianan from Leng Xiaoyao. She had offended her grandfather and Uncle Yecheng, which was a really bad thing for her.

Before stealing Chu Jianan, although she had many conflicts with Leng Xiaoyao, at least she hadn’t made her grandfather and Uncle Yecheng dislike her. They often gave her pocket money.

Especially Uncle Yecheng, he would usually buy gifts for Leng Xiaoyao as well as her, including many beautiful clothes and dresses.

Although her father was an official and her mother also had a position, they only earned a fixed salary to support her and her brother’s education. They didn’t have much money left to buy clothes for her.

Every girl wanted to be beautiful and buy many beautiful clothes and dresses.

…

Leng Xiaoyao quickly printed out evidence and gave it to Song Zhenyang, who was very grateful.

With the evidence in hand, Song Zhenyang was eager to deal with it, so he didn’t want to stay long. He bid farewell to Leng Changyuan and the others.

When they walked away, Song Xicheng was reluctant.

Upon seeing Song Xicheng’s expression, Song Xiaoxiao got angry. “Song Xicheng, are you interested in Leng Xiaoyao? I never expected you to be such a shallow person. Didn’t you hate her before? You even helped Yuqi scold her. You should know that Leng Xiaoyao and Yuqi don’t get along…’”

“Song Xiaoxiao, your jealousy has gotten the better of you. What’s wrong with Xiaoyao? She’s helped Dad, and our family! Shouldn’t you thank her?” Song Xicheng interrupted her directly. When he heard someone say that Leng Xiaoyao was wrong, he got mad. Leng Xiaoyao was obviously a good girl. Why did everyone have to pick on her?

“You…” Song Xiaoxiao was so mad that she was breathless.

“Alright, Xiaoxiao, as the sister, you’re not as mature as your brother.” Song Zhenyang snapped at her. Leng Xiaoyao had helped him and he was grateful to her. He wouldn’t allow his daughter to verbally attack Leng Xiaoyao like that. He still knew how to have gratitude.

Song Xiaoxiao didn’t dare to say anything again.

Although the Song family also lived in City Chang, City Chang was so big that the two families were in different directions. It took almost an hour for the Song family to get home.

After returning home, Song Zhenyang went straight to the study and called Zhang Hantao.

“Brother Song, is there anything you need at this late hour?” Zhang Hantao still talked to Song Zhenyang in a very polite tone.

“It’s funny!” Song Zhenyang sneered. He felt that Zhang Hantao’s attitude was extremely ironic. Without beating around the bush, Song Zhenyang said straightforwardly, “Zhang Hantao, you’re the one who’s preventing me from getting the goods.”

Zhang Hantao was shocked when he heard that, then angrily retorted. “Song Zhenyang, that’s ridiculous. Why do you think it’s me?”

Zhang Hantao couldn’t figure it out. Why did Song Zhenyang believe that it was him?

If Song Zhenyang was only suspicious of him, it wasn’t a big deal. However, Song Zhenyang directly asked him about it, it meant that he was sure of it.

“It isn’t you?” Song Zhenyang asked in a mocking tone.

“Why would I do that?” Zhang Hantao retorted.

“I’m also curious about the reason.” Song Zhenyang said, “But Zhang Hantao, I already have evidence that you bribed the supplier’s management to not release the goods to me. Even for those big orders I got, they were arranged by you. If you want to settle this privately, then have them release the goods to me quickly. If you continue to deny it, I’ll have to hand over the evidence to the police tomorrow.”
