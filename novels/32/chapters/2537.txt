Chapter 2538: A Mortal? What’s His Name? Translations

Saying that, Baili Zongxue gave a sign. “If it’s true, the Jing family’s patriarch is really cruel. Even a vicious tiger will not eat its cubs, but he killed his own daughter. Even though she made a mistake, it isn’t a reason for him to kill her.”

Baili Zongxue had a deep sympathy for Jing Yunyao.

Talking about that, Gu Ning was also affected. Jing Yaorong had indeed tried to kill Jing Yunyao, though luckily Jing Yunyao survived. However, Leng Yuanhan was dead.

Therefore, Jing Yunyao and Leng Shaoting were determined to take revenge. They were almost ready. Before long, they would go to pay Jing Yaorong back in the cultivation world.

They stayed in the small forest for a few minutes, before Chu Peihan called Gu Ning, saying that the meeting was over, and they could leave now.

After that, Gu Ning told her to meet them at the car, and that they were waiting for her.

Five minutes later, Chu Peihan came. Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue were also ready to leave.

Once Chu Peihan got in the car, they drove away.

“How is it? When will you join the crew?” asked Gu Ning.

“I’ll join them after three days. The shooting of my part will last three months, so I’m afraid I’ll have to spend two thirds of the time at the set,” said Chu Peihan. Although the shooting of her part would last three months, she would have time for a rest. She didn’t need to show her face in front of the cameras every day, so she could go back to school for classes when she was free.

It might affect her studies, but it was unavoidable for a student who studied in a film academy. Moreover, their school allowed her to do it.

Actually, since students who went to study in a film academy aimed to become famous, there was no time limit for their debut.

Many people hoped that students could finish their education before finding a job. However, the competition was fierce in the entertainment industry. It wasn’t easy for them to get a chance to show their faces in front of the cameras.

If any one of them could gain some fame, their school would be proud, so they could build their career while they were studying in school.

They just needed to keep studying at the same time and it wouldn’t be a problem as long as they could pass the exams.

In addition, given Chu Peihan’s status, their school had no reason to stop her. She was Professor Gu’s student! She had a bright future ahead.

“Do you plan to take the crew’s car, or drive your own car? If you drive a car on your own, it’ll be more convenient. I can prepare a car for you if you want,” said Gu Ning.

Chu Peihan thought for a while, and also thought that it would be more convenient for her to drive her own car. However, after she joined the crew, she wouldn’t need a car most of the time. The transportation at Qianling Mountain was convenient as well, so she didn’t really need a car. Most importantly, she was unwilling to occupy Gu Ning’s car.

Therefore, Chu Peihan made a decision. “I know it’ll be more convenient if I drive a car on my own, but the shooting will last for a long time, so I don’t think a car is really necessary. I prefer not to drive by myself, but if I need it, I’ll tell you later.”

Chu Peihan didn’t want to upset Gu Ning.

“Sure.” Since Chu Peihan made her choice, Gu Ning didn’t comment on it further.

“You’re a new face. You don’t have an assistant and have to deal with everything on your own, but if you need any help, you can turn to Qiao Hanchen or Su Tongnuo for help. They’ll help you,” said Gu Ning.

In fact, even if Gu Ning didn’t mention it, they would go to help Chu Peihan if she needed them. After all, Chu Peihan was Gu Ning’s friend, and they got along well with each other.

Therefore, they would take care of Chu Peihan whether Gu Ning told them to do so or not.

“Thanks,” said Chu Peihan.

…

When Jing Yuelan was back in the Jing family’s house, she met Jing Yunyan who was about to go out. Because Jing Yuelan was still mad, she looked very unhappy.

“Oh, what happened? You look angry.” Jing Yunyan joked.

Jing Yuelan wasn’t easy-going, but Jing Yunyan didn’t have a bad impression of her. Instead, he treated her even better than Jing Bingjie.

Jing Bingjie was more obedient, but she was never close to Jing Yunyan ever since she was little, so their relationship wasn’t very good.

Jing Yuelan had a bad reputation, but she always played with Jing Yunyan since childhood, so they were very close.

“I just left the cultivation world and saw Baili Zongxue at the square of Qianling Mountain. I asked her where Baili Zongyang is, but she refused to tell me. She even humiliated me. I got mad, so I fought against her,” said Jing Yuelan. Because everyone was aware that she liked Baili Zongyang and was chasing him, she didn’t bother to keep it a secret.

The Jing family had actually reminded her not to mess with Baili Zongyang, but she wouldn’t listen. Anyway, she hadn’t caused any serious trouble, so her family didn’t bother to restrict her.

“I was at an advantage, but Baili Zongxue’s mortal friend helped her, so I was defeated. I didn’t expect a mortal to be so strong! If Baili Zongxue hadn’t been there, I would have beaten her sh*t out!” said Jing Yuelan, feeling angrier.

“A mortal? What’s her name?” Jing Yunyan thought of Gu Ning at once, because the only strong mortal, he knew, who had a close relationship with Baili Zongxue was Gu Ning.

“Gu Ning, a student from the Capital University,” said Jing Yuelan. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

It was indeed her!

Because Gu Ning worked with Baili Zongxue and defeated Jing Yuelan, Jing Yunyan wasn’t surprised. After all, Baili Zongxue was at the same level as Jing Yuelan. There wasn’t a huge difference between their abilities. Therefore, when Gu Ning joined their fight, she only helped Baili Zongxue a little instead of saving Baili Zongxue.

“Alright, take it easy. If you meet her again, teach her a lesson then,” said Jing Yunyan to comfort Jing Yuelan.
