Leng Xiaoyao’s comfort didn’t work, because the girl remembered that after she fell into the water, she was surrounded by a black gas, which scared her.

Although she knew how to swim, she was unable to move at that time. She felt like she had encountered a monster.

Although she had never believed in demons and monsters, what happened just now…

After returning to the shore, Leng Xiaoyao asked for the phone numbers of the girls’ families and called them. Since they weren’t seriously injured, they didn’t rush to the hospital.

However, for the sake of their families’ peace of mind, they still needed to go to the hospital.

Leng Xiaoyao felt the unfriendly gaze of someone in the crowd. She looked over, only to discover that it was Leng Yuqi.

Leng Yuqi was with a boy and a girl about her age, her cousins. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

They were all surprised that Leng Xiaoyao was the one who saved those girls.

Seeing so many people admire and praise Leng Xiaoyao, they became angry.

Leng Xiaoyao’s cousins often followed Leng Yuqi in scolding her.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t care about their existence. She just took a glance, then looked away.

“Yuqi, is she really Leng Xiaoyao?” Leng Yuqi’s cousin, Song Xicheng, asked softly. They knew that the spots on Leng Xiaoyao’s face had disappeared, but it was the first time they saw her like this. Therefore, they were surprised and even a little afraid to recognize her.

“Yeah.” Leng Yuqi responded coldly.

“She has become so beautiful.” Song Xiaoxiao smiled slightly with envy in his eyes. He had always been jealous of Leng Xiaoyao and now he was even more jealous.

Leng Xiaoyao had become a lot prettier than Leng Yuqi.

She used to be jealous of Leng Yuqi, but now she started to be jealous of Leng Xiaoyao.

The relationship between cousins and sisters wasn’t always harmonious. There was also a lot of competition and comparison between them.

Most of the Song family relied on the Leng family to get better. They were naturally jealous of Leng Yuqi, who had better conditions than them.

Therefore, outwardly, they were united, but internally, they were competitors.

…

After calling an ambulance and sending them to the hospital, Leng Xiaoyao and Dai Ya left by themselves. They didn’t need to worry about it anymore.

“Excuse me, the two ladies.” They were stopped not far away by the two men who jumped into the lake with them to save the girls just now.

“Hello, is there anything we can help you with?” Leng Xiaoyao asked politely.

“Nothing in particular. We just saw you jump into the river to save people at that time. We admire you very much and wanted to get to know you,” one man said, looking a little shy.

“You’re also very capable. We don’t need to get to know each other since we just met by chance. We have something else to do. Please excuse us.” Leng Xiaoyao politely refused, then turned around and left.

“Humph! This woman is too arrogant!” The other man felt embarrassed and said unhappily.

Although his voice wasn’t loud, Leng Xiaoyao still heard it, but she didn’t care.

“It’s you who are aloof. We indeed met by chance. Why should they want to know you?” The man talking to Leng Xiaoyao didn’t think there was anything wrong with her attitude. She had the right to refuse after all.

The other man wasn’t convinced, but he didn’t say anything more.

Walking behind them, Song Xiaoxiao felt jealous after seeing the two good-looking men talking to Leng Xiaoyao. “Humph! She’s really a vixen.”

“Should we teach Leng Xiaoyao a lesson?” Song Xicheng said.

“Better not,” Leng Yuqi said. She was afraid of Leng Xiaoyao and didn’t want any conflict with her because she would be the one who suffered.

“Why?” Song Xiaoxiao asked, puzzled.

“You can’t bully her.” Leng Yuqi said, “If you go, don’t blame me for not warning you. She’s tough!”

To avoid them impulsively going to trouble Leng Xiaoyao and then blaming her for their loss, Leng Yuqi reminded them.

If they still didn’t listen after the reminder, then whatever happened would have nothing to do with her.

“No way! I don’t believe it.” Song Xicheng didn’t believe it and went to catch up with Leng Xiaoyao.

“Leng Xiaoyao, stop!” Song Xicheng shouted.

Leng Xiaoyao heard him, but ignored him and walked ahead.

Although Dai Ya looked back, she didn’t say anything. It was obvious that these two didn’t have a good relationship.

Besides, the man was obviously unfriendly.

When Leng Xiaoyao didn’t stop, Song Xicheng became angry and ran over to block her way.

However, when he saw Leng Xiaoyao’s face, Song Xicheng was stunned. She was too beautiful!

“What’s up?” Leng Xiaoyao asked calmly.

“I-I-I…” Song Xicheng stuttered and didn’t know what to say.

Seeing that he couldn’t finish a sentence, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t pay much attention and just walked around him.

Song Xicheng was annoyed, but he didn’t know what to say. He simply stared blankly at her back as she left.

It was fine. He would see her at the Leng family’s mansion later.

Song Xiaoxiao immediately walked over and said angrily, “What’s wrong with you?”

“I saw her beautiful face and couldn’t say anything,” Song Xicheng said, blushing and feeling his heart racing for some reason.

Song Xiaoxiao slapped him on the head at once. “Song Xicheng, are you infatuated with Leng Xiaoyao? Don’t forget that we’re at odds with her.”

After being slapped on the head by Song Xiaoxiao, Song Xicheng was very unhappy, but he didn’t get angry. “Leng Xiaoyao hasn’t done anything to hurt us!”

He suddenly realized that they had always been the ones to provoke her, so there was no real conflict between them.

“What did you…?” Song Xiaoxiao was so angry that she couldn’t catch her breath. “Even you were seduced by her, a vixen!”

“How could you say that? She’s not a vixen! She’s simply beautiful. It really is jealousy that makes people ugly.” Song Xicheng said in annoyance, then ignored Song Xiaoxiao and left.

“You…” Song Xiaoxiao was furious. Leng Yuqi was also displeased.

…

On Leng Xiaoyao’s side.

Dai Ya said, “Leng Xiaoyao, you’re amazing! Your premonition was really accurate.” She still couldn’t recover from the shock of Leng Xiaoyao jumping into the lake and not coming up for a long time. “By the way, why did you take so long to come up after jumping into the lake?”

She didn’t doubt Leng Xiaoyao’s ability, but felt that something had gone wrong.

“The girl sank too fast after falling into the water, so it took a while to find her,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Dai Ya believed her without doubt.
