Chapter 570 Gu Man Is Abducted by the Kirin Gang

Gu Ning beat them down with great force because she felt very disgusted.

All those men were on the ground moaning in pain within seconds. To their astonishment, this young girl was very strong and could easily beat them down like lightning.

Gu Ning took out ropes and tied them up, so that it was impossible for them to struggle, let alone escape. After that, she stared straight at them and asked in a cold voice, “Where is my mother?”

Gu Ning’s sharp eyes, cold expression, and imposing manner made them feel shocked and oppressed. They even felt the chill from the bottom of their feet and trembled in fear. However, they still refused to tell her. “I think that you better let us go. If you dare to kill any of us, your mother won’t stay alive!”

“Do you think that I wouldn’t dare to hurt you?” Saying that, Gu Ning took out a gun all of a sudden, then aimed at one man’s shoulder. Boom! The man shouted in pain and horror.

At this moment, they were all scared. This young girl had a gun, and she shot them without blinking her eyes! Obviously, this wasn’t the first time that she had shot a man.

“Tell me, or get killed?” Gu Ning was getting increasingly cold, and they almost lost their breath. However, they still didn’t give up threatening. “You... How dare you shoot me! We’re members of the Kirin Gang!”

The Kirin Gang? Gu Ning squinted in greater coldness, but she didn’t jump to the conclusion that the Kirin Gang had abducted Gu Man just because they were members of it. She knew that gangsters would do anything for money, so she wasn’t sure whether they had been hired by someone else to abduct Gu Man.

Therefore, Gu Ning glared at the man and asked seriously, “Do you mean that my mother is in the hands of the Kirin Gang?”

“Yes, and so what?” the man said arrogantly. He believed that this young girl had to be afraid of the Kirin Gang.

Gu Ning was indeed worried, because the Kirin Gang wasn’t the Qing Gang, and it was common that they would hurt the hostages.

Gu Ning was unwilling to waste time, so she stopped talking to them, but called Qi Tianlin at once.

When Qi Tianlin received Gu Ning’s call, he was surprised.

“Miss Gu, I’m surprised that you’d call me. What? Did you win a fortune again at the Earth Nightclub?” Qi Tianlin said in annoyance.

“I wish, because I can walk out of the Earth Nightclub without your help in that case,” Gu Ning said. She wasn’t in a good mood now.

“Well, it seems that you’re not in a good mood.” Qi Tianlin didn’t mind Gu Ning’s aggressive attitude because he found something more interesting. Gu Ning had been in a rage when they had fought against each other last time, and she had behaved like a mature woman. However, when she called him this time, she sounded like a girl who was annoyed.

“Qi, I don’t have time to argue with you now. My mother was abducted at XX Road around 8:10 pm today, and the kidnappers claim that they are members of the Kirin Gang,” Gu Ning said. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

When those men heard Gu Ning talking with Qi Tianlin on the phone, they were shocked. They couldn’t believe that this young girl was able to know their head in the gang.

“Really? Give me some time. If it’s true, I promise that I’ll handle it well,” Qi Tianlin said with sincerity.

Although Qi Tianlin was still displeased with what Gu Ning had done last time, he didn’t hate her. Instead, he had the intention to make friends with her, so he, of course, wouldn’t upset her.

Gu Man wasn’t in this warehouse, and Qi Tianlin promised to help her, so Gu Ning thought that there was no need to stay here any longer.

Before Gu Ning left, she unfastened them, but beat them again to vent her anger. They were evil people, but she wasn’t willing to be involved in murder just because of them.

After that, Gu Ning left with Gu Man’s phone. Once she walked away, she called Leng Shaoting and told him what she had been through then they went to meet each other at the place where they had stopped the car.

When Leng Shaoting heard that Gu Ning had gone to meet the kidnappers alone, he was more worried than upset, because he was afraid that Gu Ning might be hurt. However, since Gu Ning was fine now, he didn’t mention it.

Tang Yunfan was also out for a long time, but he had no idea where Gu Man was. In the end, he went to the place where Gu Man had been seen last and there was an abandoned MPV.

Ten minutes later, Gu Ning received Qi Tianlin’s call.

Qi Tianlin told her that Gu Man was indeed in the hands of the Kirin Gang, and she could go to the Earth Nightclub to pick her mother up.

Hearing that, Gu Ning was finally relieved, so was Leng Shaoting. They then drove to the Earth Nightclub together.

From afar, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting noticed a man standing at the accident scene. Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes so that she could see his face clearly. When she recognized that the man was Tang Yunfan, Gu Ning was surprised that he was already awake. It was obvious that he knew that Gu Man had been abducted.

Gu Ning stopped the car and ran to Tang Yunfan at once, followed by Leng Shaoting.

When they moved closer, Leng Shaoting recognized that the man was Tang Yunfan, and he was surprised too.

Tang Yunfan heard the noise, then looked at Gu Ning. He was astonished as well.

“Uncle Tang, You’re finally awake!” Gu Ning said with excitement.

Tang Yunfan, however, asked Gu Ning with anxiety, “Ningning, how is your mom now?”

“My friend has found her, and we can go to pick her up right now,” Gu Ning said.
