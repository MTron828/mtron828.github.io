Chapter 897: He Siyang Is Rescued.

There was a short distance between the reef and the sea. Although waves kept hitting it, half of the hole was still empty, otherwise He Siyang would already have been drowned.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting observed the reef for a while first to see whether it was different from others. They soon noticed that there was a separate rock placed on it. It was supposed to be the entrance of the hole, but He Siyang closed it with a rock to prevent others from finding him.

The entrance was wide enough for a person to get in, and the rock placed on it was as big as a 20-inch suitcase.

Ordinary people probably wouldn’t notice the difference, because they weren’t able to see the hole under the rock.

Thanks to the two wolves, Gu Ning had an excuse to point the difference out.

“Why don’t we move the rock away?” Gu Ning proposed.

“Sure, let me do it,” Leng Shaoting said.

Although the waves were loudly hitting the reef, He Siyang still heard Gu Ning’s conversation with Leng Shaoting. He was surprised that they could notice that the rock was unusual. Once the rock was moved away, he would be exposed. Given his condition now, it was impossible for him to fight back.

Leng Shaoting soon turned the rock over, and the hole under it appeared in Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s sight, which surprised Leng Shaoting. He couldn’t believe that there was a large hole under the reef.

He Siyang was hiding in the farthest corner, so Leng Shaoting didn’t find him at first glance.

Without hesitation, Leng Shaoting stuck his head inside, and found a person sitting there looking at him.

“He Siyang?”

Leng Shaoting recognize him the second he saw his face, because he memorized He Siyang’s photo before he came.

To Leng Shaoting’s astonishment, He Siyang was right in this hole.

Hearing that, Gu Ning looked inside as well. Although she already knew it, she still had to pretend that she was surprised too. “Oh, he’s here!”

“Who are you?”

Hearing them calling his name, He Siyang was struck dumb. He had a feeling that they were looking for him.

“We’re your family’s friends. Your older brother, He Yishao, and your younger sister, He Siyin, are here with us. They are waiting in a yacht by the beach. I know that you don’t feel safe, so I can call them for you to hear their voices,” Gu Ning said, and took out her phone to call He Siyin, then put it on speaker.

She didn’t have He Yishao’s phone number, so she could only call He Siyin. And because they were by the sea now, the reception wasn’t bad.

He Siyang started to believe that they were here to help him out when Gu Ning took out her phone.

...

He Yishao and the others had waited for an hour and a half in the yacht, which was a torture, but they had to be patient.

The brothers in the He family in He Hongjie’s generation didn’t get along, but things were different in He Yishao’s generation. He Yishao and his siblings got along very well, and they wouldn’t fight against each other for family properties. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

He Yishao was good at business, while He Siyang was talented at gambling. He Siyang wasn’t interested in, nor good at running a company, and he just wanted to live a simple, rich life.

When He Siyin’s phone rang, she picked it up at once. “Gu Ning, how is it?”

He Siyang almost cried when he heard He Siyin’s voice, and relaxed a lot.

“We just found him, and he’s lightly injured. We’ll bring him back soon,” Gu Ning said.

“Really? Thanks!” He Siyin burst into tears of joy.

He Siyang felt like crying too. He thought that he would never get back to his family.

“Can I talk to him?” He Yishao grabbed He Siyin’s phone.

“Sure, but please wait a moment,” Gu Ning said, then looked at He Siyang. “You should believe me this time. Get out now.”

He Siyang trusted her, and got out of the hole at once.

Leng Shaoting reached out an arm to help him out because his limbs were sore.

Gu Ning already put her phone on speaker, so He Siyang could directly talk to his older brother without holding the phone.

“Yishao, it’s Siyang. I’m fine.” He Siyang choked.

“Great, great, Siyang...” He Yishao also choked.

After hanging up the call, He Yishao called He Hongjie without delay.

...

Gu Ning took out a power crystal and gave it to He Siyang. “Take it, and your body will be much better.”

“Thanks.” He Siyang didn’t wonder if there was any problem with this medicine. He thanked Gu Ning before he directly swallowed it. Since they came here to bring him home, there was no need for them to hurt him.

The second he put the pill into his mouth, he felt a flow of coolness spreading across his body. He was regaining his energy and didn’t feel tired any longer.

“Wow, this...” He Siyang looked at Gu Ning with surprise. “This medicine is so effective!”

“How do you feel now? Can you walk on your own?” Gu Ning asked.

“Sure I can.” He Siyang stood up at once, then stretched his arms. He even felt more energetic than usual now.
