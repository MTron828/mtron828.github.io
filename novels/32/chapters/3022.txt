3024 Leng Xiaoyao Is So Impressive

“Yuqi, did you see the result? Leng Xiaoyao is the top scorer. Her total score is 747 points! I know she’s excellent at studying right now, but I still can’t believe she’s so good,” Chu Jiayu said in astonishment.

“Right! Leng Xiaoyao is totally different now. I hate it.” Jiang Yihan chimed in.

Although they were jealous of Leng Xiaoyao, they weren’t as jealous of her as Leng Yuqi was because there was no conflict between them. They mostly disliked Leng Xiaoyao because they had a good relationship with Leng Yuqi.

Leng Yuqi was in a terrible mood at this moment, so when Chu Jiayu and Jiang Yihan talked about the result in front of her, she became more annoyed. However, she couldn’t vent her anger at them, so she only replied unhappily. “Yeah, it’s shocking.”

Jiang Yihan gave Leng Yuqi a glance, then said, “Leng Xiaoyao suddenly changed so much. If Jianan knew, would he…”

She didn’t finish, but Leng Yuqi and Chu Jiayu understood what she wanted to say.

“No, it won’t happen!” Leng Yuqi denied it at once. She sounded confident, but she was actually full of worries.

In fact, there were too many conflicts between Leng Xiaoyao and them. Chu Jianan hated Leng Xiaoyao to death right now.

However, Leng Yuqi felt very stressed when facing Leng Xiaoyao. She felt insecure and cared too much about Chu Jianan, so it was impossible for her not to be worried.

“No way! Even if Leng Xiaoyao is different now, her face is still the same. It’s full of freckles. No one will like her!” Chu Jiayu said disdainfully. She was sure that Chu Jianan cared about a girl’s appearance.

“Although there are freckles all over Leng Xiaoyao’s face, she has fine and delicate features. She can easily become beautiful by removing the freckles at the hospital,” Jiang Yihan said. The moment she finished, she added to prevent Leng Yuqi getting mad at her. “Um, I don’t really mean that. It’s my older cousin who told me that. You know my older cousin is a make-up artist, so she’s professional.”

Without surprise, Leng Yuqi was getting angrier, but she didn’t blame Jiang Yihan because she explained immediately.

She also understood that Leng Xiaoyao had fine and delicate features. Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t attractive now because of those freckles, but she could be much prettier without them.

After all, Leng Xiaoyao’s parents were both good-looking and no one in the Leng family had a plain face. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

If Leng Xiaoyao was ugly, she might not have the blood of the Leng family.

“I don’t think she will be as pretty as Yuqi even if she removes those freckles,” Chu Jiayu said. She was very protective of Leng Yuqi.

“Of course!” Jiang Yihan agreed. Anyway, there were freckles all over Leng Xiaoyao’s face, so she wasn’t attractive at all.

Actually, Jiang Yihan complimented Leng Xiaoyao in front of Leng Yuqi because she was jealous of Leng Yuqi.

She loved Chu Jianan too, but Chu Jianan was only interested in Leng Yuqi.

In fact, her family was richer than Leng Yuqi’s family, but Leng Yuqi was prettier and sexier than her.

Therefore, since Leng Yuqi couldn’t be together with Chu Jianan publicly right now, Jiang Yihan came up with the idea of stealing Chu Jianan away.

She understood that it would make them enemies, but she didn’t care. Leng Yuqi acted pure and elegant in front of them, but she knew Leng Yuqi was a calculating girl.

The moment anything went wrong when they did something together, Leng Yuqi always put the blame on her. She had been embarrassed like that many times, so she had a grudge against Leng Yuqi.

Therefore, she didn’t care if they became enemies.

She knew that Chu Jianan might not be aware of Leng Yuqi’s real colors. If he knew, she didn’t think he would continue to be together with her.

However, she had to think of a way to impress Chu Jianan and collect enough evidence to prove that Leng Yuqi was hypocritical.

…

Along Leng Xiaoyao’s way to the classroom, students who knew her score in the test looked at her with admiration.

Wang Yiming arrived at the classroom earlier, so he raised his voice once Leng Xiaoyao walked inside. “Now, let’s applaud Leng Xiaoyao’s excellent performance in the monthly test this time. She’s the top scorer and nearly got a full score. Her total score is 747 points!”

The next moment, there was a round of thunderous applause.

“Leng Xiaoyao, you’re so impressive.”

“You’re amazing!”

“…”

All of them were full of excitement, as if they were the top scorer, but they were the worst class, and none of them had ever ranked among the top 200. Now that there was a top scorer in their class, it was impossible for them not to be excited. And they felt extremely proud.

In addition, Leng Xiaoyao was the worst of the worst students. Now she suddenly became the top scorer, which shocked a lot of people. They were happy to hear the news too!

No one was more excited than Wang Yiming, their head teacher. When the result came out, he was ecstatic, especially when other head teachers showed their envy of him.

He had believed that Leng Xiaoyao might be among the top 10, but unexpectedly she was the top scorer.

Because of the shocking news, even the dean of students and the principal called him to the office to talk about it.

At the beginning, they were doubtful of Leng Xiaoyao’s score, but they were convinced after Wang Yiming’s explanation.

However, they said something that upset Wang Yiming afterwards because they wanted Leng Xiaoyao to study in the best class. Given her score, she should be with the best students.

It was true that Leng Xiaoyao matched the best class, and she might not study well in Class 8.

Wang Yiming was unwilling to lose Leng Xiaoyao, but he didn’t know her opinion yet, so he couldn’t turn them down right away. He needed to ask Leng Xiaoyao her opinion first.

“Thanks!” Leng Xiaoyao politely thanked them for their applause and compliments.

Before Leng Xiaoyao went to her seat, Wang Yiming asked her out. “Leng Xiaoyao, we need to have a talk outside.”

“Sure,” Leng Xiaoyao said, then she followed Wang Yiming out.

Outside the door, Wang Yiming immediately turned from happy to upset.

Seeing that, Leng Xiaoyao understood that something wasn’t right, but she said nothing and waited patiently.
