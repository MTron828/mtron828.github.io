Chapter 1272: Have the Competition on Behalf of Lin Fei

Lin Fei understood that it must have something to do with the exchange student from Country R that he was suddenly attacked by a group of strange men. However, he didn’t know why the exchange student did that since he was confident to win.

It was a very dirty trick!

Gu Ning agreed that the exchange student from Country R must be the mastermind of this sudden attack towards Lin Fei. He did that in case Lin Fei won the game.

“No problem, I’m willing to help you. If I need your help in the future, I’ll let you know,” Gu Ning said.

Gu Ning agreed to help Lei Fei because she hated people from Country R too.

“Really?” Lin Fei was thrilled.

With Gu Ning’s help, he was confident to defeat the exchange student from Country R.

“When and where will the competition be held?” Gu Ning asked.

Lin Fei then told Gu Ning the time and place.

The competition would be held at XX race track at 2 pm. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

After hanging up the call with Gu Ning, Lin Fei’s friend asked him, “Lin Fei, who did you invite to have the competition for you?”

“Gu Ning, the girl I just told you about, and I believe in her,” Lin Fei said. He believed that Gu Ning was more likely to win the game than him.

His friend said nothing, but he hadn’t seen Gu Ning before, so he still worried. Nevertheless, they were left no choice now.

...

When it was about 8 pm, Leng Shaoting called Gu Ning and told her that he had arrived in the capital.

Gu Ning and her friends stayed in Yu Mixi’s new home till 9 pm, before they went back to their own homes.

Gu Ning called Gao Yi after she was home, and told him to be prepared to go to City G tomorrow.

Gao Yi didn’t ask for the reason and did whatever Gu Ning told him to do.

The next day, Gu Ning and her two bodyguards set off at 9 pm, and they arrived at City G two hours later.

Gu Ning didn’t contact Lin Fei right away, instead they went to have lunch first.

After having lunch, Gu Ning called Lin Fei and told him that she was in City G now.

Lin Fei asked her whether she had lunch yet.

Gu Ning said that she already had lunch, so they agreed to meet at XX race track at 1:30 pm.

It was only 12:30 pm now, so Gu Ning rested for half an hour before she went to the race track. The race track was located in a suburb, so it was a bit far.

Gu Ning and her two bodyguards reached XX race track a few minutes earlier than 1:30 pm.

There was a large parking lot outside, and Gu Ning recognized Lin Fei’s car at first glance.

When she came close, Lin Fei noticed her as well. His eyes lit up and he walked to Gu Ning at once.

Because his hand was injured, his friend drove the car for him and he sat in the front passenger’s seat.

“Hi, Gu Ning!” Lin Fei smiled at her.

“Nice to meet you, Miss Gu.” Lin Fei’s friend politely greeted her. He was also excited to see Gu Ning in real life after knowing about her achievements.

“Nice to meet you too.” Gu Ning greeted him, then turned to ask Lin Fei, “Has he arrived yet?”

“Not yet, but he said he’ll come before 2 pm,” Lin Fei said. “Let’s go to see the track now.”

“Great.” Gu Ning nodded.

Since Gu Ning was going to have the competition on behalf of Lin Fei, she drove Lin Fei’s car inside.

This race track was owned by the Lin family, and it was open to everyone. Other than the race track, there was also a horse-riding field, and many other amusement facilities as well.

Lin Fei needed this race track now, so it was already cleared up. Therefore, those who wanted to have auto racing had to wait in the audience seats. Many visitors were also having a rest in the audience seats.

Gu Ning drove into a track at normal speed.

The race track covered an area of 550 acres, and the track was 2.82 kilometers long with 5 left turns and 8 right turns.

Gu Ning just had a round on it before she got off it.

Lin Fei asked with curiosity, “Don’t you want to test the speed and get familiar with the track?”

“No need,” Gu Ning said with a calm face.

Since Gu Ning said that, Lin Fei didn’t insist.

Lin Fei’s friends who were all car race lovers gathered later, and they were excited to see Gu Ning too, because Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary girl, but the famous Goddess Gu.

In fact, given Gu Ning’s outstanding appearance, she could still be very popular among boys even if she wasn’t a genius.

Afterwards, Lin Fei introduced them to one another.

Although Lin Fei said earlier that he needed to ask for Gu Ning’s permission if his friends wanted to see her, it was an accident today. His friends came to support him today because he was going to have the game with the exchange student from Country R.

Anyway, all of them thought that Gu Ning was much prettier than her photos.
