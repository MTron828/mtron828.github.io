Yang Kai took a deep breath, pondered for a while, and said, “I need to think about this.”

“Naturally. In any case, there’s still time. Please give me an answer after careful consideration.”

Luo Lan being able to say so already showed her sincerity.

Yang Kai solemnly replied, “Good, then I’ll have to ask Senior to remain here a few days. I will have an answer for you three days later.”

“Then this Queen will wait for good news. If you can accompany this Queen, I believe the journey will be much safer.”

.....

Three days later, Yang Kai and Luo Lan left Twin Shark Island together and set off for the Azure Tree Palace.

In all honesty, Space Spirit Crystals that Luo Lan mentioned being formed in the Void Cracks did not have much attraction to Yang Kai. Although these things were scarce, Yang Kai only needed to travel to a few more Cultivation Stars and he would be able to collect a sufficient amount.

With the financial and material resources he currently possessed, he did not have any problem purchasing a large amount of Space Spirit Crystals, it would only take him some time.

What really attracted Yang Kai’s attention was the Shocking Void Beast which could freely shuttle The Void!

This was an exotic ancient beast that lived in The Void, and its Monster Core was of great help to those who cultivated the Dao of Space. Currently, Yang Kai had reached a bottleneck in his cultivation of the Dao of Space and opening the Sealed World Bead had become extremely slow; however, if he could obtain the Shocking Void Beast’s Monster Core and use it as the primary material in a Spirit Pill, it would allow him to make a qualitative leap in his comprehension of the Dao of Space.

Since there would not be any Third-Order Origin Kings in the Severed World, Yang Kai had nothing to worry about.

He was confident that he could escape from a Second-Order Origin King with his current abilities.

As such, after three days of consideration, he agreed to Luo Lan’s request and decided to go with her to the Severed World.

Before leaving, Yang Kai ordered Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao to remain in the palace and told them that if a cultivator holding a token with the character for ‘High’ on it appeared suddenly, there was no need to panic because they were from High Heaven Sect. Just receive them courteously.

Although the Master and Disciple trio were confused, not understanding how someone would suddenly just appear in the palace, they did not ask anything and just accepted their task.

A few days later, Yang Kai and Luo Lan came to the Azure Tree Palace.

After arranging a room for Yang Kai to rest in, Luo Lan started making preparations. Since she was leaving Azure Tree Star on this trip, so naturally had many affairs to settle. She also had much to prepare to enter the Severed World.

As for Yang Kai though, he just sat in meditation in his room.

Gu Jian Xin was no longer here. According to Luo Lan, the Young Union Master of Sword Union had left more than a month ago, but he had repeatedly told Luo Lan to treat Yang Kai carefully.

Time flew by and soon a month had passed.

Yang Kai, who was meditating, received a Divine Sense Message from Luo Lan suddenly and immediately ended his retreat, opened the door, and walked out.

Outside the door, Luo Lan was waiting for him, and after seeing him come out, she gently nodded and led the way.

Outside the Azure Tree Palace, an Origin Grade Mid-Rank Starship had been prepared. The two entered the Starship, and not long after, it took off and headed towards the Star Field.

“The Severed World is located in a certain remote region of the Star Field and its entrance is wrapped in countless Void Cracks. Normally, it is impossible to enter, but once in a while, the surrounding Void Cracks stabilize, and the entrance can be opened. At that time, it is necessary for multiple Origin Kings to jointly execute a special Secret Technique. Once we get there, we will have to wait for some time before we can enter,” Luo Lan explained to Yang Kai as she led him through the Starship.

“Do you know the other Origin Kings who will be entering?” Yang Kai asked.

“I know some of them, and I will recognize the names of others even if I’ve never met them before; however, I won’t know all of them as the entry time for the Severed World isn’t fixed, so only those who receive the news and are hoping to search for opportunities or to break through will appear,” Luo Lan stopped in front of a certain room and said. “You can live here for the time being. If you need anything, just ask. We’ll arrive at our destination in about a month.”

Yang Kai nodded and entered the room.

Upon entering, Yang Kai walked over to the bed, sat down cross-legged, closed his eyes, and began cultivating.

Nothing happened over the next month, which Yang Kai spent entirely in meditation. Luo Lan did not come to visit him during this time, nor did any of the Sword Union cultivators disturb him.

It was not until one month later that Yang Kai felt the Starship stop.

Luo Lan’s voice sounded outside his room soon after, “Yang Kai.”

Yang Kai’s figure flickered, and he opened the door, nodding to Luo Lan lightly before the two of them walked out.

The Starship’s main hatch opened, and the two rushed out like lightning.

After the two left, the Starship turned around and sailed back along the path it took.

Standing in the void, Luo Lan looked left and right to get her bearings before speaking, “Follow me.”

Saying so, she summoned her Star Shuttle and began leading the way. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Two streams of light, one in front and one behind, soared through the vast, empty Star Field.

Yang Kai remained silent as he followed behind Luo Lan, avoiding the occasional asteroid and Starry Sky Storm they encountered.

He did not know how much time passed, but at a certain point, Yang Kai suddenly saw a circular object floating in the void up ahead that exuded a dazzling brilliance.

Even from far away, Yang Kai could feel the fluctuation of Space Force coming from this object.

“Is that...” Yang Kai turned his head and looked at Luo Lan.

“En, that’s the entrance,” Luo Lan relaxed after seeing the scene ahead. “It seems that we’ve arrived early. The entrance has not stabilized yet and cannot be opened temporarily.”

“The Space Force fluctuations coming from it are indeed chaotic...” Yang Kai muttered to himself.

“You can feel them?” Luo Lan looked at him in surprise.

“You know I am proficient in the Dao of Space. Why wouldn’t I be able to feel them?” Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

Luo Lan’s eyes lit up, “It really was a wise choice to bring you here. At this distance, I can only feel that there is danger up ahead. Even if a Third-Order Origin King wanted to break in, I am afraid they would meet a terrible end. I don’t know what will happen next, but Yang Kai, you have to remember, don’t expose your ability in front of other people here, otherwise...”

“I know,” Yang Kai interrupted her, how could he not understand the truth that an ordinary man is innocent, but treasures make one guilty? If his ability to read Space Force fluctuations was really exposed, he would instantly become the target of every Origin King present.

Luo Lan gently nodded and continued flying together with Yang Kai.

The closer the pair got to the entrance, the clearer Yang Kai could sense the Space Force fluctuations, his eyes gradually revealing a trace of excitement. Originally, he had followed Luo Lan on this trip primarily to hunt a Shocking Void Beast and obtain its Monster Core, but what he had not anticipated was that he would have some gains even just by reaching his place.

Others could only sense that there was danger surrounding the entrance, but Yang Kai could feel the essence of the Space Force coming from it. The chaotic fluctuations here helped him comprehend the mysteries of the Dao of Space and it was not long before he reached a state of enlightenment.

A few hours later, the two had already arrived not far from the entrance.

Observing from a close distance, this entrance was about five kilometres in length and exuded a white brilliance, but in front of the entrance, a pitch-black Void Crack would flit about like a fish from time to time.

These swimming Void Cracks blocked anyone from attempting to pass through the entrance and were no doubt the most dangerous barrier here.

Near the entrance, there were already several figures waiting. There were not many people present, only seven or eight, most of them alone, with only a few clearly in pairs.

Yang Kai didn’t dare to investigate too presumptuously because he knew that these people were basically all Origin Kings!

These people stood far apart, indicating that they were from different great forces and had no plans to join forces. Some had closed their eyes and were resting while others were looking about, their outfits all quite different.

When Luo Lan and Yang Kai arrived, they immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

“Elder Luo dares to come to this place?” Not far to the left, a hoarse voice suddenly called out with a hint of frivolousness.

Luo Lan heard this voice, furrowed her delicate brow, and glanced over towards its source, her expression fluctuating a few times before she quickly said, “So it is Elder Cui! Since Elder Cui can come, why can’t this Queen come?”

The man surnamed Cui chuckled, “This Cui certainly didn’t mean to imply that, but... the Severed World is extremely dangerous. Is Elder Luo not afraid she might accidentally perish inside?”

“Elder Cui need not concern himself with this Queen’s safety, he should instead worry about his own,” Luo Lan snapped back.

As soon as these two met, they began bickering like this, so obviously, they were quite familiar with one another and had grievances between them. Yang Kai stood beside Luo Lan, observing this man’s words and expressions but remaining silent, simply taking note of him in his heart.

The man surnamed Cui nearly choked on Luo Lan’s blunt remarks, but he did not show any annoyance, instead, just grinned lightly, “Elder Luo, although there are some misunderstandings between you and me, in the end, we’re both Elders of Sword Union. Since we’ve both come here, why not work together? That way, it will be much safer for everyone.”

“This Luo Lan will take Elder Cui’s kindness to heart, but... this Queen is not alone this time. Elder Cui should invite someone else,” Luo Lan replied lukewarmly, rejecting the other party’s proposal.

Yang Kai’s expression changed, only now realizing that this man surnamed Cui was also an Elder of Sword Union.

It seemed that he was an opponent from Sword Union’s Vice Union Master’s faction, otherwise, Luo Lan would not have treated him so coldly.

The man surnamed Cui glanced at Yang Kai thoughtfully as his eyes flashed like a poisonous snake and he said, “Elder Luo brought this little boy with her? Why has this old master never seen him before? Elder Luo bringing a Junior here... do you want him to gain something from the Severed World, or perhaps expect him to break through to the Origin King Realm?”
