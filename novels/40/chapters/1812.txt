Zi Dong’s eyes were completely dull.

Staring dumbfounded at the scene in front of him, all Zi Dong could see was Yang Kai using one killing move after another, causing Kong Fa to retreat in defeat again and again, his whole being simply unable to accept reality.

In a frontal confrontation, Yang Kai was able to completely suppress Kong Fa!

After just thirty breaths of time, Kong Fa had been driven to the point where all he could do was defend, with no spare power to counterattack.

Zi Dong could also see that Kong Fa’s movements were sluggish and his Saint Qi was not flowing smoothly, obviously a result of suppression from Yang Kai’s Domain. As such, despite both of them being at the peak of the First-Order Origin King Realm, Kong Fa was no match for Yang Kai in terms of Domain. Now, it was only a matter of time before Kong Fa lost his life.

Realizing this, Zi Dong felt an ominous premonition in his heart.

Xu Wei was already dead, so if Kong Fa also died, then Yang Kai’s next target would definitely be him.

These two Origin Kings were not Yang Kai’s opponents, so how could he, a mere Origin Realm cultivator, hope to resist?

What’s more, his father was currently being entangled by that ghostly guy and didn’t have any spare power to defend him.

[What should I do, what should I do?] Zi Dong wore a blank look as he did not know how to deal with this tricky situation.

At that moment, from the vortex Yang Kai had appeared from, another figure walked out. As soon as this person appeared, he let out a cry, “Young Hero, wait for me, I can’t find my way! Which way should...Huh? I’m out? Hahahaha, I, Lu Gui Chen, have finally escaped! I finally don’t have to stare at that damned place anymore!”

This man did not seem to understand the situation around him and as he left the vortex simply laughed madly, as if no one else was around.

[Who is this guy? Where did he come from?] Zi Dong looked over at Lu Gui Chen who suddenly appeared in astonishment, vaguely feeling the other party was something familiar, but unable to remember where he saw him before.

“No matter, let’s just catch him first. Since he came out with that bastard, he must be one of his people!” Zi Dong muttered as he flew over to Lu Gui Chen and grabbed his neck before coldly declaring, “Don’t move, if you dare try to resist, I’ll take your life!”

Lu Gui Chen was taken aback as sweat dripped down his body. Really not daring to move, nodding repeatedly, “I won’t move, I won’t move! This friend, I have something to say, don’t be too hasty...”

Saying so, Lu Gui Chen glanced over at Zi Dong.

Immediately though, Lu Gui Chen’s eyes lit up with pleasant surprise as he called out, “Young Master? Is that you, Young Master?”

“You call me Young Master?” Zi Dong was stunned and unconsciously let go, “Who are you?”

“Young Master!” Lu Gui Chen knelt down with a thud and literally hugged Zi Dong’s thigh with both hands, as if he could not have been happier to see him, tears streaming down his face and snot dripping from his nose as he cried out, “Young Master, this subordinate is Lu Gui Chen, Purple Sand Star’s Lu Gui Chen! Several dozen years ago, this subordinate was fortunate enough to meet Young Master once and received some pointers from Young Master. Has Young Master forgotten?”

“Lu Gui Chen?” Zi Dong frowned, feeling that the name was familiar but unable to recall it for some time. However, the look of joy on the other party’s face didn’t seem to be fake so there was no reason to doubt him. After frowning for a short time, Zi Dong suddenly remembered something and asked, “You’re from the Lu Family, a descendant of Lu Li?”

“Yes, yes, yes, that’s me!” Lu Gui Chen was overjoyed when he saw that the other party finally remembered him, “This subordinate thought that he would never see anyone from Purple Star ever again, but it turns out that the first person I get to see after escaping that damned place is the Young Master! It seems this subordinate’s luck has not yet dried up.”

“So, it’s you!” Zi Dong confirmed that the other party was actually from his Purple Star but his face remained slightly sullen as he waved his hand, “Get up and speak, didn’t you die several dozen years ago? How did you appear here?”

“Wu wu...” Despite his age, Lu Gui Chen cried openly and sobbed, “This matter... it’s a long story!”

“Make it short,” Zi Dong was focused on trying to deal with his current crisis, so he had no patience to listen to a drawn-out explanation.

“That’s...” Lu Gui Chen hurriedly picked out the most important details and explained them.

“So that’s the situation,” After listening, Zi Dong nodded. “You’ve worked hard for these past several dozen years.”

“It hasn’t been hard at all! Just being able to see Young Master again makes everything worth it!” Lu Gui Chen squeezed out a smile, making it sound like he had finally made some kind of great contributions after going through several dozen years of hard work.

Zi Dong felt somewhat disgusted but did not bother with Lu Gui Chen any further; after all, this man was just a Second-Order Saint King and couldn’t provide any help in this situation.

“By the way, Young Master, the Star Source of that floating continent has been refined by a young man. If you could capture him...”

“What?” Zi Dong’s expression changed, “That guy managed to refine the Star Source here?”

“En... although this subordinate did not see it with his own eyes, there is no doubt. En, that young man...” Lu Gui Chen glanced around and soon saw Yang Kai who was still engaged in battle with Kong Fa.

Just as he was about to say something though, Lu Gui Chen’s jaw fell slack...

Because he saw that Kong Fa was struggling to even survive against Yang Kai’s onslaught and was already severely wounded.

Several dozen Golden Blood Threads were flying around Yang Kai, each one like a living creature, slashing through the void at lightning speed, lacerating Kong Fa from time to time.

“Little Friend, please stop! This old master admits defeat!” Kong Fa’s expression turned grey as he shouted loudly while resisting the attacks of the Golden Blood Threads.

“If it was useful to admit defeat, why would anyone cultivate?” Yang Kai was not moved and waved his hand widely, “Moon Blade!”

*Chi...*

A one-metre-long Moon Blade suddenly took shape and cut vertically towards Kong Fa.

Kong Fa’s complexion changed drastically as he rapidly formed a series of seals with his hands, causing a dazzling brilliance to burst from his body and an ancient bell-shaped artifact to appear briefly before it transformed into a light curtain that covered his figure.

*Hong...*

A bell sound rang loudly, sending invisible shockwaves out that bombarded one’s soul.

The Moon Blade had impacted the light curtain but failed to break through it completely, only leaving a finger deep cut before it was stopped.

Seeing this, Kong Fa sighed with relief. His Resounding Emperor Bell was a treasure he obtained during a certain expedition in his earlier years. It was an Origin Grade defensive artifact and had yet to be broken by any of the enemies he faced.

With this Resounding Emperor Bell protecting him, Kong Fa was confident he could resist against a Second-Order Origin King for some time.

Seeing Yang Kai’s attack neutralized, Kong Fa felt a little more emboldened and snorted, “Does Little Friend insist on killing ruthlessly? We only met by chance, so we might as well part as friends.”

“Nonsense!” Yang Kai’s expression remained unchanged as he waved his hand again and again, “You think you’re safe behind that tortoiseshell of yours? Just watch how I break it!”

*Chi chi chi chi...*

More than a dozen massive Moon Blades shot towards Kong Fa one after another, causing his complexion to pale and horror to flash across his eyes. Pushing his Saint Qi wildly, Kong Fa poured all his strength into his Resounding Emperor Bell.

The bell’s ringing became louder and louder as the bell-shaped light curtain brightened dramatically.

*Hong Hong Hong Hong...*

One Moon Blade after another slashed at the Resounding Emperor Bell’s light curtain, shaking it greatly, as if it would break apart at any moment.

*Kacha...*

Finally, a sound Kong Fa’s deeply dreaded reached his ears and his eyes filled with panic as he stared forward and saw a crack appear in his Resounding Emperor Bell’s protective light curtain.

This crack spread to the surroundings extremely rapidly and it was not long before the light curtain became riddled with holes.

With one loud crash, the Resounding Emperor Bell’s protective shield was finally broken.

“Little Friend, please spare me!” Kong Fa paled as he pleaded.

“Die!” Yang Kai’s expression remained cold as he condensed several dozen Golden Blood Threads together into a giant golden longsword that shot forward together with a sharp Moon Blade.

The next moment, Kong Fa’s body stiffened in place.

Looking down at his chest, all Kong Fa could see was a bloody hole through which the broken pieces of his heart lay.

His vitality passed quickly and everything in front of him became dark.

“This... this old master...”

Kong Fa was not able to finish his words before his aura completely disappeared.

Yang Kai stretched out his hand and took away the Resounding Emperor Bell, tossing it into his Space Ring without looking at it before he also snatched Kong Fa’s Space Ring.

“You’re next!” Yang Kai suddenly turned around and glared coldly at the dumbfounded Zi Dong. With a light wave of his hand, Yang Kai sent a death blow to Zi Dong.

Zi Dong trembled in place. Although Yang Kai’s blow seemed light, he knew it was not something he could easily resist; after all, that was an Origin King’s attack.

Hurriedly, without even thinking about it, Zi Dong grabbed Lu Gui Chen by the neck and threw him forward.

“Young Master, you...” Lu Gui Chen was still immersed in the joy of seeing Zi Dong again and never expected such a thing to happen. By the time he reacted, it was already too late.

A strong pressure hit Lu Gui Chen in the next instant and without a word, his entire body exploded into blood mist.

“Man, you’re really cruel,” Yang Kai looked at Zi Dong sarcastically with a mocking expression on his face.

He was also quite surprised that Zi Dong would use such a method to defend against his attack.

It seemed this Young Master of Purple Star was rotten to the core.

Yang Kai hadn’t killed Lu Gui Chen on the floating continent and didn’t stop him from following him through the Void Corridor to leave it, mainly because Lu Gui Chen had provided him with some slightly useful information before.

Yang Kai did not deliberately help nor target him, leaving Lu Gui Chen to face his own destiny.

As such, it was somewhat laughable that, after escaping from the floating continent, this guy had been used as a shield by his force’s Young Master. Lu Gui Chen was probably already complaining of the injustice in the afterlife.

“But you’re still going to die!” Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

“What do you want to do?” Zi Dong turned pale, trying to act strong as he roared, “Little Brat, don’t think you can do whatever you want just because you’ve become an Origin King! I am the Young Master of Purple Star, you can’t kill me!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Being a Young Master of Purple Star, is that something special? Did your father tell you that the Young Master of Purple Star cannot be killed? Idiot, I really don’t know how you’ve managed to survive until now,” Yang Kai spat.

“Do you really want to kill me?” Zi Dong was shocked as he confirmed that Yang Kai wasn’t just trying to intimate him, “Do you know what the consequences will be after killing me? My Purple Star will never forgive you! Even if you flee to the ends of the Star Field, you won’t be safe!”
