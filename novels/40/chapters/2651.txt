The last time Yao Zhuo came to Ice Heart Valley was with Feng Xi to escort the bride back to their Sect, he suffered a great loss at Yang Kai’s hand. He was not only beaten up by Yang Kai taking advantage of an Emperor Authority Bead, but the Space Ring that contained the dowry and all his wealth was also robbed.

At that time, Yang Kai was just a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Junior.

That incident brought Yao Zhuo untold shame, so it was natural that his eyes were blazing with hatred when he finally met his enemy again today.

Yao Zhuo had always been strong, and now that he had broken through to the Third-Order Emperor Realm, his boundless aura was seemingly able to tear the world apart. An ordinary First-Order Emperor Realm Master couldn’t be his opponent, so he was confident Yang Kai would not be able to survive taking a slash of his blade.

“Yang Kai, watch out!”

“Senior Brother Yang, be careful!”

Bing Yun, Ji Yao, and the rest exclaimed anxiously for him.

However, Yang Kai just stood still instead of moving, as if he could not react to the situation and did not mean to avoid the attack at all. Bing Yun and the others were utterly nervous at the scene.

Yao Zhuo was overjoyed, further intensifying the power in his hand. The shining blade of light plummeted like a meteor, dazzling the eyes of its audience.

At that moment though, a mysterious shadow flashed across everyone’s vision, turning into a wisp of navy blue smoke as it passed by Yao Zhuo before coming to a stop behind him.

At the same time, Yao Zhuo, who was fiercely pouncing on Yang Kai, seemed to be affected by a petrifying technique and was frozen on the spot at once. The light of his Emperor Artifact blade dispersed and his Third-Order Emperor Realm aura deflated rapidly like a punctured balloon.

*Pu… *

Somehow, inexplicably, Yao Zhuo spurted a mouthful of blood, his face turning as pale as a sheet while he staggered and slumped over.

“What?” The people of Seeking Passion Sect were appalled as they stared at the navy blue light which appeared behind Yao Zhuo, their eyes filled with terror. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

A figure was gradually revealed as the wisp of blue light dissipated slowly. Meanwhile, the figure who had come out of nowhere stood behind Yao Zhuo leisurely, holding something in his hand.

*Dong Dong… Dong Dong… *

The pulsating sound of this thing hammered fear into the hearts of all who gazed upon it.

When they got a clear vision of the object held in this newcomer’s hand, they recognized it as a still warm and beating heart. The organ was about the size of a fist, and its thick arteries were clear and discernible; scarlet blood flowed out of it with each beat.

*Gudong… *

Nervous gulps could be heard one after another as everyone automatically turned their gazes to Yao Zhuo’s back. At a glance, their faces were ashen as they shivered in horror.

Because a hole could be seen on Yao Zhuo’s back, one through which everyone was able to see the scenery on the other side of his figure. Where Yao Zhuo’s heart once was, now there was just an empty hole!

The situation in front of them was crystal-clear; Yao Zhuo’s heart was gouged out by the middle-aged man in navy blue. To be able to do this to a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master like Yao Zhuo, the middle-aged man must have astonishing strength and technique.

“Who is he?”

“Is there anyone like him in the Northern Territory?”

Flabbergasted, everyone began speculating, but none had an answer.

“A Monster King!” Feng Xuan abruptly bellowed, seemingly recognizing something.

Meanwhile, Yao Zhuo looked down at the hole in his chest with difficulty, his face turned bloodless in an instant. He turned around and pleaded in a trembling voice, “Sect Master, save me…”

Thanks to his great strength, Yao Zhuo did not die immediately even though his heart was gouged out, and if Feng Xuan could retrieve his heart, perhaps he may still be able to recover from death with the supplement of some powerful healing pills. Therefore, Yao Zhuo used his tremendous cultivation to seal his blood circulation while pleading for rescue.

“Your Sect Master can’t even save himself now, let alone you!” Yang Kai sneered, and with a flick of his fingers, he sent a Moon Blade towards Yao Zhuo.

In normal times, Yao Zhou could certainly resolve an attack like this even if he could not dodge it; but now, with most of his strength being used to suppress his mortal injuries, how could he have the spare capacity to defend himself?

With a slash, Yao Zhuo was directly sliced into two pieces by the Moon Blade, his severed body falling from the sky, crashing into a lump of mashed meat on the ground.

A Third-Order Emperor Realm Master was killed just like that!

Everyone from the Seeking Passion Sect was muted, their eyes were filled with terror.

*Pu… *

Ying Fei crushed the heart in his hand before sweeping his piercing eyes across the people of the Seeking Passion Sect, asking calmly, “Young Master Yang, is it them?”

Yang Kai nodded affirmatively, “En.”

The corners of Ying Fei’s mouth curled upwards slightly, “How should I deal with them, Young Master Yang?”

Yang Kai snorted, “What else is there to ask? Kill them all!”

Ying Fei nodded, and in the next moment, his body abruptly turned into a ray of navy blue light, diving straight into the remaining nineteen Emperor Realm Masters, darting back and forth among them dauntlessly.

Everyone from the Seeking Passion Sect was sent into a flurry, dodging and resisting to the best of their abilities in a panic.

Feng Xuan roared with rage as his Wind and Thunder Divine Spear turned into a gale and shot towards Ying Fei.

Among everyone here, only his cultivation could match Ying Fei’s, so only he could possibly stop him. However, Ying Fei’s true form was that of a giant eagle, and he had an innate advantage in terms of speed. It seemed that Ying Fei was creating panic on purpose instead of facing Feng Xuan directly, swaying here and there in the crowd, then retreating without getting caught.

*Pu pu pu… *

After a few muffled thuds, several Emperor Realm Masters raised their heads and spurted blood. When the others turned to them, they saw that the chest cavities where their allies’ hearts were originally located were all gouged out.

This situation was exactly the same as what Yao Zhuo encountered before.

Turning their heads to Ying Fei’s hands, as expected, there were several hearts in various sizes beating in them now.

With a hard squeeze, those hearts were crushed.

The faces of the several injured Emperor Realm Masters were ashen, and after a brief shudder, all of them fell from the sky. Although they could still survive with this kind of injury a while longer with their cultivation, their hearts were dug out and destroyed, so recovery was almost impossible and death would be their ultimate fate.

In the blink of an eye, five Emperor Realm Masters had fallen. Panic spread among the Seeking Passion Sect group at once. The remaining Emperor Realm Masters looked at Ying Fei like they were looking at the devil from Hell; they did not dare to fight him and secretly wished that they could leave this damned place as soon as possible.

On the other side, the morale of Ice Heart Valley soared. The anxiety and resigned look in the eyes of the beauties were all swept away, replaced with brilliant radiance.

“How dare a trivial Monster King act impudent in front of this King!” Feng Xuan was infuriated. He was aware that his forces had suffered a terrible blow to morale, so his most important task now was to bolster their spirits.

At this point, there was no turning back for Seeking Passion Sect and Ice Heart Valley; one of them had to die today. Initially, Feng Xuan was full of confidence in this siege, but the sudden emergence of this Monster King turned the situation on its head, so it was natural that Feng Xuan hated him to the core and wanted to kill him first in order to stabilize the emotions of his people.

“A trivial Monster King? How about two then?” A thunder-like voice boomed, followed by a flash of lightning which then turned into a burly figure, standing side by side with Ying Fei.

Xi Lei!

“If two is not enough, what about three!”

Another figure walked out leisurely and stood beside Ying Fei and Xi Lei.

The three Monster Kings gathered together, no longer trying to conceal themselves. Their Monster Qi surged from their bodies, causing the sky to shake.

The remaining Emperor Realm Masters of Seeking Passion Sect instantly trembled in fear as they became aware of the power of these three. Even Feng Xuan’s face turned pale as he stared in disbelief.

Although Monster Kings were theoretically on par with Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters in terms of cultivation, due to their sensitive racial identities, they seldom travelled around the Human world, and most of the time, just hid in the mountains and deep forests, reigning over those lands.

Of course, there were also some powerful Monster Race who took refuge in Human Sects, holding lofty positions such as Elders or Protectors.

But such cases were extremely small in number.

Feng Xuan never thought that there could be three Monster Kings gathered together in this world, and furthermore, they were all here to target his Seeking Passion Sect.

In an instant, Feng Xuan’s mouth filled with such bitterness he nearly choked. If it was just a single Monster King, he would still have the spirit to resist, but now that there were three of them, he knew that Seeking Passion Sect would be no match even if Yao Zhuo was resurrected from the dead.

“Three Monster Kings!?”

“Where did Senior Brother Yang get them from?”

“Did he go to get help when he went out? I thought he ran away after seeing our Ice Heart Valley in dire straits. Shame on me!”

“This time we’re saved, we’re saved!”

……

The Emperor Realm Masters of Ice Heart Valley who did not know the truth were overjoyed and gazed at Yang Kai with gratitude filled eyes.

Now they finally knew why Yang Kai could kill ten Emperor Realm Masters in one fell swoop. With three Monster Kings at his side, what were the ten Emperor Realm Masters to him?

“What’s the situation?” Seeing that Xi Lei and Xie Wu Wei had arrived together, Yang Kai asked with a slight relief in his heart.

Xie Wu Wei replied, “We killed about ten thousand, but there’s still a lot of trash left behind. All of those leftovers lost the will to fight though.”

“Ten thousand…”

All of a sudden, everyone on Seeking Passion Sect’s side faltered.

They did not doubt Xie Wu Wei’s words, because it would obviously not be difficult for two Monster Kings to kill ten thousand people. After all, there were no Emperor Realm Masters on their side left to impede these Monster Kings.

All the Sects who participated in this campaign had surely suffered immense losses if ten thousand of their disciples had died, and that wasn’t enough considering the deaths of their Emperor Realm Masters. After this war, the overall strength of the Northern Territory would surely decrease.

But what concerned these Emperors the most was their own fate. Previously, they came to Ice Heart Valley in an imposing manner, thinking that victory was within their grasps. However, the tables were turned in the blink of an eye, and now, they were the fishes waiting on the chopping board.

“Senior Bing Yun, leave this to us. You’d best oversee the situation in the valley,” Yang Kai turned to Bing Yun.

After pondering for a while, Bing Yun nodded in agreement, “Good!”

The outcome here was already decided; Ice Heart Valley was destined to win this war. However, the hundred thousand or so enemy forces still occupying Ice Heart Valley were not to be underestimated, even if they were now a disorderly mob. A mere seven thousand disciples of Ice Heart Valley would not be able to resist such a disadvantage in numbers. Fortunately, the Monster Kings had crushed the enemy’s spirits already which would greatly reduce the losses Ice Heart Valley suffered.

What Bing Yun and her Disciples needed to do now was return to clean up the mess and preserve as many Ice Heart Valley disciples as possible.
