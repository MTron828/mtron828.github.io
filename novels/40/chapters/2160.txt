*Hong...*

A violent bang erupted along with a shockwave of energy from the spot where Yang Kai once stood.

“Courting death...” Kong Qi looked ahead and coldly snorted while at the same time he carefully searched the chaotic area for the Space Ring Yang Kai should have left behind after his death.

But he was unable to find anything.

“Could even his Space Ring have been destroyed?” Kong Qi’s face went slightly pale, not because of the amazing strength the blood monster displayed, but because Yang Kai’s Space Ring and all its contents had been lost. Regardless of whether Yang Kai originally had anything good in his Space Ring, just the two unusual spirit fruits from this room were absolutely extraordinary.

If Yang Kai’s Space Ring had really exploded due to the blood monster’s attack, its contents would have been exiled to the Void and lost forever.

As Kong Qi became somewhat absent-minded from this shock, the blood monster roared wildly again as a bright red light burst from its body, illuminating the surrounding room.

“What now?” Kong Qi frowned as he hurriedly leapt up in the air to avoid the red light.

At the same time, a blood-red light spread across the entire hall, forming a barrier around it that sealed all entrances and exits!

The next moment, at one of the exits, the red light curtain caved in slightly as a figure mysteriously appeared, looking like it had bounced off the barrier.

“It can even do something like this?” Yang Kai was shocked as he raised his fist and punched towards the light curtain.

Unexpectedly though, despite this light curtain looking quite thin, it was extremely tough, so Yang Kai’s fist was only able to leave a dent in it that was rapidly restored.

“You...” Kong Qi who was floating in the air suddenly gasped, as if he was seeing a ghost, pointing at Yang Kai in surprise and muttering, “Didn’t you die?”

A First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator had actually emerged unscathed after taking a blow like that from this strange blood monster, and had even taken advantage of the chaos to flee towards the exit. If it weren’t for the blood monster’s alertness and its strange method of sealing up the exit, this odd boy might have escaped...

At that time, the furious blood monster would naturally vent its anger on Kong Qi. In other words, Yang Kai would have gotten away with all the benefits, leaving Kong Qi to clean up the mess...

“Insidious little brat, you’re too vicious! Are you even human!?” After Kong Qi understood what had happened, he cursed angrily, wishing he could rush down and join forces with the blood monster to beat Yang Kai to a pulp.

“Haha, nice to meet you, Brother Kong. How are you today?” Yang Kai greeted Kong Qi slightly awkwardly. He was indeed planning to escape after faking his death, leaving Kong Qi alone to deal with the blood monster, but unfortunately, his plan had been foiled when the exit was blocked.

“Nice to meet you my ass!” Kong Qi snorted, “However, after you die, I think I’ll be better!”

He and Yang Kai had never met before, but Kong Qi’s first impression of Yang Kai could not possibly have been worse. Kong Qi felt that Yang Kai was a treacherous and vile snake that should be avoided at all costs, so naturally, he did not give him any face.

Yang Kai didn’t mind though and simply smiled, “Brother Kong need not be so upset; after all, as the saying goes, we rely on our parents at home, and our friends when we go out...”

“Who is your friend?” Kong Qi interrupted him without waiting for him to finish.

“Good...” Yang Kai’s expression turned solemn as his figure flickered to avoid the blood monster’s killer blow. Since he secretly took the two Flowing Time Fruits, the blood monster seemed to only care about him now, treating him as if he had killed his father while completely ignoring Kong Qi.

The blood monster was powerful, but Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space, so it wasn’t difficult for Yang Kai to avoid this opponent, but what kept Yang Kai alert was the strange Blood Qi which was emanating from this monster’s body. This Blood Qi seemed to be highly corrosive and was constantly wearing down his Source Qi, trying to invade his body and cause trouble.

While avoiding the attacks of the blood monster, Yang Kai shouted, “Brother Kong, are you not going to come up and help me kill this blood monster?”

Kong Qi crossed his arms and stared down at him leisurely, sneering as he said, “Why should I help you? What does your life or death have to do with me?”

“Brother Kong is slightly mistaken there!” Yang Kai shook his head, his words coming out slightly intermittently as he continued to rapidly dodge the blood monster’s assault, “You understand that this hall has now been sealed up by this creature. Only if this thing dies will we be able to escape. Is Brother Kong willing to be trapped here permanently?”

Kong Qi smiled and said, “I can just wait to kill it after it kills you!”

Yang Kai snickered in response, “I’ll be frank then. Brother Kong, although your strength isn’t bad, if you want to kill this guy single-handedly, won’t it be a bit difficult?”

Kong Qi’s face twitched slightly as, although he didn’t want to admit it, what Yang Kai said was correct.

Before Yang Kai came here, Kong Qi was still confident he could easily take down this blood monster, but judging from the combat power it was showing at the moment, it was obvious this creature had been hiding its strength before.

Even if Kong Qi used his trump cards, he would have to pay a steep price if he wanted to kill this blood monster on his own.

What’s more, there was no way to tell what other dangers lurked inside this place, so Kong Qi was unwilling to use too much power unless he was forced to.

Realizing this, Kong Qi’s brow furrowed as he stared at Yang Kai and said deeply, “Your Excellency seems to be quite extraordinary!”

It was only now that he suddenly discovered that Yang Kai was still freely chatting with him while dealing with this blood monster! This was definitely not something a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator could do. Combined with his previous strange methods, Kong Qi can’t help wondering which Sect this guy had come from to have such unusual strength. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Brother Kong is too polite! This Yang is just a little confident in his Movement Skill,” when Yang Kai spoke, he stopped in mid-air and waited for the attack of the blood monster to arrive in front of his eyes before disappearing suddenly, as if he was showing off deliberately.

“Just your Movement Skill...” Kong Qi murmured to himself as he kept his thoughts on the matter hidden, instead shouting, “It’s not impossible for me to make a move now, but since you took away...”

“You can have one!” Yang Kai seemed to know what he was going to say and immediately replied.

Just after he finished speaking, something flew out from Yang Kai’s hand, causing Kong Qi to frown, reach out, and catch this object, soon discovering that it was one of the spirit fruits which had been placed on the long table before!

[Just like that?]

Yang Kai’s move made Kong Qi quite confused.

“Since Brother Kong and I will be joining forces to kill this enemy, dividing the spoils in half is only fair. You don’t have any problems now, right? You wouldn’t want to monopolize...” Yang Kai’s voice came out again.

Kong Qi carefully checked the spirit fruit in his hand to make sure it was not some kind of fake before solemnly storing it into his Space Ring and saying indifferently, “Although you are a little unpleasant, since you’ve shown enough sincerity, this Kong will cooperate with you!”

Yang Kai grinned, “Brother Kong understands well!”

“Hmph, keep it occupied. It will take a while for this Kong to perform this move.” Saying so, Kong Qi’s Source Qi flared while at the same time he flipped his wrist and a golden coin appeared on the palm of his hand. With a loud shout, Kong Qi then began to madly pour his Source Qi into this coin.

Seeing this, Yang Kai didn’t know what kind of Secret Technique Kong Qi was going to use, only that it apparently needed to be channeled through this strange golden coin artifact. However, judging from Kong Qi’s movements, this move was sure to be extraordinary, so Yang Kai dedicated himself to keeping the blood monster occupied.

Kong Qi acting this way was also because of a strong sense of self-confidence. Although he thought Yang Kai was unusual for a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, he didn’t believe Yang Kai was stronger than him. Yang Kai being able to deal with the blood monster for so long was probably because of his outstanding Movement Skill and speed, but if Kong Qi wanted to cause fatal damage to the blood monster, he needed to rely on himself.

As such, he assumed the role of attacker.

Yang Kai did not disappoint him as expected, leading the blood monster around the hall with ease. On the contrary, as the power fluctuations from Kong Qi grew more intense, it was the blood monster that seemed to feel faintly uneasy and become more irritable.

At a certain moment, the blood monster finally gave up chasing Yang Kai and instead turned its odd head towards Kong Qi while revealing a pair of scarlet eyes. Roaring madly, its huge body turned into a blood-red mass of light that shot towards Kong Qi.

Kong Qi narrowed his eyes and almost gave up preparing his Secret Technique to dodge.

At the critical moment though, Yang Kai’s figure flashed in front of him and waving his hands, summoned dozens of Golden Blood Threads. The room filled with golden light as the countless Golden Blood Threads wove together to form a giant golden shield.

*Hong...*

The blood-red light smashed onto the golden blood shield and its massive body was immediately revealed as it was forced backwards several metres. At the same time, the golden shield unravelled and transformed back into Golden Blood Threads.

Yang Kai stretched out his hand to take back his Golden Blood Threads while shouting in a deep voice, “Brother Kong, if you’re ready, do it quickly, I can’t block a second hit!”

“You’re in luck because I’m prepared!” Kong Qi smiled before his face grew solemn and he turned his hand, tossing out the golden coin in front of him while uttering, “Falling Golden Coins!”

*Xiu xiu xiu...*

The single golden coin floating in front of Kong Qi suddenly split into two, then four, then eight...

In the blink of an eye, golden coins filled the air.

Every coin danced lightly through the air as they spun rapidly as some grew larger while others shrank down.

Under the guidance of Kong Qi’s Divine Sense, these countless coins then flew out towards the blood monster.

The blood monster seemed to sense a threat from this attack and hurriedly retreated, but no matter how fast it was, how could it escape from this strange artifact?

In the blink of an eye, the blood monster was overtaken by the first golden coin which on impact began exuding a strange suppressive force, restraining its movements.

Immediately afterwards, the second and third coins fell, inserted themselves into the body of the blood monster, and slowed its movement even further.

As more and more coins fell, the blood monster was quickly suppressed and it was not long before its entire body was covered by innumerable golden coins.
