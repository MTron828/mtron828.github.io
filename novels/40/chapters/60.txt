Chapter 61 - I owe you a favour

Why would Long Zai Tian go against him? Kai Yang took a glance at the forlorn and ashamed Hu Mei Er, the reason became clear.

Some things were better left unsaid. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Hu Mei Er was also a bright and intelligent girl, and although Kai Yang only glanced at her, she still understood the reason for his gaze.

“Grandpa forbade you from entering the mine, and I am unable to not give him face. How about this, I will go and buy those seeds in your place and you wait for me here.” Hu Mei Er suggested.

“Okay.” Kai Yang knew this was the only way, and immediately went to give all of his valuable possessions to her before telling her the names of the disciple who possessed the seeds. That time in the Black Wind Trade area, he had gotten all the relevant information from the booth owner.

Hu Mei Er entered the underground mine, while Kai Yang’s eyes swept over the holes in the ground. When Long Zai Tian had left, he had entered one of the houses, and Kai Yang could sense that within that house a pair of eyes were staring at him intently.

Inside the house, a pair of eyes were currently fixed on Kai Yang’s position.

He had watched when Long Zai Tian had struck out at Kai Yang earlier, he was about the same age as Kai Yang. He was Long Zai Tian’s grandson, Long Hui!

Long Hui was currently looking at Kai Yang coldly and said somewhat discontentedly: “Grandpa, why didn’t you kill him back then?”

Long Zai Tian laughed coldly: “With Mei Er’s protection, how do you expect me to kill him?”

“All the more reason to kill him. I have never seen little sister Hu Mei Er spend so much effort for any man and that youngster’s relationship with Mei Er isn’t shallow. To allow him to live, will only cause problems.”

“En, we have never seen Hu Mei Er protect someone like that. And for him, she actually dared to go against me, which is very unusual.” Long Zai Tian’s eyebrows creased.

Long Hui was extremely jealous: “Now that Mei Er has entered the mine, how about grandpa attacks again?”

Long Zai Tian looked at Long Hui resentfully, he wanted to comply: “There is no problem with me attacking him, to kill him is no hard task. But, if because of his death, it causes Mei Er to harbour resentment towards you, do you think it is worth it?”

Long Hui looked on blankly before shaking his head: “It’s not worth it, but are we really going to allow him to continue his relationship with Hu Mei Er? I can’t bear it.”

“You!” Long Zai Tian couldn’t help but let out a breath, “Learn more from your older brother and see how he treats the women that he likes. If you want Mei Er, you must use more of your mind. Grandpa can help you kill people, but I can’t possibly help you acquire a female’s heart right? Hu Man does not have any sons, only Jiao Er and Mei Er these two daughters, so if you and your older brother able to obtain these two, then in the future, the Blood Group would belong to my Long family! In all three generations of my Long family, we have put decades of work into helping Blood Group so we deserve the taste of being the sect head!”

Hearing this caused Long Hui to become hot-blooded as he nodded his head: “It should be time for my Long family to become the master family. Relax grandpa, Mei Er won’t be able to escape and over on big brother’s side, Hu Jiao Er will definitely be captured.”

“En, seeing that you have resolve is good.” Long Zai Tian smiled at him.

Long Hui was full of venom, he blamed things on the distant Kai Yang. With a bit of restlessness he said: “Grandpa, that person.......”

“You go find the opportunity yourself. His strength isn’t high, so you should be able to cope.”

“Yes!” Long Hui laughed sinisterly.

Although he couldn’t do anything now since Hu Mei Er would return shortly, Kai Yang was still a Sky Tower disciple, so he wouldn’t be able to run far.

Kai Yang waited outside for a short while before Hu Mei Er came out, sweating all over. Her face full of smiles, she stuffed fours seeds into Kai Yang’s hands: “Fortunately it wasn’t life threatening.”

The young lady of the Blood Group wanted to purchase some things, so which disciple dared to not sell?

“Many thanks!” Kai Yang very carefully placed the four seeds within his chest area pocket.

After standing in his original position for a while, Kai Yang struggled before saying: “You have helped me this time, I owe you a favor.”

Hu Mei Er looked at Kai Yang strangely: “What do you mean?”

Waving his hand, Kai Yang said: “Why don’t you follow me!”

Although Hu Mei Er didn’t know what he wanted to do, she obediently followed him over.

After walking about thirty feet, Kai Yang unexpectedly stopped and stamped his foot: “I want you to remember this place. About seventy feet below here, there should be some unusual things.”

Hu Mei Er eyes widened in doubt: “How do you know?”

Kai Yang muttered a bit indistinctly: “The martial skill that I am practising, within a certain distance, I can sense all Yang attributed things. Underneath here there should be a Yang attributed treasure and its Yang energy fluctuations are many times more pure than the Bright Yang Stones.”

Before coming here, Kai Yang had already sensed that in this area was a bit unusual and after considering it, he decided to tell Hu Mei Er. One reason was, due the this area belonging to the Blood Group, even if Kai Yang wanted these treasures, he couldn’t obtain them. Secondly, he still owed Hu Mei Er a favour and Kai Yang saw everything she did as she helped him today.

“Ah?” Hearing Kai Yang’s words, Hu Mei Er became frightened.

“Do you believe me?”

“I believe!” Hu Mei Er replied very frankly, making Kai Yang feel a bit moved.

“That’s good then.” Smiling lightly: “Even though I do not know what is below, its value definitely isn’t low. Also, apart from that, there seems to be something else too, for the specifics, I can’t sense it. But from my guesses, the secret hidden below should be the peculiar mystery that your Blood Group has been trying solve regarding the mine. It’s extremely possible it’s because of their existence, that this ore vein exists.”

Hu Mei Er couldn’t help but be moved. If what Kai Yang said was true, then the secret hidden underneath was extremely important.

“You are an intelligent girl, so you should know how to act.” Kai Yang solemnly urged her.

“I understand.” Hu Mei Er kept on nodding her head.

“Okay then, let’s go.” He smiled as he said this.

“En.”

Walking through the forest, Hu Mei Er and Kai Yang didn’t speak, but instead enjoyed the warmth of the forest together.

Hu Mei Er was extremely joyful because Kai Yang had told her such important information. It was evident that his impression of her had changed greatly, unlike last time when he had simply disregarded her and ordered her around.

This time was different, he was much gentler and softer with her.

“We shall part here.” Abruptly, Kai Yang stopped his steps, while Hu Mei Er looked distracted, showing her unwillingness. In the blink of an eye, the two people had arrived at the four way intersection; time passed by so quickly! Hu Mei Er was grieving slightly.

“Goodbye.” Kai Yang hurriedly said this and rushed back to Sky Tower Pavilion.

He really isn’t an easily swayed man! Hu Mei Er laughed out bitterly, trying to cope.
