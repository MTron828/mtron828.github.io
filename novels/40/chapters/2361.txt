While Yang Kai was at a loss, a sudden noise erupted from a short distance away, followed by a figure rising into the air and landing not far from him.

When he saw this man, Yang Kai’s face changed and he quickly took Liu Xian Yun and retreated, pulling some distance between them and the man.

It turned out to be Yao Chang Jun!

Yang Kai did not see Yao Chang Jun when they were being swallowed up by the vortex previously so he had no idea whether he had been swallowed in before or after him. Regardless, his appearance here meant that he must not have been able to escape that catastrophe just now either, and fell together with them in this place.

Yao Chang Jun’s current state was completely miserable. His clothes were in tatters and his white hair was messy, his body covered in blood and even his aura was a little unstable. He had clearly suffered a strong backlash from fighting against the suction force earlier.

Yang Kai had given up on resisting because of what Liu Xian Yun told him, so even though he wasn’t looking too good at the moment, he was undoubtedly in a much better state than Yao Chang Jun.

[This guy is actually alive!] Yang Kai had to admire this old man’s powerful cultivation. As expected of a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master. Even though his Soul was heavily injured, it still wasn’t that easy to kill him off.

“It’s you, vile animal!” Yao Chang Jun soon discovered Yang Kai and his face turned cold, murderous intent surging.

If not for Yang Kai, then why would he have taken the risk of chasing him into the Solitary Void Mountain Range’s depths? If he had not chased him there, then how would he have come across the Solitary Void Great Maelstrom? Right now, the one responsible for all his misfortunes was Yang Kai, so he was naturally red-eyed seeing his enemy.

Just as he was about to take a strike at Yang Kai, another noise came from some distance away and another figure popped out from under the dirt.

This took both Yang Kai and Yao Chang Jun by surprise; however, after looking over and having a clear look at the newcomer’s appearance, the two of them were quickly relieved.

That was because the third person to appear was none other than Marsh City’s City Lord, Pang Guang!

Yao Chang Jun had known about Pang Guang’s presence behind them, but he was so intent on finding Yang Kai that he didn’t pay any attention to him, ending up with Pang Guang also being caught in the disaster at Solitary Void Mountain Range. Naturally, Pang Guang was powerless to resist and was sucked into this place as well.

But Yao Chang Jun was slightly surprised to find Pang Guang in a better situation than he was. His body was only slightly messy and he wasn’t injured in the slightest, instead being filled with vigour.

“The two of you are alright too?” As soon as Pang Guang came out, he was surprised to see Yang Kai and Yao Chang Jun facing off with each other.

Yao Chang Jun coldly snorted, “Did you wish for something to happen to this Old Master?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Seeing Pang Guang’s appearance, he knew that this man understood the way to avoid the engulfing force, and that was why he came out intact. On the contrary, he who had been living anonymously in Marsh City for two hundred years ended up in such a pitiful mess that his pride couldn’t bear it for a moment.

After suffering a big loss from Yao Chang Jun, Pang Guang did not dare to act recklessly in front of him anymore. Embarrassedly, he smiled, “Naturally, it can’t be better for Senior to be fine. This Pang was just asking casually, just casually.”

Yang Kai smirked, “City Lord Pang is being a bit too insincere. Since you knew how to avoid danger, why didn’t you tell Senior Yao? You clearly wanted Senior Yao to enter the cycle of reincarnation early. Senior Yao, if I were you, I wouldn’t be able to bear it. I’d definitely want to give him a beating to vent my anger.”

Pang Guang’s face sank and he carefully observed Yao Chang Jun; seeing that the latter appeared indifferent, with no emotion showing through on his face, he relaxed at once and shouted, “Shut your mouth, little brat! This King has not even settled the score with you for killing this King’s subordinates and robbing this King’s property! Senior Yao is a hidden Senior expert and his insight is clear as a flame. His vision is truly sharp, so how could he be riled by your instigations?!”

While speaking, he turned his head to look at Yao Chang Jun and cupped his fists, “Senior, though I have a grudge with this little brat, it is just a trivial matter. Senior is the respected one here so if you wish to kill him, then this Junior will only watch and will definitely not intervene.”

Yao Chang Jun glanced at him lightly and suddenly said, “You have been tailing this Old Master this whole time. Was that also just to watch?”

Pang Guang’s forehead was instantly covered in a cold sweat and his mouth was twitching, “Senior has misunderstood. This Pang entered the Solitary Void Mountain Range because this Pang had something to do, definitely not to follow Senior.”

Yao Chang Jun coldly snorted. He did not answer but instead kept up an arrogant look. Even though he had been injured quite a bit when he was sucked in by the vortex, he still didn’t put Pang Guang or Yang Kai in his eyes. Earlier, he had been injured by Yang Kai at the teahouse merely because he was not cautious enough.

But in his current state, it would be best not to start anything with Pang Guang if he could help it; after all, he was not in peak condition and Pang Guang was still a First-Order Emperor Realm cultivator in the end. If they really were to fight, then even if he could kill Pang Guang, a price would have to be paid to do so.

“Senior, is this place the legendary Solitary Void Sealed World?” Seeing him remain silent, Pang Guang felt a little nervous and quickly changed the subject.

“Solitary Void Sealed World?” Yang Kai couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows when he heard that.

He was most interested in figuring what sort of damned place they were in right now. Unlike Pang Guang and Yao Chang Jun, he had only come to Marsh City recently, so these two were obviously better informed about local legends than him, causing Yang Kai’s ears to perk up and listen with interest.

“If you know, then why ask this Old Master?” Yao Chang Jun snorted, clearly not looking kindly upon him.

Pang Guang said embarrassedly, “This Pang really did not expect that the Solitary Void Sealed World actually existed. This Pang has been the City Lord of Marsh City for hundreds of years, but this Pang never expected to see this sight with his own eyes.”

“What place is the Solitary Void Sealed World, and how do we get out?” Yang Kai quickly asked.

Pang Guang’s face turned stiff and he shouted, “Why is a brat like you asking so many questions? Just stay here quietly and wait to die.”

Yang Kai’s face darkened, “City Lord Pang. No matter what grudges we had before, we are now locusts on the same rope. If you know any information, why not share it? It’s not like I killed your father or stole your wife, so why act so petty?”

Pang Guang sneered, “Those on different paths do not counsel each other. This King has nothing to say to you. We can talk about that again if you can live under Senior Yao’s hand.”

After Yang Kai offended Yao Chang Jun, Pang Guang had long since regarded the former as a dead man in his heart, so how could he bother chatting with him? After he was done, Pang Guang looked at Yao Chang Jun and said with a fawning smile, “Senior, the Solitary Void Sealed World only exists in legend. It is easy to enter, but difficult to leave. This Pang wonders if Senior has any good ideas?”

The speed with which his face changed was faster than one could flip a book.

Yang Kai laughed, “So, you don’t know how to get out either?”

Pang Guang snorted, “What’s there to laugh about? Careful or your teeth will fall out while you laugh...”

As he was talking, Pang Guang suddenly frowned and sniffed the air, asking suspiciously, “What’s that smell?”

A strange aroma suddenly wafted out in the air, shaking one’s spirit.

Yang Kai and Yao Chang Jun had obviously smelled it as well, and both of them were very familiar with that smell. After exchanging glances, they coincidentally recalled something and called out at the same time, “Heavenly Restoration Lotus!”

At the end of their sentence, the two of them had already begun rushing towards the source of that smell.

Meanwhile, Pang Guang was stunned for a moment, but when he heard the words, ‘Heavenly Restoration Lotus’, his face changed and he followed them swiftly from behind as well.

Even though both Pang Guang and Yao Chang Jun were Emperor Realm Masters, they were naturally not as fast as Yang Kai in terms of the explosive speed his comprehension of the Dao of Space afforded him. In just an instant, Yang Kai had already arrived at the source of the fragrance.

This pile of mud was clearly transported over from the Solitary Void Mountain Range, and the soil was quite loose.

Yang Kai reached his hand right into a mud pile and grabbed something. After feeling the size of the object and the aura fluctuating around it, he was overjoyed and was just about to stuff it into his Space Ring.

“You court death boy!” Yao Chang Jun howled as he thrust his palm out, stirring up the air and sending it straight towards Yang Kai.

He didn’t dare to use his full strength for fear of damaging the spirit flower; however, this palm was still beyond Yang Kai’s ability to resist.

Yang Kai grunted and forcefully circulated his strength to teleport away once more.

*Hong...*

The mud pile was smashed into dust, leaving behind a huge crater in its place. The newly formed island shook a few times as if it were going to collapse at any moment.

Yao Chang Jun stood in place with an ashen face, looking towards one direction with cold eyes.

Pang Guang also paused, an incredulous look on his face. Yang Kai was actually able to evade Yao Chang Jun’s attack, which was something beyond what Pang Guang thought possible. Even he himself may not have been able to dodge that blow.

“What is Senior so angry for? That was really scary,” Yang Kai said while shaking the dirt off his hand, revealing the spirit flower’s true appearance.

The herb was quite clearly the Heavenly Restoration Lotus, and both its size and form were exactly the same as the one Liu Xian Yun obtained before. The only difference was that that one was pure white without the slightest flaw while this one was as black as ink.

The Heavenly Restoration Lotus had always come in a pair. Liu Xian Yun was able to chance upon one of them before this, but none of them knew why she wasn’t able to find the second.

Now, with the appearance of the Solitary Void Great Maelstrom, large amounts of spirit herbs and dirt have been devoured and sent to this island. By coincidence, the second Heavenly Restoration Lotus also appeared.

Looking at the Heavenly Restoration Lotus in Yang Kai’s hand, Yao Chang Jun suddenly felt short of breath.

He spent two hundred years waiting in Marsh City, and for what? Wasn’t it for none other than the Heavenly Restoration Lotus? If only he could get his hands on the Heavenly Restoration Lotus and have someone refine it into the Twin Heavenly Restoration Pill, then his injuries could finally be healed. Then, he would be able to restore his strength to peak condition and get revenge on his enemies.

But... After waiting bitterly for two hundred years, the Heavenly Restoration Lotus may have appeared, but his good fortune was ruined by Yang Kai over and over again.

The first one was snatched away by Yang Kai while he wasn’t paying attention, and the same went for the second one as well.

Yao Chang Jun’s lungs were bursting with anger. He seemed to have never suffered such a big loss since he advanced to the Emperor Realm. What’s more, these misfortunes were piled on top of him by a little brat in the Dao Source Realm.

Looking at the Heavenly Restoration Lotus in Yang Kai’s hand, and seeing him slowly stuff it into his Space Ring, Yao Chang Jun forcibly endured the notion of grabbing it now and quickly said, “Little brat, if you hand the Heavenly Restoration Lotus to this Old Master, then not only will this Old Master let the past be, this Old Master will also take you out of this place.”

Upon hearing this, Pang Guang’s eyes lit up and he quickly said, “Senior Yao must bring me along as well when you leave.”

Yao Chang Jun was furious and glared at him, “If you dare say one more word, this Old Master will kill you now!”

Scared, Pang Guang no longer dared to say anything.
