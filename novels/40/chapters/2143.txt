The moment the Evil Moon Valley trio made their move, Liu Yan had already decided her course of action: Summon the Divine Spirit’s feather to guard Zhang Ruo Xi first, so that she could go all out.

Twiii...

A loud bird-like cry rang out and the three of them looked up and saw a strange-looking Firebird tens of metres in length, clad in red flames flying about.

The outer layer of this strange bird’s body was a flickering of lightning, indicating that two primary attributes were contained within it.

“She’s not human!” Zhou An shouted after noticing this fact.

When he saw Liu Yan in her original body, he finally understood why he felt there was something off about her. When he first saw Liu Yan, he felt that this woman was different from ordinary people, it seemed like she a little ethereal. Now that he saw her true form, he concluded that Liu Yan was a living spirit.

“She is an Artifact Spirit!” Hua Gu shouted. Fear from his eyes was quickly replaced with greed. He could not help but laugh loudly, “Hahahahaha! The Heavens have presented me with such a gift! This Old Master was worried about my Flame Club being unupgradable. Never would I have imagined that I would have the luck to encounter an Artifact Spirit here! “

As he spoke, he bellowed to the other two, “Junior Brother, Senior Brother, I only want this Artifact Spirit. After I get her, you can have the rest. Is that fine with you?”

After Zhou An and Xiong Ning heard this, they looked at each other and nodded, “We will abide by Senior’s decision!”

“Good!” Hua Gu nodded and eerily stared at Liu Yan. “Looking at your form and how you act, it seems that you already attained some level of consciousness. It’s not easy to cultivate to this point. Don’t worry. This old master is kind enough to let you live. So long as you enter my Flame Club obediently, I promise not to destroy your Divine Sense. How’s that?”

After he spoke, he summoned out a club artifact. This artifact had a rich aura to it. Filled with power. Obviously, it was a Dao Source High-Rank Grade artifact!

Such an artifact could be considered to be an extremely rare treasure. If an Artifact Spirit such as Liu Yan were to combine with it, and was refined by Hua Gu, the Flame Club might be promoted to an Emperor Artifact!

Furthermore, with an Emperor Artifact, Hua Gu, being in the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, had the opportunity to peek into the mysteries of the Emperor Realm!

Therefore, even knowing that the Sealed World Bead was worth a lot, he would be willing to give it up just to subdue Liu Yan. After all, one’s cultivation was the most fundamental when it came to one’s power.

After Hua Gu spoke, he was faced with Liu Yan’s pillar of fire!

The flames came down from the sky, as if they were going to melt the earth. They produced an enormous level of power.

The Evil Moon Valley trio hurriedly avoided it!

Hua Gu continued to persist and shouted, “You should not refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit! If you had just accepted the deal, this Old Master would no longer act and it would be that thing against the two of them! But now that you have refused, do you think it can hold up against all three of us?”

He was naturally referring to the Luan Feng’s dark feather.

To him, Liu Yan using the most powerful artifact in her possession to protect Zhang Ruo Xi was the dumbest move she could make! After all, though she managed to protect Zhang Ruo Xi, she was no match against the three of them, especially with her artifact gone. Furthermore, once they are done with her, they would move on to Zhang Ruo Xi. For someone in the Saint King Realm, how could she possibly even resist them?

In his mind, the best option was to ignore Zhang Ruo Xi and leave her to die. Meanwhile, she would use that feather to attack the three of them.

Fuuu...

Another pillar of fire fell down from the sky.

“Playing with fire in front of this Old Master!” Hua Gu coldly snorted and threw the Flame Club, which spun around. The pillar of fire created by Liu Yan made contact with the club. Once they made contact, Hua Gu spoke, assured of his victory. “It seems that your consciousness is still lacking.”

Pfff!

Liu Yan opened her mouth and a ball of fire the size of a table came crashing down.

“I told you it’s futile!” Hua Gu shouted impatiently, and Flame Club made contact with the attack once again.

Hong Hong Hong...

A loud explosion rang out, and World Energy around them became chaotic.

“What!?” Hua Gu’s face suddenly changed. He hurriedly withdrew his Flame Club and tightly clenched it in his hand. When he looked down to check on it, he found that his Dao Source Grade High-Rank artifact was now wrapped with pulsating lightning arcs, causing his hand to feel numb.

“Yes, the power of Lightning is no doubt powerful!” The greed and desire in Hua Gu’s eyes became more and more obvious. Such an Artifact Spirit could rarely be found even in a million years! It seemed that once he merged his weapon with Liu Yan, not only would he be able to upgrade it to be an Emperor Artifact, it would also obtain the power to use Lightning.

“Senior Brother, don’t bother talking to her. Since she doesn’t want to submit, we just have to force her to!” Zhou An dodged the attack again and spoke with impatience.

“Fine, but be careful. Don’t hurt her spirituality!” Hua Gu nodded and did not forget to give a warning.

Zhou An coldly snorted, “Junior Brother is not the best at controlling his strength. If my attacks really hurt her, it’s her own fault.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Once he said his piece, Zhou An shook his wrist. In his hand, a long spear emerged and flashed forward, charging at Liu Yan.

The silent Xiong Ning also acted. He placed his hands together and stimulated his Source Qi which ferociously shot forth.

“Primordial Divine Spear!”

“Burning Sun’s Phantom Hand!”

The two Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators attacked with the power of World Principles. By utilizing the power of Heaven and Earth, the majestic and ferocious attack headed towards Liu Yan.

Liu Yan’s body swayed as she wrapped her body in a layer of fire, which acted as a barrier to resist the attacks from both sides.

Boom!

Liu Yan let out a pained cry. The flame barrier which surrounded her was instantly shattered. Although it managed to absorb most of the damage there was still the residual attack that slammed onto her body. It was powerful enough to cause her to shift and made her lose control of her current form.

After the barrier disappeared, Hua Gu’s figure mysteriously appeared close, in front of Liu Yan. His face solemn as he shouted, “Look into this Old Master’s eyes!”

With those words, a magical power blossomed from his eyes, turning into two vortexes that kept spinning, as if to pull Liu Yan’s Soul out from her body.

This was a Soul Secret Technique, which Hua Gu only made use of at the most opportune time. He timed it such that Liu Yan simply could not avoid it and was instantly struck.

Although Liu Yan had only recently advanced to the level of Dao Source Realm, her combat ability could be considered to be decent. However, she was outnumbered and each of them had a much higher cultivation than her. So, she was unable to deliver a decent fight when the three of them joined forces.

After being hit by the Soul Secret Technique, Liu Yan’s body was suddenly frozen in mid-air. Each flap of her wings slowed down. Her mind was in chaos, seemingly unable to resist.

Seeing this scene, Hua Gu was overjoyed, secretly feeling that things were going surprisingly well. He could already imagine the wondrous scene of subduing this Firebird Artifact Spirit, merging it into his Flame Club, and allowing his artifact to be promoted to an Emperor Artifact.

A beautiful picture of the future seemed to be unfolding in front of him.

“Senior Brother! Look out!” Zhou An suddenly shouted.

“What’s wrong?” Hua Gu was shocked, but soon, his eyes widened. He saw, within the Firebird’s pupils, that there was another type of flame that was burning. This flame was different, it seemed to be able to burn one’s Soul. As soon as someone made contact with it, it would cause his Knowledge Sea to tumble, and result in an unimaginable headache.

Sun’s True Fire!

Liu Yan had followed Yang Kai for so long, and even she was not clear on how much Sun’s True Fire she had devoured. Furthermore, her body had integrated with two kinds of precious and powerful flames. If not for consuming all of these, Liu Yan would never have been able to take on a solid form as an Artifact Spirit, much less obtain her level of sentience as an Artifact Spirit. So, it could be said that Liu Yan’s body was extremely complicated, housing many rare and valuable flames.

Hua Gu tried to use the Soul Secret Technique against Liu Yan again, but obviously, it did not work.

In a flash, Hua Gu cried out and retreated. He covered his head, and roared at Liu Yan. “Are you this unwilling to submit to this Old Master?”

He roared hysterically, “Since you won’t submit, this Old Master will destroy your consciousness!”

Once he completed his sentence, he clasped both his hands together and formed a seal. The Flame Club suddenly became bigger and burned even brighter. Up in the air, it started to tremble and shot towards Liu Yan like an arrow that left its string.

At the same time, Zhou An and Xiong Ning both attacked again.

Liu Yan’s eyes finally showed a hint of panic. Her body swerved around as countless lightning strikes and fireballs flew out, with some mixed in blue ice flames, trying to resist this onslaught.

She managed to block off Zhou An and Xiong Ning’s attack, but the Flame Club still shot straight at Liu Yan with hardly any decrease in strength.

At this rate, the Flame Club was bound to go through Liu Yan’s body and inflict heavy damage to her.

“You asked for it!” After all, only an Artifact Spirit with its own consciousness that was obedient had its uses. Meanwhile, a chaotic and ignorant Artifact Spirit that resisted at every turn, would only hurt him. Since the other party was unwilling to give in, he was left with no choice but to kill her.

But at that moment, an unusual fluctuation could be felt. A brave and heroic figure mysteriously appeared in front of Liu Yan. He stretched out a hand, lightly slapped forward and whispered, “Exile!”

A Void Crack opened up, and something like a black hole took shape.

And... the Flame Club headed into the black hole...

“No!” Hua Gu’s face changed dramatically as he gathered up his Source Qi in a panic. He only had one thing on his mind, which is to recall his artifact before the black hole closed up.

Seeing the black hole quickly closing up, Hua Gu’s forehead was drenched with cold sweat.

Although he had never seen such a Secret Technique before, he knew that if he did not recall in time, his artifact would be lost forever.

“Who!?” Zhou An could not help but shout with a ruthless expression.

Xiong Ning also narrowed his eyes and looked ahead.

In the sky, a young man stood quietly in front of the Firebird, his gaze coldly sweeping them. He was fuming with rage.

Yang Kai is naturally in a horrendous mood. Originally, he checked around the canyon in advance and found no signs of Monster Beasts around, so he felt that the bottom of this canyon was safe. Therefore, he decided to leave Zhang Ruo Xi and Liu Yan here, even placing the Sealed World Bead and other important treasures here as well.

But, never would he have thought that after just a short time, trouble would arise, causing him to have to rush back.
