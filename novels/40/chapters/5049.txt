Upon hearing that, Zhong Liang nodded, “You share the same sentiment as those from Yin-Yang Pass. To be honest with you, it was for this exact reason that your Martial Uncle Ding headed to the Yin-Yang Theatre where he captured this Warship from the Black Ink Clan.”

“What was the outcome of the mission?” Yang Kai asked nervously.

Zhong Liang shook his head with a dejected expression, “He worked with another Eighth-Order Army Commander from Yin-Yang Pass, but they only managed to kill some Black Ink Clansmen and seize this Warship. However, they were unable to find the person who made it.”

There was a solemn expression on Yang Kai’s face. After giving it a thought, he said, “In order to find that Black Ink Disciple’s identity, we have to infiltrate the Black Ink Clan’s territory and then play it by ear. Both Martial Uncles had only alerted the enemies by making a scene there.”

“En,” Zhong Liang let out a sigh, “The Black Ink Clan will certainly treasure this Black Ink Disciple who can make Warships. Their identity must be a top secret within the Black Ink Clan, so the average Black Ink Clansman probably doesn’t know who they are. It’s extremely difficult to find the Black Ink Disciple without alerting the enemies. Is there anyone who can take on this task?”

Yang Kai batted his eyes. Upon realising Zhong Liang’s intention, he broke out into laughter, “Is that the reason you told me to come here, Sir?” After pondering on it for a moment, he said, “I can pretend to be a Black Ink Disciple and sneak into the Black Ink Clan’s hinterland in the Yin-Yang Theatre. As long as I’m cautious enough, I might be able to find that person.”

Since his intentions had been seen through, Zhong Liang decided to stop beating around the bush and just let out a sigh, “I initially didn’t want to drag you into this; however, since your Martial Uncle Ding has failed in his attempt, we have no other choice. There’s no hurry though. You can sleep on it and make a decision at a later time.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “That Black Ink Disciple had already developed this thing 2 years ago. The longer this matter drags on, the more likely he’ll be able to perfect his craft. By then, it will be too late to find him. There’s nothing worth considering. I’ll take on this task.”

Zhong Liang said with a serious expression, “It will be a dangerous mission, and if you’re not cautious enough, you’ll lose your life.”

Yang Kai replied, “Sir, have you forgotten that I’d pretended to be a Black Ink Disciple and spent 2 years with the Black Ink Clan before I came to Blue Sky Pass? No one is more experienced than me when it comes to pretending to be a Black Ink Disciple.”

After a pause, he went on to say, “Even if I fail in my attempt, or if anything unexpected happens, I can still rely on Space Principles to escape. Even if the worst-case scenario where I’ll lose my life does occur, it will still be fine. Now that the Purifying Black Ink Pills have been successfully developed, Humans have a method to deal with Black Ink Strength other than Purifying Light. Taking all that into consideration, I’m the best person for this job.”

At this point, he cupped his fist and said solemnly, “Sir, I’m willing to head to the Yin-Yang Theatre to gather more information. Please allow me to do so.”

There was a conflicted expression on Zhong Liang’s face. After hesitating for a bit, he let out a sigh, “I’m sorry for putting you in such a tight spot.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “Since time immemorial, countless Human Masters have come to the Black Ink Battlefield in order to hold back the enemy and ensure the safety of the 3,000 Worlds. In every battle, all of them exert themselves to kill the enemy even if it means losing their lives. It is my duty to do something for the Human Race, so I will definitely do my best.”

On the first day he arrived at the Black Ink Battlefield, Yang Kai learned a valuable lesson from Meng Qi, who sacrificed his life in order to keep the existence of the Void Corridor a secret. It was because he was worried that he would be corrupted by Black Ink Strength again and reveal the Void Corridor’s existence.

In all the previous battles, innumerable Humans risked their lives in order to drive back the Black Ink Clan. They were just as noble as Meng Qi.

The fact that the Black Ink Clan were close to developing fully functional Warships had far-reaching implications. If the Black Ink Disciple managed to master the art of refining Warships, it would mean that all the sacrifices that the Humans had made over the years would be pointless. By then, the entire 3,000 Worlds would be at risk of being destroyed.

No one would be willing to see such a crisis taking place.

Since Yang Kai had arrived on the Black Ink Battlefield, he was also a part of the Human Army. He didn’t think that there was anyone else who was more suited than him to sneak into the enemies’ territory and gather information.

“Sir, there’s one more thing I’d like to know,” Yang Kai said solemnly.

“Go ahead.”

“Have those from Yin-Yang Pass speculated how long it would take for the Black Ink Clan to successfully develop Warships?”

After giving it a thought, Zhong Liang replied, “Those from Yin-Yang Pass do have a speculation. The Warships that the Black Ink Clan have made so far are not really useful, probably just prototypes used to test out various functions. It is estimated it will take them about 100 years to perfect this thing. If everything goes well, perhaps they’ll achieve it in 50 years, though they might need longer than 100 years as well. After all, the speed at which the Black Ink Disciple improves in their Dao of Artifact Refining is key, and given their current mastery, it won’t be easy for them to improve further.”

“To be on the safe side then, we’ll assume that they’ll be able to do it in 50 years,” Yang Kai muttered under his breath, “There’s still something we can do about it with that much time. Sir, before I carry out this task, I have a request.”

“Just tell me whatever you need. I’ll not turn you down as long as there’s anything I can help you with.”

“I’d like to study Artifact Refining.”

Zhong Liang was startled for a moment, then his eyes brightened, “You mean…”

Yang Kai said with a smile, “I have to get prepared in order to achieve our goal; moreover, I’d have to learn more about Artifact Refining to make it easier for me to gather information regardless.”

Zhong Liang nodded repeatedly, “You’re indeed a clever young man. It never crossed the minds of old men like us to approach the issue from that angle. You can go ahead with that.”

One hour later, Yang Kai arrived at the Refining Hall with the token given to him by Zhong Liang. He found Dong Guo An Ping, who was leading a team of people to refine a Warship. The two of them could be considered friends. It was Yang Kai, Dong Guo An Ping, Fan Xun, and several others who worked together to make the first Purifying Black Ink Battleship; therefore, they didn’t need to be overly polite with each other.

Upon learning the purpose of the young man’s visit, Dong Guo An Ping felt his brow twitching slightly as he asked, “You want to learn Artifact Refining?”

Yang Kai cupped his fist, “Please help me with this, Senior Dong Guo.”

Dong Guo An Ping examined him with a puzzled expression, “Why do you want to learn Artifact Refining all of a sudden?”

Yang Kai replied, “I’ve progressed too quickly, so I need to take a break from just cultivating in seclusion. I told Martial Uncle Zhong about it, and he suggested I come here to study Artifact Refining. He said that the Dao of Artifact Refining might be of help to me.”

Dong Guo An Ping couldn’t help but laugh, “What does the Dao of Artifact Refining have to do with your cultivation? Moreover, I heard that you’re well-versed in the Alchemic Dao. If there’s anything wrong with your cultivation, why did you come to this place instead of the Pill Hall?”

Yang Kai replied respectfully, “It was Martial Uncle Zhong’s order. I don’t really know the reason behind it.”

It was a secret that the Black Ink Clan were able to refine Warships. Other than the Army Commanders and the Old Ancestor, no one else in Blue Sky Pass was aware of this fact, lest morale was affected.

Since Zhong Liang didn’t inform Dong Guo An Ping about it, and Yang Kai naturally wasn’t in any place to reveal this secret; therefore, he just came up with an excuse by saying that it was Zhong Liang’s order.

In that case, there was nothing Dong Guo An Ping could do about it. He passed the token back to Yang Kai and asked, “Did you learn Artifact Refining before?”

“I know a little about it,” Yang Kai replied humbly.

Dong Guo An Ping frowned and beckoned to him, “Come with me.”

Soon, he brought Yang Kai to an Artifact Refining room and pointed at some materials that were stacked up in a messy pile, “Just make whatever you want. I’ll evaluate it.”

After taking a glance at the materials, Yang Kai started working on it.

A patient Dong Guo An Ping stayed on the side and watched him.

A few days later, a sword that was as reflective as a mirror was born. The blade shone brightly and appeared extraordinary.

However, Dong Guo An Ping couldn’t help but roll his eyes. As an Artifact Refining Grandmaster, he could see that other than looking nice, this sword was practically useless. If not for the fact that the materials used were robust, the sword couldn’t even have withstood an attack from an Origin King.

After a few days of observation, Dong Guo An Ping figured out that Yang Kai indeed knew a thing or two about the Dao of Artifact Refining, but he had never studied it in a systematic way. Even though some of his ideas were creative, the way he refined artifacts was overly simplistic.

The Dao of Artifact Refining was as much an art as it was a craft. Yang Kai’s Artifact Refining session could even be described as unpleasant to the eyes of a Grandmaster like Dong Guo An Ping.

“En, give me a moment,” Dong Guo An Ping said, then activated his Divine Sense to communicate with someone.

A moment later, a young man arrived in a hurry and cupped his fist, “Honoured Master!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Dong Guo An Ping nodded and pointed at Yang Kai, “This is your Junior Brother, Yang Kai.”

That person cupped his fists again, “Junior Brother Yang.”

Dong Guo An Ping then introduced the young man to Yang Kai, “He’s my Sixth Disciple, Chai Hao.”

“Greetings, Senior Brother Chai,” Yang Kai saluted him.

Dong Guo An Ping said, “Chai Hao, your Junior Brother Yang would like to learn Artifact Refining, so you’ll have to give him some guidance from now on.”

Chai Hao was startled upon hearing that, “Junior Brother Yang, you want to study Artifact Refining?”

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded.

Chai Hao replied with a smile, “Since you’re interested in the Dao of Artifact Refining, I’ll definitely teach you everything I know.”

“Many thanks, Senior Brother,” Yang Kai expressed his gratitude.

Dong Guo An Ping coughed, “Yang Kai, you’ll learn Artifact Refining from Chai Hao from now on. Just ask him if there’s anything you don’t understand. I still have some matters to attend to, so I’ll take my leave now.”

Upon finishing his words, he left the place in a hurry.

Yang Kai and Chai Hao saw him off together.

After he was gone, Chai Hao said, “Junior Brother, since you’re going to learn Artifact Refining, I’ll need to know how skilful you are in Artifact Refining. Would you…”

Before he could finish his words, Yang Kai held out a sword to him.

“What’s this?” Chai Hao was puzzled.

Yang Kai replied, “Senior Dong Guo told me to make something, and this is the result of my work.”

“I see,” Chai Hao took the sword and examined it. Soon, his face began to twitch as he finally realised why his Honoured Master left in a hurry just now.

He initially thought that Yang Kai was already well-versed in the Dao of Artifact Refining; otherwise, he wouldn’t have directly sought some guidance from a Grandmaster from Divine Cauldron Heaven.

After taking a look at this sword though, he realised that Yang Kai couldn’t even be considered a novice when it came to the Dao of Artifact Refining. There was no doubt that Yang Kai was no match for Dong Guo An Ping in this regard, but even a random disciple from Divine Cauldron Heaven could easily bring him to his knees.

Now that his Honoured Master entrusted Yang Kai to him though, it meant that he would have to teach him everything from scratch.

Chai Hao suddenly felt a huge pressure on his shoulders, thinking that this was going to be a troublesome task.
