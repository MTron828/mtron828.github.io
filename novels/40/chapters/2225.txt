The woman transformed from the Sacred Deer looked at Yang Kai and said with slightly parted lips, “Young Master, it’s time to return home.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Kai did not move nor did he reply, understanding that the other party was not speaking to him.

The fidgeting Purple Squirrel on his back peeked out its small head and looked at the woman as it hung off Yang Kai’s shoulder.

The woman smiled and said, “Please don’t be afraid. Sir may be very angry this time, but he says that as long as Young Master returns with us obediently, then he will let you go without punishment.”

The Purple Squirrel opened its mouth and squeaked a few times, the meaning unclear so Yang Kai did not understand.

“You dare try to bargain with us?” Upon hearing what it said though, Yuan Fei glared and rolled up his sleeves as if he was ready to attack, shouting loudly, “Don’t you stop me this time, Bai Lu! I have to teach him a good lesson!”

As he said that, he really did seem like he was going to rush over and beat down the Purple Squirrel.

The Purple Squirrel was so scared that it quickly shrunk its head back, latching onto Yang Kai’s back with its two paws, trembling.

Now, Yang Kai understood completely what was going on.

The Purple Squirrel that he encountered by chance was clearly a big figure since there were actually two Emperor Realm Monster Race dispatched to look for it. And, from how they were addressing the Purple Squirrel, it seemed to be the son of some Master of this Heavenly Monster Mountain.

And this Master... was most likely the Ruler of Heavenly Monster Mountain!

Yang Kai’s heart was completely shaken.

On the other hand, Bai Lu and Yuan Fei were very well matched in their roles, one coaxing, one threatening. It was clearly not the first time these two were doing this as they had already completely cornered the Purple Squirrel.

Seeing that Yuan Fei really was about to rush over, Bai Lu quickly said, “Come to me quickly, Young Master! Elder Sister will protect you!”

As soon as those words left her mouth, Yang Kai felt the weight on his back disappear.

The Purple Squirrel shot out like a purple light and rushed into Bai Lu’s embrace, shrinking into her arms and only daring to peek his head out to eye Yuan Fei warily.

“He actually fell for that...?” Yang Kai was speechless.

Yuan Fei also stopped and glared at the Purple Squirrel and snorted, “Don’t let me catch you, or I’ll peel your skin off!”

As soon as those words came out, the Purple Squirrel didn’t dare to leave Bai Lu’s arms anymore and its body tensed up even further; despite that though, it still stuck out its tongue mischievously at Yuan Fei.

“This is the eleventh time!” Bai Lu looked at the Purple Squirrel with a helpless face and said, “Young Master, please don’t do this again; after all, it’s very dangerous outside...”

After she said that, she eyed Yang Kai, whether intentionally or otherwise, and went on, “Sir has also said that he will allow you to go out when you grow a little more, so just wait a bit longer.”

Naturally, the Purple Squirrel nodded its head like a little chick pecking at the warm embrace and words of the beauty, looking meek and obedient.

“You should apologize to Sir when we return, otherwise, no one can save you!” Bai Lu added.

Naturally, the Purple Squirrel listened.

The two Twelfth-Order Monster Race Masters looked at each other, silently communicating with their eyes.

“All right, we’ve settled Young Master’s matters, so...” Yuan Fei glanced coldly at Yang Kai as he spoke, bellowing, “Little brat, who gave you the guts to come into the depths of Heavenly Monster Mountain!”

Yang Kai’s face paled and he quickly cupped his fists, “Reporting to Senior, Junior is currently being pursued and had no other recourse but to travel deeper into your territory. If I have offended Senior, then I hope that...”

“Enough!” Yuan Fei did not want to listen to Yang Kai’s explanation at all, waving his arms as he shouted angrily, “It seems you humans have already forgotten the Heavenly Monster Accord from all those years ago!”

“Heavenly Monster Accord?” Yang Kai frowned.

He was merely a cultivator born and raised in the outside world who had come to this mirror world for life experience, so how would Yang Kai have known about this Heavenly Monster Accord? He had never even heard of it before now.

“You really forgot!” When he saw this, Yuan Fei’s face turned cold and he became extremely angry, “As I thought, humans cannot be trusted! Since that’s the case, I will send you off personally!”

With these words, he pushed out the power in his body, causing a rich pressure to spread out in an instant.

The pressure Yuan Fei released was very different from Ban Qing’s. The latter’s pressure was cold and piercing, while the former was fierce and domineering, giving Yang Kai a feeling that it was unavoidable and unstoppable, as if he would be ground to dust by it.

*Zhi zhi...*

Right at that moment, the Purple Squirrel hiding in Bai Lu’s arms suddenly shouted anxiously, gesturing at Yuan Fei with its two little paws and looking nervous.

“Huh?” Upon hearing this, Yuan Fei could not help but pause his actions. A moment later, much of his anger dissipated and he looked Yang Kai up and down, asking suspiciously, “You saved our Young Master?”

Yang Kai understood in an instant that the Purple Squirrel probably told him what had happened earlier and without hesitation, he nodded, “It was a coincidence of sorts.”

Yuan Fei couldn’t help but frown, showing a troubled expression.

To him, if a human wandered into the depths of Heavenly Monster Mountain, that human had to die. If two humans came, two humans had to die. It was completely reasonable to him because humans were the ones who broke the Heavenly Monster Accord in the first place.

But this human had apparently saved the life of his Young Master, making things difficult.

It would be against his will not to kill him, but killing him would put the Young Master in an awkward situation, and if the Lord were to hear of this later, Yuan Fei would definitely be scolded.

Immediately, he scratched his head and turned his eyes to Bai Lu to ask for help.

Bai Lu was also frowning slightly. After mulling over it for a moment, she said, “You have done us a great service for saving our Young Master; however... young man, I see many traces of Monster Beast Sources on your body. You must have killed many Monster Beasts on your journey, yes?”

Yang Kai was flustered, having no idea how she could tell; but obviously lying now was not a good idea, so he could only nod and say, “Yes!”

“The Monster Beasts that you killed are the children of our Heavenly Monster Mountain, so slaughtering them is a great insult to us, and you should be held accountable for this!”

“Then I will kill him!” Yuan Fei’s murderous intent rose up instantly.

Bai Lu raised her hand, stopping him, “He has merits and demerits. As for how he will be dealt with... we will let the Lord decide!”

“Good!” Yuan Fei nodded at her words.

While speaking, he reached a hand out towards Yang Kai without delay and drew him over.

Yang Kai immediately felt a strong force wrap around him, but he did not try to resist and simply surrendered obediently without a fight, allowing Yuan Fei to grab him.

If he raised a fuss in front of these two Twelfth-Order Masters in this situation, it would definitely do more harm than good. Not mentioning whether Yang Kai could even escape under the noses of these two, even if he did, where would he go?

And from the behaviour of that woman called Bai Lu, she did not seem unreasonable. With the good he did saving the Purple Squirrel’s life, he believed there should not be any danger to his life.

At most, he may be held in Heavenly Monster Mountain and would only have to wait sometime before he was released back to the world outside.

When he was captured, Yang Kai did not forget to say, “Junior has something to inform two Seniors about!”

“Spit it out then!” Yuan Fei shouted coldly.

“As far as Junior knows, there is someone named Zhou Dian in Heavenly Monster Mountain who brought many Masters with him to search for...”

“Zhou Dian?” Yuan Fei and Bai Lu’s faces instantly changed as they gasped in shock, as if this person’s name was an extremely scary existence to them.

Yuan Fei even pulled Yang Kai before himself and glared at him, asking, “Are you sure that Zhou Dian is here?”

“I haven’t seen him before, but... I bumped into someone called Ban Qing. I heard about Zhou Dian from him.”

“You met that bastard Ban Qing?” Yuan Fei’s eyes widened.

Bai Lu quickly said, “If Ban Qing is already here, then Zhou Dian must be here as well. I’m afraid the other three have definitely come as well... What are they looking for?”

The last question was directed at Yang Kai.

“They seemed to be looking for something called the ‘Star of Calamity’, as for what that is, Junior is also at a loss,” Yang Kai told them truthfully.

“Star of Calamity?” Bai Lu’s eyebrows furrowed.

Yuan Fei, however, looked at Yang Kai in astonishment and said, “If you met Ban Qing, how are you still alive?”

“This little brat is... good at escaping!” Yang Kai smiled awkwardly.

Yuan Fei swept his eyes over him, not knowing whether he should believe him or not. On the other hand, the eyes of the Purple Squirrel in Bai Lu’s arms were flitting around, looking at Yang Kai with a knowing light, but clearly not trying to expose him.

“Regardless of whether what you say is true or not, we must report this matter to our lord. Yuan Fei, bring him with us and let us return!” Bai Lu called out and immediately turned around, speeding off towards a certain direction.

Carrying Yang Kai, Yuan Fei followed closely behind.

“Senior... Junior can walk by himself,” Yang Kai felt uncomfortable being carried by Yuan Fei this way, so he hastily suggested this.

Yuan Fei looked at him and did not say much, but he did release him.

Yang Kai had no intention of running away either. Instead, he pushed his strength to keep up with the two Monster Race Masters.

The two masters seem to be trying to test if Yang Kai really was good at ‘escaping’, so they gradually increased their speed, making no attempts to accommodate him at all.

Yang Kai also tried his best to follow them and actually did not lag behind too much, surprising the two.

.....

Somewhere in Heavenly Monster Mountain, Zhou Dian was still riding majestically on his Nine Horned Dragon Beast, his profound gaze staring towards a certain place in Heavenly Monster Mountain. A thick fighting intent was flowing out from his body, almost dense enough to materialize.

There were five other Masters scattered in the vicinity around him.

These Masters gathered in a round open space, and there were many people with troubled looks on their faces sitting on the ground within that circle.

Even though these people sitting on the ground did not have their movements restricted, the energy fluctuations coming from their bodies were incredibly weak and there were seal marks on each of their bodies, clearly suppressing their strength.

All of them were cultivators captured by Zhou Dian’s subordinates while from the Heavenly Monster Mountain.

Xiao Bai Yi, Murong Xiao Xiao, and Chen Mu Ji were among them.

The three of them did not dare to say anything to each other either, but their eyes would drift from time to time, passing on some unknown messages.

They felt very wronged as they had come to this Divine Ascension Mirror World to train, yet now they were inexplicably captured. Since going their separate ways, the three of them have been hunting Monster Beasts in Heavenly Monster Mountain, absorbing their Soul Sources to strengthen their own Souls.

But all of a sudden, several Emperor Realm Masters suddenly appeared and attacked them without a word, eventually capturing them, sealing their strength, and dragging them to this place.
