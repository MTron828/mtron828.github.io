Being mocked by Yang Kai, Ren Tian Rui opened his mouth to explain, but Yan Pei raised his hand to stop him, “There’s no need to say anything more as this was indeed our wrong. Sect Master Yang, rest assured, this old master will bring the people of Treasure Trove Pavilion and leave High Heaven Sect!”

Yang Kai took a deep look at him but did not say anything more, simply turning his head to Old Woman Feng and the others before snickering, “How great! Great Elder Ye showed both righteousness and compassion but ended up only saving a group of ungrateful wolves, this is simply the best!”

The Origin Returning Realm masters on the opposite side all wore guilty and embarrassed expressions.

Their behaviour was indeed shameful. The cultivators present were all leaders of great forces and possessed great combat strength. Although each of them was cunning like a vox and vicious as a wolf, their actions really were something they felt ashamed of.

As such, when faced with Yang Kai’s mockery, they could not refute.

On top of that, they were afraid of arousing Yang Kai’s anger and provoking him into massacring them, so everyone held their tongues.

Old Black Face Yang Pei stood to the side, and feeling the murderous intent coming from Yang Kai, his expression was extremely solemn, opening his mouth a few times to speak, but ultimately just sighing and choosing to remain silent.

“Who took the lead!?” Yang Kai shouted sharply, his eyes flashing with cold light as he scanned the crowd.

Feeling this terrible anger, everyone involuntarily stepped back a few steps, and in the next moment, many eyes glanced towards Old Woman Feng of Myriad Beast Mountain.

Feeling these gazes, Old Woman Feng’s face changed drastically as she glanced towards Yang Kai with dread.

Yang Kai grinned back at her viciously.

Old Woman Feng no longer dared to remain and with a shout, her withered body suddenly burst out with incredible strength and she turned into a stream of light that raced outwards.

“You want to leave now? Not with your life!” Yang Kai coldly snorted before stretching out his hand towards the fleeing Old Woman Feng and clenching his fist.

Old Woman Feng, who was already a thousand metres away, suddenly felt the space around her solidify and saw innumerable tiny Void Cracks open around her, surrounding her like the sharpest of blades.

“Sect Master Yang, please wait! This old woman admits her wrongs and is willing to offer compensation!” Old Woman Feng cried out. She did not dare to fight and could only push her Saint Qi to try to resist the suction force of the surrounding Void Cracks.

“Too late!” Yang Kai remained unmoved and pushed his Space Force.

The Void Cracks hummed as they seemingly transformed into real blades and sliced through Old Woman Feng.

The next moment, the aura of Old Woman Feng, a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master from Myriad Beast Mountain, disappeared and much of her figure was banished to The Void. What was left of her body fell to the ground in the next breath, leaving behind an eye-catching pile of hashed meat and bone.

Yang Kai next cast his gaze towards the others from Myriad Beast Mountain.

These high-level executives from Myriad Beast Mountain who had come together with Old Woman Feng turned pale and showed looks filled with terror and apprehension.

Some fell to their knees and begged for mercy while others let out desperate shouts as they tried to flee like Old Woman Feng. Others realized that there would be no escape and stood their ground. Their faces were ashen, but they were still pushing their Saint Qi, preparing to fight back.

Feng Yan only stood in place, her beautiful face filled with shock, as if she could not process what had just happened.

Yang Xiu Zhu and the others did not need to wait for Yang Kai’s orders this time and shot forward, knowing what needed to be done.

Ten breaths later, all the Elders from Myriad Beast Mountain were wiped out, leaving only Feng Yan still standing stupidly in place.

The surrounding blood and the tragic deaths of her Martial Uncles and Aunts finally sobered up Feng Yan. Her tender body trembling, her thoughts in chaos, she actually chose the most unexpected action at that moment and shot towards Yang Kai while shouting, “I’ll take you down!”

Yang Kai stared at her blankly, showing no intention to stop her or even move.

Lin Yu Rao, who was standing behind him, took a step forward and waved her hand lightly, sending out a flash of light from her fingertips. A moment later, Feng Yan’s beautiful eyes instantly widened and after rushing forward a few more metres, she came to a halt just five steps from Yang Kai as a thin red line of blood appeared around her neck.

And so, Myriad Beast Mountain’s final bloodline died, and this Sect was completely removed from Shadowed Star.

“You can’t kill me!” A panicked shout suddenly came from the crowd, “This old master is the top Alchemist of Shadowed Star, he had made great contributions to the Human Race, so you can’t kill me!”

Yang Kai turned to the source of the voice and found it was Great Elder Li Jian Ming from Medicine Pill Sect.

Li Jian Ming’s complexion became pale after he witnessed Yang Kai’s ruthless methods and his spirit could not help collapsing somewhat.

“It seems that this matter is also related to your Medicine Pill Sect?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and his figure flickered, arriving in front of Li Jian Ming in the next instant as he stretched out a hand to grab him.

Although Li Jian Ming was the Great Elder of Medicine Pill Sect, he was only a First-Order Origin Returning Realm masters in the end. Having invested most of his life into the pursuit of Alchemy, Li Jian Ming had no spare energy to pursue the Martial Dao, resulting in his cultivation being quite low, and his combat experience being even lower.

When Yang Kai reached out towards him, Li Jian Ming did not even try to dodge and instead just continued to scream, “You can’t kill me!”

Yang Kai naturally did not pay him any mind and with a slap exploded his head.

“Stop!” A shout rang out too late, only reaching Yang Kai’s ears after Li Jian Ming’s head exploded.

Turning his head and looking around, Yang Kai saw several other senior members of Medicine Pill Sect glaring at him.

As soon as Yang Kai’s cold gaze landed upon them though, the senior executives of Medicine Pill Sect felt as if they had been thrown into a blizzard and could not help shivering.

The leader of this group, another Elder from Medicine Pill Sect, was just about to continue objecting, but seeing Yang Kai staring at him like this, his jaw clenched up and he hesitantly said, “Sect Master Yang... we are willing to pledge allegiance to High Heaven Sect, all we ask in return is that Sect Master Yang show mercy to us.”

Everyone could not help showing a look of shock.

Although Medicine Pill Sect had only a few members even before the chaos, it had always been an arrogant and aloof Sect.

When Heaven Battling Union and Thunder Typhoon Sect were in their heydays, they naturally had ideas about annexing Medicine Pill Sect. They wanted to have these Alchemists work solely for their Sects, but Medicine Pill Sect refused to compromise so despite Heaven Battling Union and Thunder Typhoon Sect’s annoyance, they had no choice but to back down.

Eventually, they formed a cooperative relationship with Medicine Pill Sect and in exchange for a massive amount of materials and resources, Medicine Pill Sect would refine several pills for them.

But now, these Elders from Medicine Pill Sect declared their willingness to submit to High Heaven Sect.

Although Great Elder Li Jian Ming was already dead, there were still four Origin Grade Low-Rank Alchemists in Medicine Pill Sect! There were also more than a dozen Saint King Grade Alchemists present, a treasure that any force would salivate over.

Any great force that could control this many high-rank Alchemists would surely see its strength grow rapidly in the future.

Although the atmosphere here and Yang Kai’s previous methods had caused great fear in everyone present, when the Elder of Medicine Pill Sect made this offer, the others present couldn’t help looking at Yang Kai with some envy. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“We are willing to submit to High Heaven Sect. Please spare our lives, Sect Master Yang!” Seeing that their leader had already compromised, how could the other Elders dare resist? All of them immediately lowered their arrogant heads one after another, expressing their willingness to surrender.

Yang Xiu Zhu and the others raised their brows as they looked towards Yang Kai with slightly expectant expressions, as if they wanted to suggest that he agree to Medicine Pill Sect’s request.

Yang Kai just snickered, however, and asked, “I just killed Li Jian Ming, do you not hold a grudge against me?”

The expressions of the people from Medicine Pill Sect changed slightly and the Elder who spoke first took the initiative and spoke up. “Wise birds choose the best tree to roost in, we are simply making the best choice we can.”

“Haha!” Yang Kai laughed lightly before his face sank and he commanded, “Kill them!”

Everyone from Medicine Pill Sect was stunned, and Yang Xiu Zhu and the others were shocked. They did not think that Yang Kai would issue such a ruthless order.

However, they also did not hesitate, rushed out, and executed his command.

The Elders from Medicine Pill Sect shouted, “Sect Master Yang, this old master and his companions are Origin Grade Alchemists, you...”

Before he could finish speaking, Chu Han Yi lopped off his head.

The people from Medicine Pill Sect did not have much fighting strength, so Yang Xiu Zhu’s trio didn’t need to exert much effort to send them all to the next life.

Unlike before though, there was some reluctance on their faces this time.

These people were all Alchemists capable of refining pills above Saint King Grade. Never had they been willing to submit to any great force, but now they were just corpses gradually growing cold on High Heaven Sect’s main square.

Yang Kai did not care in the slightest. If he were someone else, he might really have given these people a way out; after all, Origin Grade Alchemists were not easy to come across, especially in a place like Shadowed Star.

Every Alchemist above Saint King Grade was a precious resource.

However, Yang Kai himself was an Origin King Grade Alchemist while Little Senior Sister’s Alchemy skills were even better than his, so how could he care about a few trivial Origin Grade Low-Rank Alchemists?

Instead of wasting precious herbs on them, Yang Kai would rather kill them and do it himself.

After dealing with the two primary culprits, Myriad Beast Mountain and Medicine Pill Sect, the anger and murderous intent in Yang Kai’s heart finally calmed down somewhat, and under the terrified and anxious gazes of the rest of the crowd, he declared, “You now have two choices: Submit or die!”

Everyone here was an Origin Returning Realm cultivator and represented a powerful combat force.

While Yang Kai did have the ability to slaughter them all, considering his options, Yang Kai was more interested in subduing them.

Corpse Spirit Religion was a disaster for all of Shadowed Star, and High Heaven Sect’s original forces had suffered heavy casualties, so there was a lack of powerful masters who could be deployed in battle at this moment.

These people were more useful alive than dead.

Little Black Face Ren Tian Rui had also said that many great forces did not participate in the persecution of Ye Xi Yun and the others. Most of the great forces here probably just followed along with the flow of events.

So, after killing those responsible, Yang Kai did not intend to punish the others ruthlessly. Presumably, the blood of Myriad Beast Mountain and Medicine Pill Sect that he had spilt was enough to make these people understand their place.

After Yang Kai spoke, the square fell silent once more.

Everyone was exchanging glances, but compared to the anxious ones they were wearing just now, their expressions had eased greatly.

They had been afraid that Yang Kai’s murderous intentions would not be quelled until they were all dead, and with the strength he and Yang Xiu Zhu’s trio displayed, they knew they would not be able to resist.

No one was stupid enough to question Yang Kai’s overbearing command. Compared with his brutal tactics just now, being given a choice to submit was nothing less than a great benevolence, causing many to feel relieved but also somewhat complicated.
