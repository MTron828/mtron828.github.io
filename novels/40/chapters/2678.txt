“Will anything happen to Young Master Yang? That woman doesn’t seem to be someone we should get involved with,” Ye Jing Han asked with a worried face. Her heart raced when she recalled the scene in front of the City Lord’s Mansion.

“Since Brother Yang took the initiative to lead her out, he definitely has a plan.” Although saying so, Du Xian was uncertain too and looked at Ying Fei with a querying look.

Ying Fei said nothing, but a vague trace of worry could be seen on his cold face.

Ye Jing Han and Du Xian were just Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators, so they could not understand just how terrifying that young woman really was, but as a Monster King, he naturally understood the astonishing strength she possessed.

Her performance in front of the City Lord’s Mansion was just a fraction of her true strength. If she really went all out, Ying Fei was not sure if he could defeat her.

Yang Kai was strong, but he was still just a First-Order Emperor after all.

Therefore, even though Yang Kai told them not to follow, Ying Fei still decided to chase after him in case of an accident.

As they traced the aura left by Yang Kai, Ying Fei was sure that he was moving in the right direction. After entering the mountains, there were traces of battle everywhere, with the surrounding terrain broken, trees felled, mountains flattened, and the stench of blood filling the air, showcasing the ferocity of the fight which had taken place here.

Ying Fei could not help frowning, secretly praying that Yang Kai would be alright.

After sniffing with his nose to determine the direction, Ying Fei wrapped Ye Jing Han and Du Xian with his Monster Qi and rushed off in a certain direction.

After a short moment, Du Xian suddenly pointed his finger, “Over there.”

Despite there being several dozen kilometres between them, Du Xian could keenly see that there were two people on the ground over there. He had no clue what was happening at the moment, but he could see that the fight had seemingly come to an end. In fact, what he vaguely saw was two people closely entangled together, like they were wrestling.

Ying Fei narrowed his eyes and immediately flew over.

Although it was several dozen kilometres, it only took them a blink of an eye to arrive.

“Young Master Yang!” Ying Fei cried out, but as soon as he spoke, his jaw dropped at the scene on the ground in front of him, dumbstruck.

Ye Jing Han and Du Xian were stunned too, their expressions gradually turning awkward.

There were traces of battle the whole way here, so although they did not witness the fight themselves, they could tell just how fierce the conflict had been and had been deeply worried for Yang Kai. However, this scene in front of them totally confused them.

Yang Kai and the young woman were tightly embracing each other on the ground. Yang Kai’s upper body was practically naked as he pressed his body onto the young woman, his hands roaming all over her body. On the other hand, the young woman was embracing Yang Kai too, her nails leaving deep bloody trails on his back. The three observers could not tell whether the noises these two were making were sounds of joy or of suffering, confusing and embarrassing them at the same time.

“This…” Ying Fei was speechless as deep down inside his heart he was screaming, [What the hell happened!?]

“Don’t look, don’t look!” Du Xian hurriedly covered Ye Jing Han’s eyes, but he continued watching attentively without even blinking his own.

Ye Jing Han blushed and shoved Du Xian’s hand away angrily, then pulled his ear and dragged him away.

Du Xian forced a smile to conceal his embarrassment.

“Let’s leave!” Monster King Ying Fei immediately reacted to the situation and said to Du Xian and Ye Jing Han before they quickly turned around and returned along the way they came.

Although they did not know what happened, they were sure that Yang Kai’s life was not in danger. Instead, he seemed to have completely ‘subdued’ the rude young woman, so Ying Fei did not feel right to disturb Yang Kai’s business with their presence.

Unfortunately, the arrival of the three still attracted the attention of Yang Kai and Zhu Qing.

Zhu Qing, who was in an intoxicated state as her instincts ran rampant after her strength experienced a bloodline suppression, suddenly regained a trace of sense in her mind and gave a hard bite.

“Ssii…” Yang Kai took a sharp breath as he felt his tongue almost get bitten off, hurriedly lifting his head up to protect himself.

Zhu Qing put her hands on his chest to block him, opening a distance between them. She was gasping for air, her face red, “Enough!” She retorted coldly with her lingering flustered face.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yang Kai was amused by her look, he smiled faintly, “Not enough.”

Zhu Qing was irritated, “Don’t think you can act as you please!” She swept her eyes over Yang Kai, staring at his big hand that was still massaging her peaks and snapped, “Take your dirty hands off of me!”

Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders and squeezed hard, causing Zhu Qing to furrow her brow in pain. Only then did he stand up with a flip.

He also wasn’t shameless enough to continue their ‘activity’ after being spotted by Ying Fei and the others. However, after this activity, he felt that he had vented a lot of the fire in his body. Even though he still felt uncomfortable as he held back, he did not want to continue forcing the reluctant Zhu Qing.

After getting out of Yang Kai’s control, Zhu Qing quickly jumped up and put a thousand meters between her and Yang Kai. Then, she stared at him coldly, mixed feelings flashing across her beautiful eyes.

She only created trouble for Yang Kai because she sensed that Yang Kai had refined some things he absolutely should not have, but she could not believe that she was the one who suffered a big loss in the end.

The feeling of being frivolously molested still remained, making her extremely uncomfortable.

“First time?” Yang Kai asked without lifting his head, ripping off his ragged clothes and putting on another new set.

He did not understand. Since Zhu Qing seemed to have cultivated a powerful Charm Technique and did not hesitate to serve herself to the tiger, how could this possibly be her first time? However, the inexperience she displayed did not seem to be fake.

Yang Kai started to think that Zhu Qing did not actually cultivate any kind of Beguiling Technique. When he recalled his past uncontrollable actions, it seemed that it happened not because he was affected by something she did, but rather by some kind of primal instinct in his own body.

[Do I crave for women to such a degree? I don’t think so…]

“What?” Zhu Qing was puzzled, but soon, she understood what Yang Kai meant and rebuked with her face flushed red again, “None of your damn business!”

“Do you want me to take responsibility then?” Yang Kai winked at her, at the same time secretly circulating his Emperor Qi to gradually calm his rampaging emotions.

“Scram!” Zhu Qing was infuriated, “This isn’t over yet, just you wait!” Then, she turned around and flew away.

“Thank you for your patronage, you’re welcome to come again next time!”

Zhu Qing staggered and nearly fell from the air while Yang Kai’s unbridled laughter that came from behind made her feel even more ashamed.

After flying for a while, she saw the Monster King standing to the side with two weak Humans. When the Monster King saw her, he nodded at her with a smile, as if they knew each other very well.

If it had been before, she would have smashed him with her fist, but now that she had been seen in such a shameful situation, Zhu Qing was too embarrassed to face Ying Fei and instantly turned her tender body into a stream of light as she disappeared across the horizon.

“Young Master Yang is blessed,” Ying Fei raised his brow as he looked at Zhu Qing’s flying figure.

Although the young woman was a little rude, she was incredibly strong and desirable. He had no clue what amazing methods Yang Kai used that could take her down in such a time. As a man, Ying Fei had a deep admiration and respect for Yang Kai.

“En!” Du Xian agreed.

Ye Jing Han glanced sideways at him and snorted, “Why do I smell a sour smell?”

Du Xian was shocked and quickly flattered her with a smile, “No, no, no, that kind of woman doesn’t even deserve to carry Junior Sister’s shoes! In Senior Brother’s eyes, there is only Junior Sister in this world.”

Ye Jing Han shivered and rubbed her arm, “Okay, okay, you’re giving me the creeps.”

The corner of Du Xian’s mouth twitched as he shook his head and sighed.

“Didn’t I tell you all not to come?” Yang Kai’s figure suddenly flew over in front of Ying Fei.

Ying Fei answered embarrassingly, “I wanted to help Young Master Yang at first, but if I had known this was going to happen, I wouldn’t have come. Young Master Yang, please forgive me.”

If he did not lead Ye Jing Han and Du Xian into Yang Kai and Zhu Qing’s business, they might not have separated so soon. With a bit more time, the peanuts would have been shelled and the rice would have been cooked.

Ying Fei felt guilty about it.

“No harm,” Yang Kai waved his hand and stared towards the horizon.

The incident today was indeed weird. Zhu Qing just came up to find trouble with him for no apparent reason, then he ended up rolling around with her, doing some intense physical activity. It was just like an absurd dream that came and went without leaving traces.

There even seemed to be a wisp of residual fragrance when he licked his lips.

“Young Master Yang, where did the young woman… come from?” Ying Fei asked carefully.

Such a powerful young woman definitely had a strong background. If Yang Kai could obtain her, she would be of great assistance to him.

“I don’t know,” Yang Kai shook his head. Although he engaged in close physical contact with Zhu Qing, he only got to know her name and had no clue about her origins.

“Young Master Yang is impressive!” Ying Fei could not help admiring him even more as he just won over the young woman without even knowing her identity. He was simply a model among men, a shining beacon for this generation.

“Haha, I can’t help it if I’m so charming.” Yang Kai burst into laughter.

Ye Jing Han immediately tossed him a disdainful look.

…..

Inside an inn in Flowing Shadow City.

Zhu Qing quickly entered her room and activated the various isolation barriers before she sat down on the bed in a daze. Today, she went out for wool and came home shorn. It was the greatest shame of her life, a stain she would never be able to wash off. But when she thought about the Ancestral Dragon Source inside Yang Kai’s body, she relaxed quite a bit.

That kind of natural suppression was not something she could resist or withstand.

Luckily, she was not completely deluded under its influence and ultimately got away.

This situation involved too many complicated matters and it was no longer something she could handle at will.

After pondering for a while, Zhu Qing took a deep breath to calm her chaotic mind then took out a jade token from her Space Ring. The jade token had a vivid and lifelike dragon carved onto it. Looking at it, it was like a giant dragon pouncing forward.

Zhu Qing put her finger into her mouth and bit her fingertip, drawing a drop of blood that strangely burned like a flame.

The drop of burning blood disappeared into the jade token and it turned a bright red.

Suddenly, the dragon eyes on the token quivered and an aura as deep as the sea fell upon the room.

“Elder!” Zhu Qing greeted the jade token with a solemn face.

“Any news?” An old man’s voice came out of the jade token, one filled with dignity so strong that it stiffened Zhu Qing’s whole body from just hearing it.

“No,” Zhu Qing quickly answered.

“If that’s the case, why did you use the Dragon Talisman?”

Zhu Qing replied, “I saw the Ancestral Dragon Source.”

As soon as she said this, the light on the Dragon Talisman suddenly blinked and the old voice asked hastily, “What did you just say?”
