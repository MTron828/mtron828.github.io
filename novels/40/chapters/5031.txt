All the World Fruits were collected within an hour.

Although there were no more fruits left, the World Tree’s clone before their eyes was extremely precious as well; hence, they wouldn’t want to miss it. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

However, Cha Hu didn’t immediately put the World Fruits inside his Small Universe, and after giving it a thought, he said, “Yang Kai, take this World Tree.”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai was astounded.

Cha Hu went on to say, “Although this King doesn’t know what benefits this thing will bring, I reckon that it wouldn’t cause any harm as it’s a World Tree clone that was planted in an ancient Great Expert’s Small Universe. Even though you’re just a Seventh-Order Master, we have to ensure your safety as you are of critical importance to us. It won’t matter if this thing brings no benefits; however, if there are any benefits, it should help you grow your strength more quickly so that you’ll be able to defend yourself on the Black Ink Battlefield.”

A grateful Yang Kai cupped his fist, “Many thanks, Sir.”

Cha Hu waved his hand, “You are the one who has discovered these 11 Sealed Worlds; without you, we wouldn’t have gained so many benefits in the first place, so you have the right to keep this thing. However, this King has to make one thing clear to you. Even though those from the Inner Sanctum wouldn’t object to it when they find out you’ve acquired this thing, you’ll have to exchange your Military Merits for it. As for how many Military Merits will be needed, that depends on how many benefits you’ll get from this treasure. When we return to the Inner Sanctum, the Army Commanders will ask you about it.”

Yang Kai nodded, “I understand.”

Although he was the one who had discovered the treasures in this Sealed World, the rules were that everything had to be handed in and then exchanged for Military Merits on the Black Ink Battlefield.

“Make a move now. I’ll head over there to have a look around,” Cha Hu said, then shuffled towards the medicine garden. Most of the Spirit Herbs in the medicine garden had been picked, but the unrecognisable ones still remained in place. They wouldn’t dare to pick them lest the medicinal efficacies were damaged.

Standing in front of the World Tree’s clone, Yang Kai activated his Divine Sense and as Space Principles undulated, the Void around him started contorting.

He initially thought that, given his current strength, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to transfer this World Tree clone inside his Small Universe.

Nevertheless, after some investigation, Yang Kai realised that he had been too na?ve.

After Cha Hu finished picking the remaining Spirit Herbs in the medicine garden two hours later, he realised that Yang Kai had been standing in front of the World Tree clone without making a move. Besides that, his face was slightly pale, which suggested that he had consumed quite a lot of energy.

With a frown, Cha Hu appeared beside him and waited patiently.

Another two hours later, Yang Kai opened his eyes and let out a breath.

“What happened?” Cha Hu asked. Bai Yi was also looking at Yang Kai with curiosity.

Yang Kai put on a helpless smile, “Sir, this World Tree clone is closely connected to this Sealed World. They’re inseparable.”

Cha Hu was stunned, “Really?”

As he spoke, he released his Divine Sense into the surroundings. He was more powerful than Yang Kai, so it took him a shorter time to inspect everything. Just like what Yang Kai had said, the World Tree’s clone and this Sealed World were inseparable.

This truly surprised him. When he told Yang Kai to take the World Tree, he was doing it for the latter’s own good. Just like he had said, despite not knowing what benefits the World Tree would bring, it wouldn’t cause any harm to take it. If there were really any benefits, Yang Kai would benefit from them and be able to grow more quickly.

Although a Seventh-Order Master could be considered fairly strong, Yang Kai was still too weak to fight against a Territory Lord, and if he came across a Royal Lord, he wouldn’t even stand a chance to survive.

Cha Hu hoped that Yang Kai could quickly ascend to the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm so that the latter could make more contributions to the Human race; however, since this World Tree clone was closely connected to this Sealed World, even an Eighth-Order Division Commander like him wouldn’t be able to easily take it, let alone Yang Kai.

“What a shame!” Cha Hu let out a sigh.

Yang Kai frowned, “There’s still a way to collect the tree, but it will take some time.”

Cha Hu was puzzled for a moment, but he soon understood what the other man meant, “You can’t do that. Don’t even think about it.”

“You know what I’m talking about, Sir?”

Cha Hu snorted, “Since this thing and the Sealed World are closely connected, you just have to store the entire Sealed World inside your Small Universe in order to take this tree.”

“Exactly,” Yang Kai nodded, “There’s no other way around it.”

Cha Hu said grimly, “By doing so, the different kinds of Dao Essences in this Sealed World will merge with your Small Universe. It would be fine if those Dao Essences complement your Small Universe; they might even strengthen your power. However, if they clash with your Small Universe, they are no different from impurities to you, and they might even affect your foundation. You have to know that this method is what those wicked cultivators use to increase their power by forcefully refining the World Force of Universe Worlds.”

Fundamentally, this Sealed World was a Small Universe left behind by an ancient Great Expert that contained their accumulated cultivation before their death. The Dao Essences hidden in this Sealed World were not all beneficial to Yang Kai; instead, they were likely harmful to him. That was the reason Cha Hu objected to this idea. He wanted Yang Kai to take the World Tree’s clone because he wanted to help the latter grow. Hence, he wouldn’t want to see the younger man harming his foundation.

Yang Kai nodded, “Of course, I understand that. However, please don’t forget that I have a World Spring that can protect my Small Universe from any external influences. With it, it will only take me some time to expel the incompatible World Force and Dao Essences in this Sealed World. By then, this World Tree’s clone will be in my Small Universe.”

Yang Kai had a similar experience before. In the past, when he led the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters from Void Land to hunt Zuo Quan Hui down in the New Great Territory, the latter, who was about to be defeated, spread out his Small Universe in a final attempt to resist. To counterattack, Yang Kai also manifested his Small Universe. Although he eventually managed to kill Zuo Quan Hui, a lot of the latter’s power was deposited in his Small Universe following the clash between their Small Universes.

It took Yang Kai some effort to get rid of these impurities, but his foundation wasn’t affected one bit.

He didn’t have the World Spring at that time either, so now that he did, he wasn’t worried about anything.

Cha Hu was still hesitant, but Yang Kai struck while the iron was hot by saying, “Sir, even Black Ink Strength can’t invade my Small Universe, so why would I be afraid of this Sealed World’s power? It could be said that I’m the most suitable person to collect this treasure.”

Cha Hu was somewhat convinced after hearing that, “However, it will take you quite some time to get rid of all the impurities. Your efforts will go to waste if there are no benefits to be gained.”

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “It will only take some time to give it a try. Even if there are no benefits, I’ll have a World Tree clone in my Small Universe that might bear the World Fruits in the future. Moreover, it’s a clone of the World Tree, there’s no way there wouldn’t be any benefits.”

Cha Hu fell silent for a moment before nodding, “Alright, you can give it a try. This King will stand guard for you. If there’s any anomalies though, you must immediately give it up.”

“Many thanks, Sir.” Yang Kai cupped his fist.

Since it was decided that Yang Kai would put this Sealed World inside his Small Universe, there was no longer a need for any exploration. Cha Hu ordered everyone else to leave.

Soon, Yang Kai and Cha Hu were the only ones left in the Sealed World.

Yang Kai took a deep breath before activating his power to spread out his Small Universe.

The next instant, his Small Universe proliferated at the speed of lightning and engulfed everything.

Cha Hu was hovering in the void and looking around intently. Upon seeing the young man’s Small Universe though, he couldn’t help but arch his brow.

Supposedly, Yang Kai was a newly promoted Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so his foundation shouldn’t be very stable; however, Cha Hu could see that instead of being unsteady, the heritage of Yang Kai’s Small Universe was rich and ample. As the Small Universe spread further, he could also see the living creatures within it. There was also a small spring that provided a steady yet refreshing aura to the entire Small Universe.

When he was shrouded in Yang Kai’s Small Universe, Cha Hu fell into a dazed state for a moment and, for an instant, he felt that his perception of time had been warped.

[Time Principles?] He raised his brow.

Everyone knew that Yang Kai was an expert in the Dao of Space, but no one was aware that he was also skilful in the Dao of Time.

Cha Hu was astounded, wondering how this brat managed to master both the Dao of Space and the Dao of Time at the same time. It had to be noted that it was extremely difficult to learn the basics of either of these Grand Daos, let alone master them. It would be immensely lucky for anyone to be proficient in one of the two esoteric Grand Daos, so it was inconceivable that someone was actually accomplished in both.

While Cha Hu’s emotions undulated, Yang Kai’s Small Universe had already engulfed the entire Sealed World. Seeing that the younger man didn’t feel any discomfort, Cha Hu set his mind at ease.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai turned to him and said, “Please move away from here, Sir.”

After a nod, Cha Hu turned into a ray of light and dashed towards the exit portal.

When Yang Kai was spreading out his Small Universe, there wasn’t a problem with Cha Hu being there; however, now that Yang Kai was about to retrieve his Small Universe, he had to leave. After all, Cha Hu was an Order above Yang Kai, so the capacity of the latter’s Small Universe wasn’t large enough to accommodate him.

After leaving the portal, Cha Hu turned around and felt a tremor coming from the Sealed World. A rumbling sound was heard from time to time, and the location of the portal contorted as though it would break apart at any moment.

This situation lasted for a few days until the portal finally disappeared altogether. The next instant, a figure appeared out of nowhere. It was none other than Yang Kai.

Nonetheless, his face was pale at this moment, and his aura was unstable, as though he had been badly injured.

Bai Yi instantly approached him, but Yang Kai waved his hand to indicate that he was fine.

He looked pale right now because he had forcefully put the Sealed World inside his Small Universe. The Sealed World was a Small Universe left behind by a Great Expert in ancient times. It was expected that Yang Kai would be greatly impacted after taking it in. However, he had no choice but to do so in order to acquire the World Tree.

An average Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master would have seen his Small Universe exploding if he tried to do this. Fortunately, Yang Kai had a World Spring to protect his Small Universe, so although the process was difficult, he wasn’t at risk of losing his life.
