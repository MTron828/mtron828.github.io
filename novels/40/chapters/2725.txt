Even though High Heaven Palace’s sudden rise following the destruction of Seeking Passion Sect was the reason why Full Sky Sect and Fire Dragon Palace had recently formed an alliance, who of them did not have their own selfish motives? Naturally, Mi Qi did not hope for Li Jiao to become too strong.

In his heart, he secretly prayed that Ji Ying would fail to refine the Dragon Blood Pill.

But he also knew how unlikely that was. Ji Ying was an Emperor Grade Alchemist and his skill was unquestionable. If he said he could refine three pills, then he naturally wasn’t just boasting. He was sure he could really do it.

Li Jiao laughed, looking very pleased.

Right at that moment, another strange sound occurred. The three of them were taken by surprise and all turned their attention to the Dragon Blood Flower.

The blooming Dragon Blood Flower which was about to blossom began to unfurl a little, releasing a crimson light that dazzled their eyes.

The three Emperors were all holding their breaths, not turning away for even an instant.

The red light flourished more and more as the flower bloomed like a new life was being born that wanted to break free from that flower as faint Dragon Qi began spreading out in all directions.

*Dong dong, dong dong…*

Li Jiao’s heartbeat could clearly be heard. This matter was directly related to the increase in his strength, so he was naturally even more nervous than the other two.

All of a sudden, as if the birth of the flower was being hindered by something, the light suddenly dimmed a little. Even the petals that were about to open up began to coil up again.

A withering feeling enveloped the entire plant.

Li Jiao’s face changed dramatically and he called out in alarm, “What…”

Ji Ying shouted quickly, “Palace Master Li! Quickly use your Blood Essence to feed it before it’s too late!”

The Dragon Blood Flower could only grow using the Dragon Clan’s Blood Essence as nourishment, so Li Jiao was the only one who could save this peculiar flower at the moment.

When he heard Ji Ying’s words, Li Jiao didn’t think twice and raised his finger, drawing a wound across the tip and using a Secret Technique to draw a drop of his Blood Essence out.

“Go!” He shouted, sending the drop of Blood Essence flying in an arc towards the Dragon Blood Flower, landing steadily into the centre of the bud.

After receiving this nourishment, the Dragon Blood Flower regained its vitality as expected. The petals began to unfurl even faster than before, its peculiar fragrance permeating in the air.

On the other hand, Li Jiao, who had forced out that drop of Blood Essence, was slightly pale-faced at the moment, looking as if his foundation had been severely damaged. A drop of Blood Essence would require at least ten years of dedicated cultivation to restore, but when he thought of the wonderful uses of the Dragon Blood Pill, Li Jiao felt it was all worth it.

A loud dragon roar suddenly echoed as the Dragon Blood Flower blossomed in an instant. Following that, a red light sprang out, shooting straight into the sky like a living creature.

Ji Ying had been prepared early and he reacted quickly, reaching out his hand and making a grabbing motion, causing the red light to freeze mid-air, though it still struggled visibly.

Mi Qi and Li Jiao watched intently, both revealing looks of amazement.

That was because they saw the red light take the shape of a tiny dragon…

“This is a Dragon Blood Flower?” Li Jiao and Mi Qi looked at each other. They were both in disbelief. This Dragon Blood Flower didn’t look like a flower in the slightest, but rather the spirit of a dragon. Was this truly the Dragon Blood Flower?

Ji Ying took out a wooden box that smelled of fragrant sandalwood in excitement and put the Dragon Blood Flower into it before sealing it. Only then did he breathe a sigh of relief, “Fortunately it is not of a high grade, otherwise I really wouldn’t have been able to suppress it!”

The Dragon Blood Flower can only be produced on Dragon Island, and also subdued by only the Dragon Clan.

“Since the spirit flower has bloomed, I will leave the Alchemy to Grandmaster Ji,” suppressing the excitement in his heart, Li Jiao said respectfully to him.

“En. Just leave everything to me. Palace Master Li, if you prepare a secluded chamber for me…” Ji Ying nodded.

“Yes, yes!” Li Jiao was overjoyed. He thought that Ji Ying would bring the Dragon Blood Flower back to Medicine Pill Valley in order to refine it, but from what he said, he seemed to have the intention to start refining the pill here. So, how could he not be happy?

Mi Qi forced out a smile, “Brother Li, you should go handle that. I’ll stay and accompany Grandmaster Ji here.”

Li Jiao nodded, “Good! Please wait for a moment!”

After that, he turned to leave.

Right then, Ji Ying suddenly took out his communication artifact, but after checking it for a moment, his originally joyful appearance suddenly became filled with rage as he shouted, “Impudence!”

Li Jiao was startled and quickly turned around and asked, “What happened?”

He thought he had accidentally offended Ji Ying somehow.

Mi Qi also asked curiously, “Grandmaster Ji, what happened?”

Ji Ying’s face turned dark, “Li Xuan was beaten!”

“Li Xuan…” Both Mi Qi and Li Jiao muttered that name before quickly recalling. Wasn’t Li Xuan one of Grandmaster Ji’s disciples? That boy wasn’t old, but both his talent in cultivation and Alchemy were quite outstanding, so he was valued and nurtured greatly by Ji Ying. He had followed Ji Ying here a few days ago to Fire Dragon Palace, but was sent out to collect spirit herbs after the Dragon Blood Flower incident.

“Was it Ice Heart Valley or High Heaven Palace?” Mi Qi’s heart was beating wildly and he couldn’t help but ask in excitement.

If it were the people from High Heaven Palace who beat Li Xuan up, then there would be a good show for them to watch. He and Li Jiao were worrying over how they could keep High Heaven Palace’s arrogance in check, or better, suppress them. They didn’t expect High Heaven Palace to put themselves on the plate before they could even come up with a solution.

“It’s that High Heaven Palace’s Palace Master!” Ji Ying had a furious expression on his face, “He beat my disciple and stole the Source Crystals I gave him to buy the spirit herbs with. This High Heaven Palace is simply lawless!”

“What?” Mi Qi was shocked, “They didn’t just beat people but even snatched their Source Crystals? This…”

He almost couldn’t help himself from throwing his head back and laughing, thinking to himself, [High Heaven Palace, you’re asking for your own destruction! You think you can touch the people from Medicine Pill Valley however you please?]

“Such impudence! How dare High Heaven Palace despise Medicine Pill Valley! I, Li Jiao, and he are absolutely irreconcilable!” Li Jiao also realized that an opportunity had come and quickly exclaimed.

“Palace Master Li, I’m afraid this Alchemy matter will have to be delayed for now. This concerns the reputation of my Medicine Pill Valley so I must make a trip there personally to see just what that High Heaven Palace is trying to do!” Ji Ying yelled. Even though he promised Li Jiao, this was an important matter that he could not delay; otherwise, if word got out, then it would damage the prestige of both Medicine Pill Valley and Wondrous Pill Great Emperor.

“This… It can’t be helped.” Li Jiao was slightly exasperated. He could have gotten the Dragon Blood Pill immediately, but he didn’t expect such an incident to happen out of nowhere. He already had a bad impression of High Heaven Palace to begin with, so now he hated them even more.

“But Grandmaster Ji, it’s better not to go alone,” Mi Qi frowned.

Ji Ying snorted, “What’s wrong? Would he still dare to act unruly even if I make an appearance personally?”

Mi Qi said with a straight face, “If it were a Northern Territory cultivator like us, then we naturally wouldn’t dare be impudent in front of Grandmaster Ji. However, I heard that High Heaven Palace’s Palace Master is not from the Northern Territory. It seems he is from the Southern Territory. What’s more, he is a domineering and unreasonable man who uses all kinds of cruel methods. If that wasn’t the case, he wouldn’t have wiped out the Seeking Passion Sect. It is better to be on guard against such a ruthless and bloodthirsty man. Grandmaster Ji must not risk his safety so easily!”

“What Brother Mi Qi said is right,” Li Jiao nodded, “I have also heard that not only is that brat surnamed Yang savage and domineering, he also colludes with the Monster Race. It is best to be on guard.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Ji Ying declared, “Even if I must enter a dragon’s cave, I must go. My disciple has been beaten and my Source Crystals robbed. If I stay silent on this matter, how will I face my Honoured Master when I return to Medicine Pill Valley?”

“Naturally, the trip has to be made,” Mi Qi and Li Jiao glanced at each other, “But Grandmaster Ji mustn’t go alone.”

“Indeed,” Li Jiao nodded, “How about this, as Brother Mi Qi and I are both free, we can accompany Grandmaster Ji to keep the situation under control. Let’s see if that High Heaven Palace truly wants to go against the Heavens!”

“Brother Li makes a good suggestion. I agree. If that High Heaven Palace really dares to disrespect Grandmaster Ji, then Brother Li and I will put our lives on the line in order to protect you!”

“Then… I shall trouble you both.” Ji Ying also did not refuse them, mainly because he was feeling anxious from hearing what these two had to say. He was truly worried that High Heaven Palace would not take his status into account and lay a hand on him.

“We must not delay. Let us set off!”

…..

High Heaven Palace, atop a certain mountain peak. Yang Kai was currently lying on the ground, legs crossed, lazily soaking in the sun.

It was a bright day today with not a cloud in the sky, and he was currently being accompanied by beauties in this sunny world.

Zhu Qing, who was pouring wine for him to the side, grit her teeth and spat as she shoved the cup in front of him, “Drink!”

In order not to lose him again, Zhu Qing decided to stick by his side at all times, forcing her to endure humiliation after humiliation. She had to put up with Yang Kai’s various criticisms and commands, and now she was even serving him like a maid.

Her pride was being trampled into a mess, and Zhu Qing felt that there was simply no one more hateful than this man in front of her right now.

“Ah…” Yang Kai opened his mouth but did not move.

Zhu Qing shot him a hateful glare before lifting the cup to his mouth and pouring it drink down.

He drank it in one gulp.

“Ah…” Yang Kai opened his mouth again, eyes slightly narrowed with a pleasant expression.

Flames of fury were tumbling around in Zhu Qing’s chest and wanted nothing more than to burn this man alive with her Dragon Flames, but she still reached over to pick up a grape-like berry and pop it into Yang Kai’s mouth.

After chewing a few times, Yang Kai swallowed the fruit, then turned to his side and propped his head up with his hand, looking at Zhu Qing, “Qing’er, how’s your Dragon Island right now?”

Zhu Qing responded indifferently, “If you want to know, then just follow me over.”

“You’re talking about that again,” Yang Kai frowned, “Do you not want to be friends anymore?”

“You’re the one who asked,” a trace of panic flashed past Zhu Qing’s face. It took a lot of effort for her and Yang Kai to become ‘friends’, so if he really cut off their relationship because of this, then she would be done for.

Yang Kai grinned meaningfully, looking at her with interest, he asked, “Do you have any other friends?”

Zhu Qing shook her head.

[Why would a Dragon need friends? What a joke.]

Yang Kai said with a serious look, “Let me tell you, there are many types of friends. Even though we’re friends now, we’re nothing more than the most ordinary of friends.”

“There are other types?” Zhu Qing furrowed her brows and asked curiously.

“Naturally so,” Yang Kai nodded pretentiously, “There are normal friends, then you have close friends above that. And if you go further… intimate friends! En, if we were intimate friends, then that would change our relationship. If it were so, it would not be impossible for me to consider visiting Dragon Island.”

Zhu Qing’s eyes lit up, “Then let’s be intimate friends?”

“Do you really want to?” Yang Kai looked at her with a solemn expression.

“Of course! Let’s be intimate!” Zhu Qing nodded with certainty.
