‚ÄúWu Chang, you bastard, it seems you are not going to die a peaceful death!‚Äù Xiao Bai Yi saw Wu Chang on the left, flee. Meanwhile, the Flame Beast was chasing him and the others, releasing a deafening roar.

Wu Chang said nothing and gave him a look of mockery as he fled at an extremely fast speed.

‚ÄúRoar...‚Äù

The earth-shattering roar came out again, producing a powerful shockwave, catching many off guard. The red flaming laser that followed was even more horrifying. It was a move capable of disintegrating their bones and all.

Fortunately, everyone had seen the Flame Beast use this before, so as soon as they heard the roar, they hurriedly changed direction and avoided the deadly attack.

‚ÄúSplit up. Fate will decide our life and death today!‚Äù Xiao Bai Yi yelled, and while speaking, he was the first to change where he was headed. He hurriedly turned to attack the Flame Beast.

That was how he was. He was obviously trying to divert the Flame Beast away so that the others had time to escape.

As the leader of the team, Xiao Bai Yi‚Äôs decision was appropriate.

It was a pity that the attack didn‚Äôt hurt. Before it hit Flame Beast, it was completely destroyed by the scorching fire on its body.

Flame Beast didn‚Äôt pay any attention to him, and carried on chasing the others.

After Xiao Bai Yi said his piece, the others scattered, turning into streamers of various colours, and fleeing in different directions.

‚ÄúNo way. Is my luck this amazing?‚Äù Yang Kai looked back in a hurry, but saw that Flame Beast was chasing him, ignoring other people.

‚ÄúYour dog‚Äôs eyes must be blind. Just staring at me and not chasing the others. But this is also good,‚Äù he said to himself. Although facing such a terrifying being, he did not have the capabilities to fight with it. Even Yang Kai had a little confidence he could escape from it.

And as long as Flame Beast kept chasing him, the others were safe.

Although Yang Kai didn‚Äôt have much friendship with members from the Azure Sun Temple, entering the Four Seasons Realm could be considered as occupying one of their places, and doing this was within his acceptable range of contributing back to them.

Seeing the Flame Beast chasing after him, he slowed down and kept a certain distance between himself and the Beast. He still left himself some room to evade attacks, as he led it to the depths of the Four Seasons Realm.

Gradually, Yang Kai could no longer see the others. The Flame Beast was persistent; it kept chasing after him, and from time to time, it spouted the scorching energy attack from its mouth.

In terms of strength, it was certainly strong. But still, it was only a Monster Beast. The long-range attack was linear and did not cover that much of an area, so Yang Kai did not bother to avoid it. As long as he prepared in advance, he did not have to worry about being hit.

After half an hour. Yang Kai estimated that it was almost done, and then, he suddenly urged his Source Qi to increase speed.

The canoe Aunty Feng gave him was of Dao Source Grade High-Rank. Except for Emperor Artifacts, it was the best flight-type artifact. Furthermore, it was very small in size, extremely suitable for solo flight. With little effort on his side, Flame Beast could only follow his ass and eat ash.

After a while, from a very distant location, the Flame Beast let loose an unwilling roar, but it had long since disappeared from Yang Kai‚Äôs sight. Obviously, it did not know how far Yang Kai flew off.

But Yang Kai still did not let up. He continued to release Divine Sense to explore the surroundings while continuing to fly further.

After another half hour, he waited until he was sure that he was safe before he landed.

He was still in the Realm of Summer, and where the environment was scorching hot. The place where Yang Kai landed was a dry plain. Looking around, ‚Äãseveral thousand kilometres could be seen at a glance.

He took out the jade slip, checked the map of the Four Seasons Realm, and compared the places he had passed before to recognize where he was.

After a while, he summoned the canoe again and flew away.

His main purpose for entering the Four Seasons Realm was to find the Tribulation Fruit.

The Tribulation Fruit only grew in the cold environment, so it could not be in the Realm of Summer. He had to rush to the Realm of Winter as soon as possible to hope to find the spirit fruit.

In this Sealed World, he didn‚Äôt dare to fly too high and had to remain vigilant at all times. This was quite draining on his Divine Senses.

After an hour, Yang Kai flew over a cracked canyon.

But he flew back to it again, suspended in the air, looking into the canyon.

[I don‚Äôt know if this gorge was naturally generated or not. It‚Äôs not bottomless. But looking from above, everything inside is dark. I even hear the roaring winds from inside as well.]

The reason he flew back was that he had noticed something unique.

He took a closer look, he couldn‚Äôt help but brighten up his eyes and whispered, ‚ÄúCould it be...‚Äù

He rushed towards the bottom of the canyon.

It could be said that the Realm of Summer was hot everywhere, but the inside of this canyon was not affected by that. After entering it, Yang Kai felt a hint of cold. The further down he went, the less heat he felt.

That made him feel that his observation was not wrong.

The canyon was at least a few thousand metres deep, and when Yang Kai fell to two thousand metres, he could see some mist covering the area.

‚ÄúHaha, it really is a Spirit Qi Sea!‚Äù he laughed.

From the information in the jade slip, he learned that there were places of extremely abundant World Energy in the Four Seasons Realm, like a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãclouds and mist ‚Äì the Spirit Qi Sea.

The World Energy contained in the Spirit Qi Sea was rich and extremely pure. It was most suitable for a cultivator‚Äôs cultivation.

However, because each Four Seasons Realm was only open for 33 days, even if cultivators encountered the Spirit Qi Sea, they could not stay for too long. At most, they would look for the Spirit Qi Sea and see if they could find any precious treasure.

The chances of a precious treasure being born in such a place with abundant World Energy were not small.

Some people found Emperor Grade spirit medicines from a Spirit Qi Sea, and their value was immeasurable, but others even encountered accidents in a Spirit Qi Sea.

Monster Beasts also enjoyed places with strong World Energy, so there was a strong possibility that there were some powerful Monster Beasts below.

The Spirit Qi Sea below the gorge was comparable to the situation where the World Energy converged when the Four Seasons Realm was opened. The more Yang Kai went down, the denser the World Energy got.

Being in such a place, even if he was not cultivating, the omnipresent World Energy penetrated his pores and restored the power he had consumed.

It took a full quarter of an hour before Yang Kai reached the bottom of the canyon. The ground seemed to be made of a material similar to gravel and was a little messy, but it did not seem to be dangerous. After Yang Kai released his Divine Sense, he did not notice any signs of living beings.

However, he did not relax his vigilance and walked around to check. After confirming that this area was safe, he returned to where he originally was.

He then took out the Sealed World Bead and injected some Qi into it. Explore new ùíèovels on nùíêvelbiùíè(.)com

In the next moment, three beautiful shadows appeared together.

One sat down cross-legged, as if cultivating, one stood silently, with an expressionless face, and the last was lying on the ground with a bored look, eyes empty and lacklustre.

Yang Kai glanced at the figure lying on the ground and could not help but sneer.

‚ÄúSir!‚Äù Zhang Ruo Xi, who was cross-legged meditating, heard a sound, opened her eyes and saw that Yang Kai appeared in front of her, and quickly got up.

Liu Yan, who appeared at the same time, also gently nodded to Yang Kai, and then looked around with her beautiful eyes to check the surroundings.

And Hua Qing Si, who was lying on the ground with a lazy look, was taken by surprise. Still a little groggy, she jumped up from the ground, urging Source Qi in her body. Looking at Yang Kai, and spoke up, ‚ÄúYou bastard, what are you playing at?‚Äù

She had been imprisoned by Yang Kai in the Small Sealed World.

In that damned place, she was left alone, without anyone to speak to. She was about to be tortured to death.

She was lying on the ground and did not want to be summoned by Yang Kai directly. After all, such a scene caused her image to worsen. As a woman who wanted face, she naturally became angry out of shame.

While she was talking, her beautiful eyes burst into flames, her silver teeth rattled, her beautiful eyes looked left and right, and she suddenly fixated on Zhang Ruo Xi.

Yang Kai smiled and said, ‚ÄúBefore you take any action, I have to warn you. If you dare to attack her, or try to capture her to threaten me, the consequences will be very serious. Other than that, I advise you to stay quiet!‚Äù

Hua Qing Si‚Äôs expression could not help but change slightly, and a hint of hesitation flashed across her face.

She really wanted to take down Zhang Ruo Xi, who was the weakest. Although she did not know what the relationship between Zhang Ruo Xi and Yang Kai was, she still had some guesses. After all, she did hear the little girl address him as ‚ÄòSir‚Äô.

As long as Zhang Ruo Xi could be captured, she should obtain some leverage to negotiate with Yang Kai.

Her expression changed, and Yang Kai said again, ‚ÄúThe idea of going for me is even dumber. Since I dared to let you out, I can throw you back in again! If you do not want to suffer, just stay still.‚Äù

Hua Qing Si grit her teeth and replied, ‚ÄúYou devil, I curse you to die without a corpse!‚Äù

‚ÄúWords don‚Äôt hurt me so they are worth nothing!‚Äù Yang Kai curled his lips. After speaking, he turned to Zhang Ruo Xi. ‚ÄúThe World Energy here is very rich. You should cultivate here, and Liu Yan will stand guard for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Zhang Ruo Xi did not ask any further questions and obeyed Yang Kai‚Äôs orders. She continued to sit cross-legged, closed her eyes and cultivated.

‚ÄúBut I cannot give you too much time. Two days at most,‚Äù Yang Kai added.

After speaking, he stretched out his hand and patted the Sealed World Bead. A ray of light flashed. Then, World Energy started to get sucked in. The force of attraction was so strong that it seemed all of the surrounding World energy was crashing into it.

On the surface of the Sealed World Bead, a small tornado of World Energy appeared, visible to the naked eye.
