Not just Qiu Ran, Chen Qian also opened her pair of beautiful eyes wide and covered her red lips with a small hand, staring appallingly at Gao Xue Ting.

It was the same for all of the Emperor Realms, they were dumbfounded.

Even the Emperor Realms who usually kept their face straight were affected by this scene, so there is no doubt that those disciples were naturally more shocked.

Everyone gaped at Gao Xue Ting in astonishment, as if their eyes were popping out. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Everyone... Why are you looking at me like this? Is there something on my face?” Gao Xue Ting asked faintly. The corner of her mouth curved slightly, revealing a charming smile, but her beautiful eyes were filled with intimidation.

An inexplicable chill struck them, making everyone shiver like they were in an igloo.

*Dong Dong...*

The sound of gulpings could be heard.

“Did I see it wrongly? Elder Gao is actually... smiling?” a voice came in suddenly.

“She really smiled! Oh my god, for several dozen years, since this disciple came to this temple, never have I seen Elder Gao reveal her smile. Now that I have seen it, I have no more regrets.”

“This is not real, this is not real, this is not real... It’s my imagination, it’s my imagination, it’s my imagination...”

A bunch of Dao Source Realm disciples were baffled, they could not believe their eyes. And the reason for it was Gao Xue Ting’s smile.

“You guys seem to have a lot of opinions about this Queen!” Gao Xue Ting turned to the disciples after hearing their discussions. She still continued smiling, but her expression became even stiffer.

None of the disciples dared to have eye contact with her. All of them turned their eyes away, afraid of getting caught by her.

“Sister Gao...” Chen Qian stepped forward and asked in worry, “Are you okay?”

“What’s not okay about me?” Gao Xue Ting slightly smiled and grit her teeth, staring at Wen Zi Shan as she spoke. “I’m okay!”

“Oh...” Chen Qian did not know what to say, confused.

Aside from those Dao Source Realm disciples, even her, a Sect Elder who was often together with Gao Xue Ting, had never seen Gao Xue Ting smiling, not to mention that she was smiling for so long. This made her feel strange and scared, and she could not help but shiver.

“Gao... Elder Gao!” Qiu Ran could not stand it anymore. Even though it was gratifying to finally see Gao Xue Ting smiling, her smile was more frightening than her usual cold expression. As a Deputy Temple Master, he thought that it was his duty to give her advice, “Stop forcing yourself!”

Gao Xue Ting turned to him, still smiling, and said, “Forcing myself? I’m not... Why? Does Senior Qiu find the smile of this Queen to be ugly?”

“No such thing!” Qiu Ran was shocked, immediately denying and changing the topic, “The disciples are all assembled. Elder Gao, do you have anything to tell them?”

“What else is there to say?” Gao Xue Ting’s eyes swept across the twenty Dao Source Realm cultivators and said crisply, “I’ll tell them during the journey, so now... Let’s depart!”

While speaking, she opened her mouth and spit out a miniature ship. With both her hands clenched together while chanting an incantation, the ship enlarged suddenly, reaching a length of several tens of meters, then it gradually stopped.

The design of the ship was slick and exquisite, with dragons and phoenixes carved on it, much better than the ship that Yang Kai got before.

After all, it was an artifact that belonged to an Emperor Realm, a flight type artifact of Dao Source Grade High-Rank!

“Get on board!” Gao Xue Ting said.

The Dao Source Realm cultivators did not dare to hesitate, they performed their movement skills and boarded the ship. Yang Kai followed the crowd, casually found a spot after he got onto the ship and sat down with his legs crossed.

Gao Xue Ting waited for everyone to settle down, then started to move towards the deck.

After that, she turned around slowly, with a ghastly grin on her face, staring at Wen Zi Shan, who had been hiding the whole time in the crowd, and said through her gritted teeth, “Wait for me... I will deal with you later!”

She looked like she had suffered from a shameful humiliation, which made her feel like killing him.

“Bon... voyage!” Wen Zi Shan waved his hand, with his body shaking lightly.

“Humph!” Gao Xue Ting coldly snorted, with a surge of Source Qi, the ship instantly speeded up and flew out of Azure Sun Mountain Range.

Unstoppable laughter burst out when the ship got out of everyone’s sight.

Wen Zi Shan laughed until his tears were about to flow out, hugging his own stomach and almost needed to roll on the floor to relieve himself. He spoke while continuing laughing, “Did you... did you see Little Xue Ting’s... face? HAHAHAHA, it was so funny...”

“Haiz... How improper!” Qiu Ran looked speechless, shook his head in sorrow, flicked his sleeves and walked away.

“Sir Temple Master, please behave yourself!” another Emperor Realm could not stand it anymore either, and he felt ashamed of this person.

“You are so dead!” Chen Qian looked at Wen Zi Shan in disdain, “Wait until Sister Gao comes back from the Four Seasons Realm, and see how she will deal with you!”

When the conversations ended, the people started to leave one by one, leaving Wen Zi Shan alone.

After a while, he got tired of laughing too. He straightened up with a solemn look and sadly mumbled to himself, “It seems that I haven’t seen Little Xue Ting’s smile for many years. I really miss it... She was such a playful and clingy girl during her younger days, why did she become so cold these days? Well, no wonder there is a saying: A girl changes quickly from childhood to womanhood!”

...

Everyone was quiet on the ship.

All twenty Dao Source Realms were silently cycling their Source Qi in order to resist the chill from the front.

Gao Xue Ting had been standing in front of the deck the whole time. From the time they departed until now, she had exuded a kind of bone-chilling sensation, which seemed to be able to freeze one’s soul.

From time to time, Gao Xue Ting chuckled like a crazy person, which made everyone feel creeped out.

In this situation, who would dare trigger Gao Xue Ting? Therefore, no one dared to make a noise, not even a whisper. Everyone was just giving each other uncomfortable looks.

Azure Sun Temple had twenty slots for entering the Four Seasons Realm. Initially, the slots were owned by the top twenty Dao Source Realm disciples in the Sect’s martial art challenge, but since Xue Yi was defeated by Yang Kai, Yang Kai had become the only outsider here.

Among the twenty people, seven were women and the rest were men.

Yang Kai only knew Xiao Bai Yi and Xia Sheng among them. He did not even know the names of the others.

However, he did not bother to inquire. His main purpose of this Four Seasons Realm journey was the Tribulation Fruit. As long as he could find this spirit fruit, he would not let Qin Zhao Yang down.

The ship was indeed a Dao Source Grade High-Rank artifact, it was remarkably fast.

There were no obstacles along the flying trip.

After all, an Emperor Realm master was guarding, an extremely foul mood Emperor Realm. The stormy murderous intent released by her put all of the cultivators in fear, and they were not foolish enough to cause a disaster.

This situation lasted for three days!

Three days later, Gao Xue Ting, who had been standing in front of the deck with her back to the people, suddenly turned around.

Sensing this, everyone’s expressions turned solemn, immediately opened their eyes and looked at her, feeling a great deal of apprehension.

But after seeing Gao Xue Ting’s face clearly, everyone breathed out a sigh of relief simultaneously.

Because Gao Xue Ting at this moment had finally regained her indifferent and cold expression, replacing the strange and scary smile on her face.

Yang Kai heard a lot of them secretly sighing.

“Elder Gao’s face indeed looks a lot more comfortable like this,” Xia Sheng said with a lingering fear while patting his chest. “Before this, Elder Gao looked like a completely different person, her face really scared me to death!”

As soon as he said this, Xiao Bai Yi sensed the incoming danger and quickly slapped Xia Sheng in the face.

Xia Sheng was stunned by the slap, and glared fiercely at Xiao Bai Yi, “Xiao Bai, did you just backstab me? How despicable and shameless of you! Believe it or not...”

Before he finished his sentence, Xia Sheng shivered involuntarily. He slowly lifted his head and looked at the spooky appearance in front of him. It was Gao Xue Ting staring down at him. With his mouth twitching, he weakly asked, “Elder Gao, did this disciple... say something wrong?”

“No such thing!” Gao Xue Ting replied faintly. Soon, she suddenly smiled and said, “Is this the face... that scared you to death!?”

The face of Xia Sheng turned green.

Gao Xue Ting stretched out her hand, catching him off guard, and lifted Xia Sheng before tossing him out of the ship like a piece of rubbish. Her moves were smooth as silk and fast as lightning.

“Elder Gao...” Xia Sheng’s shout came from afar, but he was just a little dot from the view on the ship.

“Great! The unpleasant guy is gone!” Gao Xue Ting clapped her hands and swept across the crowd with her eyes.

Those disciples who were seen by her during the process lowered their head and avoided contact with her eyes.

“That idiot!” Xiao Bai Yi cursed secretly in his heart. At the same time, he glanced at his back and saw that Xia Sheng was trying hard to catch up. As the top in Sect’s martial art challenge, he was undoubtedly strong and had hastily caught up with the ship.

However, there was a fluorescent curtain acting as a barrier on the ship. If Gao Xue Ting did not open the barrier, Xia Sheng would not be able to get on the ship, so he could only stick to the fluorescent curtain and kept crying for mercy.

Gao Xue Ting turned a deaf ear to his crying, and when she got irritated, she just isolated his voice with a wave of her hand.

Many of them looked at Xia Sheng with sympathy, feeling sorrow for his misfortune.

“I have one thing to tell you.” Gao Xue Ting spoke suddenly.

Everyone held their breath and looked at her intently.

“The Four Seasons Realm this time is a little different from previous years!” Gao Xue Ting continued, “You should have obtained the information of the Four Seasons Realm before you departed. I don’t need to say anything more about this, but this time, a Star Seal will appear in the Four Seasons Realm!”

“Star Seal?” Xiao Bai Yi’s face shifted, as if he thought of something. He questioned in astonishment, “The Star Seal that is related to the Shattered Star Sea?”

Gao Xue Ting glanced at him approvingly, and said, “Yes, it’s those Star Seals that are related to the Shattered Star Sea! The Star Seal is a certificate pass to enter the Shattered Star Sea, so those who obtain it may enter the Shattered Star Sea when it’s opened! As such, this Queen needs you to work hard in the Four Seasons Realm. Finding Star Seals will be your primary objective, and it is also your only objective!”
