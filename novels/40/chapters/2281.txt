Chapter 2281, You’ve Got Good Muscles Young Man

“I want to help, but I’m really too busy and have no time to spare for this. Didn’t I already tell you that I’ll go there once I have free time?” Yang Kai explained.

Ye Jing Han mulled this over for a moment then said through gnashed teeth, “Young Master Yang, our Thousand Leaves Sect’s sealed world has a Restricted Area known as the Emperor Heaven Valley. If one can cultivate in that land for a few days, it will greatly increase one’s chances to reach the Emperor Realm.”

Yang Kai glanced at her with a meaningful smile.

Ye Jing Han’s pretty face got flushed, “It is not that I was distrustful of you, but this matter is very important and I cannot disclose more information to you, or else, innumerable Dao Source Realm Cultivators will begin targeting us. Our Thousand Leaves Sect isn’t powerful enough now and can’t defend against them.”

Yang Kai chuckled and said, “The Emperor Heaven Valley, what a grand name! But, what does this have to do with me?”

Ye Jing Han stamped the ground, “Young Master Yang, if you repair our Space Array and help us regain our Sealed World, I can let you go in.”

“What’s your status in the Thousand Leaves Sect?” Yang Kai squinted his eyes and looked at her.

Ye Jing Han said, “I’m the daughter of the current Thousand Leaves Sect’s Master, Ye Hen.”

“So you’re a Young Sect Lady,” Yang Kai cupped his fists at her. “Sorry for the disrespect.”

Ye Jing Han’s face got flushed, “Young Master Yang, don’t make fun of me.”

Yang Kai had beaten even the Young Palace Master of Flying Saint Palace, so he wouldn’t take the Young Sect Lady of Thousand Leaves Sect seriously. As such, Ye Jing Han didn’t believe that her status was anything special and that was why she didn’t disclose it to Yang Kai from the beginning.

But now, she had to tell Yang Kai her status to gain his trust.

“Young Master Yang, please, I’m begging you...” Ye Jing Han said entreatingly with an aggrieved look, “My father is already old, and if he cannot break through to the Emperor Realm, he will die in a few years. However, it isn’t so easy to reach the Emperor Realm and the Emperor Heaven Valley is his greatest chance. Young Master Yang, if you help our Thousand Leaves Sect, then I can agree to any requests you raise.”

Yang Kai was surprised by her statement. She had already thrown all caution to the wind.

Yang Kai descended into silence and Ye Jing Han also quieted, not daring to even gasp for breath. She only pursed her lips and stood there waiting for him nervously. Only her strong and fast heartbeat still reverberated in the room.

After a long while, Yang Kai sighed, “Fine, I’ll take a trip with you there.”

“Are you serious?” Ye Jing Han was so delighted that she wept and she looked in disbelief at Yang Kai.

“But not now, you also know what’s happening in Maplewood City. You’ll have to wait until I deal with this matter.”

“I’m not in a hurry, so I can wait,” Ye Jing Han quickly waved her hand and said, “I have already waited for so many years so I don’t mind waiting a little longer.”

“But I must still say this ahead of time,” Yang Kai looked at her grimly, “I’ll only give it a try and I’m not sure I can repair your Space Array.”

“That’s more than enough.”

“Go look for a room to rest. I’ll notify you when it’s time to set off,” Yang Kai waved his hand at her in dismissal. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Young Master Yang, I’ll await good news from you.”

Saying so, she bowed to him then left without forgetting to close the door behind her.

After Ye Jing Han left, Yang Kai let out a sigh and sat down, mumbling to himself, “I’ve gotten involved in something troublesome...”

He wasn’t close to Ye Jing Han and he also had no contact with Thousand Leaves Sect, so he didn’t want to tread into this muddy water. But, Ye Jing Han had bothered him for so long that if he didn’t agree, then she might have followed him to the ends of the world, and that would have been even more troublesome for him.

If he was followed all day long by a young woman with a sorrowful look, then people oblivious to the situation would assume that he had thoughtless sex with her then abandoned her. That would have been too scandalous!

Moreover, he was also quite interested in the Emperor Heaven Valley mentioned by Ye Jing Han. Since it could help one advance into the Emperor Realm, it was surely related to the comprehension of the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao.

Yang Kai was still a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, but deepening his comprehension of the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao would still be beneficial to his future growth, and if he added the Extraordinary Treasure Pill to the equation, then he would be able to easily break through to the Emperor Realm in the future.

Yang Kai sat down and cultivated in the room in silence until midnight. He had just reached the Second-Order Dao Source Realm, and he obviously had to consolidate his cultivation base.

At night, Yang Kai pushed open the door and left. As his body flickered, he reached the City Lord’s Mansion in a dozen breaths.

The guards standing outside the City Lord’s Mansion weren’t any different than paper figures to him, but when he was about to enter the mansion, a chill suddenly ran down his spine as he felt several powerful Divine Senses sweeping his body.

They had swept him only for a short moment, yet his body still shivered uncontrollably and broke into a cold sweat. Those Divine Senses belonged to Emperor Realm Masters, which meant that Xiao Yu Yang and his companions were also residing in the City Lord’s Mansion.

Those Divine Senses had checked him only for a short moment then left him, but one of them still lingered on him.

Yang Kai took a breath and followed that Divine Sense towards its source. After a short while, he reached a room and he raised his hand to knock on its door, yet before he made contact, Gao Xue Ting’s voice suddenly reached him, “Come in!”

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai pushed open the door and entered. He sighted upon Gao Xue Ting sitting cross-legged on the bed with her pretty eyes gazing at him.

Yang Kai grinned, “Greeting Elder Gao. I didn’t expect that we would reunite again in Maplewood City... Huh, Elder Gao, what are you up to?”

As he spoke, he suddenly saw Gao Xue Ting waving her hand. Her Qi surging out, closing the door and creating a formless barrier that enveloped the whole room, isolating it completely.

“She’s so prudent, does she have to make a barrier even for this?” A resentful voice reverberated in another room. Xiao Yu Yang’s eyes snapped open with a playful look apparent on his face, “What are you up to, Junior Sister Gao? I just simply wanted to see what is so amazing about this little brat, yet it seems my efforts are in vain.”

Meanwhile, the Emperor Realm Masters in the other rooms twitched their mouths. They were obviously all spying on Gao Xue Ting as well, yet they had now been blocked by the barrier.

...

In a short moment, the room had been isolated thoroughly.

*Gudong*

Yang Kai gulped as he suddenly had a bad feeling about this.

“Strip!” Gao Xue Ting instructed Yang Kai expressionlessly.

“Huh?” Yang Kai’s expression changed and he said in surprise, “This, this... This isn’t appropriate, is it?”

“What are you grumbling about?” Gao Xue Ting snorted, seemingly annoyed by Yang Kai’s objections.

Yang Kai couldn’t even see what happened before Gao Xue Ting suddenly appeared in front of him and stretched her hand towards him.

Yang Kai felt like Gao Xue Ting’s lily-white fingers weren’t any different than five mountains assaulting him, making her grasp impossible to avoid.

Soon after, Gao Xue Ting clutched his neck and lifted him. He was shortly sent spinning by a pulse of energy, while his clothes were quickly stripped off him. In the twinkling of an eye, he was left with only his underpants.

“Elder Gao... Stop...” Yang Kai let out a shrill cry.

Gao Xue Ting turned a deaf ear to him. She stopped spinning him then tapped several points on his body, her pretty eyes shining brightly as she observed closely.

Gao Xue Ting’s pretty eyes swept every nook of Yang Kai’s body and she examined him thoroughly.

After a long while, she nodded and said, “Pretty good, there are no issues to speak of.”

As her voice fell, the force confining Yang Kai suddenly disappeared.

Yang Kai quickly crawled into Gao Xue Ting’s bed and covered himself with the quilt. He sat there shivering, as if he had just suffered some severe mental damage.

Gao Xue Ting sneered. “You’re still bashful?”

Yang Kai’s face was pale and he couldn’t help but twitch his mouth, saying, “Elder Gao, what did you just do?”

Now, he understood why Gao Xue Ting had set up a barrier. If someone had seen this, then she wouldn’t be able to justify herself and clear subsequent misunderstandings.

Gao Xue Ting sternly said, “Your cultivation has advanced too quickly. You just reached the First-Order Dao Source Realm a short time ago, yet you’ve already advanced to the Second-Order. I was just checking if there were any hidden dangers or issues left behind. What did you think I was doing?”

As she spoke up to here, Gao Xue Ting’s gaze turned ice-cold and Yang Kai couldn’t help but shiver.

“Even if you wanted to check my body, you didn’t have to do this...” Yang Kai said with a sullen look.

“If this was the sole reason, then I didn’t have to do this, but I heard that you were also chased by a Demonic Artifact Spirit that had appeared some days ago, so I had to make sure you weren’t corrupted by Demon Qi as well.”

“I’m not a child anymore you know.”

“I’m old enough to be your great-grandmother, so what’s the harm in seeing your body?” As Gao Xue Ting spoke up to this point, she curled her lips slightly and said mockingly, “Little brat, you’ve got some good muscles, en you’re pretty well built.”

“Elder Gao, thank you for the undeserved praise...” Yang Kai wiped the sweat off his forehead and said awkwardly, “What are the results?”

“Pretty good,” Gao Xue Ting said then took Yang Kai’s clothes and threw them to him as she said, “You broke through quickly, but your foundation is still as stable as ever, and it also looks like you haven’t been corrupted by Demon Qi.”

Yang Kai said weakly, “If I had been corrupted by Demon Qi... What would have happened?”

“You’d be a dead man by now,” Gao Xue Ting looked at him coldly, “What? Is there something else you’d like to tell me?”

“Nope, nothing... I have nothing to tell you,” Yang Kai quickly waved his hand, while he decided inwardly to hide the Demonic War Hammer and the Demon Spirit sealed in his body from her at all costs.

“Little brat, you’re acting strangely. Are you hiding something from me?” Gao Xue Ting said coldly.

Yang Kai smiled bitterly and said, “Not at all. Elder Gao, you’ve just misunderstood me.”

Gao Xue Ting gazed at Yang Kai for a long time then said, “That would be for the best. If I learn that you’re hiding anything from me, then I’ll give you a memorable lesson.”

Yang Kai didn’t dare to retort back as he quickly put his clothes on under the quilt.
