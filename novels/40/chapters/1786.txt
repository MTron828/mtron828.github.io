‚ÄúIn that case, I‚Äôll look forward to you calling me Grandpa!‚Äù Yang Kai laughed loudly before his figure flickered and appeared behind the Void Crack nearest to the Heavenly Infant Grass.

This Void Crack was less than twenty metres away from the Heavenly Infant Grasses. Explore new ùíèovels on nùíêvelbiùíè(.)com

After Yang Kai stood firm, the eyes of Xu Wei, Zi Long, and Zi Dong fixed on him, waiting for the show to begin.

None of them believed Yang Kai could succeed.

Standing still and thinking for a while, Yang Kai eventually waved his hand and sent out a Golden Blood Thread.

He had never tested the power of the Seven Coloured Radiant Light and had only heard from Ni Guang that it was extremely dangerous, so he did not know whether his Golden Blood Threads would be useful here.

A golden light flashed, and under Yang Kai‚Äôs careful control, the Golden Blood Thread penetrated the Seven Coloured Radiant Light slightly.

But in the next moment, Yang Kai‚Äôs expression changed dramatically.

Because the moment the tip of his Golden Blood Thread touched the Seven Coloured Radiant Light, it began to sizzle and melt away.

Things did not end there though as the corrosive force continued to eat away at the Golden Blood Thread and rapidly moved up it towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was shocked and quickly disconnected the Golden Blood Thread from his hand, discarding it on the ground just in time to see it completely melt away.

Yang Kai could not help showing a look of shock.

The Seven Coloured Radiant Light really deserved its terrifying reputation.

Yang Kai‚Äôs Golden Blood Threads were condensed from his own pure Golden Blood, and since condensing them, aside from the ones he had intentionally detonated, none had ever been destroyed, but now, under the corrosion of the Seven Coloured Radiant Light, one of them had almost instantly disintegrated.

The Seven Coloured Radiant Light ignored any form of defence and not only had the ability to corrode physical forms but could also annihilate one‚Äôs Soul. These characteristics perfectly restrained Yang Kai‚Äôs Golden Blood Threads.

According to Yang Kai‚Äôs observations, as long as it was a flesh and blood living creature, once it was contaminated by the Seven Coloured Radiant Light, the consequences would be disastrous.

On the other side, Xu Wei and Zi Long, who were carefully monitoring Yang Kai‚Äôs movements, were also secretly shocked.

This was also their first time witnessing the power of the Seven Coloured Radiant Light. Having seen it firsthand, the two Origin Kings both concluded that if they were accidentally contaminated by this strange light, they wouldn‚Äôt be able to resist its corrosion.

But soon, Xu Wei sneered loudly and called out, ‚ÄúBoy, is that all you‚Äôve got? Come on, try again.‚Äù

Yang Kai glanced over at him and sneered.

The reason why he had used a Golden Blood Thread just now was mainly because he wanted to test whether the power of the Seven Coloured Radiant Light was really as rumoured, and now that he had his answer, he wouldn‚Äôt experiment any further.

Yang Kai had figured out how to harvest the Heavenly Infant Grass a while ago. In any case, the Heavenly Infant Grass was very valuable, and Yang Kai never planned on letting it off, much less let it fall into Xu Wei or Zi Long‚Äôs hands.

Ignoring Xu Wei‚Äôs ridicule, Yang Kai sat down cross-legged directly.

Immediately, he reached out and waved his hand, summoning a small, somewhat stupid-looking stone.

Stone Puppet number two!

The second Stone Puppet was Yang Kai‚Äôs Embodiment. When this Stone Puppet was born in High Heaven Sect, its sentience had failed to form properly, and although it had survived, it did not possess its own consciousness. Unable to act on its own, it was essentially brain dead, so Yang Kai had used it as a body for his Soul Clone to create an Embodiment.

And because Yang Kai had injected a lot of his Golden Blood into it when it was born, it had turned golden, a bit different from Xiao Xiao.

For a long time, this Embodiment had not played any role. When fighting against his enemies, Yang Kai had Firebird Liu Yan and Stone Puppet Xiao Xiao to rely on, so he had always kept the existence of his Embodiment a secret.

But now was the perfect opportunity to put it to use.

Yang Kai did not dare to release Xiao Xiao; after all, Xiao Xiao was one of his biggest helpers, and if something were to happen to him in the Seven Coloured Radiant Light, the loss would be immense.

The Stone Puppet‚Äôs physique was not composed of flesh and blood, so it should not be affected by the Seven Coloured Radiant Light. It also lacked its own sentience, so it should not fear the Seven Coloured Radiant Light‚Äôs ability to corrode Spiritual Energy. The only thing to worry about was whether it could protect Yang Kai‚Äôs Soul Clone.

In order for the Stone Puppet Embodiment to act, Yang Kai had to infuse his Soul Clone into it, which he normally kept inside his Knowledge Sea. This way, Yang Kai could directly manipulate it.

Yang Kai did not know whether the Seven Coloured Radiant Light would destroy his Soul Clone inside the Embodiment‚Äôs form.

However, the only way to find out was to try, so Yang Kai steeled himself, reached out his hand, and tapped the head of his Embodiment.

The Soul Clone which had been resting inside his Knowledge Sea immediately poured into the Embodiment and the sluggish eyes of the Golden Stone Puppet quickly became bright and agile.

As for Yang Kai, he felt as if his consciousness had been split in two at this moment. Not only could he see and perceive everything from his own perspective, but also from the perspective of his Embodiment, a truly strange and wonderful feeling.

Controlling the Embodiment, Yang Kai‚Äôs Soul Clone moved its hands and feet slightly, adapting to this new body.

‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù On the other side, Zi Dong stared with a stunned expression towards the Golden Stone Puppet.

He had never seen such a peculiar existence. This stone man looked more like a living creature rather than a puppet, but it also did not appear to be alive, a peculiar sight indeed.

Although the aura from this stone body was not very strong, it was still something he had never seen before, so he turned to his father for answers.

He thought that, with his father‚Äôs experience and knowledge, Zi Long would definitely know something, but what he didn‚Äôt expect was that after a long silence, his father muttered, ‚ÄúYour father also doesn‚Äôt know what that is.‚Äù

Zi Dong was shocked.

[There are still existences in the Star Field that Father is unaware of?] Zi Dong looked towards Xu Wei, hoping he would know something, but he soon discovered that this Abandoned Lair Elder was staring at this strange stone creature with a frown on his face and uncertainty in his eyes.

He too did not know anything!

Where did this brat named Yang Kai find this thing, and why did two Origin Kings have no idea what it was? Zi Dong could not help feeling stunned.

However, in the next moment, Zi Dong‚Äôs heart clenched, and he subconsciously whispered, ‚ÄúThis thing, it couldn‚Äôt...‚Äù

Although he could not recognize what the Stone Puppet was, Zi Dong could tell that it did not have a flesh and blood body, so it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem for it to enter the Seven Coloured Radiant Light; and if that was the case, could Yang Kai really obtain the remaining Heavenly Infant Grass?

Realizing this, Zi Dong‚Äôs face sank as he recalled he would waste his meridians if Yang Kai achieved this, his mood instantly becoming gloomy.

Xu Wei also felt rotten.

Zi Dong had said he would waste his meridians while he had said he would call Yang Kai Grandpa; if Yang Kai really managed to obtain the Heavenly Infant Grass...

[Damn it, why has the Seven Coloured Radiant Light not withdrawn yet!] Xu Wei cursed constantly in his heart, wishing he had some Secret Technique that could disperse the Seven Coloured Radiant Light and allow him to attack Yang Kai.

Under the piercing gazes of these three, Yang Kai controlled his Embodiment to step forward and enter the Seven Coloured Radiant Light.

As soon as the Embodiment stepped into the flowing light, Yang Kai felt his entire body sink, as if a hundred thousand kilogram boulder was pressing down on him, on par with the Domain of an Origin King. The Seven Coloured Radiant Light made the surrounding space extremely thick and difficult to move through.

Fortunately, after a quick observation, Yang Kai found that his Soul Clone inside the Embodiment was not taking any damage. It seemed the Seven Coloured Radiant Light was completely isolated by his Embodiment‚Äôs body.

This discovery made Yang Kai incredibly happy, as it confirmed his previous guess. The Seven Coloured Radiant Light ignored all forms of defence, not by aiming at a physical body but at the existence of flesh and blood, so the Stone Puppet‚Äôs physique was not restrained by it.

Now, if Yang Kai found any precious treasures here later and he was unable to collect them himself, he could simply dispatch his Embodiment.

Taking note of this option, Yang Kai continued to control his Embodiment to move forward.

His Soul Clone had inherited his will and understanding of cultivation, so although Embodiment itself was not that powerful, it could still use Space Force.

The Embodiment began emitting a field of Space Force around itself in the next instant, greatly reducing the pressure it felt and increasing its speed significantly.

The distance of twenty metres was crossed by the Embodiment at an extremely quick rate.

Xu Wei‚Äôs face was as black as the bottom of a pot.

He was now certain the few stalks of Heavenly Infant Grass would be unable to escape Yang Kai‚Äôs clutches, but this was not the biggest problem; that lay with the words he had spoken just now.

Naturally, it was impossible for him to really call Yang Kai, a mere Junior, Grandpa. If Xu Wei were to do this, he would not be able to show his face in the future, and he would need to scram back to Abandoned Lair to hide for the rest of his life.

But if he did not honour his word, he would surely be ridiculed by Yang Kai again. Xu Wei was quite familiar now with how poisonous this brat‚Äôs tongue was.

He felt a headache coming on as his expression turned ugly.

After just ten breaths of time, the Embodiment arrived in front of the Heavenly Infant Grass, and although the hands of the Stone Puppet were quite large and thick, under Yang Kai‚Äôs delicate control, it was still able to skillfully harvest the Heavenly Infant Grass. Finished with its task, the Embodiment got up, turned around, and walked back over to where Yang Kai sat.

Once his Embodiment returned, Yang Kai collected the Heavenly Infant Grass, stored them into a box he had prepared ahead of time and put them into his Space Ring before taking back his Soul Clone and Embodiment with a smile.

Immediately, he turned his head and glanced towards Xu Wei.

Xu Wei‚Äôs eyes avoided his...

‚ÄúWhat? Refusing to admit your loss?‚Äù Yang Kai sneered, ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you say you‚Äôd call me Grandpa?‚Äù

Xu Wei suddenly became angry out of shame and with a stern face glared towards Yang Kai, as if warning him to keep his mouth shut or he would immediately attack.

He had decided to act shamelessly as there was nothing Yang Kai could do to him regardless.

Yang Kai sneered and turned to Zi Dong next, ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you say you‚Äôd waste your meridians?‚Äù

Zi Dong roared angrily, ‚ÄúWhat thing are you? You dare ask this Young Master to waste his meridians?‚Äù

Yang Kai stroked his chin and grinned as he nodded, ‚ÄúSo your words are as meaningless as farts.‚Äù

Zi Long coldly snorted, ‚ÄúBoy, this old master will give you some advice. Act according to your station or you will suffer in the future. Why do you insist on going so far?‚Äù

‚ÄúAct according to my station?‚Äù Yang Kai sneered, ‚ÄúDo I need to show any respect to trash like you?‚Äù

‚ÄúBoy, pay attention to your words. Don‚Äôt forget, this Seven Coloured Radiant Light will soon retreat, and once it does, you should know what your end will be,‚Äù Zi Long glared Yang Kai coldly.
