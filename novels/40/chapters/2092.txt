“I can sell the Spirit Array, but may I know what price you are going to offer for it?” Qin Zhao Yang asked as he clenched his teeth in anger.

Seemingly prepared for him to ask, the middle-aged man with the surname of Fu raised his finger. “One million!”

“You might as well just steal it?” Qin Zhao Yang roared in fury.

Everyone else also revealed inconceivable looks as they stared at the middle-aged man.

Although a million Source Crystals wasn’t a small amount, it was too low of a price for the Seven Points Black Tortoise Array. During the auction fair, a single Dao Source Fruit could fetch over a million Source Crystals, much less an extraordinary Spirit Array like this.

If such a Spirit Array was brought out to be auctioned, there would absolutely be many great sects fighting to get their hands on it, much less being able to fetch a few million Source Crystals. Therefore, Qin Zhao Yang was utterly incapable of accepting this price.

“A million, no more, no less!” Ignoring Qin Zhao Yang’s fury, the middle-aged man snorted coldly. “If you continue nagging, this offer will be gone.”

“Tsk tsk, this sir from the Flying Saint Palace is overbearing indeed. You’ve really opened this mistress’s eyes.” An alluring giggle suddenly rang out from Hua Qing Si.

“Flying Saint Palace?” Zhuang Pan exclaimed in astonishment, while Du Li Shen’s expression immediately changed.

Even Duan Yuan Shan had a shocked look plastered on his face. On one hand, it was due to him suddenly discovering the origin of this middle-aged man with the surname of Fu. On the other hand, it was naturally due to Hua Qing Si’s knowledge of such information. Although everyone had already guessed that the middle-aged man had an extraordinary background, no one knew exactly what it was. This was only revealed through Hua Qing Si’s information, and no one could tell how she managed to obtain that information!

After hearing those words, great waves of vigilance surged within Yang Kai’s heart as he sneakily shot a look at the middle-aged man, quietly feeling that this fellow’s intentions weren’t good at all.

Despite being forced to kill the Flying Saint Palace’s Young Master, who had been possessed by the Wood Spirit, it was still undeniable that he had killed the latter.

After that, he had seized Ning Yuan Cheng’s ship and refined it for his own use.

With this in mind, it was definitely not a coincidence that the middle-aged man had appeared in Maplewood City. He might very well be in pursuit of the culprit behind Ning Yuan Cheng’s death. Therefore, there was no way he didn’t notice that ship at the Spirit Pill Plaza a few days ago.

In fact, he might have already known that Yang Kai was the killer!

Yang Kai’s face turned slightly gloomy as he considered all of this.

After his origin was revealed by Hua Qing Si, the middle-aged man narrowed his eyes slightly, before focusing on the beautiful woman. “Your eyesight’s impressive, woman. Where do you hail from?”

Raising her hand to arrange her loose strands of hair back behind her ear, Hua Qing Si gave a faint smile and replied, “This mistress is just a lowly loose cultivator. What’s there to talk about where I hail from?”

“Hmph!”

Naturally, the middle-aged man did not believe Hua Qing Si’s nonsensical reply. As shock and doubt surfaced quietly in his heart, a faint sliver of dread finally flashed across his eyes.

A person who could see where he came from was obviously not an ordinary person. However, with his haughtiness and arrogance, he still did not treat Hua Qing Si as much at all.

“Have you made up your mind?” The middle-aged man turned back to Qin Zhao Yang.

Qin Zhao Yang sighed and replied, “Can the offer be raised?”

After all that had just happened, Qin Zhao Yong was already on the chopping board. Furthermore, he still had Qin Yu to consider. In the end, he had to weigh his options; since he had no other choice, he made an attempt to see if he could obtain more Source Crystals.

“What do you think?” The middle-aged man did not answer Qin Zhao Yang’s question.

Qin Zhao Yang’s expression sunk, causing him to appear as though he had aged for quite a bit, “Let’s agree to the price Sir has given.”

“Very good!” Extremely satisfied with the outcome, the middle-aged man extended his hand towards Qin Zhao Yang. “Hand the thing to this king, and this king will not renege from this king’s words.”

“Hold up!”

All of a sudden, a voice interrupted this trade.

Everyone turned towards the source of that voice, only to discover that it was impressively Yang Kai, who stood at the middle of the formation. Ever since Hua Qing Si and the middle-aged man started their conversation, until the man successfully forced Qin Zhao Yang to sell the Seven Points Black Tortoise Array, Yang Kai did not speak a single word at all, causing everyone to forget his existence. However, they never expected him to suddenly speak up at such a critical moment, causing blank looks to appear on everyone’s faces, being at a loss for what he wished to do.

A flash of splendour surfaced within Hua Qing Si’s beautiful eyes, as she started to size Yang Kai up with interest, a faint smile curling up at the corner of her mouth.

Compared to her, the middle-aged man narrowed his eyes, while a sliver of murderous intent obvious to anyone who saw it flashed across his eyes, as he said in a cold voice, “What do you want, brat?”

“Don’t be impatient, sir,” Yang Kai chuckled. “I’m not going to snatch your business away. However, after your stunt, I suddenly realized that the unity between us people is somewhat weak. If anyone just wants to casually leave, he or she can use such a threat to coerce the other people. This doesn’t seem too good, right?”

Duan Yuan Shan quickly added, “It’s this Duan’s failure to make adequate considerations.”

Originally, he had treated the sudden requests from the two Third-Order Dao Source Realm Masters taking the initiative to join this mission as a good thing. How would he ever expect that such a situation would occur? Compared to the middle-aged man, Hua Qing Si looked more reliable for the time being. However, if Hua Qing Si was just like the middle-aged man , it would be better for everyone to just rush back to the city than to get their consciousness wiped out and turned into demons.

“This isn’t City Lord Duan’s fault. It’s just that there aren’t many Dao Source Realms in Maplewood City in the first place. Having external aid is something that I’d naturally desire.” Yang Kai replied in a calm tone.

Hearing Yang Kai’s words, Duan Yuan Shan gave a long sigh, one that was filled with helplessness.

“For the sake of preventing such matters from occurring again, I feel that we should have a proper discussion about it. For example, we can’t have someone else pulling something like this again, right?” Yang Kai asked while looking at his surroundings.

“That’s right, that’s right. We indeed need to discuss it.” Du Li Shen promptly nodded his head in support.

The other people were still indifferent about the matter, as everyone knew one another and had family businesses in Maplewood City, which meant that they wouldn’t act too despicably and not give regard to the general situation at all. However, the rest were also not familiar with Hua Qing Si. What if she pulled the same stunt as the middle-aged man? If that really happened, this team would definitely break apart. With even returning back to the city becoming a problem for them, how would they have any room to think about repairing the seal?

Furthermore, with how despicable the middle-aged man was, what if he still pulled out after obtaining the Seven Points Black Tortoise Array? What could everyone else do then?

As such apprehensions started to surge within their minds, frowns appeared on a few people’s faces, as worry filled their hearts.

“What’s the matter? You won’t believe this king?” Seeing their reactions, the middle-aged man couldn’t help but reveal a gloomy expression on his face!

Huang Qin Shi pursed her lips and laughed, “Do you think you’re a trustworthy person, sir?”

The middle-aged male snorted coldly. “So, what are you trying to say, madam?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He did not believe that Hua Qing Si, a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, would act just on her hotbloodedness to help these people repair the seal. She definitely had underlying reasons behind her actions.

“Aiya. This mistress isn’t harbouring any ill intentions at all. It’s just that one can’t act alone at this moment, that’s all.” Hua Qin Si giggled after giving her reply.

After being singled out by Hua Qing Si, a look of fury appeared on the middle-aged man’s face. Nevertheless, he did not dare to take action, leaving him no choice but to forcefully restrain himself.

“Everyone, there’s no need to argue. This Duan feels that there’s a reason behind little brother Yang’s words. How about this, why not make sure that they would not pull any requests like earlier and not leave their positions before we repair the seal and return to the city?” Duan Yuan Shan quickly interjected.

“You lot can rest assured. As long as this king obtains the complete array formation method, this king will naturally aid you all to repair the seal.” The middle-aged man said in a cold voice.

“Words have no value...” Zhuang Pan said weakly.

“Then what do you want? Are you trying to make this king swear upon my heart demon?” The middle-aged man’s gaze suddenly turned cold as he looked right at Zhuang Pan.

Zhuang Pan turned pale in fright and promptly gave a weak laugh, “It’s just a joke, sir.”

“Why not?” On the contrary, Yang Kai gave a faint smile, “If sir really wishes to work together with us as a team, it shouldn’t be a big problem for you sir to swear upon your heart demon. Unless... you have a guilty conscience, sir.”

“Impudence!” The middle-aged man roared in fury as he sent a scorchingly angry glare at Yang Kai, the flames of anger within his eyes seemingly wanting to set Yang Kai aflame.

However, Yang Kai remained unmoved and continued to stare right back at him.

Since he had guessed that the man had already treated him as Ning Yuan Chen’s killer, the man would definitely have a grudge against him. Therefore, Yang Kai wasn’t afraid of having some enmity with the man.

“What this little brother said is not wrong,” Surprisingly, Hua Qing Si was extremely supportive of Yang Kai. “It’s rare for this mistress to follow along in my moment of hotbloodedness and travel with people, so I really don’t want my mood to get spoiled by some people. Since everyone agrees on this, let’s all swear upon our heart demons.”

“Who would agree to it?” The middle-aged man asked out in shock.

“Everyone has agreed to it. It seems like you, sir, are the only one with a different opinion.” Yang Kai grinned as he looked at him, before suddenly revealing a look of shock. “Could it be that you, sir, are really planning to leave after obtaining the formation method? Sir, you can’t be that untrustworthy and harbour evil intentions at heart!”

“Lies! This King never said those words,” The middle-aged man had reached the limits of his anger.

“Then that means that you’ve agreed.” Yang Kai concluded. No longer caring about the latter, he looked around and said, “Since no one has any objections, let’s start.”

After saying those words, he started to swear upon his heart demon.

Exchanging glances with one another, the other people proceeded to do the same.

In fact, even Hua Qing Si did not act out of place and started to swear upon her heart demon.

After that... everyone turned to look at the middle-aged man.

At this moment an angry glow burst forth from the middle-aged man’s eyes. Staring fiercely at Yang Kai, he seemed to want to cleave Yang Kai to death as he growled between his clenched teeth. “Good, very good! This king will remember you.”

Yang Kai giggled in response. “I really apologize for making you, sir, remember me.”

“You’re courting death!” The middle-aged man replied with his hatred evident in his voice.

“Sir, is there any use in threatening me?” Yang Kai made an innocent face, “I didn’t do anything at all.”

“This sir, it’s your turn now.” Hua Qing Si interjected, grinning as she looked at the middle-aged man. “Unless you don’t wish to obtain the complete formation method, you have to swear upon your heart demon. If not, this mistress will have to properly thank you, sir, as this mistress is prepared to offer a better price for the trade.”

“Very good, all of you!” Suppressing the flames of anger in his heart, the middle-aged man had no choice but to clench his teeth and start his oath.

Although swearing upon one’s heart demon appeared to be a useless verbal promise, it was actually not completely useless, as no cultivator dared to recklessly disregard it. If one was to really face an oath backlash during a critical moment, it would be an exceedingly troublesome matter to deal with.

However, there are also quite a few secret techniques that could allow one to evade the backlash of a heart demon’s oath, so it could not be fully trusted most of the time.

These secret techniques required one to have an extremely powerful cultivation realm in order to execute them. Furthermore, they required extremely long preparation times. Therefore, despite the strength of the middle-aged man, he should not be able to dispel the heart demon’s oath for a while.
