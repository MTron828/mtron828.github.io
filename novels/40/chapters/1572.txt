Chapter 1572, A Matter Of Great Importance

The two Monster Race masters had decided to wait until the pill was finished being refined before taking action. How could a pill coveted by a master like Ba He not be valuable? No matter what, they had to snatch it. Perhaps after consuming this pill they would be able to break through the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm in one fell swoop and reach the Origin King Realm.

After all, Ba He had reached the peak of the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm more than two hundred years ago and was well known as the most likely on Monster Emperor Star to break through and reach the status of Tribal Lord.

As Ma Ge Na and Mi Tian were communicating secretly, Ba He glanced over at them seemingly unintentionally and flashed a faint smile.

“Young man, don’t you want to go to the palace to visit your old friend?” Ba He suddenly sent a Divine Sense message to Yang Kai.

“En, Old Sir... rather, what advice does Senior Ba He have?” Yang Kai looked at him suspiciously, wondering why the other party had suddenly mentioned this.

“I don’t have anything as exaggerated as advice, but... this old master does have a way to ensure that you enter the palace safely!”

“Really?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up.

“Indeed! But this method has some risks to it. If you believe this old master, this old master will act immediately, if not, just pretend I hadn’t said anything.”

“Haha, Junior and Senior only just met, believing or not believing in one another need not be mentioned,” Yang Kai was no longer a hot-blooded young man who would easily believe an unfamiliar person.

“Having such concerns is natural, but honestly... This method also has certain risks for this old master. If you can cooperate with this old master, this old master can promise that as long as he still lives, no harm will come to you.”

Yang Kai frowned slightly, but after pondering for a moment, he said, “Can Senior explain his plan first?”

“Certainly,” Ba He agreed easily, not trying to bargain back and forth, and bluntly explained his plan to Yang Kai.

After Yang Kai finished listening, his brow furrowed even deeper, “There are indeed some risks, but... Senior has apparently thought this matter through quite thoroughly. However, if we act according to Senior’s plan, will we, Senior Sister and Junior Brother, be able to maintain our freedom?”

“Then you’re refusing?” Ba He asked disappointedly.

“No, I accept. Senior can act freely,” Yang Kai grinned.

Ba He glanced at him in amazement, seemingly not having expected that Yang Kai would act so rashly. Although Ba He wasn’t worried about failure and was certain he could gain Yang Kai access to Red Moon Tribal Lord’s palace with his plan, to Yang Kai and the woman performing Alchemy in the inn, it was not necessarily a good deed.

Ba He had been prepared to be rejected.

But unexpectedly, Yang Kai had easily agreed.

Ba He stared at Yang Kai with a weird expression, secretly feeling that this human boy was simply too fearless, but since he had already agreed, that really wasn’t his concern anymore.

Thinking so, Ba He smiled lightly and opened his mouth to say out loud, “This pill is clearly still being refined, yet the phenomenon it inspired is already so magnificent, so there is no doubt it will be a supreme pill. Also, judging from the richness of this fragrance, this pill must at least be Origin Grade.”

“What Sir Ba He said makes sense,” Ma Ge Na agreed casually, not understanding what Ba He was plotting.

“I believe only Lady Tribal Lord is qualified to possess such a pill. What does City Lord Ma Ge Na think?” Ba He smiled as he glanced over.

“Indeed!” Ma Ge Na frowned more deeply, faintly feeling something was wrong. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“The Alchemist who refined this pill must also be a Grandmaster level figure.”

“En,” Ma Ge Na nodded, a bad premonition welling up in his heart as he suddenly understood what Ba He was implying.

“Lady Tribal Lord has always regarded such talents extremely highly and the palace has spared no efforts to recruit them over the years. It seems you’ve received a stroke of good fortune now that such a talent has appeared in Shimmering Moon City, Ma Ge Na. With your savvy, surely you must know what to do next,” Ba He looked at Ma Ge Na with a smile.

The latter wore a solemn expression as he said loudly, “Many thanks for your advice, Sir, this Ma Ge Na understands. After this Grandmaster finishes refining this pill, I will escort him to the Lady Tribal Lord’s palace personally!”

“En, as long as you please Lady Tribal Lord, the reward you receive will not be small,” Ba He chuckled.

Upon hearing this, Ma Ge Na’s eyes lit up and he smiled more naturally, quickly cupping his fists and saying, “Fortunately, Sir has such far-sighted vision!”

After saying so, he shouted loudly, “Come!”

A group of Monster Race masters immediately rushed over.

“Disperse all the miscellaneous people here and kill anyone who dares to approach within a hundred-metre radius of this inn. No one is to disturb the Alchemy Grandmaster inside!”

“Yes!”

To the side, Mi Tian froze up in a dumbfounded state.

The agreement he had just secretly reached with Ma Ge Na had been destroyed by a few words from Ba He. Not only that, but Ma Ge Na had also thoroughly changed to Ba He’s side and even took the initiative to provide guards to protect the Alchemist inside the inn.

Ba He had no intention to covet the pill being refined, and on the contrary, seemed intent on delivering this Alchemy Grandmaster to the palace!

The Monster Race was not proficient in Alchemy, this was a well-known fact; however, while humans might be suppressed on Monster Emperor Star, masters who were skilled in Alchemy would frequently appear. Red Moon Tribal Lord protected humans within her territory and allowed them some space to develop because she wanted to obtain these humans with special talents.

Alchemists, Artifact Refiners, etc...

Every ten years, Alchemy and Artifact Refining competitions were held in Red Moon Territory, and those humans who stood out were able to shed their lowly status, move into the palace, and serve the Tribal Lord.

Chi Yue’s palace had constantly been recruiting such talents over the years, and an Alchemy Grandmaster capable of refining a pill which caused such a startling phenomenon would, needless to say, be extremely favoured by Red Moon Tribal Lord.

In other words, it was as if the Grandmaster in the inn had obtained Red Moon Tribal Lord’s protection. Even if Mi Tian was bold, in Red Moon Territory, he did not dare oppose Red Moon Tribal Lord as that would be equal to opposing all the masters in Red Moon Territory.

Instantly, he had been reduced to a spectator...

Mi Tian felt as if he had just been made to swallow a fly.

Watching the numerous Monster Race masters of Shimmering Moon City surrounding the inn, Yang Kai chuckled.

He wasn’t afraid of going to the palace. Even if the Red Moon Tribal Lord was an Origin King Realm master, as long as he found a chance, with his abilities in the Dao of Space, he could leave whenever he pleased, not to mention he was also an Alchemy Grandmaster!

His current Alchemy skills were even higher than Xia Ning Chang’s, and he could refine Origin King Grade Spirit Pills! If his skill was to be exposed, Red Moon Tribal Lord would likely treat him as a guest of honour!

After all, Origin King Grade Alchemists were incredibly rare even when the entire Star Field was taken into account. As for Monster Emperor Star, such an Alchemy Grandmaster had never before appeared.

“Young man, this old master can only help you until here, as for what happens once you’re inside the palace, that will be up to your own means. However, this old master will warn you in advance, if you want to survive, it would be best to not act too impudently once there,” Ba He glanced at Yang Kai and whispered.

Yang Kai didn’t comment but instead asked with interest, “Senior Ba He not hesitating to reveal his identity at this time was not just to help our Senior Sister and Junior Brother pair, so what is your real purpose? If it is convenient, could you tell me?”

“Naturally it was not just to help you. En, I just wanted to take this opportunity to return to the palace and ask Lady Tribal Lord for forgiveness,” A desolate look flashed across Ba He’s face.

Yang Kai raised his brow as he suddenly remembered the stories the Monster Race onlookers had been talking about, saying that Ba He was supposed to have been killed by the Lady Tribal Lord herself two hundred years ago.

Now, however, it seemed he was alive and well.

Obviously, something had happened between Ba He and Red Moon Tribal Lord. At least, the rumours were wrong and Ba He had not been killed by Red Moon Tribal Lord. Perhaps Chi Yue had let him go at that time.

However, Yang Kai wasn’t interested in digging up other people’s histories and simply nodded, “If that’s the case, then this is just us temporarily cooperating, each obtaining what we need.

“Ah... Besides returning to the palace, this old master wants to ask for your help with one more thing,” Ba He suddenly said with some embarrassment.

“What?”

“I want to request aid from your Senior Sister to create a pill!” Ba He said bluntly, quickly adding, “You may rest assured, I have collected all the necessary materials and only need them to be refined into the appropriate pill, after which I will offer a generous remuneration!”

“Let’s talk about this when the time comes. Depending on how Senior Sister’s mood is, perhaps she will be willing to help you,” Yang Kai grinned.

[This bastard boy... he’s trying to break bridges after crossing the river,] Ba He couldn’t help rolling his eyes.

The phenomenon grew ever stronger as time passed and it was not long before a giant vortex seemed to cover the entire sky, gathering a terrifying amount of World Energy towards itself in the process.

Such a vision was no less intense than the World Energy baptism a cultivator would undergo when breaking through to the Origin Realm; possibly even more intense than that.

No matter who it was, none of them could believe that a trivial pill refinement could cause such a startling sight.

Everyone only became more curious, wondering what kind of pill the Grandmaster inside was refining.

However, the rich medicinal fragrance allowed them to understand that this unrefined pill was at least Origin Grade!

Origin Grade Alchemists on Monster Emperor Star numbered only about a dozen or so, with the most skilled having reached the Origin Grade High-Rank. Even on Monster Emperor Star, despite this Grandmaster being only human, no Monster Race cultivator dared not show him respect.

Humans truly had low status on this Cultivation Star, but the truly talented were able to obtain extremely high prestige; the polarization was quite shocking.

All this was due to the wise leadership of Red Moon Tribal Lord though. If she had not dedicatedly recruited talents from the Human Race, Red Moon Territory would not be as powerful as it was today. Among the ten territories on Monster Emperor Star, Red Moon Territory was definitely ranked amongst the top three.

One had to understand, a thousand years ago, Red Moon Territory was the weakest territory on Monster Emperor Star.

Red Moon Tribal Lord had been able to overturn this status in only a thousand years, and it was believed that, in time, Red Moon Territory would become the most powerful territory on all of Monster Emperor Star.

Unlike the Monster Race cultivators who were just watching the show, Yang Kai was also an Alchemist, and from the medicinal fragrance in the air as well as the phenomenon up in the sky was able to judge Little Senior Sister’s progress in her pill refinement. He was currently paying close attention to the changes in the vortex as well as the intensity of the medicinal fragrance as he secretly felt anxious for Xia Ning Chang.
