The old man could actually see that Zhang Ruo Xi’s Bloodline Power was extraordinary and her Blood Essence could be used to seal a Divine Spirit’s Soul. He also knew a powerful Monster Beast like Qiong Qi and spoke out about the true name of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. As such, Yang Kai could not believe that he was just an ordinary Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator.

“Well, I can’t tell you that!”

Yang Kai was infuriated and grumbled, “Then, what can you tell me?”

The old man thought for a while before patting Yang Kai’s shoulder and advising earnestly, “Cultivate well and quickly promote to the Emperor Realm as soon as possible. The future of Star Boundary depends on all of you.”

“Get lost!”

The old man did not feel annoyed at all at this rebuff and just glanced at Yang Kai with a gentle smile before turning around and announcing loudly with a solemn look, “Everyone, if you can hear this Old Master, please leave this place immediately. It is very dangerous here and if you continue to remain, your lives will be in danger.”

Liang Qiu responded with a laugh, “Old man, you are really interesting. I already know that it is dangerous here. I don’t need you to remind me.”

Even though he knew this old man was only a Third-Order Dao Source Realm, after his spear attack was easily dispelled by him, he dared not to look down on the old man as his strength was unfathomable. If it was another Dao Source Realm cultivator who said these words, Liang Qiu would have already stabbed him with his spear.

“You seem to be very knowledgeable. Why don’t you tell us which Great Emperor left this skeleton behind?” Liang Qiu brought up the topic of the skeleton in the black hole again.

Previously, due to the release of Mo Xiao Qi’s Divine Soul Seal, everyone’s attention was drawn to it out of fear, while the Great Emperor’s skeleton and the Space Ring were temporarily forgotten.

But now that the crisis of Divine Soul Seal had been resolved, it was natural that everyone would turn their attention back to this Space Ring.

Liang Qiu’s question was undoubtedly on point, and everyone looked at the old man curiously, waiting for him to give an explanation.

The old man looked stern when he answered, “It doesn’t matter anymore which Great Emperor left this behind. The past War of Great Emperors was a disaster that shattered worlds. Besides a few useless leftovers, most of the artifacts used back then were destroyed, so it is impossible for there to be anything worthwhile left in that Space Ring. Everyone would be better off not thinking about it anymore.”

“Do you think I will believe you?” Liang Qiu snorted coldly.

“I believe!” Lan Xun abruptly stood up and declared.

Liang Qiu glanced at her, pursing his lips. Since Lan Xun, the daughter of the Bright Moon Great Emperor, also stood up for this old man, he could not go up against him anymore.

Lan Xun continued, “Senior, if it’s convenient, can you please tell us why this place is dangerous?”

The old man frowned, “Your lives are in danger. Lady Lan, please quickly take your people and leave.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lan Xun pondered a while after hearing him, then nodded in agreement, “Since Senior said so, then Junior will leave now. Take care, Senior.”

While speaking, she looked at Yang Kai, and seeing his indifferent face, she did not try to persuade him. Instead, she turned to the surrounding cultivators and shouted, “Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters from the Southern Territory, if you trust me, Lan Xun, please leave here now!”

After calling out, she immediately rushed away. Although Xiao Chen was a little unwilling, as a qualified worshipper, he definitely would not leave Lan Xun alone and quickly followed after her.

As soon as she left, many of the elites from the Southern Territory among the crowd summoned their artifacts and left one after another.

It could be seen that Star Soul Palace still had a huge amount of influence over the Southern Territory, as no one else could achieve such an effect.

Those thousands from the Southern Territory were reduced to a few hundred.

Xia Sheng exchanged whispers with Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao for a while, seeming to think that the old man’s warning was not a joke, and secretly sent Yang Kai a message before also turning and leaving.

If he was alone, Xia Sheng might have chosen to remain, since he was also an Emperor Realm Master; however, Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao were with him at the moment, so he had to consider their safety and dared not risk their lives.

“Yao Si, you leave too!” This old man turned to Yao Si and ordered.

Yao Si raised his brows and replied indifferently, “This Young Master loves to be wherever he wants, no one can command me!”

As the son of a Great Emperor, he was naturally extremely arrogant. Although the performance of the old man was amazing, it was still not enough for him to try to boss Yao Si around.

The old man sighed and suddenly waved his hand, sending out a stream of light towards Yao Si as fast as lightning.

Yao Si’s face changed and he hurriedly pushed his Emperor Qi while retreating rapidly at the same time, trying to dodge the blow.

But what appalled him was that the stream of light was travelling at an unreasonable speed, which was impossible for him to dodge, and even his Emperor Qi protection could not help him at all.

The stream of light directly hit him.

Yao Si could not help taking a few steps back, his face pale.

“Old man, how dare you launch a sneak attack!” Liang Qiu rebuked angrily yet also with some fear.

He was angry because this old man was shameless to attack before giving notice; but he was also frightened because Yao Si could not withstand this sneak attack as the old man’s strength was too terrifying.

The faces of Chi Gui, Wu Chang, and the rest of the Emperor Realm Masters also turned ugly.

They all broke through to the Emperor Realm in this Shattered Star Sea and thought that they could act freely in the Star Boundary from now on, but their pride had been ground down greatly by an unknown old man before they even left the Shattered Star Sea.

If this old man could launch a successful sneak attack on Yao Si so casually, wouldn’t it be even easier for him to launch a sneak attack against them?

It seemed like they could not underestimate any Dao Source Realm cultivator anymore, otherwise, they might not even know how they ended up dying.

Liang Qiu gripped his spear tightly, as if he was ready to fight all out with the old man. Previously, Liang Qiu was deeply moved when Yao Si stood up for him and addressed him as his friend, so now that Yao Si was in danger, he naturally could not just stand by and watch.

Before he could do anything though, Yao Si immediately stretched out his hand to stop him and shouted, “I’m fine, don’t be impulsive!”

Liang Qiu turned to him in astonishment.

With a solemn expression, Yao Si looked down at his palm and his body started shaking. He looked back at the old man in horror and exclaimed, “You are…”

The old man put a finger to his own lips and shushed softly.

Yao Si understood his meaning and hurriedly swallowed the words he was about to blurt out, cupping his fist formally in the next moment and bowing his head, “Yao Si did not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth before and was extremely rude with his words. Please forgive this Junior, Sir!”

His words caused uproar in the crowd. Everyone could not be more shocked as they stared at Yao Si in disbelief.

Yao Si was the son of the Serene Soul Great Emperor, and with his extraordinary aptitude and cultivation, it could be said that, besides a select few who could make him submit, no one else could draw such respectful words from his mouth in the entirety of the Star Boundary, even if their strength was greater than his.

But now, facing this old man, he greeted him in a respectful tone and expression, even sounding a bit… subservient!

The son of a Great Emperor acting humble in front of a Third-Order Dao Source Realm old man and addressing himself as a Junior, just what the hell was going on?

However, everyone did understand one thing; the previous attack of the old man was not really a sneak attack, but some kind of message to Yao Si. It was through this message that Yao Si learnt of the old man’s true identity and became courteous.

The old man chuckled, “I have no choice. Young Lord Yao Si, please don’t mind the reckless action of this old man.”

Yao Si responded in a deep voice, “Of course not, Senior!”

The old man nodded, “Good, take them with you and leave now.”

Yao Si nodded, “Junior will obey Sir’s order!”

Saying so, he lifted his head and swept his eyes at his surroundings, commanding lightly, “If you don’t want to die, follow me!”

Liang Qiu whined reluctantly, “Do we really have to leave? That Space Ring… “

Before he finished his sentence, he found Yao Si staring at him emotionlessly with a pair of bone-chilling cold eyes, which made Liang Qiu’s heart involuntarily skip a beat.

Only then did he give in, the corner of his mouth twitching, “Fine fine, let’s go.”

Yao Si drew back his gaze and quickly rushed far away with a flicker.

Chi Gui and the rest had to follow even though they were still in doubt. If they continued to stay here, they would be disrespecting Yao Si. Chi Gui’s Ahan Temple was located in the Eastern Territory, so if he offended Yao Si now, he would definitely not have any good days in the future.

After a while of hustle and bustle, almost all the Emperor Realm Masters disappeared. Wu Chang pondered for quite a long time, but still decided to leave in the end.

After all, even the descendants of the two Great Emperors, Lan Xun and Yao Si, were persuaded to leave by this old man, and judging from Yao Si’s exaggerated reaction just now, it was clear that this old man was not as simple as he looked.

Someone in Yao Si’s position did not need to rely on falsehoods or deception, so staying here might really be a life-threatening option.

Not only the Emperor Realm Masters, but even a large portion of the remaining Dao Source Realm cultivations left.

In the blink of an eye, less than a thousand Dao Source Realm cultivators remained. Perhaps these Dao Source Realm cultivators did not get many benefits in the Shattered Star Sea yet, so despite the insinuation and persuasion of the old man, they did not want to leave.

They were inextricably attracted to the skeleton of the Great Emperor and the Space Ring inside the black hole.

“You won’t leave?” The old man frowned when he saw Yang Kai still standing still in his spot.

Yang Kai responded in a deep voice, “Tell me about Ruo Xi’s bloodline and I will leave immediately!”

The old man replied, “You will find out in the future.”

“I will keep following you if you don’t tell me,” Yang Kai grinned fearlessly.

The old man swept his eyes over him and snorted, “Little brat, you’re really thick-skinned. How did Wen Zi Shan accept a disciple like you?”

Yang Kai was bewildered, he asked, “How did you know that I am from Azure Sun Temple?”

He had never disclosed this information to anyone since he came here.

The old man laughed softly and pointed his finger at a certain spot of Yang Kai’s body.

Realization dawned on Yang Kai as the Azure Sun Golden Token that he kept close to him was hanging there, revealing this secret. Previously Yang Kai had taken out the Azure Sun Golden Token from his Space Ring in order to easily sense if a message came from Xiao Bai Yi, Murong Xiao Xiao, or any of the others. He did not expect this old man to be able to detect such a small thing on him though.

The old man shook his head, “A fish rots from the head down. If this Old Master ever runs into Wen Zi Shan in the future, he will definitely ask him to expel you!”
