Since Yang Kai wanted these young disciples to familiarize themselves with how to fight the Black Ink Clan, he naturally had to have some kind of control over the situation. The Black Ink Clan was born from Black Ink Nests, so Yang Kai figured all he needed to do was get his hands on one. Yang Kai now only hated himself for not having enough foresight and simply destroying so many Black Ink Nests in Mu Guang’s Royal Domain.

Fortunately, he could still salvage the situation.

The reason he had come to this area under the Black Ink Clan’s control was because he had set his eyes on this Black Ink Nest. As for whether he could take it into his own Small Universe, Yang Kai wasn’t certain.

Back then, he had personally witnessed Zha Gu hatching a Black Ink Nest and had some understanding of its various characteristics; so, he knew that it would be difficult to implement this plan.

There were still some Black Ink Clansmen inside the Black Ink Nest, but Yang Kai quickly cleaned them up.

He then opened his Small Universe, allowing the Black Ink Nest to devour his World Force. Then, using the Black Ink Nest’s Will as a medium, Yang Kai’s consciousness instantly entered a strange space.

This space was formed by the Will of this region’s Territory Lord Black Ink Nest, and at this moment, there were no less than 30 consciousnesses gathered in this space. These consciousnesses were surging, obviously communicating with one another.

The Black Ink Clan of the Blue Sky Theatre had not experienced the tragedy in Mu Guang’s Royal Domain, so they were completely unaware of what would happen next. So, when Yang Kai used his Spiritual Energy to attack them, they didn’t even have time to react.

The consciousnesses were destroyed in an instant; after all, Yang Kai’s Spiritual Energy was on par with a Territory Lord’s, meaning none of these Black Ink Clansmen were a match for him.

When the commotion started, the remaining consciousnesses immediately sensed that something was wrong and naturally pushed their strength to attack Yang Kai.

Yang Kai did not fear this counterattack. The situation he had encountered in the Mu Guang’s Royal Domain could not be compared with what he was experiencing now. At that time, Hei Yuan’s Will had also been lying in ambush for him, together with over 30 Feudal Lords, but in the end, Hei Yuan failed to kill him and his Soul had even been severely wounded, forcing him to retreat.

If it weren’t for this, Hei Yuan wouldn’t have been chased down by a mere Seventh-Order Human Master.

As a result, after Yang Kai’s rampage, the consciousnesses here suffered heavy casualties, and as many as 8 Feudal Lords had their consciousnesses destroyed, with those of several other High-Rank Black Ink Clansmen were also wiped out.

The destruction of these consciousnesses also signified the fall of these Black Ink Clansmen.

The surviving consciousnesses realized that something was horribly wrong and no longer dared to remain. They quickly scattered like birds and beasts in a wildfire, only thinking of escaping.

Yang Kai was unable to chase them all down and could only helplessly sigh as they fled.

Destroying the consciousnesses of a few Feudal Lords was just a matter of course, but that was not Yang Kai’s original plan. After a while, he withdrew his consciousness and exited the Black Ink Nest.

His Divine Sense surged like a tide as he probed the foundation of the Black Ink Nest.

The Black Ink Nest in front of him was thousands of metres tall, like a giant flower bud planted in the ground. It was the typical size of a fully mature Low-Rank Black Ink Nest, but under Yang Kai’s investigation, he realized that its foundation stretched far further.

The entire Universe World was enveloped in the power of this Black Ink Nest. If the Black Ink Nest before him was like a giant tree, then its roots were spread across the entire World.

If Yang Kai wanted to take this Black Ink Nest into his Small Universe, he would have to take this entire Universe World.

This Universe World was not big, but even Yang Kai was unable to take it into his Small Universe.

He already knew this would be the case though and had no intention of taking away the entire Black Ink Nest.

As Space Principles surged and the Void shattered, the roots of the Black Ink Nest were severed one by one, and with the Black Ink Nest as a centre, an area with a radius of over a dozen kilometres was excised from the Universe World.

The next moment, a gateway opened as Yang Kai’s Divine Sense enveloped the landmass with the Black Ink Nest on it, forcefully dragging it into his Small Universe.

This sudden change quaked the entire Universe World.

Yang Kai immersed his consciousness into his Small Universe, but almost immediately, a disappointed look appeared on his face.

He had indeed moved the entire Black Ink Nest into his Small Universe, but perhaps because its roots had been cut off, or perhaps because of some other reason, the Black Ink Nest began to show signs of withering. Even when Yang Kai poured his World Force into it, the Black Ink Nest showed no signs of devouring it.

This was unusual, as Black Ink Nests devoured World Force almost instinctively.

The World Force was a powerful tonic for the Black Ink Nest, but since it was not even devouring a bit of World Force, it undoubtedly meant that it had ceased functioning and was doomed to die.

In fact, after the entire Black Ink Nest was pulled into his Small Universe by Yang Kai, it started collapsing at a speed visible to the naked eye. In less than the time one takes to drink half a cup of tea, it completely withered.

This situation caused Yang Kai to frown. It seemed that taking a Black Ink Nest wasn’t going to be an easy task.

But if he could obtain an unhatched Black Ink Nest, he might be able to hatch it in his Small Universe. There wouldn’t be any problems then.

Be that as it may, unhatched Black Ink Nests were extremely precious even to the Black Ink Clan, so how could Yang Kai obtain one? Unless he could find a Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest and provide it with a massive quantity of materials, it was impossible to get an unhatched nest.

However, this place was not Mu Guang’s Royal Domain, so searching for and entering a Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest would be extremely risky.

The reason Yang Kai had been able to stir up so much chaos in Mu Guang’s Royal Domain last time was firstly because the bulk of the Black Ink Clan Army was engaged in battle with the Human Army, and secondly, the Yin-Yang Pass Old Ancestor had made a move and forced all the remaining Territory Lords who had stayed behind to rush to the Royal Lords’ aid, leaving just Hei Yuan to deal with Yang Kai. Once Yang Kai heavily damaged Hei Yuan’s Soul, he basically had free reign.

The right time, right place, and right conditions made it possible for Yang Kai to act recklessly in Mu Guang’s Royal Domain without anyone to stop him. If even one point was different, he would not have been able to act so brazenly. Even so, in the end, he was unable to destroy more than 10 Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest.

In the Blue Sky Theatre, the Black Ink Clan Army was currently gathering, so there were definitely Territory Lords guarding this place. If Yang Kai tried to wreak havoc, he would attract the attention of those Territory Lords. Not many Territory Lords needed to take action, just two would be enough to threaten him. Once two Territory Lords came at him, even if Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space, he might not be able to escape unscathed.

Yang Kai could not bear such a risk; therefore, he didn’t insist on sticking to his plan of plundering a Black Ink Nest after this attempt failed.

There was still time before the young talents in his Small Universe matured, so he was in no rush for now. It wouldn’t be too late to think of a solution later.

Miao Fei Ping had already returned with his body covered in multiple wounds. Apparently, he had killed many Black Ink Clansmen in this short period of time. His appearance might have been miserable, but he was still filled with zeal and vigour. Furthermore, because of the Purifying Black Ink Pill, he didn’t have to worry about being corrupted by Black Ink Strength for a short time.

“Martial Uncle, since the Black Ink Clan has fled, should we pursue them?” Miao Fei Ping asked eagerly. Obviously, he still did not have enough of the slaughter.

“There’s no need for that, they’re all Low-Rank Black Ink Clansmen. It’s useless to kill them, we will only be wasting time,” Yang Kai indifferently replied.

“Oh, then where are we going?”

Yang Kai pondered for a moment before turning his eyes in the direction they had come from, “You should return to Dawning Light to rest.”

“What about Martial Uncle?” Miao Fei Ping asked.

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “I’m going fishing.”

“Fishing?” Miao Fei Ping was puzzled.

Nonetheless, Yang Kai didn’t pay any heed to it and just stuffed something into his hand, “Take this with you, don’t put it into your Space Ring.”

Miao Fei Ping grabbed it and found that it was a bead, but he had no idea what it was for. So, he asked, “Martial Uncle, what is this?”

“A Space Beacon! With this bead, I can send messages back to you at any time.”

Miao Fei Ping nodded before carefully pocketing the Space Beacon.

“Go.” Yang Kai waved at him.

Miao Fei Ping stated, cupping his fist, “Disciple will go now, Martial Uncle. Please be careful.”

While speaking, he activated the Universe Transference Law. The next moment, a giant Spirit Array glowed beneath his feet before his figure disappeared with a blinding flash.

By the time he reappeared, Miao Fei Ping had already returned to Dawning Light. Walking out of the Universe Array, Bai Yi, who had already sensed the movements, immediately came forward to meet him. However, after seeing Miao Fei Ping alone, she couldn’t help but ask curiously, “Where’s Squad Leader?”

Miao Fei Ping scratched his head, “Martial Uncle said he was going fishing.”

“Fishing?” Bai Yi was puzzled, “Fishing for what?”

Miao Fei Ping shook his head, “I don’t know either, Martial Uncle didn’t explain in detail and only told me to return here.”

Bai Yi slightly furrowed her brow. She faintly felt that Yang Kai was going to cause trouble again; however, since Yang Kai didn’t say anything, he probably had his own considerations. Seeing Miao Fei Ping’s miserable appearance, she couldn’t help but ask, “Did you run into the Black Ink Clan?”

Miao Fei Ping immediately replied in an excited tone, “Martial Uncle brought me to take a Low-Rank Black Ink Nest.”

Speaking of this, he was quite enthused. This was the first time he had gone on a mission with his Martial Uncle, yet he had accomplished such a great feat. It was not something just anyone could easily encounter.

As expected, the other Squad members also became interested after hearing this and began asking questions. Miao Fei Ping didn’t try to hide anything and told them everything about his short trip with Yang Kai, causing all the Squad members to look at him with envy. When they heard that two Feudal Lords were unable to resist the might of Yang Kai’s spear and were instantly killed, all the remaining Squad members felt their spirits soar.

Having a powerful Squad Leader was extremely important on the Black Ink Battlefield. Whether it was the success rate of the mission or the survival rate on the chaotic battlefield, a powerful Squad Leader greatly increased these chances.

The Squad Leader was the core of the entire Squad, and also the basis for Human Squads to work together on the Black Ink Battlefield.

While Dawn Squad’s members were getting all excited, Yang Kai’s lonesome figure flickered as he sped through the void in the direction of the Feudal Lord troop he had discovered earlier.

Being alone, Yang Kai no longer had any scruples. He used Space Principles as his figure flickered across the void.

In less than half a day, Yang Kai found a large group of Black Ink Clansmen gathered on a giant universe fragment.

Standing and observing from afar, Yang Kai found that there were more than 100,000 Black Ink Clansmen gathered on this universe fragment.

This place could basically be considered the periphery of the Black Ink Clan’s territory, not far from the Human Race’s territory. With so many Black Ink Clansmen gathered here, the situation was quite obvious.

This should be one of the mustering points of the Black Ink Clan Army. The Feudal Lords had converged here with their troops under a Territory Lord’s orders; otherwise, it would have been impossible for such a large group to be assembled together.

The Black Ink Clan had indeed become restless. Nearly 100 years of rest and recuperation had given them plenty of time to recover from their losses suffered in the last war. Since they had gathered an army here, it was obvious that they were planning to stage a comeback.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
