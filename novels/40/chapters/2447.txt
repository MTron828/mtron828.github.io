Qi Hai added, ‚ÄúWhich of the Great Emperor‚Äôs artifacts aren‚Äôt sentient? The Mountains and Rivers Bell is the Natal Emperor Artifact of Yuan Ding Great Emperor, it has its own consciousness! If it is willing to choose you as its master, you don‚Äôt even need to refine it! It will take the initiative to run into your arms, but if it doesn‚Äôt find you worthy, even if you are a peak Emperor, you won‚Äôt be able to touch it.‚Äù

The young man‚Äôs eyes lit up when he heard this and he anxiously asked, ‚ÄúBrother Qi, you mean to say if there is an opportunity, even I can become the master of this Mountains and Rivers Bell?‚Äù

Qi Hai stated with a frosty look on his face, ‚ÄúEveryone has an equal opportunity!‚Äù

The young man broke into happy laughter as he proudly proclaimed, ‚ÄúThis Zhang isn‚Äôt confident in other things, but he is quite confident in his own luck. Since the Mountains and Rivers Bell is sentient, it might choose this Zhang as Yuan Ding Great Emperor‚Äôs successor and pass me the mantle of Great Emperor!‚Äù

He broke into a burst of frantic laughter. While speaking, he actually turned around and started walking towards the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

Everyone was startled at the sight of this and they all realized that this guy surnamed Zhang was going to try to make the Mountains and Rivers Bell choose him as its master! For a moment, everyone curiously looked at him, wondering what the final result would be.

Many of them had a change in their expression, also seeming eager to try; however, they suppressed their urges and patiently waited to see what was going to happen.

Qi Hai stared at the young man‚Äôs back and sneered, seemingly mocking his overconfidence.

In front of everyone‚Äôs eyes, the young man advanced unopposed, briskly making his way towards the bell-shaped mountain. Perhaps because of how smoothly he was advancing, his confidence increased and he quickened his pace with ecstasy.

Very soon, he was only fifty metres away from the mountain, and still inching closer and closer to it.

At this moment, all the onlooking cultivators were on the edge, weighing the pros and cons of this situation. Everyone was worried; if this man really got lucky and obtained the Yuan Ding Great Emperor‚Äôs Natal Emperor Artifact, wouldn‚Äôt he be the next Yuan Ding Great Emperor?

After another ten breaths, the young man walked up to the mountain without encountering any obstacles or danger along the way. Everyone was a little taken aback by the fact that he hadn‚Äôt encountered any troubles. At the sight of this, even the originally sneering Qi Hai became a lot gloomier all of a sudden.

Everyone thought, [Is this guy really destined to be its master by the Heavens themselves!?]

The young man couldn‚Äôt help but break into riotous laughter, ‚ÄúI have kept you waiting for far too long. Today, this Zhang will take you away, so you may, once more, proudly walk the Star Boundary. The brilliance of Sir Yuan Ding should not be covered in dust!‚Äù

While speaking this, he reached out his hand and tried to touch the bell.

Immediately, a flash of light pulsated from the mountain, as if it was reacting to the young man‚Äôs words.

This greatly increased the confidence of the young man surnamed Zhang and without any more delay, he pressed his palm onto the mountain peak and spread his Divine Sense, trying to connect with the Artifact Spirit of the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

But right then, something strange happened.

The bell-shaped peak shook ever so slightly as a loud hum reverberated from within. In an instant, the mountain collapsed as rocks and sand flew in every direction.

At the same time, an enormous bell-shaped artifact appeared before everyone‚Äôs eyes. The enormous bell was extremely simple and unsophisticated, but it was exuding an ancient aura as if it had seen and weathered hundreds of thousands of years.

The enormous bell was covered in extremely complex and mysterious runes that were constantly circling on its surface.

Suddenly, the bell started to glow, and while its brilliance was pulsating, a reverberating toll suddenly rang from it.

*Weng‚Ä¶*

At that moment, the world seemed to be about to be torn apart and the Heavens seemed to invert. Mountains and rivers seemed to be suppressed as the sound of the bell spread to the surroundings. Immediately, sound waves visible to naked eyes converged into an indestructible energy wave. Everyone‚Äôs expression drastically changed at the sight of this and they hastily displayed all kinds of defensive techniques.

The moment the bell rang, the young man surnamed Zhang, who was closest to the Mountains and Rivers Bell, seemed to be hit by a mountain, his figure flying high up into the air, profusely bleeding as bits and pieces of his crushed organs spewed out of his mouth along with copious amounts of blood. His Dao Source Realm aura quickly waned as his vitality disappeared in the blink of an eye.

Before he crashed to the ground, the young man was already dead.

*Hualala‚Ä¶*

The aftermath due to the sound wave was still spreading, and the force of impact caused the ground to flip over as if the end was here.

Only after ten breaths did everything slowly subsided.

Several dozen Dao Source Realm cultivators were thrown into a panic as some were even buried under the soil. At this time, everyone finally crawled back up and took the chance to look around, their jaws dropping in astonishment at what they witnessed.

Shocked, they couldn‚Äôt bother to snatch the Star Seal left by the young man surnamed Zhang.

‚ÄúCough cough‚Ä¶‚Äù Qi Hai lightly coughed a few times, patting off the dust on his body as he looked over at the dead young man surnamed Zhang and stated, ‚ÄúIt looks like this opportunity is not for you!‚Äù

Everyone was rendered speechless.

Worthy of being the artifact of a Great Emperor, the might of the Mountains and Rivers Bell was simply extraordinary. The young man surnamed Zhang had only touched it, but that had been enough to set off a huge sound wave that killed him and knocked everyone else flying. If this artifact were really refined, how much power could it exert?

Furthermore, this was definitely not the true might of the Mountains and Rivers Bell; after all, it had been left here for tens of thousands of years, so its power had definitely fallen. It was very likely that the power it had shown just now was not even half of its peak.

Therefore, despite the lesson learned from the young man surnamed Zhang, no one‚Äôs enthusiasm reduced; rather, it had grown stronger.

And because of the shock just now, the Mountains and Rivers Bell hidden in the mountain had been completely revealed. Surprisingly, this Emperor Artifact was several hundreds of metres tall and sat on the ground, looking like a small mountain. The Emperor Aura and the runes circling around it were extremely dazzling. No one could take their eyes off this mysterious treasure as they tried to spy on its secrets from afar!

But now, no one dared to easily touch it. So, although everyone‚Äôs heart was burning with enthusiasm, strangely, everyone had entered a strange stalemate. They seemed to be secretly praying that the Artifact Spirit of the Mountains and Rivers Bell would choose them as its Master without them having to do anything.

At this moment, the bell tolled once more.

Everyone‚Äôs face immediately changed and fell into confusion as no one had touched the Mountains and Rivers Bell this time. So, why was it ringing again?

After having tasted it once, everyone invariably pushed their Source Qi to mount the strongest defence they could while simultaneously summoning their defensive artifacts.

But the shockwave everyone was waiting for never came. Rather, something astonishing happened in the next moment.

Much to everyone‚Äôs surprise, the Mountains and Rivers Bell slightly shook as it rose into the air before shooting straight towards the Starry Sky, leaving a long trail of light behind it.

In an instant, everyone was dumbfounded.

Who knows who reacted first, but someone shouted, ‚ÄúChase it!‚Äù

Just as he said this, he flew off in pursuit.

After finally discovering a treasure left by a Great Emperor, how could these cultivators miss it? So, after that guy who shouted left, several dozen cultivators rose into the air, one after another, and chased after the Mountains and Rivers Bell, leaving all kinds of colourful trails in their wake.

Yang Kai was no exception. T/his chapter is updatùìÆd by nùíêv(√™(l)biin.co/m

Even though he had a lot of Emperor Artifacts, enough to have even gifted one each to Liu Yan, Sister Hua, and the Embodiment, one could never have too many Emperor Artifacts. And he had seen the might of the Mountains and Rivers Bell, making him even more interested in it. This kind of might was even stronger than that of the Annihilation Thunder Bead.

He believed that Qi Hai was right, that it was impossible to obtain this Emperor Artifact without some luck and opportunity, especially since the Mountains and Rivers Bell already had its own sentience. If one wanted to take it, he or she had to get the Artifact Spirit‚Äôs recognition first.

As long as one could get the recognition of the Artifact Spirit though, it would become easy to collect the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

Along the road of cultivation, Yang Kai had obtained countless opportunities, and when it came to good luck, he was confident that he would not lose to anyone, so he still had some hopes that he could collect the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

What‚Äôs more, Yin Le Sheng, whom he had been looking for all the while, was also chasing after the Mountains and Rivers bell.

But the moment Yang Kai flew up, a strange feeling suddenly sprouted deep in his heart. It was weak and unclear, but it still made him feel a little restless.

This strange feeling was elusive to him; and when he deliberately tried to search for its source, he was unable to find anything.

However, the faster Yang Kai flew away, the stronger this feeling became!

It was as if‚Ä¶ if he left this place now, he would deeply regret it!

Yang Kai furrowed his brow and abruptly stopped.

He might be eager to obtain the Mountains and Rivers Bell, but if he couldn‚Äôt understand this feeling‚Ä¶

A figure suddenly shot from behind. Apparently, it was giving chase to the Mountains and Rivers Bell too. Yang Kai focused his gaze on the figure and discovered that it was none other than Lan He.

Seeing him stop, Lan He cast a strange glance at him. However, by the looks of her appearance, she had no intention of paying attention to him, so after a quick glance, she tried to bypass him.

When the two passed one another, Yang Kai‚Äôs expression suddenly changed before he reached out to hold Lan He‚Äôs shoulder.

Lan He‚Äôs expression dramatically changed as her figure made a strange twist and she quickly distanced herself from Yang Kai; however, even though she was quite fast, Yang Kai‚Äôs hand had still brushed her clothes.

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù Lan He angrily shouted. At the same time, she carefully probed the location where Yang Kai had just patted with her Divine Sense, trying to figure out what Yang Kai just did to her.

But to her disappointment, no matter how she probed, she didn‚Äôt find anything.

Yang Kai explained with a smile, ‚ÄúNothing. Don‚Äôt be so nervous, I just wanted to persuade you not to chase after it. So many people are trying to obtain that thing, so you will definitely not be able to get it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhether I can snatch it or not, it‚Äôs none of your business!‚Äù Lan He looked upset. She thought that this guy was a little interesting, but in the end they had only met by chance, so why was he being so meddlesome? What exactly was going through his mind.

Yang Kai shrugged as he replied, ‚ÄúI just wanted to make the suggestion. As for what you do, it is all up to Sister Lan He.‚Äù

Lan He deeply stared at him before speaking, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something wrong with your head!‚Äù

After having said this, she turned around and flew towards the Starry Sky.

If it wasn‚Äôt urgent, she would have definitely taught Yang Kai a good lesson. This guy had been too frivolous from the first time they met, and now he dared to touch her so casually. How utterly shameless!

Unfortunately, her mind was preoccupied with the Mountains and Rivers Bell, so she wasn‚Äôt in the mood to argue with Yang Kai.

However, after this latest incident, her impression of Yang Kai had almost hit rock bottom.

Seeing her gradually moving away, Yang Kai touched his nose in helplessness. He hadn‚Äôt intended to make a move against Lan He specifically, it was just that she was right behind him, so there was no one else for him to target. If it had been someone else, Yang Kai would have still acted the way he did.
