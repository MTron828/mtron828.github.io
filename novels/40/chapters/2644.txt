Yang Kai did not move, however, and instead looked at Xiao Ling’er for a while before asking, “Old Ban, she’s just a little girl. Is it safe for her to be home alone?”

There were all kinds of people in this desolate city, where there was no one to keep order, and fights happened all the time. Xiao Ling’er was just a seven-year-old little girl. If she was involved in any danger, Yang Kai was worried that she would not be able to protect herself.

Before Old Ban could answer, Ling’er crisply replied, “I will not give grandpa trouble.”

Old Ban smiled, “Ling’er is very well-behaved. When I’m not around, she won’t go out.”

Yang Kai shook his head lightly as this was not a matter of her going out or not. If someone really intended to harm Xiao Ling’er, it was useless for her to hide at home. Yang Kai was actually quite surprised Xiao Ling’er had been safe all these years already.

After pondering for a while, Yang Kai asked, “Has Old Ban ever thought of sending her to a Sect to cultivate?”

Old Ban smiled wryly, “Naturally, I’ve thought about it before, but this old man doesn’t have any connections, so there is no Sect that I can send her to. I would rather teach her by myself as a small Sect won’t be able to nurture her well. As for those big Sects, it’s not easy to join them.”

“How about I recommend her to a Sect?” Yang Kai turned to him, “As your reward for leading the way?”

Old Ban was stunned, then he was overjoyed, “Young Master Yang, are you serious?”

Yang Kai smiled lightly, “Why didn’t you ask me where I will send her?”

Old Ban replied, “How could that Sect be bad if Young Master Yang is the one recommending it?”

Yang Kai was an Emperor Realm Master, and Old Ban had witnessed his incredible strength with his own eyes. Since Yang Kai was the one making this offer, he would definitely not send Xiao Ling’er to some nameless Sect.

This was Old Ban’s greatest wish as well as a great opportunity for Xiao Ling’er.

“Ling’er, quickly thank Young Master Yang,” Old Ban ordered Xiao Ling’er, his face flushed in happiness.

Xiao Ling’er did not kneel, however, but instead stared at Yang Kai curiously with a pair of big, blinking eyes, her long eyelashes quivering as she spoke up, “Can Ling’er ask something?”

Yang Kai was amused by her reaction, as he did not expect that a little girl at her age would already be this precocious. He squatted down to a height even with hers, and nodded, “What do you want to ask?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Xiao Ling’er tilted her head for a while, then asked, “Will I be separated from my grandpa?”

Yang Kai nodded, “Yes, there are only women in the place where I’m going to send you. Men are not allowed to stay there.”

Xiao Ling’er quickly shook her head like a rattle drum upon hearing it, “I don’t want to go then. I must accompany grandpa.”

After hearing this, Old Ban stomped his foot anxiously, “You little girl, do you know what you are talking about? It is a great opportunity for you that Young Master Yang wants to send you to a Sect to cultivate. How can you say you don’t want to?”

“I’m not going anywhere without grandpa!” Xiao Ling’er stood her ground firmly.

Old Ban was angry and anxious, though a gush of warmth filled his heart. He glanced at Yang Kai, praying that he would not take back such a good offer because of this.

“Simple and na?ve, lovely and sensible. Xiao Ling’er is a good girl.” Yang Kai smiled as he nodded before he persuaded, “Ling’er, do you remember when your grandpa was captured last time?”

When he spoke those words, Xiao Ling’er’s face changed; she obviously remembered the last incident. Panic surfaced in her big eyes as she responded, “Are you going to catch grandpa if Xiao Ling’er doesn’t agree with you? If so, Xiao Ling’er will follow you, please don’t hurt my grandpa!”

Yang Kai could not stop himself from laughing as he continued, “I will not hurt your grandpa, but since such a thing happened once, then there will always be a second time, or a third time… Do you want to protect your grandpa?”

Xiao Ling’er looked up at Old Ban and heavily bobbed her head, “I do! I want to chase away all the bad guys! I won’t allow anyone to bully grandpa!”

Yang Kai pressed on, “Very good. If you want to chase away all the bad guys though, you need to cultivate to be strong, and in order to do that, you need to join a powerful Sect. Come, follow me, I will let you gain the strength you need to protect your grandpa!”

Xiao Ling’er pursed her lips, struggling.

Yang Kai continued again, “You also won’t have to worry for your grandpa, he will go with us. Although he can’t always be with you like he used to, you can still see him any time as long as you miss him.”

“Really?” Xiao Ling’er asked, her eyes lighting up in surprise.

“Pinky promise!” Yang Kai smiled and straightened his little finger towards Xiao Ling’er.

Xiao Ling’er glanced at his move and made a crisp response, “Pinky promises are for deceiving children. I won’t make a pinky promise with you.”

Yang Kai was speechless. He could not believe that this little girl was already so worldly at her age, but perhaps this was the fate of those who grew up poor and in constant danger.

“But Ling’er believes you,” Xiao Ling’er continued.

She immediately knelt down and bowed to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai stretched out his hand and lifted her up, “You don’t need to bow to me, I am only going to recommend you to a Sect. When the Sect accepts you, it won’t be too late to bow again to your Honoured Master.”

“Good… good… Please wait, Young Master Yang,” Old Ban was delighted. Although he has been staying in this desolate city and had been making a living as a guide for over a hundred years now, if Xiao Ling’er really found a bright future, he would not choose to remain in this chaotic place.

Old Ban only had a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation and was quite advanced in age, so he could not do anything other than act as a guide to earn a few Source Crystals.

Old Ban went into the house to prepare their luggage. Xiao Ling’er looked up at Yang Kai and asked, “My grandpa calls you Young Master Yang, then can I call you Big Brother Yang?”

“Ling’er can call me whatever she wants,” Yang Kai patted her little head.

“Big Brother Yang, where are you going to send Ling’er?”

“Ice Heart Valley!” Yang Kai answered, “You can rest assured that there are many beautiful Big Sisters there who are all gentle and kind. Ling’er will be taken care of very well there.”

“Are there other children like me?”

“Probably,” Yang Kai was not sure about that, but as far as he knew, Ice Heart Valley had always adopted orphans as disciples, so there should be some young children in the valley.

Yang Kai only came up with the idea of introducing Xiao Ling’er to Ice Heart Valley a moment ago. He had already borrowed Old Ban’s expertise to enter the Ancient Lands, moreover, Old Ban did not ask for a reward this time or the previous time, so he wanted to return a favour with a favour by arranging a brighter future for Xiao Ling’er.

Not long after that, Old Ban had finished preparing their luggage and came out of the house and cupped his fists, “Young Master Yang, we are ready to go.”

“Then, let’s go.” With a wave, Yang Kai rapidly lifted Xiao Ling’er up with both hands, and sat her around his neck.

Xiao Ling’er was obviously startled and quickly hugged Yang Kai’s head with both hands, but she was still a child after all and soon started giggling as she regained her balance.

“No, no, no, how could this be appropriate?” On the other hand, Old Ban stared in fear, “Young Master Yang, I’ll take care of Ling’er. It would be impudent of her to sit on your neck.”

Yang Kai waved his hand, “It’s okay. The Ancient Lands Passageway is extremely dangerous, but she will be safe with my protection.”

After hearing this, Old Ban gave up trying to persuade him because Yang Kai was telling the truth. The Ancient Lands Passageway was indeed a dangerous place, so it would be better to have an Emperor Realm Master protect Ling’er rather than trying to do it himself. Thinking so, he once again cupped his fists gratefully, “Many thanks then, Young Master Yang.”

During the journey, Yang Kai briefly introduced Ice Heart Valley to Old Ban and explained his plans for Xiao Ling’er. Old Ban listened to him without objections.

Even though he was located in the Eastern Territory, he had still heard of the great name of Ice Heart Valley as it was a top Sect in the Northern Territory. It was absolutely a blessed opportunity that Xiao Ling’er could join Ice Heart Valley.

In the past, Old Ban did not even dare to dream about such a possibility, but now this far-fetched dream had actually materialised.

He did not know the relationship between Yang Kai and Ice Heart Valley, but since the words came out of Yang Kai’s mouth, what he said should be trustworthy.

At that moment, Old Ban could not help weeping, unable to believe such great happiness could arrive so suddenly.

“Old Ban, you can try to make a living in Ice Moon City after Xiao Ling’er joins Ice Heart Valley. That way, if this little girl misses you, she can come and visit you.”

“Many thanks, Young Master Yang, many thanks indeed for going so far,” Old Ban raised his sleeve and wiped his eyes.

…..

The Ancient Lands Passageway was still shrouded in strange fog, while Yin Souls flew about, vigorous wind blew, and bolts of thunder fell.

However, Old Ban was an expert on all things here and led them on a path that avoided almost all of these dangers.

It took about ten days for the group of three to pass through the Ancient Lands Passageway and enter the Ancient Wild Lands.

Wild Force pervaded the air and seemed capable of corroding any living being composed of flesh and blood. With Xiao Ling’er in his arms, Yang Kai told Old Ban to stay close to him and then flew straight towards the depths of the Ancient Lands.

Old Ban was shaking along the way as, although he went in and out of the Ancient Lands countless times, this was the first time that he really stepped into the Ancient Wild Lands. After all, the Ancient Lands were so perilous that he would not be able to survive with his weak cultivation.

But looking at Yang Kai’s steady composure entering the Ancient Lands as if walking into his own garden, Old Ban was filled with a rush of admiration for the young man.

He had a doubt though. Yang Kai clearly said that he would introduce Xiao Ling’er to Ice Heart Valley, but Ice Heart Valley was in the Northern Territory, while Yang Kai was heading deeper into the Ancient Lands. The two places were in totally opposite directions, and he had no clue about what Yang Kai was up to.

They flew at full speed along the way. It was the first time Xiao Ling’er experienced the fun of flight, and she giggled from time to time, which flustered Old Ban to keep reminding her to not laugh so loudly for fear of attracting the Ancient Lands’ Monster Race.

But of course, just about half a day after entering the Ancient Lands, Monster Qi suddenly soared into the sky in front of the trio, followed by the appearance of a group of Monsters with vicious looks on their faces. The leader of this group even exuded an aura that was comparable to an Emperor Realm Master.

“A Monster Commander!” Old Ban’s face went pale, his clothes drenched in cold sweat.

He did not expect that the first Monster Race that they encountered in the Ancient Wild Lands would be the Monster Commander, who was also leading many Monster Soldiers and Monster Generals.

[We’re dead!]

Although Yang Kai had an Emperor Realm cultivation, their opponents were not weak, and he was afraid that if Yang Kai had to fight, the odds were most likely against him rather than in his favour.

“How dare someone from the Human Race run rampant in our Ancient Wild Lands!? Report your name quickly and perhaps this King will grant you a peaceful death!” The Monster Commander roared loudly while the Monster Soldiers and Monster Generals behind him howled restlessly. In an instant, the clamorous group of Monster Beast mounts they rode sent up a loud ruckus, producing a terrifying scene.

Old Ban was on the verge of fainting, trembling violently while Xiao Ling’er nervously grabbed Yang Kai’s hair, her face as white as a sheet of paper.

However, Yang Kai stood still on his ground, looking coldly at the Monster Commander.

Influenced by the excitement of his subordinates, the Monster Commander on the other side got excited as well and flaunted his majesty, “Puny Human, are you scared? You… huh?”

Before he had finished his words, he suddenly shuddered. The next moment, his eyes widened and he carefully looked at Yang Kai’s face. In an instant, the Monster Commander’s face changed drastically, like he had just seen a ghost, and he hurriedly shouted, “Everyone shut up! Make way, make way, quickly make way!”
