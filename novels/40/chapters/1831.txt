Gui Zu’s words were both upright and profound, so he was shocked and somewhat embarrassed that no one responded to him after he finished. The nearly ten thousand disciples in the square seemed to have been struck by lightning and were unable to move.

Quietly turning his head to look at Yang Kai, Gui Zu discovered that this little brat had already wrapped his arms around Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang and was whispering something to them quietly, totally ignoring his plight. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

[Little bastard! Abandoning me when I need you most!] Gui Zu cursed in his heart.

But in the next moment, a loud shout suddenly sounded.

“What Supreme Elder said is right! I won’t disappoint Supreme Elder and Sect Master’s expectations!”

“Advance and retreat together with Supreme Elder, live and die together with the Sect!”

“Supreme Elder and Sect Master can rest assured, I will definitely work hard to cultivate so the Sect will soon stand equal then dominate above the three great forces of Star Field!.”

“Supreme Elder is mighty! I will obey all of Supreme Elder’s orders!”

Gui Zu’s recruitment seemed to have injected a dose of hot blood into the High Heaven Sect, causing everyone to be excited.

Gui Zu secretly breathed a sigh of relief as he experienced an inexplicable feeling. If he were to put it into words, it would be like the ugly daughter-in-law who came to see her in-laws and finally managed to obtain their approval...

[This is quite stressful. Aren’t I a Second-Order Origin King? Didn’t I come here to accept worship and blessings? Why did it all become so complicated?]

Gui Zu really could not understand his own feelings.

Quickly adjusting himself, he tried to put on the appearance of a powerful master and smiled lightly, “Today is the first time this old master has stood before you but... En, this old master has not prepared anything as a gift on first greetings, so instead, this old master will speak about his comprehensions of the Martial Dao for the next three days. During this time, if any of you have any questions about your cultivation, you may ask them, and this old master will answer them if he can.”

As soon as this statement came out, the nearly ten thousand disciples became even more excited. Although they were excited, all of them tried to restrain themselves and immediately sat down cross-legged, giving their full attention to Gui Zu.

There were not many opportunities to listen to the teachings of a Second-Order Origin King, and every cultivator, throughout the course of their cultivation, would encounter difficulties and questions. These problems may appear when one tried to cultivate Secret Arts or Martial Skills, when refining artifacts, or even when trying to comprehend the Martial Dao and Heavenly Way. If at that time, there was someone to guide and teach them, they could save much time and difficulty.

Now, there was a Second-Order Origin King who would speak of his own experiences and answer their questions. This was a once-in-a-lifetime chance, so how could the disciples not get excited?

Seeing all the disciples give him so much face comforted Gui Zu’s heart, and after clearing his throat, he began to speak, his words reverberating across the square. Within a short time, all the disciples showed mesmerized expressions, completely immersed in his explanations of the Martial Dao and Heavenly Way.

“Two Senior Sisters, I haven’t seen you for many days. Junior Brother has missed you very much. Come come, let’s find a quiet place to talk in private,” Yang Kai saw that Gui Zu was at ease, so he didn’t pay him anymore mind, tightening his hold on Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang as he walked out with them shamelessly.

“Junior Brother!” Su Yan’s pretty face flushed red as she gave him a disapproving glance, “We have lots of time. Today, Supreme Elder is discussing his life experiences, so it is a rare opportunity. I want to stay...”

“I want to stay too...” Xia Ning Chang looked at Yang Kai eagerly.

“There will be plenty of opportunities for that. If you want to, I can have him speak to you personally another day,” Yang Kai grinned meaningfully.

Hearing this, Gui Zu, who was full of vigour on the stage, almost tripped and fell to the ground. Shooting a glare towards Yang Kai viciously, he felt that this boy was just using him to please his women. Absolutely shameless!

“How could we do that? Supreme Elder is the Supreme Elder after all...” Xia Ning Chang was a little worried.

“You don’t need to worry about that,” Yang Kai ignored Gui Zu’s glare and just chuckled lightly, “Supreme Elder wants to ask you for Alchemy, so he can teach a little to you when the time comes.”

“Supreme Elder want to request Alchemy from me?” Xia Ning Chang glanced over at Gui Zu.

Gui Zu’s heart was shaking as he wondered if this woman was the Origin King Grade Alchemist mentioned by Yang Kai. Indeed, Yang Kai had said that his Senior Sister was an Origin King Grade Alchemist back then, and this innocent looking woman did have a strong pill fragrance about her, one that could only be obtained by constantly refining pills.

[So, it really is her!]

Thinking so, Gui Zu hurriedly squeezed out a smile and nodded to Xia Ning Chang, not daring to be careless while he continued to speak without stopping.

“Look, Supreme Elder has agreed,” Yang Kai struck while the iron was hot and quickly ran off with Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang, not giving them a chance to hesitate. The two women flushed with shame and lowered their heads, unable to argue any further.

Halfway back though, Xia Ning Chang suddenly remembered something and said, “By the way, Junior Brother, Sister Yang Yan...”

“I know!” Yang Kai interrupted her.

When he returned to High Heaven Sect just now, Yang Kai had already noticed Yang Yan’s Divine Sense sweeping him briefly before disappearing in a flash, so he was almost certain she had awakened!

The legendary Starry Sky Great Emperor had returned!

However, he did not have time to deal with Yang Yan’s affairs right now as he first needed to attend to Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang.

.....

Five days later, Hundred Flowers Peak.

Yang Kai walked up the long mountain road, but as soon as he reached the peak, a young girl suddenly flew towards him. Mid-air, her slender calf swept out. There was no energy fluctuation coming from her body, so it seemed she was only using her physical strength.

Yang Kai’s face turned extremely solemn, however, and with a low shout, he stabilized his stance and raised his right arm to block.

*Hong...*

As if two giant mountains collided with one another at high speed, a violent blasting sound filled the air and the ground under Yang Kai’s feet suddenly turned into dust. The young girl who suddenly attacked Yang Kai also cried out as she flew backwards.

Turning mid-air, the young girl dexterously adjusted her position before landing gracefully. The next moment though she bent down and began rubbing her leg while glaring at Yang Kai, “Uncle Sect Master, is your body made of steel? That hurt so much!”

While complaining, a few tears squeezed out from her eyes.

“Silly little girl,” Yang Kai looked at her with a smile. “Every time I see you, you try to attack me. Why, are you that confident in your physical strength?”

“Hmph,” The little girl snorted slightly as she pointed her nose towards the sky, “Great Elder said that I have the Tyrant Strength Body that grants immense strength, and Martial Aunt Yang Yan also said that I have great talent, but they must be lying to me. I can’t even tidy up Uncle Sect Master after eating so many Shadowed Heaven Pills.”

“Haha, they’re not lying to you, it’s just that you’re too young. When you’re my age...”

“Then I can tidy you up?” The little girl asked excitedly.

“Nope! You’re still growing, but so am I, so you’re not the only one who will be getting stronger and stronger, but... why are you so keen to tidy me up?” Yang Kai stared at the little girl in amazement.

The little girl was of course Lin Yun’er, the orphan adopted by Huang Juan.

As time passed, Lin Yun’er’s physical prowess was becoming more and more terrifying. The power hidden in her tiny body was almost on par with that of an average Origin Realm master, and if she used her Saint Qi as well, she would be able to fight against Origin Returning Realm cultivators with ease.

[How old is this little girl? This year, she should not be more than sixteen. Nevertheless, she has already achieved such astonishing strength.] Yang Kai could almost imagine that she would become the most famous master of the Star Field in the future.

Hearing Yang Kai’s question, Lin Yun’er promptly replied, “Martial Aunt Yang Yan said that if Yun’er can clean up Uncle Sect Master, she will take me to a good place to make me stronger.”

“Haha...” Yang Kai’s mouth twitched as he glanced over towards Yang Yan who was sipping tea lightly in front of her Hundred Flower Pavilion.

After awakening, Yang Yan gave off a vastly different feeling from before, and when Yang Kai looked at her, he could not help feeling this difference, causing him to frown slightly.

“I thought you would stay in First Heavenly Palace forever and never come see me,” Yang Yan put down the teacup in her hand and smiled at Yang Kai meaningfully. “Were these past few days enjoyable?”

“It was alright,” Yang Kai’s face was not thin, but even he couldn’t help going slightly red at this moment. Glancing over to the side and seeing Gui Zu standing next to Yang Yan, he could not help asking in surprise, “Oh, Supreme Elder is also here, what a coincidence.”

“Haha...” Now it was Gui Zu’s turn to have his face twitch.

Actually, Yang Kai had noticed him the moment he arrived, but looking at Gui Zu’s appearance, it seemed that he had suffered a big loss at Yang Yan’s hands. At this moment, he stood behind Yang Yan respectfully like a servant, not daring to reveal the slightest bit of his evil aura, instead even shrinking his neck as if trying to make himself seem smaller.

“This is your newly recruited Supreme Elder, right?” Yang Yan pointed to Gui Zu and asked Yang Kai.

“En, Senior Gui Zu has a Second-Order Origin King cultivation. which is sufficient for a position of Supreme Elder of the Sect,” Yang Kai said as he walked up to the Hundred Flower Pavilion and sat opposite Yang Yan.

Lin Yun’er followed obediently and poured Yang Kai a glass of water with a smile.

She seemed very relaxed in front of Yang Yan, without the slightest pressure, a stark contrast to Gui Zu, who was like a mouse being stared at by a cat...

“His cultivation is so-so, but... he doesn’t seem to know the immensity of Heaven and Earth,” Yang Yan snorted softly.

Yang Kai clearly saw Gui Zu shiver when he heard these words come out.

As Yang Kai has guessed, he had suffered a big loss at Yang Yan’s hands! But what had Gui Zu done? Yang Kai also became curious and could not help looking at him.

Gui Zu squeezed out an ugly smile and said, “Senior, this is the first time this old man has held the post of Supreme Elder so he couldn’t help acting a bit insolent and having eyes but failing to see, causing him to accidentally offend Senior. I hope Senior can be forgiving and not lower herself to this old man’s level.

“Lower herself to your level, this Queen?” Yang Yan looked at him with a grin, “Just yesterday you said you would answer this Queen’s questions about cultivation. This Queen has not even thanked you for your offer yet. In fact, I have some things I wish to ask you today. I wonder if Supreme Elder has the time?”

“Senior must be joking...” Gui Zu almost cried, “This old man really didn’t know Senior’s identity and thought you were just an ordinary disciple, as such...”

“Supreme Elder, you didn’t take the initiative to try to teach her, did you?” Yang Kai’s jaw dropped.

Gui Zu nodded slightly with a distraught look on his face.

Yang Kai picked up the teacup and took a light sip as he tried very hard not to smile, his shoulders shaking noticeably from the effort.
