However, this woman had proven herself to be extremely cunning. It was hard to be sure whether she was just feigning unconsciousness or not, so Yang Kai had no intention of letting her go and just silently activated his Purifying Light.

A short while later, his left and right hands glowed in two different colours that merged and fused together into a dazzling white light, completely enveloping the two bodies that were in close contact with each other.

The almost unconscious Black Ink Disciple suddenly looked pained and a hoarse noise escaped from her throat. She instinctively tried to struggle, but with Yang Kai keeping her locked in place, it was useless no matter how much she resisted.

*Ci La La…*

Black Ink Strength could be seen seeping out of her body before disappearing without a trace. The pained look on the Black Ink Disciple’s face also gradually disappeared, and her expression softened.

After a few moments, when no more Black Strength came out, Yang Kai finally let go. Only now was he sure that she had no more energy to resist.

Exhausted, Yang Kai collapsed spread-eagled and gasped hard. Even though the woman next to him was unconscious, her brow was still furrowed, as if she were having a nightmare.

It was only after a few moments that Yang Kai struggled to sit up and stuffed some energy-recovering Spirit Pills into his mouth and silently began refining them.

The woman still showed no signs of waking up. She had sustained several injuries from Yang Kai after being chased down by him for several days. Then, she had hidden in the shadows in order to ambush the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Master, which led to her using a powerful Secret Technique that further aggravated her condition. Finally, she suffered a rough beating from Yang Kai. Even though she had regained her free will, she was still suffering from her overexertion and injuries.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged next to her and stuffed some Spirit Pills into her mouth, helping her swallow them before activating his Towering Evergreen Divine Manifestation, enveloping them both in its rich, soothing vitality.

Fortunately, there were no signs of any Black Ink Clansmen around this area; otherwise, he would surely end up in another battle after making such a ruckus.

The woman ended up sleeping for a whole day. At some point, her long lashes fluttered, then her eyes flitted open suddenly and her small body shot up from the ground. Reaching towards the void, she grabbed her longbow, which was even longer than the length of her body.

The bow was drawn with great familiarity, and a golden light was pointed straight at Yang Kai, ready to strike.

Yang Kai remained seated on the ground without moving, not even trying to defend himself. He just looked up at her with a compassionate expression and comforted, “No need to be nervous.”

The young woman looked steadily at him for a moment, then her expression changed slightly as she finally remembered what happened before she fell unconscious, and she could not help but frown. Lowering her bow, she asked with some surprise, “Senior Brother saved me?”

Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

Even though these were her own experiences that she remembered so vividly, the woman still found it hard to believe, “How was Senior Brother able to save me? What sort of technique did you use?”

Many others had either died at the hands of the Black Ink Disciples or turned into weapons against their own people by the Black Ink Clan. This had been the painful reality for the Human Race since the beginning of the war.

Despite her great mental strength, she still could not hide her shock.

Yang Kai smiled, “I have a Secret Technique that can purify and dispel Black Ink Strength.”

The young woman pondered for a moment, “That white light?”

“Indeed!”

The woman nodded, seemingly having an epiphany, “No wonder!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Hm?” Yang Kai looked at her in confusion.

The young woman explained, “During the war ten years ago, one thing that struck the Black Ink Clan as odd was the fact that there were essentially no new Black Ink Clan Disciples who were converted after a certain point in time. The Black Ink Clan suspected that we Humans had obtained some sort of countermeasure against Black Ink Strength, but they were never able to figure out what it was. Obviously, that would be the Secret Technique that Senior Brother wielded.”

Yang Kai nodded, “That is correct.”

The young woman had a solemn look for a moment, then she put away her bow and cupped her fist, “Bai Yi thanks Senior Brother for his life-saving grace.”

Only then did Yang Kai learn her name. He stood up and cupped his fist in return, “Don’t mention it. En, my name is Yang Kai. And also, I’m no Senior Brother. I’ve only just advanced to the Seventh Order not long ago. In terms of seniority, I think you might be my Martial Aunt.”

Bai Yi shook her head, “You are in the Seventh Order, and your abilities surpass mine, so you should be referred to as Senior Brother.” While speaking up to this point, Bai Yi recalled the days when she was fighting with Yang Kai in that deadly chase and asked in disbelief, “Senior Brother has only just advanced to the Seventh Order?”

Yang Kai nodded, “I broke through at the end of the last war between the two races.”

Bai Yi could not help but feel shaken. For him to have almost driven her into a corner despite only having recently advanced into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, just how strong was his heritage? If Yang Kai had more time to cultivate, then how could she even be his opponent? She was considered a Heaven-sent prodigy, and even though she had the sense to know that she was not that different from other Seventh-Order Masters in terms of pure strength, once she has some distance from her opponent, ordinary Seventh-Order Masters would not even be able to get close to her.

However, after repeated tussles with Yang Kai, she finally understood that there were always people beyond people, Heavens beyond the Heavens.

“Senio… Junior Sister Bai, is your body all right?” Yang Kai asked out of concern. Since she insisted on calling him Senior Brother, so be it.

Only then did Bai Yi take the time to examine herself. After a moment, she responded, “Nothing serious. I overexerted myself a lot and will need to restore my energy. Has Senior Brother helped me recover from my injuries?”

She remembered her wounds well, and even though some of her injuries would recover while she was unconscious, there was no way they would heal so quickly. That meant that someone helped her recover while she was unconscious, and naturally, Yang Kai was the only possible person.

As she spoke, she touched her forehead, feeling a wave of dizziness coming on. Memories of Yang Kai’s world-shattering headbutts were still fresh, as if they had just happened. Even after living for such a long time, it was the first time in her life that she had been treated that way, so it was a novel experience for her.

Yang Kai laughed awkwardly, “As to what happened before, I had no choice but to do it. Please do not blame me for my indiscretion, Junior Sister.”

Bai Yi nodded, “I understand. Senior Brother was merely trying to save me, not to kill me; otherwise, there was no need to go so far. Only, during that time, I… I’ve caused a lot of trouble for Senior Brother. My apologies!”

Saying so, a look of remorse appeared on her face.

Yang Kai sighed, “Once corrupted and transformed by Black Ink Strength, only the Black Ink Clan is supreme; it is not your fault. En, since Junior Sister is fine, let us head back. There is a forward base nearby. Junior Sister should know about it.”

Yang Kai looked at her in confusion, “Is Junior Sister feeling unwell?”

Bai Yi shook her head and suddenly looked straight at him, “Senior Brother, do you want to kill a Territory Lord?”

Yang Kai raised a brow, “Junior Sister, what do you mean?”

Bai Yi explained, “Usually, as you and I are both only Seventh-Order, we would definitely be no match for a Territory Lord; however, there is a good opportunity at hand now. If we do this right, then there’s a good chance we’ll be able to pull it off!”

Yang Kai understood what she meant, “Junior Sister is referring to the Territory Lord who escaped earlier?”

Bai Yi nodded, “That was Zhu Feng Territory Lord who served under Men Xie Royal Lord. I used to be his Black Ink Disciple. He and Xu Bo Liang, Division Commander Xu, were engaged in a particularly brutal fight. Though he managed to escape with my help, Zhu Feng’s foundation was severely damaged. He must be back at his Black Ink Nest, recovering from those injuries. If you and I were to ambush him now, there is a good chance that we can take him down.”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, but the light in them was bright, “Is Junior Sister sure? If Zhu Feng is healing, then there must be Masters standing guard around him. You and I are only two people, and though our strengths are not bad, how high could the possibility of killing him be?”

Bai Yi shook her head, “Senior Brother may not know, but the Black Ink Clan is not a monolith, and there is a lot of treachery lurking in the dark. If given the opportunity, weaker Black Ink Clansmen can see their strength soaring by devouring the energy of higher-ranking Clansmen. Currently, Zhu Feng has been severely injured, so no matter what, he would not allow this news to reach the ears of other Territory Lords or even most of the Feudal Lords under his command. Otherwise, once this news is leaked, there is no guarantee that the other Territory Lords may not have malicious thoughts about him. Even the Feudal Lords under him might take the risk to attack him. Once they devour his energy, it would be enough for a Feudal Lord to advance and become a Territory Lord.”

Yang Kai nodded at her words, “I have indeed heard of such a thing.”

He had lived in the Black Ink Clan’s territory for two years, so he had naturally heard about this. Back then, Nu Yan had expressed his desire to devour a Feudal Lord more than once in front of him. Unfortunately, he never had any opportunities to do so, so he could only bring Yang Kai around to pick gambling fights and earn Black Ink Coins.

This kind of information was no secret either. The Great Passes of the Human Race all possessed this knowledge.

Bai Yi nodded, “If it were any ordinary injury, then those Feudal Lords naturally wouldn’t have any funny thoughts; however, Zhu Feng’s injuries were severe, so he surely wished to conceal the news. And, the place where he was recovering now was only guarded by a few of his most trusted subordinates.”

“You know where he goes to rest?”

Bai Yi nodded, “Approximately, yes; after all, I was one of the Black Ink Disciples under him and had access to many of his secrets.”

Yang Kai began to ponder.

The temptation of a heavily injured Territory Lord was great. If they could take this opportunity to kill him, then that would be enough to deal a severe blow to the Black Ink Clan’s activities in this region, which would naturally be a great benefit to the Humans.

However, doing this would mean taking on a hefty risk.

After all, that was still a Territory Lord. A starving camel was still bigger than a horse. The desperate measures one could bring out when facing death were not to be underestimated, not to mention the fact that the Territory Lord had his trusted subordinates by his side, protecting him.

Even if they did succeed, there would still be a battle to be had during their escape.

“Senior Brother, this opportunity is not to be missed. If we wait any longer and Zhu Feng manages to make any sort of recovery, it will become impossible to succeed,” Bai Yi quickly tried to persuade Yang Kai when she saw his hesitance.

Yang Kai glanced at her and finally made up his mind, nodding, “Very well. I will join forces with Junior Sister to kill Zhu Feng.”

Seeing him agree, Bai Yi finally smiled, “Senior Brother definitely won’t regret this.”

“However, the two of us still have to recover before we go,” Yang Kai advised.

Personally, his condition was fine; however, Bai Yi’s aura was currently very weak, and it was indeed necessary for her to restore her energy first. Otherwise, where would she find the energy to ambush Zhu Feng?

As such, the two of them settled down to recover their strength.
