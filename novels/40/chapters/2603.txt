“Honoured Master is still alive…” The Third Disciple stumbled as she showed a relieved smile and then began to laugh out loud, “Honoured Master… Honoured Master, Honoured Master, where are you?”

As she spoke, the Third Disciple actually began to cry in a pitiful manner as if she was lost and couldn’t find her way back home.

Yang Kai’s expression instantly darkened, realizing that the Third Disciple’s condition was rather unstable and her emotions were prone to wild swings.

*Shua…*

The Third Disciple suddenly flashed and arrived behind Yang Kai. Tears were still on her face, but she suddenly laughed, “Honoured Master! So, this is where you were! Disciple shall brush your hair!”

As she spoke, she grabbed Yang Kai’s messy hair with her hand and began to carefully comb it.

[What’s going on!?] Yang Kai used his Divine Sense to inspect the Third Disciple, quickly discovering that even though her consciousness was in utter chaos, her expression had calmed down as she helped him comb his hair. She was serious and meticulous about combing each and every strand.

Has she mistaken him for Senior Bing Yun?

However, his figure wasn’t anywhere similar to Bing Yun’s. He wasn’t even the same gender! Wouldn’t it be impossible for any slightly normal person to mistake him for Bing Yun? It seemed the chaos in the Third Disciple’s consciousness was quite severe.

Yang Kai suddenly had a flash of inspiration as he frowned and quickly said, “Unfilial Disciple, do you know your wrongs!?”

After he said this, the Third Disciple standing behind him actually trembled with fear covering her face. She hurriedly came out from behind his back and faced Yang Kai while kneeling on the ground with her head lowered, saying in a shaking voice, “Honoured Master, please enlighten me!”

She really was treating him as Senior Bing Yun.

Yang Kai was secretly happy about this, but he acted with a severe expression as he scolded, “Your Master has safely returned to Ice Heart Valley, so why have you continued wandering about? Could it be that the colourful outside world has disturbed your Martial Heart and caused you to forget about returning?”

The Third Disciple answered in a shaky voice, “Disciple wouldn’t dare. This disciple was outside… This disciple was outside because…”

She was unable to explain what she was doing even after quite a while. It seemed as if she had forgotten what the whole purpose of leaving Ice Heart Valley was and a look of confusion gradually arose on her dirty face.

Yang Kai secretly felt that things had taken a turn for the worse. If he allowed her to continue thinking about it, perhaps things would become troublesome, so he immediately shouted, “Since you don’t dare, then come back with your Master to Ice Heart Valley, and serve by my side. You’re forbidden from going outside again unless you receive my command!”

The confusion on the Third Disciple’s face instantly disappeared as she respectfully answered, “Yes, Disciple understands!”

Yang Kai gently nodded, “Very good. Get up!”

“Many thanks, Honoured Master!”

“Stand over there to the side. Your Master needs to cultivate to heal… her injuries. During this time, do not permit anyone to approach!” Yang Kai tried to give another command.

The Third Disciple obediently listened and immediately stood to the side with a vigilant expression in her beautiful eyes. She scanned the surroundings, as if she really was standing guard for Yang Kai.

Seeing her like this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief. He wasn’t trying to intentionally take advantage of the Third Disciple, but if left to her own devices, she would always appear and disappear like a ghost. If he really let her escape again, it wasn’t certain if he could find her once more. It was a good thing that he could stabilize her with this method for now.

Yang Kai secretly observed the Third Disciple for a while and saw that she didn’t show any signs of going insane. Only then did Yang Kai silently begin cultivating to help his body absorb the medicinal efficacies of the Phoenix Blood Fruit.

He was quite seriously injured this time. Without even mentioning his torn flesh, more than ten of his bones were broken. It was even worse in his legs, as both of them had been shattered by Shi Huo’s attacks. His five viscera and six organs were also filled with blood and his insides were in terrible shape.

Luckily, Yang Kai had a strong constitution, and his Golden Blood had extremely powerful restorative properties. An otherwise-normal person with such injuries would either have died already or been on the verge of death.

Emperor Qi flowed through his body as he gradually absorbed the medicinal efficacies of the Phoenix Blood Fruit. His shattered bones gradually mended, and his injured and swollen face restored itself.

The Phoenix Blood Fruit truly was a wondrous healing medicine. Yang Kai already felt that there were no major problems anymore before he even fully absorbed the spirit fruit’s medicinal efficacies.

However, his newly mended bones would require several days to set before they would be fully restored like new.

One hour later, Yang Kai opened his eyes and glanced over towards the Third Disciple. He saw that she was still standing there in order to stand guard for his sake.

Ten kilometres away, with the three Divine Venerables as their leaders, many Monster Kings and Great Kings, and even the Stone Spirit Clan were all silently looking in this direction. Everyone had different expressions and complex feelings in their hearts.

It was even more so for Xie Wu Wei. He had previously been filled with unhappiness when Yang Kai forced him to become his Soul Slave. He felt that Yang Kai was far too shameless and underhanded. If it wasn’t for Yang Kai adding insult to injury, threatening to refine his Soul after he died, he never would have been willing to hand over his Soul Brand.

However, Xie Wu Wei no longer dared to think like this.

The three Divine Venerables were so respectful in front of Yang Kai. As Yang Kai healed himself, the three Divine Venerables didn’t even dare to disturb him, and even issued the command for all Monster Kings and Great Kings to memorise Yang Kai’s appearance and to treat him like a Divine Venerable if they saw him in the future.

Even the Divine Venerables didn’t dare to act arrogantly in front of Yang Kai. A Monster King like Xie Wu Wei was nothing in comparison!

Xie Wu Wei was impressed, truly impressed. He was also filled with incredible regret. If only he had known earlier that the little girl next to Yang Kai was the Heaven’s Order descendant, he would have tried to build a good relationship with Yang Kai.

If he had done a good job, perhaps when that Heaven’s Order descendant from earlier entered the Blood Gate, she would even be generous enough to bring him inside as well. But now, the Heaven’s Order descendant had entered the Blood Gate already and only brought a single Stone Spirit in to inherit Tai Yue’s power, while all he could do was be jealous.

Xie Wu Wei felt so much regret that his heart hurt when he thought of this.

“Third Disciple, call over the three Divine Venerables and Stone Spirit Elder.” Yang Kai suddenly issued a command.

The Third Disciple bowed and then headed towards the location ten kilometres away. Yang Kai went by himself to the Mountains and Rivers Bell on the ground and inspected it, as if he wanted to see a flower on this bell.

He was forced to dispel the Soul Imprint on the Mountains and Rivers Bell, so this Ancient Exotic Artifact had once again become a Masterless object. Nobody had touched it ever since it landed here.

Ten kilometres away, the Third Disciple had just arrived by flying over. Upon a glance, it was clear how tattered her clothing was and how dirty her pretty face was. It was almost impossible to tell what her original appearance was.

Everyone looked at her with curiosity, not knowing who she was.

Xie Wu Wei did know that Yang Kai had been searching for the Third Disciple all this time, and he had also seen the Third Disciple’s appearance before, but now wasn’t a convenient time for him to say anything.

“My Honoured Master commanded me to invite the three Divine Venerables and Stone Spirit Elder over for a discussion!” The Third Disciple glanced at Fan Wu and the others and spoke in a light tone.

“Honoured Master…” Fan Wu and the others had astonished expressions when they heard this. They had no idea what had happened.

They knew quite clearly that Yang Kai’s cultivation was only in the First-Order Emperor Realm, while this dirty woman before them was in the Second-Order Emperor Realm.

Why would she address him as Honoured Master?

However, judging from this woman’s tone and attitude, it didn’t seem like she was joking.

Fan Wu was filled with questions, but he couldn’t exactly ask them out loud, so he just smiled and nodded, “Please lead the way.”

After he said that, he was about to head over, but then it seemed like he quickly thought of something as he turned towards Stone Spirit Elder and extended his hand, “Elder, please go ahead first!”

Elder chuckled and knew what Fan Wu was worried about, so he also made an inviting gesture and went forward with the three Divine Venerables all in unison.

Not long after, the four arrived at the earlier battlefield under the Third Disciple’s lead.

“Honoured Master!” Third Disciple shouted to indicate to Yang Kai that she had already brought who he wanted over. She then respectfully stood to the side.

Yang Kai nodded and walked forward to greet them.

“Sir Yang!” Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Gou all immediately cupped their fists in greeting and forced slight smiles.

However, Yang Kai didn’t even glance at them as he directly walked over to the Stone Spirit Elder and smiled in greeting, “Elder!”

Fan Wu and the others all felt rather awkward, but they couldn’t really say anything, so they could only step back embarrassedly.

“Sir Yang!” Elder didn’t dare to be rude. Even if it was just taking Yang Kai’s intimate relationship with the Heaven’s Order descendant into consideration, not a single living being in the entire Ancient Lands would dare to behave arrogantly in front of Yang Kai.

Yang Kai pushed down Elder’s cupped fists and sighed, “Elder also saw that while things today may have had their ups and downs, in the end, fortunately I did not fail my mission. Xiao Xiao has now entered the Blood Gate, and Ruo Xi is taking care of him, so he’ll definitely be able to inherit the power of Tai Yue soon.”

Even though Elder had already learned of what happened from Fan Wu and the others, he was still really excited to hear Yang Kai personally saying this. His body slightly trembled as he said, “Sir Yang’s great favour is something that my Stone Spirit Clan shall remember for eternity.”

“Elder is being too polite!” Yang Kai smiled, “Although Xiao Xiao is a member of the Stone Spirit Clan, I also raised him myself, so of course I hope to see him doing well. Elder, we’re all one family, so don’t act as if we’re strangers.”

Elder’s eyes lit up, “It is Shi Jiu’s greatest fortune in life that he was able to follow Sir Yang, as well as the greatest fortune of my Stone Spirit Clan.”

Yang Kai told him, “Elder, please rest assured, the Stone Spirit Clan shall never be bothered again in this Ancient Lands, nor will anyone force you to do anything that you don’t want to do…” After saying this, Yang Kai glanced sideways at Fan Wu and the other Divine Venerables and chuckled, “Sirs and Madam, what do you think?”

Fan Wu hurriedly stated, “Sir Yang is correct. The Stone Spirit Clan absolutely won’t be bothered ever again. We will warn our subordinates today that with the Stone Spirit Clan’s current territory as the centre, all the land within a radius of a hundred thousand kilometres shall eternally belong to the Stone Spirit Clan. Anyone who dares to enter without permission will be executed without mercy!”

Luan Feng and Cang Gou also nodded, making it evident that they had no objections to this decision. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Yang Kai didn’t say anything more to them. He simply glanced at Elder instead, “Elder, are you satisfied with this? If this isn’t enough, we can discuss it again. The Three Divine Venerables are all easy to talk to, so please ask them if you have any requests at all.”

Fan Wu hurriedly exclaimed, “Yes, yes. If Elder still has any requests, feel free to say them directly. We three will definitely satisfy you as long as it is within our ability to.”

Elder chuckled, “That’s enough, that’s enough. My Stone Spirit Clan has few clansmen to begin with. A radius of one hundred thousand kilometres is more than enough for us to use.”

He had a very happy expression and was evidently highly satisfied with this result. Of course, he also knew that Fan Wu was only being so generous in order to give face to Yang Kai. Otherwise, forget about a hundred thousand kilometres, even a radius of ten thousand kilometres would be difficult to ask for.

Elder really couldn’t help but exclaim in his heart. Before he came here today, he had resolved to sacrifice himself if things didn’t succeed. He never expected that there would be such a wonderful ending.

Not only did the Stone Spirit Clan have someone so powerful to rely on now, even Shi Jiu would soon become a Divine Spirit, Tai Yue.

The Stone Spirit Clan and the intimately connected Wood Spirit Clan were able to reap incredible benefits today. Being able to live without any worries was a life that Elder had wanted for so many years but never obtained before.

But now, Yang Kai had resolved everything with just a few words.
