After giving it a thought, Bai Qi realised that Yang Kai was right, so he nodded in agreement.

Following that, they moved into the lawless Star City. Not only was this place chaotic, but the buildings were also built in a haphazard fashion.

There were some people who had gotten into scuffles on the streets, and the stains of blood on the ground suggested that many lives were lost here.

As Yang Kai silently scanned his surroundings, he was horrified to learn that the cultivators moving around this damned place were mostly Open Heaven Realm Masters. There were rarely any cultivators like him who hadn’t ascended to the Open Heaven Realm.

After pondering on it for a moment though, he realised that Shattered Heaven was a truly dangerous place, so no weak cultivators were able to venture into this area. Being an Open Heaven Realm Master was probably the minimum requirement. Furthermore, most Open Heaven Realm Masters here looked destitute, which explained why they took a huge risk to look for opportunities in this dangerous place.

Yang Kai was a Half-Step Open Heaven Realm Master who was followed by Zhu Jiu Yin, Yue He, and the other strong cultivators, so this group of people looked rather conspicuous in this city.

The people who could make a living here were all cultivators with sharp vision, so they were able to easily tell that it was difficult to deal with Zhu Jiu Yin and the others; therefore, even though many people had their eyes on them, no one dared to go anywhere near them. Whenever Yang Kai and the others went, there seemed to be a pair of invisible hands that separated the onlookers.

“Some people are secretly paying attention to us,” Zhu Jiu Yin said in a small voice all of a sudden.

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “That’s expected. It’d be strange if no one is paying attention to us.”

Upon seeing a restaurant, Yang Kai led all of them inside. People from all walks of life had gathered together in the restaurant and it was quite bustling, with shop-hands running around with their backs soaked in sweat.

The shopkeeper looked grumpy and had ugly facial features, but he was truly powerful as he was a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

After getting a private room, Yang Kai’s group ordered some signature dishes before sitting down and waiting.

Soon, the dishes and bottles of wine were served. Even though they were delectable, no one started eating as Yang Kai just sat with his eyes closed, waiting.

Since he hadn’t made a move, Yue He and the others would naturally stay still. On the other hand, Bai Qi kept squirming as though he was sitting on pins and needles. It had been half a year since the Proprietress got into trouble, but they hadn’t found out her whereabouts until now, so he was expected to be apprehensive.

Just one hour later, Zhu Jiu Yin suddenly took a look at Yang Kai, who seemed to have noticed it as well and opened his eyes.

Zhu Jiu Yin said impassively, “He’s here.”

Yang Kai gently let out a breath and replied, “Good.”

Even though he had comforted Bai Qi earlier, he wasn’t confident that the mastermind would show up to see him here. His plan was that if no one showed up after a day, he could only ask Bai Qi to lead them to the place where the Proprietress got into trouble, then they’d search for her slowly.

Now, it seemed that his speculation was right.

Since he had come to Shattered Heaven as he was told, the mastermind was supposed to show up and reveal his intentions.

Next, they heard a series of footsteps as some people were coming upstairs in a calm manner. Before they even arrived, a disturbing aura started permeating the place.

Yang Kai frowned and snorted, “They’re from Myriad Demons Heaven.”

He was certain that the aura was Demon Qi as he was familiar with it.

After the Hundred Sects Alliance invaded Void Land, Yang Kai found out that Myriad Demons Heaven was the culprit behind the siege. Now, the mastermind behind the incident this time was also from that great force, so it seemed that the feud between them was bound to worsen.

A moment later, the door was pushed open from the outside. Yang Kai looked up and saw two figures stepping into the private room. As expected, they were from Myriad Demons Heaven as they were engulfed in black Demon Qi, which undulated and concealed their faces.

However, Yang Kai had a feeling that the person at the front was the same High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master who had appeared in Void Land previously. At the moment, this man was followed by another Open Heaven Realm Master, but this person’s aura suggested that he was only in the Fifth-Order.

Faced with such formidable enemies, Yue He and the others immediately rose from the chairs and stood behind Yang Kai to protect him. On the other hand, Zhu Jiu Yin remained seated in a dispassionate manner, as though she hadn’t seen the people who came in.

Even though the person at the front was covered in Demon Qi, Yang Kai could clearly sense that the other party was examining him with a pair of piercing eyes.

An unafraid Yang Kai stared back at him, but the next instant, he felt the person’s Demon Qi turning into a swirl and sucking his Soul into it.

It was totally beyond Yang Kai’s control as he felt his eyes burning all of a sudden. The Demon Eye of Annihilation on his left and the Black Purgatory Eye on his right revealed themselves. At that moment, his golden eye was bright while his black eye was pitch black.

Just then, Zhu Jiu Yin gently flicked the wine glass in front of her. Following a clang, a ripple spread around in Yang Kai’s mind like a glimmer of light that tore apart the darkness, extricating him from that strange state.

Yang Kai hurriedly looked down and closed his eyes, which felt like they were burning.

“I respect you as a guest, but if you dare to make a scene, don’t blame this Queen for becoming rude with you.” Zhu Jiu Yin gave him a warning impassively.

The High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master from Myriad Demons Heaven put on a smile and cupped his fist, “Myriad Demons Heaven, Ti Zheng, greets Senior Sister Zhu. The reason I did some probing just now was that I had some doubts, so I hope that you’ll forgive me.”

Even though he was covered in eerie Demon Qi, he was rather polite when he spoke, unlike how haughty he was in Void Land previously. It seemed he wouldn’t dare to be presumptuous in front of a Divine Spirit; after all, he had suffered a setback because of Zhu Jiu Yin back then.

Zhu Jiu Yin snorted.

Then, Ti Zheng turned to look at Yang Kai and nodded gently, “The last time we met, this Monarch was curious about why you exuded an aura that was supposed to be exclusive to Myriad Demons Heaven. Now, it seems to be the case. Demon Eye of Annihilation and Black Purgatory Eye… Haha. These two are very abstruse Eye Secret Techniques from our great force that are never taught to outsiders. Even within Myriad Demons Heaven, rarely anyone has successfully cultivated one of the two Secret Techniques, let alone mastered both. Where did you learn these Eye Secret Techniques?”

Yang Kai was slightly taken aback, but he didn’t let his emotions show on his face and simply replied, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

His two Eye Secret Techniques came from Great Demon God Mo Sheng. When Mo Sheng’s physical body was destroyed in the past, his eyes were cast into the Void and wound up far far away. As time passed, they gained their own sentience and life. One of them became the Great Demon God of Tong Xuan Realm while the other became a one-eyed giant monster.

There came an opportunity for Yang Kai as he obtained the Demon Eye of Annihilation first, followed by the Black Purgatory Eye, which was how he mastered both Eye Secret Techniques.

The moment Yang Kai found out that there was a Myriad Demons Heaven in the 3,000 Worlds, he warned himself to be cautious if he came across anyone from that great force so that his secrets wouldn’t be exposed. Those from that great force might not be aware that Mo Sheng eventually lost his life in the Star Boundary, but if he showcased the two Eye Secret Techniques from Great Demon God, it would catch the attention of those from that great force.

In fact, Yang Kai had been cautious enough as he rarely used these Eye Secret Techniques, he hadn’t expected that Ti Zheng had already noticed them when he came to Void Land previously.

Upon some probing this time, he easily found out Yang Kai’s secrets.

Both the Demon Eye of Annihilation and Black Purgatory Eye were Secret Techniques that came from Myriad Demons Heaven, so the other party’s understanding of the two Eye Secret Techniques must be far greater than Yang Kai’s. As such, he was unable to resist Ti Zheng’s inspection.

With a faint smile, Ti Zheng took a seat and said, “It’s pointless for you to deny it as the characteristics of these two Eye Secret Techniques are too conspicuous. Even though this Monarch has never cultivated them, there are a number of people in our great force who have mastered these Secret Techniques. That’s why I can easily recognise them. However, there’s something I don’t understand. You’re not a disciple from our great force, so how did you get to learn these techniques? Over the years, only a small number of the disciples from our great force have had the aptitude to learn these Secret Techniques, and they’re also the most talented people in Myriad Demons Heaven.”

After he finished speaking, the Demon Qi around him dissipated and revealed his face. As he stared fixedly at Yang Kai’s eyes, he licked his lips and said, “This Monarch is interested in your eyes. Why don’t you sell them to me? I’ll offer a reasonable price.”

Yang Kai asked impassively, “I’m interested in your head as well. Are you going to sell it to me?”

Ti Zheng grinned, “You’re pretty bold; however, even though you have these Eye Secret Techniques, you’re unable to fully activate their powers without the core Secret Art. Furthermore, you’re not a disciple from our great force. It’d be a waste if you hold onto these eyes of yours.”

“That’s none of your business.” Yang Kai shook his head.

Ti Zheng examined him and also shook his head, “What a shame. This Monarch is not going to force you since you’re not willing to sell your eyes. In any case, I’ll be fine with it if you join our great force.”

...

Yang Kai arched his brow, “Oh? Are you trying to recruit me?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Ti Zheng replied seriously, “Yes, but it’s because I don’t want the two Eye Secret Techniques from our great force to go to waste.”

A curious Yang Kai asked, “What are the benefits I will get if I join Myriad Demons Heaven?”

Ti Zheng said, “You’ll never have to worry about putting food on the table again, and all your trouble will be gone. This Monarch can give you everything you want, as long as you make a heart demon oath and start working for me from now on.”

“Everything?” Yang Kai raised his brow, “Does it include a High-Rank Yin Element treasure?”

“If you want, this Monarch can give it to you,” Ti Zheng said with a smile.

“That’s attractive, but your conditions are too harsh. I’m not used to being subservient to anyone.”

There seemed to be a look of regret on Ti Zheng’s face, “I wanted to lead you to a bright future, but you wouldn’t appreciate my kindness. Despite the fact that you have two great eyes, you’re no different from a blind man. How pitiful!”

Yang Kai snorted, “Enough nonsense. You told me to come to the Shattered Heaven, and I’m here now. Where’s my Proprietress?”

Ti Zheng asked, “Are you talking about the woman named Lan You Ruo?”

“Stop asking the obvious.”

...

“Well…” Ti Zheng smiled and fished out a jade slip before pushing it towards Yang Kai, “She’s in this place now. Do you have the guts to go there?”

Yang Kai frowned as Ti Zheng readily revealed the Proprietress’ whereabouts, so he wasn’t sure if he should believe him.

Then, he gave Zhu Jiu Yin a signal with his eyes, whereupon the woman picked up the jade slip and examined it. Then, she nodded at Yang Kai to mean that there was nothing wrong with it.
