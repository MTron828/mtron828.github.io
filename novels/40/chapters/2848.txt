Shaman Niu had no idea about the relationship between Yue, Lu, and Sir Shaman King, but the Guard Captain knew of it.

War was coming, how was it safer to entrust Yue and Lu to a Shaman Grandmaster than keeping them beside a Shaman King?

Shaman Dang replied indifferently, “They only have hope to live by following him.”

The Guard Captain frowned slightly and obviously did not agree with him, but he did not dare to express it in front of the Shaman King, so he decided to be silent.

Outside King City, Yang Kai was leading the twins to his camp when he turned back and asked, “Which one of you is Yue? And which one is Lu?”

The two girls stopped, and the one on the left answered, “I’m Yue.”

The one on the right continued, “I’m Lu.”

Yang Kai grinned and nodded, “Noted. Good, Sir Shaman King mentioned that both of you have cultivated in the Shaman Divine Temple since young. Is it fun over there?”

The twins frowned, and Yue replied in a deep voice, “The Shaman Divine Temple is the most important place for all Barbarian Clans. Only the most outstanding Shamans are qualified to enter it and serve the Shaman God. It’s not a place for fun.”

Lu pressed on, “Mind your words, Sir.”

Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders and roughly learnt the characters of these two young Shaman Masters. As such, he stopped talking and continued to lead the way.

A short time later, the trio returned to Yang Kai’s camp, where a group of Barbarian Warriors and Shamans who were training were surprised to see him bringing back a pair of beautiful twins after his trip.

Yang Kai clapped his hands to attract everyone’s attention, then announced loudly, “These two Shaman Masters are Yue and Lu. They were specially sent to our Shaman Niu Clan by Sir Shaman King. Now that you all know them, I hope that you all can live with each other peacefully and work together to resist the Demon Race in the future!”

Everyone accepted in unison while a group of wilder men looked at the twins with intoxicated eyes. If it were not for the noble status of Yue and Lu, some would even be tempted to flirt with them.

The Shaman Apprentices and Shaman Warriors came forward and greeted the two Shaman Masters with respect.

Yue and Lu just nodded lightly as they swept their eyes across the people of the Shaman Niu Clan to examine them.

“Continue your training.” Yang Kai waved his hand to the crowd, then spoke to the twins, “You two, join them. The Shaman Divine Temple only taught you to cultivate Shamanic Spells, but I think they never taught you how to unleash your potential in battle, right? Get familiar with it in these few days, so that you won’t panic when the fighting begins.”

The twins nodded.

After that, Yang Kai whistled loudly and in the next moment, the Eagle King that was on the ground received his order and raised its head to let out a screech.

The Giant Eagles of the Aerial Cavalry that were soaring in the sky responded one after another, and soon carried many archers back and landed on the ground.

Many faces of the archers looked pale and as they rolled down from the Giant Eagles’ backs, some ran to the side to vomit. Some of them even lost their balance and fell flat on their butts.

“Sir, what can I do for you?” Ah Hua came over bravely with a longbow hung over her back. Although her face was slightly pale, she was obviously much better than the others. At least, her footsteps were more stable than everyone else.

Yang Kai announced in a deep voice, “I just received an order from Sir Shaman King that I am to turn over twenty-five Giant Eagles to King City.”

Ah Hua was taken aback when she heard it, “Twenty-five Giant Eagles? Doesn’t that mean…”

Originally, each of the seventy-five Giant Eagles was assigned an archer, so if twenty-five Giant Eagles had to be given away, that meant twenty-five archers would be removed from the Aerial Cavalry, which was unbearable for any archer.

These archers were the elites of the Shaman Niu Clan. They were the elite who were selected through various trials and were all almost equally proficient in their craft.

“Which is why I will give you a day. After a day, the twenty-five archers who have the worst performance will have to return to the ground force, understand?”

Ah Hua pondered for a while, then nodded, “Understood.”

Yang Kai waved his hand, “Go, I’ll leave it to you.”

“Yes!” Ah Hua turned around in a complicated mood. As soon as she looked up, seventy-five pairs of eyes, full of fighting spirit, looked at her. Needless to say, everyone had clearly heard Yang Kai’s announcement, so if they wanted to keep their Giant Eagle, they had to perform better than the others today.

Not long after, the seventy-five Giant Eagles took to the sky again, creating a spectacular scene.

Yang Kai returned to his wooden house, swallowed a Monster Beast Core, and started to cultivate.

A day later, Ah Hua came to report the situation of the Aerial Cavalry. After Yang Kai’s approval, she demoted twenty-five of the weaker archers and sent the spare Giant Eagles to King City.

The following days were uneventful. The twelve units of Shaman Niu Clan trained in an orderly manner, and over time, they had gotten more and more used to working with each other.

With the addition of Yue and Lu, the Shamanic Spells that were cast by the Shamans of Shaman Niu Clan were enough to cover all three thousand people, which had not been done before.

Previously, they needed the help of Yang Kai or Tiea to achieve this feat, but with Yue and Lu, Yang Kai and Tiea did not need to intervene at all.

The Shamans discovered the strength of the twins, Yue and Lu, as they interacted with them more, and all of them were impressed by these two Shaman Masters who came from the Shaman Divine Temple. The Shamanic Spells the twins had mastered, their understanding of Shamanic Spells, and the speed with which they executed their spells were all incomparable to ordinary Shamans.

Under their guidance, the Shaman Warriors and Shaman Apprentices made rapid progress.

Although the twins had indifferent personalities, they were not cold. In fact, if the Shamans took the initiative to approach them, the twins were quite easy to interact with. Therefore, the Shaman Warriors and Shaman Apprentices had become familiar with them after a few days. They would approach them if they had any questions to ask, and the twins would teach them in detail without reservations.

A few days later, the two Shaman Masters gained great prestige in the Shaman Niu Clan.

Yang Kai was so free that he just hid in the wooden house all day and cultivated.

The benefits that a Ninth-Order Monster Core could bring him were not substantial anymore. Therefore, Yang Kai began to consume Tenth-Order Monster Cores.

In just three days, he had broken through a Minor Realm from Low-Rank to Mid-Rank Shaman Grandmaster Realm.

On this day, the peace was finally broken.

When the dull horn sounded in King City, all the busy Barbarians quieted down. Hundreds of thousands of eyes focused on King City, and everyone could sense a storm was approaching.

Many rose to the sky and rushed to King City one after another.

Soon, the Shaman Grandmasters arrived at the palace where they gathered previously.

The number of Shaman Grandmasters this time was fifty percent higher than last; after all, many of them had been on the road to King City previously. But now, all the Shaman Grandmasters in the whole South Barbarian Clan had gathered here.

Basically, all the elites of every village were present now.

When they arrived, they did not see Shaman Dang in the main hall, and naturally whispered in groups to discuss the development of the war. However, everyone was busy training their subordinates outside the King City recently, so no one had any relevant news and they had no idea what was happening outside. Therefore, their discussion was in vain too, and they could only wait for Shaman Dang to explain.

A moment later, Shaman Dang came out with a grim face.

The buzzing of the crowd ceased at once, and all eyes fixed on Shaman Dang. Seeing the Shaman King’s expression, many immediately had an ominous premonition.

Sure enough, Shaman Dang announced shocking news, “The Shaman Saints ventured deep into the territory occupied by the Demon Race a few days ago and fought a battle with their leaders. All of them managed to return after that battle, but three of the Sirs were seriously injured and have fallen into a deep slumber. Only Sir Xiong remains awake, but he won’t be able to fight again anytime soon.”

After listening to the news, everyone was petrified with their jaws dropped, as if their mouths had been stuffed with an invisible fist and could not close, shocked beyond words.

It was reasonable for them to react like this though as in an era without a Shaman God, Shaman Saints were the strongest Masters.

There were only four Shaman Saints in the entire Ancient Barbarian Race. A few days ago, when Shaman Dang revealed that all four Shaman Saints had made a move, many still had a glimmer of hope that these four Masters could drive out the Demon Race.

But after hearing the shocking news today, everyone understood that the Demon Race… Was strong.

Despite the combined force of four Shaman Saints, three of them were seriously injured and fell into an unconscious state to recover, while only one remained awake but was also powerless to fight. Given the outcome of the four Shaman Saints, it was obvious that the Demon Race did not lack existences on par with Shaman Saints.

If even the Shaman Saints were no match for them, what could they do even if they had greater numbers? In that instant, the colour was drained from their faces.

Shaman Dang looked around and continued in a loud voice, “But the efforts of the Shaman Saints were not in vain. According to the information provided by Sir Xiong, the strongest Masters of the Demon Race are also either dead or seriously injured. So, we were not the only ones who suffered this time.”

Hearing what he said, everyone immediately let out a sigh of relief. This was the result that they were looking forward to given that the four Shaman Saints had already taken action personally.

“The Shaman Saints need to rest and recuperate while the same is true of the Masters of the Demon Race. At this critical moment, the final outcome of the war will be decided by our hands. If we can take this opportunity to kill all the other Demons, we can protect our Barbarian Race! But if we fail, the world will sink into the abyss. Therefore, we have only one choice – to fight to the death!”

“Fight to the death!”

“Fight to the death!”

In the hall, the Shaman Grandmasters shouted together, their blood boiling in excitement.

Shaman Dang was satisfied with their reaction and pressed his hand down to calm them, “The efforts of the Shaman Saints have slowed the invasion of the Demon Race. Now, they seem to be building a defence line based on the four territories that they had conquered. Our task is to retake these four territories while eliminating all their footholds.”

“Sir, what exactly is our plan?” Someone asked. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Shaman Dang answered, “Take a look at this.”

While speaking, he waved his large hand and as his Shaman Strength fluctuated, a huge map was condensed above the hall. On the map, there was a large blood shaded area, which everyone frowned at.

This area was clearly the four territories that were occupied by the Demons.
