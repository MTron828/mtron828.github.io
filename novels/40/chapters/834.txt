Chapter 835, Breakthrough, Third Order Transcendent

In the depths of Dragon Valley, Yang Kai stood silently amidst a sea of World Energy, as if the two had somehow become one, an experience Yang Kai had never had before.

The power within his body rapidly increased and soon reached its peak level, but there was no sign of it stopping and it continued to soar, breaking through all boundaries and limits.

Yang Kai clearly knew he was on the verge of a breakthrough.

It had been several years since his last breakthrough, and while waiting for the Golden Dragon to finish swallowing the golden energy ocean, Yang Kai had not slacked on his own cultivation and had also obtained many insights while studying Alchemy.

It could be said that breaking through right now was completely natural and that he wouldn’t encounter any bottlenecks.

The storm of World Energy around Yang Kai tempered his already solid physique and True Qi. His flesh and blood pulsed with unimaginable power.

Yang Kai was ecstatic.

Lowering his guard and opening his stance, Yang Kai completely immersed himself in this intense World Energy baptism.

Most cultivators would use their True Qi or artifacts to protect themselves during a breakthrough so as not to be hurt by the rampaging World Energy that gathered around them during the process.

Although this approach was much safer, the benefits one could obtain were reduced correspondingly.

Yang Kai did the complete opposite of this, using his tyrannical physique to directly withstand this external bombardment, tempering his flesh and blood to the extreme, forming a never ending cycle of benefits. This was why every cultivator paid special attention to their foundation, the firmer it was, the more benefits they could obtain and the greater the height they could reach in the future.

Yang Kai’s foundation was incredibly solid.

Shooting a glance over at Sun Yu, who was guarded by Grand Heavenly Shields and the Silver Leaf artifact, Yang Kai confirmed the youth was unaffected and put down the last of his worries.

A wave of World Energy fell from the sky like a bolt of lightning, bringing with it an overwhelming pressure and momentum, causing everyone from Dragon Phoenix Palace standing at the mouth of Dragon Valley to change complexion in shock.

Seeing such a powerful destructive force, none of them could guarantee that Sun Yu would be able to return safely.

Chen Zhou and Ling Jian were both anxious like ants on a hot wok, wanting to immediately rush to the depths of the valley to have a closer look but simultaneously worried they would disturb Sun Yu if they did so, causing them no small amount of grief.

At this time, Xiao Ling, who had left to arrange the blockade of the Sect, sent word that the nearby Frozen Nether Cave Heaven had indeed been alarmed by this situation and that enemy masters, under the leadership of two First Order Saints, were now heading towards Dragon Valley.

Chen Zhou’s face went cold and a sharp light flashed across the depths of his eyes.

Ever since Dragon Phoenix Palace had begun to decline, Frozen Nether Cave Heaven had begun to rise. There was an obvious friction between the two forces, but with each of them possessing Saint Realm masters, despite constant small skirmishes breaking out, no major conflict had yet to erupt.

Everyone knew that once a major battle took place, neither side would be able to emerge unscathed.

Although Dragon Phoenix Palace only had one Saint Realm master, Chen Zhou, if it became a life of death fight, Frozen Nether Cave Heaven would no doubt sustain unacceptable amounts of damage.

Frozen Nether Cave Heaven suddenly mobilizing all its forces at this time was no surprise to Chen Zhou.

“Elder Ling, I leave all matters here in your hands. If Sun Yu can return safely... Take him away from Dragon Phoenix Palace and tell him that the revitalization of our Sect will depend on him.”

“Palace Master!” Ling Jian’s face paled when he realized what Chen Zhou wanted to do.

“Xiao Ling, Ting Yi, come meet the enemy with me! I’d like to see what kind of ability they think they possess to so brazenly invade my Dragon Phoenix Palace!” Chen Zhou shouted before soaring off.

Xiao Ling and Yu Ting Yi also rushed to keep up. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

At the mouth of the mountain valley now, only Ling Jian remained.

Staring towards the depths of the valley, Ling Jian only grew more anxious, muttering under his breath, “Smelly brat, still unwilling to come out? You really know how to torture this old master’s heart.”

Deep in the depths of Dragon Valley, World Energy continued pouring down from the Heavens towards Yang Kai who openly accepted every last bit of it, his face filled with excitement.

This situation lasted for an hour or so before the swirling World Energy began to thin out and the terrifying aura that engulfed Dragon Valley gradually subsided.

An invisible wave of pressure centered on Yang Kai suddenly spread around.

At this moment, Yang Kai’s body felt incredibly light and a joyous sensation spread across every inch of his body. Clenching his fists silently, Yang Kai could feel just how much his strength had increased.

Spreading out his Divine Sense, Yang Kai found the range and clarity of his perception had also grown substantially.

Third Order Transcendent Realm!

Just one step away from the Saint Realm.

Several dozen kilometers away, Yang Kai sensed some people were fighting, and it was an intense battle at that. There were even three Saints involved, causing Yang Kai to frown slightly, not knowing what was going on.

Yang Kai took his attention back and began examining the changes in his body.

The Golden Dragon tattoo had returned to his back but was now far more lifelike and was actually constantly swimming across his skin, appearing quite strange to the outside observer.

Also, at this moment, the Golden Dragon tattoo seemed to contain a massive amount of energy that caused even Yang Kai to feel somewhat nervous.

It gave off a profound and majestic aura that was familiar to Yang Kai.

Monster Qi!

Having coming in contact with members of the Monster Race and talked directly to a Monster Race Great Senior, Yang Kai was very familiar with Monster Qi and at this moment the energy radiating from his Golden Dragon tattoo actually contained traces of Monster Yuan Qi.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai understood.

The inheritance hidden here was the real Dragon Emperor’s inheritance!

What he and Su Yan received back in the Inheritance Heaven’s Cave was just a primer, only after coming here and obtaining the hidden energy could they become the true Dragon Emperor and Phoenix Empress.

Yang Kai didn’t know why he suddenly understood all this, but he figured it had something to do with acquiring the true inheritance.

After carefully examining himself, Yang Kai felt extremely satisfied.

Taking out a set of clothes from the Black Book space and donning the, Yang Kai removed the protective layers around Sun Yu.

The Grand Heavenly Shields shattered and the Silver Leaf artifact was retrieved by him.

Sun Yu still appeared somewhat shaken by what had just happened but after seeing Yang Kai, he quickly cupped his fists, “Many thanks for rescuing me, Senior!”

He was well aware that if Yang Kai had not protected him at the critical moment, he would have long since departed for the next world. Even if he cultivated diligently for a few dozen years he might not be able to resist such a shocking display of power.

“A minor matter,” Yang Kai smiled faintly before turning his gaze towards the mouth of the valley, casually saying “There is a cultivator with a First Order Transcendent cultivation outside who seems to be waiting for you.”

“First Order Transcendent?” Sun Yu was surprised before immediately saying excitedly, “It must be Master. Oh no, we’ve been trapped here for so many days, Master has certainly become impatient waiting for me. Senior, do you know how long we’ve been staying here?”

“Probably about two years,” Yang Kai replied off-handedly.

“So long?” Sun Yu was dumbstruck; shocked that a whole two years had passed by, he had simply not felt the passage of time at all; following beside Yang Kai and reaping such enormous benefits had apparently diluted this feeling.

“Don’t be in such a rush,” Yang Kai smiled as he looked at the youth, “Do you remember the agreement between us?”

Sun Yu nodded solemnly, “I remember. To me, Senior is an honoured teacher, I will certainly not reveal your existence.”

“Very good.”

“But... if Palace Master and the other elders ask about the Dragon Emperor’s inheritance, how should I answer them?”

Yang Kai’s brow furrowed, feeling like there wasn’t really a good answer to this question. Although he had been training Sun Yu for a while, and the youth’s aptitude had undergone earth-shaking changes, allowing him to one day certainly have some achievements. The matter about the Dragon Emperor’s inheritance really wasn’t so easy to explain away, “Let’s put this aside for the moment, your Dragon Phoenix Palace’s masters are fighting with another group of people right now, and they seem to be at a disadvantage.”

“Engaged in battle?” Sun Yu frowned, releasing his Divine Sense but unable to perceive anything.

His cultivation realm wasn’t high enough so he could only perceive things within a few kilometers of himself, but after a little contemplation, he concluded, “It must be the people from Frozen Nether Cave Heaven. Hateful! That group of bastards must have detected the movement from this place and decided to launch a full scale invasion of my Dragon Phoenix Palace.”

“Is there some kind of grudge between your two forces?” Yang Kai asked curiously.

Sun Yu shook his head, “It’s just them looking for trouble. Their Sect specializes in Ice Attribute Secret Arts and Martial Skills and my Dragon Phoenix Palace just happens to have something they greatly covet.”

Yang Kai frowned and suddenly understood, “The inheritance inside the Phoenix Nest?”

“Indeed,” Sun Yu nodded, “Since the Dragon Emperor’s inheritance has reappeared, the new Dragon Emperor will definitely need to find a favourable woman to inherit the Phoenix Empresses’ inheritance. That’s Frozen Nether Cave Heaven’s goal, once they succeed, perhaps they’ll completely annex our Dragon Phoenix Palace.”

Yang Kai let out a somewhat creepy laugh as he stared at the youth.

“Why are you laughing like that, Senior?” Sun Yu was confused.

“Looks like you’re in trouble,” Yang Kai said, clearly taking pleasure in the boy’s misfortune.

Sun Yu thought about it for a moment before his expression turned bitter, suddenly understanding. The leadership of Dragon Phoenix Palace currently thought he was the one who triggered the formation and received the Dragon Emperor’s inheritance and even if they had tightly controlled this information, it was likely Frozen Nether Cave Heaven had learned about his identity. The purpose of Frozen Nether Cave Heaven’s invasion this time was obviously Sun Yu.

Clearly they intended to capture him and force him to choose a woman from Frozen Nether Cave Heaven to become the new Phoenix Empress and obtain the inheritance from the Phoenix Nest.

“Senior...” Sun Yu’s face filled with unease as he stared over at Yang Kai, silently praying for rescue.

“Don’t worry, since I was the one who created this issue in the first place, I’ll help you handle it. This is also an opportunity to let your Dragon Phoenix Palace’s leaders confirm that you obtained the Dragon Emperor’s inheritance.”

Sun Yu breathed a sigh of relief, “Many thanks, Senior.”

“No problem!” Yang Kai smiled faintly, “You exit the valley, I’ll protect you from the shadows. Act bold and courageously.”

“Yes!” Having received this assurance from Yang Kai, Sun Yu felt greatly relieved and hurriedly rushed towards the mouth of the valley, as if he believed that with Senior Yang’s astonishing methods, repelling Frozen Nether Cave Heaven would be a simple task.

After Sun Yu left, Yang Kai turned his gaze in the direction of the nearby battle, his eyes flashing a gloomy light.

The inheritance hidden inside the Phoenix Nest belonged to Su Yan, yet this Frozen Nether Cave Heaven was actually looking to steal it, they must really be tired of living!

If not for this reason, Yang Kai would be unwilling to intervene in other forces’ disputes.

However, Dragon Phoenix Palace had a great many subtle connections with him so him taking action this time was simply like returning the favour for him obtaining the Dragon Emperor’s inheritance.

Silavin: I don’t think this title is a spoiler since the majority of you aren’t idiots and would know what would happen from the previous chapter.

Do give me feedback on this one. The decision is kinda a grey zone for me.
