Chen Tian Fei and the others, who were hiding, all wore tense expressions. Bei Yu Shan even nervously gulped. Although he wasn’t very sharp, his instincts towards danger were like that of a wild beast. When Yang Kai looked at them just now, Bei Yu Shan felt as if he had encountered an overwhelming opponent and was about to die.

The fat on Chen Tian Fei’s face twitched as he muttered, “Is it a coincidence, or has he already discovered us?”

The Ou Yang Brothers’ faces sank, not daring to make a sound for fear of leaking their presence.

Fortunately, Yang Kai only glanced over briefly before turning his attention back to the unfamiliar faces and the one he was holding as he quipped, “Isn’t it a bit too late to call me Sixth Manager now?”

With a shake of his hand, the man let out a blood-curdling scream before exploding into a cloud of blood mist. The cultivators who were rushing into the mansion just now all instantly wore looks of horror.

No one had expected Yang Kai to be so ruthless and kill without hesitation. It had to be known that there were many of them, so Yang Kai’s actions would undoubtedly lead to great unrest.

But looking at Yang Kai’s contemptuous expression, it seemed he didn’t care at all.

For a time, many people’s hearts were in turmoil. Under the imprisonment of Space Principles, they could feel Yang Kai’s terrifying strength. One of Scarlet Star’s disciples shouted in horror, “This humble subordinate deserves death! Sixth Manager, please spare my life!”

“Since you deserve to die, then just die!” Yang Kai shouted in a low voice before he waved his arm in a wide arc. As he did, a giant Moon Blade appeared and flew out.

The Moon Blade silently cut through everything in its path as blood and severed limbs flew everywhere. In an instant, the mansion was transformed into a bloody purgatory.

The cultivators rushing into the mansion fell like wheat in a field. None of them were able to resist the Moon Blade’s terrifying power and were cut down without exception.

Those with tenacious vitality didn’t die instantly. Dragging their mutilated bodies and crawling out of the place while struggling for their last breath and howling in pain, they left behind a long trail of blood wherever they went. It was a shocking sight.

With just one strike, more than a hundred people had been killed!

In the void, the eyes of Chen Tian Fei and the others who had concealed themselves twitched violently as their scalps went numb.

Even Yue He, who was standing behind Yang Kai, couldn’t help but cover her red lips as she stared at the figure she thought she was familiar with but now understood was still a stranger.

This person was indeed very different from that person. That man was always as warm as jade, gentle as the wind, but this person in front of her could kill without batting an eye.

“How dare this brat act like this!” An old cultivator pointed at Yang Kai angrily.

They had only rushed into Yang Kai’s mansion in order to force him out of Star City so that the outsiders wouldn’t get dragged into his grievances with Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light. They hadn’t harmed a single blade of grass or tree here, but Yang Kai had directly killed over a hundred people. Such methods were simply too brutal!

Yang Kai looked over coldly, “What right do you have to judge this King? Scram!”

With a wave of his sleeve, he sent the older man flying, causing him to explode into a bloody mist.

Since these people dared to break through his mansion’s protective Array and trespass into his home, they had to pay the price for their actions.

“Madman, this guy is a madman! Run!”

Someone shouted loudly and turned around to flee, while the rest of the group also gathered their strength and fled in all directions.

Yang Kai came out of seclusion in a fit of anger and killed more than a hundred people in one blow. His anger had mostly subsided now, so when he saw these people fleeing in all directions, he didn’t make any more trouble and simply let them escape.

Turning his head, he looked towards Zhong Fan and the others with a disdainful smile.

Zhong Fan shouted, “Yang Kai, dozens of my Sword Pavilion’s disciples have died because of you. Today, this King will definitely kill you and avenge my Sword Pavilion’s disciples. Quickly come out and accept your death!”

Zhu Li also took a step forward and added, grinding his teeth, “If you come out and accept your death right this instant, we can make it quick and painless; refuse, and we’ll make you taste the cruelest torture the world has to offer until you beg us to kill you!”

Facing their provocations, Yang Kai just turned a deaf ear and indifferently smiled, “If you have the ability, then fight your way in!”

With these words, the entire Star City went into an uproar!

This was something that all the cultivators present were worried about. If it weren’t for the fear of being implicated, why would those people from before have attacked Yang Kai’s mansion and tried to capture him?

But now, what they were afraid of had come to pass. Yang Kai was acting openly belligerent, so how could his enemies endure? Many people were worried that Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light would really attack the Star City in anger. At that time, they would definitely suffer and complain to Scarlet Star ‘why didn’t they deactivate the Grand Array so Zhong Fan and the others could rush in and kill Yang Kai?’

“That Yang guy must be scared, he’s really despicable and shameless.”

“I’m afraid that’s only natural. With so many people from Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light here, no matter how strong he is, he won’t be able to defeat them.”

“What’s the point of being afraid now? Why didn’t he think about the consequences when he provoked Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light on Yuan Magnetic Mountain?”

“That bastard is dead for sure. Even if the Star City has a Grand Array, it won’t be able to protect him.”

“Can’t Manager Chen and the others just throw him out?”

…..

In the Star City, it quickly became quite noisy.

Listening to these whispers, Chen Tian Fei and the others all wore bitter looks on their faces. If they could throw Yang Kai out, why would they have waited until now? They would have attacked long ago, but on that day, Yang Kai killed Du Niang Zi and Gan Hong in the main hall crisply and cleanly. They knew they weren’t Yang Kai’s match in a one-on-one fight, and even if they attacked together, Yang Kai still had Yue He by his side. So why would they go and pull the tiger’s whiskers unless they had to?

Luo Qing Yun sneered and mocked, “Yang Kai, I’ve misjudged you. I thought you were a responsible man, but now it seems you’re nothing more than this!”

Yang Kai sneered and countered, “What right do you have to comment on whether this King is responsible or not?”

Saying so, he couldn’t be bothered with these people and turned around to walk towards his cultivation room.

Since Chen Tian Fei and the others had chosen to give up on him, there was no need for Yang Kai to be considerate of Scarlet Star. With his mastery over the Dao of Space, he could leave if he wanted to. No one could stop him.

“Junior, there’s no need to hurry. Take a look at this before you go,” Zhong Fan suddenly shouted.

Yang Kai stopped and looked over.

Zhong Fan waved his hand, “Bring it!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the formation of several thousand people split to the sides, revealing a passage in the middle. Immediately after, several dozen people flew over from behind, carrying some kind of giant creature with them.

After seeing what they were carrying, Yue He couldn’t help but cover her red lips with her hand, her beautiful eyes filled with surprise as she quickly turned her head towards Yang Kai.

When he saw what they brought, Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed slightly as his face sank and a faint murderous intent swirled around him.

The creature being carried was none other than the Scarlet Flood Dragon Yang Kai had left on the Yuan Magnetic Mountain!

The Scarlet Flood Dragon must have experienced a difficult battle. Its entire body was covered in wounds, and blood was constantly dripping from its wounds. Countless scales had fallen off its body, revealing large chunks of flesh and blood. It looked extremely miserable, and its aura was extremely weak, as if it could die at any moment.

The most serious injury was the one just below its head, where a massive wound that had Sword Qi lingering around it sat. Obviously, it had been injured by the Sword Qi and had almost been beheaded.

Although the Scarlet Flood Dragon’s strength wasn’t ordinary, it was still just an Ominous Beast, and its intelligence wasn’t too high. If many people were to coordinate and attack it together, it might not be able to defeat them.

The Scarlet Flood Dragon had been captured and its entire body was covered in restrictions, completely trapping it in place. It was unable to even struggle.

This was an Ominous Beast that Yang Kai had left behind in the Yuan Magnetic Mountain. When he left the Yuan Magnetic Mountain, he hadn’t found what he was looking for, so he didn’t want to just give up and tasked Guo Zi Yan and the others to stay there and message him right away if a High-Order Yuan Magnetic Divine Stone appeared. He even left behind the Scarlet Flood Dragon and Earth Dragon to assist them.

During this time, as Yang Kai hadn’t received any messages from Guo Zi Yan and he had been in seclusion, comprehending his Elements, he had simply let matters drift. Yang Kai had never thought the situation would develop into this mess now.

With the Scarlet Flood Dragon there, the Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light members must have gone to the Yuan Magnetic Mountain first, thinking that Yang Kai was still there.

[What about the Earth Dragon? What about Guo Zi Yan?]

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense spread out like a tide, and in the next moment, the killing intent on his body became even stronger.

He didn’t sense the aura of the Earth Dragon, making it unclear if it had died or fled, but he did sense Guo Zi Yan’s aura.

Immediately after the Scarlet Flood Dragon was brought forth, another group of people was escorted up, led by Guo Zi Yan and several dozen Scarlet Star disciples.

However, only half of the Scarlet Star disciples that had remained on Yuan Magnetic Mountain were here. Presumably, the rest of them had been killed.

Guo Zi Yan and the others weren’t restricted by chains created from a Secret Technique, but it was obvious that they were all under some kind of seal. All of their auras were weak, as if they had never cultivated before, and couldn’t use any of their strength.

“Boy, are these your subordinates and beast?” Zhong Fan looked at Yang Kai indifferently, “Don’t you care about their lives?”

Yang Kai’s eyes swept over Guo Zi Yan and the others one by one, making sure they weren’t in mortal danger. Fortunately, only the Scarlet Flood Dragon’s injuries were slightly worse. After checking everyone, he asked in a cold voice, “What are you going to do? I’m no longer a member of Scarlet Star, they’re Scarlet Star disciples. Do you want to use them to threaten me? You’re too naive.”

Zhong Fan replied, “If it comes down to a choice, you can abandon your subordinates and beast, so this Old Master naturally won’t use their lives to threaten you. This Old Master simply wants you to watch a good show!”

“What show?”

“A killing show!” As Zhong Fan spoke, he waved his hand, and a captured disciple was caught in his palm. Sword Qi burst out from his palm, instantly reducing that person to a bloody mist, and causing blood to rain down. Zhong Fan shouted angrily, “Sword Pavilion must not be humiliated, those who insult my Sword Pavilion must be killed without mercy!”

These words seemed to be a declaration, causing the entire Star City to tremble. Even Chen Tian Fei and the others who had concealed themselves wore solemn expressions.

Once Zhong Fan spoke, he reached out and grabbed another Scarlet Star disciple.

Just as he was about to use the same trick again, his eyes suddenly narrowed because, in that instant, he had lost sight of Yang Kai!

Even with Zhong Fan’s ability, he was unable to discover how he had disappeared.

Little did they know, a small gap in the Grand Array had been split open at that moment.
