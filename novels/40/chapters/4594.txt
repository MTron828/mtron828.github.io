[So that was how it is! I have actually neglected my greatest reliance, my greatest foundation!]

“The World lives!” Yang Kai lowered his head and mumbled to himself in a low voice. The next moment, he shouted as his long hair fell over his forehead, “You want the Star Boundary, but have you asked the Star Boundary’s Will?”

Sitting in the main hall of the Heavenly Sword Palace, Zuo Quan Hui scoffed, “When this Monarch occupies that place, this Monarch will become its Will!”

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, “Then I’m afraid I’ll have to disappoint you!”

Zuo Quan Hui’s face sank as he suddenly had a bad feeling. It was inexplicable, as if something terrible was about to happen.

Yang Kai grabbed his spear with one hand and suddenly formed a series of hand seals with the other, muttering in a low voice, “Heavens and Earth, lend me your strength!”

*Weng…*

The void trembled at that moment as everything came to a halt.

In the next moment, the World Tree, which had reached the height of 100,000 meters, began to sway violently. Its giant canopy rustled as a beam of green light shot out from the Star Boundary and struck Yang Kai.

Yang Kai remained still, but his aura, which had become incredibly weak due to over-exhaustion, started rapidly rising, soaring upwards seemingly without limit! His turbulent Small Universe calmed, reaching a state of tranquility that he had never felt before. Furthermore, his Small Universe’s foundation was also rapidly strengthening.

A terrifying pressure erupted from Yang Kai, spreading out in all directions, causing space itself to tremble.

The Open Heaven Realm Masters of Heavenly Sword Union inside the Heavenly Sword Palace were dumbstruck at the sight of this. In the void, 1,000 Open Heaven Realm Masters of Void Land also wore looks of amazement.

Yang Kai’s aura rapidly reached a peak, one far higher than his original. Although he had yet to reach the Seventh-Order, he was just a hair breadth away from it now.

The corner of Zuo Quan Hui’s eyes twitched as he stared at this scene in disbelief.

“Borrowing the World’s Strength, so that’s how it is!” Zhan Wu Hen’s eyes flickered with realization. The Great Emperors also quickly understood what just happened.

Yang Kai was borrowing the power of the Star Boundary! Any Great Emperor who was recognized by the Will of his Universe World could borrow its strength, but this time, Yang Kai was borrowing power far beyond their imagination!

In general, there was a vast difference between the Emperor Realm and the Open Heaven Realm. Any Open Heaven Realm Master, even of the lowest Order, could easily kill an Emperor Realm cultivator.

But at certain times, in certain special circumstances, an Emperor Realm cultivator could display the strength comparable to a Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master!

Just like how the Great Emperors had fought against Great Demon God in the past!

Great Demon God definitely had the strength of the Open Heaven Realm at that time, but in the end, he was killed by the combined forces of the Star Boundary’s Great Emperors. The fundamental reason for this was because the Great Emperors had borrowed the World Strength of the Star Boundary to display enough power to kill Great Demon God.

Back then, when the Star Boundary had been nearly destroyed and the people had fallen into misery, the Great Emperors still had the strength to fight against Great Demon God by taking advantage of the Star Boundary’s remaining strength. Now that the Star Boundary had received the World Tree’s nourishment, and its foundation had become many times stronger, the World Strength Yang Kai could borrow from it was naturally far greater than before.

At this moment, it was as if he had the support of the entire Star Boundary’s World Force.

Zuo Quan Hui was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master with rich experience, so it wasn’t that he didn’t know about the secrets of Universe Worlds and Great Emperors, but under normal circumstances, how much strength could a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master like Yang Kai borrow from a mere Universe World?

It was a little better than nothing, that’s all!

However, the situation in the Star Boundary was completely different from that of ordinary Universe Worlds. Its foundation was extremely rich due to the World Tree’s feedback. Furthermore, the World Tree had also absorbed the World Force of all the Open Heaven Realm Masters from both sides who had lost their lives in this battle, allowing its heritage to become even stronger.

The World was alive. When Yang Kai was giving his all to defend the Star Boundary, even willing to put his life on the line to protect it from danger, the Star Boundary itself had sensed it. The feeling lingering in Yang Kai’s heart was a sign of acknowledgement from the Star Boundary Will.

Yang Kai understood a bit too late, but he still managed to deduce it in time.

“Zuo Quan Hui, you made your biggest mistake by making things difficult for my Star Boundary in this Great Territory!” Yang Kai’s World Force surged as he felt an indescribable power coursing through his body. Borrowing the power of the Star Boundary, not only had he recovered, but his strength was also only a step away from the Seventh-Order.

“You’re still only a Sixth-Order ant, how dare you boast so shamelessly!? When you have broken through to the Seventh-Order, then you can act presumptuously before this Monarch!” Zuo Quan Hui was extremely angry. As he finished speaking, sword waves once again shot out from the Heavenly Sword Palace. Furthermore, he had also launched a Divine Ability personally at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai promptly raised his spear to block the incoming assault. Although he was forced back tens of thousands of kilometers again, he was no longer incapable of resisting.

The gap between him and Zuo Quan Hui had been greatly reduced.

This scene was witnessed by everyone present. Void Land’s morale immediately soared as they all took action to block the Heavenly Sword Palace’s attack.

The Great Emperors glanced at each other but didn’t say anything. Nonetheless, all of them could tell what the other was thinking.

“Yang Boy, I’ll leave this place to you!” Iron Blood Great Emperor suddenly shouted.

Yang Kai turned his head in surprise and saw Iron Blood Great Emperor’s figure instantly disappear from his spot. When he looked back at the others, he saw that Bustling World, Martial Beast, Serene Soul, Flower Shadow, Ice Feather, and the other Great Emperors were also nodding at him expectantly.

Yang Kai instantly understood and shouted, “Everyone, don’t worry, I’ll definitely kill this old dog at our doorstep!”

The next moment, several figures suddenly appeared atop the World Tree’s crown in the Star Boundary. They were none other than the Great Emperors who had disappeared from the battlefield.

They had never cultivated the Dao of Space, so under normal circumstances, it would be impossible for them to travel millions of kilometers in an instant, but the Star Boundary was their homeland, and since Yang Kai was able to return from the Territory Gate with the help of the Star Boundary, it was naturally possible for them to do something similar. Traversing a few million kilometers was as easy as stepping through their front door for them.

They were old friends who had known each other for over 10,000 years, so with just a glance at each other, all of them smiled and sat down cross-legged, opened their Small Universes, and poured their World Force into the Star Boundary.

The six Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters’ assistance caused the entire Star Boundary to tremble slightly, as if it was welcoming their return.

In the void, Yang Kai’s aura that was slowly stabilizing suddenly shot up again. Naturally, this was due to the support of the Great Emperors, carrying with it the hope of countless living beings in the Star Boundary.

Nonetheless, Yang Kai was still unable to break through the shackles of the Sixth-Order. Although he was now just half a step away from the Seventh-Order, there was still a thin barrier blocking his path. If he could not break through this barrier, he would not be able to glimpse the broad horizons of the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm.

The Sixth-Order was in the Mid-Rank, while the Seventh-Order was the beginning of the High-Rank. The gap between them was simply too great.

[Just a little more…]

Just as Yang Kai thought he had reached his limit, another wave of energy suddenly surged through his body. This wave of energy came at just the right moment, shattering the already cracking shackles.

*Hong…*

An invisible shockwave burst out from Yang Kai as the prestige of a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master filled the void!

Atop the World Tree, two figures slowly descended. One of them wiped the cold sweat from his forehead as he muttered, “Luckily, we were not too late!”

The other person stated, “What a pity, I thought that after advancing to the Sixth-Order, I would be able to enjoy a good fight with old friends, but I didn’t expect I wouldn’t have such an opportunity!”

Iron Blood Great Emperor opened his eyes and gently smiled, “The two of you aren’t good at fighting anyway, so it’s best if you don’t cause trouble.”

Wondrous Pill and Heavens Revelations looked at each other and had no choice but to agree, “Fair enough!”

The two of them had been cultivating in Void Land all this time, attempting to break through to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. Just when they somehow broke through and were preparing to head to the Territory Gate to assist, Hei He happened to bring Lan Xun to Void Land.

When the two of them learned of the situation, they anxiously rushed to the Star Boundary, but they were still a step behind Heavenly Sword Union.

By the time the two of them finally returned to the Star Boundary’s Great Territory, Heavenly Sword Union and Void Land had already fought for a long time. When they finally caught up with the Heavenly Sword Palace and arrived at the edge of the battlefield, they happened to see Yang Kai borrowing the Star Boundary’s World Force and their old friends returning to the Star Boundary to support him.

Seeing that Yang Kai was still only at the peak of the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, just half a step away from breaking through to the Seventh-Order, the two of them didn’t hesitate to return to the Star Boundary.

“I wonder if Yang Boy has reached the Seventh-Order yet,” Wondrous Pill Great Emperor looked up into the void and muttered.

“Old Dog, next year today will be the anniversary of your death!” In the void, Yang Kai was in high spirits. The World Force around him surged as he thrust out his spear, transforming it into a barrage of spear shadows that filled the sky and rained down towards Heavenly Sword Palace.

How could he lose this battle, carrying the hopes and expectations of all the Great Emperors and countless living beings in the Star Boundary on his shoulders? Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Dazzling lights flashed across the Heavenly Sword Palace as its defensive Arrays shattered and collapsed. Multiple Small Universes collapsed one after another at the same time.

Although Zuo Quan Hui was desperately repairing the Arrays, he could not catch up with the storm of attacks.

His greatest reliance was that he was an Order higher than Yang Kai’s cultivation, but now he had even lost that advantage, which had immediately pushed him into a corner.

Attacks rained down at the Heavenly Sword Palace from every direction.

Heavenly Sword Union disciples tried their best to resist, but it was impossible for them to keep up.

In less than a dozen breaths of time, the Heavenly Sword Palace suddenly cracked with a blinding flash as an inexplicable and fearsome aura surged from it.

“Everyone, dodge!” Yang Kai promptly realized that something was not right and shouted aloud, immediately using his Space Principles to wrap up those around him and quickly retreating.

Not only were Void Land’s cultivators retreating, but countless figures fled from the Heavenly Sword Palace as well.

In the blink of an eye, a terrifying shockwave suddenly swept out, as if the sun in the sky had exploded. Some of the slower Heavenly Sword Union cultivators didn’t even have time to make a sound before they were enveloped by this blinding flash and instantly lost their lives.

The fallout from this explosion crashed into everyone, causing them to feel as if they were standing in the middle of a vast ocean, unable to even stand firm. Everyone promptly used their defensive Divine Abilities and artifacts to protect themselves as stray bolts of energy and rubble flew out randomly.

Yang Kai stabilized his footing and stared straight ahead.

The Heavenly Sword Palace had exploded! After defending for over a month, crossing trillions of kilometers, they had finally managed to crack this hard nut.

Void Land’s cultivators had evacuated in time, so apart from some minor injuries suffered by a few Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters, no one had lost their life.

On the other hand, Heavenly Sword Union’s Open Heaven Realm Masters had suffered heavy casualties.

Heavenly Sword Union had spent unimaginable resources and effort to build the Heavenly Sword Palace, so the instant it was destroyed, the resulting explosion was not inferior to a full powered attack launched by a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

When the dust settled, only about 400 Open Heaven Realm Masters remained on Heavenly Sword Union’s side, and all of them were in a sorry state.
