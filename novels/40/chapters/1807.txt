“What’s happening now? Is this damned place going to be destroyed?” Lu Gui Chen rushed towards the spot where Yang Kai was breaking through.

He had only managed to recover slightly from his injuries when his eyes were forced open by the sudden change in the floating continent’s atmosphere. Thunder boomed and black clouds covered the sky while the ground trembled beneath his feet.

Completely stunned, Lu Gui Chen did not know what was going on and could only trace the disturbance to its source to try to find out what had happened.

As he rushed forward, he saw the black clouds in the sky growing ever larger as terrifying bolts of lightning shuttled back and forth like great dragons.

The scene was truly frightening.

After flying a few hundred kilometres, Lu Gui Chen’s eyes flashed as he suddenly ran across a strange Monster Beast that had a bloody glow about it that barred his way forward.

Lu Gui Chen was taken aback and stopped quickly because he saw that this Monster Beast’s pupils radiated a malicious light, as if it was warning him to go no further.

He believed if he continued, this Blood Beast would definitely strike out at him mercilessly.

The Blood Beasts belonged to Yang Kai, and he knew this, so Lu Gui Chen only had to think a little before realizing that the current situation on the floating continent was related to Yang Kai.

Was this the result of him trying to refine the Star Source? Lu Gui Chen speculated wildly in his mind, but to no avail.

After hesitating for a moment, he soared up into the air, stood at a high altitude and looked forward.

Yang Kai’s figure immediately appeared in his eyes, and although they were still separated by about thirty kilometres, Lu Gui Chen was now a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm master, so he was able to see the situation clearly.

“This... aren’t these the signs of a breakthrough?” Lu Gui Chen exclaimed in amazement, his whole body shaking.

Yang Kai was a Third-Order Origin Realm cultivator, so if he were to make a breakthrough... didn’t that mean he would become an Origin King?!

When the three words ‘Origin King Realm’ came to Lu Gui Chen’s mind, it was like a bolt of lightning struck him and he nearly fell from the sky in shock.

The Origin King Realm! That was the peak of the Star Field. Lu Gui Chen could hardly believe that he would be able to witness a cultivator break through to the Origin King Realm with his own eyes one day. Only after biting his tongue hard enough that he felt pain did Lu Gui Chen confirm he wasn’t dreaming or witnessing some kind of hallucination.

Several dozen years ago, the Origin King Realm was an unreachable summit in his eyes. Back then, a random look from an Origin King would have been enough to extinguish his Soul.

Even today, several dozen years later, Lu Gui Chen still had a sense of awe and terror towards the Origin King Realm.

With the improvement of his strength, he could better understand just how towering the Origin King Realm was.

[This little brat is so young, yet he was about to make a breakthrough to the Origin King Realm? When I saw him back then, he was just an insignificant Saint that I could seal casually...]

The past was as fleeting as smoke, but it was also vivid.

If this boy could break through at this time, he would definitely be the youngest Origin King in the entire Star Field, an unprecedented achievement that could only be described as shocking the ancient and dazzling the present!

Lu Gui Chen bit his tongue again to put away these chaotic thoughts before flying down to the ground and sitting down cross-legged.

He knew that being able to witness this was definitely an opportunity for him.

Observing the breakthrough of an Origin King at such a close distance was not a chance that could be encountered casually. If he could learn something from this baptism, his cultivation would surely become smoother in the future.

As such, Lu Gui Chen made the decisive decision to observe everything that transpired next.

The power of the black clouds in the sky became stronger and stronger, and when the atmosphere reached a certain peak, there was a sudden crackling and a jet-black stream of light, like a descending dragon, fell from the sky.

Yang Kai’s muffled snort rang out as the entire continent trembled under this impact.

“This...” Lu Gui Chen was shocked and exclaimed, “So terrifying?”

Every time a cultivator broke through to a new Great Realm, they would receive a World Energy baptism that was in some senses a test given to them by the ambient World Principles.

As an Origin Returning Realm cultivator, Lu Gui Chen had experienced multiple World Energy baptisms before.

He had also broken through to the Origin Returning Realm in this place less than thirty years ago.

But at that time, the intensity of the baptism was far, far less than the bolt of black lightning he just witnessed.

And that was only the first strike. As the baptism continued, the following strikes would only grow stronger and more terrifying!

“If it was me, would I have survived?” Lu Gui Chen could not help thinking, putting himself in Yang Kai’s position and imagining what he would do if he were to try to endure such a terrifying blast of raw power as a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator.

The answer was simple...

He could not! It was absolutely impossible, and even if he was lucky enough to survive the first strike, the second or third would surely take his life!

Thinking so, Lu Gui Chen’s aura suddenly became disordered as his Martial Heart, which had always been filled with deep determination, began to falter.

*Kacha...*

The second baptism bolt struck, and although the jet black beam of energy physically struck Yang Kai’s body, it always seemed to pierce the flaws in Lu Gui Chen’s mind several dozen kilometres away.

*Wa...*

Lu Gui Chen opened his mouth and coughed up blood after which his entire aura began to deflate.

His cultivation began to regress at a speed visible to the naked eye, Second-Order Origin Returning Realm, First-Order Origin Returning Realm, Third-Order Saint King...

Finally, it stopped at the Second-Order Saint King!

There was a saying: If you don’t seek death, you won’t die!

Lu Gui Chen wanted to observe and emulate Yang Kai’s breakthrough in order to gain some benefits, which was not a bad idea in its own right, but what he didn’t know was that the baptism Yang Kai was experiencing was far different from that of an ordinary cultivator. The World Energy baptism Yang Kai needed to withstand was several times more intense than an average cultivator.

This time, it was even more exaggerated as he was breaking through to the Origin King Realm. Even Yang Kai himself had been wary of the baptism he would have to face today, so what did a trivial Lu Gui Chen count for?

Lu Gui Chen was far too presumptuous to think of placing himself in Yang Kai’s position. It was simply a self-inflicted trauma.

One’s Martial Heart should only grow stronger after each setback if one wanted to continue to advance on the path of cultivation! Lu Gui Chen had questioned himself and his Martial Heart, so he had suffered devastating consequences.

The only reason he survived was that his Martial Heart had collapsed too quickly.

If his indecision had continued much longer, he would likely have died on the spot.

Sitting dumbly on the spot, Lu Gui Chen could no longer give birth to any other thoughts, not even reacting to his realm regressing to the point it was at several dozen years ago.

His eyes were dull, with no trace of light within them.

At the same time.

Outside the space where the floating continent existed, in the Chaotic Abyss.

It had not been long since Yang Kai had disappeared, but Zi Long and his son were already becoming impatient and irritable.

Gui Zu on the other hand wore a leisurely expression as he relaxed.

Although Xue Yue had received Gui Zu’s guarantee that Yang Kai was safe and sound, she was unable to calm herself and leaned over and asked softly, “Senior, it’s been almost ten days yet there’s been no movement at all.”

“And what movement do you want to see?” Gui Zu glanced at her with a grin. “He’s very safe where he is, or what, do you want him to run out right now?”

“No,” Xue Yue waved her hands quickly, “As long as he’s safe, I can feel relieved, it’s just...”

“Relax, I know what you’re worried about, but didn’t this old master already promise you? That damned place was able to trap this old master for two thousand years, but it cannot hold Yang Kai. When he wants to leave, he will naturally come out, and when he does, this old master will be sure to convey your concern to him.”

“Senior...” Xue Yue flushed with shame and stomped her feet repeatedly.

“I can’t wait here too long,” Ni Guang frowned to the side, “There are too many things waiting for my attention back in the Chamber of Commerce, so this old master cannot remain here indefinitely. If this old master leaves, Old Ghost, can you fight Zi Long one on one?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Are you looking down on me?” Gui Zu coldly snorted, “Zi Long isn’t worth a fart to me.”

“Even if you can tie down Zi Long, when that boy Yang Kai runs out, Xu Wei and Kong Fa will definitely focus on him, and there’s only one of you, so what do you plan to do at that time?”

Gui Zu frowned.

This was exactly what he was worried about.

If Ni Guang left and Yang Kai came out, there would still be three Origin Kings on Zi Long’s side. While Gui Zu was confident he could entangle Zi Long and Xu Wei, who were severely injured and weakened, but could Yang Kai deal with Kong Fa on his own?

Kong Fa was currently standing on Zi Long’s side. Only the Heavens knew what kind of benefits Zi Long promised him to achieve this.

It was a serious headache...

What Gui Zu hoped for most was that Yang Kai remained hidden. He did not believe that Zi Long could remain here forever; after all, how could the Sect Master of Purple Star have so much free time?

“Hm?” Ni Guang frowned suddenly as he stared towards a certain place, “That’s...”

“Something’s wrong. What’s happening?” Gui Zu also muttered.

On the other side, the three Origin Kings, Zi Long, Xu Wei, and Kong Fa also noticed an anomaly and stared towards a certain spot where space seemed to be distorting and a violent power was burst forth from.

“What’s going on?” Ni Guang looked puzzled and turned to Gui Zu, hoping he could explain.

“Why are you asking this old master?” Gui Zu coldly snorted. Although he had been trapped on the floating continent for two thousand years, he did not know much about the situation outside of it.

“Is there going to be a Chaotic Vortex?” Xue Yue asked in surprise.

When these words came out, Gui Zu and Ni Guang both shivered.

The Chaotic Vortex was not an anomaly one could rush into casually. If a Chaotic Vortex was about to occur, they would all need to escape. Gui Zu had been sucked in by a Chaotic Vortex and landed on the floating continent alive once, but it was not an experience he was willing to go through again. If his luck wasn’t as good this time, he would be torn apart by the chaotic energy and be reduced to dust.
