The Shaman Grandmaster looked at the crowd with a deep meaningful smile, “The South Barbarian Clan will soon perish.”

Yue frowned as her heart sank. She understood the meaning of his words and it caused her skin to crawl. Lu seemed to want to say something more, but immediately stopped when her sister tugged at her.

Yue went back directly to Tiea and whispered, “Can’t you escape?”

Among all the people here, Tiea, who was a Shaman Grandmaster, was the strongest. If anyone could escape from this place, it would be Tiea, but ever since they were caught, Tiea had simply been staying quietly here without any intention to escape.

Tiea shook her head.

“Aren’t you from the Nomad Clan? Your concealment skills are without equal.”

Tiea replied, “But I’m just a Shaman Grandmaster, and there are five Shaman Kings here.”

Yue had nothing more to say. The huge gap in strength really made it impossible for Tiea to escape from here.

Yue continued, “We will be eaten by them. Someone must escape to find Sir Shaman Niu!”

Tiea whispered, “He will come, and we won’t be eaten.”

“But…” Yue looked anxious. The words from the previous Shaman Grandmaster caught her attention. More than twenty thousand people in the Shaman Niu Clan were detained here, not just because they had an ambiguous relationship with a Demon King, but because the Bone Devouring Clan regarded them as rations.

The one hundred thousand Bone Devouring Clan clansmen gathered here had to eat and drink, but how could there be so much food for them in this chaotic battlefield? The twenty thousand people of the Shaman Niu Clan were like a delicious feast that delivered itself to them.

That was why the Shaman Grandmaster insisted that the South Barbarian Clan would perish.

“Isn’t he already here?” Tiea suddenly grinned as she turned to the front, as if she had already foreseen what was about to happen.

Yue, Lu, and all the others quickly turned around and looked up, their eyes shining brightly.

They saw Sir Shaman Niu’s figure appear on the stage out of nowhere. He came in between Bao Qi and Shaman Chi, and grabbed Shaman Chi’s right hand that held the dagger.

The hundred thousand clansmen of the Bone Devouring Clan were stunned by the sudden emergence of a person, and even Shaman Chi’s face changed drastically. He instinctively pushed his Shaman Strength to resist, but found that he could not free his hand from the grip of this interloper.

When he looked up, the face that had given him sleepless nights appeared before his eyes.

“It’s you!” Shaman Chi gnashed his teeth as he bellowed, his face immediately turning ferocious.

“Shaman Chi, you’ve grown old.” Yang Kai looked at him indifferently.

Hearing this, Shaman Chi’s face spasmed as he shouted angrily, “What Shamanic Spell did you use on me?”

Shaman Chi looked much older than half a year ago. When Yang Kai first met him, Shaman Chi looked only about forty years-old, but now he looked at least ten or twenty years older.

This was very unusual for a Shaman King.

But not for a Shaman King who was hit by the Time Flies Seal.

Time Flies Seal was the signature Divine Ability of Flowing Time Great Emperor and had the power to accelerate the passage of an object or individual’s time. When Yang Kai was still a Low-Rank Shaman Grandmaster, he used the Time Flies Seal on Shaman Chi outside Blue South Village, and although he wasn’t strong enough back then to make this a fatal blow, it still had some effect on Shaman Chi, aging him rapidly.

Shaman Chi had no idea what kind of Shamanic Spell he was hit with, and every time he recalled it, he would feel frightened and uneasy, but the hatred in his heart would also grow stronger.

“You wouldn’t understand, and there’s no need for you to understand!” Yang Kai responded faintly. How could the Shaman Kings of this world possibly comprehend the Divine Ability of a Great Emperor who would not even be born for at least another hundred thousand years? Yang Kai tightened his grip, and Shaman Chi could not help retreating a few steps back.

“Bao Qi is my subordinate!” Yang Kai stared straight at Shaman Chi, “He shouldn’t receive such torture!”

“Sir!” Bao Qi shouted softly, holding back his trembling body. He thought that he would die here for sure, but Yang Kai’s appearance brought him hope to live.

Although there were five Shaman Kings here, he still believed that Sir Shaman Niu could save him. It was his instinct, an intuition, and Bao Qi trusted it with all his heart.

Yang Kai nodded and a light flashed in his hand. Then as he tapped on Bao Qi’s body, the Shamanic Spell that bound Bao Qi immediately collapsed, allowing him to regain his freedom.

“How dare you release him!” Shaman Chi reprimanded angrily. In order to capture this Demon King, the Bone Devouring Clan had put in a lot of effort, but now, Shaman Niu let him go as soon as he came. He simply did not put the Bone Devouring Clan in his eyes.

“Open your mouth!” Yang Kai ignored him and ordered Bao Qi.

Bao Qi opened his mouth as he was instructed. The next moment, something was thrown from Yang Kai’s hand into his throat.

“Refine it.”

Bao Qi immediately sat cross-legged on the floor and circulated his strength to refine whatever it was that entered his stomach. He instantly felt a cool sensation spreading all over his body, which greatly reduced his pain, and especially his arm that only had white bones remaining, even causing a tingling sensation to spread out from it

Shaman Chi was so angry at this scene that he glared at Yang Kai with a darkened face; however, he didn’t seem to be in a hurry to make a move and instead just sneered, “Shaman Niu, I have to thank you.”

“Thank me for what?” Yang Kai looked up at him.

As soon as Shaman Chi pushed his Shaman Strength, an extremely strong aura spread out.

Yang Kai raised his brow, “Oh? You’re already a Mid-Rank Shaman King. Congratulations.”

Shaman Chi continued, “Without you, I wouldn’t have been able to become a Mid-Rank Shaman King so soon.”

He suffered a great loss in his encounter with Yang Kai last time, but although he was injured, Shaman Chi recognized his shortcomings and strived hard to improve. During his recuperation, he had a breakthrough in comprehension and after countless battles with the Demon Race, he finally broke through from the Low-Rank Shaman King realm to the Mid-Rank Shaman King Realm.

“No need to feel grateful, it was all your own effort.” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

Shaman Chi grimaced a little. Such a response was not what he hoped to see. Then he shouted, “Shaman Niu, the South Barbarian Clan has perished. If you want to live, you’d best understand what you must do!”

“The South Barbarian Clan has not perished!” Yang Kai corrected him with a solemn look, “I and my subordinates are still here, so the South Barbarian Clan has not died.”

Shaman Chi laughed, “With only a Shaman Grandmaster like you? All the Shaman Kings of the South Barbarian Clan are dead. Without a Shaman King, your Clan has no qualification to exist. Don’t you know that?”

The Barbarians Clans often annexed each other. Just like Blue South Village, if Yang Kai had not been born there, the village without a Shaman’s protection would soon be annexed by other villages after the death of the old Village Chief.

The same was true in all Clans.

Having a Shaman King was the most important criteria for the existence of a Great Clan. A Great Clan without a Shaman King would lose its standing.

“We just need a Shaman King, right?” Yang Kai closed his eyes as he spoke, “If that’s what you want.”

When he opened his eyes again, they radiated intensely, and an exceedingly powerful aura suddenly exploded from his body. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Shaman Chi’s face changed drastically as he thought that Yang Kai was going to attack him. In fact, he could not wait for him to do so, so that he could fight back without hesitation and obtain his revenge.

To his great surprise though, he found that Yang Kai did not have any intention to fight. Rather, the aura from his body grew stronger and more ferocious and in the blink of an eye, it exceeded the Realm of a Shaman Grandmaster and touched the Shaman King Realm.

“This is…” Shaman Chi was dumbfounded.

Before he could finish his sentence, Yang Kai’s aura suddenly soared, as if the shackles restraining it had been broken through, allowing Yang Kai’s Realm to climb to a new height.

Shaman Chi’s eyes quivered violently as he could hardly believe what he just witnessed.

“If it’s just a Shaman King, there’s one here now…” Yang Kai grinned at him.

The twenty thousand Shaman Niu Clansmen who were detained not far away burst out in cheers after a moment of stunned silence. All of them were excited beyond measure, especially Yue and Lu. Shaman King! There was a new Shaman King in the South Barbarian Clan! That meant that in this war of two races, the South Barbarian Clan still had the right to act independently, and did not have to seek refuge under another Great Clan or became a vassal to one.

The cheers were soon suppressed, however, as several figures suddenly appeared, and spread out into four corners to surround the stage. All of them possessed profound cultivation, revealing the aura of a Shaman King. They were the other Bone Devouring Clan Shaman Kings assuming command in Cang Er Mountain Valley. They chose not to appear earlier because they did not think it was necessary. Shaman Chi should be able to deal with Yang Kai, who was just a Shaman Grandmaster, easily.

But when Yang Kai suddenly and inexplicably became a Shaman King, they had to show up.

Among them, a bald Shaman King had the most powerful aura and seemed to be a little stronger than the others. He looked at Yang Kai with his authoritative eyes, and remarked, “I’ve never seen such an effortless breakthrough to the Shaman King Realm.”

“That simply means your knowledge is not broad enough.” Even facing a High-Rank Shaman King whose cultivation was two Minor Realms above his own, Yang Kai remained calm and composed.

“Rumour has it that you received the favour of the Barbarian Gods. I didn’t believe it at first, but it seems that it might be true.” The bald Shaman King looked Yang Kai up and down as if he wanted to examine him thoroughly.

“Sir has heard of me before?” Yang Kai was surprised.

The bald Shaman King glanced at Shaman Chi, and continued, “I definitely would pay a little attention to those who could defeat stronger enemies and hurt Shaman Chi.”

Shaman Chi’s face turned ugly, glaring at Yang Kai angrily, as if his unhealed wound had been sprinkled with salt.

“But…” The bald Shaman King pressed on, “It’s meaningless even if you break through to the Shaman King Realm. Your South Barbarian Clan has perished. This is a fact, and no one can change it.”

“I’m still alive, and twenty thousand of my subordinates are still alive. We can rebuild the South Barbarian Clan!” Yang Kai continued with a deep voice, “Sir, don’t make a judgement too early.”

The bald Shaman King shook his head, “The Sacred Treasure of the South Barbarian Clan is already lost so… where did you get that?”

His eyes suddenly darted to an object that looked like a wood-carving that Yang Kai was casually playing with in his hand. There was also a similar wood-carving in the Bone Devouring Clan, but it was in the hands of their Shaman Saint. Even a High-Rank Shaman King like him was not qualified to touch it.

The Sacred Treasure was a symbol of authority over their Clan, and most people thought of it as just a token, but a few Shaman Kings knew that the Sacred Treasure had many other wonderful functions.

Being able to obtain a Sacred Treasure would be a great help to a Shaman King’s cultivation.
