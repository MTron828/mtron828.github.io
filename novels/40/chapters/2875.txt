“For the last time, do you want to live, or do you want to die? If no one is willing to submit to me, I don’t mind killing you all. You’re not the only Demon Kings out there so I have plenty of choices. Besides, you don’t have to feel ashamed. Those of you who don’t submit to me will die, and if you submit to me, you will survive. No one will know your choice today except yourselves! These are your last three breaths.” Yang Kai suddenly seemed to be a little impatient when he issued the ultimatum and immediately raised three fingers, calling out with a cold expression as he bent the first finger, “Three!”

After a pause, he continued, “Two!”

All the Demon Kings’ faces turned solemn, realizing the outcome at the end of Shaman Niu’s countdown.

Before he called out the last number, a Demon King with scars on his face stood up and stammered in a low voice, “I am willing to… be loyal to Sir!”

He gritted his teeth as he blurted these words. His expression was difficult to read, but it was obvious that he was struggling violently deep in his heart.

The ghost fire in the Bone Demon Fei Li’s eyes was stagnant. When Sha Ya first surrendered to this foreign race, he already expected such a scene, so he did not blame the others at this moment.

Die on their feet or live on their knees, these were their own choices. Some were willing to abandon their dignity and pride to this foreign race, and he could not stop them from doing that.

But he knew that most of the Demon Kings here were not such cowards.

They were Demon Kings!

The facts had indeed proved Fei Li right. He and the majority of Demon Kings watched the few Demon Kings submit to Yang Kai with shame and anxiety, like a group of children who have done something wrong, waiting for Yang Kai’s judgment.

“Five is it…” Yang Kai wore a small smile as he watched the Demon Kings who were kneeling down in a row, and also at the eight people in the back, smiling as he commented, “It looks like you have all made your own choices.”

Fei Li snorted coldly, his eyes turning contemptuously to the five Demon Kings in front of him before meeting Yang Kai’s eyes, the dancing ghost fire in his sockets full of sarcasm.

“En, the number of people is just right.” Yang Kai grinned.

His words confused the Demon Kings.

Yang Kai slowly lifted his hand, his expression indifferent, “Then you may die now!”

“The Demon Race shall never die!” Fei Li shouted.

The other Demon Kings also began chanting one after another, a look of death-defying determination on their faces.

Popping sounds were then heard as the bodies of each Demon King exploded into a blood mist. There were no bones, and even the Demon Hearts hidden in their bodies vaporized. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Sha Ya’s grin froze on her face and Bao Qi’s eyes twitched violently while the shock in Fei Li’s heart was evident as the two bundles of ghost fire flickered wildly in his eye sockets.

The other Demon Kings were also dumbfounded.

The slaughtered Demon Kings were not the Demon Kings who refused to surrender, but the five cowards who bowed their heads to Yang Kai!

[Did he mistakenly kill the wrong group?]

This thought involuntarily emerged in every Demon King’s mind, but how was that possible? If it was not a mistake, then there was only one explanation left.

This foreigner had done this intentionally. The ones he really wanted to keep with him were not those cowards, but the remaining Demon Kings who refused to surrender. No wonder he said that the number of people was just right. Besides Bao Qi and Sha Ya who had already surrendered to him, the remaining eight people were indeed just the right number!

“What are your intentions here?” Fei Li glared coldly at Yang Kai and asked.

“Don’t you understand what my intentions are?” Yang Kai chuckled slightly.

Fei Li answered, “We will never surrender. You should just kill us.”

Yang Kai nodded in agreement, “I have no doubt about that. You have proved it with actual actions, but I said before that even if you don’t want to submit, I have a way to turn you into my slaves. I need the true Masters among you, while those who actively bow their heads are useless!”

Sha Ya blushed slightly as she surrendered easily without going through much torture. Thinking about that now, she was silently grateful that she was the first to submit to Yang Kai. If she was placed in that position just now, she would most probably be dead.

“Did you humiliate them, shame them, and then kill them just for this reason?” Fei Li’s emotions were beginning to boil. The several dead Demon Kings were cowardly, but Yang Kai’s treacherous behaviour still infuriated him.

“Yes, just because of this.” Yang Kai looked just as indifferent and emotionless as ever, “This was the only way I could clean out the trash.”

Fei Li opened his mouth and wanted to speak, but Yang Kai waved his hand, not giving him a chance to speak, and continued impatiently, “Good, now it’s your turn.”

He stretched out his hand as he spoke, and drew a Demon King over in front of him. His left eye suddenly flashed a golden light as he gazed at the Demon King authoritatively.

The Demon King struggled violently but without any success. With the World’s suppression and Yang Kai’s powerful Divine Sense influx, the Demon King flashed a look of pain on his face, but it was very soon replaced by a resigned expression.

By the time Yang Kai put him down, the Demon King shook his head uncomfortably, and when he raised his head to look at Yang Kai, his eyes were a bit complicated, but there was no longer any hostility. He bowed respectfully and went to stand silently next to Bao Qi and Sha Ya.

“Welcome, Strength Demon You La!” Bao Qi smiled.

The Strength Demon, whose name was You La, glanced at him but still said nothing, causing Bao Qi to feel snubbed.

“Hey, what is this? This doesn’t look good!” Shadow Demon Mo Ke Tuo gulped nervously and lost interest in trying to use her Secret Technique to conceal herself. Watching a stubborn and unwilling Demon King get subdued by the foreign race in such a short time left Mo Ke Tuo shocked and anxious.

The other Demon Kings who witnessed the incident felt the same way.

They were not afraid of death. If they were really afraid of death, they would not have stood so firmly in place and refused to bend their backs. What they really feared was being enslaved and becoming slaves to another!

Even the Demon Saints had not enslaved them.

Without the suppression of this strange World, they would rather use their Demon Qi to self-destruct instead of living an ignoble life. The sad thing was that they could not even kill themselves now.

One Demon King after another was brought in front of the foreign race boy, and knowing what was going to happen next left the rest of the Demon Kings feeling devastated.

“Sir, didn’t you say forcefully picked melons are not sweet? Just let us die, why do you have to put in so much effort?” Mo Ke Tuo opened her mouth and shouted at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai raised his eyes at her, grinning, “Indeed, a forcefully picked melon is not sweet, but… it can still quench one’s thirst!”

Mo Ke Tuo’s expression froze, her face twitching violently.

While she was fuming, Yang Kai pulled her body towards him.

Sighing slightly, and knowing that she would not be able to escape anyway, Mo Ke Tuo just stood before him with a helpless expression.

One by one, the Demon Kings were branded with Yang Kai’s Soul Imprint, and finally, it was Fei Li’s turn.

As the unofficial leader of the many Demon Kings present, Fei Li deserved to be proud as even when Yang Kai branded his Soul Imprint on him, he did not give up resisting. Unfortunately, his resistance was completely useless in the Sealed World Bead.

In just a stick worth of incense, the eight Demon Kings with Fei Li as their leader were all subdued.

Everyone stood together, exchanging awkward glances.

Sha Ya enthusiastically circulated around the many Demon Kings, boasting of Yang Kai’s abilities in an attempt to dispel their dissatisfaction somewhat.

Yang Kai also consumed a huge amount of Spiritual Energy in order to complete this act, but with the support of the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus, it was still bearable, and it would only take a while for him to recuperate.

In the Sealed World Bead, the ten Demon Kings looked at Yang Kai solemnly.

Looking around, Yang Kai ordered, “I need you to do a few things for me.”

“Sir, please speak!” Fei Li replied jerkily.

“First, bring me all the demonised Barbarians under your command! I know that each of you more or less has some demonised Barbarians. I need those people.”

Fei Li nodded and obeyed, “Yes.”

The demonised Barbarians were placed in the lowest position among the Demon Race, and no one really cared for them.

“Second, I want your Demon Beasts!” Yang Kai pressed on.

Compared to the previous request, this one was more difficult to fulfil, but it was not impossible. Now that the Demon Saints were busy recuperating, almost no one else could have any control over the Demon Kings in their own territory. None of the Demon subordinates could have a say if they were forced to give up their Demon Beasts.

“Third, gather the subordinates of the Demon Kings that I killed today, and be careful not to let the news of their deaths spread out.”

The Demon Kings nodded and obeyed.

“Sir, shall we join you after finishing this?” Fei Li asked.

“No need!” Yang Kai shook his head, “After finishing, you can do whatever you should do. I will summon you when and if I need you.”

Mo Ke Tuo asked, “Then what if a forei… if Sir’s people attack us? Sir, you do know that your clansmen are also fighting back everywhere.”

Yang Kai looked at her as he answered, “It shouldn’t be difficult for you to send your subordinates to their deaths.”

As soon as this statement came out, the expressions of the eight Demon Kings changed slightly. Indeed, they were marked by Yang Kai’s Soul Imprint and became his slaves, but it was still a bit difficult to order their subordinates to die, even though this was Yang Kai’s order.

Regardless of what they thought, Yang Kai sent them all out of the Sealed World Bead after giving them orders.

In the wilderness, the eight Demon Kings flew off in different directions.

After watching the Demon Kings leave, Sha Ya smiled slightly and commented, “I thought Sir would use them and then take in their subordinates just like before.”

“It’s not a good thing to be too strong. Besides… I still need some time.”

The Shaman Niu Clan originally only had three thousand people but it had already defeated the armies of two Demon Kings. If he continued on in such a fashion, the Shaman Niu Clan would definitely become incredibly powerful in short order, but it would also attract the attention of the Demon Race.
