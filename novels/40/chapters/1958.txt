The attitude of this man was quite off-putting, which made Yang Kai upset.

However, considering that most of Blue Feather Sect’s disciples did not share a harmonious relationship and the two of them didn’t have any friendship with each other or even know each other’s names, Yang Kai didn’t let it bother him.

However, Kou Wu being task to go out a month ago surprised Yang Kai quite a bit.

He wondered what kind of task would force Kou Wu to go out in such a hurry.

Shaking his head, Yang Kai did not think too much about it and just flew forward leisurely.

Ice Cliff was only ten thousand kilometres away from Blue Feather Sect’s headquarters, a relatively short distance for Yang Kai, so it did not take him long to return to the Sect.

Before flying down to his humble residence, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and inspected the room next door.

Naturally, this was Liu Xian Yun’s residence as the two lived no more than twenty meters apart.

Inside the room, Liu Xian Yun seemed to be adjusting her breathing, but after sensing Yang Kai’s Divine Sense, she quickly opened her eyes and ran out of the room with a look of pleasant surprise on her face, “Brother Yang, you’re back?”

She had been alone for the past few months and was feeling a bit isolated and helpless here in Blue Feather Sect as it was an unfamiliar place to her.

Although she had not known Yang Kai for a long time, because the two shared similar fates and backgrounds, she still had a sense of intimacy with him that was only enhanced by Yang Kai being so kind and good to her.

When she learned that Yang Kai was being confined, she could not help worrying.

If something were to happen to Yang Kai on the Ice Cliff, she would really be alone from now on.

“I just returned,” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

“As long as you’re alright... Oh? Brother Yang, you actually made a breakthrough?” Liu Xian Yun quickly noticed Yang Kai’s breakthrough and lifted her hand to cover her mouth, her beautiful eyes flashing with surprise. After all, she had heard that the environment in Ice Cliff was extremely harsh and it was difficult for people to even survive. She had been worrying about Yang Kai’s safety, but he had now returned unscathed and actually broke through as well.

“It was just luck,” Yang Kai nodded faintly. “How have you been these past few months?”

“How else could I have been?” Liu Xian Yun smiled bitterly and shook her head, “Nothing’s happened.”

As she spoke though, she suddenly coughed slightly, and an abnormal blush appeared on her face. Although she concealed this extremely quickly, how could Yang Kai have missed it?

“You’re hurt?” Yang Kai frowned.

“I had a small accident while I was cultivating,” Liu Xian Yun replied hurriedly.

Yang Kai stared into her eyes, as if to look straight into her heart, causing Liu Xian Yun to smile forcefully, “It’s not a big deal, I just became a bit too anxious while I was meditating. I’ll be fine after a few days of rest.”

“Was it really an accident when you were cultivating?” Yang Kai’s voice gradually became cold. Liu Xian Yun was a Third-Order Origin King, and although it wasn’t unheard of for Cultivation Dissonance to occur during a retreat, that was only under the premise that someone was in secluded retreat and made a mistake while comprehending some profound Secret Technique or Art.

How could Liu Xian Yun have been so reckless to enter a secluded retreat in this unfamiliar, almost hostile environment?

“Why would I need to lie about this?” Liu Xian Yun said anxiously, “I wanted to enter retreat to comprehend the mysteries of the Dao Source Realm a few days ago, but I didn’t expect my strength wasn’t sufficient...”

“I’m not a naïve child, tell me the truth,” Yang Kai interrupted her explanation.

Liu Xian Yun opened her mouth to say something, but soon let out a sigh before lowering her head, “Brother Yang, just let this matter drop. Right now, Protector Bian and Senior Brother Kou are not in the Sect. If we stir up trouble, it won’t end well.”

“Protector Bian isn’t in the Sect?” Yang Kai frowned.

“En, Protector Bian and a large number of the senior disciples left about a month ago. Senior Brother Kou was among them. I don’t know why they left. In any case, I’m really fine, it’s just a small injury. You and I are still new here, so we should tolerate what we can tolerate.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly before curling his lips and flashing a wry grin, “It’s good that you can think so, but I’m afraid some people don’t share your opinion.”

As he spoke, he turned his head and looked to the side.

Liu Xian Yun was startled but quickly reacted, following his gaze as her own became stern.

Over there, a group of four cultivators was walking over, with the one in the lead wearing a resolute and indifferent look. With his hands behind his back, he gave off an imposing aura while behind him there were three people whom Yang Kai had met before.

One of them was Chu Fei, who had been taught a harsh lesson by him in the shopping district last time. It had been three months already, but Chu Fei’s injuries had still yet to completely heal; this wasn’t a surprise though as Yang Kai had only held back just enough to not kill him last time. Even with good healing pills and Chu Fei’s own restorative abilities, healing completely in just three months was impossible. At this moment, Chu Fei had a somewhat weak air about him, with a pale complexion and slightly unsteady steps. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The other two were the ones who had been accompanying Chu Fei at the time.

The moment Yang Kai returned from the Ice Cliff, this group of people had shown up at his door, so their intentions were blatantly obvious.

Chu Fei looked at Yang Kai with deep hatred, like he was staring at his mortal enemy. Grinding his teeth, he quietly whispered to the cultivator who was walking in the forefront.

This man’s expression was cold and did not change in the slightest, but judging from Chu Fei’s flattering demeanour, it was apparent that this man’s status in Blue Feather Sect was not low; it was at least on the same level as Kou Wu’s, with strength to match.

This group walked over arrogantly while the man in the lead directed sharp eyes towards Yang Kai, obvious disdain and contempt apparent in his gaze.

After coming to a stop some ten meters away, Chu Fei looked at Yang Kai grimly before sneering, “Junior Brother Yang, I trust you’ve been well since we last met. I didn’t expect that Protector Bian locking you up in Ice Cliff didn’t take your life, it seems your luck isn’t bad.”

Yang Kai lightly chuckled as he swept his eyes over Chu Fei and said, “How are Senior Brother Chu’s injuries? Are your muscles perhaps cramped from lying in bed for so long and you came here to find Junior Brother to loosen them for you again? If that is the case, Junior Brother is happy to help.”

Chu Fei heard this and couldn’t help shivering slightly. In the battle three months ago, he had been unable to put up any resistance and was quickly knocked to the ground and beaten to a pulp. He had not only been severely wounded, but he had also lost all face. Even thinking about it now still gave him nightmares.

Realizing he had become frightened with just a few words, Chu Fei became angry out of shame and snapped, “Don’t be so full of yourself! If you know what’s good for you and cooperate, Senior Brother might spare you some pain, but if you don’t...”

“Oh...” Yang Kai exclaimed. “After not seeing you for three months, Senior Brother Chu’s courage has certainly grown a lot, I wonder why that is? Could it be... because of this Senior Brother?”

Saying so, Yang Kai turned his eyes towards the leader of this group.

Yang Kai didn’t bother acting polite as the other party was obviously here to retaliate, so acting humble would only be showing weakness.

Chu Fei and the other two Origin Kings were not of any concern to Yang Kai. Three months ago, when he was just a Second-Order Origin King, he was able to easily deal with these three, and now his strength had grown quite significantly. The only one Yang Kai had to care about was this helper they had brought.

The man’s aura was on the same level as Kou Wu’s, and if Yang Kai’s guess was right, he should be a First-Order Dao Source Realm master. This man had not said a word since he appeared, but when Yang Kai’s eyes met with his, a terrifying light flashed across them as a pure burst of Spiritual Energy shot out and stabbed towards his Knowledge Sea.

This man had directly displayed a Soul Secret Technique in an attempt to overwhelm Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea defences in one fell swoop, giving him a vicious demonstration of authority.

Yang Kai was furious.

Divine Sense attacks were extremely dangerous, and if one was not careful, they could wind up as a mindless fool. The other party’s actions were nothing less than brutal, and he obviously had no intention of holding back. This was completely different from when Yang Kai had beat up Chu Fei. No matter how heavy-handed Yang Kai was at the time, he made sure that Chu Fei would be able to recover normally if given enough time, but this man had launched an attack that could very well cause irreversible injury.

At the very least, this kind of approach would leave dark injuries on his Soul that could never be fully healed.

Infuriated, Yang Kai coldly snorted and madly mobilized his own Knowledge Sea’s, summoning up a roaring wave of Spiritual Energy to meet his opponent head-on.

Facing a Divine Sense attack that had already locked onto him, Yang Kai could not dodge and could only brutally fight back!

At the same time, inside his Knowledge Sea, a dazzling seven coloured light blossomed from the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus as it began to rotate rapidly. The dazzling radiance expanded outwards and merged together with Yang Kai’s Divine Sense, further enhancing the power of his attack.

An invisible collision erupted between the two at a level of danger far greater than simply crossing swords.

The attacking man’s eyes shrank as a look of surprise and amazement flashed across his face. Obviously, he hadn’t expected Yang Kai’s Soul to be just as powerful as his own.

A moment of carelessness had caused him to suffer a small loss as his face turned pale and he felt a sharp pain in his head.

Yang Kai also did not feel any better though. Such a dangerous Divine Sense collision had obviously caused him some damage as well; however, with the protection and restorative power of his Soul Warming Lotus, he did not need to worry about this.

Even if his Soul was damaged, the Soul Warming Lotus would be able to repair it for him.

On the contrary, his opponent, who had believed he could crush Yang Kai at will, now discovered that the young man in front of him was actually able to fight him on even ground, making him curse himself for underestimating his opponent as he hurriedly tried to take back his Divine Sense.

But how could Yang Kai let him off so easily?

Relying on his higher cultivation, this man had launched a Divine Sense attack without saying a word, obviously intending to suppress him in one shot, yet now he wanted to retreat? Not if Yang Kai had anything to say about it!

Resisting the piercing ache in his mind, Yang Kai grit his teeth and forced his Divine Sense to chase after the withdrawing enemy.

The indifferent look on the man’s face finally changed, all of his previous disdain and mockery being replaced with shock and horror. Although he had only fought a single round with Yang Kai, he could now see that this young man was a madman.

Without even mentioning how this Junior Brother at the Third-Order Origin King Realm had Spiritual Energy equal to his own, just the will to risk critically injuring himself to strike back at his opponent was not something an ordinary man could achieve.

[Does this bastard... not fear death?] Deep in his heart, the man felt a deep sense of fright.
