“Young Master Yang, this place is…”

Old Ban asked carefully after Ying Fei had gone far away.

“Luan Feng’s palace, the Phoenix Nest Palace!” Yang Kai answered.

“Luan Feng…”

Old Ban’s eyes widened. He realized that what he had experienced today was more shocking than all the experiences of the rest of his life combined. It was sensational enough to sit on the back of a Monster King, but now, he was actually standing in front of the palace of a Divine Spirit.

If it were not for Yang Kai, it would be impossible for him to be here. Yang Kai could not only make a Monster King, Ying Fei, willingly serve as a mount, he could even simply walk up to a Divine Spirit’s palace.

Old Ban could not understand what identity and origin Yang Kai had that allowed him to do this.

While speaking, the palace gate suddenly opened, from which a beautiful and slim woman in an elegant dress came straight to Yang Kai and stood in front of him, saluting politely, “Greetings, Young Master Yang!”

Yang Kai smiled as he glanced at her, “Tian Long, long time no see.”

This woman was the maidservant Luan Feng arranged to serve him when he came to Phoenix Nest Palace as a guest the last time. Although Yang Kai had only met her a few times, they were still quite familiar with each other.

“It hasn’t been that long…” Tian Long looked up at him with a far-fetched smile, “Why is Young Master Yang here this time? Is there some kind of problem?”

Yang Kai replied, “I need some help from Lady Feng. May I know where she is?”

Tian Long answered, “Young Master Yang, unfortunately, you’ve come at a bad time. Mistress just happened to enter a retreat a few days ago.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai could not help giving her a meaningful look as he commented, “Lady Feng is a Divine Spirit, and she has a body that is naturally gifted in cultivation where the Heavens themselves assist in her development. Why would she even need to cultivate in retreat? Could it be… she simply doesn’t want to see me?”

Tian Long hastily explained, “There is no such thing. Mistress is really in retreat.”

Yang Kai ignored her and walked straight into the Phoenix Nest Palace.

Seeing this, Tian Long scurried after him hurriedly.

After entering the Phoenix Nest Palace, Yang Kai strode in and yelled repeatedly, “Lady Feng, Lady Feng, Yang Kai has come to see you.”

Tian Long did not know whether she should laugh or cry. She could only follow him all the way and remind him incessantly, “Young Master Yang, please don’t shout. If Mistress is disturbed, she will blame this servant.”

“Lady Feng, Lady Feng!” Yang Kai ignored her and continued his clamour.

After a long time, a figure suddenly appeared in front of Yang Kai. The figure was dignified and graceful, with a deep and profound aura; who else could it be other than Luan Feng?

However, at the moment, Luan Feng looked at Yang Kai with a slightly resentful face, her eyes full of complaint and animosity, as if Yang Kai was some pest she desperately wanted to be rid of.

“Lady Feng!” Yang Kai grinned as he saw her, and went forward with his fists cupped, “Greetings Lady Feng.”

Tian Long, who followed behind Yang Kai, also came up and looked at Luan Feng helplessly, “Mistress, this maidservant…”

“You may go,” Luan Feng waved to her.

Tian Long received the order and stepped away respectfully.

Luan Feng glanced at Yang Kai wickedly before turning around and walking off.

Yang Kai followed her with a smile while Xiao Ling’er and Old Ban followed close behind.

When she got to the main hall, Luan Feng turned around and sat on her throne, showing not the slightest politeness to Yang Kai and the others as she took a cup of steaming tea and enjoyed it herself.

“Sit, sit!” Yang Kai stretched out his hand and gestured to Old Ban.

Old Ban did not dare to sit. Standing there in the hall was already a very brave thing for him to do. He hurriedly waved his hand, “This old man can just stand.”

The woman in front of him was Divine Spirit Luan Feng. Even though she did not release her monstrous aura, Old Ban still did not dare to be impudent in front of her, or even dare to make a smile, lest he make this Divine Spirit upset with his improper behaviour.

He held Xiao Ling’er tightly with his hands as well to avoid his child from being ill-mannered towards Luan Feng.

Yang Kai did not force Old Ban to sit and instead turned to Luan Feng with a smile on his face, “Lady Feng doesn’t look like she’s in a good mood.”

Luan Feng raised her eyes and shot a look at him, responding impolitely, “I was in a good mood earlier, but not anymore. Why are you here again?”

Yang Kai answered, “I haven’t seen Lady Feng for so long, so I just came to pay her a visit.”

Luan Feng nodded her head lightly, “Now that you’ve seen me, Young Master Yang can go back.”

“How would that be appropriate?” Yang Kai smiled in embarrassment, “I just arrived here and you wanted to drive me away? Is that any way to treat a guest?”

“If Young Master Yang wants to stay here for a few days, this Queen welcomes you. You may stay at the same place where you did the last time. If you need anything, you can find Tian Long.” After speaking, Luan Feng stood up and looked like she did not want to waste anymore time with Yang Kai.

“Wait, wait, wait!” Yang Kai immediately stopped her when he saw her leaving.

Luan Feng snorted, “Little brat, what’s the matter with you? Coming to find this Queen at this time? Quickly speak, this Queen is not in the mood to waste her breath with you.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Yang Kai continued to smile dumbly, “Lady Feng really has sharp eyes. It is true that this Junior is in need of a little help from you.”

“Ha…” Luan Feng abruptly snorted sarcastically, “What in the world could make a person like Young Master Yang seek the help of this Queen? How come you weren’t this humble when you made a big stir in the Ancient Lands by showing off in front of thirty two Monster Kings and the eight Great Kings last time?”

Yang Kai felt awkward, “Times have changed. Moreover, it was a misunderstanding at that time.”

Luan Feng growled, “You call killing a Divine Spirit a misunderstanding?”

Yang Kai corrected solemnly, “I didn’t kill him, it was Ruo Xi who did. If you want to blame someone, you should blame her.”

Luan Feng frowned, “This Queen is not looking to commit suicide. Furthermore, I don’t owe you anything now, so why should I help you again and again?”

Back then, Yang Kai took her to the Netherworld Sect where she ended up killing that Sect’s Great Elder. That incident would never have happened if Yang Kai hadn’t dragged her there in the first place.

That terrible business concluded not long ago, but now Yang Kai had come looking for her again. Luan Feng had to raise her guard against him as she was worried that this little bastard might do something reckless again.

“Lady Feng, why are you being so cold? It’s just a small favour for you,” Yang Kai grinned.

Luan Feng sighed deeply, “Speak, what do you want?”

It was hard for her to reject him since Yang Kai had already come here. However, she was only doing so out of consideration for the bigger picture. Yang Kai and Zhang Ruo Xi were close, and Luan Feng was still dreadfully afraid of Zhang Ruo Xi, the descendant of Heavens Order.

Yang Kai replied pensively, “I’d like to ask Lady Feng to deal with two Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters!”

“Who are they?” Luan Feng asked with a frown.

“The Sect Master and Vice Sect Master of the Northern Territory’s Seeking Passion Sect!”

“The Seeking Passion Sect of the Northern Territory?” Luan Feng scowled, “That is a top Sect, and this Queen has no grudges against them, why do I have to deal with them?”

“I don’t care! Lady Feng must help,” Yang Kai stuck his neck out.

“You…” Luan Feng laughed in anger, “Don’t play the rascal in front of me! It’s someone else who has offended you, not this Queen.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “Lady Feng, please help. It’s just two Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters, you can easily pinch them to death.”

Luan Feng snorted, “It’s easy for you to say. Although the Sects in the Northern Territory are not ruled over by any Great Emperors, The Wondrous Pill Great Emperor resides in the Northern Territory. If this Queen stirs up a fight in a Human Sect for no reason, how could he not move?”

Yang Kai remarked, “It’s true that the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor is in the Northern Territory, but he only pursues the Alchemic Dao and will not care about this small enmity.”

Luan Feng shook her head, “He may not care about other things, but he just might if this Queen gets involved. I can’t help you with this.”

“Since Lady Feng says so, I won’t force this issue,” Yang Kai sighed, revealing a helpless face.

Luan Feng was surprised. She looked at Yang Kai strangely, as she did not expect it to be easy to reject him. But soon, Luan Feng frowned, because she believed that Yang Kai would not give up just like this. He probably still had some wicked ideas in his sleeves.

Sure enough, after Yang Kai got up and headed towards the exit, he muttered, “There’s no need to rush now. Ruo Xi will definitely take revenge when she comes out and learns that her Sect was destroyed.”

“Wait!” Luan Feng hurriedly stopped him.

Yang Kai turned around and asked, “What else can I do for Lady Feng?”

Luan Feng gritted her teeth, “What did you say just now? Let me hear it again.”

Yang Kai sighed, “Lady Feng has heard everything, what else should I say?”

Luan Feng continued in a deep voice, “You just mentioned that her Sect will be destroyed, what do you mean?”

“What else could it mean? The Seeking Passing Sect wants to destroy Ice Heart Valley, the Sect which Ruo Xi originally hailed from. This Junior wanted to help but he cannot clap with just one hand, so he came to seek Lady Feng’s assistance. Unfortunately, it seems Lady Feng has her own concerns so this Junior will not try to impose any longer.”

“She came from Ice Heart Valley?” Luan Feng was shocked.

Ice Heart Valley and Seeking Passion Sect were both top Sects, and according to Yang Kai, it seemed that the two Sects were at war, with Ice Heart Valley being in imminent peril.

“Yes, didn’t I say so before?” Yang Kai responded.

Luan Feng pressed on with a solemn look, “Did she really come from Ice Heart Valley? Are you lying to me?”

Yang Kai replied seriously, “Why could I be lying? That crazy woman from last time was Ruo Xi’s Martial Aunt, Ji Yao. Did you pay attention to her cultivation technique when she attacked? She used only orthodox Ice Attribute Secret Arts and Techniques from Ice Heart Valley.”

Luan Feng thought back carefully and realized what Yang Kai said was true. Although Ji Yao did not fight much at the time, as a Divine Spirit, Luan Feng had naturally felt the Ice Attribute Emperor Qi and Ice Principles Ji Yao had cultivated.

Nevertheless, Zhang Ruo Xi did not show any signs that she had cultivated an Ice Attribute Secret Art. It was true though that Zhang Ruo Xi and Ji Yao seemed to have a close relationship.

Right now, Luan Feng was struggling with whether to believe Yang Kai’s words or not.

While she was still pondering, Yang Kai cupped his fists, “Lady Feng, I’ll leave first. When Ruo Xi comes out from the Blood Gate, please tell her that her Sect was destroyed and ask her to go back to the Northern Territory to seek revenge!”

Yang Kai’s words made Luan Feng’s breathing become faster.

If Zhang Ruo Xi was really from Ice Heart Valley, the last thing Luan Feng wanted to do was tell her such news. How could Luan Feng possibly answer if Zhang Ruo Xi asked her how her Sect was destroyed?

Could she tell Zhang Ruo Xi that she knew but stood by and did nothing?

“Stop right there!” Luan Feng hurriedly yelled at Yang Kai, who was about to leave the hall.
