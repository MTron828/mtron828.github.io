With his mind thrown into panic and facing imminent death, Bai Yun Feng suddenly snapped and shouted, “Yang Kai, I, your Father, will make sure you pay for this!”

“What the fuck is your problem!” Yang Kai cursed, extremely irritated.

“Hey hey...” Bai Yun Feng grinned and viciously retorted, “If it weren’t for you smashing the ground earlier, how could we have all gotten caught by this group of spiders?”

“If I didn’t do that how could you still be alive to whine about it now? All of you would have already been killed by Guo Yuan Ming and his gang already!” Yang Kai sneered, knowing that Bai Yun Feng couldn’t be reasoned with right now.

“This Young Lord is the first son of the famous Bai Family! Would they really have killed me?” Bai Yun Feng snorted. “As long as I had reported my true identity, they would definitely have taken me hostage to exchange with my Bai Family rather than murdering me.”

“Maybe you wouldn’t have died, but if Young Lady Qiu and Young Lady Luo had fallen into their hands... hah, I’m afraid they wouldn’t be able to hold on to their innocence anymore. I think that if they had been given a choice they would have still chosen to be stuck here in this spider sacks rather than being caught by those bastards.”

“Why should I give a damn about their innocence? I just want to live!” Bai Yun Feng roared loudly.

As soon as he had spoken these words though, he suddenly realized that it was not something he should have said out loud, suddenly becoming silent.

“Bai Yun Feng... I didn’t think you were so...” Luo Xiao Man’s sad voice softly echoed, an infinite amount of disappointment and disgust contained within it.

A woman’s purity was sometimes more important to her than her life. At that time, Luo Xiao Man would have gladly taken her own life rather than be humiliated if they had been caught by the Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land brutes.

Qiu Yi Meng quickly followed up, “Everyone always values their own life the most Xiao Man, don’t pay him any mind!”

Her voice didn’t contain any fluctuations, neither sadness nor disappointment, just coldness.

“Facing death, it seems those from the Bai Family can only become cowards!” Luo Xiao Man sneered.

“Hmph, say what you’d like.” Bai Yun Feng snapped back, not showing the slightest remorse. He had already completely offended these two women now so even if they managed to escape from this place, although they wouldn’t immediately become enemies, he would never associate with them again.

Yang Kai and Shan Qing Luo on the other hand were silently watching each other.

After a long time, Yang Kai wrinkled his brow, “If you wanted to leave, you could have just gone now, and that Spider Mother doesn’t seem to have any intention to retain you.”

Shan Qing Luo slowly shook her head, “But if I left just now, you wouldn’t be able to leave with me.”

Yang Kai’s expression suddenly cramped before it became serious, and he hesitated for a while before continuing, “Our friendship doesn’t seem to be close enough for you to care so much about me, just like Qiu Yi Meng said, people always care most about themselves.”

Shan Qing Luo however just smiled back at him.

“You’re not serious about all this, are you?” Yang Kai’s brown slightly wrinkled.

“I told you before, a woman who possesses the Poison Widow Body will only ever love a single man for her whole life, when have I ever not been serious towards you?” Shan Qing Luo sighed faintly, “If it weren’t for you barging into my Knowledge Sea earlier I really would be too lazy to care about your life or death. Little bastard, you’re so shameless and lustful, I really should kill you so you don’t taint all the innocent girls you’ll meet from now on, but with things progressing as far as they have, I really don’t have any other choice anymore.”

Shan Qing Luo really couldn’t bear to watch him die, that is, unless she could accept her Secret Art never reaching the grand accomplishment stage! Since this feeling of love had taken root in her heart, it growing into an all-consuming impulse was just a matter of time.

Once her emotions reached a peak, she would need to spend her first night with her beloved man.

Moreover, a Poison Widow Body woman, once in love, would be far more sentimental and devoted than an average woman.

This made this family of women bearing a truly tragic existence.

On the one hand, there was the death of her one love, while on the other there was the grand accomplishment stage of their Secret Art.

Even if they abandoned cultivating their Secret Art in favor of saving their love, it would not stop the attraction and temptation from consuming them.

Han Fei Yan, Shan Qing Luo’s mother, experienced such a situation, where she one night lost control of herself and slept with her husband, only to wake the following morning from this drunken stupor to discover what had happened, spending the rest of her life in pain and regret.

Yang Kai’s face became extremely solemn, deeply staring into Shan Qing Luo’s eyes, seemingly wanting to see into the depths of her heart, hoping to read her true thoughts.

Shan Qing Luo simply smiled and without hesitating took the initiative to unlock her Knowledge Sea’s defense, whispering softly, “If you don’t believe me, see for yourself!”

Yang Kai, though surprised, didn’t hesitate, plunging his Divine Sense directly into her Knowledge Sea.

Inside, he once again witnessed the sight of an endless ocean.

Above this vast sea, an image of Shan Qing Luo sat softly upon the wind, gazing towards Yang Kai’s Divine Sense, gently saying, “Do not touch my image, it represents my Soul. If you do, the consequences will be disastrous.”

“I know,” Yang Kai acknowledged softly.

If two Souls were to blend, they would be able to taste sweetness more than a thousand times more potent than if they had intimately embraced one another, but if their wills weren’t stable enough, the only result would be them losing themselves in this feeling, instantly becoming idiots.

Yang Kai, of course, understood this so he paid special attention not to act recklessly.

Shan Qing Luo’s Soul avatar quickly waved its hand, sending a ball of light into Yang Kai’s Divine Sense.

Absorbing all the information contained within this light sphere, Yang Kai gained intimate insight into all the emotional experiences of this devilish woman along with all her thoughts about their relationship without the slightest omission.

He also saw and comprehended the effects her special constitution and Secret Art would eventually have, realizing their future destiny.

As these innumerable scenes flashed before him, it was so vivid that it was like he was living them himself.

After a long time, Yang Kai slowly withdrew from her Knowledge Sea.

As their eyes met once more, Shan Qing Luo smiled happily, “Now do you believe me?”

This time, Yang Kai nodded firmly, never imagining that the Secret Art of this seductive woman had such special effects.

Smiling wryly, Yang Kai couldn’t help asking, “Should I say I am honored or that I have bad luck?”

He had confirmed that her feelings towards him were not an act, but in the end it still resulted in her needing his life.

Shan Qing Luo’s face suddenly became a bit dark, whispering under her breath, “The women in my family do not really want to kill their beloved man, but sooner or later this impulse becomes unbearable, so no matter how far they separate themselves, they will eventually find their way towards him, and whether consciously or unconsciously they will give their innocence to him while at the same time taking his life!”

Although sacrificing one’s life for the woman they loved was a romantic thought, but in the end it that was simply rhetoric, when the time really came, no man would truly be happy about such a fate.

“Have you never thought about solving this issue?”

“Naturally I have thought about it, but I have no idea how to even begin.” Shan Qing Luo slowly shook her head.

“En, let’s not talk about that first.” Yang Kai nodded, a bit forlorn, not discussing the matter any further.

“En.”

“Since you aren’t willing to leave me behind, we’ll just have to find a way to escape from here together.”

“After five days, when the Spider Mother wakes up again I’ll trying to convince her again.”

“If she doesn’t agree?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Then I’ll keep trying until she does.” Shan Qing Luo revealed a pouting expression, her face not showing any sign of worry.

On the other hand, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed, quietly asking, “If you could fully restore your strength, could you escape from here?”

“Naturally.” Shan Qing Luo nodded. “But right now my strength is only equivalent to a True Element Third Stage cultivator and it will take several months for me to fully heal.”

“I may be able to do something about that.” Yang Kai grinned meaningfully; after viewing all of Shan Qing Luo’s deepest thoughts, he now felt much more relaxed around her.

This seductress appeared to be the very definition of debauchery. Her name was world famous. Her methods were legendary, but in reality, before they had encountered each other, she was actually a pure blank slate.

Although she knew an incredible amount about the interactions between men and women, she had actually never had any personally experience in such matters.

“What are you planning to do?” Shan Qing Luo asked curiously.

Yang Kai subtly swiped his hand past his sleeve and extracted a small piece of Myriad Drug Cream, “Swallow this!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Shan Qing Luo glanced at him suspiciously, not knowing what kind of mysterious compound he was offering her, but she still opened her thin lips.

She softly licked the Myriad Drug Cream with her pink tongue.

“Quickly circulate your healing art to refine it!”

Even without Yang Kai say this, the moment the Myriad Drug Cream touched her lips, Shan Qing Luo’s face showed a clear look of surprise, hurriedly closing her eyes and circulating her Secret Art.

Thought her strength had fallen, the main reason for this was because of the backlash from her Secret Art, so in the end it was simply her suffering from internal injuries.

With the help of this small piece of Myriad Drug Cream, such injuries would be quickly restored.

Even though there was only five days before the Spider Mother would wake up again, using the Myriad Drug Cream Shan Qing Luo would absolutely be fully healed before then.

With nothing else to do, Yang Kai also began silently adjusting his state to its best.

As time passed, the momentum and True Qi fluctuations Shan Qing Luo radiated became stronger and more violent, obviously she was quickly recovering.

Noticing this change, the silent Qiu Yi Meng couldn’t help glancing towards Shan Qing Luo’s cocoon. Her pair of beautiful eyes flashed with a hesitant light, and she struggled with herself about what to do.

Having been trapped here for so many days, her strength had long ago been restored, but with so many Sixth-Order Monster Beasts lurking nearby, even though she could break free from this cocoon, she didn’t dare take such a reckless action.

But Shan Qing Luo’s sudden movement had let her once again see hope of survival.

Just... the conditions she had been given caused Qiu Yi Meng to hesitate.

After all, she was the first young lady of the famous Qiu Family, how could she possibly become the maidservant of some unknown junior? Forget about her exalted status, even Luo Xiao Man possessed a nobler position than this kid. If such an arrangement were to be spread out, what face would the Qiu Family and Purple Fern Valley have left?

On top of all that she would have to endure such a position for a whole year. Over the course of a year, who knows what that shameless little bastard would do.

Three days later.

Shan Qing Luo suddenly opened her enchanting eyes. A glistening light glowed within them, and her soft tender body seemingly contained a terrifying momentum.

“Better?” Yang Kai hurriedly asked.

“En.” Shan Qing Luo nodded delightedly and gazed at Yang Kai with great interest, “You’ve hidden your depths quite well, who knew you still had such an amazing treasure.”

However, after showering him with praise, she quickly reached out and viciously pinched Yang Kai’s chest, fiercely twisting as she ground her teeth, “You had such a good thing all along, how come you didn’t give it to me sooner? You little bastard, you really were still quite wary of me weren’t you?”

Looking embarrassed, Yang Kai could only laugh awkwardly.

If she had not freely shown him her most intimate thoughts earlier, how could Yang Kai have dared help this devilish woman restore her full strength?

“Since you’ve recovered, let’s leave here quickly.” Yang Kai lightly squeezed her delicate hand.

A look of hesitation crossed Shan Qing Luo’s face suddenly, quietly whispering, “Since we’ve come all this way already, I want to take some of the Spider Mother’s venom first, or else after taking you away this time, she will certainly become enraged and no longer allow me to come here.”

“Are you sure you can succeed?”

“Fairly, do you still have control over that spider?”

“En.”

“Good, then let it cause a scene.”

“Good!” Yang Kai nodded firmly, silently issuing new orders to the spider he had taken control of.
