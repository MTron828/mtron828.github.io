“What’s so powerful about this Heavenly Illusion Butterfly? Can we join forces to suppress it?” Liang Qiu asked, wiping his sweat nervously.

Lan Xun sneered, “Among all Ancient Divine Spirits, the Heavenly Illusion Butterfly’s attacks are considered the weakest, not even on par with a Tenth-Order Monster Beast!”

“Really?” Liang Qiu was overjoyed. If it was weaker than an average Tenth-Order Monster Beast, what was there to be afraid of? With so many Masters present, anyone could suppress it.

Lan Xun, however, continued, “But it is naturally proficient in illusions. When it appears in its entirety, it can convince its prey the universe is upside down the positions of the Heavens and Earth have swapped! Even a Great Emperor would find it hard to resist its illusionary techniques. None of the Ancient Divine Spirits can be underestimated!”

Liang Qiu’s face darkened, “I think… I should run away. This little girl keeps staring at me, making this Young Master feel uneasy.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Escape?” Lan Xun looked at him coldly, “Where can you escape? Xiao Qi has her eyes locked on you at this moment. Even if you escape to the ends of the world, you would still be dead!”

“Should I just wait to die then?” Liang Qiu retorted angrily.

Lan Xun responded, “If you don’t run away, you will be the only one who dies. If you escape, everyone present will suffer first!”

Everyone’s face changed after hearing this.

Xia Sheng questioned in surprise, “Princess Lan Xun, is this true?”

Lan Xun pressed on, “Don’t be fooled by the grace of the Heavenly Illusion Butterfly. Among the Ancient Divine Spirits, it is one of the most vicious and bloodthirsty.”

“Then what should we do now?” Yao Si asked. Although he was the son of a Great Emperor, he was not familiar with the Divine Soul Seal while Lan Xun seemed far more knowledgeable.

Lan Xun was silent for a while before she proposed, “There may be a way to stabilize the situation.” While she was speaking, she cast her beautiful eyes on Liang Qiu.

Liang Qiu frowned and replied defensively, “What are you looking at me for? It’s not entirely my fault that she became like this, right? Besides, I don’t have the ability to re-seal that Divine Spirit’s Soul!”

Lan Xun smiled faintly and went on, “You don’t need to re-seal it. Xiao Qi just wants you to die now. If you die… maybe she will be able to calm down by herself.”

“You want me to die?” Liang Qiu was horrified and fell back several steps, staring at Lan Xun as he choked, “You want me to die? What right do you have to ask me to die?!”

Lan Xun snorted, “This is the only way I can think of.”

“This is murder, murder I say! Women are indeed the most poisonous of all creatures!” Liang Qiu snarled.

It was obvious that Liang Qiu would not accept such a proposal from Lan Xun. He had just finally broken through to the Emperor Realm in this Shattered Star Sea, so he would naturally not be willing to give up his life.

“Little brat, you better watch your mouth!” Xiao Chen growled, “It is an honour for her Highness to ask for your life, don’t act ungrateful!”

Liang Qiu retorted, “Would you die if she asked you to die?”

Xiao Chen snorted, “The Princess has always been knowledgeable and considerate. She wouldn’t make such a request of me.”

“You’re just a coward evading the question, what right do you have to point fingers at this Young Master!?” Liang Qiu snapped contemptuously.

Xiao Chen was furious and he summoned a longsword into his hand, pointing it at Liang Qiu, “You’ll be dead today either way, so what’s the point of talking anymore idle nonsense!”

Liang Qiu was about to say something more, but Yao Si stepped in front of him and intervened, “Brother Liang is my friend, whoever wants his life will have to pass me first!”

Liang Qiu, who was standing behind him, did not expect Yao Si to stand up and speak for him in such a situation. Warmth welled up in him as he whispered, “Many thanks, Brother Yao Si, but this happened partly because of me. I’d better escape and lure this girl away. If I fail to do so, you should be careful too!”

Yao Si replied, “Although it was partly because of you, it was even more so because of the brat surnamed Yang.”

Liang Qiu was startled at first, but soon agreed, “Good, it was indeed because of that brat that this girl has become like this.” He then turned to yell at Yang Kai, “Boy, you can’t stay out of this!”

Yang Kai snorted, “Since when was I trying to stay out of this?”

Liang Qiu challenged, “Since this girl values you so much and even released that-whatever-Divine Soul Seal for you, why don’t you try to calm her down, maybe she can restore her consciousness!”

Liang Qiu had only suggested it casually, but Yang Kai’s expression changed and looked towards Lan Xun, “Junior Sister Lan, is it feasible?”

Lan Xun frowned slightly, “I don’t know. You can try, but it must be as soon as possible, the seal is about to be completely released.”

Yang Kai nodded and without any hesitation, darted towards Mo Xiao Qi.

In the void, countless pairs of eyes were looking nervously at Yang Kai. The buzz among the people here naturally passed into the ears of the surrounding Dao Source Realm cultivators, and although most did not understand the whole situation, they realized it was quite grave. Yang Kai’s initiative to approach Mo Xiao Qi to seek for a solution naturally aroused everyone’s attention.

As Yang Kai approached, he called out softly to Mo Xiao Qi, then yelled a few times without the slightest response. He immediately knew that Mo Xiao Qi had really lost all consciousness. He next tried using his Divine Sense to directly reach her consciousness, hoping she would notice him.

Soon, Yang Kai was near Mo Xiao Qi, reaching a hand out to touch her.

Everyone held their breaths in silence, the only sounds were the beating of the hearts of every person as they stared at Yang Kai, none of them willing to miss a single moment.

Just as Yang Kai’s hand was about to touch Mo Xiao Qi though, her tender body suddenly trembled and the Heavenly Illusion Butterfly fluttering around her spread its wings, spreading an invisible force.

Yang Kai instantly froze in place and his eyes lost focus.

“This is bad!” Lan Xun’s heart sank as at a glance, she knew that Yang Kai was hit by an illusion technique that he would not be able to pull himself out of.

“Waste! Looks like this Young Master still has to run!” Liang Qiu yelled with a disappointed expression on his face.

The next moment, however, Yang Kai’s dull eyes suddenly moved and he opened his mouth to spurt out a mouthful of blood before swiftly retreating, directly putting up a distance of a thousand meters between himself and Mo Xiao Qi. When he finally stopped, his face was white as a sheet, and his clothes were drenched in sweat.

“Fierce!” Yang Kai looked at Mo Xiao Qi with lingering fear. He had not felt anything at first, but the scenery in front of him had changed abruptly and his consciousness had been completely captured by the only object in his vision, a giant butterfly fluttering lightly in the void.

He knew it was the illusion of the Heavenly Illusion Butterfly, but he could not extricate himself from it.

If it were not for Soul Warming Lotus that played a role at the critical moment, giving him a trace of clarity, he would definitely have died.

Yang Kai’s Soul was extremely strong, even stronger than an ordinary First-Order Emperor Realm Master, but even he could not resist the illusion of the Heavenly Illusion Butterfly, so it was obvious that not a single person present would be able to compete against it. Furthermore, it seemed that Mo Xiao Qi’s seal was yet to be completely released, so the illusion he was struck with was still not at peak strength. Once this seal was undone though, just how many lives would be lost here?

If the elites from every corner of the Star Boundary perished here, the entire Star Boundary would not be able to restore itself for at least five hundred years.

“Junior Sister Lan, is there no other way to reseal it?” Yang Kai asked Lan Xun when he finally caught his breath.

Lan Xun looked desperate and shook her head slowly.

“Let’s run away quickly everyone, let destiny decide our fates…” Liang Qiu suggested with a darkened face. Among everyone, he was the one who wanted to escape the most; after all, Mo Xiao Qi had been staring at him since the beginning.

No one else had any better ideas, so they simply looked solemn after hearing these words and secretly began to gather their strength in preparation to flee at any time.

Right at that moment, a stranger’s voice suddenly called out, “If you don’t mind, shall this Old Master give it a try?”

His remark instantly attracted everyone’s attention, but their expressions changed weirdly when they discovered the owner of the voice.

Because the person was actually the old swindler.

In the present audience, except for Yang Kai and Mo Xiao Qi, both having several previous encounters with this old swindler, everyone was meeting him for the first time and didn’t know his saint-like charisma was nothing more than a facade.

If he had stood up and made such a statement with his previous image, he would undoubtedly be drowned in spit from all the curses hurled at him.

“You…” Lan Xun looked at the old swindler and a trace of doubt flashed across her beautiful eyes. She found something about him vaguely familiar, but her mind somehow went blank when she thought about it carefully.

Yao Si’s expression was solemn for a moment as well. Although he had different doubts from Lan Xun, he too, felt uneasy about this old swindler. He swept over the old man with his Divine Sense, but found he was unable to sense anything from him at all.

In other words, he could not detect the slightest existence of the old swindler with his Emperor Realm cultivation.

This discovery shocked him more than when Yang Kai had previously received Liang Qiu’s blow with just his physique.

“Where did you jump out from, old man? Why didn’t I see you earlier?” Liang Qiu’s eyes were bigger than eggs. If the old swindler did not take the initiative to speak out, Liang Qiu would never have noticed him.

“Haha, this old master has been here the whole time, but his insignificant cultivation must not have caught Young Master’s attention!” The old swindler smiled slightly.

“Strange! This is all just too strange!” Liang Qiu looked puzzled. Inexplicable events kept happening around him for some reason.

The old swindler was already making his way towards Mo Xiao Qi step by step as he spoke. It was admirable that even with Yang Kai’s unfortunate experience, he carried an undaunted look.

Yang Kai asked with a calm face, “Old man, don’t you sell Spirit Pills? How do you know about the Divine Soul Seal?”

Unlike the others, Yang Kai somewhat knew about this old swindler, and he was absolutely certain that he was a master of deception and cons. Who knew what trickery he had up his sleeves this time? It did not matter if he died, but it would be a big problem if it involved Mo Xiao Qi, or worse if it made her current condition worse.

The old man smiled slightly and assured him, “I have lived for a long time and am always learning new things. I know a little about everything. This Old Master is sold out of Spirit Pills at the moment, so he has to change careers.”

Yang Kai asked sceptically with a sullen face, “Now you have switched to studying sealing arts?”

“Do you know him?” Lan Xun glanced at Yang Kai in amazement and asked.
