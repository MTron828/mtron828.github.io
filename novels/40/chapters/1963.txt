After they determined that Yang Kai was trying to lift the seal on him, Zhou Yi couldn’t help shouting, “Boy, you dare!? Are you not afraid of the rules!”

Chu Fei also called out, “Yang Kai, you’re dead, you’re so dead! You dare try to lift the seal on you by force? That’s no different from not putting Protector Miao in your eyes! No one can save you now, you will have to face Protector Miao’s fury!”

Clearly taking pleasure in Yang Kai’s coming misfortune, Chu Fei wore a big grin as if he could not wait to see Yang Kai being tortured to death for his crimes.

But soon, his smile became stiff as very soon, the aura fluctuations coming from Yang Kai’s body became more and more apparent.

On the surface of his body, a rope-like chain of glowing runes appeared and began to flicker, looking like they would collapse at any moment.

The seal was about to be broken!

“How is that possible?” Chu Fei was shocked.

Yang Kai was just a Third-Order Origin King, and with his cultivation being sealed by a restriction that Senior Brother Pang had planted himself, it should be impossible for him to break free so easily.

“Not good!” Zhou Yi’s thoughts were sharper and quickly realized that, with the blood feud between him and Yang Kai already forged, if Yang Kai really was able to regain his cultivation and escape from the Bone Prison, the first one to die would undoubtedly be him!

What’s more, he was already seriously wounded right now, and his cultivation was sealed, so he wouldn’t even be able to fight back! Death was all but certain!

Realizing this, Zhou Yi’s face suddenly became panicked as he shouted loudly, “Junior Brother Yan!”

But as soon as he spoke, a popping sound rang out as the rune chain winding around Yang Kai’s body exploded into a million points of light and disappeared, while the aura of a Third-Order Origin King flared up.

Yang Kai stood up, and before Zhou Yi could shout a second time, he slammed his fist into the bone bars.

With a clatter, bone chips flew out and Yang Kai sprang out of his cell like a beast that had just been set free. Arriving in front of Zhou Yi at lightning speed, he reached out a hand and grabbed his neck tightly.

Zhou Yi went stiff and was unable to move. His eyes were filled with horror as he shivered while staring at Yang Kai who was right in front of him. No sound was able to escape from his mouth as the grip on his throat was choking the air from him.

Chu Fei and the others were so shocked that they backed away a few steps before falling on their butts.

Yang Kai stared at Zhou Yi indifferently before slowly forming a cruel grin on his lips.

“Junior Brother Yang...” Zhou Yi desperately managed to squeeze out a few hoarse words as he stared at Yang Kai imploringly and said with difficulty, “You don’t really want to kill me. Senior Brother indeed did something wrong before, but you and I are both fellow Sect Brothers... Forgive me, I’ll apologize to you! I won’t leak a word of what happened today, it’s still not too late for you to stop.”

“Do you think that’s possible? Fool!” Yang Kai looked at him contemptuously before exerting a slight force on his hand.

With a crack, Zhou Yi’s neck was snapped and twisted crookedly. Yang Kai then snatched his Space Ring before tossing away the lifeless corpse.

Not even bothering to check the contents, Yang Kai simply stuffed it into his pocket.

Inside the cell, Chu Fei and the others were already shivering violently. Laying limp on the ground, the trio watched Zhou Yi die in front of him and immediately understood that they were next. Looking at Yang Kai in a panic, endless regrets flooded their hearts.

They had not expected that after offending Yang Kai, their final outcome would be like this.

“Junior Brother Yang, forgive me! Senior Brother was wrong, please spare us!” Chu Fei cried and begged loudly for mercy. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Kai just stared at him coldly, his eyes filled with contemptuous disgust. Stretched out his hand, a Golden Blood Thread flew out and struck Chu Fei’s forehead.

A small, red dot appeared on Chu Fei’s forehead as he went stiff, paralyzed in place, the light of vitality quickly disappearing from his eyes.

The Golden Blood Thread flew out again and passed through the heads of the remaining two one after another, reaping their lives before immediately snatching their Space Rings.

After finishing this, Yang Kai turned his head and said, “Xian Yun, you stay here. I’ll be right back.”

“Where are you going?” Liu Xian Yun looked astonished; after all, from feeling the surge of power from Yang Kai’s body as he lifted the seal to him killing Zhou Yi and the other three, everything happened too fast.

Before she could even react, Yang Kai had finished everything.

Liu Xian Yun quickly realized that Yang Kai was going to flee from Blue Feather Sect today, otherwise, he would not have acted so ruthlessly. She did not have any opinion about this though as her feelings towards Blue Feather Sect were the same as Yang Kai’s.

If she had not been forced, how could she have inexplicably joined this Sect?

She did not have the slightest hesitation to abandon Blue Feather Sect, but she was worried that the two of them wouldn’t have the necessary strength to cut open a bloody path to freedom.

At this moment, when Yang Kai said he had somewhere to go, she couldn’t help asking for more details.

Yang Kai didn’t have time to explain and simply gave her a comforting look before his figure flashed and he entered the depths of the Bone Prison.

He didn’t know what the depths of the Bone Prison looked like, but the place where Wu Meng Chuan was being imprisoned was undoubtedly the most fortified location.

Yang hurriedly deeper into the prison, the cave itself becoming darker and damper as he walked. There were a number of obvious and concealed energy fluctuations around him, obviously coming from powerful Spirit Arrays that would lead to dreadful consequences once touched.

What surprised Yang Kai was that all the cultivators imprisoned in the Bone Prison looked at him indifferently, none of them even making any noise, as if they had already anticipated his arrival.

Some people were even guiding his way forward, allowing him to safely avoid the location where there were barriers and Spirit Array traps.

[These people... should be with Wu Meng Chuan!] Yang Kai figured they had been instructed by Wu Meng Chuan, so they were not surprised to see him arrive and even took the initiative to guide him.

Yang Kai observed secretly and was shocked to find that there were at least several dozen cultivators imprisoned in the depths of this Bone Prison, and although their cultivations were sealed, Yang Kai could still tell that they were not simple.

Each of these people gave Yang Kai an intimidating feel, indicating they were almost all Dao Source Realm experts.

[What exactly is Wu Meng Chuan’s origins? Who are all these people? Why had they been locked up here?]

Yang Kai had all kinds of doubts in his heart and faintly felt there was some kind of big conspiracy and secret behind this Blue Feather Sect.

After proceeding more than a thousand metres into the depths of the Bone Prison, Yang Kai arrived at its end.

Here, there was only a single cell made from some unknown material with only a single, small window one could look into, but thanks to the darkness, there was nothing to behold.

However, Yang Kai could still clearly feel that there was a life aura inside, one that seemed quite faint, however, and quite unlike what a powerful Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator should have.

“Boy, you made it here quite quickly. It seems your aptitude is even more astonishing than this old master imagined!” Wu Meng Chuan’s hoarse voice came out from the cell in front of him, tinged with surprise.

“Senior Wu?” Yang Kai asked tentatively.

“Indeed.”

“What should I do now?” Yang Kai asked hurriedly. Whether he could safely escape from Blue Feather Sect today or not would depend entirely on how powerful the man imprisoned here was, so Yang Kai naturally did not want to delay.

“I’ll teach you the method to unlock this cell now,” Wu Meng Chuan’s voice came out before a burst of Divine Sense flew towards Yang Kai’s forehead.

Yang Kai frowned but did not resist as he carefully accepted this technique.

This method was somewhat similar to the Secret Technique used to lift the seal on his own cultivation, but was more complicated.

Fortunately, Yang Kai easily comprehended it with his previous experience and got to work after half a stick of incense.

As Qi burst from Yang Kai’s body and rushed into the door in front of him, a clicking sound echoed as the invisible Spirit Arrays and barriers were slowly cracked.

A short time later, Yang Kai lifted his palm and patted the prison door.

A brilliant flash burst from the cell door as the last of the barriers was broken.

Wu Meng Chuan’s excited voice came out again, “Good, good, you are indeed the one this old master was waiting for. Now come and help this old master pull out these damn Spirit Suppressing Gold chains so this old master can regain his freedom!”

His voice was feverish with expectation, and even seemed to contain a trace of madness.

This made Yang Kai hesitate a little, not knowing if what he was doing was right or not. Perhaps, he was about to release a terrible monster that would bring about great consequences to him in the future.

But in this situation, he did not have any options, so after only a slight pause, he set his concerns aside.

Pushing open the cell door, Yang Kai was finally able to take a look inside with the help of the prison’s dim light.

After seeing Wu Meng Chuan’s appearance, Yang Kai could not help narrowing his eyes.

On the opposite wall was a human-shaped creature, but it seemed that all his limbs were pinned in place, so he could only maintain a limp posture.

It was impossible to see the original appearance of this humanoid creature as, currently, there was almost no meat on his bones, his cheeks were sunk in, and his sparse hair was a complete mess.

It was not much of an exaggeration to say he was a living corpse, without any life aura at all. Yang Kai couldn’t even tell if his blood was still flowing.

Even so, his eyes were extremely bright, almost burning with ravenous flames that would terrify any who stared into them.

“Senior Wu?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Heh heh heh...” The skinny old man who was pinned to the wall grinned, “There’s no need to doubt little boy, this old master is Wu Meng Chuan!”

“You’re...” Yang Kai could not bear to describe it. How much hatred did Wu Meng Chuan have with Blue Feather Sect for them to torture him to such an extent?

“This is the result of persecution, this old master could only endure the humiliation to survive,” Wu Meng Chuan said in a low voice that sounded akin to the wailings of a ghost.
