Chapter 1411, Five Element World Energy

The arrogance and methods of this woman surnamed Ye were something Qian Tong and the other masters here had profoundly learned of at a young age. As the former Sect Master of Star Emperor Mountain and the highest level master on Shadowed Star, she had reached a strength and status that only a handful of people in this world could compete with one on one.

She had casually commanded and scolded others, but had spoken gently to Yang Kai. Could this... be some kind of illusion?

Qian Tong and the others were unable to believe what they were seeing for a moment.

As if understanding Yang Kai’s concerns, this woman surnamed Ye did not push him, instead taking a step back and asking, “It’s alright. This Queen won’t force you to withdraw this barrier, but could you allow this Queen to exchange some words with that girl named Yang Yan? This Queen certainly has no malicious intentions toward you and only wants to confirm one thing.”

Sure enough, she was looking for Yang Yan! Yang Kai looked up at her and gently nodded, “If you just want to say a few words, then there is no problem. Please take this, Senior.”

Saying so, Yang Kai wiped his Space Ring and took out a communication artifact before tossing it up to the other party. He didn’t see how this woman surnamed Ye moved, but she was holding the communication artifact in the next instant.

Immediately, in the front of everyone’s eyes, this woman surnamed Ye closed her beautiful eyes and poured her Divine Sense into this communication artifact and contacted Yang Yan, who was deep inside the mountain.

Time passed slowly as everyone on the scene, regardless of cultivation or background, did not dare take a breath, seemingly afraid to disturb this woman.

But soon, her tender body actually began trembling slightly and her expression changed from calm to panic, panic to anxiety, then anxiety to excitement. In an instant, an overwhelming wave of Shi spread out uncontrollably with her as its centre.

Every Saint King Realm cultivator present trembled unstoppably under the influence of this Shi as they suddenly felt like they were wandering the line between life and death, as if all this woman surnamed Ye needed to do was think it and they would die.

The First and Second-Order Origin Returning Realm masters were forced to circulate their Saint Qi in order to resist this pressure as well, while only those who had reached the Third-Order weren’t seriously affected; however, that didn’t mean these top-level masters weren’t feeling shocked.

They were also Third-Order Origin Realm masters, the same as this Ye woman, but none of them could achieve what she had just done unconsciously.

This was clearly a sign that her Shi had reached the grand accomplishment stage! In other words, if not for the suppression of Shadowed Star’s World Principles, this woman may already have broken through and become an Origin King.

Any Origin Realm master who wanted to break through to the Origin King Realm first needed to have their Shi reach the grand accomplishment stage, but no one present other than this woman had achieved this.

Aware of the gap between them, everyone instantly felt a sense of inferiority. At the same time, Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng exchanged a knowing look, both of them secretly rejoicing that they had not acted out in anger just now and attacked. Even if it was two against one, neither of them was certain they would be able to escape unharmed if they were to fight this woman.

After what seemed like an unbearably long time, the Shi was withdrawn and the woman surnamed Ye opened her eyes, but now they were filled with radiant light and her pretty face had a dazzling, reddish glow to it, as if she had encountered an incredibly auspicious matter worthy of celebration.

Yang Kai could clearly tell that this woman’s breathing had quickened slightly, as had her heartbeat.

[What exactly did they talk about?] Yang Kai was filled with doubts.

Everyone else was just as curious as Yang Kai, wondering who or what existed here on Dragon Cave Mountain that could cause such a dramatic change in mood for such a master.

It must be known that masters such as this woman would not have violent mood swings unless they encountered an extraordinarily significant matter.

The woman surnamed Ye took a few deep breaths to calm her excitement before turning to Yang Kai again and asking softly, “Little brother, would you be willing to give this communication artifact to this Queen? This Queen can offer you appropriate compensation.”

Yang Kai wore a forced smile and replied, “There is no need for any kind of compensation for a trivial communication artifact. Senior can just keep it.”

By now, Yang Kai had determined that this woman had no malicious intentions towards Dragon Cave Mountain and most likely had some kind of connection to Yang Yan. In short, she was a friend, not an enemy.

After suddenly obtaining such a powerful ally, Yang Kai couldn’t be happier, so how could he even care about a simple communication artifact? The value of that thing wasn’t even worth mentioning as its only purpose was to help send messages. If he wanted another one, he could just ask Yang Yan to refine another.

“Since that’s the case, this Queen will accept with gratitude,” The woman surnamed Ye was not one for false platitudes so she accepted Yang Kai’s gift and stored it into her Space Ring with a happy smile upon her pretty face.

At this moment, everyone could see that this woman surnamed Ye had some kind of relationship with someone in Dragon Cave Mountain, causing Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng to look like they had just swallowed a dead fly. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

They had been exerting pressure on Yang Kai and Dragon Cave Mountain just now, but if this woman surnamed Ye really sided with Dragon Cave Mountain, they would have to retreat. Falling out with such a master for their subordinates who had died here was an extremely unwise matter that they would only take if they had lost their minds.

Realizing all this, Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng both began preparing to withdraw.

After all, the future was still long and it would be best to determine the exact relationship between this woman surnamed Ye and Dragon Cave Mountain first.

“He was really able to turn danger into safety?” Over on Clear Sky Sect’s side, Great Elder Mo Yu’s eyes shone brilliantly. He simply couldn’t believe what was happening right now. A moment ago he had still been teaching Chen Shi Tao to not take stock in ethereal concepts like luck and destiny, but all of a sudden, the seemingly impossible-to-defuse crisis he had been using as a teachable example had been casually resolved.

[Isn’t this little brat’s luck a bit too good?]

“I said that his luck has always been good, but it seems even I underestimated him!” Chen Shi Tao was also quite excited by this development. On the one hand, her friend Yang Kai had managed to overcome this danger, and on the other hand, her long-held belief in destiny had been proven correct.

Over on Coloured Glass Sect’s side, Dai Yuan was also secretly relieved while Yin Su Die’s pretty face had gone cold and was filled with displeasure.

She had been looking forward to the scene of Yang Kai powerlessly begging for mercy, but now this woman surnamed Ye had appeared out of nowhere and subdued all the masters on the scene.

Being denied such a good show at the last moment, how could Yin Su Die be reconciled?

[Wastes!] She sullenly cursed in her heart, but was helpless to do anything. She had only just broken through to the Origin Returning Realm so whether it was in terms of cultivation or status, she was among the lowest-ranked of all the masters present. She simply had no right to speak here.

“What’s wrong? Is there some kind of extraordinary treasure here that you all want? Why are you still gathered here?” The woman surnamed Ye wore a cold look on her pretty face and shouted as she swept her gaze across the crowd after speaking with Yang Kai.

Hearing this, many of the masters here unconsciously took a step back as they revealed awkward looks, but Qian Tong simply laughed heartily and replied, “Senior Sister Ye must be joking, there is no such treasure here.”

“Since that’s the case, you can all leave, or do you want this Queen to expel you personally?”

“We’ll leave, we’ll leave!” Qian Tong said quickly before nodding to Yang Kai gently.

Yang Kai returned a grateful look.

With Qian Tong taking the lead, the other masters from the forces that had only come here to join in the fun naturally didn’t plan on staying, all of them cupping their fists to the woman before turning around to depart. Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng saw this and knew that they alone could not salvage this situation so they similarly planned to depart, despite their unwillingness.

Just as this great storm seemed to be settling down and dispersing though, a sudden change occurred.

The World Energy aura in the surrounding region suddenly became turbulent and extremely disordered.

Everyone showed a horrified expression as they instinctively thought that the woman surnamed Ye had suddenly decided to attack, but upon looking back, they became even more surprised.

Because even the woman surnamed Ye had gone pale and was just as shocked as all of them.

She had not taken action, it was the world itself that had undergone some kind of change!

*Hong long long...*

A violent rumbling suddenly filled the air, the source of which seemed to be both close and far, making it impossible to determine its true origin, but as everyone looked up, their eyes shrank in shock.

Because high up in the sky, where the Emperor Garden was located, bolts of silvery lightning were filling the air, as if it was the end of the world.

The Emperor Garden had been floating directly above Dragon Cave Mountain since it first appeared, but it had remained silent for so long. The masters of Shadowed Star had once joined forces to try to reach it, but had ultimately failed and suffered heavy losses in the process.

Eventually, everyone came to the conclusion that although the Emperor Garden had appeared, it had not yet opened and no one could force their way in.

All of the great forces had deployed people to Heavenly Fate City to monitor the movements of the Emperor Garden and report back immediately if it were to open.

But no one had anticipated that after remaining silent for many months, the Emperor Garden would suddenly come to life at this moment. No one knew what this change represented; after all, the Emperor Garden was the private residence of the Starry Sky Great Emperor, so the secrets it held were known essentially to no one.

At this moment, in the place where the Emperor Garden was located, densely packed bolts of lightning filled the air, seemingly tearing apart to sky as they shot back and forth.

As the movements in the sky became more instant, the World Energy aura also became more and more disordered and violent until eventually, parts of it transformed altogether into a five-coloured radiance that rapidly rose up and flew towards the Emperor Garden.

“Five Element World Energy!” Someone called out in alarm. There were many masters present, so naturally when they saw this five-coloured light, they realized it was a convergence of the five elemental auras and Shadowed Star’s ambient World Energy.

Watching from down below, no one could help but show looks of awe and amazement.

All of them watched as these masses of five-coloured light began to condense together as they floated high up into the sky.

These clusters of Five Element World Energy seemed to be moving slowly but, in fact, they were all converging towards the Emperor Garden at incredible speed, as if drawn in by some invisible attraction.

Gradually, the Emperor Garden, which had originally been visible to the naked eye, became shrouded in a massive cloud of five-coloured light, but at the same time, louder and louder rumblings rang out from it, causing the entire world to tremble.

“Is the Emperor Garden opening?” Someone muttered, and although this was just a baseless and unfounded guess, it still caused everyone’s eyes to light up.
