Despite the middle-aged man’s strenuous effort, he couldn’t convince those standing guard at the gate to allow him to pass.

He was left without a better choice and could only offer them a bribe. This barren land had no valuable treasures, and he couldn’t offer them anything other than the Monster Cores of Monster Beasts slain by him.

Monster Cores were a pretty hard currency in the Ancient Wild Lands, as anyone could use them to raise their strength. Thus, upon receiving these gifts, the two beamed in delight, and after they discussed it for a moment, one of them turned around and went inside. He had obviously gone to make a report!

The dark python who had taken a humanoid shape had finally experienced and understood the meaning of the saying, ‘Meeting the king of Hell wasn’t difficult, but dealing with his lackeys was’.

The man started exchanging pleasantries with the others at the gate to pass time, while he vowed inwardly, [Once I get rewarded for this great contribution, I’ll surely teach you all a memorable lesson and make you regret putting on such a haughty front. I’ll make you spit out everything you took from me!]

After a short while, the one who had gone to make a report came back and cupped his fist at the middle-aged man, saying, “Today, Sir is in a pretty good mood and doesn’t mind meeting you. Go inside!”

The middle-aged man expressed his thanks to them then started climbing up the mountain, leaving the two guards playing with the few Monster Cores in their hands in delight.

There wasn’t anyone to guide the middle-aged man, but he could still make his way through with ease, as this wasn’t his first visit. He quickly crossed several checkpoints and reached the peak of the mountain where a large palace was built with a rough design completely different from the ones commonly seen in the Star Boundary. It was just a large mass of boulders piled up together without an ounce of beauty.

Moreover, there was a large sculpture of a mighty-looking galloping rhinoceros outside the palace.

This was the true body of Monster King Xi Lei. He had just been an ordinary rhinoceros who managed to cultivate to the peak of the Twelfth-Order. Who knew what kind of fortuitous encounter had helped him accomplish this great feat, but nonetheless, he had now become the ruler of a large expanse of the Ancient Wild Lands with over a hundred thousand Monster Race subordinates under him.

There were only thirty-two beings in the same realm as Xi Lei in all the Ancient Wild Lands. They all had their own territories and wouldn’t invade nor assault each other, and they were all under the jurisdiction of the Four Great Divine Spirits.

Every Divine Spirit had eight Monster Kings at the peak of the Twelfth-Order under them, while Monster Kings had Monster Commanders and Monster Generals, as well as an innumerable number of Monster Beasts below the Twelfth-Order. One could well imagine how dangerous the Ancient Wild Lands were. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However, the Humans outside were obviously oblivious to this and they only knew that the Ancient Wild Lands was a chaotic land fraught with dangers. They were unaware that deep within the Ancient Wild Lands, it had already developed its own social order.

After the middle-aged man reached the palace, the Monsters guarding the gate just checked his identity then allowed him in.

It couldn’t be said that they were careless, as it was pretty much impossible for the middle-aged man to wreak havoc in the face of the Xi Lei with his low cultivation. The Monster Race had always been pretty casual about customs and they didn’t attach great importance to them.

If this was a Sect of the Human Race, then it wouldn’t have been so easy for a Dao Source Realm cultivator to meet a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master.

After the middle-aged man entered the palace, soft music, light singing, as well as decadent noises reached his ears, taking him aback and almost making him assume he walked into the wrong place.

But, when he raised his eyes to take a look, he sighted a muscular man sitting cross-legged at the end of the hall with a table decorated with the corpse of a Monster Beast in front of him, a bloody corpse that died not long ago. The muscular man was holding the corpse of the Monster Beast and gorging himself with blood dripping off the corners of his mouth. It was a pretty ghastly sight, yet the man was eating with gusto with his eyes shining with a scarlet gleam.

The legs of the middle-aged man went soft and he had almost escaped on the spot.

He had heard that Monster Kings were fond of devouring their subordinates’ flesh, but he didn’t take it for more than a mere rumour. This was a sight he had never expected to see.

The muscular man was obviously none other than Monster King Xi Lei. The middle-aged man had once seen him from afar and he could recognize him with a glance.

Xi Lei took a few more bites of the meat then laughed heartily out of delight.

Two women clad in revealing clothes with pretty much all their skin exposed were next to the muscular man, serving him and fawning over him. They were both endowed with pretty good figures hidden behind light gauze, making for a breathtaking sight!

Once Xi Lei let out a peal of laughter, one of the women took advantage of this chance to stuff one of the peeled grape-like spirit fruits on the table into his mouth.

Xi Lei was pleased by this and he embraced the woman and started having his way with her.

After a short moment, the woman was also left with a bloody mouth, but she wasn’t displeased by this, rather, she licked off the blood with her little scarlet tongue in delight.

The middle-aged man observed this in trepidation and longing, wondering when he would obtain a cultivation equal to Xi Lei. At that time, beauties would throw themselves at him and he would also get to enjoy such a delightful experience.

In the hall below the table, there were a few women with slim waists and plump bottoms clad in revealing clothes singing and dancing.

The middle-aged man observed them in a daze with his eyes rolling around ceaselessly. He couldn’t make up his mind about which beauty he should observe.

The beauty embraced by Xi Lei a while ago had also taken notice of the middle-aged man and she curled up the corners of her mouth into a smile and threw a flirtatious glance at him, which almost stole his Soul.

The woman leaned closer to Xi Lei’s ears and started whispering to him.

At this moment, Xi Lei finally raised his eyes to look at the middle-aged man and he waved his hands, sending the women around him away.

The middle-aged man didn’t dare to slight this Master and hurriedly walked forward with a solemn look, then knelt and spoke, “Greetings, Sir. My name is Wu Zhui.”

Xi Lei asked in a deep voice, “Is it you who has claimed that you have something to report?”

“Indeed!”

“Speak. What is so important about it that you had to see me personally? If it’s just a trivial matter, then you may not keep your head.”

Wu Zhui’s expression darkened and didn’t dare to delay, quickly explaining, “Sir, it’s related to the Blood Gate.”

“The Blood Gate?” Monster King Xi Lei stood up and the few female Monsters in the hall covered their mouths and stared at Wu Zhui with their pretty eyes.

The Blood Gate was a pretty pivotal place for all beings of the Ancient Lands. It was rumoured that the Blood Gate contained a great secret, which could awaken their bloodline power and allow them to evolve into Divine Spirits.

Even though Xi Lei was an apex Twelfth-Order Monster Race, he still couldn’t repress his desire to enter the Blood Gate. If he could become a Divine Spirit, then he would get to change the current hierarchy of the Ancient Lands, which had remained unchanged for innumerable years. The Four Great Divine Venerables would become the Five Great Divine Venerables.

“All of you, leave!” Xi Lei waved his hand and shouted, realizing that this news was crucial and making him lose his calm.

“Sir…” One of the two females who served him a while ago leaned against him, putting on a pitiful look. She obviously wanted to stay here to listen to them.

Xi Lei simply turned his head around and glared at her with his blood-red eyes.

The body of the female stiffened and she didn’t dare to make any more presumptuous actions. She quickly retreated, followed closely by the others.

“Speak. What happened to the Blood Gate?” Once the crowd had left, Xi Lei questioned in a deep voice.

Wu Zhui quickly replied, “An unusual incident has occurred at the Blood Gate.”

“What kind of unusual incident?” Xi Lei asked in surprise.

Wu Zhui quickly told him everything he knew, and upon hearing him out, Xi Lei furrowed his brows with a bewildered look on his face.

This unusual incident was pretty eye-catching, and his subordinate had no reason to falsify it. He surely wasn’t the only one who had seen it as well, so verifying the claim would be as simple as questioning other Monsters Race members who were in the vicinity of the Blood Gate. But, what did this unusual incident mean?

A long time had passed since the Blood Gate appeared and it didn’t go through any changes since then. It had always been quietly sitting atop the peak of the mountain, yet on this day, it emitted radiant scarlet light that soared into the Heavens!

No matter what, this was a vital piece of news for any inhabitant of the Ancient Lands.

Xi Lei paced back and forth in the hall for a while with an indecisive look on his face, only stopping after a long while, “You should go with me to see the Divine Venerable and tell him everything you have seen.”

“The D-D-Divine V-V-Venerable…” Wu Zhui had almost bitten his tongue.

The Ancient Lands had four Divine Venerables, and Xi Lei served one of them. The Four Great Divine Venerable were rarely seen, and ordinary members of the Monster Race wouldn’t ever lay eyes upon them in their lifetime. Even the thirty-two Monster Kings couldn’t get to see them whenever they wanted.

Wu Zhui had never imagined that he would one day get to meet a Divine Venerable.

But he quickly got over his shock and became overwhelmed with excitement. Since he could see the Divine Venerable, then the news brought by him was surely anything but insignificant. He would get to lay down a great merit and make his rise from this day.

He didn’t hope to get a lot. After all, he was pretty weak, and he could only hope to get some rewards that could propel him to the rank of a Monster General. At that time, he could also get some subordinates and rule over a whole mountain, which would be a lot better than living on the move, scraping out a living each day.

After Wu Zhui composed himself, he cupped his fists and spoke, “I’ll heed Sir’s commands.”

“Let’s go!” Xi Lei was also pretty impatient. He had already decided to see the Divine Venerable, so there was no need to hesitate now. He summoned a wind that engulfed Wu Zhui and rushed out of the gate.

“Other than you… Who else knows of this?” Xi Lei suddenly asked.

Wu Zhui said, “I’m surely not the only person who has seen this unusual incident related to the Blood Gate, but I rushed over quickly to report it to Your Excellency, so I don’t know who else might know of it.”

Xi Lei nodded lightly, knowing well that Wu Zhui wasn’t mistaken. That unusual sight was pretty eye-catching and he surely wasn’t the only one who had taken notice of it. The other Monster Kings were probably also aware of this by now, and they would surely be rushing to their respective Divine Venerables to take credit for this.

Wu Zhui’s eyes flickered, mulling over something for a moment, before letting out a sigh, “Unfortunately, I have an insignificant and lowly status, so I was obstructed for a long time by the two guards at the mountain gate when I asked for an audience with Sir. Those two didn’t allow me to go in and I had to part with all of my wealth just to get them to agree to report my presence,” saying so, he looked nervously at Xi Lei and said. “Did I do something wrong?”

Xi Lei’s face darkened as he snorted, “They’re getting more outrageous with each passing day!”

Saying so, he suddenly thrust his fist down.

*Kacha*

Along with a thunderous crack so loud that it would leave one’s eardrums ringing in pain, a thick lightning bolt fell from the sky, rushing towards the ground.

After a short moment, a loud rumble echoed, accompanied by two sudden miserable shrieks.

Wu Zhui lowered his head to take a look, only to discover that the mountain gate was a total mess with a large hole left there. As for the two Monsters guarding the gate? They had already disappeared.
