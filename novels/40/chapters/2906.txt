Yang Kai grunted as blood leaked from his seven orifices. His already pale complexion suddenly became even paler, and he shuddered unsteadily as if he might fall down at any time.

The young man was taken aback and quickly retrieved his Divine Sense.

He had no malice towards Yang Kai, but he had to clarify something, and it was inconvenient for him to investigate due to his identity, so he could only intercept him here.

He just wanted to use some small means to investigate Yang Kai but did not expect the latter to fight back so desperately, and to even somewhat succeed in resisting.

This was quite awkward.

After his first move failed, the young man would not be able to make another one, so he flickered and appeared a thousand metres away as if he had never moved.

Standing where he had from the start, Yang Kai glared at this newcomer in anger, pushing the power of the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus to its limit to protect his Soul and Knowledge Sea. He would not let slip any secrets unless the other party was willing to knock him down.

The opponent was definitely capable of this, but Yang Kai would not give in easily.

This scene resembled the scene of a rabbit facing its predator, a falcon that was about to swoop down at it from the sky. No matter how much he bared his teeth, it would not do much, and the falcon would still grab the rabbit with its talons, fly up high, and drop it to its death on the ground.

The young man watched Yang Kai for a short time before suddenly letting out a sigh and, turning his gaze to the sky, muttered as if he was talking to the air, “The weather is nice today.”

After saying so, he stepped forward and suddenly disappeared from Yang Kai’s field of vision without a trace.

Yang Kai maintained his vigilance, sweeping his Divine Sense to cover the surrounding several kilometres for quite some time before he was convinced that the young man was really gone. Only then did he let out a sigh of relief and relax his guard.

An unimaginable feeling of exhaustion swept over Yang Kai like a tide in the next moment, causing him to stagger in the air involuntarily and almost fall on his head.

With difficulty, he steadied himself before reaching up to wipe the blood from his face before frowning.

That person suddenly intercepted him and even used a Divine Ability to probe into his Knowledge Sea, but in the end, it had only been some loud thunder and no rain, which puzzled and surprised Yang Kai.

Did he come here deliberately just to say ‘the weather is nice today?

That was obviously impossible.

After thinking for a while though, the frown on Yang Kai’s face gradually dissipated and was slowly replaced by a laugh. The more he laughed, the more cheerful he became, and in the end, every bit of worry and burden in his heart were completely relieved.

Yang Kai now somewhat understood the matter regarding that person.

He had taken away the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld from the fifth layer of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, and as the true master of Star Soul Palace and the owner of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, the Great Emperor must have noticed something, but he could not fully understand it. That was why he needed to investigate.

However, Yang Kai was not a Star Soul Palace disciple, and he was only allowed to enter the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda because of the previous agreement, so neither the Great Emperor nor the Elders could request Yang Kai to proactively explain his experiences inside.

If Yang Kai was just an ordinary Emperor Realm Master, there may be many Secret Techniques that could be used by Star Soul Palace that would make him unknowingly reveal the existence of the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld, but as of now, Yang Kai was also an Azure Sun Temple Elder. As the overlord and guardian of the Southern Territory, Star Soul Palace could not throw its weight around haphazardly in this situation.

Therefore, the Great Emperor took action personally, and the location he picked was not inside Star Soul Palace’s borders, but just outside, a way to silently indicate that, officially, this had nothing to do with Star Soul Palace.

He did not report his origins due to the same consideration, and even though Yang Kai clearly identified him, he did not expose him, the two of them maintaining a kind of mutual understanding to reduce the issues here to a minimum.

The matter was now settled. The Great Emperor himself failed to obtain any useful information, or it could be said that the Great Emperor did not force Yang Kai to reveal what he did and knew. After this incident, Star Soul Palace would no longer pursue Yang Kai regarding his experience and gains in the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda.

In other words, Star Soul Palace and Bright Moon Great Emperor would close one eye about anything Yang Kai took away from the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda.

It was precisely because Yang Kai realized this that his mood was suddenly lifted.

He was somewhat worried before because he took something of theirs without permission. As such, in the future, he could only use the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld in secret when he took it back to High Heaven Palace, and its existence could not be exposed openly. But with what happened just now, the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld could now be used openly, and even if Star Soul Palace found out later, they would not be able to say anything.

After thinking about it carefully, Yang Kai felt that he should actually be grateful to the Great Emperor for all his consideration. With the Great Emperor’s strength and abilities, it would not be impossible for him to forcefully break through the defences of Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea, but he stopped after just touching upon it, fully displaying the demeanour of a Senior Master.

Yang Kai thus had a good impression of him.

The phrase ‘the weather is nice today’ was probably also the Great Emperor’s acknowledgement of his helplessness and awkwardness.

Yang Kai kept laughing, but he suddenly could not laugh anymore. He touched under his nose and felt warm blood trickling down incessantly. The consumption of his Spiritual Energy during this period was too great, especially with his Soul already in an injured and exhausted state. If he was not protected by the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus, he would already have degenerated into an idiot.

…..

For a journey that would usually only take a few days, Yang Kai took more than ten, staggering and stumbling all the way.

The former site of Thousand Leaves Sect was still just a blasted ruin. Yang Kai arrived at the familiar mountain valley, surged his Space Principles, and entered Emperor Heaven Valley.

Emperor Heaven Valley was an independent Small World. Currently, apart from Yang Kai, no one else in this world could freely enter and exit this place.

But at this moment, there was a figure near the entrance of the Emperor Heaven Valley.

The man had Emperor Realm cultivation, and he was drawing something on the ground of an open space, frowning sometimes, widening his eyes sometimes, then smiling sometimes. The expressions on his face were ever changing.

He seemed to be immersed in his own world, unable to extricate himself. He did not even notice when Yang Kai approached.

It was not until Yang Kai cleared his throat lightly that this man woke up from his dazed focus. At first, he frowned, as anger appeared on his face, he was obviously mad for being interrupted, but after seeing Yang Kai, all the displeasure disappeared immediately and he greeted him with a smile, “Palace Master!”

“En,” Yang Kai nodded lightly, glancing casually at the things he drew on the ground, and found that the drawings had something to do with the Cross-Territory Space Array. There was only one person in all of High Heaven Palace who would be able to immerse himself in the world of Spirit Arrays to the point of not being able to extricate themselves: Chief Array Master Nanmen Da Jun.

When Yang Kai sent Bian Yu Qing back to the Northern Territory to join High Heaven Palace, he asked her to relay a message to Nanmen Da Jun to come here. It seemed that the Emperor Array Master had been here for a while, and decided to do some studying on his own while waiting for Yang Kai.

“Did you bring it?” Yang Kai asked.

Nanmen Da Jun froze for a moment but recovered quickly. Taking out a jade slip, he handed it to Yang Kai and explained, “Palace Master, I engraved all the information about the Spirit Array inside. You can read it slowly during your journey, but Palace Master, I have to remind you that this Spirit Array is quite wicked. Whoever arranged this Spirit Array must not be a good person. It would be best to be on guard.”

“Noted.” Yang Kai nodded.

Nanmen Da Jun took out something else next. Resting on the palm of his hand was an extraordinary-looking, smooth, shimmering spindle-shaped object, one he handed to Yang Kai.

“What’s this?” Yang Kai asked curiously.

Nanmen Da Jun chuckled, “Didn’t Palace Master ask Hou Yu to refine a flight type artifact? This is it.”

“So fast?” Yang Kai took the flight type artifact in surprise and examined it a bit before revealing a shocked expression, “Is this an Emperor Grade Artifact?”

It had not been long since he brought Hou Yu back to High Heaven Palace, and although he assigned her the task of refining a flight type artifact for him, Yang Kai thought it would take a few years to refine a decent ship. But how long had it been? It hadn’t even been half a year since he made the request, probably three or four months at most.

Nanmen Da Jun smiled, “Even though Xiao Hou doesn’t have the best character, she’s definitely a Grandmaster Artifact Refiner, and we have no shortage of materials in High Heaven Palace now. After giving her so much to work with, how could she not refine something good? Xiao Hou also said that there’s still room for improvement for this artifact, so when Palace Master has the time, you should let her upgrade it for you.”

“She’s not still thinking about escaping, right?” Yang Kai smiled slightly, slowly sinking his mind into the flight type artifact in his hand, revealing a look of satisfaction.

Nanmen Da Jun snickered, clearly taking pleasure in another’s misfortune as he explained, “The three Monster Kings are taking turns guarding her. If she dared to escape, they would have broken her legs. The Monster Kings are not to be trifled with.”

The Monster Kings’ respect was only for Yang Kai, and also Heaven’s Order and the Divine Spirit Sources she could grant them access to, but they had no reservations towards any other; even Emperor Array Masters, Emperor Alchemists, and Emperor Artifact Refiners were nothing in the eyes of the Monster Kings. There were no such titles among the Monster Race. To them, only the strongest deserved respect.

With the three Monster Kings taking turns to guard Hou Yu, she probably could only dream of escaping from High Heaven Palace for the rest of her life.

Yang Kai could not help laughing when he imagined Hou Yu’s aggrieved expression in his mind. However, Hou Yu was worthy of the title of Grandmaster. Yang Kai could already tell that this artifact was extremely good even before having the chance to refine it. Once he did refine it, it would certainly serve him well.

However, for Yang Kai the other functions of this artifact did not matter. What mattered most was its ability to carry him from one point to another at speed. As long as it was fast enough, the other functions weren’t important.

“Did Hou Yu christen it?” Yang Kai asked. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Nanmen Da Jun thought for a while before replying, “Flower Clouds Shuttle. En, she said that if Palace Master doesn’t like the name you can change it. It’s just a name after all.”

“Let’s just call it the Flower Clouds Shuttle.” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

While talking, Yang Kai suddenly reached out and summoned something before handing it to Nanmen Da Jun, “Take this back.”

“What is this?” Nanmen Da Jun took it curiously and found that the thing Yang Kai handed over was a small box, but it was not an ordinary one by any means because it clearly exuded a type of ancient aura. It was evidently something that had been passed down from a long time ago, and should be a good artifact.
