Inside the cave, Wei Wu stared towards Yang Kai, his expression, illuminated by the strange light stone, becoming more and more sinister.

Yang Kai continued staring back at him, his face as indifferent as before.

Wei Wu’s face twitched a few times, seemingly annoyed that Yang Kai didn’t show even a trace of fear, suddenly feeling his little game was boring and snorting, “I can convince Master to lift the seal on you, but in return you must hand over your Soul Brand and serve me from now on.”

After a pause, he added, “Here, you are unable to use your strength, and there is crisis all around, but as long as you surrender your Soul Brand, I will naturally protect your safety in the future and ensure you will not suffer a loss. Who knows, if you’re lucky, perhaps in the future you can also join Sword Union!”

“Are you finished yet?” Yang Kai interrupted him impatiently.

Wei Wu was stunned and stopped talking.

“If you’re finished then please leave,” Yang Kai waved his hand and said. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Wei Wu’s face sank in that instant, slowly standing up with a cold smirk on his face, “Little brat, don’t refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a loss. You’d best reconsider your answer or else you may regret it.”

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, “I don’t know what you want my Soul Brand for, but it’s absolutely impossible for me to hand control of my life over to another; moreover, you’re not qualified to even ask.”

“You’ve got guts little brat!” Wei Wu laughed, seemingly having heard something quite funny, his voice filling with a threatening tone, “Tell me, if I were to kill you here, who would know?”

Yang Kai expression sank as he stared back at Wei Wu.

Although the mysterious old man had said before that no one was allowed to make trouble here, who knew if he would actually protect everyone’s safety?

Did he have any reason to go that far?

“Your two Junior Sisters owe me graciousness. For a simple misunderstanding, you actually want to kill me?” Yang Kai asked coldly, his murderous intent slowly rising.

“It is precisely because you showed them graciousness that you should be damned. If you had just minded your own business, they would have already died ...” Wei Wu snarled, speaking halfway before suddenly realizing that he had said too much and quickly stopping.

In the dark, the two men’s four eyes met.

Yang Kai had thought Wei Wu hated him because he was interested in He Zao or He Miao and was worried Yang Kai would become a potential rival, but now it seems things were more complicated than that.

On the contrary, it was as if Wei Wu was quite eager to see He Zao and He Miao die.

[What kind of hidden secrets does this involved?] Yang Kai thought but had no concrete answers. Though, he had some guesses. [It must likely be due to some kind of internal dispute within Sword Union].

Guessing this much, Yang Kai was disinclined to think about it further.

However, because Wei Wu had let slip a few words too many, the temperature inside the cave had dropped significantly.

“Little brat, if you want to live, you’d best forget everything that just happened now. Otherwise, I’ll rip your corpse into ten thousand pieces!” Wei Wu coldly threatened after a long silence before turning to leave.

However, just as he turned around, a wisp of light shot out from his sleeve, like a cold snake that accurately sliced through the darkness towards Yang Kai’s position and swiftly wrapped around his neck.

“Heh, only dead people won’t reveal secrets!” Wei Wu chuckled flicking his wrist, collecting the cold string of light back.

Unexpectedly, it was an incredibly sharp soft sword.

Turning back, Wei Wu prepared to deal with Yang Kai’s body in order to ensure there were no clues left behind.

But just as he turned back, he saw a figure crash towards him. Under the soft light of his illumination stone, Wei Wu clearly saw Yang Kai’s face distorted in rage, a fresh wound circling his neck out of which a copious amount of golden blood flowed.

Wei Wu called out unconsciously, unable to understand why Yang Kai hadn’t died!

This youth had his strength sealed and was hit by the sneak attack of a Third Order Saint, there shouldn’t have been any possibility of failure.

Wei Wu showed a panic-stricken look as if he had just seen a ghost.

His reaction was quick though, realizing the situation he was in and quickly condensing his strength, the soft sword in his hand suddenly bursting out with a dazzling cold light that shrouded Yang Kai’s figure.

Yang Kai on-the-other-hand gave off a thick malevolent aura, his entire temperament undergoing a drastic change from a moment ago. Now, he most closely resembled a wild beast that had suddenly awoken from a long slumber, completely ignoring the shroud of light that was approaching him as he ploughed straight through it towards Wei Wu while lifting clenched fist.

*Hong...*

Yang Kai’s fist landed square on Wei Wu’s face, the latter only hearing the sound of bone breaking as his nose collapsed inward and his mouth filled with the taste of blood. Dazed by this blow, Wei Wu was knocked backwards.

When he was hit by this fist, Wei Wu was shocked to find that his Saint Qi did not play any protective role, as if it hadn’t existed at all. This punch’s fierce power had directly crossed his protective Saint Qi and penetrated his bones, shattering them in the process.

He was sent flying by this punch.

Wei Wu’s body bounced a few times before slamming into the cave wall, causing stone debris to fly about as he finally came to a halt, sprawled out on the ground.

Not daring to delay, he quickly climbed back up, but before he could get his bearings, a big hand reached out from in front of him and gripped his neck before slamming him back down to the ground.

Yang Kai gasped for breath, his eyes becoming dark and filled with bloodthirst, the malevolent energies stored within his Unyielding Golden Skeleton erupting like a volcano and rushing towards Wei Wu.

He had been unbearably provoked by Wei Wu.

Yang Kai still remembered the overbearing threat the mysterious old man had issued all those days ago.

And because he was in the final moments of breaking the seal, Yang Kai had not had any spare attention for other things and had simply thought that Wei Wu wouldn’t dare to attack him.

The moment he was sneak attacked, Yang Kai wasn’t able to react until he felt the pain coming from his neck, at which point he hurriedly tried to resist!

Even so, his neck had been severely wounded.

He had almost been beheaded!

If it weren’t for his physique being so intrepid, and if the seal on his cultivation hadn’t been completely broken at that very moment, allowing him to regain control of his strength, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

Yang Kai couldn’t control his anger and his killing intent was fully revealed.

“You...how did you...” Wei Wu’s eyes widened in horror as he stared towards Yang Kai. He couldn’t understand how this youth, whose strength should have been sealed, was able to launch such a powerful attack. At this moment, this youth’s body was overflowing with evil energy, how was this anything like someone whose strength had been sealed?

The evil aura Yang Kai released seemed to engulf the entire world, making one feel like they had fallen into a hellish purgatory, chilling their guts and grinding away their courage. Wei Wu couldn’t help feeling intense fear at this moment, his entire body shivering uncontrollably.

Wei Wu suddenly felt like he wasn’t facing a First-Order Saint, but rather an unfathomable demon.

“You were right about one thing,” Yang Kai’s eyes overflowed with coldness, his voice containing no emotion as he spoke, “If I kill you here, who would know?”

A thick malevolent aura surged up and madly poured into Wei Wu’s body, causing his figure to rapidly inflate and flood to spew out from the wound on his nose, sprinkling down on Yang Kai’s face, adding a layer of fierceness to his already terrifying appearance.

Perceiving the call of death, Wei Wu began madly struggling; using every means he had at his disposal but still failing to escape from Yang Kai’s grip.

Yang Kai continued stubbornly holding him down, unmoving, allowing him to thoroughly taste despair and fear before he died.

After a few breaths of time, accompanied by Wei Wu’s screams, his body exploded, his flesh, blood, five viscera, and six organs scattering about.

An invisible suction force suddenly emerged from Yang Kai’s left eye and Wei Wu’s Soul was inhaled.

Yang Kai closed his eyes and sank his consciousness into his Knowledge Sea. Atop the rolling waves, Yang Kai began burning down Wei Wu’s Soul with his Conflagrated Spiritual Energy.

Yang Kai started off very measured, suppressing the burning power of his Knowledge Sea to a minimum so as not to instantly incinerate Wei Wu’s Soul. He wanted to torture Wei Wu and force him to suffer before completely erasing him, while also reminding himself that he must always remain alert and never treat any uncertain situation lightly.

Cries of fear and despair that seemed to last forever echoed throughout Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea.

At the same moment Wei Wu’s physical body was destroyed, a few ten thousand kilometres away from the cave, Sword Union’s Yue Xi was bringing He Zao and He Miao to collect spirit herbs.

Suddenly, Yue Xi’s tender body shook and her face became ugly, hurriedly stretching out her hand and summoning a mirror-like artifact atop her palm.

“Master? What happened?” He Zao saw her take out this small mirror and her pretty face also sank, hurriedly asking what the matter was.

Because ordinarily, this mirror played no role, it was only when someone who was close to their Master fell into great danger would she take it out to investigate.

Maser taking this Soul Mirror out at this time was obviously because someone had an accident.

“Something happened to Wei Wu!” Yue Xi replied with a frown.

“What happened to Senior Brother Wu?” He Miao also rushed over and asked with concern.

Yue Xi shook her head, bit her fingertip, and extracted a drop of blood before dripping it onto the Soul Mirror.

The mirror-like surface suddenly rippled like a lake and from its depths a strange, seven coloured fish swam up. This strange fish was extremely fast, and in the blink of an eye leapt out of the mirror and burst open mid-air.

The next moment, the seven coloured rays from the Soul Mirror formed into a clear picture that was projected in front of the trio.

This picture was the last scene Wei Wu saw before he died.

It seemed to be inside a dark cave, and a face twisted with rage appeared on the mirror, a thick murderous intent overflowing from its eyes. This murderous intent was so heavy that it seemed to cross over the mirror and cover the three women.

Under this gaze, the three of them couldn’t help feeling a chill shoot up their spines.

“Such terrifying murderous intent!” Yue Xi gasped, her beautiful eyes flashing with anger, “This boy killed Wei Wu!”

“Him?” He Zao wore a weird expression. When she saw this face, she could hardly believe her eyes, because it appeared very different from the one she had seen before, almost as if they were two different people.

“How could it be Yang Kai?” He Miao also called out hesitantly, naively saying, “Is it possible it wasn’t him? His strength has been sealed and even if he were to recover it, with his cultivation it’s impossible for him to be Senior Brother Wei Wu’s opponent.”
