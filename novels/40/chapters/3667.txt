Chapter 3666: Unlucky Again

Yang Kai was heading to the Lower Star Field, so he had to go through Star Court first. Presently, Star Court was presided over by Iron Blood Great Emperor, which was why he activated the Space Beacon that was connected to Zhan Wu Hen. Previously in Seven Mists Sea, Yang Kai had given a Space Beacon to the Great Emperor.

Supposedly, after the Space Beacon was activated, Yang Kai should appear beside Iron Blood Great Emperor.

However, at this moment, the place he was in was filled with Demon Qi. Lifting his head, he realised that the Demon soldiers in front of him were seemingly endless and it wasn‚Äôt long before innumerable streams of Divine Sense came from all directions and targeted him.

[What‚Äôs going on?] Yang Kai was dumbfounded as he subconsciously thought that Iron Blood Great Emperor must have barged into the Demon army‚Äôs base. Nevertheless, looking around, he realised that the Great Emperor was nowhere to be seen.

However, he detected a very familiar energy fluctuation that was coming from a High-Rank Demon King that was nearest to him.

The High-Rank Demon King was a Corpse Demon whose body was filthy and putrefied. Presently, he was just an arm‚Äôs length away from Yang Kai, so they were basically touching shoulders. Yang Kai‚Äôs expression darkened as he caught a whiff of the rancid smell.

The Corpse Demon was startled for a moment. Anyone would be stumped when a person suddenly appeared in front of him.

The next moment, the Corpse Demon‚Äôs eyes brightened as he could recognise Yang Kai. Pleasantly surprised, he immediately howled as his weltering Demon Qi swept across Yang Kai. At the same time, he lifted his arms as his hands extended towards the latter.

Yang Kai also pushed out a palm to parry the attack with his Demon Qi. As he activated his Dragon Transformation Secret Art, his hand turned into a Dragon Claw.

When their hands came into contact, the Corpse Demon started wailing instead as his arms twisted and shredded apart. He quickly changed his tactic by turning into a corpse mountain. The corpse mountain was shaped like a giant, and the Corpse Demon‚Äôs original appearance could only be faintly seen. However, the figure was actually made of many corpses, which could be seen struggling and wailing. Their voices seemed able to terrify anyone.

So many corpses had been crammed together that it really looked like a mountain.

Yang Kai fully activated his Dragon Transformation Secret Art and turned into a three-hundred-metre-long Half-Dragon.

Then, the two gigantic figures clashed with each other head-on.

Just then, a deafening Dragon Roar was heard, which caused the corpses to fall like rain. Three breaths later, the corpse mountain collapsed. Before the corpses even came into contact with the ground, they turned into pus, which stank terribly.

Yang Kai‚Äôs three-hundred-metre-tall figure seemed able to support the entire sky. There was a thing in his left hand that was pounding hard. It was none other than the Corpse Demon‚Äôs Demon Heart.

In just a move, the Demon Heart was taken away from him. The Corpse Demon couldn‚Äôt sustain his current form anymore as he shrunk to a Human-sized figure. Then, he collapsed to the ground, and there was a hole in his chest that could be seen through from the front to the back.

Yang Kai looked down at him with his golden eyes. He seemed authoritative as though he was a deity. Exerting more force with his hand, he was able to crush the Demon Heart apart with ease.

The Corpse Demon immediately became paralysed, but he hadn‚Äôt passed away yet. As a High-Rank Demon King, there was definitely more than one Demon Heart in his body, so it didn‚Äôt matter that one of them had been destroyed. As long as the Demon Heart remained, the Demon Race would never die!

He wailed as dark blood streamed out of his mouth. Then, he attempted to get to his feet to flee.

Nevertheless, Yang Kai lifted his foot and pressed him down. With a loud thud, the ground seemed to be shaking and the figure beneath his foot exploded into blood. The Corpse Demon didn‚Äôt even manage to grunt in pain before he was killed.

In just five breaths‚Äô time, a High-Rank Demon King had fallen. Yang Kai had almost always fought people above his realm, so now that he had ascended to the High-Rank Demon King Realm, he was even able to battle against a Pseudo-Great Emperor like Wind Lord, so it didn‚Äôt take him much effort to kill another High-Rank Demon King.

After the Corpse Demon was killed, Yang Kai spread his right palm and revealed a tiny bead, which was a Space Beacon. It was the one that he had given to Iron Blood Great Emperor when he was in Seven Mists Sea.

There were only two possible reasons why the Space Beacon had fallen into the Corpse Demon‚Äôs hands.

First, the Corpse Demon had killed Iron Blood Great Emperor and looted his stuff. However, could a High-Rank Demon King kill a Great Emperor? That was impossible. Even if Zhan Wu Hen just stood there without resisting, this High-Rank Demon King wouldn‚Äôt be able to harm him even if he kept on attacking for a hundred years without rest.

Since it was impossible for the High-Rank Demon King to have killed the Great Emperor, only one possibility was left. The Great Emperor had secretly placed the Space Beacon on the Corpse Demon‚Äôs body.

The uses of Space Beacons were no longer a secret in the Star Boundary. They could be used to send messages and transfer some items. Yang Kai suddenly gave Zhan Wu Hen a Space Beacon, so the Great Emperor knew that Yang Kai would be looking for him one day.

Iron Blood Great Emperor wasn‚Äôt willing to see Yang Kai again, so he just took it without saying anything, but he soon placed the bead in the hands of a Demon King. That was why, after Yang Kai activated the Space Beacon, he immediately appeared among the Demon soldiers.

Realizing this, Yang Kai‚Äôs expression darkened. With his three-hundred-metre tall figure, he just killed a High-Rank Demon King like the latter was a chicken. After that, he sported a dark expression, so it seemed that he still hadn‚Äôt killed enough. √öpTodated ùíèovùíÜls on ùíèo(v)ùíÜl()bin(.)cùíêm

All the Demons were horrified. There didn‚Äôt seem to be an end to the Demon soldiers in this base, but at this moment, the place was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.

Soon, a few figures flew over and they exuded the auras of Half-Saints. Apparently, they noticed the noises over there. The speed of Half-Saints was fast, so it would only take them a few breaths to reach this place. Before they even arrived, they had targeted Yang Kai with their auras.

Yang Kai took a look in that direction and gently let out a breath. Then, he yelled in a deafening voice, ‚ÄúTell Can Ye to wash his neck and wait for me! This King will definitely come to claim his skull one day!‚Äù

After he finished speaking, he shot a glance at the Half-Saint that was nearest to him, then he sneered and took a step forward before his gigantic figure vanished into thin air.

A few breaths later, some figures landed on the spot where Yang Kai was standing earlier. The Half-Saints had finally arrived, but Yang Kai was already gone and only a puddle of dark blood was left on the ground.

All of them sported grim expressions. Despite the fact that so many Demon soldiers were around, Yang Kai was still able to come and go as he pleased. Not only had he killed a High-Rank Demon King, but he had also threatened to destroy their Master, which was humiliating for them. They hadn‚Äôt really suffered from any damage as they had only lost a High-Rank Demon King, but this kind of humiliation was unacceptable for them.

However, the Half-Saints didn‚Äôt understand what Yang Kai was up to. Did he come all the way here just to showcase his power or threaten them? That would be quite childish if that was true. After giving it a thought, they still couldn‚Äôt figure out what Yang Kai‚Äôs secret plot was, so they could only tell everyone else to put up their guard.

In fact, Yang Kai didn‚Äôt have any secret plot. He was also astounded to have appeared among the Demon soldiers all of a sudden. Fortunately, Can Ye wasn‚Äôt around; otherwise, he might not even be able to flee. The Half-Saints couldn‚Äôt seal off space to stop him from fleeing, but Can Ye could do that.

If he came across Can Ye just now, he would‚Äôve lost his life; thus, Yang Kai cursed at Zhan Wu Hen in his heart, utterly incensed.

However, he had appeared in that place and killed a High-Rank Demon King, so it would‚Äôve been awkward if he just left like that, which was why he left behind a threat. It wasn‚Äôt just a threat though as it was his true intention as well.

Compared to the Demon Saints, he was more resentful of Can Ye. That was because Can Ye, as a Great Emperor of the Star Boundary, ignored the plight of the people in his own world and opened up the Two Worlds‚Äô Passage, which allowed the Demon armies to invade the Star Boundary and caused their world to descend into turmoil. Besides that, he stemmed from a Shadow Demon‚Äôs bloodline, which was why he had the urge to acknowledge his own ancestry.

During the war on Eternal Sky Continent, while Bright Moon fought alone against impossible odds, Can Ye had hidden on the side and launched a sneak attack at the critical moment, severely wounding Bright Moon and destroying all chances he had to flee.

It could be said that Can Ye‚Äôs sudden attack was the last straw that broke Bright Moon‚Äôs back, so he was one of the main reasons behind Bright Moon‚Äôs death.

Yang Kai had received Bright Moon‚Äôs blessings, so he had a duty to seek revenge for him, which was why he had to kill Can Ye one day.

When he reappeared, he caught a whiff of a fragrance, and a four-post bed came into his sight. He was startled for a moment before realising that it was a woman‚Äôs room.

Turning around, he was met with a pair of bright eyes, then he put on a grin, ‚ÄúYang‚Ä¶‚Äù

After saying just one word, Yang Kai‚Äôs voice caught in his throat. Lowering his gaze, he saw a fair and slender neck, then two great, snow-covered towering peaks. Following that, it was the woman‚Äôs flat belly.

‚ÄúWhy are you still staring?‚Äù An enraged Yang Yan swiftly extended two fingers and poked Yang Kai‚Äôs eyes.

As Yang Kai saw the alluring woman in the state she was brought into the world all of a sudden, he fell into a dazed state while Yang Yan made a move, which was why he was unable to react. After his eyes were poked, he felt excruciating pain and started seeing stars. After a grunt, he couldn‚Äôt help staggering backwards.

After stabilising himself, he forcefully rubbed his eyes as tears streamed down his face.

Yang Yan hadn‚Äôt fully used her power, so Yang Kai wouldn‚Äôt really be hurt, but his vision definitely would become blurred for a while.

A moment later, his vision finally regained focus, but his eyes had reddened as though he had gotten a cloud of dust in them. Lifting his head, he realised that Yang Yan was already fully clothed as she stared at him with a perfect smile.

Yang Kai‚Äôs face twitched as he could see the murderous intent behind her smile. At that instant, he knew that he was unlucky again. Initially, he wanted to use the Space Beacon to look for Iron Blood Great Emperor, but he arrived at the Demons‚Äô army base instead. Then, he thought that he could look for Yang Yan; after all, she was from Star Court as well, so she might be able to help. However, he hadn‚Äôt expected to walk in on her when she was getting changed, which was just terrible timing. Basically, today was the day that everything had gone wrong for him.

After giving it a thought, he said seriously, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to start the story with Senior Zhan Wu Hen.‚Äù

‚ÄúGet out!‚Äù Yang Yan demanded.

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù Yang Kai was startled.

Yang Yan pointed at the door and said through clenched teeth, ‚ÄúI said get out!‚Äù

Without saying a word, Yang Kai sniffled and turned around to leave the room, then he closed the door. After waiting for a while with his hands hidden in his sleeves, he coughed and knocked on the door, ‚ÄúIs anyone home?‚Äù

Yang Yan‚Äôs voice was heard coming from inside, ‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù

With a grin, Yang Kai pushed the door open and entered the room, only to see that she was already seated at the table with a cup of tea in her hand. She was sipping the tea in an elegant manner, her red lips particularly attractive.

Without waiting for her to say anything, Yang Kai directly took a seat.

Yang Yan said with a smile, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre acting like you‚Äôre a close friend of mine.‚Äù

The murderous intent and coldness on her face had vanished, as though nothing had happened earlier.

Yang Kai poured himself a cup of tea and gulped it down. After several cups, he finally calmed down and let out a long sigh, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not an outsider so‚Ä¶‚Äù
