“However, even though you have the power of a Divine Dragon Source, you don’t seem to know how to use it, you’re completely squandering this huge opportunity,” Chi Yue looked at Yang Kai mockingly, “That’s also why Xue Lian could easily take back his Monster Core from you. If that weren’t the case, how could he still be alive?”

A trace of embarrassment appeared on Yang Kai’s face.

This so-called Divine Dragon Source was something he obtained from the Inheritance Heaven Cave with Su Yan back when he was in High Heaven Pavilion.

Many years later, Yang Kai had learned that this inheritance had actually been left behind by the founders of Tong Xuan Realm’s Dragon Phoenix Palace.

However, during the following decades, Yang Kai had almost never used it for anything. Only when he dual cultivated with Su Yan would the Golden Dragon Tattoo engraved on his body become more active.

Chi Yue saying he was squandering this huge opportunity was not wrong.

“Let’s set that aside for now. Each of the Ancient Divine Spirits from antiquity possessed extraordinary strength and were Emperors of the Monster Race. Among them, the dragon and the phoenix were hailed as the strongest! However, for some unknown reason, at some point, these Ancient Divine Spirits all vanished. There are rumours saying that after a great battle, ninety-nine percent of all Ancient Divine Spirits fell. There are also rumours that these Divine Spirits have simply gone into hiding. As for the truth, no one knows.”

“After the disappearance of the Ancient Divine Spirits, some other powerful Monster Races took the lead. These Monster Races were called Variant Ancient Divine Spirits! The Blood Flood Dragon, Heavenly Moon Demon Spider, Nine Silent Winged Tiger, and many others belong to this category. Although these Variant Divine Spirits appeared later, some were so powerful they were not inferior to orthodox Divine Spirits. Some were even stronger than their predecessors. Moreover, some Variant Divine Spirits have survived until now. Naturally, after countless generations, these bloodlines have become quite thin and are incomparable to their ancient ancestors.”

“Xue Lian’s bloodline and the Source Qing Luo possesses belong to Variants, correct?” Yang Kai asked humbly.

“Indeed,” Chi Yue nodded, “That’s why this Queen said that Qing Luo’s future achievements will be brighter than this Queen’s! What she has is a complete Source, unlike this Queen who simply inherited a thin bloodline. In a sense, she and I can be considered one family. You should understand from this just how much Qing Luo means to this Queen.”

“Junior understands,” Yang Kai nodded sincerely.

“Good, back to Divine Spirits then,” Chi Yue was very satisfied with Yang Kai’s attitude. “Just now, this Queen said that among Divine Spirit’s, the dragon and phoenix were rulers, but among the Dragon Clan, the Golden Divine Dragons were considered emperors! What you inherited is the Source of a Golden Divine Dragon!”

“Golden Divine Dragon!” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed.

“Simply put, the power you inherited, even among Divine Spirits, is the strongest! Now, you should understand just how attractive it is to the Tribal Lords of the Monster Race, right?”

Yang Kai gently nodded before suddenly grinning, “Junior admires Senior deeply for being able to resist such temptation.”

“Without Qing Luo, do you think this Queen would be speaking any nonsense with you?” Chi Yue’s elegant demeanor turned cold as she grumbled unwillingly, “Without Qing Luo, this Queen would have already caught you and refined your Soul.”

“Haha!” Yang Kai smiled dryly.

“However, this Queen is also very curious just how much of the Divine Dragon Source you inherited...” Chi Yue looked at Yang Kai with great interest, her Divine Sense scanning him carefully.

“I don’t know,” Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders.

“Hm, that’s strange,” Suddenly Chi Yue seemed to have discovered something, the look on her pretty face becoming even more curious. “Why... do I sense the power of two different Divine Spirits in your body? One is the previous Divine Dragon, but there is another as well...” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Does Senior mean this?” Yang Kai frowned, and without hesitating, summoned the Verdant Dragon Bone Sword and poured his Saint Qi into it. With a loud dragon roar, a green dragon appeared above Yang Kai’s head and stared down at Chi Yue condescendingly.

Chi Yue’s phoenix eyes suddenly shrank as she cried out, “Impossible, you even have something like this!”

With her eyesight, it was easy for her to see that this was an artifact refined from a piece of Dragon Bone as well as what seemed to be a Dragon Bead! On top of that, there was even a faint Dragon Soul inside the Dragon Bead.

Chi Yue was shocked as her eyes turned red with envy at the opportunities Yang Kai had.

He was just a human, so why did he have so many opportunities that could drive any Monster Race master insane with jealousy?

“Is this your trump card?” Chi Yue gasped as she felt the rush of Dragon Pressure which caused her thin Heavenly Moon Demon Spider bloodline to tremble slightly. After some time, however, the excitement on her face calmed down and was replaced with a complicated expression, “If this is what you are depending on, then this Queen would advise you not to think too highly of yourself. With the power of this artifact, you might be invincible against another Origin King Realm Cultivator... that is, if you were in the same realm as them. Origin King Realm is something that an Origin Returning Realm cannot resist against.”

Yang Kai simply smiled nonchalantly.

[This little brat still has other cards to play!] Chi Yue was truly shocked. What kind of freak was he?

Yang Kai looked at Chi Yue lightly.

He knew that what Chi Yue just felt was not the Dragon Bone Sword but the Ice Phoenix Remnant Soul!

However, the Ice Phoenix Remnant Soul was not owned by him and was only temporarily using him as a vessel. It belonged to Su Yan!

Yang Kai had chosen to expose the Dragon Bone Sword rather than let Chi Yue detect the existence of the Ice Phoenix.

If Chi Yue learned of it, Yang Kai was not sure how she would react.

“Forget it, put it away, if you keep bringing such things out like this, this Queen may not be able to resist taking you,” Chi Yue said sternly.

Yang Kai responded by storing the Dragon Bone Sword into his body.

Chi Yue sat silently for some time, as if her mood was still fluctuating. Yang Kai also remained silent, simply standing and waiting, not daring to disturb her rashly.

After a full cup of tea worth of time, Chi Yue raised her head again and stared at Yang Kai, a strange smiling creeping onto her face as she asked, “Boy, do you want to unearth the power of the Divine Dragon Source in your body?”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, “Senior has a way?”

“Haha, why would this Queen not have such a method?” Chi Yue smiled slyly, “Just now, this Queen witnessed your battle with Xue Lian from beginning to end. En, although your level of Body Tempering far exceeds that of Xue Lian’s, and this Queen doesn’t know exactly how you managed to achieve it, it must have something to do with that five coloured ability you showed! However, if you were able to use the power of the Golden Divine Dragon, your physical strength would rise to an entirely new level, one comparable to a true Golden Divine Dragon!”

Yang Kai’s eyes became brighter.

“Such a level can only be described as immortal and indestructible!” Chi Yue’s words were filled with strong temptation.

The look of desire on Yang Kai’s face instantly faded away, however, and he instead looked at Chi Yue vigilantly, hesitating for a moment before saying, “If Senior has something to say, it would be best to get straight to the point. Junior admits he is very interested in what Senior has to offer but is also well aware there must be a price to pay for it. Since that is the case, Senior might as well explain clearly what she wants from Junior. If the price is too steep, then we may as well forget the issue ever came up.”

“Straightforward!” Chi Yue nodded, “Talking to smart people is much simpler. En, this Queen does need your help with something, but you can choose to agree or refuse, everything is voluntary.”

“Senior, please speak!”

“Have you heard of the Blood Prison Trial on Green Mountains Star?”

“I’ve heard of it,” Yang Kai’s expression turned weird. He had naturally heard of the Blood Prison Trial as he had just left Qian Tong and the others on Green Mountains Star to wait for it to begin.

Why would Chi Yue bring this topic up though?

Although the Blood Prison Trial was indeed famous and attracted Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters from across the entire Star Field to participate, the masters from Monster Emperor Star all belonged to the Monster Race, so wouldn’t it be impossible for them to flagrantly appear on Green Mountains Star?

If they were really to do this, they would definitely suffer. Just like the Monster Race on Monster Emperor Star suppressed the Human Race, humans elsewhere would suppress the Monster Race.

“If you’ve heard of it then this will be easy to explain,” Chi Yue smiled with satisfaction, “This Queen needs you to go to Green Mountains Star, enter the Blood Prison, find something, and return it to this Queen!”

“What are you looking for?”

“An Origin Essence Crystal!” Chi Yue declared firmly.

“A what?” Yang Kai frowned.

“A treasure only Third-Order Origin Kings are qualified to condense. You can think of it as the crystallization of that master’s Spiritual Essence. After the death of a master of this level, their Origin Essence Crystal will be left behind. Of course, what I want you to find is an Origin Essence Crystal left over from one of the top masters of my Monster Emperor Star. Essentially, it is his body’s Core!”

“Core?”

“Yeah, you should have heard about the origins of the Blood Prison Trial; that was a battlefield that twenty Origin King Realm masters fought and died on. The battlefield is littered with the remnant Domains of those Origin Kings, which is why it has such attraction to Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators. Back then, a powerful Tribal Lord from my Monster Race participated in that battle. Unfortunately, he fell inside the Blood Prison. I want you to retrieve his Origin Essence Crystal!”

“You want me to retrieve it?” Yang Kai frowned, “Right, Mi Tian and Xue Lian arriving at your palace at this time must be because they are going to participate in the Blood Prison Trial, right?”

Yang Kai suddenly understood this point, and counting the days, the Blood Prison Trial was not far away. The Young Lord of Thousand Eyes Tribal Lord and the son of Blood Flood Dragon Tribal Lord arriving at Chi Yue’s palace together and Chi Yue mentioning the Blood Prison Trial now, allowed Yang Kai to understand the situation.

“Yes, they will participate, that’s why they came to this Queen’s palace! Because only this Queen can safely deliver them to the Blood Prison. Not only them, Qing Luo, Yu Xiong, and Ba He will also be participating together with two other Monster Race Juniors you’ve not met yet but who should arrive soon!”

“Since so many people are going to participate, why do you need me to retrieve it?” Yang Kai squinted at Chi Yue, sneering as he asked, “There isn’t some kind of insurmountable danger, right?”

“Participating in the Blood Prison Trial is extremely dangerous in and of itself. Haven’t you heard that at least half of the masters who enter the Blood Prison never leave? As for that Origin Essence Crystal... there is certainly some danger related to obtaining it, but with your rampancy, are you going to tell this Queen you’re afraid of a little danger?”

“Junior only has one life, so naturally he should cherish it, so Junior must ask Senior to answer his question from just now,” Yang Kai said as he stared at Chi Yue stubbornly.
