“Look!” Xue Yue suddenly pointed, “There seems to be some movement over there.”

Through the flickering cracks in space, some unbelievable scenes were vaguely visible to everyone’s eyes.

“That’s... how is that damned place visible?” Gui Zu almost bit his tongue. Although the cracks were extremely small and unstable, Gui Zu was still able to see a scenery resembling the floating continent.

“That’s where Yang Kai went?” Xue Yue asked in surprise.

“En, if this old master isn’t mistaken, it should be, but... do you hear something?” Gui Zu looked at Ni Guang and Xue Yue.

Xue Yue shook her head, but Ni Guang wore a solemn expression and nodded, “There’s a vague sound of thunder and the aura coming from those cracks... tss, is that boy trying to break through?”

“You mean... this movement was caused by his World Energy baptism?” Gui Zu’s expression changed. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Isn’t it?” Ni Guang asked back.

“It looks like it, but that damned place is an isolated, independent world! Even if Yang Kai was trying to break through to the Origin King Realm, could he really cause such a massive disturbance that it could be seen across worlds?” Gui Zu face twitched, still stunned by the words that left his lips after he spoke them.

Others may not necessarily be able to create such a scene, but that did not automatically mean Yang Kai couldn’t.

He was proficient in the Dao of Space, so if he really was breaking through to the Origin King Realm, disturbing the boundaries between two independent spaces might be possible.

“If that’s really the case, then this boy is in danger,” Ni Guang quickly said.

“What do you mean?” Xue Yue was shocked as her pretty face turned white.

“The energy is too terrifying, I don’t know if he can withstand it,” Ni Guang frowned and replied.

When one attempted to break through to the Origin King Realm, if they were unable to withstand the accompanying baptism, the consequences would be severe. This was vastly different from break thoughts in lower Great Realms. Even if someone attempted to break through and failed, while there was danger, it would not be serious.

However, once one failed to break through to the Origin King Realm, there would only be one of two results: crippling losses, or death!

And the probability of the latter was more than eighty percent!

While Ni Guang and Gui Zu were discussing, on the other side, Zi Long, Xu Wei, and Kong Fa were also pointing at the same place and had come to a similar conclusion, that Yang Kai was breaking through to the Origin King Realm!

Zi Long’s face had turned blue from gloom.

He was not afraid that Yang Kai’s breakthrough would succeed, because even if he did, he would still only be a First-Order Origin King, nothing to worry about in Zi Long’s eyes.

What Zi Long was worried about was that Yang Kai would fail!

If this little brat died inside that strange space, how could Zi Long obtain the Immortal Tree?

“That bastard!” Zi Long shouted angrily while ironically hoping Yang Kai would succeed.

Floating in the Chaotic Abyss, all kinds of strange phenomena continued without end, keeping everyone on edge as they watched and wondered whether Yang Kai would encounter any accidents.

This situation lasted for a full day before the turbulent space gradually stabilized and the faint sound of thunder gradually dissipated.

“Did he succeed?” Xue Yue was as anxious as an ant on a hot wok, wishing she could rush into that floating continent to get a closer look.

Ni Guang and Gui Zu wore solemn and unreadable expressions as they held their silence.

By now, the results of this breakthrough had been decided, but from where they stood, they couldn’t infer whether Yang Kai had succeeded or not. All they could do was wait anxiously.

On the floating continent, a massive pit had appeared in the place where Yang Kai had attempted his breakthrough, and the surrounding landscape had been destroyed.

In the centre of the pit, a dark figure sat upright on the ground. Who else could it be but Yang Kai?

A burnt smell filled the surroundings.

“Wasn’t that a bit too much?!” Yang Kai looked up at the sky as his face twitched. He felt pain all over his body, as if the bones had been shattered and his flesh had been ground to paste. Every single movement he made was agonizing as each of his nerves felt like they were on fire.

The baptism he faced to reach the Origin King Realm had been far more violent than he expected!

On his cultivation journey, each time Yang Kai had broken through to a new Great Realm, he had crossed a life-threatening experience, but he almost died this time.

Even his Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art was almost shattered by the torrent of World Energy, and he was forced to use his Dragon Transformation Secret Technique to withstand the final moments.

At this moment, his Dragon Transformation Secret Technique had yet to be withdrawn, so his right arm was covered in pieces of Dragon Scales while his right hand had taken on the appearance of a dragon claw. Even so, the scales on this dragon arm had been torn and bloodied.

Yang Kai was in a miserable position, but as soon as he sensed his current state, he could not help grinning widely.

Origin King Realm!

After many years, he had finally set foot into the Origin King Realm.

Feeling the surging power in his body and his new, completely different comprehension of the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao, Yang Kai felt that all the suffering he just endured had been worthwhile.

Making the leap from the Origin Returning Realm to the Origin King Realm was like stepping into a completely new world.

After taking a rest for a while, Yang Kai struggled to his feet, holding back the pain he felt, took out a handful of pills from his Space Ring, and without even checking what they were, stuffed them into his mouth, chewing them wildly.

Focusing his mind, Yang Kai began to connect his Soul, body, and Dantian...

This was undoubtedly the best time to consolidate his cultivation, so he was not willing to miss it.

The Dragon Scales on his right arm quickly retreated and a faint golden light began to emerge. Yang Kai’s wounds began repairing themselves at a speed visible to the naked eye while a powerful vitality pulsed from his figure.

The golden light became more and more radiant until the place where Yang Kai stood was completely shrouded in it, making it impossible to see his figure.

The activity of his Golden Blood was now countless times stronger than before.

One day later, the golden light dissipated, revealing Yang Kai’s intrepid physique.

His exposed regions were covered in a layer of dried-up blood, but with just a shake, Yang Kai shattered this covering, exposing skin underneath that was as fresh and tender looking as a newborn’s.

“Oh, the Enlightenment Pill!” Yang Kai suddenly remembered something and quickly searched for it in his Space Ring, taking out a jade bottle and pouring out a Spirit Pill a moment later.

This was one of the three Enlightenment Pills he had refined before.

One of the three had formed Pill Veins, while the other two did not but were still extremely high quality.

“En, you,” Yang Kai naturally picked the Enlightenment Pill which formed Pill Veins and stuffed it into his mouth, where it quickly dissolved into pure medicinal essence that he used to enhance his comprehension of the Martial Dao.

The aura coming from his body became more refined and condensed as it seemed to resonate with the Heavenly Way around him...

After half a month, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes and let out a breath.

His eyes seemed clear but also ordinary, just like a mortal’s. Even his violent Saint Qi fluctuations from his breakthrough had been completely calmed.

“Not bad. Although my realm has not been completely consolidated, it’s not far off from it,” Yang Kai muttered to himself as he spread his Divine Sense and released a profound and mysterious strength into his surroundings.

Suddenly, within a radius of a thousand metres, space became viscous and innumerable tiny Void Cracks began to form.

Domain!

After breaking through to the Origin King Realm, Yang Kai’s Shi had finally evolved into Domain! And this Domain had incorporated his Space Force, making it more powerful than the Domain of an average Origin King.

In this Domain, he was the master!

It was for this reason that Origin Kings could so easily kill Origin Realm cultivators. An Origin Realm master could only use their Shi to influence and interfere with others, but an Origin King could use their Domain to manipulate the environment around them directly.

With a quick thought, his Domain dissipated and Yang Kai turned his head to look around before flying up into the sky and calling back his Blood Beasts as well as Xiao Xiao and Liu Yan.

A moment later, all the Blood Beasts flew back, turned into Golden Blood Threads, and returned to his body. Xiao Xiao also obediently returned to the Sealed World Bead while Liu Yan took a moment to observe Yang Kai before saying, “Congratulations on breaking through to the Origin King Realm, Master!”

“Haha, I was just lucky,” Yang Kai chuckled lightly, thought for a moment, then said. “You can rest assured, I will find a way to help your strength improve as well.”

Liu Yan’s eyes lit up as she respectfully bowed, “Many thanks, Master.”

As an Artifact Spirit, although she had managed to refine her natal Artifact Refining Furnace into her body, it would be almost impossible to increase her strength further unless she could swallow another existence like the Heaven Scorching Thunder Fire, enhancing herself would be quite difficult.

However, Yang Kai’s words put Liu Yan completely at ease.

Because Yang Kai still had the Sun’s True Essence!

As long as she could swallow more Sun’s True Fire, her strength would continue to rise.

“Alright, return to the Sealed World Bead for now. You know where I’ve placed the Sun’s True Essence, so swallow as much as you can, but be careful not to advance recklessly and harm yourself.”

“Yes!” Liu Yan was overjoyed and disappeared in a flash. The next moment, she appeared in the Sealed World Bead and quickly found where the Sun’s True Essence was. Immediately transforming into her Firebird appearance, she let out a joyful cry as she rushed over.

After dealing with this, Yang Kai turned his head and looked in one direction, frowned, and immediately teleported a few dozen kilometres away.

Lu Gui Chen was still sitting there, his expression pale and languid. After realizing the arrival of Yang Kai, he raised his head and gave a wry smile.

“Ignorant!” Yang Kai shook his head, understanding why Lu Gui Chen had wound up in such a state. Although Yang Kai had been breaking through, it did not mean he was completely ignorant of what was happening around him.

On the contrary, Lu Gui Chen losing confidence and nearly killing himself after witnessing the power of his baptism was clearly shown to Yang Kai from beginning to end.

To a cultivator, whether it was a physical wound or one on their Soul, no matter how severe, there would always be a way to recover, but if a cultivator’s Martial Heart collapsed, even the Great Emperor would be powerless to help them.

Because this was a wound to one’s own convictions, and only if one could overcome such a setback themselves could they recover.

Yang Kai wasn’t familiar with Lu Gui Chen, and instead had grudges between them. He was not even worthy of Yang Kai killing, so how could he spare any effort to comfort Lu Gui Chen now?

So after just a glance, Yang Kai ignored him.

Next, Yang Kai spread his Divine Sense out, extending it towards the inner depths of the floating continent.

He wanted to see how his Embodiment’s refinement of the Star Source was progressing.
