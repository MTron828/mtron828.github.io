Yang Kai remained seated for a while before waving his hand, “Whatever. Just take them away.”

Wu Kuang guffawed and gave the other man a thumbs up, “You’re indeed generous, kid.”

Upon finishing his words, Wu Kuang pushed his World Force and engulfed Yin Xin Zhao and the others with it. Following that, he turned into a demonic cloud and shot into the sky.

Yang Kai looked up and shouted, “Clean up everything. Don’t leave any traces behind!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Wu Kuang’s voice was heard coming from the distance, “Don’t worry.”

“That Old Ghost is now a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master!” With a conflicted gaze, Bustling World Great Emperor watched as Wu Kuang left.

When he was in the Shattered Star Sea in the past, he failed in his attempt to kill Wu Kuang. Instead, his body was almost taken over by the latter. Their Souls ended up living in the same body for many years, and their enmity slowly subsided as they had gone through some hardships together.

After killing Great Demon God Mo Sheng, Wu Kuang left and there had not been any news about him since.

Bustling World Great Emperor had never expected to come across him on this day.

He was able to recognise Wu Kuang even though the latter’s appearance was completely different now. Over the past few years, the Great Emperors had been cultivating in seclusion in Void Land. With Void Land as their support, there had never been a lack of resources; however, it wasn’t until recently that they made it to the Sixth-Order. On the other hand, it appeared that Wu Kuang had achieved an ascension much earlier than them.

It had to be noted that Wu Kuang had been making a living on his own, but he was still able to attain such achievements. This fact alone made Duan Hong Chen realise that he was no match for him.

Wu Kuang lived up to his name as the strongest Great Emperor in the history of the Star Boundary.

“That was Wu Kuang?” Iron Blood Great Emperor Zhan Wu Hen suddenly exclaimed as he had just realised it.

Duan Hong Chen nodded gently.

The corners of Zhan Wu Hen’s brow twitched, “No wonder I found that guy annoying the first time he entered my eyes.”

“Junior Brother Yang!” Qing Kui dashed towards Yang Kai, “Yin Xin Zhao and Pei Wen Xuan cannot die!”

Earlier, he saw Wu Kuang using the Heaven Devouring Battle Law and now he brought Yin Xin Zhao and the others away. It was obvious to him what fate awaited them.

He was also shocked by Yang Kai’s audacity.

After a cough, Yang Kai turned to look at him and replied with a smile, “I know what you’re worried about, Senior Brother Qing.”

“You know nothing!” Qing Kui turned solemn, “After you killed Zhao Xing, only Zuo Quan Hui and the others came over to retaliate against you. That was because Yin-Yang Cave Heaven interfered and resisted most of the pressure for you. Now that traitors on paper like Zuo Quan Hui are dead, those from Thousand Cranes Paradise won’t do anything to you even though they’re resentful. Otherwise, they’ll have to openly offend Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. However, Yin Xin Zhao and Pei Wen Xuan are different. If you let someone kill them, Myriad Demons Heaven and Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven will never let you off. By then, more than one Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master will come to destroy you.”

Yang Kai batted his eyes with an innocent expression, “No one from Void Land killed them. Did anyone see it?”

Wu Kuang wasn’t a member of Void Land. Strictly speaking, he was just a traitor from Myriad Demons Heaven.

Yang Kai initially intended to bring those people back to the Great Territory where the Star Boundary was located and kill them to further nourish the World Tree. However, if Yin Xin Zhao and Pei Wen Xuan were really killed there, some faint traces might be left behind.

Moreover, after the previous epic battle, the World Tree had obtained quite a lot of nourishment, so there wasn’t a need to provide more for it now. That was the reason Yang Kai gave up on that idea.

A frustrated Qing Kui stared at him, “It is a well-known fact that Pei Wen Xuan and Yin Xin Zhao assisted Heavenly Sword Union to make things difficult for Void Land in the past. Both Heavenly Sword Union and Zuo Quan Hui were destroyed, so if Pei Wen Xuan and Yin Xin Zhao are also killed, even a fool will figure out that it has something to do with Void Land. In fact, there’s no need for any witnesses at all. Do you think the two Cave Heavens will go easy on you? They’ll settle the issue with brute force.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “I absolutely agree with you, Senior Brother Qing. However, Pei Wen Xuan and Yin Xin Zhao repeatedly made things difficult for me in the past. Previously on the Prison Star, I intended to make use of the Prison League’s power to kill them, but Yellow Spring Heavenly Monarch and the others proved unreliable. That was the reason they managed to flee. Now that there’s such a great chance, I naturally wouldn’t let them leave. I’ll feel nauseated if I ever see them again.”

Qing Kui was so exasperated that he stomped his foot on the ground, “Don’t you get it, Junior Brother Yang? They can’t be killed! Although Void Land is fairly powerful now…”

Yang Kai raised his hand to cut him off, “Senior Brother Qing, even if I’m willing to let them off, someone else won’t let them live. Why don’t you try to persuade that person instead of me?”

“That person…” Qing Kui became startled for a moment before realising that Yang Kai was talking about Wu Kuang.

[That’s right…] Wu Kuang was technically a disciple of Myriad Demons Heaven, but he launched a sneak attack on Zuo Quan Hui and cultivated an extremely evil Secret Art. If such secrets were exposed, he would never be able to settle down in any place even though the 3,000 Worlds was so expansive.

Certainly, Wu Kuang would want to silence all witnesses to his crimes; therefore, it was pointless for Qing Kui to keep persuading Yang Kai.

A moment later, Qing Kui snapped out of his dazed state and sighed, “You’ve really made a huge mistake this time.”

Yang Kai got up with difficulty and patted the other man’s shoulder with a smile, “I believe that person will not leave any traces behind. Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven and Myriad Demons Heaven might speculate that their disciples were killed by me, but they can’t do anything to me since they don’t have any evidence.”

Qing Kui put on a helpless smile as he thought that Yang Kai was oversimplifying things. If the two Cave Heavens wanted to avenge the death of their disciples, they didn’t need any evidence. A simple doubt was a good enough reason for them to make a move.

“Junior Brother Yang, there’s one more thing you need to know. If Yin Xin Zhao and Pei Wen Xuan are really killed, those from Myriad Demons Heaven and Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven will immediately find out about it. After all, they are Core Disciples of their Sects, so they must have left behind Soul Lamps in their headquarters. Once they die, their Soul Lamps will go out as well. The two Cave Heavens will definitely send some people over once that happens.”

Yang Kai frowned, “Will they be able to find out that those people were killed here?”

Qing Kui nodded with a solemn expression, “Given the powers of the senior experts of those Cave Heavens, they can definitely do that even though it might take a while.”

Yang Kai arched his brow, “In that case, we’re running short on time.”

Following a pause, he continued, “There’s one thing I need you to help me with, Senior Brother Qing.”

Qing Kui replied, “Just tell me straight away. Since Honoured Master has sent Junior Sister and me to help you, we’ll follow your commands.”

Yang Kai cut to the chase and said, “I need you to go back to Yin-Yang Cave Heaven and invite Martial Uncle Xu to come to the Star Boundary.”

Qing Kui raised his brow in confusion upon hearing that, but soon understanding something, he said in shock, “Junior Brother Yang, you…”

Suddenly, Yang Kai put on a smile, “I’m a son-in-law of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, and I’ve gained some benefits from the Sect. Martial Uncle Xu has been treating me well as he had even let me enter the Divine Armament World once. Now that I have gained some benefits of my own, I naturally can’t gobble everything up by myself. When you return to Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, Senior Brother Qing, please help me inform Martial Uncle Xu that I have a gift for him.”

Su Ying Xue, who had chosen to take a passive role up until now, appeared surprised as well.

Upon realising the other man’s intention, Qing Kui became excited, “In that case, I’ll not hide anything about what went on in the Star Boundary.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “It can’t be hidden. The secret of the Star Boundary will be exposed sooner or later. If possible, tell Martial Uncle Xu to invite some of the representatives of the other Cave Heavens and Paradises he’s on good terms with to come to the Star Boundary as well.”

Qing Kui examined him and remarked, “You’re pretty audacious, Junior Brother.”

There was a bitter smile on Yang Kai’s face, “It’s not possible for us to monopolise such a big piece of fat. Rather than waiting for other people to come snatch it, I’d rather expose the truth myself and negotiate to remain on top.”

Following the transformation of the Star Boundary, the World Tree started growing madly and amplified its heritage, which allowed the cultivators living there to more easily comprehend the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao. Even Yang Kai’s Father and Mother, whose aptitudes were average at best, could still easily make it to the Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm, with hope of ascending to the Fifth-Order. If cultivators with exceptional aptitudes started cultivating in the Star Boundary from a young age, they might be able to directly ascend to the Sixth-Order or even the Seventh-Order.

It could be said that Star Boundary was now the best cradle for nurturing future Open Heaven Realm Masters. Nowhere else in the entire 3,000 Worlds was comparable to it.

Certainly. Yang Kai would have monopolised such a precious place if he could; however, life was not a bed of roses.

In the past, no one bothered to come to the Star Boundary as it was located in a very remote area. Now that the World Tree had matured though, it would send a shockwave across the entire 3,000 Worlds. No one could stop this secret from spreading.

Moreover, following the death of Yin Xin Zhao and Pei Wen Xuan, those from Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven and Myriad Demons Heaven would definitely come over to investigate. Yang Kai naturally had to be prepared.

It was true that Void Land was fairly strong now as there were two Divine Spirits residing in its headquarters. Even the Cave Heavens and Paradises wouldn’t dare to underestimate them.

But in the end, that was just Void Land’s headquarters. There were not many powerful cultivators in the Star Boundary. It could be said that over 1,000 Open Heaven Realm Masters, more than twenty of them were in the Sixth-Order, were a force to be reckoned with, but any Cave Heaven or Paradise could easily deploy such a powerful force with ease.

Yang Kai didn’t think they could win if they were faced with any of those great forces, not to mention that Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven and Myriad Demons Heaven would probably join forces to deal with them.

In order to survive, those from Void Land had to make use of the power of others.

Only other Cave Heavens and Paradises could deal with the Cave Heavens and Paradises. However, without enough benefits, there was no reason for those forces to make a move.

Although Xu Ling Gong was close to Yang Kai, he was unable to represent the entire Yin-Yang Cave Heaven.

Since they were running out of time, Qing Kui decided to leave immediately as Yin-Yang Cave Heaven was far away. Fortunately, since he was on his own, he could make use of Universe Temples to move around faster. It would probably take him three to four months to go there and come back.

Those from Myriad Demons Heaven and Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven probably wouldn’t be able to find the Star Boundary in just three to four months.

Su Ying Xue didn’t leave. Since she was a disciple of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, she might prove to be useful if anything unexpected happened.

Yang Kai stopped letting his thoughts run wild as he turned his head and raised his hand, “Tell him to come over.”

Earlier, when Lu Bai Yang noticed that the battle had ended, he decided to come over and have a look, but he waited at a distance so as not to appear rude. Upon stepping into this place though, he felt his chest tightening when he saw the pale young man who was covered in blood and the people around him.

He was already the strongest cultivator in the Blue Clouds Continent, but he was still unable to sense the true cultivation of these people. As he swept a glance over them, he realised that the aura of every one of them was extremely imposing. Then, when he recalled the Heaven destroying and Earth shattering noises just now, he realised that the powers of these people far exceeded his own.

In a respectful manner, he cupped his fist, “Blue Clouds Continent Lu Bai Yang, greets Seniors!”

Yang Kai examined him and nodded gently, “A promising man indeed.”

Faced with formidable enemies, Lu Bai Yang was still determined to defend his homeland. At the most critical moment, he even obtained the acknowledgement of the World’s Will, thus allowing him to become a Great Emperor and condense his Dao Seal. Therefore, it was obvious that even though Lu Bai Yang was still weak right now, he was a resolute person.
