The barrage of circular Sword Qi blades slashed towards Yang Kai’s position, slicing through the air with a sharp, whistling noise.

Cheng Tai’s face changed slightly...

Only now did he realize that this pair from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect had not been using their full strength when they fought with him before. If they had performed such a Secret Technique before, it would have been quite difficult for him to withstand them.

Seeing this blow, even though it was not directed at him, gave Cheng Tai a sense of fear and unease, as if the countless blades had all been pointed at him.

Widening his eyes, he wanted to see how Yang Kai would defend against this move.

At any rate, this unknown kid had an Emperor Artifact, so his origins should not be low and he should also know some extremely profound skills. Such a blow was indeed quite powerful, but it shouldn’t be able to take this kid’s life... Or at least, that was what Cheng Tai assumed.

However, what he saw before him was far beyond his expectation.

When the barrage of circular Sword Qi blades struck, Yang Kai simply stood in place stupidly, as if he was unable to respond, not even taking any defensive actions until the last moment.

But by then, it was too late...

*Chi chi chi chi...*

The muffled sound of something being cut rang out as Yang Kai’s whole figure was submerged in countless Sword Qi blades and cut into pieces.

“Huh?” Cheng Tai exclaimed as he stared forward with an incredulous expression, “Did he... die?”

This strange kid who seemed so unreadable and deadly was actually killed easily with a single blow. This scene was simply beyond Cheng Tai’s ability to accept!

But soon, he relaxed...

He secretly felt that the reason why Yang Kai’s blow just now had been so powerful was simply because of the Emperor Artifact, and that Yang Kai’s personal strength was only on par with an ordinary First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator. Thinking about it this way, everything made sense.

“Overconfidence!” Senior Brother He also sneered as he flicked his sword lightly, an extremely excited light flashing across his eyes as they turned towards the Myriads Sword in Yang Kai’s hand.

At that moment though, Yang Kai’s corpse, which had been cut into countless pieces, suddenly distorted and faded into nothing.

Senior Brother He’s expression went stiff as he called out, “An afterimage!”

It wasn’t until this time that he understood why he was still feeling anxious despite having won the fight. This kind of ominous feeling was something that could not be explained, but also could not be ignored.

The scene before him made everything clear. The body which had been shredded just now was obviously not a real one, but just a mirage.

“Senior Brother, look out!” The young woman suddenly called out as her beautiful face paled.

At that exact moment, a brilliant light flashed across Senior Brother He’s neck and passed clean through it.

Senior Brother He’s complexion changed drastically as he tried to turn around and see what just happened, but no matter how he tried, he was unable to rotate his head. Not only that, he felt a slight pain coming from his neck the harder he tried to move it. A moment later, his vision turned upside down as his view seemed to fall.

“I... died?” A strange thought flashed across Senior Brother He’s mind as his vision gradually filled with darkness. The last scene reflected in his eyes was Yang Kai holding the Myriads Sword and standing quietly not far behind him. On the broadsword, there was some fresh red blood running down the blade, dripping off it lightly.

*Pu...*

The death of Senior Brother He seemed to set off a chain reaction as his Junior Sister, who was connected to him at the moment, turned pale, and spat out blood, her vitality rapidly draining as her face aged countless years in an instant.

She seemed incapable of controlling her body and quickly fell from the sky, fluttering mid-air, unable to stabilize her figure.

A moment later, she hit the ground with a splat!

“Some kind of backlash?” Yang Kai frowned thoughtfully.

Although this Absolute Resonance Secret Art was extremely powerful, it seemed to have severe drawbacks as well... Yang Kai had just killed that Senior Brother He, but now it seemed that alone was enough to send this young woman to her death as well!

Suddenly, two radiances flew out from the bodies of Senior Brother He and his Junior Sister and soared up into the air.

Yang Kai moved swiftly and seized these two flowing lights.

The back of his hand went slightly hot as soon as he caught these two lights, and when Yang Kai looked down, he saw two more Star Seals had appeared!

These two Star Seals obviously belonged to the two disciples of the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect, but after their deaths, the Star Seals became ownerless and were easily claimed.

The grades of these two Star Seals weren’t very high, just triangular and diamond-shaped, like the Star Seal Yang Kai had obtained before!

Now, Yang Kai had collected three Star Seals from this Four Seasons Realm!

Star Seals seemed to be quite difficult to obtain. Yang Kai had stayed in this Sealed World for more than twenty days and apart from the one he obtained by coincidence, he hadn’t obtained another, showing how rare they were.

But right now, he actually obtained two more.

As Yang Kai observed his newly acquired Star Seals, Cheng Tai, who was watching from the side, shivered uncontrollably!

Everything had happened so fast that he had failed to even see how Yang Kai moved. What he did know was that the pair from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect had been cut down in one move, allowing Cheng Tai to realize he had seriously underestimated Yang Kai’s ability!

Although this kid looked like just a First-Order Dao Source cultivator, his true combat power could not be judged on that alone! This kid was definitely an elite among elite who could easily defeat others above his own realm!

Thinking so, how could Cheng Tai dare to remain? He was now secretly cursing himself for not leaving sooner as now he couldn’t even be sure he could leave.

But doing nothing was not an option, so Cheng Tai grit his teeth and cupped his fists, “This Cheng apologizes for his prior offence and hopes this friend will be forgiving! This Cheng will now take his leave...”

“Stand right there!” Yang Kai glanced at him coldly and faintly as he shouted.

“Friend... what advice do you have?” Cheng Tai’s face twitched as fright filled his heart, only wishing to be as far away from here as possible, but not daring to act rashly.

“Just wait a moment!” Yang Kai didn’t show any killing intent and instead flew down to the two fresh corpses of the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect disciples. Taking down their Space Rings, Yang Kai swept them with his Divine Sense as he seemed to search for something.

Even with Yang Kai’s back turned to him, Cheng Tai stood obediently in place. He knew that in his current state, he was not Yang Kai’s opponent at all, and if he angered this strange young man, there would soon be a third corpse on the ground!

“Nothing but junk!” Yang Kai muttered with some dissatisfaction after inspecting the two Space Rings.

Of course, this wasn’t the case.

The Senior Brother and Junior Sister pair were both Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators so naturally there were many good things in their Space Rings. Whether it was Source Crystals, pills, or artifacts, the value of their property wasn’t bad, but they were lacking what Yang Kai was looking for.

After muttering so, Yang Kai turned to Cheng Tai and flew over before pondering for a moment and asking, “If it’s convenient, can Brother Cheng give me your Space Ring?”

Hearing this, Cheng Tai’s face turned pale, but people under the eaves had to bow their heads, so with a forced smile he nodded, “Naturally that’s not a problem.”

Saying so, he took off his Space Ring with a pained expression on his face before tossing it over to Yang Kai. Finished, he hurriedly asked, “If friend is satisfied, this Cheng will now leave and not disturb you...”

“What’s the hurry?” Yang Kai glanced at him, “You don’t want your Space Ring?”

“Huh?” Cheng Tai wore a stunned expression, really not understanding why Yang Kai would say this.

“Did you think I was trying to rob you?” Yang Kai curled his lips, “Do you think I would engage in such a despicable act?”

The expression on Cheng Tai’s face constantly fluctuated, really not knowing what to say.

“Haha... something useful!” At that moment, Yang Kai suddenly laughed and with a flick of his Divine Sense, he took out something from Cheng Tai’s Space Ring.

Cheng Tai glanced over and saw that the thing was a charcoal black spirit grass.

In all honesty, Cheng Tai didn’t know exactly what this spirit grass was or what its purpose was, he simply felt it was high-grade and valuable, so he collected it from the Realm of Autumn while he was exploring.

He didn’t expect Yang Kai would suddenly take this particular herb out at this moment.

Cheng Tai was completely at a loss...

He was obviously clearer about the content of his Space Ring than anyone, and knew that in terms of value, there were many other things far more precious than this spirit grass, but this strange boy had actually chosen this and nothing else.

While Cheng Tai was stunned, Yang Kai tossed his Space Ring back to him as he played with the spirit grass in his hand, a happy expression filling his face.

“This friend, do you really not want anything else...” Cheng Tai asked cautiously.

“I just said I’m not robbing you!” Yang Kai glanced at him sideways before shouting in a low tone, “Scram!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Cheng Tai felt like was being pardoned, quickly grabbed his Space Ring, and fled, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

After Cheng Tai disappeared, Yang Kai landed leisurely next to the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus as he looked at the dark spirit grass in his hand and muttered to himself, “With this Black Dragon Grass, I only need three more ingredients to refine this lotus into the Extraordinary Treasure Pill... En, I have all the others but these last three will be somewhat difficult to find, I hope someone else will have them.”

As he spoke, Yang Kai glanced around and now began hoping more people would be attracted by the emergence of this Extraordinary Treasure Lotus so he could ‘borrow’ the necessary materials from them to refine the Spirit Pill he was hoping to.

With the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus as the main ingredient, a Heaven-defying Spirit Pill called the Extraordinary Treasure Pill could be refined. This Spirit Pill had an even more powerful effect than swallowing the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus raw.

One Extraordinary Treasure Pill would be enough to raise a cultivator’s chances of becoming an Emperor by ten percent!

If possible, Yang Kai hoped to refine this Extraordinary Treasure Lotus into pills when it matured! This way, not only could it be preserved for a long time, but it could also bring out the full efficacies of the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus. However... accomplishing this would not be easy, especially since he was currently lacking some of the necessary materials for the refinement.
