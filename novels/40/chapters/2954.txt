Yang Kai gave them a curious glance, “You know about Demon Beasts?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The man immediately shielded his wife behind him and looked warily at Yang Kai, “Are you a member of the Demon Race?”

“Hm?” Now Yang Kai was truly surprised this time. This man was able to say the words ‘Demon Beast’ and they actually knew about the Demon Race as well, which seemed very unusual.

The man became even warier of him and gritted his teeth, “Did you come from Demon Fury City?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “I have no idea what this Demon Fury City is, nor am I a member of any Demon Race. This is most likely a misunderstanding…”

But he suddenly frowned as he spoke, and the reason for that was because he suddenly felt the world shake. The Word Principles filling their surroundings seemed to have begun distorting and changing. He looked over to Zhu Qing, who also showed a look of astonishment.

The World Principles had really begun to change, and it had to be a big change for such obvious signs to appear.

“Kill us.” The man’s face went ashen. He no longer had any hope to live. Liao Guan Shi was devoured by a Demon Beast, and two powerful Demon Race-like Masters suddenly appeared in front of them. They had no way out of this and he could only hold onto his wife tight with the hope that he could enjoy a moment of warmth before death’s approach.

“It’s easy to die if that’s what you want. There’s no need for me to do anything.” Yang Kai walked up to the front of an array. The only thing inside of this cave was this array that was erected here, so it was particularly conspicuous. Pointing to it, he asked, “Can we teleport to Human Imperial City with this?”

The man looked over with a bleak gaze, nodding, “Yes.”

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and investigated it briefly before mumbling, “It’s a Space Array, but something about it seems different.”

The man said, “It’s no use. If you want to activate the array, you have to have the Human Sovereign Seal.”

“Don’t you have the Human Sovereign Seal? Why don’t you go?” Yang Kai turned to look at them.

The man explained, “It has to be the Human Sovereign Seal that Liao Guan Shi has, which is naturally a primary seal. Only the primary seal can activate the array for teleportation. What we have is only a secondary seal, there’s no way it can activate the array.”

“So that’s how it is!” Yang Kai nodded to express his understanding.

Having seen no action from Yang Kai, and instead finding him studying the array seriously instead, the man asked hesitantly, “Are you really not from the Demon Race?”

Yang Kai asked him while studying the array, “There are Demons in this world?”

The man spoke, “Yes. Our Human Race and the Demon Race are on opposing sides, but we have coexisted in this world for countless years. It’s true you don’t look like a Demon, but why do you have a… Demon Beast?”

Yang Kai did not answer his question. The origins of the black puppy were a little strange, and also a little troublesome to explain, so he changed the subject, “Despite coexisting with Demons, it’s amazing you’re still alive.”

The man explained, “Human Imperial City shelters us. Without Human Imperial City, there’s no way we would still be alive.”

Yang Kai said thoughtfully, “Is it related to the transformation of the World Principles?”

“That’s right. In a short while, the World Principles will change, and when that time comes, our Human Race won’t be able to walk outside safely while the Demon Race can traverse it freely like fish in water. During these times, not a single person dares to leave Human Imperial City, otherwise, if ten were to go, only one would make it back alive.”

“Then, previously, the World Principles were suitable for the survival of the Human Race, forcing the Demon Race onto the defensive?”

“That’s how it is.”

“What a mysterious world.” Yang Kai had an astonished expression on his face.

The man smiled bitterly, “We have been here since birth. No one knows why this world is like this. Perhaps, only Lord Human Sovereign has some insight into the matter.”

“Lord Human Sovereign huh…” Yang Kai heard the man mention this title several times and he couldn’t help but pry, “Is he the ruler of Human Imperial City?”

The man answered solemnly, “Naturally, he’s the leader of the Human Race! He watches over Human Imperial City and protects all Humans!” His words were filled with respect, seemingly holding this Human Sovereign in high esteem.

Yang Kai smiled and continued studying the Spirit Array.

Signs of the World Principles’ transformation were becoming clearer and clearer and a large amount of Demon Qi had begun manifesting in the surrounding air, as well as other strange phenomena. The couple had already circulated their energy to form a protective layer around themselves, but it looked like they wouldn’t be able to hold out for long. Once the protection was broken, they would immediately be corrupted by the Demon Qi and undergo demonification.

Zhu Qing was a member of the Dragon Clan, so she didn’t feel much of a threat even in this environment; however, she still circulated her Dragon Qi lightly in order to dissolve the corruption of the encroaching Demon Qi.

The black puppy was the only one whose eyes lit up at these changes and was now constantly sniffing around, appearing quite excited.

It had the bloodline of the Abyssal Returner, which meant it was a descendant of an Ancient Demon Beast to begin with, so it was naturally joyful at the surge of Demon Qi.

“Alright, all of you come over.” Yang Kai called them over.

Zhu Qing, carrying the black puppy, walked over and stood beside him.

The couple were hesitant as the man asked, “What are you trying to do?”

“Teleport to Human Imperial City.”

The man was shocked, “You don’t even have the Human Sovereign Seal, how do you plan to enter Human Imperial City?”

Yang Kai snickered, “Who told you that you can’t go to Human Imperial City without that Human Sovereign Seal thing? If you keep hesitating, it’ll be too late. Do you want to live or die?”

The man was still hesitant, but the woman gave him a tug.

Finally, they made up their minds and nodded, “Alright. I’ll trust you this once.”

Yang Kai grinned, “I hope you can keep Liao Guan Shi’s matter a secret.”

The man smiled bitterly, “We gain no benefit from exposing you, only harm. Besides… Human Imperial City has its own way to figure out the truth. In fact, I think it’s better if you don’t go to Human Imperial City. If you really do enter, even if you’re strong, it’ll still be useless.”

“We can’t say that for sure!” As he said that, Yang Kai’s face turned solemn, and his Space Principles began to ripple out.

The four of them were standing on top of a Space Array that was connected to Human Imperial City, and under normal circumstances, they had to receive the Human Sovereign Seal from a Steward like Liao Guan Shi, then have him activate the Space Array to teleport them.

But these tedious steps were merely a disguise. It was just a means for Human Imperial City to control the Human Race, and such trickery was easily dismantled in front of Yang Kai, who was well versed in the Dao of Space.

Yang Kai used his Space Principles to connect to the other side of the Space Array directly, eliminating the need for the Human Sovereign Seal altogether.

As a light flashed, the couple were both wide-eyed. They could hardly believe that the Space Array was really working, and for a moment, they were both overjoyed. It felt as if they had been pulled back from death’s door.

Due to extreme changes of the World Principles around them, the World Energy had become flooded with Demon Qi, which was hardly suitable for a Human to survive under. Even if they were strong enough to temporarily resist the encroaching Demon Qi, they would eventually run out of strength if they remained under such circumstances for too long. When that happened, they would be completely corrupted by the Demon Qi, lose their sanity, and turn into Demons.

A moment later, the light inside the cave vanished and the four people on the Spirit Array disappeared.

…..

Noise suddenly poured in from all directions, which made them feel a little uncomfortable.

Yang Kai looked around and discovered that the four of them had arrived in a prosperous city with a giant Space Array beneath their feet. There was a constant stream of new figures appearing on top of the Spirit Array of varying levels of cultivation, each with different expressions on their faces. Some overlooked the world with joy while others had gloomy expressions, still others were badly injured and hissing in pain.

Quite evidently, these people were just like Yang Kai and his group. They had just returned from the outside to escape from the changes in the World Principles.

Yang Kai even saw the presence of many Emperor Realm Masters around them.

So, the four of them were not too conspicuous as they stood on top of this huge array.

The entire city seemed particularly prosperous with crowds of people brushing past each other in an endless stream. There were stores set up everywhere, selling all kinds of the world’s specialties, the calls of vendors reaching the ears of those passing by. It was almost like being thrown into a marketplace of the mortal world.

It was a first for Zhu Qing to arrive at such a lively place, so she couldn’t help but look around with a bit of surprise.

Well-dressed guards were walking through the streets, marching neatly in their uniforms. One could tell at a glance that these were the protectors of order in Human Imperial City.

But the cultivation of these guards wasn’t very high. The one leading the team was a First-Order Emperor while the rest were all Dao Source Realm cultivators. However, no matter how strong the cultivators on the streets were, they all avoided them as if they were snakes and scorpions, seemingly quite afraid of them.

Yang Kai even clearly saw a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master move out of their way.

Seniority in this world seemed to not be distinguished by cultivation realm. The couple they met before were clearly weaker than them in terms of cultivation, yet they did not have the respect a weaker cultivator would generally hold for a Master. This was even more obvious with that Liao Guan Shi. His cultivation could hardly match any of theirs, yet he was still able to boss the couple around while they were powerless to fight back.

There were people flying in the sky, but not many, and their cultivation levels were also diverse.

“This is goodbye. Take care, you two.” The man seemed to be in a hurry to separate from Yang Kai and Zhu Qing so as not to be dragged into their troubles, and that was why he immediately bid farewell after composing himself.

Sensing his thoughts, Yang Kai gave him a casual response.

The woman suddenly said, “A piece of advice for the two of you. Those with the leaf emblem embroidered on their chests are not to be offended. The more leaves there are, the nobler their identity. This is not your original world and we do not follow the law of the jungle here. In addition, Liao Guan Shi’s death likely cannot be concealed for long. It’s best if you two leave Human Imperial City once the World Principles change again.”

“Many thanks.” Yang Kai smiled.

When the woman was just about to say something else, the man had already dragged her into the crowd, and they soon disappeared.

“What an interesting world.” Yang Kai looked around with great curiosity.

The entire Human Imperial City seemed to be enveloped by a giant, magnificent barrier. This was even more obvious as the changes in the World Principles in the outside world could not be felt inside of Human Imperial City in the slightest. The Principles here seemed much closer to those of the Star Boundary. Looking up, the sky seemed to be in chaos, with countless vortices that could swallow one’s sight covering the sky. After staring for a while, it actually made one dizzy.

“Is Zhu Lie here?” Yang Kai turned to Zhu Qing and asked.

Zhu Qing answered, “I need to find a place to perform the Secret Technique to be sure, but I hope he is.”

Yang Kai smiled, “Don’t worry. He’s pretty strong, so even if he’s out there, he won’t be in any trouble so soon.”

“En.” Zhu Qing gently nodded, subconsciously stroking the black puppy in her arms. Ah Wang felt so comforted that he narrowed his eyes happily. It was not even known whether Liao Guan Shi, who had been swallowed into its stomach, was still alive or not.
