The self-destruction of a First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator is indeed powerful, but it couldn’t threaten a Third-Order Origin King, so the thin cultivator’s act of defiance would at most be able to dirty Lu Bai Chuan a bit and cause him to lose face.

But, it was mainly how madly obsessed this thin cultivator was going against him, which annoyed Lu Bai Chuan.

What Lu Bai Chuan was far more concerned about, though, was the young man who suddenly appeared in front of him. As soon as this young man appeared, his Domain had instantly been suppressed, saving the thin Zhang Family cultivator.

The aura coming from this unknown young man made Lu Bai Chuan aware that he was no weaker than himself.

But since when did the Zhang Family have another Third-Order Origin King? Lu Bai Chuan was puzzled and did not hesitate to open up some distance between them.

Yang Kai looked at him faintly, not giving chase and instead reaching out and tapping the thin cultivator’s back. The violent power which was rioting inside the thin cultivator’s body instantly steadied and the man himself staggered and nearly fell to the ground.

Raising his head, the thin cultivator looked at Yang Kai who appeared suddenly with a blank face, seemingly in a daze. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Old Third, get back here!” The fat cultivator was dripping cold sweat as he hurriedly called out to the thin cultivator. Seeing that he did not move though, the fat cultivator rushed over and dragged his companion back.

“Who is Your Excellency?” Lu Bai Chuan stared at Yang Kai, instinctively feeling that the other party was a tricky opponent, causing his tone to become serious, “You don’t seem to be a Zhang Family member, right?”

Yang Kai smiled and shook his head, “You’re right.”

“Then who are you and why are you interfering in this private affair?” Lu Bai Chuan frowned.

Just now, Yang Kai’s casual move had made him realize that Yang Kai’s strength was not inferior to his own, so he did not want to make an enemy of him if possible and tried to probe Yang Kai’s background and relationship with the Zhang Family.

“For certain reasons, the Zhang Family’s affairs are now my concern,” Yang Kai grinned meaningfully.

“What does friend mean? Since the Zhang Family’s affairs are now your concern, should you not also give a reason? Moreover, this old master is only here to welcome a bride into his family, not to embarrass the Zhang Family in any way, is this friend perhaps misunderstanding something?”

“Lu Bai Chuan, cease your meaningless rhetoric! My husband was killed by you inside the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, so our hatred is absolutely irreconcilable!” At that moment, the middle-aged beauty soared out from the manor, a sword in hand, screaming as she landed beside Yang Kai.

Lu Bai Chuan smiled upon hearing these words and said, “Sister-in-law, this Lu is also deeply saddened by Brother Zhang’s death, but it truly has nothing to do with this Lu. How can I explain it to you so that you will believe me?”

“This little brother has brought back the last words of my husband, yet you still dare to quibble?” The middle-aged beauty pointed to Yang Kai as she grit her teeth and shouted.

Lu Bai Chuan narrowed his eyes and immediately turned his attention to Yang Kai, “So you met Brother Zhang inside the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda?”

When he asked these words, a look of pleasant surprise filled his expression, as if this was extremely good news for him.

Yang Kai replied calmly, “Indeed I met Brother Zhang, but why does that make you so happy? Heh heh, did you perhaps think of something?”

Lu Bai Chuan’s face changed several times before he whispered, “If that’s the case, then is ‘that’ thing with you?”

“You guessed right. Yes, that thing is with me. Do you want it?” Yang Kai looked at him lightly.

At that moment, a trace of guilt suddenly flashed across the face of the middle-aged woman as she secretly blamed herself for being indiscreet, exposing the secret that Yang Kai had obtained the Dao Source Fruit.

Lu Bai Chuan and Zhang Gao Xuan had entered the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda together, and had also travelled together inside the pagoda, so it wasn’t a surprise if they had found the Dao Source Fruit together as well.

Even if the beautiful woman did not directly reveal that the Dao Source Fruit was with Yang Kai, with Lu Bai Chuan’s shrewdness, how could he not infer it?

“It seems that you killed Brother Zhang because of that thing,” Yang Kai looked at Lu Bai Chuan contemptuously.

“Hmph, even if it weren’t for that, I would still have done so, but that is my Lu and Zhang Families’ business. Now that it is with you, this Lu has something to say to this friend.”

“And what might that be?” Yang Kai looked at him with interest.

Lu Bai Chuan’s expression turned serious as his lips began to squirm, seemingly sending a message to Yang Kai.

In that instant though, Yang Kai smiled meaningfully as he leapt up into the air. The moment he did so, a small black snake burst out of the ground silently and bit towards where Yang Kai’s leg was a moment ago.

Everyone on the scene was taken by surprise when the little black snake appeared from the ground, none of them having detected it before it showed itself.

“Friend is truly sinister!” Yang Kai said in a condescending tone as he looked down at Lu Bai Chuan with a sneer, “It seems that Brother Zhang was attacked by you in this way and then killed by its poison, yes?”

As he spoke, Yang Kai flicked his wrist and sent out a Golden Blood Thread that swiftly wrapped up the little black snake.

Lu Bai Chuan hadn’t expected Yang Kai to be so alert and able to avoid such a concealed attack. He had used the same move against Zhang Gao Xuan inside the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda and at the time it had worked perfectly.

Seeing that his attempt had failed and that he was at a disadvantage, Lu Bai Chuan hurriedly moved his lips and the black snake immediately tried to retreat underground, like it had received some kind of order.

But it was too late. The Golden Blood Thread had already wrapped up the little snake and was rapidly constricting it.

*Chi Chi...*

The snake struggled hard but no matter how it tried, it was unable to escape from the Golden Blood Thread. The Golden Blood Thread continued to tighten and it was not long before the black snake’s skin was cut open and blood began leaking from its body.

“Stop!” Lu Bai Chuan shouted as he summoned out a war-hammer artifact and poured his strength into it. This hammer flashed with dark blue sparks before it rapidly shot an arc of lightning out towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes as he realized that this war-hammer was a high-grade artifact. Not wanting to act rashly, he swiftly dodged to avoid the blow.

With a hissing sound, accompanied by a faint crack, the black snake was strangled to death by the Golden Blood Thread and slivered into several pieces. As its corpse fell to the ground, the head continued to struggle about, looking particularly fierce and vicious.

But with such an injury, it was destined to die.

“My spirit snake!” Lu Bai Chuan roared in anguish, as if his wife or daughter had been snatched from him, his eyes turning bloodshot as he glared towards Yang Kai, who was still standing up in the air, and roared, “For killing my snake, I’ll have your head!”

Saying so, he poured his strength into the war-hammer in his hands recklessly.

With a loud crackling noise, lightning arcs swirled around the hammer wildly and even the surrounding World Energy became turbulent.

Lu Bai Chuan lifted his arms and hurled the war-hammer out towards Yang Kai with a Heaven destroying force.

“Little Brother, be careful! That is the Lu Family’s Thunder Wind Hammer, an Origin King Grade High-Rank artifact, don’t try to confront it head on!” The Zhang Family’s old matriarch shouted from below as she finally managed to arrive on the scene with the help of Zhang Ruo Xi.

How could Yang Kai not understand the power of this artifact? The Thunder Attribute Energy which pulsed from it was violent and domineering, so even with his intrepid physique, he did not dare despise it.

Waving his hand, Yang Kai sent out dozens of Golden Blood Threads and wove them into a sturdy net to intercept the Thunder Wind Hammer.

*Hong long long...*

There was a loud series of bangs as the Golden Blood Thread net was continuously strained and lightning arcs darted about. The scene of the two forces opposing one another was quite a thrilling sight to behold.

“Grandma, can this Sir win?” Zhang Ruo Xi, who was supporting the old woman, looked at Yang Kai and asked. Although she was not very old, she at least understood that the Zhang Family’s safety was all tied to Yang Kai’s ability, so she couldn’t help feeling nervous.

The old woman didn’t answer; after all, she didn’t know much about Yang Kai, only that he was a Third-Order Origin King. However, Lu Bai Chuan was also a Third-Order Origin King.

Comparing opponents of the same level was always difficult.

But looking at the situation right now, Yang Kai seemed calm and relaxed while Lu Bai Chuan wore a violent expression and was clearly going all out, perhaps because his precious spirit snake had been killed.

High in the sky, the golden net condensed from Golden Blood Threads and the Thunder Wind Hammer competed on equal ground.

Lu Bai Chuan suddenly shouted loudly, and as he opened his mouth, he spat out a ray of light which quickly transformed into another artifact.

The old woman’s expression changed drastically when she saw this artifact and cried out in shock, “Silver Moon Purple Frost Sabre!”

The Zhang and Lu Families had been close for centuries, so the old woman knew a bit about the Lu Family’s most precious artifacts and quickly recognized the one Lu Bai Chuan had summoned.

The Silver Moon Purple Frost Sabre, like the Thunder Wind Hammer, was an Origin King Grade High-Rank artifact. These were the two most powerful artifacts owned by the Lu Family. Generally speaking, they would be held by different individuals, but now they both appeared in Lu Bai Chuan’s hands.

“Be careful, Little Brother, this Silver Moon Purple Frost Sabre was originally a Dao Source Grade artifact refined by an Artifact Refining Grandmaster, but due to some sort of failure in the refinement process, it only ended up as an Origin King Grade High-Rank. Nevertheless, it still contains a trace of Principle Strength,” The old woman opened her mouth to warn.

“Old thing, shut your mouth!” Lu Bai Chuan was furious.

He was locked in a life or death fight with Yang Kai but the old woman was completely exposing all his secrets, so how could Lu Bai Chuan not be angry? With a glance, he silently signalled to the other members of the bridal procession, and they swiftly turned to attack the Zhang Family.

In this team, there were three Origin Kings, and although these three were just First-Order Origin Kings, that was more than enough to deal with the current Zhang Family.

Seeing the Lu Family’s people rushing over, the old woman gripped her cane tightly and exchanged a glance with the middle-aged woman. Nodding to one another, they bravely led the Zhang Family’s people into battle against the enemy.

After Lu Bai Chuan summoned the Silver Moon Purple Frost Sabre, he immediately gripped it tightly and sneered over at Yang Kai, “Boy, I won’t waste my breath with you, hand over that thing and I’ll spare your life, otherwise you’ll die under my blade!”

“Just where are you getting all your confidence from?” Yang Kai laughed and scornfully beckoned to him, “If you want to do it, hurry up and do it, I’m quite interested in the power of your sabre.”

“Since you refuse a toast, you must drink a loss!” Lu Bai Chuan was thoroughly enraged now and shouted, “In that case, this Lu will let you witness his might!”

As soon as these words fell, he held up the Silver Moon Purple Frost Sabre in front of his chest and spat out a mouthful of Blood Essence onto it, causing it to hum slightly as a trace of Principle Strength began to radiate from it.
