“Palace Master!” Hua Qing Si elegantly bowed.

Yang Kai nodded, “Do you know about the situation?”

Hua Qing Si nodded in acknowledgement, “Sir Embodiment has already informed me. If Palace Master needs High Heaven Palace’s cooperation, please ask!”

Yang Kai shook his head, “In this war, everyone participating is an Open Heaven Realm Master, so the Star Boundary won’t be able to help. You just have to take care of yourself.”

Hua Qing Si stated solemnly, “I understand, then please be careful.”

“En, let me check your Dao Seal!” Yang Kai stretched out his hand and placed it on her forehead. Hua Qing Si quickly relaxed her mind and body, allowing Yang Kai to examine her.

A moment later, Yang Kai withdrew his hand and smiled at Hua Qing Si, “Wonderful, you can advance directly to the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm in the future!”

Although he had a speculation in his mind after investigating the situation of his parents’ Dao Seals, it was finally confirmed after examining Hua Qing Si’s Dao Seal.

Hua Qing Si’s aptitude was undoubtedly better than his parents’. His parents’ Dao Seals were stable enough to condense Fourth-Order Elements, or even Fifth-Order Elements, so there was no reason for Hua Qing Si to not be able to.

As expected, Hua Qing Si’s Dao Seal was stabler than his parents’. In other words, the risk of breaking through to the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm was basically non-existent for her.

“Is there anyone else in the Star Boundary who has condensed their Dao Seals?” Yang Kai asked.

Hua Qing Si shook her head, “Right now, there is only your parents, myself, and Palace Master Lan Xun; just us four.”

When Yang Kai had last left the Star Boundary, he basically took all the Emperor Realm Masters with him in one fell swoop, and the ones who remained weren’t very strong. Although the cultivation of the Star Boundary’s cultivators had quickly risen all these years with the World Tree’s nourishment and the recovery of the Star Boundary, cultivation still required some time. The Star Boundary cultivators could only condense their Dao Seals by raising their cultivation to the peak of the Emperor Realm.

As for Lan Xun’s condition, Yang Kai didn’t have time to carefully investigate it at the time, but after thinking about it, compared to Hua Qing Si, her aptitude was already top-notch.

“This matter…” Yang Kai wanted to say that this matter should be kept under wraps for now, but then he remembered that Heavenly Sword Union was nearly upon them, and if he couldn’t stop this formidable enemy, he would be doomed. At that time, even the Star Boundary would find it difficult to survive, so he quickly changed his mind and stated, “Wait for my return.”

Hua Qing Si nodded her understanding.

Yang Kai gave Embodiment a few more instructions before taking out a Space Beacon and testing it out.

As expected, he was unable to directly return to the Territory Gate. Although the Space Beacon allowed people to instantly teleport from one beacon to another it was paired with, there was still a limit to their range.

The Territory Gate was trillions of kilometres away from the Star Boundary, a distance far beyond its limit.

The reason he was able to instantly return to the Star Boundary from the Territory Gate was undoubtedly because of his connection with the Star Boundary itself. It was equivalent to the power of the Star Boundary pulling him back, but it was impossible to use this process in reverse. There was no place for him to borrow strength on the Territory Gate’s side after all.

However, this was exactly what he wanted. Although Heavenly Sword Union shouldn’t have been able to arrive at the Star Boundary’s Great Territory before him, Yang Kai had to take precautions to be on the safe side.

While returning to the Territory Gate, he could also investigate the route.

In a flash, Yang Kai left High Heaven Palace and arrived in the depths of the void, rushing towards the Territory Gate. Every once in a while, Yang Kai would place a Space Beacon for emergencies.

Along the way, everything was calm and peaceful, and there was no sign of any Heavenly Sword Union cultivators, causing Yang Kai to slowly relax.

After leaving behind a dozen or so Space Beacons, Yang Kai finally returned to the Territory Gate.

Void Land’s Open Heaven Realm Masters waiting by the Territory Gate immediately noticed Yang Kai’s return, so Zhan Wu Hen and the others surrounded him and asked with concern, “Is everything alright on the Star Boundary’s side?”

Yang Kai sorted out his thoughts and told them everything he was able to learn.

Many of the Great Emperors were shocked.

“That’s great.” Mo Huang smiled with relief, “The World Tree is actually so amazing. Not only can it swallow the Power of the Stars and void to nourish the World Energy of the Star Boundary, it can even allow one to cultivate more easily and condense a stronger Dao Seal.”

Duan Hong Chen also wore a look of fascination, “If that’s the case, wouldn’t the Star Boundary give birth to many Open Heaven Realm seedlings in the future?”

Zhan Wu Hen, on the other hand, was a bit worried, “Both fortune and misfortune lie together, if we don’t handle it well, great wealth can sometimes turn into disaster. Don’t forget why Zuo Quan Hui is coming to the Star Boundary.”

All of the Great Emperors were quick-witted, so when they heard Zhan Wu Hen’s words, how could they not know what he was worried about? It was like a bucket of cold water had been poured all over the excitement in their hearts, calming everyone down.

“We have to keep the changes of the Star Boundary under wraps.” Zhan Wu Hen looked at Yang Kai solemnly, “Otherwise, I’m afraid even the Cave Heavens and Paradises will become greedy.”

Even with Yang Ying Feng and Dong Su Zhu’s rather poor aptitudes, they now had the qualifications to break through to the Fourth-Order or even Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm. If a true top talent were to grow up in the Star Boundary, it would be extremely easy for him or her to advance to the Sixth-Order, and it might even be possible for a Heaven defying genius to reach the Seventh-Order.

The current Star Boundary could simply be called a cradle for Open Heaven Realm Masters! It could easily produce a large number of Open Heaven Realm seedlings, and this was only the beginning. Who knew what could become of the Star Boundary given more time?

What Zhan Wu Hen said was definitely not an exaggeration. If the Cave Heavens and Paradises came to know about the situation of the Star Boundary, everyone would probably want to take a share of it. At that time, would the Star Boundary still be the Star Boundary?

Not to mention, there was still the World Tree in the Star Boundary. Although the World Tree did not show any signs of fruiting, who could guarantee that it would not produce World Fruits after countless years? This was the only Heaven-defying treasure in the world that could allow an Open Heaven Realm Master to advance an Order directly without any side-effects, as well as increase their natural limit. Who would not covet such a treasure?

As Zhan Wu Hen spoke, he unconsciously glanced towards Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue.

Void Land’s forces were comprised entirely of their own people, so they would keep all the secrets to themselves if there were any. The only two outsiders were Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven.

“Senior Brother Qing and Senior Sister Su are both trustworthy people, I’ll remind them later,” Yang Kai stated.

Zhan Wu Hen shook his head, “I’m afraid this matter won’t be as simple as you think; after all, they are disciples of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. Although they have some friendship with you and are willing to keep some secrets for you, there are always exceptions.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help laughing, “Then what should we do? Senior Brother Qing and Senior Sister Su came to help Void Land in its time of need, we can’t just kill them to silence them.”

Zhan Wu Hen shook his head and stated, “Naturally, I’m not asking you to do such an ungrateful thing. What I want to say is that instead of letting them hide the situation of the Star Boundary from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, it would be better to let them know the truth and use the Yin-Yang Cave Heaven’s power to protect the Star Boundary.”

Mo Huang quickly interrupted, “No!”

Zhan Wu Hen turned to look at him, whereupon Mo Huang explained, “Yin-Yang Cave Heaven is one of the 36 Cave Heavens. Such a huge entity must have its own factions. Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue are part of Xu Ling Gong’s lineage, and with the status of a Yin-Yang Cave Heaven Son-in-law, Xu Ling Gong naturally views Yang Kai in a favourable light. For small matters, everything is easy to discuss, but I’m afraid that Yin-Yang Cave Heaven’s other High-Rank Open Heaven Masters will have some other intentions. What if the person sent by Yin-Yang Cave Heaven to investigate is not Xu Ling Gong?”

This was also a problem, causing everyone to fall into contemplation.

Yang Kai clapped his hands and diverted the topic, “Let’s talk about this later. Right now, the ones we need to deal with are Heavenly Sword Union and Zuo Quan Hui. If my guess is right, they should be arriving soon.”

All the Great Emperors nodded slightly, “Good!”

20 Sixth-Order Masters and 1,300 cultivators below the Sixth-Order, almost all the Open Heaven Realm Masters from Void Land, were quietly waiting in ambush outside the Territory Gate for Heavenly Sword Union.

Now that things had reached this point, there was no need to conceal their strength anymore. Yang Kai had hidden Iron Blood Great Emperor and the others for this long to catch Zuo Quan Hui off guard; however, while man plans, the Heavens laugh. Hei He and Lan Xun had met with an accident, and Zuo Quan Hui had learned of the location of the Star Boundary and the World Tree. The battlefield inevitably shifted from Void Territory to the Star Boundary’s Territory.

In this battle, they would definitely give it their all. In this battle, one side would die!

The newly advanced Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master naturally couldn’t be hidden any longer.

Waiting was the greatest torture.

For half a month, the Territory Gate remained still and calm.

Yang Kai almost suspected that his judgement was wrong and that Zuo Quan Hui had no intention of coming to the Star Boundary, or else why would he have not seen his shadow even after such a long time?

However, there was a violent surge of energy a few days later. When Yang Kai opened his eyes, he saw the Territory Gate glowing and a colossal illusory phantom slowly emerging from it.

“They’re here!” Yang Kai’s eyes went wide as he raised his hand and summoned the Azure Dragon Spear. At the same time, all the Open Heaven Realm Masters of Void Land also noticed the changes of the Territory Gate and began circulating their World Force. In a flash, the void began to tremble and distort.

What everyone saw was Heavenly Sword Union’s Heavenly Sword Palace emerging from the Territory Gate.

A moment later, the Heavenly Sword Palace rushed out, entering the Great Territory where the Star Boundary was located.

Yang Kai raised his spear and pushed his World Force madly while shouting, “Kill!”

A Golden Crow let out a cry as a Great Sun rose into the sky from behind Yang Kai’s back. In this sun, a three-legged exotic bird could vaguely be seen flying about.

Facing such a large artifact like the Heavenly Sword Palace, Yang Kai did not hesitate to use his Golden Crow Casts the Sun Divine Manifestation in the opening salvo.

The Great Sun took its spot on the Azure Dragon Spear as Yang Kai thrust it forward, ignoring the barriers of space as it crashed towards the enemy fortress.

At the same time, rays of light from various Divine Abilities and artifacts shot towards the Heavenly Sword Palace like meteors.

In that instant, the entire void lit up as if it was daytime as waves of World Forces surged and crashed out!

When the Heavenly Sword Palace was shuttling through the Territory Gate, they had naturally activated a protective barrier, but under the might of the countless Divine Abilities and artifacts, this barrier didn’t even last for a breath before it shattered like a bubble.

The people from Heavenly Sword Palace seemed to panic for a moment. Although they had guessed that they would be ambushed after crossing through the Territory Gate, no one had expected this ambush to be so ruthless.

As far as the eye could see, there were nothing but enemies around them and all of them asked the same question, how did so many people arrive here ahead of them?
