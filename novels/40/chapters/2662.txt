Li Qing Yuan and the others were extremely distressed. Three Monster Kings wanted to join High Heaven Palace only for the position of Protector or Deacon. Their strength was naturally no better than these three Monster Kings, so wouldn’t they only be qualified to be ordinary disciples if they joined High Heaven Palace?

Of course, they couldn’t break away from their own Sects and join High Heaven Palace. Even now there seemed to be too many monsters, both metaphorically and literally, in this High Heaven Palace, not a place they could fit into comfortably.

With the addition of these three Monster Kings, High Heaven Palace would probably become the strongest Sect in the Northern Territory in the future, and once it developed, it would definitely surpass the glory of the Seeking Passion Sect.

Li Qing Yuan and the others seemed to vaguely see the figure of a formidable giant rising up before them, and this caused them to panic internally.

The good fortune Yang Kai experienced was driving these observers mad with envy and jealousy. With three Monster Kings here, it would be infinitely beneficial if any single one of them joined Yang Kai’s Sect.

What surprised everyone was that in the face of the three Monster Kings’ sincere requests, Yang Kai’s expression was quite uneasy as he grimaced, “We will discuss this matter at a later time!”

Li Qing Yuan and the others stared at him with their eyes widened, silently scolding Yang Kai for being unappreciative of something others could not have even if they begged for it, still wanting to discuss the matter again. Was there just something wrong with his head?

What was there to discuss? Agreeing right away was the only correct answer.

On the other hand, Xi Lei and the others looked at each other and knew what Yang Kai was worried about. Although it would be nothing for Yang Kai to ask for three Monster Kings from the Ancient Wild Lands with his connections with the three Divine Venerables, he obviously did not want to headhunt someone so rashly, especially subordinates of three Divine Spirits.

At the very least, Yang Kai had to discuss with Luan Feng and the others regarding this matter.

Understanding this, Xi Lei and the other three Monster Kings did not insist anymore.

After a moment of pondering, Xi Lei queried, “Young Master Yang, are you… going to kill these people?”

He asked casually, as if it wasn’t a thousand people before them but a thousand chickens. This caused everyone to stare at Yang Kai helplessly with pasty faces.

At this moment, they knew that the fate of their lives was in Yang Kai’s hands.

The dozen or so Emperor Realm Masters leading this group looked at Yang Kai with anxious smiles, afraid the order to kill would suddenly leak from his lips.

“Why should I do that? I have no grievances and no grudges against them.” Yang Kai waved his hand and effused with a gleeful smile, “Didn’t you hear that they said they came to congratulate this Young Master for establishing a Sect? Since they are here to offer congratulations, they are the guests of my High Heaven Palace.”

“Yes, yes, Young Master Yang is wise!” Li Qing Yuan sputtered, a look of joy for having survived a calamity filling his face.

He knew that since Yang Kai had said these words, he and the others would not need to worry about leaving here alive today, and he was grateful for his generosity.

Xi Lei nodded and apologized, “This Old Rhino was reckless.” In an instant, he changed the topic, barking at Li Qing Yuan and the others, “You bunch of trash! Since you are here to congratulate Young Master Yang, why don’t I see any gifts? Could all this talk of congratulations just be casual talk?”

Li Qing Yuan and the others were shocked by this accusation but quickly recovered, “We wouldn’t dare to. Gifts… We did bring some, we did.”

While speaking, the dozen Emperor Realms Masters quickly searched their Space Rings while resolute and hesitant looks interchanged on their faces.

In a short time, a dozen Space Rings were gathered in Li Qing Yuan’s hands. Walking over to Yang Kai with wobbly legs, Li Qing Yuan squeezed out an ugly smile, “Young Master Yang, this is just a small token to show our respect. I hope Young Master Yang will kindly accept.”

Yang Kai took these things casually without even checking the contents.

After plundering the Ancient Wild Lands and the Seeking Passion Sect’s Treasury, these dozen Space Rings were really nothing to him.

He nodded lightly, “Sect Master Li is thoughtful.”

Li Qing Yuan was unable to conceal the pain on his face. He had just offered a large part of his life’s savings for fear that Yang Kai would be dissatisfied.

It was estimated that the other Emperor Realm Masters felt the same way, otherwise, none of them would be displaying grievous expressions.

Who would have thought that Yang Kai would put away their gifts without even looking at them? If Lin Qing Yuan had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have shaved so much meat off his bones and instead just given a small gift.

“Good, good. Young Master Yang… If you have no other instructions, this Li will take his leave.” Li Qing Yuan was extremely aggrieved by the loss of his wealth and wanted to leave here as soon as possible.

“En, speaking of instructions, this Young Master does need your help with one thing,” Yang Kai began pleasantly.

“Ah…” Li Qing Yuan wiped the cold sweat on his forehead in panic, “I wonder what orders Young Master Yang has?”

Yang Kai smiled slightly and started, “Sect Master Li doesn’t need to be so nervous, I only need you to do something simple. You just need to spread the word that this Young Master has occupied this piece of land, and has established High Heaven Palace here!”

Li Qing Yuan calmed down instantly and let out a breath of relief, “So that’s the case!”

Yang Kai looked at him meaningfully, “What did Sect Master Li think it was?”

Li Qing Yuan replied rather embarrassingly, “This is nothing, just a trivial matter. Young Master Yang can count on this Li to complete this task. Although this Li is not so strong, he does have a good number of friends. This news will be spread out in the shortest possible time to avoid any harassment by uninformed rascals to your noble Palace.”

“That’s good,” Yang Kai smiled and nodded before glancing over at the other Emperor Realm Masters. “I also hope that everyone can do me this favour.”

The Emperor Realm Masters dared not to disagree, nodding their heads frantically while striking their chests in promise.

Yang Kai smiled lightly and cupped his fists, “Since you are all the heroes of Northern Territory, I will definitely invite all of you again when I officially open the gates of High Heaven Palace. I hope all of you will be in attendance to celebrate with me at that time.”

Bitterness filled everyone’s mouths at Yang Kai’s words, for they knew that when they attended this ceremony, they would need to prepare another large gift. However, with no other choice, they promised Yang Kai their attendance with forceful enthusiasm.

After a few more words, the group of outsiders escaped hurriedly.

“A bunch of trash, why did Young Master Yang bother giving them any face?” Xi Lei snorted coldly. Although he did not witness the conflict between Yang Kai and the Emperor Realm Masters, he could roughly guess what had happened. According to his own personality, he would have killed them all to baptise the foundation of High Heaven Palace.

Yang Kai chuckled and shook his head, “An extra friend means extra help. They are only interested in profit and had no grievances with me, so why should we kill ruthlessly? In the future, if High Heaven Palace is to gain a foothold in the Northern Territory, it’s not fitting to make enemies everywhere. You must know that everyone has their virtue, there might come a day that they will be of some use.”

Xi Lei flattered him immediately, “Young Master Yang is wise. This Old Rhino did not think it through.”

Yang Kai was indifferent to his flattery, simply raising his hand and beckoning, “Follow me.”

The three Monster Kings exchanged confused glances, but although they had no idea what Yang Kai was going to do, they all followed quickly.

After a short while, everyone came to Yang Kai’s newly-arranged Space Array.

Giving the three of them a glance, Yang Kai began, “Many thanks to three Monster Kings during this incident. Without you, Ice Heart Valley would not have been able to survive the siege so easily. This Young Master thanks you on behalf of Senior Bing Yun and the thousands of disciples of Ice Heart Valley.”

Xi Lei and others were shocked and replied hurriedly, “Young Master Yang is too serious, it was just a trivial matter.”

Yang Kai smiled, “It may be a trivial matter for you, but it is a life-saving grace for Ice Heart Valley. The two cannot be confused.” After a pause, Yang Kai added, “But now that the dust has settled, you three should return to the Ancient Wild Lands first.”

“Ah…” Ying Fei exclaimed disappointedly as he looked at Yang Kai hopefully, “Young Master Yang, you want us to go back now? It hasn’t even been a few days since we came out.”

“Yes, yes!” Xie Wu Wei nodded sharply and protested, “Young Master Yang, is there nothing else for us to do? Just say it, the three of us will do it without hesitation.”

Xi Lei suggested eagerly, “Young Master Yang can take us to wipe out the heads of the Northern Territory and unify it under his command!”

This proposal led Ying Fei and Xie Wu Wei to applaud loudly, the Monster Qi in their bodies surging as they really seemed eager to start a reign of terror in the Northern Territory with Yang Kai at the helm.

Yang Kai broke into laughter, “Even though you three are powerful, there are differences between Monsters and Humans. If you really made a big uproar in the Northern Territory, I am afraid it would attract a lot of trouble. I know what you are thinking, but this matter cannot be rushed. It’s unknown when that little girl will even be coming out, so just wait for news in the Ancient Lands.”

All three Monster Kings looked embarrassed when Yang Kai exposed their intentions.

After all, they had only submitted to Yang Kai because of his relationship with Zhang Ruo Xi. Without Zhang Ruo Xi, Yang Kai could not command such respect from them. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The three also knew that Yang Kai was telling the truth. Although they insisted on following Yang Kai to be in a favourable position, the point was that the Blood Gate had been hidden since it disappeared. No one knew when Zhang Ruo Xi would return, so it was useless for them to follow Yang Kai.

But it would also be a waste to just go back like this, so they were quite unwilling to do so. No one would know when, or even if Yang Kai would think of them again.

Xie Wu Wei’s eyes lit up suddenly as he proposed, “Young Master Yang, let them go back. This Xie will follow you to protect you. The world is not benevolent, and everyone may not be the same as they appear to be. It’s important to be careful while travelling the Star Boundary.”

“Why do we have to leave and you get to stay?” Ying Fei and Xi Lei asked in unison with a look of displeasure.

[This guy wants to reap the benefits all on his own, how shameless!]

Xie Wu Wei huffed, “Why now?”

Xi Lei yelled, “Come then, let us fight for it! Whoever is the strongest gets to stay, we will prove our capabilities with action, not just words! Since it’s to protect Young Master Yang, of course the strongest should win the right!”

Among the thirty-two Monster Kings and eight Great Kings, his strength was ranked in the top three, so in a solo battle, Ying Fei and Xie Wu Wei were definitely not his opponents.

Xie Wu Wei sneered at him, “This is a waste of this King’s time.”

Ying Fei nodded, “Brother Xie, it’s wrong for you to do this. Even if we really want to leave one person to protect Young Master Yang, it’s not going to be you. In regards to strength, Xi Lei is better than you, and in regards to speed and mobility, if this King claims to be second, no one would dare claim to be first. This King would make a far better Protector.”

Xie Wu Wei’s face twitched before he snorted coldly, “How about the fact that this Xie is Young Master Yang’s Soul Slave?”

As he spoke, with a surge of Divine Sense, a faint golden light appeared from his mind. The golden light was obviously a type of Soul restriction. It was branded in Xie Wu Wei’s Knowledge Sea, and Yang Kai’s aura was radiating from it, making its origins obvious.
