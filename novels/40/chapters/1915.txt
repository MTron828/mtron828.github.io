Chapter 1915, The Pain in the Neck is Finally Gone!

Lost, Zuo De was utterly defeated.

The moment the Pill Veins appeared before his eyes, Zuo De knew that he didn’t lose due to bad luck.

Not only could Yang Kai refine two pills at once but one of the pills even gave birth to Pill Veins. It was just impossible for him to compete with that.

Only now did the headstrong look on Zuo De’s face slowly vanish, replaced with a bit of frustration. He then took a deep breath and put the pill with the Pill Veins back in the jade bottle before cupping his fist at Yang Kai, conceding in a heavy voice, “Grandmaster Yang is indeed legendary, please accept this Zuo De’s bow!”

Yang Kai looked at Zuo De with surprise. He hadn’t expected these kinds of words to come out of his mouth at all. Judging by his unwilling look and character, Yang Kai believed that this old guy would not accept his defeat that easily. How could he have known for the things to end up like this?

Nodding gently, Yang Kai calmly said, “You flatter me.”

Watching Zuo De bowing to Yang Kai in respect, how could the other Alchemists be neglectful. They immediately cupped their fists and apologized, “Greetings Grandmaster Yang, we had eyes but failed to see. If we had offended Grandmaster Yang somehow, we ask Grandmaster to be magnanimous to forgive us.”

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Ignorance can be forgiven.”

Yang Kai’s generous bearing immediately attracted everyone’s heart.

Either way, Yang Kai himself was a Second-Order Origin King master. Just by his strength alone, he stood at the top of the entire Star Field. Coupled with his identity as the Origin King Grade Alchemist, it could even be said that he was the most valuable and noble person in the entire Star Field; a fact no one could refute.

What was rare was that he was broad-minded and paid no heed to everyone’s past rudeness. This was definitely in-line with how a Grandmaster would act.

Compared to Zuo De’s way of seeking publicity, it was a whole lot better.

“Ling’er, apologize to Grandmaster.” After having accepted his defeat, Grandmaster seemed to have turned over a new leaf. Not only did he correct his attitude, he even asked his granddaughter to apologize to Yang Kai.

A reluctant look instantly appeared on Zuo Ling’s face. She immediately slipped behind Zuo De to hide.

Just as Zuo De was about to reprimand her, Yang Kai smiled and said, “Kids are innocent about things. Grandmaster doesn’t need to make things difficult for her. I didn’t take it seriously either.”

A complicated look flashed in Zuo De’s eyes. He nodded and continued, “After seeing Grandmaster Yang today, this Zuo De has come to know many of my shortcomings. I have learned from my mistakes.”

After pausing, he turned to Ai Ou and continued, “President Ai Ou, this old man wants to retreat for a year and a half. After my retreat is over, this old man will abide by the bet with Grandmaster Yang every year. This old man will take his leave first!”

While speaking, he handed over the pills refined by Yang Kai and started leaving with Zuo Ling without receiving Ai Ou’s consent.

Ai Ou didn’t stop him either. He only said, “Goodbye, Grandmaster.”

He knew that Zuo De had no face to stay here. It was already hard for him to sincerely apologize to Yang Kai in such a calm and upright manner, to remain would be incredibly uncomfortable. Long-time famous people like Zuo De would always try to save their faces.

“Honoured Teacher, wait for me,” After watching Zuo De leave, how could Zhan Yuan continue to stay here? He shouted and hurriedly chased after Zuo De with intestines blue with regret for opposing Yang Kai at every step and corner, mocking him again and again.

(Ash: Intestines turned blue with regret means regretting his ass off.)

Had he known that Yang Kai was this capable, how could he have been so ignorant? And it was not too late to please Yang Kai.

Yang Kai, watching Zuo De’s depressed and old back, heaved a slight sigh.

Ai Ou’s brow twitched, noticing Yang Kai’s sigh. He promptly walked over and asked, “Grandmaster Yang, why are you sighing?”

After seeing Yang Kai’s Alchemy skills, Ai Ou immediately changed how he addressed Yang Kai. Brother was intimate while addressing Yang Kai as Grandmaster was respectful. It showed that Yang Kai’s status in Ai Ou’s mind had undergone a huge change.

[In the entire Star Field, Yang Kai is the only one who can refine a Mid-Rank Origin King Grade pill with Pill Veins, and I heard that he has a pretty good relationship with Xue Yue. He has even come to Water Moon Star for Xue Yue.] Ai Ou was already thinking of ways to keep Yang Kai in the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce.

[He is absolutely far more valuable than a Foreign Elder like Zuo De.]

“I’m feeling sorry for Grandmaster Zuo De,” Yang Kai calmly said.

“Hmm!?” Ai Ou was perplexed. “What do you mean?”

“Grandmaster Zuo De’s Alchemic Dao will not progress even an inch further in the future.” Yang Kai slowly shook his head. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ai Ou’s face changed slightly. After he gave it a thought, he suddenly seemed to have realized something. He promptly asked, “Is it because of Grand Alchemic Dao Tone?”

“Mhmm, Grandmaster has questioned the voice of the Heavenly Way and is lucky to have woken up in time. Otherwise, I’m afraid he would not have been able to keep his Alchemy skills. He would have been excluded from the Alchemic Dao and would have never been able to refine pills again.”

Ai Ou was taken aback. “The Grand Alchemic Dao Tone actually has such an effect!?”

Yang Kai looked at Ai Ou with a smile. “President Ai Ou, if you were rejected by Martial Dao, your foundation would be ruined as well.”

Ai Ou turned earnest and said, “If the Martial Dao Heavenly Tone was the one ringing today, this King would not have missed the opportunity. I sure would have done my best to comprehend it.”

“Martial Dao Heavenly Tone... it’s too far away.” Yang Kai shook his head.

Even he was caught by surprise when he had triggered the Grand Alchemic Dao Tone. He really hadn’t expected this to happen. Because Yang Kai was competing with an Origin King Grade Alchemist and also refining a Mid-Rank Origin Grade Spirit Pill, Yang Kai was just thinking of going all out. He had no other thoughts in his mind.

When he made use of all his knowledge in the True Alchemic Way, he had triggered that Heavenly Manifestation, unearthing the ultimate mystery bred by Heaven and Earth itself.

Now that he gave it a thought, Yang Kai found it to be incredible. If he was asked to do it again, he would not be able to trigger the Grand Alchemic Dao Tone.

“Sir President, aren’t you busy?” An Alchemist suddenly glared at Ai Ou.

He was a Mid-Rank Origin Grade Alchemist, just like Zhan Yuan. Generally, he would be extremely respectful to Ai Ou, but seeing this man take such a rude stance today, like he wasn’t afraid of him, had caught Ai Ou by surprise.

“Not that much.” Ai Ou had no idea when he had offended the other party, and why the other party was asking as such.

“Sir President deals with all the affairs of the entire Chamber of Commerce. How can you not be busy? President, you are needed upstairs.”

“That’s right, indeed! President, many things are waiting for you to deal with. What are you still doing here?”

“We respectfully send off Sir President!” All Alchemists said in unison.

Ai Ou looked at the hundreds of Alchemists with mouth agape. Suddenly, he was struck with a realization. Surprised, he burst into laughter before speaking, “So that’s what you mean... why didn’t you say so earlier?”

He kept shaking his head while speaking. He then scolded everyone with a smile hung on his lips, “I guess this King is unwelcome here.”

“President, you are really so wordy.” Some Alchemists were dissatisfied. They had been waiting to ask Yang Kai, Grandmaster Yang, about Alchemy, but President Ai Ou had been going on and on here, occupying Grandmaster’s time. They found it really loathsome, and if they could beat him up, they would have already started beating him to the point that even his mother couldn’t recognize him.

Ai Ou turned serious, letting out a cold snort. “This King just remembered. Who was it that said they wanted to leave my Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce? Come on up and let this King take a look.”

As soon as Ai Ou’s said this, many Alchemists couldn’t help but shrink their necks, hurriedly hiding in the crowd, lest Ai Ou targeted them.

Everyone had said that out of their respect for Grandmaster Zuo De, but Ai Ou had brought it up now to take revenge.

No one dared to meet Ai Ou’s gaze, wherever it went past.

Suddenly, Ai Ou looked proud like a cock that had won the battle!

When had he ever had the chance to be so domineering before so many Alchemists and yet no one dared to look straight at him? Alchemists had very strange temperaments, whether one was an Origin King Realm master or not, one couldn’t delay them in Alchemy or hinder their study of Alchemy.

Therefore, Ai Ou had to speak every word carefully when he was before these Alchemists.

Today, he finally tasted a sense of superiority.

He couldn’t help but break into laughter. He felt extremely proud. “Good! Great! Excellent! It seems that my Chamber of Commerce hasn’t raised you in vain. You all know how to solve this King’s worries. You are all very good.”

“President... is everything okay with Mrs. Gu? Isn’t she waiting for the Soul Source Restoration Pill...”

Just as someone mentioned Mrs. Gu, Ai Ou left in a hurry, like he was injected with adrenaline. He disappeared in the blink of an eye.

[Damn it! I actually forgot that my wife is still suffering and unconscious in my pride!] Ai Ou was feeling extremely guilty at this moment.

“That pain in the neck has finally left,” The crowd of Alchemists couldn’t help but heaved a sigh in relief. In the next moment, everyone surrounded Yang Kai, staring at him with bright eyes as if they would eat him. All of them were extremely excited.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel jittery. Before anyone could say anything, he raised his hand and said, “Everyone, I know what you want to do. Hmm, this King has some time now, let’s find a place to talk. I’m afraid this place won’t work as it’s best not to disturb everyone’s enlightenment.”

There were about two hundred or so Alchemists who still had their eyes closed, immersed in their enlightenment because of the Grand Alchemic Dao Tone. Obviously, they had reaped a lot of benefits.

The rest had failed to reap any benefit from the Grand Alchemic Dao Tone, so they had put all their attention on Yang Kai. Consulting him once would be more beneficial to them than refining pills for ten years straight. How could they miss this opportunity?

It was just that they didn’t know how to bring it up. But no one had expected Yang Kai to be so amiable. Yang Kai brought it up himself first.

Many Alchemists were wild with joy. They immediately knew that Yang Kai and Zuo De were two different people.

They had asked Zuo De for advice before, but Grandmaster Zuo De’s temper was really bad. He would either reprimand them or talk about other matters, which rendered their request mute.

But judging by Yang Kai’s demeanour, Yang Kai was obviously going to be talking about Alchemic Dao. This made everyone happy.

Someone immediately suggested the next moment, “Let’s head to the eighth floor, it should be empty now.”

“That’s right!”

“Alright,” Yang Kai nodded his agreement.

“Grandmaster Yang, please!” The crowd of Alchemists stretched out their hands and gestured in unison and in an extremely respectful manner. If anyone saw their current demeanour, no one would think that these people were the very same Alchemists with eyes high up their heads.

Yang Kai was also not overly modest. He was a master of both Martial Dao and Alchemic Dao. He might not be that old, but he held seniority over almost everyone. Whether it was Martial Dao or Alchemic Dao, he was far ahead of everyone.

Too much humility was just hypocrisy.

Therefore, he assumed the deserved authority and took the lead, heading to the eighth floor, whereas the crowd of Alchemists followed Yang Kai in an orderly manner.
