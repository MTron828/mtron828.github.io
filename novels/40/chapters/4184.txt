“Mo Yu, you can just speak calmly. Why do you pretend to be so infuriated? You’re a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so I don’t believe that you’ll lose your cool so easily.” Yang Kai looked mockingly at him, “You’re putting on a show and being verbose in order to stall for time and restore your aura, right? However, you’re still injured, so what does it matter if you’re given more time?”

The fury behind the Old Ancestor Mo Yu’s eyes dissipated as he looked solemnly at Yang Kai, “Since you’ve seen through this Old Master’s intentions, why are you playing along?”

Yang Kai calmly looked at him, “Because I have to stall for time as well.”

A horrified Old Ancestor Mo Yu immediately scanned the surroundings with his Divine Sense, only to hear Yang Kai saying, “Don’t worry. There’s no other ambush. All of our strength is right in front of you; however, it isn’t hard for us to deal with you.”

Both shocked and doubtful, the Old Ancestor Mo Yu wondered what Yang Kai was stalling for. In a despairing state, he sported a ferocious expression as he snarled, “Brat, this Old Master admits that he is no match for you, but it doesn’t mean I’m completely powerless to resist, so it isn’t easy for you to kill me. If this Old Master goes all out, I can easily destroy half of this Universe World. Since this is your territory, I’m sure you don’t want that to happen.”

“En, you’re probably right about that.” Yang Kai nodded gently, “The attack from a desperate Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master is not to be underestimated.”

Old Ancestor Mo Yu snorted, “This Old Master will admit defeat. Just tell me what you want. As long as I can give it to you, I’ll not haggle over it.”

Yang Kai grinned, “Old Ancestor, you’re mistaken. The reason I’ve lured you into my trap isn’t that I covet your wealth; instead, I want your life!” Upon finishing his words, he suddenly sported a hideous expression. He appeared like a starving ferocious beast that had his eyes on its prey.

Old Ancestor Mo Yu bellowed, “Boy, why are you insisting on killing me? What will you get out of it to have both parties harmed?”

“We’ll see if you’re capable of doing that!” Yang Kai scoffed.

Just then, a shriek was heard. It was one of the Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters from the Black Feather Sect who was killed by Guo Zi Yan and Embodiment.

This Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master was already caught in a trap, so his morale was low to begin with. On the other hand, Guo Zi Yan was a Third-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so he was stronger than his opponent to begin with. With Embodiment’s assistance, it was easy for him to kill this lone enemy.

After one fell, Guo Zi Yan and Embodiment directly pounced on the last Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master.

Presently, that person was held up by Yu Ru Meng and Bei Li Mo. Initially, he could still deal with them, but after Guo Zi Yan and Embodiment joined the battle, he felt immensely pressured, like a lone ship in a raging storm as the ship might capsize at any moment. Desperate, he exclaimed, “Old Ancestor, save me!”

At the same time, Yang Kai bellowed, “Begin!”

A sword light flashed as Lu Xue became one with her blade and turned into a ray of light before slashing at Old Ancestor Mo Yu’s head.

Mo Yu gritted his teeth and performed a hand seal. Then, he pushed out his palms and summoned two mysterious lights. The lights criss-crossed one another and became an artifact that looked like a pair of scissors before trying to cut through Lu Xue. At the same time, he bellowed, “Brat, since you don’t want me to live, I’ll not make things easy for you either!” Then, he madly surged the might of his Small Universe and clashed with Lu Xue.

Loud booms were heard as the stunning battle between two Fifth-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters took place. At that instant, the world seemed to have turned upside down, and the Principles were rapidly shattering apart.

Just like what Old Ancestor Mo Yu had said, even though he was no match for Lu Xue in his current state, she also couldn’t end his life in a short period of time. With two Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters fighting against one another in the Demon Realm, it would have a huge impact on this Universe World.

That was the reason rarely any Open Heaven Realm Masters would make a move in a Universe World as they might accidentally shatter the world. In the past, the Star Boundary was almost destroyed for this very reason.

Initially, Old Ancestor Mo Yu wanted to make Yang Kai cautious about acting lest he harm the innocent, but the latter didn’t seem to care one bit.

Huge Void Cracks started appearing. All of them looked like the mouths of ancient beasts, and the aura of nihility could be felt coming through the cracks.

Cracks were everywhere in the sky, and the ground was shaking violently. In just ten breaths’ time, the area within a radius of a hundred thousand kilometres transformed beyond recognition.

On the other hand, the Low-Rank Master from Black Feather Sect was suppressed by Guo Zi Yan and the others, and he was totally powerless to counterattack. In a despairing state, he begged for mercy. Naturally, Embodiment and the others ignored him and cast even more lethal moves.

Right then, Yang Kai came over with his Azure Dragon Spear in hand.

After he used Golden Crow Casts the Sun, a Sun leaped out from his back and cast a golden glow on the world. In the middle of the Sun, a Golden Crow was seen frolicking and cawing. Before the attack even reached the Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master, the menacing aura already terrified him to his core.

A weakness in his defence was exposed while he was flustered. Seizing the chance, Bei Li Mo landed a palm on his chest. As Ice Principles spread around, a layer of frost was formed on his chest, which made him unable to move.

The next moment, Azure Dragon Spear stuck his chest. A violent force was infused into his body through the spear, whereupon he sprayed out a mouthful of blood, and his expression became pale.

At this life-and-death moment, he gritted his teeth and madly burned his Blood Essence as his aura surged; however, before he could make a final struggle, Yu Ru Meng appeared before him as her eyes turned into an endless abyss, which sucked his Soul Avatar into it.

Embodiment came over and landed a palm on his head, which directly broke his skull.

The last Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master from Black Feather Sect was killed just like that.

Given their current strength, they shouldn’t have been able to kill these two Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters with such ease. In the past, when Great Demon God made a fuss in the Star Boundary, the Great Emperors had to relentlessly fight back with all their powers and pay a hefty price before they could end his life. At that time, the Great Demon God showcased a power that was not weaker than that of the two Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters.

However, things were different with Guo Zi Yan around. He was in the Third-Order Open Heaven Realm, which was at the peak of the Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm. As long as his opponent wasn’t a Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master, he was practically peerless.

After the battle was settled, Embodiment directly sat down with his legs crossed. Just like what he had done before, with the entire Demon Realm as a medium, he started activating the Heaven Devouring Battle Law.

This time, four Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters had followed Old Ancestor Mo Yu to the Demon Realm, and they were all killed. After their Small Universes collapsed, the Principles and World Force they had condensed wafted from their bodies.

With Embodiment making a move, the Heaven Devouring Battle Law madly absorbed the powers in the air and replenished the lost heritage of the Demon Realm.

The Void Cracks that had been formed due to the battle between the two Mid-Rank Masters were rapidly getting repaired, and even the broken Principles were stitched back together again.

Upon sensing the transformation in his surroundings, Old Ancestor Mo Yu exclaimed, “What is happening?”

An Open Heaven Realm Master could swallow the heritage of a Universe World to strengthen himself, and in the same way, if an Open Heaven Realm Master lost his life in a particular Universe World, the heritage of that place would be enhanced as well.

As a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, Mo Yu was fully aware of this; however, even if a Universe World could receive nourishment after an Open Heaven Realm Master passed away, it could only absorb a small portion of it. Most of it was wasted, and only 10 to 20% of it could be retained.

He had never expected that a Universe World could proactively absorb the World Force coming from dead Open Heaven Realm Masters. At this moment, this world seemed to have turned into a living creature, and it was as though it could gobble up all the World Force it was fed. This revelation made him shudder.

While he was in a dazed state, a sword light slashed across his chest and almost cut him into halves. He exclaimed and resisted with all his might. That was how he was spared the fate of getting killed on the spot. After the strike, his chest was covered in blood, and his flesh had rolled up. Through the wound, his heart was seen pounding. The situation he was in became increasingly perilous.

It was at this point that he understood why Yang Kai had to stall for time.

This eerie world was able to completely absorb the World Force from dead Open Heaven Realm Masters and repair its own damage at an incredible speed. Hence, his subordinates had basically become food for this world.

Yang Kai was stalling for time because he had to kill all the Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters as soon as possible. Only by doing so could he ensure that the world would not be destroyed by the battle between the two Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters.

Upon that realization, Mo Yu became crestfallen. Initially, he wanted to showcase his immense power and let Yang Kai know the consequences of forcing him to his end; however, seeing as this world was rapidly repairing itself, he knew that there was no hope for him.

Both Lu Xue and he were in the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm; however, while one was at the peak of her power, the other was severely injured. It was obvious which one of them was stronger. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

In just a stick of incense worth of time, Mo Yu’s aura plummeted. Faced with Lu Xue’s relentless assault, he could only parry but not fight back.

He had repeatedly attempted to leave the Demon Realm, but Guo Zi Yan and the others were not there just to watch a show. They already surrounded the battlefield, and as soon as Mo Yu showed signs of fleeing, he would be suppressed, which made him feel so frustrated that he almost spat blood.

From time to time, Guo Zi Yan and the others would cast their Divine Abilities to tire him out.

The battle lasted for three days. Presently, the aura of Old Ancestor Mo Yu had completely withered while Lu Xue was panting heavily. Even though she had the upper hand from the start, it wasn’t easy to kill a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

“This Old Master is willing to surrender! Little Friend, please spare my life! This Old Master will swear upon his Dao Heart that he will always obey your orders. If I go back on my word, I’ll die a horrible death!” Old Ancestor Mo Yu exclaimed with a livid expression.

However, Yang Kai remained indifferent to him.

The fact that Old Ancestor Mo Yu was willing to swear upon his Dao Heart suggested that he sincerely wanted to surrender, but Yang Kai didn’t really need him.

If Mo Yu hadn’t offended Rising Heavens Pavilion and Flying Flower Boat, Yang Kai might have taken him on as a subordinate.

He had the Loyalty List with nine pages in total, which meant that he could control nine people. Presently, only the names of Chen Tian Fei and Hei He were on it, so he could add another without much hesitation. Moreover, it was worth considering to take in a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

However, this guy was a mortal enemy of Rising Heavens Pavilion and Flying Flower Boat, so Yang Kai would only be inviting trouble to himself if he accepted him.

Void Land was in the early stages of building itself up, and the Nine Heavenly Layers hadn’t been completed yet. They were in the stage of rapid developments, so Yang Kai would be taking a huge loss if he were to protect a morally corrupt Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master and become enemies with two Second Class great forces.

However, since Mo Yu had said such a thing, it suggested that he was already on his last legs.

Understanding this, Yang Kai extended his hand into the void and grabbed Azure Dragon Spear. Pointing the spear forward, he coldly ordered, “Kill!”
