When Mao Zhe accidentally fell into the Shadowless Cave Heaven back then, Profound Yang Mountain was the first place he landed on. It had been 10,000 years since then. Profound Yang Mountain wasn’t expansive as there were only about ten or so peaks, but over the years, he had managed to grow it into the largest great force in the Shadowless Cave Heaven, and he had a lot of top cultivators who worked for him. Profound Yang Mountain was practically his foundation in the Shadowless Cave Heaven.

It didn’t matter that some of his subordinates were injured or killed as that would only mean a loss in power; however, the fact that Profound Yang Mountain was raised to the ground basically meant that his foundation was ruined, which meant that it would be hard for him to survive in the hostile environment in the Shadowless Cave Heaven.

The culprit of all his misery was the young man named Yang Kai; therefore, it was expected that he was incensed when he saw him again.

His eyes seemed able to spit fire as his murderous intent surged. He appeared eager to swallow Yang Kai alive as he watched the young man approach.

Geng Qing and Zhou Ya were also alarmed as they quickly surged their World Force and readied themselves for a fight.

They had experienced Yang Kai’s horrifying power before. Prior to that, they believed that Mao Zhe was at the peak of the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. Unless he was faced with an Open Heaven Realm Master in the Seventh-Order or above, he was basically peerless.

However, after the battle on Profound Yang Mountain, they realised there was always a mountain beyond the mountains.

It was inconceivable that there was such a terrifying Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master in the world. In that battle, they were knocked out before it even climaxed. When they awakened, they were no longer on Profound Yang Mountain. Furthermore, Mao Zhe broke it to them that Profound Yang Mountain was destroyed, so it wasn’t inhabitable anymore.

Then, Mao Zhe led them to Unrivalled Guild in an attempt to join that great force.

They had no other choice. In the Shadowless Cave Heaven, only the Headquarters of the three great forces were safe from the Astral Wind. In order to survive in this place, they had to join one of the great forces.

Profound Yang Mountain was destroyed, and they couldn’t possibly go to Twin Spirit Island; hence, they were only left with Unrivalled Guild.

Nevertheless, the Three Chiefs didn’t seem to have the intention of accepting them as they mocked them explicitly. Infuriated, the three of them turned around and left.

Since they had nowhere to go, they could only take the risk and look for the possible exit of the Shadowless Cave Heaven.

At the time, Mao Zhe had said it was better to risk it all for a chance to survive than to allow the Astral Wind to slowly grind them to death.

However, they couldn’t believe that Yang Kai had relentlessly pursued them all the way here to hunt them down. That was the reason they felt humiliated and incensed.

“What a coincidence! How are you three?” Yang Kai landed about 1,000 metres from the trio with a friendly smile on his face.

With a dark expression, Mao Zhe questioned, “Are you determined to kill us ruthlessly? In that case, let’s fight! Although this Monarch isn’t a match for you, it won’t be easy for you to kill me either.”

Yang Kai gazed at him with a tilted head, “Do you think I’m here to kill you all, Head Mountain Lord?”

Mao Zhe snorted, “Are you not?”

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, “No. Yun Fei Bai offended and humiliated my Proprietress, so he only had himself to blame that he was killed. The reason I destroyed Profound Yang Mountain was that I was angered. To me, the moment Profound Yang Mountain was ruined, the accounts between us were settled. Of course, if you want to seek revenge, I don’t mind spending some time dealing with you. Let’s see if you’re capable of doing that.”

Mao Zhe sported a grim expression but didn’t respond. Apparently, he didn’t believe him.

Zhou Ya asked, “Since you’re not hunting us down, what are you doing here, then? Don’t tell me you’re here to take in the view.”

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “I believe we’re here for the same reason.”

Geng Qing was startled for a moment before he asked, “Are you also looking for the exit to the Shadowless Cave Heaven?”

Yang Kai replied, “Island Master Hua told me the Head Mountain Lord had a speculation that the source of the Astral Wind was an exit to the outside world, so it might be possible to find it if one travels against the wind.” As he spoke, he took a glance at Mao Zhe.

Upon hearing that, Mao Zhe snorted, “Good. It was this Monarch who came up with this view; however, no one can prove whether it’s true.”

“We’ll find out by looking for the origin of the Astral Wind.” Yang Kai shrugged smilingly at them, “Do you want to work with me?”

Mao Zhe sported an odd expression as he asked, “You want to work with us?”

“Why not?” Yang Kai arched his brow, “In fact, there isn’t a blood feud between us, unless you want to avenge Yun Fei Bai’s death.”

“We’ll put aside the death of my Second Brother for now. You destroyed Profound Yang Mountain, which practically left us homeless in the Shadowless Cave Heaven. This feud is absolutely irreconcilable, so what right do you have to work with us?” Mao Zhe sneered.

Yang Kai shrugged, “Since you’ve said so, I won’t force you to agree to it; however, I hope that you won’t be begging for my help later.”

Upon finishing his words, he shot a meaningful glance at Mao Zhe.

The Head Mountain Lord scoffed, “Ridiculous. What would this Monarch have to beg you for?”

Yang Kai nodded, “I hope you can keep that tough attitude when the time comes. Don’t make me look down on you. See you soon!”

Then, he took a step forward as his figure vanished. When Mao Zhe and the others came to their senses, he was already far away in the distance.

There was a solemn expression on Geng Qing’s face as he remarked, “The Dao of Space is indeed extraordinary!” Just now, he was unable to figure out how Yang Kai disappeared. He would be unable to fend him off if Yang Kai decided to launch a sneak attack on him using a Space Secret Technique since the latter was also a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

Zhou Ya frowned, “I can’t believe he’s looking for an exit as well. Is he sick of living?”

The reason the three of them had fallen into such a state was that they had no other choice since there was nowhere in the Shadowless Cave Heaven that they could call home. Unless they found the exit and left this place, they would be killed by the Astral Wind sooner or later.

However, it was puzzling that Yang Kai was also trying to search for the exit when he already had a shelter.

His action suggested that he wasn’t lying as he was truly going against the wind.

A myriad of expressions came over Mao Zhe as he looked in the direction Yang Kai had disappeared. Although he wasn’t certain whether Yang Kai’s words were true, he reckoned that the latter really didn’t have the intention of fighting with them; otherwise, the young man wouldn’t have been so polite just now.

“He happens to be ahead of us, so we’ll just use him to find the path for us.” A glint flashed through Mao Zhe’s eyes as he waved his hand, “Follow him.”

When he initially heard Yun Fei Bai mention that Yang Kai was a Master of the Dao of Space, Mao Zhe had the intention of capturing Yang Kai and making use of his expertise to look for the exit. However, things eventually got out of hand. Yun Fei Bai was killed, Profound Yang Mountain was destroyed, and the three of them had to flee in embarrassment.

Now that Yang Kai was leading the way, they could simply follow him and make use of his skill to find the exit.

With this plan in mind, they kept a distance of 100 kilometres behind Yang Kai, paying close attention to him.

The Shadowless Cave Heaven was a Universe Cave Heaven left behind by an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master after his death. Supposedly, there should be some kind of inheritance of the Shadowless Divine Monarch in this place. Although it might not be as ample as the one in the Blood Monster Cave Heaven, it shouldn’t be so destitute.

However, the arrival of the Astral Wind once a month meant that even if there were any resources left behind, they would’ve lost their spirituality and turned into dust over the years. After all, the Astral Wind was so eerie that even Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were unable to resist it.

So far, Yang Kai hadn’t discovered anything useful. Wherever he went, all he could see was barren land as the entire world was infused with Death Qi.

From time to time, he would stop to observe his surroundings for a moment before continuing his journey.

Mao Zhe and the others followed him closely, but they had no idea what he was trying to do. They also tried to look into the places Yang Kai had stopped, but they couldn’t find anything of interest.

...

As time passed, Mao Zhe and the others began to grow anxious.

The Astral Wind would appear once a month and they had previously endured it once, which caused huge losses to their Small Universes. If they couldn’t find the exit before the Astral Wind struck again, they would suffer even greater losses.

A few days later, the three of them stood in the void as they silently observed the figure on a barren peak that was a few kilometres away.

An impatient Zhou Ya asked, “He’s been standing there for half a day. What is he trying to do?”

Although Yang Kai had stopped in some places from time to time, it was the first time he remained stationary for such a long time.

Mao Zhe stared intently at Yang Kai and observed every change in his expression, then he excitedly said, “Perhaps he has discovered something.”

Upon hearing that, Zhou Ya and Geng Qing were thrilled as they looked in Yang Kai’s direction with nervous but hopeful gazes.

It would be a good thing for them if Yang Kai could find the exit. In that case, they would be able to leave this accursed place.

There came a moment when Yang Kai let out a breath and opened his eyes, then he gazed at the three of them with a smile, “Head Mountain Lord, what if I say I’ve found the exit? Would you believe me?”

Mao Zhe became excited, “Are you serious?”

Yang Kai pointed at the space in front of him and declared, “It’s right here!”

...

Mao Zhe immediately released his Divine Sense to scan the area, but a long time later, he shook his head, “This Monarch can’t detect anything, so I don’t know if I should believe you or not.”

Yang Kai guffawed, “It’s simple to prove if I’m telling the truth.” After he finished speaking, Space Principles around him surged as he performed a set of hand seals. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

All of a sudden, Mao Zhe had a bad premonition as he exclaimed, “What are you doing?”

Yang Kai flashed a grin at him, “Take a guess.”

Mao Zhe yelled, “Stop him!”

As he spoke, he charged forward and surged his World Force before pushing out his palm at Yang Kai.

“Too late!” Yang Kai roared as he jabbed his hands into the Void and stomped his foot on the ground, “Open!”

A cracking sound was heard as though something had snapped. The three of them were dumbfounded as they saw a crack appearing in the Void above the peak.

The horrifying sound of a gale reverberated as the Astral Wind came rushing through the Void Crack that was forcefully opened.

“It’s the Astral Wind!” Mao Zhe’s expression changed drastically.
