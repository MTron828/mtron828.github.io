Outside the building, Fan Wu, Cang Gou, and Luan Feng, the three Divine Venerables, were all standing there with bitter expressions. Yang Kai had received their gifts, but he hadn’t responded at all, so they were all feeling quite anxious now. In fact, they hadn’t even managed to see Yang Kai in person when they came here, only the crazy woman next to him came out to speak to them.

After some time passed, Cang Gou finally spoke up, “Could it be that he thinks our gifts are too few, so he still wants more?”

Fan Wu glared at him, “We’ve already given him a tenth of our wealth. Is that a ‘small gift’?”

“I’m just afraid he won’t know when to be satisfied,” Cang Gou had a worried expression as he exclaimed with disgust, “You all know how greedy Humans can be.”

Luan Feng sighed, “What can we even do if he’s not satisfied? We’ll probably have to spend more in order to get rid of this calamity. Right, you two didn’t secretly hide any of Shi Huo’s treasures, did you?”

Cang Gou curled his lips, “Lady Feng, you’ve checked Shi Huo’s property already, so can’t you tell if we hid anything or not?”

Luan Feng nodded, “I was just asking.”

Fan Wu smiled bitterly, “He’s using the excuse of recovering from his injuries to stay in the Ancient Lands, and it’s hard for us to ask him to leave. Otherwise, if something really does happen, we won’t be able to handle it once that Heaven’s Order descendant emerges from the Blood Gate!”

When Luan Feng and Cang Gou heard him mention the Heaven’s Order descendant, they couldn’t help but go pale, making it obvious they were really afraid of her.

The three of them exchanged glances as they all kept sighing. They all felt that this was truly a headache.

At that moment, it seemed like the three of them all suddenly noticed something as they turned to look at the path ahead of them. They saw that Ji Yao had just come from the building’s direction and it was not long before she arrived before them and spoke, “Three Divine Venerables, please approach!”

Fan Wu and the others’ hearts all jumped, as they didn’t know what else Yang Kai wanted. They wondered if he was still dissatisfied with the contents of the four Space Rings and was trying to take even more of the lion’s share? If that really was the case, then his greed would be too disgusting.

Luan Feng forced a slight smile as she politely asked, “Little Sister, does Sir Yang have any other requests?”

Ji Yao gave her a light glance and answered, “Honoured Master wishes for me to tell all of you that his injuries have healed already and that he shall leave the Ancient Lands tomorrow.”

“What?” Cang Gou was overjoyed as he lost control of himself as he asked anxiously, “Is what you are saying true?”

Cang Gou was still a Divine Venerable, yet he was unable to help himself and lost control of his emotions when he heard that Yang Kai was about to leave the Ancient Lands, causing Fan Wu to secretly kick him right after he said this.

Cang Gou’s expression instantly changed and he immediately closed his mouth and stopped talking with an awkward expression.

However, Ji Yao didn’t even glance at him, simply turning around and leaving after having delivered her ‘Honoured Master’s message.

After Ji Yao disappeared from their vision, Luan Feng and the others looked at each other for a while and saw the great relief in their eyes. Fan Wu secretly made a gesture, so the three of them held the joy in their hearts as they swiftly walked away before all heaving a sigh in unison.

Cang Gou smiled, “He’s finally going to leave. It seems this Sir Yang isn’t too greedy.”

If Yang Kai really insisted on them giving more gifts to him, then they wouldn’t be able to do anything other than sacrifice even more of their wealth.

“Spend money to avoid calamity…” Fan Wu was also delighted. Yang Kai was likely the only one in the world who could make the Divine Venerables happy after being extorted so wantonly. If any other person tried to do this to them, the three Divine Venerables would likely have fought a huge battle against them.

“Since he’s going to leave tomorrow, this Queen shall personally see him off in order to be polite,” Luan Feng spoke with a big smile.

Fan Wu nodded, “That’s only proper. I shall be troubling you then, Lady Feng.”

Luan Feng waved her hand and smiled bitterly, “Good, he had to stay at this Queen’s place, while the Ancient Lands is still our territory. If anything happens to him here, none of us will likely be able to bear the consequences.”

The three of them then chatted for a while until Fan Wu and Cang Gou said their goodbyes and left.

When the two of them arrived, they had both been filled with anxiety and worries, but now they were completely relaxed and joyful as they went back, a tremendous contrast. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

…

Yang Kai used the time he had left to organize the contents of the four Space Rings, rather than continuing to create Spirit Pills.

Source Crystals, Monster Cores, and so on were easy to organize.

He simply had to sort them by type and grade, followed by tossing all of them into the Sealed World Bead and piling them up into mountains of different sizes. He would then simply take these items out whenever he needed them.

However, the hundred thousand or so Emperor Grade spirit medicines took Yang Kai a long time to organize. These spirit medicines were all precious and rare, so Yang Kai naturally needed to check them one at a time and do his best in order to preserve their medicinal efficacies.

After an entire busy night, Yang Kai had organized less than ten percent of the spirit medicines he received.

The next day’s morning, Yang Kai led Ji Yao and followed the maidservant Tian Long out of Phoenix Nest Palace. Once outside the palace, he saw Luan Feng waiting for him.

“Sir Yang!” Luan Feng hurriedly came over to greet Yang Kai when she saw him.

Yang Kai nodded lightly and had a slight smile, “I’ve been troubling Lady Feng for the past several days. En, this Young Master’s injuries are completely healed now, so it’s time for me to leave. As for the Stone Spirit Clan, I’ll have to request Lady Feng and the other two Divine Venerables to take good care of them.”

Luan Feng covered her mouth and smiled, “Sir Yang, please rest assured. As long as the three of us are still in the Ancient Lands, we definitely won’t let the Stone Spirit Clan suffer any grievances.”

Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction.

Luan Feng added, “The Ancient Lands have many Natural Arrays, and the journey to the exit is quite long, so allow me to send Sir off.”

Yang Kai didn’t reject her friendly intentions as he simply nodded and flew up into the air. Ji Yao hurriedly followed after him.

Luan Feng also flashed right next to Yang Kai and Ji Yao in an instant. Her Monster Qi enveloped the two as she took both of them and transformed into a beam of light that shot towards the exit of the Ancient Lands.

Yang Kai was already a First-Order Emperor, so his flying speed wasn’t slow at all, yet he discovered that his speed still couldn’t compare to Luan Feng’s.

Unless he used his Space Force for repeated short distance teleportations, he wouldn’t even be on the same level as her.

It took less than two days for the group of three to leave the Ancient Lands and arrive before the Ancient Lands Passageway.

Inside the passageway was a strange fog, falling thunder and Astral Wind, along with countless Yin Souls who were always looking for prey. Even a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master wouldn’t dare to recklessly enter the passageway.

However, Luan Feng didn’t even spare a glance at these obstacles as she directly took Yang Kai through the strange fog that covered the entire sky. It took only an hour for them to fly out of the passageway.

Right when Yang Kai’s vision was restored, he heard an astonished shout of “Brother Yang!” before he could even tell what was before him.

“Hmm?” Yang Kai was rather confused as he turned towards the voice. He saw that there was a large group of cultivators of varying strengths waiting there, numbering at least one hundred.

Judging from their behaviour, it seemed that they wanted to enter the Ancient Lands.

The person who spoke was a young man of about thirty years, his face slightly pale, seemingly injured.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but furrow his brow when he saw this person and asked, “Qi Hai?”

This man was Qi Hai from Qi Family Fort, who had met Yang Kai before in the Shattered Star Sea. He knew that Yang Kai had obtained the Phoenix True Fire, so he previously pleaded with Yang Kai to visit the Qi Family Fort to use the Phoenix True Fire to save his wife. Qi Hai’s wife had been afflicted with the Heavenly Frost Earth Rain, one of the Ten Extreme Poisons, while she was exploring the Ancient Wild Lands before. In this world, only the nirvana flames of the Phoenix True Fire were capable of expelling that poison from her body.

If Yang Kai had still been in possession of the Phoenix True Fire, he wouldn’t have minded helping Qi Hai out as it wasn’t much effort on his part.

However, Liu Yan had absorbed the Phoenix True Fire, and Jiu Feng had taken her to Spirit Beast Island.

Yang Kai wanted to help, but currently couldn’t.

Back when he entered the Ancient Lands, Yang Kai met Qi Family Fort’s disciple Qi He Feng, who was the person that Qi Hai arranged to wait for Yang Kai at the Ancient Lands Passageway.

Qi Hai had originally wanted to have Yang Kai owe him a favour by telling him that the Netherworld Sect was secretly scheming against him. Yet, it turned out that Yang Kai was incredibly fierce, to the point where he boldly and without hesitation or looking back walked straight into the Ancient Lands.

The end result was the annihilation of Netherworld Sect’s entire group.

As they exchanged glances, Qi Hai had a complex expression as some regret and hesitation seemed to flash through his eyes. Still, it wasn’t long before his hesitant expression suddenly became resolute as he cupped his fists and shouted towards a burly old man in front, “Senior Wu, he is the person that you’re looking for.”

Although this old man appeared to be elderly, he had a strong and robust body. He wore a short-sleeved vest that revealed his muscles which seemed as solid as metal. It was as if astonishing strength could burst forth from his brawny figure at any moment.

The strong old man’s expression darkened when he heard Qi Hai’s words, “He’s the little brat surnamed Yang?”

As he spoke, his eagle-like sharp gaze pierced straight at Yang Kai’s face. It was obvious that murderous intentions were brewing on his face.

Qi Hai quickly said, “Yes!”

“Good, very good!” The man surnamed Wu smiled viciously, “I didn’t expect that he would present himself to this King before this King had to go search for him. It seems I am quite lucky.”

Qi Hai gritted his teeth and stated, “Senior Wu, please keep your promise and loan the Phoenix True Fire to this Junior after everything is finished.”

The man surnamed Wu coldly snorted, “Since when did this King give you such a promise?”

“But Senior, didn’t you previously say…” Qi Hai’s expression greatly changed as he had an expression of disbelief as he looked at the man surnamed Wu.

The old man snorted again, “The Phoenix True Fire is far too divine for someone like you to borrow!”

“Senior, you’re actually going back on your word!?” Qi Hai’s expression instantly became extremely ugly. Unfortunately, he wasn’t as strong as the other party, so he couldn’t do anything even though his heart was filled with rage.

“Impudence!” This time, the man surnamed Wu didn’t say anything. Instead, another old man angrily shouted and slapped Qi Hai, causing him to spit blood and fly backwards from the impact as he fell on the ground with evident weakness in his aura.

That old man stepped forward and stated icily, “If you dare spout rubbish again, this Old Master will kill you first!”

“Young Fort Lord!”

Upon seeing Qi Hai fall on the ground, a group of people all rushed over and carefully helped him up. They couldn’t help but heave sighs of relief when they saw that Qi Hai’s life wasn’t in danger. They then glanced with vexed expressions at the old man who attacked Qi Hai, as they only dared to be angry but didn’t dare to say anything.

“Just what is happening…” Yang Kai had a strange expression as he watched all this.

He didn’t expect that right when he emerged from the Ancient Lands, that he would run into such a good show. A show that even involved him.

Qi Hai and the man surnamed Wu didn’t exchange many words, but Yang Kai was no idiot and naturally had some inkling of what was going on.
