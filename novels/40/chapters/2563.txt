Yang Kai really didn’t know what to do with this kind of person. If she was sane and could think properly, he would have sat down and talked with her; asked her about her origins and background, but she was completely insane. The only way he could talk to her was if she allowed it…

Yang Kai ground his teeth in anger, but he didn’t dare to beat the bush and scare the snake away.

[This woman comes and goes without a trace. Her camouflaging technique is really profound too. If I scare her away, it won’t be easy to find her…]

Having set his mind, Yang Kai squeezed a smile and tried his best to put on a harmless face before beckoning to her, “Come here!”

The crazy woman wasn’t swayed at all. She just cheekily smiled at him and stated, “Come and catch me!”

She repeated the same thing as if she only knew one sentence and never got tired of it.

Yang Kai tried to call her a few times, but it didn’t work, leaving him feeling utterly helpless.

“Sir, why don’t you tempt her with something and see whether she will come over?” Zhang Ruo Xi suddenly proposed.

Yang Kai felt that it was a good idea and rummaged through his Space Ring to quickly find a red fruit. He had a lot of Alchemy ingredients on him, most of which were obtained from killing others, and the rest were found in the ancient medicine garden last time.

This Blue Crab Apple was an Emperor Grade Alchemy ingredient. It looked extraordinary and was completely ripe, and the moment Yang Kai took it out, a tangy fragrance wafted in the air.

Yang Kai flipped his hand and spread his palm, revealing the Blue Crab Apple as he called out, “Come and take it, there’s no need to be afraid.”

He looked like a perverted old man trying to lure in and kidnap a little girl. He was extremely embarrassed inside, but he still had to pretend that it was alright.

The crazy woman was hanging upside down from a tree and was clearly interested in the fruit, her bright and wide eyes totally fixating on it. She also made no effort to disguise the desire in her eyes and began smacking her lips a few times while salivating.

Who knows whether it was because of her situation though, but she was still very vigilant. Despite the hungry look on her face, she didn’t rush over as Yang Kai had hoped.

*Chi chi chi…*

The leaves rustled for a while before the crazy woman suddenly disappeared.

Yang Kai was struck dumb and quickly spread his Divine Sense to lock onto her position. If he lost her this time, considering how vast the Ancient Lands was, trying to find her would make looking for a needle in a haystack feel trivial by comparison. He would really have no idea where to search for her.

*Chi chi chi…*

Another rustling noise came from nearby. Yang Kai turned his head to look and suddenly found that the crazy woman had reappeared on the branch of another tree, holding the trunk with one hand, quietly standing there.

[Fast! So fast!]

Yang Kai’s pupils shrunk when he saw how swiftly she had moved. Before he could grasp her position, she had reappeared like a ghost.

However, she was a lot closer than before.

Yang Kai secretly breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that the fruit in his hand had finally aroused her interest.

Yang Kai smiled and pushed the fruit forward before speaking in a soft voice, “Do you want it or not? If you don’t want it, I will eat it.”

While speaking, he pulled back the fruit and slowly brought it towards his mouth.

The crazy woman immediately became anxious at this sight and took a bent stance, as if she could not wait to pounce and grab the apple. But she appeared to have some scruples still and swayed back and forth on the tree, refusing to come down.

Yang Kai ground his teeth in anger, steeled himself, and bit into the Blue Crab Apple.

In just one bite, Yang Kai’s mouth was filled with rich fruit juice. It was an Emperor Grade spirit fruit after all, and the essence within it was quite amazing. On top of that, it tasted quite good and the attractive fruity fragrance only grew stronger once the flesh was exposed.

*Baji baji…*

Yang Kai ate it with relish, making some exaggerated noises, clearly causing the crazy woman’s heart to ache.

She looked at the Blue Crab Apple again before a firm look flashed in her eyes. She seemed to have made up her mind and with a flicker she shot out towards Yang Kai, leaving a streak of white light in her wake like a bolt of lightning.

Yang Kai was waiting for this very moment, so how could he let it pass? He threw the spirit fruit in his hand straight at her while, at the same time, stretching his hand out, grabbing towards a certain place in the air like a dragon.

The crazy woman suddenly appeared in front of Yang Kai with a flash. Her bright and shiny eyes were focused on the Blue Crab Apple that had been thrown by Yang Kai, as if nothing in this world could distract her from her prize.

If the spirit fruit continued to fly like this and there was no accident, it would definitely hit her right in the forehead.

Although Yang Kai didn’t mean to kill her with this attack, it was by no means a casual throw either. Rather, he had poured some of his Emperor Qi into it as he wanted to distract the crazy woman so that he could proceed with his next move.

But much to his surprise, the crazy woman leaned back at the critical moment, evading the spirit fruit by a hair’s breadth. Immediately after, she opened her mouth wide and directly took a bite at the spirit fruit. In a flash, her eyebrows rose in pleasure and an overjoyed look filled her face.

In the twinkling of an eye though, Yang Kai had flashed to her side and grabbed her arm.

The crazy woman was greatly shocked and quickly looked at Yang Kai as an inexplicable coldness flashed through her smiling eyes.

She twisted her body at an impossible angle and changed her posture like there were no bones in her body, standing face to face with Yang Kai.

Next, she raised her hand, while palming hard at Yang Kai. Before her attack even reached him, an extremely icy cold pressure that seemed capable of freezing the entire world spread out.

Yang Kai took a deep breath and couldn’t help but shiver as he shouted in a grim voice, “Ice Principles!”

If it was just speculation before that this crazy woman was somehow related to the Third Elder of Ice Heart Valley, who had gone missing many years ago, now it was all but certain she was that very person.

After all, every Ice Heart Valley disciple cultivated an Ice Attribute Secret Art.

Yang Kai’s face turned serious as he didn’t dare to be negligent. He also sent out a palm that radiated Space Principles.

*Hong…*

A deafening clap immediately followed as both of their bodies fiercely shook like two small boats caught in a violent storm. The two different Principle Strengths clashed with each other, but they were evenly matched.

This wasn’t a surprise though, as the crazy woman’s cultivation was a little higher than Yang Kai’s, and she had attacked in anger, whereas Yang Kai could only hastily respond. Forcing a draw here was already Yang Kai’s limit, and had it been any other First-Order Emperor, he or she might have suffered serious injuries.

Before the two clashing Principle Strengths could dissipate, the crazy woman suddenly twisted her arm held by Yang Kai, which had turned soft and boneless like a snake, and in the next moment, she slipped out of his grasp.

Yang Kai was greatly shocked by this, but it was already too late to grab her again. After being frightened by Yang Kai once, the crazy woman had quickly retreated, opening a huge gap with him.

*Hu chi chi…*

Only now did the two clashing Principle Strengths finally die down. Yang Kai stood with a wry smile hanging on his lips as he didn’t dare to make a rash move for the fear of scaring off the other party. Over twenty metres away, the crazy woman stood in place, her eyes filled with resentment. It appeared as if Yang Kai had abused her and then abandoned her, making Yang Kai feel apologetic.

It was really not a glorious thing to lie to a person whose brain was not currently working right, and to a woman no less.

She reached out to take the spirit fruit bitten by Yang Kai before taking a bite; she bit it without a moment of hesitation even though it had been eaten by Yang Kai. She was eating it with great relish, and there was a big smile on her face, but her nose and eyes were telling another story; she looked completely furious.

Yang Kai slightly sighed at the situation. This was Bing Yun’s Third Disciple, a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master, but now just a simple spirit fruit was enough to give her incomparable joy. If the others of Ice Heart Valley saw this, their hearts would surely ache with incomparable pain.

Yang Kai secretly winked at Zhang Ruo Xi. Seeing this, Zhang Ruo Xi knew what to do. She quickly took out a fruit from her Space Ring and spoke in a soft voice, “Want more? I have one here too. If you want it, I will give it to you.”

The crazy woman raised her brow and looked at her, but the next moment, her face paled as she repeatedly waved her head in refusal.

Having been tricked by Yang Kai, she was acting like she was bitten by a snake, shying away from ropes for ten years.

Not only that, she turned around and ran off in panic.

Yang Kai immediately became anxious and began regretting being too hasty just now.

In fact, he was confident before he made his move; after all, with his current strength, he believed that taking down an unstable Second-Order Emperor Realm Master would be as easy as flipping his hand. But this Third Disciple’s reflexes and judgement turned out far sharper than what he had estimated.

But after carefully thinking about it, this wasn’t that strange. For her to wander outside for so long, and even survive in the Ancient Wild Lands for this long, if she didn’t have such ability, she would have been reduced to a pile of bones already.

Clearly, she was even stronger than her Eldest Senior Sister and Second Senior Sister now. Although An Ruo Yun and Sun Yun Xiu were also Second-Order Emperors, would they be able to survive in this environment like this with their current strength?

Seeing the crazy woman turn around and escape, Yang Kai didn’t dare to hesitate anymore and immediately shouted, “Third Disciple, Senior Bing Yun is waiting for you to return, where are you trying to run to!?”

He didn’t know what Bing Yun called her as he hadn’t inquired about it before, so he could only bring up Bing Yun’s name, hoping it might affect her.

If this crazy woman was really Bing Yun’s Third Disciple, she would definitely not remain indifferent to this call even if she had lost her mind.

What pleasantly surprised Yang Kai was that after listening to his shout, the crazy woman suddenly stopped in her place, her tender body slightly trembling as she slowly turned around. She had even forgotten about the spirit fruit in her mouth.

When their gazes met, Yang Kai discovered that her eyes were filled with confusion. Obviously, Bing Yun’s name had triggered some of her memories, but she still couldn’t clearly remember and organize her thoughts because of her current chaotic state. Due to her muddled thoughts, a struggling and painful look appeared on her face.

[She is definitely the Third Disciple!] Yang Kai was sure in his heart now and followed up in a soft voice, “Third Disciple, Senior Bing Yun has already returned. Your Eldest Senior Sister, Second Senior Sister, and several Junior Sisters are waiting for you. Don’t run around, I will lead you back!”

While speaking, he stretched his hand toward her.

The struggling look on the Third Disciple’s face became even more severe and her beautiful pair of eyes trembled violently as two lines of tears slid down her cheeks while she muttered, “Honoured Master, Honoured Master…”

Yang Kai was overjoyed when he heard this. Obviously, some of this Third Disciple’s memories had returned.
