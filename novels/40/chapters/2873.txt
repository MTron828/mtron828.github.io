Although Fei Li had not said anything yet, at that moment, the Demon Kings all felt something odd and looked up into the sky together. Previously, no one was in the mood to pay attention to it even when they noticed Bao Qi’s unusual behaviour, because they were in the heat of the battle, competing for the Saint Artifact.

But now that they had stopped, the difference between Bao Qi’s calmness and the gaffe of the Demon Kings was of notable contrast.

“Bao Qi, you should give us an explanation!” Fei Li sounded angry and bitter, “Why did you incite us to fight one another? What do you stand to gain from this?”

Although the appearance of the Saint Artifact was somewhat amazing, Fei Li instinctively realized that all this was a trap, a scheme to provoke the Demon Kings here to fight one another.

He just could not figure out why Bao Qi would do this. What benefits could he gain from it?

The other Demon Kings frowned slightly and gradually returned to their senses. Even though they were still tempted to snatch the Saint Artifact, they forcibly suppressed their desires and turned to Bao Qi, who had been watching coldly from the side the whole time. They all looked like they were prepared to teach Bao Qi a lesson if he could not give them a reasonable explanation.

“Ha!” Bao Qi could not help sneering, revealing a look of mockery on his face, as if he had stripped off his mask and revealed his true colours. He looked down at the Demon Kings below, and sneered, “I thought all of you would fight until only one bloodied and bruised survivor remained. Too bad there’s someone smart among you.”

As soon as he declared this, the faces of the Demon Kings changed one after another.

These words were a confirmation from Bao Qi of their suspicions.

This really was a trap! They had no idea what the hell Bao Qi was planning to do, even using a Saint Artifact he somehow found as bait to cause internecine conflict among them.

The mere thought infuriated the Demon Kings.

Fei Li replied coldly, “Bao Qi, you court death!”

Bao Qi chuckled, “Are you sure you have the ability to do that?”

“You’ll know soon enough!” As Fei Li spoke, his bones suddenly ignited in green flames. It was unknown how he moved, but he instantly appeared in front of Bao Qi with just a step, and stretched out his hand to grab him.

Although Bao Qi was stronger than Sha Ya, he was still a Minor Realm inferior to Fei Li. According to the division Shamans, Sha Ya was considered a Low-Rank Shaman King, Bao Qi a Mid-Rank, and Fei Li a High-Rank Shaman King.

With such an absolute gap in strength, Fei Li believed that he couldn’t lose.

His movement was light and facile, as if he was catching a fly. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

But Bao Qi just smiled, remaining perfectly calm while facing the incoming ruthless blow from the peak-level Demon King, the ridicule in his eyes growing ever stronger.

Fei Li instinctively felt something was wrong, but he could not tell what it was. However, the arrow had already left the string, so he could not afford to hesitate and pushed even more strength into his strike, attempting to take Bao Qi’s life and show him the outcome of his terrible mistake.

The next moment, the ghost fire in Fei Li’s eyes flashed violently.

Because his hand involuntarily stopped just a palm’s length from Bao Qi, and he could not move further no matter how hard he tried.

Then, a figure appeared in front of him like a ghost. It was a young man covered in rich Demon Qi, but it was apparent this young man had not lost his mind as his eyes were shining brilliantly.

He looked indifferent, and the aura released from his whole body was nothing worthy of note, but Fei Li still felt dreadfully uneasy in his heart when he saw him. He had not felt this way for countless years. The last time Fei Li experienced such uneasiness was nearly a thousand years ago, when he was still just a weakling that could barely keep his own bones from falling apart.

At that time, he encountered a Bone-Crushing Beast, which was the nemesis of the Bone Demon Clan. Fei Li carefully hid in the tall grass and did not dare to make a move for fear that the Bone-Crushing Beast would find and swallow him as a meal.

Just reliving the memory from that experience a thousand years ago gave him an unpleasant feeling. Although he did not have flesh and blood, Fei Li could still feel the horrifying chill from the depths of his Soul from that time.

He had no idea how this strange young man appeared before his eyes. Rather, it was as if he had been standing there the whole time.

The expressions of the other Demon Kings also fluctuated wildly. More than a dozen pairs of eyes focused on Yang Kai, with the Demon Kings who had just been fighting all out with one another now banding together. Even the Shadow Demon Mo Ke Tuo, who snatched the Saint Artifact, was no exception, drawing closer to the other Demon Kings without anyone noticing.

“Sir!” Bao Qi bowed and saluted, displaying his submission to Yang Kai with his actions.

“Sir?” The ghost fire in Fei Li’s eyes jumped again, surprised by the way Bao Qi addressed this young man.

As a Demon King, they could only address the Demon Saints by such a title, but the young man in front of them obviously did not possess the slightest hint of the aura of a Demon Saint. Instead, he looked just like a demonised Barbarian, so how could he be addressed as Sir by Bao Qi?

The demonised Barbarians had the lowest status in the Demon Race. They were even inferior to Demon Beasts. Many times, after they had outlived their other uses, these demonised Barbarians would become feed for Demon Beasts.

“Who are you?” Fei Li questioned in a deep voice.

Yang Kai smiled faintly at him, which bewildered Fei Li, but he did not have time to have a second thought because a terrifying force abruptly approached his face in the next instant. Even as a peak level Demon King, Fei Li couldn’t muster any resistance or response when facing this invisible attack. Launched out by the impact, Fei Li’s bones cracked and almost shattered apart.

Fei Li let out a screech as he fell back next to the other Demon Kings.

The other Demon Kings were stunned and all of them looked at Fei Li in shock before turning to Yang Kai in bewilderment. None of them could believe their eyes.

“Something is not right with this guy!” Fei Li quickly alerted everyone.

It was indeed strange. The aura of this guy was obviously not strong, but he could actually send one of them flying so easily. If this young man had wanted Fei Li’s life just now, would he have been able to resist?

“Bao Qi, what is the meaning of this?” Sha Ya jumped out and shouted with a look of righteous indignation, “What are you doing?”

Indeed, Charm Demons had an unparalleled talent in acting. Her expression and tone were full of anger, and none of the Demon Kings suspected her. Furthermore, the question that she asked was the exact doubt the Demon Kings had.

Bao Qi smiled lightly, “Sha Ya, Sha Ya… you’re asking the wrong person. It’s not what I want to do, but what my Sir wants to do.”

Sha Ya sneered, “Your Sir? How dare a waste only as strong as a Demon Great General call himself Sir in front of us?”

Bao Qi’s face darkened, “With your limited intelligence, none of you are capable of imagining what my Sir’s capabilities are.”

These words were almost identical to the ones Sha Ya spoke to him a few months ago. At that moment, Bao Qi had a strange feeling, as if he had become Sha Ya, and the group of Demon Kings below had become him from that time.

It seemed that Yang Kai intended to give a demonstration of his power and authority here, so he lightly lifted his hand, causing Shadow Demon Mo Ke Tuo to let out a scream laced with panic and surprise as he involuntarily flew up. Mid-air, the black Qi which wrapped around ‘his’ body suddenly dispersed, a delicate figure taking its place.

This Shadow Demon, who was famous throughout the Demon Realm, a figure who struck terror into many hearts, and whose true face had never been seen by anyone else before, actually turned out to be a woman! Moreover, she was extremely petite, which was a marked contrast from the typical tall and powerful Demons.

The group of Demon Kings were all dumbstruck.

Mo Ke Tuo was ranked highly among all Demon Kings and there was not a single Demon King who would dare to fight with ‘her’ alone. All this time, Mo Ke Tuo covered herself in black Qi, so no one knew her true appearance except the Demon Saints.

Up until now!

Therefore, everyone was flabbergasted. They never thought that the true identity of this enigmatic Shadow Demon would be this. Apart from the mysterious black Qi, she looked just like an ordinary Demon. There was nothing special about her, and even her appearance was just ordinary.

Mo Ke Tuo was even more shocked than her peers.

It was not her intention to disperse her concealment technique, so this was obviously the result of something this young man did. What truly terrified her though was that she could not resist at all.

How was this possible? With her proficiency in concealment and assassination, she would not be this helpless even when facing the Demon Saints, but at this moment, she could not help having the impression that she no was longer in control of her own fate.

Before that, she was always the one who controlled the fate of others!

Mo Ke Tuo was dragged towards Yang Kai under the puzzled gaze of all the Demon Kings. She definitely did not want to just wait for death, so she went all out to resist, but no matter how she tried, she could not squeeze out even the slightest strength from her body.

Her face turned pale in an instant as she stared at the young man in front of her fearfully.

The young man smiled lightly at her, which horrified her, like she was facing a giant beast that could devour her whole.

“This is mine.” Yang Kai stretched out his hand and tapped her head.

As if she was struck by lightning, following a grunt, Mo Ke Tuo plummeted like a meteor and spewed a mouthful of blood. She was obviously seriously wounded. This scene horrified the other Demon Kings even more.

It was only a few breaths of time since the young man appeared, but his ability had been recognized by all the Demon Kings. He was like a God of this world, and had the power of life and death over everyone present.

The Saint Artifact that Mo Ke Tuo was holding onto earlier was now quietly hovering in mid-air. Yang Kai reached out his hand to grab it and swung it to his back. Then, the Demonic War Hammer immediately turned into a flash of brilliance and vanished.

No one knew where the young man sent the Saint Artifact to, and at this moment, no one cared. Everyone was wondering if they could compete with this young man even if they worked together. They knew that there was no chance of winning alone, for even Fei Li and Mo Ke Tuo collapsed at the first blow. Since even they were helpless, what could the others do?

Needless to say, the Demon Kings immediately reached a consensus as their eyes met.

“My name is Shaman Niu!” Yang Kai stood mid-air and looked down at the Demon Kings, his figure seeming much larger and more imposing than it should, “As you can see, Bao Qi is my subordinate!”

The Demon Kings kept silent as they were aware of this.

“What do you want?” Sha Ya asked half angrily, half anxiously.

Yang Kai smiled lightly, “I want all of you to be my subordinates like Bao Qi!”
