“However, those Sects are obviously not very powerful. The truly formidable Sects will never do such a thing.” Yang Kai came to this conclusion because he could see that those people were only in the First-Order Dao Source Realm. Cultivators would scramble to get into the truly powerful Sects, so those forces wouldn’t disparage themselves like that.

He Yun Xiang pondered on it and nodded, “Sir, I think you’re right.”

“Stop here,” Yang Kai tapped her shoulder.

Upon receiving his order, she stopped the Star Shuttle.

They were in a place that was surrounded by mountains. The area was beautiful with fragrant flowers dotted around, and birds could be heard chirping joyfully.

“You’ve found a good cemetery for yourself. It’s a nice place indeed.” Yan Luo’s voice could be heard from behind. When he uttered the first word, he was still in the distance, but when he finished speaking, he had already reached right in front of Yang Kai.

Then, the boat was put away as the four from Azure Sea Palace hovered in the air.

“It’s indeed a good place to be buried, but I’ve not chosen it for myself,” Yang Kai grinned.

Certainly, he knew that by turning down the other Sect leaders, they would attract those from Azure Sea Palace to chase after them once they left the scene. If those from Azure Sea Palace and the Yan Family decided not to race after them, they would have stood a chance to stay alive. After all, the Yan Family had helped him enter the Ancestral Domain, so it would be wonderful if their grudges could be resolved just like that. However, since they had chased after him, then he had no choice but to destroy them.

A true Master would never intentionally oppress the weak, he would only inadvertently destroy everything the weaker party had. Those who oppressed the weak all the time were not truly powerful, they were those who had lost the will to challenge greater heights and thus degenerated into cowards who could only handle those beneath them.

Certainly, Yan Luo understood the meaning behind his words, so he snorted, “How shameless! Now that my Old Ancestor is here, do you still think you can act however you please?”

Yan Luo had been forced to act obsequiously for a long time, so he felt truly gleeful that he would get his revenge soon. Gritting his teeth, he said, “Old Ancestor, please bring justice to our family and avenge the Second Elder’s death.”

Yan Ren Hao nodded slightly and stepped forward, upon which his First-Order Dao Source Realm aura surged and pressed down on Yang Kai.

Casually, Duan Mu Qi uttered, “I don’t care what you do to the man, but you have to keep the woman alive.”

Hearing that, Chen Chui Ling pouted in displeasure. With a smile, Duan Mu Qi explained, “I’m getting you a new Sister to share your burdens. Don’t you like it?”

Chen Chui Ling knew that she couldn’t dissuade him from doing this as he was always a lascivious man. Regardless, she just wanted to cling to him, so she said dispassionately, “I want to be the Elder Sister, then.”

“Sure. It’s up to you,” Duan Mu Qi replied with a smile.

Upon that, Chen Chui Ling put on a smile, but she still shot a disdainful glance at He Yun Xiang. By just thinking that there would be one more woman who would share her man from now on, she was displeased.

“Old Ancestor, you have to be careful. This man seems to have cultivated the Dao of Space.”

“Dao of Space?” Yan Ren Hao turned solemn, then he put on a haughty expression, “So what?”

When faced with absolute power, even Masters of the Dao of Space were useless. Dawdling no further, he growled, “Die!”

After that, he shot towards Yang Kai and reached him in the blink of an eye. Without using any artifact or Secret Technique, he clawed at the young man’s forehead as his Source Qi burst out from his fingers. The sound of something breaking through the air could be heard, as though his fingers had turned into a sharp weapon.

He wanted to end Yang Kai’s life with just one strike to avenge the humiliation that had been brought upon the Yan Family.

He Yun Xiang exclaimed as she witnessed the prowess of a Dao Source Realm cultivator for the first time. She couldn’t even clearly see his move. If she was in Yang Kai’s place, she wouldn’t have been able to avoid the attack. In an instant, her face turned pale and immediately tried to push her Star Shuttle to bring Yang Kai away.

When she moved, though, Yang Kai remained in the same spot.

*Dang…* ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The crisp sound of metal clashing against metal sounded.

The ferocity on Yan Ren Hao’s face froze at that moment before it quickly turned into shock as he stared at the young man in disbelief.

He had accurately hit right on target, but unlike his imagination earlier, the young man’s head didn’t explode, nor did blood splash out. It didn’t feel like he was clutching at a person’s head but rather had grabbed an extremely hard piece of metal, only managing to leave a small white mark on the man’s forehead.

[What is his head made of? Why is it so hard?]

Not daring to hesitate, Yan Ren Hao immediately released his powerful Source Qi through his palm.

Upon impact, Yang Kai rocked his head back and forth lightly like a toy rattle, a mocking gaze on his face as he stared at Yan Ren Hao, who was now less than an arm’s length away.

In an instant, Yan Ren Hao’s heart sank, and while he was in a dazed state, Yang Kai managed to grab his hand. An immense power could be felt on his wrist as the sound of cracking was heard. The next moment, the bones in his wrist shattered to pieces.

[No! I’m definitely no match for him! Is he really from Unending Star Field? How is it possible that there’s such a monster like him in our Star Field!?] Flabbergasted, Yan Ren Hao opened his mouth, upon which a beam of light shot out and transformed into a sabre. However, instead of slashing at Yang Kai, the sabre was actually aimed at Yan Ren Hao’s own wrist.

Instantly, Yan Ren Hao’s wrist was severed from his arm as blood spurted out of the wound, thereby allowing him to escape Yang Kai’s grasp. He had not hesitated at all when he cut off his own wrist because he knew that if he didn’t do that, he would be killed by the young man.

He had managed to reach his current cultivation realm by not only relying on his talent and luck, but also on his sharp intuition.

Seeing Yang Kai leap into the air after him, his speed was even more rapid than his own, Yan Ren Hao was terrified and shouted as he retreated, “Friend! Please stop! There must be a misunderstanding between us! It must be my family’s descendants who were disrespectful and offended your honourable self! I have to thank you for teaching them a lesson and instilling a sense of respect in them. Friend, I haven’t managed to ask for your name yet.”

He spoke in a rapid yet clear manner, as though he was worried that he might not have the chance to speak again if he was slow.

“Just die.”

Yan Kai had given them a chance already, but since they didn’t appreciate it, they could reflect on their mistakes in the next life.

Then, he pushed out his fist with brute force, without any aura fluctuation around him.

The target, Yan Ren Hao, turned ashen as he shouted, “Senior Brother Duan Mu, save me!”

After he finished speaking, he was struck by the fist. Without the chance to utter one more word, he exploded into a blood mist that even those kilometres away would clearly be able to see.

Yang Kai lifted his hand casually and combed his hair back as it had been slightly disturbed by Yan Ren Hao just now. Then, he turned to look at Yan Luo.

Yan Luo’s jaw was dropped as he was still reeling from the shock that his Old Ancestor had just been killed.

The process was too fast. From the time his Old Ancestor made a move until he exploded into a blood mist was less than a breath. Unlike what he had imagined, his Old Ancestor didn’t manage to kill Yang Kai to avenge their family’s humiliation. Instead, Yan Ren Hao had been killed.

Yan Luo couldn’t accept this fact. He was so astounded that it felt as if someone had battered his Soul. His heart contracted, causing him to feel suffocated.

Meeting the young man’s gaze, Yan Luo began trembling uncontrollably as he could feel that he had been engulfed in an aura of death. Subconsciously, he hid behind Duan Mu Qi to gain a sense of security.

“How dare you kill someone from Azure Sea Palace!?” Duan Mu Qi was no longer in the mood to flirt with Chen Chui Ling. In the blink of an eye, Yan Ren Hao had been killed, and he didn’t even clearly see what had happened. Enraged, he shouted, “You must die today!”

Just like what Yang Kai had expected, although Azure Sea Palace had some fame in the Ancestral Domain, it wasn’t among the top Sects. They didn’t have many cultivators in the Dao Source Realm, so the death of any one of them would mean a huge loss for the Sect.

Initially, Duan Mu Qi thought that this excursion would be a simple, easy one; he never anticipated that a Master from his Sect would be killed. Once he returned, he would definitely be punished.

If he wanted to be spared from punishment, he had to kill the murderer to make up for his mistake.

“Is there something wrong with his head?” Yang Kai turned to look at He Yun Xiang and asked seriously.

With a smile, she replied, “I guess he’s so sick that not even the Heavens can save him.”

She had just witnessed that someone in the realm above the Origin King Realm couldn’t withstand a single punch from Yang Kai, so the worry in her heart had vanished instantly. She couldn’t comprehend the depths of Yang Kai’s strength, but she was certain it was beyond even her wildest imagination.

“Good, I should send him on his way then.” Yang Kai flickered and appeared before Duan Mu Qi in the blink of an eye. Although his figure wasn’t particularly large or burly, the moment he appeared there, he seemed to block out everything else in the world from Duan Mu Qi’s vision.

It was then that Duan Mu Qi came to his senses. His instincts were screaming to him that he was in imminent danger.

Despite that, he wasn’t flustered as he extended his hand into the air and summoned a long sword into it. It was apparently a Dao Source Grade Low-Rank artifact. Layers of cold glints radiated from the sword and turned into a net as it engulfed Yang Kai.

In response, Yang Kai just waved his hand, upon which a sword appeared in his grip. However, the sword was quite different from the other long swords. The hilt was unusually large as the average person would need both hands to take hold of it. It was apparently a heavy sword, but Yang Kai managed to hold it with ease. He didn’t attempt to use any splendid-looking moves as he brandished his Myriads Sword.

The net of swords broke into pieces with a loud clang. As if struck by lightning, Duan Mu Qi sprayed out blood as the Dao Source Grade long sword in his hand snapped in two.

Yang Kai didn’t pause for an instant as he slashed his Myriads Sword at his opponent.

As though a Binding Technique had been cast on him, Duan Mu Qi was rooted to the spot as he looked dazedly at Yang Kai, only able to mutter, “You…”

With a loud slice, his body was split into two from his head to crotch in a symmetrical manner. Falling apart, blood and organs splattered everywhere.

After a short moment of silence, the sound of someone sobbing could be heard from the side. Already drenched in tears, Chen Chui Ling was completely pale as she trembled and stared at Yang Kai. Her pupils had bulged to the size of plates, as though the person standing before her was a stone-hearted devil instead of a Human.

Two First-Order Dao Source Realm Masters were not even able to take a single blow from this young man. They were killed easily as though they were just ants.

In her heart, she was utterly regretful. If she knew this would be the outcome, she wouldn’t have followed Duan Mu Qi to this place.

When Duan Mu Qi was killed and his blood had splashed everywhere, she was right beside him, so she was immediately dyed red. The mixture of blood and tears slid down her face and got into her mouth, which tasted salty and fishy, causing her to retch.

Not sparing her a glance, Yang Kai grinned at Yan Luo, who had been hiding behind Duan Mu Qi just now.

At this moment, Yan Luo was drenched in blood as well. Fear and horror seemed to be filling his eyes as he lamented in the deepest part of his heart.

[Why is he so powerful?] He had never expected that there existed a person as formidable as Yang Kai in this world. When Yang Kai made a move, he couldn’t even sense any aura fluctuation around him, but with just a fist and a sword, he had managed to kill Yan Ren Hao and Duan Mu Qi with ease.

Therefore, Yan Luo decided to run for his life. His desire to stay alive had conquered the fear in his heart.

With a faint smile, Yang Kai stared at his figure.

He Yun Xiang uttered, “Sir…”

She wasn’t willing to let Yan Luo off. If it weren’t because Yang Kai was so strong, they would’ve fallen into Yan Luo’s trap. Since the situation had been flipped, she could not forgive him.
