In the face of Yang Kai’s proposition, what more could Li Yuan Chun say?

Although in his mind he was quite clear that Yang Kai was essentially using them as a group of free bodyguards, in this situation, he had no choice but to agree, forcing himself to smile and nod, “Very well.”

These Endless Sea Islands people didn’t put the Eight Great Families or the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land in their eyes because their foundations weren’t Inland!

At the same time, a thousand kilometers away from War City.

Dust and smoke are billowed as countless human figures and innumerable Monster Beasts marched forward.

At the head of this tide was a giant Monster Beast with a wide body. A man stood atop this Monster Beast’s back, indifferently staring in the direction of War City.

This man appeared around forty or fifty years old but there didn’t seem to be anything extraordinary about him, his green robes were also quite common, items you might find in any ordinary shop; only his eyes were different, filled with a confident light as he gazed off into the distance, completely aloof from the world around him.

This man was none other than the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land’s Demon Lord, Yang Bai!

(PewPewLaserGun: This is a different Yang than then ‘Yang Family’ Yang... derm... think “Wolf” vs “Wolfe”... same sound different spelling)

(Silavin: PewPew brought up a good idea here. However, the official translation is Sun White or White Sun)

Those who only knew of his reputation thought that the Demon Lord was a three-headed, six-armed man with a fierce and sinister aura, but the few who had met him and lived knew that Yang Bai actually couldn’t be any more ordinary in terms of appearance.

If one were to randomly meet this man, they would never be able to believe that such a person had actually conquered the entire Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land.

More than twenty years ago, Yang Bai had once been a direct disciple of High Heaven Pavilion’s Sect Master, Ling Tai Xu, but due to his lust for power, he had cultivated an unknown Demonic Secret Art, fallen to the Devil’s Practices, and then brutally attacked his Senior Brother Yang Ying Feng and master Ling Tai Xu. As a result of that battle, Yang Ying Feng suffered heavy losses and was left with a debilitating chronic illness while Ling Tai Xu became disheartened and secluded himself, no longer interfering with the operation of the Sect.

A few years after that battle, Ling Tai Xu personally took action and captured Yang Bai, crippling his cultivation and imprisoning him in High Heaven Pavilion’s Coiling Dragon Stream.

However, this act inadvertently led Yang Bai to an astonishing opportunity below the Coiling Dragon Stream which he used to re-cultivate and then exceed his previous height. Eventually, he had escaped from his prison, attacked High Heaven Pavilion, killed one of the Elders, mortally wounded Ling Tai Xu, and then swaggered off without looking back.

He then travelled to the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land and proceeded to subdue it.

Finally, today, he had become the absolute ruler of the entire Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land.

Behind Yang Bai there were six figures following closely, occasionally glancing over at him, their eyes filled with awe and fear.

These people were the Six Great Evil Kings of the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land. The six consisted of five men and one woman.

Each of these six people had dramatically different appearances and characteristics.

One of them rode a great Monster Beast, one was engulfed in a green poisonous fog, one had a thick Yin Qi swirling around him, one had an enormous beast-like physique, while one was covered in faint sparks of lightning.

The only one who appeared relatively normal was the lone woman, the Beguiling Demon Queen, Shan Qing Luo.

However, Shan Qing Luo had a unique, otherworldly enchanting air to her. Anyone who laid eyes on her would instantly be unable to extricate themselves from her charms.

Even the other five Evil Kings didn’t dare stare too long into Shan Qing Luo’s eyes.

Since she had broken through to the Above Immortal Ascension Boundary, the Seduction Technique of this devilish woman had become even more powerful than before, so much so that the five other Evil Kings, who were stronger than her in terms of cultivation, had to take care not to be inadvertently ensnared by her charm.

These six people either flew or rode Monster Beasts as they followed behind Yang Bai.

Behind these six were the many masters from the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land, including several Above Immortal Ascension Boundary masters, as well as countless Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary cultivators.

Additionally, a phenomenal number of fierce Monster Beasts, each of which had at least reached the Fifth-Order were also in tow, while large quantities of Sixth-Order Monster Beast abounded.

There was even a Seventh-Order Monster Beast!

This Seventh-Order Monster Beast was the huge Spider Mother that Yang Kai had once encountered, the one capable of communicating with people using its Divine Sense.

A Seventh-Order Monster Beast was equivalent to an Above Immortal Ascension Boundary cultivator. Today, this Spider Mother was together with the Thunderbolt Beast King. Although the Beast King hadn’t subdued it, the two of them had reached an agreement with each other, so for this time’s campaign against the Central Capital, the Spider Mother had naturally followed along.

Because of the ruckus Yang Kai and Shan Qing Luo had raised in the Spider Mother’s lair, the Spider Mother was quite hostile to Shan Qing Luo at the moment, but in the face of the Demon Lord’s great strength, she didn’t dare to act recklessly.

If Demon Lord Yang Bai was not here, the Spider Mother would definitely attack Shan Qing Luo.

“Master, War City is only eight hundred kilometers away.” The Profound Yin Ghost King suddenly said, “Subordinate wishes to move ahead and scout out the situation.”

Yang Bai’s expression didn’t change as he continued to move ahead at his own pace, not even bothering to respond.

“Ghost King, after not killing anyone for half a day, can you no longer suppress your itching?” The Annihilating Poison King snickered as he squinted at the Ghost King.

The Profound Yin Ghost King grinned and cackled, “Poison King understands me well. I heard that a lot of masters are now gathered in War City. The previous time, these people all came to attack our Holy Land, so I believe it would be improper to not return the favour. This old master just wants to deliver them a special gift as quickly as possible.”

The Poison King also grinned, “When it comes to mass-murder, this old man also has many means. Master, please permit me to head out first.”

The Ghost King also didn’t back down, “While I admit your poison is good, this old man’s little spirits are plentiful, and when it comes to killing, they aren’t any worse than your means.”

As he spoke, a series of eerie shrieks and howls suddenly rang out and from the body of the Ghost King, a great number of distorted transparent faces emerged. These phantom faces were filled with looks of pain and struggling, they seemed to be the Souls of deceased cultivators that had been imprisoned inside the Ghost King’s body, subject to his whims.

“If you want to go, just go.” Yang Bai said a faintly, not making any attempt to prevent them.

“Many thanks!” The Ghost King and Poison King heard this and laughed with joy, quickly using their movement skills to rapidly fly towards the horizon.

“I’ll go too.” The Lightning Flash Shadow King said, his body flickering for an instant before also disappearing into the distance.

“That quick bastard is going too?” A booming voice called out. A giant with arms as thick as a fully grown man’s torso stepped forward, his eyes radiating a bloodthirsty light as he shouted, “If all of you run over now, when I, your father arrive, who will I get to kill?!”

Saying so, the Tyrannical Force King leapt forward and hurriedly pursued his fellow Evil Kings, the earth trembling every time his feet hit the ground, like a living, breathing catastrophe, greatly shocking everyone who saw him.

“Heh heh... I’ll also go join the fun.” The Thunderbolt Beast King drove his mount forward, a large group of Monster Beasts quickly separating from the army and following behind him.

In the blink of an eye, five Great Evil Kings had set out, leaving only Shan Qing Luo to follow Yang Bai.

“Qing Luo, are you not going as well?” Yang Bai glanced back at Shan Qing Luo casually.

“There’s no need. The five of them are more than enough.” Shan Qing Luo slowly shook her head.

“En, you not going is also good, those five’s desire for slaughter is too heavy. They won’t be able to advance far along the Martial Dao like that.”

Shan Qing Luo couldn’t help staring at Yang Bai strangely; she hadn’t expected him to evaluate those five as such.

“On another note, that maidservant you always have with you, Bi Luo... I haven’t seen her for a few days.” Yang Bai said in a voice like he had inadvertently remembered something trifling.

Shan Qing Luo’s tender body trembled slightly but she quickly regained her composure, steadied her breathing and calmly said, “I sent her to handle some matters.”

“En.” Yang Bai nodded nonchalantly.

Shan Qing Luo was incredibly nervous at this moment; afraid Yang Bai would continue to ask questions, but to her surprise, he no longer said anything, as if it was really just something he had casually noticed.

Shan Qing Luo couldn’t help letting out a sigh of relief.

Staring off in the direction of the far away War City, the Beguiling Demon Queen silently prayed in her heart, praying that the little bastard left quickly. This massive Holy Land army was not something a trivial War City could resist.

Shan Qing Luo faintly suspected that even the Central Capital wouldn’t be capable of stopping them.

The rate at which Yang Bai’s strength increased was simply too great. When he first came to the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land and conquered the Six Great Evil Kings, Shan Qing Luo could still vaguely see through his bottom line, but now, even though she had broken through to the Above Immortal Ascension Boundary, she could no longer understand what height Yang Bai had reached.

The strength of this person was too frightening; no one in the Central Capital could stop him!

Closing her eyes and carefully sensing, Shan Qing Luo discover that Yang Kai was still inside War City and couldn’t help feeling anxious.

Eight hundred kilometers was too far for even an Above Immortal Ascension Boundary to sense.

However, soon after they had met, Shan Qing Luo had marked Yang Kai with her Soul Seeking Seal and so long as it existed, she would be able to sense his location even if he ran to the ends of the earth.

Yang Kai’s image had been firmly imprinted in Shan Qing Luo’s heart, so she had planted the Soul Seeking Seal on him as a precaution against him escaping from her, but she had not anticipated that it would come in handy in such a way.

[What is that little bastard doing? Why hasn’t he tried to escape yet? Bi Luo should have arrived some time ago to warn him.]

War City, Yang Kai’s house.

Everyone was ready to set out.

All of them had also been informed about how serious the situation was, so when Yang Kai told them they were leaving right away, no one raised any objections.

Just as they were preparing to set out, Qiu Yi Meng and Huo Xing Chen came back. The two of them had followed Yang Kai’s instructions and went to the Seal Temple to inform the seven Grand Elders about the coming attack.

“How was it?” Yang Kai asked.

Qiu Yi Meng smiled bitterly and shook her head, “They didn’t believe us.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help snorting, “Pig headed even in the face of impending death. Utter foolishness! Never mind them, we’ve done all we can; what are you planning to do? Are you going to head back to the Central Capital or...”

“We’re coming with you!” Qiu Yi Meng said decisively.

“Good, let’s go.” Yang Kai waved his hand and said nothing more. Right now, every moment was precious; there was no time to argue even though Yang Kai thought it would be better for Qiu Yi Meng and Huo Xing Chen to return to the Central Capital instead of wandering around destitute with him.

With Yang Kai leading them, a large group of people set out.

Some time ago, a group of people had arrived outside Yang Kai’s mansion to threaten and intimidate his allies.

And until now, these people were still shouting their propaganda.

However, when they saw Yang Kai leading such a massive number of cultivators out of his complex, the people tasked with standing here and issuing threats were quite surprised. They mistakenly thought that Yang Kai was making a big move and quickly sent out warnings signals.

In the next moment, a large number of masters appeared from the surroundings and blocked Yang Kai’s path forward. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After last night’s battle, although the seven family coalitions had suffered losses, their foundation had not yet been shaken. Assembling now, this group of people still made for an intimidating sight.

“Little Lord, what are trying to do?” Kang Zhan took the initiative to step out from the crowd and ask.

Yang Kai stared at him, wrinkled his brow and hesitated for a moment before saying, “Don’t say that I didn’t warn you. The Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land, under the leadership of the Demon Lord, is coming here. If you don’t want to die, then quickly leave War City and return to the Central Capital.”

Kang Zhan stared back Yang Kai, seemingly not understanding the words he just spoke.

After a short silence, he laughed despite trying not to and shook my head wryly, “Little Lord, you saying such things... What exactly are you implying?”
