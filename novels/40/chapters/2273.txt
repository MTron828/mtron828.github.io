“Stop speaking nonsense with him! Hurry up and capture him! This Young Master wants him to taste the greatest tortures of the world! I want to rip his corpse into ten thousand pieces to relieve my hatred!” Ning Yuan Shu shouted with a nasty expression.

Gao Shan and Liu Shui had a solemn expression upon hearing this and they began to push their Source Qi.

“Hold on, two old sirs, Junior will be right there!” Yang Kai smiled joyfully and flew towards them quickly while waving happily to Gao Shan and Liu Shui.

Gao Shan and Liu Shui were stunned on the spot, as was Ning Yuan Shu, all of them wondering what Yang Kai was up to.

Under normal circumstances, shouldn’t Yang Kai be running away? But he actually took the initiative to show up at their doorstep happily, as if he finally saw his loved ones after many difficulties, which was very puzzling.

“Protectors, be careful, he might be trying to swindle us!” Ning Yuan Shu reminded them in a low voice.

Gao Shan and Liu Shui nodded in reply, “Don’t worry, Young Palace Master. This little brat is not as strong as Luo Yuan, he won’t be able to pull any tricks.”

“I hope so!”

After a short while, Yang Kai appeared directly in front of the trio and grinned at them.

Ning Yuan Shu seemed to be afraid of being slapped by Yang Kai, so his pupils shrank and he unconsciously took a few steps back, putting some distance between him and Yang Kai.

“Junior greets two Seniors.” Yang Kai smiled and cupped his fists, gesturing to Gao Shan and Liu Shui before immediately looking over at Ning Yuan Shu again, “Young Palace Master, there was a small little misunderstanding between us before, but why don’t we let bygones be bygones? We can still be good friends now!”

“Good friends?” Ning Yuan Shu glared at Yang Kai nastily, thrusting both of his extremely swollen cheeks in front of Yang Kai, “Look at me! Do you think this Young Master can be good friends with you?”

Yang Kai leaned back slightly, turning his face aside with a disgusted look, “Young Palace Master doesn’t need to come so close to say something... this Yang is timid, please don’t frighten me!”

Ning Yuan Shu was furious and roared, “You did this to me!”

“Alright, alright,” Yang Kai interrupted his clamour with a wave then looked at Gao Shan and Liu Shui with a smile. “Two Seniors, this Junior will now surrender to you without a fight!”

“Uh...” Gao Shan groaned and nodded, “At least you know some manners.”

Liu Shui continued, “A wise man will submit to the circumstances. Boy, your future should be bright!”

“Hehehe...” Yang Kai grinned, “Then, two Seniors are now responsible for protecting this Junior’s safety since I am one of your captives, right?”

“Protect your safety?” Gao Shan frowned.

“What do you mean?” Liu Shui also looked blank.

But soon they knew what he meant.

In the void, a figure soared over. The Artifact Spirit caught up with Yang Kai and stopped at a distance of a few dozen meters away, holding a Demonic War Hammer in its hands, viciously staring at Yang Kai.

“This... This aura!” Gao Shan was taken aback as he stared at the Artifact Spirit pensively.

Liu Shui’s expression also turned awe-inspiring as he shouted in a low voice. “Demon Qi!”

Yang Kai nodded, “Two Seniors are truly sharp! Yes, the aura around it is indeed Demon Qi, and the purest Ancient Demon Qi at that!”

“How can that be?” Gao Shan and Liu Shui looked at Yang Kai with their eyes screaming ‘are you kidding me’.

Yang Kai replied sternly, “Junior is not in the mood to joke with the two Seniors.”

Gao Shan asked, “No wonder it felt a little different from the usual Demon Qi... But how can there be Ancient Demon Qi here?”

Liu Shui was also puzzled.

“Can’t two Senior’s tell this is not a living creature? It is an Artifact Spirit assuming human form! Look at the hammer in its hand, that’s an Ancient Emperor Artifact!”

“What?” The two old men trembled violently as their eyes fixed on the Demonic War Hammer in horror. Gradually though, their horrified expressions were replaced by a look of fanatical greed.

Yang Kai took advantage of the opportunity, “Two Seniors have astounding cultivation and extraordinary strength, but have been trapped at the peak of the Dao Source Realm for countless years no doubt. The Heavens must be jealous and have no eyes for allowing this. If two Seniors can obtain this Emperor Artifact though and use it to comprehend some mysteries of the Emperor Realm, it may not be impossible to break through once more and become famous Emperors, overlords of the Star Boundary in the future!”

“You certainly have a way with words...” Gao Shan turned to Yang Kai coldly, “This old master is really moved!”

Yang Kai smiled, “Only those who are predestined can possess treasures, there’s no way any of those trash down there would be able to capture this Artifact Spirit. Only two Seniors have the strength to subdue it! As long as its consciousness can be erased, this Emperor Artifact will belong to you. Come now, please act swiftly, this Junior has the utmost confidence in you!”

After speaking, he actually retreated several dozen metres away, closed his fists and punched the air, cheering for Gao Shan and Liu Shui.

Gao Shan and Liu Shui both gulped. Although they both knew that this Artifact Spirit was definitely not to be trifled with, how could they not be moved by the treasure right in front of them?

Glancing at each other, the two shouted in unison, “Let’s go!”

When the words fell, Gao Shan’s hand flashed and his Guqin artifact appeared. He sat down cross-legged in the air and placed the Guqin horizontally across his lap before he began plucking it with his fingers.

Liu Shui also took out his flute at once, placing it against his lips, and blew into it lightly.

The two completely different tunes resonated in an instant, perfectly matching each other and forming an impact visible to the naked eye, enveloping the Artifact Spirit.

Yang Kai was close by and was not targetted, but after hearing the sounds, he suddenly felt that his consciousness was blurring slightly. This sound seemed like a living thing, burrowing into his ears, using a peculiar power to affect his mind.

He was secretly surprised and hurriedly circulated his Secret Art to resist this sound attack.

The impact on the Artifact Spirit was even more significant as it was forced to bear the brunt of this attack. Although it was only assuming human form, it did not have much sentience. It was actually the perfect tactic to restrain this Artifact Spirit with a sound attack that targeted its Soul.

As soon as the music played, the Demonic War Hammer was greatly affected. The red glow of its eyes flickered and its thick Demon Qi constantly trembled. However, it still managed to hold onto its War Hammer.

Seeing this scene, Gao Shan and Liu Shui were ecstatic and pushed their attack more and more vigorously, eager to take down the Artifact Spirit.

Ning Yuan Shu watched excitedly, praying that Gao Shan and Liu Shui would succeed as soon as possible.

If the two Protectors succeeded, he would be able to bring this War Hammer back to Flying Saint Palace. An Ancient Emperor Artifact would definitely contain many great secrets, and if it was refined by his Lord Father, it would definitely be able to improve his strength greatly, which would increase the status of Flying Saint Palace and indirectly raise Ning Yuan Shu’s status.

How could he not be excited?

On the other side, Yang Kai sat down cross-legged, taking advantage of this time to restore himself.

At this moment Gao Shan and Liu Shui were holding the Artifact Spirit in check, so Yang Kai naturally had to seize this good opportunity.

Although this Artifact Spirit was ferocious, it was not undefeatable. Yang Kai had the will, but not the power to fight against the Artifact Spirit due to him over-exerting himself when collecting the Source Crystal lode earlier. As long as he was given a little time to recover, he would be able to give this Artifact Spirit a good beating.

Above the wilderness, the sound of the Guqin and flute pierced through the air in fluctuating reverberations, playing an enchanting melody. The sound waves gathered constantly, following the ups and downs of the rhythm, hitting the Artifact Spirit directly, causing its glow to flash wildly.

The cultivators who escaped from the underground were attracted by the movement here and gradually approached, watching from a distance.

Gao Shan’s and Liu Shui’s faces sank, for fear that they would end up gifting this treasure to others, especially when they saw the little brat Luo Yuan among the crowd...

They grew quite anxious.

To put it nicely, they ended in a tie in the previous battle with Luo Yuan; to put it bluntly, they were completely defeated by him.

After all, the two old men teamed up to fight while Luo Yuan was alone. It was an obvious victory when a rising star could suppress the two experienced old masters and cause them to escape in embarrassment.

With scruples in their hearts, the two old men made eye contact and as if they knew what each other was thinking, the next moment the beautiful melody changed sharply into hostility. The rhythm became intense and the sound that resonated changed from melodic to threatening, like the charge of an army of horses and soldiers rushing towards the Artifact Spirit.

Sound waves raged as the world lost colour.

“Hou!” At that moment, the Artifact Spirit, which was suppressed by sound waves, suddenly roared. The flickering red eyes suddenly stabilized and an unimaginable aura burst forth from it.

The War Hammer, which it had been holding up high, suddenly descended.

The wind and clouds changed suddenly as a massive wave of energy surged forth, swirling around the War Hammer like a great vortex.

*Hong... *

When the War Hammer hit the void, space shattered like a mirror and a halo of light spread out like a sharp blade, cutting through the sound waves that were approaching it.

The sound waves disappeared one after another like fading dandelions. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Followed by the sound of Gao Shan’s Guqin strings snapping, and the creaking sound of Liu Shui’s flute cracking.

“Not good!” The two old men’s expressions changed wildly as they quickly pushed their Source Qi to protect themselves.

Under the impact, the strength of the two old men was no better than a small canoe thrown into the stormy sea, overturned at once.

*Pu Pu... *

The two of them spat blood in unison, and their auras instantly dimmed.

“Protectors!” Ning Yuan Shu yelled in horror, his pupils shrinking.

“Wastes!” Yang Kai cursed in anger.

He was expecting Gao Shan and Liu Shui to buy him a little bit of time so that he could have a chance to recover, but he did not expect these two old fools to go all out suddenly, and as a result wound up being beaten by the Artifact Spirit in just thirty breaths.

Not only that, but both of their artifacts were damaged. The two old men had suffered huge losses in this battle and it would probably take them ten or twenty years to fully recover.

The actions of the two Protectors obviously enraged the Artifact Spirit, so after breaking free from the shackles of the sound waves, it raised its War Hammer again, causing the runes on its surface to flash even more brilliantly than before while a black hole appeared before its face, one that seemed capable of swallowing the world itself.

Everyone was filled with dread as they felt something horrendous was about to happen.
