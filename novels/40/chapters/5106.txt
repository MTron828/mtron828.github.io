Life hadn’t been peaceful in Mu Guang’s Royal Domain recently. First of all, the Royal Lord’s plan that was hundreds of years in the making was derailed by a Human just before its imminent success, flushing all her efforts down the drain. Then, the Old Ancestor of Yin-Yang Pass suddenly appeared in her territory and started a huge fight against her and several Territory Lords. Space shattered and many Black Ink Clan Fiefs were devastated while countless Black Ink Clansmen were killed from the fallout of their battle.

The Human Army from Yin-Yang Pass had also gone all out. The Territory Lords in the Royal Domain had no choice but to lead their own armies to deal with the Humans.

The Black Ink Clansmen who stayed behind had no idea what was going on at the frontline. Usually, they just had to wait patiently; after all, even though the Humans were powerful, they could never break through the Black Ink Clan’s blockade and storm the Royal Domain.

However, there was now a lone Human who was raising all kinds of havoc in the Royal Domain when most of the powerful Black Ink Clansmen were not around. He was the very Human who derailed the Royal Lord’s plan.

This Human wasn’t particularly powerful. According to the classification of the Humans, he was just a Seventh-Order Master, equivalent to a Feudal Lord.

Nevertheless, it was this Seventh-Order Human who threw Mu Guang’s Royal Domain into absolute chaos.

In just half a month, he managed to destroy two Territory Lord Black Ink Nests and killed several tens of thousands of Black Ink Clansmen. Although Hei Yuan was personally hunting him down, he hadn’t achieved his goal so far.

From what they had gathered, this Human could transform into a several tens of thousands of metres long Grand Dragon and wield a gigantic spear in his claws. Once he got close, he could destroy a Territory Lord Black Ink Nest with one strike and shatter the universe fragment it sat on.

The reason he was able to evade Hei Yuan’s pursuit for so long was that he was a Master in the Dao of Space.

With the help of Space Secret Techniques, this Human could move with shocking speed. Even if Hei Yuan was stronger than he was, he couldn’t capture the Human intruder without being able to restrict his movements first.

After destroying two Territory Lord Black Ink Nests, the Human went missing; however, the consciousnesses staying in the Territory Lord Black Ink Nests believed that he was recuperating somewhere. When he fully recovered, he would make a move on another Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest.

This made the consciousnesses staying in the Territory Lord Black Ink Nests feel anxious as they were worried that one of them would be Yang Kai’s next target.

Black Ink Clansmen were seen thoroughly searching for Yang Kai across the void, leaving no stone unturned.

Nevertheless, they couldn’t find the Human after several days, as though he had vanished into thin air. This made many Black Ink Clansmen suspect that Yang Kai might have left Mu Guang’s Royal Domain.

One day, a team of 2o or so were examining a cluster of thick Black Ink Clouds. From what they had gathered, this Human liked hiding in places like this; therefore, the Black Ink Clouds of different sizes that scattered across the void would be thoroughly inspected. After all, no one knew if he was hiding in a certain Black Ink Cloud, just waiting to catch the nearby Black Ink Clansmen off guard.

After they inspected all of the Black Ink Clouds here though, they still couldn’t find the Human.

Just when the team of Black Ink Clansmen were preparing to leave, the leading High-Rank Clansman detected something and turned to look in a particular direction.

What came into his sight astounded him, for a series of ripples had suddenly appeared in the void. As the ripples expanded, a portal glowing with a faint light abruptly formed.

This High-Rank Black Ink Clansman was a quick-witted person, instantly realised something, and hurriedly ordered, “Hide!”

After he finished speaking, he led his team to charge into the nearest Black Ink Cloud. They concealed themselves and withdrew their auras as best they could as quickly as possible.

As they lifted their gazes, they saw that a portal had fully taken shape. While the ripples continued to expand, a figure appeared all of a sudden.

He was the Human that the Black Ink Clan had been looking for!

The High-Rank Clansman narrowed his eyes and soon realised something. It was no wonder that so many Black Ink Clansmen were unable to find a trace of this Human even after several days of searching, it turned out he had been hiding inside a Sealed World! The portal that suddenly opened up was obviously a portal that led to that Sealed World. Despite the distance between them, the High-Rank Clansman could clearly feel the aura coming from the portal. It was the aura of the World Force that the Black Ink Clan loved the most.

[So, that’s how it is!] Upon figuring out everything, the High-Rank Black Ink Clansman couldn’t help but think that Yang Kai was blessed with luck to have found a Sealed World and hidden inside it.

It seemed that the news they had received was true. Yang Kai had been badly injured when destroying the previous Territory Lord Black Ink Nest and was hiding and recuperating recently.

Although there were over 20 members in the group he led, this High-Rank Black Ink Clansman didn’t dare to make a rash move upon sighting Yang Kai. He knew that this Human was too powerful for them and he and his team were no match for him. Exposing themselves at this point would be no different from committing suicide.

Despite acting swiftly though, Yang Kai, who had just stepped out of the Sealed World, still sensed something and quickly looked in their direction. Apparently, he had realised they were there. As their eyes met, the High-Rank Clansman felt a chill shoot up his spine.

Before he could react, Yang Kai pushed out his palm as his Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm’s World Force burst forth. Without having a chance to resist, the Black Ink Clansmen hiding in the Black Ink Cloud were all instantly killed.

The High-Rank Black Ink Clansman thought that Yang Kai was simply lucky enough to have found a Sealed World to recuperate in, but the truth was that luck only played a part in it. As a Master of the Dao of Space, Yang Kai could easily find Sealed Worlds that the Black Ink Clan hadn’t discovered.

Not only had he been recuperating during this period of time, but he had also picked clean all of the resources in this particular Sealed World.

Although he had already obtained an astonishing harvest from robbing the home territories of two Territory Lords, Yang Kai didn’t mind collecting even more resources.

He was already pleased that he could snatch so much from the Black Ink Clan, and it was even more satisfying that he had also destroyed two Territory Lord Black Ink Nests.

Just like the Black Ink Clan expected, Yang Kai’s next target was still a Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest.

Nevertheless, even though he had killed this search party, another nearby group of Black Ink Clansmen soon noticed what happened. Realising that Yang Kai might have appeared, they quickly spread the word.

By the time everyone found out that Yang Kai had reappeared, he had arrived at a Feudal Lord’s Fief.

With the previous experiences, Yang Kai was already familiar with how to look for the local Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest.

The Black Ink Clansmen in this Feudal Lord’s Fief were weak, so it only took Yang Kai a little effort to kill them all. He then headed straight to the Feudal Lord’s Black Ink Nest.

The moment he entered the central chamber, he opened his Small Universe and let the Black Ink Nest absorb his World Force. With that serving as a bridge, he connected himself with the Black Ink Nest’s consciousness.

Just a moment later, his Divine Sense entered the special space with the Black Ink Nest’s consciousness as the medium.

As usual, there were a lot of consciousnesses in this special space. These consciousnesses represented the Feudal Lords who had their own Fiefs and Black Ink Nests. Many of the Feudal Lords had left for the battlefield to fight against the Humans. Despite that, other Black Ink Clansmen could stay back and guard their Black Ink Nests.

Hence, Yang Kai wasn’t surprised one bit.

However, he soon realised that something was off.

Previously, when he entered this space with his consciousness, the other consciousnesses didn’t pay much attention to him; however, on this day, all the consciousnesses around him appeared hostile to him.

Yang Kai could clearly feel that these consciousnesses were paying close attention to him. Hostility and formidable powers exuded from these consciousnesses.

[Was I exposed?] A thought flashed through Yang Kai’s mind, but he soon realised something. In fact, it wasn’t surprising. He had done the same thing before, so it was expected that the Black Ink Clan had put their guard up.

Nevertheless, since he had the audacity to make a move, he had the confidence to keep himself safe.

The consciousnesses didn’t intend to say anything to Yang Kai. The moment Yang Kai understood all this, however, the special space froze as a restrictive power spread across it, like a Heaven sealing Earth locking array.

Yang Kai instantly appeared surprised, for he had never expected that such a turn of events would happen in this space. With that said, this space was transformed from the consciousness of a Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest, so it wasn’t surprising that there were secrets that he wasn’t aware of.

He tried cutting off his connection with the Black Ink Nest, but he realised that it wasn’t possible to do so. The space had been completely sealed up, so unless he could shatter this place’s barriers, he couldn’t possibly withdraw his Divine Sense. If he forcefully tried, his Soul might be damaged.

It seemed that his consciousness had been locked inside this space.

“I’ve been waiting for you!” The moment the space was sealed off, a voice reached him, one that sounded furious and vexed.

Yang Kai could sense that this consciousness gave off a familiar aura. Moreover, this consciousness was unlike the others, it was far more powerful. It was like a crane standing among the chickens.

A doubtful Yang Kai asked, “Hei Yuan?”

The consciousness roared, “I’m glad that you recognise me!”

Yang Kai was astounded, “It’s really you! So, you were waiting for me?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Hei Yuan replied, “En. I knew that you wouldn’t stop trying to destroy the other Territory Lords’ Black Ink Nests, so I chose one and waited for you. It surprises me that you really came to Kong Chan’s territory. It seems that I’m in luck.”

Yang Kai had no idea who Kong Chan was, but he reckoned that he was the owner of this territory, and a Territory Lord.

The reason Hei Yuan decided to wait here was that Kong Chan’s territory was the closest to the Territory Lord’s territory where the Black Ink Nest was previously destroyed by Yang Kai. He reckoned that Yang Kai would most likely come to this area.

Now, it seemed that his wait was worth it, for Yang Kai had really come to this place. At that instant, Hei Yuan felt slightly less aggrieved.

As a Territory Lord, he was equivalent to an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master; however, he had been trying to hunt Yang Kai down recently, but he couldn’t even find out the latter’s whereabouts. It was expected that he was frustrated.
