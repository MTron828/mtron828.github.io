One of the top cultivators in the Star Field, the Yan Family’s Second Elder, who was a Third-Order Origin King Realm Master, was killed by his fellow clansman for no apparent reason.

Nobody could accept this kind of outcome. It would’ve been better if Yan Qing was killed by Yang Kai; however, since the beginning, Yang Kai had only been clenching his neck. He had never attempted to kill him. The person who ended his life was the Great Elder Yan An, who had stabbed his sword into Yan Qing twice!

Was the Great Elder taken advantage of by Yang Kai because he was no match for him? That wasn’t the case. It was just that this young man was too horrifying because he was able to toy with two Third-Order Origin Kings with ease, making one of them kill the other against his will. No one could possibly be his equal in this world in terms of power.

Yang Kai was a man who would repay a debt of gratitude, but he would also retaliate against those who had harmed him. Although he felt pity for them, he still had to destroy them because they were the ones who wanted to kill him.

When a cultivator picked up his sword, he had to be psychologically prepared that he would be stabbed by his opponent as well.

In a nonchalant manner, Yang Kai threw the corpse away as though the latter was a rag sack. Then, he shot a cold glance at Yan An.

Yan An came to his senses when he was met with the young man’s gaze, and he could feel his heart trembling violently. It wasn’t the right time for him to blame himself and feel sorrowful. The most important task at hand was to solve the crisis before his eyes. He thought that since he had deployed so many Masters around the palace, they would be able to capture their ‘guests’ with ease. However, before they could even find out the young man’s background, the Second Elder had been killed, which was a huge loss to the family. If Yan An was also harmed in any way, Yan Family’s power would plummet.

With this thought in mind, he hurriedly retreated, but he was shocked to see Yang Kai extending his hand toward him. The young man’s movement appeared slow, but it was apparent to Yan An that he could not dodge or parry his move. With goosebumps all over his body, he was already drenched in cold sweat as he shouted, “Patriarch, save me!”

Yang Kai failed in his attempt to grab Yan An, who had disappeared into thin air. Then, Yan An suddenly appeared in a place that was tens of metres away. He was still reeling from the shock as he was panting heavily.

“Oh?” Yang Kai arched his brow. Instead of looking at Yan An, he turned his head to look in another direction.

Someone was hovering in the air over there as he looked down at Yan Qing’s corpse with a gloomy expression.

Yan An didn’t escape unscathed because of his own skill. He was saved by that person. Just now, for a moment, Yang Kai could sense the fluctuation of Space Force. The way Yan An disappeared and appeared again was similar to his own instantaneous movement, but the distance was much shorter.

“Are you the Patriarch of the Yan Family?” Yang Kai asked.

With a cold expression, Yan Luo didn’t even spare Yang Kai a glance, as though the latter wasn’t existent. After staring at Yan Qing for a while, he uttered, “It’s been a long time since anyone dared to make a scene in our home.”

Despite his calm voice, he was burning with rage. An Elder had been killed when he wasn’t paying attention, which was a huge loss for the family.

“You must die!” Yan Luo suddenly turned his head and glowered at Yang Kai with a hideous expression.

Yang Kai grinned, “Patriarch Yan, that will depend on whether you’re powerful enough to kill me.”

“Do you think that Body Tempering is invincible? Many things in this world are beyond your imagination! You’re just a frog at the bottom of a well, so how are you able to imagine the magnificence of the whole Starry Sky?”

Hearing that, Yang Kai pondered on it and nodded, “You’re right.”

Raising his hand, Yan Luo pointed at the young man and uttered dispassionately, “Kill yourself now. You’ll suffer less pain this way. If I make a move on you, I’ll make sure that you’ll go through the most excruciating torture the world has to offer.”

Yang Kai replied, “I came all the way here just to ask you all about the way to head to the Ancestral Domain, and I was willing to give you appropriate compensation. Patriarch Yan, why are you so stone-hearted? Why do all of you want me dead?”

“It seems that I have no choice but to make a move. Otherwise, you’ll never repent!” Yan Luo snorted as he wasn’t willing to keep talking to him anymore. Then, he pressed his finger down.

In an instant, the world seemed to be buzzing as an unspeakable pressure descended from the sky, as though the Heavens themselves were about to collapse. Regardless of their cultivation, all the Origin Kings in the hall bent over and couldn’t raise their heads.

He Yun Xiang was horrified as her alluring face had been transformed by fear. She thought that after she reached the Third-Order Origin King Realm, she could walk sideways around the Star Field. Even if she came across someone she couldn’t defeat, she could still run away with ease. However, after Yan Luo made a move, she came to the realization that she was utterly wrong.

The pressure he could impose on them with just one finger was already so terrifying. If she was targeted by him, she wouldn’t stand a chance to flee.

[Why is he so powerful? Yan Luo’s aura suggests that he’s also in the Third-Order Origin King Realm. Even though he’s been in this realm for a longer time, he shouldn’t be so much stronger than I am.]

At this moment, the pressure Yan Luo had imposed on her was even more terrifying than what Yang Kai had before. He was just standing there, but it was as though he was as mighty as the Heavens and Earth themselves. The word he uttered was the law of nature, and no one could go against his will.

“Star Source Strength!” Yang Kai arched his brow as he was surprised, but he soon felt relieved.

Apparently, Yan Luo was a Star Master. Specifically, he was the Star Master of Taiyi Star. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to use its power.

Taiyi Star was the Yan Family’s base. As the Yan Family’s Patriarch, it was expected that he had refined Taiyi Star’s Source, thus becoming its Master.

[No wonder he is so arrogant. So, this is the reason behind it.]

As a Star Master, he was practically the ruler of Taiyi Star.

Yang Kai was currently still the Master of Shadowed Star, so he understood the kind of power a Star Master could use on his own Cultivation Star.

The reason Yan An could escape from him wasn’t thanks to any Space Technique. It was because Yan Luo had used his power as Star Master to move the former.

Despite feeling a heaviness press down on him, Yang Kai didn’t bend. Instead, he looked playfully at Yan Luo, who was hovering in mid-air.

Even without using any Qi, he could resist such pressure with his body. A Star Master couldn’t make him bend his back as he was far beyond that level now. Activating his Dragon Transformation Secret Technique, Yan Kai could assume a 150-metre tall Half-Dragon form. With his Dragon bloodline, Yang Kai wouldn’t bow his head to a mere Third-Order Origin King no matter what kind of external aid he possessed.

“What?” Yan Luo was shocked.

Although he hadn’t exerted all his might, no one could possibly bear a Star Master’s wrath while in their domain. [His Tempered Body is so strong that he can resist this kind of pressure!? Did he obtain some kind of unfathomable inheritance or something?]

With this thought in mind, Yan Luo became excited. If that was the case, he would gain a lot of benefits by killing this young man, which sent him laughing riotously.

“What are you laughing at?” Yang Kai asked.

“I’m laughing at what I should be laughing at.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Then I should laugh as well.”

“Only if you can laugh…” Yan Luo straightened his other four fingers, which basically became a palm now. Then, he twisted his wrist and sent a palm towards Yang Kai while he continued to float up above.

The world hummed again and those who were already bowed over now directly fell to their knees. No one was spared from this.

The indirect pressure was already so powerful, so they couldn’t imagine how Yang Kai would end up to be since he was the target. With a worried expression, He Yun Xiang raised her head to look at Yang Kai with great difficulty, only to be left flabbergasted.

Yang Kai stomped his feet on the ground, upon which the area around him collapsed and formed into a pit. Thousands of tiles in the main hall shot up into the air together and turned into dust.

With the help of the stomp, Yang Kai shot up into the air like a meteor.

Rising 30 metres up in the air, he was hindered slightly by the pressure from Yang Luo’s palm. Nevertheless, the hindrance was only temporary and in the next moment, he broke through the resistance with a force that could shatter any Origin King Realm Master.

Yang Kai appeared right before Yan Luo in the next instant and sent a fist out at him.

Yan Luo was stunned as the calmness and contempt on his face disappeared, which were then replaced by seriousness and disbelief.

[How is he so strong? I’m a Star Master, the ruler of all on Taiyi Star! How is it possible that he can resist my powers with such ease!?]

The space around them shook, and collapsed as Yang Kai’s fist shattered space itself, leaving deep gashes in the Void!

Yan Luo could feel his surroundings had collapsed and at that instant, an innumerable number of ideas flashed through his mind, but he eventually concluded that he had to dodge this attack no matter what.

If he was hit by this fist, he would surely lose his life. Even though he was a Star Master, he wouldn’t be able to withstand it.

Just then, a figure flashed across everyone’s eyes as Yan Luo disappeared from their sight.

Yang Kai’s fist struck the air; however, without a target, his power scattered, hitting nothing.

When a rumbling sound was heard, the main hall collapsed, sending up a cloud of dust and rubble. Countless figures that appeared quite dishevelled flew out of the hall, coughing repeatedly.

As the commotion spread, people at the bottom of the mountain looked up and were all astounded by what they saw. The main hall of the Yan Family, which had stood on the twin summit for thousands of years, had turned into ruins now as the walls were all damaged. It was as though doomsday had arrived. More and more people flew out of the main hall and cursed.

It was the middle of the night, but the city down below was still bustling, so countless people in the streets stopped what they were doing to look up at the mountain with doubtful expressions. They wondered what had happened to the Yan Family that such a commotion had been caused.

Without anything supporting him, Yang Kai fell back down and landed on a piece of plank sticking out of the ruins. Then, he looked in a particular direction and asked, “Patriarch Yan, are you still able to laugh now?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Certainly, the grin had been wiped off Yan Luo’s face. His face appeared so cold that it was as though one could scrape a layer of frost off it. With his gaze trembling slightly, he stared at Yang Kai in disbelief.

He couldn’t believe that someone was able to threaten him on Taiyi Star. That was something that had never crossed his mind before.

He wasn’t the only Star Master in Unending Star Field. However, it was a universal fact that within a Star Master’s territory, whether the Star Master was in the Second-Order or Third-Order Origin King Realm, they were basically invincible.

That was because a Star Master could utilize his or her Cultivation Star’s Star Source Strength, which was the power of the world. Who could have the ability to go against an entire world?

The thing he had never dared to imagine had actually happened right before his eyes, so he thought that he must be dreaming.

After a moment of silence, he uttered, “You’re indeed incredible. You’ve proven yourself to be a true Body Tempering Master. However, if you think you can defeat me, then you’re wrong.”

He was invincible on this Star. No matter how powerful the young man was, he could never touch a Star Master.

“Patriarch Yan, are you sure you still want to be so obstinate?” Yang Kai shot him an impassive glance.

Yan Luo growled, “You’ve killed my family’s Elder and destroyed our foundation. No matter who you are, we’ll fight with you till our deaths!” There was no way he could tolerate it after suffering such a huge loss. The more powerful his enemy was, the more ill-tempered he became. If he couldn’t rebuild their reputation, the Yan Family would lose their footing in Unending Star Field.

Yang Kai let out a sigh, “Patriarch Yan, something you just said was correct.”

Yan Luo stared coldly at him.

The young man went on to say, “A frog at the bottom of the well can never imagine the magnificence of the Starry Sky. I’m in a good mood today, so I’ll broaden the horizons of you wastes.”

As he spoke, a powerful aura surged within him.
