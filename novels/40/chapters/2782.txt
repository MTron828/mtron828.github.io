Sure enough, an island that was neither small nor large came into view a short while later. Suddenly coming across a beautiful island in the middle of this endless sea could be said to be a kind of visual enjoyment. The island did not cover a large area, only being several dozen kilometres wide, while on the beach, waves came and went while birds rested leisurely.

Yang Kai and Nanmen Da Jun landed on the shore a moment later.

“Hmm?” Yang Kai frowned suddenly and looked at Nanmen Da Jun strangely, “Isn’t the Grandmaster unaffiliated? Why are there so many people on this island?”

When he swept his Divine Sense across the island, Yang Kai clearly found signs of activity. There were at least twenty people here, including six Emperor Realm Masters. If it weren’t for the presence of so many Emperors, he would have assumed that this place was the residence of a small Sect, but no small Sect would have so many Emperor Realm Masters.

Nanmen Da Jun heard Yang Kai’s question and was just about to open his mouth to explain when a stream of light suddenly rushed towards them from the front. It was clear that somebody had sensed their auras and came to investigate.

“Palace Master, please don’t say anything. I will deal with them!” Nanmen Da Jun said anxiously, as if he was seriously worried about something.

Yang Kai frowned in response as he began to feel that something was amiss about this trip.

Meanwhile, that stream of light dissipated to reveal the figure of a middle-aged man, who exuded the cultivation of a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master. That man glanced at them and casually asked, “Who are you?”

Both of them were First-Order Emperor Realm Masters; therefore, this middle-aged man was not too concerned about them nor was he wary towards them. He even had a hint of arrogance in his expression when he questioned them.

Nanmen Da Jun immediately gritted his teeth and replied, “Debt collectors!”

[Debt collectors?] Yang Kai turned his head and glanced at Nanmen Da Jun only to discover that Nanmen Da Jun was acting serious with a furious expression. Moreover, Nanmen Da Jun now seriously looked like a creditor who had come to collect his due.

[What the hell is going on?] Yang Kai was puzzled. Unfortunately, the situation did not allow him to ask for an explanation.

To his surprise, the middle-aged man nodded lightly after hearing those words, “So, we’re in the same business. How much are you owed?”

Nanmen Da Jun replied without even thinking about it, “Five million High-Rank Source Crystals. You?”

The middle-aged man coldly snorted, “Twenty million! If I find that bitch, I’ll definitely skin her alive!”

“That’s outrageous!” Nanmen Da Jun nodded in agreement, “Skinning someone like that alive is going too easy on that kind of trash. If I get my hands on her, I’ll make sure she tastes the worst torture the world has to offer!”

“Hahaha,” the middle-aged man smiled slightly and nodded. “Very good.”

Then, Nanmen Da Jun asked, “Are all the people here debt collectors as well?”

“That’s right,” the middle-aged man nodded and explained, “We have reached an agreement among us. If anybody finds her, we will capture first, then immediately signal the others. Everybody else will rush over right away so that that slut won’t be able to escape! Since the two of you are debt collectors as well, we will let you have your share. However, I will warn you first; there seems to be an extremely strong Spirit Array protecting this island, so don’t take anything suspicious lightly.”

“Many thanks,” Nanmen Da Jun said, cupping his fists.

“It’s nothing. We are all victims here, so it’s only natural to help each other out,” the middle-aged man responded politely. He said a few more words to Nanmen Da Jun then before turning around and flying away.

Watching that person leave, Nanmen Da Jun signalled Yang Kai with his eyes and quietly sneaked toward the other side of the island.

“What happened to that Artifact Refining Grandmaster?” Yang Kai asked through Divine Sense transmission, “Why are there so many creditors here? How much money does she owe them?”

“Who knows?” Nanmen Da Jun had an exasperated expression.

Yang Kai clicked his tongue and said, “Seeing as you are so adept at dealing with this, it seems that you expected this from the beginning?”

Nanmen Da Jun wore a bitter smile and nodded, “This is what makes that woman so hateful. It’s not the first time something like this happened.”

Yang Kai wondered, “Isn’t she an Artifact Refining Grandmaster? Just refining a few Emperor Artifacts should be enough to pay off any debt she has, right?”

Nanmen Da Jun sighed, “It doesn’t matter how many Emperor Artifacts she refines, as she can’t stop herself from gambling.”

“That Grandmaster is an avid gambler?” Yang Kai asked in shock.

“It’s worse than that, she’s simply addicted to gambling. As if that wasn’t bad enough, she always loses when gambling,” Nanmen Da Jun had a scornful look. “That’s why I said she is troublesome.”

Yang Kai suddenly realized something and said, “Did you win that flying boat Emperor Artifact through a bet with her?”

Nanmen Da Jun blushed, “I was forced to do it! It wasn’t my intention to gamble with her.”

In just a few words, Yang Kai garnered a deep understanding of this unknown Emperor Artifact Refiner. [Tsk, tsk. This person is quite the character. I can’t believe she gambled away a flight-type Emperor Artifact worth hundreds of millions. Moreover, she lost the bet too. No wonder so many creditors are hanging around. Isn’t this life a little too miserable despite being an Emperor Artifact Refiner?]

While they were talking, they came to a steep mountain wall. There, Nanmen Da Jun sneakily released his Divine Sense to investigate and make sure that no one was paying attention nearby. After that, he suddenly took out a token and waved it in front of him. A series of ripples immediately appeared on a rock on the mountain wall, revealing a passage big enough for one person to enter and exit. Nanmen Da Jun hurriedly went inside while simultaneously beckoning to Yang Kai. Once Yang Kai was inside, Nanmen Da Jun quickly closed the entrance behind them.

As if noticing the suspicion on Yang Kai’s face, Nanmen Da Jun took the initiative to explain, “I helped arrange the Spirit Array here. If not for this Illusion Array, she wouldn’t have any place to hide by now.”

“You two seem to share a good relationship…” Yang Kai chuckled.

“Palace Master, please don’t mention me in the same sentence as her,” Nanmen Da Jun had an expression of disdain on his face. “If people find out that I am acquainted with her, it will only bring disaster.”

“It can’t be that bad, right?” Yang Kai seemed confused.

Nanmen Da Jun said bitterly, “Palace Master, you haven’t experienced how shameless she is. I helped pay off a bit of debt for her in the past, then those creditors suddenly began knocking on my door, one after the other. Even now, the memory is still vivid in my mind,” he shuddered while speaking.

Yang Kai didn’t know what to say. It seemed as if this Emperor Artifact Refiner had inflicted quite a lot of psychological traumas on Nanmen Da Jun.

The pair headed deeper inside, walking for a half an hour or so before the front brightened up abruptly and a large cave entered their field of vision. However, the cave was empty, with many tunnels leading in all directions.

“Please wait for a moment, Palace Master,” after Nanmen Da Jun said that, he turned around and studied the tunnels. A short while later, his gaze locked onto one of the tunnels before he coughed lightly and shouted, “Xiao Hou, come out.”

Nobody replied to that, only his voice echoed in that cave.

“Why aren’t you coming out? Do you think I can’t see you?” Nanmen Da Jun shouted, his expression darkening.

“Don’t come over! If you dare to take a single step forward, I’ll kill myself!” Without warning, a female voice rang out. The voice sounded extremely weak, like its owner had suffered a grave injury. Moreover, those words were full of despair. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

When Nanmen Da Jun first mentioned that this Artifact Refining Grandmaster was a woman, Yang Kai had been a bit surprised, but after thinking about it for a bit, he relaxed. It wasn’t like he had never met female Artifact Refiners before, and among them, Yang Yan was the greatest Artifact Refiner and Array Master he knew.

Nanmen Da Jun’s expression became livid as he furiously shouted, “You idiot! Can’t you even recognize my voice anymore?!”

The woman hidden in the tunnel fell silent for a moment; however, Yang Kai could sense a pair of eyes studying them. A moment later, a figure rushed out like the wind and stood right in front of them.

“Oh, it’s you, Da Jun!” The woman exclaimed in pleasant surprise.

Yang Kai glanced at the woman and discovered that even though her appearance was not country-destroying, she was still quite a beauty. She was wearing a floral dress that made her look playful and cute, but her figure was curvy and mature. Not to mention, her complexion seemed a little pale for some reason.

On the other hand, she seemed very happy to be reunited with an old friend. She paused for a moment before throwing herself at Nanmen Da Jun.

“What are you doing?!” Nanmen Da Jun was clearly prepared for such antics and swiftly reached out his hand to press his palm against her head, using his Emperor Qi to firmly hold her back.

In response, she smiled flatteringly and coyly called out, “Da Jun—”

“What extraordinary impudence you have!” Nanmen Da Jun shouted furiously. Pouring his Emperor Qi into his palm, he pushed her away.

Unexpectedly, the woman pushed back against the pressure, stepping forward, slipped past him, and rushed into his chest for a brief moment before she spun around and fluttered over to a smooth rock nearby while giggling happily.

“My ring!” Nanmen Da Jun’s expression went pitch-black as he suddenly felt something missing from his hand, lifting his gaze to see his Space Ring now in the hands of this woman. She held it up between two fingers and waved it at him as if showing off.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed, revealing a look of surprise. What happened just now had occurred too quickly, and although he couldn’t see her movements clearly, he still vaguely detected some traces of her movements. This Emperor Artifact Refiner was quite quick on her feet! Even though Nanmen Da Jun was guarded against her, his Space Ring was taken away in an instant! Was she really an Artifact Refiner, not a thief?

“Give it back to me!” Nanmen Da Jun stretched out his hand to her with an icy expression.

In response, the woman pursed her rosy lips and casually erased his Soul Imprint from the ring. Searching through it, she laughed brightly before taking out several bottles of wine as she happily said, “You always do treat me the best!”

While speaking, she lay down on the rock, unsealed the bottle, and gulped down the wine. At the same time, she silently flicked the Space Ring back to Nanmen Da Jun, who caught it with a dark expression and said nothing. Afterwards, the only sound in the cave was the sound of her glugging the wine.

Yang Kai rubbed his forehead and suddenly felt a headache coming on. He didn’t think much of it when he heard that this Emperor Artifact Refiner was addicted to gambling; however, he felt like leaving after seeing her seasoned drunkard posture right at that moment. Right now, the only thought that came to Yang Kai’s mind was, [Damn it! Another female drunkard!]

A few days ago, what Gao Xue Ting did after drinking had cast an indelible psychological shadow in Yang Kai’s heart. For that reason, he couldn’t help recalling the traumatic events of that day whenever he saw a woman drinking. Just thinking about it made his heart pound wildly and his breathing grow short.
