Chapter 1628, Do You Know Him?

“But why is this place expanding? Could there have been some kind of accident?” Chu Ling Xiao was a little worried.

“It should be related to Sect Master, you don’t have to worry about it,” A voice suddenly came from behind. The masters from the Three Clans turned around and saw Yang Xiu Zhu, Chu Han Yi, Mo Yu, and Lin Yu Rao. All of these peak Origin Returning Realm masters had come together.

The Three Clans’ masters did not dare show any neglect and politely offered their greetings.

Yang Xiu Zhu and the others responded in kind.

Everyone was familiar with one another and knew what their respective identities were.

Although Yang Xiu Zhu and the other Origin Realm masters were far stronger and older than the master from the Three Clans, Ling Tai Xu and those from Tong Xuan Realm had a very close relationship with Yang Kai, so they all treated each other as equal peers.

“This is related to Yang Kai?” Ling Tai Xu was intrigued, “Brother Yang, could you explain a little more?”

Everyone turned to look at Yang Xiu Zhu curiously.

Yang Xiu Zhu pondered for a moment before replying, “The higher Sect Master’s cultivation becomes, and the more profound his attainments in the Dao of Space are, the broader this world will become.”

He did not know much about doesn’t know much about Sealed World Bead. As one of the former Elders of Star Emperor Mountain, he only knew that it was a kind of storage artifact and an Emperor Artifact, but he could still explain roughly what was happening.

Hearing what he said, everyone nodded.

“So, this was all caused by Yang Kai somehow? Is he here?” Zhang Yuan showed a suspicious expression, releasing his Divine Sense and a moment later saying, “He’s really here! It seems he is in Xia Girl’s loft. There is also a strange energy fluctuation coming from his location. Is this Space Force?”

“It should be!”

While everyone was chatting, the expansion of the Small Sealed World did not stop.

From the original hundred-kilometre radius, it expanded all the way to ten thousand kilometres in diameter before finally stopping.

At the edge of the Small Sealed World, there still seemed to be a strange force which was blocking Yang Kai’s Space Force from advancing, indicating that there was still more to this place but also making it impossible for anyone inside to see it yet.

“Hey, there seem to be some buildings over there!” Thunder Dragon’s eyes were sharp and could see that in the distance there was a new set of building. These buildings were not too densely constructed and although they seemed a bit scattered and disorderly, their arrangement also seemed to contain some kind of hidden mystery as well.

“Should we go have a look?” Everyone was curious and eager to explore.

“Haha, this old master will be going on ahead!” A loud laugh came out as Old Demon turned into a stream of light and rushed towards that side fearlessly.

The others shook their heads slowly and followed close behind.

Yang Xiu Zhu and the other Origin Realm masters exchanged a wry look before also keeping up.

A short time later, everyone arrived at the location of the buildings and were shocked as soon as they did.

Because the World Energy here was more than three times richer than their original position, which meant that cultivating here would be three times as efficient as before!

“This place is good. My Monster Race will take this section!” Thunder Dragon held out his hand and motioned towards a large area.

“Then my Demon Race will occupy this piece.” Zhang Yuan followed suit.

Ling Tai Xu and Meng Wu Ya looked at each other, the former looking calm and relaxed as he said, “Then the rest will be occupied by my Human Race.”

With a few words, the masters from the Three Clans divided up this newly emerged building complex, each of them claiming a large swath of land for their respective race.

“It seems that this new stretch of the world has richer aura than before, but does that mean if Yang Kai continued to expand this place in the future, there will be even better places to occupy?” Chu Ling Xiao pondered thoughtfully.

“That should be the case.”

“It’s just a question of how big this place will eventually be then. If it is big enough, this Senior is willing to remain here for the rest of his life,” Zhang Yuan laughed.

He reaffirmed at this moment that his decision to leave Tong Xuan Realm with the Demon Race elite and follow Yang Kai was the right one.

If he had remained on Tong Xuan Realm, how could he have a chance to break through to the Saint King Realm or spy on a higher Martial Dao?

Perhaps he would have died of old age, never being able to surpass the achievements of Great Demon God.

But now, the legend of Great Demon God had been broken by countless people.

Since Zhang Yuan has such thoughts, so how could Thunder Dragon be different?

Both were extremely grateful to Yang Kai.

Over the next few days, the Three Clans collectively relocated, abandoning their previously built lofts and flooding into the newly emerged region.

Time flew by and soon another three months had passed.

Yang Kai finally exited his secluded retreat.

Xia Ning Chang had been standing guarding in front of the loft all this time, and when Yang Kai called her to ask about the situation in the Small Sealed World, he was surprised to learn just how huge the changes here had been.

The expansion of the Small Sealed World was a matter of course. As his cultivation and understanding of the Dao of Space increased, this world would surely continue to grow and gradually reveal all its hidden mysteries.

Yang Kai was also very curious about how big this place was.

The appearance of a new set of buildings also surprised Yang Kai greatly.

None of this was bad, however, and after finishing his retreat, Yang Kai brought Xia Ning Chang around to confirm that there were no dangers in this Small Seal world. Discovering nothing harmful and realizing that the new cultivation environment was two to three times better than before, Yang Kai felt happy and relieved.

Finished with these necessities, Yang Kai next went to see Qian Tong.

Qian Tong was fine. Although he had been slightly injured by Luo Hai at the periphery of Green Mountains Star, in the end, he was still an Origin King. Qian Tong had recovered quickly and was now working hard to consolidate his cultivation. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Seeing everything going well, Yang Kai put down the last of his worries and then picked out an excellent palace for him and Xia Ning Chang to stay in inside the Small Sealed World.

Yang Kai wanted to take this opportunity to cultivate his Monster Transformation and develop the Golden Divine Dragon Source in his body.

Living together with Little Senior Sister, he naturally enjoyed the time shared with his precious lover.

Out of the several years that he lived, it was during times like these that Yang Kai felt the most comfortable.

Pure Ice Island, inside the ice room of Ran Yun Ting.

Su Yan stood like a white flower blossoming in a world of ice and snow, her aura cold and her white clothes untainted by the mundane.

“You want to go out for life experience?” Ran Yun Ting frowned.

Su Yan came here to look for her today to make such a request, surprising Ran Yun Ting quite a bit.

“Yes!” Su Yan nodded.

“Why do you suddenly want to go out for life experience?” Ran Yun Ting smiled, “Right now is a critical moment for you to break through to the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm. It is also not a good time for you to be outside as Scarlet Wave Star’s situation is quite tense. Although you have lived in the Inner Island all this time, you have probably heard some rumours about what is happening in the outside world. If you were to meet someone from Brilliant Flame Sect now, it would do you no good. You should know that little bastard Wei Feng is still thinking about you and that Brilliant Flame Sect is using this as an excuse to suppress Ice Heart Valley into handing you over to them.”

“Disciple understands clearly,” Su Yan lightly spoke. “But it is also for this reason that disciple wishes to go out for life experience. Perhaps, after taking a walk outside, Disciple will receive some kind of inspiration, which will allow her cultivation to improve.”

“En, a reasonable proposition,” Ran Yun Ting nodded but still felt things were a bit difficult. If Su Yan had asked to go out at any other point, she certainly would not have tried to stop her. Although her disciple only had a First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation, her combat power was not inferior to an average Third-Order cultivator.

She was the type of genius who could fight above her realm, an elite among elites!

With her Ice Crystal Jade Body’s Special Constitution and Ice Heart Valley’s Ice Jade Secret Art, Su Yan had few rivals below the Origin King Realm.

Cultivation was not just a matter of cultivating in secluded retreat, going out for experience had always been an essential part of one’s growth.

But now, Scarlet Wave Star was in a state of upheaval, so how could Ran Yun Ting feel safe allowing Su Yan to wander outside?

Just as she was considering what kind of excuse she could use to persuade Su Yan to remain in the Sect, Ran Yun Ting suddenly noticed something and stared at Su Yan firmly, her brow gradually furrowing.

Immediately, she released her Divine Sense and scanned Su Yan.

“What kind of problem did you encounter in your cultivation? Why is your Pure Jade Ice Heart suddenly unstable? Why has your cultivation regressed?” Ran Yun Ting’s beautiful face paled.

She suddenly realized that Su Yan’s cultivation had not risen since the last time she saw her, but had fallen instead.

Although this decline was quite small, as Su Yan’s Master, Ran Yun Ting was naturally able to notice.

This development stunned Ran Yun Ting.

Even if Su Yan’s own aptitude was not the highest, her Special Constitution and its unprecedented compatibility with Pure Ice Island’s core Secret Art was enough to make up for any slight deficiencies in talent.

What’s more, Su Yan’s aptitude was exceptional, perhaps there were few people in the entire Star Field comparable to her.

Her cultivation had always progressed at a rapid yet steady pace, but now this kind of strange situation had occurred.

Ran Yun Ting’s expression fluctuated for a time before she realized something, “You have actually been affected by the Secret Art’s backlash due to unstable emotions? Who was it that moved your heart!?”

At this moment, Ran Yun Ting’s expression had turned fierce and her Saint Qi was pulsing madly from her figure.

Cultivating the Ice Jade Secret Art required Su Yan to maintain a Pure Jade Ice Heart. As long as her Pure Jade Ice Heart was calm and serene, her cultivation would advance rapidly!

On the other hand, she would suffer from increasingly intense backlash the more disturbed her Pure Jade Ice Heart became.

The greatest disturbance to a Pure Jade Ice Heart was passion!

This was something that any cultivator who cultivated the Ice Jade Secret Art must avoid at all cost.

The Pure Jade Ice Heart must not be dyed with emotion, and love was by far the blackest of inks which would pollute it the fastest.

Ran Yun Ting understood the truth of the matter almost immediately.

“No, you’ve lived in the Inner Island all year round and have not had any chance to contact men from the outside world!” Ran Yun Ting shook his head in confusion, but soon recalled a certain incident, grit her teeth, and questioned, “Su Yan, tell your Master honestly, is this related to that portrait you saw the other day? Do you know that man?”

Ran Yun Ting was a sharp person and, after considering countless possibilities in a very short period of time, she felt this was the most likely!

When Su Yan saw the portrait that day, a strange expression had appeared on her face, a fact that strengthened Ran Yun Ting’s suspicions.

Facing her Honoured Master’s questioning, Su Yan bit her red lips lightly as a trace of guilt flashed across her face, but that soon disappeared and she replied softly, “Disciple knows him.”

Ran Yun Ting turned pale and she asked in a trembling voice, “What is your relationship with him...?”

“He is my Junior Brother and my man!”

When she said this, a faint smile appeared at the corner of Su Yan’s mouth, one that made her look extremely happy.
