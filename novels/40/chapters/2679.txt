Zhu Qing took a deep breath and replied, “I saw the Ancestral Dragon Source.”

“Is this true?” The old voice suddenly became extremely excited. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Yes!” Zhu Qing nodded, “I saw it with my own eyes, I can’t be wrong.”

“Where did you see it? When did you see it… Hurry up, tell me everything you know.”

Zhu Qing explained what happened after she met Yang Kai today, but she concealed the fact that Yang Kai had taken advantage of her in the middle of their fight. She was a woman, after all, so it was simply too shameless and unbearable for her to even mention it.

Zhu Qing itched with hatred whenever she recalled Yang Kai’s assault. She never thought that her first contact with a man would happen like that.

After listening, the dragon eyes on the Dragon Talisman twinkled and it took a while before the old voice said, “If he could easily suppress your Source Strength, and it was a pure golden colour, it really must be the Ancestral Dragon Source!”

The old voice was incredibly enthusiastic, as if he had encountered something that made him extremely excited, he paused and confirmed with her, “Are you sure that person is a Human?”

“Yes.” Zhu Qing replied, “But he seems to have refined a few dragon artifacts and understood some simple Dragon Transformation Secret Techniques.”

The old voice commented, “Since he has obtained the Ancestral Dragon Source, it’s not strange to have refined several dragon artifacts.”

“Elder, the Ancestral Dragon Source is a big deal, should I… bring him back to the island?” Zhu Qing asked.

The old voice quipped, “Do you think you are capable of that?”

Zhu Qing was speechless.

It was true that Yang Kai only had a First-Order Emperor Realm cultivation, and that she could easily crush an ordinary First-Order Emperor at will, but the Ancestral Dragon Source in his body had too great a suppressive effect on her. The previous battle with Yang Kai had proved this point. She was subdued by Yang Kai even before she could exert half of her strength. To deal with such a person, unless an Elder personally took action, no one could resist the Ancestral Dragon Source’s suppression.

“Then what should I do?” Zhu Qing frowned. The Ancestral Dragon Source was a unique treasure that her clan had been seeking for tens of thousands of years, how could she ignore it now that she finally found it?

The Dragon Talisman was silent for a long time before the old voice decided, “Follow him and try to establish a friendly relationship with him. When the opportunity is right, invite him to the island as a guest.”

“Befriend him?” Zhu Qing’s face went blank, frowning, “He’s just a trivial Human, what qualifications does he have…”

“The Ancestral Dragon Source is his qualification,” The old voice interrupted her without waiting for Zhu Qing to finish speaking. There was an absolution in his tone accompanied by a trace of anger as he asked, “Are you questioning me?”

Zhu Qing’s body trembled, and she lowered her head in submission, “Zhu Qing dares not.”

“En,” the old voice said gruffly, “You must invite him back to the island no matter the price.”

“Then… My task…” Zhu Qing asked hesitantly.

“Continue to investigate, but don’t force the issue,” the old voice replied shortly. Compared to the emergence of the Ancestral Dragon Source Strength, Zhu Qing’s original mission was nothing. It was just a token after all.

“Yes!” Zhu Qing nodded respectfully.

The light in the dragon eyes on the Dragon Talisman gradually dimmed while its deep aura also dissipated slowly. Zhu Qing put it away, frowned, and sat on the edge of the bed feeling upset.

She was violated by Yang Kai, so there was nothing Zhu Qing would like more than to rip him into ten thousand pieces to resolve the hatred in her heart, but her Elder’s order now was to try her best to befriend him…

[Why should this Queen humble herself to make acquaintances with this trivial, lowly Human? It’s too shameful!]

Warm and Inviting Inn, the largest inn in Flowing Shadow City, was the property of Flowing Shadow Sword Sect.

Yang Kai arrived at this inn and after booking a few rooms upstairs, went to the hall downstairs to have a meal.

With his cultivation, there was no need for eating anymore. His body could subsist on the ambient World Energy, but the occasional consumption of food was still somewhat enjoyable.

Ye Jing Han and Du Xian had been a little sad and worried, and Yang Kai did not know how to cheer them up other than comforting their sorrows with the company of wine.

Jugs of alcohol were served, all of which Ye Jing Han drank so enthusiastically that she soon became inebriated and fell asleep in Du Xian’s arms.

Du Xian cast an apologetic look at Yang Kai to which the latter just waved his hand lightly, asking the former to take Ye Jing Han to rest.

Only Yang Kai and Ying Fei were left at the table now.

After three rounds of drinks, Yang Kai suddenly recalled, “Ying Fei, that woman said her name is Zhu Qing. Does it ring any bells to you?”

He suddenly recalled that when Zhu Qing announced her name, she followed up with a strange question about her surname. Yang Kai did not think much about it at the time, but it seemed to have a significant meaning now that he pondered upon it.

Yang Kai thought a lot about it, but still had no ideas. Although Ying Fei lived in the Ancient Wild Lands, he had been cultivating for a long time and had far vaster experiences than Yang Kai, so he just might have some clues.

At the very least, he had to figure out Zhu Qing’s origin.

Yang Kai did not think that such a woman would give up easily, and she did leave some harsh threats right before she flew off.

The wine cup in Ying Fei’s hand halted abruptly as he stared at Yang Kai with wide eagle eyes, asking, “Did you just say… her name was Zhu Qing?”

“What is it?” Yang Kai looked at Ying Fei’s unusually large reaction suspiciously.

It took a while before the shock on Ying Fei’s face receded. He took a gulp of wine before replying solemnly, “On the East Sea’s Dragon Island, the Great Elder of the Dragon Clan is called Zhu Yan.”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and asked sternly, “Does Monster King mean that… She’s from the Dragon Clan?”

Ying Fei answered, “It’s just a guess, I’m not sure. But back then, Zhu Qing said something about me saying a certain word and threatening to kill me if I said it again. I thought about it at the time and couldn’t figure out what word violated her bottom line, but now it seems that there is indeed one word that could enrage her.”

“Which word?” Yang Kai asked.

Ying Fei inquired, “Does Young Master Yang still remember what I said at the time?”

Yang Kai pondered for a while, then grinned, “You said I was handsome and exceptionally talented, truly a…” He stopped suddenly before saying, “So that’s it.”

Ying Fei also nodded and explained, “If she is really a member of the Dragon Clan, it all makes sense. The Dragon Clan has always been savage, and never gives any respect to other Divine Spirits, let alone Monster Race cultivators like me. The word I used to praise Young Master Yang would definitely irritate her.”

At this point, Ying Fei’s face turned pale from fear. Although he was a Monster King, the other party was a Divine Spirit.

[No wonder, no wonder she’s so strong. The Dragon Clan’s strength has always been unrivalled. No wonder I couldn’t see through her cultivation.]

It turned out that Zhu Qing was actually a Dragon Clan member!

Considering all this, his admiration for Yang Kai deepened even more.

[That was a member of the Dragon Clan! What method did Young Master Yang use to get her to yield within such a short time, even allowing him to take advantage of her? On the other hand, the other party didn’t seem to have much intention of resisting. If I hadn’t barged in uninvited, I’m afraid even little dragons could have been conceived.]

How could something like this happen?

The Dragon Clan was arrogant and always regarded themselves as the head of all living creatures. No other race could enter their eyes, let alone a humble Human.

How could Zhu Qing, a True Dragon, endure being violated by a mere Human?

“Young Master Yang, could you also be… from the Dragon Clan?” An idea suddenly came to Ying Fei. It seemed that only being a Dragon himself could explain all the incredible things Yang Kai had done.

Only a Dragon could make another Dragon yield!

Yang Kai guffawed loudly, and patted his own chest, “I’m Human!”

Ying Fei smiled bitterly, not knowing whether to believe it or not.

“Excuse me… Is Your Excellency… Yang Kai… Senior Yang?”

At this moment, a middle-aged man suddenly approached the table, trembling with his head lowered.

Ying Fei glanced at him and found that this guy was just a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, and did not pay much attention to him. However, even just a casual glance from Ying Fei was enough for this man to fall to his knees and exclaim, “Senior, mercy! This lowly one is just here to deliver a letter!”

Although Yang Kai acted extremely presumptuously in Flowing Shadow City, it had not garnered much real attention, but when Ying Fei later exposed his identity and cultivation, everyone was appalled at the fact that he was an authentic Monster King.

At this moment, this middle-aged man was not as very afraid of Yang Kai as he was afraid of Ying Fei.

“No one wants your life!” Yang Kai glanced at him then raised his chin slightly, “What letter is it?”

The middle-aged man scanned Ying Fei quietly and only took a deep breath when he confirmed that the latter was not looking at him anymore. He reached into his robes and took out a gilded note before handing it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai took a look at the page then grinned, “An invitation?”

The middle-aged man nodded repeatedly, “Exactly.”

“Who told you to deliver this?” Yang Kai questioned.

“It was…” The middle-aged man was about to answer, but his eyes suddenly became blank. He tried to recall but could not remember, even feeling a splitting headache coming on.

“Young Master Yang, someone erased his memory with some kind of technique,” Ying Fei’s eyes flashed when he saw this.

Yang Kai nodded lightly and with a sweep of his sleeve, sent the middle-aged man out the door. Since someone had removed the messenger’s memories, it did not make sense to ask anymore as he probably would not be able to get any answers.

Taking a closer look at the invitation card in his hand, Yang Kai could not help raising his brow.

“Young Master Yang, what invitation is it?” Ying Fei asked.

Yang Kai handed the card over casually as he took a sip from his cup and stated, “It looks like someone is getting impatient.”

“Is this an invitation to the auction?” Ying Fei frowned after reading the contents of the card.

They came to Flowing Shadow City this time just for this auction, but Yang Kai did not expect someone to take the initiative to invite him there before he had done anything, as if afraid he wasn’t aware the auction was even taking place.

“Young Master Yang, this is a trap, a dangerous one at that.”

Ying Fei had exposed his identity and cultivation in public today, and the person hiding in the darkness still dared to send an initiation to Yang Kai. There was no doubt that they had found a way to counter him, a Monster King, otherwise, the hidden party would not be acting so confidently.

“I’m not a fool, how can I not see such an obvious thing?” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

“Do you want to summon Old Rhino and Wu Wei too?” Ying Fei asked via Divine Sense.
