He didn’t know if it was because it had absorbed a drop of his Golden Blood, but the little Stone Man was absolutely obedient to Yang Kai and would meticulously execute any order he gave it.

However, Yang Kai’s attempts to communicate with it were somewhat fruitless. He had expected it to obtain its own consciousness just like the Divine Tree, but after examining the situation for a while, it appeared that would be impossible. This little Stone Man was closer to a puppet than a sentient creature.

A few days later, Yang Kai discovered that it possessed a very strange ability: Digging holes!

The speed at which it could burrow through the mountain rock was incredible. Yang Kai only learned about this ability by accident. Because of Yang Kai’s order, this little guy didn’t dare to approach the cave where Yang Yan was. Instead, it would constantly drill down into the ground, a breath after disappearing, already travelling hundreds of meters down, moving through the hard mountain rock as easily as if it were air.

Yang Kai also experimented with a particularly firm piece of ore and found that no matter how hard the ore was, the Stone Man could easily drill a large hole through it.

This skill was actually pretty good, but looking at its flat, blockish head, Yang Kai was truly confused as to how it accomplished this.

Originally, Yang Kai thought that there might be some kind of rare ore deposit down below that had attracted it, but after careful investigation, he rejected this conjecture.

Dragon Cave Mountain didn’t possess any rare spirit grasses, spirit medicines, or ores. Before Yang Kai set up the Aura Gathering Spirit Array, this place had simply been a barren mountain with good scenery. Even now, the only noteworthy feature was its slightly richer World Energy aura.

As long as Dragon Cave Mountain didn’t collapse from all this tunnelling though, Yang Kai was too lazy to care about what this little guy did. It was only because Yang Kai had coincidentally owned a Blood Essence Stone that the Stone Man was able to hatch from its shell while the other remained in its original pitch-black round stone state. If Yang Kai wanted to hatch the other Stone Man, he would probably first need to find another Blood Essence Stone.

But this kind of treasure was too rare; Yang Kai had entered the Star Field for some time now but had never come across or even heard of another Blood Essence Stone. It seemed that the Blood Essence Stones were scarce even in the Star Field.

One day, while Yang Kai was meditating, he suddenly felt a shocking energy fluctuation coming from the cave. This fluctuation erupted but quickly settled down, and in the next moment, Yang Yan’s proud laughter rang out.

[She succeeded?] Yang Kai also wore a look of happiness as he got up and rushed over to the cave.

Inside Yang Kai’s stone room, the Refining Furnace that was as tall as a grown man was still emitting an amazing heat and Yang Yan, who was standing nearby, was dripping in sweat. It could be seen at a glance that she had expended a great deal of effort to refine this artefact, her hair wet and dishevelled, making her look somewhat like a lunatic. She had even taken off her trademark black robe at some point and was now only wearing a thin gauze skirt.

Her sweat-drenched clothes tightly clung to her body, and when Yang Kai rushed in, what first caught his eye was not the artefact he had requested, but Yang Yan’s incredibly attractive figure.

Her rounded bottom seemed to float upwards, as if a great pair of hands was holding it up, exaggerating the curve of her waist. Her smooth and flat abdomen was vaguely visible through her wet clothes and Yang Kai could even clearly see the shape and colour of her undergarments.

En, pink panties that were no bigger than the size of a large palm, just enough to cover her most sensitive area while at the same time stimulating one’s basest imagination. There was also an equally small red cloth wrapped around her upper body that was barely able to contain her two massive peaks.

Yang Kai froze for a moment, wondering if he should wait outside for a while.

Before he could make a decision though, Yang Yan ran over in excitement, not even noticing the spring scenery she was putting on display, her delicate hands gripping an oval shield-shaped artefact and shouting, “See, see! An Origin Grade Low-Rank artefact. I didn’t lie to you, I really am an Origin Grade Artifact Refiner!”

Yang Kai took the shield-like artifact, which was much lighter than he imagined it would be, as if it had no weight at all. The surface of the shield was giving off a faint purple glow so Yang Kai was able to tell that it was refined from the Scarlet Tailed Purple Armoured Scorpion’s carapace as the two shared the same luster. The shield’s surface wasn’t flat and instead had several sharp barbs on it. As for what the effect was, Yang Kai didn’t know.

However, Yang Kai was acutely aware that two different attribute energies, both of which were extremely potent, were coursing through the interior of this shield.

Seeing Yang Kai observing her work carefully, Yang Yan immediately began explaining its merits, “I integrated the Monster Core of the Scarlet Tailed Purple Armoured Scorpion. The primary material for this shield was that Monster Beast’s carapace, so after the core was integrated, it gained the ability to display part of the Scarlet Tailed Purple Armoured Scorpion’s abilities from when it was alive. Of course, you’ll have to experiment with it to determine how to bring out this power, because I don’t know what abilities this Scarlet Tailed Purple Armoured Scorpion had during its lifetime.”

“The sandstorm perhaps?” Yang Kai muttered to himself, immediately remembering the time he had been following Gui Che and discover the place where the Scarlet Tailed Purple Armoured Scorpion was hiding. Back then, an intense sandstorm several dozen kilometres in radius had been concealing the Scarlet Tailed Purple Armoured Scorpion’s figure, making it almost impossible to discover.

“It was able to create a sandstorm?” Yang Yan nodded, “Good good. This shield is the result of my utmost effort, you must make good use of it. Not only can it be used for defence, but the spikes on its surface can also be used as close-range weapons. With this shield, fighting opponents above your realm level shouldn’t be, impossible. No no, definitely won’t be a problem. En, as long as you have this artefact in hand, I guarantee that no Saint King Realm cultivator will be able to hurt you! Unless you stand there dumbly and let them hit you of course!”

Yang Yan struck her chest firmly as she made this vigorous guarantee, completely forgetting the fact that Yang Kai had killed several Saint Kings with his own power just a few days ago. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

When her little hand patted her chest, her towering peaks bounced with astonishing force.

Their elasticity was clearly amazing...

Yang Kai couldn’t help staring at this scene, his eyes being drawn into her seemingly bottomless valley.

“If not for you urging me to finish this up quickly, I could have refined something even better, but for now it’s alright. Origin Grade Low-Rank is just its current grade, en, if you can find some better ores in the future, I can continue enhancing it, raising its grade... Hey, I’m talking to you, why do you look like you’re not listening? What are you looking at?” Yang Yan didn’t know why Yang Kai was revealing an absent-minded look on his face but when she directed her eyes towards where he was staring, she immediately understood.

In an instant, Yang Yan’s cheeks, which were already a bit flushed from the heat, became bright crimson red, as if they were being boiled. After three breaths, a high pitched scream echoed throughout the cave as Yang Yan crouched down and covered her chest with her arms, glaring towards Yang Kai with a deeply aggrieved look while cursing loudly, “Shameless bastard! Pervert! I worked so hard to refine a precious artefact for you, yet you actually... you actually...”

She felt incredibly wronged.

Yang Kai just grinned and didn’t make any comments.

After letting her scold him a few more times, Yang Kai cut in and said, “There’s a pool fed from the mountain stream over there, go wash.”

“I already know that!” Yang Yan bit her red lips, hugging her rich capital even tighter as she snarled, “Get out!”

“Good good good, I’m leaving!” Yang Kai nodded quickly but before he could leave, a slight rumbling noise resounded below Yang Yan’s feet and immediately after, a small hole appeared, and a tiny grey head popped up from it. When this little head appeared, its square eyes turned to stare blankly at Yang Yan.

“Yaa!” Yang Yan shouted even louder, sending out a great slap, whacking the little grey head back into the hole before leaping like a frightened rabbit directly into Yang Kai’s arms.

Two warm, soft, elastic mounds pressed up against Yang Kai’s chest strongly as a mind-numbing fragrance filled his nostrils, granting him an incredibly satisfying sensation.

What made him feel the most speechless though was that Yang Yan’s had even wrapped her legs around his waist.

He knew that she was timid, but it appears he had still been overestimating her courage!

She seemed extremely scared, her tender body shivering uncontrollably as she clung tightly to Yang Kai, constantly glancing around, her eyes filled with fear.

Even after discovering that there was nothing in the cave, she still didn’t seem relieved and nervously asked, “What was that, what was that, why did I feel like it was looking at me just now?”

Yang Kai didn’t know how to explain. The little Stone Man, who was normally very obedient, had suddenly ran over to her cave and popped up from the ground. No wonder Yang Yan had been scared to death.

“Did it leave?” Yang Yan asked again.

“It’s gone.”

“Really?” Releasing her Divine Sense, she scanned the cave and found that there really wasn’t anything else there, finally letting out a sigh of relief.

Looking back, Yang Yan suddenly discovered that she wrapping her arms around Yang Kai’s neck and literally hanging off of him, their two bodies pressed up against each so tightly that she could feel an astonishing heat pressing up against her lower abdomen.

Yang Yan felt like steam was about to leak from her head.

She had never been so close to a man before, and she didn’t know why, but just being in this position made her blood boil and her heart pound so loud it was like a drum was being beaten. In an instant, she felt as if she was suffocating.

She was anxious to find that small thing, which had appeared and drill down into it, never to emerge again.

The weird smile on Yang Kai’s made her feel particularly ashamed.

“You... you put me down!” Yang Yan almost lowered her head into her chest as she shouted weakly.

“I’m not holding you!” Yang Kai spread his hands lightly.

Yang Yan only became more embarrassed when it was pointed out that she was the one wrapping her arms around Yang Kai’s neck while her legs pressed their hips together.

Quickly unwrapping her arms and legs, Yang Yan directly fell onto her bottom, letting out a small yelp when she hit the ground.

“Are you okay?” Yang Kai looked at her speechlessly, consciously not offering his hand. This woman wasn’t just timid, she was conscious of how she was perceived by those close to her, even if he tried to help her up, she would likely refuse.

“I’m fine,” Yang Yan shrank up into a ball, really not getting up, burying her face in her arms as she whispered, “Can you leave first? I want to dust myself off.”

En,” Yang Kai nodded, smiled, and turned away.

Outside the cave, the little Stone Man wobbly stood, almost as if he was drunk, accidentally tripping over his own feet and falling to the ground.

When he did get up, he raised his head and looked at Yang Kai innocently.

“Good job!” Yang Kai suddenly found that this little guy was quite astute and clever. [To think he made such a plan. Haha. How could I have thought he was simple-minded before?]
