Before everyone’s eyes, Zhang Ruo Xi suddenly rushed to the bottom of the enormous pit, knelt down and desperately started digging through the mud with her hands, tears kept rolling down her cheeks as she kept whimpering, “Sir, Sir…”

She was so aggrieved that she kept choking on her words. She seemed to have lost her mind, not even using her Source Qi. She was just using her hands to dig as mud kept flying around her.

In the blink of an eye, her soft and tender fingers had turned bloody, but it seemed as if she could not feel any pain as she kept desperately digging.

Her sadness and desperation had reached a new extreme. They seemed to have turned tangible and slowly spread into the surroundings, affecting many Monster Race Masters and the restrained Stone Spirit Clan. Her tears had a faint redness in them, as if she wasn’t shedding pure tears but a mixture of blood and tears.

“Don’t leave Ruo Xi, Sir, don’t leave…”

Her blood and tears had blurred her vision. Zhang Ruo Xi couldn’t see at all, but her hands never stopped moving, trying to rescue Yang Kai from the ground.

“This little girl…” Fan Wu narrowed his eyes and frowned, staring at the back of kneeling Zhang Ruo Xi. Feeling quite complicated.

“I guess she has a very deep relationship with that kid, but her strength is pretty low,” Luan Feng also heaved a sigh. What could a Third-Order Dao Source Realm do here? The weakest Monster King here had the cultivation of Mid Twelfth-Order, and Peak Eleventh-Order Monster Commanders were just about everywhere.

“Hmph!” Shi Huo, glancing at Zhang Ruo Xi, suddenly coldly snorted as he stretched his hand out to grab her.

He had gone back on his word and killed Yang Kai by sneak attack, but now, a Human woman had suddenly appeared where Yang Kai was buried and was doing as she wished. Wasn’t this tantamount to insulting him?

Ruo Xi was completely unprepared and was directly pinched by that enormous palm.

Shi Huo, who was twenty meters tall, was pinching Zhang Ruo Xi as if he was pinching a doll.

As she was pulled further and further from Yang Kai, Zhang Ruo Xi suddenly came to her senses. She looked up, staring at Shi Huo with her pretty red eyes, who was sizing her up. She struggled hard, kicking and punching the arm as she shouted, “Let me go, I beg you, let me go. I want to save Sir, Sir is still alive, I want to save him!”

But her strength couldn’t be compared with Shi Huo’s. No matter how much she struggled, she couldn’t even shake him.

Shi Huo rebuked with a sneer, “You so-called Sir has died without a burial, your efforts are meaningless.”

Ruo Xi shook his head, shedding tears like rain, “I don’t believe it, I don’t believe it! Sir is still alive, Sir surely has not died!”

Shi Huo angrily shouted, “Little girl, you keep this up and this King will pinch you to death!”

Ruo Xi grit her teeth and suddenly raised her hand. Immediately, a square seal appeared out of thin air.

Ten Thousand Beasts Seal!

Suddenly, wisps of jet-black energy shot out of the seal as dense Yin Qi permeated into the surroundings. Ghastly cries and wails soon followed as those jet-black wisps transformed into Monster Beasts of different shapes and sizes.

“Beast Souls!” Shi Huo raised his brow, looking at the seemingly illusory Monster Beasts in surprise.

With his insight, he could naturally tell that these things were Beast Souls.

Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Guo’s brows slowly rose as well. They were Divine Venerables of the Ancient Lands, so everyone from the Monster Race was their subordinate. As such, so many Beast Souls popping out from Zhang Ruo Xi’s Ten Thousand Beasts Seals made them a little angry; after all, every Monster Race Master served them, and even if they died, their Beast Souls should not be blasphemed by being sealed inside a Human artifact.

This was an artifact that the Ancient Lands Monster Race could definitely not tolerate.

In the brief moment the Four Divine Venerables were distracted though, tens of thousands of Beast Souls had poured out of the Ten Thousands Beasts Souls. Furthermore, their number was still increasing and the energy fluctuations from each and every Beast Soul were quite astonishing, so even comparable to Monster Kings present here.

“Where did so many Beast Souls come from!?” Shi Huo’s face finally changed.

If the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal only had a few hundred Beast Souls, it was nothing to fret over. It could be interpreted as a result of her sealing Beast Souls after killing Monster Beasts for many years. But among these tens of thousands of Beast Souls, there were many Twelfth-Order Monster Beast Souls…

This was a bit shocking. Furthermore, by the looks of it, there were still many Beast Souls sealed inside the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal.

“Little girl, you didn’t venture into the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb, did you?” Shi Huo had a whimsical thought.

While speaking, he slapped the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal as the power of a Divine Spirit burst forth. Struck so, the Ten Thousands Beasts Seal crazily flashed as its spirituality was greatly damaged.

At the same time, the tens of thousands of Beast Souls that had flown out of the seal also returned, unable to unleash any of their might.

The gap in their strength was too wide. Even if Ruo Xi had resorted to the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal, she didn’t pose any threat to Shi Huo.

Shi Huo flicked his arm, throwing Zhang Ruo Xi away as he stated, “This little girl’s artifact is strange, I’m going to check it.”

Luan Feng lightly nodded before stretching her hand out, drawing Zhang Ruo Xi over to her and restraining her so she couldn’t move.

Meanwhile, Shi Huo fiddled with the Ten Thousands Beasts Soul, pouring his Divine Sense into it to investigate. Suddenly, his face changed as he cried in shock, “Millions of Beast Souls!”

“What!?” Fan Wu and the others’ looked shocked as well.

Much to their surprise, millions of Beast Souls were inside the Ten Thousand Beasts Soul, but where did these millions of Beast Souls come from? Everyone was instantly aware of the problem here. In the entire Star Boundary, apart from the Ancient Wild Lands, there was no other place that could provide millions of Beast Souls, and even in the Ancient Wild Lands, there was only one place where there were millions of Beast Souls.

Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb!

Did this little girl really enter the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb? Was Shi Huo’s random guess actually correct?

“Little girl, what’s your name?” Luan Feng, looking at the struggling Zhang Ruo Xi, asked in surprise.

Zhang Ruo Xi didn’t answer her, rather she was still trying to escape back to the pit. But before Luan Feng, how could she leave? Even moving her limbs was an extravagant hope.

*Huala…* FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Suddenly, a strange noise drew everyone’s attention. The next moment, they saw a bloody hand emerge from the pit. That hand looked as if it had stretched straight out from Hell and it was radiating a dark and cold aura.

Shi Huo’s eyes instantly bulged.

Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Guo also looked in that direction in surprise.

Many Monster Kings and the group of Stone Spirits were also dumbfounded.

“I knew you were alive, I knew it,” Xie Wu Wei murmured. At this moment, his emotions were rising up and down like a roller coaster, alternating between nervousness and excitement.

But very soon, Xie Wu Wei slapped his thigh in annoyance. He couldn’t help but curse in his heart, “Stupid, since you were alive while everyone thought you were dead, why didn’t you stay hidden? Why do you have to reveal yourself? Such foolishness is killing me! Why is this King’s life so bitter!?”

“He’s still alive!?” Shi Huo stood gawking at the hand that emerged from the mud, dumbfounded. He couldn’t wait to pluck his eyes out and stretch them forward to get a clearer picture.

“What is this kid?” Luan Feng was also dumbfounded. She was shocked by Yang Kai’s tenacious vitality.

A First-Order Emperor Realm Human was sneak-attacked and punched straight into the ground by Shi Huo, yet he was still alive and kicking.

In front of everyone’s eyes, the emerged hand suddenly retracted before a deafening explosion occurred. The mud covering the pit blew up as a figure staggered out from the pit. The figure broke into a violent fit of coughing as blood dripped from all over it.

The figure was none other than Yang Kai.

The weeping beauty, Zhang Ruo Xi, stared ahead in a daze with her reddened eyes. She went limp and collapsed on the ground, tightly covering her mouth as she uncontrollably choked, her soft and tender shoulders violently shaking.

She didn’t dare to cry, fearing that her cries would affect Yang Kai.

“Shi Huo!” Yang Kai clenched his fist so tightly that his knuckles went white. He grit his teeth, staring at the barbed stone giant, his eyes burning with flames of fury.

If he hadn’t used his Nihility Secret Technique and exiled himself into the Void at the critical moment, not even a shred of his skin might have been left after taking that punch.

Even using Nihility hadn’t completely negated the effects of Shi Huo’s attack. That fearsome blow had even affected the local space, and before the remainder of this wild energy could be dispersed, Yang Kai’s Nihility Secret Technique was disrupted, resulting in the remaining energy from Shi Huo’s attack injuring him.

A dignified Divine Spirit going back on his word was still barely acceptable, but actually using a sneak attack on a foe many times weaker than himself had greatly angered Yang Kai.

“Little brat, you’re pretty tenacious! You are the first one to survive after taking a blow from this King!” Shi Huo stood there, not looking the least bit guilty or ashamed of sneak-attacking Yang Kai. Instead, he just played with the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal as he contemptuously stared at Yang Kai.

Seeing the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal, Yang Kai couldn’t help but be startled. He looked around and very soon found Zhang Ruo Xi.

He had no idea what Ruo Xi was doing here, but he was hit by vertigo when he faintly heard Ruo Xi’s cries.

At this moment, Ruo Xi was on her knees, her delicate hands covering her mouth, her tender body constantly trembling, shedding a stream of joyful and anxious tears.

She must have been deeply shocked by what just happened.

Yang Kai took a deep breath as the hostility and the anger in his eyes gradually dissipated. His clenched fists also loosened up as he then turned his gaze in Fan Wu’s direction before speaking, “Shi Huo has gone back on his words and sneak-attacked me, but I’m not arguing with him over this. According to our agreement, I have removed my Soul Imprint from the Mountains and Rivers Bell. Now, I need to take my friends away. Divine Venerables, you don’t have any objections, right?”

Fan Wu’s eyes flashed as he agreed with a nod, “No objections!”

Although his tone was plain, some appreciation could be found in his eyes. Just now, he too had noticed the thick murderous intent in Yang Kai’s eyes. Anyone who was sneak-attacked and almost lost his life would probably be blinded by rage.

Not everyone could suppress such wild anger and adapt to circumstances so quickly.

The fact that Yang Kai could stifle his emotions and choose the optimal solution in this situation showed his incredible mental fortitude.

This was the wisest and only choice available to him here. If Yang Kai let his anger rule him at this moment, it would be tantamount to trying to break a stone with an egg. Only he would suffer in the end.
