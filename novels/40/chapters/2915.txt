The Spirit Array that Gong Yue was trying to arrange was precisely the Six Points One Centre Array; only, nobody knew it until Yang Kai said it. The jade slips that Gong Yue passed them only contained the method to arrange their part of the array and not much detail on what everyone else was meant to do. They only had to follow these instructions and work together with the others, making it less complicated.

Everyone believed that the jade slip that Yang Kai received should be the same as well.

Then the question arose, how did he know about the name ‘Six Points One Centre Array’? And, from his words, the Spirit Array required the assistance of a full six people in order to complete. Even one less would not work.

Everyone then turned their heads to Gong Yue, only to see him with a deep frown on his brows, as if he were extremely surprised.

“Brother Yang is also proficient in the Dao of Spirit Arrays?” Fang Zhuo observed Yang Kai with great interest, thinking that this guy really hid well. He himself had some knowledge in Spirit Arrays; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been invited by Wu Kuang Yi. If Gong Yue was not here, then he would’ve been the one with the most profound attainments in the Dao of Spirit Arrays and they may have had to rely on his ability in order to crack the ancient seal.

But even he knew nothing about this so-called Six Points One Centre Array. This Spirit Array was clearly an extremely rare and profound Spirit Array, but he didn’t think that Yang Jiu would be able to see through it at a glance, which he was secretly in admiration of.

But to his surprise, Yang Kai actually shook his head, “I don’t know anything about the Dao of Spirit Arrays. I just happen to know about this Six Points One Centre Array, that’s all.”

There was only one Spirit Array that he was proficient with, and that was the Space Array! And even that was all thanks to Yang Yan’s careful teaching and his own talent in the Dao of Space. If not for these two factors, Yang Kai would really know nothing about arranging or cracking Spirit Arrays.

But Fang Zhuo did not say anything else after that, assuming that Yang Kai was just being modest. It was clearly impossible for someone like Yang Kai, who even knew about such an obscure Spirit Array, to not know anything about this Dao.

“I’m right, aren’t I, ‘Old Patriarch Gong’?” Yang Kai cocked his head to the side and stared at Gong Yue.

Gong Yue’s smile did not return, but he still nodded in acknowledgement, “That’s right. The Spirit Array that this Old Master intends to arrange is indeed the Six Points One Centre Array.”

Even though they’d guessed it from the start, everyone was still shocked when they heard Gong Yue admit it with his own mouth.

“But what does this have to do with this Old Master’s identity?” Gong Yue asked, “This Old Master is still this Old Master. Little Brother, have you made a mistake?”

Chen Bing Ru nodded, “That’s right. Little Brother Yang, what does the Six Points One Centre Array have to do with Old Patriarch Gong’s identity? Even though this Mistress does not know much about Spirit Arrays, this Six Points One Centre Array must be very profound according to what is recorded in these jade slips. Old Patriarch Gong even explained it to us simply and clearly, so that someone like this Mistress can learn it easily. This isn’t something that just anyone can achieve.”

Yang Kai frowned slightly and was silent for a moment, “Fine, let’s say that there’s nothing wrong with Old Patriarch Gong’s identity, that’s not the main problem.”

“What is, then?” Wu Kuang Yi asked. He had been getting a little impatient, but Yang Kai’s seriousness made him realize that there was more to this issue than meets the eye and he also needed answers for his own safety.

“The Six Points One Centre Array itself is the issue…” Yang Kai was speaking to the others, but his eyes remained fixed on Gong Yue the whole time, “Everyone has already seen the contents of the jade slips, so you should have some understanding of the principles and structure of this array. I must inform everyone that this Six Points One Centre Array, once arranged and activated, will allow six people to become six poles, while a seventh individual will serve as the core of the Spirit Array. As for who this core will be, obviously, Old Patriarch Gong must assume that role. However, the longer the Spirit Array is maintained, the stronger the control he will gain over us six, and once it reaches a certain limit, he will be able to freely control us, including whether we live or die. Regardless of how strong we are, we won’t be able to free ourselves from his bindings then.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the faces of everyone changed dramatically and they all turned their eyes towards Gong Yue.

If what Yang Kai said was true, then Gong Yue’s move was indeed questionable. He would actually gain control of everyone here after the Six Points One Centre Array was arranged, which they found to be simply unacceptable.

Under everyone’s sharp gaze, Gong Yue still responded calmly, “That is why this Old Master said earlier that everyone must trust me unconditionally! Only then can we combine all our strengths and crack this Spirit Array.”

Yang Kai grunted, “It’s not the Six Points One Centre Array that’s going to break the array, but rather another method… you want us to become blood sacrifices, right?”

“Blood sacrifices?” Wu Kuang Yi jumped in surprise. Even though he was just hearing Yang Kai speak, cold sweat was already pouring down his back.

Yang Kai smirked, “Brother Wu may not know, but while cracking this seal may seem outwardly complex, there is actually a much simpler method, and that is to offer it enough fresh blood. You didn’t try this method when you came here last time, did you?”

“Offering… fresh blood?” Wu Kuang Yi’s face paled, asking in trepidation, “How much blood?”

“Who knows? Maybe it’ll be enough after he bleeds us dry,” Yang Kai shrugged as if he was talking about something that had nothing to do with him.

Making a blood sacrifice was not the only way to break the array, but it was the simplest way, and not just any cultivator’s blood would do. The stronger the cultivator, the greater the effects. The blood of several Emperor Realm Masters should barely be enough.

Wu Kuang Yi turned his head to Gong Yue and asked in disbelief, “Old Patriarch Gong, is what he says true?”

Fang Zhuo and Chen Bing Ru also turned their questioning gazes to him. As for Hua Yu Lu, she naturally stood by Yang Kai’s side and believed him without a hint of doubt. She was also the only one here who knew about Yang Kai’s real identity, and as an Elder of Azure Sun Temple, she trusted that Yang Kai wouldn’t harm her or those of the Southern Territory. This was not because she understood Yang Kai, but because he now represented Azure Sun Temple.

It was only at this point that everyone understood why Yang Kai had doubts about Gong Yue’s identity.

Because if Gong Yue was truly the former Patriarch of the Gong Family, then there was no reason for him to act in such a deceitful and cruel manner. The Heavenly River Valley’s Gong Family’s golden signboard would be completely smashed if he were to do this.

They were all secretly relieved that this Yang Jiu knew so much about the Six Points One Centre Array. Otherwise, they may really have fallen into someone’s trap today, but on second thought, why did Yang Jiu know that a blood sacrifice was able to break the array? He said that he didn’t know anything about Spirit Arrays just now, but he was able to speak clearly and eloquently about this Six Points One Centre Array. His words were somewhat contradictory.

“So it turns out Little Brother Yang is a man of the same path. Forgive my disrespect.” Gong Yue smirked at Yang Kai. There was a trace of surprise in his eyes, but he was not panicked.

When Yang Kai saw that expression, he immediately had a bad feeling about it, as if he had missed something critical.

“Old Patriarch Gong… What he said… Is it all true?” Wu Kuang Yi’s eyes widened, “You really mean to use us as blood sacrifices to break the array?”

Gong Yue smiled, “Indeed, I do.”

After he said that, a noise suddenly emerged from Gong Yue’s body, as if something had been broken.

At the same time, Yang Kai’s face changed drastically as he finally realized what he had overlooked. Swiftly, he threw away the jade slip in his hands and was just about to warn the others, but he was too late.

With a crack, the jade slips in everyone’s hands burst, each of them turning into a stream of light that wrapped around each person.

Everyone in the room here was an Emperor Realm Master, so their reaction speed couldn’t be said to be slow. Each of them moved to counter the light the instant the jade slips burst, but unfortunately, Gong Yue’s actions were still faster.

He raised his hand and shot out two black lights that formed black curtains, one enveloping Wu Kuang Yi and the others, the other specifically targeting Yang Kai.

Yang Kai quickly stepped back to dodge, but found that the more he tried to retreat, the closer the black light got to him. Caught off guard, his vision went black for a moment before the scenery around him suddenly changed.

By the time he recovered, all Yang Kai could see around him was an endless ocean filled with loud crashing waves and a hot sun beaming down from above.

He had actually arrived above a vast sea, unable to distinguish left or right, north or south, up or down. All he saw was the tall sky and vast sea as he stood alone.

“Array Plate!” Yang Kai’s face suddenly turned dark.

This was an illusion, Yang Kai could be sure of that, and to be able to arrange such a large-scale illusion with such realistic effects, even Gong Yue would not be able to achieve such a thing in an instant. The only explanation was him using an Array Plate!

After an Illusion Array like this was imprinted into the Array Plate, the user needed only to summon it directly when they needed it. It was quick and convenient, with the only drawback being that it couldn’t be compared to arranging a real Illusion Array, making it far less powerful.

But the Illusion Array Plate that Gong Yue used was of a very high grade and could undoubtedly trap Yang Kai for a while, especially now that his Soul had not fully recovered, greatly reducing his strength.

But he believed that given enough time, he should be able to find this Illusion Array’s weak point.

The jade slips that had the information about the Six Points One Centre Array recorded on them were clearly Array Plates as well. Sure enough, Gong Yue was an old fox, having made preparations beforehand so that even if someone like Yang Kai uncovered his plot, he would still have the ability to subdue everyone in a flash.

Yang Kai was the only one who realized it early and threw out the jade slip, but he still could not avoid the fate of being trapped.

Now, Hua Yu Lu and the others must have fallen into Gong Yue’s Spirit Arrays, and as an Array Grandmaster and a Second-Order Emperor, Gong Yue could definitely release strength comparable to a Third-Order Emperor inside these Spirit Arrays.

In other words, even if Hua Yu Lu and the others joined forces, they may not be able to defeat him.

Yang Kai had to rush to their aid.

But obviously, he wouldn’t get that chance.

Suddenly, a figure appeared above the sea. Yang Tai appeared mysteriously and began staring down Yang Kai with a cold look on his face. His amiable image from before was nowhere to be seen as he glared at Yang Kai as if he was guilty of killing his father and stealing his wife, ruthless hatred filling his eyes.

“As I expected, you really are accomplices,” Yang Kai coldly snorted at Yang Tai when he saw him appear. At the same time, he was silently looking for a way to break out of this Illusion Array.

Yang Tai was the one who invited Gong Yue, and since Gong Yue was suspect, Yang Tai was naturally suspicious as well. When Yang Kai saw Yang Tai enter the illusion realm so simply just now, his previous doubts were immediately confirmed. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Accomplices?” Yang Tai sneered, “Think what you want. I was most wary of Fang Zhuo at first, but I didn’t think you’d be the one to spoil everything. It seems I’ve underestimated you.”

Yang Kai’s face was extremely dark as he thought for a moment before asking, “So that Gong Yue really is the Gong Family’s former Patriarch?”

Even though he doubted Gong Yue’s identity twice, he understood that he was wrong after he was trapped in this Illusion Array. Gong Yue was most likely exactly who he said he was as only someone from the Gong Family would be able to carry around so many Array Plates with them and be able to deploy such profound Illusion Arrays in an instant.
