Upon hearing that, Lu An burst into laughter, “How many more do you want to move?”

Yang Kai replied, “The more the better?”

Cha Hu waved his hand, “There’s no need for that. The Universe Worlds collected outside the Inner Sanctum are enough to keep everyone busy for some time. As long as they can fully extract those Universe Worlds, the resources would be enough for consumption in the Inner Sanctum for 1,000 years. Moreover, the further we go, the more likely we’ll come across the Black Ink Clan. Since we’ve taken some advantage, we should be satisfied with the win instead of potentially suffering losses.”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai nodded, “I’ll listen to you then, Division Commander Cha.”

Lu An said, “You’ve been working hard these past two years, so it’s time you got some rest. I suppose you haven’t had time to cultivate since you ascended to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Although I haven’t had time to cultivate, the living beings in my Small Universe help increase my heritage at all times, so there’s no risk of my foundation weakening or destabilising.”

Upon hearing that, Lu An nodded, “I’d forgotten about that.”

“Sirs, there’s one more thing I need to tell you.”

“What is it?”

“When I was moving the Universe Worlds, I inadvertently passed by an area in the void and felt some Space Principle fluctuations.”

Lu An was startled for a moment, “Space Principle fluctuations?”

Cha Hu soon realised something, “You mean, that might be a portal to a Sealed World?”

Yang Kai nodded, “In fact, I’m certain that it’s a portal to a Sealed World. However, since I was busy moving Universe Worlds, I didn’t have time to look into it. Now that we’re done with moving the Universe Worlds, I would like to investigate. Perhaps we’ll find some Profound Yin Spirit Fruits there.”

Profound Yin Spirit Fruits were extremely precious to all the Humans in the Great Passes. Yang Kai recalled the list of resources that could be traded for in the War Materials Hall, and the number one resource on the list was Profound Yin Spirit Fruits.

This made sense as in every Great Pass, there were a lot of Human soldiers that had been invaded by Black Ink Strength before and had no choice but to give up a part of their Small Universe, making it incomplete.

This kind of incompleteness could only be repaired by consuming a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit; therefore, the Spirits Fruits were extremely precious to every Great Pass, and they were out of stock most of the time.

On the other hand, only in the Sealed Worlds on the Black Ink Battlefield could Profound Yin Spirit Fruits be found.

Cha Hu’s eyes instantly brightened, “Do you remember where it was?”

Yang Kai replied, “I’ve left a mark on the Universe Chart.”

“Good. This King will call the roll and go with you,” Upon finishing his words, Cha Hu immediately got prepared.

A moment later, more than 100 people gathered together on Dawning Light as Cha Hu took charge of everything. On the other hand, Lu An stayed in the forward base; after all, there was a Purifying Black Ink Battleship here, so an Eighth-Order Master had to personally guard it.

Including the members of Dawn, there were currently more than 100 people on the Warship. In other words, there were about seven or eight Squads worth of people.

The Squad Leaders of these Squads came over and passionately greeted Yang Kai as they engaged in small talk. All of these people had fought alongside Dawn in the previous battle for the resource harvesting area. Even though he wasn’t familiar with all of them, Yang Kai could recognise them, and after some introductions, they could be considered friends.

After they were done with the small talk, Yang Kai took the initiative to approach Cha Hu and asked in puzzlement, “Sir, why have you brought so many people along?”

Although he could confirm that the location where there were fluctuations of Space Principles was a portal to a Sealed World, it was just one Sealed World. He initially intended to lead the members of Dawn to explore it and just bring out the good stuff.

However, he had never expected that Cha Hu would bring seven or eight more Squads with him, and Cha Hu himself would take charge of this mission.

Even if they were wary of the Black Ink Clan, it wasn’t necessary to bring so many people with them. Moreover, no Black Ink Clansmen would move around this area now as all the Universe Worlds had been sent to the periphery of Blue Sky Pass. Since there were no benefits to be gained around here, why would any Black Ink Clansmen come over just to get killed?

Without directly answering his question, Cha Hu asked, “How much do you know about the Sealed Worlds on the Black Ink Battlefield?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “I know little about them. I’m only aware that there might be Profound Yin Spirit Fruits and other rare Spirit Herbs in some of the Sealed Worlds.”

Cultivation resources could be extracted from the dead Universe Worlds on the Black Ink Battlefield; however, Spirit Herbs needed for Alchemy had to be sent from the 3,000 Worlds or found in those Sealed Worlds.

Therefore, in comparison, Spirit Pills were even rarer than normal cultivation resources on the Black Ink Battlefield. That was because there were only a limited number of methods that they could get the ingredients needed for refining them.

Yang Kai knew little about the Sealed Worlds on the Black Ink Battlefield. When he passed through the Void Corridor in Black Territory and arrived at the Black Ink Battlefield, he directly appeared in a Sealed World, but that was his only experience in this matter.

However, he had to keep himself safe at that time, so he didn’t have time to explore it.

Cha Hu nodded, “There’s one thing that’s special about the Sealed Worlds on the Black Ink Battlefield. It’s that they are clustered.”

Yang Kai arched his brow, “They’re clustered?”

“Have you ever picked mushrooms before?”

A puzzled Yang Kai shook his head, not knowing why this would be mentioned all of a sudden.

Cha Hu grinned, “When I was young, I would always go to the back hills of Crape-Myrtle Heaven during the rainy season. That was when the mushrooms would sprout. My Senior Sister and I would bring our baskets and pick them up. Since I was younger, I’d be responsible for looking for mushrooms while my Senior Sister would pick them. Whenever I found a mushroom, my Senior Sister would always find even more mushrooms in a nearby place. At that time, I thought that she was amazing because she could always find more mushrooms than I did.”

There was a longing and gentle expression on this Division Commander’s face, so Yang Kai reckoned that the Senior Sister must be a demure woman.

He spurted out, “Where’s your Senior Sister now?”

The light in Cha Hu’s eyes went out, “She was killed on the battlefield.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Despite his calmness, it must have been the biggest regret in his life.

Yang Kai apologised for that.

Cha Hu waved his hand, “What I mean is that the Sealed Worlds on the Black Ink Battlefield are like mushrooms. Since you’ve found a portal to a Sealed World, there are probably more nearby. This is what I meant when I said they’re clustered.”

Yang Kai was astounded, “Why is that?”

Instead of directly answering his question, Cha Hu asked, “Have you ever thought about how the Sealed Worlds on the Black Ink Battlefield were formed?”

Yang Kai nodded, “I’ve thought about it before, but I’ve never mulled over it. Even though I have a speculation, I’m unable to verify it.”

“Oh?” Cha Hu was surprised, “What’s your speculation?”

After giving it a thought, Yang Kai replied, “When I found out about the Sealed Worlds, I initially thought that they were a unique feature of the Black Ink Battlefield; however, I soon realised that these Sealed Worlds wouldn’t exist for no reason. The Black Ink Clan lives on World Force. Since all the Universe Worlds on the Black Ink Battlefield are dead, why are these unique Sealed Worlds still existent? Then, when I was searching for the Universe Cave Heavens and Universe Paradises left behind by our Seniors, it suddenly dawned on me that perhaps those Sealed Worlds are also a kind of Universe Paradise and Universe Cave Heaven.”

Cha Hu gazed at him with surprise, “I didn’t expect that you’d thought about this aspect.”

Yang Kai was shocked, “Is my speculation correct?”

“I cannot say for certain; however, our Seniors have studied the Sealed Worlds on the Black Ink Battlefield for many years, and their conclusion is more or less similar to yours. Fundamentally, the Sealed Worlds are also Universe Paradises and Universe Cave Heavens; nevertheless, they’ve been in existence for far too long as they were left behind in ancient times. Perhaps the way Humans cultivated was different back then, so the Sealed Worlds that were left behind are different from the current Universe Paradises and Universe Cave Heavens.”

With a solemn expression, Yang Kai said, “In that case, there were Humans who fought against the Black Ink Clan in this place in ancient times.”

Cha Hu nodded, “Yes, we’ve only inherited the will of the ancients. After the ancients battled against the Black Ink Clansmen and were killed, the Sealed Worlds were born.”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai nodded, “I understand. Most of the time, the ancients would pass away in groups, so the Sealed Worlds they left behind would be clustered, just like what we see outside of Blue Sky Pass.”

“Exactly,” Cha Hu nodded, “However, we can’t be certain about it. Perhaps the Sealed World you’ve found is the only one there. We’ll only find out after taking a look, but there’s no harm in bringing more people with us just in case.”

Yang Kai nodded with a heavy heart.

It wasn’t because of the number of Sealed Worlds; it was because of his speculations about the Sealed Worlds. If his speculations were right, it would mean that there were already Humans fighting the Black Ink Clan on the Black Ink Battlefield in ancient times. The situation was still the same these days, so when would the war ever end? When would those living in the 3,000 Worlds be free from this constant threat?

If his speculations were right, the ancients back then certainly had to give up parts of their Small Universes so that they would be spared from getting invaded by Black Ink Strength. Therefore, they found Profound Yin Spirit Fruits and even planted these fruit trees inside their Small Universes so that they could consume the fruits at any time.

Their efforts yielded wonderful results for the descendants. That was the reason Humans could now find Profound Yin Spirit Fruits in those Sealed Worlds.

It would take them one day to go from the forward base to the location where Yang Kai had felt the Space Principle fluctuations. Previously, he was busy moving Universe Worlds, so even though he had found a portal, he didn’t have time to deal with it. He only memorised the location so that he could explore it later.

At that time, he also didn’t inspect the surroundings.

One day later, Dawning Light stopped in a particular place in the void. After sensing his surroundings, Yang Kai pointed in a particular direction, “Over there, Sir.”

Cha Hu looked in the same direction and tried to investigate; however, he was unable to detect anything. He reckoned that the Space Principle Fluctuations must be extremely weak. That was the reason he was unable to sense it despite being an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

On the other hand, Yang Kai was a master of the Dao of Space, so he could find these faint traces.

With that said, if these portals could be found so easily, they would have fallen into the hands of the Black Ink Clan long ago, leaving nothing behind for the Humans.

It had to be noted that the Black Ink Clan had occupied this area for far longer than the Humans had.

Cha Hu said, “This King will stand guard for you all, so you can make a move with peace of mind.”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai took a step forward.
