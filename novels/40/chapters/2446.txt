“I’m not interested in what you are called! Don’t try to get close to me!” Lan He stated with a cold face.

She had a very bad impression of Yang Kai; after all, she was robbed not once but twice by him. It would be strange to have a good impression of him. As such, she didn’t want to even converse with Yang Kai, afraid that he would really take advantage of her and snatch more of her precious treasures. What’s more, judging by how he was hiding his face and only showing his tail, he must have provoked some powerful enemies and was afraid of exposing himself. The only reason she could be approaching her was to drag her down into the mud with him.

Lan He naturally wanted to stay as far away from someone like him as possible.

Yang Kai grinned and stated, “Fate brought us together, Sister Lan He, why are you being so cold?”

“Who was brought together by fate? Scram!” Lan He, seeing Yang Kai prattling on and on, couldn’t help but curse him.

“En, en!” Yang Kai perfunctorily replied, apologizing for pestering her in his heart but still insisting on standing next to her and quietly watching the situation.

Although Lan He had a temper, she was still a good person. Yang Kai had robbed her twice, yet she did not try to rob him, nor did she make unreasonable demands.

Had it been some other cultivator, it was quite possible that they would have tried fighting Yang Kai to snatch back those treasures.

There were only so many free Star Seals here, but there were dozens of cultivators who had rushed over, attracted by the commotion here, so these Star Seals were quickly divided up.

Yang Kai noticed that Yin Le Sheng, after snatching a Star Seal, landed about two thousand metres away from him. Next to Yin Le Sheng stood three other Netherworld Sect disciples, their auras all dark and cold. Obviously, they were cultivating Netherworld Sect’s unique Secret Arts.

No one was in their vicinity, probably because of the uncomfortable feelings caused by their gloomy auras.

When Yang Kai was secretly observing Yin Le Sheng, the latter actually sensed it and turned his head to stare straight towards Yang Kai’s location, a cold gleam flashing past his eyes.

Yang Kai looked away in a natural manner, as if he was just looking around, but in his heart, he was slightly startled.

When he first met Yin Le Sheng in the Starlight Corridor, Yang Kai came to know that he was the strongest cultivator in the Grand Desolation Star Field. Not only was he a Star Master, but his aptitude was also extraordinary. The second time he saw Yin Le Sheng, he had already soared up into the sky, his speed of cultivation no worse than that of Yang Kai’s.

He had suffered a huge loss in the Starlight Corridor, and hated Yang Kai to the bone, so if Xiao Xiao really fell into his hand, Xiao Xiao would certainly be mistreated. As such, Yang Kai needed to find out about Xiao Xiao’s whereabouts from Yin Le Sheng as soon as possible.

While Yang Kai was lost in his thoughts, whispers sounded around him.

The cultivators gathered here all pointed at the bell-shaped mountain, guessing the origin of this Emperor Artifact. Unfortunately, tens of thousands of years had passed since the battle in the Shattered Star Sea, so how could the youths of the current era have much knowledge about such remote history? As a result, nobody had any idea what this artifact was or who left it behind.

Yang Kai looked around, but unfortunately, he didn’t find any acquaintances. None of the elites of the Southern Territory were here. Who knows where else they went.

The Shattered Star Sea was vast and filled with countless opportunities, but only tens of thousands of cultivators could enter it at any one time. Such numbers were like a drop of water in an ocean, so it was quite normal to not meet the elites of the Southern Territory.

“Brother Qi Hai, you are the one with the most profound and immense knowledge here. Surely you are knowledgeable about past and present events. If you can, please tell us about this Emperor Artifact.” Suddenly, someone’s voice echoed loudly.

Everyone immediately looked toward him after hearing this.

There was a smile on this man’s face as he was quietly looking at another nearby man, who was dressed as a scholar.

Following his gaze, everyone focused their gazes on this scholarly man.

The scholarly man had a gloomy look on his face. Obviously, he didn’t want to be the focus of everyone’s attention. Furthermore, even if he knew about the Emperor Artifact, he wasn’t willing to share.

But the person who had spoken before deliberately spoke in a loud voice, causing everyone to look at him with expectations. If he didn’t speak now, he would undoubtedly hide his knowledge, but he might offend everyone present. With so many Masters staring at him, he had to speak even if didn’t want to.

Everyone who could come here was a worldly character and could tell that the relationship between the scholar and the speaker wasn’t very good. If they were really friends, the former speaker would not have embarrassed this scholar to this extent.

However, even if everyone knew this, no one blamed the speaker. Instead, everyone eagerly looked at the scholar, wanting to hear his answer.

In front of everyone’s eyes, the scholar could only bitterly glare at the former speaker before indifferently speaking, “You say I have deep and profound knowledge about both past and present events? That’s hardly true. This Qi has only read some ancient books in his idle time, that’s all. I don’t dare accept your praise.”

That man smiled and continued, “Brother Qi Hai, you are too modest. Compared to Brother Qi Hai, this one’s knowledge is simply like the glow of a firefly before a bright moon. Brother Qi Hai, please give us some advice!”

As soon as that man said this, a grim-faced brute suddenly added, “What’s the origin of the Emperor Artifact? Why is it so powerful?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Yes yes, Brother Qi, if you know something, you might as well tell everyone. We are very curious.”

“Tell us about it!”

Qi Hai took a breath. He was riding a tiger now, so he straightened up his thoughts before speaking, “The Shattered Star Sea was the battlefield of Great Emperors. I think you all know this.”

Most of the cultivators gently nodded.

“Back then, although Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s cultivation was peerless, and no one in the Star Boundary was his opponent, because he persisted in killing wantonly with no regard for others, he eventually provoked public anger. Numerous Great Emperors joined forces to fight him here. Finally, their fight shattered this Star Field, leading to the formation of the Shattered Star Sea. In that battle, rumour has it that Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was jointly killed by a few Great Emperors, but the price they paid was extremely heavy. The Masters who participated in the encirclement of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor suffered heavy injuries if not death; no one came out unscathed. It is said that the Heaven’s Revelations Great Emperor is still healing in the Heaven’s Revelation Valley and can’t come out because of his injuries!”

Everyone gasped in shock after hearing this.

Yang Kai was also shocked. He didn’t know whether Qi Hai was speaking the truth or not, but he had indeed heard of Heaven’s Revelations Great Emperor. He was one of the current ten Great Emperors.

This Great Emperor was a very special one even among the other ten because, rumour had it, he could spy on the secrets of the Heavens, catching glimpses of both the past and the future.

Before the opening of the Four Seasons Realm, Heavens Revelations Great Emperor had also sent a message to Azure Sun Temple, informing the entire Southern Territory that Star Seals would appear.

If what Qi Hai said was true, it had taken Heavens Revelations Great Emperor tens of thousands of years to heal from his injuries. It was hard to imagine how badly he had suffered during the encirclement of Heaven Devouring Great Emperor.

Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was really an astonishing character.

“It is said that a total of four Great Emperors died in that battle!” Qi Hai continued with a solemn expression.

“Four!?” Someone asked nervously.

Qi Hai continued with emphasis, “Cyan Lotus Great Emperor, Yuan Ding Great Emperor, Azure Sea Great Emperor, and Martial Flame Great Emperor!”

No one had ever heard of what he was narrating, so they listened with rapt attention. The same was true for Yang Kai. He had heard of Cyan Lotus Great Emperor a few days ago when Sister Hua had spoken of this Great Emperor. She said that someone had obtained Cyan Lotus Great Emperor’s Indestructible Cyan Lotus in the Shattered Star Sea five thousand years ago, going on to found Cyan Lotus Palace in the Eastern Territory, which was now a top Sect.

“These four Great Emperors fell here, and their Natal Emperor Artifacts and Space Rings, as well as many other treasures and even inheritances were scattered throughout the Shattered Star Sea, including the Indestructible Cyan Lotus of Cyan Lotus Great Emperor, the Mountains and Rivers Bell of Yuan Ding Great Emperor, the Inverse Azure Sea of Azure Sea Great Emperor, and the Phoenix True Fire of Martial Flame Great Emperor. All of these are unparalleled artifacts,” having spoken all this in one breath, Qi Hai slightly paused before continuing. “The Indestructible Cyan Lotus has been obtained already. Everyone should have heard of the Eastern Territory’s Cyan Lotus Palace. The Palace Master of Cyan Lotus Palace is the current owner of the Indestructible Cyan Lotus. But the artifacts of the other three Great Emperors haven’t been found.”

Having spoken until here, he turned his gaze towards the bell-shaped mountain and spoke in a solemn tone, “The Emperor Artifact in front of us now should be the Mountain and Rivers Bell of Yuan Ding Great Emperor. The toll of the Mountains and Rivers Bell can suppress worlds and invert the Heavens!”

*Gudong…*

Sounds of gulping nervously were heard everywhere as everyone’s gaze turned fiery hot.

“What evidence do you have?” Suddenly, someone expressed his doubt.

Yang Kai turned his head and looked toward the source of the voice. It was none other than Yin Le Sheng. Although he looked excited, he suppressed it well. Instead, he looked at Qi Hai vigilantly and asked, “You say that this is the Mountains and Rivers Bell of Yuan Ding Great Emperor, but what proof do you offer?”

Qi Hai sneered and rebuked, “I said it is, then that’s it. Believe what you want!”

Qi Hai was already extremely upset after being forced to reveal such top-secret information in front of so many people. Now he was still being questioned, so he felt like his hot face was put on someone’s cold ass, leading his tone to become cold all of a sudden.

“Since Brother Qi Hai has said so, then we believe it. Since some people doubt this and don’t have the ability to prove otherwise, Brother Qi Hai doesn’t need to pay attention to him!” A handsome young man gave a friendly smile to Qi Hai before reprimanding Yin Le Sheng.

Yin Le Sheng’s eyes turned cold and he fixed his glare on the young man who just spoke as if he was looking at a dead person. Obviously, he was memorizing his face.

The young man was completely oblivious to this, however, and still smiled and asked Qi Hai, “Brother Qi Hai, since this is Yuan Ding Great Emperor’s Mountains and Rivers Bell, how should we collect it? I ask Brother Qi Hai to give us his valuable advice!”

When everyone heard this, they all gazed at Qi Hai attentively.

Qi Hai coldly snorted and rebuked, “If I knew how to collect it, would I still be talking to you here?”

The young man was stunned after hearing this. Even though he knew that it was a stupid question, he still had some hope.
