“Boy, your courage is commendable but ultimately useless. Repent for your sins in the netherworld, and if you are fortunate enough to have a next life, learn well that toads may not eat swan meat! There are some people you cannot afford to seek friendship with!” Ran Yun Ting madly urged her Shi as she shouted.

Her understanding of the Martial Dao and Heavenly Way was infused into each of these tiny crystal snowflakes and her Shi had already reached the grand accomplishment stage, only one step away from reaching Domain, making her all but invincible among Origin Realm masters.

Yang Kai’s body was swiftly covered with snowflakes.

His aura then suddenly fell, and at a speed visible to the naked eye, frost spread across his exposed skin, freezing it in an instant...

More snowflakes gathered towards Yang Kai.

It seemed that all the icy cold in the surrounding worlds was pouring into Yang Kai’s body.

After a mere two breaths, Yang Kai was frozen into an ice sculpture, still maintaining the posture of punching out, his eyes furious, standing mid-air as even his black hair swept backwards motionlessly.

He was like a work of art crafted by a Grandmaster.

A few kilometres away, Qing Ya, who had just managed to regain her balance, raised her head and after seeing this scene, panicked, and suddenly called out in alarm, “Yang Kai!”

Her voice was full of sadness.

[Yang Kai had lost to the Great Elder! Was their strength too far apart? But if he were to die here, what would happen to Su Yan...]

Qing Ya hardly dared to think about it anymore, and for a moment, she froze in place, her thoughts descending into chaos.

At this moment, she felt she would rather have been killed by Bing Die just now rather than witness Yang Kai fall here because of her.

“Kill this traitor!” Ran Yun Ting looked at Qing Ya from a distance and indifferently gave orders to Bing Die, her eyes filled with disgust.

After issuing this decree, she turned away from Qing Ya in disdain.

It seemed, to her, Qing Ya’s life or death was of no importance at all! As long as she could make up for the flaws in Su Yan’s state of mind, she was willing to kill anyone even remotely related to her.

Bing Die had been injured by Yang Kai just now, but it was nothing serious so after quickly adjusting her breathing, she rushed towards Qing Ya without hesitation. Her eyes were cold as her Saint Qi surged and an icy aura pulsed from the figure as she stared at Qing Ya with extreme indifference, “Let’s see who will save you this time!”

As she spoke, she arrived a dozen meters in front of Qing Ya and sent out a palm.

Qing Ya didn’t move as she wasn’t even paying any attention to Bing Die’s attack, just staring blankly towards the frozen Yang Kai, as if it was the only thing she was able to see.

Her eyes were filled with sorrow and misery.

She had given up completely. Since Yang Kai had died at the hands of Great Elder, Qing Ya no longer dared to face Su Yan ever again. Perhaps it would not be so bad dying her together with Yang Kai, as on the road to the Yellow Springs, at least he would have good company.

Facing Bing Die’s killing blow, Qing Ya slowly closed her eyes, preparing herself for death.

Bing Die did not stop just because she had given up resisting. To her, the Great Elder’s orders were absolute.

The Ice Heart Valley disciples watching all exclaimed, none of them thinking that, after so many twists and turns, this situation would still end in the death of Qing Ya and that man.

Many people wore dispirited and regretful looks.

Suddenly, from the ice and snow below, a small head appeared in front of Qing Ya. This small head was sharp and angular, like it was carved from stone, but the two black, bean-like eyeballs on it were extremely energetic and flickered with intelligence.

Immediately, this little head popped out of the ground, like a radish being plucked from the earth, revealing its entire figure.

Now, in front of Qing Ya, there was a strange creature less than a meter tall.

This creature had no aura, something all living creatures should possess, but from its flexible movements and smart eyes, it clearly had its own wisdom and spirituality.

It was like a small stone puppet!

“This is...” Bing Die frowned as she stared suspiciously at the Stone Puppet that suddenly appeared in front of Qing Ya, her head unable to catch up with this sudden change.

Then, she saw an incredible scene.

This tiny stone puppet jumped out to block her path to Qing Ya and swung its slightly gangly arm, clenching a fist that it used to meet Bing Die’s attack.

There were still no energy fluctuations from this fist, but when the stone puppet punched out, Bing Die’s own condensed Ice Attribute palm shattered.

In the next instant, a force that was so intense that it caused Bing Die to feel desperate surged towards her!

Overwhelming power shatters all! Only when the difference in power was massive could all attributes be ignored and destroyed!

Bing Die was shocked!

With a horrible cry, she flew out again, and this time her injuries were obviously heavier than when Yang Kai had acted just now. After falling to the ground, she immediately fell unconscious, her life or death uncertain.

Countless people also heard the clear sounds of her arm bones breaking.

*Si...*

Gasps sounded from all directions.

Bing Die was an Inner Island disciple and a member of the Law Enforcement Hall, a cultivator at the First-Order Origin Returning Realm.

So, what was this strange creature which had suddenly appeared in front of Qing Ya? With just a casual punch, it had actually beaten Bing Die into such a state.

Where did it even come from?

Even Qing Ya was at a loss! She lowered her head to look at the slightly hunched over Stone Puppet which was standing in front, a blank look filling her beautiful eyes.

“What is this thing!?” Standing in mid-air, Ran Yun Ting cast her gaze towards the Stone Puppet solemnly.

Although she could not feel any vitality or energy fluctuations from this creature, it still gave her a huge sense of crisis, one that she would only sense when facing an opponent she could not hope to match!

As her heart clenched, she subconsciously glanced over towards Yang Kai, who should have been frozen in ice.

With this glance, Ran Yun Ting nearly screamed.

Yang Kai, who she thought was destined to die, was staring towards her mockingly from inside the ice crystal.

“The solemn Great Elder of Ice Heart Valley is only on this level? Honestly, you are far too disappointing. If you only have such pitiful ability, Su Yan should stop cultivating under your guidance immediately. You’re simply not qualified to continue teaching her!” Yang Kai’s voice came from inside the ice crystal, causing Ran Yun Ting to feel like she was seeing a ghost, her expression changing dramatically.

Down below, the Stone Puppet’s two black eyes darted about slightly, then as if remembering something, he suddenly stretched out his hands and pounded his chest firmly.

*Dang Dang Dang Dang...*

A terrifying rumbling rang out, shaking all the nearby ice peaks and causing countless blocks of snow and ice to shatter and come crashing down.

As this noise echoed, the Stone Puppet’s body suddenly increased in size, going from less than a meter in height to over ten in an instant.

Xiao Xiao then turned around, grinned towards the floating Yang Kai, then picked up Qing Ya and ran away rapidly.

Atop the white snow, only a trail of strange afterimages remained, stretching off into the distance!

It was as if a mountain bandit had left his cave and captured the wife of the village chief and couldn’t wait to bring her back to his abode.

The disciples of Ice Heart Valley were all dumbfounded!

Junior Sister Qing Ya... was abducted by a stone man?

But soon, they understood why this stone man had chosen to leave in such a hurry.

A frightening aura suddenly spread out, and Yang Kai, who was supposed to be frozen into a statue, let out a shocking roar as the ice crystal around his body began making creaking, dense spiderweb-like cracks appearing on its surface.

The ice crystal was about to break!

Ran Yun Ting was shocked, and the disciples of Ice Heart Valley turned pale!

None of them dared to remain where they were and once again retreated, running much further away this time.

“Wishful thinking!” Ran Yun Ting snorted sharply as the field of crystal snowflakes appeared again and flew towards Yang Kai, obviously attempting to freeze him once more.

“Break!” Yang Kai burst out.

*Hualala...*

The ice crystal shattered and exploded into dust.

At the same time, Ran Yun Ting’s Shi shattered!

The flying snow all over the sky suddenly disappeared and was replaced by countless tiny Void Cracks. These Void Cracks were like tiny black snakes that flitted about three thousand meters around Yang Kai!

“How? How is this possible?” Ran Yun Ting stumbled back as she stared blankly towards the location of Yang Kai, completely unable to accept this result.

In a face-to-face confrontation of their Shi, she had been defeated! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

She was Ice Heart Valley’s Great Elder, and her Shi had reached the grand accomplishment stage! How could this young man completely surpass her achievements in this field?

Moreover, his Shi contained a very strange power.

Not only did it create countless Void Cracks that were emitting rich murderous intent, but even her sense of distance inside this Shi had become distorted. She was unable to even locate Yang Kai! Yang Kai’s position seemed suddenly far yet also incredibly near, as if his position was constantly shifting.

[Space Force!] Ran Yun Ting’s face suddenly paled.

Only Space Force could form so many Void Cracks, and only Space Force could influence her perception of distance.

This young man had cultivated such an esoteric power? And he had managed to integrate it into his Shi?

Ran Yun Ting really was astonished this time!

“Die!” Yang Kai’s cold voice sounded, not showing any mercy despite knowing she was Su Yan’s Honoured Master. With a single thought, space suddenly seemed to solidify, and the countless Void Cracks flew towards Rang Yun Ting.

“You want my life? You must have the ability to take it first!” Ran Yun Ting screamed hysterically, no longer displaying any of the majesty a Great Elder should have, taking out a token from her Space Ring and pouring her Saint Qi into it as she shrieked.

In the next moment, an extraordinary change suddenly appeared in the surrounding space!

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed as he swept them around himself, instantly discovering that the air had become filled with a terrifying cold that was still rapidly intensifying. He also sensed a connection between the token in Ran Yun Ting’s hand and this building Ice Attribute Energy.

Beneath the ground, the highest quality Earth Vein of Pure Ice Island released a surge of World Energy that burst into the sky through numerous cracks in the earth and merged together with the surrounding space after which it was rapidly manipulated and transformed by the token Ran Yun Ting was using.

The frigid energy gathered like a roaming dragon and surrounding Ran Yun Ting, taking less than three breaths to force back Yang Kai’s Shi.
