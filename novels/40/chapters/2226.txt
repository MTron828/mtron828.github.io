This unexpected disaster made Xiao Bai Yi and the three feel both helpless and worried at the same time.

They had no idea how Yang Kai and Xia Sheng were, or whether they ended up in any fatal danger.

While the three of them were communicating silently, a stalwart figure suddenly appeared a short distance away. It was a majestic figure sporting flaming red hair, carrying a cultivator in his arms as he walked.

Xiao Bai Yi and the other two fixed their eyes in that direction and their faces could not help but change.

And that was because they realized that the person being carried was Xia Sheng, and the guy who caught him was probably the Lian Yan that they heard of before.

Facing an Emperor Realm Master, despite Xia Sheng’s strength being extraordinary for his realm, he was obviously unable to escape and had wound up caught.

From his appearance and current state, he had undoubtedly resisted a lot earlier and he seemed to have suffered a lot of injuries.

There, Lian Yan carried Xia Sheng over, tossed him directly into the crowd, and told his subordinate to keep an eye on them before walking straight towards Zhou Dian, standing behind him and waiting silently.

Murong Xiao Xiao and the others wanted to ask Xia Sheng about his condition, but when they saw Xia Sheng slowly shaking his head at them, they quickly stopped.

It would be better for them not to reveal that they knew each other at this moment. If they concealed this, then they may be able to take advantage of that when the enemy was unprepared to do something...

The fresh breeze was pleasant, but Lian Yan, who was standing behind Zhou Dian, was filled with tension and worry.

And the reason for that was because he could feel the nearly tangible fighting intent flowing out from Zhou Dian’s body. Naturally, this was a Master’s instinctive thirst for battle.

Lian Yan knew what Zhou Dian was thirsting for...

Since the creation of this Divine Country, the entire world had been unified and wars had ended. As a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, Zhou Dian had very few opponents.

And among those few, there was at least one here in Heavenly Monster Mountain.

Zhou Dian, whose desire for slaughter had been silent for two thousand years, had awakened again.

Lian Yan knew how terrifying Zhou Dian was at this moment, so as his subordinate, he did not dare to disturb him in the slightest, or the consequences would be unthinkable.

With time, his fighting intent also continued to rise.

Until a certain moment, that dense murderous intent suddenly retracted, no longer appearing in the slightest.

Lian Yan could not help but breathe a sigh of relief as he felt like he was about to fall over.

“How is the situation?” Zhou Dian asked without turning back. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Reporting to Sir, everything is mostly good,” Lian Yan bowed and responded.

“Mostly?” Zhou Dian turned his body and glanced over at Lian Yan from the corner of his eye.

This look and this tone of voice caused Lian Yan’s complexion to change in an instant, and he quickly cupped his fists, saying, “It is Ban Qing... We lost contact with him.”

Upon hearing this, Zhou Dian raised a brow and asked, “How did this happen?”

“Subordinate does not know,” Lian Yan showed a bewildered look. “Ban Qing had still been sending messages from time to time prior to this, but after a certain point, he suddenly disappeared. Perhaps he is currently pursuing someone powerful.”

Zhou Dian nodded and said, “Hm, Ban Qing’s concealment ability is unparalleled, so anyone who can make him so cautious is most likely an extraordinary character. Very well, this King has been resting for a long time, and since I was ordered by the Lord King himself, I may have to take a trip there myself!”

As he spoke, he urged the Nine Horned Dragon Beast beneath him and they marched towards the depths of Heavenly Monster Mountain.

“Sir!” Upon seeing this, Lian Yan shouted.

“What’s wrong?” Zhou Dian looked back at him with impatience.

Lian Yan said, “Further ahead will be reaching into the range of the Heavenly Monster Accord... If we invade that region, the Monster Race...”

“Why would this King fear the Monster Race?” Zhou Dian scoffed and mocked Lian Yan. “Lian Yan, you’ve lost your guts.”

Lian Yan’s face changed several times before he gritted his teeth and said, “Allow this subordinate to accompany Sir.”

Zhou Dian watched him deeply and nodded with satisfaction, “Good, keep up!”

After saying so, he continued moving forward. The Nine Horned Dragon Beast’s movements may seem very slow, but its speed was getting faster and faster and soon after, it had already turned into a stream of light, dashing ahead towards the horizon.

.....

Deep in the depths of Heavenly Monster Mountain, in Heavenly Monster Valley.

This was the core of Heavenly Monster Mountain, as well as the residence of Heavenly Monster Mountain’s Lord.

The architecture of this place adhered to the Monster Race’s rough and wild nature. All the buildings were big and showy, very different from how the houses in the human world were structured.

Outside the valley, a group of Blood Wolves at peak Eleventh-Order were on guard to prevent anyone from entering the valley.

Yuan Fei and Bai Lu were unhindered as they brought Yang Kai all the way here. After all, these two were well-known existences in Heavenly Monster Mountain, and as the subordinates of the Monster King, who would be blind enough to dare stop them?

On the other hand, many of the Masters of the Monster Race showed looks of curiosity and disgust towards Yang Kai whom they brought with them. They had come a long way, but each member of the Monster Race they encountered was glaring at Yang Kai, baring their fangs at him. If he did not follow the two Twelfth-Order Masters here, then he would likely have been torn to pieces.

Not long after, the group arrived at the centre of Heavenly Monster Valley.

A gigantic tree that grew up into the sky could be seen here. The roots of the gigantic tree were so wide that they could fill up several halls. Yang Kai looked up, but he couldn’t see the top of the tree at all as its canopy seemed to stretch dozens of kilometres in diameter.

Yang Kai could not help but feel surprised at this magnificent sight.

After arriving here, Yang Kai could clearly feel that the World Energy in the vicinity had grown much denser, sending a pleasing sensation through his Soul Avatar.

He understood immediately that this humongous tree was some kind of divine object.

And, a door could be seen somewhere on the roots of this giant tree. The wooden door was currently closed shut, and when they arrived here, Yuan Fei turned his head and said fiercely to Yang Kai, “Boy, wait here and don’t move unless you’re told, otherwise, don’t blame me if you lose your life!”

Yang Kai nodded his head quietly and calmly.

*Zhi zhi zhi...*

The Purple Squirrel called out to Yang Kai, probably trying to tell him something.

Yang Kai smiled and nodded, “Don’t worry about me, just take care of yourself.”

“Let’s go!” Bai Lu said as she reached out to open the door, walking into the tree cave.

In a few moments, Yang Kai was the only one left in place.

He looked up at the giant tree, eyes filled with wonder. The Monster Race around him gradually gathered as well, each with a fierce glint in their eyes, not bearing kind intentions.

In only ten breaths of time, Yang Kai was surrounded by three layers of Monster Race Masters and even on the tree branches overhead were occupied with those observing him.

Some of these Monster Race Masters had assumed human form, maintaining the appearance of a person, but some maintained their beast forms and pulsed ferocious intent from their bodies.

But no matter who it was, they only stared at Yang Kai and would only show obvious malice, none really tried to do anything to him.

No matter what, Yang Kai had been brought here by Yuan Fei and Bai Lu, so before these two Masters said so, the other monsters present wouldn’t dare move without permission.

The division of hierarchy was more obvious in the Monster Race than the Human Race, and the strong had absolute dominance over the weak, with only rare exceptions like the Purple Squirrel, who had an extremely powerful background.

The scene before him brought back some memories for Yang Kai.

He found that no matter where he went, there seemed to be an irreconcilable conflict between the Human Race and the Monster Race. Different races had different customs, and the fact that you were seen as an outsider if you were of a different race was commonplace everywhere.

Even though he was surrounded by countless Monster Race Masters though, Yang Kai still did not show the slightest sign of fear; however, the Soul Devouring Insects inside of his sleeve were clearly growing restless for some reason. They may be excited at how so many Masters with powerful Souls were nearby, so they were beginning to show signs of escaping Yang Kai’s control.

Noticing this, Yang Kai’s face paled as he hurriedly activated his Spiritual Energy to suppress them.

As soon as the Soul Devouring Insects began to riot, all the surrounding Monster Race Masters couldn’t help feeling a chill all over their bodies, as if they had fallen into an ice cellar. This feeling had come so inexplicably and yet so clearly that the Monster Race Masters were certain it was no illusion. The presence of something that posed a threat to their lives was truly present.

This discovery caused the faces of many Monster Race Masters to darken as they eyed Yang Kai vigilantly and suspiciously, as if trying to reassess him.

On the other hand, Yang Kai was trying his hardest to suppress the Soul Devouring Insects. He could not use the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus with so many eyes on him, so he couldn’t help but feel the need to groan.

It was at that moment that a surging pressure like a great ocean wave suddenly descended from the sky, enveloping Yang Kai.

This pressure came so abruptly that Yang Kai was suppressed on the spot before he could even react.

But soon, he found that this pressure did not hurt him while instead the Soul Devouring Insects were calmed.

The owner of that pressure seemed to have helped him intentionally.

[Peak Twelfth-Order!] Yang Kai was astonished.

Even though he had already guessed that the power of the Heavenly Monster Mountain’s Lord was not low, he was still shocked to learn the true level of this Master.

This Divine Ascension Mirror World was a bizarre realm where living beings had no physical bodies, only Souls; however, even without a physical body, a master of this level had appeared.

Yang Kai could not help but feel a little lost in thought, wondering if perhaps a Great Emperor level character had ever been born here?

If one had, then how much would they know about his situation?

And, just as these thoughts flashed through his mind, a silhouette appeared in front of him. It was Bai Lu.

Bai Lu’s beautiful eyes swept around the place before she said to Yang Kai, “Follow me. The Lord wants to see you.”

Bai Lu said nothing more and turned to lead the way.

Following behind her, Yang Kai entered the tree cave.

Only then did he realize that the interior of this tree cave was actually a completely furnished cave mansion.

The lowest floor seemed to be something akin to a large hall, but it was empty without a single Soul at this moment. And, in the corner of the hall, there was a spiral staircase that led up. Yang Kai had no idea how far up this staircase went, but at least from where he stood, he could not see its top.
