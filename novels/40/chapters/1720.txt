Just as Yang Kai merged his Space Force with his Shi, Su Yan was merging her comprehension of the Ice Attribute into her Shi. Obviously, she had grasped the initial concept and was integrating her understanding into her Shi.

Waiting quietly for a while, Yang Kai found that Su Yan did not show any intention to end her cultivation.

Yang Kai did not interfere with her, instead just sitting down cross-legged while stretching out his hand and drawing some lines in the air.

These lines were drawn using Yang Kai’s Saint Qi and were arranged into a certain formation that gradually formed a profound and mysterious circular pattern.

After working for a while, Yang Kai frowned slightly, stretched out his hand, brushed away the drawing, and began again from scratch.

The array was something he had learned from Yang Yan just now, and it was the basis for constructing a Space Array. This Spirit Array, coupled with some special materials, a Space Array could be constructed.

However, Yang Kai had never even dabbled in Spirit Arrays before.

Thankfully, he possessed an advantage no one else did, he was proficient in the Dao of Space, so now, his biggest problem was becoming proficient in depicting the Space Array itself. Fortunately, he had received careful guidance from Yang Yan, a Grandmaster in this particular field.

Time passed slowly, and Yang Kai completely forgot everything else around him, his expression becoming more and more focused.

Yang Kai lost track of how many arrays he portrayed, but eventually, he created one that he was satisfied with and began pouring his Space Force into it with a thought.

With a light hum, the circular array released a brilliant light and began to slowly revolve. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

An obvious trace of Space Force fluctuations began the pulse from the array as well!

Yang Kai grinned happily seeing this.

Sure enough, after mastering the Dao of Space, studying this kind of Spirit Array yielded twice the results with half the effort. If it had been some other kind of Spirit Array, even if Yang Kai studied diligently, he may not have been able to properly portray it in such a short time.

After mastering this foundation, what was left was to use the appropriate materials to build a physical platform into which he would engrave this Spirit Array in two separate locations, and he would have successfully created two Space Arrays that were connected to each other.

Yang Kai exhaled lightly in satisfaction.

“Is this a Space Array?” Su Yan’s voice suddenly came from the side.

Yang Kai looked up and found that she had at some point finished her cultivation and was now standing quietly beside him, staring at the shining, rotating circle in front of them as she asked softly.

“En,” Yang Kai nodded, stretched out his hand to pull Su Yan into his arms, and asked softly, “How is your cultivation?”

“Fortunately, I was able to cultivate my Shi to the grand accomplishment stage,” Su Yan leaned on Yang Kai with a satisfied look on her face, breathing lightly as she spoke, “It was all thanks to the Domain Stones Junior Brother gave me. Without them, it would have been impossible for me to make such rapid progress.”

“I have lots of Domain Stones left, so you don’t need to conserve them when you use them,” Yang Kai smiled softly, feeling relaxed both physically and mentally.

“En, coming to visit me so suddenly, is there something wrong?”

“No, it’s just been a long time since we’ve been together, so I came to see you,” Yang Kai smiled happily.

Su Yan nodded slightly before turning her gaze towards the clouds in the sky, her eyes narrowing slightly as she adjusted her soft body in Yang Kai’s arms to assume a more comfortable posture.

Yang Kai embraced her and did not speak again, simply staring up towards the Heavens together with her.

Under the giant silver tree, the snow gently fell as everything went quiet, the scene appearing quite poetic and picturesque.

In the distance, Qing Ya seemed to come to see Su Yan, but before she got close, she noticed the warm scene up ahead, smiled lightly, quietly turned around, and left.

.....

Half a month later, the Limitless Ocean, Sea Temple’s headquarters, Black Reef Island.

Black Reef Island was one of the three largest islands on the Limitless Ocean, and it possessed a rich World Energy aura, which was why Sea Temple had chosen to establish its headquarters here.

As the headquarters of a powerful Sect, it was naturally heavily guarded. Around the island, patrols of cultivators flew about while at its edges there were Sea Temple disciples constantly keeping watching.

Yang Kai flew over leisurely and landed on the outskirts of Black Reef Island.

Immediately, a group of Sea Temple disciples surrounded him, with their leader staring at him with an unkind look as he shouted, “Who goes there!? Report your name!”

Having just arrived here as a prospective guest, Yang Kai didn’t want to cause trouble, so he cupped his fists and said, “High Heaven Sect’s Sect Master Yang Kai. I’ve come to see Senior Sha about an agreement we previously made. Please inform Senior Sha of my arrival.”

“High Heaven Sect’s Sect Master?”

“Come to see Martial Ancestor Sha?”

The cultivators of this team immediately began whispering amongst themselves, with their leader giving Yang Kai a careful once over, as if trying to see if he was lying, even releasing his Divine Sense to try to probe him.

However, no matter how he tried, he was unable to grasp Yang Kai’s depths, this man was unable to detect anything and immediately understood that Yang Kai was a master far beyond him. Involuntarily putting on a serious look, after a moment of pondering, he replied, “Since you know that Martial Uncle Sha is here, it seems you are indeed familiar with him, but it has not been long since Martial Uncle Sha has returned to Sea Temple and he is quite busy, so whether you can see him or not will be up to him to decide.”

“That’s fine, I’ll wait here,” Yang Kai replied lightly.

The lead cultivator nodded before instructing the other cultivators on his patrol team to entertain Yang Kai while he took out a communication artifact and poured his Divine Sense into it.

A moment later, the communication artifact in the leader’s hand pulsed and after quickly checking it, the lead cultivator turned a strange expression to Yang Kai and said, “Please wait here for a moment, someone will come to see you.”

Yang Kai raised his brow slightly but still calmly nodded, “Good!”

He subconsciously felt that this trip might not go smoothly, and that the one coming to see him might not be Sha Hu!

After all, based on his friendship with Sha Hu, if the latter knew he had come, how could he make him wait here? Sha Hu would certainly have already ordered these people to welcome him warmly.

Inside Sea Temple, there seemed to be some turbulent undercurrents! Yang Kai thought to himself, but this had nothing to do with him. He was only here to complete the agreement he made with Sha Hu so he could begin trading inland materials for ocean materials. This was all for the future development of High Heaven Sect and was of great importance.

Things really proceeded as Yang Kai expected, and after waiting for less than a quarter of an hour, he noticed that a group of Origin Returning Realm masters flying over, but none of them was Sha Hu.

Soon, this group of people appeared in Yang Kai’s eyes.

The leader of this newly arrived group was a powerful cultivator at the peak of the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm. It was an old man with a dark tanned complexion. After lightly landing a dozen or so metres in front of Yang Kai, this old man swept his eyes over Yang Kai a few times before casually cupping his fists and saying, “Dare I ask, is Your Excellency really High Heaven Sect’s Sect Master?”

“Yes, I am. You are...” Yang Kai cupped his fists in return.

“This old master is Sea Temple’s Third Temple Master, Qi Yun Hai!” The old man said lightly.

“So it is Temple Master Qi!” Yang Kai raised his brows. Although he did not have many dealings with Sea Temple, he still knew that it had three Temple Masters. This Qi Yun Hai was obviously one of them.

“I heard that Sect Master Yang is here to see my Sea Temple’s Martial Uncle Sha?”

“Exactly, this Yang made an agreement with Senior Sha, is Senior Sha...”

“Martial Uncle has been missing for more than three hundred years and has only just returned to Sea Temple, so he is exhausted both physically and mentally and is currently recuperating. I am afraid he cannot see Sect Master Yang at this time,” Qi Yun Hai cut in and stated calmly. “Sect Master Yang is a guest from afar, so if you don’t mind, why not stay here and rest for a while? Although this old master lives here on the Limitless Ocean, he has still heard Sect Master Yang’s and High Heaven Sect’s resounding names but has unfortunately never had the chance to meet him. I hope Sect Master Yang can spare some time here at my Sea Temple.”

Although he spoke with enthusiasm, Qi Yun Hai’s tone was neither warm nor cold, so obviously he was just being perfunctory and not really inviting Yang Kai in to sit down.

Yang Kai looked back at Qi Yun Hai and said with a smile that was not quite a smile, “This is strange, when I separated from Old Sha half a month ago, he was hale and hearty, but now, he is suddenly exhausted both physically and mentally? I also had an agreement with him to meet at this time, so this Sect Master came to fulfil the said agreement. Dare I ask Temple Master Qi, is Old Sha not being able to meet with me his own intention?”

Qi Yun Hai’s cloudy eyes flashed and did not answer directly, instead asking in a threatening tone, “What is Sect Master Yang trying to imply?”

“Nothing,” Yang Kai snickered. “The agreement between me and Old Sha is not only of great benefit to my High Heaven Sect, but also of great benefit to your Sea Temple, but it seems that even with such benefits in front of you, your Sect wants to refuse. Since that is the case, this Sect Master has no need to accompany you any longer. On the Limitless Ocean, you are not the only great force!”

“You dare to collude with the Sea Clan?” Qi Yun Hai thought for a moment before his face changed drastically.

“Collude?” Yang Kai sneered, “Don’t try to tarnish this Sect Master’s reputation with your baseless rhetoric. Farewell!”

Yang Kai had a stomach full of grievances. Last time, on Sunrise Island, Pang Zhen had sent a message back to Sea Temple’s headquarters quickly, but Yang Kai had been forced to wait for many days without any kind of response. That was one thing, but now that he had come personally, Sea Temple still chose to shut him out, even sending the Third Temple Master forward to show Sea Temple’s intentions.

Since Sea Temple was unwilling to do business with High Heaven Sect, Yang Kai did not plan to beg them.

“You dare collude with the Sea Clan and still want to leave? Boy, if you don’t explain yourself clearly, don’t even dream of leaving Black Reef Island today!” A forceful voice boomed from nearby and a middle-aged man with an imposing appearance flew over and landed next to Qi Yun Ha while glaring at Yang Kai coldly.

Before Yang Kai could even say anything though, another voice boomed from inside Black Reef Island, “Bold! Yang Kai is this old master’s guest, who dares treat him impolitely?”

Hearing this voice, Yang Kai grinned and the unhappiness in his heart dissipated greatly; after all, he had not misread Sha Hu who had immediately come forward to defend him after noticing his arrival.

However, the situation right now was a bit more complicated than Yang Kai had anticipated.

Yang Kai had no intention to insert himself into other people’s affairs and simply stood waiting quietly, wanting to hear what Sha Hu had to say.

Soon, Sha Hu arrived and landed next to Yang Kai, a clear look of anger filling his face as he glared viciously at Qi Yun Hai and a middle-aged man.

Qi Yun Hai seemed to not dare meet eyes with Sha Hu and looked away, but the sturdy middle-aged man showed no fear and glared back at Sha Hu without flinching.
