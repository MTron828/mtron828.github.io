Yang Kai’s alertness shot up when the chill touched his neck and he reflexively pushed his Shaman Strength to resist it.

*Chi… *

The pointed stab of the sharp dagger scraped Yang Kai’s neck, spilling a string of fine blood.

The man behind the sneak attack was surprised by this outcome. Although he succeeded in the attack, and knew that the other party was injured, the wound was superficial. In other words, his sneak attack failed to achieve the desired results.

Just as he was stunned, Yang Kai immediately turned around to punch him.

Following a grunt, a figure about a metre tall suddenly appeared from the black fog, his eyes bulged and his chest caved in, slamming into the stone wall and spurting out blood.

After landing squarely on the ground, apparent fear was etched on the short Demon’s face, fear that only grew more obvious when he saw Yang Kai swinging his fist again. With a flicker, the small Demon turned into a black smoke and dodged the incoming assault.

Yang Kai frowned. Although he had fought against Sand Demons a few days ago, it was his first time facing this type of short Demon and he did not have time now to find a way to counter such a troublesome skill.

The black fog quickly retreated.

At the same time, a sharp cry sounded from behind, like an evil spirit’s screech.

Yang Kai’s Soul trembled at the sound and his head began to spin as a flurry of illusions flashed before his eyes.

[Soul Attack!] Yang Kai shook his head vigorously and pushed his Spiritual Energy wildly to eliminate the influence of the scream.

The sound of something slicing through the air rang out at that moment.

Yang Kai quickly raised his arm to the side, blocking a soft whip, made of unknown material, but that was not the end. Although the sudden attack was blocked, the soft whip miraculously wrapped itself around his hand, and the tip of the whip struck straight at his face.

Instantly, the tail of the whip head actually transformed into a large mouth filled with fangs. A bright green light flashed in its mouth as it snapped its jaw at Yang Kai, hissing.

It was not a whip, but a venomous snake!

Yang Kai quickly reached out his other hand and accurately caught the snake head before clenching his fist and crushing its head.

“Eh?” A voice of surprise came from behind. It seemed that the attacker was taken aback by Yang Kai’s quick reflex and his ability to resolve her hidden killing move. The next moment, a whiff of fragrance flew to Yang Kai’s side and transformed into a white light, shrouding him with countless palm shadows.

Yang Kai took a deep breath, stood firm, and responded with his own flurry of palms.

*Pa pa pa… *

The clash resulted in a rapid and continuous series of crackles. When the white light turned back and withdrew, both sides had already exchanged a hundred palm strikes. The surging force caused the surrounding sand and stones to tremble, and the cave seemed like it would collapse at any time.

Everything happened in an instant. It was just a blink of an eye since the short Demon launched the sneak attack on him until the fight Yang Kai had with the white silhouette.

Only then did Yang Kai slowly turn around with a slight smile as he looked forward mockingly.

Less than twenty metres away from him, a woman was standing quietly, looking delicate and pitiful; however, her body was exceptionally curvaceous. She had tall, proud peaks, a flat belly, and long slender legs. Her snowy white skin seemed so delicate that one would desire to handle it with care lest it be marred.

As if she had just been graced with rain and dew, the female Demon’s face was slightly flushed, and her bright eyes were filled with a trace of satisfaction.

This female Demon was the same woman Yang Kai had spied on earlier, the Charm Demon.

In such close proximity, she could obviously sense the fight Yang Kai had with the black shadow.

The Charm Demon was completely naked at this moment, with her most beautiful parts generously revealed, but she didn’t seem the slightest bit uncomfortable or embarrassed.

Beside the Charm Demon was the fluctuating aura of the black shadow, drifting shakily. It was obviously the Demon who launched the sneak attack on Yang Kai but ended up being wounded instead.

“It’s you!” The Charm Demon looked at Yang Kai with her eyes brightened and tilted her head with an innocent look, “I’m impressed that you found this place.”

Yang Kai grinned, “Do we know each other?”

The Charm Demon giggled, “Don’t we know each other now?”

Yang Kai nods, “How can I address you?”

The Charm Demon let out a peel of silvery laughter as her snow-white peaks bounced slightly. Then, she replied with a flutter of her eyes, “I’m Demon King Sha Ya.”

“Demon King?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, “If you are a Demon King, the position above Demon King must be Demon Saint, yes?”

Sha Ya smiled at Yang Kai and answered faintly, “Little Brother, are you trying to extract information from me? Your little trick isn’t clever enough.”

Yang Kai shrugged, “I’m just trying to have a conversation with you since this is our first meeting. It’s up to you to answer or not.”

“Interesting,” Sha Ya glanced up and down at Yang Kai before frowning slightly and continuing with a little regret, “But your physique looks quite weak.”

Yang Kai clicked his tongue, “Having a small body doesn’t mean I’m weak. You’re someone who has been through numerous battles before, so haven’t you met something that looked impressive but was utterly useless in the end?”

After hearing it, Sha Ya nodded in agreement, “You’re right. Above Demon Kings are the Demon Saints. Don’t you have Saints too? They just had a fight a few days ago, so don’t tell me you have no idea about it.”

“Of course I do. It seems that both sides suffered great losses. Unfortunately, I didn’t witness it with my own eyes.”

Sha Ya looked at him strangely, “Witness it with your own eyes? You should be careful that your recklessness doesn’t cost you your life.”

Yang Kai guffawed, “Everything I have is tough, especially my life.”

Sha Ya pressed on meaningfully, “I’ll have to confirm that for myself.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You will have the chance,” Yang Kai nodded lightly before changing his tone. “If what’s above you are the Demon Saints, then what’s beneath you?”

“What’s beneath me? Can’t you see for yourself?” Sha Ya’s face suddenly blushed with shyness and her tone became gentle. She half displayed half hid the alluring parts of her body intentionally as she spoke, causing the surrounding atmosphere to suddenly change.

Yang Kai gulped his saliva and looked down, “En…”

The short Demon who had been standing next to Sha Ya immediately grunted and fled from the scene as fast as he could.

Sha Ya was performing her Charm Technique, so he had to escape otherwise he would instantly become her slave.

“Don’t mind him, he’s just a useless little thing,” Sha Ya smiled gently, a slight moan reverberating out of her throat as her delicate body flushed and she asked as she bit her red lips, “I’m a little uncomfortable right now. Little Brother, can you help me?”

“Yes!” Yang Kai called out immediately with glazed eyes and walked forward. His breathing became heavy, and his eyes were locked on Sha Ya’s snowy white body like a leech. His aggressive look seemed to please Sha Ya and she felt unimaginable pleasure all over her body. She giggled, releasing a faint ripple of power in her laughter before she opened her arms and tossed herself at Yang Kai.

In her arms, Yang Kai’s eyes, which should have been lost in lust, suddenly flashed as he grabbed Sha Ya’s hair and pulled her body backwards.

“That hurts!” Sha Ya squealed, frowning a bit with a confused look in her eyes, “What are you trying to do?”

Yang Kai grinned, “What do you think I’m going to do?”

Sha Ya was shocked, “How can you…”

Seeing the mocking look on Yang Kai’s face, Sha Ya knew that she had failed to charm him.

How was that possible though? She was from the famous Charm Demon Clan! A Demon King Charm Demon! Yang Kai’s aura was obviously several realms lower than hers, so such an opponent should be easily manipulated, but her Charm Technique failed to work on him at all.

Clearly, his previous delirious actions were all just an act. Looking at the sarcastic and cold light in his eyes at the moment, how could there be any trace of him being charmed?

Yang Kai snorted, “You dare use such a trivial Charm Technique in front of this Shaman? You really don’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth!”

As his words fell, he punched out towards Sha Ya’s plentiful peaks.

Sha Ya had never encountered such a situation before; therefore, she could not react in time. Only when Yang Kai attacked her did her beautiful face change drastically as she let out a scream.

When Yang Kai was about to attack, it seemed that an invisible blade stabbed into his head; however, it did not deter his punch as he pushed through the pair to hit Sha Ya’s chest.

His Shaman Strength exploded with a bang.

A mass of blood burst from Sha Ya’s chest on impact.

At the same time, with the aid of the impact and taking advantage of the moment when Yang Kai’s Soul was affected, Sha Ya forcibly flung her head forward, sacrificing her hair in order to slip herself out of Yang Kai’s grip like a loach.

After regaining her balance, Sha Ya looked down at herself with a darkened face, her body trembling in rage.

One of her two snowy white peaks that she had always been incredibly proud of was gone and the blood from the wound was flowing all the way down her lower abdomen, staining her graceful legs!

“I’ll kill you!” Sha Ya madly screamed.

She was a Charm Demon, and her figure was an important part of her strength. It was difficult for her to accept that her perfect figure had been destroyed by Yang Kai, and although it was possible to recover from such an injury, she would need to pay a heavy price for it.

Because of her carelessness, she suffered a great loss from a Barbarian who was several Realms weaker than her.

Yang Kai did not say a word and instead flickered, shooting towards Sha Ya again. Although his purpose of coming here was to collect intelligence this time, since he was exposed, he would not shy away from a fight. It would be best if he could kill the Demon King here, so that this trip would not be wasted.

Seeing the scrawny Barbarian rushing towards her like an angry lion, Sha Ya instinctively felt a sense of danger, as if she would die here if she did not leave.

She could not believe that she would have such a thought, but after hesitating for a moment, Sha Ya decided to trust her instincts.

A circle of light suddenly burst out from her body, transmitting a huge and incomparable force of resistance. Yang Kai was already right in front of her, but before he managed to grab her, he was knocked back by this circle of light.
