The dark Flood Dragon exploded and the battered Territory Lord appeared. Even though the Secret Technique was powerful, she was the one who activated it, after all. Cang managed to hijack it and send it back against her, but even though the Flood Dragon had been strengthened, it couldn’t possibly kill her.

However, it was inevitable that she would be hurt since she was caught completely off guard.

The moment she extricated herself, a Great Sun exploded in front of her and made her unable to open her eyes. At the same time, she was engulfed in a great sense of danger.

Instantly, this Territory Lord screamed as her Black Ink Strength madly left her body and was dispelled by the Purifying Light.

As though having a spirituality of its own, the white light streamed into her body through her seven orifices and freshly opened wounds. In an instant, her expression turned hideous and she howled in agony.

At that moment, she did not only feel that her Black Ink Strength was being destroyed as though it had come across an archnemesis, but also that her very body was melting like snow under a scorching Sun. Her alluring face literally began to warp like a burning candle.

Just then, the Azure Dragon Spear stabbed right between her eyes. Black blood spattered as she instinctively threw a palm on Yang Kai’s chest.

Yang Kai didn’t bother to dodge it, taking the blow directly as he infused all of his strength into the Azure Dragon Spear and thrust it forward, “Fall!”

The spear penetrated the Territory Lord’s head and a violent World Force exploded, causing her skull to shatter to pieces.

At the same time, Yang Kai was sent flying away as he plunged back beside Cang and gasped, clearly in pain.

Cang looked down at him, and upon seeing his chest caved in, he was surprised as he commented, “You were almost killed!”

In that moment earlier, the Territory Lord didn’t just land a palm on Yang Kai once. In fact, she had struck him several dozen times on the same spot; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been so horribly injured given the fact that he had an extremely powerful Dragon Vein.

Any other Seventh-Order Master would have lost their life if they were in Yang Kai’s shoes as not just anyone could kill an opponent that was far more powerful than themselves.

In Cang’s eyes, the battle between Yang Kai and the Territory Lord was no different from two small children fighting with each other, but to those involved, given their powers, it was truly a life-and-death contest.

The moment the Territory Lord suffered a backlash of her own Divine Ability, Yang Kai directly charged forward, which went to show how determined he was. When he saw a chance, he did not hesitate to seize it.

Not many could be as determined and ruthless as he was. Any hesitation at that moment would have cost him the chance to kill his enemy.

Even faced with the counterattack of an enemy much stronger than he was, he didn’t back down and instead risked being further injured in order to end the enemy’s life, which showed how ruthless he was to both his enemies and himself.

Even though the process was short, it was a life-and-death moment that even somewhat surprised someone like Cang.

Then, he gulped down some healing pills and started recuperating. The reason he came to Cang’s side was to seek his refuge and restore some strength. It never crossed his mind that the Territory Lord would be so relentless, or Cang would create a chance for him to turn things around.

They were all risking their lives to destroy the enemy. At that instant, Cang fell into a dazed state, [They’re the Humans of the current generation.]

It was because of their willingness to sacrifice themselves that they managed to reach this place. Cang had been waiting for millions of years, and only this generation of Humans allowed him to see the silver lining.

The battlefield was filled with chaos, and with every breath there would be powerful auras withering. Both the Humans and Black Ink Clan suffered immense losses.

Even some of the Royal Lords lost their lives. Earlier, several Royal Lords were killed the instant they left the gap, not because they were weak, but because of the circumstances they had to deal with. If they wanted to escape out of the gap, they had to bear the attacks from the Ninth-Order Masters lying in ambush for them.

In such a situation, it was expected that some Royal Lords were killed; however, once they managed to leave the gap, they became much harder to kill. Even so, as the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters joined forces, they managed to kill four more Royal Lords.

However, the situation didn’t change at all. After four Royal Lords were killed, another four Royal Lords appeared from the gap to replace them. There were no longer any more Ninth-Order Masters outside the gap, so the Royal Lords could leave at will. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At this point, the Human Race Masters realised that Mo was trying to maintain balance on the battlefield. There were surely even more Royal Lords hiding in the darkness; however, Mo didn’t release them all at once. Instead, it had been replacing the dead Royal Lords with new ones in an attempt to make it look as though both sides were equally matched.

Regardless, even Cang was unable to figure out Mo’s intention, let alone the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. Fortunately, this was the situation they hoped to see. If the Black Ink Clan soldiers were so powerful that the Humans were unable to deal with them, it was bad news to the Human Race as a whole.

Cang had been paying close attention to the movements in the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. He was wary of Mo’s plans, thinking it must be up to something; however, he was unable to figure out what since it wasn’t the right time yet. Now, he could only keep his guard up. If something went wrong, he would immediately seal the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction and stop Mo from getting out of the trap.

“Heaven Devouring Battle Law?” Yang Kai turned to Cang with a doubtful expression. While Yang Kai was restoring his energy, Cang wasn’t just sitting idly by either.

Previously, Yang Kai had passed him a lot of resources to recuperate, and Cang had been refining them in order to replenish his losses this whole time.

Cang was able to refine resources extremely quickly, which was understandable as he was a powerful cultivator, but the real crux of the matter was that Yang Kai detected traces of the Heaven Devouring Battle Law in the way the old man refined the resources.

Yang Kai had cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Law before; however, he hadn’t mastered this Secret Art, so he wasn’t comparable to Wu Kuang in this regard. With that said, he understood this Evil Art more than anyone else aside from the latter.

Therefore, the moment he detected similar traces of it, he was stunned.

Initially, Yang Kai thought that he was mistaken, but as he observed Cang for a while longer, he confirmed that the latter was indeed using the Heaven Devouring Battle Law. If that wasn’t the case, even though Cang was a Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he couldn’t have refined resources so quickly.

Moreover, he wasn’t just refining the resources that were given to him. If one paid close attention, they would realise that Cang was even devouring the Black Ink Strength left behind by the nearby dead Black Ink Clansmen.

Upon that realization, Yang Kai was flabbergasted.

The Heaven Devouring Battle Law was a Secret Art that Wu Kuang had personally created, and it was probably the most extraordinary and evil one in history, so why was Cang able to use it?

Hearing Yang Kai’s words, Cang was also startled for a moment before a look of pleasant surprise appeared on his face and he asked, “Do you recognise this Secret Art?”

Yang Kai replied with uncertainty, “Perhaps I’m mistaken.”

There were countless Secret Arts in this world, and even though Heaven Devouring Battle Law was quite possibly the evilest Secret Arts in existence, Cang was someone who had lived for millions of years, so it shouldn’t be surprising that such an unrivalled Master knew some amazing Secret Arts. Perhaps his Secret Art only shared some similarities with Heaven Devouring Battle Law.

Cang said, “It’s fine. Look closely.”

Yang Kai’s expression turned more and more stunned as he watched.

Although this Secret Art was slightly different from the one he knew, it was indeed the Heaven Devouring Battle Law. The two Secret Arts shared more than 90% of the same circulation paths while the remaining 10% seemed to be due to some kind of personal abstrusity that he couldn’t quite grasp.

A puzzled Yang Kai asked, “Why does Senior know the Heaven Devouring Battle Law?”

He was even more perplexed at the fact that Cang appeared so thrilled at this moment. [What’s so exciting about it? He didn’t seem this exhilarated even after so many Royal Lords were killed.]

Instead of answering his question, Cang asked, “You call this ‘Heaven Devouring Battle Law’? Who do you know who uses this Secret Art?”

After giving it some thought, Yang Kai replied, “There’s an old fart named Wu Kuang who cultivates this Secret Art. As far as I knew, he was the creator of this Secret Art. I had a chance to cultivate this Secret Art in the past and even did so for a time in a sense, though not anymore. Supposedly, there should be no one else who has cultivated it. Oh, I also taught the Stone Spirit Clan this Secret Art long ago.”

The Heaven Devouring Battle Law was too wicked and even though it could help a cultivator increase their strength rapidly, its drawbacks were simply unbearable for most people. Even Yang Kai was unable to resolve those drawbacks; therefore, the moment he realised something was wrong back then, he stopped cultivating it.

Wu Kuang was different, for he had the Flawless Purifying Golden Lotus, so he could recklessly devour external powers without worrying about any backlash. However, there was only one Flawless Purifying Golden Lotus in existence, so no one else could imitate him; hence, there was only one Heaven Devouring Great Emperor in the World.

The reason the Stone Spirit Clan members were able to cultivate the Heaven Devouring Battle Law was that their physiques were unique. Their bodies were not made from flesh, and they had an innate ability to refine and expel all kinds of impurities; therefore, they were best suited to cultivate the Heaven Devouring Battle Law.

“Wu Kuang…” Cang muttered, “Tell me more about that guy.”

Although Yang Kai was puzzled at the fact that Cang seemed interested in Wu Kuang, he still told him everything he knew. Honestly, he had mostly learned about Wu Kuang through rumours and stories.

Yang Kai hadn’t even been born when Wu Kuang was first active, so he wasn’t sure of the details of the war in the Shattered Star Sea back then. He only knew that many Great Emperors of the Star Boundary were killed in that clash while they managed to ‘kill’ Wu Kuang in the end.

In truth, Wu Kuang faked his death and escaped. Then, he waited for a chance to resurrect.

It took 20,000 years or so, but Wu Kuang’s wish was eventually granted. Although he had managed to escape from the Shattered Star Sea, his cultivation had plunged. At that time, he occupied Bustling World Great Emperor’s body and spent quite a long time sharing it with the body’s original owner, Duan Hong Chen.

Then, Wu Kuang appeared on Dragon Island and kicked up a storm before vanishing into thin air again. When he reappeared, it was when the Great Emperors of the Star Boundary joined forces to deal with Great Demon God.

The Star Boundary was almost destroyed in that war, and after the death of Great Demon God, Mo Sheng, Wu Kuang seized the former’s body and fully resurrected. Then, he broke free of the Star Boundary’s restraints and headed out into the Outer Universe to seek greater heights in the Martial Dao.

Yang Kai had no idea what Wu Kuang went through after the latter left the Star Boundary.
