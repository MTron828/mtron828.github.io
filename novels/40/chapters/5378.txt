“It was like they were watching a show?” Mi Jing Lun was astounded.

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded solemnly, “It was like the war between the two Races had nothing to do with them. If I hadn’t examined them out of curiosity, they wouldn’t have shifted their attention to me.”

At that time, he felt that something was off, so he examined the place where the Royal Lords had come together. It was at that moment when he caught the attention of one of the Royal Lords.

His Eighth-Order Divine Sense exposed his identity. Before he even entered the Black Ink Nest Space, the fact that Mo Zhao was killed had been spread among the Black Ink Clan. If he hadn’t run away as soon as possible, he would’ve been more severely injured if not killed.

Xiang Shan and the others fell silent, for they were unable to figure out the Black Ink Clan’s intention after hearing what Yang Kai had said. Regardless, this piece of information had been shared with the other Great Passes, so the Ninth-Order Masters were on guard. Even if those hidden Royal Lords really intended to ambush the Old Ancestors, it would be hard for them to succeed now.

It was unrealistic to let Yang Kai enter the Black Ink Nest Space again as his identity had been exposed. If he still entered the space, he would be targeted by those Royal Lords and perhaps he would even lose his life.

After a moment of silence, Yang Kai said, “There was something else that bothered me.”

“What was it?” Xiang Shan asked.

“It’s the Black Ink Nest Space itself!” Yang Kai turned solemn, “From what we’ve gathered, there’s a strict hierarchy between Black Ink Nests. The High-Rank Black Ink Nests give birth to Mid-Rank Black Ink Nests, which then give birth to the Low-Rank Black Ink Nests. The consciousness of a High-Rank or Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest can form into a space which serves as a platform for the lower-rank Black Ink Nests to communicate with each other. In that case, what about the space that I entered through the Royal Lord’s Black Ink Nest? Is it formed from a Black Ink Nest’s consciousness as well? Does that mean that there’s a higher-rank Black Ink Nest above the High-Rank Black Ink Nests?”

As he spoke, he observed the expressions of Xiang Shan and the others. Realising something, he asked, “Do you have a speculation, Seniors?”

He saw that the others remained unfazed. It was apparent that they were not surprised by his hypothesis.

Xiang Shan nodded, “We do have a speculation, but we can’t verify it. We have never gathered enough information about the Black Ink Nests to make a judgement. It was you who entered the Black Ink Clan’s territory and found out some useful information. In fact, we had such a speculation a long time ago. The High-Rank Black Ink Nests can give birth to the Mid-Rank Black Ink Nests, which can then give birth to Low-Rank Black Ink Nests. Where do the High-Rank Black Ink Nests come from, then? It’s not like they had appeared out of thin air. There has to be a source.”

Mi Jing Lun then said, “The way the Black Ink Clan named the Black Ink Nests is also interesting, and there’s a trail to trace. Since the Mid-Rank Black Ink Nests were born from the High-Rank Black Ink Nests, they are the latter’s sub-nests. Similarly, the Low-Rank Black Ink Nests are the sub-nests of Mid-Rank Black Ink Nests. Since there are sub-nests, shouldn’t there be a Mother Nest? However, the term ‘Mother Nest’ has never been mentioned among the Black Ink Clan; therefore, we have a speculation that the High-Rank Black Ink Nests are also the sub-nests of a Black Ink Nest, which is supposedly the Mother Nest of the Black Ink Clan. It is also the source of everything!”

“The Mother Nest!” Yang Kai arched his brow.

Mi Jing Lun nodded, “However, this is just our speculation and we have no way to verify it. From what you experienced though, we can conclude that there’s indeed some kind of Mother Nest. The space you entered has to be the Mother Nest Space. Only the Mother Nest’s power could connect all the High-Rank Black Ink Nests together.”

Yang Kai fell into his thoughts for a moment, then said, “In that case, could those over 20 Royal Lords be the… Mother Nest’s guards?”

Xiang Shan and Mi Jing Lun exchanged glances before nodding, “That’s possible.”

Since the Mother Nest was the source of the Black Ink Clan, it must be extremely important to them. In that case, there had to be a heavy level of protection around it.

20 plus Royal Lords was a force to be reckoned with, and with such protection, the Mother Nest’s safety could be ensured under most circumstances.

It was a similar case for the Small Stone Race in Yang Kai’s Small Universe. The strongest Small Stone Race members would always stay inside the nests, not leaving unless absolutely necessary.

That explained why the 20 or more Royal Lords didn’t seem concerned about the war between the two Races.

Their job was to protect the Mother Nest, so they would never leave that place. Regardless of how perilous the situation was for the Black Ink Clan’s outer forces, it had nothing to do with them.

“We know too little about the Black Ink Clan, so we don’t know if the truth is just like what we’ve speculated. Regardless, as long as the Human Race wins the war in all the Theatres, we’ll get to the truth.”

It was ironic that even though the Humans had been entangled with the Black Ink Clan for countless aeons and millions had lost their lives on the Black Ink Battlefield, they still knew so little about the Black Ink Clan.

On the other hand, the Black Ink Clan was able to corrupt Open Heaven Realm Masters, so they understood the Humans pretty well.

Everything they had said was giving Ou Yang Lie a headache so he snapped, “Stop worrying too much. If there’s really a Mother Nest, we’ll just find it and smash it. It’s not like a mere 20 Royal Lords is enough to stop us. We have more than 100 Old Ancestors on our side, why should we be afraid of them?”

It was a wonder why he had the confidence to say 20 Royal Lords was not a lot when he was just an Eighth-Order Master.

With that said, he had a point. Even if there was indeed a Mother Nest, they just had to find and destroy it. At the end of the day, they had the power to do so.

During the discussion, a voice reverberated across the entire Great Pass all of a sudden.

“Blue Sky Pass has won! The Royal Lord has been killed! Most of the Territory Lords fell in battle! The Royal City has been ruined!”

“Blue Sky Pass has won! The Royal Lord has been killed! Most of the Territory Lords fell in battle! The Royal City has been ruined!”

“Blue Sky Pass has won! The Royal Lord has been killed! Most of the Territory Lords fell in battle! The Royal City has been ruined!”

…

The person repeatedly made the announcement.

Great Evolution Pass had originally fallen silent, but when they heard the announcement, they started cheering so loudly that the entire Great Pass seemed to be shaking.

Blue Sky Pass had won. The Royal Lord was dead. The Royal City was destroyed. There was no denying it was good news for the Humans.

Even though the dust had settled in the Great Evolution Theatre, the average soldiers knew nothing about the situations in the other Theatres.

The Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters who had returned were doing their best to restore their strength so that they could head out to other Great Passes through the Space Array to provide reinforcements.

The victory in Great Evolution Theatre wasn’t much of a surprise as the Black Ink Clan here had basically been defeated 200 years ago and were forced to hide inside their Royal City. They even used thousands of Low-Rank Black Ink Nests to build a defence line made of Black Ink Strength around the Royal City.

Faced with a battered and cowering Black Ink Clan, there was no way Great Evolution Army wouldn’t win given all the advantages they had.

Even though they were surprised by the sudden appearance of a Ninth-Order Black Ink Disciple, it wasn’t enough to turn the situation around.

It could be said that before the crusade started, the Great Evolution Army had the confidence that they would definitely win this war. Although they were ecstatic about the victory, they were not surprised. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

However, the news they had just received was different. In addition to the Great Evolution Theatre, the Human Race had conquered another Theatre.

Everyone believed that it was just the beginning. As the war continued to unfold, more and more good news would come from the other Theatres.

The voice had come from the Space Array Hall, and as the announcement was made, a messenger was also coming over in a hurry.

A moment later, a Seventh-Order Master dashed into the Main Hall. He was a member who was responsible for protecting the Space Array. With an excited expression, he said, “Blue Sky Pass has won! The news has been spread to all the Great Passes!”

Xiang Shan laughed, “Give it to me!”

The Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master stepped forward and respectfully held out a jade slip.

After taking the jade slip, Xiang Shan scanned it with his Divine Sense and smiled brightly.

Mi Jing Lun and the others took turns to read the content in the jade slip, and they were all elated.

The good news from Blue Sky Pass had diminished their worries about the Mother Nest. Furthermore, it was pointless to worry about it now. If the Black Ink Clan really had hidden arrangements, they would be revealed soon enough.

Three days later, more good news arrived.

The same Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master’s voice reverberated across the entire Great Evolution Pass again, “Yin-Yang Pass has won! They killed 87 Territory Lords and the Black Ink Clan survivors are on the run. The Royal City has been shattered!”

A few days later, there was another piece of good news.

“Azure Void Pass has won! The Old Ancestor single-handedly beheaded the Royal Lord with his sword!”

…

“Wind and Cloud Pass has won!”

“Myriad Demons Pass has won!”

…

Over the next half a month, good news arrived almost every single day. Sometimes, there were two to three announcements in a day. All of the news showed that the Humans had managed to destroy the Black Ink Clan in those Theatres.

Many Royal Lords were killed, and countless Territory Lords had lost their lives in battle, not to mention the Feudal Lords.

Some of the announcements didn’t mention Royal Lords, so it was obvious that the Royal Lords in those Theatres were still alive.

It wasn’t easy to kill a Royal Lord. Over the years, the Old Ancestors in all the Theatres had clashed with the Royal Lords frequently, with both parties repeatedly being wounded after exchanging moves. However, rarely would any Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master or Royal Lord lose their life.

The fact that they were able to kill so many Royal Lords this time was largely thanks to the Evil Purging Divine Spears.

The Old Ancestors were not equipped with Evil Purging Divine Spears because these artifacts were not harmful to the Royal Lords. The Ninth-Order Old Ancestors’ had to depend on their own heritages if they wanted to kill the Royal Lords.

Even though the Old Ancestors didn’t have Evil Purging Divine Spears, the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were all given these weapons. The unsuspecting Territory Lords were struck by the spears and became easy targets. Once enough Territory Lords were killed, some of the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were able to assist the Old Ancestors.

As long as there were five or six Eighth-Order Masters who fearlessly assisted, the Ninth-Order Old Ancestors would have a chance to kill the Royal Lords.

However, these Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters might lose their lives during the fight, which was the price they had to pay.

Only good news was mentioned in the announcements, with no details about the casualties on the Humans’ side. Nevertheless, everyone knew that behind the good news were the sacrifices and blood of many Human Race Masters.

It was also apparent to everyone that the Theatres where the wars were won in the shortest time all had something to do with Yang Kai.

Blue Sky Pass, which was the first to share the good news, needed no introduction. Yang Kai had first arrived in Blue Sky Pass and stayed there for centuries until he was transferred to the Great Evolution Army.

It was a similar case for Yin-Yang Pass, which was the second to share the good news. Yang Kai had been to Yin-Yang Pass to carry out an important mission and not only provided them with great assistance but also managed to do serious damage to the Black Ink Clan’s territory.

It was the same case for Myriad Demons Pass. Yang Kai had stayed there for a while to study the two Eye Secret Techniques under the Old Ancestor of Myriad Demons Heaven. He had paid quite a bit of Military Merits for that opportunity.

In these three Theatres, Yang Kai had found the entrances to the Universe Cave Heavens and Universe Paradises outside of those Great Passes, which the Humans then used to set up different traps to slaughter large numbers of Black Ink Clansmen, especially Territory Lords.

It could be said that the Black Ink Clan had suffered immense losses in these three Theatres before the crusade even began. Blue Sky Pass’ forward base was built halfway to the Royal City, and was connected to the Great Pass by a pair of Universe Arrays. If the Humans wanted to attack the Royal City, they could transfer people around with far more convenience than any other Theatre.
