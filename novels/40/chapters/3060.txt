The fact that the Second Elder had gone to the Dragon Grave was shocking enough, but now, even the Great Elder was heading to the same place. What was going on in the Dragon Grave that required immediate attention from two Masters, who were as powerful as Great Emperors?

Yang Kai fell into his thoughts as he scratched his chin. Suddenly, the corner of his mouth twitched as he uttered aggrievedly, “We’ve been fooled.”

“What do you mean?” Zhu Qing looked doubtfully at him.

Yang Kai said through gritted teeth, “Old ginger really is spicier!”

Judging from the situation just now, something serious must have happened in the Dragon Grave, and even the Second Elder couldn’t handle it on her own, which was why the Great Elder had to rush over to help. In other words, whether or not Yang Kai released Fu Chi, the Great Elder couldn’t stay there for a long time.

If he just stalled for a bit longer, he wouldn’t even have to negotiate with the Great Elder. With Fu Chi still in his hands, he and Zhu Qing could easily leave Dragon Island. With the Great Elder and the Second Elder out of the way, he had guessed that the Fourth Elder wouldn’t be able to stop them.

However, Yang Kai had been tricked by the Great Elder. Now that his hostage was gone, he had lost a decisive advantage. Nevertheless, after a change of thought, he felt that this might actually be the best outcome.

If he didn’t agree to the Great Elder’s demand just now, the Great Elder might be forced to fight with him. By then, both Fu Chi and him would end up in a miserable state. With this thought in mind, Yang Kai became much calmer. Although he had been fooled by the Great Elder, the outcome was still acceptable.

With the two strongest Elders gone, only the Fourth Elder Zhu Kong and the other Dragon Clan members were left standing in front of the palace.

With a faint smile, Yang Kai turned to look at Zhu Kong, “Fourth Elder, what do you think? Will you let us go? Or will you fight with me until the winner emerges?”

It had been a day full of surprises so far, but things were going in his favour. With the Great Elder and the Second Elder out of the way, Yang Kai felt confident when dealing with the other Dragon Clan members.

After a sigh, Zhu Kong uttered, “It’s an eventful day on Dragon Island indeed. If possible, please stay here for a few days more, then we’ll talk it out.”

Yang Kai replied with a grin, “Fourth Elder, do you think you can fool me just because I’m young? If I don’t leave Dragon Island today, there won’t be any chance for me to do so again in the future. So, I cannot agree to your ‘request’.”

“You’re right.” Zhu Kong nodded slightly, “My request is indeed unacceptable.”

With a sincere expression, Zhu Qing stepped forward and stared at Zhu Kong, “Fourth Elder, Yang Kai and I are not willing to go against the Dragon Clan. We just want to leave this place. Please grant our wish.”

Appearing serious, Zhu Kong shook his head, “You’ve heard what the Great Elder said. There won’t be a good ending unless both of you surrender without resisting.”

“Come fight with me, then.” Yang Kai stepped forward. His figure was as sturdy as a steel tower, and his Dragon Pressure rolled around him.

The Fourth Elder narrowed his eyes, “There are only two of you, so you won’t stand a chance of winning. I suggest you stop resisting.”

Right after he finished his words, a figure suddenly appeared and stood beside Zhu Qing.

Zhu Qing turned to look at him and frowned. Then, she parted her lips in an attempt to say something, but she didn’t utter a word in the end.

On the other hand, Zhu Lie cupped his fists and said, “Fourth Elder, I’m sorry, but I have to side with Zhu Qing.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The person who had appeared was none other than Zhu Lie.

Seeing that, all the Dragon Clan members turned ashen in an instant. Although Zhu Lie and Zhu Qing were siblings, what Zhu Lie was doing was basically rebelling against Dragon Island and the Dragon Clan. Besides the familial bond, it must also have taken him a lot of resolution to make such a decision.

Zhu Kong appeared unperturbed, however, as though this was within his expectations. After a nod, he said, “Good. Every decision comes with corresponding consequences. I hope that you won’t regret your decision today.”

Zhu Lie replied, “I won’t.”

Yang Kai guffawed, “As family, we should go to war and fight for our future together. Little brother-in-law, you’re truly not bad!”

The corner of Zhu Lie’s mouth twitched. Every time he heard Yang Kai call him ‘little brother-in-law’, he had the urge to beat him up.

Just then, a person stepped out of the crowd and stood firmly beside Zhu Lie. However, the way he carried himself was starkly different from Zhu Lie. He appeared timid, and his body was trembling slightly. Apparently, he was quite afraid.

“You’re here too?” Zhu Lie looked at Li Jiao in shock.

The corner of Li Jiao’s mouth twitched, “Young Master Zhu, it’s been a while since we last met.”

Without uttering a word, Zhu Lie extended his hand and clapped Li Jiao’s shoulder.

In an instant, Li Jiao appeared shocked at the gesture. Although he had been in contact with Zhu Lie previously, and they had even endured some life-or-death moments in the Revolving World together, Zhu Lie had never spared him a glance from the beginning.

Li Jiao could clearly feel that Zhu Lie was disdainful of him. As he was just a Dragonborn, he knew that it was impossible for him to get a Dragon Clan member to take him seriously… Until this day!

Although it was just a simple gesture from Zhu Lie, it represented his recognition and amiability.

Li Jiao wasn’t even sure if he should feel happy or sorrowful. He had just gained Zhu Lie’s recognition by stepping forward to side with him. If he managed to survive on this day, he would get innumerable benefits from him in the future; however, the chances of leaving alive today were slim to say the least. Li Jiao seriously wondered if he would have a chance to return to Fire Dragon Palace at all.

“A Dragonborn?” The Fourth Elder gazed at Li Jiao with a frown as he had identified him at first glance. Dragonborn were easily recognizable because their Dragon Blood wasn’t pure. All Dragon Clan members despised Dragonborn because they didn’t like the murky aura that lingered about their bodies.

No Dragonborn could raise their head in front of a member of the Dragon Clan as they felt inferior. They wouldn’t even dare to look into a Dragon’s eyes, let alone oppose them.

However, this Dragonborn’s actions were surprising. Zhu Kong looked meaningfully at Yang Kai because he knew that it must have something to do with this lad that this Dragonborn had the guts to step forward.

[How charismatic is this boy that even a Dragonborn is willing to risk his life for him? Anyway, it’s useless. Although this Dragonborn’s cultivation is strong, his bloodline is too impure, so he is not a match for the Dragon Clan at all.]

“Fourth Elder, there are four of us now!” Yang Kai arched his brow and stared at Zhu Kong.

Although the number of people on his side was still not comparable to that of the Dragon Clan, it had actually increased twofold, as there were only two of them initially.

Zhu Kong smiled faintly, “Four still isn’t enough.”

“Indeed, four people aren’t a lot, but what if you include us?”

Just then, a clear voice was heard right beside everyone’s ears. All of them were stunned because there didn’t seem to be any figure that had appeared, but they could hear the voice loud and clear.

“Huh?” Yang Kai arched his brow and looked towards the Void.

Noticing something as well, Zhu Kong narrowed his eyes and muttered, “This voice…”

A certain spot up in the sky nearby suddenly began to distort before space collapsed and a black tear appeared, looking like a great beast’s maw that could swallow up everything in existence.

“A Void Corridor!” Someone shouted in amazement.

A Void Corridor couldn’t appear for no reason, and judging from the person’s voice from just now, everyone immediately realized that a Master was approaching from this tear in space. However, who was this reckless person who had the guts to provoke the Dragon Clan even before appearing? That person must be tired of living, as hardly anyone could bear the Dragon Clan’s wrath.

Right in front of everyone’s eyes, a petite figure walked out of the Void Corridor. All of them were stunned at the sight because the person was too petite. She was just a little girl!

She appeared to be a seven or eight-year-old girl who was clad in an oversized dress. The long sleeves even reached her ankles. Her hair was tied into two ponytails. Her face appeared soft and adorable.

Besides the hundreds of Humans, the Dragon Clan members also couldn’t help sizing her up.

Right after the little girl appeared, she darted her gaze around and swept a glance across everyone in an attempt to look for someone. Excitement and expectation were written all over her face.

“Ah!?” Yang Kai exclaimed before he grinned widely.

Finally, the little girl’s gaze fell upon him. After she was startled for a bit, she charged forward and appeared before Yang Kai in the blink of an eye.

All of them couldn’t help feeling worried for her because there was a stark difference between Yang Kai’s towering figure and the little girl’s petite body. Even if the little girl stood on her toes, she would only be as large as Yang Kai’s nose.

At that moment, Yang Kai was grinning, like he was about to swallow the little girl with his enormous mouth.

Just when everyone was utterly anxious, the little girl spoke in a clear voice, “Master, why are you so big now?”

[M-Master?] All of them were dumbfounded, thinking that they had heard it wrong.

Zhu Kong’s expression became awkward as he could sense that although this little girl appeared young and innocent, there was an enormous power within her body. Moreover, that was the power of a Divine Spirit that was comparable to that of the Dragon Clan.

Nevertheless, he had never heard of such a strange yet formidable Master before. What puzzled him was that this little girl even addressed Yang Kai as ‘Master’. [Are they Master and servant? How is that possible?]

It was the first time today that Zhu Kong began to feel uneasy. He could sense that a profound change would befall Dragon Island on this day, and that revelation made his heart grow heavy.

Furthermore, the voice that appeared from nowhere just now wasn’t this little girl’s voice, that voice sounded more like…

“How dare you touch my butt!”

Just when everyone was in a dazed state, a woman was heard yelling. Following that, a beautiful woman in an imperial dress shuffled out of the Void Corridor. Then, with a furious expression, she turned to glare into the black nothingness.

The atmosphere had been quite intense when such words were heard all of a sudden, which caused everyone’s expression to become awkward. After such a disruption, the anxiety in their hearts vanished into thin air.

“I didn’t do it intentionally! You were the one blocking the way…” A third person’s voice was heard speaking. Everyone could hear clearly that it was the man’s voice from earlier.

The Void Corridor’s entrance flickered slightly, upon which a handsome and elegant man emerged. With a bitter smile, he appeared slightly embarrassed. Upon his appearance, the Void Corridor shrank and disappeared completely.
