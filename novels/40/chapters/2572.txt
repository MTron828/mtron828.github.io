“What good would it do me lying to you? You are about to die soon anyway,” Yang Kai indifferently stated.

The Monster King replied, “The words of you Humans… heh heh…” He implied that the Humans were too deceitful and untrustworthy.

Yang Kai turned around and left without another word, “Since that’s what you want then forget it.”

“Hold on…”

Unsurprisingly, Yang Kai only walked a few steps before the Monster King called out to him.

After all, his life was at stake, and before him was a glimmer of hope and a chance to struggle.

Yang Kai glanced back and looked at him with squinted eyes.

The Monster King murmured a sentence, who knows whether he was cursing or not, but after a moment he finally spoke, “Take this King out first, then this King will tell you whatever you want to know.”

“You dream!” Yang Kai coldly snorted, not bothering to pay attention to him anymore.

Seeing that Yang Kai was really planning to leave, the Monster King immediately became anxious. He didn’t have the time to negotiate with Yang Kai either, so he replied in a hoarse voice, “Yes, someone did pass through here!”

Yang Kai halted his footsteps once more, turned around and added, indifferently looking at him, “Don’t play games with me, or I will immediately leave.”

The Monster King’s face turned ugly, but he didn’t dare to say anything.

Yang Kai stated, “What did the person who passed here look like?”

The Monster King angrily replied, “It was a woman. Her hair was a mess and she was clearly crazy. She even smashed a Monster Core on this King’s forehead. If this King hadn’t fallen in this predicament, how would this King be bullied by her?”

Yang Kai found it very funny; however, the Third Disciple might really do something like this, so he continued asking in a calm voice, “Did she leave in that direction?”

“Indeed!”

Hearing this news, Yang Kai couldn’t help but be relieved. Having failed to find the Third Disciple before, he was really afraid that something might have happened to her; after all, this place was extremely dangerous. It wasn’t good to provoke the countless Beast Souls here. Yang Kai, touching his chin, asked, “If she can leave, why are you trapped here?”

Monster King replied with indignation, “If you can leave, why is this King trapped here? The Ancient Lands’ residents are greatly suppressed inside the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb. This King ventured into this place by mistake, and now this King can do nothing to leave!”

“It doesn’t look like your lifespan has come to an end. How did you come here anyway?” Yang Kai curiously looked at him.

Speaking of this, the Monster King looked like he would shed tears of blood. He heaved a sigh before replying, “Everyone has their shares of misfortune and blessings. This King came into this palace when this King was treading the sky.”

Like the Monster King here, who knows how many there were in the Ancient Lands that accidentally entered this place before their predestined time of death. However, after entering the tomb, they would really die, reaching the end of their life…

It was also thanks to this Monster King’s strength that he could reach this close to the exit, escaping from the pursuing Beast Souls. Otherwise, he would have already been dead and not even a pound of his flesh would remain.

After having replied to Yang Kai’s questions, the Monster King urged, “If you have something else to ask, ask quickly. This King can’t hold on for much longer.”

“I have no further questions,” Yang Kai shook his head before focusing his gaze on him.

Sensing the malicious intentions in his gaze, the Monster King’s heart skipped a beat, realizing that Yang Kai was going to burn the bridge after crossing the river. What Yang Kai had said earlier was complete nonsense. In a flash, the Monster King became extremely sad and angry. He had known that Humans never keep their word, but he still had a bit of hope in his heart. In the end, he was still pushed to his death though, so the Monster King felt extremely tired and weary…

He thought that Yang Kai would kill him immediately, but Yang Kai pondered for a moment instead before stating, “Hand over your Soul Brand, and you will live!”

And having tasted the sweetness once, Yang Kai was craving for more; he had controlled Yang You Wei to be at his beck and call, and had found the Third Disciple’s trail as soon as she appeared as a result. And Yang You Wei was just a Monster General, with a limited number of subordinates. If Yang Kai could subdue a Monster King, not to mention finding the Third Disciple, even his search for Xiao Xiao would be many times easier.

Furthermore, with this Monster King’s shelter, it would be much more convenient to walk around and do things in the Ancient Lands.

When the Monster King heard this, he immediately acted like a cat whose tail had been stepped on and snarled, “In your dreams!”

He was one of the thirty-two honourable Monster Kings, with a distinguished status and tyrannical strength, how could he be willing to be controlled by a Human? And he could easily tell that this Human was weaker than him, someone he could easily slap in half if he was at his peak. It would be nothing more than a joke to hand his Soul Brand to him.

Yang Kai didn’t pressure the Monster King though and just stated in a calm and relaxed manner, “Once someone dies, he can no longer do anything. Only by staying alive can you have hope.”

Monster King sneered, “It’s better than being enslaved and constantly being on the brink of death.”

Yang Kai glanced at him before indifferently speaking, “Monster King, don’t you have sons or daughters? If you die here, what will happen to your children? All the Monster Race members, who were once oppressed by you will certainly not be polite to your family. By the way, Monster King, you should have wives and concubines too, right? As a Monster King, your wives and concubines should be all beautiful and charming. After you die, I’m afraid those wives and concubines will quickly belong to others. They will be ravaged and savoured, again and again. They will never get to have the pleasure of being with you again. What a pity, your widows and children will have a hard time in the future!”

Hearing this, the Monster King’s dim face immediately turned as black as the bottom of a pot. He felt that Yang Kai’s every sentence was touching his sore spot, inevitably making him think of the misery his wives and children would have to face after his death.

Especially those wives and concubines, they would really be wantonly ravaged by others.

The Monster King couldn’t continue thinking about it anymore and his eyes turned red as he fumed through his nose.

Zhang Ruo Xi too was feeling extremely uncomfortable hearing this, her face flushing as she reflected, [How could Sir speak of something like this? It’s too shameful!]

The Monster King’s face changed as the speed with which the glowing specks escaping from his body suddenly increased. Apparently, he couldn’t suppress the passing of his vitality as his mood fluctuated.

Contrary to Yang Kai’s expectations though, the Monster King turned his head after a moment and said in a heavy voice, “This King would rather die than surrender!”

[He’s not bluffing!] Yang Kai was slightly stunned and began to admire him a little. When an ordinary person was about to die, he would agree to anything as long as he could be saved, just like Yang You Wei, who handed his Soul Brand over immediately. However, this Monster King seemed to have an iron will, which was really impressive.

With this line of attack having failed, Yang Kai could only choose even more extreme methods of persuasion. Yang Kai was still hoping for this Monster King to work for him, so he couldn’t kill him outright, instead turning to Zhang Ruo Xi and giving her a wink before saying, “Give him a taste.”

Zhang Ruo Xi was confused at first, but she was quite clever and soon understood what Yang Kai meant. She stretched her hand out and immediately summoned the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal.

The Monster King kept sneering, “If you want to kill me, you can stop wasting time and get on with it.” He looked as if he would calmly accept his death; it was quite a sight.

Yang Kai didn’t speak a word. Zhang Ruo Xi, on the other hand, constantly formed seals with her hands and then patted the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal, releasing a seemingly never-ending tide of Beast Souls of various shapes and sizes from it.

Each Beast Soul retained the appearance it had before its host’s death, and all of them were extraordinary and majestic. Judging by the aura, many of them weren’t any weaker than the Monster King, with some possibly even stronger.

The Monster King’s eyes widened as he blankly gawked at this sight.

Zhang Ruo Xi remarked, “This is the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal. It has strong suppression ability against the Souls of Monster Beasts. Are you going to surrender to my Sir, or should I use the Ten Thousand Beasts Soul to collect your Soul, stopping you from reincarnating ever again? Your choice!”

The Monster King’s sickly body immediately trembled, raising his finger and pointing at Yang Kai as he grudgingly scolded, “You… You’re going too far!”

He would rather die than surrender, and refused to hand over his Soul Brand just to save his skin, but now? With the appearance of the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal, he would not even be at peace after his death. His Soul would be received inside the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal.

By then, his life would be no worse than death. A slave either way.

Yang Kai grinned meaningfully, signalling Zhang Ruo Xi to put away the Ten Thousand Beasts Sea before he patted the Monster King’s shoulder and explained, “Don’t make it sound so ugly. Monster King, you would rather die than live on in dishonour; your heroic spirit is really admirable, but we belong to two different races. In the end, it’s not possible for me to simply save you out of good faith.”

“You just promised me,” Monster King glared at Yang Kai, but he could do nothing to him.

Yang Kai stroked his chin and stated, “Times have changed. As the saying goes, a wise man will submit to circumstances! Monster King, I will not make things difficult for you. If you surrender to me, I just want you to do some little things for me. When I’m done with them, I will leave the Ancient Lands. At that time, I will definitely return your freedom!”

“Do you think I will still believe you?” Monster King contemptuously looked at him.

Yang Kai stated with a snort, “Do you have any other choice?”

[This guy’s face flips faster than the page of a book.] The Monster King stared at him in a daze.

“I don’t have the time to waste on you. Either hand over your Soul Brand or I’ll immediately kill you and collect your Soul into the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal; your choice!” Yang Kai waved his hand; his tone was beyond question.

Meanwhile, Zhang Ruo Xi controlled the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal to fly over the Monster King’s head, giving the impression that if he didn’t agree, she would immediately do it.

The Monster King was unwilling, but he had no other choice. He could only grit his teeth and agree, “Take it!”

His voice was filled with grief, indignation, and unwillingness. This time, he was like a tiger that had gone down to the plains, leaving himself to be humiliated by the dogs, like a Phoenix in the cage mocked by the small birds.

Yang Kai immediately put on a smiling face, stretching his hand toward him.

The Monster King used a Secret Technique next, and soon, a wisp of golden light floated from his forehead. Yang Kai promptly grabbed it and took it inside his Knowledge Sea.

[I might have lost Yang You Wei in this tomb, but I have gained a Monster King instead. It’s not a loss.]

As for the Monster King, who had used the Secret Technique to surrender his Soul Brand, he had become incomparably weak and the glow around him collapsed, giving him the appearance of a man near death.

Yang Kai grabbed him, turned around, and sprinted straight towards the dark-grey door, asking, “It’s alright to get out from here, right?”

The Monster King slightly nodded, a complicated look in his eyes. He might have escaped alive, but he had lost his freedom. He was a slave now; it wasn’t something he wanted. Therefore, he didn’t appear to be happy being able to escape from the gates of death. Rather he was very depressed.

Not long after, Yang Kai had arrived before the door of light with the Monster King. He pushed his Emperor Qi, enveloping the Monster King and Zhang Ruo Xi before rushing straight into the door.

Everything before their eyes changed as the two Humans and one Monster Race member left the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb and reappeared in a lush and vibrant world.

They were surrounded by ancient trees that reached straight to the clouds, and Wild Force filled the air once more. Clearly they had appeared somewhere inside the Ancient Wild Lands.

[It was so easy to leave!] Yang Kai couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

Apparently, the Ten Thousand Spirits Toms was really only for the Ancient Wild Lands’ residents and didn’t restrict outsiders from entering or exiting it. Of course, one had to escape the pursuit of countless Beast Souls after entering, otherwise, they would find themselves on a road to Hell.

[This doesn’t look like the mountain valley where we entered the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb from. Where are we?]
