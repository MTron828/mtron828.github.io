What disappointed Yang Kai a little was the fact that these two supreme Sources only clashed with each other for less time than it took to drink a cup of tea before they settled down and retreated from each other.

However, he could tell that although it seemed that they came out on par in their clash, the fact was that the Phoenix True Fire was slightly inferior. It seemed his Golden Divine Dragon Source was a little bit stronger than the Phoenix True Fire.

Yang Kai was extremely excited by this discovery.

Right then, he grit his teeth and forced the Golden Divine Dragon Source once more.

The Phoenix True Fire was immediately caught off guard and was enveloped by the Dragon Source Strength. It constantly cried in anger and vigorously struggled, a terrifying display to behold.

Yang Kai quickly formed seals with his hands as he summoned the Sealed World Bead. Suddenly, an entrance to the Sealed World Bead opened up, sucking the Phoenix True Fire straight into the Small Sealed World.

Immediately afterwards, he mobilized the power of the Small World Bead and suppressed it.

After doing all this, Yang Kai staggered a few steps, his face completely pale as he sweat profusely, making him look like a fish out of water.

He hurriedly immersed his consciousness into the Small Sealed World to check the condition of the Phoenix True Fire. Immediately, he noticed that although the Phoenix True Fire was vehemently struggling, it was unable to free itself from the World Strength. Finally, Yang Kai put his heart to rest.

A sense of exhaustion finally struck him as Yang Kai slumped down on the ground.

Putting something as powerful as the Phoenix True Fire into the Small Sealed World had almost completely exhausted his Spiritual Energy, which was more exhaustive than taking over a hundred Embodiments into the Small Sealed World. It was proof in itself how Heaven-defying the Phoenix True Fire was.

What surprised Yang Kai was that everything went so smoothly. He had just tried to test the waters, that’s all. He hadn’t expected to succeed on first try. The credit for this mostly went to his Golden Divine Dragon Source. Had it not been there to suppress the Phoenix True Fire, Yang Kai would never have been able to obtain it, even with the Sealed World Bead on his side.

How could a supreme Source be taken away so easily?

Suddenly, a figure appeared from somewhere nearby and sat down cross-legged on the ground, watching Yang Kai with a look of disbelief. Like Yang Kai, his face was similarly pale.

Qi Hai!

Who would have thought that while everyone was chasing the Mountains and Rivers Bell, Qi Hai would unexpectedly use a concealment-type Secret Technique to hide here.

However, when the two Source Strengths clashed with each other, Qi Hai seemed to have suffered from the impact. From the look on his face, he seemed to be slightly injured right now. Presumably, he knew that his whereabouts had been exposed, so he no longer hid himself and had appeared in a frank and upright manner.

He was looking at Yang Kai with a complicated gaze, but he didn’t come forward right away, and neither did he show any hostility. He just stood there quietly and waited.

Although Yang Kai was recuperating in a cross-legged position, he was also paying a little attention to Qi Hai’s movements. He found this cunning refreshing. If it weren’t for the groan Qi Hai made when he was injured, Yang Kai would have never thought that there would be someone else beside him here.

Obviously, Qi Hai had some motive for secretly staying here. Yang Kai reckoned that it might have something to do with the Phoenix True Fire. In other words, Qi Hai had long known about the Phoenix True Fire being suppressed under the Mountains and Rivers Bell. That’s why he didn’t chase after the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

For a moment, both of them remained silent. The high temperature on the surface of the dark red star seemed to be rapidly dropping because the Phoenix True Fire was taken away. Hissing noises could be heard coming from everywhere because of the rapid drop in the temperature.

After half an hour, Yang Kai finally opened his eyes.

Even though adjusting his breathing for this half-hour wasn’t enough to fully replenish his Spiritual Energy, he wasn’t as tired as before. Not to mention, he also had the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus, which was nourishing his Soul every moment, so there was no need to deliberately restore his Spiritual Energy.

Next, he turned and deeply stared at Qi Hai.

This guy had been sitting there all the while. He didn’t disturb Yang Kai’s recovery, nor did it look like he had any malicious intentions, so what did he want?

However, Yang Kai could tell that Qi Hai wasn’t hostile to him. On the contrary, because of his shocking battle which had just taken place, it seemed Qi Hai’s gaze was filled with intense fear.

Seeing Yang Kai looking at him, Qi Hai’s expression turned serious as he quickly cupped his fists and introduced himself, “This one’s name is Qi Hai. I think you should know me by now. Friend, may I have the honour of knowing your name?”

“Yang Kai!” Yang Kai didn’t conceal his name, because he believed that he wasn’t famous. His fame couldn’t be compared to that of top disciples from top Sects, so it didn’t matter if he said his real name.

“So, it is Brother Yang Kai. Greetings!” Qi Hai cupped his fists again, wondering in his heart. He kept recalling the names of the elite disciples of the Sects of four territories of the Star Boundary, but he found that there was no Yang Kai among them.

“Brother Qi Hai, is there something I can do for you?” Yang Kai indifferently asked.

Qi Hai smiled in embarrassment as he stated, “You can indeed do something for me. This Qi has a presumptuous request…”

Yang Kai interrupted with a snort, “Since it’s a presumptuous request, then don’t ask.”

“Uh…” Qi Ha immediately choked, rendered speechless. He was only being polite by saying so and hadn’t expected Yang Kai to give such a harsh reply. This made him really helpless. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“I am a little curious though,” Yang Kai calmly gazed at Qi Hai, “Everyone chased after the Mountains and Rivers Bell, so why did Brother Qi Hai secretly stay here? Did you already know something?”

Qi Hai had displayed extensive knowledge about the past and knew many secrets that others had never even heard of. He was also the one who revealed information about the war between the Great Emperors. He might have hidden some of the insider information.

Qi Hai raised his brow but instead of replying, he counter-questioned Yang Kai, “What about Brother Yang? You flew off and then came back. You wouldn’t happen to know something too, would you?”

Yang Kai calmly answered, “I suddenly got a stomach ache, so I ran back to take a dump!”

Qi Hai’s face darkened upon hearing this.

Yang Kai continued, “Brother Qi Hai has been hiding here all the while. Didn’t you see me creating a big hole on the ground as soon as I came back? I was going to take care of my business here, but who would have thought that something like this would happen!”

The corners of Qi Hai’s mouth twitched as he stated, “Brother Yang’s luck is quite Heaven-defying!”

Qi Hai’s expression clearly stated that only some idiot would believe him, but Yang Kai didn’t mind. Instead, he meaningfully grinned and stated, “Brother Qi, if you know something, you might as well tell me about it. Since things have come to pass like this, there is no point in hiding it anymore.”

Qi Hai’s face slightly sank. Obviously, he was feeling frustrated, but after a long time, he heaved a sigh before he confirmed it with a nod, “I do know something.”

Yang Kai’s eyes immediately lit up as he stated, “This Yang is all ears.”

Qi Hai continued, “I knew that the Phoenix True Fire was suppressed under the Mountains and Rivers Bell!”

Yang Kai immediately voiced his doubt, “I’m extremely puzzled about this. Didn’t Yuan Ding Great Emperor and Martial Flame Great Emperor join hands to deal with Heaven Devouring Great Emperor? How did Yuan Ding Great Emperor end up using his Mountains and Rivers Bell to suppress Martial Flame Great Emperor’s Phoenix True Fire? Were they enemies?”

Qi Hai denied, shaking his head, “Brother Yang’s conjecture is wrong. Yuan Ding Great Emperor and Martial Flame Great Emperor were indeed companions, and they joined hands to deal with Heaven Devouring Great Emperor in that battle long ago, but there is a special reason why the Phoenix True Fire was suppressed by the Mountains and Rivers Bell.”

“Can you tell me the details?” Yang Kai earnestly asked.

Qi Hai pondered for a moment before answering, “Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was incredibly shrewd on top of being extremely powerful. He had many trump cards up his sleeve and it is not an exaggeration to say that he is the strongest expert in the Star Boundary’s entire history. However, even though he was a Great Emperor, he wasn’t immortal or indestructible. In his era, his cultivation had reached a level which no one could surpass, but he still wanted to go further. Brother Yang, can you guess what he wanted when his strength and status reached that level?”

Yang Kai wasn’t a fool. After listening to Qi Hai, he could pretty much guess it and an intelligent gleam flashed past his eyes as he muttered in surprise, “Eternal life?”

Qi Hai confirmed it with a nod, “Yes, Heaven Devouring Great Emperor wanted to have the longevity of the Heavens and Earth, sharing brilliance with the sun and moon!”

Yang Kai gasped in shock, “What a big appetite!”

Qi Hai chuckled, “You and I still haven’t reached that realm. If you or I had the cultivation and abilities of Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, we might also consider this, but it is not that easy to achieve immortality and have an indestructible body. However, rumour has it that there was a precious treasure formed just as the Heavens and Earth first came into being from the undivided chaos: the Immortal Tree!”

Yang Kai’s eyes twitched ever so slightly hearing this.

Qi Hai continued, not noticing this slight twitch, “According to the ancient rumours, if one can obtain the Immortal Tree and refine it, they can obtain an immortal and indestructible body!”

Yang Kai burst into laughter, “Does Brother Qi believe this kind of unfounded rumour?”

Qi Hai earnestly looked at him and asked, “Why? Don’t you believe it?”

Yang Kai quickly replied, “A tree that can make someone immortal and indestructible? That’s just some tale used to deceive children. Brother Qi Hai, you are already an adult, don’t believe such nonsense.”

Qi Hai shook his head and stated, “In this world, there are many marvellous and exotic treasures, each of which has an incomprehensible and unimaginable effect. The Immortal Tree can indeed make someone immortal and indestructible.”

Yang Kai feigned surprise and asked, “Is that true? Then does Brother Qi know how one can become immortal and indestructible using the Immortal Tree?”

Qi Hai bitterly smiled and stated, “I don’t know anything about that. How can it be that easy to see the Immortal Tree? Since ancient times, the people who have seen the Immortal Tree should not exceed five.”

Yang Kai rebuked in his heart, [Bullshit, when I got the Immortal Tree, at least six or seven people saw it.]

However, the fact that Qi Hai didn’t know how to use the Immortal Tree inevitably disappointed Yang Kai. He thought that since Qi Hai was so knowledgeable, perhaps he could get some information about the Immortal Tree from him.

After Yang Kai obtained the Immortal Tree back then, he had tried refining it many times in order to achieve an immortal and indestructible body.

But no matter what method Yang Kai tried, he discovered that he couldn’t refine the Immortal Tree at all. Back then, he was just an Origin Returning Realm cultivator, so it was reasonable to assume that his cultivation was simply too low. But now, he was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master, yet he still couldn’t refine it.

The biggest role the Immortal Tree played today was to bring great vitality to the Small Sealed World, allowing the spirit medicines in his medicine garden to grow rapidly. It shortened the growth cycle of these spirit medicines by a great deal. Occasionally, Yang Kai would also use the rich vitality exuded by the Immortal Tree to heal his injuries. Likewise, its leaves could also be used to instantly heal severe wounds. Besides this, it had no other effect. As for achieving an immortal and indestructible body, Yang Kai had no clue about this.
