There were only a few Emperors in Clear Sky Island, so Ling Yin Qin did not expect that the person she randomly bumped into during her trip would have the potential to break through to the Emperor Realm.

Once this Yang Kai made a breakthrough, he would certainly be able to occupy a seat in Clear Sky Island, and could in turn shelter her whole crew. However... only those who have lived in the Solitary Void Sealed World for a long time would understand that this place was simply a grave for cultivators. A cultivator whose cultivation did not regress with time here was already considered blessed, and even if one was lucky enough to sense an incoming breakthrough, there were very few who could succeed.

Ling Yin Qin had seen too many people who failed to break through in this damned place, causing them to lose all their cultivation and become crippled.

So, after her initial shock, the gaze which Ling Yin Qin directed at Yang Kai became sympathetic. She could tell that Yang Kai was still young, so to be able to reach Third-Order Dao Source Realm proved his aptitude was exceptional. He should be the young rising star of a great Sect outside, and given time, it may not be impossible for him to get a glimpse of the mysteries of the Emperor Realm.

But here... The possibility of failure was very high.

Yang Kai’s face turned anxious. He had no idea why Ling Yin Qin was looking at him full of sympathy. Receiving no answer from her for a while, he pursued the question again, “Big Sister Ling, do you know anything that can help?”

“Are you really going to break through?” Lin Yin Qin couldn’t help but suggest, “If you’re absolutely confident you can do it, then never break through in this Solitary Void Sealed World! You’re better off cutting off your own cultivation!”

Yang Kai was dumbfounded and he subconsciously asked, “Why?”

Jiao Yi said, “Brother Yang, the Solitary Void Sealed World is not a suitable place for a breakthrough. You know as well as us that the endless stream of Disruption Force that flows in this world. Ninety-nine percent of the people who dared to break through here have failed. Big Sister is just watching out for you.”

Yang Kai was truly shocked now. He had previously thought that this was not a good place for a breakthrough, but he didn’t expect it to be so serious. It did not seem like Zhang Ruo Xi’s Qi fluctuations could be suppressed at all, and if she cut off her cultivation as Ling Yin Qin suggested, then Zhang Ruo Xi would never be able to advance to the Dao Source Realm in her life and could only remain at the Origin King Realm.

Since she would be extinguishing her own Martial Dao, no pill or treasure would be able to help her recover.

The rest of the crew members were looking at Yang Kai with sympathy, as if he had suffered a great misfortune. They did not care about him crashing into Ling Yin Qin as much anymore either. It would be too cruel to focus on such petty matters as that when a young man before them was about to come to the end of his Martial Dao.

Yang Kai was only taken aback for a moment before his look turned into one of resolution, “Please, I still wish to seek Big Sister Ling’s guidance.”

When Ling Yin Qin saw how insistent Yang Kai was, she knew it was useless to dissuade him, so she could only say, “I have a High-Grade Spirit Purifying Array here. It may be able to help you.”

There were four grades of Spirit Purifying Array; low, medium, high, and peak.

These days, during his chats with Jiao Yi, Yang Kai got to know that the Spirit Purifying Arrays set up in the ship rooms were all low grade, because the higher the grade of the array, the more expensive it became to arrange. The price of each higher grade array would be at least ten times that of the previous grade. Ling Yin Qin’s group were struggling cultivators in this Solitary Void Sealed World and did not have the financial resources to hire someone to set up a more powerful Spirit Purifying Array.

Yang Kai also did not expect her to actually have a High-Grade Spirit Purifying Array.

The more advanced the grade of a Spirit Purifying Array, the greater its effects were. Spirit Purifying Arrays were like a net that filters out the Disruption Force from the world while also hindering the flow of World Energy. So, regardless of how dense the World Energy was, places with Spirit Purifying Arrays set up would have less dense World Energy available. The higher the grade of a Spirit Purifying Array, the less World Energy it blocked out, so the World Energy available within would become denser, making cultivation inside much more effective.

Yang Kai was in great joy, “Many thanks, Big Sister Ling!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

When Ling Yin Qin said she was going to take out her High-Grade Spirit Purifying Array, the other crew members on the ship could not help but pale in response. Jiao Yi even whispered, “Big Sister Ling, that Spirit Purifying Array...”

Ling Yin Qin interrupted him with a wave of her hand and took out a set of array flags before handing them to Yang Kai, “If you can’t do it, then don’t force it.”

Then, she stuffed a jade slip into Yang Kai’s hands as well, “This is how to set up the array. It’s very simple, you’ll understand if you look through this.”

“I’ll remember it.” Yang Kai nodded sincerely. Even though he had no idea where this High-Grade Spirit Purifying Array came from, he knew how immensely precious it was to Ling Yin Qin just from the looks of the crew members alone. Otherwise, it was impossible for her not to take it out to use normally.

Based on what Yang Kai knew, the Spirit Purifying Array set up in Ling Yin Qin’s room was also merely a low-grade one.

He also had no idea what the story behind this High-Grade Spirit Purifying Array was; however, he decided inwardly that he was going to give Ling Yin Qin compensation after the matter was over.

“I still need to bother Big Sister Ling with one more question. Are there any islands nearby here?” Yang Kai asked.

Ling Yin Qin looked up and said to a cultivator whose face was covered with a big beard, “Hand me the map.”

The cultivator took out a piece of beast skin from his Space Ring and immediately spread it out in front of Ling Yin Qin. Yang Kai also went over to take a look, but he couldn’t read it properly.

Ling Yin Qin’s gaze swept over the map for a while before pointing to a certain spot, “Southeast, five hundred kilometres from here is a small island.”

Yang Kai cupped his fists, “Many thanks!”

By the time he finished speaking, his body had already teleported and disappeared from sight.

The entire crowd was shocked, and even Ling Yin Qin’s beautiful face paled as none of them saw how Yang Kai left.

Even though she knew that Yang Kai’s cultivation was at the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, she never expected him to be so powerful. Just from his Movement Skill alone, Ling Yin Qin was unable to find any traces of Yang Kai at all. If a man like this wanted to kill her, she would be completely defenceless.

Instantly, Ling Yin Qin was feeling thankful that she had strictly forbidden her crew from picking a fight with Yang Kai. Otherwise, nobody would even know how their entire crew ended up dead.

“Senior Brother, he’s... actually going to break through to the Emperor Realm?” Someone murmured quietly from the side.

Ling Yin Qin looked over and saw Liu Xian Yun standing there worriedly.

She followed Yang Kai out of the room and heard the conversation clearly, so she was a bit shocked. Unlike Ling Yin Qin who did not know Yang Kai well, Liu Xian Yun had been cultivating next to Yang Kai these days and she did not notice any signs of him breaking through at all, so how was he suddenly breaking through to the Emperor Realm?

But after the shock passed, she only felt concerned because Ling Yin Qin had put it very clearly that breaking through in the Solitary Void Sealed World was extremely risky.

“Big Sister Ling, my Senior Brother, he...” Liu Xian Yun looked towards Ling Yin Qin.

The latter sighed and said truthfully, “There is little hope, and it is basically impossible to accomplish.”

Liu Xian Yun’s face paled, and she almost toppled over from shock. An amazing talent like Yang Kai was going to be ruined here in this damned place? And the root cause of this was her. If they had not encountered each other in Marsh City, then Yang Kai would never have stood up for her, much less attracted the attention of an old monster like Yao Chang Jun. Then, Yang Kai wouldn’t have been chased all the way to the depths of the Solitary Void Mountain Range and gotten swallowed up by the Solitary Void Sealed World.

The more she thought about it, the guiltier Liu Xian Yun felt towards Yang Kai. If he failed to break through here, then whether he became crippled or died, it would all be her fault.

“Big Sister, that Spirit Purifying Array was what Big Brother Zhou gave you back then. How could you...” Jiao Yi looked at Ling Yin Qin with lament.

Ling Yin Qin answered, “He’s in urgent need of it, so what’s the harm in lending it to him?”

Jiao Yi said, “But if he damages it...”

“If you needed to break through, I would also lend it to you.”

The crew knew that Ling Yin Qin was not lying, her character was just like this, cold on the outside, warm on the inside. Yang Kai was just a hitchhiker who had nothing to do with her, but she still lent such a precious Spirit Purifying Array to Yang Kai.

But the preciousness of that Spirit Purifying Array was not in value, but rather the sentimentality of it for Ling Yin Qin, so even though everyone knew that Ling Yin Qin had a high-grade Spirit Purifying Array, they never asked her to take it out for everyone to use. Everyone just used their own meagre Spirit Purifying Arrays, slowly cultivating to stem the speed of their cultivation’s regression.

“Spread the order, we will anchor here for a few days. You should all disperse as well,” Ling Yin Qin waved her hand and excused everyone.

The dozen crew members all looked at each other, not daring to say anything more and left.

“Senior Brother Jiao, that Big Brother Zhou you mentioned just now... Who is he?” Liu Xian Yun followed Jiao Yi towards the cabin and asked.

Jiao Yi said, “He was Big Sister’s partner. When Big Sister and Big Brother Zhou both fell into this damned place, he brought us together to scrape out a living, but one time at sea, Big Brother Zhou was killed by a Sea Beast while protecting everyone. The only thing he left behind before his death was that Spirit Purifying Array. He sold off his own artifact to buy it, and if he still had that artifact, then Big Brother Zhou might not have died.”

When the past was mentioned, Jiao Yi’s emotions began to fluctuate and his fists were clenched, clearly showing that he received a lot of care from the man surnamed Zhou and had long recognized him as a family member.

“Big Brother Zhou really did treat Big Sister Ling well,” Liu Xian Yun muttered. For the sake of his partner, he was willing to sell off his artifact in order to buy a Spirit Purifying Array. It seemed like a stupid thing to do, but who could criticize him?

“Now you know how precious that Spirit Purifying Array is to Big Sister, right?” Jiao Yi gritted his teeth, “If your Senior Brother damages that Spirit Purifying Array, I, Old Jiao, will be the first one to not let him off!”

Even though Jiao Yi had great conversations with Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun during these days and received a lot of Source Crystals from him, he still stood firmly on Ling Yin Qin’s side when it came to that High-Grade Spirit Purifying Array.

But after the fierce talk, Jiao Yi added a little vexingly, “I apologize, Old Jiao’s temper is bad. I shouldn’t be saying this to you. We don’t even know if your Senior Brother can return safely.”

“It’s fine, I understand how Senior Brother Jiao feels.” Liu Xian Yun waved her hands. She couldn’t help but fantasize about Yang Kai leaving something behind for her too. It didn’t matter whether it was valuable or not, she would still treasure it.
