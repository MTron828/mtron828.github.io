“In that case, come back with me to the Qiu Family!” Qiu Yi Meng suddenly proposed. Her eyes were completely sincere.

This was definitely a good opportunity, Qiu Yi Meng could also see that the relationship between Yang Kai and Shan Qing Luo was complicated, if at this time she could put out attractive enough conditions, she had no doubt she could get him to join her Qiu Family, if so then this time’s sufferings and tribulations would also be considered somewhat worthwhile.

Qiu Yi Meng was a decisive woman, and she naturally knew what to do at this time.

“Young Lady Qiu must be joking, right?” Yang Kai stared back at her with indifference as he sneered. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“On the contrary, I’m very serious.” Qiu Yi Meng brushed her hair back behind her ear. “I can offer you even better treatment than you receive here; any cultivation resources you desire and any number of beauties to serve you!”

“Elder Sister Qiu ...” Luo Xiao Man almost yelped in surprise. She never dreamed Qiu Yi Meng would immediately offer such rich incentives to win over Yang Kai.

The Qiu Family was one of the Eight Great Families in the Great Han Dynasty. It was an overlord that possessed a rich heritage and vast foundations. Many cultivators from all over the world would gladly sell their souls for just the chance to join them. However, the Qiu Family had always had eyes above their heads and wouldn’t accept just any elite or master into their ranks.

But now... even if it were a number of high level Immortal Ascension Boundary masters, it should cost such a big price, right?

Was this little brat really worth all this?

However, although Luo Xiao Man thought Qiu Yi Meng’s actions were surprising, having stayed together with her for so long, she knew that she always had extremely accurate judgement.

Since she dared to offer up such lucrative incentives to recruit him, maybe this man really was worth it!

At that moment, Luo Xiao Man no longer dared to underestimate Yang Kai anymore and even did her best to observe him more discerningly.

“How about it? I’m serious about my offer.” Qiu Yi Meng said as she looked solemnly at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s brow wrinkled. He hadn’t expected that not only was this woman’s cultivation and aptitude outstanding, but her heart was also firm and decisive. Based on the performance he had seen from her over this short period of time, he easily concluded that if this woman didn’t fall early, she would certainly achieve great heights in the future!

“If that’s not enough, if you wish to marry a woman from my Qiu Family, other than myself, I can promise you right here and now. I have a younger cousin who is quite talented and beautiful...”

Yang Kai suddenly looked at her playfully, “You can’t tempt me with beauties.”

Hearing him say this, Qiu Yi Meng couldn’t hold back a laugh, and her vibrant eyes flashed a mischievous light, “Really? But just now...”

“That was just an accident,” Yang Kai replied calmly and didn’t show the slightest signs of embarrassment or guilt.

“Fine fine, then do you agree or not.” said Qiu Yi Meng, but seeing Yang Kai still maintaining his indifferent look, she couldn’t help but feel more and more annoyed.

If it were any other young men, if she had offered up such attractive conditions, she was certain they would immediately become obedient and agree, but from what she could observe, this little bastard before her didn’t even seem the slightest bit tempted at all.

[Just how greedy is this little bastard?]

“No thanks, I’m fine with how things are right now.” Yang Kai replied decisively not wanting to waste any more time with her.

Qiu Yi Meng’s face twitched slightly before resuming her smile, “Well, think about it, if you ever change your mind, feel free to find me. The Qiu Family’s door will always be open to you!”

From their time together, she knew that he wasn’t the kind of man who could be coerced. The only way to win him over was to give him the freedom to choose, but continuing to press the issue would only serve to annoy him. Secretly she was somewhat upset with herself for acting too impulsively.

However, seeing him acting so carefree, Qiu Yi Meng couldn’t stop herself from feeling annoyed, which caused her to become slightly anxious.

“In any case, could you at least put in a few words for Xiao Man and I to the Beguiling Demon Queen?”

“If I see her again,” Yang Kai wrinkled his brow and shrugged. “As you can see, I’m a prisoner here too, my accommodations just happen to be better than yours.”

“Good!” Qiu Yi Meng smiled happily, “Either way, I offer you my thanks, if we can survive this ordeal, when I return to my Qiu Family I’ll be sure to advocate on behalf of your High Heaven Pavilion!”

A light flickered across Yang Kai’s eyes for the first time as he stared back at her, resuming their usual calm a moment later.

Qiu Yi Meng’s last words had finally won her some of Yang Kai’s favor.

“Suit yourselves!” Yang Kai nodded before closing his eyes and resuming his meditation.

Qiu Yi Meng continued to observe him for a moment and quickly realized that this youth had actually entered a state of cultivation right in front of her and Luo Xiao Man’s faces. Exchanging a dumbfound glance with her partner, she couldn’t help shrugging her shoulders, saying to Luo Xiao Man, “Let’s go.”

“That’s right,” Yang Kai suddenly said, “If you want to use the bath on the lower floor just let Yun Li, Ruo Yu, and Ruo Qing know so they can prepare the warm water, I won’t be leaving this room for a while.”

Qiu Yi Meng couldn’t help blushing once more, as she understood in that moment that her entire conversation with Luo Xiao Man as they came up the stairs had been heard by him.

“Thank you. I hope we won’t be enemies again in the future!” Qiu Yi Meng stared deeply at Yang Kai as she said in a low voice.

Downstairs, Luo Xiao Man, unable to hold back any longer, softly asked, “Elder Sister Qiu, is that guy really worth so much in your eyes?”

Qiu Yi Meng’s expression remained dignified as she pondered for a moment before nodding, “En, of all men I have ever come across, he is the most unfathomable. On top of that, it’s only been half a month since we last met, yet it seems like he has become stronger. Although his realm is still lower than my own, whenever I’m in front of him, I always feel a kind of intangible pressure from him.”

“That may be because our True Qi is sealed! If it weren’t for that, we wouldn’t necessary need to fear him!

“No...” Qiu Yi Meng slowly shook her head, “I trust my instincts! I believe his talent is even higher than the Liu Family’s Liu Qing Yao!”

“Ah... you think he’s superior to the Eight Great Families’ first Young Lord?” Luo Xiao Man’s eyes filled with astonishment.

“I’m only counting the Seven Great Families. After all, the Yang Family can’t be taken into account.” Smiling wryly, Qiu Yi Meng involuntarily thought about the way the Yang Family cultivated its direct disciples.

Thinking about it, she suddenly noticed that Yang Kai’s surname was also Yang. He couldn’t be...

It shouldn’t be. Although she didn’t recognize all of the Yang Family’s Young Lords, she did at least know their various ages. Only one of the Yang Family’s direct descendants, the youngest, had a similar age to Yang Kai, and it was said that this Young Lord had been born with a congenital defect and lacked any cultivation aptitude at all.

However, his ruthless, overbearing, and domineering attitude was exactly the same as the Yang Family’s.

“Fortunately, he has no background. If he already had a significant backer, heh...” Qiu Yi Meng shook her head with a smile. Since she was born, she had always had eyes atop her head, and very few Young Lords had ever been worth a second glance from her, but somehow this one was different. Something about him demanded she pays attention to him.

While the pair chatted, they came outside to find Yun Li and asked her to help prepare some hot water before vigilantly entering the first-floor bath.

Oblivious to all of their concerns, Yang Kai simply remained on the second floor and continued his cultivation.

The demons which had built up over the past few months inside Yang Kai’s heart had been completely expunged with the assistance of Bi Luo’s cherry red lips.

This allowed him to relax greatly as he re-entered a state of cultivation.

With all of his fatigue and stress seemingly relieved, for the first time in more than a year, Yang Kai felt renewed both inside and out.

He also had a faint perception that his mental state had actually improved.

With the enhancement of his mood, along with relaxing both physically and mentally, the speed with which he cultivated increased noticeably.

Yang Kai didn’t stop studying the True Alchemic Way, even though he no longer had any Spiritual Energy supplementing pills.

After a session, once he exhausted his Spiritual Energy, he would wait a few hours to allow his Soul to slowly recover while circulating his True Yang Secret Art, not wasting a single moment.

His Tempered Body Record, as well as the Incense burner from the blank book also played a role at this time. Both of them were things which had become somewhat dust-laden after a long period of not being used.

Now that he had a period of relative calm, Yang Kai took the chance to bring them out again.

Three days later.

Shan Qing Luo returned to Fragrance City.

One of the first things she did was visit Tranquil Phoenix Pavilion.

After a few days had passed, this devilish woman seemed more and more flirtatious and alluring. Her whole being constantly exuded an aura of unparalleled seduction, meanwhile, her slim exquisite body seemed to appear delicate and fragile yet, in fact, contained a tremendous explosive strength.

Not only was she amongst the most beautiful woman in the world, she was also one of its apex masters, something no one could deny.

Her watery enchanting eyes stared into Yang Kai’s as she giggled charmingly, “Little bastard, you’ve been quite well behaved these past few days I see.”

Yang Kai remained indifferent and coldly snorted, “I have some self-knowledge!”

“Now now don’t be so upset.” Shan Qing Luo lightly replied, “I had ordered a few beauties to serve you well, yet how is it that I hear from Yun Li that you haven’t eaten any of them yet? I didn’t think you would be so studious.” Shan Qing Luo looked at him somewhat surprised.

“Naturally.” Yang Kai said, but his conscience actually felt somewhat guilty.

Shan Qing Luo simply laughed though and leaned in closer to him as she whispered into his ear, “Bi Luo’s technique isn’t bad, right?”

“So-so...” Yang Kai instantly blushed upon realizing he had been exposed and quickly changed the topic, “You temptress, what exactly do you want in coming here?”

“Nothing much.” Shan Qing Luo’s tender body twisted as she put on a shy face, gently sat down atop the bed next to him, and smiled invitingly, “Are you bored staying here already?

“What do you think?” Yang Kai glared back at her coldly.

Shan Qing Luo just shrugged, “Why not go out for a walk then?”

“Where can I go?”

“Where do you want to go? No one’s stopping you.”

Yang Kai stared at her for a moment before processing what she had just said. Suspicion flashed across his eyes, “Are you saying, I can leave here?”

“Of course, when did I ever say you couldn’t leave here? Haha...”

“You... you...” Yang Kai nearly choked. His stomach was full of grievances.

“Alright alright, don’t be so angry.” Shan Qing Luo suddenly became serious and solemnly said, “This time I came here to tell you specifically that you’re free to leave here. After all, in order to win over a man, you can’t simply lock him up, I understand at least that much.”

“Yes yes, you keeping me here doesn’t mean you can keep my heart!” Yang Kai nodded righteously and eagerly proposed, “Then that Soul Seeking Seal...”

“Let’s keep that for now, or else how would I ever find you again?” Shan Qing Luo nibbled her red lips, appearing somewhat sad.

“Alright,” Yang Kai don’t try to force her.

Although Shan Qing Luo said he could leave, Yang Kai didn’t feel too happy about it. At the very least, he didn’t experience the excitement he had imagined he would.

Probably because he knew that this devilish woman didn’t have the slightest malicious intent towards him, so although she had technically trapped him here these past few days, he didn’t actually have any particular resentment towards her.

Not to mention, using her name, Yang Kai had also fished a lot of benefits without suffering any loses.

If it weren’t for Yang Kai having seen her deepest inner thoughts when he had inadvertently invaded her Knowledge Sea, he would have long ago stopped acting polite with her.
