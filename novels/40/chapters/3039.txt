“You think it’s fair as well?” Madam Hua stared at Yang Kai with narrowed eyes, a glint of ferocity flashing across their depths.

“Yes,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Step aside then. I’ll settle accounts with you later,” Madam Hua waved her hand and demanded impatiently.

With a grin, Yang Kai extended his hand suddenly and made a grabbing gesture.

The woman, who had been slapped earlier, was shocked. Thinking that Yang Kai wanted to attack her again and hurriedly stepped backwards. However, Yang Kai didn’t seem to have the intention of harming her, which made her look like she had overreacted. With her face flushing, she was utterly embarrassed.

Just then, a splashing sound could be heard, and after Yang Kai withdrew his hand, a Golden Backed Red Carp magically appeared in his grip. Upon closer look, that fish was none other than Madam Hua’s pet, which she had kept for more than a decade.

Nobody could see clearly how he obtained the red carp. He just seemed to have stretched out his hand, upon which the red carp called Xiao Hong magically appeared.

The woman holding the fish tank was stunned for a moment, but after taking a look at the red carp in Yang Kai’s hand, she shifted her attention to her fish tank and in an instant, her beautiful face turned pale as she screamed, “Ah!”

With a livid expression, Madam Hua came to her senses and snarled, “What are you doing? Release Xiao Hong now!”

“It’s just a red carp. Why do you see it as a treasure? In my eyes, it’s nothing more than a piece of trash.” Yang Kai put on a sneer.

At that instant, Madam Hua had a horrendous premonition and she hurriedly demanded, “I’ll count down from three now. If you don’t release it, I’ll kill you!” Right after she finished speaking, she started counting down, “Three!”

*Pu…*

When Madam Hua heard that, her pupils contracted as she watched Yang Kai tighten his grip and kill her fish. Although Xiao Hong was a Fifth-Order Monster Beast, it couldn’t possibly survive Yang Kai’s attack.

Upon impact, the fish broke into two as its head and body fell to the ground. Turning back into its original 10-metre form, it was dead when it touched the ground. Yuan Wu gasped and stared at Yang Kai in disbelief, as he didn’t expect that this young man was so brash.

Although the red carp wasn’t valuable, it was a pet that had accompanied Madam Hua for more than a decade. Earlier, Madam Hua had already blown her top because the red carp’s scales had been damaged. Now that the fish was dead, there was no way she would let Yang Kai off.

[This brat is practically dead meat now!] Yuan Wu was elated as he gazed at Yang Kai, taking pleasure in the latter’s imminent misfortune. He still remembered vividly that he was humiliated by Yang Kai a few days ago. He didn’t have the ability to get his revenge, but it would be great solace for him if he could get Yang Kai killed with Madam Hua’s help.

Lu San Niang and her daughter were dumbfounded as well. They met Yang Kai not long ago and only knew that he was Li Jiao’s friend; however, they didn’t expect him to be such a reckless man who had no regard for Madam Hua at all.

[What should we do now? We’re basically doomed. Earlier, the issue could be solved if we just let Madam Hua vent her fury by punishing us, but now…] Lu San Niang was extremely anxious. She blamed Yang Kai for his recklessness, but at the same time, she also blamed herself for dragging him into this matter. [How will I explain myself to Li Jiao in the future?]

“H-H-How dare you kill Xiao Hong!” The woman holding the fish tank turned completely pale as she stared at Yang Kai as her heart sank. [Where did this madman come from? Doesn’t he understand that his action will bring dreadful consequences?]

The other woman was flabbergasted at the sight as she was rooted to the spot. Even with her hand still covering her face, she couldn’t feel any pain at all.

A myriad of expressions came over all of them except the culprit, who didn’t seem to be perturbed by what he had just done. Yang Kai looked mockingly at Madam Hua and sneered, “An eye for an eye? How are you going to make me pay the price now?”

Madam Hua’s chest heaved in outrage as her pretty face contorted. Turning hysterical, she snarled, “Kill him! Kill him now!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

She couldn’t take it anymore. Initially, she just wanted to obtain justice for Xiao Hong by lecturing the person who had harmed it. However, after she saw Lu San Niang, she changed her mind and decided to humiliate that woman who had been her archnemesis for centuries. Now that her precious fish was killed though, she wanted nothing less than an end to Yang Kai’s life. Xiao Hong was dead, so she could only relieve the fury in her chest by killing him!

Her order was loud and clear, but no one took any action. The two women who had tagged along were also Fu Chi’s playthings, but they were only Third-Order Dao Source Realm. Facing Yang Kai, who was a First-Order Emperor, they didn’t have the courage to step forward.

Furthermore, judging from what Yang Kai had just done, it was apparent that he was a madman who knew no bounds. The two women would only humiliate themselves if they tried to challenge Yang Kai, so they remained on the spot and appeared to be hesitant.

Seeing that, Madam Hua growled, “What are you waiting for? Do you want me to make a move myself?”

If Madam Hua was forced to make a move herself, the two women would be doomed as well. Left with no choice, they traded glances and pounced at Yang Kai. Although they were no match for Yang Kai, they still had to take action; otherwise, they would be punished harshly after the incident. In the blink of an eye, they reached both sides of Yang Kai.

Despite being Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators, they had lost almost all of their battle instincts after spending so many years on Dragon Island only competing with other women for Fu Chi’s attention. Hence, they couldn’t even utilize 70% of their real strength. With that said, even if they could make full use of their power, they would still be no match for Yang Kai, who was in the Emperor Realm.

Yang Kai didn’t seem to have made any move, but the two women were sent flying back in the next instant, spraying out blood in mid-air. After they fell to the ground, all their Source Qi had dispersed, and they couldn’t even get to their feet.

“How dare you!” Madam Hua yelled in a high-pitched voice that could damage a person’s eardrums.

Not only did Yang Kai kill Xiao Hong, but he also had the guts to hurt the women on this Spirit Island. His action was beyond Madam Hua’s ability to fathom. At that instant, her entire body was trembling as she was about to explode like a volcano.

Nevertheless, she had been living a luxurious life for years, and although she was utterly incensed, she didn’t have the intention of making a move herself. Hence, she shot Yuan Wu a glare and demanded, “What are you waiting for? Kill him for me!”

Instantly, Yuan Wu appeared to be on pins and needles. If he could defeat Yang Kai, he would have charged forward without Madam Hua telling him to do so. It was beneficial for him to strike up a relationship with Madam Hua, and the chance was right before his eyes. Despite that, he couldn’t seize it.

He had confronted Yang Kai a few days ago and despite the fact that Yang Kai’s cultivation was one Minor Realm lower than his, Yuan Wu knew was no match for him at all. If it weren’t because Yang Kai decided to let him go, he would have lost his life then and there.

This time, he had tagged along with Madam Hua to teach Yang Kai a lesson; however, he didn’t expect that not only did Yang Kai have the guts to kill Madam Hua’s pet, but he also dared to harm her subordinates. [He must be out of his mind!]

“I…” Yuan Wu uttered hesitantly as he didn’t have the courage to fight with Yang Kai.

Madam Hua threatened coldly, “You dare to disobey my order? Good, I’ll go back now and tell Senior Fu Chi that all of you have partnered up to shame me!”

“Please wait, Madam!” Yuan Wu was flabbergasted as he cursed at Madam Hua in his heart. He was just there to watch the show, so he wondered how he ended up being dragged into this matter. [What an unexpected ordeal!]

At that moment, he was truly flustered. If Madam Hua told Fu Chi what happened, it would mean the end of Yuan Wu’s life.

He didn’t believe that a Dragon Clan member was willing to spare a subordinate’s life. Although he was also a Dragonborn, he was just an insignificant hybrid in the Dragon Clan’s eyes. Hence, they would just kill him as they pleased.

[This is so unfortunate! If I knew this would be the outcome, I wouldn’t have come here in the first place! Now, I’ve been put in a tight spot.] Yuan Wu couldn’t help but feel like giving his past self a slap to the face.

Since he could never offend Madam Hua, he had no choice but to look apprehensively at Yang Kai. Upon seeing Yang Kai’s glare, Yuan Wu started shuddering and recalled that Yang Kai was able to suppress his bloodline with ease a few days ago. Suddenly thinking of something, he growled with a ruthless expression, “Madam Hua, rest assured. I’ll teach this bastard a lesson on your behalf!”

At the same time, he secretly spoke to Yang Kai by Divine Sense, “I have no choice. Please don’t blame me.” Upon finishing his words, he pushed his Emperor Qi and launched himself at Yang Kai, making the exact same move as the two women had done earlier.

With a gratified expression, Madam Hua shot an insidious glare at Yang Kai. She had been humiliated this day, but as long as she could capture Yang Kai, she had many ways to torture him. She could feel that, just like herself, Yang Kai was in the First-Order Emperor Realm, while Yuan Wu, a Dragonborn, was in the Second-Order Emperor Realm. Basically, Yuan Wu should be the more powerful man between the two of them. Since Yuan Wu had made a move, there was no way he would fail in his attempt to capture Yang Kai.

Meanwhile, Madam Hua was coming up with ideas on how to torment Yang Kai to vent her anger. [Since you have the guts to kill Xiao Hong, I’ll make life a living hell for you!]

Upon hearing a man’s scream though, Madam Hua was rooted to the spot as her well-laid plan evaporated before her eyes. Yuan Wu, who appeared to be fierce just now, was struck with a palm and sent flying backwards. The blood he sprayed out in mid-air was dazzling under the sunlight.

[What just happened? What is going on?] Madam Hua couldn’t believe what she saw. [Yuan Wu was supposed to be able to defeat that young man so why was he defeated instead? What happened?]

Yuan Wu landed on the ground with a loud thud as he convulsed for a bit and passed out. In an instant, Madam Hua’s face fell dramatically.
