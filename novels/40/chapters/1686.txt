Chapter 1686, Submitting And Joining

After a short silence, however, someone stepped forward. It was a man who appeared to be in his forties or fifties. After walking up to Yang Kai, this man cupped his fists with a solemn expression, “This one is Extreme Path Sect’s Sect Master Wang Tai Zhen, I am willing to submit to High Heaven Sect and obey Sect Master Yang’s dispatch in the future!”

“My Flame Shield Union is willing to obey Sect Master Yang’s commands.”

“Extreme Martial Pavilion is willing...”

...

Within moments, more than a dozen Sects of all sizes expressed their willingness and stepped forward to salute Yang Kai.

Yang Kai stood in place, his attitude was neither warm nor cold, appearing quite unreadable.

As time passed, more and more great forces submitted.

In the face of absolute strength, if they still did not recognize reality, it was no different than courting death! These people had finally escaped to High Heaven Sect and found refuge, so how could they be willing to die here?

Although Yang Kai’s approach was a little overbearing and his attitude also made them somewhat uncomfortable, in the end, this was what they needed to do to survive.

“Coloured Glass Sect is willing to join High Heaven Sect. From now on, there shall be no Coloured Glass Sect on Shadowed Star. Please show kindness and accept us into your ranks, Sect Master Yang!” A beautiful woman walked in front of Yang Kai and her eyes flashed with a determined and sincere light.

As soon as this statement came out, the masters who had expressed their allegiance just now all gawked towards the one who had spoken, disbelief covering their faces.

Yang Kai also finally showed a look of interest upon noticing that he knew this woman.

It was none other than the current Sect Master of Coloured Glass Sect, Gong Ao Fu!

Strictly speaking, she was Dai Yuan’s Honoured Master, but for some special reasons, Dai Yuan was not favoured by Gong Ao Fu. On the contrary, Yin Su Die was treated quite well by Gong Ao Fu, always accompanying her, and was cultivated vigorously.

Even now, the beautiful Yin Su Die stood beside Gong Ao Fu, even daringly casting a few gazes of admiration towards Yang Kai.

With a slight grin on his face, Yang Kai stared at Gong Ao Fu deeply before slowly asking, “Does Sect Master Gong understand what she is saying?”

Gong Ao Fu smiled lightly as she lifted her hand and brushed her long black hair back behind her ear and said lightly, “This Mistress is not a child, so she understands. Sect Master Yang need not worry, this Mistress can take full responsibility for her words.”

Submitting and joining had completely different meanings. The Sects that had chosen to submit to Yang Kai would from now on have to obey his orders, but they would not truly belong to High Heaven Sect, they would retain their Sect name and keep their statuses within it. One day, when they left High Heaven Sect, they would also return to their own headquarters and continue the operation of their Sect.

But Gong Ao Fu said she wished to join. Joining High Heaven Sect meant she would need to disband the current Coloured Glass Sect. In other words, Coloured Glass Sect’s history would end with her generation. If Yang Kai was willing to accept them, they would become disciples of High Heaven Sect.

At that point, Yang Kai would be in full control of their destinies. In the future, they would never be able to leave High Heaven Sect or revive Coloured Glass Sect without Yang Kai’s consent. Leaving without permission would be the same as betraying the Sect, an offence none could tolerate.

This was an extremely bold decision. The Origin Returning Realm masters in the square were shocked, and their expressions fluctuated greatly; but soon, many showed looks of admiration.

They naturally understood what Gong Ao Fu was thinking. Yang Kai had returned and displayed astonishing personal strength. On top of that, only High Heaven Sect remained safe on Shadowed Star. Joining High Heaven Sect at this time was undoubtedly the right choice as they would undoubtedly receive much greater attention and care.

But even understanding this, if they were really asked to give up their Sect and join High Heaven Sect instead, most would probably be unwilling.

Cultivators always regarded their origin and its inheritance very seriously! All of them proudly wore their Sect’s emblems, which represented centuries, if not millennia of history and tradition.

Even Yang Kai was no different in this regard.

This was why when he established his own Sect on Shadowed Star, he had named it High Heaven Sect, not Nine Heavens Holy Land or Soaring Heaven Sect! Although the latter two Sects had close ties to him, and he was the Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land, it was obvious how large his sentiments for High Heaven Pavilion were.

In the end, High Heaven Pavilion was his original home, and he carried a special affection towards it, one that Nine Heavens Holy Land and Soaring Heaven Sect could not replace.

Gong Ao Fu taking the initiative to disband Coloured Glass Sect and join High Heaven Sect showed that his beautiful woman had far greater vision that most people present, as well as firmer determination. If this were not the case, she would never have been able to make this decision which ran counter to all of her ancestral teachings.

Yang Kai looked at her directly, staring into her eyes, as if trying to see through to her heart.

Gong Ao Fu did not attempt to evade his gaze, seemingly not feeling the slightest guilt or fear, just continuing to meet Yang Kai eyes with clear and limpid vision.

“Does Sect Master Yang disdain my Coloured Glass Sect Shi for being too weak?”

Seeing that Yang Kai still hadn’t responded after some time, Gong Ao Fu couldn’t help feeling slightly anxious and said, “Coloured Glass Sect has suffered disaster and has very few disciples left. Those who followed this Mistress to High Heaven Sect only number fifty, but among them are ten Origin Realm masters, and the others have Saint King cultivations.”

“Being able to escape with fifty people, not bad at all,” Yang Kai casually complimented, but he still did not show any indication to accept or reject her.

Gong Ao Fu couldn’t help feeling a little awkward and continued, “This Mistress knows that there has been some unpleasantness between Coloured Glass Sect and Sect Master Yang before, but if Sect Master Yang is willing to forgive these transgressions and accept us, this Mistress will swear an oath that even if she dies the cruellest of deaths she will not betray Sect Master Yang’s trust!”

A woman needed incredible determination to make such a pledge as even most men would not have the courage to do so.

Having made this pledge, Gong Ao Fu called out suddenly, “Su Die, kneel down and apologize to Sect Master Yang! I know some of your actions in the past have angered Sect Master Yang.”

Yin Su Die’s tender body trembled when she heard this and she immediately directed a miserable look towards Yang Kai, one that could elicit pity from even the hardest of hearts; however, she did not dare disobey Gong Ao Fu’s command and really knelt in full view of this crowd before uttering in a weak voice, “Su Die was ignorant before and offended Sect Master Yang. Please do not take Su Die’s previous slights to heart, Sect Master Yang.”

She was now a First-Order Origin Returning Realm master, and if it were not for Gong Ao Fu’s order, it would have been absolutely impossible for her to humiliate herself like this.

Otherwise, once word of this spread, she would not be able to show her face in public in the future.

“Sect Master Yang, you...” Gong Ao Fu looked at Yang Kai tentatively.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment before narrowing his eyes towards Gong Ao Fu before speaking, “I want to know where Dai Yuan is. Sect Master Gong should be clear about her whereabouts, no?”

Dai Yuan was one of Yang Kai’s few friends on Shadowed Star, and although their friendship was not too deep, it was not shallow. However, since Yang Kai appeared here, he had been unable to sense any trace of Dai Yuan. Logically speaking, if Dai Yuan had managed to escape here to High Heaven Sect, she should have appeared at this time.

Yang Kai had not seen her yet though, annoying him somewhat and making him worried about whether something had happened to Dai Yuan.

Hearing Yang Kai’s question, Gong Ao Fu actually relaxed and said with a smile, “If Sect Master Yang is worried about the safety of this Mistress’ Disciple, this Mistress can guarantee that she is currently well.”

“Why do you say so?”

“Dai Yuan followed Great Elder Ye to the innermost depths of the Flowing Flame Sand Field, so she is naturally safe now.”

Yang Kai’s expression changed as he could not help feeling some surprise.

Yang Kai could guess why Dai Yuan had chosen to follow Ye Xi Yun into the deepest part of the Flowing Flame Sand Field.

It must have been because she did not want to associate herself with the people in this square, so she had chosen to abandon her Sect and side with Ye Xi Yun without hesitation. Yang Kai was also certain he was a driving force behind this decision.

If it were not for his friendship with Dai Yuan, she would never have taken such an action that could only be seen as a betrayal to her Sect.

Yang Kai could not help feeling moved.

While he did not have many friends on Shadowed Star, each one of them was a true companion he could trust whole-heartedly. There was no need to question Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er’s demeanours. To rescue Fei Zhi Tu, they had willingly thrown themselves into a trap, ignoring the life or death risk involved, and what Dai Yuan had done here was tantamount to treason to her Sect.

“I wonder if Sect Master Yang is satisfied with this Mistress’ answer?” Gong Ao Fu asked, but her face was already full of smiles. She had seen through Yang Kai’s thoughts, so she was no longer worried like before.

Yang Kai laughed loudly, stretched out his hand to help Yin Su Die up before nodding, “Since Sect Master Gong has such intentions, it would be too unkind if this Sect Master still refuses. From now on, Coloured Under Glass Sect’s survivors will be my High Heaven Sect’s disciples, sharing weal and woe together!”

Gong Ao Fu obtained the answer she wanted and immediately cupped her fists, “Many thanks, Sect Master. This Mistress greets Sect Master!”

She immediately changed how she addressed Yang Kai, narrowing the gap between them ever so slightly.

“Disciple greets Sect Master!” Yin Su Die also elegantly bowed, her pretty face blushing slightly, revealing a shy but enchanting light.

Yang Kai, however, knew her nature well and would not be deceived by this innocent act.

This woman cultivated Charm Techniques and it was an instinct for her to change her temperament to attract men’s attention.

She had not even tried to let go of Yang Kai’s hand, instead holding on to him tighter, like she was smitten with him.

Yang Kai’s brow twitched slightly as he glanced at her deeply before withdrawing his hand silently. Turning his focus, he then announced, “Sect Master Gong has great strength, and since you have now joined my High Heaven Sect, you will take up the position of Elder. En, the original disciples of Coloured Glass Sect will also be under your command.”

Gong Ao Fu’s delicate lips parted as a wave of emotion flashed across her beautiful eyes.

After joining High Heaven Sect, not only were they not pushed aside or oppressed, Yang Kai was even willing to let the original disciples Coloured Glass Sect remain under her control while also granting her the status of an Elder. Naturally, this greatly moved this beautiful woman.

“Also, if there is a chance in the future, and Elder Gong wishes to revive Coloured Glass Sect, this Sect Master will not object!” Yang Kai thought for a moment before throwing out another shocking commitment.

This time, Gong Ao Fu’s eyes became slightly moist as she bowed solemnly, “This Mistress offers her sincerest thanks to Sect Master. From this day forward, this Mistress will do her utmost to contribute to High Heaven Sect so as not to disappoint Sect Master’s expectations!”

She truly surrendered to Yang Kai this time.

Originally, joining High Heaven Sect was just a stopgap measure to protect the last remnants of Coloured Glass Sect, but it had already yielded such incredible returns, so how could Gong Ao Fu not feel immense gratitude?

At this moment, the other Sects present showed looks of regret.
