Seeing him acting so humbly, Xiao Chen’s expression eased and he asked with a smile, “I ask you, how long have you been here?”

Jing Li replied, “We arrived just slightly earlier than Sir...”

“Then did you see those things that fell from the sky before and where they went?”

“It seemed that most of them fell into the golden cloud and disappeared!” Jing Li pointed to the billowing golden cloud up in the sky.

“They fell there?” Xiao Chen raised his head up and frowned.

With his cultivation and Divine Sense, he could naturally detect the unusual energy contained in the golden cloud, but he was unable to determine what kind of mysteries were hidden inside it.

Xiao Chen couldn’t help showing a look of embarrassment as he turned to Lan Xun and said, “Princess...”

Lan Xun frowned slightly and spoke after a moment, “Let’s just observe for now!”

Although dozens of Star Seals had fallen into the golden cloud, rushing into this golden cloud without knowing what it was would be quite dangerous. Even someone like Wu Chang did not dare to act rashly, so it was obvious this was not a situation where the fastest had the advantage.

While Xiao Chen was asking questions, Yang Kai kept his ears open and listened intently, so he heard Jing Li’s answer. At this moment, he turned to Kou Wu with the inquiring gaze, the latter simply nodding lightly, indicating there was nothing wrong with what Jing Li had said.

At this moment, as everyone was standing around waiting, others had already rushed over from all directions. Most of these people had been active nearby and were attracted by the vision of so many Star Seals falling from the sky.

Originally, there were only about a dozen people present, but in short order, that number doubled.

With so many people gathered together, all cultivators naturally became vigilant of one another, causing the atmosphere to become tense and treacherous.

However, this lull did not last long.

After about a cup of tea worth of time, a hum suddenly sounded from the golden cloud tumbling in the sky. This sound was thunderous and seemed to herald the birth of something inside the golden cloud. This caused many cultivators present to focus their gazes in shock and anxiety.

Beams of golden light shot out as the golden cloud tumbled even more fiercely. Soon, a vague, giant shadow emerged within the golden light.

As soon as this huge shadow appeared, everyone felt a solemn atmosphere tumbling down, as if whatever had manifested was about to show its true form.

With the appearance of this shadow, the golden cloud in the sky churned and distorted before it slowly began to dissipate.

Soon after, the outline of the giant shadow finally appeared.

“This is...”

“Is... is that a palace?”

“How could there be a palace here? How could something like that just appear out of thin air!”

“Hahaha, I know what this is! It’s the Flowing Time Temple! You fools, how could you not recognize the legendary Flowing Time Temple!”

“Flowing Time Temple? What’s that?”

Of the people present, not everyone knew the secrets of the Flowing Time Temple. Some cultivators came from small Sects and small families who had never heard of the Flowing Time Temple. Only those who came from great forces that had ancient books passed down from generations ago would know anything about the Flowing Time Temple. Before the disciples of these great forces entered the Four Seasons Realm, their Elders would definitely have explained some confidential information to them so they could be on the lookout for rare opportunities.

Yang Kai even suspected that Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao had arrived here deliberately, hoping to find traces of the Flowing Time Temple.

Even Wu Chang, Lan Xun, and a few other leaders of the younger generation were present. If they had not known something about this, how could they have gathered here so coincidentally?

Whether the palace which had emerged from the golden cloud was really the legendary Flowing Time Temple or not, no one knew, but Yang Kai was fairly certain it was the real deal.

Because the location marked out on the map Hua Qing Si had ‘given’ him was in this vicinity.

However, Yang Kai had not expected that the Flowing Time Temple was actually hidden in the Void and that it would appear in such a shocking way, even drawing in dozens of Star Seals from all around when it manifested.

As a result of this grand entrance, many more rivals would likely appear.

As such distracting thoughts flashed across Yang Kai’s mind, he suddenly noticed that someone was staring at him and couldn’t help turning towards Bian Yu Qing and asking, “Are there flowers on my face?”

Bian Yu Qing coldly snorted and snapped, “You have some information about this Flowing Time Temple, right?”

Hearing this, Yang Kai curled his lips up sharply.

Bian Yu Qing said, “Tell me, you won’t lose anything by doing so!”

“True I won’t lose anything, but why should I tell you?” Yang Kai looked at her with a sneer.

Bian Yu Qing pouted in dissatisfaction as she argued, “Boy, you think that because you’ve got a bit stronger, your wings are now hard... what are you staring at!” As she spoke, she suddenly shot Yang Kai a bad look as she folded her arms across her chest to cover her peaks, “You’re not thinking about something inappropriate, right?”

“If you had some propriety, we might be able to talk!” Yang Kai glowered at her.

Bian Yu Qing was angered and looked extremely annoyed.

Kou Wu simply smiled, however, and asked, “Junior Brother Yang, if it is convenient, can you tell us about this Flowing Time Temple? Protector Bian and I really don’t know anything about this...”

Yang Kai frowned and said, “Since Senior Brother Kou has asked so politely, I suppose I can tell you about it! However, let me say this first, after I tell you what I know, we no longer owe each other anything and from now on. We shall be as well water not mixing with river water!”

“Why are you so wary of us?” Bian Yu Qing asked angrily. She could feel that from the moment they met again, Yang Kai was constantly on guard against her and Kou Wu, as if he wished to be as far away from them as possible.

“You wouldn’t understand even if I explained!” Yang Kai glanced at her with a solemn expression before continuing, “I don’t know much about this Flowing Time Temple, only that it was once the secluded home of the Flowing Time Great Emperor. You can even say that the Four Seasons Realm was formed because of the Flowing Time Great Emperor...”

“Flowing Time Great Emperor!” Bian Yu Qing’s face changed dramatically when she heard this name. Judging from her reaction, it was obvious that she had at least heard of this Great Emperor.

Yang Kai nodded, organizing his thoughts before continuing. In truth, there was not much he knew either because even if he knew this was the Flowing Time Temple, he had no way of knowing what was hidden inside. Perhaps there were many wondrous opportunities to be had, but there might also be fatal traps...

“So it seems... those Star Seals that disappeared should have fallen into the Flowing Time Temple!” Bian Yu Qing speculated.

“Most likely,” Yang Kai grinned. “Perhaps it was because of the appearance of all the Star Seals that the temple even showed itself!”

“What Junior Brother Yang means is that the falling Star Seals were a separate opportunity... and if it weren’t for them, we would never have found the Flowing Time Temple?” Kou Wu asked.

Yang Kai nodded, his face becoming excited as he said, “But this way, this Flowing Time Temple must still have all its original opportunities and benefits leftover from the Flowing Time Great Emperor, and as for the Star Seals... I doubt anyone would ignore them, right?”

As everyone chatted amongst themselves, the golden cloud in the sky had almost disappeared completely and was replaced by a magnificent temple. Even if it was still a fair distance away, everyone could feel a sense of majesty from this temple, like they were staring at a dormant ancient behemoth that was slowly awakening.

Finally, at a certain moment, the temple fully manifested and the space around it rumbled violently.

*Xiu...*

The sound of something breaking through the air echoed as two figures rushed forward at almost the same time. It was Wu Chang and Luo Yuan, who had both been waiting patiently until this moment. These two had supreme confidence in their own strength, so they didn’t hesitate to lead the charge!

After they saw these two move, other cultivators naturally wouldn’t hold back and everyone began using their Movement Skills to soar up into the sky.

Yang Kai was naturally among these people. Just like what he said, no one knew what opportunities hid inside the Flowing Time Temple, but what was certain was there were dozens of Star Seals waiting to be acquired, which was enough to drive people crazy.

When they were watching from the ground, no one was able to get a sense of just how big this Flowing Time Temple was, but as they approached closer, the majesty of this temple became more and more apparent. Everyone who flew up at full speed still took a full quarter of an hour to arrive before the entrance to the temple.

Around the periphery of the temple was a golden barrier of light, while atop what appeared to be the main entrance was a giant plaque with the words ‘Flowing Time’ emblazoned on it!

These two characters had an imposing and mysterious air about them, causing those who stared at them to feel slightly dizzy, as if time was passing quickly before their eyes.

After Yang Kai stared dumbfounded for a moment, he quickly retracted his gaze and shook his head. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

One unfortunate fellow was unable to extricate himself, however.

This man was from some unknown Sect and possessed a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation. He had been fine when he was flying up towards the temple earlier, but now, his gaze had become completely fixed on the two giant characters on the plaque and he seemed unable to turn away.

Suddenly, at a speed visibly to the naked eye, this person’s black hair turned white and began to flow away with the wind until his head was bald. At the same time, his sturdy body rapidly aged, and in less than ten breaths, this vibrant man who looked as if he was in his early thirties, had transformed into an old wrinkled man.

It was as if in that short period of time, a few thousand years had flashed by for this man.

What was most shocking, however, was that this man seemed completely unaware of what was happening to him. Staring at the plaque, this man simply allowed whatever mysterious force it was that was eroding his body and soul to act. He was so lost he even wore a strange, satisfied smile on his face.

Shortly after, the vitality of this man expired and he began to fall from the sky.

Quite some time later, a thud sounded from below...

Everyone’s complexion changed drastically after they witnessed this.

Learning from this unfortunate man’s example, no one dared to stare at the ‘Flowing Time’ characters anymore, lest the same fate befall them. There seemed to be a mighty force left behind by a Great Emperor imbued into these characters, and once a Dao Source Realm cultivator was drawn in by it, they would be helpless to free themselves.

*Hong Hong Hong...*

At that moment, Wu Chang and Luo Yuan, who had set off first, arrived in front of the main hall at the same time, but when they touched the golden halo around the temple, they were blocked from progressing and were unable to enter its interior.

The two tried several times, but soon found that no matter what method they used, they could not get around this golden light, so they quickly changed tactics and began attacking it.

The pair caused a ruckus as they released a storm of violent attacks against the golden barrier, but to their surprise, their attacks were all reflected back at them, forcing Wu Chang and Luo Yuan to retreat steadily with looks of amazement on their faces.

The two of them had even suffered some slight injuries as a result of this unexpected development...

“Haha, what was the point in running up so fast? Weren’t you blocked in the end?” Xiao Chen, who had followed immediately after, laughed when he saw this scene.

Wu Chang shot an angry look at Xiao Chen and snorted, “If you have the ability, show me how you go in.”

Xiao Chen smiled slightly and shook his head and said, “Brother Wu Chang was unable to succeed, so how could this Xiao possibly go in? I’m not in the habit of wasting my strength.”
