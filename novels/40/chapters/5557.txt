Nearly a millennium ago, Yang Kai entered the Black Ink Battlefield from Black Territory, where he constantly fought for centuries without rest, and then got stuck in the Great Sea Celestial Phenomenon for many years. Only a few decades ago did he finally return from the Black Ink Battlefield.

Even then, he had been travelling about and did not have time to return to the Star Boundary.

When the situation in the 3,000 Worlds stabilized, he had to take Wu Kuang to the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. One man could only do so many things.

Even when Yang Kai had sent the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary’s Divine Spirits to the Star Boundary, he still could not spare time to return himself.

It was only today that he finally returned home.

He was a Great Emperor who had been acknowledged by the Star Boundary’s Will, and was bestowed the title ‘Void’. As such, he was inseparable from the Star Boundary. As soon as he returned, an exceptionally strong intimate feeling filled his body, making him feel warm and content, like he had returned to his mother’s womb.

But the next moment, an angry shout interrupted this warm and homely sensation, “Who dares to trespass my Star Boundary?”

Immediately after the shout, a massive figure suddenly appeared from the Star Boundary. This figure was so massive that it blotted the entire void and was radiating quite an intimidating pressure.

Yang Kai felt that even though this pressure had yet not reached the Eighth Order, it was not far from it. Furthermore, as the opposite party was also borrowing the Star Boundary’s might, even an average Eighth-Order Master might not necessarily be his opponent.

Yang Kai smiled at the figure, “A wanderer has returned home, don’t panic, Sir Hong Chen!”

The projection from the Star Boundary belonged to none other than Bustling World Great Emperor, Duan Hong Chen.

Obviously, he was the one holding the fort currently.

Yang Kai had also heard about this from Yu Ru Meng and the others. In the beginning, the Star Boundary’s defences were not very tight, but it had now become the Human Race’s final refuge and primary base where the cultivators from Great Territories all across the 3,000 Worlds were gathered. Most of these refugees were weak and helpless, but there were a fair number of strong ones too. If someday the Black Ink Clan really fought its way to the Star Boundary, that would be the day of the final battle.

Ever since Yang Kai had sent the 100 or so Divine Spirits here, the Star Boundary had raised its level of vigilance significantly. It was not that they were on guard against Yang Kai specifically, it was more that they were concerned that the Black Ink Clan might have someone who could employ similar methods.

As such, a Great Emperor would remain on guard duty at all times.

Iron Blood, Bustling World, Martial Beast, Serene Soul, Flower Shadow, Ice Feather, Wondrous Pill, Heavens Revelation, and Void, these nine were the Star Boundary’s current Great Emperors.

Each of them was an outstanding character; otherwise, they would not have become Great Emperors. In the past, all of them had broken through straight to Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm with Yang Kai’s help, and thanks to the abundant resources available to them, they had smoothly advanced to Seventh-Order over the years.

Even then, their cultivation speed was quite fast, but what surprised Yang Kai today was Duan Hong Chen’s pressure. It was not the pressure of someone who had just recently advanced to the Seventh Order. Even many veteran Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters would not be able to hold a candle to him.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Yang Kai had some speculation in his mind.

Duan Hong Chen was taken aback after hearing Yang Kai’s voice, but joy soon replaced his shock, “Yang Kai?”

The moment he mentioned Yang Kai’s name, the Star Boundary became abuzz with excitement as streaks of light shot up from its surface towards the void.

Yang Kai’s heart could not help but pound with excitement, sensing so many familiar auras.

A moment later, the streaks of light came to a halt and revealed themselves. A few of the figures were familiar to Yang Kai, while a few were not, but all of them radiated quite powerful undulations.

He immediately started heading in a particular direction. Standing in that direction was a middle-aged couple, who were both looking at him with excitement and warmth. The woman was incessantly sobbing, while the middle-aged man maintained a calm look, but he was still unable to conceal his excitement.

When he arrived close to the two, Yang Kai bowed down to kneel, “Your unfilial son, Yang Kai has made Father and Mother worried.”

“Get up!” Yang Ying Feng promptly grabbed him, preventing him from kneeling, “You are now an Army Commander, you represent the face of an entire Army as well as its prestige.”

The nearby Dong Su Zhu could not help but nod in agreement, but most of her attention was focused on Yang Kai’s body, checking if he was hurt in any place or not.

Naturally, the people in the rear received word of everything that had been going on in the frontlines. They had already received the news about Yang Kai being appointed as the Army Commander of the Profound Nether Army, but Yang Kai’s parents were just happy that their Son was alive and well. They were proud that he was now entrusted with such heavy responsibilities by the Supreme Headquarters; still, they were worried that Yang Kai might not be able to shoulder such heavy responsibilities.

Yang Kai smiled, “Who does not have parents? Without parents, how could the current Human Race continue on?”

He then respectfully kneeled down, and kowtowed three times to his parents.

Only then did he stand up, lifted by his parents, before looking towards the figure standing next to his parents, “Thank you, it must have been hard on you…”

Xia Ning Chang’s eyes turned red, but she still shook her head and smiled, “Not at all.”

The moment Yang Kai appeared on the Profound Nether Territory battlefield, the news was instantly transmitted back. Xia Ning Chang had quickly rushed to Profound Nether Territory, but unfortunately, when she arrived, she received the news that Yang Kai had left with some soldiers just a few days prior. Helpless, Xia Ning Chang could only return to the Star Boundary.

She was now one of the most outstanding Alchemists of the Human Race and the soldiers on the frontline required a great deal of pills every day. So, she could not remain absent for too long.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai had returned so soon, and appeared right outside the Star Boundary.

From Little Senior Sister’s perspective, it had been over 1,000 years since they last met, but her endless longing completely turned into tender feelings after just a glance at Yang Kai.

While they were chatting, more and more people flew over from the Star Boundary, but remained standing at a respectful distance.

Yang Kai spotted Hua Qing Si, Hui Gu, Mo Xiao Qi, Lin Yun’er, and many other acquaintances and unfamiliar figures in the crowd.

Most of them were injured and had probably returned from the front lines to recuperate at the Star Boundary. Once they had recovered, they would probably head back to the battlefield.

After some brief hellos, Yang Kai shouted, “Head Manager!”

Hua Qing Si immediately stepped forward, “Yes!”

“I’ll have to trouble you to take care of these people.” Saying so, he and Feng Ying immediately opened portals to their Small Universes and many cultivators rushed out, soon reaching 10,000 in number with quite a lot of them in the Sixth Order and Seventh Order.

The crowd was dumbfounded at the sight of this. Feng Ying’s side was still acceptable as the number of people she had taken was not high and none of them were in the Seventh Order.

Yang Kai’s side was rather spectacular though; not only did the people coming out of his Small Universe number over 10,000, but there were many in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm.

This left many speechless, wondering just how vast his Small Universe was.

“Palace Master, these are…” Hua Qing Si asked.

Yang Kai explained, “Most of them were rescued from Acacia Territory, while the rest are Hunters who happened to be there and provided us with their aid.”

Hua Qing Si immediately understood after hearing this and stated with a nod, “I understand! Everyone, please follow me.”

There were so many refugees, so it was impossible to settle them all on the Star Boundary. In fact, the Star Boundary could no longer accept any more people. The logistics department had already arranged the cultivators who had come from other Great Territories to other places.

Yang Xiao and the others wanted to slip into the crowd and disappear, but they were caught by Yang Kai, “You’re not going anywhere.”

A look of misery immediately took over Yang Xiao’s face as he shot a glance towards Yang Xue; however, how could Yang Xue dare to raise her voice; her parents were right here, so acting cute to her Big Brother would be useless. As for Zhao Ye Bai and the others, they obediently lowered their heads like baby chicks.

Yang Kai then shouted to the surrounding crowd, “Ladies and gentlemen, this Yang has just returned home from a long journey. I’m sorry, but I won’t be entertaining any of you. I’ll visit you another day.”

A Seventh-Order old man from some Cave Heaven Paradise stated, putting on a smile, “Sir Yang is too polite, you can go about your own business. We are now members of the Star Boundary, so we can catch up later!”

Seniority-wise, he was many generations older than Yang Kai, but Yang Kai was currently in the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm and was also an Army Commander. Even the Sect Masters of the Cave Heavens and Paradises dared not put on airs before him. Addressing him as Sir was not inappropriate.

Yang Kai nodded in response before wrapping everyone around him in his World Force and heading to the Star Boundary.

A short while later, an Auspicious Aura basked High Heaven Palace, causing many disciples in retreat to start breaking through in succession. Those who could see fate and fortune saw an obscure, enormous Golden Dragon encompassing High Heaven Palace from afar. They could not help but marvel at this sight, “High Heaven Palace is really something, they are enjoying 30% of the Star Boundary’s fortune.”

It was foreseeable that in the future, Masters would emerge from High Heaven Palace one after another, and would continue to do so for some time.

In the past, the Auspicious Aura around High Heaven Palace was much stronger than other places in the Star Boundary already, but now, with Yang Kai’s return, that Auspicious Aura grew even stronger. It was as if the entire Star Boundary was celebrating his return. Even the World Tree clone towering in the Star Boundary rustled happily.

The area within a range of 100,000 kilometres of the World Tree clone was considered a Holy Land of the entire Human Race. This region was demarcated by High Heaven Palace, and only the most outstanding young generation disciples were allowed to cultivate here because it was easier to comprehend the various Grand Daos in the vicinity of the World Tree. Even healing effects here were much better than anywhere else.

The seriously wounded who had retreated from the front lines would also be sent here to recuperate.

At this moment, on a certain Spirit Peak in High Heaven Palace, where Yang Kai’s parents lived, a group of people suddenly appeared. Yang Kai was back, so were Yu Ru Meng and the others. Even Yang Xiao and the other little ones had been caught and brought back. The Spirit Peak, which was usually deserted, suddenly started bustling with activity.

Looking at the buzzing crowd, Yang Ying Feng and Dong Su Zhu glanced at each other as a smile appeared on their lips. After so many years, this place finally looked like a real home again.

Yu Ru Meng and the others got busy preparing a family banquet, while Yang Kai accompanied his parents, chatting non-stop with them. No one talked about the current situation of the Human Race, nor did Yang Kai’s parents ask about his recent experiences, because they did not need to ask, they knew that their Son must have gone through a lot.

Yang Xiao and others also wanted to help out, but just as they went to do so, they were reprimanded by Yu Ru Meng. Helpless, they had no choice but walk to one side in embarrassment, staring at each other in speechless dismay.

Endless sighs escaped Yang Kai’s lips, watching everyone and making small talk with his parents.

The noise and cruelty of the battlefield seemed so far away at this moment. This rare warmth could make anyone forget oneself and not want to leave.

His parents were both Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters now, but it had been ages since they advanced to the Fifth-Order. After so many years of cultivation, they were on the verge of breaking through to the Sixth Order. Only, his parents’ aptitude was not that great, and the further their cultivation progressed, the harder it became for them to advance. If they want to break through to the Seventh Order, they would need many more years.

Yang Ying Feng and Dong Su Zhu were still very satisfied. They were also among the first generation of people to receive the World Tree’s feedback. In fact, had it not been for the World Tree clone’s feedback, it would have been difficult for them to even advance directly to the Fourth Order with their past aptitude. They would have probably had to settle for reaching the Third-Order Open Heaven Realm.

Currently, they were in the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm, Yang Kai was in the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm, and with high status and weighty responsibilities. Although Yang Xue was in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, she was about to advance to Seventh-Order and had a lot of room for growth. Furthermore, all of their Daughters-in-law were in the Seventh Order. So, what was there to be dissatisfied about? The two had never been insatiably greedy.
