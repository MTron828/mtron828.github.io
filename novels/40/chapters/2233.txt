None of the Monster Race Masters knew why Yi Quan was laughing so merrily.

Finally, unable to help herself, Bai Lu went up to him and asked in a soft voice, “Sir, who... was that old man?”

Of course, she could tell that the old man was an extraordinary person, but how could she not be aware of such an astonishing figure in this world?

Yi Quan looked in one direction and slowly said, “He is a survivor from the Holy War from ten thousand years ago!”

“The Holy War!” Bai Lu’s tender body shook, her beautiful eyes filling with astonishment as she asked, “You mean to say, he is...”

Yi Quan nodded lightly, “With his protection, Yang Boy will be safe and sound.” But when he said this, he frowned again, as if worrying about a different matter altogether.

...

Divine Ascension City, inside the royal palace.

Three thousand metres below ground was the Divine Prison, and the environment inside was harsh enough that it was unbearable for people.

Although this was a place for prisoners, it was not used much because no one dared to break the law in the Divine Ascension Country. And, if they did, they would be killed on the spot, so there was simply no need to use this place.

Therefore, the Divine Prison was only a symbolic existence. Many people didn’t even know whether it was just a myth or not.

And right at this moment, Yang Kai and several other people were confined in this Divine Prison, looking through the bars.

All around were voices of the other captured cultivators shouting their grievances.

But none of the guards cared.

Taking this opportunity, Yang Kai and the others quietly exchanged the information they had.

In fact, there was not much information to begin with, only that Zhou Dian had led his men into Heavenly Monster Mountain in order to catch the Star of Calamity, which basically meant catching all the cultivators training in Heavenly Monster Mountain. Naturally, Yang Kai and the others were not able to escape that disaster.

They all felt as if they were fish caught in a pond.

Since it had come to this, they could only put their hopes on Gao Xue Ting.

This time, it was Gao Xue Ting who led the team into the Divine Ascension World, but she left alone after sending everyone into Heavenly Monster Mountain. No one knew what she went off to do afterwards.

If she got the news, then she would definitely find a way to rescue them.

But with her strength as a First-Order Emperor Realm cultivator, she may not be able to succeed. Yang Kai could only hope that she was able to contact Wen Zi Shan outside. If Temple Master Wen entered the Divine Ascension World himself, then they might have some hope.

While he was thinking so, footsteps suddenly sounded from outside the cell. At the same time, an Emperor Realm pressure descended on them.

In an instant, everyone turned silent.

The footsteps kept advancing inwards, and when they reached a certain position, a man stopped and pointed his hand at the cultivators being held in the cell, “Lord King has given the order, bring him out.”

From the voice, it seemed to be General Yu Man.

“Yes!” The guards following behind him hurried to open the cell door.

Yang Kai and the others all paled in unison.

This couldn’t be helped as the person who Yu Man was referring to was the chief disciple of Azure Sun Temple, Xia Sheng.

Very soon, Xia Sheng’s voice rang out as he seemed to be struggling, but after being taught a lesson from the guard, he behaved and resigned himself to fate.

A short while later, Yu Man took Xia Sheng away.

Yang Kai and the rest were unable to do anything even if they wanted to help him, so they could only pray for his safety now.

While they were waiting patiently, a quarter of an hour passed when footsteps emerged again.

Yang Kai quickly looked over, and what he saw caused his expression to sink.

He saw Xia Sheng with blank eyes, body shaking and spasming as if he had received great injuries. Under the lead of the guard, he returned to his own cell just like a walking corpse.

No one knew what he experienced, but everyone naturally felt sad to see him like this. Murong Xiao Xiao had even cried in grief.

She did not dare to call out to Xia Sheng either and just cried in silence.

Then, Yu Man returned again. This time, he stood in a certain spot and looked around for a while before pointing his hand and saying, “This one!”

Xiao Bai Yi paled.

Because the person Yu Man pointed at turned out to be him.

The guard opened the cell door again and took Xiao Bai Yi away.

After they left, Yang Kai hurriedly looked at Xia Sheng and called out to him quietly, but Xia Sheng was completely unresponsive as if he had lost his soul.

“Junior Brother Yang... Could something be wrong with Senior Brother Xia?” Murong Xiao Xiao asked in worry.

Yang Kai shook his head, “I have no idea, but from how he looks, Brother Xia seems to have endured some serious torture, or perhaps his Soul has become unstable. He should be fine after resting for a while though.”

But what piqued his interest even more was what Xia Sheng had experienced that put him in this state.

If the power in his body had not been restricted, then he could have let out his Divine Sense to investigate, and he might get some clues. Unfortunately, he couldn’t use any of his strength now and could only rely on his own observations and speculations.

He casually comforted Murong Xiao Xiao with a few words but deep inside, he was anxious too.

Looking around, no one seemed to be paying attention to this side, so Yang Kai quickly moved to a dark corner and sat down.

The seal inside his body was set by Zhou Dian himself, so he couldn’t unlock it on his own. It would require a Master like Zhou Dian to help him.

However... Yang Kai had his Soul Devouring Insects. The power of the seal was also a type of Spiritual Energy, so it could still be fed upon by the Soul Devouring Insects.

As long as he could mobilize his Soul Devouring Insects, he would have hope of breaking the seal and restoring his strength.

As for what to do next, he could only take things one step at a time.

Time slowly passed by.

And, while Yang Kai was attempting to break the seal with his Soul Devouring Insects, Chen Mu Ji and Murong Xiao Xiao were taken away one after the other.

Without exception, they ended up just like Xia Sheng and Xiao Bai Yi before them. Yang Kai had no idea what they experienced, but they were all listless and the look in their eyes was hollow after they returned. They wouldn’t respond even when people called out to them and it was clear they received a great impact on their Souls and were unable to stay conscious.

Yang Kai gradually realized that something wasn’t quite right.

The number of cultivators that Zhou Dian and the others captured in Heavenly Monster Mountain was somewhere between seventy and eighty.

And, there were differing levels of strength among these cultivators, but the others were all safe. Only the ones from Azure Sun Temple were picked out.

This clearly wasn’t some kind of coincidence! They were being targeted!

Was there some kind of noticeable difference between cultivators like them who entered the Divine Ascension Mirror World from the outside and the natives? Yang Kai could not help but wonder about this. If this wasn’t the case, how could the fact that everyone else remained safe be explained? Why was it that only Xia Sheng and the others had to suffer?

But he couldn’t figure it out even if he thought about it.

And, just as he was about to break the seal, Yu Man suddenly came to his cell and pointed at him, grinning, “Take him away!”

Just as before, the guard opened the cell and grabbed Yang Kai before walking out of the prison behind Yu Man.

Yang Kai was silent the whole way through but he was constantly looking around.

This place should be the royal palace of Divine Ascension Country. The palace was very luxuriously decorated but appeared very quiet. Not many people seemed to be living here.

Yu Man led Yang Kai around some turns in the palace and they quickly arrived before a large hall.

Once they arrived here, Yu Man stopped and turned to look at Yang Kai with cold eyes, “Go in yourself, the Lord King is waiting.”

Yang Kai nodded and did not resist. After taking a few steps forward, he suddenly turned back to Yu Man and asked, “This Elder Sister...”

“Who are you calling Elder Sister?” Yu Man smiled charmingly. The guard next to her did not even dare to look at her, as if afraid his soul would be taken away if he did.

A look of fascination appeared on Yang Kai’s face and there was astonishment in his eyes.

It wasn’t that he did it on purpose, but his power was being restricted and he had fallen under the influence of Yu Man’s Charm Technique.

But Yu Man did not dare to go on with this either. The Lord King was waiting inside and she would not be able to bear the consequences if she were to delay things. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

In the next moment, Yu Man withdrew her charm.

Yang Kai’s body jolted and he came back to his senses. Deep inside, he was cursing incessantly.

If his strength had not been sealed, then he would not have fallen to her temptation.

He went on, “This Little Brother wishes to ask, why did Elder Sister pick out all those people here? Is there anything different about them?”

Yu Man curled her lip, “I was just following orders.”

“The Lord King’s orders?” Yang Kai raised his brows.

“Know your place, little brat!” Yu Man’s face suddenly turned cold, changing faster than the flip of a book.

Yang Kai said with nervous laughter, “I was just asking.”

“Hurry and get inside!” Yu Man bellowed.

“Yes, yes!” Yang Kai answered repeatedly and stepped forward again.

In a short time, he arrived in front of the hall and entered through the door.

As soon as he entered the hall, Yang Kai could smell something fragrant enter his nose that caused his whole body to feel light and floaty as if he were walking on clouds.

And, looking up, Yang Kai could not help but feel surprised.

Because this hall looked no different than a woman’s boudoir. The entire place was decorated effeminately with pink drapery, light red carpets, and gave off an elegant and noble aura.

As soon as he entered the hall, a pair of bright eyes looked towards him.

Yang Kai turned his head and looked towards that person.

There he saw, a dozen paces away from himself, a pink gauze curtain which vaguely revealed a lazy figure lounging behind it. The bright gaze had come from this person.

A powerful Divine Scene swept through Yang kai as if it wanted to pass through his Soul Avatar and dig through the secrets hidden deep within.

Yang Kai raised his brows, frowning, and thought for a moment before blurting out, “The masked man?”

He suddenly realized that the power fluctuations emanating from the person behind the curtain were exactly the same as that of the masked man’s he sensed in Heavenly Monster Valley.

[This person is the Master who launched that sneak attack on Yi Quan?]

Yang Kai would never have thought that it would end up being a woman.

Even though he could not see her face, it certainly couldn’t be bad with such an enchanting figure. Not to mention, her strength was also astounding.
