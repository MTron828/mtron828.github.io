According to the conventions of the Martial Dao, whoever was stronger would be positioned higher, regardless of age.

Nanmen Da Jun’s heart filled with admiration as he mistakenly thought that Yang Kai was a hidden Array Grandmaster.

“Grandmaster Yang, you really concealed yourself diligently. This Nanmen apologizes for his previous impoliteness. Grandmaster Yang, please forgive me!” Nanmen Da Jun smiled wryly, completely convinced of Yang Kai’s capabilities.

Yang Kai blushed slightly, but he was too lazy to explain, simply replying, “Yes, this Space Array was arranged by me, but it’s not like what you think.”

“Grandmaster Yang is far too humble! This Nanmen feels embarrassed for showing off his meagre skills before an expert.”

Yang Kai shook his head, deciding to ignore him entirely and turn to Bing Yun instead, “Senior, what are the casualties?”

Bing Yun sighed lightly, “More or less a thousand disciples died, and more than half of the remaining were injured. Even though we suffered a great loss, it was still a fortunate ending thanks to you and the three Monster Kings.”

Although Yang Kai did not really participate in the fight, the Soul Devouring Demon Insects that he released made great contributions. Without them, the casualties of Ice Heart Valley would be at least several times higher; after all, the number of enemies was too great, and they would not be able to kill all of them in time by just relying on the Emperor Realm Masters of Ice Heart Valley and the three Monster Kings.

But it was a totally different story with the aid of Soul Devouring Demon Insects. Wherever the clouds of insects passed by, the people of Seeking Passion Sect dropped in droves. They were indeed an efficient means of mass slaughter.

“What about Seeking Passion Sect?” Yang Kai asked next.

“Half of the one hundred thousand died, twenty to thirty thousand escaped, and the rest surrendered.”

Yang Kai nodded, the result was as he expected.

However, from now on, the Seeking Passion Sect would be no more. The Sect Master and almost all of its Emperor Realm Masters were killed. Even if some Masters were remaining in the Sect, they would still be unable to stabilize the situation.

“Senior, what’s your next plan?”

Bing Yun replied, “First, we need to tend to the injured disciples. Then, the Sect Defending Array has to be repaired. As for those who surrendered… It’s really hard to decide.”

There were about twenty to thirty thousand cultivators who surrendered, leaving Bing Yun with a headache. She was afraid that there would be bad consequences if she decided to simply kill all of them, but if they just let them go like this, Ice Heart Valley would be too forgiving. Therefore, Bing Yun was struggling with a decision.

After all, only a small portion of these people belonged to the Seeking Passion Sect, while the rest were just recruited by the Seeking Passion Sect’s Recruitment Order, so there was no deep grudge between them and Ice Heart Valley.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, “Capital punishment may be exempted, but some suffering is inevitable. Senior can let them go, but they will have to pay for their freedom.”

Bing Yun nodded in agreement, “I was thinking so too.”

While they were talking, Nanmen Da Jun suddenly suggested, “Senior Bing Yun wants to repair the Sect Defending Array? This Nanmen could be of assistance.”

Bing Yun smiled lightly, “I was about to propose just that. The only concern is whether Grandmaster Nanmen would be willing to or not.”

“Of course I am, why wouldn’t I be!?” Nanmen Da Jun was delighted.

Yang Kai definitely knew what he was up to, so he proactively offered, “As long as you can repair Ice Heart Valley’s Sect Defending Array, you can study the Cross-Territory Space Array as much as you want.”

That array was arranged by him with the help of his comprehension of the Dao of Space anyway, so no matter how thoroughly Nanmen Da Jun studied it, he would not be able to replicate it. As such, Yang Kai was not afraid of this technique being stolen by him.

Nanmen Da Jun’s eyes lit up as he heard it, cupping his fists, “Many thanks, Grandmaster Yang!”

He treated Yang Kai as though he was the Senior Spirit Array Master here.

“Senior, I want to take a trip to Seeking Passion Sect!” Yang Kai’s face abruptly turned solemn, a trace of murderous intent lingering around him.

Hearing this, Bing Yun nodded in understanding, “Then let Yao’er accompany you there.”

Yang Kai glanced at Ji Yao who was standing behind Bing Yun and nodded in agreement.

Without delay, he immediately took Ji Yao with him and flew out of the Ice Lake Island. After informing Xi Lei and the other Monster Kings, the group of five flew straight out of Ice Heart Valley.

“Young Master Yang, where are we going?” Xi Lei was a straightforward man and could not help asking as he sensed the murderous intent in Yang Kai’s eyes, knowing they were going to stir up some trouble.

“Seeking Passion Sect!” Yang Kai replied.

Xi Lei and the others came to a realization and simply followed behind Ji Yao without a word.

Ice Heart Valley’s crisis this time was greatly linked to Yang Kai. In fact, Yang Kai was essentially the cause of this whole mess. If he had not killed Feng Xi in the Shattered Star Sea, Ice Heart Valley would not have been besieged.

Although Seeking Passion Sect had already suffered a great loss as their top Masters were all dead, Yang Kai obviously did not plan to let the matter just drop.

Since the feud had already been planted, it was natural to cut weeds and pull out roots, leaving no chance for the enemy to seek revenge.

Furthermore, the Seeking Passion Sect had been firmly rooted in the Northern Territory for tens of thousands of years, so there was no doubt a lot of good things stored in their Treasury. How could Yang Kai simply let off such a prize?

After a while, the group arrived at Ice Moon City.

Before today, Ice Moon City had been occupied by the Seeking Passion Sect, but after the war, Seeking Passion Sect collapsed like a mud wall after the rain and Ice Moon City instantly reverted to its previous ownership. The city was quiet, however, with the previous bustling streets completely deserted.

Flying straight into the City Lord’s Mansion, Yang Kai’s group found the Space Array there and after activating it with some Source Crystals, they disappeared.

Seeking Tranquility Mountain Range was the headquarters of Seeking Passion Sect.

It was rumoured that the Seeking Passion Great Emperor had founded his Sect here from nothing, and it was also here that he comprehended his Dao and became a Great Emperor.

A Sect with few tens of thousands of years of history would definitely have extraordinary heritage.

It was a place propitious for giving birth to great men, with undulating hills and expansive plains, partnered with picturesque mountains and rivers.

In the Seeking Tranquility Mountain Range, there were countless Spirit Peaks with extremely rich World Energy. Compared to the world of ice and snow that Ice Heart Valley was built on, the climate in Seeking Tranquility Mountain Range was temperate, with the pleasant fragrance of flowers and the melodious chirping of birds surrounding them everywhere.

One day later, when Yang Kai brought the three Monster Kings and Ji Yao to this place, they actually found the gates of Seeking Passion Sect wide open. Not only was there no defensive Spirit Arrays active, not even a single disciple was on guard.

Releasing his Divine Sense, Yang Kai soon discovered that the whole of Seeking Passion Sect was like a ghost town, not a living person in sight.

“They’re quite fast at escaping,” Xi Lei obviously realized this too, and could not help muttering.

For a huge Sect, even if Feng Xuan had taken many disciples and high-level Elders with him on his campaign, he would certainly have left many people behind in the Sect. However, there was no one in the entire Seeking Passion Sect right now. Without a doubt, those cultivators who escaped from Ice Heart Valley must have spread the news, which led to the remaining disciples in Seeking Passion Sect to abandon their estate and run for their lives.

In other words, since yesterday, the Seeking Passion Sect had been no more.

Atop the main gate was a white jade plaque with three gleaming words ‘Seeking Passion Sect’ carved on it. It was clean and pristine, as if it was well maintained all year round.

With a swing of his hand, Yang Kai smashed the plaque to pieces. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He then beckoned the others to follow him as he walked inside.

Along the way, there was really no one to be found. The pavilions they passed by were all in a mess, probably because Seeking Passion Sect’s remaining disciples had looted whatever valuables remained before they fled.

Not only did Yang Kai not see a single person the whole way forward, but there wasn’t even anything of value left behind.

The only property left was this huge piece of land.

“This place isn’t bad, the World Energy is so rich that there must be a few first-class Earth Veins buried here,” Xi Lei’s head turned left and right, busy checking his surroundings.

Yang Kai smiled, “This was the Sect left behind by a Great Emperor, and the founder of the Sect was that Great Emperor himself. Why would he choose this place if it was bad? I think there’s probably no other place better than here in the entire Northern Territory.

“It was just too bad they messed with the wrong people. A foundation of tens of thousands of years ended just like that,” Ying Fei sighed.

Xie Wu Wei’s eyes flashed as he suddenly smiled, “Young Master Yang, how about you take over this place and found a Sect yourself? It would be a waste if this place was simply left deserted.”

Xi Lei and Ying Fei were shocked by his suggestion, but thinking about it, Yang Kai was totally qualified to found a Sect, since he was an Emperor Realm Master, and there was a ready-made place right here. With such an excellent environment and heritage, there would be no better opportunity to found a prosperous Sect than this one.

But these two Monster Kings wondered what Xie Wu Wei’s intentions for proposing such an idea were.

However, both of them were not stupid and after some contemplation, their eyes lit up as they finally understood Xie Wu Wei’s plan.

Ying Fei grinned, “Brother Xie’s proposal is brilliant. If Young Master Yang established a Sect here, I hope that I could be rewarded with a position like a Protector or an Elder.”

“Count this Old Rhino in!” Xie Lei smiled from ear to ear too.

Listening to these three, Yang Kai glanced at them and was secretly delighted, knowing that they were not willing to go back to the Ancient Lands and instead wanted to stick around with him.

He did not personally possess anything that could attract the three Monster Kings to work for him, but Zhang Ruo Xi did.

Although he understood all this, Yang Kai did not expose their thoughts and instead responded lightly, “Aren’t you three afraid that the Divine Venerables might not be happy about it? I don’t have the guts to poach their people.”

“Nonsense,” Xie Wu Wei beamed, “The Divine Venerables are not so narrow-minded. If Young Master Yang talks to them, they will definitely agree with you.”

“Yes yes, the Divine Venerables are very reasonable people!” Ying Fei echoed from the side.

If it was someone else, it was clear that the Divine Venerables would not accept such an arrangement, but it would be no problem if it was Yang Kai.

“We will see,” Yang Kai pondered for a while, but did not promise them.

After hearing this, the three Monster Kings’ eyes brightened, feeling exhilarated at the prospect of this possibility.

Xie Wu Wei’s proposal had truly moved Yang Kai’s heart.

As they mentioned, this place was excellent and ready-made. Even if Yang Kai did not want it, it would not take long before it was occupied by another great force.

What’s more, this was the place Yang Kai secured through his own efforts. Although there was not a single living person left, and it seemed all the wealth was taken away too, just owning this piece of land would make all his effort worthwhile.

Since this was the territory that he fought hard for, there was no reason for him to give it away.

Furthermore, ever since Yang Kai’s arrival in the Star Boundary all those years ago, he felt like he had been wandering around without a stable place to settle down.

It did not matter when he was alone, but where would he place his friends and family from Shadowed Star when he brought them here in the future? Where would they stay? Moreover, he could not let Chi Yue, Gui Zu and the rest keep staying in the Thousand Leaves Sect.

He would need to prepare his own place as soon as possible, for them to live in and cultivate in peace.

The casual words of Xie Wu Wei actually piqued Yang Kai’s interest.

Nevertheless, he understood that it would not be easy to found a Sect. Back then, it was a complete coincidence that High Heaven Sect could be established on Shadowed Star. Now, he would need to plan carefully if he wanted to create a permanent foundation here in the Star Boundary.
