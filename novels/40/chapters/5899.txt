“It should be,” Mi Jing Lun nodded lightly.

During the third battle, the Black Ink Clan suddenly changed their strategy and went into full defensive mode, which Yang Kai and Mi Jing Lun found quite strange; however, if the Black Ink Clan at the No-Return Pass got word from the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction that help was on the way, everything would make sense.

Since they knew about the reinforcements coming from the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, they had opted for an all-out defensive strategy. As long as they could hold on until reinforcements arrived, they might be able to execute a pincer attack on the Human Race and catch them off guard, thereby turning the tables on them.

It wasn’t hard for the Black Ink Clan to get the news about the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. Black Ink Nests not only had the ability to spawn Black Ink Clansmen, but this strange thing also held another advantage in transmitting information that could not be matched by any other known means.

Judging by the situation, the Black Ink Clan’s response was undoubtedly correct. As long as they continued to defend at the No-Return Pass, they would be able to hold out for more than a decade until reinforcements arrived. The only way this wouldn’t happen is if the Human Race decided to launch an all-out attack to take down the No-Return Pass at all costs before their reinforcements arrived.

“Does that mean that the Void Guard encountered the Black Ink Clan’s reinforcements? Was there a clash?” Yang Kai asked.

Mi Jing Lun quickly replied, “Not for the time being. The Void Guard don’t have many people, but each of them is a Master who would be prudent in their actions. On the other hand, the Black Ink Clan Army is marching straight ahead, heading right towards their goal without trying to hide themselves. After the Void Guard discovered the situation, they immediately sent back a warning and then began monitoring the progress of the Black Ink Clan reinforcements. However, the deployment of the Space Arrays will be delayed because of this.”

This was something that couldn’t be helped. According to the original plan, the Void Guard under Li Wu Yi’s lead would set up Space Arrays all along the way to the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. This way would make it much more convenient for the Human Race to attack the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction after conquering the No-Return Pass, saving them all the time which would have been wasted in transit.

But now that they had encountered the Black Ink Clan reinforcements halfway, setting up the Space Arrays had to be delayed. In fact, they even had to remove their own traces to prevent the Black Ink Clan reinforcements from discovering anything.

The moment Mi Jing Lun received the Void Guard’s message, he realized the gravity of the situation and immediately launched the seventh attack. If he didn’t, he wouldn’t be able to contact Yang Kai.

It could be said that the reason this battle was happening was because Mi Jing Lun wanted to contact Yang Kai. As for dealing damage to the No-Return Pass, that was inconsequential today.

Yang Kai sank into contemplation.

[Something must have happened to the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, but no one knows exactly what. The only thing that’s apparent from the current situation is that the Suppressing Black Ink Army is in trouble; otherwise, they wouldn’t have allowed Black Ink Clansmen to escape.]

[In the worst-case scenario, Mo is completely awake and has broken out of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, while the Suppressing Black Ink Army… has been completely wiped out!]

Suppressing the worry and pain in his heart, Yang Kai tried his best to find a glimmer of clarity in this chaotic situation.

After a long time, he finally spoke, “It should still take the Black Ink Clan reinforcements over a decade more to arrive at the No-Return Pass, so the situation isn’t that bad.”

“But what will come, will come,” Mi Jing Lun softly replied, “We must seize the No-Return Pass before the Black Ink Clan reinforcements arrive; otherwise, once they get here and the Black Ink Clan at the No-Return Pass make a move, we will be facing attacks on two fronts.”

If that really happened, not to mention attacking the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, it would be difficult to say whether the Human Race Army would be able to make it out alive.

Be that as it may, it was extremely difficult to take down the No-Return Pass in the current situation. The entirety of the No-Return Pass had been set up like a tortoise shell by Mo Na Ye, with no gap for the Human Race to exploit. Even after so many battles, the Black Ink Clan had only suffered some superficial wounds.

Mi Jing Lun continued, “On the bright side, the enemy is in the open while we are in the dark.”

Yang Kai nodded, “This is indeed an advantage. It might not even have occurred to the Black Ink Clan reinforcements that their movements have been exposed.”

One had to admit that establishing a special organization like the Void Guard before the war and making them lay Space Arrays along the way in advance was truly a stroke of luck. If it weren’t for the fact that the Void Guard had set out in advance, and accidentally encountered the Black Ink Clan reinforcements along the way, perhaps the enemy would have arrived without the Human Race’s knowledge. That would have been a total disaster.

“Senior Brother,” Yang Kai called out, “I want to check on these reinforcements.”

“You’re going personally?” Mi Jing Lun was slightly taken aback, “I’ve already sent someone to investigate.”

Yang Kai asserted, “I can only rest assured after checking them personally. I need to verify some things. I hope… the situation hasn’t reached a critical point yet.”

Mi Jing Lun thought about it for a moment before acceding, “Okay, but if you don’t show your face for a long time, there is no guarantee that Mo Na Ye won’t notice your absence.”

“That’s fine, but Senior Brother still needs to devise a new strategy and prolong the battle until my return. Once I’m back we can end things here for the moment.”

“That won’t be a problem,” Mi Jing Lun readily agreed, “Right now, the Black Ink Clan is only focusing on defence. The initiative is in our hands, so we can decide when to end the fighting.”

“I’ll have to trouble you with this then, Senior Brother.” As Yang Kai finished speaking, he surged his strength and flew away. A moment later, he arrived at the temporary Human Race camp located three days away, where there was a Universe Temple with a Space Array.

Noticing Yang Kai’s arrival, the two Void Guards who were stationed here were both stunned, as there shouldn’t have been a reason for him to appear here at this time.

Be that as it may, they didn’t ask any questions. They just readied the Space Array under Yang Kai’s instructions, and let him teleport away.

With each teleportation, Yang Kai went deeper and deeper into the Black Ink Battlefield.

The Void Guard had left behind dozens of Universe Temples in the void over the years, and each was within the range of the previous Space Array. Each Universe Temple was further hidden by a Grand Array. So, in this vast void, if one did not specifically search for it, it would be difficult to find any traces of the Space Arrays.

Furthermore, even if one of the Universe Temples was destroyed for some unknown reason, it was not that big of a problem. The Void Guard still had spare Universe Temples with them and they could easily rush to the damaged location and re-establish the link.

Having said that, this kind of long-distance teleportation using the Universe Temples was a little taxing on ordinary cultivators. If one’s cultivation wasn’t sufficient, they would need to rest for a while after a few subsequent teleportations. In addition, the Space Arrays themselves would also need frequent maintenance for such intense usage.

Fortunately, it was not that troublesome for Yang Kai as he was proficient in the Dao of Space, so this kind of teleportation posed no pressure to him.

After dozens of teleportations, Yang Kai arrived at the leading temple less than three days later.

There were quite a few Void Guards stationed there, numbering in dozens. Originally, they were tasked with arranging more Space Arrays further up ahead, but due to some unforeseen circumstances along the way, they had all been stuck here.

Seeing Yang Kai, everyone, who had been a little anxious all this time, seemed to have found their pillar of support. All of them calmed down and bowed in unison.

“Dao Lord,” Miao Fei Ping stepped forward to take charge.

“Where’s Li Wu Yi?” Yang Kai looked around but didn’t see Li Wu Yi anywhere.

Miao Fei Ping quickly explained, “Senior Brother Li is monitoring the movements of the Black Ink Clan reinforcements with a few Junior Brothers.”

Yang Kai nodded his acknowledgement, “Is the other party aware of you?”

Miao Fei Ping shook his head in response, “I don’t think so. Senior Brother Li has given them a wide berth all this time. The moment he noticed the Black Ink Clan reinforcements, he immediately ordered us to conceal ourselves while retreating to this position. The Black Ink Clan probably never thought they would be discovered in such a place so their vigilance is lacking.”

Although he had obtained some information from Mi Jing Lun, after hearing it straight from Miao Fei Ping, Yang Kai was finally a little relieved. As long as the Void Guard’s whereabouts were not discovered, there was still room to manoeuvre.

“How do I find Li Wu Yi?” Yang Kai asked again.

Miao Fei Ping immediately took out a Space Beacon and stated, handing it to Yang Kai, “Senior Brother Li has the corresponding Space Beacon on him.”

Yang Kai stretched out his hand and took it; however, he didn’t immediately use it to teleport. After all, he was completely unaware of the situation on Li Wu Yi’s side. If he were to rashly teleport to his position, their whereabouts might be exposed.

Yang Kai activated the Space Beacon for a brief moment before withdrawing his energy, giving Li Wu Yi a sign that someone was about to teleport over. If it was safe, Li Wu Yi would definitely respond.

After patiently waiting for a moment, the Space Beacon in Yang Kai’s hand flickered.

Yang Kai nodded his acknowledgement and activated the Space Beacon. The next moment, Space Principles undulated before Yang Kai vanished.

In the void, several figures were using their own Space Secret Techniques to conceal their figures and auras. Under this kind of concealment, it was basically impossible for the Black Ink Clan reinforcements to detect their presence.

The leader of these figures was none other than Li Wu Yi. At this moment, he was holding a Space Beacon in his hand, a little puzzled as to why someone from the nearest Universe Temple would send such a signal.

But the next moment, he understood. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

As Space Principles fluctuated, a figure suddenly appeared beside him. When Li Wu Yi saw who it was, he breathed a long sigh of relief.

He knew that after he sent the news back, Supreme Commander Mi would send someone to investigate, but he had never thought that it would be Yang Kai himself.

The Void Guard were about to bow to Yang Kai when he waved them off and instead asked Li Wu Yi, “Where are they?”

Li Wu Yi pointed in a certain direction.

Yang Kai looked in that direction and indeed noticed a billowing mass of Black Ink Clouds. He also saw an Army of Black Ink Clansmen rushing forward. From a distance, it looked like a huge sea of darkness was racing through the void.

Yang Kai was secretly shocked as there was a huge number of Black Ink Clansmen, at least 10 million of them!

This number might not be much compared to the number of Black Ink Clansmen participating in the main war; however, if all of these reinforcements were Masters rather than cannon fodder, it would be a terrifying force indeed.
