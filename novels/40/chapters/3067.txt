Fu Chi shuffled towards Li Jiao as a ferocious glint flashed across his gaze. Although he was staggering, he was in a much better state than Li Jiao.

He had figured out that Li Jiao had used up all his energy, so he could now do with him as he pleased. There was no way Li Jiao could resist.

Fu Chi’s anger had reached the breaking point after he was injured by a filthy hybrid. Therefore, he decided to torture Li Jiao in the cruellest way possible to let the latter know the consequences of offending him.

He didn’t care why Li Jiao would put his own life at risk to kill him. He wasn’t interested in finding out what was on the hybrid’s mind.

There was only a distance of tens of metres between them, but it took Fu Chi an incense stick worth of time to cross this short distance, staggering as he stepped because he too was incredibly weak.

Standing in front of Li Jiao, he appeared to be the victorious one with a smug expression. His lips curved into a hideous smile as he watched Li Jiao panting heavily on his knees.

After a sigh, Li Jiao decided to close his eyes and await his final moment. If he still had any power to resist, he wouldn’t have stayed put. However, the spirituality of his Golden Lion Halberd, which he had been cultivating with his own Blood Essence, had been damaged. His Dragon Bead had also cracked. The foundation of his life had been hurt as well, so he didn’t even have the energy to move one finger.

[Has he conceded defeat?] Fu Chi stared coldly at him and sneered. [So what if he has conceded defeat? He has to pay the price for offending me!]

Just when Li Jiao was about to shut his eyes though, he suddenly opened them again as he looked behind Fu Chi in fright. He seemed to be looking at something unbelievable as he widened his eyes.

Seeing that, Fu Chi snorted, “What trick are you trying to play on me before your death?”

He thought that Li Jiao was just trying to distract him, but he felt that something was off immediately after he finished speaking, because there really was another presence behind him.

“Who?” Having goosebumps all over his body, Fu Chi whirled around, only to see an ugly monkey-like man grinning at him. The smile on his face was horrendous and filled with a kind of unfettered madness.

“It’s you!” Upon recognizing the man, Fu Chi frowned.

He remembered that this man was the one in charge of building his new palace. Some time ago, he and Zhu Lie went over to check on the palace, and it was this man who had guided them around. Only a short period of time had passed, so Fu Chi still remembered this man’s face. At that time, he couldn’t help feeling disdainful of his servile attitude.

In front of the Dragon Clan, all Humans were as lowly as ants.

“What are you doing here?” Fu Chi stared at him with a frown.

Everything felt off on this day. First, a hybrid stalked him and waged a life-or-death battle with him. Then, a Human appeared all of a sudden.

It was said once bitten, twice shy, so Fu Chi was now wary of this man.

Normally, he wouldn’t even spare this kind of man a glance; however, having been injured repeatedly on this day, he had become more cautious.

The inscrutable smile on this man’s face made Fu Chi furious.

Faced with Fu Chi’s question, Wu Chen didn’t answer him as he just took a look at Li Jiao with a smile before shifting his attention back to Fu Chi. Nodding slightly, he uttered, “Good! Good! Good!”

After he said ‘good’ three times, the smile on his face became more eerie, and he even stuck out his tongue to lick his lips. He looked like a starving wolf that was staring at its prey in the winter.

“Are you also here to oppose me?” Fu Chi stared at him coldly and sneered. He wasn’t a fool, so he could see that this monkey-like man was ill-intentioned. This Human was just a Third-Order Emperor though, so although Fu Chi was weak now due to his injuries, he still had confidence he could defeat him.

Upon hearing that, Li Jiao was elated and looked at Wu Chen with expectation written all over his face.

He was extremely crestfallen because he still couldn’t kill Fu Chi even though he had used up all his tricks, and he was already in his last moments now. However, if Wu Chen was there to deal with Fu Chi, then he could still get his revenge with the latter’s help.

“Oppose you?” Wu Chen shook his head with a smile, “No, no, no… That’s not the reason I’m here.”

Fu Chi replied disdainfully, “I didn’t think you had the guts.”

Wu Chen nodded and uttered, “I’m here to eat a Dragon.”

“Eat a Dragon?” Fu Chi was startled as he didn’t understand the meaning behind his words. However, he did not have the time to think about it, because right after Wu Chen finished speaking, the gleam that beamed from his eyes suddenly turned into a vortex.

As they were staring at each other fixedly, Fu Chi couldn’t help but feel astounded as he felt that those eyes seemed to have a mysterious devouring power that seemed to be trying to suck his Soul in.

Fu Chi’s expression changed drastically as he tried to look away, but it was too late.

No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t move his gaze. The mysterious power from the other party’s eyes grew stronger and more horrendous, forcing Fu Chi to stare fixedly at him, and in just a short moment, Fu Chi could feel that his Soul was really beginning to shake.

His back was drenched in cold sweat in an instant. Following that, his vision turned dark, and he started to lose consciousness. However, he remained rooted to the spot, unable to move a muscle.

Wu Chen stepped forward, and under the attention of the dumbfounded Li Jiao, his body went through a series of transformative changes.

His thin frame swelled up all of a sudden, and his monkey-like countenance started contorting. In the blink of an eye, Wu Chen had transformed into an authoritative-looking and overbearing man with a pair of sharp eyes.

Appearing to be a middle-aged man now, he didn’t look like Wu Chen at all.

[What kind of Secret Technique is this?] Li Jiao was flabbergasted as his eyes were brimming with fear. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Despite his sharp vision, he couldn’t see through Wu Chen at all previously. He believed that Yang Kai and the hundreds of people who built the palace alongside Wu Chen also didn’t notice anything off about him.

[Does this Secret Technique allow him to disguise his appearance and aura perfectly?]

Just then, Li Jiao couldn’t help feeling fearful after ‘Wu Chen’ swept a glance over him. There was no way he could resist this man’s attack. If this man, who had disguised himself as Wu Chen, wanted to kill Li Jiao, he could do it without any effort. That realization made Li Jiao terrified as his blood almost froze.

When he was facing Fu Chi, an Eighth-Order Thunder Dragon, he could still summon the courage to kill him even if he had to sacrifice his life to do so; however, a mere nonchalant glance from this man was able to shake him to the core, which went to show just how horrifying this man truly was.

“Hahaha!” That man circled around Fu Chi and started guffawing, “This is such a lucky day for me! It really didn’t take me much effort to get one.”

Upon finishing his words, he licked his lips again as his gaze was brimming with greed while he was staring at Fu Chi.

“May I know who Your Excellency is?” Li Jiao gulped and asked.

Now, he had realized that this man, who had disguised as Wu Chen, must be a terrifying hidden Master. This man also had to have some hidden agenda for him to pose as Wu Chen and sneak into Dragon Island. Judging from this incident that had just happened, his plot must be extremely wicked and might even turn all of Dragon Island upside down.

Ignoring Li Jiao’s question entirely, Wu Chen stared fixedly at Fu Chi and uttered, “I have to thank you for what just happened. If you hadn’t injured him, it would take me some effort to capture him.” He tutted, “It’s troublesome being so weak.”

[Did he just call himself weak?] Li Jiao was astonished.

What Wu Chen had just showcased suggested that he had incredible power. With just a stare, he was able to root an Eighth-Order Thunder Dragon in place. If his power was considered weak, then Li Jiao’s power could only be regarded as trash.

“Stay right there. I’ll deal with you after I’m done with this little Dragon!” Wu Chen pointed at him.

Li Jiao felt cold all over his body. When he heard the man thanking him, he thought that he might be let off; however, upon hearing these last words, Li Jiao understood that he would be killed soon. [Forget it. Fu Chi will end up in a miserable state, so I’ve gotten revenge for San Niang. I’ve fulfilled my promise as a man, so I can die with no regrets.]

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to flee, but he knew that he wouldn’t stand a chance to escape from this man. He would only be killed sooner if he made a rash move. Therefore, Li Jiao decided to close his eyes and waited calmly for the end to come.

Right then, a sudden change happened. A strange aura pulsed from Wu Chen’s body, and at that instant, his expression contorted as he growled, “Old fart, what are you doing?”

Wu Chen immediately stepped backwards as a myriad of expressions flickered across his face. At the same time, two different auras began clashing with one another inside his body, an extremely eerie sight to behold.

Li Jiao stared at him in shock, not knowing what was wrong with him.

“Stop being so presumptuous! If you dare spoil my good deed, I’ll never let you off! Don’t you think I can’t devour you too!” The man growled again as the conflict between the two auras intensified. The confrontation between the auras also made Li Jiao’s skin feel painful.

Baffled, Li Jiao thought that the man was speaking to himself, as though he was suffering from a split personality. Li Jiao had lived in this world for thousands of years and seen countless strange things, but it was the first time he came across such an incident.

As Wu Chen spoke, both his hands started moving. What was strange though was that each hand was performing a different set of hand seals at the same time. Their movements were so rapid that Li Jiao couldn’t even see them clearly.

He was especially shocked by the complexity and abstrusity of the hand-seals, as he had never seen or heard anything remotely similar before.

A moment later, Wu Chen turned his head and glared at Li Jiao. With a contorting and hideous face, he said through gritted teeth, “Why are you still here? Are you sick of living?”

Li Jiao was flabbergasted. Realizing something, he pointed at the man and said, “You…”

Wu Chen growled, “Look for Yang Kai now and tell him…”

However, Wu Chen suddenly cut himself off and bellowed, “There’s no use looking for anyone! No one can stop me today!”

[Two Souls in one body! This man has two Souls in his body!] It was then that Li Jiao understood why this man was behaving so strangely. There were actually two Souls residing in his body, which was why he kept talking to and contradicting himself. Initially, he wanted to kill Li Jiao, but the next moment, he told him to flee immediately.
