Chapter 997, I’ll Eat You

Inside the Purple Star Starship, Yang Kai didn’t even try to conserve his Saint Qi, condensing one Grand Heavenly Shield after another, forming at least one hundred of them.

Of the Yang Liquid stored in his dantian, he had instantly consumed more than twenty drops.

He had then used his Demon God Transformation, filling his body with a malevolent aura and summoning his invisible Demon Crests in order to further enhance his vitality and physical defence.

He had done everything he could, and could now only meet fate head-on.

A Heaven shaking crash filled Yang Kai’s ears in the next moment, nearly deafening him while he simultaneously felt the Saint King Grade High-Rank Starship instantly tear apart and shatter into tiny pieces.

Screams filled the air as many powerful life auras all of a sudden vanished. The moment the two Starships had collided, the Purple Star cultivators had clearly suffered serious casualties.

Yang Kai felt like he was stuck on a small boat in the middle of the sea while a great storm whirled around him, his life in constant danger.

The Grand Heavenly Shields which he had erected for his protection rapidly began to crack and shatter, and within just two short breaths, all one hundred of them had been destroyed.

Out of the corner of his eye, Yang Kai saw the Chart Master, Wu Suo, get ripped apart by the tidal forces and burst into a bloody fog, not even leaving behind any bones.

Yang Kai felt his own body being crushed and pulled apart all at once, as if the forces around him were trying to grind even his bones to dust.

*Xiu xiu xiu...* Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The fragments of the two Starships whipped about in all directions at frightening speed, each of them carrying with them shocking and deadly force. Yang Kai soon felt something strike his head after which he immediately lost consciousness.

Inside the Chaotic Abyss, the two Saint King-Grade High-Rank Starships which collided broke up into millions of pieces of debris which, along with all the surviving Sword Union and Purple Star cultivators, were swallowed up by the huge black hole, leaving no trace they ever existed behind.

After a long time, the Chaotic Abyss’ turbulent energy fields gradually stabilized and became regular again; the huge black hole that had opened up in the Starry Sky also slowly disappeared.

When everything was over, the Chaotic Abyss became so calm that no one would have been able to imagine that just a short while ago, two giant Starships and hundreds of cultivators had fought a desperate battle here.

......

When Yang Kai woke up and opened his eyes, he looked up and saw a strange seven coloured sky. It was a beautiful yet otherworldly sight.

He tried to turn his eyes down to see confirm his condition, but he quickly discovered that even such simple movements were beyond his current ability. His entire body was in a state of paralysis where he couldn’t feel anything of it at all.

Circulating his Saint Qi, Yang Kai slowly began to move his hands and feet, allowing his blood flow to pick up and relieve his paralysis.

Gradually, Yang Kai began to feel pain from all over his body, as if he had been hit by a series of mountains from all directions, causing him to grimace in pain.

Suddenly remembering everything he had experienced just before passing out, Yang Kai let out a deep sigh, feeling extremely thankful to even be alive right now.

It was only then that he realized that he wasn’t being supported by anything and was falling down at an extremely fast speed.

Pushing his aching body, he somehow managed to turn himself over and see what he was falling towards.

As he turned over, Yang Kai saw pieces of the two Starships as well as a number of cultivators falling along with him. Some of these bodies had vitality, some did not, and there was also no shortage of broken limbs and chunks of flesh spread around as well.

Down below him, Yang Kai saw a continent.

But this continent was very different from any he had seen before, it was actually just floating mid-air, without anything supporting or holding it in place.

The size of this continent wasn’t small. Seeing it from several kilometres up, Yang Kai estimated that it was as big as the entire Great Han Dynasty.

The continent was lush and verdant, beautiful and refreshing like a spring day.

[What is this?] Yang Kai frowned.

He knew almost nothing about the Star Field, and what little he did know he had learned while chatting with Shen Tu in the power room over the past few days.

However, what he did know was that this floating continent was definitely not a star in the Chaotic Abyss.

Because he had seen the local stars in the Chaotic Abyss and none of them looked anything remotely like the continent below him.

The Purple Star Starship was in the Chaotic Abyss, collided with the Sword Union Starship, shattered into pieces, and was then swallowed by a massive black hole, so how did Yang Kai suddenly arrive at this floating continent?

Thinking about it, Yang Kai guessed that the massive black hole may have been something similar to a Void Corridor entrance and had transported him here.

However, this place didn’t look anything like a Mysterious Small World and much more closely resembled the Chaotic Abyss.

All around the huge floating continent, in every direction, was a seven coloured sky, and the air here was filled with incomparably rich World Energy that caused one to unconsciously feel relaxed and happy.

It was as if the rich World Energy that circulated through the Chaotic Abyss all gathered here.

Yang Kai pondered over these issues while simply letting himself continue to fall down, but a moment later, he quickly realized that his situation wasn’t good.

If he survived that disaster, some of the Purple Star masters must have as well.

During his brief moment of contemplation, others had also begun waking up around him, and sweeping his surroundings, Yang Kai quickly spotted Bi Ya.

Yang Kai swiftly hid behind a big piece of Starship debris and began looking for Shen Tu.

To his regret though, Yang Kai didn’t find any trace of Shen Tu, and couldn’t even be sure if he had survived the previous disaster or not.

In the sky, many people began flying about, waking up their comrades while rescuing those who were still alive but badly injured.

These people also spotted some of their enemies who were still passed out and subsequently let them sleep forever.

In some places, small-scale battles had broken out.

With the cultivators from Purple Star and Sword Union all in the same place. Naturally, they wouldn’t just let each other off.

Yang Kai took the opportunity to sneak away and try to find somewhere in this strange place to hide.

How could he have expected that just as he began moving, an angry and sullen shout would reach his ear, “Little bastard where are you trying to run!”

Afters Bi Ya opened her eyes, the first person she searched for was none other than Yang Kai.

Because of Yang Kai, she had been punished by Lu Gui Chen and suffered a Divine Sense attack that nearly left a permanent injury on her Soul. Naturally, she hated Yang Kai to death.

When Yang Kai moved, she had noticed him.

As she shouted, she summoned a Dragon Bone Whip into her luscious jade hand. This Dragon Bone Whip was clearly a high-grade artifact and immediately soared through the air like a great Azure Dragon, slamming towards Yang Kai’s head.

Yang Kai was uninterested in dealing with her and simply sent out a casual palm strike towards her Dragon Bone Whip, using the resulting impact to further accelerate himself and fly away

“Hmph!” A cold snort suddenly resounded next to him, causing Yang Kai to pale. Quickly glancing to his side, Yang Kai met eyes with the Saint King Realm master named Lu Gui Chen who had at some point appeared beside him.

He stared at Yang Kai indifferently, as if he was observing an ant, and then reached out his hand, calmly and easily grasping towards him.

His movements weren’t fast by any means, but Yang Kai found that in front of him, he was actually unable to muster any kind of resistance, as if the other side only needed a single thought to destroy him.

Yang Kai became panic-stricken.

The next moment, Lu Gui Chen seized Yang Kai’s neck and coldly asked, “Grandmaster Wu Suo?”

Before the Starship accident, the closest one to Grandmaster Wu Suo was Yang Kai. It was because of this that Lu Gui Chen had sought out Yang Kai personally; otherwise, how could someone of his status and strength possibly lower himself to perform such a menial task?

“Dead!”

Despite having already suspected as much, Lu Gui Chen’s expression still became gloomy upon hearing Yang Kai’s answer.

Now that their Purple Star cultivators had arrived in this strange place, the only hope they had of escape was their Chart Master, because only Chart Masters had detailed knowledge about the Star Field, making Wu Suo the most likely candidate to find a way to leave wherever they were now.

Having learned what he wanted to know, he instantly lost all interest in Yang Kai and casually tossed him over to Bi Ya.

“If there are any problems again, deal with it yourself!” Lu Gui Chen coldly snorted.

“Senior can rest assured, I will definitely drain every last drop of his vitality and let him die without a burial!” Bi Ya gnashed her teeth, her beautiful face twisting with madness like a venomous snake.

Saying so, her beautiful eyes filled with hostility as they glared towards Yang Kai, as if she couldn’t wait to start tormenting him.

Yang Kai face filled with bitterness but he didn’t say a word.

Yang Kai didn’t know what kind of method Lu Gui Chen has used on him, but right now he couldn’t use any of his Saint Qi. Without his cultivation, no matter how sturdy his physique was, he definitely wasn’t Bi Ya’s opponent.

It wasn’t until now that Yang Kai clearly comprehended the huge gap between the Saint King Realm and the Saint Realm. On top of that, he figured that Lu Gui Chen shouldn’t be an ordinary Saint King Realm expert, clearly, he had very high attainments in this realm otherwise it would have been impossible for Lu Gui Chen to so easily suppress him.

Bi Ya grabbed Yang Kai and no longer paid any attention to the anything else around her, simply flying down towards the floating continent below.

Taking a deep breath, she inhaled the air of this continent and felt a sense of joy and relief from just having survived that terrifying disaster. Her full peaks heaved in an exaggerated matter. Her dress was also unconventional one with a wide opening in front, revealing a large amount of her jade white skin as well as her deep and inviting valley.

“How about we discuss this?” Yang Kai suddenly spoke.

“Little brat, don’t waste your breath”, Bi Ya smiled coldly, “No matter what, today you won’t escape, I’ll definitely eat you up.”

Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders and gestured to the front, “Sword Union also has a number of survivors who will soon arrive here, if you encounter them a fight is inevitable, I’ll help you kill them and in exchange, you don’t take advantage of me, how about it?”

“When did I ever take advantage of you?” Bi Ya seemed to become angry out of shame before she swept her eyes up and down him, sneering disdainfully, “Besides, who can a little First-Order Saint like you kill? You really overestimate yourself.”

“I was able to kill Ke Meng,” Yang Kai said lightly.

Bi Ya’s jaw dropped slightly as she stared at him with some shock, “Wasn’t Ke Meng just being too careless?”

She had obviously thought that Ke Meng was killed by Yang Kai because he was caught off guard, not because Yang Kai possessed greater strength.

“No matter what you say, I won’t believe you anyway. This Great Aunt has never been deceived by a man before, you are the first!” Bi Ya snorted, “So when the situation here stabilizes, Elder Sister will take good care of you, I’ll certainly not disappoint!”

Watching her clenching her teeth, Yang Kai noted that Bi Ya seemed to be the extremely vengeful type, much to his misfortune.

Yang Kai shook his head and stopped talking to her, instead focusing on examining his own condition.
