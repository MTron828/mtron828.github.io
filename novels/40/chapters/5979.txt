Chapter 5978: The Way Forward

As the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction was about to break, it was pointless for Wu Kuang to stay connected to it any longer. In fact, he would even have to suffer the backlash if he remained.

So, the moment he realised that the situation was irreversible, he left the Grand Restriction as soon as possible.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

With this, he could at least ensure that he would not be injured. As for Yang Kai, who still remained inside, he was no longer able to provide much help to him regardless.

What caught the attention of the many Ninth-Order Masters, however, was the aura that Wu Kuang was displaying at this moment.

Wu Kuang’s existence was known only to a few Human Race Masters. They knew that he was sent here by Yang Kai to guard the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, but no one knows how strong he was, not even Yang Kai; after all, when he sent Wu Kuang here, he was only in the Seventh Order Open Heaven Realm. Even though he later broke through to the Eighth Order and then the Ninth Order, no one had any close contact with him, so they could only speculate on his strength.

At this moment, Wu Kuang’s strength was finally revealed to the world.

He was at the peak of the Ninth Order! He was even stronger when compared to Xiao Xiao and Wu Qing, the oldest veteran Masters of the Human Race.

In the situation they were facing, having another peak Ninth-Order Master would be of great help; however, something unexpected happened before the Humans could even rejoice.

Wu Kuang’s departure from the Grand Restriction sped up its destruction. Even more cracks appeared, and soon, the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, which had persisted for millions of years, shattered like a broken mirror.

Glowing dots of light filled the void, and as the light dissipated, boundless black filled one’s vision

The blackness seemed to possess a life of its own, writhing and rolling as the auras of an uncountable number of beings could be felt inside of it.

Before the Grand Restriction broke, the Black Ink Clan could only leave through that one opening, so even at the height of the Human Crusade Force’s crisis, not too many Black Ink Clan reinforcements could get out at once, this allowed them to maintain a degree of control over the situation.

But now, things have changed. With the complete destruction of the Grand Restriction, all of the Black Ink Clansmen hiding inside of it were instantly released.

No one had any idea just how many Black Ink Clansmen were still hidden in that abyss of darkness; the only thing that the Humans could feel glad about was the fact that they had killed many of the Black Ink Clan Masters before, which relieved some of the pressure they had to face at this moment.

The Human Race Army waited with bated breath, but to their surprise, not a single Black Ink Clansman emerged from the sea of Black Ink Strength even after some time had passed.

They seemed to be fearful of something.

Soon, the Human Race Masters realised what it was. It was Zhang Ruo Xi that the Black Ink Clan was afraid of.

The power she had shown earlier was beyond comprehension, surpassing even that of the Giant Spirit Gods, allowing her to kill Royal Lords like she was cutting melons or chopping vegetables.

At the moment, Zhang Ruo Xi stood at the very forefront of the Small Stone Race Army. Despite standing alone, her presence was still intimidating enough that the Black Ink Clan did not dare to move rashly.

Even though the white wings spread behind her back were small in the face of the darkness that covered everything the eye could see, the light emitting from her was far too bright for any darkness to truly cover.

The Ninth-Order Masters could not help but feel a little embarrassed at this. If Zhang Ruo Xi had not soared across the skies to their aid, their second crusade would have already failed. If that were to be the case, then they would have no choice but to retreat through the path that Yang Kai had prepared for them, to follow him to seek a new life in a new world.

But who would know what that new world would be like?

In front of the massive enemy Army, Zhang Ruo Xi remained calm and steady. On the other hand, in the void before her, the Black Ink Strength surged. The Black Ink Clan were too terrified to even move.

The power of a single person could actually be so terrifying.

All of a sudden, Zhang Ruo Xi’s expression changed. Her eyes narrowed slightly as she stared into the depths of the black abyss.

Seemingly noticing something, her wings flapped behind her and she turned into a stream of white light, instantly disappearing into the sea of darkness.

From afar, a voice reached Mi Jing Lun’s ears, “Sir is inside, I’ll go and check on him.”

In an instant, the Black Ink Ocean became even more agitated. It was clear that Zhang Ruo Xi was not merely going over to check out the situation. Inside the void that was filled with all the Black Ink Clansmen, she couldn’t reach Yang Kai without cutting a bloody path through them.

…

In the Primordial World, the aftermath of the chaos in Dawn City was still lingering. Just now, everyone saw a figure at the edge of the city soaring into the skies before disappearing without a trace, and after that person disappeared, the black lights that fell from the sky also disappeared.

Even though the unusual phenomenon was gone, the panic it caused would not ease for some time.

The Saintess and Li Fei Yu looked in that direction together, a pondering look in their eyes.

They knew that the first Saintess lived in seclusion at that location, and they had a sneaking suspicion that what they saw was related to her.

Shortly after Mo departed, Yang Kai returned to this place, drawn by the power of Mu’s shadow.

The first thing he saw was Mu, who was standing in front of the small house.

“Senior!” Yang Kai shouted.

Mu turned to look in his direction, seemingly expecting him, “You’re here.”

“Where’s Little Eleventh?” Yang Kai looked around; though, he had a vague guess when he did not see his small figure around.

Sure enough, Mu replied, “He has awakened, and the sealed Source pieces have all returned one after the other. This Universe World cannot withstand his power, but he was unwilling to destroy it, so he has left my Space-Time River already.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly, “I understand.”

The final battle was upon him, and he had done all that he could; whether they won or lost would depend on the final fight.

“Senior, since Mo has awakened, it is time for me to go. The power that the Human Race has at this time may not be enough to hold him back, but we will do our best. The last shadow of yours I met told me to come back and see you, and that you would show me the way forward, so I hope that Senior can enlighten me.”

“You have already found your way forward,” Mu looked at him with a smile in her gaze.

“Huh?” Yang Kai did not understand.

“You’ve chosen the same path that I have,” Mu added.

Yang Kai was thoughtful, “Condensing 10,000 Grand Daos in one’s own body and manifesting the Space-Time River?”

Mu nodded lightly, “As I told you before, everyone has their own Space-Time River, which starts flowing from the day they are born and ends at the day they die. However, since the start of time, few have been able to manifest their Space-Time River. I was the first, while you are the second!” Saying so, she suddenly asked Yang Kai a question, “The Open Heaven Realm Method cultivated by the Human Race is flawed. You must have noticed, yes?”

Yang Kai nodded, “The Ninth-Order is the limit of the Open Heaven Realm Method, but I had a vague feeling that the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm is not the end of Martial Dao. There should be a higher realm above the Ninth Order, above the Open Heaven Realm.”

“There is indeed a higher realm above the Ninth Order,” Mu gave him an affirmative answer.

Yang Kai was astonished, “Has Senior reached it?”

Embarrassedly, Mu shook her head, “If I had reached it, the Human Race would not be in this predicament today. Even though I have not reached it… I did touch upon it.”

Yang Kai could not help but praise her in his heart, [as expected of the strongest among the Martial Ancestors.]

Cang told him back then that the Martial Ancestors were still only in the Ninth Order, but they were stronger as they had gone further along the path. It was just that they had still yet to leave the bounds of the Open Heaven Realm.

However, Mu told him today that she had touched the profound realm above the Open Heaven Realm. Even if she had only touched it and not reached it, it was still an extraordinary achievement.

Mu recalled an old memory and slowly began, “The Open Heaven Realm Method was born out of necessity at a time when the Human Race was in a difficult situation. The Early Ancient Era Great Monsters were rampaging throughout the Universe, and without the Open Heaven Realm Method, the Human Race would have been nothing but food and slaves for them. During that time, the Heavens were quietly beginning to favour the Human Race, so it devised a way out for them, the Open Heaven Realm Method. Only with it can the Human Race give rise to a constant stream of Masters, which gave them the capital to contend with the Early Ancient Era Great Monsters.”

“However, even the Heavens have their selfishness. For example, the Primordial World. Once one’s cultivation surpasses the Immortal Ascension Realm, they would receive its repulsion and hostility; that is the selfishness of the Primordial World. One can also see it as its instinct for self-preservation. The Universe is not unchanging as its blessings were first concentrated on the Divine Spirits before moving to the Early Ancient Era Monster Race, then finally to us, the Human Race. Over time, the three Races became the favoured of the Heavens and were given the right to dominate all beneath it.” She turned to Yang Kai, “Why do you think this happened?”

Yang Kai pondered for a moment, “If one Race becomes too powerful, then they are no longer fearful of the Heavens, and once the power they hold becomes strong enough to oppose it, it creates a sense of crisis in the Heavens. Hence, there will be a transfer of its blessing.”

He had considered such a thing before, so he was able to give a quick answer to Mu’s question.

Mu nodded, “Precisely. The Universe lives, and it has its own Will. Principles are a part of its Will, but it is not the same as us living beings. It is above us as all beings are under its Will. If any power that surpasses its control were to come to be, it would move to remedy the situation, but it does not take action itself, and it certainly does not have the power to do so. So, it uses the power of other beings to restore order from chaos and ensure that everything remains on the predetermined path. This is reflected in history from long ago, when the Early Ancient Era Monster Race overthrew the Divine Spirits, and when the Human Race freed itself from the slavery of the Early Ancient Era Monster Race.”

“But Senior, what does this have to do with my path?” Yang Kai looked perplexed.

Mu continued, “Naturally it is all related. Because the Open Heaven Realm Method was a gift Willed by the Heavens, it is also a kind of shackle. It is impossible to break free from these shackles of the Open Heaven Realm Method by using the Open Heaven Realm Method. In fact, there is only one place in existence that the Heavens’ Will cannot cover, and everything that happens and is obtained there is not under the control of the Heavens!”

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up and he blurted out, “The Universe Furnace!” He could just about understand what Mu was getting at now.

“I’ve never understood what the Universe Furnace is, but it is definitely a place beyond the Heavens’ influence,” Mu asserted.

Yang Kai thought to himself, [of course the Heavens can’t interfere with it, because the Universe itself was created inside the Universe Furnace. It could even be considered the origin of the Heavens.] 

He had coincidentally seen the true face of the Universe Furnace and witnessed the process of it taking in Chaos and splitting Heaven and Earth apart.

He wanted to discuss all this with Mu, but time was running out and he could not figure out a way to explain everything in a timely manner, so he had no choice but to endure the urge for now.

“You and I have ventured into the Universe Furnace, and we have seen the Infinite River that flows through it, which led to us condensing our own Space-Time Rivers.” Mu turned to Yang Kai, “The Space-Time River is your path forward!”
