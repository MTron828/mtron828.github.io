Beneath the lake, Yang Kai held his breath and concentrated with a frown. The auras of the three Open Heaven Realm Masters above him were like bright lights in the dark night, so how could he not perceive them?

[Have my whereabouts been exposed? That shouldn’t be. I have not revealed any flaws. These three are probably hanging around for some other reason.]

Under the current circumstances, he did not dare to move about rashly. He was unfamiliar with the land and the people in Lang Ya Paradise, so finding a new hiding place would not be easy. If he was discovered here, then he would need to continue escaping.

A World Force that seemed rather familiar suddenly surged violently from above. Immediately after that, Yang Kai was astonished to discover that the water in the lake was seething fiercely. The water ascended all at once, as though there was an invisible force pulling it upward. In the blink of an eye, all the water in the lake became suspended in mid-air and the scenery at the depths became unobstructed.

High up in the sky, Senior Brother Zhao’s World Force fluctuated vigorously. He was holding his hands above his head in a lofty manner. It was obvious that the anomaly in the lake was caused by a Secret Technique that he used. The lake might be large, but such a feat was not difficult for a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master like him.

The two Junior Brothers by the side praised Senior Brother Zhao greatly, “Senior Brother Zhao, you are amazing!”

“Your skills are truly strong and powerful, Senior Brother Zhao! This Junior Brother is impressed!”

Senior Brother Zhao stood with his nose in the air as usual but humbly replied, “It’s nothing. These are just some paltry tricks... Huh?”

Before he could finish speaking, he glanced at the bottom of the lake out of the corner of his eye and noticed something. There was a familiar figure standing there, silently gawking at him.

The other two Junior Brothers also noticed Yang Kai at this moment. They were both surprised and delighted as they shouted, “Your genius truly knows no bounds, Senior Brother Zhao! That bastard really was hiding here!”

At the bottom of the lake, Yang Kai was feeling speechless. [How did you find me when I hid myself so thoroughly? They are not giving me the chance to have a peaceful and quiet life at all! I only came to Lang Ya Paradise for the Black Ink Clan and the people corrupted by the Black Ink. Just what sin did I commit for this calamity to befall me!?]

Looking at the instigator known as Senior Brother Zhao, Yang Kai was filled with resentment!

Senior Brother Zhao suddenly had an ominous feeling, but before he could react, he saw Yang Kai slowly throwing a punch in his general direction.

“Cow Punch!”

*Pu...*

His Small Universe was shaken by the impact. Consequently, fresh blood spurted out of his mouth and his aura slumped instantly. The whole scenario seemed strangely familiar...

“Senior Brother Zhao!” The two Junior Brothers nearby were shocked by the sight.

Before their voices could even carry far, all the lake water that was being suspended in mid-air by Senior Brother Zhao’s Secret Technique came crashing down. This was the result of his Small Universe being bombarded by Yang Kai’s Cow Punch. His Small Universe had been shaken so badly that his World Force could not flow properly.

When the huge amount of lake water came crashing down, the entire Spirit Province seemed to tremble from the impact.

Yang Kai’s figure penetrated the falling lake water and charged towards Senior Brother Zhao with an air of cold hostility.

Senior Brother Zhao’s expression changed drastically as he shouted, “Watch out!”

He struggled to mobilise his World Force and swung his fist at Yang Kai. Unfortunately, due to the severe shock to his Small Universe, he couldn’t even muster up enough strength to rival a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master’s power with this blow.

Yang Kai raised his hand and parried the attack easily. At the same time, he punched out and hit Senior Brother Zhao directly in the face.

A violent force erupted and stars burst out in Senior Brother Zhao’s vision as he plummeted to the ground like a meteorite falling out of the sky.

The reaction of the two Junior Brothers in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm were not slow. When Senior Brother Zhao took the hit, they simultaneously attacked from both sides, using the best Secret Techniques and Divine Abilities they could in that short time, throwing everything they had at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai abruptly turned his head to look at the person on his left and grinned savagely. Under the disbelieving stare of the other party, he took the attack head on just to close in on him.

The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was instantly shocked to the core! There were no life-or-death grudges between them, so he had held back in his attack; nevertheless, even if he held back his strength, he was still a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. No ordinary Master could have taken his attacks so lightly.

Be that as it may, Yang Kai had taken the attack head-on without flinching. The expression on his face barely even changed.

Therefore, the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master wondered whether he had held back too much. The power of his Secret Technique might have failed to come through as a result. Before the thought could finish forming in his head though, a fist slammed into his lower abdomen. An indescribably terrifying force burst out, and he immediately doubled over in pain, his complexion going pale.

“Get down!” Yang Kai flipped around and kicked his victim to the ground. That man crashed down beside the unconscious Senior Brother Zhao.

Having witnessed his two Senior Brothers suffering such a brutal fate, how could the remaining Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master remain ignorant of Yang Kai’s strength? In his desperation, he didn’t even dare to hold back his strength and fiercely urged the power of his Small Universe. His palms transformed into palm shadows that covered the entire sky, looming down on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai ignored the attacks and lunged towards the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Charging straight at the man, he easily countered the attack under the other party’s horrified gaze.

The two of them became entangled in battle, and their World Forces collided viciously. As soon as they exchanged blows with each other though, the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master immediately felt an ominous sensation. The heritage of his Small Universe was significantly weaker than the other party’s. Such a reckless fight would definitely end in a loss for him. Unfortunately, he was stuck riding a tiger and could not get down. It was impossible for him to get away from Yang Kai now.

Three moves later, his complexion turned deathly pale and his figure became unsteady. Five moves later, he was seeing stars. His Small Universe was shaking uncontrollably like an ancient building that had just experienced an earthquake. Accordingly, his fighting ability decreased steadily.

“You get down too!” Yang Kai shouted and his palm came smashing down.

The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master screamed in agony and dropped straight to the ground. His fall created a large crater. Lying in the middle of the depression, he couldn’t find the strength to move at all.

Looking up at the young man descending from the sky, all three Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters of Lang Ya Paradise lying side-by-side on the ground experienced a mixture of extremely complicated emotions.

They were all Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, but the other party had defeated all three of them on his own in such a short span of time. Not to mention, it was an overwhelmingly one-sided victory. All parties had held back since they were not fighting a life-or-death battle, but even if it had been a real battle, these three were certain that they would not have fared any better.

[Is he really a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master? Is there such a powerful Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master? How is this possible?!]

Yang Kai landed in front of those three and clasped his hands behind his back. Looking down at them from above, he smacked his lips and asked, “Why did you have to do this, Senior Brothers? Would it kill you to leave me hiding safely below? Why did you have to force me to reveal myself?”

Two of the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters looked ashamed, but Senior Brother Zhao remained resolute. Even though he was lying on the ground, his head remained raised slightly. He didn’t even look straight at Yang Kai and only glanced at him out of the corner of his eyes.

Yang Kai noticed Senior Brother Zhao’s posture and wondered, [Is he really that stubborn?]

Thinking about it again, this person had fought Yang Kai twice. On both occasions, he had been injured by the Cow Punch Secret Technique before he could even do anything. It was only natural that he felt resentful inside. After all, it was understandable for disciples of the Cave Heavens and Paradises to be somewhat prideful of their respective strengths.

At this moment, the Disciple Tokens hanging around the trio’s waists suddenly fluctuated with a weak pulse of energy in unison. They quickly checked the message, and a few moments later, Senior Brother Zhao sighed and said, “It’s our defeat, so we will withdraw now. In the future, we won’t cause any more trouble for you.”

“Quit what?” Yang Kai scowled deeply.

Senior Brother Zhao replied, “The Sect Master issued an order...”

“Senior Brother Zhao!” One of the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters nearby quickly interrupted.

The people who successfully captured Yang Kai would obtain the opportunity to enter the Five Lights World for training. That was the order issued directly by the Sect Master himself; however, it would seem that Yang Kai was ignorant of the situation. Since he did not know, then it would be better to continue keeping him in the dark; after all, if the news were to spread that all the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in Lang Ya Paradise had mobilised against a single person in their own territory, Lang Ya Paradise would undoubtedly lose a lot of face.

Yang Kai glanced at the one who spoke earlier before he turned to look at Senior Brother Zhao pensively, “Are you hiding something from me?”

The person who spoke earlier quickly denied, “No! No! It’s nothing! Junior Brother Yang, you’ve misunderstood me!”

“Is that so?” Yang Kai grinned savagely. Then, he formed a fist with one hand and an open palm with the other. Palming his fist, the thudding sound of flesh against flesh echoed as he approached them slowly.

“We’ve already lost. What else are you going to do to us?” All three of them turned pale with fright.

A short while later, Yang Kai stood in front of the three people whose faces were swollen and bruised and snarled through gritted teeth, “Li Yuan Wang, I’ll get you back for this!”

He never imagined that Li Yuan Wang would use him as a sharpening stone to train the Lang Ya Paradise disciples. Li Yuan Wang had even gone so far as to issue an order saying that the person who managed to capture Yang Kai would obtain the right to enter the Five Lights World for training as a reward.

This was something that had been puzzling Yang Kai recently. After hiding for a few days, it seemed like this incident was going to blow over and things were about to end peacefully. Contrary to his expectations, however, the storm suddenly kicked up again for some reason. The number of people searching for him increased dramatically. Moreover, they were much more enthusiastic than before.

It turned out Li Yuan Wang was pulling the strings all along!

The chance to train inside a Small Source World was an extremely precious opportunity even in the Cave Heavens and Paradises. How could the Open Heaven Realm Masters not go all out with such a reward being offered?

However, there was one thing Yang Kai could not understand.

[Li Yuan Wang knows the real reason I came to Lang Ya Paradise. Since he knows, why is he doing this? Isn’t it better to investigate quietly? Unless... He is trying to muddy the waters? It’ll be easier to blind the fish and catch them all in one fell swoop that way!]

All of a sudden, Yang Kai understood Li Yuan Wang’s ideas and intentions. [Even so, would it kill you to inform me beforehand!? You issued the order without even telling me anything! If not for my strength, the person lying on the ground with a swollen and bruised face would have been me instead!]

Li Yuan Wang’s order could not be concealed. Yang Kai was bound to learn the truth sooner or later. It was only out of this consideration that Senior Brother Zhao and the two others had revealed this matter to Yang Kai lest they suffer at his hands again.

Be that as it may, Li Yuan Wang had issued another order just now. Those who were defeated by Yang Kai would have to withdraw and could no longer participate in this training. There was no doubt that this order was beneficial to Yang Kai. He could not kill the Lang Ya Paradise disciples after all, so even if he defeated them, they could simply recover and make a comeback. If that were the case, it would only form an endless cycle.

[Is he planning to make me fight all of the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in Lang Ya Paradise!?] There was no saying whether Yang Kai might be able to discover something in the process of fighting, but that was undoubtedly what Li Yuan Wang was aiming for!

It was not to say that this was not a valid method, but... Yang Kai could not help feeling very displeased. For some reason, he felt as though he had been used. Anybody else in his shoes would not have been comfortable with the idea either.

Fixing his gaze upon Senior Brother Zhao and the other two, Yang Kai suddenly thought of something and grinned. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The three of them had been beaten so badly by Yang Kai that they were now traumatised. Thus, they subconsciously shuddered in fear under his seemingly predatory gaze. Senior Brother Zhao, as the group's leader, plucked up his courage and asked warily, “What do you want?”

Yang Kai responded with a straight face, “Don’t be nervous. You’re Senior Brother Zhao, right? Your Space Ring looks very exquisite. I like it very much! Can I have a look?”

Senior Brother Zhao couldn’t help widening his eyes at those words. [Isn’t this daylight robbery!?]

Most of his wealth was contained inside his Space Ring. If he were robbed of everything, then how was he supposed to survive in the future? Therefore, he immediately clutched at his Space Ring and yelled, “Don’t even think about it!”

Silavin: Honestly, I think it is kinda bullshit how the author changed the rarity of Sixth-Order materials.
