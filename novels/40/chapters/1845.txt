In Five Paths Chamber of Commerce’s backyard, Hua You Meng, Gao Hong, and the others looked on in shock. Compared to Lu Tian Feng’s humility, they were more concerned about Yang Kai’s identity and why the Commander of Purple Star City’s Guard had changed his attitude so greatly after just meeting him.

None of the flattery Lu Tian Feng was touting even entered their ears as they only felt their heads spinning.

“There seems to have been a small misunderstanding here. I do not know where this Lu’s stupid subordinates heard such an outrageous rumour to make them believe a troublemaker was in this area, but it seems they acted hastily and came to make an arrest for no reason, causing varying degrees of damage to the personnel and property of your chamber of commerce. President Hua may rest assured, this Lu, as the Commander of the Guard, will absolutely not allow you to suffer a loss in vain. This Lu will deal with the situation promptly and seriously to give President Hua a satisfactory explanation,” Lu Tian Feng declared solemnly as he patted his chest and promised.

“Ah... en...” Hua You Meng smiled forcefully, “This matter cannot be entirely blamed on Vice Commander Bai, we are also somewhat responsible.”

Hearing what she said, Bai Zheng Chu’s eyes began to tear up as he looked towards Hua You Meng with eyes full of gratitude.

“Is that so?” Lu Tian Feng raised his brow before carefully glancing towards the nearby guest house and saying cautiously, “Since President Hua is so reasonable...”

“Hmph!” From the pavilion, a single snort sounded.

Lu Tian Feng shivered at this snort and sternly declared, “Even if President Hua is so reasonable, they should be punished for mistakes they made. As a member of the Purple Star City Guard, if they cannot follow the law, who will? If anyone can just rush into a business without cause and hit and abuse its employees, will any chambers of commerce ever open in Purple Star City? Vice Commander Bai, what do you say?”

How could Bai Zheng Chu not know he had kicked an iron plate this time? Walking up with a face filled with remorse, he bowed his head and said, “Subordinate acted rashly and mismanaged this situation. Subordinate apologizes to President Hua and asks Lord Commander to deliver appropriate punishment.”

Hua You Meng waved her hands frantically as she repeatedly claimed she wouldn’t dare.

Lu Tian Feng coldly and righteously declared, “For having eyes but failing to see, offended President Hua and Five Paths Chamber of Commerce. This sentences you to one month’s imprisonment inside the Frozen Prison, understood?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“The Frozen Prison!” Bai Zheng Chu shivered, his face going pale.

Just now he had said he would throw Xia Jing Wu and all the others into the Frozen Prison, but through a twist of fate, he was the one who was going to be imprisoned there. As one of the eight Vice Commanders of the City Guard, how could he not understand the horrors of the Frozen Prison?

That was a natural frozen world where one would freeze their Saint Qi no matter how high one’s cultivation was. In other words, once one entered the Frozen Prison, they could only rely on their physical strength to resist the bone-chilling cold.

But without Saint Qi, how many cultivators could resist such a frigid environment?

A month in the Frozen Prison was no different from being thrown into the gates of Hell!

“Hm?” Lu Tian Feng glared as he did not receive an immediate answer.

“Subordinate understands!” Bai Zheng Chu shrank his neck and nodded repeatedly.

“As long as you understand. En, this is just the punishment for the violence you committed against these good people. As for the damage you caused to Five Paths Chamber of Commerce... Hand over all your Space Rings.”

With Lu Tian Feng issuing such a command, who would dare to resist? One by one, like they had just been told their parents had been killed, all the guards took off their Space Rings and handed them over, including Bai Zheng Chu.

Lu Tian Feng smiled before handing the rings to Hua You Meng and saying, “President Hua, this Lu hopes you can be forgiving and not lower yourself to the same level as this group of idiots. This is compensation for your healing expenses.”

“Senior Lu...” Hua You Meng was completely dumbfounded. Facing the dazzling array of Space Rings, she did not dare refuse or accept, putting her at a loss for a moment.

“President Hua, please... please don’t refuse.” Lu Tian Feng said solemnly with a look that was almost pleading Hua You Meng to accept.

The man inside the nearby pavilion was still watching him, and Commander Lu knew that, if he did not handle this matter well, losing his position as Guard Commander would be the least of his worries.

Xia Jing Wu hurriedly stepped forward, chuckled, and cupped his fists to Lu Tian Feng, “Since Commander Lu has personally presided over justice, our Five Paths Chamber of Commerce will cooperate fully. Many thanks, Commander Lu, Commander Sir’s moral righteousness is worthy of admiration!”

“It’s my duty...” Lu Tian Feng took the opportunity to shove the Space Rings into Hua You Meng’s hand before quietly wiping the cold sweat from his forehead, thinking that the matter was finally completed. Although things had not been settled perfectly, he had at least made his position clear.

“What are you still doing stupidly standing here? Scram to the Frozen Prison to serve your punishment!” Lu Tian Feng roared at Bai Zheng Chu and the others.

“Yes!” Bai Zheng Chu and the other guards quickly fled, trembling in terror.

After all his subordinates disappeared, Lu Tian Feng turned around, cupped his fists to the pavilion, and grovelled, “Sir, are you satisfied with the handling of this matter?”

Yang Kai’s voice soon came from the room, “Commander Lu surely jests, it is the Commander’s responsibility to maintain the peace in the city, rewarding the good and punishing the evil. As long as you are satisfied that justice has been served, what does it matter what this King thinks?”

Upon hearing this, Lu Tian Feng was immediately relieved, knowing the other party would no longer pursue this issue. Quickly bowing his head, he followed up, “What Sir says is absolutely correct. This Lu will take his leave then, please have a good rest, Sir!”

Saying so, he nodded politely to Hua You Meng and the others before quickly walking out.

Hua You Meng, Gao Hong, Xia Jing Wu, Yao Qing, Hai Tang, and all the other employees of Five Paths Chamber of Commerce stood dumbfounded, all of them wearing extremely strange expressions. Recalling the scenes that just played out before them, everyone felt like they were seeing some kind of impossible dream.

After a long silence, Hua You Meng snorted and exhaled fiercely, releasing a pink mist from her body. It was the remnants of the Flower Petal Raindrops that had been suppressing her Saint Qi.

“President, are you all right?” Gao Hong quickly looked over at her and asked.

Hua You Meng nodded lightly. She was, in fact, the only one who had remained unharmed in the conflict with Bai Zheng Chu just now; everyone else had suffered varying degrees of injuries.

“President, should we...” Gao Hong glanced in the direction of Yang Kai.

Hua You Meng slowly shook her head and said, “Uncle Xia, go close the shop and post notice that we will remain closed for the next five days. Have all the employees rest and tend to anyone who has injuries. Make sure we provide enough for everyone’s healing expenses. These rings... en, I’ll leave them in Uncle Xia’s care.”

“Yes.” Xia Jing Wu nodded while accepting the Space Rings.

“Yao Qing, Hai Tang, you two assist Uncle Xia,” Hua You Meng next called out to the side.

“En.” Hai Tang heard this and obediently nodded, but Yao Qing actually cast an indignant look towards the guest house and said, “I want to...”

“You want what?” Gao Hong cut him off abruptly, “Hurry up and get out!”

Yao Qing could not help rolling his eyes, but he still shut his mouth and followed Xia Jing Wu and Hai Tang out.

In a blink of an eye, only Gao Hong and Hua You Meng were left. The two women looked at each other and saw the hesitation in each other’s eyes as they passed messages between themselves using their Divine Sense.

After a while, Hua You Meng sighed, turned around, and said, “For today’s matter, this Mistress offers her sincere thanks.”

“President Hua is too polite, it was just a slight effort,” Yang Kai smiled calmly. He heard both a little awe, fear, and even blame, in Hua You Meng’s tone, but that was only to be expected so he did not care too much about it.

“Sir must be tired; this Mistress won’t disturb Sir any further. Tomorrow, this Mistress will pay a visit to Sir again,” Hua You Meng whispered.

“Very well. President Hua must have many things to attend to, just attend to your own business.”

Hua You Meng nodded, winked at Gao Hong, and the two women withdrew one after another.

Inside the guest house, Yang Kai wore a helpless smile on his face as he appreciatively played with a token in his hand, muttering to himself, “I didn’t expect this thing to be so useful. Even someone like Lu Tian Feng was like a mouse seeing a cat the moment he saw it.”

Lu Tian Feng was a First-Order Origin King, and even if Yang Kai could suppress him by force, the reason he had been so deferential and respectful was all because of this token.

“Of course it is, that is one of my Purple Star’s Purple Star Orders. Anyone who holds this token has status equal to my Purple Star’s Great Elder. Lu Tian Feng is only a Guard Commander, so how could he dare act presumptuously in front of an Order holder?” Zi Dong’s voice suddenly came out as his Soul Avatar appeared from the Soul Sustaining Bowl which had been placed to the side by Yang Kai.

“How many of these did your Purple Star create?” Yang Kai asked.

Zi Dong thought for a while before replying, “As far as I know, only two have been given out, and both to Second-Order Origin Kings. The Purple Star Order not only represents elite status but even grants a certain degree of authority to mobilize my Purple Star’s resources and personnel. As such, only those who have made great contributions to Purple Star will receive them.”

“So that’s how it is.” Yang Kai nodded lightly, better understanding the value of this token.

He had found this thing in Zi Long’s Space Ring, and although the materials used to make it were rare and precious, Yang Kai hadn’t paid any attention to it until today.

He simply had no choice. His original plan was to act sneakily; steal the Star Emperor Token and then leave Purple Star. However, after Hua You Meng and Five Paths Chamber of Commerce appeared, he could no longer proceed as planned.

Although he was not afraid of confronting Lu Tian Feng, this was Purple Star City after all, and if he really were to fight this Guard Commander, it would only attract the attention of stronger opponents.

So, Yang Kai had asked Zi Dong if he had a way to deal with the situation.

Zi Dong had then recommended he use the Purple Star Order.

Giving it a try, it had worked perfectly.

Lu Tian Feng had arrived fiercely but left with his head almost touching the ground. With practically no effort, Yang Kai was able to resolve today’s issue.

Unfortunately, Purple Star would begin paying very close attention to him after this, which would make it far more difficult for him to steal the Star Emperor Token. Yang Kai secretly felt a headache coming on as he had to re-think his plans from scratch.

Considering all this, Yang Kai looked at Zi Dong and said, “Tell me about your Purple Star’s situation. What kind of masters there are and are there are any internal disputes?”

Although Zi Dong was very reluctant to cooperate, with his Soul now in Yang Kai’s hands, he did not dare to resist. Having been asked and with no other choice, he began honestly explaining many things about Purple Star to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai took down this information carefully because there was a chance some of it would be useful soon. He also asked a few questions when it came to key points, which Zi Dong coordinated with and explained everything he was able to.
