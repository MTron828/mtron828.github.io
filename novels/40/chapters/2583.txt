At this moment, Ruo Xi was hiding in the canopy of a huge tree, trying her best to conceal her aura.

She might be fairly strong now, but she didn’t want to get in trouble in this kind of place. Naturally, she was mainly hiding and waiting for Yang Kai’s arrival. [When Sir arrives and clashes against the Monster Race, I will immediately rush out to help Sir. I think Sir will not blame me at that time.]

Deep in her heart, she just wanted to help out a little, that’s all. She didn’t want to be taken into the Sealed Word Bead by Yang Kai and be forced to wait, feeling useless once again.

A team of patrolling Monster Race members passed by, but they didn’t notice Zhang Ruo Xi, boosting her confidence somewhat.

It was the first time she had done something this dangerous, so she was quite nervous. Fortunately, following Yang Kai here and there wasn’t without any merits. After having gone through storms and fire, she could reluctantly maintain her composure even if she was nervous deep inside.

Time went by little by little.

Another Monster Race patrol crossed in front of her, and this time they were incomparably vigilant and checking everything, seemingly looking for even the smallest of suspicious trails. When this patrol team passed under a certain tree, one of them suddenly stopped and sniffed the air.

“What happened?” Another Monster Race member looked at him and doubtfully asked.

The Monster Race member didn’t answer as he continued sniffing, taking some time before raising his brows and commenting, “There is the scent of a Human.”

As soon as he said this, Ruo Xi’s face drastically changed as she knew things had gone wrong. She might have revealed something, and once the Monster Race found her whereabouts, it would be difficult for her to escape even if she had wings.

All she could hope for was that this Monster Race member was just sceptical. In that case, she might still escape this calamity.

But her hope was smothered very soon. After sniffing for a while, the Monster Race member abruptly raised his head and stared at the canopy of the tree.

Although their gazes didn’t meet due to the thick foliage, Zhang Ruo Xi’s heartbeat raced and she knew that she could no longer remain hidden here.

Just when she made up her mind to escape, a dirty and dishevelled head suddenly appeared by her side, hanging upside down in front of her, grinning from ear to ear at her.

Ruo Xi was scared out of her wits and almost jumped back and shouted; however, after seeing who exactly this unkempt person was, she quickly covered her mouth, not daring to make any noises. Her bulging pretty eyes were just staring at the unkempt and dirty face.

Suddenly, a hand reached out towards Zhang Ruo Xi, grabbing her. Immediately after, the two figures flickered before disappearing from her spot.

*Shua…*

Right afterwards, a Monster Race member rushed to the canopy of the tree. He looked around for a while, but after finding nothing, scratched his head with a suspicious look on his face.

“Did you find something?” The Monster Race members waiting below asked.

“Nothing…” The searching Monster Race member replied before jumping down and continuing with an embarrassed smile, “I might have made a mistake.”

The Monster Race members of the patrol team glared at him, displeased. They blamed him for being so anxious that every bush and tree appeared as an enemy to him. Without another word, they continued on with their patrol.

Above the canopy of another towering tree, watching the Monster Race patrol team move away, Zhang Ruo Xi finally sighed in relief, her chest fiercely heaving up and down. At that moment, her heart had almost jumped out of her chest. She thought that she was going to die. Fortunately, someone had given her a hand at the critical moment.

She quickly turned her head and looked to one side.

Right next to her, Ice Heart Valley’s Third Elder was looking at her with a silly smile. On closer inspection, Ruo Xi realized that this woman was quite the beauty, it was just that she had lost her mind and was completely careless about maintaining her appearance. She had been living in the Ancient Lands all year round, which resulted in her face being completely covered in dirt and grime. Ruo Xi couldn’t help but sigh at her condition.

“What is Senior doing here?” Ruo Xi didn’t know what her name was, so she could only address her as Senior.

The Third Disciple giggled; who knows whether she understood Ruo Xi’s question or not. In any case, she didn’t look like she was going to be answering anything anytime soon. Instead, she kept sniffing like that Monster Race member, her nose almost stuck onto Ruo Xi. It appeared as if she took a particular liking to Ruo Xi’s fragrance as there was an intoxicated look on her face while she sniffed.

Ruo Xi was feeling very uncomfortable, almost like she was itchy all over. She quickly stretched her hand out before her, blocking the Third Disciple, stopping her from continuing. She then said, “Senior, please don’t cause trouble, or we will be found by the Monster Race.”

Being pushed away by her, the Third Disciples suddenly pouted, seemingly saddened.

Ruo Xi couldn’t bear the sight of her despondent look. She was a beautiful Second-Order Emperor Realm Master. If she was outside, countless men would admire and pursue her like she was an immortal fairy, but she looked nothing like a Human or ghost now. If her Master, Senior Bing Yun, came to know about this, her heart would surely break.

“Good, Senior, I have something important to do now, so please behave!” Zhang Ruo Xi reached out and grabbed the Third Disciple’s dirty paws without showing any aversion at all. She gently cupped her hands as she softly said, “I’m waiting for Sir here. Sir is the one who gave you that fruit last time. Sir has been looking everywhere for you, so don’t run around and wait for him here with me, okay?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The Third Disciple looked at Zhang Ruo Xi for a while before suddenly nodding.

Ruo Xi asked with a smile, “Can you understand me?”

The Third Disciple hugged Ruo Xi and buried her head in Ruo Xi’s plump peaks, scrabbling her head, doing whatever she wanted…

“Senior… I can’t breathe…” Ruo Xi’s face flushed red. A strange feeling rose from her chest, which made her feel slightly tingly. That tight groping made it even harder for her to breathe. In any case, she wasn’t as strong as the Third Disciple, so even if she wanted to free herself, she was unable to no matter how much she struggled.

…..

Ten kilometres away from the Blood Gate, as Mu Na had said earlier, after the changes at the Blood Gate, its inexplicable repulsion power seemed to have disappeared. Normally, the Blood Gate couldn’t be approached at all, and even the strongest Monster Kings would be reduced to nothing but a gory puddle of flesh and blood by its mysterious power once they tried, leaving not even a corpse behind. But now, even weak Monster Race members were swarming from every direction, their eyes red as if they had lost their minds. They were making a beeline towards the Blood Gate, trying to rush inside it.

This was due to the bloodline attraction!

As Xie Wu Wei had supposed earlier, after the changes in the Blood Gate, the aura of Divine Spirit Sources inside the Divine Spirit Palace were being revealed. This aura carried a great temptation to every resident of the Ancient Lands. These weak Monster Race members would rush over, hypnotized by the alluring aura, gradually losing their minds and flying straight towards the Blood Gate, throwing all caution to the wind.

But these Monster Race members were doomed to fail to approach even ten kilometres of the Blood Gate.

Because right now, eight figures were constantly patrolling around the Blood Gate, and once they found a Monster trying to get close, they would kill without mercy.

These eight Monster Race Masters were the Great Kings of each of the Four Great Divine Venerables.

Currently, corpses were lying everywhere outside the ten-kilometre radius of the Blood Gate. There was a nauseating smell of blood in the air. In just a few days, who knew how many Ancient Lands’ creatures had died at the hands of these eight Great Kings? Nevertheless, they still couldn’t prevent the countless Monster Race members from rushing to the Blood Gate.

On a peak about fifty kilometres away, four figures filled a stone pavilion, either sitting or standing. Some of the Monster Race members were respectfully guarding this pavilion, looking at the four figures in awe from time to time.

These four figures were none other than the Four Great Divine Venerables of the Ancient Lands.

The changes of the Blood Gate were of great importance, so the four of them had personally come to oversee and investigate the situation to prevent any mishaps.

The figure on the left side was a middle-aged man in purple brocade robes and a crown on his head. He looked no different than a normal Human, but there was an awe-inspiring aura about him. There was a lightning-like shine in his eyes, which gave anyone who met his gaze a chilling feeling. This man was the Easter Divine Venerable, Fan Wu.

The figure on the right resembled the Stone Spirits. He had a rock-like body and skin with a jagged texture. Only, he was lacking the temperateness of the Stone Spirits. His figure gave an extremely fierce feeling and, from top to bottom, he was covered in sharp barbs of stone. Even his face had a fierce and sinister look. There was an air of hostility around him and the shine in his eyes was like a mad flame, giving the impression that he was constantly looking for prey to eat.

He was the Northern Divine Venerable, Shi Huo!

In the Star Boundary, the other three domains might not have heard of Shi Huo’s name, but for Eastern Territory cultivators, Shi Hou was quite famous.

And there was a reason behind this. Roughly twenty thousand years ago, one of the top Sects of the Eastern Territory, the Black Tortoise Sect, was wiped from the face of the world by Shi Huo. Tens of thousands of its disciples had been massacred by him. The Serene Soul Great Emperor became furious when he got word of the brutal massacre and personally moved out to capture Shi Huo, but Shi Huo escaped to the Ancient Wild Lands.

Being able to escape from the pursuit of a Great Emperor was proof in itself of Shi Huo’s terrifying strength.

Maplewood City’s Qin Zhao Yang’s ancestor had once been a disciple of the Black Tortoise Sect. The Emperor Artifact, the Myriads Sword, was his ancestor’s sword. In the past, the Black-Tortoise Seven Points Formation taught by Qin Zhao Yang to Yang Kai was the closely guarded core technique of the Black Tortoise Sect, which wasn’t easily taught to ordinary disciples.

After the Black Tortoise Sect was destroyed, the Qin Family’s ancestor came to the Southern Territory and settled in Maplewood City. Not long afterwards, he succumbed to his injuries, and as the generations continued, his family declined.

At the centre of the stone pavilion was a stone table, on top of which was a pot of steaming hot fragrant tea.

A beautiful woman was sitting by the table, her skin as white as snow. She had an enchanting figure and charming eyes. Her silky hair was like a black waterfall falling behind her head, straight down to her hips. The beautiful woman stretched her soft and slender hand out and poured herself a cup of tea before calmly taking a sip of it.

She was the Southern Divine Venerable, Luan Feng!

If one didn’t know about her, they would not dare to believe that such a beautiful and charming woman was actually a Divine Spirit with an ancient inheritance. Anyone who dared to provoke her had been burned to ashes by her World Extinguishing Black Flames.

The last figure had a sinister and ruthless gaze. With one glance, it was apparent that he shouldn’t be provoked. He was sitting on the stone bench in front of Luan Feng, motionless, like he was petrified. Intentionally or unintentionally, his gaze was lingering on Luan Feng’s charming figure, but he didn’t dare to be too presumptuous. He was just sneaking a few peaks.

Luan Feng lightly took a sip of tea before her cherry red lips parted as she indifferently warned, “Cang Gou, if you stare at me again like that, this Queen will dig out your eyes!”

Hearing this, a look of fear flashed across the man called Cang Guo’s eyes, but he could only give an embarrassed smile as he asked, “Lady Feng, why are you keeping me at arm’s length? Don’t you know that this King has feelings for you?”

Luan Feng didn’t return his glance, her voice remaining indifferent as she snorted, “This Queen only knows that you are… Extremely disgusting.”

Silavin, Okay. so, the author forgot that it was supposed to be a black tortoise that attacked the Sect. Though, I guess it was so long ago that it might have been forgotten through time?
