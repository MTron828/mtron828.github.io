A giant palm seal slammed down from the sky, shattering space, and causing a series of explosions.

No one had expected Yang Kai to act so crazily. He was all alone in the middle of countless enemies, but not only did he not restrain himself, he even took the initiative to attack!

Sword Pavilion’s Sword Formation hadn’t been formed yet, and Thunder Light’s disciples were still shaken from what happened, so the best these people could do was hurriedly gather their strength and launch hasty Secret Techniques and Artifact attacks.

The giant palm seal was riddled with holes from the countless attacks, but it still continued to press down.

A series of miserable cries rang out as bloody mists exploded in the air one by one, like the most beautiful red roses in the world. Under the eyes of everyone present, blood-red flowers blossomed mid-air.

When this attack was done, thirty-three blood flowers bloomed, no more, no less.

A series of gasps rang out from all over the Star City as everyone stared incredulously at the figure hovering in the sky. Zhong Fan and the other’s eyes were practically spitting fire as they stared at this figure.

Thirty-three of Guo Zi Yan’s subordinates had died in battle, so Yang Kai had killed thirty-three Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light disciples in front of everyone just to avenge those who had died.

This arrogant act was undoubtedly a slap in the face of Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light, causing Zhong Fan and the others to feel their faces burn. Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light would not be able to survive in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary if they couldn’t kill Yang Kai today.

The long sword in Zhong Fan’s hand trembled slightly as his Sword Qi fluctuated wildly. He wanted nothing more than to rush up to Yang Kai and tear him to pieces right now, but with Lu Xue in Yang Kai’s hands, he didn’t dare act rashly.

Yang Kai suddenly turned his head and glared at Zhong Fan, shouting, “This King forgot, it’s not thirty-three! You’ve killed one more!”

As soon as these words were spoken, all of Thunder Light and Sword Pavilion disciples’ expressions changed drastically as they quickly retreated, putting some distance between them and Yang Kai. Although they had a lot of people, none of them wanted to haunt this world due to an unjust death!

In an instant, there was no one else within a kilometre of Yang Kai, apart from Zhong Fan and a few other Open Heaven Realm Masters.

The might of this one person was terrifying!

“What are you going to do?” Zhong Fan looked over coldly.

“Since you’ve invited me to watch a show, this King will also invite you to watch a show!” Saying so, the purple sword light that belonged to Lu Xue between his fingers turned and directly stabbed into Lu Xue’s chest, then with a palm strike, he plunged the purple sword straight into Lu Xue’s body!

Lu Xue let out a muffled groan as she used all her strength to resist the burning might of the Golden Crow True Fire. At this moment, she was injured by Yang Kai, causing her to sweat profusely. Her white clothes immediately became stained with blood. Her skin became redder as steam rose from her and she let out a painful cry.

“You court death!” Luo Qing Yun’s eyes instantly turned bloodshot as he shouted, grinding his teeth.

Zhong Fan’s expression instantly became dark and gloomy.

Although Yang Kai’s killing of thirty-three people with a single palm strike had made him angry, they were just a few disciples under him while most belonged to Thunder Light. He could replace them if they died, but Lu Xue was different. She was one of the Sword Pavilion’s leaders, and now that she had been tortured by Yang Kai like this, he had no choice but to re-examine Yang Kai’s madness.

Guo Zi Yan and the thirty or so Scarlet Star disciples who had been captured all were looking dispirited at first, but after witnessing Yang Kai’s series of unexpected actions with their own eyes, their morale was greatly lifted!

Their Sixth Manager was truly cold and cruel. He could even be so merciless towards a beauty like Lu Xue. If it was them, they might not be able to bear it, but they had to admit that seeing this scene really made them feel happy and their blood boil, making them feel warmth deep in their hearts. They couldn’t help feeling an impulse to follow this Sixth Manager into the gates of Hell! Even if they died here, they would have no regrets!

“If you dare say another word, I’ll rip off her head!” Yang Kai turned to Luo Qing Yun and shouted.

Luo Qing Yun’s Sword Intent surged as he watched Lu Xue suffer. How could he not want to save her? In fact, he had been looking for an opportunity to save her the entire time, but unfortunately, Yang Kai had spread his Divine Sense to the surroundings and was monitoring everyone’s actions. Luo Qing Yun was unable to find any gap to strike, so he could not do anything. At this moment, when he looked into Yang Kai’s cold eyes, he was shocked and realized that Yang Kai wasn’t joking and would really do what he said.

The anger in his heart was like a volcano that could erupt at any moment, but he didn’t dare to say anything, lest Yang Kai really rip Lu Xue’s head off.

“Hmph!” Yang Kai smiled disdainfully and shouted, “Guo Zi Yan!”

Guo Zi Yan’s expression became solemn, “Your humble subordinate is here!”

“Are you afraid of death?” Yang Kai turned to look at him.

Guo Zi Yan’s mouth twitched. He really wanted to say that he wasn’t afraid of death looking at Yang Kai’s display of prestige, but who wouldn’t be afraid of death? Saying such words would seem hypocritical, so he immediately smiled and said, “I’m afraid!” But he immediately added, “But your humble subordinate believes that if we die here today, Sir will definitely take revenge for us!”

He had no doubt about this. Yang Kai just confirmed this by avenging the lives of the thirty-three people.

Yang Kai nodded lightly, “Very good!”

Guo Zi Yan added in a heavy voice, “Sir, you don’t need to worry about us, you can act as you please. Even if we die here, we won’t hold you back. Fellow Brothers, don’t you all agree?”

“We will obey Sir’s orders!” The more than thirty people shouted in unison as their voice reverberated through the sky, their faces filled with determination.

The onlookers were moved and a look of admiration blanketed their faces. Whether these words were sincere or forced by the circumstances, Yang Kai being able to obtain such support from Guo Zi Yan and the others at this time showed his charisma.

Chen Tian Fei and the others, on the other hand, had complicated looks on their faces. They had commanded Scarlet Star for many years, and although they had many capable subordinates, they had never seen such a display of loyalty!

It hadn’t been that long since Guo Zi Yan was assigned to Yang Kai, just a month or two, but he had already been subdued to such an extent? They couldn’t believe that a Scarlet Star disciple could act like this.

Yang Kai’s face turned solemn as he swept his gaze over them, seemingly trying to memorize their faces. He noticed Guo Zi Yan’s calmness, fear of death and desire for life in some people’s eyes, and also many expectations from him.

He nodded his acknowledgement before claiming, “Don’t worry, if you die, I’ll bury these three thousand people with you!”

As soon as he said this, the entire crowd went into an uproar!

Yang Kai might have shown extraordinary combat strength. After all, a Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master like Lu Xue was not able to resist him. Likewise, the other Open Heaven Realm Masters might not be a match for Yang Kai in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary; however, what he said was still too arrogant.

There were three thousand people here, not three thousand rocks on the side of the road! Even if they stood there and let him kill them, it would still take him a long time to accomplish. Not to mention there were a number of Open Heaven Realm Masters still overseeing them. Furthermore, the Sword Pavilion disciples could even form their Starfall Sword Formation to boost their strength.

Even if Scarlet Star went all out, it would not be their opponent, let alone a lone person called Yang Kai!

Someone secretly shook his head., “Isn’t this Yang fellow too arrogant? Does he really think he’s invincible?”

Someone even sneered, “Who doesn’t know how to boast? If it was me, I would boast a lot better than him.”

“Ah, this Brat, I thought he was intelligent and talented, but who would have thought that he would be so stupid as to say such things?”

Even Yue He, who had been paying close attention to Yang Kai in the mansion, frowned. It wasn’t that she didn’t believe in Yang Kai’s strength as she had also witnessed Yang Kai defeat hundreds of Thunder Light disciples with the Scarlet Flood Dragon, but the three thousand people before her eyes were different. Thunder Light had brought its full strength out, and Sword Pavilion also had three hundred disciples here. Once they used their Sword Formation, they would be invincible.

If Yang Kai relied on his Space Secret Techniques to deal with them, he might be able to defeat them, but killing three thousand people was a bit unrealistic.

“Junior, your arrogance is quite big for your age!” Zhong Fan coldly snorted.

“Whether my arrogance is big or small, you’ll know soon enough.” Yang Kai looked at him disdainfully, “Old dog, I’ll give you two choices. The first is to release my men and I’ll trade this woman with you, and the second is to kill my men and I’ll have this woman accompany them to the underworld. Which one do you choose?”

Zhong Fan’s face turned dark and gloomy. Yang Kai’s intention was obviously to exchange hostages, but when he proposed the exchange, he spoke in a threatening manner, making everyone feel angry.

What made Zhong Fan even more helpless was that he couldn’t ignore Lu Xue’s life and death! To any force, a Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was a critical pillar that could not be lost!

“How do you expect this Old Master to believe you?” After pondering for a moment, Zhong Fan rolled his eyes at Yang Kai, “If this Old Master lets them go, what if you go back on your word?”

“Do you have a choice?” Yang Kai sneered.

Zhong Fan suggested, “This Old Master will release half of them first. Once you let her go, this Old Master will definitely release the other half!”

However, Yang Kai acted as if he didn’t hear her and raised Lu Xue high up in the air. A murderous look flashed on his face as he stated indifferently, “I’ll count to three. If I don’t see what I want, you can just wait to collect this woman’s corpse. One!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Junior, don’t push things too far!” Zhong Fan was furious. Yang Kai’s unyielding attitude was extremely infuriating. He had already taken a step back and agreed to let half of them go, but who would have thought that Yang Kai wouldn’t accept it at all. There were so many eyes here, so how could he take being so openly disdained?

“Two!” Yang Kai remained unmoved, his expression indifferent.

Luo Qing Yun nervously looked at Zhong Fan. The long sword in his hand was already tightly clenched. As long as Yang Kai shouted ‘three’, he would promptly attack him.

Zhong Fan’s aura also quickly rose to its peak as he stared fixedly at Yang Kai. He could tell that although Yang Kai had mentally prepared Guo Zi Yan and the others in advance and told them he would avenge them, he didn’t want to see Guo Zi Yan and the others die here; otherwise, he wouldn’t have wanted to exchange hostages.

At this critical moment, whoever buckled to the pressure first would suffer a crushing defeat!

As such, Zhong Fan’s face was filled with determination.

Yang Kai’s mouth opened slightly as a grin appeared on his face. The word ‘three’ had already formed in his mouth as a powerful energy fluctuation pulsated from his hand.

Zhong Fan immediately shouted, “Release them!”

His imposing aura instantly fell to the bottom!

In the end, he didn’t dare to take the risk. Yang Kai could ignore the life and death of Guo Zi Yan and the others, and at worst, he would just avenge them, but the Sword Pavilion couldn’t afford to lose Lu Xue.

Luo Qing Yun also let out a sigh of relief, his hand gripping his sword, sweating profusely.

After Zhong Fan’s command, Guo Zi Yan and the others who had been captured also broke free from their shackles and flew towards Yang Kai. When they got close, Guo Zi Yan cupped his fists with a face filled with gratitude and shame, “Sir!”
