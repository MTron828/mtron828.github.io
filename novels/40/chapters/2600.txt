At that instant, Fan Wu and the other Divine Venerables were drenched in cold sweat. Cang Gou was especially glad that he didn’t agree to Shi Huo’s request and join forces with him, for if he had, he would also have been humiliated and forced to his knees right now.

“He really knelt down…” The Monster Kings ten kilometres away widened their eyes as their jaws dropped. On the other hand, the Stone Spirits, who had been subdued by them, appeared excited and gleeful.

The Embodiment suddenly grinned and demanded, “Release us immediately if you don’t want to die; otherwise, all of you will suffer a horrible death!”

The Monster Kings and the Eight Great Kings were shocked upon hearing this threat, and after trading glances, they hurriedly backed away from the Stone Spirits as they didn’t dare to go hard on them anymore.

Even someone as powerful as Shi Huo was forced to kneel down in front of Zhang Ruo Xi, which was why these Monster Kings didn’t dare to be haughty anymore. They were extremely worried because they didn’t know what punishments awaited them.

After that, the Stone Spirit Clan and Embodiment cracked their limbs and got to their feet before they turned attentively to the sight that was ten kilometres away from them.

On the other side, Shi Huo, who was still on his knees, couldn’t believe what had just happened. The dark flames in his eyes flickered as he was on the brink of a breakdown.

He was a Divine Spirit as well as one of the Four Great Divine Venerables of the Ancient Lands, but now, he was forced to kneel down with a single command from a young girl. This kind of humiliation was intolerable for him.

He roared hysterically as he tried to get to his feet; however, a glowing red layer suddenly engulfed his entire body and suppressed all his strength, causing him to be unable to move a muscle.

*Zheng…*

Zhang Ruo Xi pointed her Heaven’s Order Sword at Shi Huo’s chest. Following her movement, the clouds in the sky seemed to have turned turbulent as the huge female illusory phantom behind her made a move.

The illusory phantom suddenly unsheathed her huge sword and pointed it in Shi Huo’s direction, her alluring face completely dispassionate.

“World Force!” Fan Wu paled as he looked up at the sky and felt a bitter taste in his mouth. If he still doubted how much of Heaven’s Order’s power Zhang Ruo Xi had inherited and to what extent he could resist just now, such ideas were completely snuffed out by this sight. The only thing he needed to consider now was how to survive under Zhang Ruo Xi’s wrath.

World Force fluctuated after the sword was unsheathed, which went to show that Heaven’s Order’s bloodline in Zhang Ruo Xi had completely awakened. Given enough time, she would become the new Heaven’s Order, the worst nightmare for all the Divine Spirits.

“W-What are you doing?” Shi Huo’s expression changed drastically as he exclaimed. Realizing just how massive the difference between their powers was, he couldn’t stay calm anymore. His flaming eyes appeared uneasy and fearful as he yelled, “I’m Divine Spirit Shi Huo, don’t you even think about killing me!”

“Divine Spirit Shi Huo, you are indeed a powerful being, but you are also cruel and revel in slaughter and death. As Heaven’s Order’s descendant, I’ll now take your Divine Spirit Source and seize your Divine Spirit Power. I hope all the Divine Spirits in this World will learn from this lesson,” Zhang Ruo Xi uttered impassively with an emotionless expression.

“What?” Shi Huo widened his eyes and spoke in a hoarse voice, “You want to seize my Divine Spirit Source?”

Without replying to him, Zhang Ruo Xi slowly pushed out her Heaven’s Order Sword. At the same time, the huge illusory phantom mirrored her actions and stabbed her gigantic sword into Shi Huo’s body.

Shi Huo’s figure was extremely sturdy, so even other Divine Spirits like Fan Wu and Luan Feng couldn’t harm him easily if they made a move against him. His body was even tougher than those of the Stone Spirit Clan.

Despite that, his figure now looked as frail as a piece of tofu when faced with the Heaven’s Order Sword. Zhang Ruo Xi didn’t seem to have exerted any real force with her thrust, but her sword easily pierced right into Shi Huo’s chest.

“No!” Shi Huo wailed as he stared at his own chest with widened eyes. Flustered, he yelled, “No! You can’t take away my Source! I’m Divine Spirit Shi Huo, I refuse to accept this!”

*Chi, Chi, Chi…*

The sound of Heaven’s Order Sword piercing Shi Huo echoed clearly, causing Fan Wu and the others to turn pale. By just listening to the sound, it was as though they could feel the same excruciating pain of that sword piercing their bodies.

Luan Feng trembled uncontrollably as her back was soaked in cold sweat.

“No, no! Madam, I know I was wrong. Please give me a chance to correct my ways! I’ll never do evil things again!” Seeing that he couldn’t stop his Source Strength from leaking out of his body, Shi Huo hurriedly begged for mercy.

He was a Divine Spirit with extreme pride in himself. If it weren’t because he was left with no choice, he wouldn’t have yielded. The sight made Fan Wu and the others feel distressed.

However, Zhang Ruo Xi was unfazed as she continued pushing her Heaven’s Order Sword into Shi Huo’s body until only the hilt was shown.

“It’s no use regretting now. You crossed a line you never should have,” a ferocious glint flashed across Zhang Ruo Xi’s gaze as she clenched the hilt.

*Hong…*

A booming sound was heard as Shi Huo’s chest and back exploded, forming a long hole through his body. Shi Huo shook violently as he lost all that was left of his imposing manner.

When Zhang Ruo Xi pulled back her Heaven’s Order Sword, something that looked like a heart was also drawn out. The heart was still beating vigorously, making thudding sounds, seemingly containing immense power.

“It’s Shi Huo’s Source.” Fan Wu turned completely pale as he staggered. A single glance was all it took to recognize that the thing in Zhang Ruo Xi’s hand was Shi Huo’s Source. Without it, Shi Huo would regress from a Divine Spirit to just an ordinary Monster Beast.

Luan Feng and Cang Gou were so shocked that they could hardly breathe as their chests felt incredibly heavy.

Through the memories they had inherited from their ancestors, they had already learned that Heaven’s Order was capable of seizing a Divine Spirit’s Source; however, those were just memories in the end, incomparable to witnessing such a feat with their own eyes.

Besides Heaven’s Order and her descendants, no one else in this world could easily take away a Divine Spirit’s Source.

Shi Huo’s life was basically over. Even if he managed to survive without his Source, he would become a cripple. At that moment, he could be seen kneeling on the ground in a dazed state, the hole in his chest looked hideous as the dark flames around his body had been completely extinguished. His aura appeared weak, as his cultivation had now probably dropped below the Twelfth-Order.

Then, Zhang Ruo Xi wielded her sword, which flashed in the sunlight, whereupon Shi Huo’s tremendous figure collapsed to the ground and broke into countless pieces of rock. With his vitality all gone, he no longer existed in this world.

After that, Zhang Ruo Xi shot a glance at Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Gou, causing their hearts to leap to their throats. With horrified expressions, they couldn’t help stepping backwards. Now, they were most afraid that Zhang Ruo Xi would make a move against them.

Judging from what happened to Shi Huo, if Zhang Ruo Xi wanted to kill them, they wouldn’t even stand a chance of escaping. The restrictive power coming from the Blood Gate was horrifying, and they were powerless to resist it. Perhaps the suppressive power only targeted Divine Spirits though as Yang Kai and the Third Disciple didn’t seem affected at all.

Fortunately, Zhang Ruo Xi only shot them a cold glance before she put the sword back into the sheath. All of a sudden, Heaven’s Order Sword and the huge illusory phantom behind her disappeared at the same time.

Fan Wu and the others heaved a sigh of relief. Although they didn’t know what Zhang Ruo Xi’s intention was, her actions suggested that they were safe for now.

Following that, Zhang Ruo Xi turned to look at Yang Kai. At this moment, Yang Kai appeared utterly battered. This was probably the biggest loss he had suffered in his life. His clothes were caked with dried blood, and his face was so swollen that he could barely open his eyes. Golden blood was still streaming down from his head, and the bones in both of his legs had been shattered. Unable to get to his feet, he could only sit on the ground, completely paralyzed.

When their gazes met, Yang Kai flashed a bitter smile at her. He wasn’t certain whether Zhang Ruo Xi’s transformation was a good or bad thing. In comparison, he preferred the soft-spoken and obedient Zhang Ruo Xi of the past. The Heaven’s Order’s descendant before his eyes now appeared unfeeling; moreover, her gaze and temperament were utterly foreign to Yang Kai.

After a moment of silence, Zhang Ruo Xi raised her hand again, upon which a beam of light shot out of the Blood Gate. Fan Wu and the others turned pale again and stared in that direction.

The last time Zhang Ruo Xi raised her hand, the Heaven’s Order Sword flew out of the Blood Gate. What would it be this time?

To their surprise, what Zhang Ruo Xi obtained wasn’t any weapon, but rather a delicious-looking scarlet spirit fruit that a rich aroma wafted from, involuntarily inducing hunger in all who smelt its scent.

Then, Zhang Ruo Xi flickered towards Yang Kai before she crouched down and passed the spirit fruit to him.

Without taking it, Yang Kai looked dazedly at her for a moment before asking, “Are you Ruo Xi?”

Zhang Ruo Xi nodded slightly as she replied gently, “Sir, it’s me. Eat this first. It can help you recover faster.”

“You…” Yang Kai appeared shocked. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Sir, I’m still Ruo Xi, and this fact will never change,” as she spoke, the coldness and indifference in her eyes melted and was replaced by the kind of warm light Yang Kai was familiar with.

“Hahaha!” Yang Kai started laughing as he could finally set his mind at ease. Only then did he take the spirit fruit from Zhang Ruo Xi and examine it, a moment later exclaiming in shock, “A ten-thousand-year-old Phoenix Blood Fruit!”

He didn’t expect that the spirit fruit Zhang Ruo Xi had summoned out of the Blood Gate was a ten-thousand-year-old Phoenix Blood Fruit. This was one of the rarest spirit fruits in the world because the blood of a Divine Spirit Phoenix was required to cultivate the tree it grew from. The Phoenix Clan was at the top of the hierarchy among all Divine Spirits, so hardly anyone in the world could challenge them, let alone kill them and take their blood.

It took all the Blood Essence of a Divine Spirit Phoenix to cultivate a Phoenix Blood Fruit Tree, after which it would then take ten thousand years for the tree to flower, then another ten thousand years for fruits to ripen from those flowers. In terms of the level of rarity, it was even more precious than the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus Yang Kai had come across in the Four Season Land.

Unexpectedly, now, a Phoenix Blood Fruit was right before his eyes, and it was Zhang Ruo Xi who nonchalantly summoned it out of the Blood Gate. Apparently, there must be a Phoenix Blood Fruit Tree behind the Blood Gate that was cultivated by Heaven’s Order after she killed a Phoenix Clan member and harvested their blood.
