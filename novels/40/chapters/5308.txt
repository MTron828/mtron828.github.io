The Phoenix Empress didn’t linger for long, and after inquiring as to how Yang Kai was able to access the Phoenix Nest, she turned and left.

The majority of the Phoenix Clan members were cold and aloof. Typically, they cultivated by themselves, without minding others’ business; there were very few members who enjoyed being nosey like Huang Si Niang. There wouldn’t be as many Phoenix Clan members coming out to investigate if they hadn’t noticed the odd occurrence in a Phoenix Nest.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai was panicking. With the Phoenix Clan Head’s presence, these Phoenix Clan members dared not cause any trouble; at most, they would just glare at him. However, if she left, Yang Kai guessed that he would be in for a lot of pain, judging by the posture of these Phoenixes around him.

He just couldn’t understand how he had offended them.

Usually, he could use his magnificent Space Secret Techniques against the Black Ink Clan, but in the face of the Phoenix Clan, that might not be useful.

So, before the Phoenix Clan Head stepped into her Phoenix Nest, Yang Kai shouted, “Senior, please wait a moment. I have something to ask about my Wife.”

The woman turned around in confusion, “What do you have to ask?”

Yang Kai rubbed his hands and replied awkwardly, “Uhm… there are too many people, so it’s not convenient for us to speak here. Could we find a private place to speak, Senior?”

The Phoenix Clan Head looked at him with a tiny smile on her face, aware of his intentions. Yet, she didn’t think he was timid or a coward as anybody would be afraid if they were glared at by so many Phoenixes with hostile intents.

It was already quite the smart move, being able to quickly think of a solution to save himself in a situation like this as a Seventh-Order Human.

Though the Phoenix Clan members wouldn’t kill him, beating him black and blue was a possibility.

Thus, she nodded lightly and said, “Follow me.”

Without having to perform any action, a portal appeared in the Void, followed by her entering it.

Yang Kai was overjoyed and he hurriedly followed her. As he made his way through the crowd around him, he couldn’t help but smile and say, “Excuse me. Excuse me.”

The Phoenixes didn’t stop him, as it was clear that the Clan Head was offering him shelter. If they made the situation difficult for him, it would be the same as not respecting the Clan Head. Consequently, they could only give way, even though they felt tremendous indignation.

Moments later, Yang Kai entered the portal as well.

Huang Si Niang, who watched from start to finish, sneered, “He’s quite the bold one.”

Yang Kai’s situation was somewhat related to her, so she initially wanted to invite him to her Phoenix Nest to hide from the Phoenix Clan members temporarily, but who knew this brat was bold enough to seek help from the Clan Head herself.

[He really doesn’t see himself as an outsider here.]

Meanwhile, Feng Liu Lang, who was standing next to Si Niang, frowned slightly, “He’s too sly. I don’t like him.”

The setting of Su Yan’s Phoenix Nest and the current Phoenix Clan Head’s Phoenix Nest were polar opposites. This place was scorchingly hot as dense Fire Principles filled the air.

Yang Kai instantly understood that the current generation leader of the Phoenixes was a Fire Phoenix!

He was still surveying the surroundings as he followed the Phoenix Clan Head into the Phoenix Nest when she asked, “Is there really something you wish to ask, or was that just an excuse?”

In a more serious manner, Yang Kai replied, “I actually do have something to ask.”

In the previous moment of crisis, he didn’t give it much thought because all he wanted to do was to use the status of the Phoenix Clan Head to escape, but now, he genuinely had a question.

She nodded lightly, “Go on.”

Yang Kai then stated, “Si Niang explained to me something about the Dragon Clan and my position there as a Human with a Dragon Source. This Junior would like to know what mindset the Phoenix Clan has in such circumstances. Does the Phoenix Clan also think that other Races do not deserve the Phoenix Clan Source, and should be marginalized if not eliminated?”

Upon hearing that, she did not answer his question but instead asked, “Do you know where both the Dragon and Phoenix Sources are from?”

Yang Kai thought for a while and answered, “Si Niang said that Phoenix Clan Sources are born from Phoenix Nests. There are as many Phoenix Clan members as there are Phoenix Nests. As for the Dragon Clan… do they come from the Dragon Pool?”

No one had told him about the origin of the Dragon Sources, but since the Dragon Pool was the root of the Dragon Clan, it was not surprising that Yang Kai thought of it this way.

The Phoenix Clan Head nodded, “Not bad. A Phoenix Source originates from a Phoenix Nest, whereas a Dragon Source comes from the Dragon Pool. This is one of the reasons our two Clans are hailed as leaders of all Divine Spirits. Both Dragons and Phoenixes are extremely strong and their numbers are quite large as well. Of course, this is in comparison to other Divine Spirits. Since you are a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Human, I believe you have also come into contact with other Divine Spirits, but have you met a Divine Spirit Clan that is as numerous and powerful as the Dragon Clan?”

Yang Kai shook his head.

Although the Divine Spirits he encountered couldn’t be counted as many, they were unquestionably not few as well.

For example, Zhu Jiu Yin and Shan Qing Luo were the only two members of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider Clan he knew of.

Then there was the Mie Meng Mother and her Son pair.

The Divine Spirits he saw in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary appeared mostly as individuals. There might be more of them, likewise, there were likely to be Clans that he hadn’t noticed.

Only the Kun Clan in the Divine Spirit Ancestral Land had a few more members, but there weren’t more than 10 of them.

In comparison, the Dragons and Phoenixes each had dozens of clansmen, which indeed made them far stronger and larger Clans.

Logically speaking, the more powerful a Race, the more problems they would face in terms of reproduction, but the situation was somewhat different for the Dragon and Phoenix Clans.

Due to their ability to produce the Dragon and Phoenix Sources, the Dragon Pool and Phoenix Nests were the foundation of these two Clans. With more Sources, naturally, there would be more clansmen, and as long as the Dragon Pool and the Phoenix Nests were not destroyed, both Clans would never go extinct.

In contrast, other Divine Spirits did not have such advantages. The continuation of their bloodline and reproduction solely depended on the bonding between clansmen. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The Dragon and Phoenix Clans could not only rely on the bonding of their clansmen, but also on the Dragon Pool and the Phoenix Nests. With these two Supreme Treasures, they would not end up like the diminishing of other Divine Spirits even if their Clans did not expand too much.

“The Dragon and Phoenix Clans have produced a large number of Clansmen over the ages, no less than tens of thousands of them. Among these Clansmen, it is not unusual to encounter accidents outside which result in death. If they pass away, their blood and Source will naturally be lost too. If the blood or Source is acquired, refined, and integrated by a member of another Race, it will lead to that individual having either a Dragon or Phoenix Clan Bloodline. Of course, far more blood is lost than Sources, so the former is much easier to come across than the latter”

Yang Kai nodded his head continuously in agreement, as he was one such example, so he resonated with her words deeply.

“In most cases, blood lost by the Dragon and Phoenix Clans will be obtained by you Humans due to your enormous population and widespread activity. So, other than the pure-blooded in this world, there are also other living beings that have some Dragon Clan Bloodline or Phoenix Clan Bloodline in them. Naturally, your descendants might carry a thin trace of the Dragon Clan Bloodline or Phoenix Clan Bloodline.”

“This is something that both the Dragon Clan and my Phoenix Clan are aware of. A Divine Spirit’s Bloodline Inheritance is incredibly mysterious. No matter how thin the Bloodline is, given enough time, there will come a day when it will be purified and awakened. One becomes more and more like a Dragon or Phoenix as that day approaches, regardless of whether you are originally Human or a member of any other Race.”

“However, Bloodline alone is insufficient if one wishes to become a True Dragon or Phoenix; a Source is also required.”

“In reality, the Source and Bloodline are complementary. Those who possess a Divine Spirit Source are definitely owners of a Divine Spirit Bloodline, but many may have a Divine Spirit Bloodline but not necessarily own a Source. Do you understand so far?”

Yang Kai nodded, “The Source is the root, and the Bloodline is the derivative of the Source. Just like the Flood Dragons, though they have a Dragon Clan Bloodline, they do not have Dragon Clan Sources.”

“Indeed. This is exactly how it works. However, if these Flood Dragons managed to purify their Bloodline to a certain extent, a Source can evolve from it. When that occurs, they can transform into a True Dragon and become an official member of the Dragon Clan.”

“So… does that mean if I could refine my Dragon Vein to a certain degree, I would officially be part of the Dragon Clan?” Yang Kai seemed to have some thoughts in his mind.

The Phoenix Clan Head looked at him briefly and said, “You can put it that way. This is the same for the Phoenix Clan as well.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but think of Qing Luan and others in the Divine Spirit Ancestral Land. According to the woman’s words, existences like Qing Luan and Yuan Chu all possessed strong Phoenix Clan Bloodlines, which would only require one last step before evolving into Sources. After taking that step, they would officially become pure-blooded Phoenix Clan members.

Of course, even if they didn’t take this step, they were still powerful Divine Spirits.

“It is just that… You know how the Dragon Clan is. There is an abundance of living beings in this World with Dragon Clan Bloodlines whereas there are very few who have a Phoenix Clan Bloodline.”

Yang Kai gave an awkward laugh. [It’s the nature of a Dragon to be lascivious!]

“It’s still acceptable if you solely possess a Dragon Clan Bloodline. The Dragon Clan wouldn’t care about that since there are many living beings that have a Dragon Clan Bloodline as a result of the Dragon Clan’s own actions. You, however, possess a Dragon Source, which means something to the Dragon Clan. If your Source is taken away and returned to the Dragon Pool, the Dragon Clan will undoubtedly have an additional heir in the future.”

Yang Kai frowned, “The Dragon Clan do such things?”

To which she shook her head and replied, “Not anymore. If it was a long time ago, they would certainly do so. While it is also conceivable for you to strengthen your Bloodline and eventually turn into a pure member of the Dragon Clan, that is merely a possibility. Instead of clinging to that faint hope, it was preferable for them to simply extract your Source and return it to the Dragon Pool.”

The Phoenix Clan Head was referring to an extremely ancient period when she said that it was a ‘long time ago’, but the Dragon Clan definitely did such things back then.

However, given Yang Kai’s current standing, it was clear that the Dragon Clan didn’t like him but wouldn’t do anything to him either.

“What about the Phoenix Clan?” This was the issue that Yang Kai was concerned about.

The Phoenix Clan Head knew what he was thinking, so she smiled and said, “Rest assured, the Phoenix Clan will not be as unscrupulously as the Dragon Clan. Since your Wife has the Phoenix Clan Source, that is her opportunity and it also means that she is a member of my Phoenix Clan. If she comes to cultivate in her Phoenix Nest in the future, she will certainly be able to fully awaken her Phoenix Clan Bloodline.”

Yang Kai heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing her words.

The Phoenix Clan was indeed far more friendly than the Dragon Clan.

“My Wife can come and cultivate in her Phoenix Nest?” Yang Kai asked again.

“Of course.” She nodded.

This was great news. Su Yan had already been cultivating in the Divine Spirit Ancestral Land for some time, which meant her strength must have been greatly increased. If she came to her Phoenix Nest to cultivate now, she might be able to purify her Bloodline and become a pure-blooded Phoenix Clan member.

After all, her Source was no ordinary Source, but the Source of a Phoenix Empress, even stronger than the woman in front of Yang Kai now.

He had to find a way to bring Su Yan and the others over here, but now that he was on Black Ink Battlefield, it was pretty challenging for him to do so.

It seemed like he had to ask for a favour from the Phoenix Clan.
