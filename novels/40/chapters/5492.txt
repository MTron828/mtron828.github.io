Chapter 5493: Success

Zhu Ge Xing Wei was restless, his mind was filled with many questions, but he did not dare to ask, which only fueled his anxiety.

Yang Kai suddenly asked, “How many Universe Worlds does this Territory have?”

Zhu Ge Xing Wei quickly replied, “Reporting to Senior, counting the Profound Abundant World, there are a total of 14.”

Yang Kai nodded in response, “Pick 13 people and send them to these 13 Universe Worlds. Give each of them one of these and tell them to wait for my message.”

Saying so, he sent out 13 Space Beacons with a wave of his hand.

Yang Kai knew that time was of the essence as the Black Ink Clan had launched a large-scale invasion. If he could save even a little bit of time travelling, perhaps he could save more people.

He had these Open Heaven Realm Masters of Profound Abundant Sect take the Space Beacons and head to the Universe World to wait for him because once he was done here, he could just arrive at the next location in a flash using Instantaneous Movement.

Zhu Ge Xing Wei took the Space Beacons, picked 13 of his subordinates, and handed them one each before sending them on their way.

While Yang Kai was busy refining, the Profound Abundant World was shaking violently, sending countless living beings into a panic; after all, this was the first time he had attempted to refine an entire Universe World into a World Bead, so his process was a bit jerky. Even though he was being extremely cautious, his efforts still brought some natural disasters to the Profound Abundant World.

Tsunamis, earthquakes, mountains collapsing, continents drifting apart, and many more were happening all across the Profound Abundant World.

Fortunately, Yang Kai had remained vigilant all the while. Once he spotted something wrong, he would immediately act to salvage the situation. This way, he didn’t cause too much of a disturbance in the Profound Abundant World, nor did he cause any casualties.

Be that as it may, fear and panic inevitably made its way into everyone’s heart.

Gradually, the huge Profound Abundant World became more and more distorted. Zhu Ge Xing Wei and the others who were standing nearby all felt as if the Profound Abundant World had entered a different time and space. It was clearly right in front of them, but it gave everyone an extremely illusory feeling.

Soon, Yang Kai had reached the critical point.

At this moment, he faintly felt that he was only a step away from refining the Profound Abundant World into a World Bead and achieving the goal he had originally envisioned; however, upon reaching this point, he found that he was unable to continue. The entire Profound Abundant World was showing resistance, which was preventing him from completing the refinement.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment before faintly understanding the cause of this.

This resistance was none other than this World’s Will!

Every Universe World had its own Will. The Star Boundary had one, and so did the Profound Abundant World. This was also the fundamental reason for the differences between Universe World, along with their Grand Daos and Martial Daos.

The stronger the World’s Principles, the higher its corresponding Grand Daos and Martial Dao would be.

1,000 years ago, the Star Boundary’s Grand Dao could be said to be very weak, so it could only give birth to Great Emperors while no known Open Heaven Realm Masters had ever appeared.

But after receiving the blessings of the World Tree clone, the Star Boundary’s World Principles were no longer inferior to any Universe World in this vast 3,000 Worlds.

On the other hand, the Profound Abundant World was able to give birth to Profound Abundant Sect, which had some 200 Open Heaven Realm Masters. Its Grand Dao could be said to be extraordinary.

This Universe World’s Principles were extremely profound, which also affected how strong its Will was. Ordinary people would not be able to sense this kind of Will. Only those who were shockingly talented could resonate with the World’s Will, obtaining its acknowledgement and becoming Great Emperors, were even fully aware of it.

Now, when Yang Kai was refining the Profound Abundant World, the World’s Will instinctively resisted; after all, Yang Kai was an outsider, so how could the Profound Abundant World accept being refined by him?

Yang Kai could forcefully refine it, but if he did so, the World’s Will and Principles would inevitably be damaged. Yang Kai was unaware of what would be the consequences of such actions, but he was certain that it would not be good for the Profound Abundant World.

Perhaps, the cultivation of the cultivators in the Profound Abundant World would become more difficult, and the chances of giving birth to new Masters would also be lower.

This did not line up with his original intentions.

Frowning, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense surged as he transmitted the images of what he had seen on the Black Ink Battlefield, about what happened to the Universe Worlds occupied by the Black Ink Nest.

The World’s Will could not be considered fully sentient, but it was an extremely special existence nonetheless.

Yang Kai had no idea if this would have any effect, but if he wanted to smoothly refine the Profound Abundant World, he could only make the World’s Will cooperate with him and stop resisting his refinement.

As the saying went, the World Lives. Yang Kai was hoping for the World’s Will to understand his intent and cooperate.

Yang Kai’s original intention was to let Profound Abundant World’s Will understand what would happen if it was occupied by the Black Ink Clan. It was destined to become the same as the Universe Worlds on the Black Ink Battlefield, where the World Force would be devoured and turned into a dead Universe World.

Much to Yang Kai’s surprise, it actually worked.

After showing the scenes he had seen on the Black Ink Battlefield, the resistance of the Profound Abundant World’s Will became much weaker.

Yang Kai was overjoyed by this discovery. Striking while the iron was hot, he continued to transmit what he had seen to the World’s Will using his Divine Sense.

The World’s Will’s resistance became weaker until it was almost non-existent.

At this moment, a heavy sigh suddenly rang in Yang Kai’s mind, like the tolling of a loud bell. Yang Kai’s mind instantly went blank as he faintly felt as if he had become one with the Profound Abundant World, and there was no disjunction between the two.

Another inexplicable feeling surged in Yang Kai’s heart, before his consciousness crossed a vast distance and arrived at an unknown place in a flash.

There was nothing but endless darkness around him and for some reason, he could not lift a finger. He was even unable to sense his own existence.

Yang Kai was beside himself, not understanding how he had encountered such a strange phenomenon when he was only refining the Profound Abundant World.

He calmed himself down though and didn’t panic.

He couldn’t feel the passage of time at all. After an unknown amount of time, a tiny bit of light appeared in the endless darkness. When the Primal Chaos first parted, and Heaven and Earth were created, a fearsome power capable of destroying the entire universe erupted from this point. This kind of power was something even the Black Ink Giant Spiritual God, or even Mo itself, could not compare with.

This was the power of the entire universe.

Suddenly, the constraints binding the light instantly disappeared as everything expanded endlessly, transforming into one Great Territory after another. These Great Territories then gave birth to primitive Universe Worlds.

The Profound Abundant World was one of them!

After an unknown period, the Profound Abundant World gradually gathered the Five Elements, Yin and Yang, and was acknowledged by the Heavenly Way. It slowly perfected its World Principles, transforming into a true Universe World. Slowly but surely, the deathly still World started to gain vitality. This vitality rapidly spread, gradually transforming, filling it with life!

Yang Kai understood that this was the process of the Profound Abundant World’s formation. He seemed to be personally experiencing it after merging with its Will.

In fact, he had experienced this feeling once before, when he was acknowledged by the Star Boundary’s Will and became a Great Emperor.

However, the current experience was different from the last. This time, the feeling was clearer, and the history of this place was even more ancient!

Yang Kai suddenly realized something and made a bold guess.

It was just that he was temporarily unable to investigate these insights as his cultivation was too low and he did not have the time.

He had no way of verifying this conjecture either!

Yang Kai didn’t know how long he had experienced these events for, but to Zhu Ge Xing Wei and the others, it had only been half a day.

In just half a day, Yang Kai’s entire body became distorted and illusory like the Profound Abundant World, as if he didn’t exist.

Zhu Ge Xing Wei and the others also had no idea what had happened to Yang Kai. As there was a massive gap in their strength, and in the way they cultivated, they didn’t dare to disturb him.

Only after some time did Yang Kai’s figure suddenly materialize, allowing them to once again perceive his existence.

The Profound Abundant World, on the other hand, was still the same, the void around it distorting as if it was not in the same space as them.

Suddenly, Yang Kai broke into a long laughter and stood up, “Success!”

Saying so, he stretched out his hand and grabbed towards the Profound Abundant World.

What Zhu Ge Xing Wei and the others saw next was quite difficult for them to accept. Yang Kai’s hand pierced through the Void, seemingly passing through the surface of water, gently scooping something out of it. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When Yang Kai withdrew his hand, the warped space suddenly collapsed and the Profound Abundant World disappeared!

Zhu Ge Xing Wei was beside himself in shock and could not help but cry out, “Where is the Profound Abundant World?”

The 200 or so Open Heaven Realm Masters were also alarmed and bewildered. The Profound Abundant World that had raised them had actually disappeared right before their eyes.

How could they accept this? They still had friends and families in the Profound Abundant World!

“Don’t panic!” Yang Kai smiled and stretched out his hand towards everyone, “Take a look at this.”

Zhu Ge Xing Wei and the others shot a glance over and saw a round bead in Yang Kai’s palm. The surface of this bead was gray, but deep blue inside, as if a sapphire was embedded inside it.

The sapphire embedded inside was extremely familiar, whether it was its shape or colour distribution. It was the same as the Profound Abundant World, the only difference was its size.

After all, the Profound Abundant World was a Universe World, extremely vast, whereas the object in Yang Kai’s hand was only the size of a large marble.

Zhu Ge Xing Wei focused his gaze, trying to see through the fog on its surface. Immediately, he saw the true appearance of the sapphire embedded in the bead.

It was the Profound Abundant World!

He even saw Profound Abundant Sect, its tens of thousands of disciples inside as tiny as dust particles, completely crowding the main square. Many of them were looking around with blank expressions on their faces.

He even saw his Cave Mansion, and also his Wife and concubines, who were hurriedly packing up and preparing to escape after receiving his orders.

He then shifted his gaze and saw the scene of peddlers shouting and hawking in a city close to the Profound Abundant Sect while people went about their daily lives…

Zhu Ge Xing Wei was completely astounded and couldn’t believe his eyes.

[The Profound Abundant World has been refined into a bead?]

[How can anyone do this? Is it even possible!?]

If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, he never would have believed this feat even in his dreams.

Soon, his face beamed with excitement. Previously, the Elders of Profound Abundant Sect were arguing about who to bring away and who to abandon, but now that the entire Profound Abundant World had been refined into a bead, there was nothing to worry about!

Not to mention, the tens of thousands of Profound Abundant Sect disciples, even the billions of lives on the Profound Abundant World could be brought with them!

It was only now that he understood Yang Kai’s painstaking efforts and what he had been refining.

[This Senior’s means are truly astonishing!]
