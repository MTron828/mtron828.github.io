Above Dragon Island, rain was pouring down from the sky despite the lovely weather. The entire Dragon Island seemed to have fallen into silence as everyone was looking in a particular direction.

Fu Ling gulped and uttered with difficulty, “When a Dragon Clan member passes away, they will turn into spirit rain. This is the Fallen Dragon Rain!”

“Are you sure?” Yang Kai looked solemnly at Fu Ling.

Fu Ling replied, “Absolutely.”

Zhu Qing nodded in agreement, “Indeed, a Dragon Clan member has passed away.”

Yang Kai’s forehead was beaded with cold sweat, “No way! Who did it? Senior Jiu Feng? Or Li Wu Yi? Or Zhu Lie, that brat?”

He was shocked after Zhu Qing concluded that a Dragon Clan member had fallen.

Although he had fallen out with the Dragon Clan and even harmed some of them, the idea of killing any one of them had never crossed his mind. It didn’t matter for him to fall out with the Dragon Clan, as they could just not meet each other for the rest of their lives. He had always loathed the Dragon Clan’s haughty behaviour, so he would rather not have any contact with them at all.

However, if a Dragon died because of him, that would be a different story. When that happened, not only would Zhu Qing be put in a tight spot, but a blood feud would also be formed between Yang Kai and the Dragon Clan.

Given the Dragon Clan’s power, he was still no match for them. If they went all out to hunt him down, there would be no place in the world where he could hide.

Although Yang Kai had flared up and harmed some of the Dragon Clan’s members, he had not killed any one of them. Even those who were harmed by him didn’t suffer damage to their foundations. After breaking their Blessing Technique, Yang Kai simply stopped attacking them.

If he wanted to leave with Zhu Qing, he had to showcase his power and capabilities; however, he also had to make sure that he didn’t cross the line in whatever he did. While Yang Kai wanted to get the fury off his chest, he had to ensure that his actions would still be tolerated by the Dragon Clan in the end.

However, now, that line had been crossed because a Dragon Clan member had been killed. [Who was the one reckless enough to kill a member of the Dragon Clan on Dragon Island? Are they sick of living?]

Yang Kai’s expression turned serious in an instant as he was trying to figure out in his mind who the Dragonslayer was. [It’s impossible for Zhu Lie to do it. He is from the Dragon Clan as well, so he wouldn’t have the heart to kill his fellow clansman. Furthermore, he probably doesn’t have the power to do that. Jiu Feng probably couldn’t do that either.]

Yang Kai remembered that she was going up against two opponents at the same time, so it would be good enough if she could defend herself. There was no way she could have killed a Dragon Clan member.

[What about Li Wu Yi? The Fourth Elder is a Ninth-Order Dragon after all, so it’s not possible that he could be killed so easily. Could it be Liu Yan?] Yang Kai’s chest tightened when he thought of this possibility. If it was really Liu Yan who had done it, things would go really bad on this day.

Just when Yang Kai was deep in his thoughts, Zhu Lie and the others had calmed down as well. All of them stopped fighting with one another and returned to their own sides as a myriad of expressions came over them.

Jiu Feng caught some spirit rain with her hand as her expression suggested that she was taking pleasure in their misfortune, “Who is it that has passed away?”

Apparently, she knew a thing or two about Fallen Dragon Rain. As she shot a glance at the two Dragons who were battling against her just now, she mocked them by saying, “Could it be Zhu Yan or Fu Zhun?”

Despite what she had just said, she knew that it wasn’t possible. The Great Elder Zhu Yan and the Second Elder Fu Zhun were as powerful as Great Emperors, so even the Martial Beast Great Emperor would be unable to kill them. But then who was it that actually killed a Dragon?

Just like Yang Kai, she was astonished deep down in her heart. She went through all the possible culprits in her mind, but she negated all her speculations in the end.

While they had all calmed down, it was the same case in another battlefield. Four people were standing in silence in front of the Dragon Grave.

One of them was a burly man with thick arms and round waist who was clad in a dark red cloak. He appeared authoritative despite his calm expression. The aura wafting from his body was powerful enough to shake the Heavens and Earth and cause space to contort.

There was an extremely weak woman in his embrace. Her face was completely pale as she snuggled up to the man’s chest. Every breath she let out carried with it a pleasant fragrance, and her long eyelashes fluttered lightly. She appeared serene, as though it wouldn’t matter even if it was the end of the world, as long as she could remain in this man’s embrace. Upon closer look, it could be seen that beneath her serene facade, a sense of guilt was hidden.

On the other hand, Zhu Yan and Fu Zhun were standing not far away on both sides of the couple, still keeping a battle stance. The Great Elder was covered in a layer of green light, while the Second Elder was surrounded by her Ice Principles. Both of them were extremely wary of the man before their eyes.

The man had a masculine face with a thick brow and a bright pair of eyes. As he panted slightly, it was apparent that he had expended a great deal of his energy. Upon seeing the spirit rain though, he grinned suddenly and called out, “You two, I don’t think I need to remind you what Fallen Dragon Rain means. If you two keep fighting with me, I’m afraid all the members of your Dragon Clan will lose their lives one by one. When that happens, you two will be eternal sinners of the Dragon Clan. I don’t think you want to be held responsible for that, do you?”

The Great Elder and the Second Elder remained unperturbed. They had reached a cultivation realm where they could hardly be distracted by other things. Although it was an important matter that a Dragon had passed away, they dared not lower their guard.

It couldn’t be helped, as this man before their eyes was one of the Ten Great Emperors, Martial Beast Great Emperor, Mo Huang. He was just as powerful as the two Elders, hence, if the Elders were distracted or careless for even a moment, they might let the man before their eyes gain an advantage over them.

It was a significant matter that a member of the Dragon Clan had lost their life, but the issue of Mo Huang barging into the Dragon Grave and trying to leave with this exiled Dragon woman was equally important.

*Tsk…*

Seeing that the two Elders remained unfazed, Mo Huang couldn’t help but spit disdainfully. Frustrated, he uttered, “Just tell me straight away how you want to settle this matter today. I’ll consider it.”

The Second Elder replied dispassionately, “Release Fu Xuan and never come to Dragon Island again. I’ll let all of you from Spirit Beast Island leave safely.”

Mo Huang snorted, “Xuan’er and I are husband and wife who are deeply in love with one another. Why do you make it sound like I’m abducting her? All of you are stone-hearted people who follow your so-called rules blindly. You even threw Xuan’er into the Dragon Grave; however, I won’t try to settle the score with you about this. Let me leave with Xuan’er, and I won’t stop you from going over to settle the problems on Dragon Island.”

Fu Zhun shook her head, “Fu Xuan is the Dragon Clan’s Fourth Elder. She was born on Dragon Island, and she’ll die in the Dragon Grave. You can’t take her away!”

Mo Huang sneered, “I am going to take her away. You can try to stop me.”

Fu Zhun coldly replied, “We’ll have to settle it quickly, then.” As she spoke, the aura around her suddenly turned dangerous.

Ignoring her, Mo Huang turned to look at Zhu Yan, “Great Elder, what do you think? If you want to make a move on me, I don’t mind continuing the fight with you two. However, I’m worried that today will be the end of the Dragon Clan. All of you may have to go extinct!”

With a solemn expression, Zhu Yan sighed in silence. This was such an eventful day for the Dragon Clan. The series of changes happening on Dragon Island on this day was baffling. Although he had lived for many years, he had never seen anything like it before.

First, Yang Kai, who possessed the Ancestral Dragon Source, arrived at the wedding to snatch the bride. After that, the Martial Beast Great Emperor and the others from Spirit Beast Island broke into Dragon Island, and the latter even brought Fu Xuan out of the Dragon Grave. Then, before any of these matters could even be settled, a Dragon Clan member had been killed. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Although the Great Elder’s cultivation was incredibly powerful, he still found the issues on this day thorny. It was as though all the problems he hadn’t encountered in the past 10,000 years suddenly happened at the same time, so he was extremely exhausted.

They could never ignore the fact that a Dragon Clan member had been killed. The number of Dragon Clan members had always been small, and a death had not happened for many years. Most importantly, Zhu Yan wasn’t sure if the murderer still had the capability to kill other Dragon Clan members.

If the Dragonslayer still had the energy to slaughter other Dragons, he had to immediately go over to deal with that person. Otherwise, the consequences would be dreadful. Nevertheless, they couldn’t leave the matter at hand unattended either, so it was hard for him to make a decision.

“Great Elder, are you set on making things difficult for me as well?” Mo Huang questioned sternly, apparently losing his patience.

Zhu Yan raised his gaze and uttered, “Mo Huang, I have a proposal.”

“Go on.” Mo Huang arched his brow.

“We’ll put down the grudges with you for now.”

Fu Zhun frowned upon hearing that, but she didn’t rush to say anything.

Mo Huang laughed heartily, “That’s a great decision you’ve made.”

Zhu Yan continued, “However, you have to come with us.”

Mo Huang stopped laughing and stared seriously at Zhu Yan, as though he was trying to figure out if the Great Elder was pulling his leg. A moment later, he sneered, “Great Elder, are you out of your mind? A crisis has befallen Dragon Island, so naturally, I have to seize this chance and leave. After you two settle the problem, I won’t be able to leave anymore. Please don’t insult my intelligence.”

Zhu Yan shook his head, “If you don’t agree with it, then I have no choice but to join forces with the Second Elder and capture you first.”

Mo Huang uttered, “I’m amazed by your confidence.”

After a sigh, Zhu Yan replied, “If you were alone, both the Second Elder and I wouldn’t be able to stop you if you wanted to leave; however, you’re bringing Fu Xuan with you now, so there’s no way you can utilize your full strength. You don’t want her to get hurt, right?”

Mo Huang’s expression darkened when he heard that. Nevertheless, when he lowered his head to look at the woman in his embrace, his expression immediately turned gentler.

Zhu Yan went on to say, “In return, I’ll give you a chance. If you agree to my proposal, I’ll communicate with the Dragon Temple one day and beg for the ancestors’ mercy on Fu Xuan’s behalf. We’ll see if she’ll be granted a chance to leave the Dragon Grave.”

Mo Huang’s gaze brightened when he heard that, “Are you serious?”

Zhu Yan said, “I can only give it a try, it will all depend on the ancestors’ attitude.”

Mo Huang nodded, “I believe you.”

“It’s a deal, then?” Zhu Yan looked inquisitively at him.

Mo Huang turned to look at Fu Zhun, “That’ll depend on the Second Elder’s stance on it.”

Without uttering a word, Fu Zhun suddenly turned into a beam of white light and headed in a particular direction, her actions speaking for themselves. She didn’t agree to it, nor did she object to it explicitly. Obviously, it was a tacit approval; after all, it was the Great Elder’s proposal, so she couldn’t take a different position even if she didn’t agree to it in her heart. Moreover, this suggestion was the best solution to their current predicament.

Seeing that, Zhu Yan nodded at Mo Huang and turned into a beam of light before heading in that direction as well. The two Dragon Clan Elders left just like this, because they knew that since Mo Huang had agreed to it, he would not go back on his word. After all, he was the Martial Beast Great Emperor.

Moreover, it wouldn’t matter even if he really went back on his word. Even if he could sneak out of Dragon Island with Fu Xuan on this day, it wasn’t like his Spirit Beast Island could be moved to a different location. If he really broke his promise, all the Dragon Clan members would visit Spirit Beast Island sometime in the future. That was why the two Elders were not worried when they flew off.
