Chapter 2199, Emperor Authority Bead

Hearing this call, Xia Sheng smiled and said, “We... don’t need it.”

Yang Kai was shocked and asked curiously, “What do you mean?”

Xia Sheng said, “Brother Yang, you want to trade for that spirit fruit, right?”

What he was referring to was, naturally, the Tribulation Fruit. Yang Kai had entered the Four Seasons Realm to find the Tribulation Fruit was no secret in Azure Sun Temple, because before leaving, Gao Xue Ting had told everyone that if any of them found the Tribulation Fruit, they should collect it to exchange with Yang Kai.

With Gao Xue Ting’s reminder, plus Yang Kai’s emphasis on letting everyone take out their harvest from the Four Seasons Realm before the transaction, Xia Sheng naturally knew what he was looking for.

Unfortunately, judging from the current situation, Yang Kai had not managed to achieve his goal.

“Yeah!” Yang Kai did not deny and nodded lightly.

“None of us have it, so we won’t join in the fun,” Xia Sheng smiled, “Besides, if we really offered to exchange it with you, it would likely be impossible for you to refuse no matter what else we offered, which would leave a bad taste... It’s fine, Brother Yang, you should ask Wu Chang if he has it.”

Apart from Xia Sheng and the others from Azure Sun Temple, only Wu Chang remained here.

Hearing this, Wu Chang also took the initiative to stand up and ask Yang Kai, “What spirit fruit do you want?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Kai groaned slightly but decided to tell the truth, “The Tribulation Fruit!”

Wu Chang frowned and said, “Never seen it.”

“Even you don’t have it...” Yang Kai couldn’t help showing a disappointed look. He didn’t know when the Tribulation Fruit from the Realm of Winter was picked, who had it, or where it was, so it looked like his primary objective for coming to the Four Seasons Realm could no longer be achieved.

Yang Kai suddenly had a deep feeling of regret.

“Although I don’t have what you want, I still want to make a deal with you!” Wu Chang quickly said, “You can’t take that Extraordinary Treasure Pill out, can you?”

“Naturally not!” Yang Kai composed himself and said, “Brother Wu Chang wanting to make a trade is fine, but... I wonder what you’re willing to take out?”

“This!” Wu Chang took out a jade bottle and threw it towards Yang Kai.

He didn’t seem worried at all that Yang Kai would try to steal this treasure and run away, trusting him to the point where he directly handed over what he wanted to trade.

Yang Kai was startled when he saw this and quickly dispersed the Space Principles which had been lingering about him. Catching the jade bottle in his hand, Yang Kai glanced suspiciously at Wu Chang.

“If you open it and take a look, you’ll know what it is!” Wu Chang said lightly.

Yang Kai opened the bottle and peered inside, his face changing slightly in the next instant as he commented, “Brother Wu Chang is quite bold!”

Wu Chang sneered, “I will break through to the Emperor Realm soon, so this thing is not necessary to me, but you... you’re only a First-Order Dao Source Realm now and won’t reach the Emperor Realm any time soon. This thing will be of great use to you, possibly even saving your life at a critical moment.”

“It is as Brother Wu Chang says,” Yang Kai had already capped the jade bottle as he spoke.

Xia Sheng and the others looked confused, wondering what Wu Chang had handed over to Yang Kai to move him so greatly.

Murong Xiao Xiao, however, suddenly seemed to be thinking of something and muttered, “Could it be that...”

“What?” Xia Sheng, who was always curious, asked Murong Xiao Xiao in a low voice.

Xiao Bai Yi also showed a look of interest as he perked up his ears.

Murong Xiao Xiao whispered, “An Emperor Authority Bead!”

*Si...*

Xia Sheng drew a sharp breath, “That bastard Wu Chang had such a thing?” As he spoke, a look of fear flashed across his face as cold sweat dripped down on his forehead, “If that guy had summoned his Emperor Authority Bead at that time, wouldn’t I be dead...”

A Third-Order Emperor’s full-powered strike was sealed in an Emperor Authority Bead, so although Xia Sheng was a genius in his own right, he had no confidence he could survive such a blow. Death or serious injury were the only possible outcomes, with the former being much more likely.

After thinking about this though, Xia Sheng’s brow furrowed as he said with a puzzled look, “Wait, Xiao Xiao, how do you know that Wu Chang had an Emperor Authority Bead in his hands?”

Before Murong Xiao Xiao spoke, Xiao Bai Yi inferred, “Because when Wu Chang obtained that Emperor Authority Bead, Xiao Xiao was there!”

Xia Sheng heard this and his face slightly changed, calling out in a low voice, “Could it be that... this Emperor Authority Bead was obtained by Wu Chang in the Four Seasons Realm?”

“Yeah,” Murong Xiao Xiao nodded, “He got it from a trade with Luo Yuan. Didn’t I tell you before that I entered the Flowing Time Temple with Senior Brother Xiao? It was there, in the final room. That’s where Luo Yuan obtained the Emperor Authority Bead...”

“Were there any other treasures there?” Xia Sheng asked with interest, “What did you obtain?”

“I got a drop of Supreme Divine Water...” Murong Xiao Xiao smiled, “Even that was thanks to Junior Brother Yang, if it weren’t for him, I wouldn’t have been able to obtain anything. As for the others... Princess Lan Xun took one away, a Pseudo Emperor Artifact, while Gong Wen Shan obtained an Emperor Aura!”

“The Heavens must be jealous!” Xia Sheng looked up to the sky in grief and indignation, “Why didn’t I meet such an opportunity!”

Xiao Bai Yi squinted at him and said, “Hmph, you were the one who insisted on exploring the Realm of Spring saying it was sunny and beautiful there!”

“Seems like I made a mistake,” Xia Sheng bowed his head, looking downcast, but immediately he recovered and asked, “Wait, you said Yang Kai helped you obtain that drop of Supreme Divine Water, then what about him... did he also get something?”

“Junior Brother Yang, he... he obtained some kind of red bead.” Murong Xiao Xiao replied, “But I don’t know what the bead is for, even Princess Lan Xun couldn’t tell what it was.”

“A red bead!” Xia Sheng frowned after hearing this.

As the few of them were talking, Wu Chang was impatiently urging, “Are you satisfied with this thing?”

Yang Kai held the jade bottle containing the Emperor Authority Bead and grinned, “Admittedly, this thing is truly precious, a life-saving treasure. It is quite tempting!”

This was an Emperor Authority Bead. Although Yang Kai’s strength was decent, and he was proficient in the Dao of Space, his cultivation was still low. In the Star Boundary, where Masters floated about like clouds and danger lay around every corner, there would likely be many situations where his ability was lacking. At such times, an Emperor Authority Bead would offer a layer of safety, so how could Yang Kai not be interested?

This thing was probably one of the most valuable items in the entire Four Seasons Realm. Even the Emperor Aura that Gong Wen Shan obtained was not comparable. An Emperor Aura could be used to refine an Emperor Artifact, but Yang Kai already had several Emperor Artifacts in his hand, so an Emperor Aura had almost no attraction to him.

“You want something more?” Wu Chang frowned as he read the meaning behind Yang Kai’s words, “Let’s hear it, if it’s not too much, I can accept it.”

“Brother Wu Chang, it is refreshing to speak with you!” Yang Kai laughed out loud. People like Wu Chang and Luo Yuan, regardless of their hot tempers, were actually the easiest to cooperate with, because they did not try to hide their intentions or motivations at all. If they thought something, they would speak it boldly rather than trying to deceive you.

Yang Kai followed up, “This thing is indeed precious, but Brother Wu Chang should also know that it is a consumable item, once it is used, it is gone forever...”

“Enough, I know its advantages and disadvantages, just tell me what you want!” Wu Chang interrupted Yang Kai before he finished speaking, directly telling him to name a price.

Yang Kai hesitantly touched his nose...

“Brother Yang, if you don’t mind, this Xia has a suggestion!” Xia Sheng suddenly interjected.

“What do you want?” Wu Chang looked at him irritably.

Xia Sheng said innocently, “I just want to make a suggestion to Brother Yang. It’s up to him if he wants to listen or not, what’s wrong with that?”

Yang Kai smiled lightly and said, “If Brother Xia has a suggestion, please feel free to speak it.”

“En,” Xia Sheng nodded before he turned to Wu Chang and said meaningfully, “Brother Wu Chang seems to have obtained a lot of Star Seals in the Four Seasons Realm this time, so perhaps Brother Yang can...”

Hearing this, Yang Kai raised his brow, immediately understanding what Xia Sheng wanted to say.

Wu Chang frowned.

Xia Sheng continued, “Before coming here, Elder Gao once said that all the disciples who obtained extra Star Seals could receive rewards from the Sect after turning them over, and the more one turns over, the greater the reward! Brother Yang is not a disciple of my temple, but this deal also applies to you. If you can obtain more Star Seals, you can make a bigger request from the temple, like for instance, asking the Sect Master and Elders to help you find that Tribulation Fruit!”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he felt this was a good idea!

He had been unable to complete the task he came to the Four Seasons Realm to achieve, which made him quite embarrassed about returning to Maplewood City to deal with Qin Zhao Yang. If he could ask the leaders of Azure Sun Temple to help him though, obtaining the Tribulation Fruit may still be possible.

In short, Yang Kai was quite interested in this proposal.

“Hmph!” Wu Chang snorted coldly, “What is this? You want to use this method to reduce the quotas my Orthodoxy Temple has to enter the Shattered Star Sea? Does Brother Xia have so little confidence in his own Sect?”

“Not at all!” Xia Sheng smiled and said, “I’m just thinking about what’s best for Brother Yang, nothing like what you said!”

“I don’t care either way! Whether others from Orthodoxy Temple can enter the Shattered Star Sea or not is none of my concern, as long as I can enter myself!”

“Oh?” Xia Sheng raised his brows and said, “Brother Wu Chang means that as long as you have a single Star Seal, you can discard the rest?”

“That depends on his intentions!” Wu Chang turned his gaze to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai replied, “Let me ask first, Brother Wu Chang, how many Star Seals do you have?”

“Five!”

“Quite a lot!” Yang Kai exclaimed before nodding, “Good, since Brother Wu Chang is so sincere, then this Yang is willing to make this deal with you, but I still have one question.”

“Ask!” Wu Chang said concisely.

“How are you going to give me those Star Seals?”

“I can transfer them to you with a certain Secret Technique!” Wu Chang answered naturally.

Yang Kai’s face went black when he heard this and asked, “Then when I saw you outside the Flowing Time Temple earlier, why did you insist on cutting off my arm?”

“Do you know the necessary Secret Technique?” Wu Chang asked disdainfully.

“I don’t,” Yang Kai answered honestly.

“Then cutting off your arm is the only way!” Wu Chang coldly snorted.

“Makes sense!” Yang Kai said lightly.

“Enough nonsense, let’s complete the transaction first!”

Saying so, Wu Chang’s figure flickered and he rushed over to Yang Kai directly, his hands forming a set of seals as he pushed his Source Qi.

Silavin: Okay. In the raws, the author wrote that it was Wu Chang that obtained the bead from the temple. Which we know is false. So, I changed it so that he traded it from Luo Yuan first.
