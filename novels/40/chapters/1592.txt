Chapter 1592, Interesting Thing

Originally, Yang Kai was not very interested in this Blood Prison Trial; after all, this place was almost exclusively for Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators to temper themselves and seek opportunities.

Yang Kai was only at the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm, and even though he could fight opponents above his realm and wasn’t afraid of anyone below the Origin King Realm, his lack of cultivation was a fact. Yang Kai thought he wouldn’t be able to gain much from the Blood Prison so he hadn’t hesitated to leave Qian Tong and the others on Green Mountains Star while he went to Tong Xuan Realm to find his relatives and friends.

However, since Shan Qing Luo told him about the Domain Stones that formed inside the Blood Prison, he became interested.

Now that he was here, Yang Kai fully understood that even without any Domain Stones, he could gain unimaginable benefits simply by relying on the Domain Vortices which filled the Blood Prison.

As long as one’s ability was sufficient, any Origin Returning Realm cultivator could further condense their Shi with assistance from these Domain Vortices, pushing them closer to the grand accomplishment stage! This had nothing to do with one’s cultivation.

Having said that, there were probably very few that could really do this. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Thankfully, Yang Kai was one such individual.

Meanwhile, a hundred kilometres outside the Blood Prison, atop a high mountain, there was an elegant stone pavilion.

At this moment, seven cultivators sat inside this stone pavilion, some who looked old, some who looked young, some who were male, while others were female, but without exception, all these cultivators were Origin Kings.

Anyone who saw such a terrifying lineup would be shocked.

This was definitely a tyrannical gathering.

These masters sat in various positions inside the stone pavilion, some with their eyes closed in meditation while others discussed the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao or even just casually observed their surroundings.

These top masters had come from various Cultivation Stars from across the entire Star Field!

Naturally, these masters hadn’t rushed here for the Blood Prison Trial to seek entertainment, but rather to recruit top talents.

All of them were waiting for the day when the cultivators that entered the Blood Prison emerged.

Entering the Blood Prison and being able to leave safely meant that a cultivator had great potential. Even if they couldn’t ultimately break through to the Origin King Realm in the future, they would still no doubt become a top master in the Origin Returning Realm.

Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce naturally welcomed such experts, as did Purple Star, Sword Union, etc.

It could be said that these seven Origin King Realm masters represented the several great forces that reigned supreme over the Star Field.

Every time the Blood Prison Trial opened, representatives would come to Green Mountains Star to seek talents for their great force to cultivate.

Of course, some also came here for the Domain Stones exclusively produced inside the Blood Prison.

These Origin King Realm cultivators obviously had no use for Domain Stones personally, but they had descendants and disciples who needed them. In short, every Domain Stone brought out from the Blood Prison could sell for an incredible price.

Among these seven Origin Kings, there was one man who wore golden robes and had a purple gold crown atop his head who was the most conspicuous. When the other masters present looked at him, they all wore dignified expressions.

This man looked like he was only about thirty or so years old and had sharp, sword-like brows. His expression was stern and dignified, as if he had been born into a high position, giving him a noble air.

At this moment, this man had his eyes closed and seemed to be resting.

Suddenly, his eyes opened and he mumbled under his breath in a soft voice, seemingly surprised.

All the other Origin Kings in the surrounding area looked towards him one after another.

An old woman frowned pensively for a moment before asking with a chuckle, “Sir Luo Hai, did you find something interesting? If it’s convenient, could you tell us about it? We are well aware that on Green Mountains Star, only you, the Star Master, can sense some things inside the Blood Prison.”

Another master nodded and said, “Yes, although this place is very close to the Blood Prison, only you can truly sense anything inside of it. Our Divine Senses simply cannot penetrate the barrier surrounding this place, so we can only ask you. What is happening inside now?”

The man named Luo Hai smiled, stood up, and said unhurriedly, “This King did find something interesting, but it’s not a big deal. You don’t have to make such a fuss. En, it seems that for this time’s Blood Prison Trial, a little fellow at the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm went in.”

“Oh? A Second-Order Origin Returning Realm?” The old woman looked surprised.

The others were also surprised.

“A Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator entering the Blood Prison isn’t without precedent, but there are very few instances of it happening and their fates have always been quite tragic. Essentially all who tried died after only a day or two. Most of them were just small characters with eyes that failed to see. I’m afraid it’s the same for this person,” The old woman shook her head slowly with a hint of contempt.

“En, such hot-headed youths won’t settle down unless they suffer a bit. The Blood Prison Trial has always been for Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators, and although there are no explicit rules forbidding others to enter, ten thousand years of experience has proved that such ideas are not wise!”

“Brother Luo Hai, what’s the situation of that little guy now? You being interested in him must mean he has done something extraordinary, yes?” A beautiful woman smiled and looked at Luo Hai. This beautiful woman had an enchanting visage and a First-Order Origin King cultivation, but she still acted cautiously when facing Luo Hai.

This was not just because Luo Hai’s cultivation was higher than her own by a Minor Realm, but because this was Green Mountains Star, Luo Hai’s territory!

No one was stupid enough to oppose a Star Master on their Cultivation Star!

To put it bluntly, even if a top master at the Third-Order Origin King Realm came here, they might not be able to kill Luo Hai on Green Mountains Star.

Here, he was the master.

When Luo Hai broke through to the Third-Order Origin King Realm, any master who came to Green Mountains Star would need to give him face, and Luo Hai, who had refined a Star Source, definitely had such potential!

Therefore, the Origin King Realm masters present, while afraid of Luo Hai, also took a flattering attitude towards him.

“He didn’t have any kind of impressive performance,” Luo Hai smiled slightly, “It’s just that this King hasn’t seen such an interesting little fellow in quite a long time, so I was simply a bit curious. En, he seems to have rushed into a Domain Vortex now though, but the specific situation is something even this King cannot investigate; after all, even though this King is the Star Master of Green Mountains Star, his Divine Sense is greatly restricted inside the Blood Prison.”

“He rushed into a Domain Vortex?” The old woman sighed lightly, “It looks like he’ll be dead soon. There are always youngsters who don’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth.”

“He’s only getting what he deserves!”

“Forget it, there’s no need to pay any attention to him, he won’t live long. What I’m more interested in is if any good seedlings will survive this trial.”

“En, all of us have come to Green Mountains Star for this once in a millennium opportunity, right?”

Hearing everyone chattering amongst themselves, Luo Hai smiled and interjected, “Everyone, this King knows your purpose in coming here, but let this King warn you: If you see any good seedlings this time, you must not use force to bring them back with you, everything must be voluntary. This King, as the Star Master of Green Mountains Star, has an obligation and responsibility to protect these youngsters and ensure they receive fair treatment.”

“Brother Luo Hai need not worry, over all these years, which one of us has ever tried to use force? Of course, everything will be up to these Juniors’ will,” the beautiful woman pursed her lips and smiled.

“I don’t want to recruit anyone; this old master came here this time simply to buy Domain Stones. Heh heh, after all, these little brats will surely be able to collect a few,” A pale-haired old man grinned meaningfully, his expression turning somewhat unwillingly as he pined, “If it weren’t for Brother Luo Hai forbidding it, this old master would have preferred to enter the Blood Prison himself to search for Domain Stones.”

“Brother Zhou is mistaken,” Luo Hai shook his head, “It’s not that this King refuses to allow it, it’s simply that the Blood Prison has a barrier around it which was erected by Green Mountains Star’s previous Star Master before his death, one that shuts out any Origin King. While this King is now the new Star Master of Green Mountains Star, he still cannot do anything about this. It may be several thousand years before this King breaks through to the Third-Order Origin King Realm and is finally able ignore this barrier.”

“The previous generation’s Star Master put up a barrier?” Everyone was shocked, as if they had never heard such information.

“Yes, this King has never publicized it but this is a fact. Why else do you think that during that great war thousands of years ago, no one fled from the Blood Prison?”

“It was because of that barrier?” Someone showed a thoughtful look.

“En, this barrier was created using the power of Green Mountains Star itself and not only blocked the entry of an Origin King from the outside, but also stopped everyone already inside from leaving,” Luo Hai gently nodded.

“No wonder, no wonder more than twenty masters with such cultivation died inside. It turns out there was such a reason,” Someone muttered in understanding.

Many questions surrounded that war all those years ago, but the biggest was no doubt why there had been no survivors.

Even if that battle had been unprecedented in scale and intensity, involving a massive number of Origin Kings, logically speaking, it was impossible for absolutely no one to survive since entire Sects were involved.

However, the ancient records clearly stated that there had been no survivors.

Now listening to Luo Hai’s explanation, everyone understood.

With a barrier created using the power of Green Mountains Star, without the Star Master’s permission, no other Origin King could possibly escape. The final result may have been that the previous generation’s Star Master was greatly outnumbered and decided to take all his enemies down together with him.

Knowing the truth about the formation of the Blood Prison, everyone couldn’t help sighing and falling silent.

In the blink of an eye, three days passed by.

Suddenly Luo Hai let out another cry of surprise.

“Sir Luo Hai, have you discovered something else of interest?” The old woman frowned and asked.

“Interesting, truly interesting,” Luo Hai raised his brow, a look of pure surprise filling his face as he quickly said. “That little boy managed to emerge from that Domain Vortex!”

“What?” The old woman was shocked.

“Brother Luo Hai, you mean that little Second-Order Origin Returning Realm boy you mentioned before?” The beautiful woman was also shocked.

“Indeed! Curious, how did he manage to survive?” Luo Hai wore a suspicious look. Even though he was the Star Master of Green Mountains Star, he could not monitor the exact situation inside the Blood Prison, so Yang Kai managing to survive truly came as a surprise to him.

“Could it be that the Domain Vortex he entered was very weak?” Someone speculated, “The Domain Vortices in Blood Prison are endless, but some are so weak they aren’t even worth mentioning. He should have encountered such a Domain Vortex, right?”

“No! Not long before, a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm died in that same Domain Vortex, so it was definitely not weak,” Luo Hai slowly shook his head, denying that person’s guess.
