“Sure enough, it’s you!” Yin Le Sheng’s expression suddenly changed. Coming face to face with his enemy, his eyes started flashing fire and he gritted his teeth and added, “You’re pretty sturdy, not only did you survive the disaster back then, but you also came to the Shattered Star Sea.”

Yang Kai glared at him coldly before asking in a grim voice, “Yin Le Sheng, I’ll just ask you one question, you better answer me honestly. Where is the puppet that was with me back then?”

Yin Le Shen slightly smiled upon hearing this before responding, “Who knows? Since it’s your puppet, why are you asking me?”

[As expected, he does know about Xiao Xiao.] Yang Kai’s brow twitched. Although Yin Le Sheng didn’t directly answer Yang Kai’s question, Yang Kai could tell from his tone and demeanour.

Yang Kai immediately became furious and he glared at him and stated, “It seems that you’re not going to tell me.”

Yin Le Sheng rebuked with a grin, “Since you know it, why bother asking?”

“Good!” Yang Kai nodded as his aura instantly became extremely ferocious, like a cheetah ready to pounce on its prey, causing everyone present to shudder, “Since you aren’t going to tell me, this Young Master will beat you until you start speaking!”

Yin Le Sheng’s face turned ashen as he spoke, “Do you really think you are invincible in this world?”

“I admit I’m not invincible in this world, but pinching you to death will not be a problem.”

Yin Le Sheng broke into laughter instead of getting angry, “You think so? Why? Because you are a Star Master?”

“What!? Brother Yin, what did you just say?”

“Is this brat really a Star Master?”

“Aren’t Star Masters cultivators who came from lower Star Fields? Who would have thought that this little brat would be one of them?”

“I heard that all Star Masters have an intact Star Source, giving them a unique advantage in cultivating the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao. I wonder if it’s true or false.”

Upon hearing that Yang Kai was a Star Master, all the cultivators in the vicinity broke into pandemonium. They stared at Yang Kai with a heated gaze, as if they were looking at a huge piece of fresh meat.

Everyone had come to the Shattered Star Sea in search of Source Strength, but the Source Strength here was all from mere Shattered Star Sources, nothing more. Although absorbing and refining these Shattered Sources would still provide them an edge in cultivation, at the end of the day, they were still just broken remnants; how could they be comparable to an intact Star Source? An intact Star Source could give them a better comprehension of World Principles, something an incomplete Star Source couldn’t.

For a long time, there had been rumours that there were intact Star Sources in the Shattered Star Sea, but with the repeated opening of the Shattered Star Sea over time, these intact Star Sources had long found their owners. The remaining Star Sources were all broken.

Perhaps after a few more openings, even these incomplete Star Sources in the Shattered Star Sea would be carved up or dissipate. When that time came, the Shattered Star Sea would lose its current use and appeal to cultivators.

That was why everyone’s reaction was so over the top when they heard that Yang Kai was a Star Master.

Yin Le Sheng confirmed with a laugh, “This boy is indeed a Star Master. This Yin can personally guarantee this.”

Everyone gave him a weird look upon hearing this.

Lan He coldly snorted and said, “How ridiculous! Does the Netherworld Sect have no honour?”

Yang Kai had saved her life before, so now that Yang Kai was about to be targeted, she would naturally speak up on his behalf. It was quite evident that she wanted to advance and retreat with him now.

Yin Le Sheng turned gloomy as he looked around and stated, “If you don’t believe me, you can ask him, what was his cultivation seven years ago!”

A burly man immediately turned to Yang Kai and asked, “Little brat, didn’t you hear him? Quickly answer the question!”

Although Yang Kai’s previous act of killing a cultivator of the same level was very daunting, he was all alone. At this moment, with so many people targeting him, everyone believed that no matter how strong Yang Kai was, he couldn’t raise any more waves.

Yang Kai gave a sidelong glance at the burly man before rebuking him with a cold snort, “None of your damn business.”

He didn’t place any importance on the burly man at all, making the burly man go livid in anger.

Yin Le Sheng continued with a smile, “Seven years ago, he was only a Second-Order Origin King. Brother Yang, did I remember it correctly?”

“Second-Order Origin King!?”

“How… how is that possible!?”

“From Second-Order Origin King to Third-Order Dao Source Realm in just seven years!? Ai, how is this possible!?”

“Brother Yin, are you lying to us?”

A Second-Order Origin King actually reached the Third-Order Dao Source Realm in just seven years! Such a rate of progress was simply terrifying. Comparatively, everyone here had at most advanced by a Minor Realm over the past seven years, if they advanced at all.

Ying Le Sheng stated, “What good does it do for me to lie to you? Other opportunities might have played some part in helping him reach this level, but being a Star Master provided him with the greatest edge!”

“I have long heard that all the cultivators from lower Star Fields are geniuses, especially the Star Masters; their cultivation is as fast as flying. If Brother Yin is right, then you have really opened up my eyes today!”

“You’re believing the words of a Netherworld Sect disciple? Can’t you see that Yin Le Sheng has a grudge with this guy? He even went so far as to specifically point out that he is a Star Master! Clearly, he wants to murder with a borrowed knife.”

“I can see that, but who doesn’t want an intact Star Source? If I can get it…” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Endless whispers could be heard everywhere, but Yang Kai just sneered as he took a sidelong glance at Yin Le Sheng and stated, “You have been talking only about me, why does Brother Yin talk about himself as well? You were just a Third-Order Origin King seven years ago, am I right?”

Yin Le Sheng responded with a smile, “So what?”

As soon as he confirmed this, many people looked at Yin Le Sheng in surprise.

Yang Kai had spent seven years advancing from Second-Order Origin King to the Third-Order Dao Source Realm. That was already amazing enough, but they didn’t expect for Yin Le Sheng’s progress to be not much worse than his. Compared to these two, everyone suddenly felt they were somewhat mediocre.

Yin Le Sheng spoke in an open and confident manner, “There is no harm in telling you, this Yin is in fact, also a Star Master, so I can clearly tell how quickly a Star Master cultivates.”

When he confirmed this, everyone glanced at him with an extremely heated gaze.

Yin Le Sheng saw this and coldly snorted, “However, I am different from this brat. This Yin is the Legacy Disciple of the Sect Master of the Netherworld Sect. Before you make a move on me, you’d best first consider the consequences.”

Hearing this, many people’s expressions changed, and after a moment, many shook their heads as they looked away from Yin Le Sheng.

As a Star Master, Yin Le Sheng was also a very attractive target; however, he was a Legacy Disciple of a top Sect, so he certainly had a lot of life-saving cards up his sleeve. If they really fought a life and death battle with him, they might even lose their rice while trying to steal a chicken.

On the contrary, Yang Kai was easier to deal with.

However, it was precisely because Yin Le Sheng admitted that he was a Star Master that his previous statement became more convincing. Everyone’s gaze toward Yang Kai became more and more heated.

Yin Le Sheng broke into laughter as he mocked Yang Kai, “Yang Kai, there was a path to the Heavens but you refused to take it, instead you forced open the gates of Hell. With so many heroes present today, I want to see how you are going to escape!”

Yang Kai remained calm and composed as he scoffed, “How shameless, you want to murder me with a borrowed knife?”

“Who asked you to have an intact Star Source?” Yin Le Sheng remained indifferent as he shouted, “Everyone, my Netherworld Sect has a Secret Technique that can completely remove the Star Source from a Star Master, resulting in no loss at all. If any friend can take him down, he can ask for this Yin’s help to strip the Star Source from him. This Yin guarantees that he will do his best and will not do anything selfish!”

“Haha, since Brother Yin has said so, then I can rest assured. I was just wondering how I could snatch his Star Source after killing this little brat. It turns out that the Netherworld Sect has such an amazing Secret Technique,” the burly man, who had been disdained by Yang Kai before, burst into laughter.

Yin Le Sheng stated, “This guy is pretty strong. If you want his Star Source, you better attack him together.”

Now, he was nakedly urging everyone to deal with Yang Kai together. Although the cultivators present here didn’t like his approach, before the temptation of a complete Star Source, they couldn’t help but be moved. What’s more, Yang Kai’s previous arrogant and domineering attitude had irked them greatly.

In an instant, several dozen auras locked onto Yang Kai, causing a suffocating pressure. Lan He, who was standing next to Yang Kai, had turned pale as she furrowed her brow.

She might be strong, but she had never been an enemy of so many people at once. For a moment, she couldn’t help but feel a little uneasy, uncertain about her future as she quietly sized up Yang Kai.

When she did so, though, Lan He couldn’t help but be surprised.

Because Yang Kai was standing there in a completely calm and composed manner. There wasn’t the slightest bit of fear or timidity in him. The dozens of auras locked on him were like a spring breeze to him; they didn’t deter or affect him in the slightest.

[He has impressive mental strength!] Lan He was secretly shocked.

Her initial impression of Yang Kai was quite bad; she had thought that he was a perverted and petty man, but after Yang Kai saved her life, she looked at him in a new light.

After all, so many people were enjoying the show just now, while Yang Kai was the only one to help her. What’s more, he had no prior relationship with her, so him taking a stand to help her had warmed her heart.

Now that the situation had changed, and it was now Yang Kai who was being targeted by everyone, Lan He could not sit idly by.

Just when she had secretly made up her mind to help Yang Kai, he suddenly spoke to her in a low voice, “Sister Lan, leave this place first.”

Lan He furrowed her brow upon hearing this and she immediately asked in a shout, “Why!? Brother Yang, are you looking down on this Lan He?”

Yang Ka was taken aback. He gazed at her and asked, “When did I say that?”

Lan He asked, snorting, “Then why are you driving me away? Since you drew a sword to help me first, then I, Lan He can’t feign uninvolvement here. Don’t worry, if they dare to gang up on you, I will help you, and I won’t drag you down!”

Yang Kai looked at her in a daze before stating, “You’ll die!”

Lan He’s tender body momentarily shuddered, but she soon composed herself and stated in a loud and firm voice, “If I’m going to die, then so be it. I still won’t leave.”

A different look flashed in Yang Kai’s eyes as he swept his gaze over Lan He several times, as if he was just coming to know the real her. Suddenly, a stunned look appeared on his face as he asked, “Sister Lan He is from the Heavenly Wolf Valley, right?”

“That’s right!” Lan He agreed with a nod, wondering why Yang Kai was asking her this at this moment of life and death. In the end, it seems he was still a strange man.
