Maintaining his Half-Dragon Form, Yang Kai rushed to the larger half of the Ore Star and pressed the tip of his Azure Dragon Spear to one of its sides, shouting, “Help me!”

Luan Bai Feng understood what he wanted to do and shifted over, raising her hand to press the end of the Azure Dragon Spear to give Yang Kai a boost!

The Ore Star had been split into two after it fell into the Killing Array’s range. Yang Kai did not bother with the smaller half and allowed it to float about freely. Perhaps its fate was to end up in one of the other Arrays, eventually being reduced to nothingness.

The remaining piece was the larger one. After being cut and shaven down, it was less than half of the original size of the Ore Star, but it was just perfect for them to bring back.

In his Half-Dragon Form, Yang Kai possessed immense physical strength, but even with Luan Bai Feng’s added help, it still took them a lot of effort in order to change the Ore Star’s direction of movement.

After a few moments of continuous pushing, Yang Kai said, “It’s almost there.”

While saying that, he landed on the Ore Star in a flash while bringing Luan Bai Feng along, allowing the Ore Star to fly forward. He did not dare to speed up the pace that the Ore Star was moving at further; after all, there would be many Arrays on their way back. He still had to adjust the direction at certain points, and if the Ore Star was moving too quick, then it would be too late to stop it if a dangerous Array were to appear in front of them.

Yang Kai took out some Open Heaven Pills, swallowed them down, and refined them in order to restore his strength, all the while looking thoughtfully behind him.

Luan Bai Feng was also focused on recovering her strength. Even though she only exerted a little bit of energy from beginning to end, it still took a lot of effort in order to change the trajectory of the broken Ore Star.

“What are you looking at?” Luan Bai Feng followed Yang Kai’s gaze and asked curiously.

Though he bordered on what she would define as crazy, she held much admiration for Yang Kai after seeing what he was able to achieve. If everything went well, then it would take less than a month for them to bring this broken piece of Ore Star back to the outer periphery. Then, she could bring her ore slaves over to mine the Black Stones in peace.

However, Yang Kai was perhaps the only person who could achieve such a feat. As for others, they may not be able to do it even if they were in the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm. Before meeting Yang Kai, she had never seen anyone that was able to stop the encroachment of the strange aura present in the Black Territory before.

“Your attainments in the Dao of Spirit Arrays are not low. Were you able to discover anything from that Killing Array just now?” Yang Kai released his Dragon Transformation Secret Technique and returned to his original form.

Luan Bai Feng pondered for a moment before responding solemnly, “Did you see something?”

“If I could see something, then why would I still have to ask you?” Yang Kai slowly shook his head, “However, I have the nagging feeling that the Killing Array was not as simple as it seemed... That light at the end looked very much like a sword wave!”

“A sword wave?” Luan Bai Feng was stunned. She had an expression of uncertainty, “You’re not trying to say that Killing Array was man-made, are you?”

Yang Kai muttered thoughtfully, “If that truly was a sword wave, then I’m afraid it might be man-made.”

“Impossible!” Luan Bai Feng shook her head, “The might of that Killing Array is too terrifying. Who would be able to set such a terrifying Spirit Array? And, even if it were man-made, who would have the time to do something so meaningless? Don’t forget, there are Natural Arrays present all throughout the Black Territory.”

“That’s right!” Yang Kai nodded, “There are so many Arrays that if someone truly did arrange one here, it would be shocking indeed.” After a pause, he added, “And also, you have been staying here for so many years, yet you have never understood what this strange aura that fills the Black Territory is, correct?”

Luan Bai Feng did not deny it, “I tried to study it at first, but I couldn’t figure out any clues.”

Yang Kai frowned, “I heard before coming here that this Black Prison was a natural prison. Is that a rumour that spread after you took over this territory, or has that been around since the beginning?”

“It has been called that since long ago. It has nothing to do with me being here.” Luan Bai Feng also frowned, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Kai looked pensive, “I’m not sure either, but since the saying that this Black Prison was a natural prison had been circulated since a long time ago, if this place truly was a prison, were any prisoners held here in the past? Then, could it be possible that those Natural Arrays that we saw are actually...”

Luan Bai Feng shuddered, “Don’t say any more. Just thinking about it gives me goosebumps.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “What’re you worried about? We’re just having a casual chat. Of course, these are all just speculation and do not mean anything.”

Luan Bai Feng’s face looked grim, “If it truly was as you said, then what kind of prisoners are being held in the depths of the Black Prison that require so many layers of Arrays to restrict them? How terrifying must their cultivation be?”

Yang Kai stroked his chin in thought, “That is true. If there truly existed someone so terrifying, then there was no way that they would be captured. Maybe I was just overthinking it.”

Luan Bai Feng looked deeply at him and suddenly burst into a fit of anger, “Are you trying to scare me?”

Yang Kai snickered, “You yourself have small guts and you’re trying to blame others?”

Without waiting for Luan Bai Feng to snap back at him, he ordered, “Enough chit-chat. Hurry up and watch the front. If we accidentally crash into an Array, it would be too late to cry then.”

“You’re the one who’s going to cry!” Luan Bai Feng was pissed; however, despite how she reacted, she still activated her Eye Secret Technique and looked towards the void in front.

Along the way, they encountered all sorts of Arrays of all different types, but whether it be Yang Kai or Luan Bai Feng, they both had Eye Secret Techniques that could detect their presence early on, so they were able to change the direction of the Ore Star in advance.

Though the journey ahead was fraught with trouble, they did not encounter any actual risk.

A full month later, the two finally returned to the outer periphery of the Black Territory. The main reason it took so long was because they did not dare to speed up the Ore Star too much in case there were any incidents that they were unable to deal with in time.

It took a lot of effort for the two of them to stop the Ore Star just 10,000 kilometres away from the main shattered Spirit Province, despite it already having lost half of its initial speed during their trip. As soon as the Ore Star was in place, Luan Bai Feng sent out a command.

An incense stick of time later, Xin Peng led a group of Open Heaven Realm Masters over.

After landing on the broken Ore Star fragment, all of them were shocked beyond words. They had been living here for countless years, so they knew well what the situation was like in the outer periphery; however, it had been many years since any unmined Ore Star had existed in this outer region. All of them have been mined beyond recognition, and some had even shattered into dust.

So, the sudden emergence of a craggy Ore Star was naturally surprising.

“Warden, this is...” Xin Peng looked around curiously and confirmed that this Ore Star that he was standing on was one that he had never seen before.

“This is the Ore Star that Bai Feng and I brought from the Black Territory’s depths,” Yang Kai gave a casual explanation.

Luan Bai Feng immediately turned over to glare at him. Being called ‘Bai Feng’ did not sit right with her.

Many of the Open Heaven Realm Masters’ mouths hung open, all of them stunned as if they could not believe their ears.

Yang Kai did not explain much either, he just turned to Luan Bai Feng and said, “Call over all your ore slaves and tell them to begin mining.”

Luan Bai Feng snorted in response, but she still passed down the order. A few moments later, many Open Heaven Realm Masters took off, clearly in preparation to bring the ore slaves over.

Looking over at her, Yang kai asked, “How long do you think this Ore Star will last?”

Luan Bai Feng thought about the answer for a moment before answering, “It should last for at least two or three years. The environment here is comfortable, and there is no need for the ore slaves to worry about their World Force leaking, so they will be able to dedicate more time and energy to mining.”

“Two to three years... That sounds about right.” Yang Kai nodded.

Even though what he brought back was less than half of the original size of the Ore Star, there should be a good amount of cultivation materials present within it. After all, this Ore Star came from very deep within the Black Territory. It should not lack Sixth-Order materials, and there was the possibility of finding materials of the Seventh-Order or even Eighth-Order...

As long as they could fully mine this Ore Star, it should be enough for Void Land’s use for the time being.

Once the day came when this Ore Star was exhausted, there was no harm in running into the depths once more to bring back another in the same way. Now that he had Luan Bai Feng serving him, the entirety of the Black Prison was his personal treasury. Other than him, no one had the right to put their hands on the resources found deep inside of the Black Prison.

“Since everything is settled, I will return to Void Land. I’ll leave the rest to you to handle. Head to Void Land once every half year and hand me the mined materials,” Yang Kai ordered.

Luan Bai Feng was surprised, “Leaving already?”

Yang Kai smirked, “Have you grown attached to me already?”

“As if!” Luan Bai Feng spat, but then she simmered down a little, “But isn’t your Void Land in conflict with Zuo Quan Hui right now? It can’t be easy dealing with a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, right?”

Yang Kai nodded gravely, “Yes. The strength of a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master is truly powerful.” Recalling his fight with Zuo Quan Hui previously, he had to admit that there was a huge gap between himself and a Master in the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm. Last time, he was only able to injure Zuo Quan Hui with his Sun and Moon Divine Wheel because the latter was careless. If they were to fight again, and if Zuo Quan Hui was any more prepared than he was before, it would make it very difficult for Yang Kai to injure him again.

Luan Bai Feng quickly said, “I’ll go with you. I’m still a Sixth-Order Master, at the very least. I should be able to provide you with some help.”

Yang Kai looked at her in surprise, not expecting such an offer from her.

However, he had no intention of bringing Luan Bai Feng away from here. Void Land had 9 Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, so having one extra wouldn’t make much difference. Right now, the matter of gathering resources in the Black Prison was his top priority, so he wanted Luan Bai Feng to keep watch here.

“You’re not that loyal, are you?” Yang Kai grinned at her.

Luan Bai Feng snorted, “What good would it do me if you were to died? That’s why I have to keep an eye on you.”

It was easy to garner that she had been insincere just from this sentence alone. From her words and expression, Yang Kai instantly understood why she would take the initiative to offer her help.

Perhaps the bold speculation that he made on their way back from the Black Prison’s depths had scared her a bit, and now this woman didn’t feel safe here, which was why she was in such a hurry to leave with him.

To be honest, that speculation was just a casual thought Yang Kai had. Even he felt that the idea was ridiculous, but he did not expect Luan Bai Feng to take it so seriously.

“If you leave, then what about...” Yang Kai frowned.

Luan Bai Feng reminded, “Xin Peng has already signed your Loyalty List, so there is no need for you to worry if you keep him here to oversee the mining process. Later, I will teach him all the techniques required to enter and leave the Black Prison, and in case anything happens, he will report to you.”

She had already arranged everything so well, so Yang Kai could not refuse her. What’s more, Luan Bai Feng was a veteran Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master with excellent combat capabilities he could make use of if he brought her back. So, he eventually nodded, “In that case, we shall act according to your suggestion.”

Immediately, Luan Bai Feng called Xin Peng over and said a few words to him. She also handed him several jade tokens.
