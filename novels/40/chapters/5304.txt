Moments later on the Immortal Parasol Tree, a portal opened up. Yang Kai, who was held by the neck by Huang Si Niang, was tossed out onto his butt, “Scram!”

Yang Kai stood up and rubbed his behind, not knowing whether to laugh or cry, “Si Niang, if there’s anything wrong, you can speak to me nicely. Why get mad?”

“I have nothing to say to you, thief! Leave!”

With an innocent look, Yang Kai cried, “How can I be a thief? I’ve paid to stay… No. I have paid the rental and greeted you, Si Niang. I was just temporarily using your place to cultivate. Why did Si Niang kick me out?”

Just as the words left his mouth, a Yellow Crystal and a Blue Crystal were thrown onto him, “I’m returning those to you. Never come back again. Ever.”

Those crystals weren’t anything precious and she only kept them because they were unique. Did he really think that they meant a lot to her?

When angered, a Phoenix was incredibly strong. Yang Kai’s face was also swollen as a result of him not being able to dodge the crystals.

And as he saw the portal closing, Yang Kai said anxiously, “Si Niang, I have something to say! I’ll stop being so aggressive and be more easy-going when I cultivate!”

There was no response. Huang Si Niang had already sealed up the portal to her Phoenix Nest, fully restricting him from entering.

However, Yang Kai could feel minor traces of the portal, and if he tried, he might be able to forcefully break in. But, he would suffer even if he succeeded since the owner no longer welcomed him.

Things had changed once again…

Yang Kai stood alone on a branch of the Immortal Parasol Tree feeling dejected.

Multiple Young Dragons passing by looked up from below and glared at him, making him even more embarrassed.

Though the No-Return Pass was large, he had nowhere to go after Huang Si Niang kicked him out. Did he really have to spend his nights on the street? The situation would still be alright if it was only a matter of one or two days since he could just walk around and time would fly by, but this was a matter of months. If word of this spread, it would embarrass not just him, but the rest of the Human Race as well.

Moreover, he had just tasted the benefits of a Phoenix Nest. After merely whetting his appetite, he was kicked out, leaving him craving for more.

The Phoenix Nest was really an excellent place for him to cultivate. According to the levels of mastery he pioneered, his Dao of Space was currently at the Eighth Level, Summiting the Peak, so if his skill were to ascend to the level above, the Ninth Level, it would reach Shocking History and Dazzling the Present.

Yang Kai believed that when he successfully reached this level, even if he couldn’t make a breakthrough with his cultivation, his strength would certainly grow significantly.

How could he be content to just let himself be kicked out?

There was nothing he could do while standing outside the portal as no matter how he pleaded, appealed, or vowed to the Heavens and Earth, Huang Si Niang was adamant about not letting him back in.

After trying for some time, Yang Kai eventually gave up as he still had some shame.

At last, he sighed. There had to be a place for him somewhere else.

He raised his head and surveyed the surrounding area, and then he leapt and landed on another tree branch. He greeted the void in front of him, “Junior Yang Kai greets Senior. This is my first time at the No-Return Pass and I have nowhere to go. Could you lend me a spot in your precious home to temporarily live in?”

The Void swirled in front of him, followed by the appearance of a portal, causing Yang Kai’s face to brighten up.

A woman with bright eyes and bright teeth protruded from the portal and looked at Yang Kai with a disgusted expression, scolding, “Go away!”

Saying so, she immediately retreated, followed by the portal closing.

That made Yang Kai terribly embarrassed. [Just say no if you’re not willing to lend me a place. Why come out and scold me?]

After appealing his case for some time, Yang Kai approached another branch, gave a respectful salute, and then asked for a place to temporarily live.

Due to his proficiency with the Dao of Space, it was simple for him to locate the hidden Phoenix Nests on the Immortal Parasol Tree.

However, the Phoenix Clan members’ attitudes towards him remained essentially the same. If they had a mild temperament, they wouldn’t show up at all and just ignored him, allowing him to just yell outside for a bit.

As for the hot-tempered ones, they either opened the door to scold him or assaulted him in moderation to chase him away, with no intention of hurting him.

Yang Kai realised there was likely no hope of seeking shelter from the Phoenix Clan after getting rejected about 7 or 8 times in a row.

He was also unsure whether the Phoenix Clan had some sort of mysterious way to communicate with each other. Either way, all the Phoenix Clan members should have already known what happened between Huang Si Niang and him previously, or they would have no reason to reject him so stubbornly.

Borrowing a place to stay for a month or two wasn’t an issue, the problem was him stealing from the owner while lodging in their home. How would anybody let him inside after learning about such thievery?

Now, he was not permitted to enter the Phoenix Nest and the Dragon Clan did not welcome him. Despite how large the No-Return Pass was, Yang Kai actually had no place to stay. This was certainly one of the most distressing situations he encountered after so many years of cultivation.

Again, he arrived in front of another portal, bowed to salute and asked sincerely for a place.

As expected, there was no reaction. Perhaps this was a mild-tempered Phoenix, so they did not bother with or assault Yang Kai.

No matter the situation, he couldn’t just force his way in if the owner didn’t open the door.

Exasperated and dejected, he wanted to head to another Phoenix Nest to try his luck; however, just when he turned to leave, he frowned, carefully examining the Void in front of him.

After some time of examination, he flashed to another Phoenix Nest.

He had changed multiple locations before making his way over to Huang Si Niang’s Phoenix Nest. He lifted his hand and knocked on the Void in front of him, saying, “Si Niang, I have a question.”

There was no response from Huang Si Niang, as she was obviously ignoring him.

Yang Kai continued, “I’m really here to just ask a question, not to borrow a place.”

The Void rippled a little, and Si Niang stuck her head out with a cautious look on her face, “What?”

Yang Kai didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, [You’re still a noble and powerful Phoenix, there’s no need to be so on guard against me.]

He looked into the Phoenix Nest and before he could say a word, Huang Si Niang reprimanded, “What are you looking at? You can’t come in. If you need to say something, say it. Otherwise, leave!”

Yang Kai wanted to ask if he could come in for a conversation, but after seeing Huang Si Niang’s attitude, he was scared that he would receive another scolding if he did. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Brushing off that thought, he said, “I just made my way across the Immortal Parasol Tree, visiting many Phoenix Clan Seniors and I came onto something odd.”

Huang Si Niang sneered because she witnessed what happened. This Brat was thick-skinned enough to say that he was only ‘visiting’ them after getting rejected so many times.

Then, he pointed to the Phoenix Nest he visited last, “The portal of that Phoenix Nest seems to have not been opened for many years. Is the Senior cultivating in retreat inside? There hasn’t been any motion from it. Could they have encountered an accident?”

Huang Si Niang glanced in the direction he pointed, frowned, and replied in surprise, “You can tell that the portal hasn’t been opened for many years?”

“Every time a portal is opened, it will leave a few unnoticeable traces. These traces are undetectable to others, but you and I should be able to see them, right?” He nonchalantly said.

“En,” Huang Si Niang replied flatly, understanding that this Brat really did have a higher comprehension of the Dao of Space than her; otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to notice things like this.

She initially couldn’t be bothered anymore, but still explained out of kindness, “There are some Phoenix Nests that have no owners. The owner of the Phoenix Nest you were referring to hasn’t returned for a long time.”

Although members of the Phoenix Clan were scarce, some were still born over time. Most of the Phoenix Clan members lived on the Immortal Parasol Tree, but there were always some others venturing outside.

The majority of these venturing Phoenix Clan members had been involved in accidents and perished, whereas some might have come across accidents where they were stuck and were unable to flee. The Phoenix Nest of these members remained, but nobody had entered them for many, many years.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up when he heard it, “An ownerless Phoenix Nest?”

Huang Si Niang knew what he was up to based on his expression and said with a smile, “There are as many Phoenix Nests on the Immortal Parasol Tree as there are Phoenixes in my Phoenix Clan. A Phoenix Nest is the origin of a Phoenix Clan Source. In other words, the existence of both is interconnected. Unless the Source is destroyed, the Phoenix Nest will remain forever. Those Phoenix Nests which currently have no owner may have already been involved in an accident and have fallen. Nevertheless, their Source survived. However, it is most likely that those carrying these Phoenix Sources aren’t pure Phoenix Clan members, so they can’t locate this place and arrive here.”

The slightly sidetracked Yang Kai then said, “What Si Niang means is that every Phoenix Clan member’s Source correlates to a Phoenix Nest. If the individuals who obtain the Phoenix Clan Source discovers this place, they will be able to own their personal Phoenix Nest?”

“Correct,” Huang Si Niang nodded.

Any existence that arrived here and cultivated in their Phoenix Nest would eventually transform into a pure Phoenix Clan member, regardless of how they attained their Phoenix Clan Source.

“So that is how it works!” Yang Kai muttered.

“Nothing else, right? If there’s nothing else, stop bothering me.” Without allowing Yang Kai to respond, she snapped and retracted her head.

“Si Niang, wait…” Yang Kai raised his hand to stop her but was too slow.

According to her attitude, Huang Si Niang made it obvious that she didn’t want to talk to him anymore.

Of course, Yang Kai didn’t push the issue, but if what Si Niang stated was accurate, then one of these ownerless Phoenix Nests on this Immortal Parasol Tree would belong to Su Yan, another to Jiu Feng, and another to Liu Yan!

These three individuals possessed Phoenix Clan Sources.

Now, things were getting interesting.

Yang Kai scrutinised his surroundings, then once again arrived at the ownerless Phoenix Nest. He rubbed his chin and pondered.

On the other hand, in Huang Si Niang’s Phoenix Nest, Feng Liu Lang asked after holding it back for a long time, “Why did you mislead him?”

She snorted lightly, “To keep him busy. Or else, he would come to disturb me again. So annoying!”

Feng Liu Lang sighed, deep down knowing Yang Kai was about to get in trouble again.

Huang Si Niang did not lie to him, but she did not make things clear either.

It was true that each Phoenix Nest on the Immortal Parasol Tree corresponded to a Phoenix Clan Source; but also, those Phoenix Clan Sources were the only keys to unlock these Phoenix Nests.

Without the corresponding Phoenix Clan Source, no matter how proficient Yang Kai was with the Dao of Space, he would never be able to open these unowned Phoenix Nests.

There was an undetermined amount of Phoenix Nests. Since the creation of the Universe, the Immortal Parasol Tree, and the Phoenix Clan, the number of the Phoenix Nests had increased and decreased as a result of several factors over the ages.

A greater number of Phoenix Nests indicated a greater amount of Phoenix Sources remaining, and decreased Phoenix Nests indicated decreased Phoenix Sources; nonetheless, these two factors were unrelated to the life or death of a Phoenix. Even when a Phoenix Clan member fell due to an accident, as long as their Source remained, their Phoenix Nest would never be destroyed.

If anyone obtained that Source by chance and cultivated it in a Phoenix Nest in the No-Return Pass, they would have the opportunity to shed their former body to be reborn as a pure member of the Phoenix Clan.
