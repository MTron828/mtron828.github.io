If they allowed Yang Kai to use his Dragon Pressure, all of the Dragon Clan members here would be no match for him; therefore, before the battle even began, the Fourth Elder had to solve the problem of bloodline suppression, and the Blessing Technique was his only way.

As they uttered Dragon Language at the same time, Dragon Roars could be heard from the hidden Dragon Temple in the distance. Following that, a dozen beams of lights shot up into the sky as though countless Dragons were emerging as they zigzagged across the skyline and arrived above the Spirit Island in the blink of an eye. After that, they plunged towards the island.

The Dragon Clan members were elated upon seeing that, so they stepped forward to welcome the lights.

*Chi, Chi, Chi, Chi…*

One by one, those lights from the Dragon Temple entered the bodies of those Dragon Clan members. Although the lights couldn’t help them increase their power, they had given them a boost of confidence. At that moment, the Dragon Clan members felt as though they had been reborn, and they were no longer wary of Yang Kai.

“Come!” Yang Kai growled, upon which, a beam of light changed its direction and circumvented a Dragon Clan member, who was flying towards the light. After that, it landed beside Yang Kai and rushed into Li Jiao’s body.

Li Jiao shuddered as he still couldn’t grasp what was going on. However, after the beam of light entered his chest, he could feel his body going through a series of changes. The most conspicuous change was that the Dragon Pressure from the Dragon Clan members around him seemed to have less impact on him. Hence, his bloodline, which had been suppressed, was set free. His Emperor Qi also started flowing within his body without facing any obstacles.

“What is this?” Li Jiao appeared lost as he spread his palms and had a look. He still couldn’t believe what just happened.

“It’s the Dragon Temple’s Blessing,” Yang Kai replied nonchalantly and shook his head, apparently displeased.

His original intention was to intercept all the Blessings from the Dragon Temple. If he could achieve that, he wouldn’t even need to move a muscle to win this battle. His Golden Divine Dragon Source alone was enough to suppress all the Dragon Clan members, and he wouldn’t even need to utilize half of his power to defeat them.

However, he had underestimated Zhu Kong as he lost to the latter when grabbing the Blessings. In the end, Zhu Kong was the Dragon Clan’s Fourth Elder, so he was naturally more skilful at communicating with the Dragon Temple.

A glint flashed across Li Jiao’s eyes after he heard Yang Kai’s reply. Since he was facing off against the Dragon Clan, he had been subjected to bloodline suppression. The reason he could step out of the crowd and side with Yang Kai in a steadfast manner earlier was that he wanted to do something for Lu San Niang. If he wanted to get her revenge for her, he needed Yang Kai’s help.

Nevertheless. he didn’t think that he would be able to contribute much to this battle; after all, he only had a Third-Order Mid-Rank Dragon Vein, so he wouldn’t stand a chance of defeating the pureblood Dragon Clan members.

However, now, the bloodline suppression had been significantly offset. It was as though their bloodlines had returned to the same starting point, and they were not able to suppress one another.

With a grim expression, Li Jiao looked in the direction Fu Chi had left as his eyes beamed with a ferocious glare. In a lowered voice, he uttered, “Brother Yang, thanks for your help. I want to…”

“Go ahead.” Yang Kai knew what Li Jiao wanted to do, so he agreed to it before the latter could finish his words.

“I’ll be right back!” After Li Jiao finished speaking, he retreated and disappeared from the puzzled crowd’s sight.

While Yang Kai and Li Jiao were having a brief chat, the space around the Fourth Elder started contorting, as though it would collapse at any moment. After resisting for a bit, he still couldn’t break this Space Divine Ability, so he heaved a sigh and growled, “Since you want a fight, I’ll grant your wish!”

Li Wu Yi snorted, “Come, Fourth Elder!”

As he spoke, his hand, which had been stuck in mid-air, plunged suddenly.

Without a warning, the Fourth Elder disappeared, as though he hadn’t been there from the beginning. At the same time, Li Wu Yi vanished into thin air as well, while the surface of the space where he stood rippled.

Yang Kai arched his brow as he realized that this was a move utilizing Space Principles. It seemed that Li Wu Yi had dragged the Fourth Elder into an unknown space.

Li Wu Yi lived up to his name as the strongest Master beneath the Great Emperors. Although Yang Kai had never battled against the Fourth Elder before, he had guessed that the latter must be much stronger than ordinary Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters, but despite that, the Fourth Elder still couldn’t break Li Wu Yi’s Divine Ability.

Apparently, Li Wu Yi wanted a one-on-one fight with the Fourth Elder, which Yang Kai was glad to see. With the formidable Fourth Elder out of the way, he wasn’t afraid of the other Dragon Clan members left in this place. Furthermore, he wasn’t alone.

“I suffered some setbacks when dealing with you bastards last time, so I’m going to get my revenge today!” Jiu Feng swept a glance across the Dragons with a sneer.

Hearing that, all the Dragon Clan members were enraged. The Dragon Clan was the leader of all Divine Spirits as well as the strongest race in this world, so no one had dared to call them ‘bastards’ before.

Even Zhu Lie frowned after he heard that. By cursing at the Dragon Clan, Jiu Feng was basically scolding Zhu Qing and him as well. Nevertheless, he and Zhu Qing had confronted Jiu Feng and Li Wu Yi in that incident more than ten years ago, so they knew how unrestrained this woman was.

With dark expressions, all the Dragons remained silent, but their gazes had indicated their emotions.

Yang Kai swept a glance over all the Dragons and said, “Let Qing’er and me leave, and I won’t make things difficult for you.”

He didn’t want to completely fall out with the Dragon Clan. So, it would be wonderful if they could just set their differences aside first and let Zhu Qing and him go.

“Brat, that’s not what a friend should do!” Jiu Feng shot him a glare as she didn’t expect that he would make such a suggestion at this point.

If Yang Kai left, she would have to face the Dragon Clan alone. Although she was fairly powerful, she wouldn’t be able to defeat the more than ten Dragon Clan members before her eyes.

“Senior, you can leave with us.” Yang Kai looked down at her.

Jiu Feng replied, “I’ve come here all the way from Spirit Beast Island because there’s a mission I have to complete. If I leave, how will the others cope with it?”

Yang Kai uttered, “The Great Emperor is practically almighty, so you don’t have to worry about him. As for Senior Li, he’s even more proficient in the Dao of Space than I am. If he wants to escape, no one on Dragon Island can stop him.”

Jiu Feng burst into laughter, “You’re right; however, these guys over there don’t seem willing to let you go.”

Yang Kai turned his head and realized that all the Dragon Clan members remained silent with stern expressions on their faces.

Seeing that, he knew that it was impossible to settle the issue peacefully on this day. Thus, he nodded slightly, “In every battle, there are bound to be injuries and even deaths. When that happens, don’t you dare complain!”

After he finished his words, his 80-metre-tall figure vanished into thin air suddenly.

Upon the circulation of Space Principles, Yang Kai pounced on a group of Dragons. With a ruthless expression, he extended his gargantuan palm and clawed at one of the Dragon Clan members in a reckless and arrogant manner.

Despite the sudden attack, the Dragons didn’t seem flustered as they had put up their guard. Seeing him, they immediately dispersed in all directions.

However, the Dragon Clan member targeted by Yang Kai suddenly felt that the space around him had turned sticky, like he was wading through mud. Seeing that, he was startled. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

It was because of this short delay that Yang Kai managed to grab him with his claw. It wasn’t certain whether this Dragon Clan member was from the Zhu Clan or the Fu Clan, but judging from the level of purity of his Dragon Aura, Yang Kai knew that he must be an Eighth-Order.

Eighth-Order Dragons were pretty rare on Dragon Island. There were only about a couple dozen Dragon Clan members in total, five of which were Eighth-Order. Excluding Zhu Lie and Fu Chi, only three of them were in the Eighth-Order, and the Dragon in Yang Kai’s hand was one of them.

Having been captured by Yang Kai, the Dragon Clan member was flabbergasted. He was still reeling from the shock that Yang Kai was able to tear Fu Chi’s arms apart with ease. Being in Yang Kai’s hands now, he knew that he would end up in an even more miserable state than what had befallen Fu Chi.

Right then, a thunderous Dragon roar broke through the sky.

The Dragon Clan member transformed into a 200 metre long Dragon as his immense Dragon Pressure spread across the island, giving intense pressure to the others.

By turning into his true form, he was able to utilize his full power. No matter how powerful Yang Kai was, he couldn’t possibly pinch him to death with one hand. After all, the Great Dragon’s size was truly immense.

As expected, after the Dragon Clan member transformed into his True Dragon Form, Yang Kai claw was spread apart and he was no longer able to sustain his grip. The Dragon Clan member then squirmed and struggled out of Yang Kai’s grasp.

Nevertheless, Yang Kai growled and extended both hands before he grabbed his opponent’s Dragon Tail. The muscles on his arms swelled up, as though his arms had become twice their original size.

With the Dragon Tail in his hands, Yang Kai exerted more force and pulled the Dragon back down.

Under the gaze of all the dumbfounded people, the Great Dragon, which was about to fly towards the sky, was stopped and then thrown down on the ground like a dead snake.

With a loud thud, the ground in front of the palace separated and formed a spider-web like crack. At the same time, a distressed Dragon roar was heard.

After transforming into an 80-metre-tall Half-Dragon, Yang Kai had become immensely strong, so even a Great Dragon couldn’t stand it when he was smashed to the ground. As the unlucky Great Dragon roared, he sprayed out his Dragon Blood, apparently having suffered some internal injuries.

Yang Kai stepped on the Great Dragon and scanned his Dragon Scales with widened eyes. In just a short moment, he had located his target.

It was a Dragon Scale that was as large as a washbasin, which didn’t look different from the other Dragon Scales. However, upon closer inspection, Yang Kai could see that a glint flashed across that particular Dragon Scale intermittently.

It was the Blessing Technique from the Dragon Temple!

Based on his previous experience of dealing with Zhu Lie, Yang Kai knew that only a particular Dragon Scale would be blessed with the Blessing Technique. By just removing that Dragon Scale, the Blessing from the Dragon Temple would lose its effect.

Yang Kai stuck his claw under that special Dragon Scale as the veins on his forehead bulged. Utilizing all his energy, he yanked the scale out.

Feeling excruciating pain, the Great Dragon growled and turned his head before spraying out his Dragon Breath at Yang Kai. The breath was extremely cold, as though it was about to freeze Yang Kai over.

In an instant, Yang Kai’s towering figure was covered in frost, and his hair also became snowy white, but he remained unperturbed.

*Chi…*

Dragon Blood started spurting out of the wound as a dazzling Dragon Scale had been pulled out by Yang Kai.

Without the Dragon Temple’s Blessing, the Eighth-Order Great Dragon became listless as Yang Kai’s bloodline suppression had made him unable to use his strength. In the blink of an eye, his 200-metre-long figure had shrunk by tens of metres, as though he would be unable to sustain his Dragon Form for much longer.

After stepping off from the Great Dragon, Yang Kai landed a kick on him, upon which the latter shot into the air and then plunged into the sea with a splash.

Then, Yang Kai shook his body a little to shake off the ice. With the bloodied Dragon Scale in his hand, he swept a glance across the other Dragon Clan members and spoke in a cold voice that would send chills down their spines, “He was the first. Who’s next?”
