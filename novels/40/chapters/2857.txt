An Assassin Demon was unable to evade and was struck by the lightning snake, causing all of his hair to stand on end and his body to be scorched from head to toe. The lightning snake then burst out of the Assassin Demon’s body, transforming into a lightning net, covering the entire sky.

One by one, the Assassin Demons were paralyzed and started shaking. The Aerial Cavalry, who were chasing after them, shot their arrows without even a moment’s delay, piercing their chests through.

The lightning net had exposed all the Assassin Demons while the Aerial Cavalry were not affected at all. This was evidence of Yue and Lu’s exquisite ability to control Shamanic Spells.

The Aerial Cavalry no longer had to worry about the silent assassins and once again demonstrated their amazing combat effectiveness by supporting their brethren down below.

Sha Ya sent three waves of Assassin Demons, one after another, but none of them managed to kill a single Aerial Cavalry, causing her to fume at the loss of so many of her troops.

On the battlefield, the Demons and Barbarians fought head-on with each other, with the demonised Barbarians as the vanguard. The strategy of letting the Red Demons use the frontal clash as a distraction turned out useless and instead allowed the Ancient Barbarians to rush the Demon formations and disrupt their coordination.

Sand Demons relied on their earth-escape ability to travel underground and create disturbances on the battlefield, which was indeed effective and caused some damage to the Shaman Niu Clan.

However, blessed by Life Chains, the lives of all the Ancient Barbarians were linked, so even if someone suffered a fatal injury, they would not die immediately. The damage was evenly distributed among those connected by the Life Chains while vitality from those who weren’t injured moved to help their wounded clansmen recover.

So far, the Demons suffered hundreds of casualties, but none of the Barbarians had fallen.

Life Chains deserved its reputation as one of the most important Shamanic Spells in large-scale warfare. With such a Shamanic Spell connecting them all, everyone in the Shaman Niu Clan dared to even face against a Dragon!

Sha Ya grew agitated.

She had paid a heavy price for her rash decision this time.

Before the battle, she thought she could secure a victory with a surprise attack using Red Demons, but did not expect that this strategy would turn out useless.

The Shadow Demon Clan who went forward after that were also killed by the opponent’s Shamans and archers.

Although the numbers of the two armies were similar, the combat effectiveness was vastly different.

Sha Ya had no choice but to use the strongest fighters under her command.

The roars from beasts caused the world to tremble as if thousands of horses were galloping across the plain. The Demon Cavalry charged out, riding on the hideous Demon Beasts. These burly figures plunged into the battlefield and none of the Barbarians could stop them. Everywhere they passed, Barbarians were routed and tossed about. It was at this moment that the tide of battle turned to favour the Demons.

The rest of the Demons, following behind their cavalry, immediately launched a counterattack on the Ancient Barbarians.

The sharp arrows shot by the Aerial Cavalry did not have much effect either this time as the hides of the Demon Beasts were too tough and bulky, causing the sharp arrows to simply tickle them.

“It’s time for us to make a move!” Yue and Lu announced in unison, their expressions solemn.

The dozen Shamans of different Realms had been fulfilling a support role from the rear the whole time. Some of the older Shamans were still calm, but the young Shamans were obviously nervous. It was a huge impact for them to see so many casualties in their first real battle.

But they were the key to curb the momentum of the Demon Cavalry.

The Elite Guards surrounding the Shamans marched towards the battlefield, drawing Sha Ya’s gaze towards them as she frowned. Although she did not know what the Barbarians were doing now, a sense of uneasiness fluttered in her heart.

“You’re finished,” A voice suddenly came from nearby.

Sha Ya was shocked, and when she turned her head around, she immediately saw a green man beside her.

Sha Ya’s heart almost jumped out of her well-endowed chest. With her strength, how could she not notice her enemy’s arrival, or even approach? If this man had directly launched a sneak attack, would she have been able to react?

[I… most likely would not have been able to survive…]

[But… Why is this man not watching over his people while they fight? Why did he suddenly appear here instead?]

As if she had thought of something, Sha Ya smiled, “Are you thinking about surrendering yourself into the arms of the Great Demon God?”

Yang Kai turned his head to look at her, grinning, “Still considering my options. Of course, if you can remove the green poison, I will consider it more sincerely.”

Sha Ya sneered, “In your dreams, the Green Demon Poison cannot be removed unless… you become my slave.”

Yang Kai frowned and asked, “Is that really the only way?”

Sha Ya answered, “The only way!”

Yang Kai nodded.

Sha Ya smiled charmingly as she teased, “The past two days haven’t been good, right? To be honest, I’m surprised that you can still maintain consciousness, but the more you persist, the more pain you will be in.”

Yang Kai sighed, “Right now, I do feel some slight degree of pain.”

Sha Ya tilted her head, “I can’t tell at all.”

Yang Kai grinned, “Men always have to appear strong, don’t they?”

Sha Ya elegantly smiled, “You are indeed qualified to be my slave. I can assure you that after you undergo demonification, I will allow you to keep your consciousness. There won’t be the slightest difference from before.”

Yang Kai raised his brows, “I can still retain my consciousness? But why did my demonised clansmen…”

Sha Ya curled her lips, and replied in disdain, “They are nothing but a bunch of disposable pawns, not worth the price I would have to pay to keep them sane. But you are different. It is worth some sacrifice on my part to keep a Master like you clear minded.”

“You flatter me, I really don’t know how to repay you.” Yang Kai smiled gently.

Sha Ya giggled, “Just be obedient.”

“So, shall we start now?” Yang Kai turned his head and looked at her.

Sha Ya’s smile narrowed and she looked over at the battlefield, only to see that the Demons were falling into a rout. After the dozen or so Shamans moved to the front, a series of powerful Shamanic Spells were released, forcing the Demon Cavalry to retreat. Some of the advantages they had obtained disappeared, and if it were not for the Sand Demons’ continuous harassment, the Demon Cavalry would have been wiped out already.

But even so, the situation for the Demon Race was not optimistic.

Since the battle began, more than half of their army had been lost, and the losses continued to accumulate. On the contrary, the Barbarian army was becoming increasingly confident and spirited.

“I need to pay a steep price to make you my slave, so what can you give me in return?” Sha Ya suddenly turned her head to look at Yang Kai.

“What do you need?” Yang Kai asked.

Sha Ya raised her hand and pointed to the front, “I want to see your sincerity. Only with enough sincerity can you win my trust. Decide for yourself. Your time is running out.”

Yang Kai grinned meaningfully, “Simple enough.”

When his words fell, he had already swooped into the battlefield, and anything that came his way was killed with a single hit. None of the Demons could resist his advance.

His bloody appearance did not displease Sha Ya though, and instead, she watched with relish, her eyes glued on Yang Kai’s body as a strange light flashed across their depths.

The Demons backed away and evaded Yang Kai, obviously aware that he was not someone they could contend with.

A moment later, Yang Kai arrived at the frontline of the battle between the two armies.

“Sir, why are you…” Yue suddenly noticed Yang Kai’s presence, and said with a dazed expression, “Did you come from that side?”

His own camp was at the rear, but Yang Kai had clearly come over from the Demons’ side just now. Moreover, as the commander of an army, it was an unwise move to appear inexplicably on the battlefield where the two armies were facing each other instead of issuing orders from the rear.

Just as she was about to persuade him to leave, she suddenly had a vague feeling something bad was about to happen.

Lu felt the same way, and looked up at Yang Kai vigilantly, “Sir, what are you planning to do?”

Yang Kai smiled lightly at the twins, “Come with me.”

The twins fell silent for a moment before slowly shaking their heads.

The other Shamans were also confused by this situation and exchanged looks with one another.

“It’s not good to be disobedient. Have you forgotten what Sir Shaman Dang said when he gave both of you to me?” Yang Kai looked at them sternly, a sense of majesty in his expression.

Yue quickly replied, “If Sir’s intentions are really for the benefit of the Barbarian Race, we will naturally not disobey, but now… aren’t you planning to submit to the Demon Race?”

“What!?” All the Shamans were shocked and could not believe what they heard.

In unison, they looked up at Yang Kai, hoping that he would deny it, but instead of denying it, he just smiled and commented, “You do have very keen insight.”

Yue added, “There’s only one way to detoxify the Green Demon Poison, and that is to be transformed into a Demon. Sir… You really disappoint us.”

The Shamans instantly understood what the situation was all about from that short exchange.

Sir Shaman Niu was afflicted by the Green Demon Poison, and he obviously did not want to die, so he had to take refuge under the Demon Race. The twins, Yue and Lu, seemed to have understood his intentions a long time ago and had been preparing for this.

[What… What should we do now?]

This was the Shaman Niu Clan’s first real battle, and the twelve units of the army had worked together almost flawlessly to achieve a huge victory, but at this critical moment, their leader was betraying them.

The sudden change made everyone lose the ability to think, and their heads spun in confusion.

“You are very smart, no wonder you were able to enter the Shaman Divine Temple, but even if you know, what can you do?” Yang Kai chuckled lightly and stretched out one hand towards the twins and instantly, a brilliant flash of light blinded everyone.

The twins’ complexion changed drastically. Although they knew Shaman Niu was strong, they did not know that he was this strong.

The two of them did not even have time to react before their bodies were petrified. Neither of them even knew what kind of technique Yang Kai used.
