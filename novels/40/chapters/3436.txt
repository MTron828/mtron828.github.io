Space rippled, and a figure emerged slowly.

Yang Kai looked up at him, but his gaze was a little evasive as if he was ashamed. Nevertheless, he finally cupped his fists in respect, “Temple Master Wen.”

The one who appeared before his eyes was the Temple Master of Azure Sun Temple, Wen Zi Shan.

Wen Zi Shan had a sorrowful expression on his face as he sighed, “I heard everything. Are you feeling better now?”

Yang Kai replied, “Many thanks, Temple Master Wen, for your concern, I have fortunately recovered.”

Wen Zi Shan said, “Demonification is an absolute taboo. Senior Iron Blood said that you have a Demon in your heart, and if it is not eliminated, even if it’s not harmful now, it will become a major disaster in the future.”

“Then is Temple Master Wen here to take me back?” Yang Kai’s eyes drooped, and his voice suddenly became extremely calm, but the hostile spirit growing in him was apparent.

Wen Zi Shan answered, “Relax, I don’t want to be your enemy, I just want to talk to you properly.”

Yang Kai said plainly, “This disciple will listen carefully.”

Wen Zi Shan nodded gently and began, “Although you weren’t raised by my Azure Sun Temple, you have forged various connections with my temple ever since you were a mere Dao Source Realm Junior. It would not be wrong to say that this King watched you grow up. You could have also become a disciple of my Azure Sun Temple if you ever requested it. Unfortunately, my temple didn’t have this blessing, and we let slip a great talent.”

Yang Kai laughed in embarrassment, “Temple Master Wen is too polite.”

Wen Zi Shan continued, “Fortunately, you became a High-Rank Guest Elder of my temple. Since you’re an Elder of my temple, matters concerning you will be matters concerning this Wen, and it is also matters concerning the temple. Yang Kai, consider High Heaven Palace, consider your friends and relatives, and consider the ones who care about you. Come back with me.”

Yang Kai raised his eyes, “Temple Master is here to capture me after all.”

Wen Zi Shan frowned, “How can this be the same as capturing you? If this Wen came to capture you, I wouldn’t be speaking to you like this. If you come back with me, this Wen promises that no one will hurt you, but I will need your cooperation to eliminate the Demon in your heart.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“How can the Demon be eliminated after it is formed?” Yang Kai shook his head slowly.

Wen Zi Shan said deeply, “A strong person wins over others, but true strength comes from conquering oneself. Yang Kai, stop going astray.”

“I went astray?” Yang Kai laughed, his eyes turned cold, “Temple Master, since you have heard ‘everything’, do you know what happened?”

Wen Zi Shan hesitated for a moment, and sighed, “Senior Iron Blood might have crossed the line, but you shouldn’t have disobeyed him.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly became ferocious, “Based on what Temple Master said, this Junior should have surrendered Shi Huo willingly to Iron Blood just because he wanted me to, without any resistance?”

Wen Zi Shan persuaded earnestly, “There is always a solution to any conflict.”

Yang Kai sneered, “Shi Huo is one of my most important partners. He has made great contributions to my growth, and it is not an exaggeration to say that he is my family. In the confrontation with the Demon Race, he has killed countless enemies, but he is not allowed to live just because he cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Law? Is this world of billions of free cultivators, or the world of Iron Blood? Just his contributions to the war should have been enough to convince Iron Blood to spare him!” After a pause, Yang Kai stared at Wen Zi Shan sharply, “Temple Master will never understand, so this Junior will ask boldly. If Iron Blood wanted to cripple Senior Sister Gao’s cultivation, what would Temple Master do?”

Wen Zi Shan frowned, “You are bringing up irrelevant subjects.”

Yang Kai sneered, “To me, Shi Huo holds equal weight in my heart as Senior Sister Gao does to Temple Master’s.”

Wen Zi Shan fell silent, unable to come up with a response.

Yang Kai let out a long sigh, “Temple Master, I don’t know how you found me, but I have decided to live in seclusion with Qing’er here. From now on, I will shut myself away from the world. I also ask Temple Master to leave now for the sake of our past relationship. From now on, Yang Kai and Li Shi Qing no longer exist in the Star Boundary.”

Wen Zi Shan was shocked, and he looked at Yang Kai in amazement, “You want to live in seclusion here?”

“Yes!” Yang Kai nodded.

Wen Zi Shan started, “Then what about High Heaven Palace… “

“How is that my problem?” Yang Kai interrupted him.

Yang Kai’s words shocked Wen Zi Shan, and he could not speak for a long time. In the end, he smiled wryly, “There is indeed a Demon growing in your heart.”

“Temple Master, do you insist on capturing me?” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed slightly, exuding a dangerous light.

Wen Zi Shan sighed, “Since you truly have a Demon in your heart, this Temple Master cannot just sit back and watch.”

Yang Kai gritted his teeth, “This is my business, how does it concern you? Why do you have to keep pushing me into a corner? I have contributed greatly to the Star Boundary, can you not just ignore me for the sake of my previous efforts?”

Wen Zi Shan looked at him sadly as he shook his head, “It is precisely because of your contribution to the Star Boundary that I can’t give up on you.”

Yang Kai burst into laughter, “Your glib talk sounds better than singing. Since Temple Master is so stubborn, then this Junior will not be polite either. Get out here, what’s the point of sneaking around?”

When the words fell, Yang Kai looked around with cold eyes.

And followed by this angry outburst, one figure after another appeared around him, each of them a Third-Order Emperor, surrounding Yang Kai tightly from all sides.

Yang Kai looked at them one by one and then sneered, “Good, good, there are many familiar faces here!”

Ma Qing, the Holy Master of Heavenly Martial Holy Land held his sword behind his back with one hand and stroked his beard with the other, “Yang Boy, do you know that you are in a bad situation now? It will be too late if you don’t turn back now. It is already a miracle that you were able to restore your sanity from your demonification once, if it happens again, there will be no turning back!”

Yang Kai did not answer but instead turned to look at Li Jiao, “Does Brother Li have any words to teach me?”

Li Jiao covered his flushed face with his hands, “This Li had no choice but to join this mission. Brother Yang, please forgive me.”

Yang Kai nodded and turned to another person, “How about Temple Master Zhou?”

This man was the Eastern Territory’s Ahan Temple’s Temple Master, Zhou Ye Wang.

Zhou Ye Wang performed hand seals with a single hand and his figure flickered slightly. It obviously had something to do with his cultivation technique. He smiled, “What does Palace Master Yang want me to say?”

Yang Kai said, “No one will force you to say anything if you don’t want to.”

On the other side, Xiao Yu Yang spoke in a deep voice, “Yang Kai, turn back from the endless sea of tribulations, and repent!”

Lei Hong also bellowed, “You are still young, and you have the opportunity to set things right, why must you be so obsessed?”

Yang Kai stood on the spot with his eyes lowered, waiting for them to finish reprimanding him before responding lightly, “Is everyone finished? Then it’s my turn now.”

Wen Zi Shan nodded and said, “We are willing to listen if you have anything to say.”

Yang Kai raised a wicked grin as he sneered, “With the Star Boundary’s terrible situation, it is a great honour for this Junior to have so many Masters sent here to deal with me. However… it is not that this Junior underestimates you all, but do you really believe you can stop me if I want to leave?”

Wen Zi Shan gritted his teeth and shouted, “Yang Kai, wake up!”

Yang Kai spat coldly, “This Junior already decided to shut himself away from the world and live in the mountains and forests with Qing’er, but you all persist in persecuting me again and again. Since that’s the case, this Junior will do as you wish and turn the world upside down! Let’s see who can bear it till the end!”

As he spoke, he flashed and reappeared next to Yu Ru Meng, put his arm around her waist, and let out a low voice, “Go!”

Space Principles fluctuated, and he was about to teleport.

But the next moment, Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed, because the surrounding Space Nodes had all been sealed.

Yang Kai quickly turned his head at once towards a certain direction and growled, “Li Wu Yi!”

A figure in robes as white as snow emerged. It was Li Wu Yi, the only one who could seal the surrounding Space Nodes without anyone realizing it, cutting off Yang Kai’s escape route.

Yu Ru Meng’s face changed slightly as she felt that the situation today was beginning to turn dangerous. With the help of his Space Divine Ability, even if Yang Kai was surrounded by so many Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters, it would be simple for him to escape.

But when Li Wu Yi came out to deal with him in person, the situation changed.

Regarding the attainments in the Dao of Space, Yang Kai and Li Wu Yi were nearly on par with each other. With his greatest card sealed, Yang Kai’s combat power would be greatly reduced.

What could he do now?

When she was still in a panic, she felt a sudden strong force coming from her waist that tossed her aside. At the same time, Yang Kai shouted, “Leave first, I will find you after!”

Yu Ru Meng knew that Yang Kai was desperate and did not want to involve her, so she did not hesitate. With the help of the initial throw, she flitted out of the encirclement, and when she looked back, she saw Emperor Qi rioting violently around Yang Kai as his body was completely entangled in hostility.

Raising his hand, Yang Kai threw a fierce palm toward Xiao Yu Yang.

Space Principles fluctuated, and the space where Xiao Yu Yang stood suddenly collapsed into a black hole that could devour everything around it!

Li Wu Yi’s face changed drastically as he shouted, “Stop!”

The faces of the others paled in shock and quickly rushed to help. Xiao Yu Yang fought hard to resist the force, but this black hole was one of Yang Kai’s Divine Abilities and its effects were almost instantaneous. Xiao Yu Yang had not expected Yang Kai to attack him so suddenly and was caught off guard. There was no time to react at all.

The black hole expanded then contracted rapidly, and by the time it disappeared, the place where Xiao Yu Yang once stood was already empty.

Everyone was dumbfounded.

In the blink of an eye, a Third-Order Emperor was actually killed!

Everyone knew that Yang Kai’s strength could not be judged by his cultivation because his true prowess had always greatly exceeded his realm, but only after a real confrontation with him did they truly discover how terrifying he was.

Cold chills ran up Li Wu Yi’s spine as he turned to Yang Kai with cold eyes and muttered, “You are such a disappointment!”

Yang Kai sneered coldly, “I’ve long wanted to compare notes about the Dao of Space with Senior, but have never been able to do so. It seems today I shall get that opportunity.”

“As you wish!” Li Wu Yi bellowed.

The two pushed their Space Principles wildly, and in the next instant, the surrounding world collapsed as a series of Void Cracks formed. Blood drained from the several Third-Order Emperors present as they all quickly retreated. Countless Void Cracks were now appearing and disappearing randomly, and none of them dared to touch even one.

They looked around and found Yang Kai and Li Wu Yi shuttling back and forth through the Void Cracks, as though they were walking on flat ground, but the battle was so ferocious that it split the sky and cracked the Earth.

Everyone exchanged glances, consciously aware that they were unable to intervene, and could only scatter around and wait for the opportunity to make a move.
