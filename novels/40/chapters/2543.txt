“Moreover, there just happens to be twelve of us here. The opening is only wide enough to accommodate about four people standing side by side. This Qi suggests that we divide into three groups, and each one will take turns defending the cave for a stick of incense’s worth of time, and then switch out again.”

“This will allow each group to rest for about half an hour, which is enough time to recover almost completely.”

“Try to kill the Yin Souls if possible, and block them if not. As soon as the Astral Wind ends, we won’t have to entangle with them any longer. We can escape the cave and thus survive.”

“However, in order for this to happen, we must join hands and trust each other without harboring any other intentions.”

“That is this Qi’s proposal. What does everyone think?” Qi He Feng finished, glancing around at the other cultivators.

The four cultivators defending the cave naturally didn’t have any objections; after all, they had been fighting for so long and wanted nothing more than to rest. As they shouted their agreement and nodded repeatedly, they almost couldn’t resist retreating immediately.

Although it was hard for them to see each other’s expressions, every sensible cultivator inside the cave knew that Qi He Feng was right. The only way to survive and escape this crisis was to join hands and fight together.

Thus, after a moment of silence, someone said, “Brother Qi is right. I agree!”

“Agreed!”

“Agreed!”

One by one, the cultivators nodded and agreed. Before long, a general consensus was reached.

Qi He Feng turned to look at Yang Kai, as though he was seeking his agreement. Yang Kai smiled, “Let’s do as you proposed.”

Qi He Feng turned back with a solemn expression, “Since no one has any objections, let’s begin; however, this Qi will be blunt and say right now that no mistakes can be made during this. If anyone dares to hold back or do anything else that could sabotage us, this Qi, as well as everyone else here, will not show any mercy.”

“As it should be!”

Soon, under Qi He Feng’s guidance, the remaining eight people were divided into two groups.

He seemed to have noticed that Yang Kai, Zhang Ruo Xi, and Old Ban were together, so instead of separating the three, he asked a Second-Order Dao Source Realm Master to join them and take the third shift.

After making the groups, Qi He Feng moved toward the entrance with his group.

The original four cultivators at the entrance quickly retreated and moved out of the way.

Qi He Feng and his group were soon engaged with the Yin Souls, and the fight was in full swing. The original four cultivators pulled out pills and sat down to restore their energy.

They only had half an hour, so they had to make the most of their time.

Qi He Feng’s group cooperated well overall. Under the brilliance of their respective Secret Techniques and artifacts, the Yin Souls were constantly beaten back and killed.

As they watched on, the other cultivators were even more convinced that they had made the right decision to follow Qi He Feng’s proposal.

If they managed to survive this trip, Qi He Feng would undoubtedly be known as a great hero. If he hadn’t stood forth and proposed this plan, the twelve people in the cave would’ve likely turned into scattered skeletons.

Qi He Fen’s group fought nonstop for some time, and although the energy consumption was great, they were able to pull through without falling into danger.

Seeing that their turn was approaching, Yang Kai got up slowly and said in a soft voice, “Old Ban, just hide behind me and deal with the ones that slip through.”

Upon hearing this, Old Ban didn’t say much and only nodded.

As a First-Order Dao Source Realm, he was the weakest in the cave. Moreover, he was old, so he wouldn’t even be able to survive if he had to face ten or twenty Ordinary Ghosts, let alone these Ghost Generals.

He knew how strong Yang Kai was as he could deal with even the Ghost King, let alone its subordinates. There was no need to refuse Yang Kai’s protection.

Yang Kai’s movements seemed leisurely, but it took only an instant for his group to replace Qi He Feng’s.

A brilliant light burst from Zhang Ruo Xi’s hand as extremely rich and pure Spiritual Energy turned into an invisible blade that swept through the entire scene like a divine weapon, cutting down every Yin Soul before her as though they were nothing but straw.

The Second-Order Source Realm Master who was with them turned to look at her in amazement. Only then did he realize how powerful this beautiful girl was, and for a second, he felt both fear and respect. Then, he felt a stab to his self-esteem and clenched his teeth, releasing his Spiritual Energy and fighting to the best of his abilities so as not to be underestimated.

Yang Kai’s performance was not as exaggerated as Zhang Ruo Xi’s, but every time he used his Spiritual Energy, he would inconspicuously eliminate a large area of Yin Souls, most of whom were hidden in the strange fog, so no matter how much noise they made, no one noticed.

Occasionally, he would deliberately let one or two Yin Souls pass for Old Ban to deal with.

It wasn’t for the sake of Old Ban’s self-esteem, but because the other cultivators were working so hard and sincerely that it would seem unreasonable for Old Ban to be doing nothing.

One or two Yin Souls were easy to deal with and didn’t pose any threat.

As soon as Yang Kai took over the defence, the situation changed greatly. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Previously, no matter which group was at the entrance, their vision would be filled with endless Yin Souls. More would appear as they were killed, which made them feel desperate.

But this time, with Zhang Ruo Xi killing at the front and Yang Kai cutting off the Yin Souls’ reinforcements in the rear, the situation at the entrance became much better in just ten breaths of time.

The number of Yin Souls had obviously reduced, giving one the illusion that the disaster would pass soon.

Seeing this, the eight resting cultivators couldn’t help but perk up. It was as though they had seen a glimmer of hope in the fog.

After another stick of incense’s worth of time, without Yang Kai’s having to call out, the first group stood up and stepped forth to replace them.

By now, no one was thinking about their own benefits. Everyone knew that if they wanted to survive, they would have to cooperate with each other.

However, after the first group took over, they discovered that the overwhelming number of Yin Souls had been restored and were quite depressed.

Like this, the twelve people in the cave worked together in an orderly manner, constantly resisting the invasion of the Yin Souls.

A day passed and everyone’s expressions gradually turned sombre. This was because they had discovered that even after an entire day, the Yin Souls showed no intention of retreating, and continued to invade.

Most of the cultivators were injured now, and although no one had suffered fatal injuries, it would become a problem if they weren’t treated soon.

Only Yang Kai’s group of four, because of his secret protection, was still intact.

The reason for the injuries was due to the excessive and long-term consumption of Spiritual Energy. Although they were given time to rest and consumed numerous pills, the fatigue couldn’t be entirely dispelled.

Moreover, there was something even worse; they were running out of the Spirit Pills that could restore Spiritual Energy!

If they ran out of pills, they would no longer be able to replenish their Spiritual Energy, and if the Astral Wind didn’t calm down by then, only death awaited them.

Qi He Feng even took the initiative to distribute his spare Spirit Pills, but it was still just a drop in the bucket and didn’t play a big role.

Half a day later, the situation grew worse.

The atmosphere inside the cave was dark and gloomy, with people constantly shouting and swearing to vent their anger.

Qi He Feng’s brows are furrowed, but he couldn’t think of a way to save the situation.

He could only look at Yang Kai, his eyes full of helplessness.

Yang Kai glanced at him and snorted. Although he felt some displeasure, the situation had reached a point where he could no longer remain uninvolved.

After telling Old Ban and Zhang Ruo Xi to stay where they were, he slowly got up and walked towards the entrance of the cave step by step.

The others looked at him curiously, not knowing what he was going to do.

At the entrance of the cave, Yang Kai took a breath, and with a flick of his wrist, his Myriad Sword appeared and his aura suddenly erupted.

*Weng…*

The entire cave seemed to tremble.

“That’s…”

“An Emperor Realm Master!”

“There was an Emperor here all along?!”

All eyes turned to Yang Kai, who was standing at the entrance. The stalwart back now suddenly had a brave and heroic air about it, and even the group at the entrance stopped and turned around to stare at him.

Although Yang Kai performed well before, he didn’t unleash his full might, and the other cultivators were too worried about their own lives to pay him much heed.

It was only at this moment that they realized Yang Kai was actually an Emperor Realm Master!

No wonder! No wonder the three cultivators in his group were completely unharmed! No wonder every time it was their turn, the number of Yin Souls would become scarce. They’d thought it was strange before but didn’t dwell on it. Now, they understood!

“Haha, we’re saved! We’re saved!”

“Damn, I thought I would die here this time. It seems the Heavens still don’t want me to visit yet.”

“Sir, please hurry and give those Yin Souls a good bashing!”

At this time, everyone was shouting and cheering. They seemed to believe that the Yin Souls would all disappear as long as Yang Kai acted.
