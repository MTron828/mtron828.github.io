This Array Plate was not even worth a fart to Yang Kai, and it was not anything precious to Nanmen Da Jun either, who had only made it for fun.

But it was different for Old Ban and Xiao Ling’er.

Old Ban only had the cultivation of the First-Order Dao Source Realm. It was only normal for him to be startled to see an Array Plate that could capture Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators. In other words, such an Array Plate was enough to kill him a thousand times over.

Furthermore, this Array Plate was also produced by Nanmen Da Jun, so it was definitely of fine quality among other Array Plates, and it would be enough to protect Xiao Ling’er while she grew for a long, long time.

Old Ban could not help feeling terrified, as it was improper to accept such a precious thing, especially when Yang Kai’s and this Grandmaster Nanmen’s relationship was still unclear.

Before he could refuse though, Yang Kai put down the jade pendant and spoke, “Since it was a gift for Xiao Ling’er, she should keep it.”

Nanmen Da Jun was overjoyed when he heard these words, knowing that his strategy was a success.

Old Ban’s expression was complicated when he cupped his fists, “Many thanks, Grandmaster!”

“You’re quite welcome, old man. If you need my help in the future, don’t hesitate to contact me,” Nanmen Da Jun’s attitude took complete charge when he was in a good mood.

Old Ban looked like an honest person, so it was not likely that he would be thick-skinned enough to go to Nanmen Da Jun for favours in the future, and even if he did, helping out a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator was just like lifting a finger for him, so he chose to say those words to leave Yang Kai a good impression.

And his approach was indeed proved effective. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Yang Kai’s previous coldness receded a little as he nodded lightly and commented, “Grandmaster Nanmen is thoughtful.”

Nanmen Da Jun smiled heartily, “I appreciate Young Master Yang’s compliment.”

He breathed a sigh of relief inside, but he also knew that it was not the right time to insist on his requests and did not mention the Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation or the matter regarding the Ancient Wild Lands. He only stood aside and waited quietly, figuring an opportunity would arrive one day.

As he looked around mindlessly to distract himself, Nanmen Da Jun’s gaze soon fell upon a certain Spirit Array.

This was the Ice Lake island, so the Spirit Array here was naturally the Space Array previously built by Yang Kai.

Nanmen Da Jun was too focused on Yang Kai’s attitude when he first arrived here and did not see anything else at all. At this moment, after finally relaxing, Nanmen Da Jun noticed the extraordinary Spirit Array at a glance.

He yelped lightly in surprise and walked towards the Space Array, circling it a few times in interest.

“Ah!” After a short while, Nanmen Da Jun suddenly exclaimed. He seemed to have discovered something extraordinary and his eyes shone with startling brightness. He pounced directly on the Space Array, probing it and inspecting it, only after a long time crying out in shock, “A Cross-Territory Space Array!”

He was somehow able to conclude that this was a Cross-Territory Space Array in a short time.

In an instant, Nanmen Da Jun’s face was flushed with extreme excitement, the glow in his eyes becoming more and more intense as he studied with utmost focus.

At this moment, he was in a world where there was only him and this Cross-Territory Space Array, and nothing else could distract him. From time to time, as if he had encountered difficulties he would frown, only to smile broadly and burst into insane laughter the next moment.

There were only a few Cross-Territory Space Arrays in the entire Star Boundary, and they were all treasures from ancient times, left behind in the Sects created by Great Emperors or similarly powerful forces.

It was even safe to say that there might not be a single functioning Cross-Territory Space Array in the entire Northern Territory.

It was not an exaggeration to say that Cross-Territory Space Arrays were extremely precious in the Star Boundary, so even though Nanmen Da Jun was somewhat famous, he had never had the chance to study one.

Nanmen Da Jun had never expected that he would see one in Ice Heart Valley. This was his luck and also his opportunity. If he could unravel the secrets of this Cross-Territory Space Array, he might be able to replicate it with his skills. By then, it would be a gospel for the entire Star Boundary, and the name Nanmen Da Jun would surely resound throughout the world.

Fame was not what mattered to Nanmen Da Jun of course, but he could die without any regrets if he could break through with the help of this profound array.

There would be fanatics in every profession, and for someone like Nanmen Da Jun, the attraction of a Cross-Territory Space Array was stronger than anything else.

“Wonderful, this is wonderful!” Nanmen Da Jun finally stood up slowly after a long time, exclaiming in admiration. Although no one knew what exactly he saw, the admiration on his face was obvious.

His eyes searched for Yang Kai as soon as he looked up, asking, “Young Master Yang, you are familiar with Ice Heart Valley, do you know who built this thing?”

“What is it?” Yang Kai asked curiously.

Nanmen Da Jun pondered for a moment before explaining, “This Nanmen is certain that this is a Cross-Territory Space Array, and the layout is ingenious, but…”

“But what?” Yang Kai frowned.

“But the technique used to arrange it is somewhat lacking in fluency. It is quite strange; if a person could arrange such an ingenious Spirit Array, their accomplishments in Spirit Arrays should definitely not be too low, undoubtedly a lot higher than this humble one’s. However, why do I feel like even the fundamentals are somewhat unsteady?” Nanmen Da Jun did not even know whether he was explaining to Yang Kai or just talking to himself. After babbling about it for a long time, he shook his head and concluded, “I don’t understand. I really don’t understand it!”

It was no wonder he did not understand.

Although he had good eyesight and recognized the Cross-Territory Space Array, he would never have thought that this array was arranged by Yang Kai.

What he said was right about the idea of this array being ingenious and rare, because the chart and methodology were provided by Yang Yan, but the person who actually arranged it was Yang Kai, who was not proficient in the Dao of Spirit Arrays. He only knew how to arrange this specific Spirit Array, so some of the small details were lacking.

The reason was that when Yang Kai set up the Spirit Array, he only knew the hows but not the whys, essentially just copying what Yang Yan taught him blindly without any personal insights of comprehension.

“What baffled me the most is… This Spirit Array doesn’t seem to be passed down from ancient times, but was actually only arranged recently.” Nanmen Da Jun frowned, then chuckled again, “Maybe I am mistaken.”

Even he did not quite believe this deduction as everyone knew that the array charts required to arrange Cross-Territory Space Arrays had long been lost.

“Grandmaster Nanmen really has sharp vision!”

At this moment, another voice was heard.

Everyone turned their heads to look, only to see a bevvy of young women, each beautiful in her own way, making their way over here. It was a group of Ice Heart Valley Emperor Realm Masters.

The leader was naturally Bing Yun.

Yang Kai, Nanmen Da Jun, and the others hurriedly saluted.

Although Old Ban had never met Bing Yun before, he immediately recognized this charming woman before him was Ice Heart Valley’s Valley Master from hearing Yang Kai’s greetings, so he quickly dragged Xiao Ling’er over and greeted her reverently.

Curiosity flashed across Bing Yun’s eyes, wondering why Yang Kai brought an old man along with him, but she did not ask much and simply stretched out her hand to lift Old Ban up, replying gently, “No need to be polite.”

Glancing at Xiao Ling’er, Bing Yun smiled curiously, “What a bright little girl. Yang Kai, where did you find her?”

Yang Kai chuckled slightly and explained the origins of Old Ban and Xiao Ling’er, after which he requested, “Senior, I want Xiao Ling’er to enter Ice Heart Valley to cultivate as a disciple, would that be acceptable?”

Bing Yun nodded immediately, “I don’t see any problems. The valley happens to have many disciples of similar age. She may cultivate with them in the future.”

Old Ban was overjoyed when he heard these words and urged his granddaughter excitedly, “Hurry up, Ling’er, pay respects to the Valley Master!”

Saying so, he nudged his granddaughter.

The little girl was quite worldly for her age, so she immediately knelt down and called crisply, “Ling’er pays respect to the Valley Master, and to all the Seniors.”

“En, a bright one indeed,” interest flashed across Bing Yun’s eyes as she reached out to pull Ling’er up. She then turned around and gave instructions, “Ying’er, make arrangements for her.”

Zhang Sun Ying stepped out in front of Xiao Ling’er and spoke to her in a low voice, to which Xiao Ling’er kept bobbing her head in response.

After a while, Xiao Ling’er turned around and chirped, “Grandpa, take care, Ling’er will visit you when she is free.”

Old Ban’s eyes were glistening with tears as he resisted the unwillingness to be parted from her in his heart as he waved goodbye, “Go, go. Grandpa will be living in Ice Moon City. Cultivate well and do not cause troubles for your Seniors.”

Xiao Ling’er then turned her head back to the front, walking step by step away from them, her hand held by Zhang Sun Ying.

“Old Ban should be happy that Ling’er has become a disciple of Ice Heart Valley,” Yang Kai comforted him beside him.

“Happy! This Old Man is extremely happy,” Old Ban lifted his sleeves to wipe the corners of his eyes.

With Yang Kai’s guarantee, Old Ban thought it should not be difficult for Ling’er to enter the discipleship of Ice Heart Valley, but he was more grateful than ever that his wish was granted so easily.

“Senior Bing Yun, what did you mean by what you said earlier?”

Nanmen Da Jun, who had held his tongue until now, finally found an opportunity and quickly asked, “Could it be that this Cross-Territory Space Array was really just arranged?”

“You should ask Yang Kai about this matter,” Bing Yun smiled gently, glancing to the side meaningfully.

“What?” Nanmen Da Jun was flabbergasted, gawking at Bing Yun and Yang Kai before asking doubtfully, “Senior means that this Space Array was arranged by Young Master Yang? Senior Bing Yun is not joking with me, right?”

Bing Yun replied, “En, Ice Heart Valley never had such a treasure before. Over a month ago, Yang Kai asked me for a large quantity of Space Spirit Crystals and Space Spirit Jades, and then this appeared.”

Her words were clear, and with Bing Yun’s identity and status, there was no need for her to make tasteless jokes with him, so Nanmen Da Jun’s eyes widened suddenly and he turned a scorching gaze towards Yang Kai. He was lost in his senses for a long time before he exclaimed excitedly, “Young Master Yang… No no no, Grandmaster Yang! Please accept this humble one’s respect!”

Saying so, he fell to the ground with utmost sincerity.

If Nanmen Da Jun had unwillingly bootlicked Yang Kai for some personal desires before, now he was really worshipping Yang Kai. If Yang Kai could arrange a Cross-Territory Space Array, his accomplishments in Spirit Arrays were definitely incomparable to his own!
