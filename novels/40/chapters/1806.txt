Although some herbs medicinal efficacies had passed greatly, there was still a massive number of rare and precious ingredients so it was still not a small gain.

“You’re not hiding anything, are you?” Yang Kai squinted at Lu Gui Chen. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“I wouldn’t dare!” Lu Gui Chen was taken aback and waved his hand quickly. People under the eaves had to lower their heads, so how could he dare deceive Yang Kai here? Lu Gui Chen quickly swore a vow that if he was hiding anything the Heavens should strike him down.

“Good, then there’s nothing more for you to do here, leave,” Yang Kai waved his hand impatiently.

But Lu Gui Chen stood there and didn’t move, looking at Yang Kai expectantly, as if he was hesitant to speak.

“What else is there?”

“Young Hero...that, that, that Source...”

“Is that something you’re qualified to ask about?” Yang Kai’s face sank and the chill from his eyes increased sharply as an invisible burst of Spiritual Energy left his forehead.

Lu Gui Chen instantly took a hard hit as his Knowledge Sea defences were torn apart, causing a splitting headache which made him stagger back and forth as his face paled.

After suffering this blow, Lu Gui Chen was shocked and immediately understood that his previous speculations were true. If Yang Kai really wanted to kill him, it would be as easy as killing a chicken or a dog...

Looking up, there was no trace of Yang Kai in front of him and he had no idea when the latter had even left.

With a wry smile, Lu Gui Chen hurriedly sat down cross-legged and began circulating his Secret Art to heal his injuries.

At a certain spot on the floating continent, atop a beautiful mountain surrounded by clear waters, Yang Kai leisurely appeared.

“The scenery here is quite good, en, this will do,” He muttered to himself before releasing a few Blood Beasts and dispersing them around to stand guard.

Lu Gui Chen was the only one on this floating continent besides him, but Yang Kai could not be certain the former would not come to disturb him rashly, so just in case he released a few Blood Beasts to guard the perimeter.

Next, Yang Kai summoned his Purple Origin Furnace which he always used for Alchemy and began looking through the herbs in his Space Ring.

“What pill should I refine?” Yang Kai’s Divine Sense scanned his Space Ring.

This time, performing Alchemy was mainly to inspire a breakthrough, so it did not really matter what pill he refined, all Yang Kai needed was the act of Alchemy to adjust his mental state.

“Purple Sun Grass, Hundred Leaves Lotus... oh, there’s even a Pure Heart Fruit in here. En, I have all the ingredients necessary for the Enlightenment Pill. After my breakthrough, I can take it to consolidate my realm,” Soon, Yang Kai made a decision.

Seeing that he had all the ingredients to refine the Enlightenment Pill, and it would soon be useful to him, he decided to go with it.

Taking out all kinds of herbs one by one and setting them down beside himself, Yang Kai stretched out his hand and placed it onto his Purple Origin Furnace.

Conflagrated Spiritual Energy instantly poured out, warming the Purple Origin Furnace rapidly.

Each of the herbs was then methodically placed into the pill furnace as Yang Kai adjusted the intensity of his Conflagrated Spiritual Energy to refine them. Yang Kai entered the Alchemic Way after receiving the True Alchemic Way back in the Great Han Dynasty, after which he had been taught a bit by Old Man Li in Tong Xuan Realm. Then, he had inherited the True Alchemy Enlightenment Scripture which contained the most profound Alchemy techniques in the Star Field.

In addition, he had many discussions with Xia Ning Chang on the Alchemic Way, so his accomplishments in Alchemy were not small.

Forming various seals with his hands as he focused his Spiritual Energy into the Purple Origin Furnace, numerous Spirit Arrays were portrayed, destroyed, and replaced in rapid succession. Yang Kai quickly became extremely focused as the rest of the world seemed to fade away as he dedicated himself to his Alchemy.

Even his aura began to meld with the surrounding world, as if he had become one with it.

The process of refining a Spirit Pill was complicated and complex. One could not just condense medicinal liquids and push them together inside a pill furnace.

How much heat to use and when, what kind of Spirit Arrays to portray at what time, what Alchemy methods needed to be applied at which points, every step needed to be executed flawlessly as even a single misstep could lead to failure. Even if one managed to remedy the situation and refine a pill, that pill would always suffer a loss in quality.

Alchemy was a perfect way to focus one’s mind and temper their perseverance.

Yang Kai’s Conflagrated Knowledge Sea gave him a distinct advantage in Alchemy, so the time and energy he required to refine pills was much shorter than ordinary Alchemists.

This was only boosted further by the restorative function of his Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus and his powerful Spiritual Energy. Yang Kai was able to use his Conflagrated Spiritual Energy unscrupulously as a result.

As time passed slowly, a percolating sound began to emerge from the Purple Origin Furnace as the various precious medicinal liquids interacted with one another and underwent miraculous transformations.

A faint medicinal scent began to waft from the furnace, one that was incredibly refreshing, a clear sign the pill had begun to condense.

Yang Kai’s expression became more solemn as he waved his hand and a Blood Beast that had been guarding the perimeter transformed into a Golden Blood Thread and shot back into his hand.

The Golden Blood Thread danced atop Yang Kai’s fingers like a golden-red wisp.

As it danced, the Golden Blood Thread gradually reverted to its golden colour as a red mist was extracted from it.

From this red mist, the roar of a beast rang out as it transformed into the indistinct shape of a Monster Beast.

“Don’t make trouble, using you for Alchemy is the best you could hope for, now behave,” Yang Kai stretched out his hand to catch the red mist and said with a light smile.

The red mist seemed to perceive its peril and not only refused to settle down but resisted even more fervently.

Yang Kai coldly snorted before directly tossing the red mist into the pill furnace.

In the True Alchemy Enlightenment Scripture, it was written that a pill can only become a Spirit Pill if it has spirituality!

Yang Kai spent a long time contemplating this before enlightenment hit him and he was able to comprehend its meaning.

A pill could not obtain a spirit spontaneously unless it was preserved for an extremely long time and placed in an environment with extremely strong spiritual energy. Taking advantage of favourable conditions and an advantageous environment, after hundreds or thousands of years, even a pill could form its own Pill Spirit.

So, since a pill couldn’t form a spirit on its own otherwise, one would need to infuse spirituality into it during its refinement.

The simplest way to achieve this was to use a Monster Beast’s Monster Core as a Pill Spirit!

A Monster Beast’s Monster Core contained the Spiritual Essence of a Monster Beast, which could serve as a Pill Spirit.

Although Yang Kai did not have any High-Grade Monster Cores on hand, he had his Blood Beasts.

Blood Beasts could also be used as Pill Spirits!

In order to refine this Origin King Grade Spirit, a Pill Spirit was indispensable, so Yang Kai could only use one of his Blood Beasts. As a result, the number of Blood Beasts he possessed reduced by one; but compared with the Enlightenment Pill, it was still a bargain.

The blood mist was thrown into the Purple Origin Furnace and, instantly, a phenomenal chain reaction occurred, causing a deep and profound rumbling.

“You still want to resist!” Yang Kai’s expression sank as he quickly formed a new set of seals to suppress the riot.

Worthy of the Soul of a Ninth-Order Monster Beast, it took Yang Kai a few dozen breaths to completely stabilize.

The fragrance filling the air grew more and more intense.

*Dong dong dong...*

At the same time, Yang Kai felt the Saint Qi in his body begin to fluctuate and pulse loudly.

“Is it time?” His eyes flickered, knowing that this kind of movement was an early sign that he had reached the threshold of a breakthrough.

But right now, his Spirit Pill was about to form, so he did not want to give up on it either.

Forming a new set of seals, Yang Kai used the Pill Condensing Technique recorded in the True Alchemy Enlightenment Scripture.

The furnace’s vibrations grew stronger still and it was not until after Yang Kai formed a few hundred seals that they began to die down and instead a rolling, clinking sound emerged from the Purple Origin Furnace.

“Ha!” Yang Kai shouted and slapped his palm onto the Purple Origin Furnace. The next moment, three rays of light shot out from the furnace and fled in three different directions.

“Haha, want to run? In your dreams!” Yang Kai laughed loudly as his figure flickered and he quickly captured all three pills, placing each one into its own pre-prepared jade bottle.

From one set of Alchemy ingredients, he had condensed three pills. This was an accomplishment not seen before in the Star Field.

Even for those famous Alchemy Grandmasters, no matter how superb their techniques were, a single set of ingredients could at most produce a single pill.

But Yang Kai had broken that common sense today.

The ancient Alchemy techniques recorded in the True Alchemy Enlightenment Scripture were utterly amazing.

Perhaps in ancient times, there were peerless geniuses in the Alchemic Way that could also accomplish this, but as time passed, such magical Alchemy techniques had been lost to history, leading to the current situation where Alchemists could only refine one pill per set of ingredients.

*Hong long long...*

High up in the sky, a muffled thunder-like sound suddenly rang out.

Yang Kai looked up and saw dark clouds gathering above his head, like a black night that pressed down on him heavily.

From the black cloud, a terrifying aura of destruction radiated, one that seemed capable of annihilating the floating continent.

This was just the beginning though as a massive amount of aura from the surrounding area poured into the black cloud, constantly increasing its volume.

Yang Kai’s expression grew solemn.

This time, the World Energy baptism he needed to endure to break through to the next Great Realm, from Origin Returning Realm to Origin King Realm, would certainly be different.

After observing for a moment, Yang Kai waved his hand and spread out countless Saint Crystals before sending out a punch.

“Shatter!”

With a rumble, the tens of millions of Saint Crystals exploded into dust and all the energy contained with them flooded the surrounding region.

In the blink of an eye, the richness of the World Energy aura in a ten-kilometre radius around Yang Kai soared upwards.

A large amount of World Energy was needed for this breakthrough, and although the floating continent’s World Energy was quite rich, Yang Kai did not take any chances and had not hesitated to use up millions of Saint Crystals to enhance the environment.

Even after raising the level of the World Energy aura, Yang Kai did not stop.

With another wave of his hand, several hexagonal-shaped stones containing a calm but profound aura were arranged in a circle around his body.

There were a hundred of these stones and each one was giving off a subtle energy field.

Domain Stones!

Many of the Domain Stones Yang Kai possessed were distributed to his close relatives and friends, but he kept a number for himself. Now that he was about to break through to the Origin King Realm, he would not be stingy.

He hoped that by absorbing the energy from these Domain Stones at the same time he broke through, it would enhance his perception and understanding of Domain.

With a single thought, Yang Kai released all his Blood Beasts, along with Xiao Xiao and Liu Yan before issuing them an order, “Spread out and secure the area within thirty kilometres of this spot. If anyone attempts to intrude, kill them!”

Yang Kai made this move mainly to guard against Lu Gui Chen. If that bastard were to interfere with his breakthrough, the consequences would be unimaginable.

The next moment, the Blood Beasts and Stone Puppet scattered, leaving only Liu Yan, who took a moment to look up at the dark clouds in the sky before leaving with a look of fear and worry on her face.

She could perceive how terrifying this World Energy baptism was going to be and knew that, even with her current strength, she would not be able to withstand it easily.
