Usually, a Black Ink Disciple was no different from an ordinary Human, so Yang Kai didn’t need to openly use the Black Ink Strength in his Small Universe to disguise himself. If he did that, he would be exposing a big flaw.

Nevertheless, there was one thing he needed to pay attention to.

The Black Ink Disciples in Great Evolution Theatre had already been cultivating for 30 millennia, so those who had survived had broken through their innate shackles.

In other words, most of these Black Ink Disciples had grotesque deformities. Yang Kai had seen many of these Black Ink Disciples, and all of them had such characteristics.

If he wanted to disguise himself as a Black Ink Disciple, he needed to pay special attention to this.

Fortunately, this was not difficult for him.

As he silently moved the Black Ink Strength in his Small Universe and gathered it on his neck, causing the flesh there to bulge, giving the impression of a tumour.

At the same time, the Black Ink Strength around him became richer and denser.

Anyone who saw this would never imagine he was a normal Human.

Silently calculating the distance between them, Yang Kai crossed the boundary between the two adjacent Black Ink Nest in just two hours, stepping into the adjacent Black Ink Nest’s territory.

Soon after he crossed the boundary, he saw a team of Black Ink Clansmen approaching him. Obviously, they had noticed his intrusion and came to investigate.

Yang Kai didn’t try to avoid them, rather he made a beeline towards them.

The opposite party became a bit vigilant, but after seeing the distant Yang Kai’s appearance, the expression of the Feudal Lord leading the team relaxed.

When both sides met each other, Yang Kai cupped his fist humbly, “Greetings, Sir.”

Although the strength of a Seventh-Order Black Ink Disciple was similar to that of a Feudal Lord, a Black Ink Disciple’s status was still relatively low in the Black Ink Clan, so Yang Kai felt it was not a problem to call this individual ‘Sir’.

The Feudal Lord slightly nodded before curiously asked, “Are you here to collect supplies?”

“Yes, Sir!” Yang Kai answered.

Yang Kai secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

When he was investigating the previous Feudal Lord’s Space Ring, he knew that the Feudal Lord had already gone to many Black Ink Nests; otherwise, there wouldn’t have been so many materials inside.

Yang Kai was really afraid that the Feudal Lord had already been here. In that case, it would definitely be suspicious if another person came to collect supplies so soon after.

By the looks of it, no one had come here to collect supplies yet.

The Feudal Lord asked, a bit confused, “What about Jiu Ka? Wasn’t he responsible for this region?”

The Feudal Lord who was devoured by Blood Crow was apparently called Jiu Ka! The Black Ink Clan had a very weird naming style, it was very archaic, quite different from the Humans of the current era.

They were probably influenced by the Humans of that era.

Yang Kai put on a forced smile as he gave an excuse, “Sir Jiu Ka said he had other matters to attend to, so he asked me to come here in his place…” He then took a pregnant pause before whispering, “Sir also knows how the Old Ancestor is acting, what if…”

He did not finish the sentence. He just assumed a look that said ‘you understand it, right?’

Hearing this, the Feudal Lord sneered, “That guy really knows how to loaf around. Isn’t he afraid of the higher-ups blaming him?”

To be honest, every Black Ink Clansman in the outer ring was afraid of the sudden arrival of the Old Ancestor, and it wasn’t like it had never happened before. Every time the Old Ancestor came, she would annihilate every Black Ink Clansman in her path.

They were setting up a Black Ink Strength defence line, but the hidden truth was that they were also taking a huge risk. Jiu Ka was terrified of the Old Ancestor and didn’t dare to leave the Royal City. So, it was reasonable for him to order a Black Ink Disciple to help perform his duties.

“Follow me,” the Feudal Lord stated before turning around and flying back.

Yang Kai nodded before flying shoulder to shoulder with the Feudal Lord. Meanwhile, he also kept up with pleasantries, praising and thanking the other party for working hard these days.

He was completely acting like a Black Ink Disciples.

The Feudal Lord was also apparently a talkative fellow. Seeing Yang Kai act so familiar, he also began chatting with him.

But Yang Kai only spouted some useless nonsense and didn’t dare try to obtain any information, lest he expose himself.

After walking for a while, the Feudal Lord casually asked, “Which Territory Lord’s Black Ink Disciple are you?”

Warning bells started ringing in Yang Kai’s heart. He didn’t know if the other party was testing him or just asking casually. The sudden question didn’t give him much time to ponder either, so Yang Kai replied in a casual manner, “I am Sir Che Kong’s subordinate.”

Che Kong Territory Lord’s position was quite high in the Black Ink Clan. During the last war between the Great Evolution East-West Army and the Black Ink Clan at the Royal City, Che Kong was made the Army Commander by the Royal Lord, so it made sense for him to have many Black Ink Disciples under him. It was hard to believe that this Feudal Lord out on the outskirts knew all of them.

Even Yang Kai, who had spent so many years in Blue Sky Pass, did not know all the soldiers of Blue Sky Pass. After all, there were too many of them.

If it was true even for him, the same must be true for the Black Ink Clan.

The other party must have casually asked, so as long as he didn’t reveal too many flaws, it shouldn’t be a problem.

But Yang Kai had no idea if this Feudal Lord was familiar with Che Kong or not.

Hearing Yang Kai’s reply, the Feudal Lord couldn’t help but look at Yang Kai, frowning, “You are Sir Che Kong’s Black Ink Disciple? Why have I never seen you before?”

[Is this guy also Che Kong’s subordinate? I’ll be damned!]

Yang Kai secretly cursed his bad luck. Originally, he had thought of using Che Kong’s name, but now it seems that he had just picked a rock and smashed it on his foot.

If this Feudal Lord really was Che Kong’s subordinate, he would definitely recognize the Black Ink Disciples under Che Kong.

Noticing the suspicion in the other party’s eyes getting stronger and stronger, Yang Kai immediately added with a sigh, “I am Sir Che Kong’s subordinate now, but I used to be Sir Zhe Chong’s subordinate!”

Zhe Chong had died in the battle at Great Evolution Pass a long time ago, so there was no one left to verify his identity.

As one of Zhe Chong’s former subordinates, since his Master died in battle, Yang Kai would definitely have to submit to another Territory Lord.

“So you were at Great Evolution Pass?” The Feudal Lord finally found it logical as to why he had never seen this Black Ink Disciple before.

“Indeed,” Yang Kai nodded his affirmation, now finding this Feudal Lord quite annoying. Had he not worried about giving himself out too early, he would have already stabbed his Azure Dragon Spear straight into the Feudal Lord’s mouth.

Yang Kai’s story might have passed preliminary scrutiny, but he kept his guard up, for there was a flaw in his narrative.

As expected, the other party was not a fool, so a frown appeared on the Feudal Lord’s brow as he asked, “When Sir Hong Di led the Army to retreat from Great Evolution Pass, he had an agreement with the Eighth-Order Human Masters at that time. Not only did he have to leave behind his own Black Ink Nest, but he also had to leave all the Seventh-Order Black Ink Disciples behind. How did you make it out of there?”

If Yang Kai had really been at Great Evolution Pass, it would have been impossible for him to appear here.

Yang Kai explained with a sigh, “We tried to break past the Human Army’s blockade to assist the Royal City multiple times, but we never succeeded. During the second battle, I was seriously injured and on the verge of death, so I had no choice but to find a place to conceal myself and stabilize my injuries. It wasn’t until Sir Hong Di retreated from Great Evolution Pass and passed by that I managed to rejoin the Army.”

He was bound to make a slip of the tongue if he kept speaking too much. A single lie would require more lies to cover up. If the Feudal Lord kept questioning Yang Kai, Yang Kai was not sure if he could dispel his doubts.

A look of sadness appeared on his face as he sighed, “We fought many battles at Great Evolution Pass, and lost countless Territory Lords. There, a Seventh-Order Black Ink Disciple like me was just an ant. It’s already a miracle that I survived.”

His words seemed to have touched the other party’s heart, who let out a long, forlorn sigh, “It was the same at the Royal City, even Sir Royal Lord… Forget it, let’s not talk about this anymore. The Humans are still a great threat to my Black Ink Clan, but sooner or later we will wipe them out!”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but nod, “That day will surely come.”

Yank Kai sneered in his heart. Since the Black Ink Clan wanted to exterminate the Humans, why would they let Black Ink Disciples live? The hatred between the two Races was irreconcilable to the point that they had no hope to coexist in this vast universe.

The Feudal Lord remained silent for the rest of the journey.

Yang Kai was more than happy with his situation. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

From the other party’s attitude, it was clear that he didn’t doubt Yang Kai. Now, half of his plan had succeeded, the remaining half would depend on whether he could successfully capture the Black Ink Nest.

A moment later, the Black Ink Clan team arrived before the Black Ink Nest.

The Feudal Lord turned around and exhorted Yang Kai, “Wait here, the supplies are with Mao Bo. I’ll go and bring them to you.”

“Many thanks, Sir!” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Mao Bo seemed to be the name of the Feudal Lord in charge of this Black Ink Nest, the Master of this place.

The leader of the Black Ink Clan team who brought him here was most likely a subordinate of Mao Bo.

After spending some time with the Black Ink Clan, Yang Kai had some understanding of how their hierarchy worked.

There were quite a lot of Feudal Lords under a Territory Lord’s command, ranging from several dozen to 100 or so.

But at most 30 Feudal Lords would have their own Black Ink Nest.

Most of the Feudal Lords did not have their own Black Ink Nest. Under normal circumstances, these Feudal Lords who didn’t have a Black Ink Nest would choose to submit to those who had a Black Ink Nest, which could be regarded as a superior and subordinate relationship, but also a cooperative one.

After all, the Feudal Lords with Black Ink Nest also wanted their territories to become stronger. This way, when they were summoned to fight against the Human Race, not only would they be able to display greater strength, but they would also be able to protect themselves better.

The Master of the first Black Ink Nest occupied by Dawn was called Bo Gao, but there was another Feudal Lord at the Black Ink Nest, who was devoured by Blood Crow.

The situation was very similar to the Black Ink Nest here.

Yang Kai scanned the entire Black Ink Nest with his Divine Sense and found that there were only two Feudal Lords here. One was the one who had brought him back just now, while the other was the one who was in charge of the Black Ink Nest called Mao Bo.

As for the others, they were all High-Rank and Low-Rank Black Ink Clansmen. There were not too many of them either, about 50 in total.

[This will work!]

[It would be even better if Mao Bo came out of the Black Ink Nest.]

While he was pondering, the Black Ink Clan Feudal Lord returned and handed Yang Kai a Space Ring, “These are the supplies.”

Yang Kai took it and pretended to examine it before putting it away.

Presumably, the Black Ink Clan wouldn’t dare to embezzle when it came to this matter.

Cupping his fist, Yang Kai addressed the Feudal Lord, “Many thanks, I’ll head to the next location.”

The Feudal Lord nodded in response.

Yang Kai turned around to leave, but after taking a few steps, he suddenly turned around, slapping his head, “How foolish of me, I forgot to tell you one thing.”

The Feudal Lord asked, “What is it?”

Yang Kai sheepishly looked around before continuing in a low voice, “Sir Territory Lords have found how the Old Ancestor is appearing and disappearing out of thin air. Before coming here, Sir Che Kong ordered me to inform the Feudal Lords about it, so that everyone in the outer ring can carry out a joint investigation to find anything suspicious.”

Hearing this, the Feudal Lord’s eyes lit up after hearing this, “The Territory Lords have already found the reason?”

Over the years, the Black Ink Clan had suffered many losses at the hands of the Old Ancestor, but even now, they still had not figured out how she was able to come and go like a ghost.

This was not only a thorn in Royal Lord and Territory Lords’ hearts, but also a source of extreme fear for the outer ring Feudal Lords.

If they could at least figure this out, they would be much less afraid of the Humans.
