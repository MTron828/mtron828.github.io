It was clear that the middle-aged man from Eight Paths Sect was trying to resolve the problem peacefully with money. Although the Qin Family was no match for Eight Paths Sect in terms of strength, the latter were ultimately the party at fault here, so the middle-aged man did not want to further complicate the matter and avoid the spread of rumours which might mar their reputation.

Qin Zhao Yang was keeping quiet, and no one knew what was on his mind, but just by looking at him, everyone could see that his eyes were filled with unwillingness and anger. He stood there with his fists clenched so hard that the cracking sound of his bones could be heard.

Even seeing this, Lin Yun continued to mock him with a smug face, “Old Patriarch Qin, you better consider this carefully. One wrong decision will be enough to cost the small Qin Family... “

He sounded gruesome, and his words were full of threat.

At that moment, a voice suddenly came from outside, “A human life... costs just two hundred thousand Source Crystal? Ahem ahem... Just how cheaply do you value life?”

This person coughed softly while speaking, as if they had some serious illness.

“Who’s there!?” Lin Yun was maddened and hurriedly turned to yell in the direction of the voice.

Qin Yu was slowly walking over with the help of Hui’er from that side. She looked pale and fragile, like a small flower beaten by the storm, making everyone instinctually want to protect her.

Lin Yun was dazzled, his eyes lighting up as he gazed at Qin Yu with excitement.

Qin Yu was a beauty, and her current illness added a morbid sense of elegance to her continence, bewitching Lin Yun’s soul, causing him to lust after her.

Just as the middle-aged man said, Lin Yun was obsessed with women. It had been almost two months since he came to Maplewood City and he had been staying in the Qin Residence all this time, finally losing control of his impulses and trying to take advantage of the two maidservants today. If it were not for him, this mess would not have happened.

But when he saw Qin Yu, he instantly regretted his actions. He could not believe that he actually had the thoughts of laying his hands on plain women like those maids which would have only brought disgrace to his status.

[Even if I should have any thoughts, it should be about this woman in front of me!]

“Yu’er!” Qin Zhao Yang’s expression changed dramatically as he rushed over to Qin Yu. Supporting her by her side, he quickly reprimanded, “Why did you come out? Didn’t Old Ancestor ask you to rest well?”

Qin Yu forced a smile, “I felt like something bad was about to happen... I was worried, so I came to see.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

During the conversation, she took a glance at the maidservant’s corpse. Seeing her terrible condition, Qin Yu’s already pale face turned even paler.

“This Young Lady...” Lin Yun smiled brilliantly and began speaking in a voice laced with suave. When he was about to greet Qin Yu, however, the middle-aged man glared fiercely at him and snapped, “Stand back! Don’t you think you’ve caused enough trouble already?!”

Lin Yu was seemingly afraid of this middle-aged man, so after being reprimanded, he kept his mouth shut, looking embarrassed.

Several other disciples from Eight Paths Sect also could not tolerate his behaviour and glared at him with a reproachful look, blaming him for not being able to restrain himself.

“This must be Young Lady Qin Yu,” the middle-aged man cupped his fist and greeted Qin Yu with a faint smile.

“Does Senior know me?” Qin Yu coughed lightly and looked at him with her watery eyes.

The middle-aged man smiled lightly, “When I was inquiring about the news in the city, I heard many stories about the amazing Young Lady of the Qin Family. Seeing you today, it’s clear your reputation is not undeserved.”

It was not common for a lady, who merely had an Origin Returning Realm cultivation and whose vitality was pitifully low due to some unknown severe illness, to actually face and talk freely to a person with the cultivation at the Second-Order Dao Source Realm like him.

The middle-aged man could not see the slightest panic or fear in Qin Yu’s eyes.

More importantly, the middle-aged man sensed that Qin Yu’s lifespan would be up soon, but she still looked calm and composed, as if completely unafraid. One had to know that even old masters who had lived for hundreds of years and had seen great storms in their life may not be able to carry themselves with such poise when their end was approaching.

The middle-aged man could not help but gaze at her again in amazement.

“What Young Lady Yu meant just now... was that our offer was too low?” Even though the middle-aged man thought that Qin Yu was extraordinary, he still did not take her seriously; after all, she was just an Origin Returning Realm Cultivator, and also just a Young Lady from a small family. She could catch his eyes for a bit, but to him, she did not deserve to be treated specially, so after some pleasantries, he went straight back into the topic and continued with his smile, “If so, Young Lady Yu, please offer us your price. We, Eight Paths Sect, are not some great Sect, but we still can afford some Source Crystals.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu responded coldly, “Do you think this is a business deal to be bartered and bargained over?”

The middle-aged man looked embarrassed and forced a smile, “Young Lady Yu, what you mean is... “

“Life is priceless!” Qin Yu shouted.

The middle-aged man narrowed his eyes and in a much colder tone than before, he asked “Please speak clearly, Young Lady Yu. I’m afraid I don’t understand your meaning here.”

He had gradually lost his patience. Even though the issue was indeed caused by Lin Yun, he was still a Second-Order Dao Source Realm Master and had already lowered his status and showed much respect to them, hoping that they would accept his courtesy and give everyone a way out.

However, not only was the Old Ancestors of this Qin Family acting stubborn, even this Junior was reluctant to let this matter drop, which of course annoyed him greatly.

Despite the massive gap between their strengths, the middle-aged man still gave them massive face by negotiating with them politely, but their persistent decline of his offer had made him feel humiliated instead.

“A life for a life, that is the principle of Heaven and Earth!” Qin Yu declared.

“What?” The middle-aged man’s face changed. He really did not expect Qin Yu to make such a ridiculous request.

Lin Yun jumped up in shock and snapped, “Woman, are you crazy? How dare you ask for the life of this Young Master? How can you even compare the life of a single piece of trash with this Young Master’s life? Do you have some kind of death wish?”

“Watch your mouth, you bastard!” Qin Zhao Yang burst out with anger and cursed him when he heard that this good for nothing actually dared to insult Qin Yu.

Lin Yu laughed with overwhelming anger as he kept nodding his head, “Good, good, good, everyone in this small family has guts! Today, this Young Master shall teach you some proper manners!”

He released his Source Qi while speaking, getting ready to attack.

“Fool!” The middle-aged man suddenly burst out at Lin Yun as he ground his teeth and shouted, “What do you think you’re doing?”

Lin Yun was dumbfounded and pointed at Qin Zhao Yang and Qin Yu, “You heard them, right? Isn’t it obvious what I’m going to do?!”

The middle-aged man’s face darkened as he sent his voice directly into Lin Yun’s ear, “Killing them is easy, and even if bad rumours spread out, our Sect will just lose some reputation at most. It’s impossible for anyone to stand up for this small family and disturb our Eight Paths Sect.”

“Then what are you worried about?” Lin Yun was confused. He did not understand why the middle-aged man stopped him.

“Are you trying to alarm ‘that’ person? Do you know what would happen to you if you alarmed him for something like this?” The middle-aged man looked at him coldly.

Lin Yun’s expression changed after hearing this. ‘That’ person the middle-aged man mentioned seemed to be a terrifying existence to Lin Yun and his face quickly turned pale just hearing about him, causing his Source Qi to completely deflate.

This scene was imprinted into the eyes of Qin Yu and Qin Zhao Yang. They did not know what kind of secret conversation was held between the two of Eight Paths Sect disciples, but they were surprised that it actually caused the flames of Lin Yun’s anger to be doused.

The middle-aged man turned back to Qin Yu, cupped his fists, and said, “Young Lady Yu, regarding your last proposal, I’ll pretend I did not hear that. Please ask something else!”

Qin Yu coughed a few times lightly, “I understand that with the strength of our Qin Family, we cannot make you pay with your life... “

“Young Lady Yu understands well,” The middle-aged man praised Qin Yu’s wit with a faint smile.

Qin Yu instantly continued, “Although we are incapable of avenging Xiao Huan, she was still a servant of our Qin Family, and we can’t just let her die unreasonably. As a matter of course, we can’t continue to entertain her enemies in the Qin Residence anymore. All of you... leave!”

Everyone from Eight Paths Sect was stunned at her words, staring at Qin Yu with bulging eyes and funny faces.

The middle-aged man let out a dry cough after a long silence, “What Young Lady Yu just said... do you mean?”

Qin Yu answered, “Am I still not clear enough for you? We, the Qin Family, no longer welcome you here. What’s more, we will not forget this grudge and will one day avenge Xiao Huan’s death.”

She looked straight into his eyes while speaking, with no intention to set her gaze aside.

The face of the middle-aged man was getting colder and colder, while the other disciples of Eight Paths Sect did not look much better.

A breeze swept through the courtyard, and the bloody stench in the air became even stronger.

The middle-aged man stared at Qin Yu with his sharp eyes. After remaining silent for a long time, he responded, “Young Lady Yu... Are you serious?”

The corner of his mouth twitched as he spoke, seemingly not having expected things to develop to this point.

If they were really being kicked out from the Qin Residence by Qin Yu, where would the dignity of Eight Paths Sect be? More importantly, if they were driven away like this, this matter would definitely alarm ‘the’ person that he feared the most. When that person demanded an explanation, what was he supposed to say?

He certainly could not disclose this matter to that person, about how Lin Yun accidentally killed a maidservant of another family but they could not take revenge so they wanted to expel Eight Paths Sect from their residence...

If he really said so, he was sure that neither he nor Lin Yun would have good ends.

That person... was not easy to deal with.

“Do I look like I’m joking to you?” Qin Yu gently bit her red lips, refusing to budge.

The middle-aged man unexpectedly closed his eyes and spoke slowly, “Young Lady Yu, can you make an exception for this? We can’t leave the Qin Residence yet for reasons I cannot share!”

Without waiting for Qin Yu’s response, he immediately raised his finger in the sky and shouted, “One million of Source Crystals! Okay?”

After the shout, Lin Yun and the others changed their faces drastically, their voices cracked, “Senior Brother, are you serious?”

One million of Source Crystals was not a small number. Even though this number was within their capability, Eight Paths Sect was not a big Sect and it would still be a burden to them, so if it were not a last resort, they would be unwilling to pay for so much.

Thinking of this, Lin Yun exclaimed, “What’s done is already done, don’t keep harping on and on about a mere slave. Like it or not, we will give you one million Source Crystals but we will not leave the Qin Residence. If you have the strength to refuse, you’re free to come take revenge on me anytime!”
