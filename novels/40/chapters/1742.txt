According to the Union’s laws, the typical punishment would be execution to serve as a warning to others, or else to abolish her cultivation and expel her from Sword Union. As for He Zao and He Miao, they would likely degenerate into servants.

At the last moment though, an Elder from Sword Union named Qin Wu Hui had spoken on their behalf and saved their lives and status.

Qin Wu Hui was a master who followed Gu Jian Xin, and as such, Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Miao became indirectly connected to Gu Jian Xin.

Qin Wu Hui was a good-natured person, and even after speaking up to defend Yue Xi and her disciples, he had not tried to threaten or abuse them in any way. In fact, he had taken care of the Master and Disciples over the years, causing the latter to be extremely grateful to him.

However, Qin Wu Hui had a prodigal son named Qin Qi Yang. This boy relied on his father’s prestige to run rampant on Sword Union’s Home Star. Although it could not be said he was completely lawless, he was certainly not a good thing either.

Qin Wu Hui accompanied and assisted Gu Jian Xin almost all the time and neglected to discipline his own son, simply allowing matters to drift.

On Sword Union’s Home Star, however, there were many people of high status and strength, and one day, Qin Qi Yang provoked an opponent he should not have. After falling into a trap, although he fought fiercely and managed to preserve his life, Qin Yi Yang suffered a serious wound to his Soul which essentially turned him into a fool.

Although his son had always been a good-for-nothing, he was still his son, in the end. When Qin Qi Yang degenerated into an idiot, Qin Wu Hui was extremely distressed, but surprisingly, his boy became much better behaved after the incident and no longer showed any of his previous delinquent tendencies.

After many years, Qin Wu Hui was now thinking about finding a marriage partner for his son so he could produce a few heirs.

But who would want to marry Qin Qi Yang, who had become a fool? Coupled with his previous miscreant reputation, no woman of status would be willing to marry him.

Qin Wu Hui’s status was not low, so he disdained to arrange a marriage with some ordinary women for his son.

Out of desperation, Qin Wu Hui could only target the two sisters He Zao and He Miao. Obviously, as long as either of the sisters could marry Qin Qi Yang and give birth to an heir for him, it would alleviate Qin Wu Hui’s concerns.

For this purpose, Qin Wu Hui even prepared a very generous amount of compensation!

He did not go directly to Yue Xi to discuss this matter though and instead reported it to Gu Jian Xin directly.

In a sense, this approach was quite despicable. Qin Wu Hui also agonized over the matter for a long time before ultimately deciding to put aside his face and act.

Qin Wu Hui had followed Gu Jian Xin for many years and was both hardworking and loyal. Now, he simply wanted to arrange a marriage for his son to extend his bloodline, so how could Gu Jian Xin refuse? After receiving this request, Gu Jian Xin directly summoned Yue Xi and told her to discuss with He Zao and He Miao about which of them would marry Qin Qi Yang.

With Gu Jian Xin interceding, there was simply no room for Yue Xi to manoeuvre.

For more than a year, Yue Xi had been stalling, and since Qin Wu Hui also knew that his actions were somewhat dishonourable, he did not try to urge her.

However, procrastination was not a solution. One day, either He Zao or He Miao would be forced to accept.

Yang Kai’s appearance gave Yue Xi hope! She couldn’t ask Gu Jian Xin to break off this affair, and Qin Wu Hui had treated the three of them quite kindly, so refusing was not an option, but Yang Kai was different. Yang Kai was not from Sword Union and it was obvious that Gu Jian Xin wanted to make friends with him, so perhaps just a few words would be enough to solve the tragic future of the two sisters.

Because of this consideration, Yue Xi had secretly visited Yang Kai to ask him to speak on their behalf.

After listening, Yang Kai nodded gently, “So that’s the situation!”

He somewhat understood what He Zao wanted to say before she left. It was likely she wanted to ask for help but was too embarrassed to speak of it.

“Young Master Yang, can you please show compassion and save those two girls? The two of them have lived a tragic life with no father or mother. This Mistress raised them both from infancy till now, treating them as my daughters and really cannot bear to see them forced into this fiery pit!” Yue Xi pleaded as she sobbed, “Senior Qin has been very kind to us, and if he wanted this Mistress to repay him in any other way, this Mistress would certainly not refuse, but this is about the future of those two girls, so this Mistress really cannot agree.”

“En, this matter is not your fault,” Yang Kai’s speech became milder. When he heard her request before, Yang Kai had misunderstood slightly, but after listening to Yue Xi’s explanation, he understood that this matter was truly beyond her ability to handle.

With Gu Jian Xin having spoken, how was she supposed to resist?

For Gu Jian Xin, satisfying Qin Wu Hui’s wishes was naturally the priority; after all, he was not familiar with He Zao or He Miao. What’s more, Qin Wu Hui had prepared plenty of compensation for them. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

With his identity as a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master, the compensation he came up with was surely extremely generous. For an ordinary woman, marrying into the Qin Family was akin to flying from the branch to become a phoenix.

It could even be said that Gu Jian Xin was being a bit inconsiderate in regards to this matter, but with his position and status, his decision was actually quite reasonable.

However, inserting himself into this kind of matter rashly also seemed inappropriate, causing Yang Kai to frown.

“Young Master Yang...” Seeing Yang Kai tapping his finger on the table, Yue Xi remained silent as long as she could, before she finally couldn’t help saying. “If Young Master Yang can let Young Union Master cancel this marriage, this Mistress swears that even if she must die the cruellest of deaths she will find a way to repay you.”

“There’s no need to act so seriously,” Yang Kai waved his hand. “It’s just that if I really come forward to resolve this matter, what do you plan to do in the future?”

Yue Xi was dumbfounded when she heard these words and was unable to react for a moment.

“Let me put it this way; you owe that Qin Wu Hui a great debt of kindness, so if this matter is truly resolved by me, then you three Master and Disciples will certainly bear the reputation of ingratitude. How do you plan on maintaining a foothold in Sword Union in the future under such circumstances?”

Not everyone knew or cared for the truth, and many only saw what was on the surface. What Yang Kai said was something that would transpire.

Irrelevant cultivators would definitely feel that Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao were repaying kindness with scorn...

“This...” Yue Xi thought about the cold glares and whispers behind her back she and her Disciples would need to endure from the people of Sword Union in the future and could not help shivering. Suddenly, she seemed to think of something, grit her teeth, and declared, “If Young Master Yang does not object, he might as well directly ask Young Union Master for those two girls directly. They only have Third-Order Saint King cultivations, so the Young Union Master will not refuse you. In the future, even if you take them as maids or concubines it won’t matter.”

“Are you serious?” Yang Kai was startled.

Yue Xi smiled, “This Mistress can see that those two girls have favourable impressions of Young Master Yang, so I am sure they will not reject you. After all, Young Master Yang is a dragon among men like Young Union Master.”

“You’re their Honoured Master, how...” Yang Kai’s face twitched visibly.

“Then Young Master Yang, this matter...” Yue Xi looked at Yang Kai nervously. Before getting Yang Kai’s exact answer, she could not rest assured.

“This matter isn’t so easy to manage,” Yang Kai frowned.

Yue Xi’s heart sank.

“First, tell me what that Qin Qi Yang’s exact situation is, and who is Qin Wu Hui precisely. What is his character like, and what is his status within Gu Jian Xin’s ranks?”

.....

After half an hour, Yue Xi left Yang Kai’s room and the sorrow which had adorned her brow for the past year had disappeared. Even her footsteps seemed to have become much lighter. Obviously, she received a positive answer.

For the next two days, the Starship sailed towards Azure Tree Star without any more surprises.

Yang Kai cultivated quietly in his room while also taking the time to refine a furnace of pills.

Two days later, a knock sounded from the door.

After receiving Yang Kai’s permission, the door opened and the He Zao, He Miao sisters walked in.

“Big Brother Yang, Young Union Master has arranged a banquet. We’ve been instructed to invite Big Brother Yang,” He Zao said.

“Okay,” Yang Kai nodded and stood up. “Lead the way ahead.”

“This way please!” He Zao and He Miao immediately walked ahead.

After a quick walk through the Starship’s corridors, the trio arrived at a magnificent hall. Inside this hall were a number of cultivators sitting in two rows at a giant table with food and wine arranged in front of them.

Gu Jian Xin sat at the head position with a ruddy complexion and his Left and Right Sword Servants standing behind him.

It seems that after a few days of meditation, Gu Jian Xin had essentially restored himself.

Seeing Yang Kai enter, Gu Jian Xin immediately got up and greeted him with a smile. The other cultivators present also quickly stood up and cupped their fists.

Many of them only knew about Yang Kai’s existence and that he was the one who had slain Li Ming Hai a few days ago, but had actually not greeted him personally. Seeing even Gu Jian Xin greet this young man so enthusiastically though, none of them dared show a lack of courtesy.

Yang Kai did not lack etiquette either and cupped his fists to those in the hall with a smile on his face. Seeing the relaxed and friendly smile on Yang Kai’s face gave the Origin Returning Realm masters present a good impression, feeling that he was powerful but not arrogant. Everyone understood why their Young Union Master had taken an interest in him.

“Brother Yang, over here!” Gu Jian Xin beckoned.

He Zao and He Miao led Yang Kai to the head of the table where a seat was prepared just below Gu Jian Xin’s before they withdrew a step and stood respectfully.

After Yang Kai took his seat, Gu Jian Xin smiled heartily, “Brother Yang, this Gu has been recovering these past few days and been negligent in his duties as a host. I hope Brother Yang will not take offence.”

“Brother Gu is too serious, healing should naturally be a priority,” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

“Many thanks for your understanding, Brother Yang! Today’s banquet is just a small event to thank Brother Yang for his saving grace. Without you, Ling Yue, An Xing, and I would have fallen to old dog Li’s wicked scheme. From now on, Brother Yang is this Gu’s friend and benefactor!”

Many Origin Realm masters sitting below had a sharp light flash across their eyes.

Gu Jian Xin was a bold and free spirit, but he would never easily utter the word ‘friend’.

Now that he had spoken so, it meant he was determined to forge a friendly relationship with Yang Kai.

Moreover, after the word ‘friend’, Gu Jian Xin even went so far as to add the title of ‘benefactor’. These Origin Realm masters naturally understood what this implied.

“This glass is to show my respect for Brother Yang!” Gu Jian Xin drank his full glass in one go.

He Zao immediately stepped forward and filled Yang Kai’s wine glass before stepping back while still holding the pitcher, fulfilling the role of a maid diligently.

Yang Kai picked up his glass and said with a smile, “With Brother Gu being so straightforward, this Yang won’t stand on ceremony.”

Raising his glass, Yang Kai also drank it down.

“Good, no one will leave here sober today!” Gu Jian Xin laughed.

Music played and some young girls walked in from outside the hall one by one and began to sing and dance while waiters carried in a rich assortment of delicacies.

The entire hall instantly became lively.
