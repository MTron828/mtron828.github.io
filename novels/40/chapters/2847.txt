As he thought, Shaman Dang summoned him because of the Giant Eagles; it was obvious that King City wanted to take a share from him too.

Yang Kai and the other Shaman Grandmasters who wanted some Giant Eagles from him shared equal status; therefore, Yang Kai could refuse them without hesitation, and even dared to beat them up if they persisted. But if King City requested them, Yang Kai would be stuck as he could not disobey his superior.

[That is too shameless!]

“Sir, a few days ago, I noticed the presence of the Aerial Cavalry in King City. My Giant Eagles are Barbarian Beasts from the mountains that are not subject to domestication. I’m afraid that they can’t be of any use.”

Shaman Dang smiled, “There is indeed some Aerial Cavalry in King City, but not many of them. It is difficult to tame Flying Barbarian Beasts, so this King was also quite surprised you were able to tame so many of them at once.”

Yang Kai immediately responded, “I put in a lot of effort and spewed several litres of blood for it. I almost died there.”

Shaman Dang pressed on, “That’s why King City won’t take your Giant Eagles for nothing!”

Yang Kai suddenly became interested, his eyes lighting up as he questioned, “Then may this subordinate know how many Giant Eagles King City wants, and what price you are willing to pay for them?”

Since he could not reject King City, he could only try to minimize the loss. If King City wanted a few Giant Eagles, they had to show their sincerity; after all, Yang Kai’s Giant Eagles did not just appear out of thin air.

Shaman Dang answered with a solemn face, “I wish for half. You may name your price!”

As soon as he made this remark Yang Kai jumped up from his chair like a cat with its tail trampled on and furiously shouted, “Half!? Sir, why don’t you just rob me? I might as well give you all the Giant Eagles!”

His sudden movement startled the Guard Captain who immediately pulled out his weapon and stared at Yang Kai vigilantly.

Shaman Dang reached out his hand and patted Yang Kay on the shoulder with a smile, “Since you are so kind, then this King will accept it with much appreciation.”

Yang Kai looked at him dumbfounded, his face twitching, “Sir, I have a question.”

“Ask!” Shaman Dang raised his eyebrows.

“Do you not have shame?”

Shaman Dang beamed, “That’s why this King asked you to name your price!”

Yang Kai was truly surprised that Shaman Dang did not care about his rudeness and immediately felt that this Shaman King was an incredible character.

Yang Kai fell silent for a while before continuing, “Twenty-five for you, while I keep fifty for myself. Fifty should be still enough to change the tide in small-scale fights, so I can’t have less than that. On the other hand, King City probably wants Giant Eagles for scouting and investigation rather than combat, am I right?”

Without denying, Shaman Dang nodded, “Indeed!”

“Then, that’s fine. twenty-five Giant Eagles on top of the Aerial Cavalry owned by the King City are enough for such purposes.”

Shaman Dang wanted to negotiate, but Yang Kai stopped him, “Twenty-five. This is my limit.”

“Fine! Twenty-five then. This King won’t force you.” Shaman Dang nodded readily, obviously having prepared himself from the start. He then looked up and asked, “So, what is your price?”

Yang Kai immediately responded, “Equip each of my subordinates with a set of Battle Armour!”

Shaman Dang only looked at him with a strange expression.

Yang Kai scratched his face and continued, “Fine fine, a thousand sets of Battle Armours shouldn’t be too much, I assume?”

Shaman Dang shook his head, “King City can’t even take out a hundred sets now, let alone a thousand sets.”

“Why is King City so poor?” Yang Kai was taken aback.

“King City is not poor,” Shaman Dang smiled helplessly, “But the materials in the city have almost all been bought out by those Shaman Grandmasters. If you want to know why, you are the one who started it. You equipped three thousand people with weapons all at once, so how could the other Grandmasters not show some sincerity? Although they don’t have huge financial resources like you, how many things are there in the city for them to grab even if each of them just purchased a little?”

“Sounds reasonable,” Yang nodded and believed that Shaman Dang was not deceiving him. It was true that many Ancient Barbarians had appeared with new weapons and Battle Armours outside the city during these few days. Obviously, they were bought by the Shaman Grandmasters themselves.

But they could not fully equip all their clansmen, so they could only give priority to a small number of elites.

“Don’t mention any more about materials. I don’t have them to help you.”

Yang Kai thought for a moment and continued, “If materials are out of the question, give me more manpower then.”

Shaman Dang narrowed his eyes, “What kind of manpower do you want?”

Yang Kai grinned, “My group lacks Shaman Masters. Could Sir appoint some Shaman Masters under me!?”

“How many?”

“Five!” Yang Kai smiled lightly, “Five Giant Eagles for each Shaman Master. It’s a good deal, Sir!”

“Five are too many. I can only give you one Shaman Master!”

“What kind of Shaman Master is so valuable?” Yang Kai was amazed, “Sir, can you show some sincerity?”

Shaman Dang snorted coldly, “Then do you think you’re being sincere by asking for five Shaman Masters?”

Yang Kai replied frankly, “Everyone wants to gain the most in every deal. Business is just like this…”

“Two at most. That is this King’s limit. If you don’t accept, forget about it and leave.”

“How can I not accept?” Yang Kai hurriedly continued, “Two then. How can I reject Sir Shaman King?”

Shaman Dang pointed his finger at Yang Kai, wanting to rebuke him, but did not know how to start. After letting out a sigh, he turned to the Guard Captain and ordered, “Bring in Yue and Lu.”

The Guard Captain obviously was surprised by the order, but accepted it and went out without saying a word.

After waiting for a while in the main hall, footsteps drew nearer to the door.

Not long after, the Guard Captain led two young girls in. Yang Kai looked up, and his eyes lit up at the sight.

Although he vaguely guessed that Yue and Lu were girls, he did not expect that these two would be so gorgeous. Compared with other Ancient Barbarians, they were exceptionally beautiful with tall and ideal feminine figures.

The most important thing was the two girls looked exactly the same. They were clearly twins.

Yang Kai was dumbstruck.

The number of Shamans in the Ancient Barbarian Race had always been scarce, because only those who have been favoured by the Barbarian Gods were able to cultivate Shaman Strength. It was already impressive to have one Shaman Apprentice in a small village; however, it was even rarer for twins to both be Shamans. Moreover, they were Shaman Masters.

By the look of their young appearances, they did not seem to be older than Tiea by a lot, so they definitely had bright futures.

Being stared at by Yang Kai, both of them revealed a cold look and did not bother to glance back at him, simply stepping forward and greeting in unison, “Sir, did you summon us?”

Their voices sounded almost the same, and there were no differences in their intonation. If an uninformed person heard their voices, he would think they were from the same person.

“Heart Resonance?” Yang raised his brow and looked at them with his eyes blazing.

Although twins could connect with each other relatively easily, Heart Resonance was a whole different matter. By reaching this state, the twins would double their efficiency in anything they did, and if they worked together to cast Shamanic Spells, the power they could display would far exceed their current Realm.

In other words, although Yue and Lu were just Shaman Masters, once they joined hands, an ordinary Shaman Grandmaster may not be able to contend with them.

[What a steal!] Yang Kai was overjoyed to have picked up such a treasure. Initially, he just wanted two Shaman Masters to fill the gaps in his forces, but he did not expect that Shaman Dang would send such a pair of Shaman Masters to him.

Shaman Dang nodded and looked at Yue and Lu with some tenderness and love flashing across his eyes.

Yang Kai secretly felt that something was wrong, wondering if these two girls belonged to Shaman Dang. If so, he was worried that they would purposely give him trouble in the future after he took them under his wings.

Just when he was worried though, Shaman Dang announced, “From now on, you two will follow Shaman Niu. Listen to his orders, and don’t disobey him!”

When Yue and Lu heard this, they turned their heads and glanced at Yang Kai, then saluted with their hands on the chest in unison, “Greetings, Shaman Niu!”

Their tone was flat, and it did not seem like these two Shaman Masters were showing much respect towards a Shaman Grandmaster.

Yang Kai still posed like a Senior expert though and nodded, “You don’t need to be so polite.”

Shaman Dang smiled lightly, “Yue and Lu have been living and cultivating in the Shaman Divine Temple since they were young and only just returned to King City a few days ago, so they have not had much experience in the outside world yet. Since they follow you now, you can discipline them as you like. If they don’t listen to your orders, you can punish them at will.”

“The Shaman Divine Temple…” Yang Kai’s face turned solemn.

The Shaman Divine Temple was a symbol of the entire Ancient Barbarian Race. Inside, there was the statue of the Shaman God, and only the most outstanding Shamans of various Clans were qualified to enter its doors to cultivate and serve the deities.

In general, the Shamans who came from the Shaman Divine Temple acquired exquisite Shamanic Spells and possessed superior strength. They were basically invincible in their own Realm.

Yang Kai inherited Senior Qing’s knowledge, so he also knew how important the Shaman Divine Temple was to the Ancient Barbarian Race.

He used to think that if he had a chance, he would visit the Shaman Divine Temple to see whether he could learn something.

Nevertheless, he had abandoned such thoughts because of the invasion of the Demon Race. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

But he did not expect that two Shaman Masters from the Shaman Divine Temple would be standing in front of him now.

No wonder Yue and Lu had reached this Realm of cultivation at such a young age. Since they could enter the Shaman Divine Temple, there was no doubt that Yue and Lu were Shamans who had the highest aptitude in the whole South Barbarian Clan.

Shaman Dang continued with a smile, “With your aptitude, you can enter the Shaman Divine Temple too without any trouble. So… Stay alive, Shaman Niu. The truly powerful Shamanic Spells can only be learnt in the Shaman Divine Temple. If you want to enjoy its greatness, you have to grow stronger and survive through the war!”

Yang Kai responded solemnly, “Yes, this subordinate will follow Sir’s instructions!”

“En, dismissed.” Shaman Dang waved his hand and spoke no more.

Yang Kai held his fist to his chest before withdrawing.

Before Yue and Lu left, they looked at Shaman Dang longingly and said in unison, “Take care, Sir!”

Shaman Dang nodded gently. Then, Yue and Lu turned around and walked out of the hall.

Leaving only Shaman Dang and the Guard Captain in the hall.

“Sir, he’s just a Shaman Grandmaster. Why did you give Yue and Lu to him?” The Guard Captain looked at Shaman Dang in bewilderment. He was obviously troubled by Shaman Dang’s decision. Yang Kai only wanted two Shaman Masters, and although there were not many Shaman Masters in King City, there were still some left. Shaman Dang could have simply chosen two at random, but he actually gave Yue and Lu to Yang Kai instead.
