Yang Kai shook his head, “It’s useless to tell me this. Elder Tan, please tell Hua Qing Si directly. Since this Spirit Array is controlled by you, you should be able to contact her, right?”

Tan Jun Hao frowned and looked slightly impatient, “Little Friend Yang, please forgive this Old Master for not being able to accept this request.”

“Why?” Yang Kai furrowed his brow.

Tan Jun Hao explained, “Right now, room one is isolated from this Old Master’s Spirit Array and no longer under this Old Master’s control. This Old Master’s voice cannot be transmitted there.”

He could have done it earlier before Gong Tai interfered in the array and isolated room one from his control.

The capabilities of a Spirit Array Grandmaster were no joke.

“Is that true?” Yang Kai was astonished.

He was secretly delighted. This way, he did not have to worry about the safety of Hua Qing Si and his other friends. Initially, he thought that the lives of Hua Qing Si and the rest were controlled by Tan Jun Hao after he implanted Heart-Strangling Insects into them. Therefore, he was glad to hear Tan Jun Hao’s explanation.

Since room one was not under his control and he could not send any Divine Sense Messages, it should also be impossible for him to hurt them with the Heart-Strangling Insects.

It seemed that saving Patriarch Gong turned out to be a blessing to them.

“Good, this Old Master has satisfied all of little friend’s requests. Now, it’s little friend’s turn to grant this Old Master’s wish.” Tan Jun Hao stared at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai sighed deeply and remarked helplessly, “I hope that it won’t be a mistake to trust Elder Tan.”

He seemed to have accepted his fate, and having said so, he tossed the Sealed World Bead towards Tan Jun Hao lightly.

Tan Jun Hao’s eyes lit up as he quickly reached out to catch the Sealed World Bead. He did not see Yang Kai tamper with the Sealed World Bead in any way; in other words, he seemed truly willing to give up his Sealed World Bead in return for his mother-in-law.

However, for some reason, a sense of crisis struck Tan Jun Hao just as he was about to catch the Sealed World Bead.

At Tan Jun Hao’s level of strength, his intuition was extremely sharp, so as soon as he realized something was wrong, he hurriedly pushed his Emperor Qi to protect himself while staring intently at the Sealed World Bead in case of accidents.

At this moment, a black vortex suddenly emerged in front of the Sealed World Bead, like a Void Corridor connecting two worlds.

Then, a gigantic fist stretched out from the black vortex. There were ferocious and terrifying bone spur-like existences on this fist, striking towards Tan Jun Hao together with the fist.

Tan Jun Hao’s face changed drastically in an instant, his eyes bulging as his grasping hand froze mid-air.

“Hahahaha!” A wild laugh resounded as Yang Kai, who followed closely behind the Sealed World Bead, charged forward, “Even if you are cunning like a ghost, you still have to drink the water this Young Master used to wash his feet! Now die, Old Dog Tan!”

At the critical moment of life and death, a realization dawned on Tan Jun Hao and he immediately identified the gigantic fist, calling out in alarm, “Stone Puppet!”

Tan Jun Hao learnt from Hua Qing Si that there was a huge Stone Puppet as tall as a mountain hiding in Yang Kai’s Sealed World Bead.

But Hua Qing Si also mentioned that even though the Stone Puppet had incredible physical strength, its true power was only comparable to that of a First-Order Emperor Realm Master, and as long as he made flexible use of his speed, it would not be hard to deal with the Stone Puppet.

Therefore, Tan Jun Hao did not really put the Stone Puppet in his eyes; after all, he was a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master. Even if the Stone Puppet was powerful, it would still be useless if it could not hit him.

However, Tan Jun Hao did not even recall the existence of the Stone Puppet until the gigantic fist, full of spikes, appeared.

And it was too late when he finally remembered.

What flabbergasted him more was that the power of this fist was far greater than the full-powered blow of a First-Order Emperor Realm Master. Even a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master like him dared not to take this violent punch. Furthermore, it seemed that the fist of the Stone Puppet was layered with another kind of power, a power that gave off a terrifying sensation.

Tan Jun Hao had no idea that the Stone Puppet had been refining Shi Huo’s Source. Once the refining was complete, it could become the next Shi Huo Divine Spirit.

Now, even though the refining was not yet complete, there was already a trace of Divine Spirit power in this punch, which was enough to crush ordinary Emperor Qi.

The Stone Puppet itself was refining Shi Huo’s Source in a deep slumber, which should have been impossible to awake from in just a year or two. Nevertheless, since it was ultimately Yang Kai’s Embodiment, Yang Kai’s mind was connected to it. As such, Yang Kai had no problem controlling it to ambush Tan Jun Hao by connecting his consciousness to the Sealed World Bead.

The fist coming out of the Sealed World Bead was exactly the result of Yang Kai’s remote control.

The price paid to execute this move was not small. Spiritual Energy flooded outward from Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea, giving him a splitting headache.

The power of the fist was terrifying though, and with the addition of Yang Kai’s shout, Tan Jun Hao was thrown into a panic. With a wave of his hand, countless five-coloured light blades converged in front of him and shot towards the Embodiment’s fist. At the same time, he quickly retreated.

*Hong… *

All the five-coloured light blades shattered simultaneously, while the gigantic fist continued to blast forward unhindered. The sharp spikes broke through Tan Jun Hao Emperor Qi protection in an instant and stabbed a third of the way into his body, releasing a violent power that blasted him away while spurting large amounts of blood from his mouth. It was unknown if he was dead or alive.

On the other side, Yang Kai flew straight towards Wu Ming.

Although he shouted ‘die, old dog’, Yang Kai had no intentions to confront Tan Jun Hao at this moment as his priority was to rescue Chi Yue. Everything else could be considered later.

Therefore, Wu Ming could not react when Yang Kai advanced on him.

As their eyes met, Wu Ming was frightened pale and shouted, “Don’t come near, or I’ll kill her!”

While issuing his threat, a sword appeared in Wu Ming’s hand and immediately slashed towards Chi Yue fiercely.

“Solidify!” Yang Kai roared, causing the local Space Principles to condense and solidify the space where Wu Ming and Chi Yue were located.

The sword that was supposed to pierce Chi Yue was jolted slightly, and in that moment of delay, Yang Kai swooped in and snatched Chi Yue away from Wu Ming successfully while simultaneously landing a flying kick on Wu Ming’s head.

Followed by a painful howl, Wu Ming was sent tumbling through the air, crashing heavily to the ground some distance away as numerous teeth were knocked from his mouth.

As a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master, even if Wu Ming was no match for Yang Kai, it should have been impossible for him to be sent flying so miserably even taking a direct hit like this. However, fear had crept into his heart ever since he was beaten up severely by Yang Kai. In addition to seeing his Honoured Master suffering a massive loss, how could Wu Ming still have the presence of mind to fight back against Yang Kai? One would not be able to exert even half their strength if they were in a state of panic.

“Senior, are you alright?” Yang Kai scanned Chi Yue with his Divine Sense to check her condition.

Chi Yue’s face slightly flushed as she gripped her torn clothes to cover herself and shook her head, “I’m fine, but my cultivation is sealed.”

Just as Yang Kai was about to respond, his face suddenly turned solemn and he looked up in a certain direction with his teeth gritted, “It seems your status as a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master is not undeserved!”

Over there, an extremely strong aura blasted into the air as Tan Jun Hao walked out of the darkness step by step. He had long lost his sage-like appearance and now wore a ferocious expression on his face, as if he wanted to drink blood and eat raw flesh. His eyes were full of hatred and rage.

There were several big holes on his body, and his chest looked slightly sunken, obviously the result of the punch he took from the Embodiment.

No ordinary person could survive the Embodiment’s punch.

It was unknown how he stopped his bleeding, but his robe was full of blood.

“How dare a mere Junior deceive me! For this, you must die!” Tan Jun Hao clenched his teeth, his voice sounding like the ominous winds of hell, sending chills down the spines of all who heard it.

While speaking, he slightly moved his hands to perform a seal.

Chi Yue who was standing next to Yang Kai suddenly grunted before quickly releasing miserable screams.

Yang Kai was taken aback and swept his eyes over her, swiftly focusing on the skin of Chi Yue’s neck, where it looked as if something was squirming around.

“Heart-Strangling Insect!” Yang Kai bellowed. Chi Yue’s condition was similar to that of Hua Qing Si before, and it was obvious that she was implanted with a Heart-Strangling Insect too.

Tan Jun Hao was furious now, and he obviously wanted to take revenge by killing Chi Yue first.

“Despicable!” Yang Kai reprimanded as he stretched out his hand and summoned the Sealed World Bead back to him. He quickly wrapped his Divine Sense around Chi Yue who was beside him and sent her into the Sealed World Bead.

Tan Jun Hao, who was stimulating the Heart-Strangling Insect, frowned as he realized his connection with it had suddenly been cut off. He scolded with his teeth gritted, “Damn!”

The Sealed Word Bead was an independent world, and Yang Kai had continually collected Source Strength to improve the World Principles of the Sealed World Bead. Even if the Heart-Strangling Insect was powerful, it could not be triggered by Tan Jun Hao given that they were in two separate worlds now. Unless Tan Jun Hao could break the barriers of the World Principles of the Sealed World Bead, he would not be able to send his Divine Sense into the Small Sealed World.

Even a Great Emperor may not be able to do this, let alone a mere Tan Jun Hao. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Hahaha!” Yang Kai laughed wildly as his Divine Sense connected to the Small Sealed World and found Chi Yue was indeed relieved from the torture. The Heart-Strangling Insect in her neck calmed down too. After knowing that he made the right decision, he had no worries anymore.

On the other hand, Tan Jun Hao’s face was extremely ugly, as if his parents had just been killed before his eyes.

He had planned everything out, and everything was in his grasp, but he was continuously frustrated when he ultimately confronted Yang Kai.

“Damn Gong Tai!” He cursed again. If he knew that Gong Tai had such capability, he would have captured him earlier. With Gong Tai securing room one with his own Spirit Array, Tan Jun Hao could not do anything to the people in there.

Room one was like the Small Sealed World now, an independent space that was beyond his control.

If this wasn’t the case, Tan Jun Hao would still have several hostages over there to coerce Yang Kai with.

This was also the reason why he did not interfere with Hua Qing Si sending the hostages back earlier in the auction, for he thought that it would not harm him as he could still control their lives remotely.

One wrong move and his whole plan had failed. Life was but a chess game in this regard!

“Old Dog Tan, what else do you have up your sleeves? Show me everything you have so you can die convinced!” Yang Kai was gleeful and started to mock Tan Jun Hao again.
