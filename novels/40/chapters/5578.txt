In the void, Yang Kai was flying towards the Black Ink Clan’s main camp at a leisurely pace.

There were many Black Ink Clan scouts hiding along the way, but these scouts were only at the level of Feudal Lords at best so they were unable to hide themselves from his senses.

Yang Kai was indeed unafraid of revealing himself as he was not here to kill anyone, rather he was here to discuss some business with the Territory Lords.

The Human Race Army had attacked the Black Ink Clan over a dozen times during the past three decades, killing some 30 Territory Lords, which was more than enough already. It was the right time for him to initiate his plan as the sooner it was implemented, the better.

Looking towards the depths of the void, he could vaguely see the Black Ink Clan’s main camp that was spread across a few Universe Worlds. He could not wait to slaughter all of them, and why would he not? But not only would this take a lot of time, even if he did manage to kill all the Black Ink Clan troops in Profound Nether Territory, what would that really accomplish?

Perhaps it would ease some of the Human Race’s current troubles, but it would not solve the root of their problem. Ultimately, it would all be in vain.

As long as Mo was still alive and kicking, it would be able to continuously breed more Black Ink Clansmen and even create more Black Ink Giant Spiritual Gods.

If Yang Kai wanted to solve the problem once and for all, he would have to go to the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction and kill Mo!

Of course, that was impossible to do with just an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Cultivation. Only by reaching the Ninth Order would this even become a remote possibility.

There was only so much one man could do alone. The Human Race’s future depended on the efforts of the entire younger generation.

More and more Black Ink Clan scouts started to gather around Yang Kai, and even Black Ink Clan patrol teams were beginning to move around him, but because of his reputation, none of them dared to get too close.

Nonetheless, Yang Kai kept moving forward.

Chaos and confusion had already broken out in the Black Ink Clan main camp. Yang Kai’s act of venturing into the Black Ink Clan’s perimeter alone was extremely bewildering. Some Territory Lords believed it to be another one of the Human Race’s schemes and that Yang Kai was just bait to attract their attention. They believed that the Human Race Masters were lying in ambush somewhere, waiting for an opportunity to deliver a fatal blow.

Some Territory Lords were clamouring that it was a rare opportunity, saying that the most important thing right now was to use all of the Black Ink Clan’s strength to kill Yang Kai. His death would definitely cripple the morale of the entire Profound Nether Territory’s Human Race Army, leaving them vulnerable and giving the Black Ink Clan an overwhelming advantage.

Listening to their constant bickering and shouting, Six Arms finally couldn’t help but roar, “Shut up!”

The chaotic voices finally fell silent.

Six Arms glanced around with a gloomy expression as his face turned dark and disgraced. The fact that one Eighth-Open Human had sent so many Territory Lords of Profound Nether Territory into utter panic had left him speechless.

Although he knew that it was because many Territory Lords had died at this Human’s hands, his subordinates’ behaviour here had still disappointed him.

After glancing around for a moment, Six Arms’ gaze finally landed on Mo Na Ye as he asked, “What do you think the Human Race’s plan is?”

Although Six Arms and Mo Na Ye had not been on good terms these past few decades, Six Arms had to admit that Mo Na Ye was not only strong, but his mind was also sharp.

Mo Na Ye replied, “The Human Race may not have any plan.”

Mo Na Ye’s reply left the Territory Lords speechless, [What nonsense!? What do you mean by no plan?]

Six Arms’ face turned black. He had lowered himself to ask for Mo Na Ye’s opinion, but he had not expected the other party to give such an answer.

Fortunately, Mo Na Ye quickly continued, “The Human Race Army is showing signs of mobilization, but they haven’t dispatched any troops yet. The scouts also haven’t discovered any trace of other Eighth-Open Heaven Realm Masters moving, which means that Yang Kai really came alone. He didn’t conceal his tracks either, so I think he didn’t come here to start a war. Perhaps… he wants to discuss something with us?”

“Discuss what?” Six Arms raised his brow.

Mo Na Ye shook his head, “I don’t know either. Yang Kai is both strong and bold, but most importantly… His ability to escape is unmatched. He probably thinks that even if he comes here alone, we wouldn’t be able to do anything to him.”

Mo Na Ye felt a little ashamed when he said this last sentence, but it was the truth. He had pursued Yang Kai countless times with four other Territory Lords over the years, but they had never once managed to even hit him.

“So what do you think he’s here to discuss with us?”

Mo Na Ye replied, “It’s just my guess, whether it’s true or not, Sir Six Arms will have to determine.”

Six Arms nodded slightly. To be honest, he also felt this was the case as there was no other explanation for Yang Kai’s strange actions today.

[There is an irreconcilable feud between the Black Ink Clan and the Human Race. Rivers of blood flow every time a war breaks out, so what could Yang Kai want to discuss?]

After a moment of silence, Six Arms stated, “Since that’s the case, let’s go and meet him.”

He then selected 9 other Territory Lords and ordered, “Follow me, as for the rest of you… conceal yourselves and wait for my orders!”

If possible, he did not want to miss an opportunity to kill Yang Kai. If he could kill Yang Kai somehow, they would be able to suppress the entire Profound Nether Territory within a couple of years.

The Territory Lords understood this and immediately obeyed.

In the void, Yang Kai continued to move forward at a leisurely pace. He had already gotten quite close to the Black Ink Clan main camp when suddenly, he looked up and saw 10 figures with powerful auras flying out of a Universe World in front of him. Their leader was none other than Six Arms.

Not only that, Yang Kai also keenly noticed many more Territory Lords hiding in the nearby Black Ink Clouds.

He had already anticipated this, so he just continued moving forward with a smile on his lips, fearlessly.

On the other side, Six Arms couldn’t help feeling a sense of admiration, watching Yang Kai flying towards them in a totally undisturbed manner. [This Human…truly doesn’t know any fear.] No one else would have dared to act like this, for walking into the enemy’s encirclement alone was akin to suicide.

The distance between them was rapidly shortening, and at some point, Yang Kai came to a halt and smiled at Six Arms.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Six Arms almost couldn’t help but give the order to attack.

Yang Kai’s current position was quite tempting to the Black Ink Clan as he was surrounded by Territory Lords from all directions and was locked onto by all of them. The Territory Lords were ready to attack at a moment’s notice, so as soon as Six Arms gave the order, they would rain down Hell on Yang Kai.

[Even if he is proficient in the Dao of Space, he might not be able to escape unscathed, right?]

[Should we attack or not?]

At this moment, Six Arms’ heart rate began to accelerate.

But before he could make a decision, Yang Kai chuckled, “Six Arms, since I dared to come alone, I naturally have the confidence to escape too. I might be surrounded by many Territory Lords, but you won’t be able to kill me. At best, you would only be able to seriously injure me.”

Six Arms’ face turned dark and gloomy, but he did not retort back. The other Territory Lords’ faces also turned ugly as they felt that Yang Kai was being too arrogant.

Had it been any other Eighth-Order Human, the Territory Lords would scoff at these words, but since Yang Kai said them, they had no choice but to take his words seriously. They knew that this Human was no fool. If he didn’t have absolute confidence, why would he dare come here all alone and let himself be surrounded?

Yang Kai continued without any sense of urgency, “So long as I’m alive, you’ll always have to watch your backs. I’ll keep killing one or two of you every time we fight. I wonder how many Territory Lords the Black Ink Clan can sacrifice?”

Listening to this, a Territory Lord beside Six Arms angrily shouted, “Yang Kai, don’t act so arrogantly! Since you’ve come here alone, you can forget about leaving here alive!”

Yang Kai looked at him, sizing him up before indifferently stating, “I remember you. You managed to escape from my hands 10 years ago. Have you recovered yet?”

The Territory Lord immediately choked and couldn’t speak as he subconsciously touched his waist where there was still a deep wound that had yet to heal.

Even to this date, he would tremble in fear whenever he recalled the scene of him escaping from Yang Kai’s spear a decade ago. He was lucky that time as Mo Na Ye and the others had hurriedly come to his rescue, forcing Yang Kai to retreat.

Yang Kai’s tone suddenly turned cold, “The next time war breaks out, you will die first.”

The Territory Lord’s expression changed drastically as terror filled his eyes. He couldn’t help but step back in fear, but the next moment, when he felt everyone’s gaze on him, he felt so ashamed that he wanted nothing more than to crawl into a hole and never come out.

Although he was ashamed, he did not speak again. He was not confident that he would manage to escape if he was really targeted by Yang Kai on the battlefield

Profound Nether Territory… was too dangerous right now. He wanted to go back to the No-Return Pass to recuperate.

“Enough!” Six Arms coldly snorted as his expression turned ugly.

Yang Kai had come alone, but not only did he not act cautiously, he was even more imposing than ever. Worse, with just a few words, he managed to frighten a Territory Lord under him so badly that he actually stumbled backwards in panic, enraging Six Arms completely.

[How could the Human Race produce such a monster?!]

He stared deeply at Yang Kai and asked, “Your Excellency, you didn’t come here to fight with us, right?”

A calm and peaceful smile appeared on Yang Kai’s lips, “Of course not. I came here mainly to negotiate peace with all of you.”

“Negotiate peace?” Six Arms and the Territory Lords were stunned.

Everyone had guessed that Yang Kai had come here alone for some purpose, but no one had expected him to say something like this.

[Peace? What peace!?]

The Human Race and the Black Ink Clan had been locked in a bloody war for millions of years. The Black Ink Clan could not help but think that Yang Kai had lost his mind. It’s impossible for them to co-exist peacefully. The war between the two races would only come to an end once one side was completely annihilated, yet Yang Kai actually said he came here to discuss peace.

The Territory Lords almost thought they might have heard wrong. They looked at each other, subconsciously thinking that this was another one of the Human Race’s schemes.

Yang Kai, on the other hand, earnestly continued, “That’s right, I’m here to negotiate a ceasefire. Of course, not a complete ceasefire, just one between the Territory Lords and Eighth-Order Human Masters.”

Yang Kai then let out a heavy sigh before continuing with a look of frustration, “My Human Race is suffering. We have lost countless people over these years. We even lost the 3,000 Worlds. Now, we are confined to just a dozen or so Great Territory Battlefields, struggling to resist your Black Ink Clan’s onslaught. Not to mention other Great Territory Battlefields, Profound Nether Territory alone has suffered heavy casualties over these few decades of fighting. Every war would result in a river of blood flowing across the void and corpses piling up like mountains. Soldiers sacrifice their limbs, and even their lives to block you all. My Human Race is really suffering deeply.”

Hearing his sorrowful overtures, Six Arms’ face turned red with rage while all the other Territory Lords wore warped expressions.

[What nonsense is this bastard spewing!? It might be the case for other Great Territory Battlefields, but could the Human Race be suffering more than the Black Ink Clan in Profound Nether Territory?]

Indeed, the Human Race suffered casualties in every battle, but compared to the losses the Black Ink Clan endured, the Human Race’s casualties were insignificant. The Black Ink Clan’s casualties here were so high that 30% of all Black Ink Clansmen spawned for battle were sent to Profound Nether Territory just to maintain their lines.

No less than a million Black Ink Clan soldiers would die every time a war broke out here.

Not only that, ever since Yang Kai arrived at Profound Nether Territory, some 30 Territory Lords had been slaughtered by him either directly or indirectly.

[Why is this guy speaking such drivel, and in such a serious manner!?]
