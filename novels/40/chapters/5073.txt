It wasn’t until a few days later that Yang Kai’s aura stabilised and he opened his eyes.

Zha Gu took a step forward and imitated the Humans by cupping his fist, “Many thanks, Brother Yang.”

Yang Kai put on a smile, “Don’t mention it, Brother Zha Gu. Since you trusted me, I naturally wouldn’t disappoint you.”

A puzzled Zha Gu asked, “I watched my Black Ink Disciple refine artifacts before, but the way he did so was different from you. Why is that?”

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “There are many methods of Artifact Refining in the Human world, and each Sect has their own distinct Artifact Refining techniques. I have no idea which Sect your Black Ink Disciple belonged to, but my method is named Thousand Tempering Art. It’s from a very ancient Sect in the Human world and it’s a time-tested method.”

Upon hearing his explanation, Zha Gu nodded, “I see.”

Yang Kai wasn’t just talking nonsense. The method he used to enhance the giant halberd was indeed named Thousand Tempering Art. This kind of technique was especially suitable for refining offensive and defensive artifacts. Even in Divine Cauldron Cave Heaven, only people who held important positions had the right to cultivate it.

Yang Kai learned Artifact Refining from Chai Hao, and with Dong Guo An Ping and Zhong Liang giving the order, Chai Hao naturally wouldn’t hide anything from him.

Yang Kai followed up by saying, “Don’t worry about it, Brother Zha Gu. You’ll understand the result when the weapon is fully refined.”

Zha Gu nodded repeatedly, “I certainly trust you, Brother Yang.”

“I’ll continue, then,” Yang Kai said, then got to his feet and lifted the hammer. As he activated his power to draw on the Earth Fire, he repeatedly struck the giant halberd with all his might.

What Zha Gu saw was only the surface. Every time Yang Kai struck the giant halberd, he not only activated his power to draw on the Earth Fire, but also refined the weapon’s internal structure. Yang Kai was imbuing the giant halberd with his own strength each time his hammer struck, purifying and tempering it from the inside out.

Day after day, deafening clangs were continuously heard coming from the cave.

Yang Kai’s movements alternated between fast and slow. Sometimes, he would be gentle with the strikes, as though he was just tapping on the weapon, but sometimes, he would strike it rapidly and loudly as a series of clangs were heard in quick succession.

He also had to rest from time to time.

Initially, Zha Gu watched from the side with excitement, but he soon lost patience as time passed. Furthermore, he was injured in the previous battle and hadn’t recovered, so he needed time to recuperate.

Hence, he would only come over and have a look at the giant halberd every half a month. Each time he did so, he would realise that the weapon had gone through a conspicuous transformation.

Three months later, when Zha Gu came over again, he saw that Yang Kai was seated on the ground with his legs crossed, a shiny giant halberd standing straight in front of him.

This giant halberd was already much thinner than the original one, though the length remained the same. However, Zha Gu could feel that this weapon radiated an imposing aura.

If the initial giant halberd was like a pearl that was covered in dust, then this one radiated a dazzling glow after the dust was removed.

Zha Gu’s breathing became rapid.

As he stepped forward, he grabbed the giant halberd and lifted it off the ground. After holding it in his grip, he realised that the weight, length, and thickness of the weapon perfectly matched his build and strength. It was as though the weapon was custom-made for him.

There were some abstruse patterns on the shaft of the weapon, and as he infused Black Ink Strength into it, the giant halberd started humming and growling like an awakened beast. The complicated patterns were able to amplify the power of his Black Ink Strength.

He couldn’t help but put on a bright smile.

Even though the Black Ink Clan had Black Ink Strength to rely on, and they were physically more robust than the Humans, they were incapable of studying Artifact Refining. They had suffered immense losses during the battles because of the artifacts used by the Humans. Humans had all sorts of artifacts that could strike them in the most unexpected ways. As the two Races clashed, a lot of Black Ink Clansmen were killed by the artifacts that the Humans used.

If the Black Ink Clan were able to make artifacts, the Humans would have been destroyed by now; however, even a Feudal Lord like him found it hard to get an artifact that was useful to him. This couldn’t be helped, as the artifacts snatched from the Humans were not suitable for him. Although he had a Black Ink Disciple who knew a thing or two about Artifact Refining in the past, that Disciple’s skills were mediocre.

It never crossed his mind that he would obtain such a weapon on this day.

With this artifact in his hands, Zha Gu could feel that his combat power had increased by 20%. The increase might not be much, but it might save his life and turn a battle around at a critical moment. Furthermore, with such a giant halberd in his possession, he could easily deal a heavy blow to his enemies even without activating his power.

He could already imagine how imposing he would be when he next went to war.

“It seems that you’re pleased with this artifact, Brother Zha Gu,” Yang Kai was suddenly heard saying.

When Zha Gu turned his head, he saw that Yang Kai had opened his eyes and was smiling at him.

“Yes, I couldn’t be happier with it,” Zha Gu guffawed, “Is this thing fully refined?”

Yang Kai replied, “It was your Black Ink Disciple who created this thing, all I did was enhance it. This is already the best I can do with my skills.”

“Is this considered a Mid-Rank artifact?” Zha Gu asked.

“Yes,” Yang Kai nodded. Given his eyesight, he reckoned that this giant halberd could be considered a Mid-Rank artifact. It was still far from being a High-Rank artifact; however, it was already a wonderful weapon for Zha Gu, which was why he was elated.

“You have some incredible skills in Artifact Refining, Brother Yang,” Zha Gu praised him liberally. The outcome of the Artifact Refining sessions suggested that Yang Kai was significantly more skilful than his former Black Ink Disciple. After all, his Black Ink Disciple had spent many years and resources, but he only managed to create a rough prototype.

“Many thanks for your compliment,” Yang Kai replied humbly. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After examining the giant halberd in his hands, Zha Gu carefully stored it and glanced at Yang Kai, “I said that if you’re able to fulfil my demand, I would give you a reward. Why don’t you tell me what you want? I’ll get it for you as long as I’m able to.”

Yang Kai broke into laughter, “Don’t you know what I want, Brother Zha Gu?”

Zha Gu was startled upon hearing that, but he soon realised what the other man meant, “Got it; however, a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit is quite costly. Even if I sell all of my assets, I might not be able to afford one.”

Yang Kai said, “If you can help me buy a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit, I’ll refine an Artifact Armour for you. The quality will be just as good as this giant halberd.”

Zha Gu fell silent for a moment. He couldn’t help feeling tempted when he envisioned himself wearing an Artifact Armour and holding the giant halberd on the battlefield, so he soon nodded, “Deal!”

Yang Kai added, “You’ll have to provide all the materials for making the Artifact Armour, though.”

“Of course.”

“When will I get the Profound Yin Spirit Fruit?”

“I’ll get it for you within three days.” Upon finishing his words, Zha Gu turned around and left. It was apparent that he was trying to come up with a way to buy a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit.

Even though he was just a Feudal Lord, he had accumulated some funds over the years, so in truth, it wouldn’t be hard for him to purchase a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit.

After he was gone, Yang Kai let out a breath. His most pressing problem had been solved as he had secured a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit. After he was done making artifacts for Zha Gu, he hoped to spread the news that he was skilful in Artifact Refining. That way, he would be able to move on to the next stage of his plan when Hei Yuan was done recuperating.

Zha Gu was indeed a man of his word, and just three days later, he returned to the cave and passed a wooden box to Yang Kai.

After taking the box, Yang Kai opened it and saw a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit inside.

“Many thanks, Brother Zha Gu.” Yang Kai cupped his fist.

Zha Gu waved his hand, “There’s no need to thank me for fulfilling a deal. You should quickly refine this Profound Yin Spirit Fruit and repair your Small Universe.”

“That’s what I thought as well.”

“I’ll not disturb you for now. Just notify me when you’re ready.”

Yang Kai nodded.

Zha Gu then turned around and left the place.

It wasn’t until Zha Gu was out of sight that Yang Kai fished out the Profound Yin Spirit Fruit. Even though the World Tree clone was continuously repairing his Small Universe, and there were already some results, the progress was quite slow.

He didn’t have so much time to spare, and with the help of this Profound Yin Spirit Fruit, he reckoned that his Small Universe would recover much more quickly.

Without hesitation, he stuffed the Profound Yin Spirit Fruit into his mouth and started refining it.

Soon, a warm stream of energy rose from his stomach and penetrated his Small Universe. As the medicinal efficacies of the Profound Yin Spirit Fruit circulated, the damaged part in his Small Universe was being repaired at an incredible pace.

The average cultivator wouldn’t experience such a rapid result after ingesting this Spirit Fruit. The reason Yang Kai’s Small Universe could heal quickly was that he also had the help of the World Tree’s clone.

Even so, it still took him three months to finish. The moment his Small Universe became complete again, Yang Kai felt his aura surging. He was overwhelmed with a sense of ecstasy.

The damage to his Small Universe made him feel as if something was missing. Be it activating his power or cultivating, he had been greatly affected. Now that his Small Universe was complete again, the sense of discomfort had faded away.

In the battle against Liu Zi An previously, even though he managed to gain the upper hand, it took him quite some time and effort to defeat the other party. If he were to fight against Liu Zi An now, Yang Kai had the confidence to subdue him in just a few moves.

Although the damage to his Small Universe had been repaired, the loss of heritage from sacrificing pieces of his Small Universe had to be made up slowly. There was no rush to do so though as the cultivation of an Open Heaven Realm Master was all about accumulation over the long term.

Yang Kai’s speed of refining materials was already much greater than that of an average Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, and the living beings in his Small Universe continuously strengthened his heritage, so he would still be able to ascend to the Eighth-Order at an unimaginable speed.

Only by ascending to the Eighth Order would he be considered an important piece on the Black Ink Battlefield. Meanwhile, the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were the pillars of strength in their respective Great Passes.

After examining himself and confirming that there was no problem, Yang Kai activated his Divine Sense.

Soon, Zha Gu’s burly figure came into sight as he gazed at him in shock, “You’ve recovered?”

He could feel that Yang Kai was different now. In the past, he always had a feeling that Yang Kai was somehow incomplete, but that feeling was now gone. It suggested his Small Universe had been fully repaired.
