“Blood Crow is a cautious person. If he had detected Martial Uncle’s aura, he wouldn’t have easily shown up; therefore, Martial Uncle could only follow my aura from a distance and make a judgement of the best time to make a move. Since my aura has been blocked while we are surrounded by the blood sea, Martial Uncle must have some speculations already.”

Upon hearing his explanation, Yang Kai said, “So, you wanted to break through the blood sea to send out your aura, which would help your Senior identify your location.”

Xu Wang smiled and nodded, “Exactly. In order to achieve the goal, Martial Uncle even split his natal artifact into two and let me keep part of it. While he plays it by ear from a distance, I’ll be assisting him here. Regardless of how powerful Blood Crow is, he won’t be able to flee now.”

Yang Kai gazed at the dissipating blood sea and commented, “He’s doomed, then.”

Inside the blood sea, the lid that was tossed away by Xu Wang expanded rapidly. As they spoke, the lid had expanded by a radius of several hundred kilometres and directly covered the blood sea. Regardless of how the blood sea raged, it was unable to get out of the lid.

Upon realising that something was off, Blood Crow instantly decided to flee as he led the blood sea in a different direction. However, the lid relentlessly followed him and changed its size according to the movements of the blood sea.

A gigantic dark shadow descended from above next. It wasn’t certain what it was, but it soon became one with the lid and trapped the blood sea inside it.

Yang Kai could faintly see a tall figure hovering above the dark shadow. While he performed different hand seals, his World Force surged and revealed a Seventh-Order pressure.

Blood Crow certainly wouldn’t sit still and wait for death as his immense power undulated. There was no doubt that a cornered beast would fight back.

However, there was a massive gap between their Orders, and the other party managed to get the upper hand by trapping Blood Crow inside his artifact right from the start. Regardless of how hard Blood Crow tried, he could not escape.

An incense stick later, the dark shadow contracted. It wasn’t until this moment that Yang Kai realised it was something that looked like a fish basket.

There were gaps around the fish basket through which one could see the weltering blood inside it. What was amazing was that the blood couldn’t seep out through the gaps, as though it had been restricted by a mysterious power.

A person grabbed the fish basket and casually placed it over his shoulder.

The sight caused Yang Kai to be drenched in cold sweat.

Xu Wang took a step forward and cupped his fist, “Fisherman Martial Uncle!”

“Void Land’s Yang Kai greets Senior.” Yang Kai also cupped his fist.

It wasn’t until this moment that he had time to examine this person, who didn’t have the demeanour of a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master at all. Yang Kai could be considered a worldly person. When he previously met up with those from the Cave Heavens and Paradises while he was in the Star Boundary, he had chatted with some 80 to 100 High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters, so he was not unfamiliar with such people.

While Yu Chang Dao had a sage-like temperament, even Xu Ling Gong, who loved spouting nonsense, was an imposing presence.

However, Yang Kai had never seen a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master who appeared as strange as the person before his eyes.

Xu Wang called him Fisherman Martial Uncle, and true to his title, he looked just like a fisherman. While wearing a bamboo hat and a straw coat, he was bare-foot with rolled up leggings. Presently, there was a fish basket over his shoulder. If he also held a bamboo stick, he would look like a common fisherman in the winter.

Nevertheless, the fish he had caught this time was Blood Crow.

The fisherman raised his hand and lifted the bamboo hat that had slightly blocked his sight. After taking a glance at Yang Kai, he said with a smile, “It’s said that every generation will see a fair share of talented people. This Old Master has heard a lot about you over the years.”

Yang Kai replied humbly, “Many thanks for your compliment, Senior.”

The fisherman slowly continued, “There’s no need to be overly humble. You’ve done a great service with the Star Boundary. All Cave Heavens and Paradises owe you a favour.”

He then took a glance at Xu Wang and asked in a solemn voice, “I detected the auras of several High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters in this place some time ago. What happened?”

Xu Wang then told him what had happened when the portal that led to the Universe Cave Heaven opened. The fisherman was surprised as he looked at the depths of the void where the portal was located, but soon said after a sigh, “Unfortunately, this Old Master has to return to Bright King Cave Heaven; otherwise, I could’ve stayed and watched a good show.”

Xu Wang darted his gaze around before saying, “Please go back with peace of mind, Martial Uncle. I’ll stay here.” He was curious about the Universe Cave Heaven.

The fisherman shook his head, “You have to go back with me.”

Xu Wang then sported a dejected expression.

With a smile, the fisherman went on to say, “You’ve made a contribution by assisting me to capture Blood Crow. Did you forget what reward you’ll get? There’ll be an opportunity in one year. If you don’t come back with me, you’ll have to wait at least a dozen years for the next opportunity.”

Upon hearing that, Xu Wang changed his mind in an instant, “I’ll obey your orders, Martial Uncle.”

As they spoke, the fish basket over the fisherman’s shoulder started shaking violently. It was apparent that Blood Crow was trying to struggle out of it. The fisherman then landed a forceful slap on it, after which no more noises were heard.

Xu Wang said, “Junior Brother Yang has made a significant contribution in helping to capture Blood Crow. If he hadn’t helped me escape previously, I would’ve been killed. After that, he came all the way here to hunt Blood Crow down. It was also thanks to Junior Brother Yang that I was able to send out a signal just now. Doesn’t our Sect have any reward for him?”

The fisherman put on a smile and gazed at Yang Kai, “If you were a disciple from Bright King Cave Heaven, you could have a chance to enter our Small Source World just like Xu Wang. Unfortunately, you are not from our Sect, so we can’t give such a reward to an outsider.”

An opportunity to enter a Small Source World was extremely precious. That was because every time a person received training in a Small Source World, it was akin to gaining some of the heritage of that world. Yang Kai had experienced the Divine Armament World of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven before, so he was fully aware of this.

If he were not a son-in-law of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, and if Xu Ling Gong hadn’t done his best to make it happen, Yang Kai wouldn’t have gotten the chance to enter the Divine Armament World either.

The Cave Heavens and Paradises all had their own Small Source Worlds, but they would only allow the best disciples of their Sects to enter for life experience.

Since Xu Wang had made a significant contribution, he could enter the Small Source World of Bright King Cave Heaven, but Yang Kai couldn’t get this reward.

“If you have any requests, just speak them. I’ll agree to them if I have the right to do so. If it’s not up to me to make a decision, I’ll inform the higher-ups in the Sect about it and see what they say.”

Yang Kai directly took a glance at the fish basket that confined Blood Crow and asked, “Senior, may I know what will happen to Blood Crow?”

The fisherman shook his head, “I have no idea.”

Although he was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he wasn’t in any place to make a decision on how to deal with Blood Crow, who was an Old Monster that had been reborn by occupying someone else’s body.

Yang Kai nodded gently, “If there’s a chance, I want a copy of the Grand Evolution Immortal Blood Light Scripture.”

“I can’t agree to that right away. If possible, I’ll tell Xu Wang to send the copy to Void Land. If it’s not achievable, you don’t have to keep waiting.” Although the fisherman didn’t reject him directly, Yang Kai could feel that the chance was slim; after all, the Grand Evolution Immortal Blood Light Scripture was truly abstruse, and by giving a copy to someone they might accidentally create another Blood Crow. Therefore, they probably wouldn’t let that happen.

Nevertheless, Yang Kai still expressed his gratitude by saying, “Many thanks, Senior.”

The fisherman nodded while Xu Wang cupped his fist, “Farewell, Junior Brother. I hope that the next time we meet, both of us will already be in the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm.”

“I hope so too, Senior Brother,” Yang Kai replied with a smile.

The fisherman and Xu Wang then left the place together.

Yang Kai remained on the same spot and watched them leave, after which he turned to look at the portal that led to the Universe Cave Heaven.

Earlier, the appearance of Blood Crow caused this place to plunge into chaos. About seventy to eighty out of the hundreds of Open Heaven Realm Masters were instantly killed, which were a lot of casualties. Furthermore, after several High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters showed up, most surviving cultivators stayed away from this place, and they wouldn’t even dare to observe what was going on. Even the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were nowhere to be seen now.

After all, several Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters had shown up. No one would dare snatch food from the tiger’s mouth.

The place was originally bustling with noise, but now Yang Kai was the only one left, which he was glad to see.

Although the portal that led to the Universe Cave Heaven had closed, it had opened up several times before and left behind some traces. Others might not have a way to enter it, but Yang Kai could forcefully open the portal since he was a Master of the Dao of Space. It would just take him some time to do so.

He thus activated his Divine Sense. While restoring his strength, Yang Kai tried to capture the remaining traces in the Void, and an incense stick later, he managed to grasp a lead.

Yang Kai pushed his Space Principles, stabbing them into the portal like a sharp knife as he slowly increased his output to force it open. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After some time, a black hole the size of a fist appeared in front of Yang Kai. The aura of a Universe World wafted through the black hole.

As the black hole expanded, the aura of the Universe World became increasingly conspicuous. Soon, it had become the size of a washbasin.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s expression changed drastically. A horrifying force burst out of the portal he had forcefully opened. The unsuspecting Yang Kai was hit in the chest by this force and sent flying away as though he had been struck by lightning.

While the vitality in his chest weltered, his vision darkened as though he had been struck by a Divine Ability from someone in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm. Even his Small Universe was in turmoil.

Before he could stabilise himself, he felt an even more dangerous aura coming out of the portal.

A terrified Yang Kai turned to look at the opening, which should have disappeared as soon as he stopped holding it open; however, it instead had started expanding uncontrollably, as though it was going to swallow the entire Void.

[What’s going on?] Yang Kai was astounded.

He just wanted to open the portal to take a peek inside the Universe Cave Heaven, so his movements shouldn’t have caused such an incident to happen.

While he was in a daze, he could faintly see a few figures battling against each other through the portal. There was a burly middle-aged man, an old woman with grey hair, a young boy, and a young woman with a curvy figure.

They were all the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters who had previously entered the Universe Cave Heaven.

Yang Kai’s expression instantly darkened. [Are these people out of their minds? How could they engage in an all out battle inside a Universe Cave Heaven?]
