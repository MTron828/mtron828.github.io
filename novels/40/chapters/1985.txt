The reason why Yang Kai had come to the black market was that he had no other choice.

Right now, he had more than three hundred Source Condensing Pills on him.

These Source Condensing Pills were secretly pocketed by him and there was no way he could use them all up personally. Keeping them around would be a waste, so selling them off was the best option, but... he had no good channel to go about this; after all, the origins of these Source Condensing Pills was not ‘legitimate’.

Yang Kai could not openly sell these pills as that would only draw problems from Spirit Pill Plaza.

As such, he could only come to this black market.

This was the best and most suitable place to pawn off these illicit goods.

Yang Kai basically did not have any Source Crystals on hand, so after selling this batch of Spirit Pills, he would have some emergency funds.

A short while later, a fat man opened the door and walked in. This fat man literally jiggled as he walked and the floor beneath him creaked. There was so much excess flesh on his face that his eyes were nothing more than narrow slits.

As soon as he entered, the fat man cupped his fists enthusiastically and said, “Jin Fu Gui, greets this Young Lord.”

He knowingly did not ask Yang Kai’s name, because people who came here didn’t like others inquiring about themselves.

Yang Kai stood up and returned the courtesy, “Shopkeeper Jin is too polite.”

Sweeping his eyes over this fat man, Yang Kai quickly discovered that he was also a Third-Order Origin King, and the aura fluctuations coming from him were extremely powerful. It seemed this Jin Fu Gui had fully converted his Saint Qi into Source Qi. Masters like this, while not a frequent sight in Maplewood City, still existed in a substantial number. Kang Si Ran and Zhuo Ning Si, for example, could be considered masters in Maplewood City.

Jin Fu Gui quickly sat down, the chair beneath him groaning under the sudden stress.

Smiling widely, he looked at Yang Kai and said, “I’ve heard from my shop-hand that Young Lord wishes to sell a batch of Spirit Pills, yes?”

“Indeed!”

Jin Fu Gui heard this response and his slit eyes flashed, “Dare I ask what kind of Spirit Pills Young Lord wishes to sell? This Jin is a well-known figure in Maplewood City, so Young Lord can rest assured that this Jin will offer a fair price and will never reveal any information about their origin.”

“Shopkeeper Jin saying so puts me at ease,” Yang Kai nodded, reached out, and took out a bottle from his Space Ring before pushing it over to Jin Fu Gui and saying, “Shopkeeper Jin should see for himself what type of Spirit Pill I have come to sell.

Jin Fu Gui nodded to Yang Kai before picking up the jade bottle and un-capping it.

The next moment, Jin Fu Gui could not help raising his brow and muttering in some pleasant surprise, “Source Condensing Pills?”

Source Condensing Pills were always in short supply, especially on the black market. Even if there were not 10,000 customers looking for Source Condensing Pills each day, there were at least 8,000. This kind of Spirit Pill was always snatched up as soon as it appeared, whether it was above or below-board.

Therefore, Jin Fu Gui was extremely satisfied with the goods Yang Kai had brought.

“How many would Young Lord like to sell?”

Yang Kai silently gestured a number.

Jin Fu Gui couldn’t help showing a stunned look this time as he asked unconsciously, “Three hundred? Young Lord was able to obtain three hundred Source Condensing Pills?”

One Source Condensing Pill could be used for ten days by a First-Order Origin King while a Second-Order Origin King would use it up in about six or seven days. As for Third-Orders, three to four days was the norm.

As such, while three hundred Source Condensing Pills may not seem like a large number, it was definitely not small either. Any Origin King who was able to obtain so many Source Condensing Pills would not have to worry about converting their Saint Qi to Source Qi for several years at least.

What Jin Fu Gui was wondering was where Yang Kai had obtained such a large number of Source Condensing Pills!

However, such information was obviously confidential, so he didn’t press for an answer.

After pondering for a moment, Jin Fu Gui said, “Three hundred is no small number, but regarding their quality...”

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Shopkeeper Jin can try one himself.”

Jin Fu Gui did not refuse and nodded. “Then please forgive this Jin for his rudeness.”

Saying so, he poured out a Source Condensing Pill from the jade bottle, stuffed it into his mouth, and silently circulated his Secret Art to refine it. After a while, his fat face shook slightly as a light of surprise flashed across his eyes.

This was a Source Condensing Pill that Yang Kai had refined using the pill recipe provided by Spirit Pill Plaza, so its quality was even better than the Source Condensing Pills previously sold by Spirit Pill Plaza.

Jin Fu Gui was also a Third-Order Origin King who had dealt with Spirit Pills for many years, so how could he not be able to judge this difference?

Secretly shocked, he quickly realized that the origins of these Source Condensing Pills in Yang Kai’s hands were likely quite extraordinary.

The room fell silent for a while as Fatty Jin tapped his hand on the tabletop, as if contemplating something.

After a long silence, he finally spoke, “The quality of this batch of Source Condensing Pills need not even be questioned. En, what does Young Lord think of this price?”

As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and gestured.

Yang Kai couldn’t help sneering, “Shopkeeper Jin, is my batch of Source Condensing Pills only worth such a price in your eyes? If that is the case, I’ll be taking my leave now.”

Jin Fu Gui lightly coughed. “Young Lord, please wait a moment. This batch of Source Condensing Pills is indeed top-notch goods, but selling them in my humble establishment will require some manpower and labour. Young Lord does not intend for this Jin to make no profit at all, right?”

“What Shopkeeper Jin says makes sense,” Yang Kai nodded. “But there is never a need to worry about customers for Source Condensing Pills. I don’t even need to go to any store, all I need to do is stand in the street and shout and I will be able to sell my entire inventory in no time. Shopkeeper Jin, are you sure you want to give up this opportunity to profit?”

Jin Fu Gui’s fat cheeks twitched as he grit his teeth and gestured again, “Then how about the price!”

Yang Kai glanced at him, “Raise it another five hundred and perhaps we will have an opportunity to collaborate again in the future!”

Jin Fu Gui frowned when he heard these words, but soon made a decision and nodded, “Then we will follow Young Lord’s suggestion. I hope that Young Lord will patronize my humble establishment first if he ever has more Source Condensing Pills in the future.”

“Naturally,” Yang Kai grinned meaningfully. “By the way, besides Source Condensing Pills, I have some other pills here. Please give me an estimate of their worth, Shopkeeper Jin.”

The other pills Yang Kai mentioned were naturally the ones he had on hand from performing Alchemy in Blue Feather Sect. There were a variety of different pills, but their grade and popularity naturally could not be compared with the batch of Source Condensing Pills.

Of course, Jin Fu Gui did not care about this. To him, as a black market businessman, as long as he could make money, it was enough.

After bargaining back and forth a bit, Jin Fu Gui collected most of the Spirit Pills Yang Kai had on hand while Yang Kai received nearly 170,000 Source Crystals!

This number finally allowed Yang Kai to relax somewhat.

He had performed Alchemy for nearly a month in Blue Feather Sect, but only earned 30,000 Source Crystals.

Now, in just half a month, he had earned 170,000. The biggest reason for this was because Source Condensing Pills were high demand products.

After leaving Jin Fu Gui’s shop, Yang Kai continued to wear his black robes as he was not in a hurry to return and instead began touring around the black market.

Good deals could be found in this kind of place, but the probability was very small; after all, there weren’t many cultivators who didn’t know what the quality of the goods they owned was and listed and sold some rare treasure as garbage.

Yang Kai walked around but gained nothing.

Just as he was about to go back home, he suddenly heard a somewhat familiar voice from not far away, one that was filled with a trace of anger and grievance as it shouted, “Why must you be so unreasonable!”

Yang Kai was startled when he heard this voice and the image of a cute, innocent girl flashed across his mind.

[Is that possible?] Yang Kai thought to himself. He had only come to Maplewood City a few days ago and wasn’t familiar with many people here, so there was no way he would mistake this voice for someone else.

Curious, he hurriedly over.

Not far away, a crowd of people was standing around watching a small group of people.

Yang Kai made his way through the crowd and looked inward.

In an instant, his eyes almost popped out of their sockets.

In front of him was a young girl in a long green dress with a slight frown on her face. This girl’s stature was quite petite, but her chest was plentiful. She had a graceful figure, delicate features, and snow-white skin, but her most notable characteristics were the large crescent-shaped birthmark on her cheek, and the few bulging cloth bags hanging on her waist.

[Mo Xiao Qi!]

Yang Kai couldn’t believe his eyes.

It turned out to be Mo Xiao Qi, the innocent girl he had met in Clear Jade Mountain.

[She actually survived?]

Yang Kai could not help breathing a sigh of relief inexplicably when he saw this little girl alive and well, the lingering guilt in his heart disappearing in an instant.

Back on Clear Jade Mountain that day, when the furious Ancient Divine Spirit Luan Feng had released its World Extinguishing Black Flames and wiped out all life within a few hundred kilometres, Mo Xiao Qi had disappeared. Yang Kai was certain she had died and could not help feeling guilty. If he was close enough to Mo Xiao Qi, he could have pulled her into the Sealed World Bead to escape before she was burnt to ashes.

Just because of some discomfort he felt around her, Yang Kai allowed this innocent girl to be killed under the Luan Feng’s anger.

At that time, Yang Kai indeed felt a little guilty. Although he and Mo Xiao Qi weren’t familiar with one another, his impression of her was still quite good. There were very few girls like Mo Xiao Qi in this world. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Seeing her again now, while Yang Kai was delighted, he was also quite curious about how she managed to escape at that time. After all, the Luan Feng’s indiscriminate attack was simply too terrifying. If it were not for his Sealed World Bead, Yang Kai was certain he too would have died that day.

However, when he thought carefully about how the origins of this girl were extremely mysterious and about her dazzling array of high-end artifacts, perhaps... she had an extremely powerful artifact that had somehow allowed her to escape that crisis.

Thinking so, Yang Kai’s evaluation of Mo Xiao Qi rose even higher!

After all, an artifact that could withstand the furious attack of a Luan Feng needed to be at least Emperor Grade. Mo Xiao Qi being able to possess an Emperor Artifact proved that her background was simply unimaginable.

However, at this moment, this young girl with such a strong background was once again involved in trouble.

Opposite her, a group of cultivators stood around a young man like stars surrounding a bright moon. This young man had a jade carved face and a suave appearance, but his pair of wicked eyes kept sweeping over Mo Xiao Qi unscrupulously, lingering quite a bit on her full peaks that could draw the attention of any man.

However, when his gaze shifted to Mo Xiao Qi’s face, he could not help flashing a regretful expression, as if he hated the unfairness of the Heavens and was about to shed tears of blood!
