Just as Yang Kai was preparing to strike while the iron was hot, the Third Disciple suddenly started scratching through her hair, crying her heart out, “Honoured Master, where are you, your disciple can’t find you…”

She fell on the ground, grabbing and pulling her messy hair that was all tangled together.

The bleak, sorrowful, and self-blaming tone was truly hard to listen to and brought tears to one’s eyes.

Zhang Ruo Xi’s eyes had turned red as she glanced at Yang Kai, thinking that if Sir suddenly disappeared one day, she would definitely go looking for him. Even if it was three thousand years, or thirty thousand years, she would never stop just because of the passage of time.

“Honoured Master!” The Third Disciple suddenly tenderly cried before her body rose into the air like a cannonball, shooting towards the depth of the Ancient Lands.

“We need to go after her!” Yang Kai was angry but helpless. What he was angry about was that he had told the Third Disciple the truth but she had completely ignored him, instead triggering this chaotic episode. As for helplessness, it was about the current situation of the Third Disciple that he couldn’t reason with.

For now, he could only chase after her and look for an opportunity to knock her out, even if it would hurt her.

While chasing after her, Yang Kai didn’t hesitate to use his Space Principles, teleporting a few times yet still losing track of her after the time it took for an incense to burn.

It was just like before. Had the Third Disciple not shown up again, he would have never been able to find her.

But the Third Disciple was having a nervous break, so it was impossible for her to show up again on her own. Yang Kai kept running around looking for her, annoyed and frustrated.

He had experienced the Third Disciple’s abilities first hand. She could freely come and go in this damned place, which he couldn’t help but admire.

*Hong long long…*

A series of approaching footsteps and rustles sounded from the distance suddenly. Apparently, many people were approaching. Obviously, the commotion made by Yang Kai and Zhang Ruo Xi while pursuing the Third Disciple had attracted some attention.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow and looked in the direction of the source of the sounds, wondering how so many had suddenly appeared in the Ancient Lands all at once.

He promptly spread his Divine Sense and discovered the aura of an Emperor Realm Master. Furthermore, the aura didn’t seem to belong to a Human.

[Monster Race?] Yang Kai immediately made an educated guess.

After a short while, a group of figures rushed out of one side of the jungle. Each of these figures looked exceptionally fierce, vicious, and ugly. In addition, Monster Qi was emanating from them. With so many gathered in one place, the Monster Qi soared into the sky in an unstoppable manner.

[As I thought, it’s the Monster Race!]

The fellow leading the group of Monster Race Masters was a burly man. He was holding a bone spear, which looked extremely scary. Who knows which Monster Beast’s bones were used to craft it. It was more than five meters long and as thick as a Human leg, but this burly man was holding it with ease. He was wearing a simple animal hide, revealing his strong and robust muscles. Every part of his body was a picture of strength. He was sitting on a steel-back maned boar with two-metre-long tusks pointed upward. Every time this boar breathed it sprayed hot air from his nostrils, and its four hooves kept restlessly digging the ground, its scarlet eyes flickering with a scary gleam.

The pair of Monster Race and Monster Beast looked extremely imposing, like war gods descended to the mortal realm. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

He was obviously a Monster General!

Also, there were about thirty to forty members of Monster Race with different levels of strength on either side of this Monster General, standing in a disorderly manner.

In a flash, several dozen gazes locked onto Yang Kai and Zhang Ruo Xi, sizing them up, with Zhang Ruo Xi being more of a focus than Yang Kai; after all, Zhang Ruo Xi looked beautiful and delicious. Her slim and slender figure always attracted the attention of males, no matter whether the opposite party was from the Human or Monster Race.

The female members of the Monster race, who were wearing revealing clothes, immediately became unhappy and glared at Zhang Ruo Xi with hostility, grinding their teeth and cursing. One or two whispers could be heard, calling her ‘slut’ and the like.

Zhang Ruo Xi, on the other hand, was looking at these Monster Race members who had suddenly rushed out of the jungle with curiosity. She had never seen members of the Monster Race before. She had seen many Monster Beasts, but how could it be that easy to see them take on Human form?

Seeing that they were no different from ordinary people, she couldn’t help but look at them a few more times.

She was showing no fear at all; after all, Yang Kai was by her side. She had complete confidence in her Sir.

“Human, I admire your courage, actually daring to trespass in this King’s territory!” The robust Monster General sitting on the steel-back maned boar pointed the spear in his hand with a majestic sweep.

Yang Kai’s brow momentarily twitched as he had no idea how to respond.

He knew that many Monster Races were living in the Ancient Wild Lands. Monster Beasts were different from members of the Monster Race as most Monster Beasts weren’t sentient, only surviving on wild instincts and absorbing World Energy to cultivate naturally. Although their lifespan was generally quite long, it was difficult for them to improve their strength quickly, much less assume Human form.

Those classified as members of the Monster Race were different. Although they stemmed from Monster Beasts, they were sentient and knew how to cultivate more effectively. Some even knew how to cultivate Secret Arts.

In the entire Ancient Wild Lands, the Monster Race was the strongest force. In addition to the Monster Race, there were many Primordial Species. These Primordial Species included countless near-extinct races that while small in number, were all extremely powerful because of their ancient bloodlines. All Primordial Species could unleash some unimaginable abilities.

Yang Kai wasn’t clear about the distribution of forces in the Ancient Lands as the only information he had was the things recorded in the jade slip given to him by Pi San. Naturally, this jade slip didn’t have comprehensive information and just gave a brief rundown about the outer areas of the Ancient Lands.

Seeing this team of Monster Race cultivators appear, Yang Kai immediately knew that while pursuing Ice Heart Valley’s Third Elder, he had inadvertently rushed into the territory of this Monster General.

“Kill, kill, kill!” The crowd of Monster Race suddenly started chanting. If someone ignorant of the situation saw this, he might think that this group of Monster Race was a group of bandits who were blocking the road to rob and pillage. It was a funny sight.

“This King has a question for you!” The Monster General reined in his Monster Beast mount while keeping his bone spear pointed at Yang Kai as he asked with no trace of politeness, “Have you seen a crazy woman?”

[Is he talking about Bing Yun’s Third Disciple?]

Yang Kai didn’t want to get involved with the Monster Race, but by the looks of it, they had obviously seen the Third Disciple, so Yang Kai immediately shouted, “Have you seen her?”

The Monster General blew his top seeing this and pushed his Monster Qi madly, rebuking with a cold snort, “It’s this King who will ask the questions here! If you don’t want to suffer, obediently answer this King! Otherwise, I will let you know how fearsome this King is.”

Determining that civil discourse was impossible with this fellow, Yang Kai decided to start talking with his fists instead, grinning as he taunted, “I’d like to see you try.”

The Monster General sneered, “Since you’re courting death, then don’t blame this King for showing no mercy!” While remaining seated on his mount, he waved his hand as he ordered aloud, “Kill the man, capture the woman!”

Just as he shouted the order, the thirty or forty members of Monster Race howled and acted as swiftly as the wind. In a flash, waves of Monster Qi spread into the surrounding area, lifting up the leaves into a flurry which they charged through to attack Yang Kai with reckless abandon.

[What the…] Yang Kai was stunned. He had known that the Monster Race was simple-minded, but he hadn’t expected them to be so dull. Before they even assessed the strength of their opponent, they all swarmed forward, as if they feared being late to the fight.

[It must have been really hard for the Monster Race to survive in the Ancient Lands for this long.]

However, Yang Kai’s vision was now higher, owing to his higher strength.

In any case, this group of Monster Race was led by a Monster General, and there were many of them. More importantly, the Human cultivators were usually suppressed by the Wild Force present here, so even if they ran into a Second-Order Emperor Realm Human, they could attack like this without any fear.

After so many years, many Emperors had lost their lives to the Monster Race like this. Furthermore, if a cultivator was not strong, how could they survive in the Ancient Lands for so long? They would have long died in a place like this where there was no peace.

The Monster Race group rushed in, unleashing all kinds of techniques. Many of them revealed their true bodies halfway through. In a flash, various strange Monster Beasts were seen galloping everywhere, showcasing all kinds of Monster Race Secret Techniques. The world instantly lost colour in the chaotic storm.

The Monster General, on the other hand, remained seated in the rear, coldly observing everything.

A giant python spewed a breath of poisonous mist, covering Yang Kai and the space around him, blinding him to his surroundings.

Inside the poisonous mist, a figure suddenly appeared and leapt at Yang Kai, its fangs shining with a cold gleam. It was a wolf-type Monster Beast that had launched a sneak attack under the cover of the poisonous mist.

*Zheng…*

A soft metallic cry rang out as a cold gleam flashed. Yang Kai remained standing in place, as if he hadn’t moved at all, but the Myriads Sword had at some point appeared in his hand.

The giant wolf flew past him, its scarlet eyes crazily flickering as if it had seen something terrifying.

After crashing to the ground, it uncontrollably slid forward before a squishing sound rang out and blood gushed from its neck like a fountain. Its head separated from his body as its body constantly twitched.

It was only an Eleventh-Order Monster Beast, so even if it had launched a sneak attack under the cover of the poisonous fog, it wasn’t Yang Kai’s opponent and was killed in a single blow.

*Xiu xiu xiu…*

Seven or eight members of the Monster Race showed their true bodies and rushed into the mist together, biting from all directions.

Yang Kai stood stalwart, releasing flashes of light one after another.

Splattering sounds echoed to no end as all the Monster Race attacking him flew past him, splitting into two in the air, their blood and internal organs dying the ground red as miserable wails rose and fell everywhere.

The remaining Monster Race members instantly quieted down and halted their charge right then and there. All of them were staring with widened eyes as a look of shock covered their faces. They hadn’t expected Yang Kai to be so powerful.

*Dida dida…*

Only the sound of blood dripping down the Myriads Sword could be heard, but to the members of the Monster Race, this light dripping was like a death knell deafening their ears, making them tremble in fright.

At this point, they finally noticed that Yang Kai was a little different from the Humans they had encountered before. He didn’t seem easy to mess with.

“Boy, how dare you! To have killed so many of my men. This King will send you to Hell!” The Monster General, who was originally sitting in the rear, continuously leering at Zhang Ruo Xi, blew his top when he noticed that over ten of his men had died in just the blink of an eye. He spurred his mount as he charged at Yang Kai with his spear.

Who knows what kind of exotic beast the steel-back maned boar was, but its speed was so fast that its limbs instantly blurred. The enormous trees in its path, which could only be hugged by several people working together, all broke under its charge, proof of how powerful it was.

As soon as the Monster General made his move, his subordinates naturally avoided and went to trouble Zhang Ruo Xi.

Yang Kai coldly snorted as he slid his finger across the Myriads Sword, a serious look appearing on his face as he mumbled, “Myriads Sword Arts, Radiant Moon Swallows the Wolf!”

*Chi Chi Chi…*

The sword danced around as thousands of Sword Qi blades shot towards the surroundings like a shower.
