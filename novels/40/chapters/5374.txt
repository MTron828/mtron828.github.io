Chapter 5375, Getting His Confidence Shattered

A dilapidated Warship moved across the battlefield and entered Great Evolution Pass. A figure jumped out of the Warship and directly landed on the wall. Then, he brusquely sat down beside Yang Kai and panted.

He looked just as battered as Yang Kai.

However, he flashed a smile at Yang Kai and teased, “You look terrible, Brother Yang. Are you alright?”

Despite his caring tone, Yang Kai could see the smugness behind his gaze.

After giving it some thought, Yang Kai soon realised why the other party behaved in such a way, so he replied with a smile, “I’m fine. The injury doesn’t matter. You look badly wounded as well, so you’d better focus on recuperating now, Brother Chai.”

The person was none other than Chai Fang, Squad Leader of the Old Turtles.

The Warship that had returned from the battlefield belonged to the Old Turtle Squad.

The Old Turtles’ Warship was extremely robust, and all the members had specially cultivated defensive Secret Techniques. Usually, they had enough stamina to last for the entire war.

However, in order to hold down a Territory Lord previously, they activated a powerful barrier on the Warship and entrapped the enemy. In that area of sealed void, they engaged in a life-and-death battle with the Territory Lord.

By the time that battle ended, the Old Turtles had suffered immense damage. Their Warship was almost destroyed, so they had no choice but to leave the battlefield.

In fact, many Human soldiers had retreated from the battlefield as they were no longer able to fight. If they insisted on staying on the battlefield, they wouldn’t be useful at all and instead would be a burden.

Even though Chai Fang was severely wounded, he was energetic. Hearing Yang Kai’s words, he waved his hand, “I’m fine. This kind of injury doesn’t matter.”

Perhaps his movement had irritated his wounds though, so blood started leaking out of his wounds again. As a result, his face turned pale and his aura weakened.

Yang Kai and Cha Pu glanced at him, speechless.

Chai Fang coughed and hurriedly activated his power to seal the wounds. Pretending to be nonchalant, he remarked, “The Territory Lord was indeed powerful. It’s hard to heal these wounds, so I guess it’ll take me a long time to recuperate.”

While Yang Kai remained silent, Cha Pu didn’t bother to respond to him.

Chai Fang went on to say, “There were originally around 80 Territory Lords in Great Evolution Theatre, but after this war, only a small number of them will be able to escape alive. I hope the Old Ancestor and the others can kill them all. If any one of them survives, it will be troublesome for us in the future.”

Yang Kai grunted, “You have a point.”

Cha Pu was annoyed at the fact that Chai Fang kept mentioning the Territory Lords, so he glared at him and snapped, “What do you want to say?”

Therefore, he decided to stop beating around the bush. He winked at Yang Kai and asked, “Did you see me killing a Territory Lord earlier, Brother Yang?”

Cha Pu was growing increasingly frustrated at the fact that Chai Fang was so blatantly fishing for compliments.

He knew that there was a reason why this brat came all the way here to have a chat with them instead of recuperating. [So, he’s trying to show off here!]

Of course, it couldn’t really be considered bragging. As a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he had indeed pulled off a magnificent feat by killing a Territory Lord. Although it was the Old Ancestor who had crippled the Territory Lord at the end, Chai Fang was the one who delivered the killing blow.

Usually, Cha Pu would’ve praised him and given him some words of encouragement. Nevertheless, he was in a terrible mood, so he couldn’t bear to see anyone bragging in front of him and directly said, “Yang Kai also killed a Territory Lord. A guy named Che Kong.”

An unfazed Chai Fang batted his eyes, “Isn’t it normal that he managed to kill a Territory Lord? It’s not like it’s the first time he did so.”

All the soldiers in Great Evolution Pass knew that Yang Kai was an anomaly whose power couldn’t be gauged by his Order.

Chai Fang didn’t intend to compare himself with Yang Kai. The fact that Yang Kai had killed a Territory Lord wouldn’t water down his joy of pulling off the same feat.

Cha Pu let out a grumble. He wasn’t willing to shatter the other party’s confidence, but he was upset at how smug Chai Fang looked, so in a muffled voice, he said, “He also killed the Ninth-Order Black Ink Disciple with one punch.”

Hearing that, Chai Fang widened his eyes in disbelief and dazedly stared at Cha Pu as though he was trying to find out if the other party was pulling his leg.

Chai Fang wasn’t aware of this fact. When the Royal Lord and the Ninth-Order Black Ink Disciple were killed, he and the rest of the Old Turtles were still battling against the Territory Lord in a sealed space, so he had no idea about what was going on in the outside world.

It wasn’t until the Old Ancestor made a move and injured the Territory Lord that Chai Fang seized the chance to kill the enemy. Only then did the sealed space fully open up.

Cha Pu ignored him as he didn’t bother to explain anything. Regardless of whether Chai Fang believed him or not, there were a lot of eyewitnesses to prove his claim.

It was then that Chai Fang turned to look at Yang Kai and gulped, “Brother Yang, did you… did you really kill the Ninth-Order Black Ink Disciple?”

The Ninth-Order Black Ink Disciple’s aura could no longer be felt on the battlefield, so Chai Fang thought that the Old Ancestor had killed him. If Cha Pu wasn’t lying though, the truth of the matter was far more shocking.

Yang Kai smiled modestly, “I was just lucky. The Old Ancestor had already brought him up to the gates of death, all I did was push him in.”

Since Yang Kai had acknowledged it, there was no denying it was indeed the truth. He wouldn’t have taken the credit if he hadn’t made such a contribution.

Chai Fang fell into a dazed state. Was it possible that Yang Kai had killed a Ninth-Order Black Ink Disciple with a punch?

Even though Yang Kai was indeed an outlier and the Black Ink Disciple had been wounded by the Old Ancestor, the enemy was still a Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

Chai Fang placed his hand on his forehead as he felt dizzy all of a sudden.

Beside him, Cha Pu snorted. Chai Fang shouldn’t have bragged about his achievement in front of Yang Kai, it was the epitome of showing off meagre skill before a Master. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

With that said, he understood Chai Fang’s feelings. It wasn’t news anymore that Yang Kai had killed quite a number of Territory Lords despite being a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so it was pointless for him to brag about such achievements. It seemed that Chai Fang just wanted to get Yang Kai to acknowledge his win this time.

All of a sudden, Chai Fang turned to look at Cha Pu and asked caringly, “You’re badly wounded as well, Senior Cha. How many Territory Lords did you kill?”

He didn’t intend to irritate Cha Pu, it was simply meant to be a random question.

However, the moment these words were spoken, Cha Pu’s eyes went bloodshot as he landed a kick on the braggart and yelled, “Scram!”

An unsuspecting Chai Fang was sent flying away. While in mid-air, he groaned in pain as blood spurted from his wounds.

Yang Kai almost failed to stifle his laughter.

Cha Pu glowered at him before straightening up and turning around.

[Damn it! I can’t stay in this place anymore! These little brats are just too full of themselves! Both of them had killed Territory Lords and Yang Boy even executed a Ninth-Order Black Ink Disciple! As an Eighth-Order Master, I haven’t made any contributions so far! I can’t let this stand!]

The next moment, he roared and charged towards the battlefield despite being injured while Yang Kai watched him leave in shock.

…

While it was peaceful in Great Evolution Pass, the chaos on the battlefield didn’t last long.

After Mo Zhao and the Ninth-Order Black Ink Disciple were killed, all the Black Ink Clansmen knew that the war was lost. The Humans would soon occupy the entire Great Evolution Theatre.

The surviving Territory Lords and Feudal Lords all attempted to run for their lives.

Nevertheless, the Eighth-Order Masters and the surviving Squads would never let them go. The battlefield, which was already vast to begin with, rapidly expanded.

Within just one hour, the void around the Royal City and Great Evolution Pass was cleared out. Only debris from Warships and the corpses of the Humans and Black Ink Clansmen floated about, an illustration of how brutal the war had been.

It would take the Human Masters some time to hunt down the remaining Black Ink Clansmen, so the matter couldn’t be resolved quickly.

Yang Kai had been recuperating on the wall for the past two days, and while the injuries to his Soul and Small Universe were on the mend, his flesh wounds had exacerbated instead of getting better because of the Black Ink Disciple’s Sword Qi.

This didn’t really bother him as he had a Dragon Vein, so although he wasn’t in peak condition, there were no powerful Black Ink Clansmen left, so he wasn’t required to fight.

Gradually, more and more Squads returned. Despite being soaked in blood, they all appeared energetic. It was apparent that they had made a lot of contributions.

When Yang Kai regained some strength two days later, he flew out towards the original battlefield and wandered around the wreckage and corpses. Soon, he found a dim-looking feather which belonged to Huang Si Niang.

As he examined the feather, he let out a sigh.

Just like what he had expected, Huang Si Niang’s Soul Clone had been destroyed as this feather had lost all spirituality. The feather now looked tattered and had almost broken in half.

The power of Huang Si Niang’s Soul Clone was equivalent to a peak Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Although she could exert more power than others in the same relative Realm as a Divine Spirit, this was just a Soul Clone after all. Holding back a Territory Lord was already the best she could achieve.

Yang Kai had no idea what happened to the Territory Lord who dealt with her Soul Clone as, at that time, he was focused on fighting with Che Kong, so he couldn’t pay attention to other things.

After Che Kong was killed, Mo Zhao was subsequently felled. Following that, Yang Kai was attacked by the Ninth-Order Black Ink Disciple, so he didn’t have time to find out what happened to the Soul Clone.

Now, the Black Ink Clan had lost the war and the Eighth-Order Masters and the Old Ancestors had left to hunt down the surviving enemies. Even if those Territory Lords had survived for now, their fate was essentially sealed.

Yang Kai stored the feather and decided that he would pass it back to Huang Si Niang when he visited the No-Return Pass in the future.

He wondered if she would reprimand him. The Soul Clone hadn’t stayed with him for long before he summoned it to fight an enemy it couldn’t hope to defeat. It indeed wasn’t righteous of him to do so.

As he recalled Huang Si Niang’s temperament, he knew that he would inevitably be given a harsh lecture.

As some returned to Great Evolution Pass, others departed.

The ones leaving had initially remained in Great Evolution Pass to make use of the emplacements on the walls. Now that the Black Ink Clan had fled from the local battlefield, they no longer had to remain here. Therefore, many drove their Warships out to hunt down the enemies, leaving only several hundred people behind to guard the Great Pass.

Great Evolution Pass still needed to be guarded, so it wasn’t like all of them could just leave. After all, many people were still recuperating in the Inner Sanctum.

Many people also silently moved around the battlefield and collected the corpses of their fallen Brothers and Sisters.

Many of the Human soldiers who died in the war didn’t even leave behind a corpse, so it could be said that other than their names on the Monument of Heroes, there was nothing left to remember them by.

It was because of these Humans who were willing to sacrifice their lives that the survivors were finally able to occupy the entire Great Evolution Theatre.

The Humans had won this war, and the victory belonged to all the soldiers who had made contributions on the Black Ink Battlefield.

Yang Kai composed himself before sweeping a glance over this vast battlefield and letting out a sigh.

He hoped that there would be no more war on the Black Ink Battlefield after this, and the 3,000 Worlds would finally be able to enjoy eternal peace.
