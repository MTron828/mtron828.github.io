“Then, it is now my turn, right?” As Yang Kai said that, his expression suddenly sank, “Where is the couple that arrived with us in Human Imperial City? Are they alive or dead?”

The Human Sovereign laughed, “You’re asking two questions.”

Yang Kai shrugged, “The earlier one doesn’t count.”

“They’re still alive. How did you manage to enter Human Imperial City through the Space Array without possessing the Human Sovereign Seal?”

Raising his hand, Yang Kai gave the space before him a pat, causing it to cave in and collapse, as though a piece from a complete puzzle had been shifted out of place. Although it quickly returned back to normal, this could be classified as a shockingly brilliant move.

A look of understanding appeared on the Human Sovereign’s face, “So that’s how it is!”

Yang Kai continued, “May I know how Human Sovereign will deal with that couple?”

“Death!”

Yang Kai’s expression turned blank, “How is that reasonable? Liao Guan Shi was killed by me, and that couple had just happened to be in the same place; neither did they take any action to help me, so why kill them? Aren’t you having too much disregard for people’s lives, Sir?”

The Human Sovereign grinned at him.

Yang Kai coughed lightly, “Your turn to ask.”

The Human Sovereign suddenly turned his gaze towards the little black dog in Zhu Qing’s bosom and asked, “Is that beast a Demon Beast?”

“Yes!” Yang Kai nodded his head in agreement, “Although its bloodline isn’t pure, it is indeed a Demon Beast!”

The faces of the Imperial Family members changed drastically upon hearing his words as they looked with incomparable shock at the little dog, before turning back to look at Yang Kai and Zhu Qing with extreme vigilance.

Yang Kai asked, “So can you answer my earlier question now?”

The Human Sovereign replied, “Not reporting the matter is the reason for them to be killed.”

Yang Kai sneered coldly, “How imposing of you, Sir.”

“Looks like you care a lot about those two. In accordance with what I know, you don’t even know their names, right? You don’t have any relationship with them either.”

“I don’t know what their names are; however, I did not kill them, yet they will die for me, how can a person feel at ease about such a thing?”

“You’re unexpectedly kind-hearted.” The Human Sovereign nodded slightly, before his gaze flicked like a bolt of lighting towards Yang Kai, “Are you of the Demon Race?”

Yang Kai sneered coldly in response, “If I was a Demon, I would have already obliterated your Human Imperial Palace rather than sit here and chatting with you.”

“This Sovereign also feels the same. Nevertheless, a confirmation is required to be on the safe side.”

“You may rest assured that we husband and wife ended up in this place by accident, and have no interest in your Human Imperial City whatsoever.” Yang Kai sneered, “What needs to be done for you to let those two people go?”

The Human Sovereign replied in an indifferent tone, “If you two leave Human Imperial City and never set foot here again, this Sovereign will release them.”

Yang Kai frowned, “As long as I can find the way home, this Young Master will immediately leave, why would I want to stay in your Human Imperial City? If you want us to leave, we will have to ask Sir to guide the way.”

The Human Sovereign shook his head, “The Revolving World is easy to enter, but hard to leave. This world has existed for tens of thousands of years, yet no one has ever left.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Being able to enter naturally means that one can also leave, we just have to find a suitable method to do so. If Sir really wants us to leave as soon as possible, it would be best for you to not conceal anything.”

The Human Sovereign shook his head, “I really do not know.”

Yang Kai’s forehead wrinkled up, as he felt that this Human Sovereign didn’t seem to be lying, so there was basically no point in continuing to pursue this line of questioning. As such, he could only let out a depressed sigh, “Sir, I can understand why you wish for us to leave; however, if there’s no way out of here, what should we do?”

“Although the Revolving World isn’t large, it also isn’t small. With your strength, you two should have the ability to contend against the Demon Race should you encounter them. Other than Human Imperial City, you two can head to the other cities.”

Yang Kia pursed his lips, “Aren’t you being too irresponsible, Sir? If that’s the case, we’ll stay put in Human Imperial City for a period of time.”

The Human Sovereign narrowed his eyes, “If that is the case, this Sovereign has no other choice but to try his best to fight you. I hope you two also have the mental preparation to enter the Yellow Springs together.”

As he said those words, an exceedingly dazzling jade-green glow suddenly erupted from his body. His entire person seemed to have turned younger by a few hundred years, while an overbearing pressure surged out from him.

A frown appeared on Yang Kai’s face in response, as he could instinctually sense that this old fellow wasn’t someone that was easy to deal with. At that instant, the former seemed to have established an unbreakable connection with the Sacred Tree, granting him access to unlimited power which caused him to give off a feeling of invincibility.

Not only that, but this phenomenon also happened to the surrounding Imperial Princes and Princesses, as all of them stared covetously at Yang Kai and Zhu Qing.

Provoked by their surging auras, the Dragon Essence within Zhu Qing’s body started to churn as her face turned chilly.

Patting her shoulder, Yang Kai signalled for her to calm down, before speaking out with a faint smile, “There’s no need to be that nervous, Sir. Truthfully speaking, we can leave Human Imperial City. You just need to accept two of my requests and we will depart.”

The Human Sovereign nodded, “Speak.”

Yang Kai raised a finger, “Release those two unrelated people. They did not go against your will.”

The Human Sovereign replied, “Their lives are not of importance compared to your decision.”

Yang Kai smiled faintly, “I’ll take that as a yes. My second condition is… I want to see the Sacred Tree!”

“Impudence!” The Third Imperial Prince and Second Princess growled in unison, as though they had been humiliated by Yang Kai’s words.

Yang Kai glared coldly at them, “Is this a hard request to fulfil? How impudent is it?”

The Second Imperial Princess replied, “The Sacred Tree is the foundation of our Human Imperial City! Since the beginning, only members of the Imperial Family have been allowed to approach it! Who are you to make such an outrageous request!” She turned towards the Human Sovereign, “Imperial Father, your daughter beseeches you to grant me the authority to kill these people who are clearly harbouring ulterior motives!”

Having just suffered a big loss at Yang Kai’s hands and losing all face, the Second Princess had been trying to find any means possible to retaliate. At this moment, with the opportunity presenting itself, she naturally didn’t hold back in engaging in a confrontation against Yang Kai. Although this couple seemed to be extremely strong, the Imperial Family was the strongest within Human Imperial City. As long as the Human Sovereign took action, this couple would not be able to cause any mayhem, no matter how strong they were.

As if he hadn’t heard anything Fu Yu had said, the Human Sovereign looked deeply at Yang Kai, “What is your reason for this request?”

Yang Kai shrugged, “It’s purely out of curiosity. I just want to know exactly what the Sacred Tree is and why it is able to provide such incredible blessings.”

The Human Sovereign replied, “What if this Sovereign doesn’t agree?”

Yang Kai chuckled lightly, before his laugh halted as he replied in a chilling voice, “Then we’ll have to see if your Imperial Family or we husband and wife are more formidable! In any case, I will get to see the Sacred Tree.”

“Shameless boasting!” Fu Yu erupted with fury, “Imperial Father, your daughter is willing to take the lead and make sure this little brat knows the might of our Imperial Family!”

Yang Kai shot a sidelong gaze at her, “Disgraceful. How about this Young Master teaches you another lesson on how to show proper respect?”

Fu Yu was seething with anger, and was barely able to hold herself back from attacking Yang Kai to reclaim her dignity. Even though she wasn’t a match for him, it was still better than letting him speak so impudently. Nevertheless, without an order from the Human Sovereign, she didn’t dare to recklessly take action.

“Are you adamant on seeing it?” The Human Sovereign suddenly opened his mouth and looked solemnly at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, “I hope Sir can fulfil this little wish of mine.”

The Human Sovereign closed his eyes and seemed to enter deep thought, appearing to struggle in making a decision. After a long while, his eyes suddenly snapped open and he spoke, “Answer one more of this Sovereign’s questions.”

Yang Kai nodded his head, “Go ahead!”

The Human Sovereign’s eyes narrowed slightly, “How are you able to use the Sacred Techniques and borrow the strength of the Sacred Tree?”

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “Sir should have already guessed it, so why the need for this question?”

“Although I already have my suspicions, I still do not dare to believe them. In accordance with what I understand, the Ancient Shamanic Spells have long disappeared from Star Boundary, so how are you able to display them?”

“I managed to learn one or two moves by chance, and was just showing my meagre skills before an expert like you, Sir.”

The Human Sovereign shook his head slowly, clearly not satisfied with Yang Kai’s reply to his question. Other than this explanation though, he was unable to come up with a better answer to this question of his.

Just as Yang Kai had guessed earlier, the Sacred Tree did not solely protect the Imperial Family, but all Shamans. Within Human Imperial City, only the Imperial Family members were allowed to borrow the power of the Sacred Tree to cultivate Shamanic Strength and become Shamans. This had allowed the Imperial Family members to appear special within Human Imperial City.

Over the past tens of thousands of years here, there were cases of people from the Star Boundary entering Human Imperial City, and Human Imperial City had very detailed records of these outsiders. When consolidated, these records from those outsiders’ world could basically explain the developmental history of the Star Boundary.

The changes in the World Principles had caused Shaman Strength to gradually be replaced by Yuan Qi. Indeed, the Ancient Shamanic Spells had long gone extinct. Yet, there was a living example in the form of Yang Kai present right before him, leaving the Human Sovereign no choice but to treat the latter with importance.

“This Sovereign can agree with your request, but I hope that you too can keep to your promise,” The Human Sovereign finally relented.

He wasn’t willing to start a fight with Yang Kai, who could similarly display Sacred Techniques, and borrow the strength of the Sacred Tree. If they really were to fight, it would absolutely end up in a situation of mutual destruction. Furthermore, the woman by Yang Kai’s side wasn’t an ordinary character either, she seemed to hail from the legendary Divine Spirit Dragon Clan!

Although the Sacred Techniques could suppress ordinary Third-Order Emperors, they were still lacking in power when compared to a true member of the Dragon Clan.

The Second Princess seemed to wish to say something, but her words caught in her throat before she could voice them.

She knew the Human Sovereign had already made his decision, so anything she said now would be futile.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, “Please rest assured, Sir, I’m a man of my word. Naturally, I hope that Sir will not trouble that couple anymore and let them go as soon as possible.”

The Human Sovereign nodded lightly, “Follow me.”

As he replied, he had already flown towards the outside.

Yang Kai and Zhu Qing followed suit behind him, with the other Imperial Princes and Princesses in hot pursuit. The Second Princess glared at Yang Kai’s back, her eyes brimming with incomparable hatred, as though she could not wait to rip his corpse into ten thousand pieces, yet was unable to proceed as she wished.

The Third Imperial Prince moved to her side and whispered, “Imperial Father knows what he is doing, so why the hurry?”

Fu Yu was shocked by his words, causing her to look back at him with a peculiar gaze, “Third Brother, are you saying…”

The Third Imperial Price moved past her before transmitting back, “I didn’t say anything.”

An extraordinary splendour flashed across the Second Princess’s eyes while excitement surged in her heart as she started to fill up with anticipation.

The Sacred Tree was located in the deepest part of the Imperial Palace, with Masters standing guard in all directions. There were clearly a few dozen people specially protecting this place, all of whom were Emperor Realm Masters, and there were also some powerful auras that were concealed in the darkness.

The Human Sovereign took the lead, causing those guards to move forward to greet him, but upon seeing Yang Kai and Zhu Qing, confused looks appeared on their faces, as they did not recognise these two people.
