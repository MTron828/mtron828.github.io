Since Protector Bian wanted to see Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun, the two Bone Prison guards did not dare disobey. Quickly entering the Bone Prison, they brought the pair out.

‚ÄúKid, the deal this old master offered will remain valid. If you have nowhere else to turn to, you can come and find this old master.‚Äù

Just when Yang Kai was about to leave the Bone Prison, Wu Meng Chuan‚Äôs voice rang in his ears again.

Yang Kai continued walking as if he hadn‚Äôt heard anything and soon departed, leaving only the envy-filled gazes of the other imprisoned cultivators in the Bone Prison behind.

Once outside, Yang Kai immediately felt a hate-filled glare being directed at him. Turning towards the source, he saw a gloomy-looking Yan Xiu Ran.

He was responsible for guarding the entrance to the Bone Prison, so of course he was here.

Yang Kai had killed and eaten his Treasure Seizing Snake, causing Yan Xiu Ran to harbour deep hatred towards Yang Kai. The torture that Yang Kai had suffered these days was all due to his instigation.

‚ÄúBrat, you should thank your good luck that Protector Bian found time to see you, but don‚Äôt get too comfortable. One day, you will fall into my hands again, and then Father here will show you what a life worse than death really means!‚Äù Yan Xiu Ran Yin sneered wickedly.

Yang Kai gave him a faint, indifferent look, while he was cursing his eighteen generations of ancestors on the inside. He hated his lack of strength. If he was strong enough, he would simply kill all these Blue Feather Sect disciples on the spot.

However, he knew he did not have the strength to fight back, and it would only end miserably for him if he tried to resist, so for now, all he could do was grit his teeth and endure, turning a deaf ear to Yan Xiu Ran‚Äôs provocation.

‚ÄúGood, good. Senior Brother Yan, don‚Äôt be angry. Protector Bian wants to see these two people right away, so we can‚Äôt delay,‚Äù the Bone Prison guards smiled slightly as he faintly spoke to Yan Xiu Ran before waving his hand and summoning something.

It was a flight-type artifact, but completely different from the ship that Senior Brother Kou had used. This flight-type artifact looked more like a chariot and was noticeably smaller than Senior Brother Kou‚Äôs. However, it was still big enough to easily hold five people, and gave off a threatening aura.

The owner of the chariot jumped up before immediately waving his hand and dragging Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun up as well. Soon, the chariot turned into a streamer and shot towards the centre of Blue Feather Mountain.

The journey went by silently.

Eventually, the chariot came to a certain mountain peak, at the top of which was a massive palace.

After Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun got out of the chariot, the Bone Prison guard took back his flight-type artifact before moving forward and speaking to the guards outside the palace.

‚ÄúGo in, Protector Bian is waiting inside,‚Äù The palace guard did not make things difficult and simply allowed them to pass.

‚ÄúGood luck to the two of you!‚Äù The Bone Prison guards did not follow, simply smiling meaningfully towards Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun before summoning the chariot again and returning the way they came. Follow the latest novels ùíêùíè nùíê/velbin(.)com

Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun looked at each other, not knowing whether this was a blessing or a curse that could not be avoided. So, they had no choice but to bite the bullet and secretly prayed that Protector Bian was not a person who was hard to talk to.

At this moment, the two of them still had their cultivations sealed and were incapable of raising a fuss in front of the Blue Feather Sect masters.

Ignoring the curious looks of the guards, Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun walked into the palace step by step.

Inside the palace, at the head of a spacious hall, two people were waiting for them.

As soon as Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun appeared, the eyes of these two focused on them.

In an instant, Yang Kai tensed up as he felt like he was being thoroughly examined, an extremely uncomfortable sensation.

Looking towards the sources of these piercing gazes, Yang Kai could not help raising his brow.

He found that one of the two in the hall was the Senior Brother Kou who had captured him. He was standing next to a beautiful woman with a graceful figure and a charming visage.

This woman wore a light blue palace dress and was lazily lying on a long chair. Her hair was done up in a bun, exposing her jade white neck, and she was currently fiddling with something in her hand, a faint smile on her face as she looked at Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun with great interest.

This woman was extremely charming, a true Heavenly beauty, but Yang Kai felt a pressure from her that made him not dare look at her directly!

[Is this woman Protector Bian?] Yang Kai was shocked.

‚ÄúAre these the two you caught a few days ago?‚Äù When Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun approached, the beautiful woman asked lightly.

Her voice was sweet and sensuous, to the point where it felt like it was gently caressing one‚Äôs heart, drawing out the inner desires one kept hidden within themselves.

As for who she was speaking to, it was obviously Senior Brother Kou.

Senior Brother Kou hurriedly bowed his head and lowered his eyes, as if afraid to look at this beautiful woman as he replied respectfully, ‚ÄúReporting to Lady Protector, these are indeed the two who were recently captured!‚Äù

The beautiful woman nodded lightly as her elegant eyes flashed a sharp light, her red lips curving upwards slightly as she said, ‚ÄúRelease their seals.‚Äù

Senior Brother Kou immediately formed a seal with his hand before pushing his palm towards Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun.

Two streaks of light shot out and pierced into their bodies.

In the next moment, Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun both let out a slight groan as they felt their strength begin to circulate again.

‚ÄúHehe...‚Äù The beautiful woman suddenly laughed and slowly raised her jade hand under the dumbfounded gazes of Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun.

As she raised her hand though, whether it was Yang Kai or Liu Xian Yun, they both felt that something had suddenly changed in the atmosphere around them, turning it thick and tense and causing the pair‚Äôs complexions to become solemn.

Senior Brother Kou seemed to have expected this from the start and was not surprised at all, instead just observing the reactions of Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun indifferently.

The beautiful woman gently pressed her jade palm forward next, causing the surrounding World Energy to condense into a terrifying attack that covered Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing!?‚Äù Liu Xian Yun exclaimed as such hurriedly bit the top of her tongue and spat out a mouthful of her Blood Essence onto a mirror-like artifact she summoned into her hands.

As soon as the artifact appeared, it split into two, then into four, then into eight... In an instant, countless small mirrors were surrounding Liu Xian Yun, each one reflecting a brilliant blue light like the deepest ocean, releasing a powerful and imposing aura.

She knew that her opponent this time was a Dao Source Realm master, and likely a peak-level one at that, so she did not hesitate to use her strongest artifact to defend herself.

She did not even think about contending with the beautiful woman and focused solely on enduring the incoming attack.

Yang Kai also let out a roar as he pushed his Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi while simultaneously flicking his ten fingers and releasing all of his Golden Blood Threads towards the sky to intercept the terrifying palm.

*Chi chi chi chi...*

With a wind-cutting sound, the Golden Blood Threads launched a barrage of attacks under Yang Kai‚Äôs control, but just like snow in the early spring encountering the scorching sun, they were all melted and blown away.

Liu Xian Yun also let out a roar of defiance as the mirrors gathered atop her and Yang Kai‚Äôs heads.

*Huala...*

The next moment, the mirrors all shattered, and Liu Xian Yun‚Äôs face turned white as she coughed up a mouthful of blood. The mirror-like artifact reverted to its original form as well, and was now only releasing a dim light.

Taking this opportunity, Yang Kai soared into the sky as he gathered all of his Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi onto his hand and sliced apart what was left of the falling palm, finally dispersing its might.

Twisting mid-air, he next plunged towards the beautiful woman who was still laying down lazily on her chair.

The beautiful woman did not move at all as she just smiled lightly as Yang Kai approached.

Senior Brother Kou, who was standing behind her, made a move at that moment as he pushed his palm towards Yang Kai.

This palm seemed quite simple, but there was a violent power swirling about it and as soon as Yang Kai came into contact with it, he felt his defences being smashed through like they were made of rotten wood, unable to block any of the impact at all.

With a stuffy grunt, he was forced backwards.

Liu Xian Yun looked flustered as she felt that they were really doomed to die this time. Recognizing this reality, she grit her teeth and pushed all the strength she had as she charged towards the beautiful woman and Senior Brother Kou.

If she had to die, she would do so fighting!

‚ÄúXian Yun, stand down!‚Äù Yang Kai was still mid-air as he shouted loudly, crashing to the ground a moment later in an embarrassing state.

Hearing Yang Kai‚Äôs call, Liu Xian Yun stopped her advance, but she continued to stare warily towards the front as she maintained a battle stance.

The beautiful woman laughed happily as her beautiful eyes began scrutinizing Yang Kai again before she nodded lightly, ‚ÄúKou Wu, what did I say? They really were able to block my blow, yes?‚Äù

Kou Wu heard this and bowed his head, ‚ÄúMilady‚Äôs vision is indeed sharp, this Kou Wu has nothing but praise!‚Äù

The beautiful woman giggled as her proud peaks trembled lightly. Pursing her lips, she waved her hand lightly and said, ‚ÄúDispense with the flattery. Although this Queen only used a bit of her strength just now, the two of them being able to resist is still quite impressive.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is as Milady says,‚Äù Kou Wu nodded again.

The conversation between the two was done out loud without any attempt at concealment, so Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun naturally heard it clearly. Yang Kai did not show any surprise, while Liu Xian Yun frowned slightly in dissatisfaction at being toyed with.

‚ÄúYou seem to have noticed, yes?‚Äù The beautiful woman turned to look at Yang Kai and asked unhurriedly.

Yang Kai wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and grinned, ‚ÄúIf Senior really wanted to kill us, why bother bringing us here? The previous attack was obviously a test.‚Äù

The beautiful woman heard this and smiled, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an interesting one little boy. Then, do you know why this Queen wanted to see you in the first place?‚Äù

Yang Kai frowned hearing this and quickly said, ‚ÄúPlease enlighten us, Senior!‚Äù

The beautiful woman nodded, stretched out her hand, picked up two Space Rings from the table next to her, and tossed them casually towards Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun.

The two caught the Space Rings and swept them with their Divine Senses, quickly showing strange expressions on their faces.

Because they discovered that these were actually their own Space Rings, which Kou Wu had taken away earlier. What‚Äôs more, nothing at all was missing from them.

‚ÄúWhat is Senior‚Äôs meaning?‚Äù Yang Kai frowned.

‚ÄúIf this Queen isn‚Äôt mistaken, you two are from one of the lower Star Fields, right?‚Äù The beautiful woman asked the two with a smile.

Liu Xian Yun wore a look of surprise as she subconsciously glanced towards Yang Kai. Thinking that his status as a Star Master had been exposed, she could not help feeling a little worried.
