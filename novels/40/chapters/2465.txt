Feng Xi became gloomy and confused. His Divine Sense kept scanning Yang Kai’s figure over and over. All the humiliation he had suffered in the past suddenly flashed across his mind, making Feng Xi’s aura suddenly unsteady and volatile.

More than two years ago, he wasn’t Yang Kai’s opponent, which forced him to use the Emperor Authority Bead, but today, the situation was completely different.

[I have become an Emperor, but this bastard is still a Dao Source Realm trash. There is a huge gap in our strength!]

Considering this, Feng Xi regained his calm and he coldly smiled at Yang Kai and replied, “Whether you are a man or a ghost, since you have met this Young Master today, your end will be miserable! Today, you will die!”

“Aiya, Young Sect Master is so scary!” Yang Kai teasingly looked at him and asked, “But I am curious about one thing. How did Young Sect Master manage to break through to the Emperor Realm?”

Feng Xi replied with a proud smile, “This Young Master is a genius. Ordinary men like you can only look up to me!”

Yang Kai countered, “Yes yes, but according to your Seeking Passion Sect’s Secret Art’s peculiarities, shouldn’t the existence of this Yang be a heart demon for you? If the heart demon isn’t removed, how can your Emperor Realm cultivation be stable? Or could it be…” Yang Kai pursed his lips and stated, revealing an evil grin, “Young Sect Master thought that this Yang was dead, allowing you to break through to the Emperor Realm in peace? If that was what you believed, it seems you might now have a slight problem!”

As soon as he said this, Feng Xi’s face drastically changed and under Yang Kai’s teasing gaze, his body slightly stumbled as he retreated two steps, as if he was struck by a giant hammer.

A soft cracking sound suddenly echoed, one that came from the depths of Feng Xi’s Soul. Feng Xi’s face abruptly turned pale as he felt something begin to break inside his body.

It was his Dao Heart! Unexpectedly, his Dao Heart had cracked! And the cause of this was just a single sentence from Yang Kai, that’s all.

As early as in Ice Moon City, Yang Kai’s existence had become a kind of heart demon for Feng Xi, one that if not removed should have made it all but impossible for his cultivation to advance.

Feng Xi had believed that he had already killed Yang Kai, so his heart demon had naturally been dispersed and he was able to break through to the Emperor Realm in the Shattered Star Sea. But the facts proved that Yang Kai, his heart demon, didn’t die, rather he had appeared in front of him again.

Yang Kai’s words had directly stimulated this heart demon, which Feng Xi believed had been cut off, affecting his Dao Heart and causing it to crack.

Blood immediately drained from Feng Xi’s face as he grit his teeth and angrily shouted, “Die, die, die! I want you dead!”

He seemed to have gone mad as a berserk aura radiated from him. Raising his hands, he fired off blasts of Emperor Qi randomly. Just the resulting shockwave from these attacks sent the two Seeking Passion Sect disciples standing next to him flying. It took these two some time to stabilize their figures before turning to Feng Xi in amazement.

The two had never seen Feng Xi in such a wild state. They knew that Feng Xi’s heart demon was surging at this moment, and he was showing signs of cultivation dissonance. This sudden calamity frightened them to no end and they hurriedly called out to him, wanting to pull Feng Xi back from the edge.

Watching all this, Yang Kai just laughed loudly, easily avoiding Feng Xi’s fierce, but haphazard attacks. He then contemptuously looked at Feng Xi and beckoned to him, continuing with his provocations, “Young Sect Master, if you want to kill me, come and catch me, or I’ll escape!”

Saying so, he turned around and rushed straight towards the depths of the void.

Feng Xi’s eyes turned red as he repeatedly roared in anger before chasing after Yang Kai.

The yellow-face young man and the scholar glanced at each other before anxiously chasing after Feng Xi. Both of them cursed Yang Kai as despicable and shameless; after all, he had deliberately targeted the weaknesses in their Young Sect Master’s mind, causing him to lose control. If Feng Xi wasn’t able to regain his composure, he might really fall into cultivation dissonance.

Feng Xi had only just broken through to the Emperor Realm, and his cultivation was still unstable, so now that his heart demon had been stirred up by Yang Kai, the situation was critical.

But at this moment, the two of them couldn’t do anything. They couldn’t help Feng Xi at all and could only pray that Feng Xi could rid himself of his anger on his own.

After the four flew off, they soon left the nearby space of that shattered Star where Zi Yu and the others were.

The reason Yang Kai had acted this way was that he was afraid that the fallout of a battle would interfere with Zi Yu’s breakthrough. What he hadn’t expected was for Feng Xi to be so easily provoked.

It seemed that this guy had not tempered his mental fortitude enough, or he simply hated him too much.

An hour later, when Yang figured he was far enough from Zi Yu and the others, he came to a stop and turned to stare coldly at the three Seeking Passion Sect disciples who were hot on his tail.

But the next thing that entered his eyes surprised him slightly.

Because during this hour-long chase, Feng Xi had actually managed to calm his raging emotions, returning from his berserk state.

At this moment, Feng Xi had some clarity despite his rage.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but be a little surprised by this. It seemed this Young Sect Master had some skill after all. It turns out he was not just a fool and his breakthrough to the Emperor Realm was not just a fluke.

Feng Xi stood a thousand metres away from Yang Kai. The yellow-faced youth and the scholar soon arrived and lined up beside him. Seeing Feng Xi’s improved state, both of them secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

The scholar whispered, “Young Sect Master, no matter what he says later, you must not allow him to rattle you again.”

“This Young Master knows that already!” Feng Xi impatiently lashed out before he turned a cold glare at Yang Kai and asked, “Was your objective to lead this Young Master away so Zi Yu could break through in peace?”

Yang Kai raised his brow, praising, “Young Sect Master seems to have some intelligence, you are correct.”

Feng Xi rebuked with a cold snort, “It was blatantly obvious! But your efforts are meaningless!”

Yang Kai curiously asked, “How can it be meaningless? Perhaps Zi Yu has already broken through to the Emperor Realm!?”

Feng Xi just sneered, “Do you think breaking through to the Emperor Realm is mere children’s play? It will certainly take her some time to break through, but it will only take a wave of this Young Master’s hand to kill you. It won’t be too late to go look for her after this Young Master kills you.”

Yang Kai said with a stoic face, “Young Sect Master, you are making me sad by saying this!” Then he pursed his lips as he sarcastically added, “Your Emperor Authority Bead couldn’t kill me last time, so what makes you think you can?”

Feng Xi turned furious after hearing this and was going to snap back, but he suddenly took a deep breath and calmed his raging anger before flatly declaring, “Last time, the only reason you managed to keep your dog life was that this Young Master was too negligent, but now are different…” His face turned grim as he coldly emphasized, “This Young Master will personally tear you to pieces this time!”

Yang Kai coldly retorted, “Young Sect Master, don’t be a braggart. Be careful lest you can’t follow through on your promise!”

“Haha!” Feng Xi grinned and stated, “In fact, this Young Master should thank you. If you hadn’t appeared before this Young Master now, I’m afraid I would have always thought you had died long ago. If so, I would have kept cultivating this way until one day I learned the news that you were still alive. When that happened, perhaps this Young Master would have directly fallen into cultivation dissonance and burned himself to death. But now, this Young Master only needs to kill you to supplement my Dao Heart and perfect my cultivation, perhaps even strengthening it!”

At this point, his eyes shone brightly like stars.

Yang Kai turned solemn as he stated, “I didn’t expect to be so useful to Young Sect Master. How will Young Sect Master thank me?”

Feng Xi proudly replied, “Make your move, otherwise don’t blame this Young Master for not giving you a chance!”

Yang Kai broke into laughter, “Since Young Sect Master is being so sincere, then this Yang will not be polite!”

Next, Yang Kai raised his hand and summoned the Myriads Sword into it. Pushing his Source Qi madly, he lifted the broadsword and slashed it out fiercely. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

An enormous horizontal Sword Wave suddenly appeared, seemingly splitting space apart as it flew forward.

The Sword Wave sent out by Yang Kai was extraordinarily strong; far in excess of what a Dao Source Realm cultivator should be capable of displaying.

The yellow-face youth and the scholar standing beside Feng Xi were astonished and they couldn’t help going limp as they faced this unstoppable Sword Wave.

“As expected, you indeed have some skills!” Feng Xi, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid. Rather he mocked, “But how can the glow of a firefly outside the moon!”

As he spoke, he summoned a sword into his hand and with a flick of his wrist, thrust it out, causing the enormous Sword Wave before him to shatter and fall apart in the blink of an eye.

The yellow-faced youth and scholar were overjoyed at the sight of this and immediately cheered.

“Scram aside!” After Feng Xi had dealt with Yang Kai’s attack with one move, his spirits had lifted and he shouted at the nuisance duo, who he only perceived as a burden now.

The two didn’t dare to be disobedient and quickly fled away to spectate from the distance.

“Yang Kai, you really aren’t an ordinary Dao Source Realm! If we were still back in the Ice Moon City arena, this Young Master would definitely not be your opponent, but in this world, one great force can surpass ten Masters. This Young Master’s cultivation is a realm higher than yours, so how can you be my opponent!?” He kept talking, but he didn’t stop attacking, swinging his sword while releasing a dense net of Sword Qi that enveloped Yang Kai.

Not only that, whenever Feng Xi swung his sword, an indescribable aura filled the surroundings.

Yang Kai was affected by this aura which made him feel extremely restless. This aura seemed capable of dampening his fighting spirit by distracting his focus, forcing him to recall various memories of Su Yang, Xia Ning Chang, Shan Qing Luo, and Xue Yu.

Yang Kai was surprised, realizing that this was some kind of strange Divine Ability of the Seeking Passion Supreme Art, one that could directly affect his emotions and desires; it really couldn’t be underestimated.

Biting the tip of his tongue, Yang Kai dispelled all the discomfort in his mind and immediately after, the Myriads Sword moved back and forth as Sword Waves shot out one after another, meeting Feng Xi’s attack head-on.

Feng Xi’s eyes flickered with a strange glow as he quickly formed a seal with his free hand before running his finger along his sword. “You are an ant, what’s the point in struggling? Why don’t you just die for me!?”

*Hong…*

A Heaven-shaking Sword Qi shot straight toward Yang Kai in the next moment as fast as a bolt of lightning.

Yang Kai’s face drastically changed as he found that he could not avoid this blow. With no other choice, he used his Nihility Secret Technique to push his form into the Void.

His figure suddenly faded as the Sword Qi pierce straight through him and shot off towards the empty void.
