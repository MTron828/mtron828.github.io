It wasn’t limited to just this. Yang Kai also felt that his body had turned lighter. He felt refreshed and full of vigour, and his body’s Source Qi started circulating quicker than before.

Upon noticing this, Yang Kai was taken aback, but he quickly understood what happened. His state of mind seemed to have achieved a subtle breakthrough.

Realizing this, his delight quickly surfaced on his face. Going for a walk had been a wise decision.

If he stayed in the Heavenly Puppet Workshop and cultivated, then he would’ve just racked his brain over this in vain and wouldn’t have gotten this fortuitous encounter.

After a short while, the waiter served him top-notch dishes and wine. Even though Yang Kai felt that the waiter was just bragging somewhat, he couldn’t deny that the dishes of this restaurant were pretty delicious and they were all made from special ingredients rich in energy. If one consumed those dishes all year long, then it was theoretically possible to increase their cultivation.

But it was quite an insignificant increase and it wouldn’t be as pure and refined as meditative cultivation.

So, cultivators would usually avoid such methods to increase their cultivation. They would have to spend a large amount of Source Crystals to eat here every day, just to obtain limited growth. It would be far better to just sit down and cultivate.

But, Yang Kai didn’t bother with nitpicking over tiny details with the waiter. He just praised him with a few words and tipped him with a few Source Crystals then asked him to leave. Yang Kai then just sat there by himself and enjoyed his drink alone.

The third floor of the restaurant was packed with guests sitting down in groups. At worst, the patrons were pairs, with the sole exception being Yang Kai.

Everyone was drinking cheerfully and discussing miscellaneous matters in loud voices, touching upon many of lands’ affairs and oddities.

Yang Kai had been listening to them with full interest.

The topic of discussions quickly focused, however, on the new concubine being taken by the City Lord, Luo Jin. The reasons for this were most likely rooted in the curiosities of men.

“Now that you mention it, the City Lord is already so old, yet he’s still enjoying himself.”

“You’re right, the City Lord has already taken in fourteen concubines and he’s planning on marrying a fifteenth tomorrow! I really wonder where he gets all the energy to keep up? Hahaha!”

“Leaving beauties to spend their nights in solitude is pretty cruel and sinful. If Sir Luo can’t pamper them all equally, then his harem may stray off-road.”

“Huh? Brother, from what you have said so far, it seems that you’re harbouring some desires for them?”

“Hehe, I won’t dare. I would never dare, I’m just speaking randomly.”

“It looked like you were sympathizing with them, as if you wanted to help the old City Lord... Hehe...”

“If I get a chance, I may give it a try. As the saying goes, if you can die beneath a beauty, then you won’t have any regrets.”

“Don’t you think you had enough drinks? If you don’t zip your mouth, then a calamity may befall you. Don’t forget that walls have ears,” someone suddenly spoke in a cold voice and warned them.

Upon hearing this, the expressions of the two people caught in a heated discussion changed and they said sheepishly, “We have really drunk more than we should, what did we say a while ago?”

“Nothing, we didn’t say anything. Come on, let’s have another drink.”

The topic of the discussion had suddenly shifted.

But, after a short while, someone brought it up again, “Now that I think about it, it’s said that his fourteen concubines are all outstanding beauties. If one can live as Sir Luo, then he won’t have any more regrets in life.”

“Well, he’s the City Lord after all. But from what you said, you must have gotten to see the City Lord’s concubines, didn’t you?”

“He’s got a point there, the City Lord keeps all of his concubines hidden in the City Lord’s Mansion. Even if they were to come out, they would be escorted by guards, clearing the way for them. Their faces are always covered by black veils. Friend, tell me. How did you get to see them?”

That person revealed a faint smile, “Hehe, I didn’t get to see them, but my niece is working as a maid in the City Lord’s Mansion and she got the opportunity to serve his concubines. According to her, they are all exceptionally beautiful, especially the newest one. She’s a lot prettier than the others and the City Lord is quite fond of her.”

“Huh? Do you have information about the new bride? Hurry up and tell us. What does she look like?”

“That’s right, we’re all curious about her.”

That man said with a smile, “I don’t mind telling you, but I don’t have any wine on my table...”

“I’ll take charge of it! Waiter, serve us a few bottles of your best wine,” someone suddenly shouted.

The man cupped his fists at him, “Friend, you’re pretty straightforward. I won’t keep you in suspense and I’ll tell you everything in detail.”

Saying so, he wiped off his mouth and started describing the City Lord’s new bride with his silver tongue. As the man described it, the crowd felt like they could see a graceful and alluring woman stroking her hair coquettishly and walking out of the void toward them. They had all revealed captivated looks and some had almost started drooling.

“Hmph!” At this moment, someone let out a cold snort and slammed his mug onto the table heavily, letting out a loud rumble.

The crowd lost in their fanciful dreams and they all looked angrily at that said person.

Yang Kai had also been listening to the previous man’s tale eagerly, and he quickly looked at the source of the noise. He sighted upon a muscular man stinking off alcohol with a vicious glare in his eye.

Upon sweeping him with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai discovered that this man was only a Third-Order Origin King, and his aura seemed pretty unstable. It seemed like he had suffered some kind of serious injury recently.

The man’s right eye was completely white without a pupil, as if it had been blinded by some unknown substance. The man looked pretty vicious, and his strange eye only made him scarier.

At this moment, anger was apparent on the one-eyed man’s face. He had even destroyed the cup in his hand, causing sweet liquor to drip through his fingers.

“I was just wondering who it was, it’s the lone tiger who has just left his mountain, Brother Hu Chai,” the person who had been speaking a while ago laughed then covered his mouth, “No, he’s now the One-Eyed Tiger! Hahaha!”

The man didn’t even bother with hiding his mockery, and he laughed along with the crowd. It looked like they all didn’t like the man surnamed Chai.

“Brother Chai, I’m pretty curious. Who blinded you?” After that man had his fill of laughter, he questioned him.

Chai Hu snorted and didn’t bother with replying. He just sat there with a vicious look on his face and rolled his sole eye at that person, “If you continue making things up, then I’ll tear you apart.”

The expression of that person changed and he shouted, “Making things up? What do you mean by that?”

Chai Hu said, “That woman... doesn’t look anything like that.”

“Which woman?” That person furrowed his brows, but he quickly came back to his senses and responded. Squinting as he said, “Chai Hu, are you talking about... The City Lord’s new bride?”

Chai Hu snorted coldly then raised a wine bottle on the table to drink it down in one gulp.

That man still didn’t let go of this, “You’re talking like you have seen the bride. Did you?”

Chai Hu’s hand suddenly stiffened and a reminiscent look flashed past his sole eye, but he still said coldly, “It’s none of your business!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

That person was taken aback and he clapped with a smile, “I suddenly understand how you got blinded.” He stopped for a moment, leaving those around him in suspense, then laughed aloud, “You must have peeped on the City Lord’s bride when she was bathing and your eye got blinded by her.”

After he said so, the whole place broke into laughter.

Chai Hu suddenly stood up and flipped up the table. As his body moved, he rushed at the man like a ferocious tiger with a sabre in his hand, swinging it out.

The current Chai Hu was shrouded in a dense murderous intent. This matter must have poked a sore point. As for his opponent, he was startled by this and he quickly summoned up all his might to defend against the unexpected attack.

These two were both Third-Order Origin Kings, so their moves possessed indomitable might. As their Saint Qi surged, the battle’s shockwaves flipped up all tables on the third floor and the whole restaurant started shaking. It had almost crumbled apart!

Upon noticing this disturbance, the owner of the restaurant quickly rushed over and sighted upon the two men fighting to the death. His face turned pale and he entreated them to leave and finish their fight outside, but his pleas didn’t reach them.

Yang Kai shook his head with a helpless look on his face then picked the wine bottle on the table, draining off anything left in one gulp. Shortly after, he left some Source Crystals on the table, then his body flickered away. He had left the restaurant and was making his way through the crowd.

Fights between cultivators were a common occurrence and every cultivator’s hands were stained in blood. On this day, Chai Hu or his opponent might get killed in the fight, but that was their business.

Yang Kai didn’t plan to intervene. He just wanted to get back to Heavenly Puppet Workshop, but when he passed by a pill store on the way, he suddenly stopped, then turned around and went inside.

This pill store was one of Violet Source Chamber of Commerce’s industries, as it had its symbol on its signboard.

Yang Kai planned to purchase some herbs. He had a lot of materials in his Space Ring, but he had consumed a lot of pills lately, and he was short of some secondary ingredients to refine replacements. Purchasing what he needed was the simplest method.

The Violet Source Chamber of Commerce’s pill store in Sky Crane City was a lot larger than the one in Maplewood City, and it had a much wider variety of goods than the latter. Yang Kai began purchasing a lot of herbs he needed with the help of the store’s attendant, and this attendant was very delighted by this. He realized that he had run into a pretty wealthy man, so he served him meticulously and respectfully.

After Yang Kai spent an hour there, he finally finished his purchases and he asked the attendant to pack all the goods then went to the counter to settle the bill.

The shopkeeper had also realized that they had run into someone with deep pockets and wore an amiable smile across his face.

But, while they were still counting the price of goods, a shadow fell upon the entrance and someone came inside.

The shopkeeper raised his head to take a look then said in surprise, “Young Lady Luo? We are honoured by your presence, please forgive us for not coming out to greet you.”

Upon hearing this, the expression of Yang Kai’s changed and he realized that ‘Young Lady Luo’ was most likely the daughter of Sky Crane City’s Lord, Luo Jin.

Those two had the same surname and the shopkeeper would likely treat only those from the City Lord’s Mansion so respectfully; after all, the shopkeeper here was a member of Violet Source Chamber of Commerce. With such backing, he didn’t have to treat guests without very special status with such courtesy.

Yang Kai turned his head and gazed at this ‘Young Lady Luo’ curiously. What he saw was a graceful young girl clad in a flashy dress. She had come here with a smile and waved her hand at the shopkeeper in response, “Shopkeeper, just take care of your business. I only came here for a stroll!”

“Young Lady Luo, please help yourself!” The shopkeeper revealed a faint smile.
