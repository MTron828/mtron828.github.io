Chapter 1739, Origin King Displays His Might

“Old dog Li!” Gu Jian Xin rushed over and released a dazzling sun-like sword light towards Li Ming Hai.

At the same time, the surrounding burst with golden light as hundreds of golden threads slashed through space.

The Void Cracks around Li Ming Hai’s body also rapidly enlarged and traversed towards him.

In that instant, Li Ming Hai was submerged by a myriad of different deadly attacks.

The place where Li Ming Hai stood was instantly enveloped by a dazzling burst of light, blinding all who were nearby and releasing a Heaven destroying and Earth-shattering energy fluctuation.

Gu Jian Xin flew out again even faster than before, but fortunately, the Right Sword Servant, having anticipated this moment, was there to catch him.

With a loud cough, Gu Jian Xin slumped over into the arms of his Right Sword Servant and sprayed out a thick blood mist.

“Young Master!” The Right Sword Servant cried out as her beautiful eyes filled with worry.

Gu Jian Xin did not have the luxury to answer as his eyes fixed straight ahead.

He did not know if Li Ming Hai was dead, but the piercing feedback he felt from his sword just now was a clear indication that he had managed to stab Li Ming Hai’s vitals.

Nevertheless, his opponent was an Origin King! This was the first time Gu Jian Xin had truly fought an Origin King in a life or death battle, so he was naturally somewhat inexperienced. Before seeing Li Ming Hai’s corpse with his own eyes, he dared not act carelessly.

The brilliant flash of light gradually dissipated, and a figure emerged.

Gu Jian Xin’s eyes shrank suddenly.

Li Ming Hai!

Even after suffering such a terrifying attack, Li Ming Hai had not died. However, having been struck by such a powerful wave of attacks, Li Ming Hai had been reduced to a dishevelled and embarrassing appearance. His clothes were ragged and the Artifact Armour he had summoned in the nick of time was also clearly destroyed.

What made Gu Jian Xin overjoyed though was that Li Ming Hai’s injuries were obviously not light, with blood leaking from many places and numerous wounds so deep that his bones were showing.

On Li Ming Hai’s face, an expression filled with anger and fear had appeared.

He was truly frightened as he felt the threat of death just now!

Unable to calm his nerves, Li Ming Hai looked around, his gaze only staying on Gu Jian Xin and the Right Sword Servant for a moment before it continued scanning the surrounding void.

Unfortunately, Li Ming Hai was not able to achieve anything as he couldn’t discover a single trace of the mysterious young man who attacked him before.

“Junior, this old master will make you pay the price one day!” Li Ming Hai tried to put up a strong front as he shouted before turning into a stream of light and fleeing towards the distance, leaving behind a trail of blood as he flew.

“He must not escape!” Gu Jian Xin shouted towards the void as he gasped for breath.

Just as his voice fell, from somewhere in the void, a multi-coloured burst of light appeared, and a five coloured Sword Qi formed into a giant blade that flashed towards the fleeing Li Ming Hai. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Li Ming Hai was horrified when he felt this approaching attack and hurriedly used a Secret Technique to protect himself.

Unfortunately, he was strong in will but weak in strength, and the method he used was only able to block the five coloured Sword Qi for an instant before it was shattered. The sword wave sliced through Li Ming Hai’s body before disappearing into the distance like a shining comet.

Li Ming Hai’s body froze in place, his eyes wide and unmoving.

The vitality of his body and the light in his eyes quickly dissipated.

A dignified Origin King Realm master died here!

Gu Jian Xin, who was watching from a distance, could not figure out the situation. After being severely wounded, he did not dare to act rashly and just continued to stare at Li Ming Hai’s body vigilantly. Soon though, the still-shaken Left Sword Servant flew over and inspected Li Ming Hai before happily flying over to rendezvous with Gu Jian Xin.

When his Left Sword Servant returned, Gu Jian Xin asked eagerly, “How is it?”

“Li Ming Hai is dead!” Left Sword Servant replied.

Gu Jian Xin exhaled a long breath, his whole figure relaxing as he limply fell into the Right Sword Servant’s embrace as he said with some lingering fear, “Good, good, as long as he’s dead it’s good!”

“Young Master, that person just now...” The Left Sword Servant wore a suspicious look on her face.

“He’s not from our Sword Union,” Gu Jian Xin shook his head, took out some pills from his Space Ring, stuffed them into his mouth, and said, “We can figure it out later, but we need to go support the others first. Old Dog Li brought a lot of masters with him, I am afraid they won’t... huh...”

While Gu Jian Xin spoke, he turned his head and looked towards the distant battlefield and was greeted by a strange scene.

Many of the cultivators from his side were still alive while, on the contrary, Li Ming Hai’s subordinates were almost all dead or severely injured. Gu Jian Xin had been fighting Li Ming Hai just now, so he did not have the time to pay attention to anything else, so this scene came as quite a surprise to him.

Gu Jian Xin was naturally well aware of the gap in strength between the two sides and knew his side was far weaker than Li Ming Hai’s.

After all, Li Ming Hai had laid an ambush for him here, so how could he not have made appropriate preparations?

This time, Gu Jian Xin was lucky enough to kill Li Ming Hai and keep his life thanks to the help of that noble stranger, but how were his subordinates also able to emerge victoriously?

Gu Jian Xin could not believe his eyes.

However, after watching for a while, he finally understood what was happening.

It turned out to be because of Yue Xi and her two Disciples!

Gu Jian Xin had met Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Miao before. In any case, the Master and Disciple trio were cultivators who followed him, so although Yue Xi was only a First-Order, she was still an Origin Realm master. Gu Jian Xin naturally had some impression of them.

At this moment, the Master and Disciple trio were leading the charge against the enemy who should be far stronger than them, but it was actually the three of them who were in complete control of the battle.

Whenever a battle erupted, a red light would burst from He Zao’s body and the enemy would inexplicably fall...

[What is that red light?] Gu Jian Xin could not understand it at all. He never knew that there was such an astonishing cultivator hidden amongst his subordinates who was capable of such an incredible feat!

The overall situation had been determined over there, with Li Ming Hai’s side’s defeat being inevitable. The few survivors from the original ambushers were now fleeing while Gu Jian Xin’s subordinates were in pursuit.

Gu Jian Xin felt relieved and took a deep breath before cupping his fists and calling out to the void, “Dare I ask honoured friend’s name? For this life saving kindness, this Gu is extremely grateful. If it is convenient, could friend come out and meet with me?”

“Haha, Young Union Master is too polite,” A hearty laughter came from nearby and Gu Jian Xin turned his head to find a familiar young man, who he might have met before but could not put his finger on it, was now slowly walking over to him.

Gu Jian Xin’s eyes flashed as his Left and Right Sword Servants looked at Yang Kai with curiosity and gratitude.

If it were not for Yang Kai’s sudden appearance, while it didn’t matter if they had died, it was certain their Young Master would have perished as well. As such, the Left and Right Sword Servants were extremely grateful towards Yang Kai, who had turned the tide of the battle, and their eyes reflected a kind light as they observed him.

Gu Jian Xin also observed Yang Kai carefully and confirmed that the other part was truly just a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator as he had detected before. But the combat power this young man had shown before was clearly far beyond his realm.

Perhaps, even if he were to join forces with his Left and Right Sword Servants, they would not necessarily be this young man’s opponents! Gu Jian Xin was thoroughly shocked.

As Sword Union’s Young Union Master, from infancy until now, he had received resources and training beyond anything ordinary people could dream of. He also wasn’t a second-generation child with no ambition, he had lofty ideals and a broad future before him, so he had never slacked in his cultivation over the years.

He thought that there were few of his generation in the Star Field worthy to be his opponent within the Origin Returning Realm!

But today, he saw one! A cultivator of the same generation who made him feel intense pressure.

“Third Young Master Xue Yue?” Gu Jian Xin asked suspiciously.

Yang Kai’s face twitched visibly as he spat, “Do I look like such a womanly boy?”

Gu Jian Xin smiled awkwardly as his Left and Right Sword Servants also couldn’t help tittering lightly, the more playful looking Left Sword Servant even giggling out loud, but feeling that she was acting indiscreetly she quickly used her jade hand to cover her mouth.

“Sorry, this Gu and Third Young Master Xue Yue have not met for many, many years,” Gu Jian Xin explained. “Then is Your Excellency Zi Dong?”

“Who?” Yang Kai asked in confusion.

“Purple Star’s Young Master...” Gu Jian Xin was at a loss.

“Ho, it seems Young Union Master believes only Young Masters from other great forces are qualified to speak with you?” Yang Kai looked at Gu Jian Xin with a smile.

“This Gu meant no such thing,” Gu Jian Xin said solemnly, “It’s just that this Gu finds it difficult to imagine that someone could become so strong without the support of such a great force! If I have shown any impropriety, please forgive me.”

“It’s fine,” Yang Kai smiled lightly, “I am not a person from any great force. My name is Yang Kai.”

Gu Jian Xin was taken aback as he truly had never heard the name Yang Kai before. What was certain was that he was definitely not from any great force, but this reality only shocked Gu Jian Xin even more.

Cupping his fists solemnly again, he politely called, “So it is Brother Yang.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly before glancing towards the distance where the other battlefield had settled down. With Liu Yan’s help, how could Li Ming Hai subordinates have any chance to escape? All of them were executed without a single one being able to escape.

“Brother Yang, this Gu has a question, but I don’t know if it’s appropriate to ask,” Gu Jian Xin suddenly spoke.

“When I passed by here before, Li Ming Hai attacked me by surprise, so I decided to lie in ambush here to return the favour,” Yang Kai glanced at him and answered before the question was asked.

“Brother Yang is brave, bold, and strong!” Gu Jian Xin brow jumped.

An ordinary Origin Returning Realm cultivator who was sneak attacked by an Origin King and managed to survive would normally run as far away as possible. They may gnash their teeth and curse violently to vent their anger, but very few would dare do what Yang Kai did, daring to come back and launch his own sneak attack.

Those who acted this way either didn’t fear the Heavens or had something to rely on that gave them confidence in success.

And from the results, it was obviously Yang Kai belonged to the latter category!

It seemed he had not used his full strength in the previous battle.

Moreover, this Yang Kai was obviously a man who sought revenge for any grievance he suffered!
