Chapter 1727, Three Months

“Is this Grand Crystal Mountain Range where Coloured Glass Sect is located?” Su Yan asked as she looked around at the rolling hills below.

“En,” Yang Kai standing next to her nodded, releasing his Divine Sense and, with the assistance of his powers as Star Master swept the mountain range’s several tens of thousands of kilometres. Smiling, he continued, “It looks like Coloured Glass Sect’s headquarters didn’t suffer too much damage during the Corpse Spirit Religion chaos. It still looks quite similar to when I last came here.”

Xia Ning Chang looked into the distance and said softly, “The World Energy on the Shadowed Star is really not comparable to Tong Xuan Realm. Every place we’ve travelled these days, whether in terms of aura or scenery, is far better than Tong Xuan Realm.”

Saying so, she looked a little sad.

Yang Kai was Shadowed Star’s Star Master while she was the Star Master of Tong Xuan Realm. For every Star Master, the Cultivation Star that they refined the Star Source of was like the closest of partners, like their own child.

Tong Xuan Realm’s withered aura made Xia Ning Chang somewhat depressed.

“Star Master and Cultivation Star are closely related. Little Senior Sister, you only need to work hard to improve your cultivation and Tong Xuan Realm will be rejuvenated one day,” Yang Kai comforted.

“En,” Xia Ning Chang nodded.

“Let’s go. Sect Master Gong should have received word of our arrival already,” Yang Kai held the two women’s hands as he led them forward.

It had been almost three months since they started wandering Shadowed Star.

Over the past three months, Yang Kai’s trio had visited almost all the famous spots on Shadowed Star and experienced all kinds of local customs and traditions. The waves on the Limitless Ocean were magnificent while the silence of the vast desserts was breathtaking. Many famous mountains and rivers now bore the footprints of these three.

This three-month-long journey would surely become one of the most beautiful memories in the hearts of the trio.

Coloured Glass Sect was the last stop set by Yang Kai!

Yang Kai’s reason for coming here wasn’t actually to sight-see though, but rather to ask Gong Ao Fu for something.

Although Gong Ao Fu had led Coloured Glass Sect’s survivors to join High Heaven Sect during the Corpse Spirit Religion war, and she herself became one of the Elders of High Heaven Sect, after Corpse Spirit Religion was destroyed, Yang Kai had allowed Gong Ao Fu to return to Grand Crystal Mountain Range.

He knew better than anyone just how meaningful one’s ancestral heritage was to a cultivator.

Just like how he built a Sect on Shadowed Star called High Heaven Sect, even if Gong Ao Fu stayed in High Heaven Sect, where there were better conditions for her own growth, she would never be able to forget Coloured Glass Sect. Eventually, it would no doubt disturb her heart.

What’s more, when Gong Ao Fu joined High Heaven Sect, Yang Kai had promised that he would allow her to rebuild Coloured Glass Sect in the future.

Allowing her to return was simply fulfilling his original promise.

Gong Ao Fu was naturally extremely grateful, and although she led the cultivators of Coloured Glass Sect back to Grand Crystal Mountain Range, she had sworn an oath that Coloured Glass Sect would belong to High Heaven Sect as a subordinate Sect from now on!

This was the first attached force High Heaven Sect possessed! And it was a very powerful one at that.

When Yang Kai arrived here with Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang, Gong Ao Fu was immediately notified.

When the trio reached the main peak of Coloured Glass Sect, a dense group of people were assembled already, headed by a beautiful woman with a rich, mature style. Naturally, it was Gong Ao Fu.

Dai Yuan still wore her pockmarked and pitted appearance, appearing extremely ugly, making Gong Ao Fu look all the more beautiful.

Behind these two were the only remaining Elders and elite disciples of Coloured Glass Sect, Yin Su Die among them.

Seeing Yang Kai land in front of them, the assembled group all solemnly saluted.

“Subordinate Gong Ao Fu greets Sect Master, greets Madame Sect Masters!” Gong Ao Fu said quickly.

“There are no outsiders here, Sect Master Gong need not be so polite!” Yang Kai waved his hand while Su Yan smiled at Gong Ao Fu, accepting the title of Madame Sect Master with confidence. Xia Ning Chang, on the other hand, even with her veil, had obviously gone bright red, her delicate earlobes looking like they were on fire.

After so many years, Little Senior Sister was still just as shy and innocent as ever.

“Sister Dai Yuan, it’s been a long time,” Yang Kai turned to Dai Yuan next and a knowing light flashed across his eyes. Others did not know what kind of face was hidden beneath her disfigured disguise, but Yang Kai did.

Dai Yuan’s figure was indeed exquisite, but her face was quite unappetizing, making it extremely difficult for people to have a good first impression of her.

Yang Kai and Dai Yuan could not have lived in more different worlds; one was a dragon that soared through the sky while the other was an ant crawling on the ground.

As such, no one knew why Yang Kai cared so much about Dai Yuan.

Facing Yang Kai’s greetings, Dai Yuan just nodded slightly, not showing any particular enthusiasm.

Gong Ao Fu smiled next to her and quickly said, “I received word from Great Elder Ye that Sect Master has been wandering Shadowed Star for the past few months. Has Sect Master had any significant gains?”

“We were simply touring the scenery, how could there be any gains?” Yang Kai chuckled and shook his head.

“Sect Master and the two madams are perfectly matched; it seems walking hand in hand together was the biggest gain of the past three months.”

Yang Kai met eyes with both Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang, all three of them smiling at each other lightly.

Although they knew that Gong Ao Fu was simply offering some light flattery, none of them were turned off by such words.

“However, I wonder why Sect Master has decided to visit my Coloured Glass Sect? If it is just to sight-see, then subordinate will quickly make proper arrangements. There are many picturesque sceneries in Grand Crystal Mountain Range.”

“Unfortunately, that is not why I’ve come here today,” Yang Kai shook his head. “I came here to make a request.”

“Please name it, Sect Master!” Gong Ao Fu smiled, “If not for Sect Master’s care, my Coloured Glass Sect would have ceased to exist long ago, whatever Sect Master needs from my Coloured Glass Sect, we will be honoured to prepare, why act so politely?”

Seeing her comply so easily, Yang Kai nodded, “Then I will be succinct. I came here to obtain some Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass. Your Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Mountain was not destroyed by Corpse Spirit Religion, right?”

“Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass?” Gong Ao Fu raised her brow, “Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Mountain is one of Shadowed Star’s greatest treasures. The Corpse Spirit Religion was unable to destroy it, but if Sect Master wants Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass, things might be a bit difficult. We have accumulated some Coloured Glass Sect over the years, but only two or three fists worth. I don’t know if this is enough for Sect Master?”

“Certainly not!” Yang Kai failed to stifle his laughter.

“Then... shall I have Dai Yuan use her Secret Technique to collect some?” Gong Ao Fu asked hesitantly.

In Coloured Glass Sect, only Dai Yuan who had cultivated the special Secret Technique was able to extract and refine Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass.

So even though Coloured Glass Sect possessed a great treasure like Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Mountain, it was unable to actually use it fully, a rather depressing situation.

“Disciple cannot mine much, but I believe Yang Kai has his own methods!” Dai Yuan looked at Yang Kai elegantly.

“Impudence!” Gong Ao Fu shouted as she turned her beautiful eyes towards Dai Yuan and declared majestically, “How dare you call Sect Master by his given name!”

Although her tone was filled with the meaning of blame, Gong Ao Fu’s attention was completely focused on Yang Kai. Noticing that Yang Kai did not seem to be angry, she immediately calmed down.

“It’s fine, I’ve known Sister Dai Yuan for a long time, so it’s not a big deal for her to address me by name,” Yang Kai laughed lightly.

Dai Yuan, on the other hand, ground her teeth as she glared at Yang Kai angrily.

Before Corpse Spirit Religion ravaged Shadowed Star, she and Yang Kai had been friends on equal footing, always addressing one another informally, but now, this sly fellow had leapt to become someone who could order her Honoured Master around.

Dai Yuan naturally felt very awkward.

“Many thanks for Sect Master’s understanding. Subordinate has been neglectful in teaching Dai Yuan,” Gong Ao Fu bowed her head before quickly changing the topic, “Does Sect Master have a way to mine Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass?”

“En.” Yang Kai nodded.

“In that case, there’s nothing more that needs to be discussed. Please feel free to take as much as what Sect Master wants. Even if we mine it ourselves, we don’t actually have many uses for Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Mountain at the moment. Sect Master, please come with me.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Gong Ao Fu agreed immediately and led the way.

Yang Kai, Su Yan, and Xia Ning Chang quickly followed.

The cultivators of Coloured Glass Sect were also very curious about what method Yang Kai had to mine the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass, so naturally, they followed along, eager to see what happened.

“You fool!” Yin Su Die watched the crowd fly away before getting close to Dai Yuan and muttering in frustration, “When Sect Master took the initiative to bring you to greet him, why did you just brush him off?”

“Then what should I have done? Gone up and pushed myself onto him?” Dai Yuan cast her a dismissive glance.

Yin Su Die choked on her words for a moment before thinking about it and suddenly giggling, “If it was me, I would do just that. He is the strongest man on Shadowed Star, so there’s no shame in actively trying to approach him.”

“It may be as you say, but do you think you can compare to the two women beside him?” Dai Yuan shot Yin Su Die a contemptuous look.

Yin Su Die gawked as she recalled the demeanour and appearance of Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang, a sense of inferiority instantly welling up inside her.

Su Yan was wrapped in a cold aura that, while invisible, was extremely strong, giving her great pressure. With Su Yan standing there, Yin Su Die could not work up the courage to talk to Yang Kai.

As for the other delicate, veiled woman, she had a holy and inviolable aura that made any woman who saw her feel inferior!

“Who cares, I still have a chance as long as Sect Master is happy!” Yin Su Die coldly snorted.

“I have no time to waste with you!” Dai Yuan gave her a blank look before shaking her head and following after the crowd.

“Stupid Senior Sister! Ugly woman!” Yin Su Die cursed as she pointed at Dai Yuan indignantly.

Dai Yuan simply pretended not to hear anything.

Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Mountain was actually a single giant Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass ore. It was extremely heavy and had a rather plain appearance, but it was a fact that this Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass was innately able to produce Coloured Glass Divine Light.

Coloured Glass Divine Light had a profound suppressive effect on all five elements, as well as the Soul.

The Coloured Glass Bead Dai Yuan gave Yang Kai many years ago was something she had formed after ingesting small bits of Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass over many years. It was similar to a Monster Beast’s Monster Core. This Coloured Glass Bead had been refined by Yang Kai and integrated into his Demon Eye of Annihilation, greatly enhancing its power.

In addition, Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass had a mysterious ability to transform into a myriad of different forms.

Rumour had it that if one used Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass to refine an artifact, that artifact could change into a variety of different forms when confronting an enemy, making it extremely difficult to defend against.
