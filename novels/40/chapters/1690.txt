“Yes, this is my Knowledge Sea,” A voice came from the side.

Yang Kai turned his head and saw Yang Yan sitting cross-legged in the void, forming a series of strange seals with her hands, her face extremely solemn as various halos of light flashed around her, giving her an almost sacred aura.

She looked at him with a smile, no different from the Yang Yan in his memory.

“Is it you, or her?” Yang Kai frowned, uncertain of the answer.

Yang Yan pursed her lips, “Is there a difference?”

Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders, “It might not make a difference to you, but it does to me. I don’t want to be killed after angering the Starry Sky Great Emperor!”

“I am the Starry Sky Great Emperor!” Yang Yan snorted.

“Good, seems like it’s still you,” Yang Kai relaxed. As long as it wasn’t the legendary Great Emperor he was talking to, there wouldn’t be any problem. Having made this determination, he then asked, “Did you need something from me?”

“Not really,” Yang Yan shook her head slowly, “I just felt your aura and decided to bring you here.”

Yang Kai smiled bitterly.

Even he felt that he was no longer a weak Junior. His strength had grown rapidly over the years and he was now invincible below the Origin King Realm. Even if it was against an ordinary First-Order Origin King, Yang Kai was confident he could fight back.

But compared to Yang Yan, he was still nothing but an ant she could squash at will...

Yang Kai could not help feeling depressed.

Seemingly aware of what he was thinking, Yang Yan just giggled, “You don’t have to belittle yourself. To be honest, I have never met anyone with such rapid cultivation as you. Even in that place, you would be considered a peak genius. All you lack is the tempering of time. As long as you have enough time, you will be able to stand at the same height as me one day.”

“Are you trying to comfort me?” Yang Kai glanced at her, frowned, and asked, “Where is ‘that place’ you mentioned?”

Yang Yan laughed lightly without answering, appearing mysterious.

Seeing that she did not have any intention to explain, Yang Kai waved his hand, “Forget it, just pretend I didn’t ask.”

Yang Yan gently nodded before her expression suddenly became serious, “Although I have been sleeping, fusing my Embodiment and Soul, I am not completely ignorant of the outside world. I have felt that something big has happened to Shadowed Star in recent years, and just two months ago Ye Xi Yun even brought a number of people here. What happened? Is High Heaven Sect alright?”

“High Heaven Sect is fine, but Shadowed Star is in great trouble.” Yang Kai sighed and flew over to Yang Yan before sitting down cross-legged and telling her about Corpse Spirit Religion’s rise. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Yang Yan listened attentively, and after Yang Kai was finished, she nodded lightly, “It turns out that there was a suppressed Underworld Well Spring under Grand Burial Valley. This really is partially our fault then. If we had not taken that Sun’s True Essence away, that Underworld Well Spring would never have reappeared.”

“And that’s why I am troubled over this. If it was something else, I wouldn’t care as it did not involve High Heaven Sect. No matter what kind of chaos is raised outside, it has no way to affect High Heaven Sect’s headquarters, but in the end, this is related to me, so I cannot just feign un-involvement,” Yang Kai sighed.

Yang Yan agreed with Yang Kai’s point of view and after thinking for a moment asked, “Can you go confront that Corpse Spirit Religion Master?”

“Are you interested in him?” Yang Kai frowned.

“It’s not interest per-say, it’s just that I feel his methods of creating Corpse Spirits, and the methods he’s using to control Corpse Spirit Religion are quite similar to someone else I know.”

“Who?” Yang Kai was surprised.

“He called himself the Corpse Emperor, and he also controlled a race back then called the Corpse Spirit Race, which is why I asked.”

“Corpse Emperor...” Yang Kai drew a sharp breath, his expression fluctuating as he asked, “Is he on the same level as you?”

Yang Yan was the Starry Sky Great Emperor, and since this guy dared to call himself the Corpse Emperor, he was obviously a cultivator of the same rank as Yang Yan.

Yang Yan nodded gently.

Yang Kai’s complexion instantly became extremely ugly.

Yang Yan saw this and smiled, “You don’t need to be so anxious, the Corpse Emperor can’t come here, so there’s no way that Religion Master is the Corpse Emperor; instead, I suspect he is only somewhat connected to the Corpse Emperor, perhaps that one old acquaintance of mine as that fellow was also acquainted with the Corpse Emperor. Their friendship was quite good, so it wouldn’t be a surprise for him to know how to transform corpses!”

Yang Kai grit his teeth as he stared at Yang Yan, “Even if that person is not the Corpse Emperor, since he is your old acquaintance, he is not someone I can face. Wouldn’t rushing to confront him be courting death?”

“Of course, I’m not going to send you out there just to die!” Yang Yan glared at Yang Kai angrily, “If that person is really who I suspect he is, his strength will definitely not reach the Origin King Realm. At most, he will be a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator now. Shadowed Star has its own World Principles, so as long as he is stuck here, it is basically impossible for him to have broken through!”

Yang Kai’s expression instantly cleared up. If this mysterious Religion Master was truly just a Third-Order Origin Realm cultivator, then there was nothing to be afraid of.

However...

“What kind of story does that old acquaintance of yours possess that causes you such concern?” Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

Yang Yan went silent for a while before explaining, “You should know that the reason my true body fell into a long slumber was that it was severely injured in a great battle, forcing me to retreat to the Emperor Garden to recover. That old acquaintance... is the one who injured me!”

Yang Kai had to try extremely hard to maintain his composure as he asked, “Didn’t you say that in that battle that person died?”

Yang Kai also had some knowledge of these long-past events. The reason why the Starry Sky Great Emperor had fallen into a deep slumber was that the damage to her body was too great while her enemy had been exterminated.

But now, Yang Yan mentioned that her enemy might still be alive.

Yang Kai could not help feeling anxious.

Anyone who could harm Yang Yan was undoubtedly like her and the Corpse Emperor, a master on an incredible level.

“I destroyed his body and crushed his Soul, but that guy’s methods of escaping are first-class. Perhaps he found a way for a portion of his Soul to escape without me noticing. However, you can rest assured that his situation is quite different from mine. I was injured heavily, but as long as I had enough time and resources, I would be able to recover while his body was completely destroyed, so even if he wants to return to his peak, it won’t be that simple, especially on Shadowed Star.”

Yang Kai frowned and nodded, “If that’s the case, I can go look for him now, but even if it is like you said, and that Corpse Spirit Religion Religion Master is your old enemy, what do you plan to do about him?”

Yang Yan shook her head, “Not me, you! If that Corpse Spirit Religion Religion Master is really him, you must kill him in the shortest time possible, otherwise, the entire Star Field will suffer greatly once he manages to restore himself to a certain degree.”

“You are the Starry Sky Great Emperor, can’t you just wave your hand and consign him to oblivion?” Yang Kai looked at Yang Yan with a somewhat frustrated look.

Yang Yan shook her head, “I can’t act temporarily.”

Yang Kai suddenly felt like cursing, but after holding his tongue for a long time, he nodded fiercely and said, “Fine. I’ll go confront him.”

“Be careful. He is extremely cruel and specializes in controlling others to do his bidding. He rarely shows up in person, so if you find an opportunity, make sure you go for the kill!”

“I know!” Yang Kai answered casually.

“Then, return!” Yang Yan waved her hand and in the next moment, Yang Kai felt a repulsive force coming from the Knowledge Sea around him.

When he came back to his senses, Yang Kai found that he was still standing at the edge of the wooden bed while Yang Yan’s eyes were still closed tightly, sleeping in front of him.

Turning around, Yang Kai strode out of the loft.

Although he had promised Yang Yan to go confront the mysterious Religion Master as soon as possible, considering how secretive the other party was acting, even keeping the White-Robed Corpse General Yang Kai had killed in the dark about his true cultivation and face, finding and killing him would undoubtedly be a very difficult task.

Fortunately, Yang Kai did not intend to act alone.

After returning to High Heaven Sect, Yang Kai immediately sent someone to send a message to Qian Tong.

Now, Qian Tong was the undisputed strongest master on Shadowed Star with his Origin King Realm cultivation, so he would be able to play a critical role in this upcoming action.

Shadow Moon Hall should have stabilized by now, and if they wanted to solve the problems of Shadowed Star once and for all, eradicating Corpse Spirit Religion was an absolute necessity. Qian Tong should be more than willing to join hands with him to deal with the mysterious Religion Master.

Shadow Moon Hall was quite far from High Heaven Sect though, so even if Qian Tong were to come, it would take at least a month for him to arrive.

As such, Yang Kai decided to wait patiently while improving his strength.

In Ice Heart Valley, Yang Kai used the Star Emperor Token to fight Luo Hai, breaking through his own shackles and reaching the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, only one step away from the Origin King Realm.

On the way back, his cultivation had continued to consolidate and grow, gradually approaching the limits of his current realm, while his Shi had reached the grand accomplishment stage.

Also, thanks to the numerous Domain Stones in his possession and his experiences inside the Blood Prison Trial, Yang Kai also had a decent understanding of Domain.

In other words, if not for the current conditions not permitting it, Yang Kai could already begin breaking through to the Origin King Realm.

However, he was not in such a hurry. His Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation was the foundation upon which he would strive for the Origin King Realm, so the more he consolidated and strengthened it, the easier it would be for him to form his Domain after breaking through.

Yang Kai intended to wait until after Corpse Spirit Religion had been dealt with before leaving Shadowed Star again to break through, as well as deal with several outstanding issues he had in mind.

These few issues were crucial to improving his strength as well as his understanding of the mysteries of the Star Field.

Time passed day by day, with nothing of great surprise happening in High Heaven Sect. Almost everyone was immersed in cultivation.

Everyone understood that such peaceful days would not last long. Once the time was ripe, Yang Kai would launch a grand campaign against Corpse Spirit Religion. At that time, even if they wanted to cultivate, they would have no time.

It was for this reason that the masters of High Heaven Sect cherished the current calm and used every moment of it to increase their strength. The stronger they were, the better they could preserve their lives and the more enemies they could kill in the war to come.

One month later, Qian Tong rushed to High Heaven Sect and was immediately welcomed into the headquarters by the High Heaven Sect disciple posted outside.

Ever since Yang Kai beheaded White-Robed Corpse General Kang Fei Rao, the Corpse Spirit Religion army that was besieging High Heaven Sect had scattered. Now, High Heaven Sect had finally restored its connection with the outside world and begun gathering intelligence from all around the star. As a result, Qian Tong’s journey had gone without any incident.
