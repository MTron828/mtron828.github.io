Time passed in a blink of an eye and it was already one month later.

In this one month, some changes had taken place in the Shaman Niu Clan’s base.

The most obvious change was the surge in the number of people.

After the initial three months of war, the group of three thousand people had expanded to five thousand, and after capturing the city, the number increased to seven thousand.

Now, the seven thousand people were more than tripled, and the number was close to the twenty thousand mark.

This was an extremely terrifying number, not an amount a mere Shaman Grandmaster could control. Only a Shaman King was qualified to lead so many people.

Naturally, the additional clansmen were sent by the Demon Kings, with Fei Li as their leader. With the efforts of the Shaman Masters such as Yue, Lu, and the others, many clansmen had recovered their senses.

The Shaman Warriors had no idea where the new demonised clansmen came from, but they just followed Yang Kai’s order and accepted them outside from time to time. Bao Qi and Sha Ya also made a lot of contributions, and it was thanks to these two Demon Kings that the handovers went so smoothly.

Every Shaman Master was so busy that they did not have time to take a break, but they were joyous nonetheless.

There were some Shamans among the clansmen that were sent, so it was something that was worth celebrating.

Originally, there were only a dozen Shamans in the Shaman Niu Clan, but after this last month, the number had expanded to about fifty. Most of them were Shaman Apprentices and Shaman Warriors, while only a few were Shaman Masters, and none were Shaman Grandmasters.

It was reasonable though, as Shaman Grandmasters possessed Shamanic Spells to protect themselves, so in general, they could not be demonised and were instead killed in an encounter with the Masters of the Demon Race. How could there be any left over for Yang Kai?

In addition, the Demon Beasts under the command of the various Demon Kings were also sent over one after another.

Originally, the cavalry of the Shaman Niu Clan only had a few dozen people in it, but now that number had increased to a thousand. A cavalry of a thousand people charging together should not be underestimated, and they would certainly play a great role in the future war.

As the number of people expanded, each army unit naturally needed to be reorganized, but Yang Kai did not intervene in this matter and simply allowed Yue and Lu to take charge of it because he believed in their abilities.

The Aerial Cavalry went out to investigate frequently, and the scope of investigation got farther and farther with each passing day.

According to the information received, the counterattack of the Barbarian Race in the surrounding region had been very effective, and they had recovered a large area of lost land. They had more victories than defeats wherever their armies went, and this forced the Demon Clan to withdraw north step by step.

The boundary of their vast territory had shrunk, and the forces of the Demon Clan gradually began to gather together in larger groups. The resistance encountered by the Barbarian Race was also growing stronger and stronger, and each battle became increasingly intense. Several huge Clans had used their full strength to fight with the Demon Race, but still ended up evenly matched in battle.

Anyone with a little foresight knew that scattered wars would not be happening in the coming days while large-scale engagements between the two races were now inevitable.

Sure enough, one day a month later, a sharp horn suddenly blared in the city. This was a call to assemble.

At the same time, there was a knock on the door at Yang Kai’s room, and Yue’s voice came from outside.

Yang Kai got up, opened the door, and saw that the twins were standing outside with a serious look. Yue immediately reported as he appeared, “Sir, the Shaman Kings have summoned all the clansmen of the Southern Barbarian Clan to gather at the Twin River Boundary!”

Yang Kai’s face turned solemn, “When is the deadline?”

“Within ten days.”

“Is there going to be a confrontation there?” Yang Kai frowned.

Yue replied, “The message says that there are more than a dozen Demon Kings gathered together, so we need to bring all the power of the Southern Barbarian Clan to bear.”

“More than a dozen Demon Kings…” Yang Kai raised his brow. The first thought that came to mind was whether there were any of his own people among these dozen Demon Kings. If so, the matter would be easy to handle.

The horns inside the city continued blaring loudly. Since it was an order given by the Shaman Kings, Yang Kai naturally could not go against it, so he quickly announced, “Let the clansmen be prepared to depart within two hours.”

“Yes!” The twins nodded and left.

Two hours later, nearly twenty thousand people assembled outside the city. Instead of riding on a Giant Eagle, Yang Kai mounted on the back of a huge Demon Beast as he looked around at his army without saying too much, simply waving his hand as he roared, “Move out!”

The coordinated marching started, and the rhythm of stomps was like a beating war drum. Twenty thousand people divided into more than twenty units and marched towards the Twin River Boundary.

A moment later, Yang Kai turned to Bao Qi and said in a low voice, “Get in touch with Fei Li and get a report on the situation with the Demon Race.”

Bao Qi gave a small nod and soon a black crow flew out of his body, flapping its wings and disappearing from everyone’s vision. At this point, the Barbarians were not surprised by such a sight anymore.

The marching of twenty thousand people was not a simple thing. The coordination, cooperation and vigilance among various groups required active communication and precise orders. Although it was the first time Yang Kai was commanding so many people, he still had the experiences and temperament of an Emperor Realm Master while his Divine Sense was incredibly powerful. Therefore, although he was not very well adapted in the first few days, he very soon got the hang of it and could issue all kinds of commands in an orderly manner, like a real commander who was thoroughly experienced in the art of war.

Although the size of the troops was massive, their progression was not slow at all.

Along the way, they came across some scattered soldiers of the Demon Race, who were all slaughtered effortlessly, which greatly raised the morale of the Shaman Niu Clan.

But Yang Kai felt a slight unease in his heart.

Because Fei Li did not return any reply, which made him feel that something was wrong. Fei Li was marked by his Soul Imprint and became his slave. Although he could not scan the former’s thoughts because of the distance between them, Yang Kai knew that Fei Li couldn’t betray him.

But after another few more days, there was still no message from him, yet Yang Kai could perceive that Fei Li was not dead.

It was not until the seventh day that a small black spot appeared in the sky. Yang Kai looked up and confirmed that it was a black crow that was formed from the Demon Qi, which was the most common way of long-distance communication between Demon Kings.

The black crow flew straight towards them, circled over the army for a while, and then landed on Bao Qi’s shoulder.

Bao Qi caught the black crow, and the lifelike animal immediately turned into a wisp of black Qi which was then inhaled into his body.

Followed by a tremble, Bao Qi put on a horrified face, and turned to Yang Kai, “Mo Duo… has come!”

“What?” Sha Ya’s beautiful face turned pale too, and looked at Bao Qi in shock, “How is that possible?”

Yang Kai frowned and questioned, “Who’s that?”

He could guess from the expressions of the two Demon Kings that this Mo Duo was definitely an incredible figure, otherwise his mere presence would not frighten Bao Qi and Sha Ya so much, and given that the name itself could have such a terrifying effect, it must be…

“Mo Duo is a Demon Saint!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Yang Kai was puzzled, “Aren’t all the Demon Saints recovering from their injuries? What is going on with this Mo Duo then?” He turned to Sha Ya and asked. All the information he had regarding the situation of the Demon Race was provided by Sha Ya. Earlier, Sha Ya did say that the Demon Saints were recuperating, and the information obtained by the Barbarian Race also proved her statement.

If the Demon Saints were all injured, they couldn’t be fully recovered in just a few months.

Sha Ya replied with a pale face, “Senior Mo Duo, he… is probably new here.”

“New here?”

Bao Qi explained, “Just arrived recently.”

Yang Kai was taken aback, “Can this be done? Can you send a Demon Saint over here from your Demon Realm at any time?”

If so, the Barbarian Race would have no hope at all. The Demon Saints had a hard time in the last War of Saints, and it was the same for the Shaman Saints. Both sides were racing against time to heal their wounds, so the Saints of both Races were not active in recent months.

But if the Demon Realm could casually send other Demon Saints here, the Barbarian Race definitely could withstand the pressure.

Bao Qi shook his head, “It’s impossible under normal circumstances. The opening in the World Barrier created by Great Demon God last time has reached the limit for allowing Demons to pass through. If more Demons pass through, the opening will certainly become unstable, meaning we won’t be able to return. Regarding Senior Mo Duo… perhaps he paid some kind of heavy price to arrive in this land.”

Sha Ya continued, “The abilities of Demon Saints are unimaginable. Maybe there is something that we don’t comprehend or understand.”

Bao Qi took in a breath softly, “In any case, Demon Saint Mo Duo is here now, and his goal is the Southern Barbarian Clan.”

Yang Kai’s face changed.

“Sir, we can’t proceed. The reason why Fei Li replied so late is that he didn’t dare to simply spread the news when Demon Saint Mo Duo was around, but according to the information he obtained, Demon Saint Mo Duo is going to destroy one of your Clans this time and show your Barbarian Race the consequences of defying the Demon Race. The reason why he hasn’t acted yet is simply that he is waiting for all of you to gather together. Once the time is right, he will personally exterminate your whole army.”

Sha Ya tried to convince Yang Kai too, “Yes, Sir, we need to withdraw.”

Yang Kai glanced at them and responded in a deep voice, “If it were you, would you go forward bravely or retreat in fear?”

They did not answer. Not to mention what Sha Ya would do, but Bao Qi definitely would move forward bravely. Twenty thousand people was not a small number, and once they joined together with the rest of the South Barbarian Clan, it may have unexpected effects. It may or may not turn defeat into victory, but it would definitely increase the strength of the South Barbarian Clan.

Both of them already knew Yang Kai’s choice.

“Speed up!” Yang Kai bellowed, urging his Demon Beast mount, causing it to immediately accelerate.

The Shaman Masters started to chant their incantations, and one radiance after another of the Light Body Spell shrouded the army, allowing their marching speed to dramatically increase.

They used a day to achieve a two-day journey as their destination was not far away now.

But at this time, a notably uneasy aura suddenly enveloped everyone from all directions. It seemed as if the whole world was aware of something abnormal and was giving out warnings to all beings who existed in his region.

The Demon Beasts of the cavalry obviously felt uncomfortable, and roared uncontrollably. Several dozen Demon Beasts even ran wild and tried to escape, causing the orderly march to turn chaotic.

Yang Kai frowned and looked up to the front as if he felt something. He narrowed his eyes slightly and raised his hand to stop the advance of the army.

The Demon Beasts were getting more and more restless and while the cavalry tried to suppress them, it was to no avail.
