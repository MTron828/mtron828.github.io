“Bead of Winter? What’s that?” Zi Yu looked at Yang Kai in surprise. From the way he spoke, it seemed he knew what this bead was and what its purpose was. Moreover, it should have a deep relationship with the red bead in his hand, otherwise it should be impossible for them to resonate like this.

“I’ll explain to you later!” Yang Kai gulped. The huge surprise left him shaken, and he wasn’t in the mood to explain things to Zi Yu.

He had never thought he would find the Bead of Winter in Ice Heart Valley’s Restricted Area!

Back in the Four Seasons Realm, Yang Kai obtained three beads; the Bead of Spring, the Bead of Summer, and the Bead of Autumn. Each bead contained the power of a different Principle Strength. Yang Kai guessed that there should also be a Bead of Winter that embodied the Principle of Winter. Only after the Principles of Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter were brought together would the Principle of Four Seasons, and subsequently Flowing Time, be revealed. Unfortunately, Yang Kai didn’t find the Bead of Winter back then, nor did he know where it was and could only put the matter aside for the time being.

He kept the three beads, and for the longest time, they didn’t have any use.

But today, he managed to find the missing one, the Bead of Winter! This was truly an unexpected surprise. He came here only because Bing Yun asked him to check which disciple had tried to contact her, and he didn’t expect to find the last bead here.

The happiness he felt was hard to describe.

With the Bead of Winter before his eyes, Yang Kai technically had all four beads and could begin to comprehend Flowing Time Force! He was curious to see what kind of benefits it would bring him.

[Still, why is the Bead of Winter in Ice Heart Valley’s Restricted Area?] Yang Kai thought about it for a while and concluded that Bing Yun might have also gone to the Four Seasons Realm when she was in the Dao Source Realm and obtained the Bead of Winter from there. Then, she brought the bead to the Northern Territory, founded Ice Heart Valley, and left it here. Afterwards, the energy inside the Bead of Winter transformed into cold energy, forming this ice lake and Restricted Area.

If that was the case, wouldn’t he destroy this entire Restricted Area if he were to take the Bead of Winter away?

Considering all this, Yang Kai began to hesitate.

He felt that if he told Bing Yun the whole situation, she would give him the Bead of Winter; after all, if the Bead of Winter stayed here, it would only allow Ice Heart Valley’s disciples to come to this Restricted Area and gain some slight benefits, but if it were in his hands, he could perhaps obtain Flowing Time Great Emperor’s Inheritance!

That was the essence of a Great Emperor’s lifelong pursuit of the Martial Dao, something much more valuable than this Restricted Area.

When Yang Kai was pondering whether or not he should take the Bead of Winter away, the bead suddenly released a pure-white beam of light that shot toward the sky.

“Oh no!” Zi Yu paled and shouted, “Senior Brother Yang Kai, quickly put your bead away!”

Yang Kai also realized that the situation wasn’t good. Bing Yun had refined this bead, which allowed it to release some of its power, making it completely different from the beads in his possession, which were basically inert. The reason it suddenly released that beam of light should be because of the sudden appearance of the Bead of Summer.

The beam’s sudden appearance was going to alert the whole of Ice Heart Valley, and as it came from the Sect’s Restricted Area, many Masters would soon gather to investigate.

Therefore, Yang Kai didn’t hesitate. Before Zi Yu’s voice could fade, he stuffed the Bead of Summer in his Space Ring then stretched out his hand toward the Bead of Winter.

Since things had come to this, it was better to take the bead first and put the other matters off until later. In the worst case, he could explain things to Bing Yun once they got back to Ice Moon City and ask her formally for the Bead of Winter.

The omnipresent cold turned his hand purple, with frost starting to appear on his skin. Yang Kai immediately lost all feeling in his hand and hurried to stimulate his Source Qi to ward off the cold.

After grabbing the Bead of Winter with much difficulty, Yang Kai quickly put it in his Space Ring. Only then did he start to feel a little better.

In the next moment, he grabbed the dumbfounded Zi Yu and shouted, “Let’s go!”

Zi Yu said, still in a daze, “Senior Brother Yang, why did you steal our Ice Heart Valley’s artifact?”

She still hadn’t returned to her senses after witnessing what had happened. If not for the fact that Yang Kai took out Bing Yun’s token earlier and explained why he had come here, she’d have likely attacked him.

He dared to steal a core artifact from Ice Heart Valley’s Restricted Area right in front of an elite disciple like her. That was daylight robbery!

“Senior Bing Yun asked me to retrieve this bead. She has some use for it!” Backed into a corner, Yang Kai spouted some random nonsense.

“Oh…” Zi Yu didn’t doubt him and no longer dwelled on the matter.

Yang Kai grabbed Zi Yu with one hand and held Bing Yun’s token with the other, quickly disabling the Restricted Area’s barriers to escape outside.

At this time, Ice Heart Valley was in an uproar. Countless disciples who were either resting or meditating were alarmed by what happened in the Restricted Area and left their rooms, either standing in place absentmindedly or rushing towards the Restricted Area to check the situation.

The quickly approaching wave of weak and strong auras frightened Yang Kai.

Ice Heart Valley was worthy of being considered one of the top Sects in the Northern Territory; even without Bing Yun, it had countless Masters. There were over a dozen First and Second-Order Emperor Realm Masters in this Sect, a force that wasn’t too inferior to the Southern Territory’s Azure Sun Temple. The only difference was that they did not have a master on par with Wen Zi Shan. From this, it was obvious that Ice Heart Valley’s background was really deep.

However, even a Sect of this level couldn’t bear the Seeking Passion Sect’s pressure and was forced to betroth their best disciple to Feng Xi. It was clear that the Seeking Passion Sect’s overall strength was superior to Ice Heart Valley.

The fact that the valley was in an uproar worked in Yang Kai’s favour as he carried Zi Yu away. He carefully avoided all the Emperor Realm Masters and wasn’t discovered by a single person along the way.

Zi Yu was more anxious than ever. When she escaped the last time with her Honoured Master’s help, the experience wasn’t this stimulating. Back then, she only wanted to disappear from the Northern Territory and not let anyone from the Seeking Passion Sect find her, but this time, she was running away with a man. It almost felt as if she was eloping with this Senior Brother called Yang Kai.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

If someone saw them now, she wouldn’t be able to explain the situation no matter how hard she tried. Just the thought of that sent her heart racing.

“Who goes there?!” Someone suddenly shouted from nearby, and in the next instant, a light flashed and peerless Sword Intent fell from the sky, covering Yang Kai and Zi Yu.

Zi Yu’s face changed as she realized that it must’ve been the fluctuation in her mood that caused her aura to leak and expose their whereabouts, a truly great shame.

But then, she suddenly felt a gentle power push her outside the incoming Sword Wave’s range. Next, Yang Kai drew his own sword and parried the descending slash.

The sound of metal colliding echoed, followed by a light shout of surprise. The newcomer gracefully retreated, seemingly not intending to go for the kill.

Yang Kai took advantage of this opportunity to gasp for breath. His face became slightly pale, and his body shook as he forcefully purged the ice-cold Sword Intent covering his body.

He rejoiced that the one who had come first was a First-Order Emperor. Otherwise, he might’ve been unable to resist. He had fought a few First-Order Emperor Realm Masters, accumulating a lot of precious experience, allowing him to put up a decent resistance without immediately falling into a disadvantage.

“Yu’er!” The woman who had appeared frowned and shouted, “What are you doing here?”

Yang Kai relaxed after hearing this. From the way this woman spoke, she seemed to be one of Zi Yu’s Seniors. Moreover, she must be someone close to Zi Yu, otherwise she wouldn’t call Zi Yu so affectionately. Since she liked Zi Yu, she shouldn’t make things difficult for her.

Only now did Yang Kai have an opportunity to take a good look at the other party. This woman had a youthful continence and a petite figure, like a young girl’s. She wielded cherry dual swords and possessed a kind of spring-like beauty. Her tightly wrapped robes emphasized her rather luxurious figure, resulting in a scene pleasing both to the eye and mind.

But as she was someone who had cultivated to the Emperor Realm, her outward appearance couldn’t be used to deduce her age. This ‘young girl’ was obviously a few thousand years old.

“Seventh Martial Aunt!” Zi Yu shouted as she looked at the young woman, begging for her mercy with her expression.

“You actually managed to leave the Restricted Area. Is he the one who saved you?” The young woman that Zi Yu called ‘Seventh Martial Aunt’ pondered for a moment as she looked at Yang Kai, sizing him up with her pretty eyes, as if she wanted to see through all his secrets.

Her eyes were pure and flawless, clear as water, and when they met with Yang Kai’s, he felt as if all the darkness in his heart melted away. This left him shocked, realizing that this woman was cultivating some kind of profound technique that could affect one’s Soul.

“Yes, he is Senior Brother Yang!” Zi Yu hurried to nod, “Senior Brother Yang, this is my Seventh Martial Aunt, Zhang Sun Ying. She has always treated me well.”

She added that last part to prevent Yang Kai and her Seventh Martial Aunt from falling out.

“So, it is Senior Zhang Sun. Junior Yang Kai greets Senior!” Yang Kai hurried to cup his fists.

Zhang Sun Yin snorted, “No wonder you didn’t agree to the marriage, it seems your heart already belongs to someone else.”

Zhang Sun Ying’s thinking was very simple. Unless Yang Kai and Zi Yu had an incredibly intimate relationship, why would the former risk his life and sneak into Ice Heart Valley? If a man was willing to risk his life for a woman, it could only be for love. Only love would make someone act so foolhardy.

Zi Yu’s face reddened as she waved her hands frantically, “Seventh Martial Aunt, this is a misunderstanding. Senior Brother Yang is here on Ancestral Founder’s orders.”

Zhang Sun Ying’s body trembled hearing these words; however, she quickly calmed down and sighed, “Don’t deceive me. Honoured Master has been gone for more than three thousand years… Just go… I’ll act as if I didn’t see you.”
