“Right.” Wu Kuang nodded, “You must have gotten this Star Chart from that Star Field.”

“You can tell?” Yang Kai looked at him in astonishment.

Wu Kuang smiled, “It’s not that this King has good eyesight, but it’s because only those Star Fields can produce such a Star Chart.”

“Why is that so?” Yang Kai questioned.

Although he could not wait to kick Wu Kuang out of his Knowledge Sea, he did not always have the chance to meet someone who could clarify his doubts, so he wanted to seize this opportunity to get answers, and he believed it would not be too late to kick him out later after he got his answers.

After pondering for a moment, Wu Kuang answered, “In this world, everything has a Source. Trees have Wood Sources, Divine Spirits have Divine Spirit Sources, even the dazzling stars have Star Sources. Source Strength, which is the origin of strength, is mysterious and boundless. The World Force is the World’s Source Strength. It is the power that has existed ever since the birth of the world. If any cultivator can spy and learn even a sliver of knowledge from a true Source, they will benefit immensely.”

Yang Kai listened attentively. Even though the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was a bane to the world, his immense strength and knowledge were undeniable facts. Therefore, it was a precious opportunity for him to give a lesson.

Wu Kuang pointed his finger at the sky above his Knowledge Sea, and proclaimed in a soft voice, “This Star Chart is also a Source.”

Yang Kai muttered, “This is also a Source?”

Wu Kuang smiled faintly, “Of course, and it’s not just a normal Source, it is a Star Field’s Source!”

“A Star Field’s Source?” Yang Kai immediately went wide-eyed.

Wu Kuang ignored Yang Kai’s reactions and continued, “You can think of it as the Source Strength of an entire Star Field. With your current ability, this King is afraid that you are incapable of refining it properly. If you could refine it, though, you would find that it is extremely useful. However… you won’t have that chance.”

“A Star Field’s Source!” Yang Kai murmured repeatedly, then he asked humbly, “What is the use of refining it? Can it also bring benefits to our cultivation just like a Star Source?”

Wu Kuang snorted, “That is just a small part of its role. The cultivation speed of a cultivator with a complete Star Source is faster than other cultivators, because that Source can help that cultivator in comprehending many things, such as Principle Strength. A cultivator with a complete Star Source has a much better head start than the other cultivators. As for the role of this Star Field Source, it is several dozen times greater than a complete Star Source, even up to a few hundred times.”

Yang Kai could not help taking a deep breath.

Although he had many complete Star Sources now, he was stunned by the fact that the Star Field Source was several dozen to a few hundred times greater than a Star Source.

“In addition, if you can refine this Star Field Source, it means that the entire Star Field has recognized your existence. Then, you can become the owner of that Star Field and control the destinies of everything in it with just a thought!”

Yang Kai asked with a thoughtful look, “Isn’t that the same as being a Star Master?”

Back when he was the Star Master of Shadowed Star, he could control everything on Shadowed Star with a single thought. He could also ignore the barriers of space and travel to any places on the Shadowed Star at will.

According to Wu Kuang, one could gain similar authority by becoming the owner of a Star Field.

Yang Kai could not help feeling exhilarated. The Star Chart in his Knowledge Sea was the Star Chart of Heng Luo Star Field, so if he could fully refine it, he would become the true owner of Heng Luo Star Field and have the entire Heng Luo Star Field under his control.

“You could say so, but the owner of a Star Field has an even higher authority.” Wu Kuang suddenly lifted his head and changed the topic, “However, it is not simple to refine a Star Field Source. This King had destroyed countless Star Fields in the past and only found several Star Field Sources, but this King has never succeeded in refining them.”

“Why?” Yang Kai was bewildered.

Wu Kuang grinned, “Because those Star Field Sources rejected this King, so this King devoured them in anger.”

The corner of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched.

Wu Kuang continued, “No matter how badly the entire Star Field is damaged, as long as the Star Field Source still exists, the Star Field will eventually be restored, but if the Star Field Source is destroyed, the Star Field is done for. Just like a human’s Soul, once it is extinguished, you will never be able to be reborn again!”

“And you destroyed those Star Fields, knowing that!?” Yang Kai spurned.

Wu Kuang snorted coldly, “Anything that dares to resist this King will never have a good ending, it doesn’t matter if it is a human or a Star Field!” He looked at Yang Kai coldly as he spoke, heavily pressuring him, as if he was warning Yang Kai indirectly.

Yang Kai pretended not to notice this threat, but when he was about to ask for more secrets, his expression changed suddenly.

“Alright, that’s all for the gossip. This King only exchanged a few words with you because this King is in a good mood. If you give up your body as an offering to this King, this King will spare your life.”

Yang Kai snorted, “If you want my body, take it yourself.”

Wu Kuang slowly shook his head, “This King wanted to keep you alive as you are a man of great potential. But since you are so stubborn, your life is no longer needed.”

As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and waved. In an instant, an arrow-like attack was formed and shot towards Yang Kai like lightning.

Yang Kai’s face changed and his entire Knowledge Sea responded to his alarm, roiling as the flaming seawater condensed into many layers of strong and tough protection in front of him.

Wu Kuang snorted, “This King is the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, even if this King has been weakened after tens of thousands of years, my strength is not something you can resist! If you don’t want to suffer, don’t struggle!”

As if to prove his remark, the incoming attack shattered all the protective layers with ease as it shot forward.

Yang Kai felt a tearing pain in his Soul and had to use all his focus to resist the attack while hurriedly retreating.

*Hong Hong Hong… *

After a long while, the arrow-like attack was finally resolved after chasing Yang Kai for a few laps around his Knowledge Sea. He looked like he was in dire straits, and his Soul Avatar turned gloomy from suffering serious injuries.

Whoever won or lost in this battle, Yang Kai would still suffer a loss, because this was his Knowledge Sea and anything destroyed here was related to him.

“You can block the first blow of this King, but can you block the second or third?” Wu Kuang looked at Yang Kai disdainfully. He raised his hand and was about to unleash another terrifying attack.

However, Yang Kai did not show much panic on his face and simply looked at Wu Kuang with a playful smile and replied, “It is definitely still too early for this Young Master to fight an old monster who lived for tens of thousands of years like you, but fortunately this Young Master is not your opponent today. Your opponent is someone else!”

“Someone else?” Wu Kuang frowned, wondering who the other person Yang Kai mentioned was. All of a sudden, a figure emerged behind him and slammed a palm strike at his back.

Wu Kuang never expected that someone would ambush him in such a place and he was caught completely off guard.

With a bang, Wu Kuang grunted in pain as his Soul Avatar flashed wildly and was forced back.

After regaining his balance, Wu Kuang glanced up painfully and saw the appearance of the person who ambushed him, rebuking with his teeth gritted, “Old thing, didn’t you self-destruct? Why are you not dead yet?”

The ambusher who emerged behind him was the Bustling World Great Emperor!

Wu Kuang had no idea how Yang Kai communicated with Duan Hong Chen and allowed the latter’s Soul Avatar to secretly enter his Knowledge Sea.

Right now, two Great Emperors’ Soul Avatars had gathered together in the Knowledge Sea of a newly promoted Emperor Realm Junior; it was a spectacular scene that had never before happened in history.

Duan Hong Chen snorted coldly, “This Old Master knew what you were up to when you put on that show! Before this Old Master self-destructed, you blew up the Primordial Astral Wind to cover this Old Master’s sight and senses in order to perform your Empty Cicada Shell Technique. Since your skeleton had been destroyed, you could only find a new host, and there was only one person to choose in this place. This Old Master would be an idiot if he wasn’t able to guess that you were here.”

“Bastard!” Wu Kuang barked with a grim face, no longer containing the calmness he had before. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

With his ability, it would be easy to seize Yang Kai’s body; however, the interference of Duan Hong Chen’s Soul Avatar disrupted his plan. If he wanted to seize Yang Kai now, he would have to pass Duan Hong Chen first.

Wu Kuang was truly frustrated with this old man who would rather die with him than live his own life.

Duan Hong Chen looked ahead with a cold and determined face, declaring, “Wu Kuang, you must die today. You don’t have a second choice!”

Wu Kuang could not help acknowledging these words filled with conviction. Afterall, Duan Hong Chen was determined enough to self-destruct earlier just to take him down.

“We have tens of thousands of years of friendship, so why must you cause trouble for this King!?” Wu Kuang roared with a darkened face.

Duan Hong Chen’s eyes were emotionless as he replied indifferently, “It’s not that this Old Master wishes to cause troubles for you, but it is you who brought this upon yourself. Your sins can only be cleared with your death. If you had chosen to be righteous, you would never have ended up in such a situation today.”

“Stop preaching to this King!” Wu Kuang was maddened, “This King has seen the ways of the world better than you. Legitimacy belongs to the victors; losers are always in the wrong. Duan Hong Chen, if you don’t embarrass this King today, this King will promise not to trouble you in the future and this King will never interfere in anything related to you.”

Duan Hong Chen responded lightly, “Are you begging for mercy?”

“Don’t underestimate this King. This King is just giving you a chance,” Wu Kuang gritted his teeth with a vicious look.

Duan Hong Chen sighed, “Then it seems like we really have nothing left to discuss. This is truly a tragedy.”

The two Great Emperors fell silent at once, staring at each other, sparks flying as their sights collided.

The seawater below seemed to be disturbed by their silent confrontation and was constantly tumbling.

Yang Kai’s face turned ugly as he pleaded, “Can you both talk outside?”

Seeing these two people were about to fight in his Knowledge Sea gave Yang Kai goosebumps. He was afraid that his Knowledge Sea would be unable to bear the battle of two Great Emperors and it would not end well for him. However, he was just an ant in front of the two Great Emperors, not worth noticing, so how could he possibly chase them out?
