Xia Ning Chang’s living conditions improved dramatically as she was granted her own independent palace as well as several young and beautiful maidservants to take care of her daily needs. All she needed to do was relax and perform Alchemy for Chi Yue.

All of this was in line with Yang Kai’s expectation.

“Grandmaster Xia, these materials have been allocated to you by Lady Tribal Lord. Master hopes to see the finished pills within a month,” Outside Xia Ning Chang’s private chambers, a maidservant in green handed her a Space Ring.

“I’ll take it,” Yang Kai smiled as he stuck out his hand.

The green clothed maid frowned slightly, seemingly displeased, but she did not refuse and gently placed the Space Ring into Yang Kai’s hand.

Yang Kai Divine Sense swept the contents of the Space Ring before snorting lightly, “Why are there so few materials?”

“So few? There are enough materials for forty Origin Grade pills inside,” The green clothed maid frowned.

“En, truly too few, can you bring more materials?” Yang Kai asked.

“I can, but... the other Grandmasters in the palace only use so many materials per month, if any more are brought, there won’t be enough time to completely refine them.”

“How can those people compare to my Little Senior Sister!” Yang Kai spat disdainfully, “Go bring more materials! The more the better!”

The green clothed maid looked over at Xia Ning Chang awkwardly. Honestly, she did not like Yang Kai very much. The rumour was that Yang Kai was a boy toy who only relied on women for food. His poor reputation had already propagated throughout the entire palace.

No woman would hold a good impression of such a man.

Worse, while he had already deceived this female Alchemy Grandmaster, he wasn’t satisfied and was now stretching out his claws towards Young Lady Shan Qing Luo. Sadly, Lady Qing Luo’s eyes seemed to have been blinded somehow and she was unable to see through the true shameless nature and corrupt soul of this man.

Inside the palace, almost everyone was sighing for Shan Qing Luo, feeling like a beautiful flower was willingly being planted in cow dung, eliciting strong feelings of indignation.

Now, listening to Yang Kai boast so shamelessly, the green clothed maid’s already poor impression of him dropped further.

However, Lady Tribal Lord seemed quite taken with this new Alchemy Grand Master, so it wasn’t easy for the maid to refuse. As a last resort, the green clothed maid sought Xia Ning Chang’s opinion on the matter.

“Do as Junior Brother says,” Xia Ning Chang said softly, “If Lady Tribal Lord asks, you can just say I requested the materials, she won’t disagree.”

“Yes!” The green clothed maid nodded helplessly.

“By the way, those Grandmasters in the palace, what is their average probability of success in Alchemy?” Yang Kai asked suddenly.

“Twenty percent!” The green clothed maid replied indifferently, “For every ten sets of materials, they succeed in refining pills twice!”

“Understood, many thanks!” Yang Kai smiled and cupped his fists.

The green clothed maid looked at him seriously, as if she wanted to say something, but after hesitating for a while, she couldn’t vocalize her thoughts. Nodding to Xia Ning Chang, she simply turned and left.

“That girl doesn’t seem to like me very much,” Yang Kai looked at her back and laughed dryly. He understood why the other party was giving him such a disgusted look, but he didn’t take it to heart.

“Junior Brother, isn’t this a little improper?” Xia Ning Chang looked at Yang Kai worriedly.

“How is it improper?”

“These are Origin Grade materials in the end, their value isn’t low. If we do this, isn’t it equivalent to stealing materials from Red Moon Tribal Lord...” Xia Ning Chang felt a little uneasy and guilty.

“That’s not right,” Yang Kai shook his head, “Think about it, Little Senior Sister, that girl just now said that when the other Grandmasters in the palace refine Origin Grade pills, the probability of them succeeding is only about twenty percent. That means that eighty percent of the materials they use will be wasted. But Little Senior Sister, you’re different. If you put in your best effort, even if you cannot reach a one hundred percent success rate, you will at least reach eighty to ninety percent. Even if you occasionally fail, it would be inconsequential. In the end, as long as you turn over thirty percent of the finished pills, Red Moon Tribal Lord will already make a massive profit. At the same time, we’ll gain some benefits as well. This is a good deal for everyone involved.”

“Although I understand what Junior Brother is saying, I still feel like there’s something wrong with acting like this,” Xia Ning Chang pursed her red lips lightly.

Right now, she felt like she and her Junior Brother were behaving like thieves, but since Yang Kai had asked her to do this, Xia Ning Chang would not refuse.

The two quickly dedicated their full effort to Alchemy.

To Xia Ning Chang, Alchemy was cultivation. To her, Alchemy was a kind of enjoyment rather than laborious work. On top of that, she was now a First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, and after studying the True Alchemy Enlightenment Scripture, her attainments in Alchemy had grown significantly.

In addition, the last time she successfully refined a pill with Pill Clouds in Shimmering Moon City, she had gained a much deeper understanding of the Alchemic Way. Yang Kai couldn’t help admiring her talent in the field of Alchemy.

Raw materials were transformed into finished products in her hands at an extremely efficient rate.

Yang Kai didn’t remain idle either as he focused on experimenting with the refining method left in the True Alchemy Enlightenment Scripture that would lead to one set of materials producing more than one pill.

It was conceivable that if he succeeded in this experiment, it would have a profound impact on the entire Star Field’s Alchemic Way.

This would no doubt be a groundbreaking development.

Unfortunately, Yang Kai didn’t have any clues as to how to succeed yet and could only continue refining pills while studying and comprehending the True Alchemy Enlightenment Scripture.

The Senior Sister and Junior Brother pair working together consumed the trivial forty sets of materials in just a few days.

A few days later, when the green clothed maid came over again and received a bottle with twelve pills inside of it, her eyes filled with shock.

It had only been a few days yet this young, beautiful Alchemy Grandmaster had really finished refining all the materials she had been given. On top of that, the number of pills she had refined was ten percent higher than the other Grandmasters in the palace!

The green clothed maid could hardly believe her eyes.

If it weren’t for the pills actually matching the previously delivered materials, she would have suspected that Xia Ning Chang had simply handed her previously refined pills. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

No wonder Lady Tribal Lord valued ​​her so much, she was worthy of it!

Thinking about this, the maid even more felt that Yang Kai was an eyesore. This boy toy was truly thick-skinned, sitting around all day doing nothing, forcing this innocent girl to let him remain by her side, as if he was afraid that someone would try to snatch her away from him!

However, this couldn’t be blamed on him entirely; after all, with no real ability of his own, and a need to rely on a woman just to feed himself, of course this boy toy would constantly be on guard, as a woman like Grandmaster Xia would surely have many suitors.

“Grandmaster Xia, there are a hundred sets of Origin Grade pill materials inside this Space Ring. Lady Tribal Lord has also said that if you want more materials, just ask any of the maids and the palace will supply herbs to you unconditionally,” The green clothed maid respectfully handed over the new set of materials.

“Thank you!” Xia Ning Chang smiled gently.

“Just place them down over there somewhere,” Yang Kai gestured lightly.

The green clothed maid shot him a ferocious look, put down the Space Ring in her hands, hesitated for a moment, then suddenly shouted, “Please be nicer to Master Xia, you shameless boy toy!”

After saying so, she left angrily.

Yang Kai wore a bewildered look as he knit his brow, “Why did she feel the need to scold me? I didn’t do anything to her!”

Xia Ning Chang giggled pleasantly before saying lightly, “Don’t worry about what others think, they just don’t know how good you are, Junior Brother. It’s fine as long as I know.”

Yang Kai’s heart warmed.

Xia Ning Chang lowered her head and whispered softly, “In fact, it’s better like this, I’m really afraid that more women will come to know how good you are!”

“Since Little Senior Sister has said so, then I’ll have to trouble you to take care of this boy toy,” Yang Kai laughed.

Xia Ning Chang’s face reddened as the words boy toy always reminded her of some embarrassing memories...

Red Moon Territory was among the strongest three of the ten territories on Monster Emperor Star and was rich in natural wealth. What’s more, since this was Monster Emperor Star, there were countless Monster Beasts, so the palace did not lack for herbs and other alchemy materials, including Monster Beast parts and Monster Cores.

No matter how many materials Xia Ning Chang asked for, the palace was able to satisfy her.

In order to gain as many benefits as possible from this place, Yang Kai and Xia Ning Chang spared no effort to refine pills. After receiving a batch of materials, they would refine thirty percent of them into pills that were handed over the green clothed maid when she came to deliver the next batch.

The remaining seventy percent, went straight to Yang Kai’s pockets.

There were not many opportunities to freely obtain so many high-grade Alchemy materials, so how could Yang Kai let this one pass?

In truth, the amount didn’t matter too much to Yang Kai as he was already an Origin King Grade Alchemist. Unless he used Origin King Grade materials, there was no way for him to increase his Alchemy level. No matter how many pills he refined, the only thing that would improve was his refining proficiency.

But Xia Ning Chang was different. She needed a huge base of materials to perform Alchemy in order to improve her cultivation.

As the Star Master of Tong Xuan Realm, Little Senior Sister was extremely eager to improve her cultivation so she could restore vitality to her homeland.

These materials obtained from the palace would become the stepping stones for Xia Ning Chang’s growth.

Xia Ning Chang’s outstanding performance also made Chi Yue very happy.

Although there were several other Origin Grade Alchemists in the palace, none of them were anywhere near as fast or efficient as Xia Ning Chang. It could be said that all the rest of the Origin Grade Alchemists in the palace put together were less useful than Xia Ning Chang.

Chi Yue felt that if Xia Ning Chang could work for the palace for ten years, Red Moon Territory would be able to create another hundred Origin Returning Realm masters!

This wasn’t an exaggeration; if, over ten years, the pills refined by Xia Ning Chang were given to talented Monster Race cultivators, those talents would definitely grow at a remarkable pace.

Chi Yue favoured Xia Ning Chang greatly, almost granting any request she made without the slightest delay, which naturally made it easier for Yang Kai to plunder materials.

He was already considering whether he should begin asking for Origin King Grade materials from Chi Yue.

An Origin King Grade Alchemist had never appeared on Monster Emperor Star!

This also meant that there must be a large amount of Origin King Grade herbs stored in the palace.

Yang Kai had discretely asked Shan Qing Luo about this matter and learned that Chi Yue had a special storehouse where many precious materials were preserved, including those at the Origin King Grade, a fact that excited Yang Kai greatly.
