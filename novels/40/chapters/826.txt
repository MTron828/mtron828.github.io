Chapter 827, Understanding What Needs to be Done

Wu Jie’s manner was calm, and at this moment, he seemed completely honest and upright.

After a moment, Yang Kai withdrew his hostility and sneered, “If you’re not here to fight, why appear in front of me at all?”

“Naturally to discuss something,” Wu Jie saw Yang Kai take back his murderous intent and also relaxed, letting out an evil sounding laughter

Yang Kai was stunned and couldn’t help wrinkling his brow, “Are you perhaps misunderstanding something? The two of us are sworn enemies, what is there to discuss?”

“The two of us being sworn enemies, isn’t that just Sir Holy Master’s one sided opinion?”

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes.

“My meaning is simple, this Wu is willing to exchange weapons of war for gifts of jade and silk with Sir Holy Master. I wonder what Sir Holy Master’s opinion is?”

“You might be willing, but I am not!” Yang Kai slowly shook his head, “You have pursued and harassed me for many days now, yet you think with just a few simple words you can resolve this grudge? Aren’t you being a bit too naive?”

Wu Jie wore a helpless expression and replied, “This Wu was forced to act so... Zhang Ao and Cao Guan joined forces to pressure me, so I had no choice but to go along with them. When we attacked Nine Heavens Holy Land last time, I only brought along a few people from my Netherworld Sect and I never once took action, yet my forces still suffered a number of casualties at the hands of the Monster Race.”

“You got what you deserved,” Yang Kai coldly snorted, but he also knew that what Wu Jie said just now was not a lie. During the last battle, he really had not seen many cultivators from Netherworld Sect.

“Heh heh...” Wu Jie grinned wryly, “I know that Sir Holy Master probably does not believe this Wu’s words, but how should I put it... This Wu’s Netherworld Sect’s objective has always been to collect wealth to disperse disaster. I accepted benefits from Zhang Ao and Cao Guan so naturally I had to work with them, but now, this Wu has decided to withdraw from this matter.”

“Why?” Yang Kai’s eyes flashed as he stared at Wu Jie curiously.

“Because I believe Sir Holy Master can become a great person! Zhang Ao and Cao Guan think that as long as they capture you, they can obtain the core inheritance of Nine Heavens Holy Land and become Third Order Saints, but I think they have simply been blinded by their own greed.”

“You don’t think so as well?” Yang Kai looked at Wu Jie with great interest.

Wu Jie firmly shook his head, “If becoming a Third Order Saint was really so easy, your Nine Heavens Holy Land would not only have your Holy Master break through to such a realm. If that was really the case, I’m afraid you would have already used such a method to become invincible throughout the world. Although I don’t know what that inheritance is, or what kind of secrets it hides, this Wu is clear that there is no such thing as benefits without cost. Every one of your Holy Land’s Holy Masters is short lived, and each generation only your Holy Master becomes a Third Order Saint. Although it is obvious this inheritance is quite profound and powerful, there are clearly many drawbacks as well. Even if we managed to obtain that inheritance from you, it’s not certain we will succeed in using it while the chance of failure is actually quite greater.”

“It seems you understand far more than those two,” Yang Kai couldn’t help improving his opinion of Wu Jie. This guy wrapped in black robes and green aura may seem like a sinister ghost, but his intelligence and wit were actually quite sharp.

“Sir Holy Master is too polite!” Wu Jie smiled and cupped his fists, displaying a modest and respectful manner, “It’s for these reasons this Wu does not want to become enemies with you. Also, you have proven your personal strength is out of the ordinary... I have never heard of a mere Second Order Transcendent being able to survive the pursuit of three Saints before. In fact, if it wasn’t for Zhang Ao’s Second Order Saint Realm cultivation, we would have long ago lost track of you. If things continue on like this, even if we pursue you for the rest of our lives we likely will never catch you.”

“But you actually managed to appear in front of me,” Yang Kai’s expression became cold, obviously quite concerned with how Wu Jie had magically overtaken him.

“The price I paid to do so though was enormous...” Wu Jie wore a forced smile and shook his head, “I’ll be honest with Sir Holy Master, when this Wu was young, he had a fortuitous encounter and obtained a mysterious technique which allows me to tear space and travel a thousand kilometers in the blink of an eye!”

“Tear space?” Yang Kai’s eyes shrank.

“Yes, but although this may sound simple, when executing this technique, it is easy to become lost in the Void, forever unable to find your way out. If it weren’t for us being absolutely unable to catch up to you, this Wu would never have used such a risky method! From the time I obtained this technique until now, this Wu has only used it twice, and each time was extremely dangerous.”

Wu Jie spoke very sincerely, not even concealing what method he used to appear before Yang Kai.

“Is Sir Holy Master perhaps interested?” Wu Jie suddenly smiled, “If you are, this Wu can freely offer this method to you.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai expression changed and his eyes flashed.

It would be a lie to say he was not interested in a method to tear space and instantly travel a thousand kilometers, but Wu Jie’s attitude so far was still concerning to him.

“What is it you want?” Yang Kai frowned and asked seriously.

“Sir Holy Master is quite cautious. Actually, this Wu does not want anything in particular at this moment, coming here to speak with you was simply to show my attitude... Good, Netherworld Sect is willing to always be on good terms with Sir Holy Master, I wonder if you understand my meaning?”

Yang Kai stared at him coldly and keenly grasped the key points in his words. The one Wu Jie wanted to make friends with was him, not Nine Heavens Holy Land.

For him, it was obviously more important to become friends with Yang Kai than Nine Heavens Holy Land.

“What advantage does that have for me?” Yang Kai relaxed as he could feel that Wu Jie was not telling lies because from the start, his Soul Avatar had not shown any unusual fluctuations.

“The method this Wu described earlier, could it be Sir Holy Master is not interested at all?” Wu Jie smiled, also relaxing somewhat, “This Wu does not have any particular strong points, but he understands what needs to be done! It is for this reason that Netherworld Sect could develop into the force it is today. Although Sir Holy Master’s cultivation is currently below this Wu’s, I believe that within a few years you will overtake me. I don’t want to sit idly by waiting for you to exact your revenge on my Sect, and... This Wu always felt that even if I was to fight with you now, I may not necessarily win.”

“You really do understand what must be done!” Yang Kai’s mouth curled into a fierce grin.

He suddenly found that this Wu Jie was quite interesting. Although he was no doubt a villain, he was an upfront and level headed one. Moreover, his vision and instincts were excellent. Inside this Soul Battle Hall, Yang Kai really didn’t fear him.

“Netherworld Sect received much favour from your old Holy Master and hopes to continue receiving such favour from you in the future. This Wu is not asking for much, he only wishes to secure a bright future for Netherworld Sect.”

“I can promise you that much!” Yang Kai nodded.

“Many thanks,” Wu Jie cupped his fists and bowed.

“In the future, you will rejoice that you made such a wise decision today,” Yang Kai laughed confidently.

“It seems Zhang Ao and Cao Guan are in for some misfortune...” Wu Jie said meaningfully as he exchanged a look with Yang Kai and laughed.

A moment later, he adjusted his expression and with a flick of his wrist, sent a glimmering ball of light towards Yang Kai and solemnly said, “Inside this are the memories of that fortuitous encounter this Wu had in the past. If you examine it briefly you’ll understand that what this Wu said is not false.”

“I’ll accept this then,” Yang Kai absorbed the ball of light into his Soul Avatar.

“Although this method is profound and shocking, this Wu must caution you, never use it unless absolutely necessary, otherwise you may find yourself lost in the Void, when this Wu first used it...” Coming to this point, it seemed Wu Jie recalled something terrifying and began shivering, unwilling to even remember it, “In any case, be abundantly cautious.”

“I’ll remember,” Yang Kai nodded, not bothering to check the information he received.

“There is still something I must tell you. This Wu estimates that Zhang Ao and Cao Guan will not give up on capturing you for some time so I have no choice but to continue chasing after you for a while. However, I don’t think Sir Holy Master will mind, there’s no way we can catch up to you anyways.”

“It doesn’t matter,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Good... then this Wu will say goodbye!” Having obtained Yang Kai’s promise, Wu Jie looked very satisfied.

Yang Kai waved his hand and released the Soul Battle Hall’s bindings, allowing the pairs Soul Avatars to return to their bodies in the next instant.

Wu Jie nodded towards Yang Kai and was about to depart when a frown appeared on his face and he seemingly casually mentioned, “Right, has Sir Holy Master ever seen the Coffin Carrying Man?”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed a cold light and his aura became dangerous.

Wu Jie jumped in surprise and quickly said, “No need to get so excited, I was just asking offhandedly.”

“Why do you ask?”

“Because I inadvertently heard that Cao Guan and one of his subordinates named Yao Di talking about the Coffin Carrying Man when they were talking about you, so I thought you may have seen the Coffin Carrying Man at some point.”

“Yao Di?” Yang Kai frowned, suddenly recalling a person by that name having been outside Raging Flame City that day, asking, “What else did they say?”

Wu Jie shook his head, “I didn’t hear clearly, they were quite covert in their conversation.”

As if he was speaking to himself, Wu Jie continued, “It’s rumored that the Coffin Carrying Man hides some kind of shocking treasure that anyone who unlocks his secret can obtain the power to become a supreme ruler... En, I don’t know if such rumors are true or false. Heh, well, pay it not mind, I was speaking thoughtlessly, I’ll take my leave!”

Saying so, Wu Jie flew off in a leisurely manner.

Gazing at his disappearing back, Yang Kai’s brow wrinkled.

As the saying goes, there is no smoke without fire. The rumors about the Coffin Carrying Man weren’t exactly true, but they also weren’t entirely wrong. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

On the Coffin Carrying Man’s back, there was indeed a hidden power that could allow a person to become the ruler of a vast territory, but this power could not be wielded by just anyone.

Wu Jie seemingly unintentionally raising this was obviously his way of subtly warning Yang Kai not to reveal his relationship with the Coffin Carrying Man.

This fellow... his thoughts were quite exquisite, and he was also the type who acted decisively.

Just because he was optimistic about Yang Kai’s future, he had done his best to melt the enmity between them and instead become friends. From a certain perspective, Wu Jie was quite far-sighted.

Shaking his head, Yang Kai didn’t think too much about it, turned in a certain direction and flew off.

Zhang Ao and Cao Guan were still chasing him and the former was a genuine Second Order Saint. Facing the Divine Sense probing of such a powerful master, Yang Kai had no choice but to flee as he couldn’t completely hide his aura.

In a flash, a month passed by, and Yang Kai faintly felt that he had gotten rid of Zhang Ao’s tracing.

After such a long chase, not only was Yang Kai depressed, it was likely Zhang Ao had also lost hope and had finally given up.

Spending a few more days wandering around to determine that he had really lost Zhang Ao, Yang Kai breathed a sigh of relief.

Although he was not worried about them being able to catch him, being pursued by a Second Order Saint was by no means comfortable.

Spotting a lush and verdant mountain range up ahead with extremely rich World Aura, Yang Kai spread out his Divine Sense to inspect the area but discovered only some low level Monster Beasts.

Nodding with satisfaction, Yang Kai immediately flew towards one of the mountain peaks.
