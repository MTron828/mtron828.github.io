Feng Xi threw the ring to Yang Kai and anxiously asked, eagerly looking at Yang Kai, “I gave you the ring, now can you let us go?”

Yang Kai caught the ring as a devious smile appeared on his lips and a mocking look on his face as he stared at Feng Xi.

Feng Xi’s heart pounded. [Is this guy mute?] He followed Yang Kai’s gaze, and looked at the ring on his hand, promptly making a difficult decision. Gritting his teeth, he took his own Space Ring and threw it at Yang Kai before stating, “This is also yours. Let us go!”

“Young Sect Master is so generous. You didn’t have to do that,” Yang Kai hastily took the Space Ring and put it straight into his pocket. He then immediately switched the conversation, speaking with a cold snort, “This Young Master has already said, as long as you give up on your noble Sect’s Vice Sect Master’s Space Ring, I will let you go, but Young Sect Master has now forcefully stuffed another ring into my hands for no reason. You wouldn’t happen to be thinking of framing this Young Master for injustice?”

“Ah…” Feng Xi opened his mouth wide. He had never expected Yang Kai to speak so shamelessly.

Ice Heart Valley Elders also had extremely weird looks on their faces, staring at Yang Kai with complicated gazes. Yang Kai’s performance today had truly redefined their understanding of what a moral bottom line was. Before they met Yang Kai, they had never imagined that there would be someone so shameless in this world.

Who knew that Feng Xi would suddenly be enlightened, though, and seeing the evil look on Yang Kai’s face, he hastily continued, “Brother Yang, you misunderstand. This Space Ring is just a gift from this Feng. It has no relation with your previous condition. Brother Yang is impressive and handles things extraordinarily. You will definitely become an outstanding character in the future. This Feng only… only wants to be friends with you!”

Yang Kai broke into laughter, “Young Sect Master is so generous. We can certainly be friends!”

The corner of Feng Xi’s mouth twitched as he asked embarrassingly, “Then… Can we go now?”

Yang Kai squinted his eyes and asked, “Young Sect Master, why don’t you stay for breakfast?”

“Forget it,” Feng Xi hurriedly stood up when he heard this as if had received amnesty, dragging Yao Zhuo while they staggered towards Ice Heart Valley’s exit.

After having his Space Ring forcefully taken by Feng Xi, Yao Zhou seemed to have lost his soul. His eyes were lifeless as he seemed to have lost all his hopes after seeing Feng Xi’s performance. At this moment, he was being dragged away without mounting the least bit of resistance. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

After a moment, Yao Zhou and Feng Xi had disappeared.

Only now did the Ice Heart Valley Elders finally breathe a sigh of relief. Previously, when Yang Kai had ordered them to kill these two members of the Seeking Passion Sect, holding their Martial Ancestor’s Token, they secretly broke out into cold sweat. They were afraid that this matter would force them into an unsolvable conflict. Fortunately, even though Yang Kai had robbed these two of their Space Rings, things hadn’t spiralled down to the point that it couldn’t be resolved. At least Feng Xi and Yao Zhou didn’t have to worry about their lives.

“Young Master, where is my Master now?” An Ruo Yun finally had the time to ask about this.

Yang Kai turned his head and replied, looking at her, “Senior An, don’t worry, Senior Bing Yun is safe, but it is inconvenient for her to meet you right now.”

“Inconvenient!?” Sun Yun Xiu furrowed her brow after hearing this, asking anxiously, “Why is it inconvenient?”

Yang Kai coldly glared at her and replied, “Inconvenience is inconvenience, there is no why.”

Sun Yun Xiu almost choked in anger, but she kept it choked down because she knew her Master was the one who sent Yang Kai. Moreover, he also had her Martial Ancestor’s Token, so she really had no choice at the moment.

Zhang Sun Ying asked, “Then when can we meet Master?”

Yang Kai thought for a moment and replied, “You just have to wait two or three days.” After a pause, he looked at Sun Yun Xiu and sneered, “I hope the Great Elder can clearly explain Zi Yu’s marriage after meeting Senior Bing Yun.”

Sun Yun Xiu’s face immediately turned dark, but she quickly replied, “Whether Master wants to beat me or punish me, I will bear it. It has nothing to do with my sisters.”

Yang Kai inwardly nodded. Sun Yun Xiu’s performance just now was pretty good and she gave the impression that she wouldn’t hold a grudge even though he had slapped her; however, as she had agreed to marry Zi Yu to Feng Xi, she would ultimately be punished.

She was a Great Elder, but she had pushed the Sect’s best disciple into the fiery pit called Seeking Passion Sect. However, this was an internal matter pertaining to a Sect he did not belong to, so Yang Kai didn’t say much.

An Ruo Yun, on the other hand, didn’t know what he was thinking and worriedly looked at Yang Kai and asked, “Young Master has repeatedly said that it is inconvenient for Master and it will only be possible to meet after two or three days. Could it be that Master is injured and she is recuperating now?”

All the women present had a change in their expression after hearing this.

When Bing Yun left Ice Heart Valley, she was already a Third-Order Emperor. It had already been three millennia, so Bing Yun’s strength should have grown significantly. She must be one of the top experts in the entire Star Boundary, so how could she be hurt? How many people out there could hurt her?

Yang Kai glanced at An Ruo An in surprise. He hadn’t said anything but An Ruo Yun had actually guessed it. Obviously, she was not just gentle, but also quite intelligent.

Everyone here was in the upper echelon of Ice Heart Valley, and many of them were Bing Yun’s Disciples, so Yang Kai chose not to hide it anymore. He nodded and replied, “Senior An is right. Senior Bing Yun is indeed injured.”

Immediately, all the Ice Heart Valley Elders paled.

Yang Kai hurriedly said, “There’s no cause for concern, Senior Bing Yun’s injuries aren’t serious, she’s simply recuperating in Ice Moon City at the moment. She will have recovered after two or three days!”

“Master is in Ice Moon City!?” An Ruo Yun exclaimed.

Zhang Sun Ying also asked in excitement, “Can you take us to meet Master?”

Yang Kai furrowed his brow and replied, “Senior Bing Yun is healing, won’t you be disturbing her?”

An Ruo Yun firmly stated, “We will not disturb Master, we simply wish to be closer to her. Young Master, please.”

She was a Second-Order Emperor, but at this moment, she was behaving more like a child who had been guarding the house for years, and had finally heard the news of the return of her parents. She was excited and filled with anticipation. The others, too, eagerly looked at Yang Kai with a pleading look in their eyes.

Yang Kai couldn’t stand being stared at by all these beautiful eyes so he could only agree, “Okay, okay, I will take you to see Senior Bing Yun.”

“Many thanks!” All the girls were relieved and ecstatic.

Next, An Ruo Yun instructed the disciples of the valley to activate all the barriers around Ice Heart Valley while increasing the patrols guarding the Sect. Then, the Elders all flew toward Ice Moon City with Yang Kai.

Among the dozen of them, only Yang Kai was male. It was quite an impressive sight. Furthermore, apart from Yang Kai and Zi Yu, everyone else was an Emperor Realm Master.

Such a force walking the street was naturally noticeable.

When they arrived at the gates of Ice Moon City, the cultivators guarding the city were about to step forward and interrogate them a bit, but when they saw the Emperor Realm Masters behind Yang Kai, they immediately retreated in shock, not even daring to breathe loudly.

Ice Moon City was Ice Heart Valley’s connection to the outside world, with many shops in the city owned and operated by Ice Heart Valley disciples. So, as soon as An Ruo Yun and the other Elders entered the city, Ice Heart Valley disciples constantly flew out from the shops on either side of the streets and bowed respectfully.

With this commotion, the entire Ice Moon City knew that upper echelon members of Ice Heart Valley had come to Ice Moon City in a short while. But they had no idea what they were doing in the city.

The puppet City Lord supported by Ice Heart Valley immediately ran over to greet them, drenched in sweat and trembling visibly. He thought that he had done something wrong and Ice Heart Valley’s Elders had come to punish him.

But An Ruo Yun and others just ignored him after a casual greeting, making the puppet City Lord feel sad as well as grateful at the same time.

“Greetings Valley Master An, Great Elder Sun, Elders, and congratulations on Ice Heart Valley’s marriage with the Seeking Passion Sect. It is truly an event worth celebrating. The entire world is celebrating!” Suddenly, a person flew over from the side, and landing before Ice Heart Valley’s Elders, he cupped his fists and smiled.

He was a middle-aged man and a First-Order Emperor. It appeared that he was an authoritative figure of some Sect in the Northern Territory, and by the looks of it, he was waiting here to congratulate Ice Heart Valley. When he heard that An Ruo Yun and the others had come to Ice Moon City, he proactively came to greet them.

An Ruo Yun promptly halted her step, but before she had the time to answer, Emperor Realm Masters suddenly flew over from every direction, one after another. And just like the man surnamed Hu, they continuously congratulated them.

An Ran Yun recognized these people and exchanged a few words with each of them.

The man surnamed Hu, the one who had appeared first, waited for her to finish before he curiously asked, “Valley Master An, why have you come to Ice Moon City?”

Ice Moon City was within the domain of Ice Heart Valley and was also the transit point for Ice Heart Valley to communicate with the outside world; however, the Elders of Ice Heart Valley generally didn’t come here, let alone a dozen of them all at once.

Everyone had a vague feeling that something wasn’t right. By the looks of it, it seemed as if something was about to happen, something big.

“We have something to do, ladies and gentlemen. Please make way!” Sun Yun Xiu said with a cold look on her face, “In addition, the marriage between Ice Heart Valley’s Zi Yu and Seeking Passion Sect’s Young Sect Master Feng Xi is cancelled. There is no need for any of you to remain here. You can return to wherever you came from.”

“Junior Sister Sun is a bit more direct. Please forgive her. You have all travelled tens of thousands of kilometres to come here, but our Ice Heart Valley has failed to receive you well!” An Ruo Yun gently smiled and then led her sisters into the city, leaving a group of Emperor Realm Masters stunned in their places.

After a long time, when An Ruo Yun and the others had disappeared from their sight, someone wiped the sweat from his forehead and nervously gulped before speaking, “Brother Hu Yuan, did I hear it right? Did Valley Master An and Elder Sun really say that the marriage is cancelled?”

“I heard it too.”

“Damn it, this is really worrying! What the hell are the women of Ice Heart Valley doing?” The man named Hu Yuan was also sweating and nervous.

Another person said, “I don’t know if this marriage was cancelled unilaterally by Ice Heart Valley, or if they had reached a consensus with the Seeking Passion Sect. If it was the former…”

Everyone’s expression sank as they suddenly realized something.

If Ice Heart Valley did this unilaterally, the Seeking Passion Sect definitely would not let it go.

“The Seeking Passion Sect disciples cultivate the Seeking Passion Supreme Art and take passion as their Dao. They would never easily give up the women they admire, let alone this being related to Seeking Passion Sect’s Young Sect Master. According to this one’s humble opinion, the Seeking Passion Sect will not give up on this marriage.”
