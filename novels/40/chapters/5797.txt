Xiang Shan left to focus on his breakthrough. Perhaps, it would not take him long to become a Ninth-Order Master.

Almost everyone on the Human Race’s side was busy recuperating as all of them had been injured in the last battle, the only different thing was the severity of their injuries.

Ou Yang Lie looked at Fang Tian Ci, who was controlling Yang Kai’s body, and suggested, “You should also go and recuperate. Junior Sister Xue and I will act as protectors.”

Ou Yang Lie was also injured, but his wounds were not that serious. As for Yang Xue, she was completely unharmed, just exhausted from having consumed a great deal of energy in the last fight. She would just need a little time to recuperate.

Currently, most of the Human cultivators were recovering, but with two Ninth-Order Masters personally overseeing everything, there should be no problems at all.

Fang Tian Ci nodded, “Good!”

He really did need to heal himself as his physical injuries were still quite serious. Yang Kai might have become a Divine Dragon and had astonishing healing abilities, but his consciousness was still in a coma. Fang Tian Ci had to find a way to awaken Yang Kai’s consciousness.

He immediately found a secluded spot and sat down cross-legged before stuffing a handful of pills into his mouth.

The cacophonous battlefield suddenly sunk into silence. All the Black Ink Clansmen had either died or fled, leaving behind traces of a horrific battle in the void. Most of the corpses of the Human Race Masters had been collected, but as most of them had died without an intact corpse, it was impossible to gather everyone’s remains.

As the number, as well as quality of the Masters participating in this battle were both extremely high, the loss of so many at once was extremely tragic and heart-wrenching.

“How many times has the Grand Dao evolved?” Ou Yang Lie suddenly asked.

When Yang Kai attacked and almost killed Mo Na Ye, the Grand Dao of the Universe Furnace World had undergone another evolution, but as the battle was quite intense at that time, no one had paid any attention to it.

“The last one was the eighth time,” Yang Xue replied, stuffing some recovery pills into her mouth.

Ou Yang Lie slowly nodded, “The Universe Furnace is about to close.”

According to the information provided by Blood Crow, after the Universe Furnace World’s Grand Dao underwent nine evolutions, the Universe Furnace World would close and everyone would be expelled.

The place they would reappear would be the same as the place from where they entered.

In other words, the Humans and Black Ink Clansmen would appear in the same location they entered the Universe Furnace after they were expelled from the Universe Furnace World.

This information was extremely important and could be used by the Human Race.

If things went well, they could deliver a huge blow to the Black Ink Clan; after all, the Black Ink Clan outside did not know this matter.

They knew that Black Ink Disciples couldn’t keep any secrets, but even if the Black Ink Clansmen inside the Universe Furnace World now knew, so what?

The appearance of the Universe Furnace had suddenly triggered wars across various Great Territory Battlefields. Many Black Ink Clansmen forced their way through the Human Race’s defensive lines and entered the Universe Furnace World through the projections. At that time, their entire focus was on destroying the Human Race’s opportunity, but it would have never occurred to them that when the Universe Furnace closed, everyone would return to their original location!

Currently, all the locations where the Universe Furnace’s projection space had appeared should be heavily guarded by the Human Race Army, waiting for the Black Ink Clansmen to appear to destroy them!

Of course, the Human Race had no way of interfering in places like the Barren Territory and Black Ink Battlefield; after all, they were completely under the Black Ink Clan’s control. The Black Ink Clan would be able to return safely from these two locations, but it would be difficult for them to safely return from the other entrances.

It was foreseeable that the day this Universe Furnace closed would be the day the Humans slaughtered many of them. The Human Race would definitely bag another glorious victory!

As time passed, everyone separated to recover.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Inside Yang Kai’s body, Fang Tian Ci immersed his consciousness and tried to awaken Yang Kai’s consciousness with Thunder Shadow’s help. He had thought that it would be difficult, but much to their surprise, Yang Kai’s consciousness woke up after a casual attempt!

“Big Brother, you’re finally awake!” Thunder Shadow’s surprised voice rang out in his mind.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment, thinking that he was hearing things; however, when he realized that something was wrong with his body, he finally reacted.

[Fang Tian Ci and Thunder Shadow’s consciousnesses are now sharing my body! What the Hell is going on!?]

Yang Kai’s thoughts were still stuck at the moment he had injured Mo Na Ye and was preparing to pursue him, so he had no idea what had happened after that.

“Is Mo Na Ye dead?” Yang Kai asked.

“He escaped,” Fang Tian Ci replied, “At that time, your consciousness suddenly sank into a coma and Third Brother’s consciousness awakened a step ahead of me, putting him in control of your body. As he doesn’t understand the Dao of Space, he couldn’t chase after Mo Na Ye.”

Thunder Shadow unhappily explained himself, “There’s nothing I can do about it. After Big Brother’s consciousness fell asleep, I just suddenly woke up. I also chased after him, but he was too fast. It’s all Second Brother’s fault. If he had woken up earlier than me, perhaps Mo Na Ye would be dead now.”

Fang Tian Ci was also proficient in the Dao of Space, and although his mastery wasn’t as high as Yang Kai’s, had he been in control of Yang Kai’s body at that time, Mo Na Ye would have been unable to escape.

It was just that at that time, Thunder Shadow had indeed awoken a step sooner, and by the time Fang Tian Ci’s consciousness had awakened, Mo Na Ye had already fled out of their sight. At that time, it was already meaningless for him to take control of Yang Kai’s body.

Listening to their explanations, Yang Kai roughly understood what had happened. Although he found it a bit regretful, he still stated, “As expected, a scourge will live for 1,000 years.”

Who would have thought that his consciousness would suddenly go haywire at such a critical moment? Just like how all of Mo Na Ye’s schemes had come to nothing, Yang Kai never expected that one of his schemes would lead to so many variables.

“Then what about us? What’s our situation now?” Yang Kai felt a headache coming on.

Originally, he had thought that after combining the three Selves, all of his Soul Clones would merge into one, but after waking up, he discovered that there were two other egos in his body.

He couldn’t help but recall what befell Bustling World Great Emperor all those years ago.

During the battle in the Shattered Star Sea, Bustling World Great Emperor had fallen to Wu Kuang’s scheme and had almost had his body seized by the latter. Although Wu Kuang had ultimately failed, he had still managed to fuse with Bustling World Great Emperor and share his body.

As a result, the Souls of these two Great Emperors had to reside in one body for many years, fighting openly and covertly. Wu Kuang had also used Bustling World Great Emperor’s body to accomplish many things.

Ultimately, after killing Great Demon God Mo Sheng in the Star Boundary, Wu Kuang left the Bustling World Great Emperor’s body and seized Mo Sheng’s body.

Duan Hong Chen and Wu Kuang only had two Souls in one body, but Yang Kai now had a total of three…

The only silver lining he had over Duan Hong Chen’s situation was that the two others would not oppose him; after all, these two originated from him and shared the same ideals as him.

Be that as it may, it was not good news either. If Yang Kai remained in this state for a long time, problems would inevitably appear.

“The current situation is probably a hidden danger brought about by the Three Selves Source Reconstitution Art. Although Third Brother and I originated from you, we are still independent individuals. Perhaps because the differences are too great, the fusion of three Selves is incomplete,” Fang Tian Ci postulated.

Everything from their strength, Source, and their own destiny had all fused into the main body, but their egos remained untouched, and this was the root cause of Yang Kai’s current situation.

Yang Kai lightly nodded in acknowledgement, thinking that there should be a reason. He couldn’t help but curse in his heart, [That bastard Wu Kuang, he really harmed me!]

At that time, if he hadn’t cultivated the Three Selves Source Reconstitution Art, he could have used a Supreme Grade Open Heaven Pill to advance to the Ninth Order and would not be in this awkward situation.

But he had no other choice at that time either. Yang Kai could not place his hopes on the ethereal Universe Furnace. He had to try to find some definite way to break through to the Ninth Order. Wu Kuang’s Three Selves Source Reconstitution Art happened to give him that hope.

“Actually, this problem shouldn’t be difficult to overcome,” Fang Tian Ci suddenly stated, “Third Brother and I are basically complete entities, so as long as you cut off a portion of your Soul that contains our essence, Third Brother and I will just need to find suitable physical bodies. The best option would be an infant who has just been born or is about to be born.”

This was equivalent to cultivating from the start again, but the goal this time was not the fusion of three Selves.

Yang Kai had done this before, so it shouldn’t be difficult for him to do it again.

Wu Kuang could have used this method to separate himself from Duan Hong Chen back then, but he wasn’t willing to do so mainly because he would definitely enter a period of weakness after separating. He was afraid Duan Hong Chen would finish him off during that time, which was why he was entangled with him for many years.

Yang Kai nodded in agreement, “There’s no rush, we can discuss it after we’ve dealt with Mo.”

Not to mention, he would definitely be weakened for many years after splitting his Soul. Now that the war had fully broken out between the Black Ink Clan and Human Race, and he had reached the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm, how could Yang Kai allow himself to become weak when he should be focusing on destroying Mo?

Furthermore, he didn’t know if he would suddenly fall unconscious in the future. If that happened again, having these two to take over his body was a kind of safety measure. Even if the two were unable to display his full strength, they wouldn’t be completely helpless against even powerful enemies.

“I’m not in a hurry. Big Brother can do as you see fit,” Thunder Shadow indifferently stated. At the very least, he didn’t have to worry about where to go to kill his enemies.

“What’s going on over there?” Yang Kai looked up again.

Someone seemed to be breaking through in that direction, giving off a fierce aura and energy fluctuations. Furthermore, they were giving a familiar feeling.

It was none other than Xiang Shan!

[Didn’t Xiang Shan fail to break through? Why is he breaking through again?] Yang Kai couldn’t understand.

In his mind, Fang Tian Ci repeated what Xiang Shan had said before, after which, Yang Kai understood everything.

In other words, Xiang Shan’s Supreme Grade Open Heaven Pill had not been wasted. He had indeed been interrupted at the critical moment of his breakthrough, but at that time, his Small Universe’s boundary wall had almost been completely broken. As such, even if he was interrupted, the progress he made towards a breakthrough hadn’t been lost.

This was good news. In that case, the Human Race would be able to gain four new Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters thanks to the Universe Furnace, which was in line with his initial expectations.

This time, the Universe Furnace had produced a total of nine Supreme Grade Open Heaven Pills. Yang Xue had obtained one, Xiang Shan had obtained one, and Yang Kai alone had obtained two. The main reason for this was because he had the Great Sun and Moon Marks; otherwise, it would have been impossible to find the whereabouts of these two pills so easily.

Of the two pills Yang Kai obtained, one of them had allowed Ou Yang Lie to reach the Ninth Order while the other was used to lure away the Chaos Spirit King.

On the Black Ink Clan’s side, Mo Na Ye obtained one while Xiao You had obtained another. In other words, the whereabouts of the other three Supreme Grade Open Heaven Pills were still unknown. If the Human Race and Black Ink Clan hadn’t seized them, there was a high chance they had fallen into the hands of the Chaos Spirit Clan. The Chaos Spirit Clan were natives to the Universe Furnace World and had a massive population, which gave them a natural advantage in this place.
