After a short pause, Ah Hua coldly added with a frosty expression, “If you can’t prove your worth, then jump off this wall yourself!”

The moment the words left her mouth, she shot out another arrow. The huge force blasted the giant beast that was leaping towards them to death in mid-air. Moreover, her cold and disgusted gaze was fixed on Yang Kai’s face from the start until the end; she didn’t even shift her gaze away from him at all.

“A good-for-nothing?” Yang Kai murmured, lowering his head and examining his body before he glanced around at the bodies of the other villagers… [En, in this era, this body is truly that of a waste.]

Rather, the fact that the old man with a stooped figure was the Village Chief of this village surprised Yang Kai.

Although he didn’t know what Shamanic Spell the Village Chief had used to make the giant beasts turn a blind eye to him, it was definitely not due to a stroke of luck. [A Shaman Apprentice… Going by the name, it should be the lowest realm, right? It would seem that the number of Shamans in this ancient era is extremely scarce.]

Yang Kai and Ah Hua stood on the fence and worked closely together. After experiencing that initial sense of discomfort, he calmed down and no longer felt disoriented. In any case, he had to overcome this obstacle for now as it might be a test given by this Sealed World.

As he handed arrow after arrow to her, the pile of arrows at his feet dwindled at an incredibly fast pace; however, a young boy of the Barbarian Race soon brought over more arrows to replenish their stock.

The young boy looked to be around thirteen years old and was clearly a minor. Thus, he could only help out with some logistical work. However, even this thirteen-year-old boy had a stockier and sturdier frame than most of the people Yang Kai had seen in his life. Those firm muscles that he built up were simply not something a person his age should have.

Many other underage children of the Ancient Barbarian Race like this young boy were helping out in the village, and as time passed, the Beast Tide’s attacks were suppressed greatly under the influence of the Bloodlust Spell that the Village Chief applied. The villagers managed to turn the tides on those giant beasts while paying a very small price, causing countless casualties among the invading enemy.

All the villagers seemed jubilant. Meanwhile, Ah Hua shot out arrow after arrow as if she finally saw a ray of hope in winning this battle. In contrast, Yang Kai furrowed his brow deeply. Unlike the optimism of these ignorant villagers, he felt that the situation was very unfavourable for the village. Although the giant beasts were suppressed on the surface and suffered many casualties, the truth was that the villagers had consumed too much strength to achieve this. The long and high-intensity battle made it difficult for the villagers to continue fighting.

It was obvious just by looking at Ah Hua. In the beginning, she shot arrow after arrow as swiftly as the wind, almost without stopping, each one taking down a giant beast. However, she couldn’t even draw the bow to its fullest anymore. Her hands that were holding the bow trembled and not only did she now require two arrows to kill a single giant beast, the interval between each arrow was also getting longer. If this was the case with Ah Hua, then the other archers must be facing the same issue.

Besides, the condition of the rest of the villagers outside the village was even more worrying. After being blessed with the Bloodlust Spell by the Village Chief, they had overdrawn their Blood Essence. Hence, once the Bloodlust Spell lost effect and the backlash of the technique kicked in, the hundreds of villagers fighting outside would instantly become prey to the giant beasts, not having the strength to fight back at all.

On the other hand, Yang Kai could clearly sense that the Beast Tide was biding its time even though it kept up its aggressive offence. It seemed as though there was an intelligent existence among these beasts, commanding them from behind. This leader was quietly biding its time, waiting for the perfect opportunity to win this battle in one fell swoop.

[I guess I need to take action!]

Yang Kai had not behaved rashly or taken any overt action prior to this because he had been clueless about the situation he was in. He did not know what kind of changes would occur if he were to carelessly make a move; however, as time passed, he couldn’t help being affected by the hot-blooded spirit of the Ancient Barbarian Race villagers after observing them for so long. The identity he received as ‘Ah Niu’ for some mystifying reason, seemed to have grown on him, and he started having a faint sense of belonging to this strange village.

The Ancient Barbarian Race was admirable. Their tenacious will to survive in this primitive time, fighting against all manner of disasters, was what allowed the Human race to multiply until they became the dominant race in the world today. Their strength had been passed down through the generations, allowing the Human race to flourish in this world.

[I will protect this land! I will protect this village as Ah Niu!] The blood in Yang Kai’s body boiled all of a sudden. Bending down, he picked up a huge bow lying next to him. This huge bow originally belonged to another villager, but he had lost his head to a giant leopard that came rushing at him.

Yang Kai reached out and pulled on the bowstring, letting out a loud strumming sound. It felt as if a war drum was pounding in his heart, filling him with the urge to charge forward into battle.

“Arrow!” Ah Hua stretched out her hand, staring straight ahead with scarlet eyes that gleamed with hatred. To her surprise though, she did not receive any response. Turning her head abruptly, she was about to swear at Yang Kai when her words caught in her throat. Staring at him holding the huge bow in amazement, she exclaimed, “What are you doing?!”

Yang Kai simply grinned back at her, revealing a row of pearly white teeth as he commented, “You should rest. You’re exhausted.”

The hand Ah Hua stretched out to him was trembling, and her fingers were covered in bloody cuts. When their gazes met though, Ah Hua burst out angrily, “Rest?! Where will I find the time to rest?! Don’t you know what will happen to our comrades below without the support of we archers?!”

“I know!” Yang Kai continued to smile, reaching out to pick up an arrow and nocking it onto the bow. Tilting his head, he looked at her and said, “Just leave it to me.”

“You…” She was about to say something when her eyes suddenly bulged, extreme shock covering her face. [What!? What am I seeing? Ah Niu, who is known as a good-for-nothing in the village, is drawing a bow? What’s more… he drew it fully! Where did he get such strength with those twig-like arms and legs of his?!]

Ah Hua instinctively felt as if she had seen wrongly; after all, she clearly recalled that it had been very difficult for Ah Niu to even pick up a bow and arrow during their last training session, let alone draw the bow fully. What was happening in front of her completely overturned her perception of him.

The Ah Niu in front of Ah Hua didn’t even seem to be using much strength and she couldn’t feel any explosive power coming from his muscles. Rather, it felt as if he was drawing the bow back casually. Nevertheless, he drew it to its maximum.

Drawing the bow to its fullest, Yang Kai’s expression turned solemn as he loosened the arrow.

Ah Hua couldn’t help following the trajectory of this flying arrow with her eyes.

The explosive airflow coming from the arrow was distinctly identifiable and it was clear that his arrow contained a tremendous amount of power. It was no less powerful than an arrow she shot. More importantly, this blow was powerful enough to penetrate the bodies of the giant beasts.

For some reason, Ah Hua suddenly felt a sense of confidence in the good-for-nothing standing in front of her. She believed that this arrow of his would definitely kill one of the giant beasts.

Sou…

The arrow flew past the body of a giant beast and disappeared in the blink of an eye while the villager who was fighting hard with that giant beast had been startled. The arrow would have killed him in that instant if it went just the slightest bit off course.

Ah Hu turned his head, glared at the people standing on top of the fence, and roared, “Ah Hua, watch where you aim!”

“I…” Ah Hua opened her mouth to speak with a grievous look on her face. [How could I have shot such a lousy arrow? I wouldn’t make such a mistake even if I shot with my eyes closed! It’s obvious that Ah Niu was the one who did it, you know?!]

Her feelings of being wronged turned to rage as she turned back and glared at Yang Kai, unable to believe she felt the least bit confident in this good-for-nothing. She really must have been blind!

“En, I’ve gotten the hang of it now.” While Yang Kai was speaking, he picked up another arrow and nocked it.

“This isn’t the place for you to fool around! If you don’t want to help me, then just go away!” She shouted furiously. [Even if this good-for-nothing surprised me by fully drawing the bow, what’s the point if he can’t shoot accurately? He might as well go down and fight those giant beasts head-on. Who knows? He might prove to be more useful there. All excellent archers need to go through rigorous training and countless life-or-death battles to accumulate experience, but Ah Niu has never had such experiences before.]

“Just trust me!” Yang Kai said to Ah Hua earnestly as he drew the bow swiftly and steadily.

The raging expression on Ah Hua’s froze for a moment before she sighed and said, “Shoot in a direction without people!”

Compared to this good-for-nothing’s previous performances, the fact that he could pick up a bow and arrow to help share some of the village’s burdens was rather praiseworthy.

He smiled, “That won’t happen again.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

His target was still the giant beast that Ah Hu was fighting, and when the arrow left the bow, Ah Hua barely dared to look at the outcome, for fear of seeing him accidentally hurt Ah Hu. In reality, the giant beast so happened to jump up into the air with a roar the moment the arrow left the bow. The 3-meter-long arrow penetrated the giant beast’s mouth and shot out the back of its body, the horrifying power behind the shot smashing the giant beast’s viscera and organs. The giant beast collapsed to the ground with a whimper, blood flowing from it like a fountain.

“He really did it!” Ah Hua froze in shock once more, feeling completely dumbfounded. If she recalled correctly, Ah Niu couldn’t even draw a bow before, let alone shoot an arrow. In other words, this is his first time using a bow. Although the first arrow deviated from its course slightly and frightened Ah Hu, the second arrow was scarily accurate. Just what on earth happened to this good-for-nothing?!

While Ah Hua was lost in her own thoughts, Yang Kai had already picked up another arrow. He barely paused in his actions as he drew the bow and loosed the arrow. A moment later, in the distance, a giant beast fell dead.

Although Yang Kai couldn’t sense a single drop of his Emperor Qi in this Sealed World, it seemed as though his foundation as an Emperor Realm Master was still there. The huge bow and arrows would be incredibly difficult to control for an average person, but it was nothing to an Emperor Realm Master. The first arrow had simply been an experiment by Yang Kai to accustom himself to the equipment. What came after that was simple; none of his arrows missed their marks.

Yang Kai finished a bundle of ten arrows in just a few breaths, and aside from his first arrow that failed to hit its target, the following nine each killed their targets in a single hit.

“Brother Ah Niu, how are you so amazing?” The young boy that was in charge of logistics came over with several bundles of arrows and happened to witness Yang Kai’s martial prowess, immediately admiring him greatly.

The adults in the village were always spurning Brother Ah Niu, claiming that he was a good-for-nothing in this village that not only failed to contribute anything, but even wasted their food. Most of the adults had advocated for Ah Niu to be exiled from the village and left to fend for himself. If not for the Village Chief’s kindness and Ah Hu constantly sharing his food with Ah Niu, Ah Niu would have starved to death a long time ago. However, that supposedly worthless Ah Niu actually turned out to be so amazing! He was on par with Ah Hua, the best archer in the village. Thus, the young boy felt rather confused.
