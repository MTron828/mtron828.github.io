Liu Yan had been with him for many years. The two of them had always protected and helped each other for all this time. Yang Kai really wouldn’t be able to accept it if she died just like that because of this strange rock.

If that really happened, then he would definitely unearth Ye Chong’s corpse and destroy it in order to vent his anger.

But upon careful consideration, he felt that this wasn’t very likely. Ye Chong wanted Yang Kai’s help, so there was no reason for him to direct Yang Kai to the strange rock here just to harm him.

[Yet... why was he constantly staring at Liu Yan when he mentioned the opportunity in this cave earlier?]

Yang Kai’s heart was in utter chaos. At this moment, he suddenly detected a sliver of familiar aura from that strange rock.

Yang Kai’s spirits instantly perked up when he detected this aura, “Liu Yan!”

This was definitely Liu Yan’s aura, although it was really weak. Yang Kai wouldn’t have been able to notice it if it wasn’t for Liu Yan accompanying him for so long that he became really familiar with her aura.

Her aura still being around meant that Liu Yan hadn’t died yet. She had simply been sealed in the strange rock. After he realized this, Yang Kai didn’t dare to randomly attack the strange rock anymore out of fear that he would harm Liu Yan.

However, Liu Yan wouldn’t respond at all when he tried to call her. Not only that, Yang Kai sensed from that trace amount of aura that Liu Yan was okay. Although the fluctuations were incredibly weak, there was no sign of her being injured.

It seemed as if she had gone into hibernation.

[What just happened?] Yang Kai couldn’t figure it out at all.

He carefully released his Divine Sense to investigate again, but just like last time, his Divine Sense seemed to get bitten off by a large and invisible mouth right when it entered the strange rock. Not only was his investigation fruitless, his Knowledge Sea even felt some slight pain.

It was unknown just what the strange rock was. Since it could even devour Divine Sense, it must have been extraordinary.

A tiny sliver of almost imperceptible red was spreading out from inside the strange rock and reaching its surface. Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, as he was incomparably familiar with this red aura. This was obviously the incredibly complex power of fire that Liu Yan possessed, which contained various exotic flames that were perfectly combined together. Liu Yan was the only one in the world with such an ability, with no other ability out there like it.

[Could Liu Yan be attacking the seal from inside the rock?]

Considering all this, Yang Kai’s nervousness was lessened significantly as he forced himself to calm down and carefully observe to try and think of some way to help Liu Yan.

When the red colour spread out, the strange rock suddenly vibrated as it then sent out a powerful suction force that madly absorbed all the World Energy in the surrounding area.

At this moment, a wild wind suddenly whipped up inside the cave and made a wailing sound. The incredibly dense World Energy in this Sealed World all entered the strange rock and seemed to completely disappear.

As the World Energy disappeared, the red colour on the surface of the strange rock became brighter and brighter. Liu Yan’s aura also became clearer and clearer.

Did the strange rock need World Energy? Yang Kai’s brow twitched. He didn’t hesitate at all as he waved his hand and scattered millions of Source Crystals all around the strange rock. There were so many that they almost completely filled the cave. These Source Crystals were all Mid-Rank or High-Rank, with no Low-Rank Source Crystals at all. Yang Kai had obtained all of them from that Source Crystals Lode.

Yang Kai punched again and shattered the Source Crystals into dust which enveloped the strange stone in a sea of World Energy.

It could be seen with the naked eye that the strange rock was constantly absorbing the energy around it, as if it would never stop.

...

At the same time that Liu Yan met with danger, the winds whistled outside the Thousand Leaves Sect as the grass was covered with enemies.

Thousands of cultivators arrived in front of the Thousand Leaves Sect’s Defending Array and stared with hostility at the Thousand Leaves Sect.

These thousands of cultivators belonged to different great forces, but they seemed to all be led by a middle-aged blue-haired man. This middle-aged man had cultivated an unknown Secret Art that caused his water-blue long hair to cascade freely down his shoulder as he struck a brave and heroic figure with an authoritative expression.

He was sitting on a topless large rickshaw which was being carried by sixteen people. The rickshaw was quite wide and even gave off a strong aura, so it was evident that it was a High-Grade Artifact. At this moment, the blue-haired man was calmly sipping on some tea, as if he was simply here on a carefree vacation.

Many Masters had gathered around his side.

Sky Crane City Lord Luo Jin, whom Yang Kai had taught a vicious lesson to before, was included among them. Only a short period of time had passed, but Luo Jin had taken some unknown elixirs which actually managed to heal all his injuries. It couldn’t be seen at all that Yang Kai had previously injured him, as he had an energetic expression and healthy appearance.

The two Elders who had previously been in charge of protecting Sky Illumination Palace Young Palace Master Qiu Yu were also by the blue-haired man’s side with their heads bowed. They seemed to be really deferential to the blue-haired man.

There was also an eye-catching man whose cultivation was no worse than anyone else’s. He had a back like a tiger’s and a waist like a bear’s. He had a wild appearance along with an aura all over his body that seemed highly violent. He seemed to be about forty to fifty years old.

This man stood to the side and kept glancing at the blue-haired middle-aged man while chuckling coldly. It seemed as if he really couldn’t stand the blue-haired man’s way of doing things.

These people were all Sect Masters from nearby Sects. They had similar power levels and status, but this blue-haired middle-aged man acted really high and mighty, like a crane amongst chickens, which would naturally make the others displeased.

If someone who didn’t know what was going on saw this scene, they would likely think that all the cultivators here were being led by that blue-haired middle-aged man.

The thousands of cultivators belonged to five or six great forces. After gathering here, they didn’t say a single word, as if they were silently waiting for something.

Luo Jin’s face was filled with hatred as he kept staring in front of him with both fists tightly clenched.

A few days ago, he had been holding a concubine welcoming ceremony at his City Lord’s Mansion, but someone ruined the ceremony in the middle of it. Not only was his concubine stolen away in front of everyone’s eyes, but he was also seriously injured. He likely would have died already if it wasn’t for his luck.

Although only a few days had passed, everyone in the nearby area had already heard about this incident. All the cultivators in Sky Crane City also learned about this incident.

His reputation in Sky Crane City had fallen to rock bottom. Everywhere that he went, he could sense people pointing at him behind his back. Not only that, there were now even voices of dissatisfaction inside the city who were clamouring for his removal.

Luo Jin would never be able to tolerate such a matter. He had worked hard at running Sky Crane City for so many years, and it seemed that he would soon be viewed as an equal to the Sect Leaders of the nearby Sects, so of course, he wouldn’t stand for losing everything at the final moment.

The culprit behind all of this was that little brat named Yang Kai! As long as he could kill Yang Kai and wash away his previous humiliation, Luo Jin believed that he could stabilize Sky Crane City again, and nobody would dare to say no to him again!

Luo Jin loathed Yang Kai, so he didn’t have any good feelings towards the Thousand Leaves Sect that was protecting Yang Kai. Luo Jin secretly swore that it would be fine if Ye Hen knew what was good for him, but if Ye Hen didn’t, then he would teach Ye Hen the consequences.

*Hu hu hu...*

At this moment, a beam of light shot forth from the front. The beam then descended to reveal the Thousand Leaves Sect’s higher-ups, with Ye Hen leading them. The Vice Sect Master, Elders, and so on were all behind him.

Although Ye Hen and the others had already learned of this beforehand, their expressions still changed significantly when they saw so many Masters gathered in front of their Sect Defending Array.

This was the strength of five or six great forces gathered here. There were already more than two hundred Dao Source Realm Masters present, and more than ten Third-Order Dao Source Realm individuals. The current Thousand Leaves Sect wouldn’t possibly be able to stop such a force.

Ye Hen calmed himself down, cupped his fists, and asked, “Friends, it is our Sect’s honour to have so many of you visit us. May I ask why all of you have come here without informing us first?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He also knew that the cultivators had come with hostile intentions, and that it was likely things wouldn’t be resolved in a friendly manner; however, he wasn’t afraid because of the Sect Defending Array. A normal Sect Defending Array would never be able to stop so many Masters’ attacks.

However, Thousand Leaves Sect’s Defending Array was from when they were still a top Sect, and was of an extremely high grade. No ordinary Sect Defending Array could compare. If it wasn’t for the current Thousand Leaves Sect being weak, then the Sect Defending Array’s defensive prowess could have been raised by several more levels. Not even a dozen Emperor Realms Masters combined would be able to break through its defence once the Sect Defending Array reached that level.

Even so, the current Sect Defending Array was likely more than enough to defend against the people before them. This was why even though Thousand Leaves Sect had declined greatly, they had continued to exist without being defeated.

Without being able to break through the Sect Defending Array, nobody would dare to truly confront Thousand Leaves Sect.

Right after Ye Hen finished speaking, Luo Jin was the first to jump out as he shouted, “Sect Master Ye, stop playing dumb. You really don’t know why we’re here? If you know what’s good for you, then obediently give us the little brat named Yang Kai and his friends. Otherwise, don’t blame us for not being polite.”

When Ye Hen heard this, he furrowed his eyebrows and answered, “City Lord Luo, what grudge do you have against Young Master Yang to make you so furious?”

Luo Jin felt as if he would explode in anger since Ye Hen was intentionally asking something he already knew. Luo Jin’s face was steely as he replied, “Ye Hen, are you trying to insult this Luo? You really don’t know what happened a few days ago at my City Lord’s Mansion? Or, are you trying to humiliate me on purpose!?”

Ye Hen calmly responded, “I know a little bit, but not the details!”

Luo Jin replied furiously, “That little brat caused a huge ruckus at my City Lord’s Mansion, stole my concubine, and injured my guests. This King could never possibly let him go!”

Ye Hen answered, “Why is it somewhat different from what this Ye heard? This Ye heard that City Lord Luo was taking advantage of your strength to bully the weak, oppressing men and seizing women, imprisoning Young Master Yang’s friends, and forcing Young Master Yang’s mother-in-law to get married to you. That was why Young Master Yang was forced to have a major battle against City Lord Luo. Although Young Master Yang won in the end, he still magnanimously spared your life... Forget about not being thankful to him, City Lord Luo, how come you’re now repaying kindness with enmity after just a few days?”

Luo Jin’s face kept changing colours with anger as he roared, “You’re spouting nonsense!”

Ye Hen replied coldly, “Countless guests were present that day, and everyone witnessed what happened. Is this Ye spouting nonsense, or is City Lord Luo the one who’s repaying kindness with enmity? I believe that everyone here should know for themselves.”

Luo Jin felt hot blood boiling in his heart which he almost spat out of his mouth. This was the greatest humiliation of his life, so he was furious that Ye Hen was mentioning it in front of everyone. If it wasn’t for the Sect Defending Array blocking his way, he would have charged forward to try and kill Ye Hen already.

Ye Hen cupped his fists and glanced all around him, “Friends, you should know about this matter as well. You should have a talk with City Lord Luo in order to prevent him from misunderstanding anything and doing something that both the people and Heaven would look down upon.”

The cultivators who came here seemed like none of them wanted to speak when they heard this. They hadn’t come here in order to win a debate against Ye Hen. So what if Ye Hen was speaking the truth? Yang Kai had killed the elites and Elders of their Sects. Since they knew that Yang Kai was at Thousand Leaves Sect, they naturally couldn’t leave this matter alone.
