After the situation in the Sect settled down, Yang Kai began to deal with other matters.

The first priority was naturally to heal Ye Xi Yun and the others. Among the original members of High Heaven Sect, Ye Xi Yun was not the only one injured; in fact, a vast majority of the Origin Returning Realm masters of the Sect were suffering from wounds.

These wounds were left behind from the battles with Corpse Spirit Religion. The wounds themselves had traces of Corpse Qi in them, making them difficult to heal. The insidious Corpse Qi was not only corrosive, but also had the effect of hindering Saint Qi circulation.

It required a targeted type of detoxification pill to cleanse.

Before the Corpse Qi was purged from their wounds, it would be impossible to fully recover; until now, these masters had used their powerful cultivations to suppress this Corpse Qi, then slowly used their Saint Qi to expel it from their bodies, but this process was a long and arduous one.

After Yang Kai returned, this situation changed dramatically.

Working together with Xia Ning Chang, Yang Kai refined a special pill to detoxify the Corpse Qi. After taking a single pill, the Corpse Qi was rapidly dissolved.

Without the Corpse Qi hindering their recovery, it wasn’t difficult for the High Heaven Sect masters to heal themselves with their powerful cultivations, especially since Yang Kai provided them with a large number of high-grade healing pills to use as auxiliaries.

As such, within ten days or so, the problems which had plagued High Heaven Sect’s masters for months were solved and its high-end combat power was completely restored.

During the most recent incident, because of Ye Xi Yun’s quick decisions, there was no loss of personnel from High Heaven Sect. In addition, she took away all of High Heaven Sect’s most precious treasures before she had withdrawn from the Sect, including the Red Candle Fruit piece, the Ten Thousand Year Incense, and the Nine Branch Jade Crystal Tree. Basically, High Heaven Sect’s headquarters had not suffered any losses besides being occupied by outsiders for a time.

After Ye Xi Yun returned, the Red Candle Fruit, Ten Thousand Year Incense, and Nine Branch Jade Crystal Tree were returned to their original places.

The former was the key to refining a special Origin King Pill while the latter two provided massive boosts to those who were trying to break through. All these treasures had unimaginable value to the entire Sect.

And so, High Heaven Sect had completely settled down ten days later.

Inside the main hall, Yang Kai had summoned all High Heaven Sect’s Elders.

No one knew what he was going to do, but they had all gathered promptly.

To start the meeting, Yang Kai didn’t mention anything of great importance, simply expressing his gratitude to all of the Elders for their silent contributions over the years and also saying how he was looking forward to the bright future of High Heaven Sect.

Only after some time had passed did Yang Kai suddenly smile mysteriously and say, “During my expedition, I obtained some good things for everyone. Although these things may not be able to play a decisive role on Shadowed Star, it will still allow all of you to comprehend some of the mysteries of the Origin King Realm. I believe that as long as you accumulate enough strength, you will only need to escape from the suppression of Shadowed Star’s World Principles in the future before breaking through to the Origin King Realm!”

When these words fell, the entire hall went silent as everyone stared dumbfounded towards Yang Kai, somewhat unable to digest this fantastical news.

Even Ye Xi Yun was stunned and gave a curious look towards Yang Kai, wondering what he was talking about.

The Origin King Realm had always been an unreachable legend on Shadowed Star, with even a master like Ye Xi Yun unable to take that final step. Although she chose to remain on Shadowed Star instead of accompanying Yang Kai in his most recent journey, that did not mean she had no desire towards this realm.

On the contrary, her desire to reach the Origin King Realm was stronger than anyone else’s because she already possessed the qualifications to break through, her Shi having long ago reached the grand accomplishment stage!

The reason she chose to stay behind was simply that she wanted to protect Yang Yan, fearing that some accident might have happened if no one remained behind to command the Sect.

Hearing Yang Kai’s words, she naturally was extremely interested.

“Sect Master, what kind of treasure has such amazing effects?” Gong Ao Fu asked with a smile.

Although she had only just become an Elder of High Heaven Sect, she quickly integrated herself and had managed to win the approval of most of the others in less than half a month with her steadfast personality and upright character.

As such, she had some say in such discussions.

Everyone looked towards Yang Kai curiously, waiting expectantly for him to answer.

“This!” Yang Kai did not keep them in suspense and quickly took out a dull crystal from his Space Ring.

As soon as this crystal appeared, a gentle yet profound aura filled the hall, causing all of the Origin Returning Realm masters present to wear looks of shock, bewilderment, and curiosity. Although they couldn’t quite grasp what this power was, they could tell it was some kind of deeper, more profound form of Shi.

“Domain Stone!” Yang Xiu Zhu’s eyes flashed as he quickly revealed the origins of this crystal.

Chu Han Yi and Lin Yu Rao also recognized this treasure and exclaimed together with pleasant surprise adorning their faces.

“What is a Domain Stone?” Ye Xi Yun frowned slightly. Of everyone present, her cultivation was the strongest, so she realized how deep and profound the energy pulsing from this crystal was. She had only felt it briefly, but could already sense her soul being cleansed, so it was easy for her to imagine what kind of benefits she could obtain if she cultivated with this crystal for an extended period.

Yang Kai simply smiled and motioned to Yang Xiu Zhu to explain.

Yang Xiu Zhu did not refuse and immediately explained the origins and purpose of this Domain Stone.

When they heard that this thing was actually condensed from the Domains of fallen Origin King Realm masters, the eyes of everyone in the hall lit up brightly.

When next they heard that one could comprehend the mysteries of Domain by refining this Domain Stone, every Elder in the hall began breathing heavily, staring towards the Domain Stone in Yang Kai’s hands unblinkingly, as if they were a pack of feral beasts who had just found a luscious feast.

Everyone’s eyes flashed with naked desire.

“Domain Stones are a unique product formed in the Blood Prison on Green Mountains Star. Every piece is invaluable. Although this Yang also entered to explore the Blood Prison, he was not fortunate enough to obtain such a treasure. Elder Lin, on the other hand, managed to harvest a single piece,” Yang Xiu Zhu looked at Lin Yu Rao with envy.

Lin Yu Rao smiled and took out a Domain Stone from her Space Ring so that everyone could see.

Chu Han Yi wore a blank but clearly envious look as well.

When the three of them journeyed deeper into the Blood Prison, they had gone their separate ways, and although they did not encounter any calamities thanks to their tyrannical cultivations, they also did not gain many benefits. On the contrary, Qian Tong had managed to take a step further and after leaving the Blood Prison broke through to the Origin King Realm.

If they had enough Domain Stones, they could unscrupulously consume them to comprehend the mysteries of Domain, it was nothing short of the greatest treasure a peak Origin Returning Realm master could obtain.

“Elder Lin’s luck is truly amazing!” Chang Qi sighed.

However, Chang Qi, Hao An, Ning Xiang Chen, Huang Juan and many of the others present did not have the same feelings of envy as Yang Xiu Zhu and the other peak level masters as they had only reached the First-Order Origin Returning Realm. Even if they obtained a Domain Stone, it would not be of much use to them with their current cultivation. At most, they would be able to use a Domain Stone to help them comprehend the mysteries of Shi.

After all, Domain was the evolved form of Shi, so studying the mysteries of a Domain Stone would naturally be helpful to one’s Shi cultivation.

That being said, Domain Stones still held an undeniable attraction to any Origin Returning Realm master!

After Ye Xi Yun fell silent for a time, she suddenly declared, “Sect Master, if it is convenient, this Queen wants ten Domain Stones!”

Gasps sounded throughout the hall as Yang Xiu Zhu and the others turned their heads to look at Ye Xi Yun in confusion.

Others may not know the preciousness of Domain Stones, but Yang Xiu Zhu and the others who had joined Yang Kai did. All three of them had participated in the Blood Prison Trial, but only Lin Yu Rao managed to obtain a single piece. Now, however, Ye Xi Yun actually asked for ten all at once.

This was more than just asking for the lion’s share!

It was also completely incompatible with Great Elder’s normal style!

Was this really the always benevolent and generous Great Elder? Why did she suddenly seem no different from a marketplace thief?

Yang Xiu Zhu and the others could not help feeling dazed.

Ye Xi Yun just snorted lightly, “Do you think Sect Master only had this one piece? With Sect Master’s personality, if he did not have many in his possession, how could he make such a big show of it here? He’s not the type that likes to show off his wealth to others.”

Hearing this, Yang Xiu Zhu and the other Elders suddenly understood and immediately turned scorching eyes filled with hope and expectation towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai failed to stifle his laughter as he shook his head and said, “Great Elder truly understands people’s hearts, it seems I cannot hide anything from you.”

“Sect Master...” Yang Xiu Zhu gulped audibly, his lips feeling slightly dry.

“Indeed! I did gain a lot of Domain Stones during the Blood Prison Trial... en, many!” Yang Kai didn’t try to hide anything as he smiled at everyone.

“How many... is many?” Chu Han Yi asked with a trembling voice.

“Enough for each of you to have ten!” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

*Si...*

Yang Xiu Zhu and the others drew sharp breaths as they stared at Yang Kai in admiration.

There were not many people in the hall, only about fifteen in total, including Gong Ao Fu and Dai Yuan who had recently joined High Heaven Sect. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Gong Ao Fu knew that Yang Kai did not like Yin Su Die and instead cared deeply about Dai Yuan, so she had recently started bringing Dai Yuan to accompany her instead of Yin Su Die, who seemed to have fallen into a bit of disfavour.

“Hmm... It seems that this Queen underestimated Sect Master’s capabilities, I should have asked for more,” Ye Xi Yun frowned slightly, her expression a little annoyed.

Yang Kai simply laughed loudly, “If Great Elder wants more, I can naturally satisfy her, but with Great Elder’s cultivation and comprehension of Shi, I think that two or three would be more than enough. Any more and you would have no use for them.”

“Even if this Queen cannot use them, she can keep them for others,” Ye Xi Yun said lightly, “But forget it, ten it is.”

Yang Kai did not say anything more, simply waving his hand and sending ten Domain Stones over to Ye Xi Yun.

Without even moving, Ye Xi Yun’s Space Ring flashed, and the Domain Stones were pocketed by her.

She truly displayed the skill and composure of a true master.

“Sect Master...” Yang Xiu Zhu blushed slightly as he rubbed his hands and stared at Yang Kai eagerly.

He was not the kind of person to flatter others, maintaining his upright and honest personality from his many years of cultivation on Star Emperor Mountain even after entering High Heaven Sect, but he was determined not to lag behind anyone else this time.

Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters valued Domain Stones far more than others, and although Yang Xiu Zhu had failed to break through to the Origin King Realm this time, he was fully confident he could successfully advance the next time he left Shadowed Star as long as he had enough Domain Stones to use!

What’s more, High Heaven Sect could launch long-distance voyages, so he firmly believed that Yang Kai would take them away from Shadowed Star again in the future!
