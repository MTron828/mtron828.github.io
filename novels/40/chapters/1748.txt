Chapter 1748, Luo Lan’s Visit

Next, Yang Kai asked about the Secret Arts and artifacts Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Miao used.

The three of them explained to Yang Kai in detail, without concealing anything.

Regarding Secret Arts, Yang Kai could not give them too many suggestions and could only allow them to explore slowly on their own, but when it came to artifacts, Yang Kai wasn’t stingy.

Yue Xi originally had two Origin Grade artifacts, but both were Low-Rank, and although they could boost her combat power slightly, the effect was extremely limited.

Yang Kai gave her his Feather Spirit Arrow and the Array Plate which had the Spectral Cloud Array sealed within it.

With the improvement of his strength, these two artifacts had become useless to him.

The Feather Spirit Arrow required one to pour their Saint Qi into it to fill it to a certain extent before releasing it all in one extremely potent attack. Unfortunately, the Saint Qi capacity only allowed it to be activated twice, after which it needed to be charged again.

With Yang Kai’s current methods, he did not need to use artifacts when confronting Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators, and when dealing with Origin Kings, the Feather Spirit Arrow could not provide him with much help.

As such, he figured he could give it to Yue Xi.

The same was true for the Spectral Cloud Array Plate. It had little use to Yang Kai.

However, if these two artifacts were used effectively by Yue Xi, their peculiar abilities could greatly enhance her strength. With these two artifacts, Yue Xi could still pose a threat to a Third-Order Origin Realm cultivator’s life despite her First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation.

Receiving these two artifacts, Yue Xi was unable to contain her joy.

Although she had Qin Wu Hui’s support in Sword Union and followed Gu Jian Xin, she could have never dreamed of receiving such treasures. Yang Kai’s wealth and generosity were simply shocking to her, in a pleasant way.

Yang Kai did not give any artifacts to the He Zao He Miao sisters because the two had just received a pair of Origin Grade Mid-Rank scimitars from Qin Wu Hui and were already busy adapting to their use.

When the two scimitars were combined into one, they formed a large, circular flying blade which was comparable to an Origin Grade High-Rank and possessed amazing lethality. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Having more artifacts wasn’t necessarily better.

Yang Kai handed two Origin Condensing Pills to He Zao and He Miao instead. In their current state, they only needed a bit more accumulation before they could attempt to break through to the Origin Realm.

In addition, Yang Kai gave the Master and Disciples a large number of Saint Crystals and pills they could use to cultivate before sending them to enter retreat.

Next, Yang Kai began arranging the Cross-Cultivation-Star Space Array in preparation to connect it to the transfer point he had built earlier.

Yang Kai deliberately chose the innermost palace as the location for the Space Array.

Refining all kinds of materials in a familiar way, engraving the Spirit Array, pouring his Space Force into it...

A few days later, a new Cross-Cultivation-Star Space Array had been formed.

The Space Spirit Crystals in his hand had all been used up to finish this last Space Array! In fact, the number of Space Spirit Crystals almost failed to meet the needs of this array, but fortunately, Yang Kai’s calculations had been correct and he managed to complete it successfully.

Releasing his Divine Sense, Yang Kai checked on Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao quickly, discovering that they were still in retreat. Nodding, Yang Kai then inserted enough Saint Crystals into the array and activated it.

In a flash, Yang Kai arrived on the Ore Star.

Among the underground ruins discovered by Yang Kai before, there was a brightly lit area with countless cultivators bustling about.

Yang Kai was surprised to discover that not only were there High Heaven Sect and Shadow Moon Hall disciples here, but also people from Clear Sky Sect and Coloured Glass Sect as well as many cultivators from Sects that had good relations with High Heaven Sect.

Evidently, Ye Xi Yun and the others had finished making preliminary arrangements here and had begun inviting cultivators from other Sects to come and mine this place.

“Sect Master Yang?” As Yang Kai was observing, a surprised call came not far away.

Yang Kai turned his head and discovered that the one who called out to him was none other than Mo Yu from Clear Sky Sect!

“Senior Mo,” Yang Kai said hello with a smile.

“It really is Sect Master Yang!” Mo Yu was overjoyed and quickly walked over, “I thought I had recognized the wrong person, but it turns out it really was you. Sect Master Yang, where did he come from?”

“Azure Tree Star!” Yang Kai replied casually.

“Sect Master Yang’s abilities are astounding!” Mo Yu said with admiration, “If it weren’t for you, my Shadowed Star’s cultivators would have remained trapped forever, but now we can quickly and easily travel to other Cultivation Stars. I’m afraid no one other than our Shadowed Star cultivator’s can enjoy such convenience.”

“Haha,” Yang Kai laughed without denying it.

It was true. Without the Space Array based on his comprehension of the Dao of Space, ultra-long-distance teleportation was not possible. There may be so few Cross-Cultivation-Star Space Arrays in the Star Field, but those were definitely relics leftover from ancient times and did not have the stability and safety of the ones Yang Kai personally arranged.

No one dared to use those ancient Space Arrays unless absolutely necessary.

“Did Sect Master Yang come here to look for Great Elder Ye?” Mo Yu asked again.

“En, where are Great Elder and the others?”

“Come, I’ll take you there,” Mo Yu quickly led the way.

Because of the rise of High Heaven Sect on Shadowed Star, countless Sects and families had begun forming closer ties with it. It was High Heaven Sect and Shadow Moon Hall who turned the tide of war when Corpse Spirit Religion was running rampant. This time, because Clear Sky Sect had a close relationship with High Heaven Sect, they were able to obtain an opportunity to come to the Ore Star to mine rare ores.

Mo Yu and Yang Kai shared a close friendship, so they chatted happily upon meeting once again.

Soon, Yang Kai saw Ye Xi Yun and Qian Tong, who were assuming command of the overall situation on the Ore Star.

After learning that he, Yang Kai, now owned a large territory on a Cultivation Star called Azure Tree Star and had connected it to the Space Array network, everyone was extremely excited.

This meant that the cultivators who had reached the limits of Shadowed Star now had a place where they could escape from the shackles of its World Principles and spy on the mysteries of the Origin King Realm.

Especially for Ye Xi Yun, she had been waiting for this day for a long, long time!

“When does Great Elder plan to leave?” Yang Kai looked at Ye Xi Yun and asked.

What surprised Yang Kai was that Ye Xi Yun shook her head and said, “I won’t be going there for now.”

Yang Kai went silent for a moment before quickly reacting, “Because of Yang Yan?”

“En!” Ye Xi Yun lightly smiled, “If I were to really break through to the Origin King Realm on Azure Tree Star, it would become difficult for me to stay on Shadowed Star for an extended period of time. Sect Master Qian’s circumstances are the best example. I think... only after she awakens, will I attend to my own affairs.”

“I see,” Yang Kai heard this and did not try to persuade her otherwise.

Ye Xi Yun had done much for Yang Yan. Last time, she had the opportunity to leave Shadowed Star with Yang Kai, but because Yang Yan was still slumbering, Ye Xi Yun chose to stay behind and stand guard. This time, she had made the same choice.

“Alright then,” Yang Kai smiled. “In any case, since it’s Great Elder, as long as the time is right, it shouldn’t be too difficult to break through to the Origin King Realm.”

“Sect Master thinks too highly of me,” Ye Xi Yun laughed lightly. “Throughout the ages, the Origin King Realm has always been the highest ambition of us cultivators. Countless Origin Returning Realm masters have been stuck at this juncture for their entire lives. It certainly won’t be that easy for me to reach that boundary.”

Yang Kai grinned meaningfully, knowing that Ye Xi Yun was simply being modest.

If the previous Ye Xi Yun did not have complete confidence, the current Ye Xi Yun who had refined several Domain Stones and comprehended the mysteries of Domain had at least an eighty percent chance of smoothly breaking through to Origin King Realm.

“In any case, I came back this time just to tell you the good news,” Yang Kai turned his head and looked around, “As for when you will go to Azure Tree Star, you can arrange that amongst yourselves.”

“Don’t worry about this. When the time comes, Great Elder Ye, Brother Mo, and I will definitely organize a group of people to travel to Azure Tree Star,” Qian Tong laughed heartily. “How could we not grab hold of such a wondrous opportunity? Even if we break through to the Origin King Realm, it does not matter if we can’t remain on Shadowed Star for a long time. With the Space Array available, we can come and go freely, so Shadowed Star shouldn’t have any accidents.”

“Alright, when you go there, someone will be waiting to welcome you,” Yang Kai nodded, “By the way, you’ve been mining here for some time now. Have you found a Space Spirit Crystal mineral lode?”

“No,” Qian Tong shook his head and said. “This old master, Great Elder Ye, and Brother Mo have gone out several times to search for mineral lodes, but although this Ore Star is extremely rich, we’ve yet to discover a Space Spirit Crystal lode.”

Yang Kai was not surprised about this and had just been asking casually about Space Spirit Crystals, so he wasn’t disappointed with the negative response.

Yang Kai did not remain on the Ore Star for very long, and after explaining a few things while also getting some updates on the situation, he used the Space Array to return to his palace on Azure Tree Star.

This trip only took him half a day, so when he returned, Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao were still in secluded retreat.

The rest of the day was spent without any surprises.

Zhu Liang brought the few Elders of Twin Shark Island to visit Yang Kai mainly to introduce themselves, but this was not surprising. Twin Shark Island was now Yang Kai’s territory and they would have to rely on him in the future, so how could they be negligent in such courtesies?

Yang Kai did not need to pay these few First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators much mind, simply entertaining them briefly before sending them away.

What Yang Kai was waiting for was word from Sword Union; he believed that, as a super force, they would surely be able to collect some Space Spirit Crystals for him. As long as he had enough Space Spirit Crystals, Yang Kai could set off again to arrange more Cross-Cultivation Star Space Arrays, eventually covering the entire Star Field, allowing Shadowed Star’s cultivator to travel wherever they wanted without worrying about the vast distances of the Star Field.

Tong Xuan Realm was especially important to Yang Kai!

He was eager to connect Shadowed Star to this homeland.

Unfortunately, there had been no news from Sword Union so far.

It was not until two months later that Yang Kai, who was cultivating, received a message from Yue Xi, “Someone from Sword Union is here.”

Yang Kai was very excited and got up quickly, going out to meet with this messenger as he secretly looked forward to how many Space Spirit Crystals he would be able to get this time.

He thought that Luo Lan would dispatch a subordinate of hers to complete this exchange, but Yang Kai was shocked to discover that Luo Lan had come herself!
