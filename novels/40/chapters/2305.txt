In the inner hall, Luo Jin held his new bride’s hand, and with a faint smile, turned around and walked towards the interior of the hall.

At this moment, a white-haired old man seated on the left of Yang Kai and the others suddenly stood up, smiled faintly while walking towards the couple, before coming to a stand in front of them.

The woodwind instruments, gongs and drums stopped playing, and the entire atmosphere turned solemn and serious.

With a faint smile, the old man said, “It is this old master’s great honour to be able to be a witness for our City Lord’s marriage.”

After a pause, he continued, “On this fine and beautiful day, the two of you will be wed in a blissful marriage. I hope that you two will love each other, and be harmonious for hundreds of years, with mutual respect for the marriage you two will form. Do you two agree?”

Luo Jin smiled, “This Luo agrees!”

The old man nodded, before turning to look at the new bride, “What about you?”

The faint tremble shook through the body of the new bride, before a beautiful voice rang out from beneath the phoenix coronet, “I...”

Right as her voice rang out, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly changed, while the feeling of unease present in the depths of his heart grew increasingly intense! He was absolutely certain that he had heard this voice somewhere before!

Before he could hear more of her voice in order to determine just who it was, a delicate shout suddenly rang out within the inner hall, “I object!”

The instant those words rang out, shock filled the entire hall.

Everyone proceeded to turn to look at where the voice originated from, secretly thinking about which utterly fearless person actually dared to embarrass the City Lord in front of the countless Masters present.

Rage flashed across Luo Jin’s face as he turned around and roared, “Who dares!”

His expression had turned so malevolent that it had warped and distorted his face. Today was the day of his marriage with his concubine, so it never occurred to him that someone would actually wreck the celebratory ceremony, causing him to be unable to control the thick murderous intent surging out from his heart.

His eyes radiated with a chilling glow as he shot a look at where that voice had originated from and snorted coldly, “What’s wrong? You have the guts to spoil this King’s good mood, yet have no guts to stand up and admit it?”

Some guests seated on the sides immediately shouted, “Obediently stand up and apologise to the City Lord! You might be able to keep your life if you do so! If you dare to remain stubborn, this day next year will be your death anniversary!”

Luo Jin added, “Today is an auspicious day for this King, so this King does not wish to take another’s life. If you stand up obediently, this King will not make things difficult for you!”

Right as those words rang out, a person suddenly stood up within the crowd.

This person was covered from head to toe in a black robe, causing people to be unable to see their real appearance. Nevertheless, from their figure, it was clearly a lady under those robes.

“Capture her!” Seeing the culprit stand up, Luo Jing waved his hand fiercely in response.

*Xiu xiu xiu...*

In an instant, a few of the City Lord’s Mansion’s guards rushed out towards that person.

The lady continued to stand there, appearing not one bit flustered at all. Right as the guards were about to capture her, she abruptly removed the black shawl above her head, revealing her face for all to see.

As this scene unfolded, everyone’s eyes suddenly snapped wide open as dumbstruck and tongue-tied expressions appeared on their faces.

“Huh?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“This...”

“Eldest Young Lady?”

Originally, those City Lord Mansion’s guards who were rushing over with raging auras radiating from their bodies, were all prepared to capture this girl and bring her to a secret location to give her a good taste of torture; however, right as they saw her true appearance, all of their expressions changed drastically as they dispelled their auras mid-air, causing them to drop down clumsily onto the ground, dumbstruck.

That was because they discovered that the person who had disrupted the marriage ceremony at such a critical moment wasn’t some stranger, but the City Lord’s Eldest Young Lady, Luo Bing!

Qiu Yu leapt out from his seat, a stunned look on his face as he looked over towards Luo Bing. He never expected that Luo Bing would actually be in this inner hall, moreover, disrupt the City Lord’s marriage ceremony.

Yesterday, when he and Luo Bing had gone their separate ways, she was doing just fine. Therefore, he was utterly incapable of understanding why Luo Bing would do something like this after just a single night by herself.

For a moment, deathly silence filled the entire inner hall, as everyone shot strange looks at Luo Bing, all them confused over what kind of disturbance she was planning on causing.

“Bing’er!” Luo Jin’s body shook as he stared at Luo Bing with his eyes wide open, “Why are you...”

Before he completed his question, he appeared to have suddenly discovered something and sharply asked, “Who has bullied you?”

He noticed that his precious daughter’s eyes were red and swollen, a clear indication that she had been crying for a very long period of time. Furthermore, her voice had turned hoarse, resulting in him not recognizing her voice earlier.

He instinctively assumed that Luo Bing had been bullied by someone.

Qiu Yu quietly gulped down his saliva, for fear of Luo Bing saying his name, as he believed that it was somehow his fault.

“No one bullied me.” Luo Bing pursed her lips before replying.

“Really?” Luo Jin’s eyes narrowed as he asked in a solemn voice.

“Really!” Luo Bing shook her head, remaining silent for a moment before continuing, “Father, this daughter has something to request of you.”

Luo Jin gave a sigh, “Let’s talk about this later. Go back to your room first and rest.” A wave of anger and frustration surged about in the depths of his heart, as he blamed Luo Bing for not recognizing the current situation and spoiling his authority and face before so many powerful people. At this moment, the only thought he had was to hurry up and get this ceremony over and done with, before having a good talk with Luo Bing about this matter.

Nevertheless, he didn’t expect Luo Bing to not listen obediently to his words. Shaking her head, she replied, “No, I need to make this request right now, if not it’ll be too late by then.”

“Bing’er!” A look of anger flashed across Luo Jin’s face as he growled out in a deep voice.

Luo Bing’s body instinctually shivered, frightened. Nevertheless, her eyes were filled with an extremely resolute gleam, as she continued to look back at a father with a pleading gaze.

Seeing her like that, Luo Jin immediately knew that he would definitely be unable to change her mind, leaving him no choice but to sigh, before letting out a laugh towards the surrounding guests, “I apologise to everyone. This King has spoiled his little daughter too much, resulting in this wilful behaviour. I hope that this won’t spoil everyone’s mood.”

Upon hearing his words, everyone could not help but to relax their facial expressions, as they had already known about how much the City Lord doted on Luo Bing. However, they didn’t know that it would be to the extent where she would actually dare to create such trouble during a major event like his wedding.

Everyone showed their acceptance, giving looks as though they cared greatly for Luo Jin’s face.

It was only then that Luo Jin looked towards Luo Bing, “Speak, what do you want from your father? To actually choose such a time to put forth your request... if it’s something outrageous, let see how I’ll deal with you when this is over!” Although he said those threatening words, a smile was present on his face. Clearly, he did not have any intent to threaten her, and this was just a show of love towards her.

Genial laughter rang out from the guests, as they praised the City Lord for his fatherly love.

Luo Bing bit her lip, before extending her finger to point towards Luo Jin’s side, “Your daughter begs of you to let her go!”

Right as her words rang out, the atmosphere within the inner hall, which had just regained a bit of its earlier festive air, sunk into a weird silence once again, as quite a few guests had their mouths hanging wide open, not daring to believe what they had just heard. Furthermore, the few people who immediately knew that the marriage ceremony might have encountered some difficulties instantly felt restless, as they quietly checked the expression on Luo Jin’s face.

In that instant, the smile on Luo Jin’s face turned stiff, before slowly fading away, being replaced by an expression so cold and gloomy it seemed as though a blizzard had arrived, before the smile within his eyes gradually turned into fury.

It took a while before Luo Jin finally spoke, “Go and take a rest, Bing’er! I think you’re too tired!”

Originally, he had assumed that his daughter had disagreed with his marriage in an attempt to coerce him to accept some difficult request that she wanted to make of him. He had thereby prepared himself sufficiently for this; however, what she wanted now was something that he had utterly not considered, as Luo Bing was completely in opposition to his marriage to his new concubine.

How could Luo Jin agree to that? No matter how much he spoiled Luo Bing, he would not just let his would-be bride go in front of everyone’s eyes! If he were to do that, how would he have the face to continue living on? What would happen to his reputation? If this were to happen, he might no longer be able to rule Sky Crane City and continue being the City Lord.

“Please promise me that, Father!” Luo Bing pleaded.

“Impudence!” Luo Jin roared before shooting a furious and regretful glare at Luo Bing, “It looks like I’ve spoiled you too much in the past, and let you get away with anything! Now scram off to your room! You’re not allowed to take a single step out of your room unless I give you the permission to do so!”

“Father...” Luo Bing started to cry, “It is not her choice to get married. How can you force people to do something like that! Just let her go, please...”

*Siii...*

Successive hisses from people sucking in mouthfuls of cold air rang out within the inner hall.

It was an open secret that not a single one of Luo Jin’s concubines had voluntarily chosen to get married to him, and everyone had kept that knowledge locked up in the recesses of their minds; no one was willing to bring it to light. However, it would be a totally different story if this information was revealed in the presence of everyone.

Yet, it was utterly unexpected that Luo Bing would be the one who revealed it!

Upon hearing what Luo Bing had said, all of the cultivators in the inner hall felt their hearts fiercely clench; it felt as if a massive storm was brewing, causing them to feel uneasy and restless.

“Just let her go. I’ll make sure to always stay by your side, be filial to you and listen to your words. I’ll no longer go and cause any more trouble, and I’ll definitely be on my best behavior,” Luo Bing continued to plead through her tears.

Luo Jin’s face continued to warp and distort, turning incomparably ashen before he roared out, “What nonsense are you talking about!?”

Luo Bing replied, “I’m not talking nonsense. I know who she is, and also know why she is being forced to marry you. Just let her go, please father...”

Luo Jin roared back in anger, “What the hell are you all looking at!? The Young Lady has clearly lost her mind! Hurry up and bring her away to get proper care!”

Hearing his command, the few City Lord Mansion’s guards, who hadn’t known what to do, started to take action and lunged towards Luo Bing.

However, right at that instant, a person who had been seated beside Luo Bing suddenly stood up, immediately proceeding to grab her throat, and shot a steely-eyed glare towards the people around him while giving a cold snort, “If anyone dares to approach, I’ll snap her neck!”

The faces of the few City Lord’s Mansion cultivators rushing over immediately turned pale with shock before they froze once again in a fluster.

The other guests who were here to celebrate the marriage ceremony had their eyeballs almost pop out of their sockets once again, as never in their wildest dreams did they expect such a series of shocking events to occur here today.

“It’s him!” A wrinkle appeared on Yang Kai’s forehead as he looked towards the one-eyed, sturdily built male who had grabbed onto Luo Bing’s throat, while a sliver of a pensive look flashed across his face.

He could recall bumping into this man in the restaurant yesterday. That fellow seemed to go by the name of Chai Hu, and it was precisely due to this man starting a conflict with a group of people that ended up in a fight, which had caused Yang Kai to leave the restaurant early.

However, he never expected that this fellow would actually intrude into this marriage ceremony, and even dared to seize the City Lord’s daughter by the neck in front of everyone!

Nevertheless... this person was only a Third-Order Origin King. Even though he had Luo Bing’s neck in his grasp, his fate appeared to be bleak.

After considering all of these details, Yang Kai shot another look at the new bride standing beside Luo Jin. Ever since seeing this new bride, he was being nagged by a strange feeling. Furthermore, right at this moment when he had looked over to her, he saw her tender body shake, as though she was struggling with something.
