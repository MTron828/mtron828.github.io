Inside Xue Yue’s Knowledge Sea, Yang Kai’s Soul Avatar sent out a subtle wave.

He began to create dream-like illusions and forced them into the seawater.

From her infancy to her current age, in these illusions, Xue Yue did not have to pretend to be someone else, did not have to show that unchanging spring breeze-like smile, did not have to live as a man.

She grew up carefree, with her father, mother, brothers, and sisters all living in harmony. She could wear the most beautiful clothes and the most beautiful jewellery, no longer needing to spend torturous days and nights cultivating and training.

In these illusions, she was the world’s happiest woman, she would take a few maidservants with her to stroll around the streets every day, occasionally revealing a radiant smile that made the blood of all the men in the city boil.

In these illusions, she would return home at the end of each day and tell her parents about the various things she encountered while they listened to her quietly with happy, smiling faces.

She even met a man who moved her heart but due to her shyness, she could only watch him from a distance, paying attention to his movements, unable to take the initiative to talk to him.

To her surprise though, this heroic-looking handsome man actually took notice of her too, defeated all his competitors, and fulfilled her father’s demanding requirements to win her hand in marriage.

They then became husband and wife and had children of their own. Although they didn’t live a lavish or magnificent life, both of them helped one another during times of difficulty and shared much joy together.

Their children slowly grew up, and they gradually grew old. Eventually, they passed on, finally being buried together in graves placed right beside one another, as if even in death they would never be separated.

In these illusions, Xue Yue lived a perfect life without any regrets.

Yang Kai repeated this process over and over again, submerging these illusions he constructed with his own Spiritual Energy into Xue Yue’s Knowledge Sea, disregarding his own consumption and fatigue.

Time passed by, but Xue Yue’s Knowledge Sea was still as stagnant as ever.

However, suddenly, the calm seawater began to roll and the numerous bubbles under the surface all burst, returning to nothingness.

The breeze blew and a light fragrance began wafting past the tip of Yang Kai’s nose.

Yang Kai stopped what he was doing, turned around, and saw Xue Yue standing behind him with a grin of interest on her face.

Yang Kai rolled his eyes and immediately withdrew from her Knowledge Sea.

The moment Yang Kai opened his eyes, Xue Yue also woke up, reached out, grabbing him and said, “Hey, why did you run away like some frightened thief?”

“Since you woke up, what else was I supposed to do? Wait for me to be tortured by you? If I were to stay there, a little Third-Order Saint like me wouldn’t be able to put up any kind of resistance,” Yang Kai snorted.

Everyone’s Knowledge Sea was their personal domain where they had absolute control; therefore, when two cultivators were of similar strength, they would never try to invade each other’s Knowledge Sea as the one who did would always be the one to suffer. Only when there was a vast disparity in strength would one possibly invading another’s Knowledge Sea to deal serious damage.

“Me, torture you? Why do you think I would torture you? If you didn’t do anything wrong, what reason would I have to torture you?” Xue Yue pressed the issue relentlessly, her eyes narrowing as a dangerous light filled them.

“Good, I admit that I broke into your Knowledge Sea without your permission and it was wrong of me to pry into your secrets, but you refused to wake up, so I had no other choice,” Yang Kai shook his sleeve to free himself from her grip. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“After prying into my secrets, you still want to argue about?” Xue Yue grit her teeth as she glowered towards Yang Kai menacingly.

“I didn’t see much...” Yang Kai said somewhat evasively.

Xue Yue didn’t speak, simply staring back at him fixedly.

“Fine, I even know how many hairs you have on your body, so what? What are you going to do, bite me?” Yang Kai said without the slightest trace of shame.

“You bastard!” Xue Yue immediately became angry out of shame, leaping off the bed and rushing over to Yang Kai, nipping his hand with her pearl white teeth once before shouting, “You think I won’t dare?”

Yang Kai didn’t try to avoid her and instead curled his lips into a grin, “If you’re not satisfied biting my hand you can always try somewhere else, interested?”

Xue Yue’s face and neck turned bright red as she quickly released Yang Kai’s hand and spat, “In your dreams!”

In that illusion, she had gained plenty of experience with the man she married and could now easily recall all those various postures and positions with ease.

She had received a thorough and systematic education ...

Naturally she understood what Yang Kai meant.

Although she also understood that it was just a fantasy created by Yang Kai for her, and none of it really happened, she still couldn’t help feeling extremely ashamed; after all, the woman in that fantasy was modelled after her, sharing her exact appearance.

It was as if she was really a harlot, constantly begging for more, completely insatiable!

“Were you always so obscene?” Xue Yue looked at Yang Kai strangely, seemingly not having through he was such a degenerate pervert, “Seems I’ve greatly misread you!”

“What’s obscene about the love between a man and a woman?” Yang Kai spat disdainfully, “When you really try it, you’ll realize the beauty of it.”

“Even so, you didn’t have to add yourself into that illusion did you?” Xue Yue smiled sweetly, as if she had suddenly discovered something interesting, “In those illusions, you were quite handsome and persistent. Are you hoping I’ll really marry you?”

“Nope, I wouldn’t be able to endure being with a woman like you,” Yang Kai quickly waved his hand.

“Get lost!” Xue Yue’s expression changed faster than one could turn the page of a book, trembling with anger as she kicking Yang Kai off the bed.

Yang Kai stood up, patted himself off indifferently and said, “Have a good rest. Once you restore yourself, I have something I need to tell you.”

The expression on Xue Yue’s face froze, apparently understanding what it was that Yang Kai wanted to talk about, closing her eyes in the next moment without saying a word.

Outside the room, Yang Kai saw Zong Ao leaning sideways, cupping his ears, listening intently. After seeing Yang Kai, Old Zong didn’t make any attempt to cover up his actions or apologize, simply asking, “Rescued?”

“En,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Impressive,” Zong Ao couldn’t help but give him a big thumbs up, “But what were you two doing inside, why was it so lively? Aren’t you her guard? Kid, this old master has to say, your courage is simply extraordinary, even daring to get involved with Xue Yue Third Young Master’s woman. En, you should run as soon as possible, this old master doesn’t wish to see you die so young, once that Xue Yue’s anger explodes, the whole Heng Luo Star Field will shake.”

Zong Ao may have spent too much time in seclusion, so despite being so old, his interest in gossip was as strong as any youth. He seemed to like seeing others flirting, and when he did see such scenes, it made him feel a few dozen years younger.

[Shameless!]

Yang Kai ignored him and instead walked out to find Ha Li Ka to inform him of the situation.

After hearing Xue Yue had awoken, Ha Li Ka was overjoyed and even gave Yang Kai a great big hug while sincerely expressing his gratitude.

Since Xue Yue had woken up, their last worries had disappeared, and now that Zong Ao had taken one step further on the Alchemy Way, as long as they could appropriately process the Profound Yin Sunflower Water, everything would be wonderful.

What’s more, since there was Xue Yue to handle the matter of the Profound Yin Sunflower Water, even if the Chamber of Commerce sanctioned them, they would only receive some slight punishment, nothing near as serious as what they had been worrying about before.

With all the good news flowing in, how could they not be joyful?

With the executives in a jubilant mood, the rest of the branch was also extremely happy.

One month passed by in the blink of an eye.

Xue Yue had been staying in her room ever since she woke up that day, claiming that his injuries still needed time to heal.

But the effects of the Profound Yin Sunflower Water had already been treated by the Burning Flame Pill, and there was no damage to her Soul, so what kind of healing could she still need? Although she had stayed in a coma for more than a year, with her cultivation, she only needed a day or two to restore herself.

The only reason was none other than she was avoiding Yang Kai!

Yang Kai understood this, but there was nothing he could do about it. Every time he went to find Xue Yue, he was stopped outside by several Saint King Realm cultivators serving as door guards. These people did not give Yang Kai any trouble, instead just smiling and saying that Lady Xue’er had ordered them to not allow anyone to enter her room without her permission. Their attitude was good, but their meaning of rejection was incredibly firm.

Yang Kai wished he could pound these guards flat.

Yang Kai was unhappy, and Old Zong wasn’t in much better of a mood.

Half of his Profound Yin Sunflower Water was taken away by Yang Kai, and several dozen of his large and small pill furnaces were snatched, causing Zong Ao to feel like his heart had been pierced, but he wasn’t shameless enough to go back on his word.

Zong Ao was still a trustworthy person. Since he dared to bet, he dared to lose, very much unlike Xue Yue who liked to dominate others with force.

Yang Kai also asked Zong Ao how to refine the Profound Yin Sunflower Water.

Zong Ao didn’t conceal anything and taught him all he knew.

Yang Kai realized after some explanations that although the Profound Yin Sunflower Water was a rare treasure. If it wasn’t properly handled, refining it would be fatal. Aside from needing a wide variety of auxiliary materials though, refining it also required an extremely hot environment!

Only when these preparations were completed and conditions were met could one start refining this treasure.

The auxiliary materials required were actually already in Yang Kai’s possession.

Back on the floating continent, he had harvested many Origin Grade and Origin King Grade herbs, each one of incredible value.

All he needed to do was find a suitable environment. According to Old Zong, it would be best if he used the magma chamber of some ancient volcano because only such a level of heat could suppress the chill of Profound Yin Sunflower Water.

However, Zong Ao also said that Yang Kai’s current strength was still too low, he would need to at least reach the Saint King Realm before attempting to refine the Profound Yin Sunflower Water, otherwise he would definitely lose his life.

Xue Yue’s refusal to meet him face to face continued to agitate and annoy Yang Kai.

The next day, when Yang Kai arrived outside Xue Yue’s room, the Saint King Realm guards would smile at him and say a few kind words, but still barred his path.

Seeing this familiar scene, Yang Kai’s face sank.
