Chapter 1673, Casually Spoken Words Become Prophetic

Not only did Fei Zhi Tu think so, the Shadow Moon Hall traitors who had aligned themselves with Corpse Spirit Religion also felt the same. One or two of them looked at Qian Tong with weird expressions, almost as if he was a naïve young man who didn’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth.

Fang Feng Qi even laughed loudly, “Old thing, stop shamelessly boasting! With such a big tone, do you think you are an Origin King?”

Qian Tong remained indifferent, not showing any intention to answer, instead just focusing his gaze on the Shadow Moon Hall rebels.

To the side, Wei Gu Chang looked excited and opened his mouth as if he was trying to say something, but held back in the end.

He wanted to announce loudly that Great Elder had really reached the Origin King Realm so he could see just how these traitors would react.

It would surely be a wonderful sight to see, right?

However, since Great Elder did not intend to answer, how could he jump in and spoil the surprise? After they saw Great Elder’s heaven-defying methods, they would understand just how foolish they were.

Above the high platform, Qian Tong said with a low tone, “I will give you thirty breaths of time to consider! After thirty breaths of time, this old master will decide for you!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Stop your foolish posturing, Great Elder!”

“Old Ghost Qian, are you making fun of us?”

“So what if you were the Great Elder in the past? Even ants will struggle against death, so how could we kill ourselves here with nothing but some empty threats from you?”

“That’s right! Qian Tong, if you dare take action here, don’t blame us for being impolite.”

The traitors all called out vigorously because Qian Tong’s calm and relaxed attitude irritated them greatly.

Did he really think he was an Origin King? Did he think a few glib words were enough to make them commit suicide?

None of them knew where he had been secluded these past few years, but now it seemed he had made a mistake in his cultivation and lost his mind.

Qian Tong simply closed his eyes and ignored the noise.

As for Xie Chen, who had lost all his limbs, it seemed he truly had gone insane from the physical and mental torture and was now just laughing wildly, his creepy voice piercing into everyone’s ears.

“Silence!” Fang Feng Qi snorted coldly and waved his hand through the air.

A sword-like attack slashed from the high platform and directly cut Xie Chen’s body in half.

“You’re all going to die... All of you will die!” After Xie Chen roared twice, his aura disappeared.

Fang Feng Qi just glared towards Xie Chen’s lifeless corpse and coldly snorted, “If you can’t accomplish your mission, at least don’t screw everything else up in the process!”

Among the Shadow Moon Hall traitors, Xie Chen wasn’t the strongest, but he was the shrewdest, which was why Fang Feng Qi had supported him as Hall Master and even granted him a special technique from the Religion Master which allowed him to improve his cultivation and break through to the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm in short order.

But Fang Feng Qi never expected Xie Chen to be so useless in the end. Not only had Xie Chen failed to kill the two Shadow Moon Hall Juniors and snatch the Heavenly Moon Silver Mirror according to the plan, but he had even gotten his limbs cut off and been dragged back like a dog.

There was no use keeping such a person alive.

At this moment, a brilliance flashed above the high platform again, and Yang Kai appeared together with Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang.

Seeing Fei Zhi Tu’s miserable appearance, Yang Kai’s heart clenched as he flew down quickly and grabbed the other party’s wrist, using his Saint Qi to carefully examine him.

“Yang Kai, you’re here too,” Fei Zhi Tu grinned, a warm and happy expression on his face.

[It seems I had not lived life in vain.] At the most critical moment, not only had Old Ghost Qian returned together with his two Juniors to rescue him, even Yang Kai had arrived. Fei Zhi Tu, a man of iron will, could not help his eyes from becoming a little moist at the scene before him.

When Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang appeared together in the sky, the entire world seemed to become brighter.

Almost every traitor from Shadow Moon Hall focused their eyes on the two women as they unconsciously voiced their admiration, expressing their amazement that such perfect women existed in this world.

Fang Feng Qi was even less restrained as his eyes wandered all over Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang, a strong possessiveness flashing across their depths, as if he was seeing some kind of delicious meal. Sticking out his tongue and licking his lips, even his breathing becoming quick.

“Senior Fei, your wounds...” After Yang Kai performed an initial investigation, he frowned and muttered.

Fei Zhi Tu’s complexion changed and he became somewhat nervous.

“En, it shouldn’t be a big problem,” Yang Kai smiled lightly. “It’s just your Saint Qi being sealed and some physical suffering.”

“Brat, don’t scare me like that!” Fei Zhi Tu snapped before exhaling a long breath and pondering for a moment, “Good, they still needed my body for something, so they didn’t destroy my foundation.”

“Just some minor injuries, nothing Senior Fei needs to worry about. Little Senior Sister, what pills do you have that are suited to treat him now?” Yang Kai looked back at Xia Ning Chang.

Xia Ning Chang swiftly took out a jade bottle from her Space Ring and handed it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai took it, opened the bottle, and poured out a dark red pill he handed to Fei Zhi Tu.

Fei Zhi Tu did not even glance at it before popping it into his mouth.

The next moment, however, his eyes bulged as he exclaimed, “This is...”

Without even finishing his thought, he immediately sat cross-legged on the high platform and circulated his Secret Art in order to dissolve the pill’s medicinal efficacies. Soon after, powerful energy fluctuations burst from Fei Zhi Tu’s body and his physical wounds began healing at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er looked at each other and were both secretly startled.

They could tell at a glance that the pill Xia Ning Chang just took out was definitely an Origin Grade pill, and most likely an Origin Grade High-Rank one at that. Only such a high grade pill would have such remarkable effects.

An Origin Grade High-Rank pill was a treasure Wei Gu Chang could not help being shocked at.

“Many thanks, sister-in-law!” Wei Gu Chang solemnly cupped his fists and thanked together with Dong Xuan’er.

Xia Ning Chang’s face blushed for a moment as she glanced towards Yang Kai and said quietly, “Senior Brother is too polite, Senior Fei is Junior Brother’s benefactor, so he is our benefactor as well. A trivial pill is nothing to worry about.”

“Brother Yang is truly blessed!” Wei Gu Chang winked at Yang Kai while feeling a little envious.

“Bring those two women here, they belong to this King!” Fang Feng Qi suddenly shouted.

Without even mentioning the beauty of Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang, just the pill Xia Ning Chang seemingly casually took out was enough for him to covet.

On Shadowed Star, Origin Grade High-Rank pills were all but impossible to come by.

As such, he could not wait to capture Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang. As long as he could get his hands on them, then everything in their Space Rings would belong to him too.

Yang Kai heard this and glanced over at him with icy eyes.

Fang Feng Qi’s heart jumped inexplicably, as if innately sensing that this young man could pose a life threat to his life.

“Thirty breaths are up!”

At that moment, Qian Tong suddenly opened his eyes and swept his gaze around coldly before declaring, “Since you are unwilling to commit suicide, this old master will send you to the afterlife personally!”

When these words came out, an astonishing might burst out, sending a ripple of force through the air that could not only be felt, but seen as well.

Domain!

The Domain of an Origin King!

The dozen or so traitors from Shadow Moon Hall were shocked and hurriedly pushed their Shi to resist, but like eggs smashing onto a rock, their Shi was shattered by Qian Tong’s Domain, instantly collapsing without playing any role at all.

In the blink of an eye, all the Origin Returning Realm traitors began leaking blood from their seven orifices, their faces pale and colourless.

The powerful Domain engulfed them tightly, as a violent wind began swirling about.

This wind was the unique attribute belonging to Qian Tong’s Domain!

As the wind condensed into sharp blades, it began slicing into the traitors.

From the screams that rang out, it was clear that the dozen Origin Returning Realm masters surrounded by Qian Tong’s Domain were suffering brutal torture, their bodies slowly being shaved away, turning them into bloody messes.

“An Origin King!” Everyone cried out in panic, with Fang Feng Qi’s eyes nearly popping out of their sockets as he stared towards the enraged Qian Tong, trembling in fear.

Originally, he was just making a joke; he never expected his casually spoken words to become prophetic, that Qian Tong was really an Origin King!

“Great Elder, spare me, I was wrong!”

“Great Elder, mercy!”

Just like the scene outside Heavenly Fate City before, when these traitors realized Qian Tong’s strength, they did not hesitate to beg for mercy. Throwing away all sense of shame, they knelt on the ground and kowtowed so hard their heads bled as they implored Qian Tong to spare them.

Qian Tong remained indifferent, with only a trace of sadness and disappointment flashing across his eyes.

Blood splashed and pieces of meat scattered as the Shadow Moon Hall traitors were shredded into a paste in just ten breaths of time, all of them suffering death by ten thousand cuts, their five organs, six viscera, even bones being ground down into dust.

“Good! Kill them!”

“Kill them all! Don’t let them run!”

“Justice for the women and children who died in Heavenly Fate City!”

“Send them all to their graves!”

The crowd of onlookers suddenly roared and swarmed up from all directions. Burning hatred appeared on all of their faces as their blood seemed to boil, their Qi surging up as they summoned their weapons and attacked towards the enemies which were still alive.

A three-hundred-meter radius around Fang Feng Qi’s location was instantly drowned in a dazzling explosion of light.

Even the glamorous young woman who was serving Fang Feng Qi before did not escape the angry mob’s fury. She was a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, but only managed to endure for three breaths before her Saint Qi protection was broken and she died tragically on the spot.

A stream of light soared into the sky in the next moment and cut a bloody path through the crowd before quickly fleeing.

Fang Feng Qi!

In the end, a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master was not so easy to kill.

Without looking back, he desperately pushed his strength, only wanting to escape. With Qian Tong suddenly becoming an Origin King, Fang Feng Qi remaining was equivalent to courting death. He had to bring this news to the four Protectors as well as the Religion Master.

Continuously checking, however, he sensed that Qian Tong wasn’t trying to pursue him, instead remaining where he was, motionless.

Although Fang Feng Qi could not tell whether the other party simply disdained to attack him or something else, Fang Feng Qi was still overjoyed thinking that he could escape.

Just as he was thinking so though, a flash appeared in front of him and his path was suddenly blocked by a young man.
