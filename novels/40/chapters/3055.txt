Chapter 3055, Presenting the Dragon Island Token

It was the worst kind of humiliation not only for Fu Chi, but also for the entire Dragon Clan. With his eyes beaming with ferocity, he glared at Yang Kai as though the latter was already a dead man.

Exasperated, he growled, “Where is this brat from? How dare he be so impudent!”

His wedding had been ruined, and the woman that was supposed to be his wife had now snuggled up to another man. Although Fu Chi considered himself a well-mannered man, he still couldn’t take it anymore. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Zhu Qing stared coldly at him and uttered, “Fu Chi, mind your language. He’s my man!”

“Your… Man…” Fu Chi widened his eyes and staggered, upon which he came to his senses and stared resentfully at Yang Kai, “So, it’s you!”

He was aware that Zhu Qing had gotten together with a Human after she left Dragon Island some time ago. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have had the chance to ask the Elders to marry Zhu Qing to him. His plan was that he would subdue Zhu Qing after the wedding and then leave Dragon Island to find that Human and dispose of him; however, he had never expected that this Human would come to Dragon Island and even be so impudent on his wedding day.

His expression had turned livid, while his eyes were burning with rage and hatred. He had already intended to kill Yang Kai, so he saw red when his love rival appeared right before his eyes.

“That’s right. I’m her man.” With a smile, Yang Kai pulled Zhu Qing into his embrace and planted a kiss on her forehead. He was acting willfully, as though they were the only people in the world.

Fu Chi’s expression grew gloomier when he saw that. His bride was kissed by another man in front of so many people. However, not only did she not attempt to resist, she appeared happy and shy. The fury in Fu Chi’s chest was about to explode like a volcano. Even the breath he let out was heavy and scorching hot.

On the other hand, Zhu Yan looked curiously at Yang Kai as he had just figured out his identity. Nevertheless, he appeared surprised at best, rather than angered or exasperated.

Although he didn’t agree to Zhu Qing and Fu Chi’s wedding, Zhu Qing had indeed made a grave mistake. Moreover, the Dragon Clan really needed more members to sustain their bloodline. Since the Second Elder wasn’t willing to relent, he wasn’t in a position to interfere. That was why he just let nature take its course.

He thought that decades or even centuries after Zhu Qing and Fu Chi got married, she would have forgotten about that Human. After that, he could come up with a plan to return her freedom; however, Zhu Yan never expected that this incident would happen on this day.

Suddenly, Fu Zhun shot a glare at Zhu Yan and glowered, “Did you already know about this?”

It was all but impossible to freely enter Dragon Island. More than ten years ago, they had enhanced the defences around the island. Even if a Great Emperor came over personally, the Dragon Clan would detect it immediately. If all the Dragon Clan members gathered, even a Great Emperor wouldn’t be able to force their way in. Therefore, Fu Zhun suspected that the reason Yang Kai could enter the island had something to do with the Great Elder.

Zhu Yan shook his head and replied, “How could I possibly know about this?”

With her doubt still unsolved, Fu Zhun snorted. [If this incident has nothing to do with him, how did this man enter Dragon Island without us knowing? Has the defence system we set up more than ten years ago lost its effects?]

Feeling uneasy, Fu Zhun couldn’t help frowning.

“This boy is pretty bold,” The Fourth Elder, Zhu Kong looked curiously at Yang Kai and put on a smile. “It’s no wonder Qing’er has fallen so deeply for him. I wonder if he’ll be lucky enough to survive this time though.”

If this matter wasn’t handled properly, Yang Kai and Zhu Qing were doomed to die; after all, the frozen-hearted Second Elder wouldn’t show any mercy towards them.

Upon hearing that, the Great Elder turned solemn.

“May I ask which one of you is the Second Elder?” Yang Kai turned around and looked in the Elders’ direction.

Despite his question, he was staring fixedly at Fu Zhun’s face. Of the three Elders, both the Great Elder and the Second Elder were Tenth-Order Dragons, so they were easily recognizable. This elderly man was obviously older than this cold-looking woman. His age suggested that he must be the Great Elder. That was why although it was Yang Kai’s first time seeing the Second Elder, he could recognize her at first glance.

At that instant, he cursed at the Second Elder in his heart. [There seems to be an eternally frozen ice sheet over her face. I wonder why she always puts on that cold expression?]

Not only was he not fond of the Second Elder, but Yang Kai was also resentful of her. [This woman basically has nothing better to do. Perhaps, she’s also suffering from some sort of mental disorder, which is why she insists on getting Zhu Qing married to Fu Chi.]

Despite his displeasure, Yang Kai didn’t want to fall out with them so soon. It would be wonderful if they could solve the problem peacefully. If they couldn’t, he would have no choice but to fight them. He was prepared to lose his life here. Even if he had to turn everything upside down, he had to leave with Zhu Qing today.

“Release her!” The Second Elder uttered coldly in an unquestionable manner without answering Yang Kai’s question.

With a calm expression, Yang Kai gazed at her, “Greetings, this Junior’s name is Yang Kai. I had no choice but to come here without any invitation, so I hope that you’ll forgive me.”

“I know who you are!” Fu Zhun stared coldly at him and replied dispassionately, “Release her if you want to live.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “Qing’er and I are deeply in love with each other. I’m sure you’re aware of this. I’m here to save her because she’s in a difficult situation. She isn’t my captive, so how am I supposed to release her? Aren’t you mistaken?”

“I said release her!” Second Elder growled as the temperature around her dropped by a few degrees. At that instant, the World Principles became a mess. Regardless of their cultivation realms, all 300 Human cultivators shuddered.

Hardly anyone in that place could endure Fu Zhun’s wrath, which was as terrifying as that of a Great Emperor’s anger. They looked at Yang Kai as though he was some kind of madman or freak. [The Dragon Clan’s Second Elder is already furious, yet he still dares to talk back? He must be courting death!]

Anger was rising within Yang Kai as his expression darkened. He wasn’t willing to fall out with the Dragon Clan directly, but it didn’t mean that he was afraid of them. Zhu Qing was part of the Dragon Clan, so if he was on bad terms with the Dragon Clan, it would put Zhu Qing in an awkward position, which was why he had been humble and sincere in his words. However, he didn’t expect that the Second Elder wouldn’t listen at all and instead just keep rebuking him.

After taking a deep breath to suppress his fury, Yang Kai tried once again, “Second Elder, please give Qing’er and me a chance to become husband and wife. We’ll be forever grateful to you.”

“Husband and wife?” Fu Zhun arched her eyebrows and spoke coldly, “Zhu Qing is getting married to Fu Chi today, so her husband is Fu Chi. What thing are you to spout nonsense here to damage our reputation?”

Zhu Qing immediately refuted, “Second Elder, you’re wrong. Yang Kai is my only husband. Whether or not the Dragon Clan will acknowledge or allow it, I’m his woman. Forever.”

“Impudence!” Fu Zhun snarled as her Dragon Pressure materialized and pressed down on Yang Kai and Zhu Qing.

Zhu Qing’s face turned ashen as she plunged into Yang Kai’s embrace. Her Dragon Vein had been sealed, and her cultivation had been suppressed, which was why she couldn’t bear the Second Elder’s wrath. If it weren’t because of her inherently strong physique, she would have lost her life upon impact.

Yang Kai also felt dizzy as his mind buzzed. At that instant, he was shocked as the pressure he felt was truly on par with that of a Great Emperor. Given his power now, he knew it would be difficult for him to deal with the Second Elder.

Zhu Qing’s resistance had completely infuriated Fu Zhun as she stared sternly at Yang Kai, “This is an auspicious day for the Dragon Clan, so I would prefer not to shed blood; however, since you’re so obstinate, don’t blame me for being ruthless.”

As she spoke, her murderous intent spread across the entire island and sent shivers down everyone’s spine.

Although the hundreds of cultivators were not directly targeted, they still found it difficult to breathe as though a huge mountain had been pressed against their chests, which caused them to almost cough up blood. They felt that they might lose their lives at any moment and were already suffering miserably. So, what about the main target, Yang Kai?

Naturally, he wasn’t in a better position. When he was engulfed in Fu Zhun’s murderous intent, he felt a clear and unprecedented sense of death. He felt cold all over her body, as though all his meridians had been frozen over.

On the side, Fu Chi watched Yang Kai suffer and felt gleeful in his heart. Earlier, he was already enraged by Yang Kai’s words, which were humiliating for him. If the Elders were not there, he would have made a move already. Nevertheless, he dared not be so presumptuous in front of the Elders. Now that the Second Elder was indignant though, he simply took pleasure in Yang Kai’s misfortune.

All inhabitants of Dragon Island understood the Second Elder’s temper very well. She was an unwavering person, so no one had the guts to disobey her. Yang Kai’s obstinacy would mean that he would end up in a miserable state. Then, Fu Chi thought of something and looked resentfully at Zhu Qing, who had nestled against Yang Kai. Upon seeing that sight, he decided that he must force himself upon her after the wedding.

[Unfortunately, her Primordial Yin has been taken away by that Human. A Dragon woman’s Primordial Yin is a powerful supplement for both Dragons and Humans. I’m an Eighth-Order Thunder Dragon. If I could have obtained Zhu Qing’s Primordial Yin, I might be able to achieve a breakthrough to the Ninth-Order. Sadly…]

Thinking so, Fu Chi felt frustrated as he shot a glare at Yang Kai.

“Wait one moment!” Yang Kai called out through clenched teeth as the veins on his forehead bobbed.

Unfazed, the Second Elder stared coldly at him and raised her fair hand. Principles swirled above her palm as the atmosphere around her turned glacial. She seemed determined to kill Yang Kai.

Yang Kai suddenly flipped his wrist, upon which a token appeared in his hand and he roared, “I have a Dragon Island Token with me!”

Fu Zhun was startled upon seeing that while the Great Elder, Zhu Yan, who had been silent the whole time, sized up the token in Yang Kai’s hand and nodded, “He is telling the truth. It’s a real Dragon Island Token.”

Zhu Kong uttered, “Oh? The last Dragon Island Token is with you. That’s interesting.”

It was the Dragon Clan who had created the Dragon Island Tokens, and there were only ten tokens in total. Over the past few years, the Dragon Clan had been trying hard to retrieve all these tokens, but they had only managed to retrieve nine so far. The whereabouts of the last token had remained a mystery up until today.

Previously, the main reason Zhu Qing left Dragon Island was to search for the last Dragon Island Token. Although she had figured out that the last token was in Yang Kai’s hands, she was unable to retrieve it. Then, due to a series of unexpected events, she had fallen in love with Yang Kai.

Now that Yang Kai had presented the Dragon Island Token to everyone, his intention was clear.
