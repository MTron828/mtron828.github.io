“Brother Yang!” Kang Si Ran walked into one of the best private rooms inside Violet Source Chamber of Commerce’s branch office, a ruddy complexion on his face as he warmly cupped his fists and gave his greetings.

Yang Kai stood up and returned the greeting, “Brother Kang!”

“Please have a seat. It’s not like we are strangers to each other.” Kang Si Ran motioned to Yang Kai before glancing behind him. A maidservant instantly appeared outside the door with a tray of high-quality tea. After closing the door, he asked, “Did you come here today to pick up your order?”

“That’s right. The two month period is almost up. How are your preparations going?”

Kang Si Ran smiled, “Doing business with Brother Yang is very profitable, so it’s only natural that President Lou did everything in his power to complete your request. The Space Spirit Crystals and the Space Spirit Jades have been prepared.” Saying so, he took out a Space Ring, placed it on the table, and pushed it to Yang Kai, “These materials are worth forty million High-Rank Source Crystals. Brother Yang, please feel free to inspect them.”

“No need.” Yang Kai shook his head. If he were doing business with anybody else, he might have inspected the wares to see if everything was in order; however, it was unnecessary since he was currently dealing with Kang Si Ran, who Yang Kai trusted would never deceive him.

In reality, transferring Space Spirit Crystals and Space Spirit Jades worth forty million High-Rank Source Crystals from the major branches of the Southern Territory within two months had required quite a bit of manoeuvring, consuming a large amount of labour and resources in the process. Although Lou Chi was doing his best, it ultimately required Kang Si Ran’s frequent efforts to speed up the process. In the end, they managed to gather everything with some excess, and the extras were given to Yang Kai free of charge under Kang Si Ran’s decision. Compared to this large-scale business, some small benefits weren’t worth mentioning at all.

“How much should I pay?” Yang Kai asked.

“You previously paid a deposit of ten million, and with the two Twelfth-Order Monster Cores being worth thirteen million, you only need to pay an additional seventeen million High-Rank Source Crystals,” Kang Si Ran reported the price, “On another note, President Lou said that it is fine even if you don’t pay us with Source Crystals; we will also accept Twelfth-Order Monster Cores.”

Yang Kai grinned, “President Lou is shrewd indeed. I think it’s best if I pay with Source Crystals.”

Although he had many Monster Cores on hand, he could not take them out carelessly. If too many Twelfth-Order Monster Cores entered the market, it would definitely affect the price. Needless to say, he was not the type to dig his own grave. Besides, he had enough High-Rank Source Crystals to pay off Hou Yu’s seventy million gambling debt, so what was seventeen million in comparison?

Soon, they concluded their business deal. Kang Si Ran then took out the documents, and they left their respective Soul Imprints onto the Soul Contracts to successfully complete the transaction.

Then, Yang Kai requested, “Please continue to purchase Space Spirit Crystals and Space Spirit Jades on my behalf. If I don’t come to you in time, please deliver them to the Azure Sun Temple for me.”

“Not a problem,” Kang Si Ran nodded, “On that note, congratulations on being promoted to the position of Azure Sun Temple Elder, Yang Kai.”

“I’m just a High-Rank Guest Elder,” Yang Kai shook his head.

Kang Si Ran sighed, “The chamber of commerce also received an invitation letter, but I was busy with acquiring the Space Spirit Crystals and Space Spirit Jades, so I couldn’t step away from my position and failed to congratulate you. I am very ashamed!”

“Brother Kang, don’t be such a stranger, it’s just a small matter,” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

Now that the transaction was completed, they chatted casually for a while.

Upon asking about Kang Si Ran’s current situation, Yang Kai learned that the former was doing very well in Maplewood City’s branch office. Kang Si Ran’s cultivation was just First-Order Dao Source Realm, so normally it would be impossible for him to take up the Manager position at this branch office. However, he was promoted to the position as a special case since he was very familiar with Maplewood City. Though, he had almost reached the end of his career as a Manager here prior to obtaining Yang Kai’s business deal. If not for this deal, it would not have been long before he was transferred away from the prosperous Maplewood City and dispatched to some remote place instead.

Fortunately for him, Yang Kai’s huge business was an important turning point for Kang Si Ran.

The deal made Lou Chi highly regard Yang Kai, as who else would be generous enough to put down forty million in a single transaction? Not to mention that Yang Kai also promised to bring two Monster Cores from Twelfth-Order Monster Beasts to Violet Source Chamber of Commerce every six months. That was a long-term business deal, one valuable enough to make Kang Si Ran irreplaceable as the Manager here. After all, Yang Kai only made this agreement with the Violet Source Chamber of Commerce out of respect for Kang Si Ran.

Furthermore, Lou Chi was said to have the greatest expectations of Kang Si Ran among the current Managers and had been appointing him to handle many important customers, especially after the Manager named Gu Hong suddenly left Maplewood City. Kang Si Ran had subsequently taken over all of the clients under Gu Hong’s jurisdiction and was now considered the Head Manager of this Violet Source Chamber of Commerce branch office.

“Gu Hong left Maplewood City?” Yang Kai was surprised. [No wonder I didn’t see him around during my trip here this time.]

“En, after you came here, Brother Yang, he took the initiative and requested to be transferred away from Maplewood City. Since President Lou had no reason to refuse this request, he immediately approved the transfer with a wave of his hand.” Kang Si Ran smiled from ear to ear. He had a fierce rivalry going on with Gu Hong and originally had no hope to win, but to his surprise, he had the last laugh in the end while Gu Hong, who used to have the upper hand, had to leave instead.

“He probably felt that he couldn’t continue working here. This is all thanks to you, Brother Yang,” Kang Si Ran repeatedly thanked Yang Kai, believing all the credit belonged to the latter.

Listening to those words, Yang Kai vaguely felt as if he finally understood something and asked, “How was Gu Hong’s condition when he left?”

Kang Si Ran did not know the reason for this question, but even so, he considered for a moment before replying, “He looked panicked. Hmm… He also looked very uneasy, as if a huge catastrophe was about to befall him.”

“That bastard!” Yang Kai slapped his thigh and snorted coldly.

“What happened?” Kang Si Ran was startled.

Yang Kai sneered, “I know why he suddenly asked to transfer out of Maplewood City… He was afraid I might come looking for revenge against him.”

Kang Si Ran suspiciously asked, “Did Gu Hong offend you in some way, Brother Yang?”

Yang Kai replied, “In your chamber of commerce, what kind of offence does the selling of customer information constitute?”

Shocked by those words, Kang Si Ran solemnly replied, “It’s considered one of the highest offences. If the claim is verified, the criminal will be executed immediately! Why do you ask, Brother Yang?”

Yang Kai explained, “After attending the auction in Maplewood City, I was stopped by the Sect Master of Broken Mountain Sect, Le Dong Zheng, when I went out of the city. At the time, I was wondering how that guy tracked me down. Moreover, he managed to intercept my path so quickly and precisely. Now, I understand; somebody was manipulating things from behind the scenes!”

“What?! Le Dong Zheng died at your hands, Brother Yang?” Kang Si Ran was shocked. He had heard the news about Le Dong Zheng’s death; after all, Le Dong Zheng had been a Sect Master and a major customer of Violet Source Chamber of Commerce, so it was only natural for Kang Si Ran to pay attention to such news, especially after he took over all of Gu Hong’s clients.

Le Dong Zheng was originally one of Gu Hong’s best clients, so when Kang Si Ran took over Gu Hong’s portfolio, he had specially visited Broken Mountain Sect to give his greetings. To his surprise though, Kang Si Ran learned that Le Dong Zheng had passed away when he arrived. Following Le Dong Zheng’s death, Broken Mountain Sect fell apart and its thousands of disciples scattered.

After asking around, Kang Si Ran learned that Le Dong Zheng had died soon after the auction. Not many knew about this though, and no one knew just who murdered Le Dong Zheng either. It wasn’t until this moment that Kang Si Ran realized it was Yang Kai’s doing. Although his cultivation was not high, he was a Manager of Violet Source Chamber of Commerce, so Kang Si Ran was naturally very quick-witted. Thus, he managed to guess the truth of the matter just by making some inferences from Yang Kai’s words.

It was obvious that Gu Hong had leaked the information about Yang Kai to Le Dong Zheng after the auction. Then, Le Dong Zheng tried to ambush Yang Kai. Unfortunately, his skills were inferior to Yang Kai’s and the hunter ended up becoming the hunted instead.

The grudge between Yang Kai and Le Dong Zheng was no secret to Kang Si Ran, while on the other hand, the reason Gu Hong turned against Yang Kai was even simpler. As he and Kang Si Ran were competing for the Manager position, Gu Hong became jealous and angry upon seeing Kang Si Ran’s position stabilizing because of Yang Kai.

Pondering over it, Kang Si Ran’s expression became grim, “This matter is of great importance. Brother Yang, please wait for a moment. I will report this to President Lou immediately.”

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai said, “Forget it. Since Le Dong Zheng is dead and Gu Hong has also taken the initiative to transfer, let’s drop this matter. There is no need to trouble President Lou.”

Gu Hong was nothing but an ant to him, so there was no need to blow this matter out of proportion.

Kang Si Ran, however, shook his head and responded solemnly, “Brother Yang, you might not know this, but the chamber of commerce places great importance on its reputation; after all, reputation is vital in the business world. Gu Hong’s actions, leaking a customer’s private information for his personal gain, will absolutely not be tolerated by the chamber of commerce. If we let him go this time, he might cause greater trouble in the future.”

When Kang Si Ran brought up the Chamber of Commerce’s reputation, Yang Kai could hardly refuse anymore, “However, I don’t have any real evidence…”

Kang Si Ran shook his head again, “No proof is needed. This matter couldn’t be more obvious; I believe President Lou will be able to tell as well.” After saying that, he walked out of the room.

It was clear that he was not trying to take the opportunity to exact his personal vendetta against Gu Hong. Although he and Gu Hong had been stuck in a rather unpleasant rivalry, Kang Si Ran was not such a petty and small-minded person. What he was doing was simply for the sake of the Violet Source Chamber of Commerce. As the saying went, ‘a single mouse dropping could ruin the entire pot of porridge’.

A short while later, Kang Si Ran returned. He said nothing regarding Gu Hong’s fate or how Lou Chi planned to punish Gu Hong, he simply apologized to Yang Kai on Lou Chi’s behalf. Similarly, Yang Kai did not ask about it either. Moreover, Kang Si Ran informed Yang Kai that he would receive a ten percent discount whenever he purchased anything from the chamber of commerce in the future. That was, without a doubt, hush money from Lou Chi.

As Gu Hong’s actions tarnished Violet Source Chamber of Commerce’s face, word about it could not be spread outside. Besides, the ten percent discount was a very generous offer as hush money, in particular since the business between Yang Kai and Violet Source Chamber of Commerce was on an extremely large scale.

After chatting idly for a while longer, Yang Kai said his goodbyes and left. He went directly to Spirit Lake City. Along the way, he took out the Jade Elder Token and sent a message to Xia Sheng. Thus, Xia Sheng was already standing there with a smile by the time Yang Kai arrived, waving his hand enthusiastically upon spotting him.

When Yang Kai walked over, Xia Sheng threw his arm around Yang Kai’s shoulder with a smile, “Junior Brother Yang, congratulations on becoming an Elder of the temple!

Yang Kai replied, “Please don’t tease me, Senior Brother.”

“I’m not teasing you! It’s a happy event for both you and the temple,” Xia Sheng patted Yang Kai on the shoulder and whispered, “More importantly, I heard that you have already experienced two of the temple’s Three Great Taboos.”

All was fine before this topic was mentioned, but the moment Xia Sheng brought it up, Yang Kai couldn’t help recalling Gao Xue Ting’s heroic posture from when they were drinking that day and in response, his face visibly twitched.

Xia Sheng laughed loudly, “Don’t mind it, don’t mind it.”
