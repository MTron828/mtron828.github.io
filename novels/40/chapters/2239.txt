After more than ten thousand years, their names had already been lost to history. The people living and working peacefully in this world had no idea that such a thrilling battle once took place all those years ago.

Only a single old man guarded their uncrowned graves silently. Only these graves recorded the great achievements that they had made, and only here would their dedication to this world be recalled.

“I trust that you are able to envision the results of that battle.” A look of sadness emerged on Tian Yan’s face as he pointed to the graves.

Yang Kai stood in awe and bowed deeply to the graves. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Standing up straight, he then asked, “Then what about the Soul Devouring Insects? Were they able to be killed?”

Tian Yan shook his head slowly and said gloomily, “It is a shame, but though we had to pay such a great price, those Soul Devouring Insects... really could not be exterminated by the beings of this world.”

Yang Kai’s face changed greatly and he said, shocked, “Senior means that... those Soul Devouring Insects are still alive?”

Tian Yan nodded.

“How can that be?” Yang Kai suddenly felt sad. So many Masters here died in order to exterminate those Soul Devouring Insects, paying the ultimate price in the process, yet they were still unsuccessful in the end. Did that mean that even that sacrifice was not enough?

Thinking about that, Yang Kai was horrified and asked, “Then, where are the Soul Devouring Insects now?”

“Come with me!” As he spoke, the old man wrapped his power around Yang Kai again, and in a flash, they arrived in front of a dark altar. He waved his hand to disperse the fog here to reveal the altar and pointed to it with a sad look on his face, “The insects that plagued this world back then are all sealed here!”

There was no need for him to say this as Yang Kai could already tell.

Because when he first appeared here, the Soul Devouring Insects laying in his Soul Warming Lotus had already begun squirming uncontrollably, as if they wanted to break free from Yang Kai and fly out from his body.

At the same time, a buzzing sound came from the altar, forming a strange resonance with the Soul Devouring Insects in the Soul Warming Lotus.

Yang Kai’s face changed.

“You really do possess Soul Devouring Insects,” The old man looked at him with a complicated gaze. “It is also because of the commotion that this old master became aware of it. That is the reason I searched for you in Heavenly Monster Mountain, yet this old master did not expect that when he rushed there, you were already gone. However... this old master has been guarding this place for over ten thousand years and cannot be more familiar with the aura of the Soul Devouring Insects. When I felt their unique aura in the Heavenly Monster Mountain and asked the Monster King for answers, I swiftly pursued you to Divine Ascension City.”

“Rest assured, Senior. These Soul Devouring Insects of mine are not powerful and will not cause any harm to this world. And... I will definitely take them away when I leave,” Yang Kai hurriedly said.

Yang Kai thought that Tian Yan brought him here because he wanted him to leave the Soul Devouring Insects here, and that was why he hurried to explain.

“Little Friend Yang, you misunderstand me,” Tian Yan slowly shook his head. “This old master does not want your Soul Devouring Insects. This world was nearly destroyed because of them, how could this old master want to leave more of these behind? I brought you here to ask you a favour.”

“What favour?” Yang Kai was confused.

“This old master hopes that you can... take them away as well!” As he said that, Tian Yan pointed at the dark altar.

The corners of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched and he said dryly, “Senior must be joking, these Soul Devouring Insects of mine are still quite weak, and given that I have had them for a long time, this Junior can still control them somewhat, but the Soul Devouring Insects that are sealed here... are beyond Junior’s control.”

The Soul Devouring Insects sealed here had even devoured several dozen Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters, how could Yang Kai dare to touch them? If he really put them into the Soul Warming Lotus, he would be dead without a burial in no time.

“They are not as strong today as they used to be,” Tian Yan said. “They have been sealed for ten thousand years without receiving any nourishment, so they have become quite weak. Little Friend Yang, since you are able to control your Soul Devouring Insects, then can’t you control these as well?”

Yang Kai laughed bitterly, “You evaluate me too highly, Senior... I could still control my Soul Devouring Insects in the beginning, but less than twenty days after entering this place, my insects have already begun to disobey my orders. After I leave this place, I will still have to find a way to...”

When he spoke up to this point, Yang Kai suddenly paused and fell deep into thought.

Seeing him like this, Tian Yan also could not help but be shaken and looked at him expectantly.

He had been guarding this place for ten thousand years, never once leaving Misty Valley, both to guard the graves of his departed friends as well as the Soul Devouring Insects.

But the Soul Devouring Insects have always remained a hidden danger to this world. If they could be sent out of here and dealt with once and for all, that would be something Tian Yan hoped for earnestly.

So, when he noticed the Soul Devouring Insects in the altar awakening, he immediately searched for the reason and found Yang Kai, thus bringing up this request.

After a long time, Yang Kai looked up with a glimmer in his eyes and asked, “May I ask Senior how powerful the Soul Devouring Insects sealed in here are today?”

Hearing this, Tian Yan answered cautiously. “According to this Old Master’s estimation, they are a little stronger than your Soul Devouring Insects, but not that much stronger.”

“Only that?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up when he heard this, “If that’s the case, then maybe there is still a chance.”

“What do you mean by that?” Tian Yan asked, puzzled.

Yang Kai told him with a serious face, “Senior must also know that the world outside is very different from here. Even though the Soul Devouring Insects are completely lawless here, there are many ways to restrict them in the outside world. Junior has a treasure with him that is the bane of all sorts of Exotic Insects, such as these...”

“Such a thing exists?” Tian Yan was shaken.

“En,” Yang Kai nodded, “Junior had originally planned to use that treasure to subdue my Soul Devouring Insects after leaving here so that they will be obedient to my orders in the future. If the Soul Devouring Insects sealed here are not too strong, then it may not be impossible for Junior to subdue them as well.”

The treasure he mentioned was naturally the Insect Enslavement Bracelet left behind by the Insect Emperor.

This thing had a significant suppressive effect on Exotic Insects, so the Soul Devouring Insects would definitely be unable to resist its power. Of course, that is only provided that the insects themselves were not too strong. If they were strong enough to the point where they could even devour an Emperor Realm Master, then Yang Kai wouldn’t dare to be reckless either.

But after receiving Tian Yan’s answer, Yang Kai suddenly became somewhat eager to try.

“With the help of this treasure, we can indeed make an attempt,” Tian Yan had a cheerful expression. “This old master just wonders how sure Little Friend Yang is about this? It was merely an attempt for this old master to bring you here and bring you this request. If it is too dangerous, then let it be. It is no big deal for this old master to guard this place for another ten thousand years.”

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Junior is quite sure that this can work, but Junior will still need Senior’s help for this.”

Tian Yan said, “If there is anything you need, just tell me.”

Yang Kai said, “My own Soul Devouring Insects are fine. They are acting a bit unruly now, but they will bring no harm to me in the immediate future; however, if I am to take these Soul Devouring Insects here with me, then they will have to enter my Soul Avatar. Junior would like to ask Senior to please seal them a little in case Junior can’t suppress them.”

That was exactly the thing that worried him.

To take the Soul Devouring Insects away, he first had to take them inside him.

How could Yang Kai defend against them if they were to get riled up? What’s more, he still had to refine the Insect Enslavement Bracelet after he got out and could not be disturbed too much. If he wound up constantly struggling to suppress the new Soul Devouring Insects, then he wouldn’t be able to refine that Emperor Artifact at all.

But unexpectedly, Tian Yan suddenly showed a difficult expression when Yang Kai made that request.

Yang Kai asked, curious, “Is this matter difficult for Senior?”

Tian Yan looked at him and nodded lightly.

Yang Kai was surprised, “How come? Based on what Senior said, these Soul Devouring Insects have already become incredibly weak, and your cultivation is so strong...”

“With this old master’s strength, it is easy to deter them for a while, but... this Old Master can’t leave this world with you. Without following you, this old master will definitely not be able to restrict these Soul Devouring Insects.”

Yang Kai’s eyes went wide and he looked at Tian Yan in astonishment. He pointed to the altar and said, “But Senior, how did you seal them back then?”

The Soul Devouring Insects back then had to be ten thousand times more powerful than now, so if they could be sealed back then, why couldn’t they be sealed now?

Yang Kai couldn’t understand it.

Tian Yan said, “It is embarrassing to admit, but this seal is not the work of this old master.”

Yang Kai raised his brows and said in surprise, “You mean to say... it was a combination of the efforts of all the people at that time?”

“You could say so.” Tian Yan nodded lightly, “But there was another force included, otherwise, how could this seal have lasted for such a long time?”

“What force?” Yang Kai asked.

Tian Yan did not say anything but instead reached up and pointed towards the sky.

Yang Kai was confused at first, but then when he realized what he meant, he was shocked. “The Will of the World!? The Mirror Soul helped?”

Tian Yan said, “This world has its own will and its own laws. The Soul Devouring Insects brought great harm to this world and killed its inhabitants, which was intolerable to the World, so it used its own Principles to aid us, allowing us to seal the Soul Devouring Insects! After all, no matter how powerful we were, we were just food for the Soul Devouring Insects. Only with the help of the World itself, creating a layer of protection around us were we able to stop the Soul Devouring Insects from devouring us too.”

When he explained it this way, Yang Kai immediately understood.

This seal was probably divided into two layers. The first layer was the Mirror Soul’s will, which is also the Will of the World. The other was the combined power of many Masters. With the two powers combined, they were able to seal the Soul Devouring Insects for ten thousand years, and replicating such a feat would be impossible if either one was missing.

“Senior, could you help this Junior to communicate with the Will of this World?” Yang Kai asked with sparkling eyes.

Because he suddenly thought of Grandma You’s plan at this moment.

The greatest reason that she wanted to snatch away his Soul Warming Lotus was so she could use it as a carrier to hold the Mirror Soul and refine this world.

If Yang Kai could communicate with the Mirror Soul, then he may be able to achieve that.

Once he succeeded, he would become the master of the Divine Ascension Mirror and would be able to enter it and train his Soul at any time in the future.
