In Void Land’s Wood Spirit Province, where there were endless mountain ranges with jagged rocks covered in lush forests. On a certain Spirit Peak, Yang Kai was sitting cross-legged and staring at another Spirit Peak 100 kilometers away.

He had been sitting here for more than two months now.

With these two Spirit Peaks as the center, a radius of several hundred kilometers had been marked as a Restricted Area and no unauthorized personnel were allowed to approach.

A streak of light flew over and landed beside Yang Kai as a sweet fragrance spread in the air. It was none other than Yue He.

As their eyes met, Yang Kai nodded slightly. Yue He, standing quietly beside him, asked in a low voice, gazing into the distance, “Young Master, how is the situation?”

“For the time being, there shouldn’t be any big issues. We just need to see when Senior Iron Blood will be able to completely refine the Yang Element material. As long as he completely refines it, he will be able to split Heaven and Earth apart and form his Small Universe.”

After a short pause, he asked again, “Has everything been arranged?”

Yue He replied, “Everything has been arranged. Second Manager is bringing them over right now.”

Yang Kai nodded.

Two months ago, Iron Blood Great Emperor had received his Sixth-Order Yang Element material and was preparing to break through to the Open Heaven Realm. Yang Kai had also made many preparations for this and had specially found many Open Heaven Realm Masters to teach him about the things he needed to pay attention to in order to break through smoothly. This kind of experience was exactly what Iron Blood Great Emperor needed. With this guidance, he would be able to avoid many risks.

It had been almost two months since Iron Blood Great Emperor began refining his final Element material, so it should be about time for the results to be revealed.

He was the first cultivator from the Star Boundary to ascend to the Open Heaven Realm. This was extremely significant to the current Void Land and the people from the Star Boundary as a whole.

Therefore, Yang Kai arranged for some people to attend the ceremony! These people were all preparing to break through to the Sixth-Order, so being able to personally observe and emulate Iron Blood Great Emperor’s breakthrough would be of great benefit to them in the future.

When Old Bai was breaking through to the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm, the Proprietress had specially brought Yang Kai to watch for precisely this reason.

As the two were speaking, they saw a large group of people flying towards them. When they got close, all of them landed on the ground. There were more than twenty of them.

The ones in front were naturally the Great Emperors from the Star Boundary, Hong Chen, Martial Beast, Serene Soul, Flower Shadow, Ice Feather, Heavens Revelations, and Wondrous Pill.

Next were Yang Yan, Li Wu Yi, Bing Yun, Sheng Yu Zhu, and the other Pseudo-Great Emperors.

After them were Yang Kai’s wives, Su Yan, Xia Ning Chang, Shan Qing Luo, Xue Yue, Yu Ru Meng, and Ji Yao.

Yang Xue, Mo Xiao Qi, Lin Yun’er, Xiang Ying, and Fang Yue also came.

Everyone greeted him one by one, but there was no time for small talk as everyone’s eyes turned towards Iron Blood Great Emperor.

After observing for a while, Duan Hong Chen furrowed his brow and asked, “What’s the situation over there?”

Yang Kai replied honestly, “He should still be refining the last material, but it should be about time. We’ll know in half a month at most.”

Duan Hong Chen nodded slightly and suddenly smiled, “I didn’t expect that we would also be able to break through to the Open Heaven Realm.”

They were trapped in the Star Boundary and unable to see the vastness of the Outer Universe. Only by leaping out from there did they realize how small the world they lived in truly was. However, everyone understood that the greatest contributor to everyone’s success today was undoubtedly Yang Kai. If he hadn’t provided them with an unlimited amount of cultivation materials, even if they had jumped out to the Outer Universe, they might not have had a good result.

Since their arrival from the Star Boundary, the Great Emperors rarely gathered together as they were usually busy with their own cultivation. If Yang Kai hadn’t asked them to attend this event, they would still be in retreat.

Now that they had gathered together, there was naturally a lot to talk about, so it didn’t take long for them to start chatting.

Yang Kai didn’t pay any attention to them and instead shot a glance at his Wives before walking to the side. Seeing this, the several women quickly followed.

Although Yang Kai would often find time to guide Su Yan and the others in their cultivation, most of the time, they would be in retreat so they rarely saw each other. As such, it was only natural for them to feel a little lovesick.

There were many people gathered here, and since it was inappropriate to show too much affection in public, Yang Kai simply checked the cultivation progress of each of the women one by one, answering all of their questions in detail, allowing them to benefit greatly.

Three days later, Yang Kai, who was talking to his women, suddenly turned his head in the direction of Iron Blood Great Emperor and shouted, “It’s starting!”

The muttering on the Spirit Peak suddenly quieted down as everyone turned their attention to the platform where Iron Blood Great Emperor was sitting cross-legged. Bit by bit, an extremely profound aura suddenly started rising.

“Is the arrangement over at the Star City done?” Yang Kai turned his head and asked.

Yue He quickly replied, “Everything has been arranged. Mo Mei will personally keep an eye on it, there won’t be any mistakes.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Start the Array!”

Yue He accepted the order and summoned the Array Jade. Immediately, her hands danced around as the Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array was activated.

The Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array that enveloped Void Land was extremely powerful, but the more powerful the Spirit Array, the more energy it consumed to operate.

Normally, the Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array was not fully activated, especially now that Void Land was lacking in resources.

At this moment, under the control of Yue He, the Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array’s Bewildering Array, Illusion Array, and barrier were all activated.

When Iron Blood Great Emperor broke through to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, there would inevitably be a great disturbance. If there was no Grand Array to isolate him, it was highly likely his breakthrough would be spied upon by outsiders. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Heavenly Sword Union was like a tiger eyeing its prey right now. It was unknown how many spies they had planted in Void Territory and the Star City, but once news of someone breaking through to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm spread, they would naturally hear about it.

Yang Kai didn’t know what Zuo Quan Hui’s reaction would be, but just in case, he had to be careful; Void Land still needed more time.

In the blink of an eye, the entire Void Land was covered in a thick layer of mist. Looking from afar, it was impossible to see anything within.

Inside Void Land, the movements of Iron Blood Great Emperor became more obvious, and a series of muffled thuds slowly and rhythmically rang out from the void, as if a giant invisible hand was beating a war drum.

Everyone focused all of their attention on him, not missing a single detail.

Watching others advance to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm was extremely helpful to their future cultivation, so no one dared to relax.

Advancing to the Open Heaven Realm was a process of a cultivator splitting Heaven and Earth apart within their body to form a Small Universe. This process was extremely dangerous, because in order to break through to the Open Heaven Realm, one needed to first shatter their Dao Seal and melt it into their Small Universe. If the Dao Seal was shattered and the Small Universe was unable to form, then their entire life of cultivation would be wasted.

If one succeeded, they would be reborn and soar into the sky. If they failed, they would lose everything and would die without a corpse. There were only two endings when breaking through to the Open Heaven Realm. One was to live, the other to die. There was no middle-ground.

As such, there were many Emperor Realm cultivators in these 3,000 Worlds who already had the qualifications to break through to the Open Heaven Realm, but did not dare to take that final step.

The Great Emperors all wore solemn expressions.

Compared to Iron Blood, their foundation was almost the same. Perhaps Iron Blood was slightly better, but not by much. Whether or not Iron Blood could successfully advance to the Sixth-Order was the key. If he failed, it would be a great blow to the Great Emperors from the Star Boundary.

If even the Great Emperors were like this, there was no need to mention the others.

As such, everyone present was nervous.

Seeing this, Yang Kai consoled, “Senior Iron Blood has a deep foundation and his Dao Seal is firm. Now that he has the protection of the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to break through to the Open Heaven Realm. There’s no need to be so nervous.”

Mo Huang shook his head and commented, “Who dares to say that nothing unexpected will happen on our path of cultivation? Even if someone had traveled 99% along the path, before he or she had reached his or her destination the slightest carelessness may lead to unpredictable consequences.”

Yang Kai had wanted them to not be so nervous, but after hearing Mo Huang’s words, he could only nod and say, “Senior Martial Beast is right.”

As time passed, the Yin, Yang, and Five Element Powers gradually rose and fell, mutually reinforcing and suppressing one another. On the Spirit Peak, the atmosphere was heavy as everyone knew that Iron Blood had reached a critical juncture, so how could they be in the mood to speak?

Yin, Yang, and the Five Elements continued cycling without end, occasionally showing signs of disorder, causing everyone to be on edge. Fortunately, Iron Blood Great Emperor’s foundation was quite deep, so although there were some twists and turns during his advancement, it wasn’t to the point where he couldn’t control it himself.

Yang Kai paid close attention and was prepared to step in at any time. He didn’t know if he could help others when they encountered difficulties during their breakthrough to the Open Heaven Realm, or if he could assist them in any way, but he could only prepare in advance.

At a certain moment, the flaring aura suddenly disappeared, shocking everyone. They thought that something terrible had happened to Iron Blood Great Emperor; however, soon after, a strange feeling slowly spread out. When they probed, they sensed that the place where Iron Blood Great Emperor was standing was a chaotic mess, as if everything in this world had been turned into nothingness.

Yang Kai’s brow rose as he recalled the scene of him breaking through to the Open Heaven Realm. How could he not know that Iron Blood Great Emperor had reached the final step? He couldn’t help feeling excited.

A fierce shout suddenly rang out from Iron Blood Great Emperor’s side, “Open!”

A violent rumbling sound rang out as Chaos erupted and Heaven and Earth split apart.

The aura of the newly born Universe World spread out in all directions like a thunderstorm, spreading fierce gales and causing everyone’s clothes to flutter.

“Success!” Duan Hong Chen exclaimed softly, his eyes glowing with envy.

“Hahahaha!” Iron Blood Great Emperor laughed heartily, “Amazing!”

Martial Beast Great Emperor curled his lips, “Show off!”

Although he said so, there was still pride in his eyes; after all, they were all Great Emperors, and with Iron Blood reaching the Open Heaven Realm, he would soon be able to catch up.

Yang Kai’s tense heart finally relaxed as he let out a long sigh and smiled, “Everyone, please come with me to congratulate him.”

Saying so, he took the lead and flew forward while the others followed closely behind.

A distance of 100 kilometres was covered in the blink of an eye. Iron Blood Great Emperor stood there, gently clenching his fists. His face filled with confidence as if he could grasp the entire world in his palm.

Yang Kai could understand what he was feeling. On the Martial Dao, the gap between the Emperor Realm and the Open Heaven Realm was a big leap, a qualitative change that was difficult to describe, especially with Iron Blood Great Emperor breaking through directly to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. At this moment, the strength he possessed was thousands of times greater than before!
