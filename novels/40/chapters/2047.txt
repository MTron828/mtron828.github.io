As soon as Zong Qing said this, everyone’s face turned grim, but more than that, some people looked embarrassed. Obviously, as Zong Qing had said, not all cultivators were using their full strength when cooperating with the two Dao Source Realms; they were all hoping for others to make the effort while they sat back and enjoyed the fruit of others’ labour.

If the third barrier was broken in one fell swoop, it was safe to assume that no one would blame them. But now that the breaking of the third barrier had reached a stalemate, some people were left in an embarrassing situation.

Zong Qing said again, “This Zong has no idea what’s going on in your mind, but this Zong wants to see what kind of treasures are inside!”

Just as his voice fell, his body erupted with energy as he poured his energy even more fiercely into the dagger.

Someone in the crowd couldn’t help but shout, “Since even Vice Temple Master Zong is being so sincere, how can we hide anymore? If we don’t do it now, when will we!?”

While speaking, he no longer hid anymore and poured every bit of his Saint Qi into the dagger.

The rest of the people glanced at each other with a determined look in their eyes. They too started to rouse their energy.

In a short time, the already huge dagger had grown a lot bigger. Obviously, it had received a lot more energy.

After such an increase, Lian Yu Ming faintly felt that he couldn’t bear it anymore. His expression couldn’t help but change. He exclaimed aloud, “Great, with your help, this Old Master will risk everything to break this barrier!”

He opened his mouth and spewed a mouthful of Blood Essence that turned into mist and enveloped the dagger.

Very soon, the mist of blood was completely absorbed by the dagger as a glowing layer of crimson appeared along with its colourful sheen. At first, the dagger seemed uncontrollable, but it actually settled down again.

Lian Yu Ming let out a furious cry as the dagger and the third barrier clashed with each other with an earth-shattering sound, causing even the World Energy to become chaotic.

*CRACK...*

Finally, a soft sound which everyone was waiting for was heard. Everyone couldn’t help but smile happily.

Because an opening had finally appeared on that rock-hard third barrier.

Lian Yu Ming changed the seals again as he urged his Mid-Rank Dao Source Grade artifact to fiercely slash forward.

The third barrier instantly shattered to pieces with a clattering noise. It broke like a mirror. Much to everyone’s surprise, it broke just like that.

The instant the third barrier broke, the first and second barrier burst like a bubble and disappeared all of a sudden.

“We did it!” someone cried in joy.

But many more people were already in motion, ready to rush ahead.

But right then, Lian Yu Ming and Zong Qing suddenly withdrew 30 or so metres. At the same time, the Raging Fire Temple disciples followed suit, backing away together.

Upon seeing this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but chuckle. Without a warning, he grabbed Kang Si Ran, who was about to rush forward, and flew back several dozen feet.

The next moment, swishing sounds were heard as something suddenly shot out.

Suddenly, dazzling beams of light shot out from the wall of stone in the front, raining down on the crowd.

“What’s this!”

“Damn it, quickly hide!”

Screams and shouts quickly resounded on the mountain. When those unsuspecting cultivators noticed that something was wrong, they evaded left and right, again and again.

But the beams shooting out of the wall of stone were simply too fast. Before they could mount any kind of reaction, the beams were already upon them.

The next moment, miserable cries rang, one after another. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The cultivators in the sky fell down like dumplings, bleeding buckets. And the stronger ones even burst into mists of blood; not even their bones were left.

Most of the several dozen cultivators fell in an instant. And none of the Origin Returning Realm masters had survived. Even the surviving Origin King Realm masters were injured. Some of the seriously injured ones were missing their arms and legs. It was a ghastly sight.

Far away, Yang Kai’s face turned ashen. Kang Si Ran’s face was even paler; fear could be clearly seen on his face.

Had Yang Kai not noticed everything quickly and pulled him back, he might have been seriously injured if not dead already.

“As I thought. After the barrier broke, there were other traps!” Zong Qing’s words suddenly echoed from one side.

Lian Yu Ming gently nodded his agreement. “Fortunately, we were ready for it, otherwise...”

While speaking, he turned his head and looked around. All the surviving cultivators were filled with righteous indignation when they noticed his gaze. Their faces distorted with anger.

But no one dared to say anything.

They all knew it would be useless to say anything now. Even though the Raging Fire Temple was unkind to them, why would people not try to outwit the other? Why would they not scheme against each other? How could they blame others when they themselves hadn’t taken preventive measures? They could only blame themselves for not able to see it miles away.

What’s more, no one among the Raging Fire Temple had been injured. More importantly, they still had the two Dao Source Realm masters, who hadn’t taken the initiative to attack them. But if they point fingers at them now, they might really kill them.

No one would do such a stupid thing.

“Huh!?” Zong Qing suddenly let out a soft exclamation as he turned his head and glanced at Yang Kai and Kang Si Ran, who were standing several dozen feet away. He seemed surprised that the two were safe and sound.

However, he didn’t care about it too much. Instead, he said to the Raging Fire Temple disciples, “The barrier is broken, let’s go in.”

While speaking, he took the lead and rushed towards the entrance that had appeared on the stone wall.

The rest of the Raging Fire Temple disciples closely followed after him. After a short while, all the people of the Raging Fire Temple had left.

Only now did everyone let their tongues loose; all kinds of curses and swears rang everywhere. However, these cultivators could only satisfy themselves like this. Having suffered serious injuries, no one had any courage left to explore the cave mansion! Not to mention, no one could say whether there were even more horrifying barriers inside. And then there were also those shameless guys of the Raging Fire Temple, they weren’t that easy to provoke. If they entered in their current shape, there was a 90% likelihood that they would die.

As such, many people immediately flew away after cursing for a while, looking for a place to heal their injuries.

Yang Kai and Kang Si Ran looked at each other, their faces growing incomparably ugly.

Even though they already knew that the Raging Fire Temple people weren’t that easy to reason with, who would have thought that they would murder with a borrowed knife and directly cull away their potential rivals.

Among the foreign cultivators, only Yang Kai and Kang Si Ran were still in one piece. And if they went in and ran into the Raging Fire Temple team, they both had a pretty clear idea how things would end for them then.

Just when the two were hesitating, the opening on the stone wall started rumbling. The two were shocked when they heard the rumble. They looked up and saw that the opening was closing at a subtle speed.

“This opening won’t last for a long time!?” Yang Kai’s expression changed. He quickly asked, “Brother Kan, are we going in or not?”

Kang Si Ran’s face changed. He was still hesitating. But when he saw that the hole was about to be completely closed, he grit his teeth and said, “Brother Yang, you should go back, I will go in alone!”

Obviously, he didn’t want to drag Yang Kai with him.

Having said this, he flew straight towards the stone wall.

A moment later, his figure appeared inside the Yuan Furnace Mountain. When he looked back, the entrance was already closed.

Kang Si Ran turned his head as if he sensed something. The next moment, he saw a smiling Yang Kai looking at him.

He didn’t even realize that Yang Kai had come in with him. He couldn’t help but say in surprise, “Brother Yang, you...”

“There is plenty of time for whatever you want to say later, let’s solve the immediate problem first.” Yang Kai chuckled as he turned and stared at the front.

In front of them were two Third-Order Origin King Realm Raging Fire Temple disciples, coldly staring at them. They looked displeased and angry.

The figure on the left was tall and, maybe because he cultivated Fire Attribute Secret Art, his skin and even his hair were red. The figure on the right was short and chubby, with a big belly. He was staring at Yang Kai and Kang Si Ran with a smile on his face. His face was plump and when he narrowed his small eyes, his eyeballs couldn’t be seen.

Kang Si Ran couldn’t help but furrow his brow at the sight of this. Naturally, they knew that these two Raging Fire Temple disciples were left to guard the opening, preventing anyone from entering this place.

Having thought all this, he cupped his fists and asked, “Friends, what’s the meaning of this?”

The tall cultivator on the left didn’t answer but the fat cultivator smiled and said, “Aren’t you two clear what it means? Everyone is smart here, so I won’t speak nonsense anymore. Now that the entrance is closed, it seems that no one else will come in. What do you two think? Should my fellow brother and I compete with you or should we sit down and talk to kill time?”

Kang Si Ran’s expression changed. He rebuked in a low voice, “Your Excellency, you mean to say that you won’t let us pass?”

The obese cultivator cupped his fists and said, “It’s two Vice Temple Masters’ order. This one doesn’t dare to disobey it. Friends, please don’t make it difficult for us. Anyway, we just worked together to break the barrier just now, didn’t we?”

“When all hares are killed, the hounds are stewed and eaten. The Raging Fire Temple’s means are really praiseworthy,” Kang Si Ran’s face turned livid in anger as he quickly asked. “And what if this Kang insists on passing through?”

The obese cultivator’s face turned ashen. He narrowed his small eyes as they flickered with cold gleam. His tone also grew colder, “If that’s the case, then don’t blame my fellow brother and me for being merciless.”

“Wait a minute!” Right then, Yang Kai suddenly reached out and shouted.

The obese cultivator immediately turned his gaze at Yang Kai. Originally, he believed that Yang Kai wanted to say something but the next moment, he saw a beam shooting toward him like a bow fired from an arrow.

The obese cultivator’s expression changed. He took a deep breath as his already fat body suddenly grew fatter. His entire figure had doubled in size.

He then opened his mouth and threw a ball of fire, which in turn transformed into a Fire Dragon and greeted the oncoming beam.

While the two made their moves, Kang Si Ran and the tall man also reacted. Kang Si Ran didn’t say anything and suddenly summoned a club-shaped artifact. After he poured his Source Qi into it, the club-shaped artifact immediately shot straight toward the tall and robust man, leaving a purple trail.

The tall man was taken aback by this sight but he didn’t panic. A long sabre appeared in his hand with a flick of wrist before he shouted, “The Saber Rules the Jianghu!”

He swung the sabre diagonally. It started to radiate scorching hot energy before a peerless beam shot out from the blade, greeting the oncoming artifact.

BAM BOOM BAM...

The four Third-Order Origin Kings hurriedly acted in the narrow tunnel, the resulting force from their clash gave the impression that it would blow the entire mountain apart.
