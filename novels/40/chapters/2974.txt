The dense bloody light was sucked into the humongous mouth. In a panic, the Blood Demon revealed his true body, but that only made it even more convenient for the black puppy to devour him. Its humongous mouth suddenly closed and bit into the Blood Demon’s lower half, and no matter how hard the other struggled, he couldn’t escape.

The Blood Demon’s face went pale as he cried for help, but which Demon present dared to rescue him? The aura of the black puppy wasn’t strong, but its unique air made them feel a chill run deep into their bones, and added with how the Shadow Demon had called it an Abyssal Returner just now, it made them even more frightened. At this moment, they only wished to be as far away from it as possible.

The Blood Demon was sucked in, little by little, completely unable to use any of his strength. It was like he had become a Demon who had never cultivated before, unable to even circulate his Demon Qi.

Looking at it, the scene was reminiscent of a python swallowing its prey. Snake species like pythons could swallow prey larger than themselves whole, so why couldn’t the black puppy?

Crimson flames blossomed and a searing force burst forth, it was Zhu Qing and Zhu Lie making their move.

They were both Red Dragons and cultivated Fire Attribute Source Strength. The temperature of the surrounding space rose sharply and the world seemed to have turned into a refining furnace, melting all the Demons nearby.

A dragon breath, fireballs, and fire blades covered the sky, with the Demons instantly beaten into a mess. Panic ensued, and the Demons were cut down like grass.

Although the Demons were large in number and they possessed a variety of strange and difficult to deal with abilities, even if Yang Kai and Zhu Qing hadn’t appeared, Zhu Lie would have still done fine against them by himself.

An Eighth-Order Red Dragon was an existence that surpassed a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, which was more than enough to massacre these Demons.

From just one attack, the hundreds of Demons were reduced by half. None swept up by the hot flames had survived, all died without exception.

The Charm Demon screamed, the Shadow Demon paled, the Sand Demon tried to escape, but the surrounding space was sealed, making it impossible to use their Divine Abilities to flee.

Zhu Qing charged and her small fist connected with the Charm Demon dressed in a revealing outfit. An explosive force erupted, reducing the Charm Demon to a pulpy mess without a single bone intact.

The Charm Demon had been on her nerves for a while now. She kept throwing amorous glances about all the time. Just who was she making those to? What was there worth seeing about her?

After failing to flee, the Sand Demon had only just steadied himself when Zhu Lie’s fire blade in the sky swooped down and cut him into two.

The remaining Shadow Demon became the single pillar of the remaining Demons, making the situation bleak. He looked around, as an army of hundreds was nearly annihilated, and in such a muddle-headed manner, leaving him as the sole survivor. His blood went cold and his hands and feet trembled.

Two Dragon Clan members were so powerful without even revealing their true forms. If they fought using their Dragon Forms, even if he had an army ten times larger, it would still be swept away.

Zhu Lie charged towards the Shadow Demon while the latter reused his old tricks, executing his life saving Innate Divine Ability again, but he was hit with a burst of Dragon Pressure at the last moment, disorientating him and making it impossible for him to activate his skill. Zhu Lie crashed into him and smashed his head, sending red and white matter splattering in a gruesome display.

At this time, the black puppy finished swallowing the Blood Demon into its stomach with gusto. Still not satisfied, it looked around, but there wasn’t a single live Demon left to be seen as the entire army had been wiped out.

It snorted, ignoring the corpses, and turned to Yang Kai in the sky.

Yang Kai didn’t move this entire time. Other than making the spatial cage, he hadn’t killed a single Demon. That was because he knew he didn’t need to act.

He landed beside Li Jiao and lowered his head to look at him.

Li Jiao happened to open his eyes at this time, and when he saw Yang Kai, he made a smile that looked even uglier than crying, “Palace Master Yang… Help ah…”

Yang Kai raised a brow, “What does Brother Li mean? In my opinion, Brother Li is as mighty as a Dragon and as fierce as a Tiger. You are still very vigorous, there is no place for me to help.”

Li Jiao pushed on, “Palace Master Yang, you can’t just lie with your eyes wide open, this Li… This Li had been corroded by Demon Qi, can’t you tell?”

He landed in the Revolving World with Zhu Lie, but wasn’t as fortunate as Yang Kai. No one guided them to Human Imperial City, so he had been wandering in the outside world the entire time. When the World Principles shifted and Demon Qi filled the air; even Li Jiao, someone in the Third-Order Emperor Realm, was unable to resist, ultimately resulting in Demon Qi invading his body.

That Demon Qi was extremely hard to purge, like maggots on rotting bones, present no matter what. If that wasn’t the case, with his cultivation, it would’ve been impossible for him to fall under the Charm Demon’s control. His injury from Zhu Qing was a minor issue, at most, it was just a few broken bones and spitting a bit of blood, he would recover after recuperating for a while, but corrosion from Demon Qi could cost him his life and if it wasn’t handled properly, he could lose his mind.

Seeing Yang Kai now was like seeing a life-saving straw.

“I can tell, but I’m also helpless seeing your situation,” Yang Kai rubbed his chin.

Li Jiao nearly cried when he heard him, “Palace Master Yang, you must help, this Li only followed you for your sake! If Palace Master Yang didn’t insist, how would this have happened to this Li? In Fire Dragon Palace, I would be enjoying prestige and luxury, but now, this has happened to me. I have to say this, Palace Master Yang… You must take some responsibility here!” He gauged Yang Kai’s expression as he talked, afraid to offend the other.

Yang Kai did get offended and sternly rebuked, “Rice may be eaten at will, but words cannot be spoken arbitrarily. You came with me because of the conditions you negotiated in advance, you’re not without gains. Not to mention, I didn’t cause you to be corroded by Demon Qi, it was your insufficient strength and brittle will, why should I be responsible?”

Li Jiao cried without a mournful expression, “Palace Master Yang, are you just going to stand by and watch as this Li becomes corroded with Demon Qi, loses his consciousness, and degenerates into a Demon?”

“Hm, why wouldn’t I?” Yang Kai asked curiously, “Rest assured, if you succumb, this Young Master will personally take care of you and give you a quick death.”

Li Jiao scolded the other’s mother in his mind, so regretful he turned green. If he knew this was going to happen, he wouldn’t have followed Yang Kai to the Frozen Earth no matter what. Now that he was like this he was sure what the future would be like and was at a loss.

“Alright, alright,” Yang Kai suddenly chuckled. He patted the other’s shoulder and pulled him up.

Li Jiao was disorientated by the sudden change of attitude. He looked at him blankly and asked, “Palace Master Yang… Are you…”

Yang Kai replied, “Isn’t it just Demon Qi corrosion? Anyone else would’ve really become a Demon by now, but fortunately, Brother Li, your cultivation is high. Although you’ve been corroded, it’s not incurable.”

Li Jiao’s eyes lit when he heard this, he said hurriedly, “This Li knew Palace Master Yang wouldn’t be so heartless. Palace Master Yang, please tell me the way to save me!”

“The way to save you is right in front of you!” Yang Kai chuckled.

Li Jiao was perplexed.

Yang Kai nodded in a direction and whispered, “Go find Zhu Lie and ask him to give you some Dragon Blood. Dragon Blood carries high resistance to any kind of corruption and can certainly drive out the Demon Qi in you.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Li Jiao was instantly frightened and his face paled as he waved his hands, “Palace Master Yang, please don’t joke around, how can something like Dragon Blood be so easily obtained? If Zhu Lie learned of my intentions, he might slap me to death! This Li is only a small fish, I wouldn’t dare to have any such thoughts.”

“It is precisely so that you have to do this. With your background, if you could ingest some Dragon Blood, tsk, tsk…”

“Gudong…” Li Jiao couldn’t help gulping.

Speaking of which, he was also considered to be a descendant of the Dragons. Although his Dragon Blood was weak and diluted, if he really ingested some pure Dragon Blood, it would increase his strength dramatically and elevate his bloodline by a grade. Yang Kai’s words sounded absurd at first, but they rang incessantly in his ears, bewitching him into action.

An excited gleam flashed through his eyes and the Demon Qi seemed to have become even thicker.

Yang Kai took in this scene and said nothing, only grinning meaningfully as he turned his head.

Meanwhile, Zhu Qing and Zhu Lie were having a discussion of their own. One acted like she had committed a grave crime, her eyes were evasive and unable to meet the other’s eyes. The other had a face full of shock and was scrutinizing his Elder Sister, like he was meeting her for the very first time.

Zhu Qing’s face was faintly red and her gaze became even more evasive.

“You…” After a long time, Zhu Lie finally spoke, “How did you reach the Ninth Order?”

From the time they reunited, Zhu Lie felt something was off. Zhu Qing’s bloodline seemed to be purer than his now. When she left Dragon Island, both siblings had been at the Eighth-Order. The bloodline of the Dragon Clan was extremely difficult to promote. Initially, it was influenced by their lineage, then by their own efforts and resources from Dragon Island. None of these conditions could be missed.

The siblings could be considered as two of the few powerhouses on Dragon Island, with their Eighth-Order strength already being considered amazing. Even the Great Elder was only a Tenth-Order Dragon.

The Great Elder once said the siblings were likely to remain stagnant in the Eighth-Order throughout their lifetime, and there was only a slight chance of them breaking through to the Ninth-Order. The Great Elder had lived for a long time and his judgements were almost always accurate.

And reality proved him correct. After the siblings reached the Eighth-Order, it became harder and harder for them to improve their bloodline in recent years. No matter how many Dragon Blood Flowers they consumed, no matter how long they spent in closed-door cultivation in the Dragon Palace, there was no significant progress.

Zhu Lie never thought he would see his Elder Sister becoming a Ninth-Order Dragon!

It was inconceivable, but Zhu Lie believed he wasn’t mistaken. Dragons were incredibly sensitive to each other’s bloodlines, so even if Zhu Qin wasn’t in her true form, the Ninth-Order aura she exuded was quite palpable.

Zhu Lie felt like there was a cat scratching his heart with its claws. He felt envious of his Elder Sister promotion, but also admired her. He wanted to know what the secret behind Zhu Qing’s sudden breakthrough was.

Zhu Qing didn’t answer, but her expression became even more bashful, causing Zhu Lie to ask again.

Zhu Qing finally said quietly, “The opportunity just came…”

“Impossible!” Zhu Lie refuted. He felt that Zhu Qing was being too stingy here, actually wanting to keep it a secret, only making him even more curious.

“Qing’er, you reached the Ninth-Order?” Yang Kai walked over and asked in surprise.
