“In the past, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor once went looking for the Immortal Tree to gain immortality. He even tore apart the Star Boundary’s Starlight Corridor and invaded countless lower Star Fields. Every time he went to a Star Field, countless Cultivation Stars would be devoured by him, plunging people into misery and suffering. It was for this reason that he finally incurred the wrath of the entire world,” Qi Hai unhurriedly continued, “But unfortunately, even the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was unable to find the Immortal Tree.”

Yang Kai was filled with fear after hearing this.

He could say for sure that the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor had never been to Heng Luo Star Field. Had he been there, he might have really found the Immortal Tree; however, his arrival would have definitely brought doom to the Heng Luo Star Field.

Qi Hai continued, “Unable to find the Immortal Tree, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor could only look for other methods. The popular rumour is that the reason why the other Great Emperors besieged the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor in the Shattered Star Sea was because his behaviour was no longer acceptable, but in fact, that was only a part of the reason.”

Yang Kai’s expression changed as he asked, “What’s the other reason?”

“There was another bigger reason. He wanted to attack another Great Emperor and snatch something from him!”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s mind quickly started working. All of a sudden, he was struck with some realization as cried out in alarm, “Could it be…”

Qi Hai confirmed it with a nod, “Yes, it’s exactly as Brother Yang has guessed. It is absolutely impossible for Great Emperors to fight if there isn’t an absolute irreconcilable enmity between them. However, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s conduct undoubtedly touched the inverse-scale and bottom line of all the other Great Emperors. If they ignored this, the next unlucky person might be themselves, so they formed an alliance and declared war against Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. Their battle shattered the sky and split worlds, causing the universe to shatter, resulting in the creation of this Shattered Star Sea!”

“What the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor wanted to steal was the Martial Flame Great Emperor’s Phoenix True Fire!” Qi Hai’s face grew serious, “The Phoenix True Fire is the inheritance of a True Fire Phoenix. The Fire Phoenix might die, but its Phoenix Fire will never go out. It even has the Heaven-defying Divine Ability of nirvana, so the Phoenix True Fire is also known as the Nirvana True Fire. It’s ranked at the top among all the exotic fires created by the Heavens. The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor wanted to obtain the Phoenix True Fire and understand the mysteries of eternal life from it. If the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor really succeeded in getting his hands on it, then he might have really gotten what he wanted.”

“During that battle, the Martial Flame Great Emperor was the first to fall under the hands of Heaven Devouring Great Emperor; after all, he was the main focus of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. The Phoenix True Fire was also pulled out by him, but in order to prevent the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor from getting his hands on the Phoenix True Fire, the Yuan Ding Great Emperor could only use his own Mountains and Rivers Bell to suppress it. He was also helpless. And without the Mountains and Rivers Bell, the Yuan Ding Great Emperor’s strength plummeted, so he too followed the footsteps of the Martial Flame Great Emperor. However, the Phoenix True Fire suppressed by the Mountains and Rivers Bell was sent away by another Great Emperor during the tangled fight. It had been missing since then!”

“Over the years, countless cultivators have entered the Shattered Star Sea to find the treasures left by the fallen Great Emperors, but few knew that the Phoenix True Fire was being suppressed under the Mountains and Rivers Bell.”

Listening to Qi Hai, Yang Kai immediately understood why he secretly remained and he couldn’t help but smile as he praised, “Brother Qi Hai, you really know a great deal.”

Qi Hai stated, “This Qi has been paying attention to the whereabouts of the Phoenix True Fire, and has also read countless ancient books due to some special circumstances.”

“Special circumstances?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

Qi Hai timely cupped his fists and explained, “I’ll be honest with Brother Yang. This Qi’s wife was severely injured twenty years ago, and had been in a coma since then. Although this Qi has tried everything to save her, I could only keep her barely alive. It’s not a long-term solution. In order to save her, apart from the Immortal Source Liquid on the Immortal Tree, only the Phoenix True Fire will do.”

Yang Kai’s face turned livid as he coldly snorted and asked, “Brother Qi, did you come to me to ask for the Phoenix True Fire? If so, then this Yang has been wrong about you. It was a pleasant talk, but I didn’t expect that Brother Qi had this plan in his mind. Goodbye!”

“Brother Yang, you are misunderstanding me,” Qi Hai hurriedly waved his hands, “Can you please listen to me first?”

Yang Kai coldly glanced at him and stated, “I’m neither your friend nor your relative, why must I care about your troubles?”

Large beads of sweat immediately appeared on Qi Hai’s forehead and he promptly swore, “If Brother Yang is willing to help me this time, this Qi is willing to pay any price. Whatever Brother Yang asks of me, this Qi will definitely do it for you.”

“Even if I want you dead?” Yang Kai pursed his lips as a sinister smile appeared on his lips.

Qi Hai’s face slightly changed but he quickly gave a big-hearted smile, “If Brother Yang really saves my wife, this Qi will commit suicide in front of you.”

Yang Kai’s expression changed ever so slightly, the corners of his lips twitching as he muttered, “You’re crazy!”

Qi Hai smiled instead and asked, “I wonder whether Brother Yang had met a woman whom you can depend on to stand beside you even in the face of death? If you have met such a woman, you will be able to understand this Qi’s feelings.”

Several beautiful figures flashed across Yang Kai’s eyes and he couldn’t help but be a little moved.

He wondered if those few encountered something similar, what would he do? Suddenly he understood Qi Hai’s feelings.

“Although I sympathize with you, I can’t give you the Phoenix True Fire,” Yang Kai shook his head. The Phoenix True Fire was too precious and he already planned to give it to Liu Yuan. He couldn’t hand it to Qi Hai just because of a few words.

Who knows if this Qi Hai was speaking the truth or not? Even if what he said was true, there was no friendship between them that would warrant such a sacrifice.

Qi Hai stated, “Brother Yang, you really misunderstood me. I don’t want your Phoenix True Fire.”

Yang Kai furrowed his brow as he asked, “Then, what do you want?”

Qi Hai replied, “I just wanted to ask Brother Yang to come with me. You only need to use the Nirvana Divine Ability of the Phoenix True Fire a little. It will be enough to save my wife. And you will not lose the slightest.”

“Just this?” Yang Kai asked, surprised.

“Just this!” Qi Hai solemnly nodded.

Yang Kai pondered for a while before asking, “What kind of injuries has your wife suffered? Why are you sure that the Phoenix True Fire will save her?”

Qi Hai’s expression turned dark as he explained, “It’s not an injury per se, but more of a kind of cold poison. At the edge of the Eastern Territory lies the vast Ancient Wild Lands. Only a few people ever set foot into those lands and fewer return, but where there is danger, there is also opportunity. Many Masters of the Eastern Territory like to go to the Ancient Wild Lands to explore and temper themselves. My wife once went to the Ancient Wild Lands alone twenty years ago, from which she returned seriously wounded a month later. Since then, she has been in a coma. According to my Qi Family Fort’s Alchemist, my wife was poisoned, and the poison in her system is none other than the Heavenly Frost Earth Rain!”

“Heavenly Frost Earth Rain!” Yang Kai’s face immediately changed when he heard this and he couldn’t help but cry out in shock, “One of the Ten Extreme Poisons!?”

Qi Hai looked at Yang Kai in surprise as he asked, “Brother Yang knows about the Heavenly Frost Earth Rain?”

Yang Kai gently nodded, “I’ve heard of it.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Qi Hai bitterly smiled, “Since Brother Yang has heard of it, you should know that there is basically no cure for someone afflicted by this kind of poison.”

“Indeed!” Yang Kai slightly sighed. There was no cure for any of the Ten Extreme Poisons. Basically, one would just be counting his or her days unless he or she encountered some astonishing treasure, such as the Immortal Tree.

“However, the Phoenix True Fire’s Nirvana Divine Ability may be able to cure my wife,” Qi Hai blazingly stared at Yang Kai as he continued, “My main purpose for entering the Shattered Star Sea this time was to find the Phoenix True Fire and take it back to the Qi Family Fort. But… after watching everything, this Qi realized that he was far too naive. With my current strength, I wouldn’t have been able to even approach the Phoenix True Fire.”

Qi Hai had naturally seen the Golden Divine Dragon Source Strength breaking out of Yang Kai and its fight with the Phoenix True Fire. Just remembering that terrifying battle made him tremble all over.

“Brother Qi, you are overestimating me. I still haven’t subdued it, I was only able to temporarily suppress it,” Yang Kai calmly explained.

“Suppressed…” Qi Hai nervously gulped. It sounded even more unbelievable than Yang Kai subduing the Phoenix True Fire and he immediately muttered in admiration, “Brother Yang is really amazing.”

Yang Kai furrowed his brow as he stated, “Although even the Heavens and Earth would be moved by Brother Qi’s feelings for your wife, please forgive this Yang for being incapable of helping you.”

Qi Hai’s face darkened. He knew that he couldn’t force this kind of thing. Yang Kai hadn’t subdued or refined the Phoenix True Fire at all, so even if he did want to help, he was unable to do so, this was a simple fact. In order to save Qi Hai’s wife, Yang Kai must first refine the Phoenix True Fire; otherwise, once he took out the Phoenix True Fire, not to mention saving his wife, everyone might be burned to ashes in an instant.

“Then… Will Brother Yang come to the Qi Family Fort in the Eastern Territory after you have refined the Phoenix True Fire someday?” Qi Hai pleadingly looked at Yang Kai before earnestly swearing, “Right now, this is my last hope to save my beloved wife. Brother Yang, rest assured, this Qi will never divulge anything he witnessed today, if I do so, may I be struck by lightning.”

“Qi Family Fort in the Eastern Territory?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

“That’s right!”

“If it’s the Eastern Territory, I may go there someday,” Yang Kai nodded. This time, whether he could get Xiao Xiao’s whereabouts from Yin Le Sheng or not, he had to go to the Eastern Territory because Xiao Xiao may very well be in the Eastern Territory.

“Really!?” Qi Hai was overjoyed when he heard this. He cried, lost in happiness, “Great! When Brother Yang comes to the Eastern Territory, just ask about the Ancient Wild Lands. My Qi Family Fort is near the Ancient Wild Lands.”

“We’ll see when the time comes,” Yang Kai didn’t agree right away. He couldn’t easily make a promise when it came to matters like this. If he failed to fulfil his promise, it would definitely make Qi Hai hate him.

Qi Hai obviously understood this, but the initiative was entirely in Yang Kai’s hands, so he couldn’t force the issue. He could only take out a Communication Bead from his Space Ring and carefully hand it to Yang Kai, “Brother Yang, this is this Qi’s Communication Bead, it might be to use in the future.”

Yang Kai took it and threw it into his Space Ring before cupping his fist and bidding him farewell, “Then, let’s part ways here.”

Qi Hai nodded with a complicated look on his face.

Before Yang Kai left, Qi Hai suddenly cried, “Brother Yang, wait a moment!”

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai gazed back at him.

Qi Hai earnestly asked, “Brother Yang, are you planning to chase after the Mountains and Rivers Bell?”

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “How can I let a Great Emperor’s artifact slip? I should give it a try.”

Qi Hai stated, “Yuan Ding Great Emperor’s Mountains and Rivers Bell is extremely powerful. No one in the Dao Source Realm can succeed in subduing it unless you can get the approval of the Artifact Spirit and let it choose you as its Master.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai flicked his hair as he narcissistically stated, “Since I’m so handsome, it should take a liking to me.”

Qi Hai’s face turned black.
