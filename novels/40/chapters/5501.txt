Chapter 5502: Gifts Blind the Eyes

Zhu Jian seemed to be unwilling. Even for a Divine Spirit like him, 3,000 years was a long time, but before he could even speak, Yang Kai interjected, “There’s no need for any further discussion if you can’t even guarantee 3,000 years.”

When Zhu Jian saw there was no space for negotiation, he sighed dejectedly and said, “Good, 3,000 years.”

It was only then that Yang Kai put him down and retrieved the Golden Crow’s True Fire. This was followed by both sides swearing Oaths upon their Bloodlines. In that Oath, Zhu Jian swore loyalty to Yang Kai for 3,000 years after Yang Kai brought him out of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary.

“Lead me to the other Divine Spirits,” Yang Kai ordered. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zhu Jian understood instantly that this Human did not only intend to subjugate him but all the other Divine Spirits in the Great Ancient Ruins Boundary as well. No one could escape from him.

However, this matter was not necessarily a bad thing for the Divine Spirits of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. They had always wanted to escape from here, so now that there was such an opportunity, nobody would be willing to pass it up.

Understanding this, Zhu Jian stopped being long-winded and immediately led Yang Kai to the closest Divine Spirit.

After an hour, in front of a cave, Yang Kai waited patiently for Zhu Jian to discuss with the Divine Spirit inside. Sometime later, a three-headed, 3,000-metre-long snake emerged from the caves and looked down at Yang Kai while keeping his head high up.

At a glance, Yang Kai recognized that this was Fei Yi, who had Qu Hua Shang as his Bearer.

The middle head of Fei Yi’s three heads asked, “You are able to take me out of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary?”

Yang Kai nodded, “I dare not go against my Bloodline Oath.”

Fei Yi nodded, “If that’s the case, I can work under you for 3,000 years.”

Yang Kai was spared a great deal of hassle thanks to Zhu Jian’s mediation. The two parties once more swore an Oath, just like Yang Kai did with Zhu Jian.

For the next half a month, Yang Kai wandered around the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary and met one Divine Spirit after another. The subdued Divine Spirits helped convince the new ones, making things simpler.

As Zhu Jian was the first to surrender to Yang Kai, he played a vital role in the subsequent subjugation process, so he also subconsciously took on the role of leader.

When Yang Kai returned to the Old Tree again, there were over 100 Divine Spirits of various shapes and sizes following him. These Divine Spirits had a wide range of strength, but the one undeniable fact was that all of them were at least on par with Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters.

The 100 or so formed quite a strong force.

On the other hand, Wu Kuang remained immobile and stuck in place. He was so furious after seeing Yang Kai’s return that his nose puffed smoke. If he were able to speak, he would have cursed Yang Kai to death.

In front of the World Tree, Yang Kai bowed, “Old Tree, I want to send them to the Star Boundary through you.”

On the trunk of the World Tree, Old Tree’s face emerged, “Help yourself.”

Yang Kai nodded and connected to the World Fruit on the World Tree that corresponded to the Star Boundary. Then, he manipulated Space Principles which prompted a Void Corridor to appear in the next instant.

He turned to look at the numerous Divine Spirits following behind and declared, “You can enter the 3,000 Worlds from here. Now that the 3,000 Worlds are at war, we need you to help us in our fight against our enemies. Go to the Star Boundary’s High Heaven Palace and search for a woman named Hua Qing Si. Tell her that I sent all of you as reinforcements. Remember, you must obey her commands when I am not around. If you dare to commit crimes or disobey her orders, I have plenty of ways to make you suffer.”

Many Divine Spirits felt the foreign aura coming from the portal, making them thrilled. Despite Yang Kai’s repeated assurances that he would lead them out of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, it wasn’t until they saw his ability in action that they were able to completely trust him.

After going through this portal, they could finally escape the restrictions of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary and restore their power as true Divine Spirits.

Zhu Jian cupped his fist and said, “Sir may rest assured, since we have established a Bloodline Oath, we dare not violate it.”

“En. Go.” Yang Kai responded with a nod and a wave.

The first to rush towards the portal was Zhu Jian, who was soon followed by several more Divine Spirits. They all shrunk their figures to travel through the portal, disappearing one after another.

It was only after all of the 100 or so Divine Spirits crossed the portal that Yang Kai shut it.

There would certainly be a disturbance with the arrival of 100 plus Divine Spirits at the Star Boundary, but that was not Yang Kai’s concern now.

Grabbing Wu Kuang, Yang Kai addressed the World Tree, “Old Tree, I need to go to Black Territory. May I ask you for guidance?”

Each fruit on the World Tree represented a Universe World which still had its Grand Dao intact. These Universe Worlds were scattered throughout the Great Territories, but there were none in Black Territory.

This was because the entire Black Territory was a Dead Territory, with no Universe Worlds remaining.

Yang Kai couldn’t enter the Black Ink Battlefield or Black Territory directly, so the next best option was to travel to the Great Territory adjacent to Black Territory and enter from there.

Yang Kai could only consult the Old Tree, because he was unsure which World Fruit corresponded to the relevant Universe World closest to Black Territory. Given that the World Fruits were grown on the World Tree, it would know better than anyone which World Fruit corresponded to which Universe World.

After hearing what Yang Kai had said, the Old Tree said nothing, but one of its fruits immediately lit up.

Yang Kai understood what this meant. As he looked up, he saw a black, almost-withered fruit emanating Black Ink Strength from within. Such fruits were not uncommon and represented Universe Worlds that had been corroded by the Black Ink Clan, quickly losing their World Force and Grand Dao.

This was not the worst-case scenario, but it also wasn’t a good situation. After a few years, the sickly fruits would ultimately become completely black, and in the end, they would eventually wither and fall off.

“Take care, Old Tree!” Yang Kai offered his thanks and headed towards the World Fruit while carrying Wu Kuang.

The small World Fruit got bigger in front of their eyes, and transformed into a Universe World.

When Yang Kai and Wu Kuang recovered, they had already arrived on the outskirts of the Universe World. Looking from afar, a Black Ink Nest was ravenously absorbing the remnants of its World Force. Furthermore, dense Black Ink Strength enveloped this whole Universe World.

Yang Kai sighed even though he had encountered numerous situations like this throughout the years.

This Universe World was on the brink of falling. There was no longer a need to refine a Universe World that was filled with Black Ink Strength like this one.

All the living beings here had already been transformed into Black Ink Disciples, becoming servants of the Black Ink Clan.

Of course, Yang Kai could destroy the entire Universe World, but that meant killing all the transformed Black Ink Disciples as well.

There were hundreds of millions of them, so how could Yang Kai be merciless enough to slaughter them?

At this moment, Wu Kuang finally managed to break free from Yang Kai’s grasp and erupted into a fit of rage, roaring, “You Brat! I will remember this and never let you off!”

But, with a single sentence, Yang Kai tamed his enormous rage.

“I’ll give you a World Tree clone.”

Wu Kuang was momentarily stunned, his anger fizzling out as he asked in disbelief, “Really?”

Yang Kai had obtained three clones from the World Tree. Though Wu Kuang desperately wanted one, he knew Yang Kai wouldn’t be willing to give it to him; if it wasn’t because he was weaker than Yang Kai, he would have already snatched one away.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai offered a clone to him willingly, which made him both shocked and delighted.

If he were given this clone, which would stabilize and fortify his Small Universe, Wu Kuang would not need to worry about signs of his Small Universe being unstable due to any sudden increase in strength. He could also maximize the effects of his Heaven Devouring Battle Law with no need to worry about any kind of side effects in the future.

Yang Kai then replied, “But, you’ll have to follow me somewhere.”

Wu Kuang became alert at once, “Where?”

“Don’t ask so much. You’ll know when we arrive.” Saying so, Yang Kai simply took out a World Tree clone and threw it to Wu Kuang.

Wu Kuang quickly accepted it and made sure that it was real before becoming overjoyed. As soon as he put it in his Small Universe, he felt that his aura grew somewhat denser.

He could feel that his Small Universe started getting perfected after he had placed the World Tree clone inside, and in time, Wu Kunag was confident there would be even more benefits as the World Tree clone grew.

He also learned about the mystery of the World Tree clone from the World Tree, like how it absorbed the power of other Universes Worlds. With this World Tree clone, he would be able to save many years of cultivation and ascend to the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm in no time.

Unlike other cultivators, Wu Kuang was not bound by the restrictions of the Open Heaven Realm. Nobody knew how or why, but after acquiring the body of Great Demon God Mo Sheng, he directly ascended to the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm. Logically speaking, the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm should be his limit.

Wu Kuang was currently in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm already, but despite that, he felt that his Martial Dao had not reached its peak. He could still ascend to the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm or even the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

Over the years, Wu Kuang had thought about this matter a lot, and in the end, he concluded that the Heaven Devouring Battle Law he created was so exceptional, that it broke the innate restrictions of the Open Heaven Realm.

On the other hand, it was unfortunate that the Heaven Devouring Battle Law could only be safely cultivated by him. If it was someone else, he or she would first notice rapid advancement during the early stages of cultivation, but as they continued to cultivate, the backlash would grow. Furthermore, there was only one solution to this, the Flawless Purifying Golden Lotus. However, there was only one such lotus in existence.

Having obtained a World Tree clone, Wu Kuang squinted at Yang Kai, “Aren’t you afraid that I’ll run away?”

To which Yang Kai returned a sneer, “You can try!”

Wu Kuang’s expression instantly darkened. Although he was in the Seventh Order, Yang Kai was already in the Eighth Order. On top of that, this man was proficient in the Dao of Space. In the face of someone superior in both cultivation and speed, Wu Kuang had no confidence he would be able to escape under his watch.

He immediately surrendered, “Gifts blind the eyes. Now that I received a World Tree clone from you, I shall follow you wherever you go.”

Yang Kai gave him a long, thoughtful look, [How carefree of you to say that. I hope you won’t regret this in the future.]

Although Yang Kai had no intention to destroy the Universe World in front of them, he did not intend to leave the Black Ink Nest in this Universe World alone. As he extended his palm and slammed it down, the few thousand metres tall Black Ink Nest was crushed into dust. This caused the Black Ink Clansmen in the Universe World to panic, wondering which Human Race Master had come.
