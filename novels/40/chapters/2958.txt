“A Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator dares to show off in front of this Young Master?” Yang Kai sneered as he raised his hand, palming towards Fu Shu without mercy.

He could see that this Human Imperial City was without a doubt safe and undisturbed by the changes in the World Principles outside, but inside it was filled with muddy waters. If he and Zhu Qing wanted to gain a foothold in this place as outsiders, then they needed to show overwhelming power to let others know that they were not to be bullied.

The law of the jungle was the undeniable reality no matter where they were. If it were any different, it only proved that they were not strong enough.

Fu Shu’s strength was not high, only Third-Order Dao Source Realm; however, Yang Kai had sharp eyes and could easily tell that his pompous prince must have achieved his strength through taking numerous elixirs and precious treasures. It was simply impossible for him to display the proper strength of his level, not to mention the fact that this First Imperial Prince seemed to have fallen into an addiction of wine and lust. His body may have long been emptied out by his habits.

Yang Kai could easily destroy several dozen or even hundreds of wastes like him.

Fu Shu did not have the slightest self-awareness and just stood ten meters away from Yang Kai, so how could he have the time to react to this attack?

Emperor Qi surged and World Energy stirred as a palm print visible to the naked eye slapped down towards Fu Shu.

The burly bald-headed man’s face changed dramatically as he shouted, “Stop!”

“Stop your mother!” Yang Kai cursed and did not stop, instead becoming even more violent.

As expected, Fu Shu could not react in time. All this time, he was looking around curiously, hoping to take a look at the body of the beauty behind Yang Kai, so it wasn’t until the palm print approached him that he shrieked and began to shiver, completely at a loss as to what to do.

When the palm print was about to turn Fu Shu into dust, a green glow suddenly emerged from his body, forming a layer of protection around him.

*Hong…*

As the protection shook, Fu Shu’s hair became dishevelled and his clothes were whipped into a mess, but he was unharmed.

“What the hell is that!” Yang Kai’s jaw dropped. He didn’t see any traces of Fu Shu using a skill or technique at that moment, and yet that strange barrier appeared all of a sudden.

Looking him up and down, Fu Shu didn’t seem to be wearing any artifacts either. Rather, he was covered in a lot of useless accessories that were only there for decoration.

After Yang Kai’s unsuccessful opening move, the burly bald-headed man had already rushed over from the side and a flash of light appeared in his hand as a large hammer suddenly appeared. The hammer was half the size of a tea table, and the dazzling light it gave off gave one a grievous sense of danger.

The burly bald-headed man roared, “How dare you disrespect the First Imperial Prince. Suffer death, little brat!”

All the muscles in his body were tensed as he raised the hammer with all his strength, smashing it down on Yang Kai. A thunderous noise filled everyone’s ears in an instant, filling them with awe.

“Help, help!” Yang Kai shouted. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Zhu Qing glared at him before her red hair flashed and her petite body arrived next to Yang Kai. Then, she raised her small, fair, and tender fist to meet the large hammer.

The burly bald-headed man’s face changed and he shouted, “Move!”

He had no idea why this red-haired woman would seek death herself, but he knew that though she seemed to have a decent cultivation, she was, after all, a weak and frail woman. If his attack really connected with her, then she would at least be severely injured, if not dead.

This was a woman that the First Imperial Prince had his eyes on, so how could he dare to harm her?

And he just had to put his all into this attack. Now, even if he wanted to withdraw his move, it was too late. Seeing Zhu Qing block in front of him, the man had no choice but to force his body to twist slightly to the side, shifting the hammer a little in hopes that the woman could escape demise.

Zhu Qing’s fist collided with the huge hammer. The tender fist and the huge hammer formed a very strong visual impact, with no one doubting that Zhu Qing’s end would be miserable beyond comparison.

However, the results of this clash left everyone astonished.

A loud bang rang out. A strong gust of wind tousled Zhu Qing’s red hair slightly as she held her ground while the burly bald-headed man who was holding the large hammer went wide-eyed, as if struck by lightning. After a moment’s pause, he was sent hurtling backwards as if he were struck by lightning.

*Hong long long…*

A row of holes crashed open through the walls of the teahouse and the buildings behind it. At the end of the newly created tunnel, in a cloud of dust, the burly bald-headed man could be seen lying in a pile of rubble, not moving.

The eyes of the crowd almost popped out at this sight, especially the guards who came together with the First Imperial Prince. All of them stared dumbfounded at Zhu Qing. They never would have thought that this delicate little body could release such Heaven-destroying, Earth-shattering power.

This was even more unbelievable to them than seeing a Demon waltzing into Human Imperial City for some casual shopping would have been.

Zhu Qing waved her hand off with a look of disdain.

Outside the teahouse, the two coquettish women inside the palanquin let out screams of terror.

How many years had Human Imperial City maintained its peace? No one ever dared to cause trouble in the city, let alone clash with the Imperial Princes. Suddenly coming across such a scene scared the two women almost to death and their faces went pale as their tender bodies shivered.

Their screams woke up the disoriented Fu Shu.

He was stunned for a while before coming back to his senses. Gritting his teeth, he shouted at Yang Kai, “You hit me?” His tone became harsher and he began to sound hysterical, “You actually dare to hit me? This Prince…”

“Enough nonsense! That’s right, I hit you!” Yang Kai reached for the void, grabbing his Myriads Sword and slashing it straight down at Fu Shu. The sword light was bitterly cold, and the Sword Intent was awe-inspiring.

Fu Shu was so scared that he screamed and tried to run away.

But the Myriads Sword chased after him without giving him even half a chance to escape. One after another, sword lights slashed down on Fu Shu’s body, but none of them did any harm as each time a slash was about to connect, a green glow would emerge from the surface of Fu Shu’s body to block the attacks.

This glow grew stronger or weaker according to the force Yang Kai used, as if it had its own intelligence. It was intent on protecting the First Imperial Prince, Fu Shu, no matter what, and even someone as strong as Yang Kai could not break through the protection of that green light.

Yang Kai clicked his tongue curiously. Sure enough, there were no ends to the world’s mysteries. If he had not chanced upon this Revolving World and entered Human Imperial City, he would never have known that such a strange thing existed in the world.

“Help, help!” The First Imperial Prince shouted as he ran, not at all maintaining even a shred of his majesty as an Imperial Prince. At this moment, he was nothing more than a dog trying to run for his life, even forgetting that he had cultivated before.

His guards finally reacted and rushed towards Yang Kai to protect their master.

Even though the cultivation of these guards was not low, how could they be Yang Kai’s opponents? One by one, the Myriads Sword picked them off and cut them down, chopping all of them up like vegetables. Yang Kai did not kill them, however, and even though the smell of blood permeated throughout the teahouse with wails breaking out everywhere, there were no deaths so far.

But Yang Kai’s savagery scared the First Imperial Prince out of his wits. He didn’t even have the strength to run away anymore and retreated into a corner, his path blocked off. He watched in horror as Yang Kai took step after step towards him. Body shaking, he screamed, “Don’t come over here, don’t come over here! I’m the First Imperial Prince, I order you to stop!”

Yang Kai grinned viciously, and with the fresh blood dripping from his Myriads Sword, he appeared like a devil that had walked straight out of hell.

The First Imperial Prince could wish for nothing more than to faint right there and have death end all his troubles, but the fear festering in his heart just had to keep him far more alert and conscious than usual.

In just a few steps, Yang Kai was standing right in front of the First Imperial Prince. Tilting his head and glancing at him, he slowly stabbed over with his Myriads Sword.

The First Imperial Prince sucked in a deep breath and held it, staring at the tip of the Myriads Sword, terrified beyond words.

When the Myriads Sword was just a finger’s width away from Fu Shu, the green glow reappeared, blocking the Myriads Sword with great tenacity, halting its advancement, meeting strength with strength.

“What is this?” Yang Kai nudged the green layer of protection with the Myriads Sword while looking down at Fu Shu from above.

Fu Shu’s teeth were chattering and he clearly could no longer answer Yang Kai’s questions.

At that moment, someone at the side spoke, “As long as the Sacred Tree’s blessings remain, the Imperial Family will never suffer harm.”

Yang Kai turned his head to look, only to see that the goateed man who had left earlier had reappeared in the teahouse at some unknown time, sitting in the same spot as if he had never moved, looking indifferently at him.

Yang Kai raised a brow, “The Sacred Tree’s blessings? What Sacred Tree?”

The goateed man answered, “It has nothing to do with you, nor I.”

“So you’re not going to tell me? I hate people like you the most. What do you want?” Yang Kai looked impatiently at him.

The goateed man shrugged, “You have offended the First Imperial Prince and injured so many of his guards. There is no place for you in Human Imperial City now.”

“I’m so scared!” Yang Kai scoffed, “Next, are you going to tell me that if I want to live, I should hurry up and kneel to the Third Imperial Prince and lick his boot? That only he can guarantee my safety?”

The goateed man smiled, “A smart man needs only a small reminder.”

Yang Kai snorted, “Seems like everything that happened here was within your expectations. You were also the one who asked the First Imperial Prince to come, aren’t you?”

The goateed man shook his head, “Do not slander me. Everyone knows the First Imperial Prince’s fondness for seeking beauties. Someone had already gone to inform him as soon as you and this young miss appeared in Human Imperial City. This Old Master merely anticipated the scene and came to watch a good show.” After a pause, he looked at Yang Kai and asked, “Well? Do you still refuse?”

Yang Kai still did not reply, but Fu Shu who was cowering in the corner seemed to look with a burning gaze at the goateed man as if he had met his saviour and shouted, “I remember now, you’re the one by Third Brother’s side. That… That guy! That’s right, that guy! Quickly kill this impudent man for me! This Prince will reward you handsomely!”

The goateed man looked disdainfully at the First Imperial Prince, “This Old Master is the Third Imperial Prince’s subordinate, how could this Old Master help you? First Imperial Prince must be confused.”

Fu Shu’s face paled, “Then what do you want before you’ll act?! How about I give you the two women outside?”

The goateed man looked between his legs and sighed, “This Old Master is getting on in age. It’s not easy keeping one’s Yang Essence potent after so many years. En, this Old Master is thankful for First Imperial Prince’s kindness, but unfortunately, this Old Master is powerless to enjoy it.”

“You… How could you do this!” Fu Shu was disappointed.

The goateed man turned back to Yang Kai, “So, your answer remains the same?”

Yang Kai rested the broad Myriads Sword on his shoulder, scoffing.

The goateed man understood and turned back to Fu Shu, “Though this Old Master will not act, this Old Master can offer First Imperial Prince some advice on how to handle this situation.”
