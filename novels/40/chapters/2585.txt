“But… How is that bell back here for no reason?” Xie Wu Wei still couldn’t believe it. Suddenly, something clicked and he asked, staring at Yang Kai, “Could it be that you…”

Yang Kai nodded, smiling, “That’s right! That bell belongs to me now. I was the one who put it there.”

Xie Wu Wei suddenly gawked, his eyes filled with shock. He simply couldn’t believe his ears.

“Monster King, can you help me with this little favour?” Yang Kai’s face turned serious, “Don’t forget, your Soul Brand is still in this Young Master’s hands.”

Xie Wu Wei inquired, furrowing his brow, “What exactly are you planning by asking this King to disclose this news to the Four Divine Venerables?”

“That’s this Young Master’s business, naturally, you don’t need to ask anything about it,” Yang Kai coldly snorted.

Xie Wu Wei ignored his evasion and continued, “You are trying to draw the Four Divine Venerables away… Are you planning to enter the Blood Gate? Aren’t you Human?”

The Blood Gate was a Restricted Area to the Ancient Lands’ residents. Only the Ancient Lands’ residents could feel bloodline attraction. Yang Kai was a Human, so it was strange that he had any desire to enter the Blood Gate. Xie Wu Wei couldn’t figure this out.

“What does it have to do with you?” Yang Kai impatiently pushed him, turned him around, and said, patting his back, “It’s important to quickly get it done.”

Xie Wu Wei didn’t leave but turned around and asked with shining eyes, “Young Master Yang, if you are planning to enter the Blood Gate, count me in too.”

“You also want to enter the Blood Gate?” Yang Kai glanced at him in amazement, but the next moment, he understood that Xie Wu Wei also wanted to get his hands on the power of a Divine Spirit.

Xie Wu Wei snorted and stated with disdain, “If those Four hadn’t been watching nearby, this King would have already rushed in. Why would I wait till now?”

Yang Kai chuckled and agreed, nodding, “Alright, then it will depend on whether you will have the opportunity or not.”

Xie Wu Wei immediately grew excited and his figure flickered, disappearing from Yang Kai’s sight.

..…

At the damaged stone pavilion, the Four Divine Venerables were standing shoulder to shoulder, looking in the Blood Gate’s direction with solemn eyes.

Right then, a Monster General suddenly rushed over below and said, cupping his fist before raising his head, “Greetings, Sirs and Madam!”

Fan Wu coldly asked, staring below, “What is it?”

The Monster General replied, “Reporting to Sir, Monster King Xie Wu Wei is requesting an audience.”

“Xie Wu Wei?” Fan Wu raised his brow.

Naturally, he knew that Xie Wu Wei was one of the eight Monster Kings under him, someone with both strength and intelligence. He could be regarded as one of the top Monster Kings, but what was he doing here at this time?

Fan Wu allowed the request, waving his hand, “Send him over.”

“Yes, Sir!” The Monster General replied before hastily retreating.

Not long after, Xie Wu Wei followed the previous Monster General back. Even as a Monster King, Xie Wu Wei felt a heavy pressure bearing down on him from the Four Divine Venerables, especially since he was conspiring with Yang Kai. This was no trifling matter. Once the Divine Venerable became aware of this, he would immediately die without a burial, so he couldn’t help but be a little nervous. Xie Wu Wei took a deep breath and greeted, cupping his fists, “Greetings Sirs and Madame.”

Apart from Fan Wu glancing at him, the other three remaining Divine Venerables simply ignored him; after all, Xie Wu Wei was a Monster King under Fan Wu. He had nothing to do with them.

“What is it?” Fan Wu indifferently asked.

Xie Wu Wei raised his head to meet Fan Wu’s eyes, putting on the appearance of someone who had something important to say. This look aroused the curiosity of the other three Divine Venerables and they all turned their heads to look at him, one after another.

Fan Wu urged, “If you have something to say, speak up. None of us Divine Venerables are outsiders.”

[I have been waiting for this.] Xie Wu Wei was secretly happy in his heart, but remained completely calm on the surface. He cupped his fists again and reported, “Reporting to Sir, a Monster General under me accidentally found a bell in a mountain three thousand kilometres away from here!”

“A bell? Why are you making so much fuss over a bell?” Fan Wu asked, furrowing his brow.

Xie Wu Wei replied, “According to that Monster General’s description, and coupled with your subordinate’s own speculation, the bell is likely to be the legendary… Mountains and Rivers Bell!”

“What!?” Fan Wu was greatly shocked, and the other three Divine Venerables’ eyes instantly lit up, their surprise no less than the former’s.

In an instant, Xie Wu Wei’s figure sank down to the ground as he felt mountain-like pressure descend on him; he was finding it extremely hard to even breathe.

“Are you sure that it is the Mountains and Rivers Bell?” Luan Feng couldn’t help but ask in a stern tone.

Xie Wu Wei said with difficulty, “I am eighty percent certain it is the Mountains and Rivers Bell because my subordinate said that the bell was exuding an intense Wild Force. It seemed to have an aura capable of suppressing the world. He just glanced at it from a distance before hurriedly reporting back, not daring to approach too close.”

“An aura capable of suppressing the world and intense Wild Force…” Cang Guo’s lips trembled in excitement, “It must be the Mountains and Rivers Bell! Where is it?”

Fan Wu glanced at the excitement in his eyes and indifferently stated, “This is strange, the Mountains and Rivers Bell was stolen from the Ancient Lands by Yuan Ding. We haven’t seen or heard of it for tens of thousands of years. Rumour has it that this Ancient Exotic Artifact was lost in the Shattered Star Sea when Yuan Ding died, so why would it appear in the Ancient Lands for no reason right at this moment?”

He was already getting suspicious. Even though the Mountains and Rivers Bell was of great use to him, he couldn’t help but point this out.

Hearing this, Luan Feng’s pretty eyes flashed and she lightly nodded, “It is indeed a bit strange.”

Shi Huo rolled his eyes and suddenly asked, “How many of you suspect that someone is trying to lure us away from here?”

Fan Wu coldly snorted and glared at Xie Wu Wei, “Wu Wei, this King has always treated you well. Do you know what end you will have if you try to deceive this King?”

Xie Wu Wei’s body turned stiff and he was unable to lift his head under the pressure. He could only continue in a struggling voice, “This subordinate appreciates how Sir has treated him over the years and naturally has not forgotten Sir’s many graces; this subordinate, however, has not spoken any falsehoods. This subordinate dares not hide anything. As for the bell… This subordinate heard that the Shattered Star Sea on the Human side had opened a few years ago. Perhaps someone has brought the Mountains and Rivers Bell out from the Shattered Star Sea?”

A pondering look immediately appeared on Fan Wu’s face after hearing this. Naturally, he knew about the Shattered Star Sea opening, so there was some truth to Xie Wu Wei’s words.

“Whether it’s real or not, we will know after checking it out. It’s only a few thousand kilometres away anyway!” Cang Guo looked as if he couldn’t wait any longer and urged everyone.

“Check, we can naturally go and check, but who will stay here to keep watch?” Fan Wu looked at the other Divine Venerables.

Luan Feng stated with a smile, “This Queen has never seen it. This Queen wants to broaden her vision.”

Cang Guo added with a serious face, “I also want to go and check.”

Fan Wu focused his gaze on Shi Huo, who quickly became unhappy and snapped, “What are you looking at me for? I also want to go. In any case, all of you are going, so I won’t be staying here alone.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Fan Wu heaved a sigh. He knew that he could not count on these three. Since the Mountains and Rivers Bell had appeared suddenly, and it was just a few thousand kilometres away, he couldn’t help but suspect that someone was using it to lure the tigers out of the mountains; however, the Four Divine Venerables wanted it and were afraid that someone else would get their hands on it, so no one was willing to stay here.

Fan Wu sighed and agreed, “Alright, let’s all go and check it out. But not just anyone can collect Ancient Exotic Artifacts like the Mountains and Rivers Bell. It will depend on one’s luck.”

Even though he was suspecting that something was wrong, the temptation of the Mountains and Rivers Bell was too strong. Not to mention that thirty-two Monster Kings and eight Great Kings were overseeing things here. There should be no problem if they were only gone a short time.

Xie Wu Wei, who was all fidgety below, immediately became ecstatic, realizing that things were proceeding as they had expected. Once these four left, it would be much more convenient for Yang Kai to act. It was just that he didn’t know what was making Yang Kai confident that he could crack the Blood Gate seal right in front of so many Monster Race Masters.

There were forty peak Twelfth-Order Masters in the vicinity. If they teamed up, even a Great Emperor would be forced to retreat.

Before he could taste the fruit of his scheme though, Fan Wu suddenly beckoned him and ordered, “Wu Wei, lead the way!”

Xie Wu Wei’s heart turned bitter, but he didn’t dare to object. All he could do was obediently lead the way.

Streaks of light shot into the sky as the Four Divine Venerables disappeared from their spot, led by Xie Wu Wei.

In the distant forest, Yang Kai, who was hiding his own aura, finally heaved a sigh of relief after seeing the Divine Venerables leave. With the Four Divine Spirits overseeing things here, he really didn’t dare to make a rash move.

Fortunately, the biggest threat had now been eliminated. Even though the remaining Monster Kings and Great Kings were strong, they were not strong enough to make him give up.

After silently waiting for a while, making sure that the Four Divine Venerables had really left, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to communicate with his Embodiment.

Inside the Small Sealed World, the Embodiment, who was sitting cross-legged, suddenly opened his eyes and informed in a deep voice, “Prepare yourselves.”

The group of Stone Spirits and Wood Spirits, who had been waiting all this while, exchanged knowing glances. Even Xiao Xiao took out the Heaven Shaking Pill and put it on his shoulders. He was oozing a majestic and awe-inspiring aura.

Everyone knew that a life and death battle was waiting for them. It was a do or die situation!

A solemn atmosphere suddenly spread into the surroundings, making the air inside the Small Sealed World heavier.

On a towering peak was a completely barren and clear field with only an oval-shaped blood-coloured gate of light standing erect.

The Blood Gate!

One of the two Restricted Areas of the Ancient Wild Lands, and the place where residents of the Ancient Lands could be reborn.

A few figures were constantly patrolling around the Blood Gate, each one exuding a thick and strong aura, radiating potent Monster Qi, giving any onlooker an extremely uncomfortable feeling. These were the Great Kings who directly served the Four Divine Venerables, a grand total of eight.

They were the most trusted subordinates of the Four Divine Venerables, so, naturally, they were dispatched to patrol the innermost region, guarding against those Monster Kings who feigned compliance in public but defied in private.

However, the Blood Gate was also a pretty big temptation for these eight Great Kings. This was due to bloodline attraction, which couldn’t be overpowered by loyalty. These eight Great Kings were also looking towards the Blood Gate from time to time as they patrolled the Blood Gate back and forth. After a few glances, their eyes were filled with emotions.

However, with others present, keeping watch on them, they dared not rush towards the Blood Gate despite their pounding hearts.

This kind of thing was extremely painful and tormenting. It was like a delicious meal was placed before a starving man, but he could only see it and not eat it.

Fortunately, the eight Great Kings had incredible mental fortitude, so they could barely suppress their itching hearts.

“Hmm!?” Suddenly, a Great King, who was patrolling nearby, stopped and turned in the Blood Gate’s direction with a frown.

He felt some faint unusual energy fluctuations near the Blood Gate, something that had never happened before.
