“Isn’t it just a book? How did it become an Emperor Artifact?” The inexperienced Zhang Ruo Xi was quite outspoken and she voiced out her doubts.

Duan Yuan Shan said with a smile, “Artifacts come in all kinds of shapes and they aren’t always a sabre, spear, sword, or something of the sort. Besides, the stranger an artifact’s shape is, the stranger its power generally is, too. I have heard about the Unified Ceremonial Record, and it is said that it is an ancient book that absorbed Emperor Aura and Intent from many different Emperor Realm Masters, gradually transforming it into an Emperor Artifact, a very strong Emperor Artifact which has now fallen into the hands of Lou Chi.”

Upon hearing this, Zhang Ruo Xi was still as confused as before and couldn’t understand what was so amazing about it.

As for the few Dao Source Realm Cultivators, they had all revealed a solemn look as they looked excitedly towards the Emperor Artifact in Lou Chi’s hands. They all wished to reach the Emperor Realm one day and obtain their own Emperor Artifact.

...

In the sky, Lou Chi, whose expression was solemn, weaved a series of hand seals before patting the Unified Ceremonial Record several times.

As a ‘swooshing’ sound echoed out, the heavy Unified Ceremonial Record shot forth and floated above the Spirit Lake. A mysterious aura emerged from it, while Emperor Intent and Emperor Pressure emanated out of Lou Chi’s body. He started weaving hand seals again as he mumbled, “The Book of Changes has the supreme origin, which gave birth to Yin and Yang. Yin-Yang turned into the four divisions, which are the basis of the eight trigrams that go back to the ten regions...”

As he mumbled, the Unified Ceremonial Record’s pages started fluttering and a bright golden radiance emanated from the pages and spread to the surrounding area.

The golden radiance emitted indescribable energy ripples that swiftly began sealing the entire region.

Lou Chi started weaving seals at a higher speed while his expression turned more grave. All of a sudden, he stopped and let out a shout, “Perfect Boundary!”

*Hong...*

The golden radiance shone brightly, so brightly that people almost couldn’t open their eyes.

At this moment, all cultivators gathered around the Spirit Lake were pushed away by a soft and formless power and they couldn’t regain their balance until they were pushed beyond a certain point. Despite this, no one seemed to suffer any injuries.

Once the golden radiance disappeared, the crowd took another look and their jaw immediately dropped to the ground.

It could be seen that a golden dome of light had appeared above the Spirit Lake, covering it completely and sealing it thoroughly. Even a wisp of World Energy couldn’t leak out of it.

The Spirit Lake had a radius of around ten thousand meters, yet Lou Chi managed to seal it completely all by himself, and he didn’t even look tired afterwards, as if he had only done some insignificant matter.

The eyes of the numerous Dao Source Realm cultivators shone brightly as they all longed for such great power. Each of them wished and dreamed about obtaining such strength one day.

After Lou Chi had finished this task, he turned around and cupped his fists to Xiao Yu Yang, “I have fulfilled your command.”

Xiao Yu Yang nodded, “Many thanks for your hard work.”

After his voice fell, he strode forward and surveyed the region below him with his eyes.

The cultivators gathered in the vicinity had all stuck out their chests, as each one felt like Xiao Yu Yang was observing him. They were under the gaze of a Silver Star Envoy of Star Soul Palace and they all didn’t dare to act improperly.

Xiao Yu Yang spoke in a clear voice, “A Spirit Lake has suddenly appeared in Maplewood City and it is this land’s good fortune, as well as our Southern Territory’s fortune. However, if we don’t manage it strictly, it will eventually dry out one day. This is why we have sealed it for now. As for how we will use it for the benefit of the people, we Seniors here will have a detailed discussion regarding this issue now.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

After he spoke, he turned to Duan Yuan Shan and said amiably, “City Lord Duan, you are Maplewood City’s Lord, so you also have the right to take part in this discussion.”

Upon hearing this, Duan Yuan Shan was overwhelmed by the amount of respect he was given and his face got rosy. He cupped his fists to Xiao Yu Yang and shouted, “It is my honour to receive an invitation from Your Excellency.”

Xiao Yu Yang nodded, “As for everyone else, you may rest assured that since this Spirit Lake has appeared in Maplewood City, no one will steal it from you and no single force will seek to monopolize it. After we finish our meeting, we will find a way to open it to everyone. Please await good news.”

“What? The Spirit Lake will be open to everyone?”

“Is this real? Did I mishear him?”

“Senior Xiao has spoken personally. It must be true.”

“Senior Xiao is a man of impeccable integrity, as expected of Star Soul Palace, our Southern Territory’s hegemon. They are generous and magnanimous.”

The cultivators present had assumed that after today they wouldn’t get another chance to use this Spirit Lake, thus an uproar arose among them upon hearing Xiao Yu Yang’s statement, delight apparent on everyone’s faces.

But a few people revealed pensive looks. Xiao Yu Yang had a prominent status and wouldn’t lie in front of so many people. Since he had said so, then he would surely open it up to the public.

But, it surely wouldn’t be easy for cultivators to enter this cultivation paradise. They would probably have to meet some conditions or pay a certain price for a quota. If this wasn’t the case and anyone could enter it at will, then the Spirit Lake that only stretched twenty kilometres across wouldn’t be able to accommodate so many people.

It could be well imagined that news of Maplewood City’s Spirit Lake would quickly spread across the whole Southern Territory. Once that happened, many cultivators would swarm over here to seize a cultivation spot within the Spirit Lake.

Maplewood City would become the focal point of the Southern Territory and it would attract many Masters.

Duan Yuan Shan was the City Lord of Maplewood City, and his little city had always been an unwanted child, but it would shortly become popular. Complex emotions welled up in his heart as he felt both excited and worried.

He was excited because Maplewood City would become a great city thanks to the Spirit Lake. As long as it could attract enough people, it would become stronger in the future and would become one of the greatest cities.

As for the source of his worries? He was worried because he wasn’t strong enough to control the Masters that would soon arrive.

He couldn’t help starting to weigh the gains and losses.

“Good! All of you can leave for now. I believe that you will shortly receive good news,” Xiao Yu Yang spoke and waved his hand in dismissal.

Upon hearing this, the numerous cultivators didn’t dare to stay here any longer. They all cupped their fists to Xiao Yu Yang then rushed toward Maplewood City.

“Yang Kai!” Gao Xue Ting suddenly shouted.

Yang Kai turned around and said with a smile, “Elder Gao, what instructions do you have for me?”

“Come to my room tonight,” Gao Xue Ting said with an indifferent look on her face.

“Uh...” Yang Kai was left dumbstruck.

The cultivators who were just about to return home all stiffened and stood in their places in a daze. They all turned their heads and looked in shock at Gao Xue Ting, their eyes almost popping out of their sockets. They all couldn’t believe what they had just heard. Azure Sun Temple’s Elder Gao looked apathetic and as cold as ice, yet she was actually so assertive.

The crowd looked at Yang Kai with envy and jealousy. They all couldn’t help but wonder what was so good about him and why he had been able to gain Elder Gao’s favour.

The few Emperor Realm Masters also wore spectacular expressions. They were all aware that Gao Xue Ting did not mean what it sounded like, but simply uttering such words was too scandalous.

“Why are you wearing such weird looks?” Gao Xue Ting cast an ice-cold glance at the few Emperor Realm Masters near her as her pretty face’s expression turned icy.

“Nothing, it’s nothing. My belly just rumbled. I must have gotten a cold last night,” Ceng Yuan clasped his belly with a pained look plastered on his face, as if he would drop dead at any moment.

“I ate something strange before coming here, I must have gotten sick from that horrendous food,” Lou Chi had also replied with a pained look on his face.

“Are you making fun of me?” Gao Xue Ting revealed a cold smile.

The two Vice Presidents could only laugh awkwardly in response. Neither of them knowing what to say in response.

At the crucial juncture, Xiao Yu Yang coughed, “Let’s talk about business.”

“That’s right, that’s right,” Chen Wen Hao nodded repeatedly like a chicken pecking rice, as if he was afraid that Gao Xue Ting would question him next.

On the other side, after Yang Kai got over this awkward ordeal, he cupped his fists and said with a solemn look, “Understood!”

Gao Xue Ting nodded, “Alright, you can leave!”

Yang Kai pulled Zhang Ruo Xi and quickly rushed into Maplewood City along with the crowd, as if he had just been granted amnesty.

On the road, many cultivators cast frequent glances at Yang Kai, and even Luo Yuan cast a glance at him with a weird look on his face.

“Damn it! That’s so unjust, I’m so ridiculously handsome with a face like jade, yet Elder Gao didn’t even spare me a glance. Why is she so cordial to you?” Ning Yuan Shu, who was under the protection of the two old men, Gao Shan and Liu Shui, yelled at Yang Kai with an indignant look.

Yang Kai sneered and shook his head, letting his black hair flutter in the wind as he let out a sigh, “It’s obvious that I’m more handsome than you.”

“Do you even believe your own words?” Ning Yuan Shu sneered in response.

“Mister is the most handsome man in the world!” Zhang Ruo Xi next to Yang Kai said shyly then lowered her head.

Yang Kai chuckled and patted Zhang Ruo Xi’s little head, “Little girl, you’ve got good eyes. En, once you grow up, you’ll surely find a good husband.”

“I don’t want to...” Zhang Ruo Xi said weakly.

Ning Yuan Shu was very infuriated to see this man and a woman flirting in front of his eyes.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai’s expression turned solemn and he said in a deep voice, “Young Palace Master, let’s take this chance to make something clear.”

“What is it?” Ning Yuan Shu was startled.

Yang Kai cast a glance at him, “You two old men, Gao Shan and Liu Shui, can stand here as witnesses. I saw with my own eyes how your big brother Ning Yuan Cheng died.”

Upon hearing this, the bodies of Gao Shan and Liu Shui shook, while Ning Yuan Shu’s pupils contracted and he yelled, “As expected, you were the one responsible all along.”

Yang Kai snorted and said, “I said I witnessed the murder, not that it was me who killed Ning Yuan Cheng.”

“Who killed him then?” Ning Yuan Shu asked.

“The Wood Spirit!”

“The Wood Spirit?” Ning Yuan Shu raised his brows and revealed a confused look, as if he had never heard about it, but the pupils of Gao Shan and Liu Shui contracted.

Gao Shan shouted in surprise, “Two years ago, I heard that a Wood Spirit appeared and ran amok in Maplewood City, spreading its seeds, devouring souls and enslaving people.”

“You’re right,” Yang Kai nodded and said, “The Wood Spirit planted its seed in Ning Yuan Cheng at some unknown time and no one detected it. It is a long and complicated story, but since Ning Yuan Cheng is someone from the Flying Saint Palace, I’ll tell you everything.”

Soon after, Yang Kai told them briefly what had happened on that day.

Upon hearing him, Gao Shan quieted for a long while before summarizing, “According to what you have said, after the auction that took place on that day, the Young Lord and his companions left Maplewood City, but Star Soul Palace’s exiled disciple Han Leng tailed after them and assaulted them outside the city to steal their possessions. Han Leng even managed to defeat our Flying Saint Palace’s Elder Liu Yi, but he was killed by the Wood Spirit inside the body of the Young Lord.”

“That’s right!” Yang Kai nodded.
