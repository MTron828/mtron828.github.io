Yang Kai’s complexion changed, and he swiftly withdrew his Shi.

If one’s Shi was destroyed by force, it would do great harm to oneself and would be very troublesome to repair.

“A Sect Defending Array?” Yang Kai quickly figured out what Ran Yun Ting had done.

Obviously, she was using a profound Spirit Array arranged on Pure Ice Island to achieve this level of power.

This wasn’t too surprising once he thought of it though; after all, Ran Yun Ting’s status in Ice Heart Valley was extremely high, only below their Supreme Elder and Valley Master, so she could utilize this Sect Defending Array.

“Hahaha, my Ice Heart Valley’s Pure Ice Grand Array is the highest-ranked Spirit Array on Scarlet Wave Star. Boy, you may die content having forced this Elder to this point!” Ran Yun Ting laughed as she gripped the token in her hand and in a burst of light seemed to integrate her into the surrounding icy environment!

In an instant, innumerable ice-blades condensed in the surrounding area and slashed towards Yang Kai.

This was the real power of the Pure Ice Grand Array! Even an Origin King Realm master would have difficulty escaping this trap safely.

The moment Ran Yun Ting mobilized the power of this Grand Array to deal with Yang Kai, all the masters on Pure Ice Island instantly became aware.

On the Inner Island, in the Valley Master’s Ice Palace, Bing Long’s expression changed greatly as she looked towards a certain direction and muttered, “Who is using the Grand Array’s power? Is it Great Elder?”

Releasing her Divine Sense, Bing Long immediately saw the battle taking place at one of the Outer Island’s ice peaks and could not help leaping out of her ice palace in haste.

A dozen other Elders from the Inner Island also noticed this phenomenon and hurriedly rushed out towards the battle.

In a certain secluded place on the Inner Island, however, a woman with silver hair sat cross-legged by a cold lake. She looked young, only about twenty-eight years old, but the aura she gave off was countless times stronger than Bing Long or Ran Yun Ting.

An Origin King Realm master!

Ice Heart Valley’s Supreme Elder, Luo Li!

Her silver hair formed a strong visual contrast with her face, making her seem both mature and youthful all at once.

At this moment, she seemed to be using the cold power of this small lake to do something, inhaling the energy which floated above it into her abdomen with each breath.

Luo Li’s face was a little pale, a result of the cultivation dissonance she suffered recently.

Luo Li also noticed the moment Pure Ice Grand Array activated, but after a slight glance, she quickly ignored it.

To a character like her, there was no need to intervene in these mundane issues. To her, it was all just some minor trouble the younger generation had stirred up, Bing Long would handle it.

However, just as Luo Li was about to continue healing, her expression suddenly changed and she turned towards a different direction, seemingly sensing something. Her complexion immediately became solemn as she muttered, “Chi Huo, can you really no longer restrain yourself? Daring to trespass on my Pure Ice Island... wait, this is....”

When she noticed the existence of the other person, Luo Li’s face grew even more solemn, and after a long silence, she let out a sigh, “I don’t know if my Pure Ice Island can survive this time... I can only hope they don’t go too far.”

Saying so, she slowly got up and her body flickered, disappearing from the lakeside, leaving behind only a slowly fading afterimage.

.....

“How foolish. If you could mobilize the full power of this Pure Ice Grand Array, you might be able to kill me, but with your lowly skill, how much power can you actually borrow from this Grand Array?” Yang Kai roared as a five coloured light burst from his body. These five coloured lights were extremely dazzling, forcing others to look away from him. At the same time, Yang Kai’s momentum soared upwards.

Yang Kai grabbed towards the sky and a golden glow suddenly separated from his body and condensed into a massive golden sword.

Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi, Metal Sword Qi!

With this sword in his hand, Yang Kai’s killing intent erupted outwards, causing Ran Yun Ting’s eyes to shrink and with a shout, she madly poured her Saint Qi into the token in her hand, attempting to draw out more of the Grand Array’s power to suppress Yang Kai.

Countless ice blades, lances, and arrows formed in the sky and lased towards Yang Kai again.

“Come!” Yang Kai shouted as he swung the golden sword in his hand.

The golden light was dazzling and seemed to cut through space itself, filling all of Pure Ice Island with a brilliant radiance that carried with it a sharp, piercing Sword Qi.

The ice blades, lances, and arrows were all like snowflakes under the scorching sun.

Nothing was able to approach to within ten metres of Yang Kai!

His image was that of a wild beast as his black hair flew out behind him, like a god of war who hailed from ancient times, showing an indomitable and heroic spirit.

Countless women from Ice Heart Valley stared at him dumbfounded, a fierce pounding filling their hearts. This palpitation caused Yang Kai to become the only thing in their vision, and they all became unable to tear their eyes away from his figure.

On the Inner Island, the door to Su Yan’s ice room suddenly flung open, and as she rushed out, she immediately caught a glance of a familiar figure a few hundred kilometres away, covered in golden light.

“Junior Brother!” Su Yan murmured.

Although her voice was soft, it seemed to cross over the entire distance between them and Yang Kai, who was still swinging his golden sword, turned his head and looked towards her with a smile.

Su Yan smiled similarly and immediately flew out.

At this moment, her Honoured Master’s orders and the Sect’s rules no longer mattered to her, the only thing her heart desired was to reunite with the man who was raising so much noise on Pure Ice Island for her!

As long as she could see him again and enter his embrace, she could die without regret!

“Where are you trying to run!”

“Su Yan, stop right there!”

Zhou Yun Xuan and the other female disciple who were in charge of guarding Su Yan were also paying attention to the battle hundreds of kilometres away, but when they finally recovered their wits, they were shocked to find that Su Yan had actually run off. The two women were stunned and hurriedly gave chase while calling out to her.

“Su Yan, if you dare to violate Great Elder’s orders, you will be severely punished!”

“Come back now and you will suffer less, refuse and no one will be able to save you!”

Su Yan turned a deaf ear to their cries, almost as if she had not heard them at all, her body flying off and soon disappearing from the vision of the two women.

“This is bad!” Zhou Yun Xuan’s face went pale. No matter what, for failing to fulfil their duties, they would certainly be punished by the Great Elder.

“This bitch really irritates me!” The short woman grit her teeth and cursed, “Senior Sister Zhou, what should we do now?”

“Follow her,” Zhou Yun Xuan stomped and increased her speed.

Laughter resounded like a rolling thunder throughout Pure Ice Island as Yang Kai, still surrounded by the power of the Sect Defending Array, moved about freely, waving his sword madly as he shattered Ran Yun Ting’s attacks to pieces.

Ran Yun Ting’s expression was incredibly fierce as her eyes filled with shock and disbelief.

[Just how extraordinary was this young man?]

With a mere Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation, he was able to suppress her even while she was using part of the Pure Ice Grand Array’s power!

She originally thought that in the Origin Returning Realm, she was already one the strongest, with few in this realm being capable of comparing with her, but today, she thoroughly understood that there are mountains beyond mountains and people beyond people!

[This young man is already capable of such phenomenal strength. If he were to break through to the Third-Order Origin Realm, won’t he be capable of battling an ordinary Origin King?]

Once this thought emerged, Ran Yun Ting was taken aback!

While frightened, her determination to kill Yang Kai here and now increased dramatically.

If he did not die here today, Ice Heart Valley would definitely suffer greatly in the future!

“Ice Heart Valley’s Great Elder, is mediocre!” Yang Kai snorted in a deep voice, not putting Ran Yun Ting in his eyes, holding the sword in his left hand, he stretched out his right hand, condensed a new golden sword in it, and shouted in a low tone, “Pierce!”

A golden light flashed and a sharp sword light shot towards Ran Yun Ting, threatening to run her through in the next moment!

No matter how much Ran Yun Ting urged the power of the Pure Ice Grand Array, she was unable to stop this golden sword from reaching her.

For a moment, Ran Yun Ting’s face turned ashen and her eyes shrank.

She did not realize until this moment that Yang Kai bowing to her before was truly not because of fear, but was his final gesture of respect, severing the fate between her and Su Yan and him.

With these connections severed, he could kill her without hesitation.

If one were to ask Ran Yun Ting if she had any regrets, she would answer with a firm ‘No!’

Ran Yun Ting’s eyes became firm again a moment later. Even if she died here, she would not regret her decision.

Su Yan would eventually become the pillar of Ice Heart Valley, and whether Ice Heart Valley could continue on and eventually overpower Brilliant Flame Sect to become the most powerful great force on Scarlet Wave Star all depended on Su Yan’s ability.

She may die here today but killing the Ice Heart Valley Great Elder was no small matter. Once the Supreme Elder became aware and took action, Yang Kai would certainly die.

As long as Yang Kai died, the flaw in Su Yan’s heart could be solved and she would be able to put her all into cultivating and raising her strength!

Her light was bound to shine across the entire Star Field, and in the future, she would be able to stand atop the submit!

No matter how amazing this young man might seem now, he would eventually be overtaken and surpassed by Su Yan.

With death approaching, Ran Yun Ting stood motionless, staring at Yang Kai with a nearly insane smile.

At that moment though, the power of the Pure Ice Grand Array suddenly increased, and where it once had been unable to stop Yang Kai’s golden sword light, it now condensed a mass of ice-cold energy to form a flawless ice wall in front of Ran Yun Ting.

The golden sword light pierced this ice wall and made a terrible screech as it approached Ran Yun Ting little by little.

The ice wall seemed incapable of stopping the golden sword light!

But Yang Kai still frowned and turned to look towards the side.

Over there, Ice Heart Valley’s Valley Master Bing Long had appeared at some unknown point and was also holding a token in her hand, one that was identical to the one Ran Yun Ting was using and was pouring her Saint Qi into it to increase the power of the Pure Ice Grand Array.

Bing Long’s face was extremely dignified as sweat dripped from her forehead while she continued to pour her Saint Qi into her token.

More and more Ice Heart Valley Elders appeared, each of them calling out in shock as they hurriedly took out their tokens one after another.

With so many Ice Heart Valley Elders cooperating, the power of the Pure Ice Grand Array grew exponentially. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

At the last moment, the golden sword light’s advancement was halted a mere palm’s length from Ran Yun Ting.

However, the aura around the golden Sword Qi’s was enough to pierce Ran Yun Ting’s forehead slightly, causing a drop of red blood to leak out from the centre of her brow.
