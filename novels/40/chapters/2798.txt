The corridor in front of Yang Kai was the intermediate space of the fifth layer. It was a place anyone could enter, provided that they found the entrance in the fourth layer.

[No wonder Lei Ting was waiting here. It’s because he expected me to come to the fifth layer.] “Aren’t you going to go and check it out, Brother Lei?” Yang Kai asked, tilting his head and glancing at the dark and deep entrance before them.

“I’m not in a hurry,” Lei Ting replied faintly.

Yang Kai counted with his fingers, “If I remember correctly, the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda will close in just a few days. You won’t get the chance to enter the fifth layer again if you don’t hurry.”

Lei Ting sneered, “That only applies to you.”

He was the nephew of Star Soul Palace’s Great Elder and one of the leading figures of Star Soul Palace’s younger generation. Since the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda was opened once every three years, he could enter as many times as he wanted as long as he was willing. Therefore, he was naturally in no hurry to explore the fifth layer. On the contrary, Yang Kai only obtained this opportunity by chance. If he did not make the most of this opportunity, he might not have another chance to enter the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda again.

“That’s true,” Yang Kai rubbed his chin and smiled brightly, “If that’s the case, I’ll be going on ahead.”

“Where are you going?!” Lei Ting roared. He securely locked Yang Kai in place, his posture seeming to indicate that Yang Kai would suffer grave consequences if he so much as dared to take another step forward.

Yang Kai frowned and said impatiently, “Brother Lei, we have nothing against each other. Why are you being so aggressive?”

Lei Ting sneered, “It’s true that we have nothing against each other, but you are such a rare opponent. How can I let this chance slip away so easily?”

Yang Kai pondered for a moment before glancing at Lei Ting solemnly, “That’s just an excuse, right? The biggest reason is the Princess, right?”

Lei Ting blushed furiously and waved his hand dismissively, “What are you talking about? Please don’t speak nonsense.”

Yang Kai grinned and said, “I can tell that you are deeply in love with the Princess, Brother Lei. You are worried that my appearance will arouse the Princess’s interest, so you want to use force to prove your strength and make the Princess look at you differently.”

Lei Ting looked embarrassed, “Is it that obvious?”

Yang Kai pointed at his eyes and retorted, “It’s not like I’m blind.”

After being called out by Yang Kai, Lei Ting seemed much more at ease. He relaxed his attitude and spoke, “You’re right. Xun’er and I grew up together, but I have never seen her being so passionate towards any man before. You give off a dangerous vibe; I have no choice but to face you seriously.”

A strange light flashed in Yang Kai’s eyes, and he smiled, “It’s an honour you think of me like that, but Brother Lei, you’ve got something wrong …” He shook his head repeatedly while speaking.

Lei Ting was startled, “What did I get wrong?”

Yang Kai replied seriously, “The Princess is beautiful, friendly, and likeable indeed. With the Princess’s status and her high standards, how can she show interest in a man so carelessly? The relationship between a man and a woman isn’t just about mutual feelings, it is also about having the same status in life.”

Lei Ting mulled over those words for a moment and nodded, “En, you’re right.”

Then, Yang Kai continued, “Brother Lei, you should know the Princess’ temper best since you are childhood friends with her. Besides, you are the nephew of Great Elder Lei, who stands above all and answers only to the Great Emperor. Your status just barely matches up to the Princess, so status is not a problem for you. Accordingly, everything else will naturally fall into place as long as you capture her heart since your status is not a problem.”

Lei Ting laughed loudly, “I couldn’t tell previously, but you’re pretty interesting.” His expression turned cold, and the conversation abruptly turned in a different direction, “Do you take me for a fool?! Do you think I’d believe you with just a few words from you?!”

Stunned, Yang Kai sighed, “Brother Lei, oh, Brother Lei… I just wanted to let you know that I am not your enemy. Your enemy is someone else.”

Lei Ting snorted, “Who else could it be?”

Yang Kai blinked, “Who else could it be? It’s Xiao Chen! Brother Lei, don’t tell me you don’t know the saying that ‘it’s easy for a person in a favourable position to gain special advantages’? While we are stuck facing each other here, Brother Xiao is probably sticking right next to the Princess. Moreover, Xiao Chen’s cultivation and status aren’t inferior to yours. I’ve seen Xiao Chen with the Princess several times now. He follows her around and takes care of her carefully. Men and women are different, but feelings grow when they spend a long time together! Let me ask you this, Brother Lei, aren’t you scared of that?”

Lei Ting sneeringly said, “Xiao Chen? Pfft! He is nothing! I can easily kill him off without even breaking a sweat! On the other hand, you… uh… the way Xun’er treats you makes me very uneasy.” He curled his hands into fists while speaking, cracking his knuckles as he approached Yang Kai with a savage smile, “Rest assured, I don’t want your life. I just want to beat you half to death. As long as I deal with you and make you too embarrassed to show yourself in front of Xun’er again, then Xun’er is as good as mine.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his brow and asked sternly, “Brother Lei, don’t you know that a loose tongue may cause a lot of trouble? Are you sure it’s wise to say such irresponsible things?”

Lei Ting pursed his lips, “You don’t need to waste your breath on nonsense! Hurry up and fight me!”

“Oh… So, I’m as good as yours, Senior Brother Lei?” A clear and pleasant voice suddenly called out from behind Lei Ting.

Lei Ting’s fierce complexion instantly stiffened while all the hairs on his body stood on end. At the same time, his fighting spirit was doused as if somebody had poured a basin of cold water over his head.

Gudong…

He gulped nervously, as cold sweat poured profusely down his forehead. Turning his head haltingly, he saw Lan Xun and Xiao Chen standing side by side on the Space Array. The former was watching him indifferently while the latter was smirking, clearly taking pleasure in his misfortune.

“W-When…” Lei Ting was horrified as he felt his heart sinking into the deepest depths of Hell from where it would never recover again. He wailed deep in his heart, [It’s over! It’s over! Everything is over now! Xun’er heard what I said just now! How am I ever going to face her again?!] Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

What shocked him the most was that he had completely failed to notice the two people appearing behind him at some point. If not for that, he would never have made such a huge gaffe.

[It’s this damn Yang Kai! He must have diverted my attention on purpose! I initially thought that he was making some sort of preparation when he began releasing Space Principles just now, but it turned out it was just a way to block my senses!]

“Lei Ting! H-How can you say such things?! Hurry up and apologize to the Princess!” Xiao Chen suddenly shouted sternly with righteous indignation.

Lei Ting instantly blushed bright red and said in a fluster, “I-I…”

Lan Xun raised her chin slightly and stared at him as if waiting for his explanation. Unfortunately, he couldn’t utter a single word at all. He stammered for a long time but in the end, he grit his teeth and stomped his feet before rushing towards the entrance ahead, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

“Get back here immediately, Lei Ting! How dare you leave before you explain yourself?!” Xiao Chen shouted furiously. Despite knowing full well that it was impossible for Lei Ting to return, he still shouted repeatedly; however, the corners of his lips were curled into a subtle arc.

[That takes care of him!] Xiao Chen cheered in his heart before leisurely glancing over at Yang Kai. Xiao Chen was different from Lei Ting. Although Yang Kai threatened his position slightly, he didn’t think much of him in the end as what Yang Kai said before was the truth. It is easy for a person in a favourable position to gain special advantages! Besides, Yang Kai was going to leave Star Soul Palace after this training experience in the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda and might never have another chance to meet with the Princess again, so how could he be considered a threat? Only an idiot like Lei Ting would believe such obvious lies.

“Isn’t that a little cruel…” Yang Kai asked, looking in the direction Lei Ting left and rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

Lan Xun said, “Senior Brother Lei is the one in the wrong here, so you don’t need to worry about it too much, Senior Brother Yang.”

He smiled openly and replied, “En, good. If he can understand the meaning behind what ‘love’ is, then he will surely have greater accomplishments in the future. He can only take this as a test.”

Pursing her mouth, Lan Xun smiled and looked at him with her beautiful and elegant eyes, “Senior Brother Yang, you seem to be speaking from experience.”

Coughing lightly in response, Yang Kai mused, “I just have a little more experience in life.”

Xiao Chen watched coldly from the side. Seeing the two of them getting along so well made his mood turn sour. Thus, he hurriedly jumped into the conversation, “Congratulations on finding the entrance, Brother Yang.”

“It was a lucky coincidence,” Yang Kai smiled slightly. Subsequently, he looked at them suspiciously, “That said; why are the two of you together?”

Xiao Chen smiled faintly, “Fate!”

Upon entering the fourth layer of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, he had searched for Lan Xun continuously. During that period, he had traversed through more than a dozen shattered worlds, finally finding her a few days ago and re-assuming his role as her protector.

Meanwhile, Lan Xun spoke up, “We only have a few more days before the one-month deadline is up while the fifth layer is right in front of us. Do you want to check it out, Senior Brother Yang?”

“Of course!” Yang Kai nodded and added, “I wonder if the fifth layer will be different from the fourth layer.”

She replied, “Of course it will be different!”

“Please explain!” He humbly asked to be enlightened.

There, Xiao Chen interjected, “The space in the fourth layer consists of numerous fragmented worlds, so the World Principles in them are imperfect. On the other hand, the fifth layer, although containing many spaces too, differs from the fourth layer in that it is filled with independent Sealed Worlds!”

“Sealed Worlds!” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows in surprise.

Xiao Chen explained, “That’s right. Those Sealed Worlds were formed from the shattered worlds in the first few layers of the pagoda. When that ancient Senior refined the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, he combined many shattered worlds to form the fourth layer of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda while the complete Sealed Worlds remaining in these shattered worlds were isolated and placed in the fifth layer.”

Yang Kai pondered for a moment and said, “In that case, the Sealed Worlds in the fifth layer may be related to one of the shattered worlds in the fourth layer?”

“That’s right, but it’s not very relevant. There are many kinds of Sealed Worlds in the Fifth layer. They come in many shapes and sizes, similar to the countless shattered worlds in the previous layers. Moreover, what kind of Sealed World you enter is based entirely on your own luck. We don’t get to choose.”

Yang Kai was stunned for a long time before sighing, “The Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda is certainly impressive.”

Before he understood the truth behind the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, he only felt that its existence was of great importance to the Star Soul Palace. Now that he finally understood all the aspects of it, he realized that it was a priceless gem!

All the cultivators across the Star Boundary wished for the chance of obtaining an opportunity in their cultivation journey, and where did opportunities come from? In that aspect, Sealed Worlds were the greatest source.
