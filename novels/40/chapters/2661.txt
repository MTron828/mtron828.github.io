With their Emperor Qi surging, the crowd made a move and the war was joined.

Facing the combined force of more than a dozen Emperor Realm Masters though, Yang Kai did not intend to dodge at all and laughed out loud, causing everyone to stare at him and wonder what was wrong with his head.

However, the arrow had already flown from the string, so there was no turning back even if they sensed something off. Everyone charged towards the Space Ring on Yang Kai’s hand.

In an instant, the dozen people pounced at Yang Kai, unleashing their various skills to attack him ferociously.

“Solidify!” Right after a cold snort, the Space Principles within a hundred-metre radius of Yang Kai pulsed, turning space itself extremely viscous.

The dozen people were aghast at this sudden change and soon found that their Emperor Qi could not circulate smoothly, as if they were trapped in a deep mire, creating an illusion that their movements were being restricted and the power of their attacks was greatly reduced. Even the brilliance of their summoned Emperor Artifacts dimmed.

“What!?” Everyone’s face changed drastically. They were about to retreat as soon as they noticed the oddity of the situation, but it was already too late.

Yang Kai lifted his both hands and caused the entire sky to be overcast by a shadow of two gigantic palms which swiftly blasted forward.

Following an explosion, the dozen people were thrown out, all of them spurting blood in the mid-air, their faces as pale as a sheet.

*Pa pa pa… *

The dozen Emperor Realm Masters fell on the ground like dumplings, and when they regained their composure, all of them looked ashen and horrified.

On the other side, Yang Kai seemed to also have spent tremendous energy to repel so many Emperor Realm Masters in one strike. He shuddered slightly, but he did not retreat a single step, and despite his face being a little pale at first, he quickly recovered.

Nevertheless, he still stood tall in front of the gates, like an immovable mountain, guarding this piece of treasured land.

“How is that possible?!”

“Is he really just a First-Order Emperor Realm Master?”

“How did he do that?”

…..

A dizzying sensation gushed out in the hearts of the dozen Emperor Realm Masters, as if they were caught in some kind of bad dream.

Yang Kai looked young and always gave the impression that he did not have very high cultivation. Therefore, even though they did not fully understand his capabilities at first, they did not put him in their eyes. Nevertheless, they found out about Yang Kai’s cultivation as he revealed it with his earlier move.

He was indeed a First-Order Emperor Realm Master, so logically, he should be weaker than them.

However, this First-Order Emperor Realm Master had resolved the combined force of a dozen Masters and even inflicted a certain degree of injury on them in a head-on confrontation.

No one would believe it if they did not experience it themselves. It was simply that absurd.

Especially Li Qing Yuan, who was a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master and had been in the Northern Territory for so many years. He had never encountered such a bizarre situation. He had faced many First-Order Emperor Realm Masters throughout his life, and would usually crush them with overwhelming power, but none of them was as fierce as the young man in front of him.

The greed in his eyes gradually converged, replaced by infinite solemnity.

It was rumoured that some geniuses in the Martial Dao could fight and even kill those with higher cultivations than themselves. Li Qing Yuan met this kind of talent before too, but those so-called geniuses, at most, could only fight evenly with him while being a single Minor Realm lower in cultivation. Compared with the young man in front of him, all those so-called talents were mediocre at best.

Not only could the young man in front of him fight against opponents above his realm, but he did not even fall into a disadvantage facing a dozen people with equal or higher cultivations than his own at once.

Li Qing Yuan even suspected that the young man had not used his full strength, and if he had, perhaps only half of them would still be alive now!

Thinking of this, cold sweat beaded on Li Qing Yuan’s forehead.

If this young man was already this powerful as a First-Order Emperor, wouldn’t he be invincible when he broke through to the Second-Order or Third-Order Emperor Realm? Perhaps at that time, only the Great Emperors would be a match for him.

“Little brat, who the hell are you!?”

Someone cried bitterly, as if they refused to believe the fact that they were repelled and demanded to know what deceitful tricks Yang Kai had used.

Everyone wanted to ask the same question too. Such a brilliant rising star couldn’t be some obscure individual. They should have at least heard of his name somewhere.

Yang Kai turned to that person, and grinned, “This Young Master is Yang Kai. I believe you’ve all heard my name before, yes?”

“Ahh… Is he THAT Yang Kai?”

“The Yang Kai who killed Feng Xi in the Shattered Star Sea and provoked Feng Xuan?”

“The war between Ice Heart Valley and Seeking Passion Sect started because of him!”

“I heard that the annihilation of the entire Seeking Passion Sect was also the result of his interference! He found some kind of strong support out of nowhere and killed Feng Xuan, Yao Zhuo, and all the others in one breath!”

Thanks to Feng Xuan’s publicity campaign, Yang Kai was quite well-known in the Northern Territory; after all, a war between two top Sects was a serious matter. The Seeking Passion Sect would not send out its warriors without reason, and the reason they gave for attacking Ice Heart Valley was that Yang Kai had killed Feng Xi while Bing Yun shielded him.

Before that, the Northern Territory cultivators were incredibly curious about this young man named Yang Kai. They could not believe that he had the courage to kill Feng Xi and also thought that this guy would not have a good end as a result.

But beyond everyone’s expectations, the Seeking Passion Sect was the one to be exterminated, and now the initiator of the whole tragedy actually came to Seeking Passion Sect’s headquarters to establish his own Sect, like the magpie seizing a nest, attempting to create his so-called High Heaven Palace!

If the Seeking Passion Great Emperor learned of this, he would probably be so furious that he would jump out of his coffin.

For a moment, it was dead silent outside the Sect gates. Whether it was the dozen Emperor Realm Masters, or the thousand or so cultivators spectating, all just stared at Yang Kai in shock.

*Shua shua shua… *

Several noises broke the silence, followed by three figures suddenly appearing behind Yang Kai. As soon as these three figures emerged, they unleashed a fearsome pressure. The weight of this pressure seemed to darken the whole world and a dreadful look was etched onto everyone’s faces as they felt it difficult to even breathe. It was as if their chests were being crushed by giant mountains.

Everyone looked at the three figures intently, their eyes quivering in fear.

Although they could not see the three figures clearly, the dominant pressure was telling them that these three would only need a wave of their hands to slaughter everyone here.

A cold sensation instantly rushed from the soles of the crowd’s feet to the top of their heads. The blood drained from the faces of the thousand people as if their parents had just died. They wanted to escape immediately, but they dared not move, so they could only just stand still and endure the torment.

“Young Master Yang, what happened? It seemed like a fight just took place?” Xie Wu Wei frowned as he asked.

“Hmph, it seems like someone was being rude here.” While speaking, Ying Fei swept his falcon eyes across the dozen Emperor Realm Masters in a threatening manner.

“How daring. Who caused the trouble? Let this Old Rhino deal with him!” Xi Lei yelled, his Monster Qi pulsing, whipping up a monstrous wind, as if it could puncture a hole in the sky.

“Monster Race!” Someone sensed the Monster Qi and exclaimed.

“Monster King!” Li Qing Yuan cried out grievously, cold sweat pouring down his face like droplets of rain as he turned as pale as a sheet.

Although he was a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master, he instinctively felt terrified because he was powerless in front of a Monster King who was on par with a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master. Moreover, if he was not mistaken, the other two Masters who appeared should also be from the Monster Race, and were likely Monster Kings themselves.

[Damn it! It’s rarer to encounter a single Monster King than it is to see a Third-Order Emperor! But today, there are three Monster Kings together!] Li Qing Yuan did not know whether he was fortunate or he should be grieving, but when he thought of what happened before, he felt that it was more likely to be the latter.

The dozen Emperor Realm Masters and the thousand spectating cultivators took one step back simultaneously at Li Qing Yuan’s remark about Xi Lei, and gazed at the latter in horror. It was as if Xi Lei was the reaper of death, just waiting to harvest their lives.

“Who was being rude here just now? Show yourself to this King!” Xi Lei roared like thunder, staring at the crowd menacingly.

No one dared to answer him as they all feared being targeted by him and dying. Nervous gulps could be heard one after another as everyone’s feet felt nailed to the ground.

The Emperor Realm Masters turned their gazes at Li Qing Yuan, hoping that he could stand out and speak some words to this Monster King for them.

Li Qing Yuan secretly scolded this group of cowards in his heart, but at this point, considering the consequences of him keeping quiet might be worse, he called out, “Sir Monster King, it’s just a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding!”

“A misunderstanding?” Xi Lei looked at Li Qing Yuan sideways and snorted, “How is it a misunderstanding?”

Li Qing Yuan racked his brain to think of an explanation, quickly coming up with an excuse as he blurted out, “It’s like this, we are all Northern Territory cultivators and heard that Young Master Yang Kai established a Sect here, so we came to congratulate him, but we failed to recognize Young Master Yang with our unworthy eyes and inadvertently offended him a little. We ask for forgiveness from Young Master Yang and all the Sirs here.”

Li Qing Yuan expressed his excuses eloquently, even feeling quite proud of his quick wit.

“Established a Sect?” Xi Lei was stunned and glanced at Yang Kai with inquiry. Although he did mention this idea a few days ago, Yang Kai did not give any affirmation, so he did not understand why Li Qing Yuan suddenly could speak of this matter.

Ying Fei’s eyes were sharper though and quickly saw the Ten Thousand Year Frozen Heart Iron standing to the side and applauded, “Young Master Yang really has established a Sect here. High Heaven Palace, en, to have the ambition to reach the peak as high as the Heavens. Good!”

Xie Wu Wei laughed merrily, “Good, good. Then from now on, this Xie will stay in High Heaven Palace and hopes that Young Master Yang will reward me with the position of Protector or Deacon or anything.”

“Count this Old Rhino in!” Xi Lei retracted his vicious aura and turned a fawning smile to Yang Kai, “Young Master Yang must definitely treat us well.”

Ying Fei nodded in agreement, “This Ying thinks so too.”

The dozen Emperor Realm Masters almost fainted listening to their words, while the thousand cultivators dropped their jaws, their eyes widened in disbelief as they started to doubt their own ears.

These three were Monster Kings, Masters on par with Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters! But now that Yang Kai marked this place as his territory and engraved the signboard of his Sect, these three Masters all scrambled to join him even though he had not officially established his Sect yet.

Furthermore, they actually begged for some position like a Protector or even a Deacon…

What was wrong with this world? Throughout the Star Boundary, which Third-Order Emperor Realm Master was not an overlord? Which one of them was not a Master of generations of men? With such a strength, one could establish his or her own Sect with ease, but now, these three Monster Kings actually seemed desperate to join the not-even-officially-established High Heaven Palace?

Who the hell was this Yang Kai and how did he manage to tame these three Monster Kings?nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
