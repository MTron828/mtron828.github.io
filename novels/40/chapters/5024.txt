The creation of the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors stemmed from an idea that suddenly sprang into Yang Kai’s head many years ago. It was also a result of his years of cultivation in the Dao of Space.

The Void Yin-Yang Mirrors consisted of two sets. One of them was Yin while the other was Yang. Just like the two sides of a mirror, each one of them was indispensable. Once set up at an appropriate distance, activating them would be akin to flipping a mirror around, swapping the Yin and Yang Mirrors. By doing so, Yang Kai could transfer whatever was bound within the confines of the mirrors to a distant place.

The environment in Black Territory was too hostile, so the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors were tailored to its unique conditions. After all the Ore Stars in Black Territory were fully extracted, Yang Kai thought that there wouldn’t be a need for the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors anymore, and certainly never expected that he would need them again on the Black Ink Battlefield.

This came as a surprise to him.

Since he had set up Void Yang Mirrors on the other side, he naturally had to arrange the Void Yin Mirrors near Blue Sky Pass.

One hour later, he was done with arranging all eight Void Yin Mirrors.

Zhong Liang observed silently and could recognize the abstrusity of the eight artifacts that had been placed at eight different coordinates. While he was pondering on who made these artifacts and what their uses were, he saw Yang Kai withdraw and then form a hand seal. The next moment, Yang Kai shouted, “Invert!”

As soon as he spoke, the eight artifacts lit up and started buzzing. Following that, the Void around these eight artifacts started contorting.

A violent fluctuation of Space Principles burst forth.

Zhong Liang arched his brow as he had a feeling that it was the critical moment, so he focused and observed intently. Soon, he became surprised because he could feel a weak fluctuation coming from a distant place, resonating with the eight artifacts in front of him.

This wasn’t an illusion, for the resonance became increasingly stronger until it could not be more obvious.

Then came the moment when Zhong Liang widened his eyes and stared at the scene in front of him in shock.

The space that had been surrounded by the eight artifacts was initially empty, but at this moment, a faint but gigantic image appeared inside it in an abrupt manner.

He almost thought that he was seeing an illusion, but upon closer inspection, he confirmed that there was indeed a colossal figure in front of him, and it was becoming increasingly solidified.

After ten more breaths, the figure fully materialised. The lights around the eight artifacts went out, and the resonance with the faraway place was cut off.

Zhong Liang widened his eyes as he almost bit his tongue as his jaw flapped open and closed. He had never been more flabbergasted in his life.

As an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he had lived for a long time and dealt with the Black Ink Clan on the Black Ink Battlefield for countless years. He could be considered an experienced and worldly person, but he had never seen anything like what Yang Kai had just achieved before.

The thing that abruptly appeared in front of him was an entire Universe World, one so huge that the massive Blue Sky Pass was less than 10% of its size.

Even though it was dead and devoid of any vitality, it was indeed a Universe World.

*Shua shua shua…*

Several figures approached them rapidly from Blue Sky Pass, all of them Eighth-Order Masters. They must have come over to look into the matter upon realising the anomaly in this place. In an instant, everyone in Blue Sky Pass became alert and were ready to fight.

Eastern Army Commander Ding Yao appeared beside Zhong Liang and asked in a grim voice, “What’s going on?”

Northern Army Commander Shen Tu Mo also asked, “Why is there a Universe World here?”

It was inconceivable that a Universe World had abruptly appeared in front of their place, so they had to find out the reason behind it.

Faced with the inquisitive gazes, Zhong Liang put on a helpless smile, not knowing how to explain it. Moreover, he was also clueless about it. Even though he had some speculations, he couldn’t be certain, so he simply shouted, “Yang Boy, come over and explain it to them!”

“Coming!” Yang Kai replied and flew over. Upon arriving, he saluted these people, “Greetings, Sirs.”

Zhong Liang waved his hand, “Cut to the chase. What has just happened?”

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “It’s just like what you all see. Four hours ago, this Universe World was still in the resource harvesting area around the fourth forward base. Now, I’ve used a certain trick and moved it here.” He then sported a solemn expression, “This is what I was thinking. Rather than letting the people at the forward bases take the risk of extracting resources, why don’t we move all the Universe Worlds to somewhere near Blue Sky Pass? This way, everyone here can help with the mining. The efficiency and the safety would be improved significantly.”

Southern Army Commander Liang Yu Long widened his eyes upon hearing that and asked, “You said you moved this Universe World here using some kind of trick, and it only took you four hours to do it?”

Yang Kai replied, “Strictly speaking, it only took me half an hour. The other three and a half hours were for making the arrangements.”

With his eyes brightening, Ding Yao took a step forward, “Are you serious?”

Yang Kai pointed at Zhong Liang, “Sir Zhong witnessed everything.”

All of them turned to look at Zhong Liang, who nodded sincerely, “En, I saw the entire process. Don’t ask me how he did it though, I have no idea what trick this little brat used. I only know that it involved a set of artifacts.”

The next moment, Yang Kai waved his hand as all eight artifacts turned into rays of light and came to him from different directions. They were then displayed in front of everyone.

All of these Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters curiously examined the artifacts.

Yang Kai explained, “These are just half of the artifacts involved. The other half are in the original location of this Universe World. I call it the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors.”

He then explained to them the uses of Void Yin-Yang Mirrors.

The eyes of these Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters lit up as Shen Tu Mo praised him by saying, “Such a wonderful treasure!”

An interested Ding Yao asked, “So, by just using these Void Yin-Yang Mirrors, we can move the Universe Worlds from the resource harvesting area to here. Am I right?”

With a serious expression, Yang Kai nodded, “Yes.”

All of them were astonished. If that was the case, their people no longer had to go out to extract resources. They could just send all the Universe Worlds back to Blue Sky Pass and let the people from the Inner Sanctum mine them freely. Just like Yang Kai had said, the efficiency and safety would be significantly improved by doing so.

Even though this treasure couldn’t be used to deal with enemies directly, it would contribute greatly to the Humans on the Black Ink Battlefield.

Zhong Liang directly landed a slap on the back of Yang Kai’s head as he snapped, “Why didn’t you take these things out sooner?”

A helpless Yang Kai replied, “The idea didn’t come to me until just now.” Up until now, he had been locked in a number of intense battles with the Black Ink Clan, so he hadn’t had time to think about it. It wasn’t until he arrived at the resource harvesting area that he recalled this treasure.

Ding Yao remarked, “Even though this treasure is wonderful, there’s a big potential issue with them.”

Zhong Liang turned to look at him, “What do you mean?”

Ding Yao stared hard at Yang Kai, “Are you the only one who can activate these Void Yin-Yang Mirrors? Or can anyone who is strong enough use them?”

If it was the former, the treasure would still be useful, but only in a limited sense. If it was the latter, it would be wonderful news for all the Humans on the Black Ink Battlefield.

Yang Kai replied hesitantly, “I’m the only one who has used these since they were first created. Although I believe that others can use them as well, we would need to experiment with them.”

Ding Yao immediately turned to gaze to Shen Tu Mo, “The Purifying Black Ink Battleship at the fourth forward base belongs to the Northern Army, right?”

Shen Tu Mo nodded, “Yes. I’ll head over there with Yang Boy and give it a try now.”

Ding Yao nodded, “En, many thanks, Brother Shen Tu.”

Shen Tu Mo waved his hand, “It is the least I can do. It’s not like it’s difficult to go there.” He then turned to Yang Kai, “Brat, get back there and set things up. I’ll come over as soon as everything’s ready.”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai cupped his fist, “I’ll be waiting for you, Senior Shen Tu.”

Having said so, Yang Kai stored the eight Void Yang Mirrors and activated the Universe Transference Law, soon disappearing from the spot. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

After he was gone, Shen Tu Mo also activated the Universe Transference Law and headed to the Purifying Black Ink Battleship at the fourth forward base.

Zhong Liang took a glance at the Universe World and tutted, “That Brat sure has a lot of weird tricks up his sleeve!”

Certainly, Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters like them could also move such a Universe World back from a faraway place, but they would have to spend a lot of time and effort to do so.

On the other hand, Yang Kai had managed to easily achieve it with that strange treasure of his.

Ding Yao nodded, “Isn’t it wonderful that he has a lot of tricks up his sleeve? It’s good news for the Humans that he has many different skills. Since his arrival at Blue Sky Pass, the status quo has changed for the better for us Humans.”

In the past, Purifying Light, Purifying Black Ink Battleships, and Universe Arrays were unimaginable to the Humans in the Great Passes as they didn’t have access to them; however, Yang Kai managed to bring all those things on his own. If the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors could be popularised as well, the contribution would be far greater than killing one or two Territory Lords.

In the meantime, Yang Kai stepped out of the cabin of Dawning Light and headed straight to the location where the Void Yin Mirrors were placed.

He soon found Feng Ying.

Presently, Feng Ying was dazedly staring ahead and scanning the surroundings with her Divine Sense, as though she was trying to find something that should have been there.

Upon seeing Yang Kai, she quickly said, “Junior Brother, the Universe World disappeared.”

Just a short time ago, the eight artifacts left behind by Yang Kai lit up and began humming, after which the entire Universe World faded. There came a moment when the Universe World abruptly disappeared from her sight.

That astounded Feng Ying, for such a big Universe World was gone just like that. She thought that she was seeing an illusion, or that Yang Kai had set up some kind of strange Array to hide it from her; however, regardless of how hard she scanned the surroundings, she was unable to find a trace of the Universe World.

It was only then that she confirmed that the Universe World had really disappeared.

Nevertheless, she couldn’t figure out how the Universe World had vanished all of a sudden or where it was now.

Yang Kai nodded, “Don’t worry about it, Senior Sister. I sent that Universe World back to Blue Sky Pass.”

Feng Yin’s jaw dropped and her eyes bulged. Disbelief was written all over her face.

Yang Kai went on to say with a smile, “This is what I told you about earlier. Since it was a success, we no longer have to stay here to mine resources.”
