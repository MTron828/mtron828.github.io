Chapter 5529: Do Your Consciences Not Hurt At All?

“Report!”

Following a shout, a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm soldier ran into the Main Hall and cupped his fist at Xiang Shan, “The Black Ink Clan Army has been sighted advancing from 10 million kilometres outside the eastern front. They appear to be rallying for another attack.”

Under normal circumstances, there wouldn’t be anyone barging into the higher-ups’ conference, but an urgent military situation was an exception.

Obviously, the Black Ink Clan on the eastern front pressing in on them was an urgent military situation.

“Bold!” Wei Jun Yang bellowed, “Those Black Ink Clansmen must be courting death!”

While he spoke, he exuded his majestic Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm aura.

Ou Yang Lie also exclaimed, “It seems like they haven’t learnt their lesson yet.”

…..

Not only were these two cursing the Black Ink Clan, but the other Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters all joined in, causing the Main Conference Hall to instantly fill with all kinds of voices.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai frowned, [What is the Black Ink Clan up to? They have just lost a major battle and three Territory Lords. How could they come back for another attack after such a short amount of time?]

Looking back at the Seventh-Order soldier who came to report the news, Yang Kai could see that he was from Great Battle Heaven because he was wearing distinctive golden armour. Undried blood still marred his armour, which seemed to indicate that he was injured.

What caught Yang Kai’s attention though was that the other Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters of Profound Nether Army were too calm.

[Since the Black Ink Clan Army are rallying to attack, shouldn’t they be discussing a plan of action and dispatching troops to consolidate the eastern front? It’s highly improper of them to just be acting loud and rowdy at this moment.]

While he was lost in such thought, one of the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters came forward and cupped his fist to Xiang Shan before saying, “Sir Xiang, I request permission to fight off the enemy!”

Xiang Shan nodded lightly, “It’s rare for you, Division Commander Chen, to be so eager to fight. You have my permission. How many troops are you preparing to bring with you?”

Division Commander Chen answered proudly, “I don’t need much. A single Division will suffice.”

Then, Xiang Shan warned sternly, “The war between the two Races is not child’s play.”

After coldly snorting, Division Commander Chen replied, “It’s just a motley group of weak Black Ink Clansmen, what’s there to be afraid of? If we don’t deter the enemy, this Chen will offer his head up to you!”

“Good!” Xiang Shan nodded unceasingly to show his approval, “Although we Humans are at a disadvantage, we do not lack the thirst for blood and bravery. Division Commander Chen is still so enthusiastic at such an old age. You are a role model to all of us. Therefore, I’ll permit—”

“Wait a moment!” Yang Kai hurriedly interjected.

He was beyond shocked as he listened to this conversation.

[In such an urgent situation, you old Eighth-Order Masters made a snap decision just like that, and Xiang Shan actually agreed to it? What about the difference between the enemy’s Army and ours? What about the number of enemies coming over? With such a lack of information, how could you reach a decision so quickly?]

More importantly, Yang Kai knew Division Commander Chen personally. In regards to age, he was one of the eldest Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, but when it came to power, he wasn’t the strongest and would not stand a chance against an Innate Territory Lord.

Under such circumstances, how could this old man have the confidence to say he would only bring a single Division out to fight the enemy?

Was he just bluffing? However, the other Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters showed no signs of wanting to stop him.

“Yang Kai, do you have something to say?” Xiang Shan turned around to look at Yang Kai.

Feeling his head pulsing, Yang Kai cupped his fist and suggested, “Senior Xiang, if I remember correctly, the number of soldiers in a single Division of the Profound Nether Army is about 20,000, right?”

20,000 Open Heaven Realm Masters was no small number.

One had to know that back at the Black Ink Battlefield, a Division only had 500 to 600 troops. However, all the Open Heaven Realm Masters on the Black Ink Battlefield were Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters and above.

The Profound Nether Army even had soldiers in the First and Second-Order Open Heaven Realm, so when comparing the two types of Divisions, although 20,000 soldiers was a lot more than 500, the overall difference in strength wasn’t that large.

“Indeed,” Division Commander Chen nodded, “My Division now has 23,651 soldiers enlisted in it.”

Though the old man was up there in age, his memory had not deteriorated and he knew his troops like the back of his hand.

Feeling speechless, Yang Kai looked at him and asked, “Do you know how many troops the Black Ink Clan has brought over to attack us?”

Division Commander Chen snorted coldly, “Who cares how many troops they have? We will kill them all!”

Once he said that, he didn’t even wait for Yang Kai to respond before cupping his fist to Xiang Shan and announcing, “Sir, this Chen will be off then. This mission to defend our homeland will either end with victory or us dying in battle. If the situation comes to that, I would have to trouble all of you to help us gather our corpses.”

Nodding, Xiang Shan promised, “We won’t let our soldiers’ corpses rot in the wilderness.”

“Division Commander Chen, please wait!” Yang Kai shouted again. He couldn’t let Division Commander Chen run away because the Squad his Wives were in just happened to be under Division Commander Chen’s jurisdiction. It wouldn’t matter to Yang Kai if Division Commander Chen decided to deploy in force to push back the enemy, but if he was going with his Division alone, Ru Meng, Su Yan, and the others would get dispatched too.

“Yang Kai, how dare you continuously interrupt us when we’re discussing sending troops to defend our frontlines! Are you trying to disrupt military order?”

Yang Kai’s heart clenched as he quickly cupped his fist, “I dare not do such a thing! But…”

“But what?” Xiang Shan looked at him coldly.

[But… something isn’t right here…]

Yang Kai looked at Xiang Shan and then at the other Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters around him. What he saw was Wei Jun Yang looking up at the sky as if nothing concerned him, while Ou Yang Lie was looking down at the floor as if a flower was growing between his feet. Meanwhile, the other Eighth-Order Masters were either huddled together and discussing something or sitting there calmly with their eyes closed as if everything was under control.

At that moment, Yang Kai failed to stifle his laughter, [So, this is how it is.]

He knew these Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters had all fought in no less than 1,000 battles, so there was no way they would act this foolishly under normal circumstances. Even if Division Commander Chen was a reckless glory-seeker, it was impossible for the rest of them to just let him race off to his death.

Moreover, Xiang Shan was a man with incredible tactical insight. The strategy he came up with to reclaim Great Evolution Pass, and the skill with which he executed it were both extremely shocking, so it was impossible for him to immediately agree when Division Commander Chen asked to lead a single Division off into battle with no idea about the enemy’s composition.

If he did, he wouldn’t be Xiang Shan but someone like Ou Yang Lie.

After sighing, Yang Kai explained, “Senior Brothers, you have all lived for thousands or even tens of thousands of years, do your consciences not hurt at all, working together to trick a Junior like me?”

Snorting, Division Commander Chen insisted, “Junior Brother, whatever do you mean? I’m getting on in years and my mind is not quite what it used to be, please speak plainly.”

Yang Kai gave him a sorrowful look, [You’re clearly the most enthusiastic one in this plan!]

Meanwhile, Xiang Shan still had the same cold expression, “Speak up if you have something you want to say, stop wasting time with all this nonsense.”

[Haven’t I made myself clear enough? It’s you old farts that are playing dumb! I guess it’s true when they say the older a person, the more cunning they are! Judging from this situation, the eastern front… probably isn’t under threat at all. It’s only been about 10 days since the Black Ink Clan suffered serious losses, they wouldn’t dare launch a full offensive so soon.]

This was all just a big show. The Eighth-Order Masters in this room and even the Seventh-Order soldier who came to deliver the ‘report’ were all in on this matter. They were acting out a play with Yang Kai as the only audience member.

[These old farts are obviously trying to force me to do something I’m incapable of. It’s a fake emergency this time, but what about next time? If there really is a next time, this Division Commander Chen will definitely lead his Division to charge the enemy!]

Yang Kai sighed internally. It seemed he couldn’t avoid this matter.

While he was lost in his thoughts, the Seventh-Order soldier shouted again in a voice filled with grief and anger, “Sirs, this situation is urgent, please come to a decision as soon as possible; otherwise, the eastern front might not be able to hold.

*Cough! Cough!*

Then, he spat out a mouthful of blood, seeming to be heavily injured.

[Really? Really??]

Yang Kai glanced at the soldier who was looking straight ahead and had a pale complexion and a depressed aura.

Xiang Shan glared and muttered, “Yang Kai, stand down. Since you don’t want to be appointed as the Army Commander, you have no right to speak here. Division Commander Chen, head back and lead your Division to reinforce the eastern front. If you cannot defeat the enemy, I’ll head over there and behead you myself!”

While cupping his fist, Division Commander Chen replied, “This Chen accepts the order. We will not let you down.”

After that, he turned around and strode towards the door, but he still stared into Yang Kai’s eyes, seeming to say, “If you don’t speak up, this Old Master will really lead my force into battle. It doesn’t matter if there were no enemies at the eastern front this time, because there were enemies in the Black Ink Clan’s camp. Are you afraid now?”

“How could this Junior be qualified for this…” Yang Kai smiled bitterly. However, he was honestly quite touched inside. All these Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters had worked together with Xiang Shan to act out such a performance for him just so that he would take up the position of the Profound Nether Army’s Army Commander. This was a kind of wholehearted trust that was rare to see.

Taking a deep breath, Yang Kai cupped his fist and boomed, “Since all of you Senior Brothers think so highly of me, this Junior is willing to take up the position of Army Commander and guard Profound Nether Territory. This Junior will risk his life to make sure Profound Nether Territory is never lost!”

“So you’ve changed your mind?” Xiang Shan’s lips curled up ever so slightly as he teased.

While looking at him with a blank stare, Yang Kai didn’t say anything.

[Do I have a choice? Old Man Chen is halfway out of the Main Conference Hall, so if I don’t change my mind, he will really leave. His leaving is not that concerning, but my Wives will definitely have to follow him to the battlefield.]

Then, Xiang Shan stopped playing with him and spoke sternly, “Overseeing Profound Nether Territory is a very heavy task. If this Territory is lost on your watch, you’ll be punished according to military law!”

“Understood!”

“Yang Kai, receive your orders!” Xiang Shan roared before taking out a token, “The Supreme Headquarters hereby appoints Yang Kai as Army Commander of the Profound Nether Army. This is the Army Commander Token. With this, you will assume full command of all soldiers in the Profound Nether Army. If anyone dares to disobey or rebel against you, they will be sentenced to death without exception!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“We accept the order!” All the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters bowed in unison.

“Yang Kai accepts the order!” Yang Kai came forward and raised both hands to receive the Profound Nether Army’s Army Commander Token, which suddenly felt quite heavy.

This wasn’t just a token, it was a physical representation of the lives of hundreds of thousands of soldiers that were being entrusted to him.

At that moment, Yang Kai’s aura seemed to have changed and become even more profound and mysterious.

Noticing this, Xiang Shan watched with amazement as the words ‘Heaven’s Will’ appeared in his head.

“Greetings, Army Commander!” Wei Jun Yang chuckled and cupped his fist before bowing. The other Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters copied him and did the same. The atmosphere inside the Main Hall was very harmonious.

Division Commander Chen ran back as well and no longer shouted about racing off to kill the enemy.

Of course, Yang Kai wouldn’t take what happened just now to heart and exchanged pleasantries with the other Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. He would be overseeing Profound Nether Territory in the future, so he would need these old foxes’ help.

“Report!”

Another Seventh-Order soldier dashed into the Main Hall and cupped his fist, “Sirs, there is news from the eastern front. The Black Ink Clan Army has retreated. It seems like their previous actions were just a feint. There is no imminent attack.”

Nodding, Xiang Shan replied, “It’s good that the Black Ink Clan has retreated. Division Commander Chen, you may take a rest as well.”

Division Commander Chen laughed, “The Black Ink Clan retreated before the news about Junior Brother Yang taking up the position as Army Commander was released. It seems like the Heavens are siding with us today.”

The group of Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters all nodded in agreement.

Yang Kai looked around and couldn’t help rolling his eyes. Were these old farts still acting even now? They even organized this kind of closing scene to their play! It seemed they really made a full and detailed plan for today.
