After a long bout of drinking, many bottles of wine had been exhausted. Countless people collapsed to the ground as loud snoring could be heard in the square.

Normally, cultivators wouldn’t get drunk by drinking wine. They could just circulate their Secret Arts and let their Qi disperse the effects of alcohol. However, it was time for celebration, so they were all feeling joyous and wouldn’t do such a thing to dampen the mood.

They kept waking up, drinking, getting drunk and sleeping as though they were in an infinite loop. Thousands of cultivators walked around and clinked glasses with each other as they pushed their worries to the back of their minds. At this moment, they were all elated as they were set on becoming totally wasted.

In the main hall, Yang Kai was seated in the main seat as toasts were proposed to him one by one. He wouldn’t reject any one of them as he gulped down the wine, showing enough respect to his guests, thereby livening up this celebration-cum-welcome-back party.

After the Seniors were done drinking with Yang Kai, it was the younger generations’ turn.

Yang Kai wasn’t so familiar with the older cultivators, but he had more or less come into contact with these young ones before.

The married couple Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er from Shadow Moon Hall, Dai Yuan and Yin Su Die from Coloured Glass Sect, Shen Shi Tao and Lu Ying from Clear Sky Sect, had all gone through life-or-death moments with Yang Kai, so they were on good terms.

However, during this reunion after several dozen years, there seemed to be a kind of barrier between them, so they were not as close to each other as before. This barrier was caused by the difference in their realms.

The difference in their cultivation and status made them unable to look at Yang Kai in the same light as several dozen years ago. There seemed to be an invisible layer of restraint between them.

A person would always get to know new friends and companions in his cultivation journey; however, as one forged onwards, when they looked back, they would realise that they could no longer see many of those familiar figures from the past.

Nevertheless, precious memories would always be kept in the deepest part of their hearts. Whenever they thought about it, they would be able to put on a proud smile. [Look, this powerful man once ran alongside me as I climbed the Martial Dao. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to keep up with him, so I was soon left behind. Nevertheless, I’ll never forget this experience. I’m sure both of us will remember the time we spent together.]

“Sect Master, let me propose a toast to you. If it weren’t for you, I would’ve lost my life. The reason I’ve even achieved such success is thanks to you, so I’m eternally grateful to you.”

Gazing at the woman before his eyes, Yang Kai smiled faintly and gulped down the wine before saying, “Yun’er is doing well now.”

Huang Juan’s body shook as she looked dazedly at Yang Kai.

“I just met her some time ago. She has come of age, so she’s looking like an adult now.” Yang Kai spoke in a small voice, but he was the centre of attention, so the moment he started speaking, the hall immediately fell into silence as they listened to him intentionally or otherwise.

“She’s grown up…” Huang Juan’s gaze appeared longing, as though she was trying to imagine what the little girl, who was reluctant to leave her in the past, looked like now that she had grown up. In fact, Lin Yun’er wasn’t her biological daughter, but rather the daughter of a married couple who were Huang Juan’s good friends. After the couple was killed in an accident, Huang Juan took in Lin Yun’er and regarded her as her own daughter. After they came across Yang Kai, he brought them back with him to enter High Heaven Sect. Soon after though, Lin Yun’er was taken away by Yang Yan.

Huang Juan covered her mouth and uttered, “I’m glad that she’s safe.” Her tears were already sliding down her face, and no matter how hard she tried to wipe them, they just wouldn’t stop streaming out of her eyes. She was on her own, so she was most concerned about Lin Yun’er. However, in this kind of atmosphere, it wasn’t inappropriate for her to ask Yang Kai for more details; what she didn’t know was that he would mention these things on his own.

“Her strength is on par with my own now.” Yang Kai put on a smile, “She was taken in as a Disciple by a Great Emperor, so hardly anyone in this world can afford to offend her now.”

[A Great Emperor!?] Everyone became all ears, even though they didn’t understand what this title suggested.

However, they recalled the Starry Sky Great Emperor of the Star Field from the past. Many of them at the scene had even seen her countenance. She was a dazzling woman who was unrivalled in this world.

[Could she be Lin Yun’er’s Master?]

Yang Kai picked up his wine glass and rose from his chair. After looking around, he shouted, “All of you must be curious about what realm I am in now.”

Naturally, they were very curious. Yang Kai was already a Second-Order Origin King before he left the Star Field, so after years of venturing in the outside world, it was impossible that he was only a Third-Order Origin King now. There were many Origin King Realm Masters at this scene, but none of them was certain about Yang Kai’s realm. Besides the fact that he was a Star Master, there must be another reason behind this. The most fundamental reason was that his cultivation far outmatched their own.

However, no one had the guts to ask him about it, not even Ye Xi Yun. Was he about to unveil the mystery?

All of them stared fixedly at him and held their breaths. The hall was so quiet that even their heartbeats could be heard.

“Above the Origin King Realm is the Dao Source Realm, and above the Dao Source Realm is the Emperor Realm. I am now a First-Order Emperor!”

Dao Source Realm!

Emperor Realm!

These two new names had shaken them to the core. Just like two hammers that had broken the chains binding them apart, a door had opened before their eyes, beyond which a new world could be seen.

“The place I have been staying in is called the Star Boundary. It is a higher world than any Star Field. In that place, Origin Kings are common, and only Dao Source Realm Masters have some right to gain a footing. Meanwhile, only Emperor Masters have the power to stand above the world.” Yang Kai suddenly changed his tone, “Of course, if you’re too arrogant, you’ll still be killed.”

All of them started laughing as the atmosphere became less intense. However, what Yang Kai had said had shaken their concept of reality, especially those Origin King Realm Masters. They had always thought that they had already reached the peak, so they could look down at the mortals below them.

However, when they raised their heads, they realised that there were two higher peaks at a nearby place. They were engulfed in those peaks’ shadows, which caused them to feel helpless about their lives, but at the same time, they were also excited about it.

They had the desire to climb up the mountains and reach the peaks to experience a wider world and see more beautiful scenery.

At that instant, they felt their throats drying up.

“With that said, Emperor Realm Masters are not the strongest. Ten Great Emperors in the Star Boundary transcend Emperor Realm Masters. They are the ones who can truly summon the clouds and call the rain. Even now, I cannot imagine how powerful they actually are.”

All of them caught their breaths again. The Emperor Realm was already like an unreachable dream for them, so how stunning were those ten Great Emperors, who transcended Emperor Realm Masters?

They couldn’t and wouldn’t dare to imagine it.

Turning his head, Yang Kai gazed at Huang Juan and uttered, “Yun’er’s Master is Iron Blood Great Emperor!”

All of them turned their heads with difficulty and looked enviously at Huang Juan.

Earlier, when they heard from Yang Kai that Lin Yun’er was taken in as a disciple by a Great Emperor, they still didn’t understand the meaning behind it; after all, no one knew what a Great Emperor was. However, after Yang Kai’s explanation, they realized that the Great Emperors were the strongest, the ones who stood above all others as overlords.

How was this woman called Lin Yun’er so lucky that she had a Great Emperor as her Master? With such a powerful backer, no one in the Star Boundary would dare to offend her. No one could possibly rival her when it came to the opportunity she had managed to capture. She had basically reached the pinnacle in her cultivation journey, so she was even able to walk around Star Boundary with her head held high.

Noticing the shock behind their gazes, Yang Kai put on a smile, “The Star Boundary isn’t unreachable.”

Just then, something flashed across their eyes as Yang Kai had disappeared from their sight. After a moment of silence, they finally came to their senses.

[What did Yang Kai mean before he left?] That kept them wondering if they were also able to head to Star Boundary. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

[That’s right! He already went to Star Boundary several dozen years ago. Since he’s able to come back, he definitely can go there again. Perhaps he can even bring some people with him.] With this thought in mind, all of them became agitated. Then, they turned to look at Ye Xi Yun, only to be shocked to see that many others had surrounded her because they had thought of this as well. Now, many were asking her how to head to Star Boundary.

Ye Xi Yun placed her palm on her forehead as she felt her ears ringing, like countless flies were buzzing around her. Unable to take it anymore, she snarled, “I know nothing! If you all dare to be rowdy again, I’ll definitely teach you a lesson!”

In an instant, the place fell into silence.

After a snort, Ye Xi Yun picked up a bottle of wine and drained it in one gulp. Upon seeing that, all these Origin King Realm Masters were stunned. They had known Ye Xi Yun for years, but they had never seen her drink wine before. It had never crossed their minds that she would be so unflinching when she drank, so they couldn’t help but clap their hands for her.

…

On Jade Tree Peak in High Heaven Sect, Yang Kai suddenly appeared in front of a house and knocked on the door.

A moment later, the door opened, upon which Yang Ying Feng appeared before his son with messy clothes and a dishevelled look.

“Father, you…” The smile on Yang Kai froze as he examined the ‘spots’ on Yang Ying Feng’s face and neck. After looking around, he questioned cautiously, “Father, are you keeping a mistress? Does mom know about it? How could you be so foolish? If mom finds out about it, both of us will be killed! Who is that woman in the house?”

“Your mother is right here!” A woman bellowed.

Yang Kai flinched and shrank up while Yang Ying Feng glared at him and parted his lips, but his voice couldn’t be heard. Judging from the movements of his lips though, he seemed to be saying, ‘Brat, you’re doomed.’ Then, he was ready to close the door.

With his forehead drenched in cold sweat, Yang Kai stepped forward and stopped the door from closing with his foot. Then, he took his father’s arm and looked sincerely at him.

[Save me!]

However, Yang Ying Feng just glowered at him.

Yang Kai uttered, “Father, you must save me. I’m your only son. How do you have the heart to see me die!?”

After he returned, not only did he not visit his parents right away, he had actually gone missing for a whole month, so it was no wonder that his mother was so furious. In fact, he had never expected that he would spend so much time at the centre of the Star. Initially, he thought that he could deal with those invaders and come back quickly. Nevertheless, his plan was derailed by unexpected events.

Yang Ying Feng patted his shoulder and uttered in a heartfelt manner, “Just pray for yourself.”

Yang Kai felt helpless at that, no longer looking as nonchalant as when he was facing those Origin Kings. With a fawning smile, he called out, “Mother, your son is here to visit you. May I come in?”

Dong Su Zhu’s voice could be heard coming from the house, “Who are you? We don’t have a son like you. Don’t bother us while we’re having fun here. Leave now.”

Yang Kai was stunned, “Mother, don’t you recognise me? I’m your son, Yang Kai.”

Dong Su Zhu sneered, “Do I know you?”

Before Yang Kai could continue speaking, Yang Ying Feng spoke to him in his mind, “Leave first. Your mother is furious at the moment. I’ll give her some consolation and help her vent her anger. A woman’s heart will soften after her needs are satisfied.”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai found his father to be sensible. Then, he took out a jade bottle from his Space Ring and secretly stuffed it into his father’s hands.

“What’s this?” Yang Ying Feng took a glance at the bottle and then looked up at him.

“These are Dragon Muscle Tiger Bone Pills.” Yang Kai arched his brow, which suggested that all men should know what these pills were.

Yang Ying Feng took a deep breath and put the jade bottle in his sleeve.

[You’re indeed my good son! Good, I’ll please the tigress with my own body so that she’ll stop being mad!] Then, he turned around and closed the door. Following that, he strode toward his wife in a determined manner.
