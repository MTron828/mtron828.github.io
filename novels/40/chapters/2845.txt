In a gigantic eagle’s nest, the Eagle King was locked in place by Yang Kai’s Shamanic Spell. Yang Kai directed gleaming Beast Taming Spells from his hand to envelop the Eagle King again and again, but to no avail. The Eagle King screeched endlessly with its scarlet eyes filled with unyielding spirit.

Around the eagle’s nest, up to a hundred Giant Eagles constantly rushed towards them fearlessly in order to rescue their King.

Tiea was hovering mid-air as she pushed her Shaman Strength, wrapping the whole eagle nest in a Shield Spell, cutting off all the incoming Giant Eagles and rendering their wind blades useless.

Yang Kai and Tiea had gone straight into the Eagle King’s nest where Yang Kai bound the Eagle King before attempting to cast the Beast Taming Spell on it, but before he could even make a first try, it had already let out a fierce screech, which had alarmed the surrounding Giant Eagles, all of which rushed here together.

If not for Tiea’s timely defense, Yang Kai would not have had time to deal with the Eagle King.

The Realms of these Giant Eagles weren’t low, but they weren’t high either. If Tiea wanted to be cruel, she could slaughter all of them all in an instant; however, the purpose of Yang Kai coming here this time was not for a massacre, but to subdue these Barbarian Beasts. Therefore, Tiea could only block the Giant Eagles from interfering and dared not hurt them. Because of this, she could not truly unleash her full power as a Shaman Grandmaster and could only remain passive in the situation.

“Ah Niu, hurry up! I can’t hold on for too long!” Sweat beaded on Tiea’s forehead, as defending against the tremendous Giant Eagles’ charge attacks and wind blades for such a long time was exhausting her.

“I’m trying!” Yang Kai responded as he sent another gleaming Beast Taming Spell into the Eagle King’s body, only for it to fail again.

Still, he had caused great damage to the Eagle King after his continuous attempts as the Beast Taming Spell was an extremely oppressive Shamanic Spell. Although the Shamanic Spell failed to achieve its effect due to the unyielding spirit of the Eagle King, blood was leaking from all its orifices as a result of the backlash.

Fortunately, the Eagle King was much stronger than the other Giant Eagles. Otherwise, it would already be dead.

However, by the looks of it, it would not be able to hold on much longer.

Eagles were the proud beasts that ruled the sky and who would suffer no restraint to their freedom.

Staring coldly at the Eagle King’s red eyes, Yang Kai warned, “You should be able to understand what I’m saying, but even if you can’t, you should know what I mean. You have only two choices. Surrender… or die! I don’t have much time to play with you, and you don’t have many chances left. Decide wisely.”

When the words fell, another Beast Taming Spell was released. But this time, the light of Beast Taming Spell failed to even enter the Eagle King’s body and was directly rebounded by its will.

Yang Kai cursed with a ferocious look on his face when suddenly, a realization dawned on him. With a lift of his hand, a Moon Blade materialized and struck one of the Giant Eagles outside the shield, accurately cutting its body in half.

With its shrill screeching suddenly ceasing, the blood and viscera of that Giant Eagle rained down from the air as its two halves fell into the deep mountain stream.

Tiea turned around and glanced at Yang Kai in shock, having no idea why he had acted so crazily.

Yang Kai stared at the Eagle King and threatened it with a grin, “Every time you reject me, I’ll kill one of your companions. Let’s see how many times you dare refuse!”

While speaking, he performed the Beast Taming Spell again.

This time, the light of the Beast Taming Spell did not rebound, but it was obvious that the Eagle King was still resisting and unwilling to cooperate with him.

Without hesitation, Yang Kai raised his hand again, and another Giant Eagle was cut in half and fell from the air. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

*Liii!*

The Eagle King cried, infuriated. If it was not bound by Yang Kai’s Shamanic Spell, it probably would have charged at him right now and fought him to the death.

Instead of being offended though, Yang Kai was delighted, nodding his head as he declared, “Excellent! I’m glad that you’re angry! If you don’t want them to die, submit to me!”

Beast Taming methods could be traced back to Ancient Times and continued to be passed down even in modern times. In the Star Boundary there was even the renowned Beast Taming Sect. This Sect was famous for controlling Monster Beasts, and each of its disciples commanded several War Beasts, allowing them to fight multiple opponents of the same realm all on their own.

However, the method of Beast Taming used by that Sect was extremely gentle, but was also very complex and time-consuming.

Yang Kai did not know the secret methods of the Beast Taming Sect, but he believed that it was actually a derivative of the Beast Taming Spell from Ancient Times. No matter how despicable and insidious the method was, it only served one purpose, which was to subdue the Monster for their own use.

Using such means was the only way to achieve this goal.

With Yang Kai’s current strength, it would not be difficult for him to tame an Eagle King if he was given enough time, but the problem was that he did not have much time to waste. He had to hurry back to King City as soon as possible just in case there was a sudden outbreak of war.

The Eagle King was too rebellious though, so he had no choice but to use some extreme measure.

The Eagle King may not care about its own life as it would rather die than submit; however, as the ruler of its family, the inability to protect them was an even greater disgrace, one that was intolerable to any proud beast.

Every time a Giant Eagle was killed by Yang Kai, the Eagle King became more and more irritable, and the Shamanic Spell Chains that bound it even deformed from its unceasing struggles.

Yang Kai remained emotionless after killing off ten Giant Eagles in succession. Only then did the Eagle King abruptly stop its mad struggle and display a pleading look.

It probably noticed that if it did not give in, Yang Kai would kill its entire family.

Yang Kai observed its expression and understood that it was time to cast the Beast Taming Spell again. This time, the light of Beast Taming Spell neither rebounded nor was resisted, but instead easily broke through the Eagle King’s defences and directly branded itself into its body.

Yang Kai’s body shook as he suddenly felt a connection established between himself and the Eagle King, one that allowed him to control its life or death at any time.

The Eagle King, who had displayed unwavering arrogance, quickly became docile and lowered its noble head.

“It’s done!” Yang Kai grinned, patted the Eagle King’s head, took out several healing Spirit Pills, and offered them to it.

The Eagle King looked at these pills with almost human-like curiosity and after hesitating for a moment, swallowed them in one gulp. When the pills entered its stomach, the Eagle King immediately felt invigorated, all the lethargy caused by Yang Kai’s torture being removed.

Yang Kai tried to communicate with it.

And the Eagle King immediately responded.

The fearless Giant Eagles, that had been gathering around all the time without retreating despite Yang Kai’s killings, suddenly stopped attacking and just flapped their wings into the sky.

Seeing this, Tiea could not help letting out a sigh of relief as she looked back and asked, “Did you succeed?”

Yang Kai nodded.

Only then did Tiea remove her Shield Spell, looking a little pale.

“Take a rest. I’ll deal with things from here,” Yang Kai instructed her before he communicated with the Eagle King again for a while.

Although the Eagle King’s cultivation was not high enough for it to be able to assume human form, it already had a certain degree of sentience. Therefore, Yang Kai did not need to spend too much effort in communicating with it and requested it to order all the Giant Eagles to return to their nests. A moment later, all the Giant Eagles circling in the air returned to their nests.

Then, Yang Kai led the Eagle King to visit the Giant Eagles one by one.

If Yang Kai visited them alone, these Giant Eagles would certainly regard him as an enemy and launch an attack without any hesitation, but it would be different when he was accompanied by the Eagle King.

Under the suppression of the Eagle King, none of the Giant Eagles dared to resist. They stood quietly in their own eagle nests as Yang Kai implanted the gleaming Beast Taming Spell. The process went exceedingly smooth, and the procedure did not fail even once.

After working for an hour, Yang Kai had finally subdued all the Giant Eagles present. Counting them carefully, he found that there were seventy-six of them in total, including the Eagle King.

Yang Kai was overjoyed with the result.

With this many Giant Eagles, he could carry out the vague plan he formed earlier.

Tiea had also fully recovered after an hour of meditation. The pair immediately rode the Eagle King and returned along the way which they came.

Behind the Eagle King, seventy-five Giant Eagles flew in close formation, forming a huge shadow that shaded the entire vast land.

The flying speed of the Giant Eagles was quite fast, not slower than the maximum speed of a Shaman Grandmaster while still remaining extremely stable in flight. Not the slightest airflow interference was experienced by Yang Kai who was riding on the Eagle King’s back.

It took less than half a day for them to reach King City.

From a distance, an uproar was heard from below, and some people exclaimed, “The Barbarian Beasts are attacking!”

Many of the Ancient Barbarians, who had gathered from outlying villages, immediately responded. Spirit Archers drew their bows one after another, aiming at the Eagle King who led the way, while some Shaman Grandmasters chanting incantations, flew up in the air with the light of the Shield Spells covering their bodies as they moved towards the Eagle King.

The distance between the two sides rapidly narrowed and both overt and covert Shaman Strength fluctuations appeared from all directions one after another.

Seeing an attack was about to occur, Yang Kai quickly stood up from the Eagle King’s back and shouted, “Relax, relax!”

Many of the Ancient Barbarians were astonished to see a man on the eagle’s back.

And the Shaman Grandmasters who came to meet them were even more flabbergasted.

One of them wiped his eyes vigorously and questioned in shock, “Shaman Niu?”

The battle between Yang Kai and Shaman Tu yesterday was quite unforgettable. Many Shaman Grandmasters had witnessed the whole process, and they were deeply impressed by this thin and weak looking Shaman Niu, so they readily recognized him.

Among the crowd, Shaman Tu stepped out and asked in a daze, “Shaman Niu, where did you get so many Barbarian Beasts?”

Yang Kai smiled lightly, “I caught them.”

“Ca-Caught…” Their brows twitched at his reply. They would not be so astounded if these Flying Barbarian Beasts were easy to catch.

It was still understandable if Yang Kai was lucky to catch one Giant Eagle, but the number of these Giant Eagles was obviously one of an entire family.

[How did he manage to catch so many Giant Eagles in one go?]

Yang Kai stood on the eagle’s back and asked in a booming voice, “This is this Shaman’s Aerial Cavalry. What do you think?”

“Aerial Cavalry…” The Shaman Grandmasters were not idiots, so although this was the first time they heard about the term Aerial Calvary, they instantly understood Yang Kai’s plan. The next moment, many people’s eyes turned red in excitement as they gawked at those Giant Eagles with desire-filled eyes.

A great war was coming, and if anyone could have such an Aerial Cavalry, they would definitely have the upper hand in gathering information of the enemy, not to mention other advantages.
