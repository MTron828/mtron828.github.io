Chapter 6002: Response

While the millions of Human Race Soldiers were making the trek back home, all the Ninth-Order Masters gathered aboard the only intact Purifying Black Ink Warship remaining.

Compared to their peak, the number of Ninth-Order Masters had undoubtedly decreased significantly, with many of the recently advanced Ninth-Order Masters having perished in the battle.

Only 20 or so had managed to survive.

Apart from the Ninth-Order Masters, Fu Guang was also invited.

Everyone took their seats. Most of them were still injured, their auras weak and unstable. The battle ended not that long ago, and even with the recuperative abilities of Ninth-Order Masters, it was impossible for them to fully recover in such a short time, especially since the Human Race was running low on supplies, especially recovery pills.

One by one, the Ninth-Order Masters noticed the heavy air. They might not have an idea as to why Supreme Commander Mi had gathered all of them together, but they could tell that bad news was in store for them from his expression.

After the last Ninth-Order Master took their seat, Mi Jing Lun finally started addressing the crowd, “I’ve summoned you here today to confirm something.”

He looked around, paused for a moment, then recounted his conversation with Xiang Shan.

When the Ninth-Order Masters heard this, some were confused, some were lost in thought, and a few who realized the issue right away furrowed their brow.

Ou Yang Lie casually asked, “What’s there to fret about with your conversation with Big Head Xiang?”

He did not find anything wrong, it sounded just a normal chat to him.

“There’s a big problem!” Mi Jing Lun stared at him with a solemn expression, causing Ou Yang Lie to realize the gravity of the situation, despite not understanding what was the problem.

Xiang Shan explained, “The peace treaty we signed with the Black Ink Clan back then was of paramount importance and could be said to be the turning point in the entire war. It is impossible for Brother Mi and I to forget the details of such an important matter. It would’ve been nothing if it was just one of us having a hard time recalling certain trivial points of the treaty, but the problem is that neither of us can remember them. When we were discussing the treaty, both of us were unable to immediately recall even some of the basic details of the agreement. That should be absolutely impossible.”

Ou Yang Lie speculated, frowning, “Maybe you’re too tired from the battle?”

Xiang Shan focused his gaze on him, “Do you remember the first time you met Yang Kai?”

“Of course I remember,” Ou Yang Lie replied readily, “How could I forget such a thing? At that time, he…”

He slowly stopped talking. Obviously, he too had noticed the problem as his expression changed and a furrow appeared on his brow.

Xiang Shan then turned to the other Ninth-Order Masters and asked, “Everyone, why don’t you try recalling your encounters with Yang Kai, or some common knowledge about him!”

The Ninth-Order Masters complied.

Soon, a bewildered look took over everyone’s face.

Observing everyone’s expressions, Ou Yang Lie immediately understood that they too had encountered the same situation as him. He could not help but mumble, “How is this possible?”

When Xiang Shan asked him to, Ou Yang Lie attempted to recall the first time he met Yang Kai, but he actually couldn’t immediately remember it. It was as if his memory was blocked by an invisible barrier. It was right on the tip of his tongue, but he couldn’t enunciate it for some reason.

After struggling for a few breaths, he finally remembered that the first time he met Yang Kai was outside Great Evolution Pass. At that time, Ou Yang Lie was on a scouting mission with his Disciples, and Yang Kai arrived to meet him under Xiang Shan’s orders.

At that time, Yang Kai was only a Seventh-Order Master!

Mi Jing Lun’s voice sounded in everyone’s ears, “It’s not just you. After Brother Xiang and I discovered this problem, we ordered our men to ask the soldiers the same questions, and they too encountered the same situation. Regardless of whether they personally met with Yang Kai or simply heard stories about him, they were unable to immediately recall the details.”

“What caused this phenomenon?” Wu Qing asked in a low voice. He had just tried to recall things about Yang Kai, and it was indeed as Mi Jing Lun had described.

“I don’t know the exact reason, but I’m certain it has something to do with his Shadow Technique,” Mi Jing Lun continued, “Everyone should remember that Yang Kai said that the eight shadows were summoned from the next 8,000 years. He also said that because those eight shadows were destroyed, it meant that he would not exist for the next 8,000 years.”

Everyone nodded in acknowledgement as all of them were present when Mi Jing Lun and Yang Kai were discussing this.

“Yang Kai said that it was the price he paid to use the Shadow Technique, but now it seems that Yang Kai himself had underestimated the severity of this price. He thought that the price he had to pay would be to disappear for the next 8,000 years, but in reality, some kind of invisible force is slowly erasing all traces of his existence from this world! So, anything related to him would slowly become blurred in the memories of others.”

“Is such a thing really possible?” Ou Yang Lie found it hard to believe

The most direct way one would think that removing the traces of a person’s existence in this world meant was to kill that person, but the elimination that everyone encountered now was no longer as simple as just killing Yang Kai, even their memories of him were being lost.

Mi Jing Lun added, “Before Yang Kai used the Shadow Technique, even I hadn’t expected for such a bizarre Secret Technique to exist.”

Ou Yang Lie immediately fell silent.

The mysteries of the Shadow Technique were beyond their comprehension, so the price for using it was also unfathomable. As such, no matter how unbelievable Mi Jing Lun’s speculations were, there was indeed a possibility they were true.

“This is just the beginning. What I’m worried about is we might even forget everything about Yang Kai with time.”

All of the Ninth-Order Masters were shocked.

As the greatest hero who led the Human Race to victory and defeated Mo, Yang Kai should be remembered for all generations, but if the Human Race were to completely forget about him, that would truly be a tragic misfortune.

“What will happen if we completely forget about Yang Kai?” Mi Jing Lun asked.

No one could answer.

He didn’t ask any more, and instead postulated, “Before disappearing, Yang Kai said that he would return after 8,000 years, but even he did not sound certain of that. So, he might be able to return, or he might completely disappear. Right now, the traces of his existence are slowly being erased, which is akin to him disappearing. If one day everyone completely forgets about him, perhaps he might never appear again!”

Fu Guang, who had been silent all this time, finally spoke, “Supreme Commander Mi, do you mean to say that if many people in this world remember him and his fame remains widespread, perhaps it can help him return?”

Mi Jing Lun shook his head, “I’m not sure, but it is possible.”

“Then, it’s worth a shot!” Fu Guang nodded.

“However, the most important thing right now is to investigate the speed at which his traces are being erased. Only by confirming this matter can we make appropriate arrangements.”

“Agreed!”

“Agreed!”

“We’ll do as Supreme Commander Mi says.”

…

After many days of investigation by Ninth-Order Masters and questioning thousands of randomly selected soldiers, everyone reached an unfortunate conclusion.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The speed at which Yang Kai’s traces were being erased was increasing; more and more things related to Yang Kai were being forgotten. At this rate, everything related to Yang Kai would be completely gone in short order. By then, no one in this world would remember that there was once a hero who had saved the entire Human Race.

Mi Jing Lun couldn’t help but feel a sense of urgency. He immediately sent people back to the original location of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction to inform Su Yan and the others who were staying there. Although Su Yan and the others would most likely notice this on their own, it was always better to be prepared.

An advanced team had already been sent back to relay the news of their victory to the Human Race forces in the rear, so a joyful mood was already spreading.

When the Army returned, they were naturally received with warmth and celebration.

The Human Race Army had suffered heavy casualties in this battle, losing more than 60% of its soldiers. Be that as it may, it was all worth it as in the future, the world would no longer face the threat of Black Ink Strength.

But contrary to the expectations of everyone who had remained behind, the Crusade Force showed no signs of celebrating after their return; instead, they quickly dispersed as if there was a new mission waiting for them.

Soon, great statues were erected in the Star Boundary, Myriad Monsters World, and everywhere else the Human Race lived, whether it was a village, a town, or a city.

The statue depicted a brave and heroic man wielding a long spear that seemed to have a Dragon coiling around it. This man seemed to be staring down an invisible enemy, confronting them in battle. 

At the base of the statue was Yang Kai’s name.

Meanwhile, Mi Jing Lun entered High Heaven Palace, and with the cooperation of Hua Qing Si and Xia Ning Chang, gathered all the people who had close relationships with Yang Kai. Afterwards, under Mi Jing Lun’s supervision, they jointly wrote a biography.

Naturally, it was Yang Kai’s biography, and it included all the big and small matters that had happened in his life.

There were no excessively embellished accounts in it, just the simple and factual descriptions. Nonetheless, anyone who read this biography would understand how magnificent Yang Kai’s life was.

Everyone would come to know that in the darkest era of the Human Race, it was he who tore through the darkness and brought a bright ray of hope to them.

They would also come to know that Yang Kai had ultimately paid a huge price to finally defeat the ancient being named Mo and end the war between the two Races that had lasted for millions of years!

Most importantly, they would know that the world could not forget him; otherwise, he would never be able to return!

After this biography was written, countless copies of it were made by High Heaven Palace disciples and distributed to all the places where the Human Race lived, especially the places where Yang Kai’s statue was erected. The Ninth-Order Masters even personally placed these jade slips containing Yang Kai’s biography into the statues.

This way, as long as someone examined the statue, they would be able to immediately perceive the contents of the jade slip and understand Yang Kai’s life experiences.

Many of the Human Race’s upper echelons were trying their best to prevent the Human Race from forgetting their greatest hero, Yang Kai.

On top of that, the Ninth Order Master once again convened a meeting after the Army had returned. Everyone felt that the world was vast and time was difficult to measure, so they decided that the year the Crusade Force returned to the Star Boundary would be designated as the first year of the Void Era!

Void was a title, the title of one of the greatest heroes that was slowly being forgotten.

As time passed away, new generations of Humans were born, matured, and aged. Everyone had already forgotten about Yang Kai, even the Ninth-Order Masters who had fought alongside him, but the statues that had been erected remained standing tall.
