“Are you angry?” The Proprietress and Yang Kai were moving forward in the void as she stroked his head.

A battered and bruised Yang Kai lowered his head and sighed, “I wouldn’t dare to.” If getting mad was useful at all, there would be no point in cultivating.

In response, the Proprietress giggled.

With a bitter expression, Yang Kai said, “Proprietress, if there’s any issue in the future, can you just talk it out with me instead of resorting to fists?” Then, he pulled her hand away from his head.

Suppressing her laughter, the Proprietress replied, “Good. Now, there’s something I need to ask you about, and you’d better answer me honestly.”

“Go ahead.” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly.

Suddenly, the Proprietress turned solemn and asked in a grim voice, “What is the Order of your Fire Element Power?”

After a moment of silence, Yang Kai replied, “It should be at or above Seventh Order.”

He couldn’t hide it any longer as the moment he used his Golden Crow Casts the Sun Divine Manifestation in Scarlet Star’s Star City, this was no longer a secret. That was because there were harsh conditions to be met in order to use a Divine Manifestation. It required a Seventh-Order Element Power at the very least or for a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters to master one of their Elements. In other words, Divine Manifestations were exclusive to High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters.

However, that didn’t mean all High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters could definitely comprehend a Divine Manifestation. Some would never understand the abstrusity of a Manifestation in their lifetime.

Since time immemorial, no Emperor Realm cultivator had ever comprehended a Divine Manifestation.

Zhao Bai Chuan was amazed when he saw ‘Golden Crow Casts the Sun’, and he claimed that with this Divine Manifestation, despite the fact that Yang Kai was just an Emperor Realm Junior, he would be capable of battling Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters.

The gap between the Emperor Realm and the Open Heaven Realm was no different from the gap between the Heavens and Earth. An Open Heaven Realm Master, even if he was just the lowest First-Order, had formed a Small Universe in their body and was capable of using World Force. Killing an Emperor Realm cultivator for such a Master was as easy as going for a stroll in their backyard.

Below the Emperor Realm, Yang Kai could always fight against opponents in higher realms, but even at the peak of the Emperor Realm, he could not even fight with Open Heaven Realm Masters.

However, with his Divine Manifestation, it was now possible.

Many people had seen him use the Divine Manifestation on that day, and after the closure of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, this news would definitely be spread. It wouldn’t have mattered if the Proprietress didn’t ask about it, but now that she wanted to know, Yang Kai wouldn’t hide it from her.

“Golden Crow Casts the Sun!” The Proprietress grinned meaningfully, “I heard that your Fire Element Power is the Golden Crow’s True Fire?”

“Uh… en. It’s exactly the Golden Crow’s True Fire.” A guilty Yang Kai kept scratching his cheek.

“I’m curious. As an Emperor Realm Junior, how were you able to obtain the Golden Crow’s True Fire?” The Proprietress stared fixedly at him and ground her teeth, “If I’m not mistaken, it hasn’t been a long time since you arrived in the 3,000 Worlds, and your only encounter with the Golden Crow’s True Fire was in First Inn. Do you mean to tell me that you absorbed the power of the Golden Crow carcass during that time?”

Yang Kai turned his head and forced a smile at her.

In an instant, the Proprietress’ expression turned livid as she roared, “How dare you!”

His silence meant that he admitted it.

“Do you enjoy courting death!?” The Proprietress was both angry and shocked. At that time, there were several High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters as well as several dozen Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters vying for that prize. How did Yang Kai have the guts to absorb the Golden Crow’s True Fire when they were literally watching him? More importantly, he actually succeeded!

With a serious expression, she said, “The Golden Crow’s True Fire is immensely powerful, and it can only be constrained by an equally powerful Wood Element Power. Since you were able to absorb the Golden Crow’s True Fire, does that mean that you have already condensed a High-Rank Wood Element Power?”

“Proprietress is indeed beautiful and intelligent!” Yang Kai gave her a thumbs-up.

The brow of the Proprietress twitched as she muttered, “High-Rank Wood and Fire Elements… What else? Have you gotten any rewards in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary? Have you condensed any other Powers? Earth? Metal?”

“En, both the Earth and Water Elements,” Yang Kai replied honestly.

“Earth and… Water?” The Proprietress appeared doubtful, “How were you able to condense your Water Element Power when you don’t have a Metal Element Power?”

“It’s a long story, but suffice it to say, I used a Secret Technique to skip the Metal Element Power and directly condense my Water Element Power.”

The Proprietress was both shocked and doubtful, “Show me your Earth and Water Elements.”

Unable to reject her, Yang Kai subsequently activated his Earth and Water Element Powers in his Dao Seal. Firstly, he was surrounded by Dragon Shields, and after they were dispelled, he surged his Water Element Power, whereupon the atmosphere literally froze.

Upon sensing the immense might of these two Element Powers, the Proprietress gasped as her chest heaved and she exclaimed, “Both of them are High-Rank Powers!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

In disbelief, she stared at Yang Kai. It had only been a bit more than ten years since this brat arrived in the 3,000 Worlds, but he had already condensed four High-Rank Elements. It was indeed thanks to the countless opportunities in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary that he was able to condense his Earth Element and Water Element, but even taking that into consideration, his achievements still far surpassed those of most elite cultivators.

No cultivator could ever condense a High-Rank Open Heaven Element in such a short period of time. Normally, it required a long time of accumulation. Furthermore, it was extremely time-consuming to collect such materials.

Normally, for an Emperor Realm Junior, if it only took them a hundred years to go from condensing their Dao Seal to ascending to the Open Heaven Realm, it could be considered rapid. Normally, people needed several hundred years to a thousand years to make this happen.

People who could ascend to the Open Heaven Realm in several dozen years were considered rare geniuses, yet it only took Yang Kai a little more than ten years to condense four Element Powers, all of which were High-Rank. Hardly anyone would believe this story.

“Do you intend to directly ascend to the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm?” The Proprietress gaped at him.

With a solemn expression, Yang Kai replied, “Yes.”

At the mention of this, he suddenly thought of something, “Proprietress, is there any problem with directly breaking through to the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm?”

In the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, Yue He had repeatedly dissuaded him from doing so, even going so far as to cooperate with Zhu Jiu Yin to make him forcefully condense a Sixth-Order Metal Element Power to set his foundation. It was only because Yang Kai threatened to kill himself that Zhu Jiu Yin gave up on that idea.

Sixth-Order and Seventh-Order were separated by only one Order, but it was akin to the difference between the Heavens and Earth. Besides the fact that one was Mid-Rank and the other was High-Rank, the greatest achievement a person could attain would be different too. Since it had something to do with his future on the Martial Dao, Yang Kai was expected to resist fiercely; otherwise, he wouldn’t have had the courage to offend someone like Zhu Jiu Yin in the Boundary.

What Yue He had done made him feel that something was off though, but when he asked her about it, she only told him to ask the Proprietress about it if there was a chance.

Now that the Proprietress was right in front of him, Yang Kai wanted to find out the answer.

However, the Proprietress fell silent.

A while later, she let out a long sigh, “I never expected that you were such an ambitious person. Directly ascending to the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm is risky. The strength of our Dao Seal is the foundation on which we are able to bear the Yin, Yang, and Five Element Powers. The higher the Order those Element Powers are, the stronger our Dao Seal is required to be. If the powers exceed our own limits, when we ascend to the Open Heaven Realm, there’s a risk of our Dao Sealing exploding, costing us our lives. I’m sure you’re aware of that already.”

Yang Kai nodded in response. Certainly, he was aware of this reality; however, that didn’t really bother him as his Dao Seal was extremely firm. Besides that, he had consumed over ten drops of Divine Dao Water in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, which further strengthened his Dao Seal. Hence, there was no problem for him to bear Seventh-Order Elements.

“The risk that comes with the Dao Seal is just a natural disaster, however. In order to directly ascend to the High Rank, the biggest threat you’ll face is a man-made disaster.”

“What do you mean by that?” A puzzled Yang Kai frowned.

The Proprietress went on to say, “Even after cultivators like us ascend to the Open Heaven Realm, we don’t become stuck in that same Order forever. By consuming Open Heaven Pills or using other means, we can strengthen our own World Force and improve the Small Universe in our bodies, which allows us to ascend to higher Orders. However, since the foundation has been built, the ability to build around it is limited. Normally, after a person ascends to the Open Heaven Realm, he or she can make use of external help to achieve an ascension by two Orders, with no hope of achieving more than that.”

After a pause, she continued, “For example, I’m now a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so I’ll have a chance to become an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master in the future, and that’s my limit. On the other hand, Old Bai is a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master now, so his limit is the Seventh-Order. Of course, if you can find the Universe Furnace, that’s a different story. The Universe Furnace is an innate artifact and the Open Heaven Pills it nurtures have far greater efficacy than the pills refined made by Alchemists. With these Innate Open Heaven Pills, one can break through their limits. However, you shouldn’t even think about it. According to the ancient books, it was very rare for the Universe Furnace to appear, and every appearance led to a reign of blood and terror.”

Then, she added, “The Second-Order and Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm are the dividing points. For those who break through directly to the Second Order, the limit is the Fourth Order, and for the Fifth Order, the limit is the Seventh Order. In other words, there’s a possibility for a Low-Rank cultivator to ascend to the Mid-Rank and for a Mid-Rank cultivator to ascend to the High-Rank; therefore, normally, if a person is capable enough, they will either choose to ascend to the Second-Order Open Heaven Realm in the Low-Rank or the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm in the Mid-Rank. That’s to give themselves greater hope for the future.”

Yang Kai nodded his head, “It’s no wonder both Old Bai and Yue He ascended to the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm.”

The Proprietress nodded, “That’s one of the reasons. Another reason is that it’s where their limit is. Furthermore, it’s difficult to look for Sixth-Order materials.”

Every Sixth-Order material was incredibly precious. Yang Kai had indeed obtained a lot of rewards in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, but there was only a small number of Sixth-Order resources in comparison. He had about a hundred such resources at most, and that was after he became the most powerful person in the Boundary and had Scarlet Star collect all these for him.

All of a sudden, the Proprietress shot him a glance, “If you want to directly ascend to the Seventh Order, what will your limit be?”

“Ninth-Order!” Yang Kai’s expression was calm but serious.

“Yes, Ninth-Order.” The Proprietress sported a smile, “Is there anyone in the world who can go against such a figure? Even the Cave-Heavens and Paradises won’t sit back and watch you grow, for once that happens, you will shake the foundation on which they rule over the 3,000 Worlds.”

Yang Kai’s expression changed, “So, this is what you mean by a man-made disaster?”

The Proprietress nodded gently, “All Thirty-Six Cave-Heavens and Seventy-Two Paradises will not sit back and do nothing.”

Yang Kai paled, “Are those top great forces really that unreasonable and overbearing?”

Things had become a little thorny now. In the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, he had made friends with Xu Zhen and the others, and they were the disciples from Cave-Heavens and Paradises. After they returned to their Sects, they would definitely make full reports to their Masters. When the people from those top great forces became aware that Yang Kai had condensed several High-Rank Element Powers and even comprehended a Divine Manifestation, he would fall into a perilous situation.
