The entire scene fell silent.

Everyone was so stunned that their jaws dropped uncontrollably as they could not believe that a young man in the Dao Source Realm could take such a fierce blow without suffering any injuries.

“Seriously? He blocked it?”

“I can’t believe my eyes!”

“Is he really just a Dao Source Realm? This guy must have hidden his cultivation, right?”

“Hahaha, what a shame to Liang Qiu!”

A cold shudder ran through Liang Qiu as his purlicue was numb and he felt lightheaded. He glanced down at his spear in a daze before turning back to look at Yang Kai, muttering with some difficulty, “Are you really human?”

There was some slight horror in his voice. He obviously could not believe that Yang Kai could actually fight him with just his fists. How was that even possible? He was just a Dao Source Realm cultivator after all.

“I don’t really like how you asked your question. If I’m not a human, what would I be? A ghost?” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

The surrounding Emperor Realm Masters were also re-evaluating Yang Kai, as if they wanted to dig up whatever secrets he was hiding.

They had never heard of a Dao Source Realm cultivator who could fight against an Emperor Realm Master evenly. Even if it was them before they broke through, they could not achieve what Yang Kai had just done in the Third-Order Dao Source Realm.

The physique of this brat was so powerful that it could actually withstand the strike of Liang Qiu’s spear, and the speed of his recovery… was simply too astonishing.

His fists that were badly mutilated before had completely recovered by the time they had recovered from their initial shock. What’s more, this boy’s blood wasn’t red, but light gold instead, and it seemed to contain an unbelievable amount of vitality!

Yao Si’s eyes narrowed slightly. As the son of a Great Emperor, he always felt that he was superior to the others and did not put the cultivators of his generation in his eyes, because regarding aptitude, strength, or background, no one could surpass him in this world.

Before Liang Qiu attacked, he also thought that Yang Kai was doomed to die and paid him no mind.

However, reality was far different from his expectations.

Perhaps there may not be people who had a better background than him, but in terms of aptitude and strength, he definitely could not just simply look down on others. This Dao Source Realm young man was a great example of that!

“You… are really strange!” Liang Qiu shook his head after seriously examining Yang Kai for a while.

Yang Kai snorted, “Do you want to come at me again? If so, this Young Master will accompany you until you’re satisfied!”

“No need!” Liang Qiu shook his head lightly, “You have the right to be here!”

The reason why he attacked Yang Kai was only that his cultivation did not reach the Emperor Realm. All the people who stayed were Emperor Realm Masters, or companions of Emperor Realm Masters, while only Yang Kai’s group was made up of Dao Source Realms, which stood out from the rest.

He naturally wanted to teach Yang Kai a lesson and make him an example to the people who were driven away, letting them know the serious consequences of staying here without adequate strength.

However, his plan failed, and he was astonished by Yang Kai instead.

If this fight went on and he won, others would just perceive he had only won due to his unfair advantage over Yang Kai; but if he lost, he would be too embarrassed to walk the Star Boundary anymore.

Yet, Liang Qiu did not have the confidence in beating Yang Kai.

“Good!” Yang Kai cupped his fists unabashedly.

At this moment, Liu Yan suddenly shouted, “Master, something’s wrong with Little Sister Xiao Qi!”

Yang Kai quickly turned to look, and saw Mo Xiao Qi’s beautiful eyes glowing with icy piercing light, her gaze looking incomparably sharp. An astonishing aura was now seeping out of her tender body, one which reminded Yang Kai of his Mountains and Rivers Bell, an ancient and desolate air that caused shivers to all who felt it.

The faces of all the people who felt the aura changed slightly.

Mo Xiao Qi was glaring at Liang Qiu with a murderous intent so strong it had manifested physically and was now warping space around her. Her sharp eyes abruptly turned emotionless and a kind of lofty look that seemed to ignore and despise everything in the world filled them, frightening everyone present.

At the same time, the butterfly mark on her cheek began to quiver, as if it was alive, fluttering awake from its slumber.

As the butterfly wings flapped, an extremely violent pressure spread out, causing everyone to gasp, as if their chests were being pressed down on by a huge mountain.

“What’s happening?” Yang Kai was no less panicked than anyone else.

He had no idea why Mo Xiao Qi suddenly entered such an abnormal state. There was no sign of something like this happening before he and Liang Qiu fought, and he only discovered it after Liu Yan alerted him.

“Not good!” Princess Lan Xun, who was standing not far away, exclaimed in fright, her beautiful face turning pale as she stared at Mo Xiao Qi with slightly trembling eyes.

“What’s wrong with her!” Liang Qiu immediately wiped the cold sweat on his head and asked anxiously, “Why is this little girl looking at me like she is going to eat me?”

Although he had broken through to the Emperor Realm, he couldn’t help trembling when he saw Mo Xiao Qi staring at him menacingly. A sense of impending death now lingered about him, making him feel extremely anxious.

“It’s all because of your actions against her Big Brother Yang!” Lan Xun snapped and gritted her teeth, “Xiao Qi must have thought Senior Brother Yang would be killed by you, so she became like this in panic.”

Liang Qiu gulped, “It’s not my fault! He was the one who rushed over here himself and no one should be blamed even if he died. Then again, who is this little girl and where did she come from? Just now, she blatantly threatened to slaughter my whole Hundred Barbarian Mountain. How ridiculous!”

Although he was smiling, his smile was forced and unnatural. He was obviously frightened by Mo Xiao Qi seemingly transforming into a completely different person all of sudden and exuding such astonishing pressure. It was obvious that she had a very strong background, but he had no idea what it was.

Lan Xun glared fiercely at him, answering solemnly word by word, “Her surname is Mo, from the Eastern Territory!”

“Mo… Eastern Territory…” Liang Qiu’s face scrunched slightly when he heard her answer, but after a brief moment, he came into a realization and exclaimed, “No way, she is that Sir’s… “

“Now you understand!” Lan Xun replied rudely. At this moment, she was also extremely anxious and there was sweat visible at the tip of her nose. She looked at Mo Xiao Qi worriedly while trying to console her softly, but it was all to no avail.

“Brother Yao Si, you’re too much!” Liang Qiu turned to Yao Si with a long face, “You are from the Eastern Territory too, so why didn’t you inform me about her?”

Yao Si was the son of the Serene Soul Great Emperor, while Mo Xiao Qi was the daughter of the Martial Beast Great Emperor. Both Great Emperors lived in the Eastern Territory, so Liang Qiu did not believe that Yao Si did not recognize Mo Xiao Qi, yet he had kept silent and let him openly mock her.

Liang Qiu recalled the humiliation he caused Mo Xiao Qi about her not-fully-grown hair and immediately broke out into a cold sweat.

If his words reached the ears of the Martial Beast Great Emperor, he would definitely peel off a layer of his skin.

Also, if he had known that Yang Kai had the daughter of the Martial Beast Great Emperor as his companion, how could he have dared to act so foolishly?

Yao Si responded faintly, “Even though we are both from the Eastern Territory, I have never met her before, so how could I possibly warn you?”

It seemed that he really did not recognize Mo Xiao Qi, but he did recognize Lan Xun, and he knew that it was impossible for someone of her status to lie about such an important matter.

After a while, Mo Xiao Qi was still unresponsive to Lan Xun’s callings and she could not help stomping her foot, “Liang Qiu, if anything happens to Xiao Qi, your whole Hundred Barbarian Mountain will definitely be slaughtered, and not even a chicken will be spared!”

Liang Qiu’s face changed as his mood rapidly sank to the bottom. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He ignored Mo Xiao Qi when she said the same words before, but now that Lan Xun declared them again, he had no choice but to take things seriously.

[This… this matter really has nothing to do with me…] Liang Qiu secretly felt a great sense of injustice.

“Junior Sister Lan, what’s wrong with Xiao Qi?” Yang Kai observed for a while, but still could not figure out what was happening to Mo Xiao Qi. He only saw that her aura was getting scarier by the moment, and the butterfly mark on her face became more and more lively. The butterfly mark even flew out of her cheek and was now fluttering around her tender body.

As time passed, the pitch-black butterfly enlarged rapidly, turning into the size of a person, which looked exceptionally odd.

Lan Xun disclosed, “Little Sister Xiao Qi released her Divine Soul Seal!”

“Divine Soul Seal?” The crowd turned to her curiously, wondering what was happening.

“In his early years, Sir Martial Beast met an Ancient Divine Spirit, the Heavenly Illusion Butterfly. The Heavenly Illusion Butterfly had lost its body, and only its Soul was preserved intact. After the vicissitudes of time, it had grown incredibly weak, so Sir Martial Beast signed a Soul Contract with it, and when Xiao Qi was three years old, the Heavenly Illusion Butterfly’s Soul was sealed into her body so it could protect her before she came of age. Naturally, it came with a price as the Heavenly Illusion Butterfly’s Soul would feed on some of Xiao Qi’s Spiritual Essence to survive! This is the nature of the Divine Soul Seal!”

“An Ancient Divine Spirit’s Soul!” Liang Qiu gasped.

The faces of the rest of the people present also changed drastically.

Ancient Divine Spirits had always been creatures of legend, and only a few people had seen a true Ancient Divine Spirit before.

But now, in this desolate void, an Ancient Divine Spirit’s Soul actually came into view, and it was actually sealed in a little girl’s body.

No one knew how strong this Soul was, but judging from the scene that it caused since its release, its strength could not be contended by anyone here.

How marvellous was the cultivation of the Martial Beast Great Emperor who sealed this Soul into his daughter’s body and allowed it to become Mo Xiao Qi’s protector?

“Only in the most dangerous of situations would Xiao Qi release this seal. This should be her first time, so she can’t control it properly,” Lan Xun pressed on and glared at Yang Kai briefly, seeming to blame him a bit.

She was also secretly amazed. Previously, she thought that the reason Mo Xiao Qi cared so much for Yang Kai was to oppose her; but now, she understood that Mo Xiao Qi truly cared for Yang Kai, otherwise she would not have released this seal.

She probably thought that Yang Kai was bound to die, so she had to release the seal to avenge him; however, Yang Kai was unscathed after the exchange while on the contrary, Mo Xiao Qi herself had lost consciousness and was being taken over by the Soul of the Heavenly Illusion Butterfly.
