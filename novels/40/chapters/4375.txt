On the other hand, Ti Zheng and the others exchanged glances as they appeared ecstatic.

Even though a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was fairly powerful in the 3,000 Worlds, such a person was nothing in the eyes of these High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters. If Yang Kai really ascended to the Fifth-Order, it was something worth celebrating for the great forces behind them.

A Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master would never be able to move the world order. For a cultivator who had the hopes of becoming a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master to end up in such a state, it was no different from killing him.

Instead of ending his life, they had killed his future.

Ti Zheng’s gaze brightened as he asked, “Are you serious?”

Yang Kai gazed at him with a tilted head, “You look happy, don’t you?”

Ti Zheng coughed, “Not really. However, a wise man knows when to submit to the circumstances. This Monarch is gratified that you’ve made such a decision.”

“Cut the nonsense,” Yang Kai replied dispassionately.

Ti Zheng and the others then secretly spoke to each other. Certainly, they were sure that they didn’t have a Sixth-Order Yin Element material. Even if Yang Kai wanted to examine their rings, they weren’t afraid.

Although it was humiliating for these High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters to let an Emperor Realm Junior examine their Space Rings, it was better than remaining in this stalemate forever. It was especially true for Ti Zheng. He was injured in the battle against Zhu Jiu Yin, so he desperately needed a quiet place to recuperate and stabilize his Small Universe; otherwise, he might be left with some potential issues later.

The others were in a better state, but they were also wounded. Moreover, as High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters, they didn’t want to keep wasting time on Yang Kai anymore. By settling this issue as soon as possible, they could go back and tell everyone that they had achieved their goal.

Therefore, they soon came to an agreement.

Ti Zheng scolded, “Brat, we all agree that we’ll let you examine our rings; however, if you can’t find any Sixth-Order Yin Element materials, you must not go back on your word. Otherwise, we’ll kill you right here even if we have to face the Dragon Clan’s wrath!”

Yang Kai sneered, “Don’t worry. Even though I’m just an Emperor Realm cultivator, I value my reputation. Unlike some other people, I’ll never go back on my word.” Then, he spread his palm, “Pass me your rings. Oh, take out everything from your Small Universes as well. I know that the Small Universes of High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters like you all must have materialised. Not only can you store some stuff inside it, but you can also let some living creatures live inside it.”

Ti Zheng and the others sported dark expressions; however, things had come to a point that they didn’t want to argue with Yang Kai anymore. Therefore, they fished out a number of things from their Small Universes and put them inside their Space Rings.

Obviously, Yang Kai was unable to find out whether they had actually taken everything out, unless he could also inspect the Small Universes in their bodies.

However, that would never happen. Ti Zheng and the others had made a concession by letting Yang Kai go through their Space Rings, but there was no way they’d let anyone probe their Small Universes, or else they’d be risking their lives.

Even if they had some precious items stashed in their Small Universes, they wouldn’t put them into their Space Rings. Yang Kai was fully aware of that.

Soon, their Space Rings fell into Yang Kai’s hands. The restrictions on the rings had been erased so that he could easily examine them.

When Yang Kai scanned one of the rings with his Divine Sense, he couldn’t help raising his brow.

The wealth of a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master was truly astonishing. Open Heaven Pills had been piled up like mountains, and there were countless resources, which included many Sixth-Order ones. There was even one Seventh-Order material in this particular ring. The number of artifacts in the ring was mind-blowing as well.

He didn’t have time to go through them one by one, but Yang Kai reckoned that the resources in this ring were worth more than 10 billion Open Heaven Pills.

Obviously, that wasn’t all this man’s wealth. The truly precious items must be kept inside his Small Universe.

Unfortunately, none of the Sixth-Order and Seventh-Order materials were Yin or Yang.

Yang Kai set the ring aside and looked at the next, finding it to be about the same.

Ti Zheng and the others were just standing nearby as they watched Yang Kai joyfully go through all the rings. All of them found it odd as they never expected that things would develop into such a situation.

Their initial goal was to kill Yang Kai in this place; however, not only was Yang Kai alive and kicking, but they would also have to help him ascend to the Open Heaven Realm. Besides that, they had also passed their Space Rings to him to inspect. What they had done was no different from financially supporting their enemy.

Nevertheless, they could not object.

Although they were High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters who had lived for many years, it was the first time they had such a strange experience.

It only took Yang Kai a short time to examine all of the rings.

Ti Zheng asked, “Now you know we didn’t lie to you.”

Yang Kai looked up and roared, “The Heavens are unfair!”

Upon seeing that he appeared crestfallen, Ti Zheng and the others felt less frustrated. Since they had confronted and attempted to kill each other before, there wasn’t a need for them to be polite to him. Ti Zheng said, “In that case, you should give our rings back to us.”

Yang Kai nonchalantly tossed the Space Rings at Yue He and kept only a bottle that was half his height.

They were too gullible to think that he would return the rings to them. Yang Kai had relented and agreed to become a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, but since he didn’t have the item he needed, he could only lower his expectation and ascend to the Fifth-Order.

With the existence of a particular item he possessed, it made no difference whether he ascended to the Fifth-Order or the Sixth-Order, and he would be able to deceive the outside world. However, there was a price to pay if he wanted to use that precious treasure.

The thing was so valuable that the Space Rings of these High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters could only be considered as a slight compensation for it. There was no way he would give the rings back to them, for he still had Void Land to run. Even though he had a Star City to help gather resources, he wouldn’t mind more good things.

“You dare covet our Space Rings!?” Ti Zheng glared at Yang Kai. He was so exasperated that he laughed and nodded, “Very good! You’re indeed bold enough!”

Ignoring him, Yang Kai fiddled with the bottle and shook it. As he listened to the ringing sound coming from the bottle, he asked, “Is this the Heavenly Yin Sand that you’d mentioned?”

Presently, Ti Zheng was fuming within him, so upon hearing the question, he snorted and did not reply to him.

In fact, the moment he passed the Space Ring to Yang Kai, he had a feeling that he would never get it back; however, he was incensed at the fact that the young man did it in such a brazen way. It was apparent that he had no regard for them at all.

Yang Kai gazed at Ti Zheng and questioned, “Are you deaf? Is this the Heavenly Yin Sand?”

Ti Zheng looked away and pretended that he didn’t hear him.

Yang Kai said smilingly, “It seems that it’s not Heavenly Yin Sand. I won’t break through then.”

Upon hearing that, Ti Zheng glowered at him and said through clenched teeth, “Don’t you cross the line, Yang Kai!”

The faint smile on Yang Kai’s face made Ti Zheng have the urge to give him a punch. After taking a deep breath, he said, “Heavenly Yin Sand is extremely hard to come by. It’s one of the rarest among the Fifth-Order materials. It’s just that it isn’t a Sixth-Order material. However, the Divine Ability you’ll obtain through this item is as powerful as that of most Sixth-Order Powers once you condense it. The one in your hands was meant for another disciple in my great force. I have no choice but to give it to you.”

Yang Kai snorted, “I was supposed to ascend to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, but I can only make do with the Fifth-Order because of you all. Who is the one taking advantage here?”

Ti Zheng fell silent.

“Forget it. I’m not in the mood to bicker with you.” Yang Kai lightly threw the bottle into the air and said to Zhu Jiu Yin, “Please stand guard for me, Senior.”

After a moment of silence, Zhu Jiu Yin reminded, “Brat, this is an important matter, so you must think it through.”

...

Yang Kai replied with a bitter smile, “I’m like an arrow on the string now; there’s no going back for me.”

If he went back on his word at this point, he was basically forcing Ti Zheng and the others to fight to the death with them. They had Zhu Jiu Yin’s protection, so they would easily escape from this place, but they wouldn’t stand a chance to save the Proprietress.

Furthermore, Zhu Jiu Yin had been wounded after the previous battle. Presently, she looked pretty battered as was covered in blood.

“Forget it. It’s your own matter and no one else can interfere. I hope you won’t regret your decision in the future.”

After she finished speaking, she flicked her fingers as threads of spider silk criss-crossed each other in the void, forming an impenetrable web which covered a large area except for the spot Yang Kai was in. If Ti Zheng and the others wanted to harm Yang Kai, they had to break her web first.

Ti Zheng and the others had experienced how horrendous this Heaven Covering Web was, so they didn’t dare to fall into it again.

“Young Master…” Yue He’s eyes reddened as she pressed her lips together. She seemed to be holding back her words.

Yang Kai waved his hand, “All of you stand back.”

Then, he gently closed his eyes and thought to himself, [Will I regret my decision?]

If it were for any other reason, he probably would; however, since he was doing this to save Proprietress, he didn’t think there would come a day when he felt regretful.

As he emptied his mind, he calmed himself and sat cross-legged in the centre of the Heaven Covering Web. His aura was curbed while he remained unmoving, as though he had fallen into a state of deep sleep.

...

Upon seeing that, Yue He and the others knew that it was pointless for them to say anything else, so they spread out and stood guard for Yang Kai in nearby spots. They stared vigilantly at Ti Zheng and the others to prevent them from disturbing Yang Kai while he achieved his breakthrough.

It was completely silent in the void. All of them were paying close attention to Yang Kai as they tended their wounds.

Time went by slowly, and half a day later, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes and flicked the bottle. Following a clang, the cap flew up as a ray of light shot out of the bottle. It was apparent that the ray of light was made up from countless grains of sand. Every grain exuded a light glow and an extremely cold aura. They looked just like a galaxy that had been shrunk down innumerable times. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Heavenly Yin Sand was indeed one of the best materials in the Fifth-Order. As soon as it appeared, the void seemed to have been frozen over as a layer of frost formed on Yang Kai’s clothes and hair.

Instead of resisting, Yang Kai circulated his Secret Art and pushed his Dao Seal to refine the Yin Element Power in the Heavenly Yin Sand.

At that instant, the galaxy formed from the sand seemed to have been attracted by a mysterious force as it swirled and danced around Yang Kai. Looking from afar, it was as if he was engulfed in a storm of silver rain.

Yang Kai had refined other Element Powers before, the last one being the Golden Wolf King’s Monster Core, which was a Seventh-Order Metal Element treasure. Although the Heavenly Yin Sand was extraordinary for its Order, it wasn’t comparable to that Monster Core at all.
