Chapter 102 - Meng Wu Ya’s Miscalculation

Translator - Luffy

Editor - Ben & Erza

Meng Wu Ya didn’t realize that while he was speaking his eyes were starting to blur because of dishes in front of him. And when he woke up, time had passed, a long long long time had passed.

The dishes were full of a certain compounding drug made by Xia Ning Chang. Being plotted against by his own beloved disciple, Meng Wu Ya wanted to cry but didn’t have any tears. Losing so shamelessly he realized that something was not right. Meng Wu Ya was so worried about his disciple that he didn’t even think about washing his face. He directly rushed from Sky Tower pavilion to the valley at full speed.

He had felt extremely regretful this morning, knowing that the image of Kai Yang in front of his disciple was so good and he was inexpensively violating her image of Kai Yang, wasn’t this asking for trouble?

Although his disciple had a lot of treasures on her and could easily avoid many dangers, here in Black Wind Mountain, there are a lot of formidable demonic beasts, if she wasn’t careful wasn’t there a chance of her being eaten?

If he would have been with her, there wouldn’t be any need to worry about these things. Bad mouth, Bad mouth, Meng Wu Ya wished he could slap himself on face several times.

From a place ten miles away from where Nine Yin Dew Crystal gathered, Meng Wu Ya was able to feel the coldness transmitting from that side. He stopped in mid air and looked around anxiously.

He saw that in the mountain Valley Yin Qi was trapped by an invisible energy field and was unable to escape. After seeing this Meng Wu Ya’s heart finally relaxed. The Nine Clouds Eight Lock seal has been activated, that means my disciple arrived here safely.

Loudly exhaling.........it doesn’t look like there is any trouble. Meng Wu Ya gasped heavily, god only knows that for the past few days while hurrying along how anxious he felt, as if something had gone horribly wrong.

After a little while, Meng Wu Ya arrived outside the mountain valley, but he didn’t go in. With rapt attention he was looking towards the mountain valley. But the density of Yin Qi inside was too high and he was unable to see or hear anything, even his divine senses were unable to search inside.

Since the Nine Cloud Eight Lock seal had been activated, this means that his disciple must have started the process, he should just calmly wait for the good news, for her success. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Because of the law’s binding, people on the inside were unable to come out and people on the outside were unable to go inside. Although Meng Wu Ya was able to break this seal, but if he broke it all the efforts of his apprentice would be for nothing. Meng Wu Ya comforted himself while waiting on the outside.

He didn’t know this time he was making a big mistake. The reason that Xia Ning Chang activated the seal ahead of time was not to cope with Nine Yin Dew crystals but rather to deal with people from the Blood Group who wanted to kill them. Meng Wu Ya had no idea that at present his beloved disciple was very weak and that Kai Yang was bathed in blood and fighting off a huge crisis.

If he knew this he would definitely not hesitate to break open this seal and slaughter Wen Fei Chen a hundred times over. ***** Dares to harm this old man’s disciple, F**k your eighteen generations of ancestors. Sometimes it looks like something is very close but it is actually very far, just like the horizon.

In mountain valley Kai Yang was standing still with a straight back just like a javelin calmly waiting for the enemies to come. Whiz whiz whiz......suddenly the sound of clothes fluttering in the wind could be heard from all around.

“They finally came.” Kai Yang’s face turned solemn. Turning his head to look in the direction of Xia Ning Chang’s hiding place, he didn’t know if after this battle he could still survive.

But....after making this decision, he had no regret.

Brush brush.......three figures almost simultaneously appeared around Kai Yang.

These three were the Blood Group’s separation and reunion boundary masters. The last one to arrive was a Qi transformation stage ninth level practitioner. So compared with others his speed was slow.

After arriving these four people were quietly staring at Kai Yang with shocked expressions. Because they had seen Kai Yang just an hour ago and at that time he was at the initial element fourth level yet in such a short time he had reached the initial element stage peak.

What’s going on?

Nu Lang’s corpse was lying under his foot with a broken neck and his body in a pitiful state. They hadn’t thought that he would die in a place like this. They felt slightly sorry for him. On this cold night, the wind blowing in this mountain valley made people feel unnerved, it was creepy.

“Was this person killed by you?” A Blood Group separation and reunion boundary master asked.

“Where’s your leader and Master Long?” Kai Yang asked without answering his question, turning his head and looking around but he didn’t discover anyone else coming.

The Blood Group had seven people remaining when they arrived at the valley, including Wen Fei Chen and Long Hui. One was killed by Xia Ning Chang so the only remaining members were these four.

“Hmph, to cope with you why must Lord Wen and master Long personally take action?” The person who spoke, his age was not large, from his appearance he should be around 25-26 years old.

“Ohhhh...help me, the Blood Group are here, I am so scared.” Kai Yang said in a sarcastic voice.

(TL: Man this MC is funny)

The youth’s face became ruthless, “To cope with you I alone am enough.”

Although most of his strength was sealed by the Yin Qi Chains, he still was a master of the separation and reunion boundary and if he fought he would be stronger than a Qi Transforming stage master, how would he be unable to cope with Kai Yang.

“Lips are useless, why not use fist to find out the answer?” Kai Yang said looking at him scornfully.

Kai Yang also felt that the strength of these people had been reduced greatly. Their strength was nothing compared to before. Moreover the World Qi in their bodies was quite unstable, the strength of the first three was comparable to Nu Lang, even if they were strong before, at present they were not, and the person who came last was even weaker than Nu Lang had been.

In a one on one with them Kai Yang was confident he could win, even in this situation as long as he kills one first, then everything would be easy to manage.

“Boy, you are quite arrogant, let this grandfather give you a lesson!” The youth who had spoken before walked forward while saying this.

Seeing that his plan was a success, as long as this youth came within ten feet of Kai Yang, then even if Kai Yang was injured, he was confident in being able to kill him. But at this time, another separation and reunion boundary master said, “Long division younger brother, don’t get tricked by him.”

At this moment that youth suddenly stopped his steps and looked coldly at Kai Yang and said, “Yes Cai senior brother.”

“At this place he is standing alone, and we don’t know the location of that female’s hiding place. That female has got many tricks up her sleeves. Do not be too impulsive, moreover this boy has already shown he has enough strength to kill Nu Lang, it looks like he was playing the role of a pig to eat the tiger. Let’s take him down fast and get the location of that female.” Senior Cai said looking vigilant and waving his hands he said, “Let’s get him!”

Four vs one, moreover his strength was at the initial element boundary, even if he had the strength to overturn the heavens ,if he was able to use his power, he could only be caught.

Four people almost simultaneously moved like shadows from the east, west, north and south surrounding Kai Yang and sending killing intent towards him.

Faced with this impending crisis, Kai Yang felt no fear, laughing he said, “Well looks like your Blood Group is only talk, and it looks like you are not too confident in your strength.”

Hearing this that youth’s complexion became red, releasing his killing intent he said, “Smelly brat, just wait and this grandfather will help you break your mouth.”
