“Then keep your mouth shut!” Wu Chang snapped, unafraid of Xiao Chen in the slightest, despite the latter being an elite disciple from the Southern Territory’s overlord, Star Soul Palace.

To Wu Chang, there were only two kinds of people in this world.

Those who were stronger than him and those who were weaker!

Masters may be able to win his respect, or arouse his fighting spirit, but the weak... he disdained them, regardless of their origins.

Being slapped across the face by Wu Chang like this, Xiao Chen found himself unable to simply back down and said with a gloomy expression, “You should be thankful that this Xiao has a heavy responsibility this time, otherwise, he would have taken your dog life long ago!”

The important task he was referring to was naturally to protect Princess Lan Xun.

Wu Chang sneered and didn’t bother speaking with him again.

During these two’s brief conversation, many other cultivators had arrived in front of the temple, each one of them staking out a good spot and looking up at the huge and magnificent building before them, a humbling feeling filling their hearts.

“Friends, what do you think?”

Suddenly, a person stepped out from the crowd and stood before Wu Chang and the others without fear, glanced around, and asked, “How should we go about breaking this golden barrier?”

This man had a dignified appearance and a seemingly mild temperament. He looked as if he was about thirty years old and was dressed in black robes, giving him an aura that made him look capable and refined. The energy fluctuations radiating from his body also indicated he was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator.

“Kong Qi? You were here too?” Xiao Chen looked at this person and narrowed his eyes, apparently recognizing him.

The young man named Kong Qi smiled slightly and said, “Why can’t I be here? My Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce has a number of entry quotas to the Four Seasons Realm, does it now? Brother Xiao’s question is quite strange.”

Hearing what he said, Yang Kai immediately understood that this young man named Kong Qi was a rising star of the Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce.

Although Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce and Violet Source Chamber of Commerce focused mainly on business, that did not mean these two great forces lacked strength or Masters. On the contrary, the heritage of these two giant chambers of commerce was no worse than any other top-level Sect.

The world simply had a prejudice in its thinking about these two forces, imagining that they were weak compared to Sects that focused on cultivation.

“From what this Kong can see, this should be a powerful barrier Spirit Array. Is there any friend here who is proficient in Spirit Arrays who can examine it?” Kong Qi suggested. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“In the face of absolute power, any barrier is nothing, we just need to smash it!” A cold snort rang out as Luo Yuan took the initiative. Leaping up into the air, he lifted his arms and summoned a battle-axe into his grip. Pouring his Source Qi madly into his artifact, Luo Yuan condensed the surrounding Principles around his blade, causing the ambient World Energy to tumble fiercely, releasing a coercion that caused many present to pale.

Even someone as strong as Wu Chang wore a slightly solemn expression as he could feel a threat from Luo Yuan’s strike.

“Eight Paths Sect really found itself a true monster!” Lan Xun commented as a pale blue light flickered around her body, offsetting the pressure from the rolling World Energy.

Before now, she was still somewhat doubtful a small Sect that was barely considered middle-class in the Southern Territory could actually cultivate such a talent. Even in Star Soul Palace, such geniuses were rare.

[No wonder he dared to challenge Wu Chang without flinching. With such amazing strength, he indeed has the capital to act arrogant.]

*Kacha...*

In front of everyone’s eyes, Luo Yuan’s arm holding up his battle axe seemed to swell suddenly, his muscles pulsing with a kind of raw and violent force.

Slowly, the glow from his battle-axe increased in intensity as the energy fluctuations radiating from it doubled in frequency.

This channelling occurred five more times, causing the space around Luo Yuan to creak under the terrifying energy fluctuations. Wu Chang and the others who were close to the front even found their footing becoming a bit unstable.

As for the cultivators with slightly lower strength, they had been forced to withdraw as their faces paled.

Everyone was wondering in their hearts what the result would be if such a blow hit them.

Yang Kai’s eyes flickered as he too was shocked by Luo Yuan’s actions, but he also knew that such an attack could not be performed in real combat because it took far too long to accumulate energy and no enemy would give Luo Yuan so much time to prepare himself. What’s more, delivering such an intense attack would no doubt put a heavy load on Luo Yuan and require an immense amount of concentration to execute.

Yang Kai understood this, and there were many others present who did as well, such as Wu Chang, Xiao Chen, Xiao Bai Yi and Lan Xun.

“HA!”

Suddenly, Luo Yuan roared and hurled his battle-axe, sending it out in a stream of light that had a Heaven-destroying and Earth-shattering power contained within it towards the golden barrier.

At that moment, everyone held their breath and watched quietly.

*Hong...*

A brilliant radiance burst forth as the stream of energy impacted the golden barrier, causing it to depress somewhat, but... it also showed no signs of breaking.

In the next instant, the golden barrier bounced back and reflected the battle axe’s attack at an even faster speed than it had been delivered, sending it streaking back Luo Yuan’s side and even managing to cut off several strands of his black hair.

Luo Yuan reached out and touched his cheek, where a finger-length wound had appeared along with fresh blood.

“En, it seems that brute force cannot be used to break this barrier,” Kong Qi said lightly, “It is reasonable considering this is a barrier created by a peak-level Emperor Realm Master!”

He did not taunt Luo Yuan in the slightest. Although Luo Yuan’s behaviour had been reckless, he had also proved with practical actions that this barrier was not breakable through brute force.

“Princess...” Xiao Chen suddenly turned his head to look at Lan Xun and called out inquiringly.

Lan Xun shook her head. “I haven’t seen anything of use yet, so I cannot be certain...”

Xiao Chen nodded lightly and said, “Princess should act with a free hand.”

Lan Xun didn’t reply, her beautiful eyes just staring forward. From her demeanour and posture, it seemed she had some knowledge of Spirit Arrays and was currently looking for a weakness in this barrier.

At that moment, Kong Qi turned and swept his eyes over the crowd, “Friends, is there anyone who is proficient in Spirit Arrays who can come up and examine this barrier? As I’m sure everyone knows by now, this should be the legendary Flowing Time Temple. As long as we can crack this barrier, we shall be able to get inside and explore the wonders of this place while possibly obtaining incredible benefits! If there is someone of high skill here who is capable of assisting us, please do not conceal yourself!”

Of the more than thirty people present, no one stepped forward to answer this call.

The Dao of Spirit Arrays, like the Alchemic Dao, was broad and profound, a profession easy to tread upon, but extremely difficult to master.

Everyone present was a Dao Source Realm cultivator, so each had some knowledge of Spirit Arrays, but who would have the confidence to crack the barrier arranged by an Emperor Realm Master?

Following a brief silence, Kong Qi smiled lightly and turned to a certain individual in the crowd before calling out, “Brother Gong, why don’t you come and try?”

Everyone heard this and quickly cast their eyes towards this man just in time to see him put on a depressed look as he glared towards Kong Qi.

“Surnamed Gong... could he be...”

“He must be someone from the Heavenly River Valley’s Gong Family... So that’s how it is!”

“Ha, it seems there is hope to break this barrier now.”

Numerous cultivators all began to whisper about this man surnamed Gong.

“Who is he?” Yang Kai asked in a low voice, “Why does everyone seem to have such confidence in him?”

Bian Yu Qing smiled at him and quipped, “Are you asking me?”

She assumed the stance of one who had finally caught an opportunity and was clearly planning to blackmail Yang Kai.

“Do as you please!” Yang Kai snorted.

Bian Yu Qing squinted her eyes before muttering, “Little boy, this Protector suddenly discovered that... you’re quite hateful!”

“Hmph, that depends on who I’m talking to.”

Kou Wu punctually interrupted, “The Gong Family is famous throughout the Southern Territory, not for its strength, but for its proficiency in Spirit Arrays. No one who comes from the Gong Family should be underestimated, especially their Old Ancestor who is an Emperor Array Master. Regarding Spirit Arrays, the Gong Family’ Old Ancestor can stand among the top three in the entire Southern Territory... As for this person though, if I remember correctly, he should be the current Young Master of the Gong Family, Gong Wen Shan.”

“En, I understand,” Yang Kai nodded.

Kou Wu was correct. The one who had been caught by the crowd was Young Master Gong Wen Shan of the Gong Family. Although Gong Wen Shan’s cultivation wasn’t too high, only Second-Order Dao Source Realm, when it came to proficiency in the Dao of Spirit Arrays, everyone present put together would probably be inferior to him.

The Gong Family had studied Spirit Arrays for generations.

At this moment, Gong Wen Shan’s face was as wrinkled as a bitter gourd. Stepping forward under everyone’s eyes, he muttered to himself, “Damn it... I obviously just wanted to explore around and have some fun, so why did I have to encounter such a troublesome matter... If I refuse, it will definitely provoke public anger, and the ones here won’t give a shit about my name... Ha... so annoying, Kong Qi that bastard, one day I’ll make him swallow his own shit and then commit suicide!”

Kong Qi stood to the side, his mouth twitching as he said, “Brother Gong... Don’t you think you should act a bit more prudently... everyone can hear what you’re saying...”

Gong Wen Shan wrinkled his bitter melon face further as he snorted towards Kong Qi, “I said it so you could hear it, what of it!”

Kong Qi didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, but in this situation, he could only wave his hand and said, “Brother Gong, forgive me, but no one else present is proficient in Spirit Arrays, all our hopes rest with you.”

Gong Wen Shan snorted, “You and I have been acquainted for several dozen years, so you should know my temper!”

Kong Qi nodded repeatedly, “Yes, yes, I know you hate troublesome things the most...”

“Cracking the barrier of an Emperor is the most troublesome thing in this world!” Gong Wen Shan’s face went so cold one could almost see frost coming off of it. As he walked up to the golden light barrier, he glanced back and forth a few times before turning around and declaring, “Good, it’s not impossible for me to crack it, but what benefits can I obtain?”

“Benefits...” Kong Qi’s brow twitched, wondering what other benefits aside from the legendary treasures inside Gong Wen Shan wanted. For a moment, he didn’t know what to say.

“How about keeping your life, is that a big enough benefit?” Wu Chang suddenly interjected.

Gong Wen Shan immediately turned his head and stared at him, a sneer forming on his lips as he asked, “Oh? Are you threatening me?”

Wu Chang snorted, “If you break this barrier, you can live, if you refuse or fail, I’ll make you die here and now!”

From his solemn tone, it was clear Wu Chang wasn’t just making an idle threat.

No one thought he was joking either; after all, it was Wu Chang who was speaking.

“Interesting...” Even when facing Wu Chang, however, Gong Wen Shan didn’t show the slightest fear, instead his eyes just flashing slightly, indicating he was not someone with a weak spine.
