Chapter 5536: The Rise of the Profound Nether Army

The Humans were astonished while the Black Ink Clan was in an uproar. At that instant, the already tense atmosphere became even tenser.

Wei Jun Yang secretly relayed his order for the soldiers behind him to get ready for battle.

Although all the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were on board with Yang Kai’s plan and thought that it was feasible, no one could be sure it would work until it actually did.

If the Black Ink Clan were so enraged by Yang Kai’s provocation that they decided not to endure anymore, the battle today would be inevitable.

Judging by their current situation, the Human Race and Black Ink Clan would have a hard time in the battle because, as Yang Kai said, it hadn’t been long since the previous battle, and both sides still needed time to recuperate.

While the Human Race were secretly arranging their next move, the commotion on the Black Ink Clan’s side was growing louder with even the Territory Lords having gloomy expressions while yelling things like “How dare he?” and “courting death.”

[How arrogant is this Human? Not only did he come here with a single Warship, he even dares to boast so shamelessly! He clearly disdains us Territory Lords entirely!]

Though the Territory Lords admitted that this Eighth-Order Human was indeed very powerful, it didn’t mean they would accept any audacious request he made without reasonable grounds.

If they did, how could the Territory Lords continue to command the soldiers below them? What would their subordinates think of them?

The leader of the bunch, Six Arms, had a dark expression as he stared at Yang Kai while gritting his teeth, “Do you Humans like to joke about such things?”

Yang Kai remained calm, “Do I look like I’m joking?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Six Arms frowned because he thought Yang Kai was really joking and just using this opportunity to show off his prestige and weaken the Black Ink Clan’s morale, but after careful observation, Six Arms discovered that this Human didn’t seem like he was pulling a poor prank and was sincerely asking them to grant him an easement. Enraged, Six Arms roared, “Impudence!”

Yang Kai casually retorted, “I’m only asking for an easement that wouldn’t cost the Black Ink Clan anything, why are you getting so riled up?”

Hearing that, Six Arms was even more furious. If Yang Kai only wanted easement, the Black Ink Clan naturally wouldn’t suffer any losses, but if they agreed to this request, wouldn’t that be admitting that they were afraid of the Humans? That would be a great blow to the already weak morale of the Black Ink Clan Army.

No matter what, they couldn’t agree to such an outrageous request.

In fact, if the sides were reversed, the Humans wouldn’t grant the Black Ink Clan easement either.

“What if I refuse?” Six Arms asked coldly.

Without saying anything, Yang Kai summoned the Army Commander Token. In an instant, the token glowed and illuminated the void. Then, Yang Kai used his strength to carry his voice throughout the void, “If the Black Ink Clan still won’t let us through after one incense stick’s time, the entire Profound Nether Army and Black Ink Clan will… fight to the death!”

The token floated above Dawning Light, and Yang Kai stood arrogantly on the deck while his voice, boosted by his World Force, sounded deafeningly loud.

The Human Race Army was shocked for a moment before they immediately began chanting so loudly that it felt like the entire Profound Nether Territory would shake apart.

“War! War! War!”

“Kill! Kill! Kill!”

Once the Army Commander Token appeared, no one among the hundreds of thousands of troops in the Profound Nether Army dared to disobey.

It was only now that the Humans learned that the Profound Nether Army had a new Army Commander. Wei Jun Yang was the de-facto Army Commander of the Profound Nether Army before, and though his performance was average at best during the several decades of war, he was at least able to maintain Profound Nether Territory.

But when comparing the two, obviously this new Army Commander was bolder and more courageous.

He had just been appointed and had already made such a big move. That was something the older and more prudent Wei Jun Yang would find difficult to do.

With such an Army Commander overseeing Profound Nether Territory, the Black Ink Clan would no longer have easy days.

“Young Master is the Army Commander?”

Aboard the Bi Xi Warship, Yue He was dumbfounded.

Meanwhile, Yu Ru Meng and the others were all shocked as well. Their Husband was the Army Commander? They had no idea about this and hadn’t received any news of this matter. Moreover, Yang Kai didn’t even tell them about this.

But while looking at the figure enveloped by the token’s halo, who was also the centre of everyone’s attention, all the Madams felt an inexplicable sense of pride.

That was their man!

“Profound Nether Army’s Army Commander!” When the Army Commander Token was summoned, Six Arm’s eyes immediately lit up.

The Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master who had suddenly appeared in Profound Nether Territory was actually the Profound Nether Army’s Army Commander!

If Six Arms could kill this Human before the Human Race Army moved, that would be a crushing blow to the enemy’s morale.

A sudden urge began to fill his heart as his gaze turned vicious while staring at Yang Kai.

Not only Six Arms, but many other Territory Lords had similar thoughts. At that moment, several Divine Senses surged as the Territory Lords began secretly discussing their next move.

Six Arms soon suppressed such thoughts though while sending a warning to the other Territory Lords to not make any rash moves. This Human before them wasn’t easy to deal with, and if they acted on impulse, they might be the ones killed rather than their opponent, which clearly wasn’t worth it.

Since this Human had summoned the Army Commander Token before the eyes of the two armies, he might have something planned.

While suppressing the anger and ambition inside him, Six Arms said through gritted teeth, “If you Humans want to start a war, so be it…”

[Do you think the Black Ink Clan is afraid?] Since they were forced to this point, no matter how reluctant Six Arms and the other Territory Lords were, a clash between the clans was inevitable.

When Six Arms finished his words, he suddenly stopped and frowned because he could sense another Divine Sense surging inside the void.

It seemed like someone was contacting Six Arms.

Yang Kai smiled as he swept his gaze across all the Territory Lords and finally fixed his gaze on a figure that was enveloped by a dark shadow.

It was another Territory Lord, but he seemed like a shadow and was neither real nor illusory, which was quite strange.

As if sensing Yang Kai’s gaze, the pair of eyes amidst the dark shadow glanced back at him.

A short while later, Six Arms had a strange expression on his face when he raised his head to look at Yang Kai. The anger he felt had disappeared entirely, and he asked with a frown, “Are you only looking for easement?”

“What else can I ask for?” Yang Kai asked him back.

Six Arms coldly snorted and said, “Even if we offered you this easement, do you have the courage to take it?”

The Territory Gate was located behind the Black Ink Clan’s base camp, so if the Humans wanted to go through it, they would have to pass through the Black Ink Clan Army. Weren’t the Humans afraid they might walk into a death trap?

“You’ll know the answer after you accept,” Yang Kai looked at Six Arms with a slight smile.

Though Six Arms was strong, he didn’t have the sharpest mind. In contrast to him, the Territory Lord who looked like a shadow was a quick thinker.

It was the shadow Territory Lord who had contacted Six Arms just now and made him forget about his decision to fight the Humans.

Just like how Yang Kai had persuaded all the Eighth-Order Masters at the Main Conference Hall, that shadow Territory Lord might have realised that Yang Kai’s departure from Profound Nether Territory would benefit the Black Ink Clan.

[Perhaps… they might still be thinking about suddenly launching an attack after I’m halfway inside their territory.]

That was something Yang Kai had to be prepared for. Even though he was sure the Black Ink Clan would likely agree to grant an easement, he couldn’t be sure that they would be able to hold back their urge to kill him.

If that happened, there would definitely be a huge battle today!

However, it didn’t matter if things came to that because Yang Kai had considered such a scenario. He could just kill a few more Territory Lords and bring Dawn to escape any ambush set up at the Territory Gate.

He had a 2 million strong Small Stone Race Army on hand, which was his trump card to use against the last Royal Lord. Although it would be a waste to use them here against mere Territory Lords, Yang Kai wouldn’t be stingy when faced with a critical situation.

After all, Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan were still nurturing the Small Stone Race in the Chaotic Dead Territory, so he could just head there and ‘borrow’ some more after a few hundred years.

Therefore, he had nothing to be afraid of!

The two pairs of eyes met each other, one looking sincere while the other seemed doubtful.

A long while later, Six Arms sneered, “Since you claim to have the guts, prove it!” While saying so, he waved his hand, “Let them through!”

Once that order was given, the Black Ink Clan Army gathered in front, separated to both sides and left a narrow path towards the Territory Gate.

The scene stunned the Human Race Army.

When Yang Kai said he wanted to pass through the Territory Gate, everyone thought he was just taking this opportunity to provoke the Black Ink Clan and suppress their momentum; after all, how could the Black Ink Clan agree to such a humiliating request?

Though puzzled, the Human Race and Black Ink Clan had a blood feud, so since both sides had gathered their troops, they would just start another battle. The stronger and the weaker side would be determined after the fighting was finished, so what was the use of such provocation?

However, who would have thought that the Black Ink Clan would agree to such an absurd request and let Yang Kai pass?

[What’s happening? Did the lead Territory Lord lose his mind? Doesn’t he know that agreeing to the request is a big blow to their army’s momentum?]

No matter what the Black Ink Clan were thinking, the Humans were elated.

The Black Ink Clan had given in!

Yang Kai alone had managed to threaten the Black Ink Clan to compromise to this extent. This was something no one had ever seen or even heard of before.

Although they didn’t attack or kill any Black Ink Clansmen today, the current situation was better than slaughtering a couple of Territory Lords!

Before Yang Kai’s arrival in Profound Nether Territory, the situation here wasn’t looking good. They were constantly at war, and the Humans were in an extremely passive situation. Moreover, they would suffer quite a significant loss after every battle.

Profound Nether Territory was almost lost during the last battle.

Now, they had such a new, powerful Army Commander who could ask for an easement from the Black Ink Clan alone and with only a single Warship. Though the Black Ink Clan had snarled viciously, they still compromised in the end.

The hundreds of thousands of Human soldiers looked at the figure above the deck of Dawning Light and couldn’t help but feel astonished. That figure… seemed so high and mighty.

Profound Nether Army had risen!

Once the excitement had died down, the Humans quickly became worried because even the dumbest among them knew that Yang Kai was about to face a life-or-death crisis.

If the Black Ink Clan suddenly decided to attack, Yang Kai and Dawning Light would be utterly surrounded.

Despite their preparations for war, no one could be sure that the Humans could save Yang Kai from the Black Ink Clan’s besiegement in time.

On top of the Bi Xi Warship, Yu Ru Meng and the others felt their hearts leap into their throats.

Their Husband was still so reckless, but they could do anything about it. They could only support their Husband, but… could they stand to watch him battle the enemy alone? Though they were women, they weren’t weaklings.

Ever since they met Yang Kai, they had mostly lived apart. Although that didn’t affect their relationship, these Wives were thoroughly fed up with waiting at home and not knowing whether their Husband would return alive.

If he was destined to die, they wanted to die with him.

Wasn’t living and dying together the best ending for Husbands and Wives?
