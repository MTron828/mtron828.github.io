“Are you deaf or what? Get your foot off me!” Madam Hua bellowed.

“Shut up!” Yang Kai used his Emperor Qi to slap her in the face.

Madam Hua was dumbfounded after she was slapped as she felt her cheek swelling rapidly. Although she had been injured by Yang Kai, it was due to the fact that she was no match for him. However, this slap in her face was a direct humiliation to her, “How dare you…”

*Pa…*

Yang Kai gave her another slap, after which the other side of her face became swollen as well. In an instant, blood started streaming out of her mouth. Glowering at Yang Kai, she decided to keep her mouth shut for now. She realized that this young man, who had been quiet earlier, was a thug. The more she tried to talk back, the harder he would slap her. Naturally, she wouldn’t want to suffer grievances anymore, so she could only hope that the Dragon Clan member would arrive quickly and bring justice to her.

Just then, a beam of red light appeared and approached at incredible speed. Seeing that, Lu San Niang’s tender body started trembling as her face turned pale.

She tried to rack her brain to come up with an explanation she could use when she met this Dragon Clan member; however, there really weren’t any great ideas. What awaited all three of them was this Dragon’s wrath.

With this thought in mind, she stretched out her hands and pulled Lu Yu Qin into an embrace. Since they were all doomed, she wanted to spend her last moments with her daughter in an intimate manner.

Unexpectedly, the beam of red light flew past their heads and headed to the other side of the Spirit Island. Both Lu San Niang and Madam Hua were startled, but a moment later, Madam Hua’s face turned ashen as she shouted, “Sir! Help!”

Thinking that the Dragon Clan member didn’t see that she was being bullied, she hurriedly shouted to attract his attention. Seeing that, Yang Kai snorted.

Suddenly, the beam of red light stopped in mid-air, “Hm?”

Following that, he turned his gaze downwards, but his pupils contracted when he saw what was going on.

Appearing quite wretched, Madam Hua wailed again, “Sir, save me!”

The Dragon Clan member turned around and transformed into a beam of red light again. In the blink of an eye, he landed on the ground as he stared fixedly at Yang Kai.

Lu San Niang’s face was transformed by terror as she felt the Dragon Pressure wafting from this Dragon. Knowing that there was no chance they could survive, she secretly sized up the Dragon Clan member and realized that he appeared about the same age as Yang Kai. His gaze was clear, and his red hair was conspicuous.

What shocked her was that the Dragon Pressure of this red-haired man was on par with that of Fu Chi, which meant that he was an Eighth-Order Dragon.

[We’re doomed.] Lu San Niang felt the world around her spinning as she was on the brink of passing out.

“Senior Zhu Lie, please help me!” Madam Hua, who was still being stepped on by Yang Kai, called out to the Dragon Clan member for the third time.

It was then Zhu Lie turned to look at her and asked dispassionately, “You know me?”

All the Dragon Clan members lived separately, and they rarely contacted each other, which was why these women, who had been living on Dragon Island for centuries, couldn’t possibly recognize all the Dragon Clan members. However, since this woman knew him, it was apparent that her identity was a little different.

Madam Hua hurriedly said, “I had the pleasure of seeing Sir once from afar, and I’ve always remembered you since then.”

After giving it a thought, Zhu Lie nodded lightly, “I see. You’re Fu Chi’s woman.”

In response, Madam Hua nodded, “Yes!”

“What’s going on?” Zhu Lie frowned and shot Yang Kai a look. He felt his head aching because he didn’t expect that he would come across Yang Kai here. [This guy is so bold by coming to Dragon Island. Moreover, he happens to be on Fu Chi’s island. Did he get wind of the news?]

If that were the case, it would be bad news because he had experienced how reckless Yang Kai could be previously. If this matter wasn’t handled properly, it would be a massive trouble for the Dragon Clan.

Madam Hua hurriedly said, “Sir, this is what happened.” She appeared to be pitiful as she explained the situation to him in a choking voice, “The pet I’ve kept for more than ten years had been hurt by these people, so I came over here to get an explanation from them; however, I didn’t expect that he’d be so unreasonable! Not only did he refuse to admit his wrongdoing, but he also laid a hand on us! We’ve not fought for many years, so naturally, we were no match for him. After we were humiliated, I begged him for mercy, but not only was he not willing to let us go, but he also intended to kill me! Sir, please stand up for us!”

As she spoke, she started crying her heart out, as though she was a young girl that had been bullied.

With a dark expression, Zhu Lie stared at Yang Kai and thought to himself, [What’s wrong with him? How is he able to cause trouble wherever he goes?]

Naturally, he wouldn’t believe Madam Hua, as he knew that Yang Kai wasn’t a man who would use his strength against others for no reason.

As Madam Hua examined Zhu Lie’s expression, she went on to slander Yang Kai further, “Sir, please look! It’s obvious that he has no regard for you at all. He’s still so arrogant in front of you, stepping on me with no regard for your presence! When you weren’t around just now, he…” She continued sobbing.

Flustered, Lu San Niang said, “Sir, that’s not true!”

Madam Hua naturally said nothing about how she had acted haughty just moments ago. Worse still, she shifted all the blame to Yang Kai. Lu San Niang was worried that Zhu Lie would buy her story and then harm Yang Kai. At this point, only she could step forward to explain the situation on Yang Kai’s behalf.

Without even looking at her, Zhu Lie said coldly, “You have no right to speak here.”

He appeared to be in a bad mood, which explained why he treated Lu San Niang harshly. Hearing that, Lu San Niang kept her mouth shut, her expression anxious.

After a sigh, Zhu Lie gazed at Yang Kai and said, “It’s inappropriate that you’re stepping on her. Release her first. You’re a man, aren’t you?”

With a cold expression, Yang Kai raised his chin and stared at Zhu Lie in a conceited manner.

In an instant, Zhu Lie was infuriated. He and Yang Kai were already on bad terms; moreover, Zhu Qing suffered grievances previously exactly because of Yang Kai. Considering all these, he was enraged as he growled, “Release her!”

Seeing that, Madam Hua regained confidence and said through gritted teeth, “How dare you still be so presumptuous in front of a Dragon Clan member! Who do you think you are? Get your stinky foot off me right now!”

Right after she finished speaking, she groaned in pain. Apparently, Yang Kai had exerted more force with his leg. Instantly, Madam Hua’s expression turned from haughty to pained as her forehead was beaded with sweat, her eyelashes fluttering as she stared at Yang Kai in fear.

[He still dares to hurt me in front of a Dragon Clan member? Is he out of his mind?] Despite the pain she was going through, she still felt gleeful, for she knew that Yang Kai could never get away with such an insult. She was Fu Chi’s woman, so Zhu Lie would certainly stand up for her for the humiliation she had suffered.

At that moment, she could envision Yang Kai on his knees as he begged Zhu Lie to let him go, but he was still murdered in the end. With this thought in mind, she put on a triumphant smile.

“Oh, you’re talking to me?” Appearing to be unfazed, Yang Kai started picking his ear.

Hearing what he just said, Lu San Niang and Madam Hua were dumbstruck. Although they knew that he was bold, they didn’t expect that he was this brazen. It was akin to asking for death when he talked to a Dragon Clan member like this.

Worried that Yang Kai might not understand how terrifying the Dragon Clan could be, Lu San Niang kept hinting at Yang Kai with her gaze. The Dragon Clan was the leader of all Divine Spirits, and the person before their eyes was an Eighth-Order Dragon who could kill Yang Kai without needing any effort.

At that moment, she felt that Yang Kai was practically walking on a tightrope between two mountains. If he wasn’t careful enough, he would fall and lose his life. However, what shocked her was that Zhu Lie didn’t immediately make a move.

Exasperated, Zhu Lie questioned, “What do you want?”

“Nothing. I just want justice to be done.” Yang Kai sneered.

After taking a look at Madam Hua, Zhu Lie uttered, “She’s Fu Chi’s woman, and Fu Chi is an Eighth-Order Dragon. If you kill this woman, he won’t let you off.”

“Just tell him to come at me if he has the guts.”

Zhu Lie growled, “You arrogant bastard!”

In an instant, Yang Kai’s expression turned cold, “Mind your language. Otherwise, I’ll beat you too.”

[H-He wants to beat him up?] Lu San Niang was startled as she widened her eyes.

Madam Hua yelled, “Sir, stop wasting time with him! This man clearly has no regard for the Dragon Clan at all! Please kill him right away!”

With the corner of Zhu Lie’s mouth twitching, he stared at Madam Hua as though she was a fool. If he was provoked by someone else like this, he would have already made a move, for he wouldn’t allow anyone to violate the Dragon Clan’s majesty. However, he was now confronted by Yang Kai, so there was nothing he could do.

It was because he was also no match for Yang Kai, as proven in their previous battles. He would only be able to deal with Yang Kai if he went to Dragon Temple to receive its blessing first, but he didn’t have the time to do that now. Moreover, in his heart, he was biased towards Yang Kai. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Although he wasn’t fond of Yang Kai, Madam Hua was just an insignificant ant in his eyes. The reason he persuaded Yang Kai to release her was that he didn’t want to make things worse to the point where the problem couldn’t be solved anymore. It wasn’t possible for him to fight against Yang Kai just to save Madam Hua.

Extremely anxious, Lu San Niang looked worriedly at Yang Kai. She could never have imagined that Yang Kai would still act so overbearing when he was facing a real Dragon. What puzzled her more though was that Zhu Lie didn’t seem to have the intention of making a move. [When did the Dragon Clan become so gentle? He’s been provoked by Yang Kai several times, but he still has done nothing in response.]

Zhu Lie’s behaviour completely changed Lu San Niang’s understanding of the Dragon Clan. As far as she understood, the Dragon Clan was a bunch of hot-headed people who were ready to kill whenever they felt displeased.

All of a sudden, Zhu Lie turned his head and stared in another direction, a dark expression filling his face as he commented, “Fu Chi is coming.”

“Sir is coming?” Madam Hua was elated upon hearing that. Her cultivation was weak, and she didn’t have any Dragon Vein at all, which was why she couldn’t detect the distant Dragon Aura. However, since Zhu Lie had said so, Fu Chi was certainly on his way.

Zhu Lie uttered, “I think he’s worried because he can sense that I’m here, which is why he’s coming over now.”

Hearing that, Yang Kai asked curiously, “Are there any grudges between you two?”

Zhu Lie looked away and replied impassively, “Not really. However, you’ll form a grudge with him soon.”

Upon finishing his words, he shot a look at the woman beneath Yang Kai’s foot.

At that moment, Madam Hua became hubristic again. Although she was unhappy that Zhu Lie didn’t stand up for her immediately, there was nothing she was afraid of now because Fu Chi was coming. She just had to tell Fu Chi what happened, after which Yang Kai, Lu San Niang, and her daughter wouldn’t be able to see the next sunrise.
