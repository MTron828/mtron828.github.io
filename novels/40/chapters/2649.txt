“Yun’er, Xiu’er, Yao’er!” Bing Yun called out softly in a tired voice.

“Disciple is here!” An Ruo Yun, Sun Yun Xiu, and Ji Yao stepped forward together. The three of them were the Bing Yun’s earliest Disciples, and they were the only three Second-Order Emperor Realm Masters in Ice Heart Valley.

“Send the disciples away through the Space Array, I will stay here and delay the enemy for as long as possible.”

The three women exchanged difficult looks hearing this command, and in the end, An Ruo Yun replied, “Honoured Master, it’s not that we do not wish to follow your orders, but… I’m afraid none of the disciples are willing to leave.”

The remaining seven thousand disciples in Ice Heart Valley were mostly orphans who were brought back to Ice Heart Valley at a young age where they cultivated and were carefully taken care of since childhood. To them, Ice Heart Valley was the only home they had ever known, so none of them wanted to leave when their family was facing disaster.

It could be said that in the entire Northern Territory and even the entire Star Boundary, there was no Sect that could match the internal unity of Ice Heart Valley.

A few days ago, An Ruo Yun and the other Elders had made arrangements to send some disciples out of Ice Heart Valley in advance, but it turned out that none of the disciples were willing to go, and they all expressed their intention to either live or die with the Sect.

“They still have to leave even if they don’t want to, we have to save as many as we can.” Bing Yun ordered sternly, “Make arrangements now. Take your most trusted disciples away from the Northern Territory as far as possible.”

The three women did not move, all of them looking sad but also determined.

Watching from the side, Nanmen Da Jun was moved, secretly regretting his actions against this group of women for some paltry wealth. After all, he was in large part responsible for destroying their Sect’s Defending Array.

“Go now!” Bing Yun yelled at the three who remained unmoving.

The three women trembled at the sight of their angered Honoured Master.

At that moment though, a clear cracking sound echoed across the sky and the large light curtain that shrouded Ice Heart Valley suddenly shattered like broken porcelain.

The last layer of protection was finally broken through, leaving Ice Heart Valley completely exposed.

“The array is broken!” Nanmen Da Jun’s expression changed.

The faces of Bing Yun and the others also froze.

“Bing Yun, this Feng has come!” A yell sounded from outside, followed by the whistling of the winds approaching from all directions. A wave of powerful Divine Senses swept across the treasure land of Ice Heart Valley, and soon, the sound of a battle rang out.

Ice Heart Valley’s disciples had engaged the invading enemies.

*Shua Shua Shua…*

The air snapped, and in the blink of an eye, Bing Yun and the others were surrounded by more than twenty people, all of whom exuded the aura of Emperor Realm Masters.

Leading this group was Feng Xuan and Yao Zhuo, who had powerful Third-Order Emperor Realm cultivations.

“Ice Heart Valley’s Sect Defending Array was nothing much!” Feng Xuan stood mid-air, looking down at Bing Yun and the others, a smug and disdainful smile adorning his lips.

Bing Yun’s elegant eyes swept across each of the Emperors present with a deep sunken expression. Although many looked at her calmly, a good number of them avoided her gaze with looks of shame.

Ice Heart Valley had stood in the Northern Territory for thousands of years, and had never forged any grudges or grievances with other Sects. On the contrary, many female disciples had married out of the Sect, and although Bing Yun had set the rules that any married disciple would have cut all relations with Ice Heart Valley, rules were just rules after all, it was an unchangeable fact that the relationship formed by such marriages between forces could not be divided so simply.

In other words, after so many years, Ice Heart Valley had more and less become related to all the major forces in the Northern Territory, with excellent disciples from every generation of Ice Heart Valley marrying into these Sects.

But now, the Masters of these Sects, along with Feng Xuan, had broken through the Sect Defending Array of Ice Heart Valley, entered their homeland and surrounded Bing Yun and her disciples. It was really heartbreaking.

Some of them could not help feeling guilty as they met Bing Yun’s cold eyes.

“Valley Master Chen, there are no grievances between our Ice Heart Valley and your Green Wind Valley. On the contrary, it was this Queen who helped you with the detoxification when you were poisoned a hundred years ago. Did Valley Master Chen come today to embarrass Ice Heart Valley, too?” An Ruo Yun glared at an elderly man with her beautiful eyes.

The elderly man’s face flushed and quickly looked away without saying anything.

An Ruo Yun turned to another elegantly dressed woman, “We had addressed each other as sisters in affection when Elder Yu came to Ice Heart Valley as a guest. This Queen is quite surprised at this uninvited visit.”

The woman called Elder Yu forced a smile, and explained, “Junior Sister An, don’t blame Elder Sister. Elder Sister can’t tell you why, but I am forced to do this. Besides, Sect Master Feng doesn’t intend to embarrass Ice Heart Valley. He just wants to find out the origin of a single person. All of this will be over if you just tell him what he wants to know. Junior Sister An, why don’t you tell Sect Master Feng what he wants to know now, and Elder Sister will ask Sect Master Feng to spare Ice Heart Valley further trouble.”

An Ruo Yun sneered, “This Queen understands, but must decline Elder Yu’s good intentions.”

Elder Yu frowned and fretted, “Junior Sister An, is this really necessary? You all…”

“Enough! To think I once thought of you as my sister, this Queen was truly blind to have not seen you for the ungrateful villain you are!”

Elder Yu flushed at the biting remark and shouted angrily, “You really can’t appreciate kindness! Junior Sister An, if you’re still so stubborn, your end today will not be good!”

The woman was enraged out of shame involuntarily from An Ruo Yun’s reprimands.

She bellowed in a deep voice, “Today, Sect Master Feng came with overwhelming might. It is better for Junior Sister An to be wise and submit yourself to fate!”

“Well said!” Feng Xuan laughed, crossing his arms as he stared down sneering, “Bing Yun, when you sheltered the murderer of my son, you should have thought of this outcome, but it is too late to regret, since this King is here now, your ending has been decided.”

He seemed to be extremely confident, and just taking his time to enjoy the pleasure of dominating over Bing Yun and the others.

“Sect Master Feng…” Nanmen Da Jun called out, frowning slightly as he cupped his fists. Before he could say anything though, Feng Xuan interrupted him, glanced at him lightly, and commented, “It turns out Grandmaster Nanmen is here too!”

Nanmen Da Jun mumbled sarcastically to himself, [Why are you talking nonsense? I was taken away right before your eyes that day, where else could I have been?]

Feng Xuan continued, “Grandmaster Nanmen deserves most of the credit for our success in breaking through this Array. Please stand back now, this King would hate for you to be hurt by mistake in the coming conflict. After this Sect Master destroys Ice Heart Valley, he may still need your help, Grandmaster.”

Nanmen Da Jun frowned, sighed, and stopped replying.

He knew that his words would not carry much weight anyway. Although he was an Array Master, and plenty begged him for his services, there were also plenty of them who were ungrateful and would be willing to get rid of him after he got the job done.

He did not have the power to force Feng Xuan to follow his advice.

It was simply more sensible to shut his mouth, lest he really draw trouble to himself.

“Brother Yao, join hands with this King to first get rid of Bing Yun, then we shall destroy the entire Ice Heart Valley!” Feng Xuan enjoyed the desperate faces of Ice Heart Valley’s Elders for a while, his heart bubbling with glee. Then he roared loudly, murderous intent surging.

Yao Zhuo, who had been silent at the side for a while, took a step forward at that moment and released his powerful Third-Order Emperor Realm aura.

Although his aura was not as rich and pure as the veteran Feng Xuan’s, it was indeed the aura of the Third-Order Emperor Realm. After all, it had not been long since he had broken through.

Summoning a blade into his hand, Yao Zhuo charged towards Bing Yun with a flash. At the same time, Feng Xuan summoned the relic of the Seeking Passion Great Emperor, the Wind and Thunder Divine Spear.

The sound of a brewing storm resounded from the tip of the spear, and it turned into a flash of lightning as it thrust towards Bing Yun.

With two Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters joining forces against her, Bing Yun’s face turned solemn immediately.

These past few days, she had often fought with Feng Xuan and Yao Zhuo, and while she was not afraid of either of them in a one on one fight, even having confidence she could kill Yao Zhuo in a stick of incense worth of time, she was completely overpowered when facing the two of them together. With a light tap of her foot, she floated backwards and retreated.

“Formation!” An Ruo Yun shouted at that moment.

In an instant, six Emperors Realm Masters of Ice Heart Valley flew to Bing Yun’s side, spreading out in a mysterious pattern.

The seven pushed their Emperor Qi together, causing a resonation that shook the world around them, sending stone and soil flying from the ground and the sun overhead to dim. Where the seven stood, a vague behemoth seemed to materialize, raising its head as it released a guttural roar.

*Dang dang…*

The earth trembled twice as Yao Zhuo retreated a dozen steps, his eyes filled with shocking amazement when he felt the vitality in his chest tumble. Feng Xuan was also pushed back several steps, the Wind and Thunder Divine Spear that was thrust out repelled by a mysterious force.

“What happened?”

“How is Bing Yun so strong?”

The group of spectating Emperor Realm Masters were all dumbfounded, unable to believe their eyes. Although no one doubted Bing Yun’s strength, it was still unbelievable to all the audience that she could single-handedly block Feng Xuan and Yao Zhuo’s combined strike and even force them back.

But they could not doubt the truth that was right in front of them.

“No! That’s not Bing Yun’s power!”

“A Formation, but what kind of Formation?”

“The silhouette of a Black Tortoise, this Formation… it’s incredible.”

The bright light dissipated, and the vision of the ground gradually became clear. Everyone finally had a clear vision of the scene, and shockingly comprehended how Bing Yun had defended against the two Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters.

Because at this moment, Bing Yun and six of her Disciples had formed a mysterious Formation that connected each other’s Emperor Qi and manifested a huge phantom of a Black Tortoise.

Bing Yun stood at the head of the Black Tortoise phantom, while An Ruo Yun and Sun Yun Xiu were at its front shoulders; Ji Yao and another Emperor Realm Elder stood on its rear feet, while one Elder stood at the centre of the tortoise’s back and a last at its tail.

The Black Tortoise phantom threw a disdainful look at the crowd, displaying a demeanour that alone it could hold out against ten thousand men.

It was the Seven Point Black Tortoise Formation!
