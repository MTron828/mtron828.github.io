Yang Kai laughed loudly, “Brother Gu believes this kind of rumour? The Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill is indeed quite good, but it is not Heaven defying to such an extent. As far as I know, this pill does not affect one’s comprehension or aptitude, but it is the perfect medicine for healing one’s Soul.”

“So that’s how it is. If Brother Yang knows much about the Alchemic Way, could you perhaps also be an Alchemist?” Gu Jian Xin’s eyes lit up.

Yang Kai chuckled and shook his head, “I am not an Alchemist, this pill is something I obtained by chance in the Emperor Garden.”

He had already come up with an excuse for the origin of this pill.

“The Emperor Garden!” Qin Wu Hui gasped as he realized once again how precious this pill was.

“Is that so,” Gu Jian Xin also looked relieved, “Only in a place like the Emperor Garden would such an ancient pill exist. It seems that Brother Yang went to explore the Emperor Garden when it opened a few years ago, yes?”

“Indeed.”

A look of desire flashed across Gu Jian Xin’s face, but he soon sighed, “When the Emperor Garden opened, this Gu was in the middle of a critical retreat and could not enter. It’s a shame, if this Gu had gone, he may have been able to befriend Brother Yang a few years ago.”

“It’s not too late now,” Yang Kai smiled.

“True,” The regretful expression on Gu Jian Xin’s face disappeared and was replaced with a smile.

“Young Master Yang...” Qin Wu Hui stood tall with an expression of hesitation on his face. “This Qin is undeserving of such a gift!”

“Senior need not speak so,” Yang Kai interrupted him. “Giving this Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill to Senior Qin is actually because I need Senior Qin’s assistance with something.”

“Please name it, Young Master Yang!” Qin Wu Hui said hurriedly. He was actually afraid that Yang Kai would not ask him for something in return. There was no such thing as rewards for no effort. This Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill was invaluable and not something that could be given away casually, so hearing Yang Kai had something he wanted in return allowed Qin Wu Hui to relax somewhat.

“It’s like this,” Yang Kai mused. “As Senior knows, He Zao and He Miao are old acquaintances of mine that I met at got to know dozens of years ago. Meeting them again in this vast Star Field can be considered a kind of fate; however, I’ve recently learned that they have a somewhat complicated relationship with Young Lord Qin...”

Yang Kai did not go on because he believed Gu Jian Xin and Qin Wu Hui would be able to understand his meaning from just this.

As for the He sisters who were standing behind Yang Kai, their eyes widened after a moment of shock, and their faces filled with a pleasant surprise; even their breathing quickened slightly.

“So that’s it,” Gu Jian Xin grinned meaningfully as if he had learned some kind of special secret.

Qin Wu Hui showed a look of embarrassment and guilt on his face and quickly cupped his fists, “This matter stemmed from this old master’s selfishness, forcing He Zao and He Miao against their wishes into an unfortunate decision. On the other hand, Young Master Yang is so benevolent and righteous it brings shame to this old master’s heart. Having received this ancient pill which can help my good-for-nothing son recover, this old master guarantees that the previous agreement will be cancelled.”

“Many thanks, Senior.” Yang Kai picked up his glass and stood, smiling, “Senior is a straightforward and upright man, this cup is Junior’s respect for Senior.”

“I would not dare accept,” Qin Wu Hui also raised his glass quickly and with a solemn expression vowed. “My son was ignorant and the disaster he suffered was deserved. Now that Young Master Yang has provided a chance for him to recover, this old master has nothing but thanks to offer. This old master also promises he will discipline his son in the future and set him on the righteous path so as not to disappoint Young Master Yang’s benevolence!”

The two drank their glasses of wine before Yang Kai took his seat again.

In a seat in the corner of the hall, Yue Xi cast a grateful look towards Yang Kai.

She never expected that Yang Kai could solve this matter so easily. Originally, it seemed like a peaceful resolution had been impossible, as no matter how highly Gu Jian Xin regarded Yang Kai, it would be a huge loss of face to side with him over a loyal subordinate like Qin Wu Hui, while doing the opposite would not have yielded any good results either.

However, Yang Kai had managed to sweep this problem away without causing Qin Wu Hui to lose any face with a single pill, instead even gaining significantly.

It could be said that everyone was happy with this arrangement.

It’s just... this kind of price was something only Yang Kai could take out casually.

“He Zao, He Miao!” Qin Wu Hui did not immediately take a seat and instead called out to the two sisters before waving his hand and sending two streams of light towards them.

The two sisters had yet to recover from their excitement and joy and only reflexively grasped the two streams of light in their hands before turning their attention to Qin Wu Hui.

“This old master has troubled you this past year, accept these as compensation. I hope you can assist the Young Master with all your heart in the future and not bear a grudge against this old master,” Qin Wu Hui said sincerely.

“Disciple would not dare! Disciple thanks Elder Qin for his generous reward!” He Zao and He Miao bowed and spoke in unison before taking a look at what exactly they had been given.

After a glance, the two discovered that they were actually holding a pair of Origin Grade Mid-Rank artifacts! It was two identical scimitars that seemed to be capable of joining into one to form a single round flying blade.

With their cultivation and status, it was basically impossible for them to obtain Origin Grade Mid-Rank artifacts unless they were gifted by their Honoured Masters or an Elder.

However, Yue Xi herself was not rich, so how could she provide the two sisters with such powerful artifacts? Only someone like Qin Wu Hui could casually pull out and give away two Origin Grade Mid-Rank artifacts.

The two sisters understood that this kind of treatment was all due to Yang Kai! Without Yang Kai, how could Qin Wu Hui have given them two artifacts so freely?

Standing behind Yang Kai, staring at his back, both sisters’ beautiful eyes overflowed with gratitude.

“Brother Yang...” Gu Jian Xin smiled bitterly to the side as he rubbed his forehead lightly and said, “You doing this makes this Gu wonder how he is going to compensate you. We haven’t even finished discussing the Soul Breaker Spear either.”

He had to compensate Yang Kai for the loss of the Soul Breaker Spear, yet instead of making a request, Yang Kai had sent out another gift to Qin Wu Hui. While the exchange between Yang Kai and Qin Wu Hui might seem like a fair deal on the surface, as long as they were slightly discerning, anyone could see that Yang Kai had suffered a huge loss!

After all, whether it was Qin Wu Hui, He Zao, or He Miao, they were all members of Sword Union. Yang Kai had gifted a pill but received nothing in return; what’s more, the pill he delivered was an ancient one that could no longer be refined.

As such, Gu Jian Xin suddenly felt that he owed Yang Kai greatly.

“Brother Yang, we should discuss this matter now. What kind of compensation do you want? Please do not hesitate, this Gu is ready to lose a pound of flesh to you,” Gu Jian Xin joked.

“There’s no need to worry so much,” Yang Kai smiled, “Actually, I have already thought about what I’d like as compensation and for Brother Gu. It should be a simple matter.”

“Oh? Please do explain,” Gu Jian Xin put on a serious face as everyone else in the hall also looked curiously towards Yang Kai. Everyone wanted to know what he would ask for, especially Qin Wu Hui who seemed determined to fulfil any request Yang Kai made.

“Our destination for this trip is Azure Tree Star, right?” Yang Kai asked.

“Indeed.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“And this Azure Tree Star is under the direct control of Sword Union?”

“Yes! Azure Tree is under the jurisdiction of my Sword Union,” Gu Jian Xin said proudly, “Regarding Cultivation Stars like Azure Tree Star, my Sword Union controls three!”

“Then this will be simple,” Yang Kai smiled lightly, “I want a site covering a radius of ​​ten thousand kilometres. En, I do not need it to be a particularly rich region, just so long as it is not barren, it will be fine.”

“Ten thousand kilometres?” Gu Jian Xin frowned.

“Five thousand kilometres is also fine,” Yang Kai added.

“Hahaha, Brother Yang is far too polite, forget ten thousand kilometres, even a hundred thousand kilometres is fine!” Gu Jian Xin laughed and patted Yang Kai on the shoulder, “A hundred-thousand-kilometre territory on Azure Tree Star is nothing. Good, it’s settled then, when we arrive on Azure Tree Star, this Gu will have someone arrange it. As for what site Brother Yang would like, you can make your own decision!”

Yang Kai was stunned for a moment and unable to respond, but soon he smiled and nodded, “Since Brother Gu has said this much, this Yang will naturally accept.”

As the Star Master of Shadowed Star, owning a trivial hundred-thousand-kilometre territory did not have any big impact on him.

“There’s no need for politeness between us!” Gu Jian Xin stretched out and beckoned, causing Ling Yue to immediately step forward to fill his and Yang Kai’s glass.

“Brother Yang, might I ask what you want this site for? Do you plan on settling down on Azure Tree Star?” Gu Jian Xin asked with joy and expectation.

If Yang Kai really was planning to do so, it would undoubtedly be good news for Gu Jian Xin. He was still worried about having an opportunity to win over Yang Kai, but if Yang Kai wanted to settle on Azure Tree Star, how could there not be chances to recruit him in the future?

“I’ve no intention of settling down, but building a temporary residence might not be a bad idea,” Yang Kai smiled meaningfully.

“Brother Yang is a man of great ambitions it seems!”

“Brother Gu, might I discuss another business deal with you?”

“Brother Yang, please speak.”

“I need a large amount of Space Spirit Crystals. I don’t know if Brother Gu could provide them? Of course, I will purchase them with Saint Crystals or exchange them for other valuables so your Sword Union won’t suffer a loss.”

“Brother Yang is too serious, since it’s a transaction, this Gu will naturally not refuse, but... Space Spirit Crystals are a scarce commodity in the Star Field, so it will have to wait until we reach Azure Tree Star before I can make some inquiries for you.”

“Then I shall trouble you.”

.....

The banquet lasted for an entire day with everyone only departing after becoming thoroughly drunk.

Yang Kai returned to his room and washed himself before scattering the effects of the alcohol.

Later, Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Miao came to visit him together and thank him.

To Yang Kai, this was nothing more than a trivial matter. The materials used to refine the Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill were all part of his collection and the only precious item used was the Monster Core of the Seven Coloured Elk.

Yang Kai had obtained this Monster Core after killing the Seven Coloured Elk Variant in the Emperor Garden but he had no use for it until now, so it wasn’t a loss for him to refine a pill with it this time.

But for the Master and Disciple trio, this was an important matter that greatly affected their futures.

Yang Kai could perceive their gratitude, which made him feel slightly complex emotionally.

With differences in position and power, the things one could accomplish also differed greatly, just like how an ant could not shake an iron rod with all its strength, but an ordinary mortal could easily pick it up just by reaching out.

After seeing off the Master and Disciple trio, Yang Kai entered into secluded retreat to cultivate his various Secret Techniques.

Whether it was his Golden Blood Threads, Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art, or Space Force, Yang Kai needed a lot of time to cultivate and consolidate them.

The road ahead was very safe. After being attacked by Li Ming Hai, the Starship did not encounter any disturbances and twenty days later, it arrived safely at Azure Tree Star!
