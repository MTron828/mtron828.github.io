Hand Seals quickly changed as a series of Secret Techniques flew out one after another. As the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters personally took action, the Black Ink Disciples, most of whom were just in Third or Fourth-Order, were completely powerless to resist.

The Secret Techniques struck every one of the Black Ink Disciples, sealing the strength in their bodies. Even their Small Universes had been thoroughly sealed.

In this condition, not to mention using the Small Universe‚Äôs strength, even lifting a finger was a mere dream.

This was the only way to ensure that the Black Ink Disciples would not try to self-destruct.

While Liu Mu and Luo Ting He were busying themselves, Yang Kai also had his hands full.

He quickly shifted every one of the imprisoned Black Ink Disciples, whose Small Universes were sealed, throwing them onto the abandoned Spirit Province outside.

The trio tirelessly worked for half a day before they were done dealing with the 2,000 Black Ink Disciples.

Yang Kai let out a heavy sigh. He finally felt a sense of relief, as if a heavy burden was lifted off his shoulders.

He then looked toward Luan Bai Feng, hesitated for a moment, before deciding not to go over.

Now that Luan Bai Feng was corrupted by the Black Ink Strength, she had lost her sanity and her heart was not the same as before. The Black Ink Disciples regarded the Black Ink Clan above all else. It was useless to try to talk to her.

After a dozen days or so, more Masters from the Cave Heavens and Paradises arrived at Black Territory, arriving in a nearly endless stream.

Two months later, Masters from almost all the various Cave Heavens and Paradises had gathered. Each Cave Heaven and Paradise team was led by at least one Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Ancestor, followed by an endless stream of Seventh and Sixth-Order Masters.

Currently, an unimaginable force had gathered in Black Territory, with the number of Eight-Order Masters alone having crossed the 100 mark.

This was the accumulation of millennia of the Cave Heavens and Paradises‚Äô heritage. Generally, these top forces remained reserved, concealing their strength from the public eyes, but if something big were to happen, they would instantly display their fangs.

Yang Kai couldn‚Äôt help but feel a bit envious. He could not help but wonder when Void Land and High Heaven Palace would be like this, when they would stand toe to toe with these top forces.

The Eighth-Order Ancestors guarded the central region of the Black Prison in shifts, constantly monitoring the movements of the imprisoned Black Ink Clansman. However, even an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was unable to remain there for too long due to the influence of the Super Array enveloping the Black Prison. A day or two was the longest they could linger before having to retreat.

The thousands of Black Ink Disciples imprisoned on the abandoned Spirit Province were also an object of their interest. The Black Ink Strength scattered throughout Black Territory because of the last battle had also attracted many people‚Äôs investigation.

Matters related to the Black Ink Clan were not a secret to the top Masters of the Cave Heavens and Paradises, but knowing and seeing were two different matters, so they were naturally curious.

The Black Ink Strength‚Äôs peculiarity and the Black Ink Disciples‚Äô stubbornness deeply shocked them.

Yang Kai‚Äôs brilliant performance in this incident had also piqued the interest of many High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters.

As the Lord of Void Land and a Great Emperor of the Star Boundary, Yang Kai wasn‚Äôt an unknown figure, so most of the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters had at least heard of him.

However, that didn‚Äôt mean many of them had seen him before.

This time, they finally got to meet him in person. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Yang Kai got acquainted with many Seventh and Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters.

Yang Kai also took this opportunity to pedal his Profound Yin Bamboo.

As one of the Twelve Minor Universe Pillars, the value of the Profound Yin Bamboo was naturally well known. Furthermore, with the appearance of the Black Ink Clan, the Profound Yin Bamboo became even more important.

Although it couldn‚Äôt make its owner immune to the Black Ink Strength like the World Spring, it still offered quite a bit of resistance to Black Ink Strength‚Äôs corrosion, allowing the Small Universe to remain more stable.

When Yang Kai had negotiated with many foreign envoys about the right to use the Good Fortune Divine Furnace in the past, he had added the Profound Yin Bamboo onto the negotiation table, owing to which the High Heaven Palace would provide each Cave Heaven and Paradise with some Profound Yin Bamboo‚Ä¶

However, there were simply too few of them to go around.

Compared to the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters of the various Cave Heavens and Paradises, the Profound Yin Bamboo provided by High Heaven Palace was simply insufficient.

Now that they had met Yang Kai though, the Lord of Void Land, in Black Territory, the High-Rank Open Heaven Masters naturally wanted to target him.

Be that as it may, how could Yang Kai give away the Profound Yin Bamboo for free with his money-grubbing personality?

In Lang Ya Paradise, he even forcefully sold his healing pills to those he beat up, let alone a real treasure like one of the Twelve Minor Universe Pillars.

From the standpoint of a Sect Master, Yang Kai was just doing his best to accumulate resources.

The amount of Profound Yin Bamboo he had cultivated in his Small Universe was not small, but as he was about to advance to the Seventh-Order, he did not focus his time and attention on cultivating them as the growth of the Profound Yin Bamboo would be at the expense of his own foundation.

After much probing and bargaining, Yang Kai and the many High-Rank Open Heaven Masters finally reached a price satisfactory to all parties.

Profound Yin Bamboos were then sold one after another.

Regardless, a single shoot of the Profound Yin Bamboo would not be of much use. The owner would first need to consume their own foundation to cultivate the Profound Yin Bamboo and then transform it into a large bamboo forest. The bigger the bamboo forest, the stronger the effects of the Profound Yin Bamboo.

This definitely required time and effort, but as the High-Rank Open Heaven Masters had extremely long lifespans, they really didn‚Äôt care about this.

Over the past few months, the miners in Black Territory had dug up quite a lot of materials from the various Ore Stars, so much so that Luan Bai Feng even brought Yang Kai to check them out some time ago.

After returning, Yang Kai also put all of them into his Small Universe.

By the time Yang Kai had sold most of the Profound Yin Bamboos, the Golden Antelope Paradise ship had arrived.

All the Black Ink Disciples were loaded onto the ship and 30 Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters from different Cave Heavens and Paradises were stationed aboard it for security. After settling everything, Yang Kai led the ship out of Black Territory.

These Black Ink Disciples were of paramount importance; furthermore, the Cave Heaven and Paradises didn‚Äôt want any mishaps along the way. If an accident occurred and these Black Ink Disciples were able to escape somehow, the vast universe would instantly fall into chaos, so the Ancestors had taken precautions.

The lineup of 30 Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters was quite grand; enough to deal with any unexpected situation.

The ship was extremely large, but its speed was also quite surprising for its size. Soon, it left Black Territory and sailed towards the Chaotic Dead Territory.

At some point, a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master suddenly shouted, prompting the scattered High-Rank Open Heaven Masters to immediately gather around.

Yang Kai too instantly appeared at the source of the voice, asking, ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs chasing after us.‚Äù The Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, who had issued the warning, raised his hand, pointing toward the rear.

Yang Kai looked over and found that a streak of light was indeed rapidly approaching the ship from the rear. Judging by its speed, it was obviously not something an ordinary Open Heaven Realm Master would possess.

Everyone‚Äôs expressions couldn‚Äôt help but turn solemn. No one knew who was chasing after them or what their purpose was.

‚ÄúBe on guard!‚Äù Yang Kai exhorted in a low voice. On this trip to the Chaotic Dead Territory, his cultivation might have been the lowest, but he was the one in charge. Thus, the 30 High-Rank Masters circulated their strength and prepared for battle.

A moment later, Yang Kai gawked at the figure approaching them, speechless.

The one chasing them was none other than Six Wood Divine Monarch, Li Mu, of Golden Antelope Paradise! Everyone wondered what he was doing here.

Liu Mu directly landed on the stern of the ship. When he looked around and saw the Seventh-Order Masters staring at him vigilantly, he instantly became dissatisfied, ‚ÄúWhat the Hell are you looking at, you brats?‚Äù

The Seventh-Order Masters looked at each other, not knowing what to say, but all of them knew that this Golden Antelope Paradise Ancestor had a fiery temper. His words might be harsh, he didn‚Äôt have any malicious intent.

Yang Kai quickly asked, ‚ÄúSenior, what brings you here? Do you have any instructions for us?‚Äù

Liu Mu stiffly replied, ‚ÄúNothing of the sort, I just wanted to come with you to blow off some steam.‚Äù

Yang Kai‚Äôs face twitched as he asked, ‚ÄúBlow off some steam?‚Äù

Liu Mu heaved a sigh, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because I can‚Äôt win an argument with those old farts. It‚Äôs too frustrating, so I‚Äôd rather not bother. I said I wanted to slaughter the Black Ink Clansman as soon as possible to avoid future troubles, but they just want to take their sweet time to deliberate on it. What‚Äôs there to deliberate? By the time they come to a decision, it will already be too late.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù Yang Kai was speechless for a moment. He already had no say in the matters of the Black Ink Clansman. The matter rested at the hands of Cave Heavens and Paradises; it was up for them to decide. Liu Mu could freely vent his anger, but he could not.

Liu Mu, on the other hand, suddenly threw this matter to the back of his mind and excitedly asked, ‚ÄúYang Boy, have you personally seen the Sun‚Äôs Burning Light and Moon‚Äôs Serene Glimmer?‚Äù

‚ÄúIndeed!‚Äù Yang Kai nodded his affirmation.

‚ÄúWhat do they look like? Are they really tall and fierce?‚Äù Liu Mu asked curiously.

This time, even the thirty Seventh-Order Masters became interested and perked up their ears.

Everyone knew about the existence of the Sun‚Äôs Burning Light and Moon‚Äôs Serene Glimmer, and all had heard countless rumors about them, but none of them had been fortunate enough to witness their true appearances.

Those who had seen them were all dead.

Yang Kai thought about the image of Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan and felt that it had nothing to do with their height or strength. Both of them were much more like children who needed to be coaxed.

Playing house with them in the Chaotic Dead Territory was definitely the greatest shame in his life‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI guess you can say that.‚Äù Looking at the look of reverence on Liu Mu‚Äôs face though, Yang Kai felt that it was best not to break his fantasy.

Liu Mu rushed over and sheepishly requested, ‚ÄúYang Boy, can you‚Ä¶ introduce this Monarch to them when we arrive at the Chaotic Dead Territory? This Monarch wants to admire their noble bearing.‚Äù

Yang Kai promptly stated without giving it another thought, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try my best. Senior, you also know that people like them really don‚Äôt have a good temper. Whether we can meet them, and whether they will help us, I‚Äôm also not sure.‚Äù

Liu Mu solemnly nodded his understanding, ‚ÄúI understand, just do your best. Even if you can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just because my luck isn‚Äôt that good, I won‚Äôt hold it against you.‚Äù

Yang Kai curiously asked, ‚ÄúWhy does Senior want to meet those two?‚Äù

Liu Mu leisurely replied, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Sun‚Äôs Burning Light and Moon‚Äôs Serene Glimmer. Who doesn‚Äôt want to meet them? Don‚Äôt you want to see them?‚Äù

His last sentence was meant for the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters.

Everyone earnestly nodded again and again. Some of them even wore a flattering look as they looked at Yang Kai, probably requesting him to introduce them too.

Liu Mu added, grinning, ‚ÄúWhen this Monarch returns alive after meeting those, I can rub it in the faces of those old farts.‚Äù

He kept calling them old farts, but he forgot that in the eyes of others, he was probably one of them too.

Yang Kai didn‚Äôt know whether to laugh or cry.
