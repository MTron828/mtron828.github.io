Hearing Shan Qing Luo ask this, all of them complained incessantly in their hearts as sweat dripped down their foreheads. Why was this devilish woman here? Why were the Heavens so heartless!?

“Of course not!” Guo Yuan Ming involuntarily gulped, “Respected Demon Queen, we servants were simply tracking a group of True Element Boundary cultivators who had broken into the Holy Land, we truly did not mean to offend Lady Demon Queen, we swear to the Heavens!”

“Oh, really now...” Shan Qing Luo replied lightly. Her enchanting voice slightly dropped in tone, but these people hearing this pleasant melody not only did not feel pleasant, but instead felt even tenser. Their backs were covered in cold sweat, and none of them dared to make a sound.

Shan Qing Luo gently lifted her delicate hands and gently brushed one of her exquisite nails. Appearing extremely indifferently as she casually said, “Since you know your sins, why have you not offered your life in apology yet? Do you want to force this Queen to handle you personally?”

Guo Yuan Ming’s trembling increased greatly. His legs buckled under him as he collapsed to his knees, smashing his head on the ground with his blood frozen solid.

The rest of his group behind him also trembled in fear. Big drops of sweat dripped from their faces, and their heads bent so far forward that their chins touched their chests.

Yang Kai’s gaze flickered as he silently stood behind Shan Qing Luo.

This was the first time he had seen this seductive woman’s true methods. She was truly majestic and domineering!

Was this the true face of the Beguiling Demon Queen?

Although he was unclear about exactly what was happening, Yang Kai figured that Shan Qing Luo and the master of these few henchmen had some kind of grudge between them, so she was intentionally making things difficult for them.

Moreover, Shan Qing Luo’s current strength had been greatly diminished so she was probably trying to use this approach to pre-emptively frighten them.

“Hehe...” Shan Qing Luo suddenly smiled playfully and glanced towards the other side, “Get up, taking this Queen’s joke so seriously, you’re all too boring...”

Guo Yuan Ming however did not dare move. There was no way he would believe this devilish woman’s words. If he stood up, Shan Qing Luo might just directly slaughter him...

Instead he just repeatedly kowtowed, “Many thanks Lady Demon Queen for your mercy. Many thanks!”

Coldly glancing over at him, Shan Qing Luo’s voice suddenly became cold, “Go back to your master and tell him this. Our accounts from one month ago, I will soon settle. Get lost!”

Receiving this fantasy like amnesty, Guo Yuan Ming quickly scrambled to his feet, bowed his head deeply, and shouted, “Please rest assured Lady Demon Queen, this servant will definitely bring your words to my master!”

“Within ten breaths, if anyone remains within my sight, they will stay here forever!”

*Shua Shua Shua...*

These six or seven people kicked the ground, Used all their strength to flee, and disappeared in the blink of an eye.

*Hmph!* Shan Qing Luo coldly snorted, turned around, and said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Kai silently followed. In his heart, he greatly admired this seductive woman’s methods and majesty.

Shan Qing Luo walked faster and faster, until a moment later she was actually running as fast as the wind.

“Why are you escaping so quickly? Didn’t you successfully deceive them already?” Yang Kai asked confusedly as he chased after her.

“It’s only a temporary measure, Guo Yuan Ming isn’t stupid. After a while when he reflects on it he will no doubt notice some flaws. My relationship with the Thunderbolt Beast King is not very good, I was also recently ambushed and wounded by him and his minions; those people were Beast King’s henchmen, if they catch us everything will be over!” Shan Qing Luo hurriedly explained as she continued dashing forward a hundred meters at a time.

“Heh...” Yang Kai’s expression became strange, “You are also one of the Devil Kings, someone on the same level as that Thunderbolt Beast King, him daring to bring people to ambush you, if you don’t have some kind of serious conflict of interest, it must be him coveting your beauty. The temptation of a supreme beauty is really powerful!”

“You shut up!” Shan Qing Luo glared at him, and her expression became icy cold.

Yang Kai simply grinned as he shrugged his shoulders and obediently stayed quiet.

After those six or seven individuals had escaped more than a dozen kilometers, they suddenly stopped.

“What’s wrong Brother Guo?” Another expert at the Immortal Ascension Boundary Second Stage looked at him and asked.

Guo Yuan Ming frowned and looked back towards where they had met Shan Qing Luo. Seemingly contemplating something as he asked, “Do you think something is off with that whore today?”

“Somewhat off?”

“How could she have let us off so easily?” Guo Yuan Ming grew more and more skeptical. “Master had brought several people to ambush her a month ago, on top of that they also have many past grievances, even just considering the incident last month, us meeting her now should have ended up with us suffering greatly.”

“But if so, why would she just send us on our way?”

As he contemplated, his brow wrinkled further. He hesitated for a long time before continuing, “I heard from those involved in that ambush that although they failed to capture that devilish woman, she still suffered a direct hit from Master.”

“That’s right, and just now she did seem somewhat unsteady. Perhaps she was seriously wounded in that fight and hasn’t fully healed yet?”

“A wound inflicted by Master isn’t something so easy to resolve.” Guo Yuan Ming said as a light flashed across his eyes, “She is definitely still suffering from serious injuries or she would never have let us go so easily! I remember half a year ago, Brother Yuan’s younger brother had only glanced at her once and she immediately killed him... that devilish woman is utterly ruthless, how could she suddenly be so forgiving?”

Hearing this and remembering back, Yuan Shi’s treacherous face flashed a trace anger and hatred, and he viciously cursed, “If it weren’t for her bloodline’s special skills, allowing the previous generation’s Demon Queen to pass on the bulk of her cultivation to her, allowing that little slut already have such high strength, I would have already killed her!”

Guo Yuan Ming swept his eyes over his companions and grinned meaningfully as he said, “If Brother Yuan wants revenge for his younger brother then right now is his chance!”

Everyone hearing these words couldn’t help being startled.

None of them had dared even consider the idea of openly opposing the Beguiling Demon Queen.

“What, are you all afraid?” Guo Yuan Ming sneered. “Her letting us go definitely means she has some scruples. What could that be? Obviously she’s afraid that right now she can’t beat us!”

Yuan Shi nodded in agreement, “What Brother Guo said is reasonable, but... in the end it is just a guess. What if she isn’t seriously injured or if she has already recovered?”

“We have to try to know!” Guo Yuan Ming grinned meaningfully, “That’s why I just said you all have no courage!”

Everyone else remained silent for a time, and each of them glanced around at the others. All of them were hesitant to act. Admittedly, what Guo Yuan Ming said made sense, but everything really was based on a hunch.

Seeing that some of them appeared to be hesitating, Guo Yuan Ming made another push, “My fellow brothers. That is the Beguiling Demon Queen. Don’t you have any desire to taste her? An opportunity to have her under you? Even if we were to die, just to bed this woman, it is worth it.”

Fantasizing about Shan Qing Luo’s delicate body and sweet voice, imagining being able to strip her naked, toy with her as they pleased, and listen to her moan in ecstasy, all of them couldn’t help breathing a bit heavier.

Guo Yuan Ming kept pressing, “Also, if she can pass on her strength to her descendants, what says she can’t pass it on to us! An Immortal Ascension Boundary Ninth Stage master, even if we split the spoils among us wouldn’t everyone at least be able to break through at least one or two minor realms?”

Everyone was finally convinced!

A malicious light flashed across Yuan Shi’s eyes, and he quickly said, “What Brother Guo says is right, being able to taste her beauty and rob her cultivation... it certainly is worth the risk!”

After carefully considering it, the others present also grit their teeth and nodded.

Guo Yuan Ming laughed, “You are all good brothers indeed! Now that we’ve decided, we shouldn’t delay, let’s quickly catch up!”

Yang Kai and Shan Qing Luo flew through the forest, constantly changing direction.

But half a day later, from behind them suddenly came the sound of hurried footsteps.

Shan Qing Luo’s expression sank as she grit her teeth, “They really found out.”

Resigned, she quickly came to a stop and took a deep breath to calm her nerves as both she and Yang Kai prepared themselves.

“It’s them!” Yang Kai stealthily released his Divine Sense. Aware of whom their pursuers were, his face also becoming gloomy.

Evidently Shan Qing Luo concerns were warranted. Although she had indeed scared off these people with her domineering demeanour, she had involuntarily revealed too many flaws which their enemies had discovered after carefully reviewing their encounter.

Though it was just a drop of blood in the vast sea, the fierce sharks had still sniffed it out.

“Lady Demon Queen!” A moment later, Guo Yuan Ming and his companions swiftly appeared from the distance. All of them were clearly a bit anxious, but they did not display the same extreme caution and dread from before. Their gazes darted back and forth, and their eyes flashed with meaningful light and dared to spy upon Shan Qing Luo with an obscene glint from time to time.

“What it is?” Shan Qing Luo asked in a cold tone.

“Haha... Lady Demon Queen’s speed is so great it took us a long time to catch up!” Guo Yuan Ming’s attitude was significantly more presumptuous now, as he obviously salivated at the meal before him but also using his attitude to confirm his speculations. He was eighty percent certain but still wanted to make that one hundred percent.

They had clearly parted for only a brief moment before, yet they had spent so much time chasing her down. If she was not hiding something, why would she need to run so fast?

“Enough nonsense, why are you here?” Shan Qing Luo questioned impatiently, her voice became ever colder. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Please forgive me, this servant had forgotten that my Lord Beast King had instructed that if we were to meet Lady Demon Queen we were to give her this small gift. My lord wishes to send this to Lady Demon Queen as recompense for last month’s offence in hopes that she will not pursue the matter!” While speaking, Guo Yuan Ming threw something from his hand towards Shan Qing Luo.

This item gave off a special aura. It was clearly a high quality artifact.

At the moment he threw this artifact, Guo Yuan Ming had poured his True Qi into it, so though it seemed to have been casually tossed, in reality it contained a hidden attack.

Shan Qing Luo readily caught this artifact, and though she was prepared, she still felt a shock shoot through her tender body, which caused her to tremble lightly as her arm went numb.

Witnessing this reaction, these few men suddenly grinned widely.

“Guo Yuan Ming, you court death!” Shan Qing Luo furiously screamed.

However, Guo Yuan Ming simply smiled maliciously, “Oh oh, please forgive this servant’s carelessness Lady Demon Queen; it seems this one had used a bit too much force before, but with your great strength, how is it that you could not handle it? Is it that you have perhaps... lost much of your strength right now?”

As he asked these questions, Guo Yuan Ming’s tone became more and more rampant, his eyes slowly revealed an obscene light as they wandered all over Shan Qing Luo’s body.

Shan Qing Luo’s expression slightly changed. Understanding that the other party had seen through her current condition, she no longer bothered to conceal things and instead let out a proud laugh, “Hmph! It is true that right now I have lost a great deal of strength, but if it is to kill you few wastes it is still enough!”

As she spoke, her pair of enchanting eyes suddenly shimmered as they released a dense light, seemingly containing an endless attraction, pulling the souls of all those around into them.

At the same time, from all around a strange fragrance wafted about. As soon as they smelt this aroma, every man present had their pulse race as their blood began to boil.

Even Yang Kai’s eyes became slightly confused for a moment, but he swiftly regained his composure. Quickly returning his True Qi to his dantian, Yang Kai summoned the Asura Sword to his hand as the Evil Qi from his Unyielding Golden Skeleton burst forth.

Wrapped in this thick black gas, he quickly struck towards Guo Yuan Ming.
