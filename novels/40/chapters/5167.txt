There existed an order of priorities, and people had to make difficult choices when faced with a crisis. Wan Zheng Xin perfectly understood this point and his fury and worries turned into boundless rage. He mobilized his World Force madly, unleashing Divine Abilities and Secret Techniques at Wu Jiang recklessly.

At the same time, Yang Kai roared, “Feng Ying, Formation change!”

Under the Six Paths Formation, the six Seventh-Order members of Dawn had their auras and even thoughts linked, so as soon as Yang Kai yelled, Feng Ying understood what he was planning to do.

Without any hesitation, when Yang Kai teleported out, she promptly assumed the Core position. The other four simultaneously changed their positions as well. As such, the Six Paths Formation rapidly changed into a Five Elements Formation, where Yang Kai’s position was replaced by Feng Ying.

“Be careful!” Feng Ying’s voice rang in Yang Kai’s ears as he appeared next to Hong Hu out of nowhere. A Golden Crow cried out and a Great Sun rose from the spear’s tip as Yang Kai thrust his weapon out at Hong Hu.

Yang Kai could not ignore Hong Hu because, after sending Breeze Squad’s Warship flying, he would smash the hammer in his hand down on the Wild Boar Squad’s Warship next.

Although the defences of the Wild Boar Squad’s Warship were better than the Breeze Squad Warship’s, they were still limited. Against the strength Hong Hu had just displayed, the Wild Boar’s Warship would simply be unable to resist.

It was easy to imagine that if no one was there to intercept Hong Hu, the Wild Boar’s Warship would surely meet the same end as Breeze Squad’s, followed by Dawn, and then the Water Snakes.

Although Yang Kai couldn’t understand why Hong Hu didn’t directly disturb Xiang Shan’s breakthrough and instead attacked the Warships, he couldn’t just sit back and watch.

Due to various reasons, the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm members of the other Squads were unable to help, so Yang Kai had no choice but to step in. Furthermore, he had experience in fighting Territory Lords, and his strength was far greater than an ordinary Seventh-Order Master’s. He was also proficient in the Dao of Space, so even if he was not an opponent of the Territory Lord, he would not fall so quickly.

The other Seventh-Order Masters could not do this and only death awaited them if they tried. If an entire group came over, Wu Jiang would no longer be suppressed and would surely start a bloodbath.

Yang Kai’s sudden appearance took Hong Hu by surprise. In fact, he was just testing the waters when he attacked Breeze Squad’s Warship; after all, there had been no casualties on the Human Race’s side up until now. Things might not be looking good for the Humans at this moment; but in reality, everything was still in their control. If an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Master was lying in wait nearby, he or she may have decided to not provide help.

Attacking a Warship was the best way to test the waters. If an Eighth-Order Master was really hiding in the shadows, he or she would definitely try to stop him once casualties and deaths on the Human side became inevitable.

Much to his satisfaction, no Eighth-Order Masters stepped in, just a lone Seventh-Order Human.

Hong Hu didn’t take the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters seriously, even when the one attacking him displayed an extremely powerful Divine Ability.

Hong Hu casually swung the hammer in his hand, hitting the tip of the spear, and annihilating the Great Sun. The spear in Yang Kai’s hand almost flew out from the recoil and the violent force which was transmitted to him sent him tumbling far away in the blink of an eye.

After swatting away the annoying ant, Hong Hu gazed down at the asteroid. His gaze pierced through the thick protection surrounding the asteroid, whereupon he saw a familiar figure sitting cross-legged on the ground.

[Xiang Shan! It’s been ages since we last met, but unfortunately for you, this place will be your grave!]

Since he was certain that there was no ambush here, Hong Hu didn’t hesitate any longer. He raised his hammer high as the power of his Black Ink Strength surged around him to the point that it seemed solid. The next moment, he brought his hammer down hard under the furious gazes of Chai Fang and the others.

When the hammer fell, it was as if two Universe Worlds had collided. The surrounding million kilometres radius trembled as the violent blast of energy materialized into a shockwave that rapidly propagated. Even the Warships that were far away from the hammer’s point of impact instantly bobbed up and down like they were caught up in a storm.

*Kacha…*

With the hammer as the centre, an enormous crack appeared on the defensive barrier of the Old Turtle Squad’s Warship before it began spreading out like a spider web.

Hong Hu was a little surprised at this sight and commented, “It’s quite sturdy!”

Even with his fearsome Territory Lord strength, his full-powered blow was unable to break through this barrier. The defensive power of this strange Warship was surprisingly good.

Nonetheless, no matter how strong its defences were, it couldn’t withstand such fierce attacks for long. With just one strike, Hong Hu came to the conclusion that he only needed three strikes to completely break this barrier.

*Hong …*

With another blow, the cracks became wider. Even the Old Turtle Squad’s Warship flickered and cracking sounds came from its hull as it was unable to bear the attack.

“Hold fast! Channel all your power into the defences!” Chai Fang furiously roared as he ground his teeth. With him as the leader, the entire 50 members of the Old Turtle Squad pushed their strength madly.

Nonetheless, whether it was Chai Fang or his Squad members, they all knew that when the Territory Lord’s next attack landed, their shields would be broken. The gap in strength between the two sides was not something they could make up for with their efforts.

Hong Hu raised his hammer once more as a giant shadow appeared. Just when it was about to fall though, Hong Hu turned his head and looked back.

In the distant void, a Great Sun was slowly rising, followed by a Full Moon. Under the combined brilliance of this Sun and Moon, a strange power started surging.

This power was hard to describe and difficult to understand, seemingly containing various kinds of mysteries. Hong Hu had never felt this kind of power before, but a sense of unease gripped his heart once he did. This strange power actually posed a certain threat to him.

As the Sun and Moon intertwined with each other, this mysterious power became more and more sublime.

At first, it was still quite some distance away, but in the next instant, it was somehow right in front of him. Behind this swirl of light was the Seventh-Order Human he had sent flying not too long ago, wearing a stoic look on his face.

In the end, Hong Hu’s third strike never happened. He had always been cautious, so when facing this unknown threat, his choice was always to take care of it first!

Black Ink Strength rapidly surged as a large Black Ink Cloud emerged, enveloping Hong Hu and allowing him to disappear from everyone’s sight.

The Sun and Moon Divine Wheel struck the Black Ink Clouds, and in that instant, Space-Time Strength spread out into the surroundings. For that moment, everyone had the illusion that time was frozen and space had solidified.

Everything happened in the blink of an eye, but it felt like hundreds of thousands of years had passed.

A sigh escaped Yang Kai’s lips as a desolate look appeared on his face.

The Sun Moon Divine Wheel was the strongest move in his arsenal, but even it failed to do anything to the Territory Lord. It simply lacked the strength to kill its target while the latter was on guard.

On the Old Turtle Squad’s Warship, Chai Fang and the others were staring in Hong Hu’s direction with widened eyes, but when the solid Black Ink Cloud dispersed, they didn’t see the scene they were expecting.

Much to their surprise, there was an enormous black shell inside the Black Ink Cloud, like a cocoon that had been enlarged countless times.

The cocoon was congealed from extremely dense Black Ink Strength. Suddenly, cracks began to appear on its surface one after another before it shattered into pieces, revealing Hong Hu’s figure.

He glanced at Yang Kai and exclaimed, “Such an extraordinary move!”

In fact, if he hadn’t promptly circulated his strength to condense the black cocoon, encasing himself and devoting his full attention to his defence, he would have been seriously injured by the last attack. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

A mere Seventh-Order Human actually had the ability to injure him. If this was a moment ago, he would never have believed it possible, but having experienced it personally, he could not deny it.

Fortunately for him, he had responded in a timely and appropriate fashion. Although he had consumed a lot of energy, he was not injured.

[This Seventh-Order Human is probably another elite not inferior to Xiang Shan!] Hong Hu’s spirits were immediately lifted. Not only could he kill Xiang Shan today, but he could also destroy another promising seedling of the Human Race.

While he was in a great mood, Yang Kai’s heart sank into the abyss.

Even his strongest attack failed to do anything to Hong Hu; so right now, apart from defending the Old Turtle Squad with his life, he could do nothing else.

The reinforcements from the forward base were nowhere in sight, most likely intercepted by the Black Ink Clan.

Furthermore, in the absence of his powerful combat strength, things were not looking good for Feng Ying and the other Seventh-Order Masters. When Yang Kai was there, the four Squads in Battle Formations were able to put up a good fight against Wu Jiang. Even if they were at a disadvantage, they would not have been defeated in short order.

But as soon as he left, although the Masters from the four Squads were still in Formation, Dawn’s overall strength had decreased sharply, increasing Wu Jiang’s advantage. By the looks of it, the four Formations would be defeated by Wu Jiang in less than an hour, at which point they would suffer heavy casualties.

Yang Kai couldn’t see any hope. Although he still had a trump card he had yet to use, it was hard to say how effective it would be.

Nonetheless, he couldn’t back down even in this situation.

Raising his hand, Yang Kai summoned the Azure Dragon Spear as he threw a Spirit Pill into his mouth. Yang Kai pointed his weapon towards Hong Hu and mobilized his Space Principles, instantly disappearing from sight.

The next time he appeared, he was standing right before Hong Hu, the Azure Dragon Spear rapidly expanding in Hong Hu’s eyes.

“Impudence!” Hong Hu coldly snorted as he brought his hammer down to meet the Azure Dragon Spear.

Yang Kai staggered from the impact, but before he could even regain his footing, a mass of Black Ink Strength flew towards his face, enveloping his head and disturbing his five senses. It became impossible for him to see or hear anything, even his Divine Sense was greatly suppressed.

He instinctively blocked an incoming attack with his spear, but he was sent flying as a result of his hasty defence, his chest caved in and several of his ribs broke.

Hong Hu exclaimed in surprise. He hadn’t held back in his last attack. Under normal circumstances, a Seventh-Order Human would have not been able to block such a blow and would have lost his life on the spot, but much to his surprise, the Human before his eyes survived, albeit with heavy injuries.

[As expected of an elite seedling, such a person cannot be allowed to grow!]

Hong Hu became even more determined to kill Yang Kai. Nonetheless, he didn’t immediately chase after him, he wanted to finish off Xiang Shan first.

In comparison, he was more wary of Xiang Shan.

The hammer in his hand fell once more and the already cracked barrier finally couldn’t bear the brunt and shattered into pieces. Even the Old Turtle Squad’s Warship suffered great damage. Many of the members who had been linked to the Warship to provide it with power spurted a mouthful of blood as their auras weakened.

With the protective barrier broken, there was nothing stopping Hong Hu, who now coldly stared at Xiang Shan before he raised his hammer high and swung it down hard.

Chai Fang and the others helplessly stared at the oncoming attack in horror. At this moment, none of them had the strength to stop this blow. Not only would Xiang Shan die, but even the asteroid below would probably be blown to pieces.

This did not escape the eyes of the Masters near Wu Jiang. All of them wanted to help, but they were unable to interfere! Before, they were the ones who had been pestering Wu Jiang, but now Wu Jiang was the one who was tying them down.

Just as despair filled everyone’s face, a beam of light came shooting out from below.
