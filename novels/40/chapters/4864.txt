Yang Kai felt a crawling sensation on his scalp when he recalled the intimidating consciousness he had previously faced.

Presently, he was not powerful enough to go against the owner of that Will.

Hence, he had to immediately inform the Cave Heavens and Paradises about it, for he was no longer able to handle the matter in Black Territory on his own. The leaders of the Cave Heavens and Paradises had to intervene.

However, he had to get the answers to his questions before that.

Yang Kai directly took a seat beside Luan Bai Feng and picked up a cup of tea.

It was apparent that Luan Bai Feng was in a jovial mood. As she gazed at him, she asked smilingly, “How do you feel?”

In a muffled voice, Yang Kai replied, “I’m fine. It seems that I’ve found a goal in my life.”

There was a fervent expression on Luan Bai Feng’s face, “Our goal is to sacrifice everything for our Master, including our lives!”

Yang Kai bowed his head, “Is Master in Black Territory now?”

Luan Bai Feng was shocked, “How do you know?”

Yang Kai explained nonchalantly, “When I was investigating Black Territory over the past few days, I noticed something and had a speculation.”

“I see.” Luan Bai Feng didn’t ask what he had seen. Since they were companions, she could trust him unconditionally.

“Do you have a way to let me see Master?” Yang Kai asked.

Luan Bai Feng shook her head, “We can’t do that now, for Master is still asleep. The last time he awakened momentarily, he only gave some brief instructions, so I can’t bring you to see him. However, our main goal now is to help Master break free from his shackles.”

Yang Kai arched his brow, “Break free from his shackles?” What he had just heard surprised him. He initially thought that the Black Ink Clansman was hiding in the centre of Black Territory that he had visited before; however, judging from Luan Bai Feng’s words, it seemed that the Black Ink Clansman was actually trapped there instead.

“En.” Luan Bai Feng nodded, “Master has been trapped in the Black Prison for countless years. Before coming across Master, I’d always thought that the Black Prison was just a name; however, after I met Master, I realised that the Black Prison is a real prison that’s specifically used to imprison him.”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, “What do you mean?”

He recalled the Demon Sealing Land in Ancestral Land.

Although the Divine Spirits in the Ancestral Land were aware of the Demon Sealing Land’s existence, the current generation of Divine Spirits had misunderstood the place after a long time had passed. All the Divine Spirits thought that the thing that was sealed in that place had something to do with Demons. It wasn’t until the Demon Sealing Land was opened up that they realised it was a Black Ink Sealing Land that was used to suppress a Black Giant Spirit God.

It surprised Yang Kai to learn that the situation in the Black Prison was similar.

This was a real prison where a powerful Black Ink Clansman was trapped.

While in a dazed state, Yang Kai recalled that when he visited the Black Prison for the first time, an idea came into his mind that the Black Prison could very well be a gigantic cage, but he didn’t ponder on the issue at that time.

It wasn’t until this moment that his speculation was confirmed through Luan Bai Feng’s words.

He couldn’t help but fall into his thoughts for a moment, then ask, “Are the countless Natural Spirit Arrays and Ore Stars in Black Territory part of the prison?”

With a solemn expression, Luan Bai Feng nodded, “Yes. Those so-called Natural Spirit Arrays were not naturally formed at all. Instead, they were arranged by ancient Humans; however, the people who set up the Spirit Arrays were so skillful in the Dao of Spirit Arrays that no one realised it. Everyone believed that the Spirit Arrays were naturally formed. The Spirit Arrays and Ore Stars form into a Super Array, and at its centre is where Master is imprisoned.”

There was a horrified expression on Yang Kai’s face, [The entire Black Territory is one giant Super Array. Just who could have done this?]

He increasingly felt that the situation in Black Territory was similar to that of the Ancestral Land. There was the Black Ink Sealing Land in the Ancestral Land while there was the Black Prison that was used to trap a Black Ink Clansman here.

The Ancestral Land was surrounded by the Divine Ability Sea, which served as a secondary barrier; meanwhile, there were innumerable Spirit Arrays in Black Territory which acted as a cage. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Perhaps the setups in the Ancestral Land and the Black Prison were built by the same group of people. In ancient times, a group of Great Experts clashed with the Black Ink Clan. While the Black Ink Giant Spirit God was suppressed and sealed in the Ancestral Land, the true Black Ink Clansman was imprisoned in the Black Prison.

Luan Bai Feng went on to say, “The incident took place a long time ago, so I don’t know the exact time it happened, and Master didn’t tell me about it. Perhaps to Master, it is a kind of humiliation to be trapped for so many years. His power is irresistible. The setup in the Black Prison is to prevent anyone from approaching Master and giving him a chance to escape.”

The Black Prison was originally filled with a kind of strange strength. With its influence, no one could visit the depths of the Black Prison. In that case, there wouldn’t be a risk of anyone getting turned into a Black Ink Disciple and working for the Black Ink Clan.

“Fortunately, you visited this place back then,” Luan Bai Feng looked excitedly at him.

“What does it have anything to do with me?” Although Yang Kai had a speculation in his heart, he wasn’t certain about it.

Luan Bai Feng explained with a smile, “I didn’t lie to you just now. It was the truth. It was because you moved several Ore Stars from the Inner Region to the periphery that the Super Array was weakened, which allowed me to have a chance to serve Master.”

Yang Kai lowered his gaze, “Every Ore Star in Black Territory is part of the Super Array; therefore, for every Ore Star that is removed or destroyed, the Super Array will weaken a little.”

“Exactly.” Luan Bai Feng nodded, “The removal of 30 or so Ore Stars can’t really affect the Grand Array, but what if thousands of Ore Stars are destroyed? There will come a day when Master breaks free from his prison and makes a comeback to the 3,000 Worlds. When that happens, no one will be able to stop his hegemony.”

Upon realising something, Yang Kai said, “That was why you spread the news to attract outsiders to come over and mine the Ore Stars.”

Luan Bai Feng smiled, “I don’t have enough subordinates to destroy the Ore Stars quickly. Just like you’ve said, since time immemorial, men die for wealth just as birds die for food. The rules I’ve established are reasonable, which is why many people are willing to come here and help.”

Yang Kai praised her by saying, “That’s indeed a great idea.”

“You think so too?” Luan Bai Feng appeared eager as she looked at him, “With you around, we’ll be even more efficient. I need you to tell the people from High Heaven Palace and Void Land to come over.”

“I can make the arrangements.” Yang Kai directly agreed.

“After Master breaks free, you will be rewarded,” Luan Bai Feng said with envy.

“This is what I should do. It is every Black Ink Disciple’s dream to die for Master.” Yang Kai appeared solemn as he secretly let out a sigh of relief. Judging from what she had said, it would take quite some time for the Black Ink Clansman to really break free from his prison. In other words, he still had time to stop this.

Upon recalling something, Yang Kai said, “When I investigated Black Territory some time ago, I managed to reach the centre; however, I couldn’t go any further as that area was covered with Arrays. I suppose that’s where Master is trapped.”

Luan Bai Feng nodded, “Yes, I’ve been there as well. But given my current mastery of the Dao of Spirit Arrays, I couldn’t find any loopholes to exploit, let alone a way to break them. It will only bring danger to the Master if I make any rash moves.”

“I also saw some people getting themselves killed by crashing into the Arrays.”

“I know who you’re talking about.” Luan Bai Feng let out a sigh, “They’re our companions as well; however, Master is frail now from his long imprisonment, so he needs nourishment to restore his strength.”

Yang Kai frowned, “Nourishment?”

“The World Forces that leak from their bodies after their death are the best food for Master.”

Upon learning that those in the Black Ink Clan lived on World Force, Yang Kai felt his heart sinking.

“Since that place is engulfed in the Grand Array’s power, how did they arrive there safely?”

Although the Super Array’s power had been weakened after many Ore Stars were destroyed, the strange strength was still present around the centre. Before Third-Order and Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters even arrived at that place, the heritage of their Small Universes would have been wiped out.

Luan Bai Feng replied with a smile, “That’s because they had the protection of Master’s power; otherwise, they couldn’t have reached that place given their strength.”

It was then Yang Kai realised that the Black Ink Strength could even resist the Grand Array’s power.

“Is there anything else you want to know? You can ask me anything. I’ll tell you whatever I know.” Luan Bai Feng showed complete trust in him.

“How were the cultivators turned into our companions? I can see there are many of them.”

Luan Bai Feng put on a smile, “There are indeed a lot of them. I suppose we have about 1,000 companions now; however, that’s just the beginning as we’ll have even more soon. As for how they were transformed… Well, I was the one who personally turned the cultivators into our companions initially. Those Second-Order, Third-Order and Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters are unable to resist the Black Ink Strength, so I can easily subdue them. Now, you’re able to transform others into our companions as well. Companions who have been transformed by Black Ink Insects are able to do that; however, those who are not transformed by Black Ink Insects can’t.”

“What happened next?” Yang Kai asked. Regardless of how energetic Luan Bai Feng was, it was unrealistic for her to turn 1,000 people into Black Ink Disciples on her own.

“I had more companions to help out after that. They have their own Fellow Brothers and friends. I’ve also received some Black Ink Essence from Master. It has slowly developed into such a scale, and it’ll only grow bigger in the future.”

“Black Ink Essence?” Yang Kai arched his brow as it was the first time he heard about such a term, which was why he was concerned.

Luan Bai Feng explained, “You were transformed by a Black Ink Insect that was gifted directly from Master, but he doesn’t have a lot of Black Ink Insects. They’re usually used to transform Open Heaven Realm Masters that are above the Fifth-Order. As for Black Ink Essence… you can take it as something inferior to Black Ink Insects. Although Black Ink Strength has some corrosive power, it can’t fully turn a cultivator into our companion. Black Ink Essence is different, for it can fully turn Open Heaven Realm Masters that are below the Fifth-Order into companions who would be loyal to Master.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Black Ink Insects, Black Ink Essence, Black Ink Strength… In that case, what’s inside my body is supposed to be Black Ink Essence, am I right?”

“Well, you can say that. So, you can also transform Open Heaven Realm Masters that are below the Fifth-Order. Those who are transformed by you can’t turn others into our companions. The Black Ink Strength in their body is threatening to the enemies but can’t turn them into our companions.”

“I see.” Yang Kai bowed his head, then asked for a vital piece of information, “Do you have other Black Ink Insects with you?”
