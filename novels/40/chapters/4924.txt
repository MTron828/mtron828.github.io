Thanks to Yang Kai’s performance earlier, Nu Yan’s attitude towards him became much warmer and friendlier; moreover, he would glance at Yang Kai from time to time with a thoughtful expression.

Leading the Black Ink Disciples under his command, Nu Yan left the gambling arena and found a place to rest. He even handed many cultivation resources to Yang Kai so that the latter could recover sooner.

Yang Kai could only show a grateful attitude. The truth was that the previous fight against the Bright King Cave Heaven cultivator had not exhausted him to a great extent. He had been holding back his strength all this time, so he only looked like he was in a wretched condition on the surface. Nevertheless, in order not to expose his secret, Yang Kai was forced to suppress his recovery ability as much as possible. In this way, it took him three whole days before he returned to his peak.

During these three days, he repeatedly felt Nu Yan watching him with a vaguely meaningful look. These occurrences made him somewhat vigilant. He even wondered whether he had accidentally revealed his secrets and caused Nu Yan to become suspicious of him. Upon careful consideration though, Yang Kai realised that his worries were unwarranted. He had not made any mistakes, so Nu Yan could not have figured out anything; even so, he could not understand what Nu Yan was thinking.

When Yang Kai opened his eyes on the third day, it was obvious that Nu Yan had been waiting for a long time. Nu Yan’s gaze immediately swept in his direction, and he called out, “A-1!”

Yang Kai stood up and cupped his fist, “How may I help you, Master?”

“With your ability, how many battles can you win if you fought consecutive rounds against Humans in the same Order without any rest?” Nu Yan asked.

Yang Kai did not know why Nu Yan was asking about this. He thought to himself that it was impossible for him to lose against opponents in the same Order no matter how many of them he fought, but he answered cautiously, “Three battles, at most.”

Nu Yan raised his eyebrows, “Three? Very good!” While saying that, he stood up and looked in a certain direction, “I’m going to bring you to a gambling arena. Can you guarantee that you will be undefeated in all three battles?”

Yang Kai frowned and asked, “This subordinate has just shown his face in the gambling arena a few days ago. Will anybody be willing to be my opponent if we go again now?”

His previous battle against the Bright King Cave Heaven cultivator had been witnessed by many Black Ink Clansmen. No matter how much he had suppressed his strength, his victory would not change. There might not be anybody who was willing to take up the challenge due to the skills Yang Kai showed in the earlier battle.

Nu Yan chuckled, “Rest assured, there will definitely be contenders. Even if there aren’t, I’ll think of a way. You don’t need to worry about this. However, I need you to guarantee me that you will never lose. If you think that you are incapable of continuing, then let me know in advance.”

He was reluctant to lose a servant like Yang Kai. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Yes!” Yang Kai responded.

“Let’s go!” Nu Yan beckoned with his hand and led his Black Ink Disciples towards the gambling arena once more.

A short while later, they arrived at a crater where two Black Ink Disciples were fighting. The surrounding area was as lively as ever. This was undoubtedly a deathmatch. The two Black Ink Disciples were struggling desperately, each unleashing their respective Secret Techniques and Divine Abilities. It was an extraordinarily heated battle, and the cheers rang out endlessly from the crowd.

After waiting for some time, the fight between the two Black Ink Disciples finally came to an end. The winner survived, and the loser died. Sometimes, the fate of Black Ink Disciples lay at the whims of the Black Ink Clan.

When the victorious Black Ink Disciple left the arena, Nu Yan signalled Yang Kai with a look.

Yang Kai immediately understood and flew down into the crater. It had only been three days since he last fought a valiant battle here, so many Black Ink Clansmen recognised him when he suddenly showed up here. They immediately looked enthusiastic, chatting while watching with great interest. Be that as it may, no Black Ink Clansman sent their own Black Ink Disciple into the arena.

This couldn’t be helped as Yang Kai’s performance a few days ago had been too extraordinary. If somebody entered the arena without confidence, they would only suffer a tragic end. It was not easy to obtain Black Ink Disciples, so the Black Ink Clan was not willing to squander them carelessly. Naturally, there were many Black Ink Clansmen who showed interest in Yang Kai. It was just that they could only shake their heads regretfully after asking the opinions of the Black Ink Disciples under their command.

Despite waiting for a while, nobody stepped forward to accept the challenge. Yang Kai remained standing in the middle of the crater, looking rather bored. A Black Ink Clansman soon yelled from the surrounding area, “Nu Yan, nobody will accept your challenge if you send this person into battle! Change him for someone else!”

Nu Yan bared his teeth in annoyance. He originally thought that he could get lucky, and a Black Ink Clansman who was not aware of Yang Kai’s strength would send their Black Ink Disciple into battle. Who could have known that there were no reckless fools around today? Needless to say, the Black Ink Clansmen who witnessed the battle three days ago would not be deceived, and those who had not witnessed the battle in person learned about the situation after making some enquiries.

Since he could not rely on luck, then he could only lure others in with the temptation of profit.

Nu Yan chuckled and spoke in a carrying voice, “It is true that my Black Ink Disciple is quite strong. I’ve never seen anybody else in the same Order who is more powerful than him. But, since he is already standing in the arena, it’s a pity to leave without even fighting. Let’s do this instead. We’ll fight a life bout. Whoever wins the battle can go ahead and take him away. Whoever loses the battle will only need to pay me 100 Black Ink Coins.”

As soon as this statement came out, an uproar broke out among the Black Ink Clansmen. Nu Yan’s words were too brazen. It was almost like he was implying that it was impossible for his Black Ink Disciple to be defeated.

A Black Ink Clansman immediately asked eagerly, “Nu Yan, are you serious?”

The value of a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Black Ink Disciple was not low. If a Sixth-Order Black Ink Disciple were to be traded, they would definitely be sold for tens of thousands of Black Ink Coins. It had to be said that tens of thousands of Black Ink Coins would be a sizable chunk of wealth to a High-Rank Black Ink Clan.

Even if they lost, the compensation was not too high. There would not be any deaths either since it was a life bout. In other words, they did not need to worry about their Black Ink Disciples dying and only needed to pay 100 Black Ink Coins.

It was only 100 Black Ink Coins; who could not afford something like that? Even the Low-Rank Black Ink Clansmen could bring out 100 Black Ink Coins at will.

Nu Yan nodded, “Of course, I’m being serious. That is something I announced in public, so how can I go back on my words?”

Upon hearing those words, the Black Ink Clansmen immediately became agitated and sent the Black Ink Disciples under their command into the arena. Dozens of Black Ink Disciples instantly took to the air and landed inside the crater.

Originally, Yang Kai stood alone in the gambling arena, now, a dozen or so figures were present.

Nu Yan chuckled, “Are you planning to gang up on me? If that’s the case, I will have to admit defeat.”

Many of the Black Ink Clansmen looked around at each other. Nobody was willing to let their Black Ink Disciples retire from this battle. It was a great opportunity after all. Therefore, they all waited for the others to withdraw their Black Ink Disciples from the battlefield.

After a period of stalemate, Nu Yan came up with a suggestion, “Let’s do this. I’ll ask my Black Ink Disciple to randomly pick an opponent. Whomever he chooses will be the opponent in this battle, so there’s no need to argue over this matter. What do you think?”

This suggestion naturally received unanimous approval from everybody, so they nodded in agreement.

Only then did Nu Yan lower his head to look at Yang Kai, “Choose one yourself.”

Yang Kai swept his eyes over the crowd and randomly pointed a finger at a handsome young man, “You!”

The young man nodded lightly, and the other Black Ink Disciples left the battlefield after receiving orders from their respective Masters. Soon, only Yang Kai and the young man were left on the battlefield.

Nu Yan said, “Once you’re ready, you may start at any time.”

As soon as those words rang out, Yang Kai slammed into his opponent like an arrow released from the string. His large hand reached out as World Force surged around his palm.

The young man had obviously seen the battle three days ago, so he knew Yang Kai’s strength. As soon as he saw Yang Kai making a move, how could he dare to let his opponent approach him? He immediately fled to the back and simultaneously cast a Secret Technique.

The Secret Technique blasted at Yang Kai, but Yang Kai neither dodged nor avoided the attack and instead threw out a punch.

The battle was quite fierce. The young man was quite strong. Having originated from a Cave Heaven or Paradise, he was not an average Master. Both parties exchanged blows furiously, allowing the Black Ink Clan to enjoy the battle with relish.

For Yang Kai, this kind of battle was nothing special. It was just that he needed to moderately show off his strength without exposing too much, so suppressing his power was actually the most difficult part.

The intense battle lasted for an incense stick, and in the end, Yang Kai found an opportunity to punch the young man so hard that he coughed up blood and flew out. During that interval, Yang Kai did not pursue victory and simply stood silently in place.

The young man gasped for breath for some time before he cupped his fist and flew away without a word.

The corners of Nu Yan’s mouth curled into a smile at the sight. After receiving the 100 Black Ink Coins from the master of the Black Ink Disciple earlier, he glanced at Yang Kai questioningly, to which Yang Kai nodded lightly in response.

Seeing that, Nu Yan suddenly became confident and shouted, “The rules for the next battle will remain the same, but the loser will have to pay me 500 Black Ink Coins!”

Many Black Ink Clansmen were stunned.

Generally speaking, Black Ink Disciples would need to rest after each fight. It was not common for them to fight consecutive battles. Of course, it had happened once three days ago, the result of which was Lang Ya’s Black Ink Disciple from Bright King Cave Heaven being snatched by Nu Yan.

The strength of Black Ink Disciples in the same Order did not vary greatly, so it was very difficult for them to bear the burden of continuous battles; hence, Nu Yan’s practice was undoubtedly reckless. The number of Black Ink Coins might have increased from 100 to 500, but it was still within an acceptable range. 500 Black Ink Coins was not too much. Not to mention, his Black Ink Disciple had already fought once, so his strength must have declined by now.

The astonishment of the Black Ink Clan lasted only for a moment. Following that, a dozen or so Black Ink Disciples flew down and stood in front of Yang Kai once more.

Yang Kai didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. At this point, how could he not know what Nu Yan was planning? Nu Yan was totally regarding him as a money tree!

[No wonder he previously asked me how many battles I could last. He even repeatedly told me that I must not lose and to tell him in advance if I was too tired to continue fighting.]

Despite understanding the situation, Yang Kai could only go along with the arrangement. Fortunately, Nu Yan only wanted to earn Black Ink Coins, so the battles were not deathmatches; otherwise, Yang Kai truly had no idea whether he could kill or not.

The same scene as earlier, along with the same rules. Yang Kai randomly chose his next opponent.

The Masters of those Black Ink Disciples who were not selected sighed in disappointment, but there was nothing they could do. In their opinion, this was a great opportunity to pick up a bargain. It was a pity that they failed to grasp the chance twice.

Be that as it may, reality turned out to be beyond their expectations. At the end of the second battle, Yang Kai won again. Although it looked like the battle had exhausted him, he pummelled his opponent to the point where they were coughing up blood. It was obvious that his opponent could no longer continue the fight.

Nu Yan was smiling so widely that his teeth could be seen. After receiving the 500 Black Ink Coins, he shot another inquiring look at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai regretted saying that he could fight three battles in a row. If he had known this would happen, he would never have given such an answer. His careless answer had made things difficult for him to quit now, so he could only nod lightly in silence. Sitting down cross-legged, he seized the time to ‘recover his strength’ as though he was extremely exhausted.

Many Black Ink Clansmen turned their eyes to Nu Yan and waited for him to speak, and they were not disappointed as Nu Yan soon shouted, “This is the last match! The rules will remain the same. If you win, you can take him with you. If you lose, you have to cough up 1,000 Black Ink Coins.”

Compared to a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Black Ink Disciple worth tens of thousands of Black Ink Coins, 1,000 Black Ink Coins were undoubtedly worth betting. Especially since Yang Kai had already gone through two consecutive battles. The chances of winning were astronomical at this point.
