Qian Tong smiled kindly, “Don’t be nervous, young man, this old master stopped you just to ask you a few questions. En, if you answer well, these are yours.”

Saying so, Qian Tong took out a few pieces of High-Rank Saint Crystals and threw them on the table.

The shop hand’s eyes bulged at that moment. By serving tea and water here, he could perhaps earn two or three Low-Rank Saint Crystals per month, so these few High-Rank Saint Crystals on the table were a shocking amount of wealth for him.

By being frugal, he wouldn’t have to worry about eating and drinking for the rest of his life.

He quickly nodded and bowed deeply, “Please ask, Senior, if this little one knows anything, he will surely say it. Although this little one is just an ordinary person who has not cultivated, he is still a native of this place. If Senior wants to know something, this little one will surely not disappoint!”

“Very good.” Qian Tong nodded, satisfied that the shop hand was so cooperative and asking directly, “This old master wants to ask you, are there any Origin King Realm masters on this star?”

“Origin Kings?” The shop hand looked at Yang Kai and the others gathered around the table in amazement before wearing a look of understanding and laughing, “Seniors should not be natives of my Green Mountains Star, yes?”

“You’re quite sharp!” Qian Tong didn’t try to deny it; after all, if he was born on this star, he wouldn’t be ignorant of this kind of thing.

An Origin King was a peak existence on any Cultivation Star, so if such a master lived on Green Mountains Star, they would surely be famous.

The shop hand laughed dryly, “Senior jests, this little one was speculating thoughtlessly. En, but since several Seniors have come to Green Mountains Star at this time, why do you not even know about such things?”

“Why should we know about them?” Qian Tong coldly snorted.

The shop hand didn’t panic nor become anxious, simply answering, “Since several Seniors are here, this little one assumes you have come for the grand event. Although it’s still a bit early, that should not matter much, it’s only another two years or so before it begins. En, regarding whether there are Origin Kings here, heh heh... when did Green Mountains Star lack a master of this level?”

He wore a proud expression, as if Origin Kings could be seen everywhere on this Green Mountains Star.

Everyone exchanged a glance and saw the interest in each other’s eyes, signalling for the shop hand to continue talking.

“Truthfully, there are now two or three Origin Kings on our Green Mountains Star. At its peak, Green Mountains Star had more than ten, two who had reached the peak of the Third-Order Origin King Realm.”

“Two Third-Order Origin Kings?” Qian Tong and the others trembled, their eyes bulging slightly, shocked by the words of the shop hand.

“Is that really true?” Mo Yu asked in a deep voice.

“This little one would not dare to lie, everyone knows about this kind of thing. If Senior wishes to confirm it, it will be as simple as asking around.”

“So this Green Mountains Star is quite suitable for breaking through to the Origin King Realm?” Qian Tong’s eyes brightened as his face filled with excitement.

Although he didn’t feel World Principle shackles here like on Shadowed Star, he still needed to inquire about whether it was suitable to stay here and attempt a breakthrough.

Now that he obtained such information from the shop hand, he was of course quite happy.

“Naturally,” The shop hand nodded his head with a triumphant look, “Did several Seniors not come here for this matter?”

“You can even see this?” Qian Tong was surprised.

“Senior must be joking, although this little one is an ordinary mortal, word of this once-in-a-lifetime event has already spread across all of Green Mountains Star. Even three-year-old children have heard about it now, so how could this little one be ignorant of it?” The shop hand replied seriously.

“Wait, what once-in-a-lifetime event?” Yang Kai looked at him curiously. This shop hand had mentioned something about this before, but Yang Kai hadn’t cared too much. Every Cultivation Star has its own customs and special events. For example, Shadowed Star’s Flowing Flame Sand Field only opened once every few hundred years.

This Green Mountains Star obviously had similar occasions.

However, listening to what the shop hand said, it seemed this particular event was somehow related to Qian Tong and the other’s breakthrough, so Yang Kai immediately took an interest.

Hearing his question, the shop hand was stunned and scratched his head before asking, “Was I mistaken? Did several Seniors not come here to participate in the Blood Prison Trial?”

“Blood Prison Trial?” Qian Tong and others looked at each other with blank expressions.

“Tell us in detail, what is this Blood Prison Trial?” Yang Kai threw a few more pieces of High-Rank Saint Crystals on the table and said lightly.

The shop hand gulped hard as his face filled with joy. Knowing he had run into some rich and powerful masters today, he dared not be negligent, quickly cleared his throat, and said, “The Blood Prison Trial is specifically for powerful masters such as several Seniors.”

“Why do you say that?” Qian Tong raised his brow.

“Because those who participate in the Blood Prison Trial are all top masters at the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm. This little one has heard that these masters participate because they can obtain an opportunity to break through to the Origin King Realm!” The shop hand said enthusiastically.

“Really?” Qian Tong suddenly stood up, his expression extremely excited.

The shop hand was taken aback but quickly nodded, “This little one dares not deceive several Seniors. Everything this little one has said about the Blood Prison Trial is true, but as for the specific situation, this little one is unfortunately ignorant. Several Seniors should also be able to see that this little one is just an ordinary person who has never even cultivated before, so I do not know the details of the Blood Prison Trial.”

“Then what do you know?” Yang Kai signalled Qian Tong to sit down again before turning to the shop hand to ask.

“This little one knows that each of the Lords that managed to achieve their Origin Kings Realm in Green Mountains Star has participated in the Blood Prison Trial. Not only them, but there are also many Origin Kings from other Cultivation Stars who came to this star to participate in the Blood Prison trial.”

“There are cultivators from other Cultivation Stars here right now?” Qian Tong frowned.

“Yes, as early as a few years ago, some cultivators from other Cultivation Stars arrived on Green Mountains Star, but their number isn’t that large. However, as the time approaches for the trial to begin, more and more people will come here, which is why this little one thought that several Seniors...” The shop hand glanced around at Qian Tong and the others anxiously.

“So that’s how it is!” Yang Kai nodded, “Good, talk about this Blood Prison Trial. Just tell us whatever you know, even if it’s some trivial details or rumours, we won’t mind.”

Qian Tong and others echoed this sentiment as they turned expectant looks towards the shop hand.

The shop hand calmed himself for a moment before he began explaining again.

The Blood Prison Trial was the biggest event on Green Mountains Star, and it only occurred once every thousand years. Every time this trial opened, it would attract a large number of Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators, but the trial itself was quite bloody and many cultivators would fall during it.

But just as there were great dangers, great opportunities also existed.

Quite often, new Origin Kings would emerge from this trial!

Sometimes there would be more than one!

So even if it was dangerous, Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters flocked to it.

This trial was no different from bringing thousands of masters together to cross a single-plank bridge. Throughout the Star Field, there were countless Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters, but Origin Kings were extremely rare, and even though there were many opportunities to be had inside the Blood Prison Trial, it was still extremely difficult to break through.

Many, if not most of the Third-Order masters who rushed into the Blood Prison Trial would fall, and perhaps none of them would be able to break through when all was said and done, but that was still not enough to extinguish the determination of those masters to pursue great heights.

The reason why the Blood Prison Trial had such a magical effect was because of the existence of Domain.

There were many pockets of incomplete Domain inside the Blood Prison Trial which Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators could absorb, and if they could gain enough comprehension regarding Domain, they would have a chance to break through.

“Why is this Blood Prison flooded with the power of Domain? And why are these Domains incomplete?” Qian Tong asked curiously.

“It is said this was the result from a great war,” The shop hand had an innate gift for storytelling, so his explanations were clear and easy to understand.

According to his description, the Blood Prison was once a battlefield, a battlefield where more than twenty Origin Kings and a large number of their subordinates fought.

In an ancient era, Green Mountains Star had two top masters at the Third-Order Origin King Realm, and even considering the entire Star Field they these two were amongst the strongest.

Each of these Origin Kings led a great force and were bitter enemies with one another, with many grudges and fights between their respective forces.

These grievances piled up for hundreds, even thousands of years, and eventually came to a head where even the two great masters became personally involved.

Not only that, but the two masters also widely invited their friends and allies to come and assist them.

Friends of Origin Kings were naturally other Origin Kings.

And so, a battle which could destroy stars broke out somewhere on Green Mountains Star.

In that battle, not only did more than twenty Origin Kings participate, but innumerable disciples from various Sects and forces were involved.

The casualties were countless!

No one knows what the final result of that great war was, only that when it ended, the land was covered in mountains of bones and rivers of blood.

From the twenty-odd Origin Kings who participated, it seemed like none survived.

From then on, this place had been called the Blood Prison by the people of Green Mountains Star, and it was rumoured that the land inside was still dyed red, as if the blood split during that battle still remained.

This was how the Blood Prison was formed.

Inside the Blood Prison, there were all kinds of broken Domains, their power dangerous and unpredictable. Those below the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm who entered basically could not survive, only those at the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, at certain times, could delve into the Blood Prison to try to gain benefits from the broken Domains.

If one was lucky enough, they may be able to break through to the Origin King Realm.

If this was all though, it may not be enough to attract so many Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters.

However, it was also rumoured that there were still artifacts used by those ancient Origin Kings inside the Blood Prison! Each of those artifacts was Origin King Grade, treasures difficult to find in the outside world.

It seemed that the inheritance of the two top masters was also hidden somewhere inside.

If someone could obtain one of these inheritances, they could undoubtedly break through to the Origin King Realm in the future, and possibly even reach the height those two masters reached in time.

With so many temptations and all kinds of benefits, the Blood Prison had an allure that many found difficult to resist.

Whenever the Blood Prison Trial opened, Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters who heard the news would come from all over the Star Field to participate.

This was also the liveliest time on Green Mountains Star.

It was still two or three years until the next Blood Prison Trial would start, so the shop hand misunderstood Qian Tong’s questions.

He thought Qian Tong and the others had come here to participate in the Blood Prison Trial after hearing the news.
