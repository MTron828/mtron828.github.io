After Zhang Ruo Xi sealed the Source inside the Embodiment, her face suddenly turned pale.

Although she appeared nonchalant, it obviously took her a lot of strength to do all this. After looking around, she raised her hand again, upon which the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal, which was taken away by Shi Huo, whooshed towards her and fell into her hand.

“Sir, I’ll keep this gift that you’ve given me,” she clenched the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal as her eyes were filled with sorrow.

“Where are you going?” Yang Kai was shocked as he could hear the hidden meaning in her words.

Zhang Ruo Xi pressed her lips together and replied, “My Bloodline Power has awakened, so I have to inherit my ancestor’s power.”

Hearing that, Yang Kai turned to look at the Blood Gate.

Zhang Ruo Xi put on a smile as the coldness on her face melted in an instant. In a soft voice, she said, “Sir, once I can come out of the Blood Gate, I’ll be able to help you, and I won’t hold you back anymore. We’ll never go through incidents like what happened today again.”

Yang Kai parted his lips to say something, but in the end sighed, “It’s not your fault. It was me who couldn’t protect you.”

Zhang Ruo Xi shook her head, “It’s not Sir’s fault. It’s me who was too wilful.”

Without dwelling on the subject, Yang Kai stared at her and asked, “Must you go?”

With a determined expression, Zhang Ruo Xi nodded.

After that nod, Yang Kai went on to say, “Go then. It’s your ancestor’s power, so you can’t ignore it; however, you must be careful.”

“I will,” Zhang Ruo Xi said with slightly teary eyes. Then, she took a look at Xiao Xiao, “Sir, I’ll take Xiao Xiao with me. I’ll make sure that he inherits the power of Tai Yue. Please tell the Stone Spirit Clan members about it later.”

“Good,” Yang Kai nodded.

All the Stone Spirit Clan members came out this time because they wanted to send Xiao Xiao into the Blood Gate to inherit the power of Divine Spirit Tai Yue; however, things turned out to be the opposite of their expectations. Since Zhang Ruo Xi would bring Xiao Xiao with her now, there wouldn’t be any problem.

“Xiao Xiao, after you enter the Blood Gate, you must listen to Ruo Xi and must not cause her any trouble,” Yang Kai reminded Xiao Xiao.

Xiao Xiao kept nodding and grunting, as though he was telling Yang Kai that he would be obedient.

“Don’t worry, Sir. Since Uncle Stone can inherit Shi Huo’s Source, I’m sure Xiao Xiao will be able to inherit Tai Yue’s Source as well,” Zhang Ruo Xi reassured him.

Then, she turned to look at Fan Wu and the others. In an instant, her expression turned cold as she said sternly, “If anything happens to Sir in the Ancient Lands, I’ll kill you all after I return from the Blood Gate!”

She made no attempt to be polite with her speech. If anyone spoke to Fan Wu and the other Divine Venerables in such a manner, they would’ve pounced on that person; however, since it was Zhang Ruo Xi who was speaking, they all appeared meek now.

In an anxious manner, Fan Wu cupped his fists and uttered, “Don’t worry, Madam. As long as I’m alive, I’ll make sure nothing will happen to your Sir.”

Luan Feng and Cang Gou nodded sternly. Judging from the current situation, they thought that if they wanted to live their lives peacefully, they had to strike up a good relationship with Yang Kai. If they were on favourable terms with Yang Kai, then this Heavens Order’s descendant would probably stop finding fault with them.

At that instant, Yang Kai looked like a golden treasure in their eyes.

“Sir…” Zhang Ruo Xi turned to look at Yang Kai with a gaze that was filled with grief. Pressing her lips together, she said, “I’ll take my leave now.”

Yang Kai remained seated on the ground with a dejected expression, but he still forced a smile and replied, “It’s not like one of us is heading to the next life. We’ll meet again one day. I’ll wait for you to come out of the Blood Gate.”

Zhang Ruo Xi hung her head low as her face started blushing. In a nervous manner, she uttered, “Sir, before I go, can you grant a wish of mine?”

She appeared diffident when she said that as she stole a glance at Yang Kai. Apparently, she was feeling guilty.

With a smile, Yang Kai replied, “Good, even if you have a hundred wishes, I’ll grant all of them. As long as I can do it, I’ll do it for you.”

“Then… close your eyes…” Zhang Ruo Xi clenched her teeth and mustered all her courage. Upon finishing her words, she felt her face burning.

Fan Wu and the others looked dazedly at them with meaningful expressions on their faces. It was then they came to the realization that they had underestimated the relationship between Yang Kai and this Heavens Order’s descendant. They thought that they were just good friends, possibly even Master and Disciple, but it turned out that Zhang Ruo Xi harboured stronger feelings than that.

If that was the case, they had to do more than just maintain a good rapport with Yang Kai. In fact, they had to obey all his orders. Just like what Yang Kai had said, life was full of uncertainties, and they might need to ask for his help one day.

Although Yang Kai was referring to the Stone Spirit Clan when he said that, and Fan Wu had refused to accept it at that time, Yang Kai was now proven right.

Yang Kai was shocked upon hearing this request. He was no longer an inexperienced young man, so he could figure out her intentions through her demeanour and tone. Then, he sighed secretly and thought about how he had never dared to flirt with any woman since he came to Star Boundary; after all, he was far away from his homeland. More importantly, Su Yan, Xia Ning Chang, Shan Qing Luo, and Xue Yue were waiting for him.

Although he had ventured into Star Boundary for many years, he had always remained disciplined in his everyday life, as he had never been intimate with any woman; however, he was still a man with physical needs. After giving it a brief thought, he still closed his eyes.

Zhang Ruo Xi bit her lip as her heart pounded against her chest. Her heartbeat was as intense as that of someone thumping against a war drum, and her face became scorching hot.

She approached Yang Kai slowly and crouched down before cupping his face with trembling hands. Then, as her eyelashes fluttered, she closed her eyes anxiously and pressed her lips forward.

Soon, Yang Kai felt a warm sensation on his forehead, and he got a whiff of an intoxicating scent that was wafting from her. At the same time, he felt ticklish as her hair whisked across his face.

That moment seemed very short, but it also seemed to have lasted for a thousand years. Like a terrified rabbit, Zhang Ruo Xi jumped away as her vision became blurred. With her ears turning completely red, she said anxiously, “S-Sir, I really have to go now. Please take good care of yourself.”

Upon finishing her words, she charged towards the Blood Gate, as though she didn’t dare to stay there any longer. All of a sudden, her legs turned to jelly, and she almost tripped over a stone on the ground.

*Ha…*

Cang Gou almost couldn’t suppress his urge to laugh out loud.

Feeling ashamed, Zhang Ruo Xi immediately glowered at Cang Gou, whose smile froze and his forehead beaded with cold sweat.

“Take care of my Sir. Otherwise, all of you will pay the price!” After Zhang Ruo Xi finished speaking, she dashed into the Blood Gate and disappeared from everyone’s sight. Standing in front of Yang Kai, Xiao Xiao kept whimpering as though he was bidding him farewell. Then, he waved his hand at the Stone Spirit Clan members, who were still waiting in the distance, before he sprinted towards the Blood Gate as well.

Soon after, a crashing sound could be heard, upon which the Blood Gate Restricted Area, which had resided in the Ancient Wild Lands for countless years, disappeared all of a sudden, as though it had never existed before.

After the Blood Gate disappeared, the suppressive power that had been filling the air vanished as well.

Fan Wu and the others heaved a sigh of relief as they were glad that they had managed to survive in the end. At the same time, they felt fortunate that Zhang Ruo Xi was finally gone. If she stayed there any longer, they would have had a hard time breathing.

After trading glances, they sprinted forward and reached Yang Kai before cupping their fists, “Sir Yang, congratulations!”

At that moment, they didn’t dare to be haughty in front of Yang Kai anymore and all appeared humble. It was as though they were worried that Yang Kai might be displeased at their behaviour, which would lead him to making a complaint to the Heavens Order’s descendant in the future.

Yang Kai was still reminiscing about the kiss as he touched his own forehead. Upon hearing what they had said, he looked up at them and asked in an exasperated manner, “What’s there to congratulate me for?”

Certainly, he knew why they congratulated him. Anyone who managed to gain the favour of the Heavens Order’s descendant could literally walk sideways in Star Boundary, and even the Great Emperors had to show that person some respect.

“Did you congratulate me because I can now eat soft rice for the rest of my life?” Yang Kai grunted in an unhappy tone and shot a glance at them, “Do I look like a little white face to you?”

At that instant, Fan Wu and the others were lost for words as they didn’t know what was on Yang Kai’s mind. Rooted to the spot, they all remained silent and appeared embarrassed.

“You can leave. I still have something to do.” Yang Kai waved his hands, then he thought of something, “Let the Stone Spirit Clan members stay.”

“Yes!” Fan Wu and the others hurriedly cupped their fists and respectfully left the place.

After they were gone, Yang Kai looked up at the sky and saw Bing Yun’s Third Disciple was frowning, standing on the clouds, appearing displeased, pouting as she stared fixedly in the direction where the Blood Gate used to exist.

She had come to this place with Zhang Ruo Xi, but now that her friend was gone, she was left alone here. Having lost her mind, she couldn’t understand what was going on at the moment.

“Third Disciple!” Yang Kai called out to her.

Hearing his voice, Third Disciple immediately looked in his direction. Upon making out his face, she became cheerful and uttered, “Come catch me! Come catch me!”

Upon finishing her words, she seemed ready to flee from this place to continue the game of hide-and-seek with Yang Kai.

“Third Disciple, stop playing around! Don’t you want to meet Senior Bing Yun, An Ruo Yun, Sun Yun Xiu and Zhang Sun Ying?” After what happened to Zhang Ruo Xi, Yang Kai wasn’t in the mood to play with the Third Disciple anymore, so he directly dropped the names of those she cared about.

As expected, the Third Disciple seemed to have been impacted as she stopped running away. Then, she slowly turned around, and her eyes could be seen trembling, which suggested that her thoughts were in chaos.

Yang Kai was worried that something would happen to her, but to his surprise, in just a short moment, her eyes seemed to have cleared up, and she asked through clenched teeth, “You know my Honoured Master?”

She looked just like a healthy person when she spoke, almost like she had regained her sanity.

“Yes,” Yang Kai nodded.

“She…” The Third Disciple became agitated all of a sudden as she stared nervously at Yang Kai, “Is she still alive?”

With a solemn expression, Yang Kai replied, “Senior Bing Yun has returned to Ice Heart Valley. Your Senior Sisters and Junior Sisters are worried about you, and they have not stopped looking for you all this time.”
