“Sir!” Yang Kai stood in the hall, crossing his fist across his chest.

Saint Xu turned around, but the smile that had always been on his face was absent this time, while his eyes were dignified and solemn. He asked quickly, “You should know why I called you over, right?”

Yang Kai replied, “I heard that there is going to be a final battle!”

“Indeed!” Xu gave a slight nod, “It’s the final battle, and our victory depends on this one move!”

Yang Kai frowned and asked, “Forgive me for asking, but how are we going to seal the Two Worlds Passage? Have you found a way?”

Xu finally smiled, “Yes! I can’t reveal the specific method to you yet, but I can guarantee that this is a feasible method.”

He was a Shaman Saint, so there was no need to promise a Shaman King anything, but since he said so, he obviously had great confidence in this method.

Yang Kai nodded to express his understanding, “Then what did Sir summon me for?”

Xu grew somber again and declared, “I need you to put this method into effect!”

“Me?” Yang Kai was stunned, “There are Shaman Saints here, why me?”

Xu explained, “This method needs to be carried out by surprise, so it’s too conspicuous for me or the other three Shaman Saints to do it. Only the Shaman Kings stand a chance to succeed, and among all Shaman Kings, you are the strongest, and the Shaman Niu Clan is also the most elite force, so we chose you, and your Shaman Niu Clan, to take up this task!”

Yang Kai fell silent for a while. He did not decline, but opened his mouth, “What are we supposed to do specifically?”

“You don’t need to know now. Someone will inform you before the final battle begins. You just need to tell me, can you take up this responsibility?” For the first time, there was a majesty in Xu’s gaze, and it felt as if a burning flame made manifest was staring at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai grinned, “I don’t think Sir would specifically summon me if I couldn’t.”

Xu laughed heartily, patted Yang Kai’s shoulder, and said warmly, “Rest assured, on the day of the final battle, all Barbarians will strive to create an opportunity for you. You only need to execute the plan.”

“When will the final battle be?” Yang Kai raised his head to ask.

“In five days!”

After returning from his meeting with Xu, Yang Kai did not cultivate in retreat.

Five days was not enough to improve his strength, so he walked slowly around the Shaman Niu Clan’s base, studying the familiar and unfamiliar faces of his clansmen. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Every Ancient Barbarian who saw him saluted with utmost respectfully.

The news of the final battle seemed to have spread out, and the hundred thousand clansmen of the Shaman Niu Clan had already begun preparing. The warriors sharpened their weapons, and the cavalry fed their mounts, all of them preparing to perform their best in the upcoming fight.

The archers crafted arrows, and the Shaman Masters adjusted their breathing in retreat to maintain their most perfect condition, so they could display their best in five days.

Yang Kai bumped into many familiar faces, all of whom had followed him since the beginning of the war.

Less than half of the two hundred villagers from Blue South Village were left after this brutal struggle. Most of the villagers died in the war, but those who survived became far stronger.

There were more unfamiliar faces than familiar ones though. These people were recruited by the Shaman Niu Clan over the past year or so. They came from different backgrounds, but now were all part of the Shaman Niu Clan.

Yang Kai found Ah Hu, who was feeding his mount somewhere in the middle of the camp.

Ah Hu was exhilarated by Yang Kai’s arrival, left his mount, and ran over.

“What are you doing here?” Ah Hu asked.

“I came to see you guys,” Yang Kai laughed lightly, his eyes sweeping over the several dozen scars that marked Ah Hu’s body. These were all proof of his bravery in battle. The war made people grow rapidly, and the Ah Hu today was no longer a small villager of Blue South Village, but the Captain of thousands of cavalry. Based on his own strength alone, he could fight on par with a Shaman Master.

“Come here, look at my mount.” Ah Hu pulled Yang Kai to a Demon Beast. Just like his owner, this Demon Beast was covered with badges of courage, but it still brought its huge head closer to rub against Ah Hu affectionately.

Ah Hu grinned, “Not too shabby, right?”

Yang Kai reached out to pat the Demon Beast, and asked, “Have you named it?”

Ah Hu scratched his head shyly, and replied, “It’s also called Ah Niu!”

Yang Kai guffawed loudly, “It’s just like me.”

“No. It was disobedient before, so I told it that I will ask Ah Niu to give it a lesson, then it quickly became quiet. Probably because it heard that name too often, it assumed that it was its own name. Now whenever I say the name Ah Niu, it will become obedient. Tsk, this one is the kind that bullies the weak and fears the strong,” Ah Hu grinned good naturedly. Although he had grown tremendously, his smile was still the same from when he was a mere villager two years ago.

Demon Beast Ah Niu whinnied lowly, but no one knew what it meant.

“Go and see Ah Hua and the others,” Ah Hu chuckled. “They’ve been working hard since we received the news that the final battle is about to begin.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly again before he stared deeply at Ah Hu and said, “Live!”

Ah Hu responded in a laugh, “You too!”

Yang Kai turned and left.

Ah Hu shouted from behind, “Ah Niu, is this really the last battle?”

Yang Kai stopped in his tracks, and replied, “It will be the last battle, I promise!”

Ah Hu’s smile was even brighter before turning to the rest of the cavalry group next to him and shouting, “Did you hear that? Sir said this is our last battle. Give everything you have and wipe out all those Demon bastards, then all of us can go home!”

*Hou Hou Hou…*

The cavalry group roared in excitement, as if they were not going to war but coming home after victory.

Five days was neither long nor short.

Yang Kai went through the entire station with a smile on his face, nodded at every Barbarian that met his eyes, and briefly chatted with some of them.

Everyone asked him if this was the last battle.

Although the two-year war was not long, it caused an enormous amount of pain and death. The Barbarians were tired and sick of it. Knowing that this was the last battle gave them hope, and they pursued affirmation persistently.

Yang Kai gave them the hope they wanted.

However, how many of them would really live to see the end of this war? Fifty thousand? Twenty thousand? Ten thousand? Less?

Although they did not know what the Shaman Saints expected from their Shaman Niu Clan to do, it was definitely a difficult task, and to complete such a task, one must be prepared to pay the price.

Most of the Shaman Niu Clan was going to die. This battle was different, and it would not allow any retreat and timidity. In this battle, either the Barbarian Race or the Demon Race would perish, there would be no backing down.

Early in the morning five days later, the Shaman Niu Clan was ready to depart.

The hundred thousand people divided into nearly a hundred army units and lined up neatly and orderly. Although there were many people, it was completely silent save for the pounding of hearts. Everyone’s determined-filled eyes were cast on the scar in the distant sky.

Surrounding them were all allies consisting of the groups from the other Great Clans. Like the Shaman Niu Clan, everyone was silent. Nervousness and excitement bubbled within each of them, and they could not help but tighten their grip on their weapons, in hopes to get a little divine comfort.

At this moment, millions of Barbarians were all set to charge.

Without the slightest sign, a dull horn sounded.

The Shaman Kings of the Great Clans shook before they gave the signal to move out. The same went for the Shaman Niu Clan.

Yang Kai stayed at the forefront of his army, maintaining the same line with the surrounding allies. He looked around, and did not see the person Shaman Saint Xu mentioned, but he just shook off the doubts in his heart and thought about it no more.

The sound of the horn was steady and dull, just like the pace of the millions of Barbarians, the ground trembling beneath their feet.

In the distance, the Demon Race army also began to advance. During the last five days, the Barbarian Race was not the only one preparing for war, the Demon Race had been making their own preparations as well, getting ready to respond as soon as they saw any action on the Barbarian Race side.

The armies of the two Races slowly approached each other, and the breathing of the warriors became heavy. The air was slowly drenched in murderous intent, which gradually turned into an invincible momentum.

The drums of war pounded, their rhythm gradually speeding up, and the Barbarian Race army increased their pace to a brisk walk. When the beating of the drums became even closer together, the brisk walk became a jog.

The distance between the two Races quickly narrowed.

When the distance between each other shrank to just fifty kilometres, the tempo of the drums suddenly rose again!

There was a roar, and one cavalry group after another rushed out from their respective Clans. The warriors that rode their mounts under them charged forward fiercely.

Demon Qi rolled and gathered on the side of the Demon Race, engulfing the many millions of them. Although the number of the Barbarian Race was not as great, they were superior in terms of grandeur, because all the cavalries were blessed by various Shamanic Spells, and every Barbarians cavalry flashed in colourful rays of light, especially the colour green, which was the most conspicuous. It appeared as though a green ribbon was closely connecting each of the members of the cavalry group.

It was one giant Life Chain, a powerful Shamanic Spell that helped many Barbarians survive this brutal war.

Before the cavalries reached the enemy, arrows were released.

The archers of the two Races each shot deadly sharp arrows at each other’s force. The arrows flying through the sky were like locusts crossing the border. The dense arrows covered the sky and shrouded the ground.

The arrows fell from the sky, dropping one cavalry after another to the ground, but it did not stop the charge following behind from advancing, many trampling directly over the fallen. Even the strongest warrior would have been smashed into a pile of mashed meat if he was stomped on with such force.

Ah Hu turned around and looked over the crowd towards Yang Kai, while the Demon Beast under Ah Niu’s hips growled lowly, as if it was unable to suppress its urge to join the war.

It was the same for the rest of the Shaman Niu Clan’s cavalry.

But they did not move, because Yang Kai did not signal them to!

The Shaman Niu Clan was the only group that had not sent out its cavalry.

Yang Kai ignored Ah Hu’s inquiring gaze and continued to look into the distance.

Seeing this, Ah Hu retracted his gaze in disappointment and suppressed the restlessness of his mount.
