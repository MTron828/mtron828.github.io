*Dida, dida...*

The clear sound of blood dripping reached the ears of the crowd and the stench of it quickly filled the air.

Nobody seemed to understand what was going on, but they soon awoke from their daze and were shocked by the scene when they raised their eyes to Qu Huai Ren.

Qu Huai Ren’s body was frozen in place, motionless, while it was still in a pouncing posture, his hand stretched out. However, all five fingers of that hand had been cut off smoothly and cleanly, blood spurting from the wounds.

What was more shocking though was a sword had impaled Qu Huai Ren, half of the blade pierced through his back, and blood dripped down the sword tip continuously, splashing all over the ground, completely dyeing it red.

Gulping, everyone had the same thought run through their minds, [What is going on?]

They only saw Qu Huai Ren rushing toward Yang Kai aggressively, while Yang Kai waved his artifact around frantically. They all assumed that Qu Huai Ren would quickly overpower Yang Kai and snatch away the artifact, but the reality was completely different.

From the looks of it, it seemed that Qu Huai Ren had accidentally impaled himself on Yang Kai’s sword.

The blade seemed to have cut through the main arteries of the heart, leaving no possibility of survival.

Some of the cultivators’ eyes flickered in realization and the contempt and disdain they had before disappeared in a flash, replaced with solemnity as they gazed at Yang Kai.

Others still looked blank.

“You...” Qu Huai Ren said, and before he had a chance to finish the sentence, blood gushed out of his mouth uncontrollably like a fountain.

“You just sought death yourself, you can’t blame me!” Yang Kai snorted before slamming his palm against Qu Huai Ren’s chest, sending him flying.

Qu Huai Ren’s vitality quickly dissipated mid-air, and the life left his eyes. He had stopped breathing even before landing onto the ground, dying quite miserably.

How could Qu Huai Ren have known that he, the Vice Valley Master of Evil Moon Valley, would die in a small place like Maplewood City. Qu Huai Ren would never have thought that he would end like this before he came here.

“You killed Vice Valley Master Qu!” A middle-aged man suddenly declared, coldly. He seemed to be quite fond of Qu Huai Ren, so seeing him die in front of him infuriated him and was not about to let it slide. Flicking his wrist, this middle-aged man summoned a golden globe of light into his palm and shouted, “Boy! Surrender now and follow me to Evil Moon Valley to confess your crimes, and maybe you can survive, otherwise without a doubt, you will die!”

As the words fell, the golden light in his hand exploded, transforming into a big golden net directly above Yang Kai, trapping him.

He figured that one of the reasons why Qu Huai Ren died tragically at the hands of Yang Kai was his carelessness, while the other was the formidable artifact in Yang Kai’s hands. If that wasn’t the case, how could a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator be defeated in such a short time by Yang Kai’s mere First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation?

People fumble, horses stumble. Qu Huai Ren must have been too careless.

He was afraid of the razor-sharp Myriads Sword, and did not plan to fight Yang Kai head-on, instead choosing to use his artifact to restrain Yang Kai first.

Dao Source Grade energy fluctuations pulsed from the golden net. As soon it appeared, it seemed to separate everyone inside it from the outside world with an invisible force, forming a unique blockade.

“Profound Gold Heaven Capturing Net!” Someone in the crowd instantly recognized the artifact’s name, his face changing dramatically.

The middle-aged man coldly snorted then clenched his fists, focusing his attention on controlling the power of his artifact.

Yang Kai retreated a few steps, but no matter how much he tried to flee, he could not escape this Profound Gold Heaven Capturing Net. Suppressed by the invisible force, which surprised him too, Yang Kai secretly felt that this was a mysterious and intriguing artifact.

“Little brat, you can’t escape. My Profound Gold Heaven Capturing Net hasn’t failed me ever since I refined it. Give up!” The middle-aged man sneered and flipped his hand, shrinking the big golden net around Yang Kai and then condensing it into a sphere of golden light, completely sealing him inside.

“Hahahaha!” The middle-aged man laughed gleefully at this success, but soon, his smile froze and his eyes widened, “How is that possible?!”

Yang Kai, who was supposed to be bound by the Profound Gold Heaven Capturing Net, slowly faded and vanished completely.

It was just an afterimage.

“Oh oh, that was dangerous!” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly came from the side. The middle-aged man fixed his eyes on the direction of the voice and saw Yang Kai wiping the cold sweat on his forehead, still in a state of shock.

“Brat, you...” The middle-aged man’s face changed slightly as he gawked at Yang Kai, wondering how he escaped the capturing power of his artifact without him noticing.

“Not bad, not bad at all, this is a good artifact. I want it!” Yang Kai said, reaching out and grabbing at the golden light.

“Ah!” The middle-aged man was startled as he saw Yang Kai grab towards his artifact. Pushing his Source Qi madly, the man formed a series of seals with his hands.

The golden sphere buzzed and vibrated as it tried to escape Yang Kai’s grasp, violently shaking and causing his hand to ache.

This was an artifact that was painstakingly refined and shared a Soul connection with the middle-aged man, so it was only normal it would show resistance when a stranger tried to seize it.

Perceiving the resistance of this artifact, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed sharply, raised his head, and shouted to the middle-aged man, “Look here!”

“What?” The middle-aged man was trying to wrest his artifact out of Yang Kai’s control and was taken aback when he heard this shout and unconsciously looked up.

The next moment, a chill filled his heart, causing him to shudder.

A stream of pure Spiritual Energy rushed towards him at that moment, its power swift and sharp, like a sword that was thoroughly refined over and over again. Instantly, the middle-aged man’s Soul defences were cut through and a slash impacted his Knowledge Sea, raising violent wind and waves.

“Ahhhhhh...” His face turned pale immediately and he clutched his head, screaming in agony.

Everyone moved away from the middle-aged man in shock.

His Soul, spiralling out of control upon receiving the assault from Yang Kai, made the middle-aged man lose control of his Profound Gold Heaven Capturing Net.

Yang Kai pushed his Source Qi hard at that moment and directly suppressed the resisting artifact. Then, he violently poured his Spiritual Energy into the artifact, wiping away the middle-aged man’s Soul Imprint. Finished, Yang Kai tossed the golden net into his Space Ring.

This artifact was successfully stolen away by Yang Kai!

Everyone was dumbstruck and finally realized that something was not right.

Seizing another’s artifact was not something an ordinary person could do. Unless there was a massive difference in their Soul cultivations, the Soul Imprint of the original owner could not be erased in such a short period of time.

But Yang Kai accomplished just that.

In other words, given that he could erase the Soul Imprint of the middle-aged man in an instant, it meant his Soul was far stronger than that of the middle-aged man.

Everyone drew a sharp, cold breath.

“You were pretending to be weak!” Someone bellowed, finally recognising Yang Kai’s act, a look of fear covering his face.

Even if Qu Huai Ren’s death was a result of carelessness, accidentally impaling himself on Yang Kai’s sword, what happened to the middle-aged man could not be excused as an accident.

This was definitely a crushing defeat based on strength, which could not be explained by luck.

The middle-aged man rolled around the ground, clutching his head, seeming to be gravely injured. It was uncertain if he could ever recover, but even if he could, a wound on one’s Soul would take a huge amount of time and energy to repair, assuming he didn’t go insane first.

“Who else has a decent artifact? Let me have a look,” Yang Kai looked around, smiling coldly.

Everyone took a few steps back, with dark expressions on their faces.

These people originally thought of stealing Yang Kai’s artifact, but they never expected just the opposite would occur. It seemed like now that the boy had tasted the sweetness, he was wanting more...

“No, no, my artifact is only of Origin King Grade, little brother will definitely not be interested,” Someone explained sternly.

“Origin King Grade is already quite good, my artifact is only an Origin Returning Grade...” another person immediately continued.

Everyone looked at him with contempt.

The man retorted, “What’s wrong? Can’t I be poor? Is it that embarrassing for a Dao Source Realm Cultivator to use an Origin Returning Grade artifact? Why are you looking at me like that!?”

As he spoke, he turned to Yang Kai, smiled, and cupped his fists, “Little brother should have no interest in an Origin Returning Grade artifact, yes? Ah, that’s right! This little one just remembered that he has an important affair to attend to, farewell!”

With these words, without waiting for Yang Kai’s response, he fled.

The others secretly cursed him for being quick-footed and seizing this opportunity. Many others hurriedly bid goodbye to Yang Kai with cupped fists and left hastily.

“Wait!” Yang Kai suddenly snorted coldly.

Everyone turned around in shock and looked at Yang Kai vigilantly, lest he do something unfavourable to them.

“You can’t just come and go as you please! Life is not that easy!” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

Everyone gulped, their faces ugly, knowing something bad was about to happen. They were really afraid of what this little brat was going to do.

Yang Kai pointed to the ground, “Take away this corpse and the guy who sounds like a slaughtered pig!”

“Ah...”

“Yes, Yes, Yes!”

“Hurry up and help!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The crowd yelled and dragged away Qu Huai Ren’s body and the middle-aged man who was still screaming, all of them swiftly disappearing.
