Hearing what the old woman said, Yang Kai nodded, “That would be best.”

Although his attitude towards the Dao Source Fruit was indifferent, that was not the case for other Origin Kings. Once news spread out, it was likely that countless Origin Kings would hunt him down, and even Dao Source Realm masters might take action.

A Dao Source Fruit was useless to a Dao Source Realm master, but which Dao Source Realm master didn’t have descendants or Juniors?

The old woman spoke again, “Little Brother, if it is not inconvenient, please spend a few days here in my Zhang Family so this old woman can provide some appropriate hospitality.”

Yang Kai frowned and considered this proposal, feeling that it might be wrong for him to leave now. Although he did not have much friendship with this Zhang Family, he did reach an agreement with Zhang Gao Xuan after all. Now that the Zhang Family was facing a crisis, if he left and Lu Bai Chuan came, this group of orphans and widows would likely be unable to resist.

Perhaps it would be best if he used this situation to his advantage, making the Zhang Family use up one of their requests.

Just as he was thinking, Yang Kai heard a strange sound suddenly ring in his ears.

“What’s that sound?” The beautiful woman’s expression changed as she perked up her ears.

Yang Kai smiled, “It seems to be the sound of gongs and drums.”

The beautiful woman was startled and had a blank look on her face, but the old woman seemed to have thought of something and exclaimed in an enraged voice, “Lu Bai Chuan you little bastard! You’re going too far!”

Although Lu Bai Chuan’s cultivation was higher than hers, this old woman was Lu Bai Chuan’s senior by a generation, so it was not a problem for her to scold him like this.

The beautiful woman’s face changed when she heard this, “Could it be that old dog...”

The old woman glanced at the young girl who had been standing by her side, serving her attentively, and gently patted the back of her hand, “Don’t be afraid, while Grandma is still here, the Lu Family will not take you away.”

The girl was very well-behaved, and although it seemed she had a vague idea of what was transpiring, she did not look flustered and instead shook her head and spoke, “Grandma, if Ruo Xi can save the family, Ruo Xi is willing to.”

“What are you saying!” The old woman snapped and stamped her cane loudly, “Your grandfather, father, and brother all died at the hands of the Lu Family! The enmity between the Lu Family and my Zhang Family is absolutely irreconcilable! How could your grandma push you into such a fiery pit? Rest assured, grandma will guarantee your safety.”

Hearing them speak, Yang Kai immediately understood that the little girl who had been serving the old woman, Zhang Ruo Xi, was who the Lu Family wanted.

Earlier, Yang Kai had used his Divine Sense to investigate her cultivation and found she was only a First-Order Saint King, not even an Origin Returning Realm cultivator. Such cultivation could only be described as average for a fourteen or fifteen-year-old in the Star Boundary.

Moreover, although she was indeed quite pretty, she was not a country destroying beauty. It was a mystery what she possessed that caused the Lu Family to care so much about her.

Perhaps she was just an unlucky pawn that the Lu Family had randomly chosen in order to annex the Zhang Family with.

Yang Kai frowned slightly as he felt a little uncertain.

At that moment, the old woman turned her gaze to Yang Kai and said in a solemn tone, “Little Brother, this old woman must ask you something...”

Yang Kai nodded, “Please speak, old madam.”

The old woman nodded, “Little Brother’s cultivation is profound, but Lu Bai Chuan’s cultivation is comparable to yours so a fight with him would surely be difficult. This old woman will not ask you to kill him and avenge my Zhang Family, only that when the time comes, you step forward to safeguard my Zhang Family today!”

“Is this a request?” Yang Kai asked with a smile.

“Yes!” The old woman nodded solemnly while the middle-aged beauty and the young Zhang Ruo Xi also looked at Yang Kai with entreaty. After all, the only two people with any real strength in the Zhang Family at this moment were the old woman and the middle-aged woman, who were First-Order Origin Kings. However, the old woman had damaged her foundation recently by using a forbidden technique and medicine, so she was in no condition to fight.

If Yang Kai were to wipe his hands of them now, the Zhang Family would surely face calamity.

However, Lu Bai Chuan’s cultivation was on par with Yang Kai’s, so they were not certain whether Yang Kai would uphold his agreement with Zhang Gao Xuan to assist the Zhang Family; after all, what cultivator would be willing to offend another just as powerful as themselves for a mere verbal promise?

For a time, they were all very worried but did not dare to say anything.

“This request...” Yang Kai chuckled, making the three people in the hall feel like their hearts were stuck in their throats, “It’s fine with me!”

The old woman let out a sigh of relief, as did the beautiful woman and the young girl, all three of their eyes flashing with gratitude.

“But old madam, I just so happened to be in the Zhang Family this time, so keeping you safe once is not an issue, but what will happen if next time I am not here? What do you plan to do if the Lu Family comes to provoke you again? It is impossible for me to simply remain here indefinitely,” Yang Kai said lightly.

The old woman furrowed her brows and sighed forlornly, “We can only take one step at a time.”

Yang Kai quickly said, “Old madam has not thought about simply cutting weeds and pulling out roots?”

“Cutting weeds and pulling out roots!?” The old woman’s muddy eyes lit up suddenly as she asked quickly, “Is Little Brother sure? There are many people in the Lu Family, not just Lu Bai Chuan.”

“I can try!” Yang Kai declared.

The old woman was stunned and swept her eyes over Yang Kai, as if she was re-examining him. Hesitating for a moment, she ultimately spoke, “If it can be done, the Zhang Family will regard Little Brother as our greatest benefactor, ensuring that for generations to come we light incense and bow thrice in the morning and evening to pray for Little Brother’s good fortune and safety.”

“That’s not necessary...” Yang Kai smiled, “But we have to renegotiate the terms of the agreement.”

“The terms?” The old woman was startled, but immediately said with a wry smile, “I don’t know what the little brother wants? I’m afraid my Zhang Family has nothing of interest to you.”

“Old madam misunderstands, I don’t want compensation,” Yang Kai waved his hand. “However, doing this will carry a certain amount of risk for me. More importantly though, I do not like being fettered, so my proposal is, if I can eliminate the Lu Family for you, you will consider my previous agreement with Brother Zhang to be fulfilled and will no longer be able to make requests of me in the future. What do you say?”

“Little brother means...” The old woman asked cautiously.

“Either this time I ensure your safety and it will be considered a single request of the three fulfilled, meaning you still have two left, or I seek complete revenge for you and we consider all three requests fulfilled. You are free to choose.”

The old woman heard this and declared, “Naturally this old woman will choose the second option. If Little Brother can really avenge my Zhang Family, we will not seek you again in the future and will regard the agreement between you and Gao Xuan to be fulfilled. Not only that. This old woman will offer my sincere and generous gratitude.”

“Alright. Since you said it, you better mean it.” Yang Kai grinned meaningfully, in an exceptionally good mood as he stood up, “Just wait here for the good news.”

Saying so, he turned and walked out the door.

“Little Brother, this Mistress will accompany you!” The middle-aged beauty volunteered.

As these words fell, Yang Kai’s figure flickered and disappeared.

“Help me up so I can also observe,” The old woman stood up excitedly and said to Zhang Ruo Xi who was beside her.

Outside the Zhang Family Manor, a festive scene had appeared.

A procession, beating the gongs and drums, had arrived at the entrance of the manor in a mighty manner while eight strong-looking men were hoisting a sedan chair on their shoulders as well as many boxes covered with red cloth.

It was obvious at first glance it was a bridal procession and that the contents of the boxes were a dowry.

At this moment, the team had stopped outside the manor and a man who looked to be roughly forty years old and had a trimmed moustache stood at its fore. This man had sharp eyes and a powerful Third-Order Origin King cultivation.

Behind this middle-aged man, there is another young man wearing red robes, standing there with a smile, his cultivation not too high, only Third-Order Saint King. He did not seem to be very old, perhaps sixteen or seventeen, but his face was clearly drunk with happiness.

This bridal procession was now confronting the orphans and widows of the Zhang Family.

Everyone from the Zhang Family was glaring at the people of this procession with obvious rage, their strength tumbling and their auras flashing with hostility. Were it not for the vast gap in strength, these women would likely have already attacked!

“Lu Bai Chuan, you still have the face to come to my Zhang Family?” The fat cultivator who attacked Yang Kai before gritted his teeth and shouted at the lead man. “My Zhang Family has been on good terms with your Lu Family for generations, but it was all in vain! Your greed and cruelty are simply without limits! I must avenge the enmity of killing my Zhang Family’s disciples or I will not be a man!”

Lu Bai Chuan glanced at the fat cultivator faintly and said, “Junior, this old master is here today to welcome a bride into his family, so he will let you off for your rudeness this once. Call Aunt Cheng out at once.”

“You still have the face to address her as Aunt Cheng?” The thin cultivator couldn’t help but sneer, “Lu Bai Chuan, Father here has been enlightened today! Only now have I learned that your Lu Family’s skin is thicker than a city wall, impressive indeed!”

“Junior, you court death!” Regardless of anything else, Lu Bai Chuan was a Third-Order Origin King, so two Origin Returning Realm juniors clamouring and insulting him so wantonly was more than he could bear, causing an immediate and visceral response, “In front of whom are you calling yourself ‘Father’? Such impudence!”

As he shouted, he reached out to grab towards the thin cultivator.

The thin cultivator’s complexion changed as he desperately pushed his Saint Qi and Shi while at the same time trying to retreat in order to avoid Lu Bai Chuan’s blow.

But no matter how hard he tried; he was unable to escape.

The difference in strength between a First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator and a Third-Order Origin King was just too big. To put it bluntly, Lu Bai Chuan could crush him to death with a casual snap of his fingers.

Seeing that the big hand was about to grab his head, the thin cultivator steeled himself as a trace of madness flashed across his face, “Lu Bai Chuan, even if I die today, you won’t feel any better!”

As he spoke, he formed a seal with his hands and the suppressed power in his body suddenly began to riot.

“You are planning to self-destruct?” Lu Bai Chuan’s eyes narrowed slightly before he coldly snorted and said, “In front of this old master, you think you’ll have the opportunity to blow yourself up? Good, today is Tao’er’s wedding day, so we should add some excitement. Boy, surrender your life!”

Saying so, he waved his hand and a black curtain of energy suddenly enshrouded the thin cultivator.

The thin cultivator’s face went ashen with shock as he realized that he would not be able to self-destruct before this black curtain crushed him.

At that moment, the thin cultivator suddenly saw a burst of light and the black curtain which was covering him shattered like a mirror. At the same time, the pressure which was suppressing him suddenly disappeared.

Overjoyed, he charged forward instead of trying to escape while at the same time pushing his strength even more violently, determined to finish what he had started.
