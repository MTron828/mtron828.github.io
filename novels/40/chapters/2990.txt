As soon as the words left that person’s mouth, another said, “It’s all that girl’s fault for killing the Young Pavilion Master of Wind and Cloud Pavilion. Because of that, she provoked Wind and Cloud Pavilion’s ire. How can she possibly survive? She will die sooner or later.”

The first person replied, “That girl is pretty interesting too. Of all the people she could choose to kill, she had to kill the Young Pavilion Master of Wind and Cloud Pavilion. Although the Old Pavilion Master of Wind and Cloud Pavilion has many wives and concubines, he does not have any children to continue the family name. It was not easy for him to get a son; moreover, he spoiled his son rotten. How could he let bygones be bygones now that his precious son has been killed? If not for that, the reward would never be that generous.”

“Speaking of which, the Young Pavilion Master wasn’t anything good either. He abused his status and the love the Old Pavilion Master had for him to oppress both men and women. He was completely lawless. Even though his cultivation wasn’t high, he had a strong background supporting him. I don’t know how many women he ruined. I heard that the reason he was killed was that he had molested that little girl.”

The eyes of the burly man surnamed Xiong brightened at those words, “Does that mean that the girl is a beauty?”

The first person burst out laughing, “Of course! Think about it; the Young Pavilion Master has played with countless women already, so what kind of woman has he not seen before? He wouldn’t be interested in ordinary women! I’ll be honest with you, I caught a glimpse of that girl from a distance, and I can say with confidence she is extremely beautiful. It was as if an Immortal Fairy had descended to the Earth! If I could marry a woman like that, I would surely lose my motivation to cultivate. How could a sleazy Young Master like the Young Pavilion Master keep his hands off her the moment he saw her? It’s just that…”

“What?”

“It’s just that her strength was equally extraordinary. I’m not sure I could win against her, that’s why I just watched the opportunity slip away from me.”

“I love gorgeous women too,” the man surnamed Xiong grabbed the wine bottle from the table and took a swig. The wine dripped out of the corner of his mouth, making him look bold and unconstrained as an evil light flashed across his eyes, “I want to see just how beautiful this woman is. She is merely a First-Order Emperor Realm Master, so if I ever meet her, she won’t be able to escape from me!”

“With Senior Xiong taking action, the girl won’t be able to escape anymore,” one of them flatteringly said.

The man surnamed Xiong laughed, “Once I capture her, I will have a good time with her before handing her over to Wind and Cloud Pavilion to get the bounty.”

“Good! If you really capture her, Senior Xiong, please let me have some fun with her too.”

He snickered, “Brother, you sure have strange preferences. You want my leftovers?”

“It’s just for fun. It’s not like I’m marrying her, so what does it matter?”

“Sure, then let’s do that. It’s just that I don’t know if the information is accurate. Is that little girl really going to pass by this place?”

“The information has been confirmed. That girl is bold if nothing else. Despite offending Wind and Cloud Pavilion, she did not conceal her whereabouts and is instead killing her way towards Wind and Cloud Pavilion. It seems like many died at her hands already. Since she is making her way towards Wind and Cloud Pavilion, she will surely pass by Star Point City. We can just wait here for her to come. Didn’t the two of you notice that there are many Emperor Realm Masters in Star Point City? They are all here for that girl.”

“Hmph, they want to steal my prey? With their strength? How arrogant of them! They had better not get in my way or they can’t blame me for being merciless!”

“What you said is right, Senior Xiong! How can this pile of trash compare to you?”

While those people were talking among themselves, the man surnamed Xiong suddenly looked up and glanced in Yang Kai’s direction.

At that moment, Yang Kai was tasting the Mid-Rank Sword Wine that had been delivered to him by the shop hand; however, he immediately frowned after taking a sip as he discovered that the taste of this Sword Wine was a little different from the one he had drunk before.

[It’s not the same Rank at all!] Although the wine contained some Sword Intent, it was extremely weak. Yang Kai could easily refine the Sword Intent that rushed into his body and his meridians, so it was of no use to him at all.

[The Sword Wine Zhu Qing gave me before seems to be a rather high-end product.] Holding the wine glass in his hand, he frowned and suddenly felt rather empty inside.

All of a sudden, the opened bottle of wine on the table was sucked to the side by a powerful force as the man surnamed Xiong laughed loudly and said to Yang Kai, “Little brat, the Sword Wine isn’t something you can drink. I’ll reluctantly help you finish it. You don’t need to thank me.”

The Sword Wine at his table had been finished a long time ago; therefore, he indiscriminately snatched Yang Kai’s bottle away. While speaking, he picked up the wine bottle and gulped down the contents greedily, his Emperor Qi rippling slightly as if stimulated by the Sword Intent in the wine.

In response, Yang Kai’s expression immediately darkened. This burly man surnamed Xiong had scorned him several times, and at first, Yang Kai had been too lazy to bother with him, but now this man went so far as to snatch away his Sword Wine from right under his nose. Although Yang Kai did not care much for that bottle of Mid-Rank Sword Wine, nor plan to finish drinking it, letting it be snatched away by somebody else was a different matter altogether.

“What great wine!” The burly man surnamed Xiong finished drinking the bottle and the vitality of his body was stimulated by the Sword Intent, causing his face to become flushed. Wiping at his mouth, he yelled out cheerfully. Similarly, the other two people at the table were watching Yang Kai with scornful and jeering looks.

Yang Kai’s expression was frosty as he said, “As the saying goes, ‘all lay loads on the willing horse’. Initially, I had no plans to stoop down to your level, but you trash just had to provoke me. It looks like you are begging to die.”

When the burly man surnamed Xiong heard those words, he was taken aback for a moment before he burst out laughing, “What did you say, boy? I didn’t hear you clearly, why don’t you say that again, hmm?”

He deliberately leaned his ear towards Yang Kai while speaking, acting as if he really wanted to hear properly.

Yang Kai sighed softly, “Some people are simply frogs in a well; the sky above them is only as wide as they can see, but for some reason, they seem to think that they’re amazing.”

The expression of the burly man surnamed Xiong turned cold as he stood up abruptly and snarled, “Little brat, just who did you say is a frog in a well?!”

The other two people sitting at the same table as that man stood up as well and started to circulate their Emperor Qi. One of them snorted, “Don’t talk nonsense, little brat. This place is not your poor countryside home. It’s fine if you get embarrassed from saying the wrong things, but it’ll be bad if you lose your life because of that.”

“The ones that will lose their lives are you people!” Yang Kai lifted his hand slightly to teach these three people a profound and unforgettable lesson.

But at that moment, an abnormality occurred. A loud noise came from afar, followed by several blood-curdling screams that resounded through the sky. It sounded like a battle was taking place nearby. Emperor Qi filled the air as the World Energy and Principles were thrown into chaos. In the next instant, a pink figure suddenly shot by overhead.

Yang Kai was sitting by the window and caught a whiff of a faint fragrance as that figure passed him by. He then spotted a graceful figure with long hair flying in the wind and a fluttering pink robe out of the corner of his eyes, but she was gone in a blink of an eye. Immediately after that, several rays of light rushed by as they gave chase.

“Slut! How dare you run away?”

“How dare you show up here in Star Point City?! You won’t be able to escape this time!”

“Hurry up! Don’t let her get away again! The reward is 20 million High-Rank Source Crystals!”

The commotion lasted for a while as hundreds of people chased after the girl. There were some Emperors, but most were just Dao Source Realms, obviously tagging along to join in on the fun.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai was frozen in place from shock. His brain had blanked out at that moment as he stared blankly at the figure that had long since disappeared into the distance before he rubbed his eyes vigorously. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“It’s that little girl!” Exclamations rang out from behind him.

“Let’s go!” Another person hurriedly leapt out the window.

The moment that burly man surnamed Xiong heard those words, he lost all interest in Yang Kai and simply shot him a glare before he stomped his big foot and broke through the roof to pursue the girl.

The tavern instantly became a huge mess, with the shop hand running over to check on the situation. The scene that greeted him left him close to tears though, but he was unable to cry.

On the other hand, Yang Kai recovered from his shock and quickly threw some Source Crystals onto the table before he disappeared in a flash. When he reappeared again, he was already outside the city.

A group of people swarmed out from the city, seemingly unbothered by his sudden appearance, their eyes fixed on the beautiful figure fleeing in front of them, energetically chasing after her. To them, that girl was equivalent to 10 or 20 million High-Rank Source Crystals.

Yang Kai joined the chasing team without saying a word. It was not a particularly eye-catching action, but unlike the other pursuers, he only had one question in his heart, [Was I mistaken? Did I see wrongly?]

The speed the young woman flew past him was too fast; moreover, his attention had been fixed on the people sitting at the neighbouring table. Therefore, he failed to get a proper look at her appearance and only saw something out of the corner of his eyes.

That one glance shook his heart to the core though as he found the girl oddly familiar. In addition, she was a young woman he had not seen in many years. If he was not mistaken, then the situation was far too coincidental; therefore, he planned to mix into the crowd to observe the situation carefully before he made a decision since he wasn’t too sure about what he saw. It would be awkward if he recognized the wrong person. Besides, that girl was not in a good situation right now. In the worst case, he might be suspected of being her accomplice or something.

Outside Star Point City, the girl fled with unusual speed. She was like a pink streak of lightning shooting across the sky while the group of cultivators behind her chased after her perseveringly.

Within a short time, the differences between the strength of the cultivators manifested. The pursuers in the Dao Source Realm were all left behind and only those in the Emperor Realm managed to barely keep up with her speed.

Not many people were left soon, only about ten or so of them were left and most of them were First-Order Emperors. Nevertheless, that was a force that could not be underestimated, especially for this lone girl.

Despite the distance between them, Yang Kai could tell that the girl was only a First-Order Emperor Realm Master, and it was precisely because of her current cultivation that he wasn’t sure if he was mistaken. After all, he himself was just a First-Order Emperor. [If she is truly who I think she is, then it should have been impossible for her to reach this realm so quickly.]

A First-Order Emperor had little chance of winning when facing so many pursuers at the same realm; however, Yang Kai soon realized that something was amiss.

The girl fleeing in front of him didn’t seem the slightest bit flustered. Her aura was deep and serene, clearly indicating that she was not using her full strength. Rather, she seemed to be baiting her pursuers. As soon as the thought surfaced in Yang Kai’s mind, he failed to stifle his laughter and dismissed his suspicions as an excessive worry.

They soon left Star Point City far behind on their cat and mouse chase. Then, the girl who had been fleeing all this while suddenly stopped in her tracks amid the wild plains approximately five thousand kilometres away from Star Point City. She stood quietly in the plains, showing a beautiful back to her pursuers. A breeze blew past her and her long hair swayed lightly in the wind. It was a mesmerizing sight to behold.

Consequently, the dozen or so Emperor Realm Masters pursuing her came to a stop as well. At this point, they finally noticed that something was wrong. The girl did not seem to be escaping; rather, she seemed to be leading them into a trap. When that thought occurred to them, they hurriedly checked the surrounding area, lest there be a hidden Spirit Array or a powerful helper lying in wait.
