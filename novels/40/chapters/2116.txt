“The Firmament Tree which sealed the world and suppressed the void?” Yang Kai’s pupils contracted.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “It’s recorded in old books. The Firmament Tree is a tree that has taken root in the void and its Yin-Yang Chaos Power has pervaded every corner of the world and sealed its power.”

“Is it that amazing?” Yang Kai was stunned.

Qin Yu said with a smile, “Those are only old records and I’m not sure they are genuine. But, the tree described by you looks like the Firmament Tree and it’s probably related to it in some ways...”

“Then the question you have raised before...”

“The Firmament Tree is able to seal the world and its Yin-Yang Chaos Power possesses a great might. If the tree seen by you in that scene has also displayed sealing power, then the Firmament Tree is likely real.”

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai was shaken up. The Golder Silver Exotic Tree planted in the Small Sealed World had also displayed sealing power, and its Golden Silver Power had sealed even an Ancient Great Demon’s Sense and Demon Qi in his belly. It was already evident that it was related to the Firmament Tree in the legends.

“The Firmament Tree has Yin-Yang Chaos Power and it’s able to seal anything and everything...” Qin Yu added and said, “It’s no wonder it has appeared in the Ancient Great Demon’s remnant will, as he likely dreaded its sealing power and couldn’t forget it even after innumerable years.”

“I think so too,” Yang Kai approved of her opinion and kept up this misunderstanding.

“Senior, I have fulfilled your task. Is my explanation up to your satisfaction?” Qin Yu asked with a smile.

“Miss Qin, you’re well learned and I really admire you. I’m quite satisfied with this explanation.”

“Senior, I don’t deserve such high praise.” Qin Yu’s face got flushed and she quieted for a moment then said, “Hum, it looks like the Old Ancestor has something important to discuss with you. So, I’ll have to bid farewell to you for now.”

As her voice fell, she opened the chamber’s barrier and turned around to leave.

But, when she reached the door, she suddenly stopped and turned her head to say, “Senior, if my Old Ancestor’s request is too difficult, you can just refuse it right away. You don’t have to put too much consideration into it.”

After she spoke, she pushed the door and left without waiting for Yang Kai’s response.

Yang Kai stood there with furrowed brows, wondering what Qin Yu was insinuating. But, from what she had said, it looked like Qin Zhao Yang would ask for his help.

Yang Kai was already prepared for this as he had already made insinuations about it last time Qin Zhao Yang visited him. But, it looked like it wouldn’t be easy to help him and fulfil his request.

A short moment after Qin Yu had left, Qin Zhao Yang opened the door and entered.

“Old Mister Qin.” Yang Kai smiled at him.

“Little Brother Yang,” Qin Zhao Yang was seemingly troubled by something and he said absently, “Please sit down and let’s have a talk.”

After they took their seats, Qin Zhao Yang furrowed his brow and kept his silence for a long while, as if he was organizing his thoughts and words.

Upon seeing this, Yang Kai started the conversation and said, “Old Mister Qin, I have observed the state and aura of Miss Qin a while ago... Is anything wrong with her?”

Qin Zhao Yang sighed and said, “Yu’er had always been sickly and you must have noticed it long ago. In the past, I used my power daily to stabilize her condition, but this time...”

“What’s wrong with Miss Qin’s body?” Yang Kai asked.

He felt like Qin Zhao Yang’s request would be likely related to Qin Yu’s matter.

“Since you have already asked, then I’ll tell you bluntly.” Qin Zhao Yang gritted his teeth and continued, “Yu’er is innately gifted and she had an Innate Divine Ability, the Fated Fortune Heavenly Pupil.”

“The Fated Fortune Heavenly Pupil?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

“It’s a type of pupil ability, and as for its power... Yu’er’s cultivation base is still too low, while she’s also quite young, and I haven’t studied it thoroughly yet. But, from what Yu’er has shown until now, she can see people’s fortune and even peer into the future, and she can also observe the void...”

“It looks like it’s a useful Divine Ability,” Yang Kai was quite surprised.

He had already guessed long ago that Qin Yu possessed a special pupil ability, and the little girl had even used her Innate Divine Ability several times in front of him. But, he didn’t know the name of her pupil ability, nor its special power, and only finding out now from Qin Zhao Yang’s explanation.

“If it was just the Fated Fortune Heavenly Pupil alone, it would have been fine. This Innate Divine Ability didn’t bring any harm to her body and it only affected her a little whenever she used it. But, Yu’er doesn’t just have the Fated Fortune Heavenly Pupil, she also has the Heaven Earth Tribulation Body.”

“Heaven Earth Tribulation Body?” Yang Kai furrowed his brows.

Qin Zhao Yang nodded and said, “When she was five years old, a Master that passed by Maplewood City had seen her and noticed her peculiar constitution. After he examined her for a while, he told me that she has the Heaven Earth Tribulation Body. If I hadn’t met this Master, I would have never known this.”

“What’s so bad about the Heaven Earth Tribulation Body?”

Qin Zhao Yang sighed and said, “The Heaven Earth Tribulation Body is also a type of special constitution, and that Master said that as long as a person with Heaven Earth Tribulation Body is residing within the world, their vitality would be severed by the world and they won’t live past eighteen.”

“Eighteen?” Yang Kai’s face fell and he asked in surprise, “May I ask how old is Miss Yu’er?”

“She will be eighteen in... eight months,” Qin Zhao Yang said with a sad look apparent on his face.

“Then doesn’t this mean...” Yang Kai said in a low voice, “Miss Yu’er can only live for eight more months?”

“That’s right,” Qin Zhao Yang nodded solemnly.

Yang Kai was left dumbstruck. Generally speaking, whenever a person was born with a special constitution, he was blessed by the world, while Qin Yu didn’t just have a special constitution, she also had the Fated Fortune Heavenly Pupil at the same time, an extremely rare occurrence.

Unfortunately, the Heaven Earth Tribulation Body wasn’t a good constitution and it had severed her vitality.

Now, he finally understood why Qin Yu had always looked feeble. It was because she wouldn’t be in this world for long.

She had the Fated Fortune Heavenly Pupil and could peer into the future of people, and she probably could also see her future and the end of her road, but she still didn’t show any fluster or fear in front of others.

Upon thinking of this, respect for her welled up in his heart. An ordinary person couldn’t face death so calmly and fearlessly.

“Then our private discussion is about Miss Qin, isn’t it? How can I help you? Just go ahead and ask,” Yang Kai said firmly.

“Little Brother Yang, you don’t mind helping me?” Qin Zhao Yang was glad to hear Yang Kai bring up this subject by himself.

“I had only a short contact with Miss Qin, but she had dispelled my doubts and I don’t hope for her to die in her early years.”

“Little Brother Yang, thank you!” Qin Zhao Yang suddenly stood up and bowed to Yang Kai.

“Old Mister Qin, you don’t have to thank me,” Yang Kai said with a bitter smile.

Qin Zhao Yang said, “You should first know that it won’t be so easy to achieve this, and even though you won’t face any fatal threat, it would still be a difficult task. If you want to refuse it, then just do so, as it’s a sensible decision. I’ll respect your decision and won’t force you.”

Yang Kai said with a smile, “It looks like it would be quite dangerous. Old Mister Qin, let’s first hear what it’s.”

Qin Zhao Yang nodded and said, “In the past, that said Master didn’t just discover the special constitution of Yu’er, he also told me the way to solve its issue, and it’s seeking a precious treasure, the Tribulation Fruit. As long as she consumes it before her eighteen birthday, she’ll cross the tribulation, and she won’t just live safely for long, the might of her Heaven Earth Tribulation Body will also be unleashed and she will have bright prospects.”

“The Tribulation Fruit?” Yang Kai was startled.

“Little Brother Yang, have you heard about it?” Qin Zhao Yang looked in surprise at him.

“Yeah!”

If this happened a year ago, then he wouldn’t have any idea about this fruit. But, since he got the jade slip inheritance of Gong Sun Mu in Yuan Furnace Mountain, he got an understanding of all plants in the world.

The Tribulation Fruit had been recorded in the jade slip left by Gong Sun Mu.

It was the main material for the Spirit Pill, Tribulation Pill. This pill wasn’t anything good, but a sort of poison.

It was colourless, odourless, and could be easily melted in water. If one consumed it, then even the Yuan Qi of an Emperor Realm Master would be frozen and he would turn into a harmless sheep at the mercy of others.

But, which Emperor Realm Master still drank water? So, even though this pill had an outstanding might, it was practically useless, an impressive-looking, yet useless pill.

The Tribulation Pill was a Poison Pill, and its main material was obviously also very toxic, yet it was necessary to treat the Heaven Earth Tribulation Body. It looked like they were fighting poison with poison.

Yang Kai didn’t express his opinion about this, as he was also not sure if the Tribulation Fruit was useful for Qin Yu or not.

But, the Tribulation Fruit grew either in Extreme Cold Land or under millennials old ice. It was extremely rare!

“I had almost forgotten that you are also an alchemist...” Qin Zhao Yang had suddenly recalled this and revealed a faint smile.

In the past, after that Master asked him to seek the Tribulation Fruit, he had spent a lot of effort to get information about this fruit’s appearance and effects, yet Yang Kai already knew everything about it. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Since that Master has told you even this... Did he also tell you where you can find the fruit?”

Qin Zhao Yang said in a low voice, “It’s in the Four Seasons Realm!”

“What kind of place is that?”

A weird look appeared on Qin Zhao Yang’s face and he cast a glance at Yang Kai then said, “The Four Seasons Realm is the most famous Sealed World of the Southern Territory, and every time it opens up, countless elite disciples of various great sects will rush into it to seek precious treasures and opportunities.”

An embarrassed look appeared on Yang Kai’s face. It looked like he had shown once again how ignorant he was. He said, “Since it’s a public Sealed World of the Southern Territory, then can’t everyone enter it?”

Qin Zhao Yang said with a bitter smile, “If that was true, then everything would have been easy. Since ancient times, the Four Seasons Realm has been in the hands of the Southern Territory’s great sects and every sect has a specific quota for its disciples while our Maplewood City’s residents don’t have any chance to enter it.”

“Then how can I accomplish this task?” Yang Kai furrowed his brows.

“You have to use this,” Qin Zhao Yang said and took out a token from his pockets.

After he took out this token, Qin Zhao Yang’s old face got flushed.

Yang Kai took it in confusion and cast a glance at it, yet upon seeing it, his body shook and the corners of his mouth twitched. He said, “Old Brother Qin, where did you get this? You’re so old and impudent, does Yu’er know of this?”
