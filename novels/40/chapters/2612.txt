While Yang Kai was secretly communicating with Luan Feng, Wu Yuan Zheng had already soared into the air and pounced over with a fierce aura, like a falcon on attack, throwing out a palm as he shouted, “Kneel down!”

Hua Fei Chen was dead, Yin Le Sheng was dead, and now Elder Zhong was dead….

The Netherworld Sect could be said to have suffered heavy losses this time.

Wu Yuan Zheng wanted to use Yang Kai and his party to establish the Sect’s prestige. He wanted to let the world know what would be the outcome for people who killed the members of the Netherworld Sect.

As he smacked down a palm strike, a near-tangible might of the Third-Order Emperor Realm poured out like a fountain. Even the surrounding space was frozen in an instant as if it wasn’t a person descending from the sky, but a tall mountain.

The Netherworld Sect disciples excitedly gazed upon this scene in anticipation, waiting for Yang Kai and his group to kneel down and beg for mercy.

The several dozen members of Qi Family Fort looked at them with complicated eyes, especially Qi Hai. He couldn’t help but sigh to himself as he knew that Yang Kai was doomed this time, and once Yang Kai died, all his hopes of borrowing the Phoenix True Fire from him would die with him, no matter whether the Phoenix True Fire was with him or not.

[I’m afraid my wife’s Heavenly Frost Earth Rain Poison will remain untreated forever], for a moment, his heart was filled with remorse. He secretly hated himself for his low strength and for being useless.

In front of everyone’s eyes, Wu Yuan Zheng sneered widely while Yang Kai and the two women appeared as if they were scared and stupefied, simply standing on the spot, completely still.

Just when that palm strike was about to land though, Luan Feng suddenly lifted her arm and pointed a single finger upwards, her movements completely casual as if she was shooing away a fly.

But the might of this finger made Wu Yuan Zheng’s face immediately turn pale.

His tyrannical Third-Order Emperor Realm aura was instantly pierced through by this finger and all his momentum popped like a pricked balloon.

Not only that, a dreadful force shot towards him from the front, like an unstoppable sword, ripping apart the Principle Strength and the defensive Emperor Qi around him like it was smashing through dry weeds and rotten wood, thrusting straight towards his palm.

“Impossible!” Wu Yuan Zheng was completely shocked and his eyes filled with disbelief. At that moment, he desperately poured all of his energy into his palm, trying to resist the invading energy.

But the Third-Order Emperor Realm cultivation that he had always been proud of was like thin paper in front of this inexplicable force, serving no role at all.

*Pu…*

With a soft squashing, blood flew into the air as a gruesome hole as wide as a chopstick appeared on Wu Yuan Zheng’s palm. The fiercely swooping Wu Yuan Zheng felt as if he had been struck by lightning and tumbled awkwardly through the air before crashing to the ground, all the time staring at Luan Feng while violently trembling.

The Netherworld Sect disciples were all stupefied.

The Qi Family Fort disciples were also dumbstruck.

What did they just see?

Wu Yuan Zheng, a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, actually had his palm pierced by a woman, and it seemed that he was powerless to resist!?

Everyone was terrified as the world seemed to fall so silent that one could hear a pin falling on the ground. Only the sounds of their hearts pounding could be heard.

In this world, who could wound a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master like this?

“Who… who are you?” Wu Yuan Zheng’s face had gone completely pale, but it wasn’t because he was hurt. Although the finger’s energy had pierced through his palm, that was only a minor injury. If he went back and took a pill, his palm would be completely recovered after some days of resting. Compared to his injuries, the experience itself was what shocked him scared.

He was overawed by this woman herself! A woman who could hurt him like this must have an extraordinary identity.

A very shocking notion suddenly rose from the depths of his mind and Wu Yuan Zheng immediately broke into a cold sweat as he asked in a shaking voice, “Are you Lady Flower Shadow?”

Everyone broke into an uproar after hearing this.

Flower Shadow was the name of a person and a title too!

Flower Shadow Great Emperor, one of the Ten Great Emperors.

There was only one female among the Ten Great Emperors, but although she was a woman, she wasn’t any weaker than the other Great Emperors. She supported all the female cultivators of the Star Boundary and was the object of all of their respect and worship.

Unlike Serene Soul Great Emperor, Bright Moon Great Emperor, and a few other Great Emperors, who had founded their own Sects, Flower Shadow Great Emperor lived in seclusion in a place called Myriad Flower Valley, but as to where this Myriad Sword Valley was in the Star Boundary, no ordinary individual could tell for sure.

The Ten Great Emperors each had different temperaments. Some founded Sects to spread their leaves and branches into the mundane world, some roamed alone, free and easy, others lived on some obscure mountain or in some isolated forest in seclusion.

Only the names of each Great Emperor had spread throughout the Star Boundary.

Wu Yuan Zheng speculating Luan Feng was the Flower Shadow Great Emperor was without any basis other than the fact that she was far stronger than him. He was already a Third-Order Emperor, so only a Great Emperor-level figure could so dramatically surpass him.

And Luan Feng was a female, so it was easy to relate her to the Flower Shadow Great Emperor.

“Flower Shadow Great Emperor!”

Everyone exclaimed, one after another while the faces of the Netherworld Sect disciples immediately turned pale and their legs started shaking as if they had seen their dead parents. It was all over! Their Sir Vice Sect Master just had to antagonize a Great Emperor, even commanding her to kneel…

As for themselves, they had just now used obscene language to profane Lady Flower Shadow.

How were they supposed to keep their lives now?

The members of the Qi Family Fort also wore solemn looks on their faces. Although they hadn’t made any offensive comments just now, they were clearly together with the Netherworld Sect, so who knows if Lady Flower Shadow would decide to settle accounts with them.

On the other side, Wu Yuan Zheng was sweating buckets. With a face filled with fear, he apologized in a trembling voice, “Madam, this one had eyes but failed to see. I had no idea that Madam would personally grace us with her presence. I hope that Madam will forgive me…” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Having provoked a Great Emperor, Wu Yuan Zheng’s heart was like dying embers, but what he couldn’t figure out was why a Second-Order Emperor Realm and a Great Emperor were actually standing behind a trivial First-Order Realm Master, Yang Kai.

[Who is this guy? What’s even more hateful is that I was acting so arrogant, but he didn’t reveal anything at all, just keeping his mouth shut while enjoying the show. Such a vicious and sinister bastard!]

“You’re mistaken, this Queen isn’t Flower Shadow!” Luan Feng indifferently stated.

“You’re not Lady Flower Shadow…” Wu Yuan Zheng was dumbfounded, gawking at Luan Feng in a daze. Who knows what was going through his mind, but he couldn’t help but ask, “Then, you are… you are…”

Luan Feng didn’t have any intention to answer him, she just pointed her finger towards Wu Yuan Zheng. This finger strike was different from before. Before it was a simple finger, but now, a jet of pitch-black flame condensed at her fingertip instead.

“World Extinguishing Black Flame… You’re!” Wu Yuan Zheng’s face drastically changed. Obviously, he had realized Luan Feng’s true identity after seeing this, but that wasn’t surprising; after all, they were at the periphery of the Ancient Lands, and there was only one female Divine Spirit in the Ancient Lands.

Seeing her signature World Extinguishing Black Flame, how could he not guess her true identity?

Divine Spirit Luan Feng!

Wu Yuan Zheng was horrified. Had he provoked Flower Shadow Great Emperor, he might still have a chance to survive as the rumours were that the only female Great Emperor had a modest temperament. As long as one didn’t do something that was utterly devoid of conscience, she would not make things difficult for them.

Provoking the Divine Spirit Luan Feng was another matter. Although Luan Feng wasn’t someone who killed innocents, the word ‘merciful’ was not one that could be remotely associated with her.

“Madam, mercy!” Wu Yuan Zheng shouted as hard as he could while at the same time, he pushed his Emperor Qi madly in an attempt to block the oncoming World Extinguishing Black Flame.

But Luan Feng remained indifferent.

*Huala…*

The moment the wisp of fire came in contact with Wu Yuan Zheng, it ignited all of his Emperor Qi, reducing him into a ball of scorching black flames in an instant.

Wu Yuan Zheng started miserably screaming, causing the hearts of all who heard his cries to clench.

“Mercy! Senior, mercy…” Wu Yuan Zheng pushed his Emperor Qi hard, but he was unable to stifle the black fire on his body in the slightest. On the contrary, the harder he pushed his Emperor Qi, the fiercer the flames became, as if his Emperor Qi was nothing but fuel for the fire.

The miserable wails and cries for mercy soon died out, because Wu Yuan Zheng only lasted for less than three breaths under the World Extinguishing Black Flames before he was reduced to ashes. Even his Space Ring was completely melted.

Everyone went completely silent!

Earlier, when Elder Zhong attacked Yang Kai, he was instant-killed by the woman with the cold temperament.

Now, when Wu Yuan Zheng attacked Yang Kai, he was instant-killed by the other woman.

Had they not personally witnessed it with their own eyes, perhaps no one would dare to believe that something like this could ever happen in this world.

“Lady Feng, your flames are too strong,” Yang Kai, seeing Wu Yuan Zheng’s Space Ring melt, couldn’t help but be saddened.

In any case, Wu Yuan Zheng was the Netherworld Sect’s Vice Sect Master, so he must have had many rare and precious treasures on him, but now, all of that had been completely torched by Luan Feng, so how could Yang Kai not be upset?

Luan Feng stated with a smile, “This Queen was negligent. Sir Yang, please forgive this Queen this time for the sake of the many treasures Sir Yang obtained previously!”

Yang Kai’s brow twitched. Since Luan Feng had brought this up, what could he say?

“Madam, forgive us, Madam, mercy!”

The dozen or so Netherworld Sect disciples suddenly knelt down and started begging for mercy aloud.

Now, Elder Zhong was dead, and so was Wu Yuan Zhen, so they had no backers here. If they wanted to survive, they could only abandon their self-esteem and sense of shame.

In a flash, a dozen or so kept kneeling, kowtowing and begging for mercy in succession.

“Shut up! If you make another noise, I’ll kill all of you!” Ji Yao shouted in a sweet and tender voice that felt as cold as glacial ice.

All these cries were giving her a splitting headache.

As expected, the dozen or so people dared not utter another word. They just nervously gazed at Luan Feng, for the fear that she would make them follow their Vice Sect Master’s footsteps in anger.

*Putong…*

Another person knelt down.

Yang Kai glanced over and found that it was none other than Qi Hai.

An ashamed Qi Hai started pleading in a desperate voice, “Brother Yang, this Qi has committed a terrible mistake. I hope that my death will calm your anger, please let Qi Family Fort’s disciples go!”

“Young Fort Lord!” The Qi Family Fort disciples were shocked and appalled.

“Hmph!” Yang Kai just glanced at him before disregarding him altogether. Rather he looked in another direction and coldly stated, “I guess…we will have to take a trip to the Netherworld Sect.”

Luan Feng furrowed her delicate brow and asked, “Does Sir Yang want to settle accounts with the Netherworld Sect?”

Yang Kai agreed, nodding, “Whether I’m going to square things or not, it will depend on their attitude. I need their help with another matter too.” Having finished speaking, he turned to Luan Feng and stated, “Lady Feng, I will have to trouble you to follow me a while longer.”
