Yang Kai turned his head and said with a smile, “Why not come along, Lady Feng? The scenery of the Northern Territory is incredibly beautiful. It’s got lovely mountains and clear springs, and is the home of many outstanding people. Wouldn’t it be nice to go take a look around?”

“Absolutely not!” Luan Feng glared at him.

How outrageous of him to try and drag her along to be his free bodyguard again. She was supposed to be done after escorting him out of the Ancient Lands, and only continued to accompany him to the Netherworld Sect because she didn’t really have a choice. There was no way she would now follow him to the Northern Territory as well.

“Alright, alright, no need to get angry,” said Yang Kai, rubbing his nose.

Fu Bo was quite terrified as he observed them. He could not figure out just who Yang Kai really was or how he could be so close with Divine Spirit Luan Feng. There was only one thing he did know, which was that he must absolutely not get on this young man’s bad side.

After less than an hour had passed, a woman’s voice was heard outside the hall, “Sect Master, your subordinate requests an audience!”

“Come in!” Fu Bo hurriedly answered. After waiting there for an hour with Yang Kai and Luan Feng, Fu Bo had turned into a bundle of taut nerves, and looked extremely happy to see someone who could ‘save’ him from this situation.

Footsteps were heard as a woman in an elegant dress entered the hall.

This woman was quite refined in appearance, dressed in a noble and dignified manner. Her cultivation had reached the Second-Order Emperor Realm, and it looked like she held quite a high position within the Netherworld Sect.

As she entered, the woman cast a curious glance at Yang Kai’s group. She wondered what kind of people they must be, to be entertained in the Sect Master’s private retreat. As far as she knew, this place did not allow just anybody inside. Even the Elders usually couldn’t step in here unless they were summoned.

“Did you bring what I asked for?” Fu Bo asked the beautiful woman.

“Yes,” she quickly answered.

As she spoke, she passed the Space Ring she was holding to Fu Bo.

Fu Bo took it from her, then winced slightly as he checked it with his Divine Sense. He quickly calmed down and waved his hand at the woman, “You may go.”

“Sect Master!” The woman did not immediately leave, looking at Fu Bo with curiosity, “Why do you need a hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals all of a sudden, and so urgently?”

This beautiful woman was the Netherworld Sect’s general manager, in charge of the Sect storehouse and all resources used for cultivation. Though she did retrieve these hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals from the storehouse as ordered, it was such a large sum that she had to ask what they were to be used for. Without these hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals, the cultivation resources of all their disciples would be greatly reduced for the next few years.

And when the disciples complained about it, all their criticism would be directed at her.

“Cultivation!” Fu Bo answered calmly, without even batting an eye.

The woman stopped for a moment, then suddenly asked with great delight, “Sect Master, could you be…”

Fu Bo waved his hand, “Don’t ask so much.”

“Yes!” The woman hurriedly answered, cupping her fists, but even so, there was a look of joy on her face that could not be concealed.

She thought that the Sect Master wanted all these Source Crystals because he could possibly achieve a breakthrough. Fu Bo was already a Third-Order Emperor Realm cultivator, if he had another breakthrough, then he would reach the Great Emperor Realm, and if he really became a Great Emperor, then the Netherworld Sect would greatly rise in status as well.

Compared to the Sect Master’s cultivation taking a step further, a hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals was a triviality. The woman was instantly relieved.

“I will take my leave, Sir!” The woman bowed respectfully, and was about to leave.

“Oh, and go prepare the Space Array,” Fu Bo instructed, “I will be escorting these guests away shortly.”

The woman left happily with her orders.

After she left, a look of awkwardness came over Fu Bo’s face, and he tossed the Space Ring to Yang Kai.

As the current Sect Master of the Netherworld Sect, it was really quite embarrassing to have to lie to his subordinate in front of Yang Kai and the others, but what else could he do but lie? He could not possibly tell his subordinate that he was actually being extorted.

That would really be too embarrassing to say out loud.

Yang Kai took the Space Ring and checked it with his Divine Sense, then put it away without doing a precise count.

He was sure that Fu Bo would not short-change him. If he promised a hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals, then he would deliver a hundred million.

Yang Kai was in quite a good mood after suddenly attaining such a fortune. If he totalled up this stash with what he had gained last time in the Ancient Wild Lands, then he had somewhere between seven to eight hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals on hand.

It was a terrifying sum.

“Sect Master Fu is sincere indeed!” Yang Kai said, laughing, “Since you are so sincere, then my conflict with the Netherworld Sect is now resolved. From now on, let us each go our separate ways and not bother the other. What do you think of this, Sect Master Fu?”

“Good, I could not have asked for more!” Fu Bo would not possibly dare to say no.

Yang Kai went on, “I do still need to borrow your noble Sect’s power for the second matter.”

“En, please follow me!” Fu Bo did not hesitate further, and hurriedly led the way. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The four of them exited the hall and quickly flew towards a certain direction.

After they arrived at a small mountain, Fu Bo led Yang Kai and the others to stop at an area of flat ground on the mountaintop. A grand palace stood here, and Yang Kai could sense swirling Space Principles even without going inside.

Naturally, these were the Space Principles associated with the Space Array.

It seemed like the beautiful woman from earlier had already made preparations.

After entering the palace, the Netherworld Sect disciples guarding the Space Array immediately bowed respectfully to them. The woman who had brought the Space Ring earlier also hurried forth to greet them, cupping her fists as she spoke, “Sect Master, everything is now prepared. May I know what your destination is?”

“Black Armour City!” Said Fu Bo.

The woman nodded and gestured to the disciples standing by the Space Array, who immediately began making adjustments.

In no time at all, the preparations were complete and the Space Array was ready.

Fu Bo smiled and gestured ahead “Please go ahead!”

Yang Kai led Ji Yao forward to stand in the centre of the Space Array, then looked towards Luan Feng with a smile, “Lady Feng, are you sure you don’t want to come take a look with me?”

“Have a smooth journey, Sir Yang!” Luan Feng answered, her face expressionless.

Yang Kai chuckled, “In that case, many thanks to Lady Feng for escorting us. If I have the free time someday, I will certainly visit again to give my thanks.”

Luan Feng’s mouth twitched, but she still managed to force a slight smile without saying a word. It was folly to say too much at such a time, and thus, silence was her response.

Yang Kai turned his head to the Netherworld Sect disciples, “Begin!”

They glanced at Fu Bo and waited for him to nod his head, then fully activated the Space Array’s power.

With a flash of bright light, the High-Rank Source Crystals placed on the Space Array were instantly drained of their power and reduced to a pile of dust.

When the light faded, Yang Kai and Ji Yao had also vanished.

*Hu…*

Luan Feng heaved a light sigh, thinking to herself that this troublesome fellow was finally gone. Her mood was lifted by this, and she smiled.

Without bothering to bid Fu Bo farewell she turned around and walked straight out of the palace, then flew away.

Fu Bo led the Netherworld Sect disciples outside the palace gates to see her off, respectfully cupping his fists in salute.

“Sect Master…” The beautiful woman looked quite bewildered to see her Sect Master treat this unknown woman with such awe and respect. He even personally came outside to see her off even though she ignored him completely.

“That lady from earlier… Who is she?” The woman could not help but ask.

Before Fu Bo could answer, they heard the distant sound of a clear and melodious cry that seemed to pierce through the clouds.

They could also vaguely see the form of some gigantic being as it flew amongst the clouds, before quickly vanishing.

[As I thought…]

Fu Bo couldn’t help but squint as the fear of what had just taken place fully dawned on him. Though he had more or less guessed Luan Feng’s identity already, he was never able to fully confirm it. Now, after hearing that cry, and seeing the gigantic being flying amongst the clouds with his own two eyes, there was absolutely no doubt that his guess had been correct.

That person really was a Divine Venerable from the Ancient Wild Lands!

Most cultivators did not know much about the situation inside the Ancient Lands, but those who had reached Fu Bo’s level were always able to learn of some little-known secrets via various means. One of these secrets was the distribution of forces within the Ancient Wild Lands!

The Ancient Wild Lands was like a massive trove of treasures, and if it wasn’t for the Four Great Divine Venerables and thirty-two Monster Kings who maintained order in the Ancient Lands, that place would’ve been completely taken over by all the great forces of Star Boundary already.

“Don’t ask too much, just do your job!” Fu Bo replied calmly.

“Yes!” The beautiful woman replied respectfully, then suddenly asked, “Sect Master, I heard from a disciple earlier that Great Elder went to your place earlier. Why didn’t I see him at all?”

Fu Bo’s brow spasmed before he heaved a heavy sigh, “Zhou Yong… is dead.”

“What?” The woman was aghast, “Great Elder Zhou is dead? Who killed him?”

“He offended someone he shouldn’t have,” Fu Bo explained quietly, glancing at the woman, “Elder Zhuo, your curiosity is too strong.”

As he finished speaking, he turned into a flash of light and disappeared, going back to his place of retreat.

The woman by the surname of Zhuo remained standing in place, completely stunned and still trying to process the news that the Great Elder was dead. Her face was full of shock, and who knew what she would think if she knew that even the Vice Sect Master had also died?

……

Black Armour City stood near the border of the Eastern Territory, only about fifty thousand kilometres away from the Northern Territory.

Inside the city, Yang Kai and Ji Yao appeared on the Space Array.

Even before they could steady themselves, a palm strike and a rush of wind came towards them, along with someone’s shout of laughter, “This one is mine!”

“Huh?” Yang Kai was bewildered and turned to see a big bearded man flying towards them, a heavy palm strike aimed right at his chest.

He had no idea what kind of grudge or enmity he had with the man, but Yang Kai was certain that he had never seen this person before.

“Sha Yong, if that man is yours, then the woman is mine! Whew… this is a pretty one, I’m in luck!” Another voice was heard as a second person appeared, going straight for Ji Yao. His face bore an expression of lustful evil, as though he wanted to snatch Ji Yao away right then and there to ‘dote’ on her.

The bearded man named Sha Yong hadn’t paid much attention to Ji Yao before, but now he hurriedly checked her out as well. He saw that she was indeed a great beauty, especially with that cold and distant aura that only made him want to conquer her even more.

Sha Yong turned and dashed towards Ji Yao as well, hollering as he went, “Change, change! You got a woman last time Gu Peng, this time it’s my turn!”
