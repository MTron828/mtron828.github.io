When Yang Kai’s voice had just echoed out, someone rushed inside swiftly, then waved his hand to close the door.

Upon seeing the person that had arrived, Yang Kai cupped his fists and broke into laughter. “Old Sir Qin!”

The person who had arrived was none other than the Qin family’s Old Ancestor, Qin Zhao Yang.

“Brother Yang!” Qin Zhao Yang returned his greeting with a slightly embarrassed look plastered on his face.

Yang Kai said, “Old Sir Qin, weren’t you recuperating at home? Why did you drop by?”

Qin Zhao Yang’s complexion was anything but good, and it was obviously because he still hadn’t recovered from the injuries he sustained last time, yet strangely enough, he didn’t visit Yang Kai along with Duan Yuan Shan, but rather sneaked here alone.

As Yang Kai mulled it over, he understood what he was up to.

“My injury is nothing serious!” Qin Zhao Yang waved his arms and looked for a seat, then sat down and said, “Brother Yang, after I heard that you came back safely, I rushed over here and didn’t expect that the City Lord would forestall me.”

“So, that’s why you hid outside?” Yang Kai chuckled.

“I have something to tell you and can’t do so in front of the City Lord,” Qin Zhao Yang said awkwardly.

“Sigh!” Yang Kai let out a sigh and looked at him earnestly then said, “I can more or less guess what you want, and I can only politely decline.”

Qin Zhao Yang said curiously, “I still didn’t say anything yet, how come you know what I want?”

Yang Kai let out a bitter laugh and said, “Mister Qin, aren’t you here to ask me to join your Qin family?”

“Is it so obvious?” Qin Zhao Yang was taken aback.

Yang Kai nodded. “Old Sir Qin, you have already made insinuations several times and only a fool won’t guess your intentions... Besides, I heard that the Qin family took over the Jiang family’s large industry, and if you don’t have enough power to rule over it, you won’t be able to deter the restless people eyeing it.”

“Brother Yang, you know me well.”

Upon hearing him, Qin Zhao Yang’s eyes lit up as he nodded, then said, “It’s as you said and that’s why I came to pay you a visit. I want to invite you to undertake our Qin family’s Supreme Elder position, whose status isn’t any lesser than mine. If we join hands, the other old geezers won’t dare to run amuck.”

Yang Kai sighed and said, “I have already refused the Vice City Lord’s position offered by City Lord Duan.”

Upon hearing this, Qin Zhao Yang’s expression turned gloomy and he said in disappointment, “Is that so...”

They were both astute people and Yang Kai didn’t have to provide a detailed explanation. Qin Zhao Yang had already understood that Yang Kai wouldn’t accept his offer.

Yang Kai had just refused Duan Yuan Shan’s invitation, so if he accepted Qin Zhao Yang’s invitation, Duan Yuan Shan would surely take offence and might assume that Yang Kai looked down upon him, and he might even harbour a grudge against him.

At that time, even the Qin family couldn’t stay out of this dispute.

He would get a Supreme Elder, but would end up offending the City Lord. This wasn’t a worthwhile deal and Qin Zhao Yang knew this clearly.

Yang Kai looked at Qin Zhao Yang and said ashamedly, “Actually, you have taught me the Black Tortoise Seven Sections Array’s arrangement method, and if you need any help, I won’t refuse you. But, in regards to this matter, I won’t be of any help to your Qin family, rather, I would only harm you. So, I’ll have to disappoint you.”

“I understand,” Qin Zhao Yang nodded and spoke.

“But...” Yang Kai changed the subject and said, “If the Qin family needs help, then I don’t mind making a move as your friend. When the time comes, you can go ahead and ask for my assistance.”

Upon hearing this, Qin Zhao Yang raised his brows and chuckled. “Since I already got your word, I can set my mind at ease.”

He looked pretty delighted, as even though he didn’t achieve his trip’s objective, he still got a promise from Yang Kai and didn’t come here in vain.

Qin Zhao Yang said meaningfully, “Perhaps, I’ll shortly need your help.”

Yang Kai nodded and said, “I’ll await news from you.”

At that time, Qin Zhao Yang taught Yang Kai the complete arrangement method of the Black Tortoise Seven Sections Array through a jade slip, and he asked only for a promise in exchange, a promise to ensure Qin Yu’s safety, and take her away with him in case of the city’s fall.

But, what had happened later was beyond everyone’s expectation. The Demon Crisis had been more daunting than dangerous and the former’s promise had turned useless.

However, Yang Kai had already gotten benefits from him, yet, he refused Qin Zhao Yang’s invitation. Feeling ashamed of himself, he wanted to look for an opportunity to repay this favour.

The two people chatted for a while before Qin Zhao Yang stood and took his leave.

He was still injured and needed to recuperate. Besides, the Qin family had just taken over the Jiang family’s large industry and was awfully busy. He really couldn’t spare the time to spend here and couldn’t afford to waste his precious time.

After Qin Zhao Yang left, Yang Kai finally got some time for himself and he started adjusting his breathing.

He had just gone through demonization and his body was quite feeble. The great power, which greatly surpassed his current cultivation base, didn’t come at no cost.

For the next few days, Yang Kai stayed in the guest room.

...

On a certain day, Yang Kai’s eyes snapped open. His eyes shone brightly and were full of vigour. He didn’t look tired and feeble any longer, and it could be said that he had already recovered to his peak.

Yang Kai first observed his body’s state and he felt quite relieved to discover that there weren’t any hidden injuries left in it.

He didn’t rush to leave at the first moment. He just took out the Sealed World Bead and, as his body flickered, he entered it.

The Small Sealed World was as serene as usual, but after Yang Kai observed it with his senses for a while, he couldn’t help but cry in surprise. He detected an unusually strong power at a certain corner of the Small Sealed World.

His body moved and he directly descended upon that location.

Liu Yan was sitting cross-legged in front of him with her hands crossed in front of her. She was circulating her Secret Technique!

She was engulfed by berserk lightning fire. Fire was running amok and serpentine lightning was dancing within a perimeter of dozens of miles around her.

There was still a giant phantom image behind Liu Yan, a phantom image of a bird with unfolded wings, as if it would soar into the sky at any moment.

“A Luan Feng!” Yang Kai looked in surprise at the phantom image.

It was the phantom image of the Ancient Divine Spirit, Luan Feng, which he had once seen at close distance, but it was still a mere projection and wasn’t alive.

Despite this, it still emitted a Divine Spirit’s aura and indomitable black flames with a great imposing manner were burning on the phantom image.

Liu Yan’s expression was quite tense, as if her Secret Technique had reached a critical juncture.

After Yang Kai observed her for a while, he realized that she was refining Luan Feng’s feather and her progress was good, but it still was an arduous task for her.

Even though he was the Small Sealed World’s master, he couldn’t provide her with any help and she could only depend upon her will and resolution.

If she could refine it successfully, her strength would rise further, but if she failed, she would suffer a grave backlash.

Fortunately, Liu Yan had been absorbing the Sun Essence and tempering her body for years, and she was already used to intense energy, or else, it wouldn’t have been possible for her to refine Luan Feng’s Divine Feather with her First-Order Dao Source Realm’s cultivation base. However, her success and failure still depended upon her luck.

The Embodiment was sitting solemnly in a distant region and observing Liu Yan’s situation closely.

Upon seeing the main body looking at him, the Embodiment nodded in response and his implication was clearly evident.

The Embodiment was keeping watch over Liu Yan, if she suffered any mishap, he would get notified immediately. So, he could set his mind at ease and leave.

His body moved again and he arrived in another region of the Small Sealed World.

It was vacant land, and a shivering silhouette was holding onto her knees and sitting down. It was as if she was trying to hide in a corner, far from people. Such a sight would make people wonder what kind of traumatizing experience and torment she had just gone through. The woman’s hair was a mess, her face pale and her pretty eyes were looking around warily, while fright and alarm were apparent on her face.

Yang Kai had appeared before her, yet she was oblivious to it, as if she couldn’t see him.

“This...” Yang Kai looked at her and mumbled, “This should be enough, right?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Upon speaking, he snapped his fingers.

The snap’s noise wasn’t loud, yet when it fell upon Hua Qing Si’s ears, it wasn’t any different than a deafening bell noise. Her body suddenly shook and she raised her head. She suddenly discovered that the boundless darkness engulfing her had been scattered and replaced by dazzling light.

A person, which she had cursed ceaselessly and wished to hack into pieces, had appeared next to her and was observing her lazily.

Upon seeing that person’s face, the fright and suffering Hua Qing Si had gone through in the past few days turned into a raging desire for revenge and she shouted, “I’ll kill you!”

As she spoke, she shot toward Yang Kai swiftly. Her body turned into a hundred butterflies that covered the land and they quickly enveloped Yang Kai tightly.

Yang Kai raised his hand and hacked it toward an empty region, while completely ignoring the hundred butterflies.

As a collision sound echoed out, his palm hit something...

“Ouch...” Hua Qing Si’s body fell off the void and the hundred butterflies disappeared completely. She was holding onto her head and moving back ceaselessly. She was in so much pain that tears almost flowed out of her pretty eyes.

“It looks like...” Yang Kai observed her calmly and said, “You still don’t understand your current situation, I should give you more time to reflect on it before having another discussion.”

After he spoke, he was about to resort to the same old measure, but Hua Qing Si suddenly cried sharply, “No! Don’t! I’ve made a mistake, and I don’t dare to resort to mischief again, please... Forgive me!”

In the boundless darkness, she had been killed by some strange beings many times every day and she could clearly feel death looming over every time. None would be able to stand this torment for long!

When she had been killed for the first time, she assumed that she was dead for real. But, she quickly came back to life a short while later.

However, life had been worse for her than death, as every once in a while, she would be killed by some strange beings.

After a lot of deaths, she finally understood that she was stranded in a pretty advanced illusion; an illusory cycle of life and death.

Every day, she would die at least several hundred times, and she had almost gotten numb and used to it.

If she wasn’t endowed with decent strength, this torment would have been enough to drive her crazy.

When she had sighted upon the main culprit, Yang Kai, flames of anger raged in her heart and she got daring, but she had been subdued by him with one move.

She was thoroughly in despair!

“Pretty good, I’m gratified that you have become so sensible,” Yang Kai cast a glance at her and nodded, still standing calmly.
