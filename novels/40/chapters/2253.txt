“Scoundrels! All of you!” Qin Yu stomped her feet in anger. Since the Qin Family was incomparable to Eight Paths Sect in strength, it was impossible to cast them out with force. If the Eight Paths Sect insisted on staying, the Qin Family really could do nothing about it.

It was just that Qin Yu never expected that when everything had reached this point, they could still be so shameless to stay. The level of their shamelessness was unparalleled.

“Hahaha!” Lin Yun cackled, “Yes, this Young Master is a scoundrel, so what? Does Young Lady Qin want to teach me a lesson? I’ll give you a chance now, come with me!”

Just as he finished speaking, he rushed over in front of Qin Yu with a flicker and right before everyone’s eyes, he stretched out his hand to grab her shoulder.

The middle-aged man saw this happen and wanted to react, but hesitated, then closed his eyes and pretended he did not see anything.

He was mad that the Qin Family couldn’t appreciate kindness and since they preferred to settle things through force, he simply turned a blind eye to Lin Yu’s actions. Making this small family bear the consequences of standing up against them would allow them to understand who was really in charge here.

“Scram!” Qin Zhao Yang, who was beside Qin Yu, immediately burst out at Lin Yu. Seeing Lin Yu charging towards her, Qing Zhao Yang could not just sit back and watch, pushing his Source Qi madly he sent out a palm that could crush mountains. Clearly, he was not holding back in the slightest.

Lin Yun sneered, “Old man, it seems you don’t understand the immensity of Heaven and Earth. You really think that you can stop this Young Master with just this?”

He did not intend to evade and instead turned his claw into a palm and sent it out to meet Qin Zhao Yang’s.

A sinister force pulsed out as Lin Yun seemed to have transformed into an extremely poisonous snake, flicking its forked tongue as it sniffed its prey.

Qin Zhao Yang’s face changed as he understood that if this palm strike was to hit him, he would certainly not have a good end; after all, he was now old and weak. Although he was a Dao Source Realm cultivator, his remaining strength could not be compared to his prime while on the opposite side, Lin Yun, who was still young, energetic, and possessed a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation, was simply not someone that he could contend with.

But this was a matter of Qin Yu’s safety, so even though he knew he would suffer, Qin Zhao Yang did not fall back, instead pushing his Source Qi even more madly as he met Lin Yu’s aggression head-on.

“Overconfidence!” Lin Yun clicked his tongue and teased with his head shaking slowly.

*Peng...*

The palms touched and their intense Source Qi collided, releasing a powerful shockwave that kicked up a violent wind as well as sand and rock from the courtyard.

Then...

A shocking scene happened.

The moment when the two skills clashed, surprisingly, Lin Yun’s body trembled before his face changed drastically. After he let out a scream, he was thrown out while coughing up a mouthful of blood mid-air before slamming heavily into a building behind him, opening a big pit hole in its walls.

*Hong long long...”

There was a continuous sound of crashing in the room, as if Lin Yun could not control his momentum and was smashed through more and more walls.

“What?” The middle-aged man and the rest of the Eight Paths Sect disciples were dumbstruck as they watched this unbelievable scene with their eyes bulging.

Meanwhile, the guards of the Qin Family, who were initially consumed with fear despite their hatred for the enemy, were equally shocked; but soon, all of them beamed with delight and cheered triumphantly.

“Old Ancestor, you...” Qin Yu looked over in confusion. Although she could not detect Lin Yun’s true cultivation, she sensed he was much stronger than the Old Ancestor.

How did the Old Ancestor knock him back in just one move then?

That was impossible!

Qin Zhao Yang was dumbfounded too. He actually had mentally prepared himself to be critically injured as he laid his life on the line in order to keep Qin Yu safe.

In any case, he would not just sit back and watch Qin Yu being captured and humiliated by Lin Yun.

However, the end result surprised him greatly.

But after a short moment, he seemingly realized something and turned around.

There, he saw a man with a smiling face standing behind him, supporting his back with his hand while infusing him with a stream of pure and vigorous Source Qi.

It was this man who assisted him in knocking back Lin Yun!

Qin Zhao Yang’s eyes lit up as he joyfully shouted, “Yang Kai!”

He found that the one who quietly helped him from behind was the person that he had been waiting for to return to Maplewood City, Yang Kai.

“Ah?” Qin Yu was startled when he heard Qin Zhao Yang’s shout and turned her gaze to look in his direction. When she saw Yang Kai, she could not help covering her mouth and let out a trembling voice, “Sir Yang!”

“Who?!” The middle-aged man from Eight Paths Sect regained his wits and bellowed, furiously glaring at Yang Kai as he shouted, “Who are you? How dare you injure our Eight Paths Sect’s disciple with such a treacherous trick!”

“Eight Paths Sect?” Yang Kai raised his brow after hearing this and instantly swept across the middle-aged man and the disciples of the Eight Paths Sect with his eyes. However, he did not find the person that he was looking for and could not help feeling disappointed, “Are all of you disciples of Eight Paths Sects?”

“Indeed!” Seeing Yang Kai seemingly aware of their reputation, the middle-aged man became emboldened, “Who are you?”

The middle-aged man couldn’t hide his bewilderment while speaking. For some reason, he found Yang Kai’s face to be a little familiar, as if he had seen him somewhere before, but he could not remember where.

Still, he did not back down and rebuked, “You have injured our Eight Paths Sect’s disciple. I don’t care who you are, if you cannot give us an acceptable explanation, don’t even think about leaving alive!”

He spoke with full confidence because when he scanned Yang Kai with his Divine Sense, he found that this boy only had a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation. With this kind of strength, he didn’t need to put Yang Kai in his eyes.

It was just that he did not know what kind of Secret Technique Yang Kai had used to toy with Lin Yun together with Qin Zhao Yang. However, after some thought, the middle-aged man assumed that whatever Secret Technique Yang Kai used simply combined the force of two individuals, catching Lin Yun off guard.

“Heh...” Yang Kai looked at the middle-aged man in astonishment, “I really didn’t know that Eight Paths Sect’s disciples were so impressive! Someone who wasn’t aware would believe you came from Star Soul Palace.”

The middle-aged man’s face mixed with anger after being stung by Yang Kai’s mockery, gritting his teeth and shouting, “Enough of your nonsense. Surrender yourself if you want this to end peacefully, refuse and you cannot blame us for being impolite.”

Yang Kai looked at him with an odd expression and replied, “Do I know you? Why would I expect a stranger like you to treat me well? You’re quite funny!”

He next turned to Qin Yu after that and whispered, “Does this man have a problem with his head?”

Qin Yu could not hold her laughter after seeing his hilarious face.

However, Qin Zhao Yang frowned. He knew that Yang Kai was no ordinary person, otherwise, he would not have given him the entry quota to the Four Seasons Realm, but he was not sure if Yang Kai could handle the situation here given that there were so many Masters on the opposite side, making him feel a bit anxious.

“Little brat, it seems like you can’t wait to die!” The middle-aged man exclaimed in anger.

“Stop shouting already,” Yang Kai gave him a disdainful look. “You’re embarrassing both of us.”

Yang Kai ignored the middle-aged man after that and turned to Qin Zhao Yang, “What’s going on here? I only vaguely heard something about a million Source Crystals after I arrived... Explain it to me please.”

He was telling the truth. After receiving the Tribulation Fruit from Azure Sun Temple, Yang Kai rushed to Maplewood City without rest, but as soon as he entered the city, he sensed that there was something wrong as there were too many powerful Masters present compared to when he left.

Upon reaching the Qin Residence, Yang Kai happened to see the scene where Qin Yu was trying to drive away some strangers, but since he was unaware of the circumstances, he decided to observe the situation first. Only after he saw Lin Yu lash out did Yang Kai reveal himself in order to help Qin Zhao Yang.

After being asked by Yang Kai, Qin Zhao Yang glared at the middle-aged man resentfully and succinctly explained what had happened just now.

Yang Kai kept silent as he listened and only after he understood did he lift his head and address the middle-aged man, “So basically, the story is like this: The Qin Family treated all of you well, but one of you killed their servant, and not only did you not feel sorry or even admit your mistake, you instead used your Sect’s strength to try to seize their residence and even tried to abduct the Qin Family’s Young Lady...”

The middle-aged man could not help falling quiet as he was powerless to refute Yang Kai’s assertions.

“Tsk tsk... such tyrannical actions are simply... outrageous!” Yang Kai said in contempt.

The middle-aged man took a deep breath and said, “This one had already offered a million Source Crystals to settle this matter, but they did not appreciate my kindness!”

“Good!” Yang Kai raised his brow, “According to friend then, a million Source Crystals is enough to buy a life and anyone who refuses such an offer would be rejecting kindness, right?”

During his speech, he immediately waved his hand.

In an instant, a hill of Source Crystals piled up in the courtyard. There were countless Source Crystals in this pile, numbering at least ten million.

The disciples of Eight Paths Sect, despite not having poor backgrounds, were still dazzled by this hill of Source Crystals. All of them were staring at it and gulped as they wished they could run up and snatch them.

Qin Zhao Yang and the rest were even more dumbfounded, as they did not understand what Yang Kai was up to.

“Come, come, come,” Yang Kai enthusiastically beckoned to the disciples of Eight Paths Sect with a bright smile on his face, “Be my guest, everyone take a million Source Crystals, not one more or less...”

All of a sudden, the atmosphere of the conversation changed as the smile on Yang Kai’s face turned into a gloomy sneer as he continued, “Once you take them, I’ll kill all of you!”

*Deng deng deng...*

All of the Eight Paths Sect disciples took a few steps back, looking at Yang Kai in shock, and one of them even shouted, “Are you making a joke?”

Although a million Source Crystals was no small sum, one still needed to be alive to enjoy them. What was the point of taking Source Crystals when they didn’t have their life?

The face of the middle-aged man grew even more sombre as, at this point, he fully understood Yang Kai’s intentions.

Yang Kai clearly wanted to treat him the way he had been treating the Qin Family. After he understood this, he could not help sneering, “I see that you are not from the Qin Family, so why wade into this muddy water? We can still be friends if you step away now.”

“Who wants to be friends with you?” Yang Kai sneered, “Just accept my offer, or don’t you understand how to appreciate kindness?”

The middle-aged man raged at this taunt, “It looks like we have nothing left to say!”
