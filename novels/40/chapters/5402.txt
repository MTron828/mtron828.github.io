Cang didn‚Äôt know that the powers of those two could be combined. The Human Race of the Late Ancient Era did not have a very good opinion of the Divine Spirits and rarely wanted to come into contact with them, let alone the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer who were the supposed progenitors of the Divine Spirits. Furthermore, the Chaotic Dead Territory was a Forbidden Zone for the Human Race.

Although Cang and other nine Martial Ancestors were from that era, they had never set foot in the Chaotic Dead Territory and did not know much about Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan.

Even if they did come into contact, they might not be able to consider the two being able to help.

After all, it was only thousands of years after Cang and other nine Martial Ancestors got locked up here to guard Mo that they considered how they could completely defeat Mo. That was when they first thought of the Primordial Light.

Now, it seems that Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan most likely had something to do with the Primordial Light.

It might really be the case that those two could really merge, but who could bring them here?

Considering that the Primordial Light might also be eliminated when Mo was destroyed, who could force those two to sacrifice themselves if they were unwilling to?

The Old Ancestors were faced with a conundrum. Although they had learned from Cang that there was a possible solution, it was still too difficult to implement.

‚ÄúSenior, in that case, is our Human Race‚Äôs crusade here pointless?‚Äù An Old Ancestor asked gravely.

Without a way to completely eliminate Mo, the war between the Human Race and the Black Ink Clan would never end. Did the 2 million soldiers of this mighty army brave through all those dangers for nothing?

Cang shook his head and solemnly said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not useless. To tell you the truth, you came just at the right time.‚Äù

‚ÄúSenior, please elaborate‚Ä¶‚Äù

Cang sighed and said, ‚ÄúBack then, when we laid the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction here, it was because it was Mo‚Äôs birthplace. As the years passed, Mo‚Äôs servants turned this huge void into a Spiritless Land. So, we simply had no way to replenish our own strength. Even my old friends passed away one by one, until this Old Master was the only one left.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you came even 1,000 years later, this Old Master would have followed in the footsteps of my friends. Even if this Old Master doesn‚Äôt die though, Mo would still be able to get out of this trap on its own one day.‚Äù

During the countless years of being trapped in the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, Mo was not just waiting for death, it was secretly building up its strength and testing the restriction from the inside.

In its first real attempt, it almost succeeded, but in the end, it was once again resealed by the 10 Martial Ancestors. That incident had led to more than 100 Royal Lords escaping with their Black Ink Nests.

Those 100 or so Royal Lords who escaped were the root of the major Theatres.

Today, even if Cang did not know how powerful Mo had become, after suffering a few losses, it undoubtedly became smarter and more patient. Although Cang had tried several times to dig up information from it, Mo would never reveal how powerful the force it was amassing had become.

That was why Cang said that they came at just the right time. If they arrived some years later, he might have been unable to hold on. By then, Mo would escape and bring disastrous for the Universe.

Cang pondered a little and said, ‚ÄúMo itself is not too strong. If we really fought, it might not be this Old Master‚Äôs match; however, it cannot be completely destroyed. I can defeat it once, or maybe twice, but I will be the one who dies in the end! Its real strength is not in itself, but in the servants it creates.‚Äù

Being an immortal entity, even if it was inferior in raw strength, it could still kill its opponents who were much stronger than it by simply persisting through the ages. This was why Cang and the other nine did not directly attack Mo.

They knew they could not destroy Mo, so they did not waste their strength.

The Ninth-Order Masters suddenly realized something and Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao asked, ‚ÄúDoes Senior mean that over the years, Mo may have created many Black Ink Clansmen inside the restriction?‚Äù

Cang quickly answered, ‚ÄúIndeed. Probably more than you can imagine, including many, many Royal Lords.‚Äù

The Ninth Orders all looked very grave.

This was terrible news. Th.√™ most uptodatùìÆ nùíêvels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Not only was the source of the Black Ink Clan close to breaking free of its seal, but there were also many Royal Lords trapped inside along with it that would break loose when the time came.

Thinking about the scale of the restriction, just how many Royal Lords could be hidden in this huge area?

That number was unimaginable.

Setting aside all other things, if there was even just 200 Royal Lords inside, that would be a huge problem for the Human Race. However, right now, they could not even tell how many were inside?

There must be at least 46 as there were originally 50 that ambushed the Old Ancestors in the Black Ink Space. Though some had died, there were bound to be many more than 50. Mo had been imprisoned here for millions of years, after all, and it had nothing else to do but to create servants.

‚ÄúMo cannot possibly create Black Ink Clansmen out of thin air, it must need to consume energy to do so. Since it is imprisoned here, where does the energy come from?‚Äù An Old Ancestor asked.

The main reason for this question was because the people knew that Black Ink Clansmen were born from Black Ink Nests, but when a Black Ink Nest spawned Black Ink Clansmen, it had to consume a lot of resources.

Although Mo was the source of the Black Ink Clan, it still had to draw its energy from somewhere.

Cang smiled bitterly and replied, ‚ÄúThis could also be considered our blunder. This place is the Primordial Heavens‚Äô Source, the origin of both the Universe, the Primordial Light, and Primordial Darkness. When we tricked Mo into coming here, we wanted to harness the vast energy here to suppress and seal it. We thought that the unlimited energy of the Primordial Heavens Source could strengthen the restriction; after all, it is the origin of all things, even Mo. But, it seems the Heavens are truly fair in all things. Mo can also extract the power of the Primordial Heavens Source for its own use while it is here.‚Äù

The Old Ancestors gasped audibly as they listened.

Mo could draw the power of the source of the 3,000 Worlds with the help of this special place. In other words, since the 3,000 Worlds were infinite and indestructible, Mo‚Äôs strength was inexhaustible!

Cang and the other nine could initially refine and absorb Starlight Strength or other forms of energy from the void to maintain the restriction; however, when the Royal Lords escaped and turned a huge swath of the void into a Spiritless Land, they could not do so anymore.

Instead, Cang and the other nine Martial Ancestors had to draw from their own strength, weakening themselves day by day as they had no means to replenish their power.

Before the nine Martial Ancestors died, each of them directed all their remaining might, sacrificing their core essence to the restriction to enhance its strength; otherwise, Mo would have escaped out of this restriction long ago.

After all his old friends had departed one after another, Cang would be next if the Crusade Force had not arrived.

That was why he said that the Human Race Army came at the right time.

Even such an ancient supreme being would have felt desperate after waiting for millions of years. Who knew how excited Cang was when he perceived the aura of that battle a few years ago.

When he realized that someone was fighting in the Black Ink Nest Space, he decisively took action.

‚ÄúSince you have come here, you must have the intention to get rid of Mo, and it just so happens that this Old Master needs your help.‚Äù

The Old Ancestor all looked solemn as the Great Battle Heaven Old Ancestor said, ‚ÄúWe do not know Mo as well as Senior does. When we led the crusade to this place, we thought that we could ruthlessly kill whatever was here. We did not expect things to turn out this way. Perhaps Senior can instruct us on what to do now.‚Äù

The other Old Ancestors all nodded in unison.

Cang was the first to cup his fist and said, ‚ÄúThis Old Master thanks all of you in advance. To be honest, if a fight breaks out, you will lose a lot of the 2 million you‚Äôve brought here.‚Äù

The Old Ancestors laughed as one of them replied, ‚ÄúSenior, the founding purpose of the Cave Heavens and Paradises was to fight against the Black Ink Clan on the Black Ink Battlefield. Over the years, many of our ancestors have died to fulfil that purpose. If they did not have the Will to fight and die, they would not have dared to set foot onto the Black Ink Battlefield to kill the enemy. Senior, not to mention if we had large numbers of casualties, even if this entire Army perished here, it would be worth it if we could destroy the Black Ink Clan. As for thanking us, we should be the ones to thank you, Senior! Without Senior‚Äôs great devotion to guarding this place, the 3,000 Worlds would have been lost and we would not be here today.‚Äù

Cang looked at the crowd, and saw that the many Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters did not flinch, even though they were aware of the power and evilness of Mo. He began to smile with relief.

[This generation of warriors is indeed competent; otherwise, it would not have taken the Human Race more than a million years before they came.]

Just as Cang was about to speak, a voice echoed, ‚ÄúYou all want to listen to this old man‚Äôs nonsense and become my enemies?‚Äù

The voice was so indistinct that none of the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters knew where it came from, but all of them soon turned pale.

‚ÄúMo!‚Äù

Mo was the only one who would say such words at this moment.

No one expected that Mo, which was suppressed and sealed in the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction where the Heavens and Earth were created, could still communicate with them. What made things worse was from the tone of its voice, it had heard everything that was said here.

Yang Kai looked very odd. Moments ago, Cang said that Mo‚Äôs personality was like a child; furthermore, it seemed that its voice was also that of a child.

It was practically the same as Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan.

When he thought about it, Mo, Big Brother Huang, and Big Sister Lan seemed to actually have a lot in common. Perhaps the solution to resolving the crisis of the Black Ink Clan really depended on those two.

‚ÄúThis Supreme One cannot be killed. What the old man said about the Primordial Light is pure nonsense. This place is the birthplace of this Supreme One, what Primordial Light could be found here?‚Äù Mo sarcastically said.

‚ÄúYou are only seeking your own doom if you listen to this old man‚Äôs nonsense.‚Äù

Cang slowly shook his head and retorted ‚ÄúMo, just because you do not know about something does not mean that it does not exist. Or perhaps‚Ä¶ are you afraid?‚Äù

‚ÄúAfraid?‚Äù Mo raised its voice and replied, ‚ÄúWhy would this Supreme One be afraid of you? I hate you! I hate that I trusted you so much! I hate how I was tricked into coming here, only to be imprisoned for countless years! Old man, once I get out of here, you will be the first one to die!‚Äù

Cang chuckled and said, ‚ÄúRest assured, there won‚Äôt be such a day.‚Äù

Mo ignored him and said to the Old Ancestors, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs surprising that you‚Äôve made it this far. However, your efforts are pointless. How about this? Why not make a deal with this Supreme One?‚Äù
