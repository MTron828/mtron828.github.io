“What’s going on? This is…”

“Oh, no! The Blood Gate’s restrictive power has been reactivated!”

“Sirs, we’d best leave now! There might be unforeseen dangers!”

All the Monster Kings started exclaiming. In the past, they could never have gotten so close to the Blood Gate, always staying more than ten kilometres away from it. Only recently had the Blood Gate’s mysterious suppressive field disappeared, allowing them to approach it.

However, the mysterious power seemed to have returned, causing all the Monster Kings to feel suppressed in an instant, and as time passed, the suppressive power was growing increasingly stronger.

Obviously the Divine Venerables had noticed this as well. Their cultivations were much more powerful than the peak Twelfth-Order Monster Kings present, but in just a short period of time, they felt their strength suppressed to just that of a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master.

In other words, at this moment, any Third-Order Emperor Realm Human Master would be just as powerful as they were.

Over the years, they had come near the Blood Gate several times to study it, so they knew how horrible this suppressive power could be, so they were well aware that this was just the beginning. When the suppressive force reached peak intensity, it could suppress their strength to a point where it was lower than the Emperor Realm.

“All of you, leave first!” Fan Wu waved his hand and ordered.

Although the Monster Kings were fairly powerful, they were still no match for the Four Great Divine Venerables. If they stayed there any longer, their lives would be at risk. Upon receiving the order, the Monster Kings and the Great Kings hurriedly fled this place as though they had been pardoned for their sins. Before they left, they also made sure to bring the subdued Stone Spirit Clan members with them.

In just a short moment, only the Four Great Divine Venerables, Yang Kai, Zhang Ruo Xi, and the Third Disciple were left. The cultivations of the Four Great Divine Venerables were exceptional, so although they had been suppressed by the Blood Gate’s power, they weren’t in danger at the moment. On the other hand, Yang Kai, Zhang Ruo Xi, and the Third Disciple were not from the Ancient Lands, nor were they members of the Monster Race, which was why they were unaffected by the restrictive power.

At this moment, everyone’s attention was on Zhang Ruo Xi. The young girl still remained on her knees with her head hung low, though her violent aura had subsided. However, a force that was awakening in her petite figure caused the Four Great Divine Venerables to be frightened.

“Bloodline Power!” Yang Kai’s gaze brightened as he had figured out what was going on. Zhang Ruo Xi’s Bloodline Power had always been a mystery, one Yang Kai had wanted to help her unravel eventually, but had not been able to find any clues about.

Previously, when he came across the Bustling World Great Emperor, Duan Hong Chen, the latter seemed to have figured out something, but the old man insisted on acting mysterious and didn’t share any information with Yang Kai. This caused the latter to be on tenterhooks. Although Yang Kai was frustrated at the time, there was nothing he could do about it.

However, Yang Kai had never expected that Zhang Ruo Xi’s Bloodline Power would awaken one day because of him when she experienced extreme anger and despair, causing her to crave for absolute power.

“What are you muttering about?” Shi Huo lowered his head and glared at Yang Kai. He could faintly hear Yang Kai speaking, but he didn’t hear it clearly because all his focus was on Zhang Ruo Xi.

“None of your damn business,” Yang Kai shot him a disdainful glance and sneered.

“Little Brat, you must be sick of living!” Shi Huo bellowed.

“Don’t make things even more complicated now!” Fan Wu suddenly yelled with a furious expression. The extraordinary transformation Zhang Ruo Xi was going through caused him to feel uneasy as he knew that it was caused by what happened to Yang Kai. If Yang Kai were to die now, they couldn’t predict what kind of transformation this young girl would undergo.

Whatever secrets were held in her body, Fan Wu couldn’t take it lightly since the Blood Gate was involved.

Shi Huo shook his head with displeasure, but he didn’t dare to find fault with Yang Kai again.

Yang Kai also didn’t want to keep provoking Shi Huo. To him, if Shi Huo still wouldn’t let him off, he would just have to fight him. The reason he continued to bear with it just now was that he wanted Zhang Ruo Xi and the Stone Spirit Clan to evacuate first.

Turning his head, Yang Kai focused on the current situation and called out gently, “Ruo Xi… Ruo Xi…”

Despite Yang Kai calling out to her more than a dozen times, she remained unmoving, which caused him to frown.

“I have a bad feeling about this,” Cang Guo gulped as he appeared extremely wary. With his strength, he wouldn’t show any fear even if a Great Emperor had personally arrived. Even if he couldn’t defeat a Great Emperor, he was confident he could still flee; however, gazing at the seemingly delicate young girl who was on her knees in front of him now, he found himself to be instinctually terrified.

Luan Feng and Fan Wu traded glances as they could see the shock and anxiety in their eyes. In an impatient manner, Shi Huo uttered, “I have to kill her. I don’t like this feeling…”

As he spoke, he stepped towards Zhang Ruo Xi. However, after he took only two steps forward, Zhang Ruo Xi, who had remained silent this entire time, suddenly said in a low voice, “I understand now.”

“Hm?” The Four Great Divine Venerables stared at her in confusion.

Zhang Ruo Xi slowly raised her head with an icy cold expression on her pretty face, her bloodshot eyes sending a chill down the Four Great Divine Venerables’ spines.

“Ruo Xi…” Yang Kai was dumbstruck. He had spent many years with Zhang Ruo Xi, but he had never seen her looking like this before. Was she still the Zhang Ruo Xi he knew, even in this state?

The young girl let out a gentle breath as she got to her feet in an elegant manner and flicked the dust on her clothes away. Then, she turned around to stare at Shi Huo coldly and parted her red lips to confirm, “You lump of stone, did you just say you want to kill me?”

Shi Huo stiffened upon meeting her dispassionate gaze as his entire body was gripped by a sense of coldness. However, ten kilometres away, those Monster Kings were still looking in their direction, so he grit his teeth and snapped back, “So what if I did?”

Zhang Ruo Xi nodded and stopped talking before shifting her attention to Yang Kai. As their gazes met, Yang Kai frowned because he was worried about her; however, before he could ask any questions, Zhang Ruo Xi looked away, as though she didn’t even recognize him.

Yang Kai’s heart sank when he saw this as he didn’t understand what transformation she had gone through. At that instant, he found her to be unfamiliar, but at the same time, he felt utterly sorry for her.

Zhang Ruo Xi raised her hand suddenly, summoning something into her palm. It was a translucent and beautiful jade sphere that was radiating some faint traces of Space Principles.

“The Space Spirit Jade!” Yang Kai frowned as he didn’t understand why Zhang Ruo Xi would suddenly take out the Space Spirit Jade at this point. It was a Zhang Family heirloom that Yang Kai had kept for a long time. He only passed it back to Zhang Ruo Xi just before entering the Ancient Lands because he felt she was powerful enough to explore the mysteries hidden within the Space Spirit Jade now. By doing so, perhaps she could unravel the secret behind her bloodline.

However, she hadn’t been able to discover anything, so he didn’t expect that she would take it out at this moment. While Yang Kai was gazing at her curiously, Zhang Ruo Xi suddenly flicked her wrist, upon which, the Space Spirit Jade transformed into a beam of light and shot towards the Blood Gate. In an instant, the beam of light integrated with the Blood Gate and added a layer of white to its red surface.

The next moment, images that depicted a paradise kept flashing in the air above the Space Spirit Jade. The flashing of these images was accompanied by a deafening creaking.

It was like a door that had been shut for a very long time was slowly being opened, and a wave of horrifying aura began wafting out from behind it.

“The Blood Gate’s key! It’s the Blood Gate’s key!” After Fan Wu observed the sight for some time with a frown, his expression changed drastically as he exclaimed in shock and stared at Zhang Ruo Xi with widened eyes as he yelled, “Why do you have the Blood Gate’s key?”

Luan Feng couldn’t help but cover her mouth as she looked dazedly at the Blood Gate and muttered, “The Blood Gate is opening…”

*Hong Long Long…*

Finally, the sound of the door opening was heard. Behind the Blood Gate, a translucent and beautiful sight could faintly be seen. It was as though a palace had been erected there, but the sight was so surreal that it left all bewildered.

“The Blood Gate’s key?” Yang Kai was amazed as a myriad of expressions came over him. He had studied the Space Spirit Jade for quite some time, but he had never expected that it was actually a key that could unlock the Blood Gate.

Taking this new information into consideration though, the beautiful images that kept flashing in the air above the Space Spirit Jade they saw just now were likely the landscape beyond the Blood Gate, and that palace was the legendary Divine Spirit Palace.

“Why do you think I have the Blood Gate’s key?” Zhang Ruo Xi uttered in a dispassionate and flat tone. However, Fan Wu couldn’t help but take a few steps back and turn pale, as though he had just heard the devil’s voice.

Zhang Ruo Xi raised her hand towards the Blood Gate, as though she was summoning something from it.

*Xiu…*

A beam of light shot out of the Blood Gate, one which Zhang Ruo Xi grabbed as it arrived at her hand.

*Zheng…*

The sound of a sword humming was heard. It was then that everyone came to the realization that it was a beautifully crafted sword that had shot out of the Blood Gate. The blade was polished and reflective, with a hilt that was carved with Dragons and Phoenixes. At the end of the hilt was a red tassel that waved about as if it was alive.

With the sword in her hand, Zhang Ruo Xi’s aura suddenly surged, her aura now as imposing as a peak Third-Order Emperor.

*Huala…*

All of a sudden, a lifelike illusory phantom emerged behind Zhang Ruo Xi.

Yang Kai widened his eyes as he stared dazedly at this illusory phantom. Although he had seen this image many times before, he was still astounded every time he laid eyes upon it. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

It was an illusory phantom of a gigantic woman whose long hair cascaded down her. With her head raised slightly, she appeared impassive. This woman looked somewhat similar to Zhang Ruo Xi. With a huge sheathed sword in her hands, she was standing quietly behind Zhang Ruo Xi, as though she was her elongated shadow.

“Heaven’s Order Sword!” Unable to hold it in anymore, Fan Wu exclaimed as the colour drained from his face.

“You’re a descendent of Heaven’s Order?” Luan Feng’s alluring face turned ashen as she felt a bitter taste in her mouth.

On the other hand, Cang Guo was trembling uncontrollably and almost couldn’t support his own weight. Shi Huo’s mind turned blank as he almost collapsed to the ground.

As Divine Spirits, they had inherited their ancestors’ Source Strength as well as their memories, so they knew better than anyone how terrifying Heaven’s Order was.

In the era when Heaven’s Order existed, it was the most trying time for all Divine Spirits. Ninety percent of them were killed by her, and countless Divine Spirit Sources had been sealed inside the Divine Spirit Palace that was behind the Blood Gate, never to see the light of day again. This was why all Divine Spirits feared Heaven’s Order, always worried about their own safety.
