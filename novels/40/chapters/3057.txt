Some Sixth-Order and Seventh-Order Dragon Clan members secretly compared themselves with Yang Kai and reckoned that even without bloodline suppression, they might not be able to defeat him. Hence, they stopped being arrogant and disdainful of him as their expressions turned solemn.

Upon transforming into his Half-Dragon Form, Yang Kai immediately pushed his Dragon Pressure and engulfed Fu Zhun with it.

Fu Zhun was unperturbed, however, as the palm she had thrown out became even more translucent. In the blink of an eye, the two forces clashed with each other.

Right in front of everyone’s eyes, Fu Zhun’s palm easily broke through all of Yang Kai’s defences and landed on his chest. Silently, Yang Kai’s broad chest sank, as though it had been hit by a meteor boulder. At the same time, his back protruded as the shock wave exploded out behind him, astounding everyone.

*Kacha…*

It was then that the sound of countless bones cracking could be heard, which sent chills down the spectators’ spines.

The 80-metre-long Half-Dragon froze for a moment before it was sent flying backwards, like a bolt of lightning, flying more than a hundred kilometres in the blink of an eye, golden blood splashing out to form a long golden trail.

[We told you not to be so presumptuous!] That was the thought on the Dragon Clan members’ minds as they watched Yang Kai flying away from the impact.

After Zhu Yan and Zhu Kong traded glances, they shook their heads.

Although Yang Kai possessed the Golden Divine Dragon Source, and he was fairly powerful in his own right, he was now going against the Second Elder, who was a Master that was as formidable as a Great Emperor and a Tenth-Order Dragon. After Yang Kai had activated his Dragon Pressure, he failed in his attempt to suppress the Second Elder’s bloodline at all and without the advantage of bloodline suppression, he couldn’t possibly bear even one palm from her.

Even though her attack was clearly not made with her full strength, it allowed Yang Kai to realize the difference between a Great Emperor and himself deeply. On the contrary, he wasn’t able to hurt even one strand of Fu Zhun’s hair.

The place fell into silence as they were surrounded by the bitingly cold aura. With a dispassionate expression, Fu Zhun stared coldly at Yang Kai, who barely managed to stop and stabilize himself.

All of a sudden though, her pupils contracted as she slowly turned her head and narrowed her eyes. In a calm manner, she asked, “Zhu Qing, do you know what you’re doing?”

Hearing that, all of them came to their senses and looked in that direction, upon which they were all stunned.

When they were not paying attention, Zhu Qing had approached Fu Chi and engulfed him with her Dragon Pressure. At the same time, she had transformed her fair hand into a Dragon Claw and clenched at Fu Chi’s head as she stared warily at Fu Zhun.

She didn’t react upon seeing that Yang Kai was injured. It wasn’t that she didn’t care about his life or death; it was just that she couldn’t be distracted. The slightest lack of concentration in front of someone as strong as a Great Emperor would be enough to make Yang Kai’s plan fail, so Zhu Qing wouldn’t even dare to think about turning her head to examine his current state. At that moment, her pointed Dragon Claws had pierced Fu Chi’s flesh, and if she exerted any more force with her hand, Fu Chi would lose his life on the spot.

Apparently, Fu Chi had never expected that such a thing would happen. Just now, he was still laughing at Yang Kai for daring to challenge the Second Elder. Seeing that Yang Kai was on the losing side, he felt gleeful and hoped that the Second Elder’s attack could end his life.

While he was still thinking about that though, he saw a figure flashing across his eyes, upon which Zhu Qing appeared right behind him. Following that, he could feel the suppression from a Ninth-Order Dragon Vein as well as the pain on his head.

At that moment, Fu Chi’s expression was livid as he was extremely displeased.

A Ninth-Order’s suppression on an Eighth-Order wasn’t too overwhelming. If they were to fight face-to-face, Fu Chi could persevere for some time; however, Zhu Qing was fully prepared and managed to gain a decisive advantage from the start, so Zhu Chi’s life or death was now literally in her hands.

A myriad of expressions came over everyone in that place, as the sight before them was extremely strange. This was Fu Chi and Zhu Qing’s wedding day, and they were both clad in ceremonial red robes. They were supposed to be a loving couple, but at this moment, the bride seemed to have the intention of killing the groom, so the sight appeared very awkward.

Without answering the question, Zhu Qing placed all her focus on Fu Zhun.

“Your seal has been removed?” Zhu Kong frowned as he couldn’t believe it, “When did that happen?”

For quite some time now, Zhu Qing’s Dragon Vein had been suppressed and her cultivation had been sealed. However, now it didn’t look like any of that had happened to her. Apparently, she had restored all her strength, which was why she was able to make such a sneak attack.

“So that’s how it is,” Zhu Yan quickly figured out how Zhu Qing’s seal was removed. Shocked, he looked at Yang Kai, who was flying back unstably as he pressed his giant claw against his chest.

Incensed, Fu Zhun stared at Yang Kai and snarled, “It’s you who did it!”

There was no way Zhu Qing’s seal had been lifted for no reason. Since the beginning, only Yang Kai had got into contact with Zhu Qing. Hence, besides Yang Kai, no one else could remove Zhu Qing’s seal without anyone knowing.

[How did he do it? I laid that seal personally!]

“You’re allowed to place a seal on her, but you won’t allow me to lift it? That doesn’t make sense,” Yang Kai appeared ferocious as there was still some Golden Blood on the corner of his mouth. He hadn’t managed to restore his chest to its original form either, so it was still slightly sunken. Fu Zhun’s attack was unbearably powerful. Although it didn’t cost him his life, it had roiled his vitality and broken several bones. His 80-metre-long figure approached Zhu Qing and landed on the ground in front of her. Like a hill, he stood in front of Zhu Qing and faced the three Elders’ pressure on his own.

Seeing that he was still alive and kicking, Zhu Qing, who had been extremely anxious just now, could finally heave a sigh of relief and set her mind at ease.

“You’ve done well, Qing’er.” Yang Kai praised her without turning his head. After all, they were husband and wife, so their hearts were already one. Although he didn’t have the time to tell Zhu Qing his plan, she was still able to make the optimal choice at the critical moment.

“He was just creating a diversion…” Zhu Kong raised his brow. At that instant, he had also figured out what just happened.

Yang Kai activated his Dragon Transformation Secret Art and transformed into an 80-metre-long Half-Dragon seemingly to confront the Second Elder. Although it looked like he was reckless and didn’t know his place, he was in fact just trying to draw everyone’s attention to himself.

While all of them had focused on Yang Kai, Zhu Qing, who had been concealed behind his towering figure, could move freely to assist him, and it turned out that the couple’s tactics were indeed useful.

Initially, Yang Kai was like a fish on the chopping block, while the Dragon Clan held the knife. Hence, he couldn’t resist their oppression. However, things looked a little different now.

Zhu Qing’s seal had been lifted, and her power had been restored. Now, Fu Chi was in her hands and she could instantly kill him if she pleased.

Despite the fact that Yang Kai had been injured by the Second Elder, he managed to gain the upper hand in the end.

[What deep schemes! What boldness!] Zhu Yan and Zhu Kong were stunned as they thought that if this matter couldn’t be solved perfectly, they would soon have a formidable enemy.

“Zhu Qing, are you trying to betray us? Release Fu Chi now! What you’re doing now is highly improper!” Fu Zhun’s expression was cold, and her voice was equally stern.

Unperturbed, Zhu Qing replied, “I only listen to Yang Kai. I’ll only release Fu Chi if he tells me to do so.”

Fu Zhun growled, “Don’t forget that you’re a member of the Dragon Clan as well as part of Dragon Island! You know what kind of punishment you’ll get for harming your fellow clansman!”

Seeing that the Second Elder was truly incensed, most of the Dragon Clan members became terrified.

They hadn’t seen the Second Elder so infuriated in a long time. The last time she became this furious was ten odd years ago, when she ended up confining her favourite daughter to the Dragon Grave. At that time, that person was the Dragon Clan’s Third Elder!

Now that Zhu Qing was also a Ninth-Order Dragon, supposedly, she could become the Dragon Clan’s Fifth Elder, but that didn’t matter anymore. Even the Third Elder was sent into the Dragon Grave by the Second Elder, so there was no way Zhu Qing could escape her punishment.

“Harming her fellow clansman?” Yang Kai snorted and extended his gigantic hand to grab Fu Chi. Instantly, all his Dragon Pressure engulfed Fu Chi, which caused him to let out a muffled grunt. At that moment, Fu Chi was seized by a sense of fear.

He was just an Eighth-Order Dragon and even Zhu Qing, who had a Ninth-Order Dragon Vein, could suppress him, let alone Yang Kai who possessed the Golden Divine Dragon Source. Perhaps a month ago, Fu Chi could put up some resistance against Yang Kai even if the latter activated his Dragon Transformation Secret Art; however, in just one month, Yang Kai’s integration of the Golden Divine Dragon Source had improved dramatically.

Fu Chi felt that the Dragon Essence in his body had stagnated completely at this moment.

However, that wasn’t what truly upset him. He was most frustrated at the fact that, as an Eighth-Order Thunder Dragon, he was now held in Yang Kai’s hand like a toy, with literally hundreds of eyes staring at him, utterly shaming him.

“Old hag, you sealed Qing’er’s cultivation and suppressed her Dragon Vein. You knew that she loved someone else, but you still forced her to marry a Dragon Clan member she didn’t love. Doesn’t that count as harming your fellow clansman? In my opinion, you’re the one who should be punished!”

All the Dragon Clan members’ foreheads were now beaded with sweat, while the brows of the Great Elder and the Fourth Elder twitched.

[This guy is too bold! How does he have the guts to talk to the Second Elder like this!?]

Fu Zhun’s face twitched as she said through gritted teeth, “What did you just call me?”

“Old hag, old hag, old hag, old hag, old hag!” Yang Kai cursed at her repeatedly with such force that spit and blood flew in all directions from his mouth, almost dirtying Fu Zhun’s face.

Fu Zhun’s expression turned glacial as her tender body trembled violently and the murderous intent she released nearly became tangible.

“Don’t even think about killing me,” Yang Kai looked down at her with a sneer, “Yes, if you want to kill me, I probably won’t be able to escape. However, I’m a timid man and am easily frightened. If I were to suddenly lose control of my strength and accidentally pinch him to death, that would be terrible!”

To prove that he wasn’t bluffing, Yang Kai exerted slightly more force with his claw.

Instantly, Fu Chi shrieked as he felt that all his bones were being crushed. While he gritted his teeth, his sweat streamed down his forehead. His gaze was filled with hatred as he glared at Yang Kai. He had never been humiliated so greatly in his life, and his resentment towards Yang Kai would never be resolved no matter what. However, since he had fallen into Yang Kai’s hands, he couldn’t even muster the strength to struggle.

“I heard that there are only a small number of Dragons in the Dragon Clan, so each one of you is precious. I wonder how valuable an Eighth-Order Thunder Dragon is in your heart, Second Elder?”

Fu Zhun gnashed her teeth together and uttered slowly, “Today, either you will die, or the Dragon Clan will perish!”

The colour drained from Zhu Qing’s beautiful face when she heard that declaration.
