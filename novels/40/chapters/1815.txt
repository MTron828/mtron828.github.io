This was the moment to capitalize on the advantage and kill him!

Yang Kai and Gui Zu were both seasoned veterans, so how could they pass up such a great opportunity? They both used their strongest means to strike towards Zi Long, whose aura had dropped sharply.

Countless Moon Blades flew out as many Yin Souls pounced towards Zi Long’s location.

A violent energy collision occurred setting off dozens of blinding explosions.

Yang Kai and Gui Zu stared ahead without blinking, their expressions gradually becoming serious.

Soon, the shockwaves dissipated, and Zi Long’s figure was revealed again.

At this moment, the Purple Star Sect Master’s expression was somewhat pale, as if his foundation had been damaged. He looked quite dishevelled, but there was clearly no worry about his life because at some unknown point a purple-red Artifact Armour had appeared on his body!

This Artifact Armour gave off an extremely potent energy fluctuation, and at first glance, it was obvious it was no ordinary treasure.

An Artifact Armour that could withstand the joint attacks of Yang Kai and Gui Zu had to at least be Origin King Grade Mid-Rank!

This level of defensive artifact was a rarity even when considering the entire Star Field, and could be considered priceless. For example, the Resounding Emperor Bell Kong Fa used was Origin King Grade Low-Rank, yet compared with the armour Zi Long wore, the difference was not small.

Although it had preserved his life, there were now many cracks in the purple Artifact Armour, causing Zi Long’s eyes to teem with distress.

This purple Battle Armour was a treasure passed down from generation to generation of Purple Star Sect Masters. After ten thousand years, it had witnessed the history and evolution of Purple Star.

But today, it had been seriously damaged.

This Artifact Armour was a relic leftover from ancient times, and with the methods and skills of modern Artifact Refiners, as well as the available materials, it was impossible to restore. How could Zi Long not feel forlorn?

However, Zi Long had also sobered up after taking this attack. Just now, his rage at his son being killed had caused blood to rush to his head and all he could think about was killing Yang Kai to seek revenge. But he had clearly underestimated his foe and suffered a great loss as a result.

He now understood that he could not kill Yang Kai with his power alone.

Forget about Yang Kai being proficient in the Dao of Space, making it possible for him to escape at any time he wanted, just Gui Zu and Yang Kai joining forces was enough to suppress him. If Zi Long made a mistake here, his life could even be at risk.

As such, the idea of withdrawing sprouted in Zi Long’s mind.

It was not too late for a gentleman to take revenge after ten years. In any case, his son’s Soul had been collected into the Soul Sustaining Bowl, so as long as he could gather the appropriate materials, it wouldn’t be difficult to build a new body for him after returning to Purple Star. Once that was done, Zi Long could mobilize all of Purple Star’s power to encircle and kill Yang Kai!

Understanding this, Zi Long took a deep breath and said coldly, “Boy, I hope the next time we meet you can still act as rampant as today!”

“You want to leave?” Gui Zu’s expression changed, “In your dreams!”

As he shouted, howls rang out from the Ten Thousand Soul Banner as it transformed into a black curtain that shot towards Zi Long, trying to engulf him.

“If this King wants to leave, neither of you can stop him!” Zi Long’s complexion remained unchanged as he formed a series of seals with his hands before his body was enveloped in a purple radiance that instantly broke through the Ten Thousand Soul Banner’s blockade and shot towards the Star Field.

Yang Kai observed which direction Zi Long escaped towards, raised his brow, and flashed a wry, mocking grin.

“Yang Kai, he’s getting away, why aren’t you chasing after him?” Gui Zu saw Yang Kai remain motionless and suddenly became anxious, “Letting him leave will only lead to endless troubles!”

“If he had fled in another direction, I might have had to pursue him, but since he picked that direction... en, he’s seeking death,” The expression on Yang Kai’s face remained inscrutable.

“What do you mean?” Gui Zu was confused when he heard this, having no idea what Yang Kai was talking about.

However, in the next moment, Gui Zu’s eyes bulged as he saw something both shocking and terrifying.

From somewhere in the Star Field, a massive palm slapped out strangely, without any warning, as if it had appeared out of thin air. More precisely, it seemed to appear from the spot where Yang Kai had left the floating continent only moments ago!

This palm was as big as a house, and although it appeared simple, there was a profound aura accompanying it that even a master on Gui Zu’s level was unable to completely understand. In other words, this power had exceeded the realm of an Origin King master.

The palm slapped towards Zi Long in a seemingly slow manner, but with a force so strong that space itself became turbulent as it passed through.

Zi Long was thoroughly shocked. He had suffered injuries just now and was trying to escape at this moment, but how could he have anticipated such a giant palm would suddenly appear out of nowhere to block his way?

Feeling the horrifying power behind this giant palm, Zi Long did not dare to underestimate it and madly pushed his Saint Qi and Domain in order to resist.

A shocking scene followed as the Domain which Zi Long had just released was crushed, shattered like glass as the giant palm continued towards him unabated.

It was as careless as if it was swatting a fly.

Zi Long was so frightened his Soul nearly left his body and he hurriedly poured his strength into his Artifact Armour, causing it to release a dazzling purple-red light while at the same time he condensed another layer of Saint Qi around his body.

*Hong...*

The giant palm landed on Zi Long and he was swept away like a ragdoll, blood pouring out of numerous wounds as he tumbled miserably through the void.

“Si...” Gui Zu sucked in cold air. Although he knew that this giant palm had incredible power behind it, upon seeing it land on Zi Long, he found that he had still underestimated it.

That palm was completely unremarkable, but it was extremely powerful!

What the hell was it, though? If this palm was already so gigantic, how big would the body it belonged to be?

Before he could even finish his thoughts, Gui Zu got an answer as the owner of the palm made his appearance.

Gui Zu was taken aback as he stared at the owner of this palm stupidly for a time before turning to Yang Kai and asking in amazement, “Is this guy your brother? Or your son?”

He saw that the owner of the giant palm was a stone giant more than three hundred metres tall; however, the face of this stone giant was somewhat similar to Yang Kai’s, and even had a similar air about it.

“Please don’t make such crude jokes, Supreme Elder,” Yang Kai said as his face went black.

“Then what the hell is this?” Gui Zu felt like he was going insane. He did not know what the giant in front of him was, but he was certain Yang Kai absolutely didn’t have it a few months ago, otherwise at the time why would he have needed to run?

With such a huge stone giant to assist him, who would he need to fear?

“My Embodiment!” Yang Kai replied in a deep voice.

“Embodiment?” Gui Zu frowned at first, but his expression soon turned to one a shock, “An external avatar? The same technique you used in the medicine valley? Does your Embodiment actually possess such a shocking ability?”

[No wonder this stone giant looks like Yang Kai, it turned out to be his Embodiment. However... was his Embodiment like this previously?] Gui Zu had heard of such Secret Techniques before, but generally speaking, the Embodiment of a cultivator had exactly the same appearance as its master while also possessing some of its master’s strength. It would act on its master’s orders, but it had a will of its own as well.

But this Embodiment of Yang Kai’s... wasn’t it a bit too unique?

“Yang Kai...” Gui Zu suddenly had a fiery look in his eyes and he turned to Yang Kai expectantly.

“Wait until after we kill this guy,” Yang Kai seemed to know what he wanted to ask.

“Sure!” Gui Zu nodded sharply.

Yang Kai grinned as he stared coldly towards Zi Long who was still coughing up blood not far away, his murderous intent soaring.

After taking the Embodiment’s blow, the purple-red Artifact Armour Zi Long was wearing had completely shattered. Despite this Battle Armour was an Origin King Grade Mid-Rank defensive artifact, it had been damaged by Yang Kai and Gui Zu’s joint attack, so how could it still endure after absorbing the Embodiment’s slap?

Yang Kai’s Embodiment had settled into this form after swallowing and refining the entire floating continent; in other words, the current Embodiment was the sum total of the floating continent’s essence.

An attack from the Embodiment was like the blow of an entire continent, including all the World Principles of the floating continent.

No matter how powerful a cultivator was, how could they withstand being struck by the weight of a two or three hundred thousand kilometre wide continent?

That kind of raw power, amplified by the rich Principle Strength, was something even Xiao Xiao, who belonged to the Stone Puppet clan, could not match!

Zi Long not being annihilated on the spot was a testament to his great strength.

However, he was now an arrow at the end of its flight.

Even so, Yang Kai did not relax his guard. Zi Long was a veteran Second-Order Origin King, so there was no guarantee he did not have trump cards left to play. As such, Yang Kai summoned out both Xiao Xiao and Liu Yan to assist him.

“Kill him!” Yang Kai pointed his hand forward.

The Stone Puppet and Firebird received this order and immediately rushed forward.

On the way, Xiao Xiao assumed his stone giant form, but compared with the Embodiment, it was still like the difference between a father and son.

Meanwhile, Liu Yan returned to her Firebird form, with purple lighting and crimson flames swirling around her body as she spread her wings wide.

The Embodiment also moved his huge body as he stepped towards Zi Long.

However, Yang Kai’s Embodiment was simply too big to perform quick actions, which was why Yang Kai had not released him in the first place. His Embodiment was indeed strong, but it was far from nimble.

So, Yang Kai had his Embodiment hide in The Void and wait for an opportunity to take action. He did not expect Zi Long to pass right by his Embodiment while trying to escape. Zi Long’s rotten luck even elicited some pity from Yang Kai.

If Zi Long had fled in another direction at that time, while Yang Kai might still have been able to catch up to and kill him, it would not have been as easy.

In the blink of an eye, Xiao Xiao and Liu Yan arrived above Zi Long’s head. Xiao Xiao held the Heaven Shaking Pillar in his hands and slammed it down with a great roar while Liu Yan opened her beak and spat out a jet of lightning-imbued flames that seemed to burn space towards Zi Long.

A look of despair filled Zi Long’s eyes.

Just as Yang Kai had expected, after suffering so many fierce attacks one after another, he was already an arrow at the end of its flight. Any ordinary Origin King would be able to kill him now, much less Xiao Xiao and Liu Yan’s joint strike with Yang Kai, Gui Zu, and the strange stone giant all watching him covetously.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only
