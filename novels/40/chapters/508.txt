Listening to Yang Kai say this, even the mild tempered Kang Zhan couldn’t resist coldly snorting, “Big words!”

Agreeing to Yang Kai’s proposal was nothing more than him not wanting to provoke further trouble, in Kang Zhan’s opinion, he was selling him a favor and giving him face, but now this person was actually shameless enough to say it was for his own good.

Such cheap rhetoric and arrogance naturally annoyed him.

Not paying Yang Kai’s words any mind, Kang Zhan waved his hand, “Brother Xiang, Brother Nan, send out your people.”

Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng nodded and signaled towards the crowd, the next moment two streaks of light shooting out from behind them.

In just the blink of an eye, two figures had already rushed over to Yang Kai’s position. One of these people was from the Xiang Family while the other was from the Nan Family, both of them old men at the Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary.

If not for Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng’s strong persuasion, it would have been impossible for the Xiang and Nan Families to send these two to participate in the Inheritance War.

Without a single word, the two old men struck towards Ying Jiu.

Both old masters went all out, trying to use overwhelming momentum to take Ying Jiu out in one fell swoop.

Two Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary masters attacking at once created an astounding pressure, immediately causing many of the High Heaven Pavilion members’ breaths to stagnate.

The violent power of these two strikes seemed to have created a whirlpool that drew in the lives of everyone around them.

Everyone was aghast; their faces turning pale, in the face of such astounding strength, none of them could even work up the will to resist.

Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu smirked as they smugly watched, secretly expecting Ying Jiu to be forced to display his Mad Tyrant Blood Skill.

But contrary to their expectations, Ying Jiu’s expression remained indifferent, suddenly disappearing just before the two old men’s attacks were about to reach him.

The looks on the Xiang and Nan Family masters swiftly changed. Suddenly having lost their target, a terrifying feeling welled up in their hearts.

The two masters hurriedly tried to retreat, but before they could, a sharp killing intent stabbed towards them from behind.

Before the two masters knew what was happening, a ghostly figure wielding two daggers appeared behind them and unleashed a series of slashes.

Flickering Shadow Strike!

The air was instantly filled with violent waves of energy, like ripples on the surface of a pond.

The arrogant expressions on Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng’s faces instantly solidified, soon being replaced by looks of fear and shock as they stared towards the sky.

Kang Zhan and Qiu Zi Ruo’s reactions weren’t much better.

Everyone, whether they were friend or foe, trembled at the sight of Ying Jiu’s strength!

Only Yang Kai chuckled and calmly said, “Martial Uncles, lead everyone else back to a safe distance.”

“Ah... en.” The old men from High Heaven Pavilion reacted as if they had just woken from the dream. Witnessing the battle between these three Immortal Ascension Boundary masters, they realized that even if they were to exert all their strength, they wouldn’t have any effect on the situation and would only end up dying unnecessarily. Understanding this point, they quickly led everyone else from High Heaven Pavilion away from the battlefield.

Only Yang Kai and Su Yan remained standing side by side at the front.

Su Yan’s long hair fluttered in the wind from the battle above as she turned her head towards Yang Kai and smiled.

*Shua Shua Shua...*

High up in the sky, the three masters separated from each other and stood mid-air facing one another.

Ying Jiu appeared just as he had a moment ago, his expression indifferent and his body unharmed.

On the other hand, the masters from the Xiang and Nan Families had expressions that were somewhat pale and their robes had been damaged here and there. Although they showed no signs of injury, this fight had made everyone realize that the Ying Jiu that stood before them now was already not the one they had previously known!

Also, this once again demonstrated to everyone present just how stunning the Yang Family Blood Warrior’s combat strength was!

Yang Family Blood Warriors, invincible amongst those of the same realm, commonly fighting those whose cultivation exceeded their own!

“Just you two? Insufficient!” Ying Jiu held his two daggers by his sides and shot a cold look at the Nan and Xiang Family masters in front of him, lightly shaking his head.

The two old men’s expression immediately became ugly!

“Brother Kang, Ying Jiu seems to have broken through to the Immortal Ascension Boundary Ninth Stage!” Qiu Zi Ruo also saw that the situation wasn’t good. In their original plan, the two Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary masters would distract Ying Jiu while the rest of the masters they brought captured Yang Kai, but now, with Ying Jiu reaching the Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary, that plan was no longer feasible.

“Since they can’t handle him alone, we just have to send more people up.” Kang Zhan was also dazed for a while but quickly collected himself and coldly ordered.

Qiu Zi Ruo nodded before signaling towards the group behind him. Immediately, four more figures flew up.

Two Immortal Ascension Eighth Stages and two Immortal Ascension Seventh Stages!

In addition to the previous two Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary masters, Ying Jiu was now facing a total of six people by himself, but his expression still remained indifferent, on the other hand it was the four newcomers who appeared nervous.

“Still not enough!” Ying Jiu shook his head, “If you want to contain me, you’ll have to send more.”

Kang Zhan and Qiu Zi Ruo’s expressions both became dark, secretly thinking that this Ying Jiu was too arrogant. Even if he was a Yang Family Blood Warrior, and had reached the Immortal Ascension Ninth Stage, he was still just one man.

“Mad Tyrant Blood Skill!” Ying Jiu suddenly muttered, his Blood Force rapidly rising and his True Qi surging wildly.

Everyone’s expression changed once more. None of them had thought that Ying Jiu would so decisively display the Blood Warrior’s forbidden technique.

This skill temporarily increased the intensity of a Blood Warrior’s Blood Force and True Qi at the expense of their vitality! In other words, every time a Blood Warrior used this skill, their lifespan would reduce.

Therefore, even if the Yang Family’s Blood Warriors had phenomenal strength, they generally didn’t live long lives. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

In an instant, Ying Jiu’s aura changed from being sharp yet silent to violent and wrathful, his exposed skin suddenly emitting a crimson glow like a red scorpion.

*Shua...*

Ying Jiu’s figure flickered, seemingly moving yet remaining exactly where he was; on the other hand, the masters who were confronting him all staggered backwards a few steps.

*Pu...*

With a splash of blood, before realizing what had happened, without even engaging Ying Jiu in combat, one of the Immortal Ascension Boundary Seventh Stage master’s eyes dimmed and limply fell from the sky.

Blood sprayed out like a fountain from this man’s throat and before he even hit the ground, his body burst into a bloody fog, even his bones disintegrating!

A chill that seemed to come from the depths of hell gripped the hearts of everyone who witnessed this, causing them to shiver uncontrollably.

“Still think you’re enough?” Ying Jiu’s two daggers flashed a cold light as he spun them in a dazzling pattern through his fingers, his wild aura suddenly condensing and becoming deathly still, and said, “If you think so, then die!”

Just as his voice fell, the two old men at the Immortal Ascension Boundary Ninth Stage yelled, “Be careful!”

At the same time, both of them jumped forward and summoned their respective artifacts, pushing their True Qi to the limit as they displayed their strongest skills.

Ying Jiu’s figure flickered through this wave of attacks, like a leaf floating through a violent storm, swaying back and forth yet never falling.

“All Immortal Ascension Eighth Stages go up!” Kang Zhan didn’t dare underestimate Ying Jiu, with his Immortal Ascension Ninth Stage cultivation and Mad Tyrant Blood Skill. This Blood Warrior before his eyes now had the qualification to fight an Above Immortal Ascension Boundary master.

The five men facing him right now really weren’t enough to contain him! Realizing this, Kang Zhan immediately issued an order for reinforcements.

*Shua Shua Shua*, four more figures leapt up from the ground, all of them cultivators at the Immortal Ascension Boundary Eighth Stage, this was every master at this level from all seven forces present!

With the addition of these masters, Ying Jiu’s movements weren’t as free and fluid as before, but his rhythm still hadn’t been disturbed.

He was like a drawn blade, invincible and all conquering, whenever the two daggers flashed, chaos and panic soon followed.

Ying Jiu who was proficient in speed, stealth, and assassination, still occupied a completely dominant position in this lopsided confrontation. His vague figure flashed in and out of his enemy’s sight, striking from their blind spots and then withdrawing before they could even respond, causing all of them to feel an insurmountable pressure crushing down on their hearts.

“It’s not enough!” Kang Zhan’s eyes flashed a desperate look, just as he spoke these words, in the sky, another Immortal Ascension Boundary Seventh Stage master let out a bloodcurdling scream and plummeted to the ground.

“Elder!” Someone shouted.

This person belonged to one of the weaker seven forces that had been deployed for this operation; his loss was a big blow to his Sect.

When this Immortal Ascension Boundary Seventh Stage master hit the ground, everyone saw that his two arms had been cleanly separated from his body, blood splashing out from the smooth wounds.

“Send more!” Kang Zhan’s face paled as he ordered once more.

Several Immortal Ascension Boundary Seventh Stage masters in the crowd behind him glanced at once another helplessly before shooting into the sky.

Finally, with the addition of these people, Ying Jiu’s movements finally stagnated somewhat.

This single Yang Family Blood Warrior was fighting evenly with two Ninth Stage, six Eighth Stage, and five Immortal Ascension Boundary Seventh Stage masters, greatly surpassing everyone’s expectations.

Even Ying Jiu himself was quite surprised.

Before he had broken through, he had repeatedly thought about how much his strength would increase once he reached the Ninth Stage. He had estimated that after breaking through and displaying his Mad Tyrant Blood Skill he would be able to contain several masters of equal cultivation, but he absolutely didn’t expect to be able to suppress so many at once.

Being able to face so many high level masters far exceeded Ying Jiu’s estimate of his own abilities.

He didn’t understand why this was; he only knew that right now he was capable of this. Although his situation wasn’t relaxed, and could even be described as dancing a knife’s edge, he wasn’t worried about losing his life for a short time!

[Is it because of those Mysterious Grade pills from the Pill Room?] Ying Jiu wasn’t clear, but that didn’t matter right now. What he needed to do was reduce the burden Yang Kai faced as much as possible.

Looking at the difficult fight Ying Jiu was having up in the sky, Kang Zhan and Qiu Zi Ruo couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief.

This situation was something they had never imagined before. Fortunately, the Second Young Lord had prepared for so many people for this ambush.

If he had accepted their proposal at the time, with just Ying Jiu, forget about capturing Yang Kai, they might not even have been able to escape themselves.

[Second Young Lord is really far-sighted!] At this moment, Kang Zhan and Qiu Zi Ruo felt a deep admiration for Yang Zhao’s foresight.

“It’s up to us now!” Kang Zhan took a deep breath and turned his eyes to Yang Kai who had been standing nearby this whole time.

With Ying Jiu being pinned down, the rest of them just needed to capture Yang Kai. Although most of the masters were occupied, Kang Zhan was still completely confident the rest of them could accomplish this task.

After all, he and Qiu Zi Ruo both had two Immortal Ascension Fifth Stage masters from Eight Great Families accompanying them a large number of masters from the seven forces.

With this lineup, Kang Zhan didn’t believe they couldn’t take Yang Kai!
