A light breeze blew over the serene wilderness and brought with it an austere air.

Ye Jing Han had noticed that something was amiss, but couldn’t pinpoint what it was. She just wrapped her outer clothing around herself and stood there with a nervous look on her face.

“Friends, will you show yourselves obediently... Or will I have to make a move and pull you out?” Yang Kai sneered suddenly and shouted at the void.

“What? There is someone here?” Ye Jing Han was alarmed by what she had just heard and she suddenly understood why she felt nervous for no reason. She asked in surprise, “What’s going on?”

“Someone is staring at us,” Yang Kai said with a casual tone without even an ounce of nervousness.

Yang Kai waited for a long while, yet no one responded, so he could only sneer, “It looks like you’re quite confident in your Concealment Technique and you think that I’m just playing tricks with you.”

As his last word echoed out, Yang Kai’s figure suddenly turned fuzzy and he appeared in the next moment a hundred metres ahead of where he stood earlier, palming towards empty space.

*Hong...*

An explosion echoed out, closely followed by an alarmed cry. A silhouette suddenly jumped out of the void and moved back thirty metres before it could regain its balance.

After this one move, Yang Kai returned to the wooden boat and stood with his hands clasped behind his back, calmly stating, “The rest of you should also come out. Don’t waste my time. I don’t want to expose you one by one. You’re not little children, so don’t play such games with me.”

Less than three breaths had elapsed since his voice fell when two more figures revealed themselves. If the one Yang Kai attacked was added to their number, it would make them a group of three.

Ye Jing Han observed in shock. If she didn’t get a warning from Yang Kai, then she wouldn’t have noticed that someone was hiding here. She already knew that Yang Kai was far stronger than her, yet she still didn’t expect that the disparity between them was this great.

After all, she was still a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, yet she did not manage to detect any danger lurking around them. If those three people had targeted her, then she would have been...

As she thought of this, Ye Jing Han’s whole body got drenched in a cold sweat.

“Hehe...” Yang Kai suddenly laughed and didn’t bother with observing the three that showed themselves, instead turning his head toward an empty region and asking, “Friend, you think your concealment skill is that good? Don’t you know that you’re standing opposite of where the wind is blowing and I can clearly sniff out your scent even though you’re standing that far away from me?”

After Yang Kai said so, another person showed up.

“Is there anyone else?” Ye Jing Han’s pretty face turned pale. After she released her Divine Sense, she realized that the auras of these four were hidden but it was obvious they were all powerful. They were most likely Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators. Anyone among them could easily kill her, yet, they had to face four of them at the same time.

Even though she had a good understanding of Yang Kai’s power, she still got worried for him and she wondered whether he could contend against four of them.

Those four were strange. They did not utter a single word after showing themselves and they all wore hideous ghost masks that hid their facial features.

It still wasn’t limited to just this, the masks were obviously some kind of special artifacts that obstructed the probing of Divine Sense. When Yang Kai had released his Divine Sense to try and see their true faces, he was obstructed by the masks.

Other than the masks, the four wore the same clothing. They all looked capable and experienced and they wore the same black attire with the sole difference between them being the character embroidered on their chests. They were respectively Wind, Thunder, Fire, and Mountain.

The aura emanating from these four was also somewhat unusual. It looked like they had some kind of subtle connection and resonance between them.

Upon noticing this, Yang Kai’s face fell. He had realized that those four people weren’t pushovers and they likely cultivated some sort of Formation Technique.

“Wind, Thunder, Fire, and Mountain?” Ye Jing Han furrowed her brows and a pensive look appeared on her face, as if she had just recalled something.

“Friends, why were you waiting for us here? What do you want with us?” Yang Kai asked with a smile.

Upon hearing this, they still stood there motionless for a long while, before the Ghost Masked Man with the ‘Wind’ character depicted on his clothes suddenly spoke, “Come with us!”

Yang Kai raised his brows and asked, “Who are you? And where do you plan to take us?”

The Thunder-titled cultivator said in a deep voice, “Don’t waste time questioning, you’ll know once you get there.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “Sorry, but I’m quite afraid of strangers. I have never met you and I won’t go with you. Hope to see you again.”

As he spoke, he pushed his boat to try to escape, but a sizzling noise rang out at that moment and an arc of lightning flashed from the Thunder-titled cultivator, barring the path forward as he snorted coldly, “This isn’t up to you.”

Yang Kai’s pupils contracted. He was quite amazed by this person’s speed. His short distance movement speed wasn’t any weaker than his own teleportation technique, and from the looks of the Source Qi emitted from this man’s body, he obviously cultivated some sort of Thunder Attribute Secret Art.

Thunder was strong and swift, so it wasn’t strange for this person to possess such high speed.

Yang Kai’s face sank. Those people had obviously hidden here for a long while, and from their attitude and what they had said so far, it was obvious they were here for him.

But, Yang Kai had no idea about the origins of these four, nor their objectives.

The factions he offended lately were only the Flying Saint Palace and the Evil Moon Valley, but those two Sects didn’t have such powerful cultivators and they wouldn’t dare make a move against him.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but wonder if it was the Myriad Swords that had brought trouble to him. But upon giving it more thought, he realized that it was quite unlikely. If they were simply after his sword, they wouldn’t have asked him to accompany them, they could just kill him and steal his treasures.

As Yang Kai mulled this over, he said with a smile, “Friend, you’re quite swift. May I ask what I’ll have to do for you after accompanying you?”

“We have nothing to tell you,” The Thunder-titled cultivator replied coldly.

“You’re all so haughty! I see that there is no more room for discussion between us.” Yang Kai’s mouth twitched.

“Don’t waste your breath with him, just take him down.” The Fire-titled cultivator had a hot temper, probably because he cultivated a Fire Attribute Secret Art.

Upon hearing Yang Kai’s blubbering, he let out a shout and a blood-red dagger appeared in his hand. Pushing his Source Qi, the Fire-titled cultivator sent a cloud of flames towards Yang Kai.

In an instant, the temperature of the area rose drastically and the sky had been dyed by a blazing scarlet colour.

“Blood Dagger!” Ye Jing Han covered her mouth with her little hand and cried in alarm while her pretty eyes flashed in fright!

Yang Kai furrowed his brow and moved away along with Ye Jing Han. He dodged that terrifying strike and appeared again dozens of metres from his former position, staring coldly at the four people around him as he asked, “Do you know the origins of these people?”

“The Blood Dagger, they are from Blood Dagger!” Ye Jing Han replied in alarm.

“Look, I’m asking what this ‘Blood Dagger’ is.” Yang Kai shouted impatiently.

Ye Jing Han took a deep breath, trying to calm down, “Blood Dagger isn’t a Sect per se, but rather an organization, yet it’s more powerful than most top Sects. It isn’t known where its headquarters is located, but its activities span all four Territories of the Star Boundary. They would frequently sell their services and help people resolve their troubles for a fee. As long as you can afford to pay them, they will assassinate anyone for you, and once they make a move, they won’t stop until they eliminate their target.”

As she spoke up to here, Ye Jing Han said in a shivering voice, “Young Master Yang, why is Blood Dagger targeting you?”

Yang Kai’s brow twitched as he replied, “I’m as confused as you.” He really didn’t even know an organization like Blood Dagger existed prior to this.

Saying so, he shouted at the four, “Friends from Blood Dagger, may I ask you who is after my life?”

“No one!”

Surprisingly enough, the Wind-titled cultivator replied to this question, “We have just received an order from our superiors to bring you to our headquarters. So, please cooperate with us.”

Yang Kai chuckled and said, “It looks like getting into the limelight is not such a good thing after all.”

“Young Master Yang, you’re still in the mood to joke around?” Ye Jing Han stamped her feet.

“Just take a look at me,” Yang Kai stared at Ye Jing Han earnestly and said in a deep voice, “Does it look like I’m joking around? Am I not in the limelight?”

“You... You... You drive me crazy!” Ye Jing Han was choking back so much rage that her face got flushed.

*Xiu xiu xiu...* Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The sound of something flying through the air suddenly rang out as the Wind-titled cultivator took the opportunity when Yang Kai was talking to Ye Jing Han to suddenly take out his dagger and make a move. He summoned several red blades of wind, which contained a sickening smell of iron, as if they had been formed by fresh blood.

Who knew how many people these cultivators had killed! Their attacks were all bloody and ruthless and had the same vicious aura.

Yang Kai’s body flickered again and he easily dodged the attack. He looked in mockery at the members of Blood Dagger, “If your powers are limited to just this, then go back home. It isn’t that easy to make a living in this world and you may lose your life at any moment.”

Upon hearing Yang Kai’s mockery, those four cultivators remained unmoved with the sole exception being the Fire-titled cultivator, who obviously showed anger in his eyes.

The Wind-titled cultivator nodded, “As expected, he’s proficient in the Dao of Space as the rumours say. It won’t be easy to deal with him.”

The Thunder-titled cultivator added, “That’s the reason why he’s so valuable. We have to take him back with us.”

“Let’s begin!” The Fire-titled cultivation shouted impatiently.

“Go!” As the Wind-titled cultivator shouted, his body shook and his wind surged. As the sound of the air being cut rang out again, a whirlwind started enveloping his body. The man was weaving hand seals with a heavy expression on his face as if he was using a powerful Secret Technique.

Meanwhile, the other three acted similarly, but the force surging out of their bodies was naturally different.

Yang Kai’s expression turned grave and he shouted at Ye Jing Han, “Protect yourself!”

As his voice fell, he flew toward his opponents with the Myriads Sword in his hand. An Emperor Pressure emanated from it while abundant Sword Qi and Sword Intent pervaded the region, as if it would shortly slice off a piece of the world. Yang Kai focused his strike towards the Wind-titled cultivator.

The opponents knew that he was proficient in Space Force, yet they still dared to obstruct him, so obviously they had a trump card up their sleeves and it was likely some Formation Technique.

Yang Kai had no idea about their power and skills, so how could he allow them to cast such a Secret Technique?

As he thrust out his sword, the world shook, like space itself was about to collapse.

The sword light had yet to reach the Wind character cultivator, but its bone-chilling murderous intent had already assaulted him. The man’s pupils contracted as he felt like death was looming over him, but he still didn’t dodge the strike and instead a resolute look flashed across his eyes and he started weaving hand seals at an even higher speed.
