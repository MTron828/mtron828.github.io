The Emperors were still alright when the music began to play, but the descendants and disciples that they had brought here reacted differently. The weaker their cultivation realms were, the greater the reaction. An Origin King Realm Junior was actually unable to control himself and let out a soft groan, while a look of satisfaction appeared on his face. Furthermore, a glorious light sparkled within his eyes, as though he had comprehended something.

As the ringing sounds continued, the box started to extend upwards. When this happened, the audience was able to see that the box was not some cosmetics container, but an item that appeared just like a pagoda. After extending upwards, a pagoda-like shape took form, extending roughly three hands into the air, with nine distinct levels to it.

Every level was rotating independently; some of them were turning to the left, and others to the right, some of them rotating quickly, while the others did so slowly. Following their revolutions, the music gradually started to change, though it still sounded as beautiful as before.

By the time the pagoda had completely formed, a hazy mist started to develop around it. An azure blue shade tinted the haze before it quickly spread through the interior of the hall.

As people raised their heads to look up and noticed a starry sky with a million twinkling points of light had replaced the ceiling of the palace.

The place the audience was in now did not seem to be within the Myriad Saints Palace, but among the incomparably vast starry sky. Extending their hands, they felt as though they could make contact with the stars, giving people an exceedingly strange and miraculous feeling.

The faces of the Emperors present grew serious as they gradually sensed how miraculous this treasure box was. Each of them started to ponder on what kind of price they would pay to obtain it.

As a soft sound rang out and the starry skies shattered before dissipating away. The incomparably beautiful scenery returned back to a blank ceiling, disappearing alongside the melodious music as the treasure box slowly closed up, turning back into its original box shape, looking all too ordinary as it had before.

Those Dao Source Realm and Origin King Realm Juniors instantly snapped back to their senses. As they did so, starving looks appeared on their faces as flames erupted within their eyes as they stared fervently at the treasure box.

Holding on to the treasure box, the old man gave a faint smile and spoke, ‚ÄúThis is the Heavenly Music Treasure Box. The heavenly melody it produces alongside its illusionary projection has great benefits to cultivators at or below the Dao Source Realm, allowing them to achieve twice the result in their cultivation with half the effort. Furthermore, there are absolutely no negative side effects to it. This treasure box was obtained by this Old Master by chance during my youth and has been accompanying me since the Saint Realm. Over the past thousand years, it played a huge role in forging this Old Master‚Äôs present accomplishments.‚Äù

After hearing the old man‚Äôs explanation, the audience was able to reaffirm their guesses. Although the Emperor Realm Masters present were not able to sense the miraculous effects of this Heavenly Music Treasure Box, they were able to deduce it from the reactions of their descendants and disciples, that this treasure was indeed extremely beneficial for cultivators with lower cultivations. By providing strange and miraculous music as well as a beautiful illusionary realm, it brought significant gains to all those cultivators who cultivated under its influence.

This was not something that Spirit Pills could substitute, as every Spirit Pill would contain some traces of impurities within it. Although it would not have any effect when consumed sparingly, it would not be advantageous to a cultivator‚Äôs growth if consumed in large quantities. However, the Heavenly Music Treasure Box was different, as every benefit it offered was completely pure.

This audience was now even more interested in the creator of such a treasure.

Furthermore, from the words of the old man, they knew that this Heavenly Music Treasure Box had accompanied him for the past thousand years. From this, they knew that this treasure was not something that current Artifact Refiners could refine. It was extremely likely that this item was refined a long time ago, and might even have been refined in ancient antiquity.

The old man continued to speak, ‚ÄúTruthfully speaking, this old man was not willing to take this treasure out to exchange. However‚Ä¶ this old man is single, has no descendants, and has no disciples; therefore, this Heavenly Music Treasure Box will be just like a pearl covered in dust if it continues to accompany this Old Master. Thus, this Old Master hopes that it can display its strength once again, as a form of gratitude for the many years it has helped him.‚Äù

This old man‚Äôs words sounded somewhat depressing, though it caused a shock to ripple in the hearts of the audience upon hearing his words.

Generally speaking, the path of a cultivator like this old man, without a Sect or any strong background would definitely be filled with challenges, difficulties, and hurdles. This would limit one‚Äôs accomplishments in the grand scheme of things, making it even more difficult to reach the Emperor Realm compared to other people.

However, as of now, this old man was an Emperor Realm Master, and it was highly likely that this Heavenly Music Treasure Box played a large role in that.

‚ÄúNevertheless, there is a matter that this Old Master has to let all of you know. Although this Heavenly Music Treasure Box is a miraculous treasure, it is absolutely ineffective towards Emperors. In fact, its effectiveness is greatly reduced even for those in the Dao Source Realm. Only those below the Dao Source Realm will be able to fully enjoy the benefits of this Heavenly Music Treasure Box.‚Äù

Appearing to be an honest person, the old man did not conceal any information and explained the quirks and features of the Heavenly Music Treasure Box.

Nevertheless, what was there to be wary of?

The Emperor Realms present here were not solitary existences like this old man, almost all of them belonging to great forces that had innumerable members below the Dao Source Realm.

Take Azure Sun Temple for example. This top Sect had cultivators of all cultivation realms, with one able to find a bunch of Dao Source Realms at any given moment. These people would greatly benefit from the Heavenly Music Treasure Box.

If Azure Sun Temple was able to obtain the Heavenly Music Treasure Box, their disciples in the Dao Source Realm and below would have one more advantage in their cultivation path.

This treasure had incomparably massive appeal for Sects and Families.

Therefore, some people could not help but to ask right after the old man finished his explanation, ‚ÄúOld Lu, can we know what you want in exchange for this Heavenly Music Treasure Box?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, Old Lu. Give a price!‚Äù

There were even some Sect Masters that were secretly sending transmissions to Old Lu. In fact, some Elders and even Vice Sect Masters were hoping that he could join their Sect. Nevertheless, they were bound to be disappointed as people like Old Lu were innumerable throughout the Star Boundary. Some of them would never chance upon any opportunities, and might be lacking in aptitude, which left them unable to join any Sect. However, some of them preferred to be wild and free like the cranes flying through the clouds, not willing to be fettered or bound by any force.

Without a doubt, Old Lu was the latter sort of person. If not, with his Emperor Realm cultivation, he would definitely be welcomed by any Sect should he wish to join. In fact, even Azure Sun Temple would give him a position should he request for it.

After a while, Old Lu finally replied, ‚ÄúA few years ago, this Old Master started to cultivate a certain Secret Technique that requires Monster Cores. Therefore, this Old Master hopes to exchange this Heavenly Music Treasure Box for Monster Beast Cores.‚Äù

‚ÄúMonster Beast Cores!‚Äù Both looks of happiness and looks of worry appeared across the audience upon hearing his reply.

‚ÄúThis Old Master needs Monster Cores, and they need to be Monster Cores from Twelfth-Order Monster Beasts. Furthermore, this Old Master wishes to exchange for two sets of Five Elements Monster Cores!‚Äù

‚ÄúFive Elements Monster Cores?‚Äù

‚ÄúMoreover, two sets?‚Äù

Shocked cries rang out, as frowns appeared on the faces of many Emperors, as they felt that this Old Lu was trying to take the lion‚Äôs share from this exchange.

Twelfth-Order Monster Beast Cores! Even if they were Low-Rank ones, each one of them was worth at least two or three million High-Rank Source Crystals. A full set of Five Elements Monster Cores would have to be comprised of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth Attributes, with prices ranging from ten to fifteen million Source Crystals. Furthermore, the price would be higher if they were to come in a complete set, pushing the price up to around twenty million.

A full set of Five Elements Monster Cores would be twenty million, while two sets would reach forty million in price!

Although the Heavenly Music Treasure Box was extraordinary, it was only useful for cultivators at or below the Dao Source Realm. Who would be willing to spend a few tens of millions of High-Rank Source Crystals to buy this? It wasn‚Äôt to say that they didn‚Äôt have that many High-Rank Source Crystals, but even if they did, this was not economical.

Therefore, the Emperor Realm Masters that were originally interested in the Heavenly Music Treasure Box immediately proceeded to curse under their breaths after hearing Old Lu‚Äôs reply.

Nevertheless, there were quite a few people that proceeded to cast their gazes towards Qiu Ran and the few Azure Sun Temple Elders present.

The Emperors present definitely could not take two sets of Five Elements Monster Cores. Therefore, the only people that could pay such a price would be the hosts of this exchange meet, Azure Sun Temple.

The audience immediately realized that Old Lu had taken out his Heavenly Music Treasure Box in this exchange meeting solely to deal with Azure Sun Temple. If even Azure Sun Temple wasn‚Äôt able to satisfy his request, there was no choice but for this exchange to fall through.

Indeed, Spiritual Energy started to surge between the Elders of Azure Sun Temple, a clear indication of them communicating amongst themselves.

After a short moment, Qiu Ran shook his head slowly.

A disappointed look instantly appeared on Old Lu‚Äôs face.

‚ÄúThe temple doesn‚Äôt want this treasure box?‚Äù Yang Kai asked Gao Xue Ting.

Being a High-Rank Guest Elder of the temple, he did not possess any authority or decision-making power on matters that concerned the benefits of the temple. That was why Qiu Ran and the others did not include him in their discussion on this matter.

‚ÄúThe price is too high. Furthermore, our temple does not have a full set of Five Elements Monster Cores,‚Äù Gao Xue Ting replied.

It wasn‚Äôt common to come across a Twelfth-Order Monster Beast Core, much less a full set. Although Azure Sun Temple had a few dozen Twelfth-Order Monster Beast Cores in their storehouses with rather good grades, they were lacking Earth Attribute ones. Therefore, they naturally were not able to satisfy Old Lu‚Äôs requirements.

‚ÄúIf the temple doesn‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll take it,‚Äù Yang Kai grinned.

Gao Xue Ting looked at him strangely, ‚ÄúYou have two sets of Five Elements Monster Cores?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have to discuss with him whether I have them or not,‚Äù Yang Kai smiled faintly in response before looking towards the stage and saying, ‚ÄúOld Lu, take a look and see if this meets your request.‚Äù

After saying that, he raised his hand and tossed a Space Ring out.

Receiving it, Old Lu swept his Divine Sense over it. A look of happiness quickly appeared on his face, before being followed up with a frown as he replied, ‚ÄúElder Yang, this seems to be slightly lacking.‚Äù

The Space Ring contained a set of Five Elements Twelfth-Order Monster Cores; however, there was only one such set. As the remaining two sets, they were made up of Eleventh-Order High-Rank cores.

Yang Kai shook his head and replied, ‚ÄúTwelfth-Order Monster Beast Cores, and moreover a full set? How could that be easy to obtain? Even these cores were something I obtained by chance. Old Lu, would you be willing to compromise and accept them? If not, we can only end things here.‚Äù

As they heard his reply, everyone immediately understood that the items Yang Kai had sent might not have reached Old Lu‚Äôs requirements; however, it should have also met some of them, which explained the latter‚Äôs hesitation.

Old Lu turned silent, not giving an immediate reply.

As he was hesitating though, Yang Kai sent him a Divine Sense Message, ‚ÄúHowever, I have some news that I can relay to Old Lu that concerns Twelfth-Order Monster Beast Cores.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúEvery half a year from now, there will be two Twelfth-Order Monster Cores that will appear at the Violet Source Chamber of Commerce in Maplewood City. There will even be High-Rank ones. If you pay close attention, Old Lu, you might even be able to obtain another set there in time.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you know about this news?‚Äù Old Lu was surprised.

[Those Monster Cores are going to be provided by me, so how would I not know about them?] Yang Kai quipped to himself.

Keeping such information to himself though, he replied, ‚ÄúI have an intimate friendship with one of the Managers of that branch of Violet Source Chamber of Commerce. This is something that he informed me about.‚Äù

Silavin: This week will be a treat. Think of it as me just celebrating Chinese New Year and New Year altogether.
