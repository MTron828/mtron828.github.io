A beam of light swept into the Universe Fragment that housed the Supreme Headquarters, and before the Human landed, his cries could already be heard, “E-5 Territory has been liberated!”

The Humans didn’t have a method to instantly relay information like the Black Ink Clan could with their Black Ink Nests. Also, the frontlines were very far from the Supreme Headquarters, which was why the news of victory in E-5 Territory had just arrived.

In the early days, the Supreme Headquarters was the centre of the several Great Territory Battlefields that the Humans fought hard to defend. The distance between battlefields wasn’t that great back then, so news travelled quickly. However, with the increased length of the frontlines, the 12 Human Race Armies had to move forward while the Supreme Headquarters stayed behind; hence, communication between them became extremely slow.

Previously, Mi Jing Lun had thought about moving the Supreme Headquarters to the frontlines, but he was only an Eighth-Order Master. If they decided to move the Supreme Headquarters forward, the Black Ink Clan would certainly target them. If the Pseudo-Royal Lords decided to launch a sneak attack, the Supreme Headquarters wouldn’t be able to survive.

When news of their victory arrived, Mi Jing Lun was discussing important matters with his peers at the Supreme Headquarters. At this moment, he was already a Ninth-Order Master!

He was originally a veteran Eighth-Order Master with a solid heritage, but due to the Open Heaven Realm Method’s restrictions, his limit was at the peak of the Eighth-Order, which was why he hadn’t made any progress for many years.

With the Supreme Grade Open Heaven Pill brought back by Yang Kai however, he was able to break through his limit.

After becoming a Ninth-Order Master, Mi Jing Lun finally had the qualifications to move the Supreme Headquarters to the frontlines. He was now discussing with his peers which Great Territory they should move into to better communicate with the 12 Armies.

When everyone heard the excited screams, they were stunned. Despite having expected this result, they were still elated.

!!..

With Yang Kai assisting the Red Flame Army in E-5 Territory, ending the battle there wouldn’t be much of a hassle, but everyone was curious about how big of a victory they had achieved.

A while later, a figure swept in from outside the Main Hall and happily reported, “Sirs, we have completely taken over E-5 Territory!”

Mi Jing Lun, who was standing around a table full of documents, nodded lightly and smiled, “Let me have a look.”

The messenger presented the report, and Mi Jing Lun checked it with his Divine Sense. Soon, a shocked expression appeared on his face as he stammered, “How…”

Although he knew that the Red Flame Army would certainly achieve great success with Yang Kai overseeing the situation, he wasn’t expecting the numbers to be so exaggerated.

“Supreme Commander Mi, how are the results?”

The others were looking at Mi Jing Lun expectantly. When they saw his expression change, they felt their hearts sink. [Didn’t we win? What’s with the shocked expression on Supreme Commander Mi’s face? Did the Red Flame Army suffer many casualties?]

At that instant, the crowd was feeling nervous.

With a bitter laugh, Mi Jing Lun said, “I’ve underestimated him still. See for yourselves.”

While he spoke, he gave the others the after-action report. The crowd immediately took turns scanning the record, and soon, each one of them looked shocked while secretly being amazed by Yang Kai.

The report showed the battle between the Red Flame Army and Black Ink Clan was fierce and tragic. Even the Eastern Army Commander almost died in that struggle. Thankfully, Yang Kai appeared out of nowhere and saved the situation by using a mysterious Dao Strength River to trap several Pseudo-Royal Lords, rescuing Zuo Qiu Yang Hua and the others and forcing the Black Ink Clan Army to retreat.

Afterwards, Yang Kai went to the Black Ink Clan’s base camp alone and captured two more Pseudo-Royal Lords…

In the end, eight Pseudo-Royal Lords died, shocking and terrifying the ones still alive so greatly that they all escaped through the Territory Gate.

After all the Pseudo-Royal Lords were either dead or had escaped, the Black Ink Clan Army lost all will to fight and retreated from E-5 Territory. Once again, Yang Kai attacked alone, and like crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood, he passed through the Black Ink Clan Army and used his Space Secret Technique to seal the Territory Gate. At that point, the Black Ink Clansmen that had yet to retreat were like turtles hiding in their own shells!

Meanwhile, Yang Kai also left E-5 Territory.

Although Yang Kai had left, the Black Ink Clan Army couldn’t stand a chance against the Red Flame Army without Pseudo-Royal Lords overseeing the situation, so the Humans in E-5 Territory began hunting down the remnant Black Ink Clan soldiers and within a month had wiped them out.

The military report was quite short, but every detail inside was astonishing. If the people at the Supreme Headquarters hadn’t known that it was impossible to fake anything on the battlefield, they would have suspected that the Red Flame Army had doctored their military report to gain Military Merits.

But seeing that Yang Kai had helped them, these results seemed reasonable.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

When Yang Kai set off to E-5 Territory to assist the Red Flame Army, they knew the battle there would end in their favour, so how could they not have thought about this result?

Yang Kai had killed eight Territory Lords in just two attacks. Such a terrifying accomplishment was impossible for other Ninth-Order Masters to achieve.

That realization traumatized the rest of the Pseudo-Royal Lords, causing them to run. Without the Pseudo-Royal Lords, the Black Ink Clan Army was an easy target!

Moreover, Yang Kai had sealed the Territory Gate, so the Black Ink Clan left in E-5 Territory had no choice but to fight till the end. That was what caused the shocking number of kills in the report.

One person alone could change the entire situation on a battlefield and lead the Army to achieve such glorious success. It was indeed marvellous!

“Where is Junior Brother Yang now?” After calming down, Mi Jing Lun looked at the messenger.

The messenger shook his head, “Senior Yang left after sealing the Territory Gate. Sir Zuo Qiu said that before Senior Yang left, he seemed like he was about to go to the No-Return Pass and said something about taking something back.”

“Going to the No-Return Pass to get something…” Mi Jing Lun felt his brow twitch. [That brat, does he think he can do whatever he wants because he’s strong now?]

The No-Return Pass was different from before. Two Royal Lords and several Pseudo-Royal Lords were overseeing that place. Even Ninth-Order Masters wouldn’t easily go there, but considering that it was Yang Kai heading there, Mi Jing Lun wasn’t too worried.

He didn’t know what Yang Kai was going to retrieve from No-Return Pass, but he knew Yang Kai had a purpose in everything he did.

While thinking so, Mi Jing Lun suddenly became serious while he thought about something.

The Black Ink Clan could use Black Ink Nests to quickly send out information, which was something the Humans didn’t have. After Yang Kai’s appearance in E-5 Territory, the Black Ink Clan lost the battle and paid a huge price. News of eight Pseudo-Royal Lords dying and the rest escaping would have already reached the No-Return Pass.

More importantly, it wouldn’t take long before the Masters of the Black Ink Clan on the other battlefields would receive this news…

If Mi Jing Lun’s estimations were right, the Pseudo-Royal Lords from other battlefields might have already found out about the situation in E-5 Territory.

At the thought of that, Mi Jing Lun jumped to his feet and ordered, “Hurry! Send orders to the Azure Sun Army. No, send orders to the Shocking Thunder, Burning Moon, Twin Instrument, Azure Dawn, and Jade Cicada Armies. Tell them to attack the Black Ink Clan regardless of their behaviour and don’t relent even if Pseudo-Royal Lords appear!”

Immediately, a herald went out to relay the orders.

Mi Jing Lun frowned and let out a dissatisfied groan, “Let’s hope we’re not too late!”

Then, he turned to the messenger and asked, “Did Zuo Qiu Yang Hua and the others mention what their next steps would be after taking E-5 Territory?”

The messenger replied, “After discussion, the Sirs decided to send reinforcements to the nearest Azure Dawn Army. If I’m not mistaken, the Red Flame Army should have already arrived.”

Nodding, Mi Jing Lun said, “That’s good. At the very least, the Black Ink Clan there wouldn’t be much of a problem.”

Now that both Armies had gathered together, the enemies couldn’t defeat the Azure Dawn Army. According to Mi Jing Lun’s estimations, the Black Ink Clan then would suffer a tragic end.

“Supreme Commander Mi, why are we only sending out orders to those five Armies? Don’t we need to inform the ones with Ninth-Order Masters?” One of Mi Jing Lun’s peers asked.

Mi Jing Lun explained, “Ninth-Order Masters have sharp senses, so they will immediately detect any strange changes in the Black Ink Clan Army and won’t need us to warn them, but the Armies without Ninth-Order Masters might not be able to detect the change in the situation and would still have to be wary of confronting the Black Ink Clan Army.”

“The change Supreme Commander Mi is referring to is…”

Mi Jing Lun quickly said, “Those Pseudo-Royal Lords might have already run!”

“What?” Someone exclaimed in shock, but the rest soon realised why Mi Jing Lun would say that.

The Black Ink Clan had paid a tragic price during the battle in E-5 Territory and even lost eight Pseudo-Royal Lords, the Masters which currently gave them the greatest advantage. From the recent military report, it was clear that Pseudo-Royal Lords didn’t stand much of a chance against Yang Kai, and Yang Kai had the ability to seal the Territory Gates and cut off the Black Ink Clan’s escape routes.

How could the Black Ink Clan not be worried about such an enemy?

Yang Kai had only joined one battle in E-5 Territory yet almost wiped out the entire Black Ink Clan Army there. So, what if he appeared in the other Great Territories?

No Pseudo-Royal Lord had the guts or confidence to face Yang Kai head-on. Even if they could muster up the courage to fight with Yang Kai, the always prudent Mo Na Ye wouldn’t let them do so and would instead order them to save their strength and immediately return to the No-Return Pass.

Therefore, all of the Pseudo-Royal Lords at the frontlines should have already evacuated.

The six Human Race Armies with Ninth-Order Masters would have noticed such movements, but the rest might not have. If the Black Ink Clan acted like they were ready to start a fight, the Humans might not dare to act recklessly, giving the Pseudo-Royal Lords the time and opportunity to flee.

The Pseudo-Royal Lords had contributed a lot in the battles on each battlefield, which was why the Black Ink Clan could stand a chance against the Humans. Now that they were gone, the Black Ink Clan had lost their capital to fight against the Human Race Armies. Hence, now was the best time for the Humans to make the most of this situation.

Everyone else finally understood why Mi Jing Lun would give out such an order.

This was the drawback of increasing the distance to the frontlines. The relay of information was too slow, so naturally coordination, relaying orders, and even the dispatching of reinforcements were equally slow. As the situation in each battlefield was ever-changing, there were many times when sending out information in time could decide the fate of a critical battle.

Luckily, Mi Jing Lun had broken through to the Ninth-Order, and they could finally move the Supreme Headquarters towards the frontlines so that such situations wouldn’t happen again.

It had been thousands of years since the Black Ink Clan invaded the 3,000 Worlds, plunging the Great Territories into misery. Now, it was finally time to take back their land!

Even though the Black Ink Clan had left behind a huge mess, this was the place the Humans had lived and thrived for countless years.

While looking into the distance, though Mi Jing Lun looked calm, he was actually excited inside. He could foresee that the Human Race would be able to get back their lost land in a matter of years. Originally, he was ready for a prolonged war with the Black Ink Clan, so he didn’t expect the situation to change so abruptly.

And all of this was actually because of one person.
