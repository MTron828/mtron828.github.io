Luan Feng bitterly smiled after hearing this. She knew that Yang Kai wanted to use her as a bodyguard, but right now, she couldn’t refuse him either. All she could do was agree, nodding, “Sir Yang, you are too polite. That Young Lady wanted me to take good care of you, so this Queen is duty bound not to refuse. Only, this Queen wants Sir Yang to remember that her identity is somewhat delicate and it isn’t appropriate for me to act too presumptuously in a Human Sect, otherwise it will definitely draw the attention of the Great Emperors.”

Although she was a Divine Spirit, she still had to give deference to the Ten Great Emperors.

At her peak, she might have been able to stand on par with one of the ten Great Emperors for a time, but she had recently given birth to a daughter and her foundation still hadn’t completely recovered. If she really acted outrageously in the Human Sect, she would surely be pursued by the Great Emperors. At that time, she would have to say farewell to her peaceful days.

Yang Kai clarified, smiling, “Lady Feng, you are mistaken, I’m not going to the Netherworld Sect intent on killing anyone.”

“Hehe…” Luan Feng smiled, unable to say for sure whether she should believe him or not.

“Let’s go!” Yang Kai beckoned before flying up with Ji Yao.

But Luan Feng didn’t move. Rather she turned around, her eyes flickering with a cold gleam as she stared at the kneeling Netherworld Sect disciples. She then raised her arm and palmed down lightly.

*Peng peng peng…*

A series of muffled explosions echoed as the dozen or so Netherworld Sect disciples exploded into a bloody mist, disappearing from the face of this world.

It wasn’t that Luan Feng enjoyed bullying the weak, but the offensive comments these few had made about her was not an insult she was willing to let slide.

After having finished the remaining Netherworld Sect disciples, Luan Feng finally turned around and flew after Yang Kai.

The several dozen Qi Family Fort disciples stood rooted on their spot, sweating buckets. Only after a long time did they finally come to their senses and realize that they were lucky this time and managed to survive.

“Young Fort Lord, they… have left!” An old man came to Qi Hai and gently reminded him.

Qi Hai was powerlessly kneeling on the ground, his eyes having lost all lustre as a bitter look filled his face.

…..

Luan Feng was extremely familiar with the Eastern Territory. According to her, she had travelled around in the Star Boundary in her human form multiple times in the past, so she was quite familiar with the geography of the Star Boundary.

Under her lead, Yang Kai’s trio arrived at a city called Peaceful Sea City in just one day.

After entering the city, the trio head straight to the City Lord’s Mansion.

The City Lord of Peaceful Sea City was a First-Order Emperor, so when he came to learn that someone had trespassed into the City Lord’s Mansion, he was furious and hurriedly rushed out of his retreat. But before he could ask any questions, Ji Yao, under Yang Kai’s order, released a bit of her cultivation pressure and immediately rooted the City Lord in place. He didn’t dare to make a rash move.

Under everyone’s eyes, Yang Kai’s trio ‘borrowed’ the Space Array at the City Lord’s Mansion and left right away.

After the three had gone, the City Lord heaved a sigh of relief, his back dripping with cold sweat.

Following the same procedure and multiple teleportations, the trio finally arrived at Netherworld City.

“Sir Yang, Netherworld City is the closest city to the Netherworld Sect and was under the direct management of it. From here, it will only take two hours to reach the Netherworld Sect,” Luan Feng explained to Yang Kai after stepping out of the Space Array.

Yang Kai, nodding and beckoned, “I will have to trouble Lady Feng to lead the way.”

Luan Feng agreed, smiling, “Please follow me.”

After having been together with Yang Kai for a few days, Luan Feng realized that Yang Kai had a gentle temperament and was quite polite to her, unlike the arrogant and unyielding attitude he had shown in the Ancient Lands. This had put Luan Feng at ease as she knew that Yang Kai would not commit all matters of evil using her.

After exiting the City Lord’s Mansion, the trio headed straight to Netherworld Sect.

After two hours, a cultivation paradise with tall mountains and great rivers appeared before the trio. On the continuous rising and falling mountain range, there were many beautiful palaces and pavilions with streams of cultivators moving about. It was a place filled with rich World Energy, indicating a High-Rank or even better Earth Vein was located here.

However, this place gave Yang Kai a different feeling from other cultivation paradises he had been to because there was dense Yin Qi in the air. It was probably related to the Secret Arts of Netherworld Sect.

Netherworld Sect disciples all cultivated wicked Secret Arts, and all the artifacts were Yin Attributed. On top of that, there was also that strange Netherworld Pond inside their Sect’s headquarters, so over time, this cultivation paradise had turned into a ghastly place.

The disciples guarding the mountain range were just in the Dao Source Realm, so when the trio flew past them, the patrols didn’t even notice them.

Probably, they might not have ever expected that some people in this world would dare to trespass into the Netherworld Sect unannounced.

After entering the Netherworld Sect, the trio flew forward, ostentatiously and leisurely as if no one could stop them. Yang Kai was looking left and right, constantly inspecting the surroundings.

Luan Feng asked, “Sir Yang, are you searching for the Netherworld Sect’s Sect Master, Fu Bo?”

Yang Kai replied with a question of his own, “Mhmm, Lady Feng, do you know where he is?”

Luan Feng shook her head, “This Queen also has no idea as I have never been to the Netherworld Sect before.”

“Then we should just ask someone.”

While the two were chatting, they suddenly heard a shout nearby, “Hey you, stop right there!”

Yang Kai, hearing this shout, turned to look and in the next moment, he saw a streak of light flying over. Only when it arrived closer did the streak of light separated into two, revealing two figures, one of a man, and the other of a woman.

The man appeared to be in his thirties, but his face was a little yellowish and he had a sallow aura while the bridge of his nose had grown somewhat dark. He was only in the First-Order Dao Source Realm, but was wearing extremely luxurious clothes. By the looks of it, his status wasn’t low.

And as for the woman, she had a tender gaze and her cheeks were flushed. Her hair was a little messy and her eyes were bright and intelligent. She was quite beautiful, especially her figure, which appeared extremely ravishing. Her cultivation was also two Minor Realms higher than the man’s, putting her in the Third-Order Dao Source Realm.

As soon as the man and woman came near, an obscene smell wafted from them.

Yang Kai had a lot of experience in this regard, and the moment he smelled it and took a look at the woman’s enchanting appearance, how could he not tell that the man and woman had just been enjoying each other’s company? He secretly smiled in his heart at the fact that these two were in the mood in broad daylight.

Who knows just where they had been and what they were doing?

Luan Feng, on the other hand, furrowed her brow and asked, “What’s this smell?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Although she had a daughter, she had definitely not become pregnant after consummating with a subordinate Monster King as Yang Kai had thought before. Instead, she had used her own Blood Essence and Vitality to form a fetus and then gave birth. In regards to the matters between men and women, Luan Feng was like a blank piece of paper, so how could she know about the origins of this smell?

But instinctively, she abhorred this smell.

“Well, a true icy beauty!” As soon as the young man arrived before the trio, his eyes were completely glued on the cold-faced beauty, Ji Yao.

Because they cultivated Ice Attribute Secret Arts, many of the disciples of Ice Heart Valley had naturally cold temperaments and expressions, giving them unapproachable auras that seemed to push others away.

After a bath and applying some makeup, Ji Yao had long lost her dirty and messy appearance. Her enchanting appearance and slim figure, coupled with her cold aura, could easily arouse a man’s desire to conquer her.

The young man before them was undoubtedly the kind of person who wallowed in women, otherwise, why would he drag his female companion to do such shameless deeds while the sun still hung high in the sky.

“Scram!” Being stared at by this young man, Ji Yao felt extremely uncomfortable and she immediately shouted in an ice-cold voice.

“Ha, a little feisty! I like it!” The young man clearly had quite thick skin. Ji Yao had bluntly rejected him, but he appeared to be enjoying this as if it was an invitation. His eyes were gleaming with greed and lust. He was despicable to the bone.

Yang Kai pulled Ji Yao behind him and looked at the young man with a smile.

The young man’s face immediately turned cold before asking with a cold snort, “Who are you? If you are Netherworld Sect disciples, why haven’t I seen you before?”

Yang Kai indifferently replied, “You don’t need to worry about who we are. We have come to the Netherworld Sect to settle some accounts. Tell me, where can I find your…”

Before Yang Kai could finish his sentence, the young man looked as if he had found a treasure and his eyes widened as an even greedier gleam appeared in them. Staring at Luan Feng, he smacked his lips and shouted, “What a beauty! Hahaha, this Young Master’s fortune is shining today! En, it’s decided, you will warm my bed for me tonight!”

Compared to glacial beauty Ji Yao, the young man seemed to prefer mature and charming women.

Previously, his gaze was attracted by Ji Yao, so only now did he finally discover Luan Feng’s existence. When he did though, he was so excited that his breathing grew ragged and his eyes gleamed with greed and perversion.

As he spoke, he actually tried to reach out and seize Luan Feng.

By the looks of it, it was apparent that he wanted to forcefully take Luan Feng in his captivity.

“Young Man, you’re so…” Yang Kai was scared and hurriedly stepped aside.

“You court death!” Luan Feng was enraged.

With her identity and status, even if the Netherworld Sect’s Sect Master, Fu Bo, came here in person, he would have to treat her with the utmost respect, but now this ignorant First-Order Dao Source Realm waste actually dared to grab at her. Not only that, he had made obscene remarks at her, even demanding that she warm his bed.

Even a monk could be angered, let alone Divine Spirit, Luan Feng.

While grabbing Luan Feng, the young man shot a glance at Yang Kai, his eyes filled with both contempt and admiration. As if he was saying that Yang Kai was quite an understanding fellow.

Naturally, he saw Yang Kai moving to the side just now and thought Yang Kai was afraid of him. This immediately boosted the young man’s vanity, “Baby, you better not resist! This Young Master’s grandfather is the Netherworld Sect’s Great Elder. You will enjoy inexhaustible benefits from this Young Master in the future!”

Luan Feng made a light snort and smacked out a palm.

The young man didn’t even realize what happened before he was smashed into a blood mist by the palm, leaving not even a single bone behind.

“Ahh!!” The woman who was with the young man, instantly turned pale and she hurriedly covered her mouth as her pretty eyes violently trembled.

Looking at the blood raining down from the air, she froze in disbelief.

The grandson of the Great Elder, to whom she had given herself willingly after she was promised enormous benefits, had died just like that, before she could collect even a single Source Crystal! If he was going to die, he should have given her what he promised first!

As she stared at the gore-filled pool of flesh and blood and remembers that this puddle used to be a man who had committed all kinds of perverted acts to her just moments ago, the woman immediately turned pale and flew to the side, emptying her stomach of all its content, vomiting so hard that everything went black before her eyes for a while.
