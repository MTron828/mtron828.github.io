Chapter 2161, Separating

Soon, the blood monster was buried under a pile of countless golden coins.

Seeing this scene, Yang Kai vaguely foresaw what Kong Qi’s next move would be and quickly opened up some distance.

As he thought, just as he pulled back, Kong Qi suddenly shouted, “Death!”

As soon as this word fell, a buzzing sound rang out.

The countless golden coins all suddenly transformed into extremely sharp blades and swiftly cut through the body of the blood monster...

A moment later, the golden light dissipated, and the countless golden coins merged back into one again that was taken back by Kong Qi.

As for the blood monster, it had been sliced into innumerable razor-thin pieces, most of its body now just a puddle of liquid that flowed freely across the ground.

The hall quickly filled with a disgusting smell.

“Hmph, nothing much!” Kong Qi landed with dashing style as he coldly snorted, and if it weren’t for his pale face, his bravado would have been quite convincing.

The move just now obviously consumed a lot of his strength.

Yang Kai smiled slightly and was about to open his mouth to say something when suddenly, his brow furrowed and he began looking around intently.

“What now?” Kong Qi frowned when he saw Yang Kai’s actions.

“Brother Kong... haven’t you noticed that the barrier around this room still hasn’t been eliminated?” Yang Kai glanced towards the hall’s exit and asked.

After he mentioned this, Kong Qi also began looking around and soon muttered aloud, “You’re right... but why?”

“There are two possibilities!” Yang Kai’s complexion darkened as his expression became solemn, “The first possibility is that this barrier is somehow related to the room itself and has nothing to do with that blood monster, so even if it died, the barrier wouldn’t necessarily disperse.”

“And the other possibility...” Kong Qi was no idiot and clearly understood what Yang Kai wanted to say, his glancing down as he shouted, “It’s not dead!”

As soon as his words fell, the pool of blood-red pus on the ground began squirming towards the pool in the middle of the room, like a living creature.

“It survived that!?” Kong Qi was shocked.

The blood monster had been hit by his strongest Secret Technique and been cut into innumerable pieces.

“The blood pool is the key!” Yang Kai seemed to realize something and shouted.

As he spoke, the blood monster’s remnants continued to pour into the blood pool and soon began to boil up, as if it was re-constituting itself and about to be reborn.

“So troublesome!” Kong Qi couldn’t help taking a few steps back with a look of fear and anxiety, quickly suggesting, “We’d be better off joining forces and break through this barrier and escape!”

Kong Qi really didn’t want to fight against this peculiar and seemingly indestructible anomaly any further.

Yang Kai, however, just stood in place, turning a deaf ear to Kong Qi’s suggestion.

“Did you hear what I said?” Kong Qi frowned and shouted.

“En...” Yang Kai finally nodded with a grin, “There’s no need for that though. I suddenly have a good idea!”

“What?” Kong Qi asked in amazement.

But Yang Kai didn’t answer and instead flew over the blood pool before assuming a strange stance, stretching out his hands as he shouted, “Ocean Draining Divine Art!”

“What the hell?” Kong Qi’s mouth twitched, really wondering what Yang Kai was up to, because according to his knowledge and experience, there was no such thing as the Ocean Draining Divine Art, which either meant it was some kind of Secret Art Yang Kai made up by himself, or some obscure garbage Secret Art.

The next moment though, Kong Qi’s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.

The squirming blood in the pool was actually being sucked up into Yang Kai’s hands, continuously flowing into his palm and disappearing without a trace!

The blood in the pool roiled even more fiercely as faint roars of struggle rang out; however, because the blood monster’s body had yet to fully re-form, it was simply powerless to resist and could only be sucked into Yang Kai’s palm.

Yang Kai’s palm was like a bottomless pit at this moment, accepting the blood pool filled with a rich malevolent aura.

Kong Qi was dumbfounded and couldn’t help feeling like a storm was raging inside his heart. Rubbing his eyes constantly, he kept wondering to himself if everything he was seeing was an illusion...

But no matter how he looked at it, the scene before him was entirely real.

At the same time, Yang Kai maintained his strange pose while keeping his Sealed World Bead in a blind spot of Kong Qi’s field of vision. Using his Divine Sense, Yang Kai asked his Embodiment once again, “Are you sure you can refine this thing?”

The Embodiment quickly replied, “There is a huge amount of energy contained in the bloody water, which is of great use to me. There is nothing the Heaven Devouring Battle Law cannot devour, so how could this trivial pool of blood be an exception? I’ve even refined two Dao Source Realm cultivators before!”

“Well, since you’ve said so...” Yang Kai didn’t ask any more questions. If it wasn’t for the Embodiment suddenly sending him a message just now, he would not have used the Sealed World Bead to suck this pool of blood into the Small Sealed World. Pausing for a moment, he warned, “Still, you should be careful to make sure this thing’s wicked aura doesn’t contaminate your Soul!”

“I know.”

Inside the hall, Kong Qi’s expression changed from surprise to shock, then shock to astonishment...

And as time passed, the pool of blood, accompanied by many howls and wails, was drained dry. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The moment the last remnants of the bloody water were drained, the barrier around the room broke.

Finished with the absorption, Yang Kai formed a series of seals with his hands, as if he was completing some kind of profound Secret Art.

Next, he turned around and patted his stomach before letting out a loud burp, as if he had just eaten his fill.

Kong Qi’s face turned green...

“Brother Kong, it’s been good cooperating with you! As expected of an elite from the Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce, that Falling Golden Coins technique you used really opened my eyes. As expected, Brother Kong is worthy of his illustrious reputation, I...” At this point, Yang Kai paused, tilted his head, and looked at Kong Qi curiously, “Why are you making such an expression?”

Kong Qi’s face was twisted and his mouth was twitching slightly, “I just want to ask, is there anything abnormal with your body...?”

“Nope!” Yang Kai replied, walking forward while talking.

Kong Qi stepped back a few steps and raised his hand, “Don’t come over, just stand there and speak.”

If Kong Qi’s attitude towards Yang Kai had previously been disgust and vigilance, it was now pure disgust... He looked at Yang Kai like he was some kind of maggot crawling out of a dung pit, not daring to stare straight at him.

“Brother Kong seems to enjoy clear, clean relationships,” Yang Kai grinned and said with deep meaning.

“This has nothing to do with whether I like being clean or not!” Kong Qi tried to endure the discomfort in his stomach as he replied sharply, closing his mouth firmly after he spoke.

“En, by the way, there is one more thing I should tell Brother Kong. About that spirit fruit, after you go back, you should consult with a senior expert to carefully identify it and its effects. Don’t consume it lightly,” Yang Kai warned.

After all, although the two Flowing Time Fruits looked identical, their effects were completely opposite, and the one that Yang Kai gave to Kong Qi... had a slight issue with it.

If Kong Qi were to suffer from this, Yang Kai would feel a bit responsible.

“You don’t need to remind me of such things,” Kong Qi frowned, secretly feeling that Yang Kai was being intrusive.

“That’s good.” Yang Kai grinned and said, “Now that the matter here has concluded, why don’t you and I...”

Before he could finish speaking though, Kong Qi cupped his fists and said, “Farewell!”

Turning around, Kong Qi flew out of the room.

He didn’t even bother to offer some polite parting words, as if he hoped to never meet Yang Kai again.

“Why so hasty...” Yang Kai looked at the direction where Kong Qi disappeared and muttered to himself, standing there for a moment to ponder before ultimately deciding to follow after Kong Qi.

Although he had accidentally chosen the same path as Kong Qi, it was too late to turn back now. The other cultivators had probably all escaped from the Illusion Array and flooded into the different forks.

Even if Yang Kai backtracked and chose a different path, it was still likely he would have to follow in someone else’s footsteps. Doing so would be a waste of time.

Following along the corridor dotted with light stones, Yang Kai saw a few barriers and restrictions, but all of them had been broken by Kong Qi who had gone on ahead.

As such, Yang Kai was able to proceed quite leisurely.

After walking for about half an hour, Yang Kai suddenly looked up and grinned at a figure standing in front of him, “Brother Kong, were you waiting for me here? Did you encounter some kind of trouble?”

“No.” Seeing him approaching, Kong Qi felt a sense of panic inexplicably and hurriedly stepped back a few steps before asking, “There’s a fork here, which one do you want to go down?”

Yang Kai heard this and looked forward to discover another fork in the corridor; this time, however, there were only two different paths.

As his eyes turned, Yang Kai immediately understood why Kong Qi was waiting here.

This guy obviously didn’t want to go down the same path as him, so he had paused here to confirm that they went their separate ways.

“Which one does Brother Kong want to take?” Yang Kai asked with a smile.

Kong Qi’s brow twitched as he said, “Whichever one you don’t take!”

“Is that so... I still think it would be best if Brother Kong and I...”

“Don’t mention that again!” Kong Qi hurriedly cut in, his face turning serious as he snapped, “Hurry up and choose!”

“Then I’ll go this way,” Yang Kai casually pointed his finger at the fork to the right.

As soon as these words came out, Kong Qi’s figure shot off into the left fork and soon disappeared.

“That guy is quite interesting!” Yang Kai stared in the direction Kong Qi disappeared, grinning wryly before he turned and stepped into the right fork.

In fact, even if Kong Qi didn’t intentionally wait for him here, Yang Kai would have chosen a different direction. Although it was convenient to have someone clear the way for him, if there were no benefits left behind to collect, there was no point.

Travelling forward, things were fairly uneventful. Although there were a few small restrictions here and there, Yang Kai successfully cracked them and moved on.

At a certain moment though, a ray of light suddenly appeared in front of Yang Kai, surprising him. Looking up ahead, he found that there was a doorway at the end of the corridor, one that was emitting a bright light.
