“Who are you? How dare you speak ill of Grandpa?” Zuo Ling immediately lashed out in anger. She promptly raised her hand as a Fire Dragon flew out from her palm, flying straight at Yang Kai.

She was already sad and heartbroken, so when she heard Yang Kai accuse Zuo De in such a blatant manner, she couldn’t take it anymore. She wanted to beat Yang Kai up to vent her anger.

Thus, she attacked without a moment of hesitation.

As Zuo De’s granddaughter, Zuo Ling had a good aptitude, and coupled with massive amounts of pills provided by Zuo De, she had reached the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm despite her young age. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Although she attacked casually, the attack itself was quite powerful. The surrounding temperature shot through the roof Just as the Fire Dragon shot through the air, bearing its jaws at Yang Kai.

“Ling’er, stop!” Zuo De was struck with panic. Zuo Ling was young and impulsive. He might not have a proper idea where Yang Kai’s limits lay, but he had heard from Zhan Yuan that Yang Kai was a Second-Order Origin King Master. Zuo Ling wasn’t his opponent, no matter what.

And in case Yang Kai got angry and hurt Zuo Ling, it would be a big loss.

However, he was a bit late. When he shouted, the Fire Dragon was already before Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s expression remained the same, nonetheless. He remained still in his place. All he did was stretched his hand out, opened his palm and grabbed at the Fire Dragon at his own pace. Immediately, flames and sparks scattered around in the air as the surrounding temperature returned to normal.

Zuo Ling was dumbstruck. Obviously, she hadn’t expected her attack to be so easily dealt with by the opponent. She also came to realize that Yang Kai was far stronger than her.

Nevertheless, she wasn’t afraid. On the contrary, she nibbled her lips and screamed, “Grandpa, he is bullying me. Help me teach him a lesson!”

While speaking, she shook Zuo De’s arm to and fro constantly. Zuo De’s old body immediately shook left and right like a ship in a storm.

Zuo Ling always believed Zuo De to be omnipotent because all those Origin King Realm masters acted all respectful before him. So after she had suffered a little, she immediately counted on Zuo De to stand up for her.

But how could Zuo De do anything? He was respected by the Origin King Realm masters because of his Alchemy skills and not because of his cultivation. He was just a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator. If he tried to teach Yang Kai a lesson with his own cultivation, it would be tantamount to courting death!

Yang Kai could not help but sneer.

Anyhow, he was a Second-Order Origin King master now, he could teach Zuo Ling a lesson for attacking him. But if he really acted all serious because of the misdemeanours of a little girl, he felt that he would be making a fuss over a small issue. But who would have thought that Zuo Ling would shout at Ai Ou when she saw Zuo De not respond after so long, “Uncle Ai Ou, kill him! If you kill him, I’ll ask Grandpa to refine that whatever Source Pill!”

Yang Kai’s face immediately darkened just as he heard this.

A strange look also appeared on Ai Ou’s face. [Is it my turn to give in if anyone annoys this pampered girl?!]

It was understandable for a pampered girl like her to be a bit willful but it was really too much to take someone’s life just because she was pissed. Not to mention, she started it; Yang Kai wasn’t responsible for this. As long as anyone had a little brain, he would not agree with Zuo Ling. More importantly, one would be offending a Second-Order Origin King master.

“Uncle Ai Ou, didn’t you invite Grandpa to refine that pill? You are so powerful, he is definitely not your opponent. Just kill him already.” Zuo Ling, pointing at Yang Kai, exhorted Ai Ou in an arrogant and overbearing manner like she was ordering a subordinate.

“Er...” Ai Ou forced a smile and said, “Miss Ling, Uncle is not necessarily his opponent.”

“How is that possible? Aren’t you the President of the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, one of the most powerful people in the world? How could you not be his opponent? Oh, I get it, you don’t want that pill.”

“Ling’er, stop fooling around!” Zuo De couldn’t take it anymore and shouted.

Zuo Ling’s face crumpled when she noticed that her Grandpa was really, really angry. She no longer pestered endlessly. But when she saw Yang Kai’s expression, she became extremely irritated. She grit her teeth so hard that they were rattling. She looked as if she would rush and bite Yang Kai hard.

“Xue Yue, you made the right choice by not agreeing to this marriage,” Yang Kai said with a smile. “If you married someone like her, your life would be miserable.”

Xue Yue glared at Yang Kai but didn’t retort.

“Your Excellency, you have been provoking this old man time and time again. What on earth do you want?” Zuo De glared at Yang Kai gloomily. He looked displeased and angry.

“Hehe, again with that! I am just stating the truth.” Yang Kai gave an indifferent smile.

“Ling’er had indeed been pampered by this old man, but her nature is still good. So, you can’t make such a comment!”

“She is willing to take someone’s life at her will and you say her nature is good!? If I was a Saint King rather than a Second-Order Origin King, I’m afraid my corpse would be lying where I stand!” Yang Kai ceaselessly sneered.

“If you were a Saint King, you would not have been qualified to talk to this old man!”

“Unfortunately for you, I’m not!”

“That’s enough!” Zhan Yuan immediately stepped out; he couldn’t take the sight of Yang Kai giving tit for tat to Zuo De anymore, “Your Excellency, you are really being disrespectful to the Honored Teacher. Have you forgotten who refined the pills you have used to cultivate all these years? Every cultivator, who knows a little bit of gratitude, would not treat a highly respected Grandmaster Alchemist like you did!”

“When one drinks water, he must not forget where the water comes from!” Yang Kai nodded. “You want to say this, right? Sorry, but as I’ve told you before, I’m an Alchemist. All the pills I have taken were refined by me. As the adage goes, two of a trade seldom agree. So I don’t have to be grateful to any Alchemist.”

“Your Excellency is also an Alchemist?” Zuo De’s eyes glistened with a sharp gleam. He didn’t seem to believe it.

“That’s right!”

“Oh!?” A sneer appeared on Zuo De’s lips. “Dare I ask what level of Alchemist are you? Where is your Alchemist’s badge!?”

“I don’t have it. And as for what’s my level, I can’t say.”

The nearby Zhan Yuan sneered. “Honored Teacher, why take this guy seriously? His Martial Dao cultivation might be deep but he isn’t that old. Even if he is an Alchemist, he isn’t worth your notice. You are standing at the peak of the entire Star Field.”

Zuo De smiled proudly, looking at Yang Kai with a sliver of contempt.

“Peak!? Not necessarily!?” Yang Kai chuckled and said, “Although there aren’t many Origin King Grade Alchemists, I know one who is younger than Grandmaster. She will certainly go farther than Grandmaster in the future!”

Naturally, he was talking about Xia Ning Chang.

“Bullshit!” Zuo De shouted. He appeared to be angry. “This old man has already reached the peak of Low-Rank Origin King Grade and could break through to Mid-Rank Origin King Grade anytime. Who can surpass this old man in the entire Star Field!”

When the field he was proficient was mentioned, Zuo De became aggressive and didn’t show the slightest bit of sign of backing down.

“Grandmaster doesn’t believe it!?” Yang Kai looked at him with a smile.

“Bring that person here, this old man will compete with him and make him accept defeat!” Zuo De let out a cold snort.

“That person is billions of miles away, I can’t bring her on such short notice. However, if Grandmaster really wants to compete... How about this Yang competes with Grandmaster? This Yang believes that his Alchemy skills aren’t worse than hers. If you can defeat this Yang, this Yang will admit what you just said, but if you can’t even beat this Yang then, he he...”

Everyone on the stairs of the main hall looked at Yang Kai with a slack jaw as if they had seen something unbelievable.

Zong Ao’s jaw slackened so wide that one could stuff their fist in it.

Ai Ou’s expression changed as many thoughts flashed in his mind. Suddenly, he seemed to have realized Yang Kai’s intention as a sharp gleam flickered in his eyes involuntarily. He was filled with extreme gratitude.

[Anyhow, this Yang Kai is indeed a good guy and is worth making friends with.]

“What!? What did you just say?” Zuo De stared at Yang Kai in surprise. He suspected that there was something wrong with his ears.

“Grandmaster’s age is catching up with him.” Yang Kai heaved a sigh. “This one just said that Grandmaster might as well compete with this Yang in Alchemy.”

“You want to compete with this old man in Alchemy?” Zuo De broke into laughter before speaking disdainfully, “This old man really can’t see what’s making you so confident.”

“Grandmaster doesn’t need to worry about this. All Grandmaster needs to do is tell me whether you are going to do it or not!”

“Hmph, do you think this old man can’t guess what your intentions are? Do you think you can provoke this old man to do your bidding? If this old man does compete with you, do you want to compete with this old man in refining the Soul Source Restoration Pill!?” Zuo De sneered at Yang Kai.

“Well, Grandmaster is indeed wise, this Yang was indeed going to propose this,” Yang Kai said in surprise.

In a flash, everyone immediately realized what Yang Kai was doing.

If Zuo De really competed with Yang Kai in Alchemy out of anger, then Yang Kai had intended to set the goal of the competition to refine the Soul Source Restoration Pill.

And in order to win, Zuo De would go all out to make it successful.

This way, Gu Bi Hu’s crisis and President Ai Ou’s pressing matter would be resolved.

As for whether Yang Kai could refine it or not... who cared about him?

It wasn’t a shame to lose to an Origin King Grade Alchemist in Alchemy.

But if he lost to an Alchemist in a fight, then it would be really shameful!

“What a joke!? This old man won’t be fooled by your paltry tricks!” Zuo De let out a cold snort as he looked at Yang Kai with disdain. His expression gave the impression that he had seen through everything of Yang Kai.

“Grandmaster is treating me unjustly by saying that.” Yang Kai smiled slightly. “Let’s do it this way, how about this Yang up the stakes to make this competition fair?”

“What are the stakes!?” Zuo De asked in a cold tone.

“If I lose, I will be your bodyguard for a thousand years!” Yang Kai quickly added with an honest look on his face.

“What!?” Everyone was greatly shocked upon hearing this. They looked at Yang Kai as if they were looking at a fool. Even Zuo De seemed to be tempted.

He might be an Origin King Grade Alchemist and he might have many masters among his subordinates, but none of them was an Origin King Realm master!

All the Origin King Realm masters were proud and arrogant. They might act all polite when they asked him to refine pills but how could they let themselves be ordered and enslaved by him?

Not to mention, Yang Kai wasn’t an ordinary Origin King, he was a Second-Order Origin King!

There weren’t that many Second-Order Origin Kings in the entire Star Field!
