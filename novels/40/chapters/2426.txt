Bing Yun’s pupils shrank as she immediately asked, “Is her Life Lamp still burning?”

An Ruo Yun replied, “Yes, so we know Third Junior Sister is still alive; however, we don’t know where.”

“Good,” Bing Yun breathed a sigh of relief.

An Ruo Yun continued, “Fifth Junior Sister… she fell while trying to break through to the Emperor Realm.”

Bing Yun’s tender body trembled a little upon hearing this; however, she regained her calm soon and stated with a sigh, “That is also fate. Little Fifth always had a hurried temperament. I knew that her future would not be smooth.”

An Ruo Yun’s eyes reddened as she blamed herself, “As her Senior Sister, I didn’t take care of her well enough.”

Bing Yun shook her head and comforted, “It has nothing to do with you. What about Little Ninth? Is she… dead or alive?”

An Ruo Yun replied, “Ninth Junior Sister has been in secluded retreat for the past ten years. She said that she won’t exit until she breaks through to the Emperor Realm.”

“Very good,” a slight smile reappeared on Bing Yun’s face. She had left three millennia ago, and among the nine Disciples she had taken in at the time, seven of them had broken through to the Emperor Realm successfully. Among them, An Ruo Yun and Sun Yun Xiu had further lived up to her expectations by reaching the Second-Order Emperor Realm. One of them had already departed and had returned to the Heavens, while the last one, the youngest, Little Ninth, was in a retreat to achieve a breakthrough.

These results were, in truth, spectacular. As a Master, Bing Yun could be the only one in the Star Boundary to achieve such phenomenal results. Who could boast of having so many Disciples break through to the Emperor Realm? One could not help but wonder whether it was her superior mentorship abilities or simply because Ice Heart Valley was an excellent environment for nurturing talent.

“Bing Yun, if you are done reminiscing, can we talk now?” Feng Xuan urged loudly, appearing extremely impatient.

Bing Yun coldly snorted and glanced back at him before snapping, “For these three millennia this Queen has been absent, Sect Master Feng seems to have taken good care of my Ice Heart Valley.”

Her tone carried a strong sarcasm. Obviously, she was very angry about the fact that Seeking Passion Sect bullied her valley while she was away, forcing them to marry their best disciple against her will.

Feng Xuan calmly justified, “You and I represent top Sects in the Northern Territory, so there is no problem with us becoming allies! This King doesn’t think that there is anything wrong with this. Why are you being narrow-minded?”

“Am I narrow-minded or is Sect Master Feng too proud of himself?” Bing Yun replied in a light tone, “You can be considered a Senior Master, yet you feel gratified bullying a few little girls?”

Feng Xuan furrowed his brow and rebuked, “Bing Yun, your tongue is as sharp as ever. This King isn’t going to argue with you! Today, this King is here for two things, one is to let my son marry Zi Yu, and the other is to take back the Blood Jade Qilin! Bing Yun, please cooperate in these matters for the sake of our old friendship!”

Bing Yun coldly smiled as she raised her jade finger and quickly spoke, “Let this Queen make it clear to you. First, Zi Yu is my Ice Heart Valley’s top disciple, I will never let her marry your waste of a son, so perish this thought entirely. Second, I have no opinion about your Blood Jade Qilin, if you want it back, take it yourself, and if you can’t, then scram out of Ice Moon City as soon as possible, lest you lose face in front of the heroes of the Northern Territory and find it difficult to even show yourself in public again!”

Bing Yun taking an unyielding stance caught Feng Xuan by surprise.

Hu Yun and the others were even more terrified as they felt a faint oppression fill the air, like mountains were pressing down on them.

It seemed these two Masters had reached an impasse, and by the looks of it, a fight might break out. Once that happened, Ice Moon City would definitely be wiped from existence and who knows whether anyone could retreat safely. A fire at the city gates always brings disaster to the fish in the moat, so many were now considering whether they should take this opportunity to leave, lest they became those very fish

Feng Xuan sunk into a long silence before he pursed his lips into a sarcastic smile and stated, “This boy is not your illegitimate child is he? Is that why you are defending him so staunchly?”

Once he said this, An Ruo Yun and the others had a sharp change in their expressions. A Master of Feng Xuan’s stature was actually trying to soil Bing Yun’s reputation in front of so many people with such slanderous lies! Clearly he had ulterior, wicked motives here.

All of a sudden, the Ice Heart Valley Elders all became infuriated, grinding their teeth as they glared at Feng Xuan, wishing they could pounce at him and bite him to death.

To everyone’s surprise, however, Bing Yun didn’t seem to be angered in the slightest. On the contrary, she looked at Yang Kai with profound meaning and calmly stated, “If this Queen could have such an heir, then I would have no regrets in life.”

Feng Xuan was immediately dumbfounded.

An Ruo Yun and the others were jaw slacked, gawking at their Master in shock.

What did she mean by this? Was she secretly admitting it was true? This young man wouldn’t really happen to be Bing Yun’s bastard son? If that wasn’t the case, why didn’t she get angry and even go so far as to say such words?

For a moment, everyone’s gaze turned a little different when they looked at Yang Kai, as if he was now bearing the brand of Ice Heart Valley. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Yang Kai couldn’t help breaking out into a cold sweat as he bitterly looked at Bing Yun and stammered, “Senior, if you put it in this way, others might misunderstand.”

Bing Yun smiled and replied, “I just spoke thoughtlessly, don’t take it to heart.”

She didn’t mean to deliberately take advantage of Yang Kai; however, she knew that Feng Xuan was simply trying to anger her, destabilizing her mood to gain an advantage. As such, she simply chose the best option to maintain her calm.

“It seems that this brat is deeply related to you!” Feng Xuan immediately realized that the relationship between Bing Yun and Yang Kai was a bit unusual. Otherwise, Bing Yun wouldn’t ignore her reputation and say something like this.

“But even if he is really your illegitimate child, the Blood Jade Qilin must be handed to me today. Otherwise, don’t blame this King for being ruthless!” Feng Xuan sternly shouted as he suddenly took a step forward.

The entire world quaked with this step, as if it was surrendering to him.

The residents of Ice Moon City felt even more suffocated now as the pressure around them increased noticeably.

Yang Kai’s face turned slightly pale as he held the Blood Jade Qilin up high and shouted frantically, “This Young Master is quite timid! Senior Feng Xuan, please don’t frighten me! If this Young Master were to panic, he might just destroy this thing in his hand.”

Everyone was rendered speechless after hearing this, secretly thinking in their hearts, [Boy, if you can be considered timid, then there isn’t anyone in the world who can be considered courageous!]

While speaking, Yang Kai pushed his Source Qi and suddenly, a slight cracking sound came from the Blood Jade Qilin.

Seeing this, Feng Xi’s eyes bulged in shock as he cried in shock, “Father, he really intends to ruin the Blood Jade Qilin!”

“Stop!” Feng Xuan also sternly shouted, “If you dare to destroy it, I will let you know the meaning of a death without a burial!”

Yang Kai shouted, “Aiya, aiya, this Young Master just said he was extremely timid! Why is Senior scaring me so? I’m so afraid to die!”

While speaking, he pushed his Source Qi harder, causing many more cracks to sound from the Blood Jade Qilin.

Feng Xuan’s breath stopped at the sight of this and his face turned blue.

The Blood Jade Qilin wasn’t a treasure of any kind, or even that valuable; however, it was indeed the status symbol of the Seeking Passion Sect Young Sect Master’s wife. Because every generation of Seeking Passion Sect Young Sect Master would have many wives and concubines, only the one holding the Blood Jade Qilin could be considered his legitimate wife. This woman would take care of the harem on behalf of the Young Sect Master, so that the Young Sect Master would cultivate in peace and not be affected by his women’s internal troubles.

If such a symbol was destroyed before everyone’s eyes, it would be tantamount to a slap right across Seeking Passion Sect’s face.

Seeing that intimidation wasn’t working, Feng Xuan had no choice but to take a deep breath and withdraw his aura. He then said with an extremely unsightly look on his face, “Boy, what do you want?”

Yang Kai replied, snorting, “I have already given you the conditions. Why would Senior Feng knowingly ask me again?”

“You still dare to ask for a billion Mid-Rank Source Crystals!?” Feng Xuan angrily snapped. A billion Source Crystals might be nothing to Seeking Passion Sect, but if he gave in to Yang Kai’s blackmail here, Feng Xuan would be extremely disgraced.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and asked, “Then how much does Senior think he can pay?”

“At most a hundred million! Boy, don’t try to reach out for a yard after taking an inch!” Feng Xuan snorted and replied.

“Alright, a hundred million then, this Young Master is a very easy-going person!” Yang Kai pursed his lips into a smile.

Everyone was stunned by his reaction. They had never expected for Yang Kai to actually agree; after all, he had tried to take the lion’s share just now. Furthermore, he was completely lawless and unafraid before, so everyone thought that he would definitely blackmail Seeking Passion Sect into giving him the full billion Source Crystals. Inferring from how much importance Feng Xuan attached to the Blood Jade Qilin, as long as Yang Kai insisted, he could easily get his hands on a billion Source Crystals. No one had expected him to compromise without even bargaining.

Was he scared? Young people are always hot-blooded, but they do tend to calm down when they become frightened.

However, a mere Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator actually dared to blackmail the Seeking Passion Sect’s Sect Master for a hundred million Source Crystals. No one knew if there would be such an occurrence in the future, but it was surely a first in history.

“Senior Bing Yun, can I trouble you a little?” Yang Kai suddenly asked, turning her head and looking back at Bing Yun.

Bing Yun had no idea what scheme he was cooking up this time, so she suspiciously asked, “What do you want me to do?”

Yang Kai took the Blood Jade Qilin in his hand and replied while making a slicing motion, “Senior Feng Xuan is only willing to pay a tenth of the price I asked, so obviously I can only give him a tenth of this item. Senior, can you cut this thing down by one-tenth. All business has to be fair and just, never taking advantage of others nor allowing them to take advantage of us!”

Bin Yun was secretly amused by this as only Yang Kai could come up with such a wicked idea. However, in public she quietly glared at him before summoning a sword as white as snow into her hand, appearing as if she was about to cut a piece off the Blood Jade Qilin.

Yang Kai looked up at Feng Xuan and asked with a cold smile, “Senior, I wonder whether you are satisfied with this?”

Infuriated, Feng Xuan almost spurted blood. Before he could say anything, Yang Kai added, “If Senior can come up with five hundred million, then I will ask Senior Bing Yun to cut this in half. How much Senior can get will depend on how many Source Crystals he can offer. I am very fair, so… how much of it do you want?”

Feng Xuan’s blood boiled with rage as he almost gasped for breath.

He felt that he had never been so infuriated in his entire life, andthe all of this was thanks to the little bastard before him!

Hu Yuan and the others were secretly growing apprehensive as they worried in their hearts, [This young man is truly cruel. He is still insisting on stealing a billion Source Crystals from Feng Xuan. If he really cuts a tenth, or even a half off of it, will this Blood Jade Qilin still hold any meaning?]

However… by offending Seeking Passion Sect like this, Yang Kai would surely pay a terrible price! He would not be able to survive unless he really was Bing Yun’s illegitimate son!
