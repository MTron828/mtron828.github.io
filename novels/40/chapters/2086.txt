After a short moment, Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang’s communication artifacts rang simultaneously.

Sending his Divine Sense into his artifact, Yang Kai immediately received Duan Yuan Shan’s message. “I’ll leave this to you two!”

Raising his eyes, Yang Kai looked at the helpless expression appearing on Qin Zhao Yang’s face.

“Since the City Lord has spoken, you two can begin.” Although Qin Zhao Yang was still filled with anxiety, he couldn’t argue against their decision any further. Therefore, the only thing he could do was to keep his worries in his heart and look ahead, thinking about how he could use the situation to squeeze out more benefits from the City Lord!

After all, Qin Yu was a descendant whom he held with exceedingly high importance. Having the Fated Fortune Heavenly Pupil allowed her to utilise the Soul Search Secret Technique despite her Second-Order Origin Return Realm cultivation, but the risk was high.

“Brother Yang, I entrust Yu’er to your care,” Qin Zhao Yang said in a sincere and solemn tone, as though he was about to marry Qin Yu off to Yang Kai.

Cupping his fist, Yang Kai replied, “Rest assured, Old Sir Qin. I will definitely do my utmost to collaborate with Sister Qin!”

“Senior Yang, please follow me,” Qin Yu waved her hand, flying in a certain direction.

Extending his hand, Yang Kai hoisted Jiang Chu He up before following behind Qin Yu.

The few Origin King Realm cultivators that were in charge of Qin Yu’s safety also followed suit.

Earlier, Jiang Chu He had one of his arms severed by Yang Kai outside of the city. However, instead of blood, a jet-black aura was surging out from the severed stump; it was an extremely weird sight to behold.

After a short flight, the group arrived at the Qin Family’s main residence.

With the current crisis that had befallen Maplewood City, all of the Qin Family’s cultivators at the Origin Returning Realm and higher had already left for the city walls to aid in the defence. Therefore, the majority of the Qin Family members left in the residence either had low cultivation realms or were young.

Upon seeing Qin Yu return, each one of them started to gather impatiently around her, clamouring about as they continued to shoot question after question about the current situation on the outside.

Qin Yu didn’t have the patience to deal with them right now. Summoning the aura of an Elder Sister, she reprimanded all of them, causing them to no longer dare to talk back to her.

However, they gathered around once again after seeing Jiang Chu He, who was being carried by Yang Kai, staring in curiosity.

“ARGGGGH!” All of a sudden, Jiang Chu He roared out. Opening his mouth wide, he radiated pure madness, scaring those Qin Family descendants away. Some scaredy-cats even started to cry as they ran and hid in their rooms.

“I apologize for their disgraceful actions, Senior Yang,” Qin Yu took the lead, walking ahead without looking back.

Yang Kai did not reply as he followed closely behind her.

After a moment, the two of them arrived at the Qin Family’s hidden chamber. Multiple restrictions were layered around the hidden chamber, while the World Energy present within was substantially more dense than other places. Clearly, this was a place for important members of the Qin Family to retreat to.

After arriving, Qin Yu made some seals with her hands, activating the restrictions in the chamber. After that, she turned around to give orders to the few Origin King Realm protectors guarding her. “You few stand guard outside. Before I leave, no one is allowed to enter!”

“Yes!” The guards answered in unison before spreading out to stand guard in the surroundings.

Within the hidden chamber, Qin Yu activated the restrictions once again, before taking some items out from her Space Ring and arranging them within the hidden chamber.

Holding onto Jiang Chu He, Yang Kai stood by the side. After observing for a while, he asked out of curiosity, “So, Sister Qin is proficient in the Dao of Spirit Arrays?”

He discovered that Qin Yu was currently arranging an exceedingly mysterious formation. Although he did not know what use this formation had, he obviously knew that it was related to the Secret Technique she was going to execute.

Furthermore, from the deft movements she made when arranging the formation, Qin Yu’s proficiency in Spirit Arrays was clearly established.

Continuing to arrange the formation, Qin Yu smiled. “Due to this little girl’s incurable disease, I’m unable to go out as frequently as other people. Therefore, I could only spend time at home researching more obscure stuff. I’m not a master of Spirit Arrays, it is just something I’ve done research in.”

“Don’t be so modest, Sister Qin,” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes. “From what I can see, your achievements in the Dao of Spirit Arrays might have already reached a rather high realm.”

Qin Yu gave a smile and replied, “This Spirit Array will not only strengthen the Secret Technique I’m going to display, but it can also allow the strength of Senior Yang’s Divine Sense to temporarily be grafted onto my body. With this, I’m able to display the Soul Searching Technique with the utmost confidence.

“Grafting my Divine Sense?” Yang Kai’s expression changed slightly, “There is such a mysterious Spirit Array in the universe?”

One had to know that it was exceedingly hard for cultivators to cultivate their Divine Sense, and thus much harder for it to reach the same realm as their cultivation. If not for obtaining a precious treasure, the Soul Warming Lotus, early in his life, he would not be able to reach such a realm in his short lifespan.

He would have undoubtedly needed to spend a large amount of time to temper his Divine Sense.

The Soul Warming Lotus’ benefits allowed him to save a large amount of effort.

However, the formation that Qin Yu was arranging was actually able to allow a cultivator to graft their Divine Sense to another cultivator! This was somewhat unimaginable.

If such a Spirit Array could be used in combat, it would definitely allow one to fight across cultivation realms! With a Divine Sense pressure radiating, one could easily defeat their opponent despite the disparity in cultivation realms.

“Although this formation is miraculous, it isn’t as magical as what Senior Yang thinks. This was a half-complete formation I discovered from an ancient book, which I then restored using my own knowledge. When the Spirit Array is active, it cannot receive powerful interference from the outside, as it will fail. Therefore, it is only suitable for some special scenarios, like the one we are facing now, but it’s totally unsuitable for use in combat.” As though she knew what Yang Kai was thinking, Qin Yu gave a reply in a calm manner.

“Restored by yourself...” In his mind, Yang Kai felt that Qin Yu was basically a genius, and raised his evaluation of her to an even greater height. She wasn’t just extremely proficient in the Dao of Spirit Arrays, she had already become an expert!

“That’s right. Will this Divine Sense grafting reveal my secrets?” Yang Kai continued his questions with some worry in his voice.

There were quite a few secrets he was concealing within his body. Although his observations of Qin Yu made him have a pretty good impression of her, in the end, Yang Kai was not very familiar with her, and thus, naturally did not wish for her to know his secrets.

“There is a possibility!” Hearing his question, Qin Yu’s actions came to a slight halt as she replied.

“Oh?” Yang Kai’s face turned black, as thoughts of wanting to pull out immediately appeared in his mind.

Qin Yu hastily added, “But rest assured, Senior Yang. Although there’s a risk of one’s secrets being revealed, that would happen for the side with the weaker Divine Sense... Sir’s Divine Sense is much stronger, so I will not be able to pry into Sir’s secrets after the Divine Sense graft. On the contrary, you sir...”

Having said this much, her face turned slightly flushed.

After all, she was a lady while Yang Kai was a man. Some of her secrets that Yang Kai might involuntarily discover might place him in an awkward and apologetic position.

Yang Kai hastily replied: “You don’t have to worry, Sister Qin. This Yang will definitely adhere strictly to myself and not pry into anything else.

He said those words with a resounding voice and a stern look.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything as she continued to focus on arranging the formation.

After a while, the formation within the hidden chamber was finished.

Looking at it, Yang Kai discovered that this Spirit Array Formation was incomparably mysterious, and it seemed like he had never encountered such a formation before. He couldn’t help but develop a huge curiosity for it, memorising these formation lines for potential future use.

Leaping forward, Qin Yu placed herself in the middle of the Spirit Array. Making a seal with her hands, she slowly sat down. “Sir, please place yourself and the demon at the two extreme positions.”

Nodding, Yang Kai extended his hand to pat on Jiang Chu He’s back, sending his Source Qi into the latter’s body. At the same time, he unleashed his Space Force, transforming it into invisible bindings that chained Jiang Chu He to a specific position in the formation.

After that, Yang Kai appeared at the opposing position with a flash.

Although his cultivation realm and movements had been sealed, Jiang Chu He was still acting extremely unruly, roaring continuously as the Demon Crests on his body squirmed and wriggled, while Demon Qi surged out from him. Nevertheless, no matter how hard he struggled, he was still unable to move even an inch.

Seeing that, Qin Yu managed to calm down. She proceeded to form seal after seal with her hands, her slender hands appearing just like a butterfly fluttering in the air.

Following her movements, waves of mysterious power started to propagate out from her in all directions. Invisible and incorporeal, they were unfathomable.

A faint fluorescence started to radiate from the formation. As though they had been granted life, all of the lines that created the Spirit Array started to flow like living creatures.

“Formation Open!” All of a sudden, Qin Yu shouted.

As her voice rang out, a hum rang out from the formation, before it promptly started to spin rapidly.

In an instant, radiance blossomed throughout the hidden chamber, so bright that it would make people squeeze their eyes shut. While that happened, an invisible power travelled in a rope-like manner and pierced through Yang Kai’s body.

An indescribably strange feeling immediately rose up within Yang Kai’s body.

He felt as though he was connected with Qin Yu as one being, able to clearly feel every inhalation and exhalation she made, feel the blood circulating within her body, the beats of her heart, the contraction of her pores, and was even able to vaguely sense the changes happening to her state of mind.

Qin Yu revealed a sliver of an exceedingly uncomfortable expression, while her face turned slightly flushed. Opening her mouth, she shouted out: “Sir, please display your ocular technique and suppress that person’s soul!”

She knew that Yang Kai had that kind of Secret Technique in his arsenal, and that was precisely what she had asked him earlier.

After all, during that day when Yang Kai was promoting his cultivation, she had used her Fated Fortune Heavenly Pupil from a far distance to observe the spectacle. In the end, she managed to get countered by Yang Kai’s Demon Eye of Annihilation, which led to her making such a guess.

After asking about it today, she had indeed hit the bullseye. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

With the suppression from Yang Kai’s ocular technique, she basically did not need Qin Zhao Yang’s help at all, as Yang Kai alone was sufficient.

Hearing Qin Yu’s shout, Yang Kai immediately executed his Demon Eye of Annihilation.

In an instant, golden light blossomed from his left eye, revealing its awe-inspiring might as it shot right at Jiang Chu He.

At the instant it made contact with the suppressed Jiang Chu He, he immediately cried out as though he had suffered a serious blow. Right in the next moment, his body entered combat mode, and as though he was experiencing a nightmare, his sinister expression grew even more malevolent.

After a moment, Jiang Chu He’s eyes turned unfocused, causing him to stare ahead with blank eyes, while a string of saliva flowed out from the corner of his mouth, as though he had lost consciousness.

Despite being transformed into a demon, Jiang Chu He was being suppressed by the Divine Sense comparable to that of a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master, and his strength paled in comparison. As a result, it took only a few breaths for the Demon Eye of Annihilation to completely suppress his soul.

Seeing this, Qin Yu smiled happily. Closing her eyes, she took a deep breath before promptly reopening them.

Silver light sparkled within her eyes, causing the entire hidden chamber to be suffused with a silvery-white glow.

As the Spirit Array hummed, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense flowed along with the strength of the Spirit Array without any impedance and grafted onto Qin Yu’s body, before circulating into Jiang Chu He’s Knowledge Sea.

In the next instant, darkness appeared before Qin Yu and Yang Kai’s eyes as they simultaneously entered a secret world.
