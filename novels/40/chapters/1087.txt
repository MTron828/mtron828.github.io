Although Yang Kai was still young, he could still be considered a veteran flower purveyor. From a woman’s demeanour and words, he could infer what that woman’s personality was, whether her nature was charming, seductive, cold, elegant, passionate...

When he first saw this young woman, he had thought she belonged to the seductive category. Generally, a woman with such beguiling eyes was one who wasn’t willing to remain lonely and often engaged in promiscuous behaviour.

So at the beginning, he hadn’t dared to approach this woman to avoid any kind of unwanted entanglement.

However, after slowly becoming familiar with her, Yang Kai discovered that this woman named Luo Yao had a very different personality than he originally thought. She was quite unlike Purple Star’s Bi Ya and had a noble air beneath her flirtatious appearance while her personality was calm and solemn.

This contradictory combination of appearance and demeanour created an unusually powerful appeal and Yang Kai had repeatedly found the slender man often staring at Luo Yao’s gently swaying bottom and willow-like waist, often forgetting to even blink.

Even Gui Che, when distributing the spoils from victories, would deliberately allocate more to her.

Gan Ji, a man who gave off the impression of a stalwart warrior, also paid a lot of attention to Luo Yao during each battle to protect her safety.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Luo Yao had it easiest amongst this group of people.

“Little brother, do you have something to ask? If you do, just speak up,” Luo Yao as cleaned her face before turning a slightly meaningful smile to Yang Kai, obviously having seen through his intentions in approaching her.

“I just want to know, what are you guys looking for here? How did you find that Space Array?” Yang Kai made a clean break when he saw her see through his act.

The place where the two spoke was not too far from the other three, and if Gui Che and the others wanted to hide this information, they would naturally be able to step in.

But when Yang Kai asked this question, all three of these men maintained a state of meditation, which meant they didn’t care whether their purpose was exposed or not, emboldening Yang Kai significantly.

Hiding his strength and feigning weakness all this time had finally paid off, allowing this group of people to lower their guard towards Yang Kai.

“We’re looking for a place to temper our bodies,” Luo Yao replied succinctly, a faint glow appearing in the depths of her beautiful eyes, “As long as we can find that place, we can improve the strength of our physical bodies. Although you’re an Alchemist, you are also a cultivator; you should know the benefits of having greater physical strength, yes?”

Yang Kai nodded, of course he knew the advantages of having an intrepid physique, far more so than these four at least.

Without his unusually strong physique, Yang Kai would not have been able to store and utilize so much Saint Qi, nor would he be able to fight opponents above his realm so easily. A solid body was the foundation of a cultivator, no matter how profound a cultivator’s Secret Art or Martial Skills were, or how potent their Saint Qi was, if their physical body couldn’t withstand the impact of using these attributes, they would remain mediocre at best.

“Where is this place that allows you to quench your flesh?” Yang Kai couldn’t help wondering.

“I don’t know,” Luo Yao shook her head, “This is the first time we have come here. You should have heard Gui Che that day; no one has entered this place for many years. The only reason we were able to find this place at all was that Ji Peng’s ancestor left a map behind in an ancient record we accidentally found.”

“Ancient records?” Yang Kai frowned.

“My ancestor has been here before,” The tall man named Ji Peng also completely his meditation and walked over to the lake to join the conversation, “He obtained many benefits from this place and left some clues behind when he passed on. By following those clues I was able to find the Space Array hidden inside that Asteroid Sea!”

Luo Yao chuckled and looked back towards Yang Kai to say, “Boy, don’t think it was easy to find that Space Array. You also stepped through it so you should know that the Space Array itself was built atop a great asteroid, one that no doubt drifts about randomly with the Asteroid Sea, constantly changing direction. If one isn’t careful, they might pass right by it and never notice. Fortunately, Ji Peng’s ancestor was able to calculate approximately where and when the asteroid upon which the Space Array was built would appear, and as long as we conducted a thorough search of that region, we would be able to find it. Even so, it took us nearly an entire year before we finally found it. The problem is that Di Ji; I don’t know where they got wind of this news, but after they did they began relentlessly pursuing us, causing a lot of our comrades to die.”

“We will get our revenge for this in the future!” Ji Peng coldly snorted, his thin face filled with ruthlessness as he turned unceremoniously to Yang Kai, “Little brat, we’re only letting you hear all this because you’ve been quite obedient this whole time, and as long as you continue to be so, when we find that place, naturally you’ll get a share of the benefits.”

“En, I know my place,” Yang Kai responded sincerely. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After half an hour, everyone was fully restored and Ji Peng continued to study the animal skin drawing while giving out directions to everyone. No real dangers appeared along the way.

One day, as Gui Che was leading the way, he suddenly stopped and stared towards the front with a dignified expression.

A couple of dozen kilometres or so in front of him was a vast expanse of yellow sand with a storm whipping about that blotted out the sky, creating a barren landscape seemingly devoid of any vitality.

An inexplicable yet dangerous aura pulsed from this land, and when Gui Che and the others released their Divine Senses to investigate, they were surprised to discover that they could not explore into this region, as if the yellow sand storm was somehow blocking their Divine Senses.

Gui Che turned his eyes to Yang Kai and motioned for him to check it out.

Without saying a word, Yang Kai nodded and proceeded cautiously towards the yellow sand storm.

After a short while, he came to the edge of the yellow sand storm, circulated his strength to guard his body, then stepped inside.

The flying yellow sand was like a million tiny blades that banged into and cut at Yang Kai, giving him a rough beating even though he was protecting himself with his Saint Qi. Yang Kai managed to keep his eyes open to survey his surroundings, but he could barely see a meter in front of his face.

Gui Che and his group had noticed the danger of this place, so how could Yang Kai not have detected it?

Yang Kai then released his Divine Sense enhanced with his comprehension of the Dao of space to leaping quickly cover the surrounding region. Yang Kai quickly learned everything about this place, including how it stretched out roughly thirty kilometres in every direction and was filled with Earth and Wind Attribute Energy.

These two energies wove together to form a large airtight net, blocking Gui Che and his group’s Divine Senses.

Yang Kai thought this was a natural phenomenon, but when a fierce aura suddenly approached him from a certain direction, he realized he was wrong.

There was a powerful aura that pulsed with malicious intent hidden inside this world of yellow sand which clearly belonged to a living creature.

Yang Kai stood motionless as he stared with widened eyes in the direction of the aura’s source, trying to determine what it was that was moving towards him.

The earth began to tremble as the fierce aura drew closer and closer to himself. At the same time, Yang Kai smelt a stench that nearly made him faint.

Yang Kai couldn’t see anything clearly and was only able to notice that the earth was constantly subsiding as more and more yellow sand was kicked up and swept into the air by the strong winds, blurring his vision even further.

Silently, two huge pincers stretched out towards Yang Kai’s head. As these pincers opened and closed, they seemed like they were slicing through space, causing a sense of crisis to well up in his heart and prompting Yang Kai to quickly withdraw. The moment he left the yellow sandstorm, Yang Kai saw two scarlet eyes staring at him from within.

An invisible pressure came from inside the sandstorm, making it difficult for Yang Kai to even breath.

His Wind and Thunder Wings opening, Yang Kai’s speed increased to its maximum in an instant and he flew out a dozen kilometres in an instant. A pair of purple pincers passed through the spot Yang Kai was originally at, slicing apart his afterimage.

Cold sweat dripped from Yang Kai’s forehead as he flew over to Gui Che and the others without looking back.

A moment later, he arrived in front of Gui Che with a completely pale face.

“What did you find?” Gui Che hurriedly asked, with Gan Ji, Luo Yao, and Ji Peng also staring at him expectantly.

“An ominous beast!” Yang Kai frowned, “It can resist the power of the wind and earth, has two large pincers, and crimson red eyes. It also looked like it had a barbed tail and could perfectly camouflage itself in the sandstorm. Even if one was standing right next to it, it would be difficult to discover, it’s clearly very dangerous.”

“Was the surface of its body purple?” Gui Che expression changed, asking urgently.

Yang Kai thought for a while and nodded, “Yes, just as I left, it’s pincers emerged from the sandstorm and they were indeed purple. Do you know what it is?”

The other three also turned expectant eyes towards Gui Che.

Gui Che suddenly grinned and put on a smug look, “Scarlet Tailed Purple Armoured Scorpion, have you heard of it?”

Hearing this name, the faces of the other three lit up and excited light flashed across their eyes.

Gan Ji even yelled, “Seriously? Is it really a Scarlet Tailed Purple Armoured Scorpion?”

“From what Yang Kai saw, plus my own judgment, it should be a Scarlet Tailed Purple Armoured Scorpion. En, we’ve finally found something good! Hahaha, even if we can’t find that body tempering place now, as long as we kill that Scarlet Tailed Purple Armoured Scorpion, this trip will have been worthwhile,” Gui Che laughed.

“But the Scarlet Tailed Purple Armoured Scorpion is a Ninth-Order Monster Beast, equivalent to an Origin Returning Realm master. Can the few of us really kill it?” Luo Yao’s peach blossom eyes flashed with concern.

“There shouldn’t be a problem,” Gan Ji thought for a while before responding confidently, “Monster Beasts are just Monster Beasts in the end, moreover, after having lived in this place for so long, it probably has very limited fighting experience. If it can only move against us on instinct, we can definitely take it down.”

“Fair enough,” Ji Peng didn’t have an opinion, an eager look appearing on his face.

“Is that Monster Beast valuable?” Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

Gui Che grinned, “More so than a low-level Tenth-Order Monster Beast at least! Most Monster Beasts don’t have anything of value on them besides their Monster Cores. Although sometimes a beast’s claws, teeth, or skin have some use, their value is still quite limited, but this Scarlet Tailed Purple Armoured Scorpion is completely different. Whether it is its carapace, tail, or pincers, they can all be used to refine artifacts, and those artifacts will definitely be at least Origin Grade, its blood and poison are also useful for Alchemy and its Monster Core can allow a cultivator to improve their strength, its whole body is a treasure! The most valuable item though is its Monster Core, because it is a Monster Beast that wields two different yet perfectly fused attributes. If a cultivator can refine its core, they will be able to gain insight into both the Wind and Earth Attributes, very likely allowing them to comprehend a more profound type of strength; do you think it’s valuable now?”

After hearing all that, even Yang Kai became interested.
