Sang De grinned meaningfully, “That old man passed away five years ago, why would he have any problems?” Speaking up to this point, his face suddenly twisted up, “Even though that old thing is dead, he didn’t even pass down that thing to me, so I can only go and get it myself.”

Yang Kai was stunned at his words. Looking at Sang De’s expression, it seemed he did not get along too well with his Master. Who knows what sort of grudges existed between the two of them.

“This Old Master has been preparing for five years and has been looking for candidates like you. Today, I finally have all the necessary personnel. As long as Little Brother nods his head and places his trust in this Old Master, this Old Master guarantees to take you out of the Solitary Void Sealed World!” Sang De looked at Yang Kai with an excited face.

“I don’t have a choice, do I?” Yang Kai grinned meaningfully.

Sang De said subtly, “Even though this Old Master does not leave his home, refining Artifacts for over nine hundred years on Clear Sky Island, this Old Master has made many friends, and many also owe favours to this Old Master, so you best think about this carefully, Little Brother.”

Even though Sang De spoke vaguely, Yang Kai was not a fool; how could he not be able to tell that this old man was threatening him? Sang De saying that he has many friends and even has a lot of people who owed him favours was his not so subtle way of saying that if Yang Kai refused his offer, he could make use of these connections to make life on Clear Sky City hell for Yang Kai in the future.

“Fix my Spirit Purifying Array first. I still have to think about it.” Yang Kai pointed to the Artifact Refining Furnace. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Of course, of course,” Sang De smiled. This time, he didn’t say anything more and instead began making seals with his hands to control the furnace’s flames, beginning repairs on the Spirit Purifying Array.

Yang Kai sat there cross-legged with a frown between his brow, seemingly considering the feasibility of Sang De’s proposal. But in reality, he was watching how this man was refining, just in case he engaged in any mischief with the Spirit Purifying Array.

Sure enough, Sang De was worthy of his title as an Artifact Refining Grandmaster. Yang Kai just saw him toss a bunch of different materials into the Artifact Refining Furnace while constantly forming different hand seals, drawing Spirit Arrays within the Artifact Refining Furnace. A humming sound was occasionally emitted from the huge Artifact Refining Furnace.

Yang Kai himself was an alchemist, so even though he had never been exposed to the Dao of Artifact Refining, there were many similarities between the two, such as the input of materials, the control of fire, Spirit Array inscription, etc. So, even though he didn’t understand too much about it, he knew Sang De wasn’t doing a perfunctory job. Rather, he was really helping him repair the Spirit Purifying Array.

A full hour later, Sang De suddenly withdrew his hands and the flames in the Artifact Refining Furnace also gradually began to weaken. After it reached a certain point, Sang De suddenly patted his Artifact Refining Surface.

Lifting his hand, the Artifact Refining Furnace’s cover flew open and the artifact flags and the base popped out from within, landing in Sang De’s hands. Looking over, Yang Kai found that the Spirit Purifying Array had been restored to its original state, and even seemed to have greater spirituality than when Ling Yin Qin first lent it to him. In other words, this Spirit Purifying Array set was definitely better than before.

Sang De smiled, “Little Brother, the Spirit Purifying Array you brought me must be this Old Master’s work from fifty years ago. During the past fifty years, this Old Master learned a lot and made great progress in the Dao of Artifact Refining, so I made some small changes to your Spirit Purifying Array. But rest assured, it is definitely better than before.”

While speaking, he didn’t hold back and handed the Spirit Purifying Array to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai accepted it and wasn’t worried about him fiddling with the Spirit Purifying Array. After examining it for a little, he tossed it into his Space Ring and cupped his fists, “Many thanks, Grandmaster.”

Sang De said, “Now I wonder, has this Little Brother made his decision?”

“I have.” Yang Kai nodded, “Count me in on this plan.”

Sang De laughed, “Little Brother is a sensible person. This Old Master was right about you.”

Yang Kai coldly snorted, “I just want to get out of here. Even if it wasn’t Grandmaster asking, I would still cooperate.”

“No matter, no matter. In that case, we shall meet in front of the city gates in three days!” Sang De smiled, “This Old Master needs to prepare some things and gather the others. So please, be there on time for our appointment when it comes!”

“I’ll be taking my leave then,” Yang Kai got up and cupped his fists at Sang De.

“By the way, I have not asked. How should I refer to Little Brother?” Sang De suddenly asked.

“Yang Kai!”

There was no need to hide his name here, so Yang Kai just used his real name.

After leaving Sang De’s place, Yang Kai took out the Communication Bead that Jiao Yi gave him before and contacted him. He found out that they had indeed moved to the cave mansions in the Inner City, and they weren’t living too far away from the cave mansion that he and Liu Xian Yun stayed at. So, he agreed to head over later so he could return the repaired Spirit Purifying Array back to Ling Yin Qin.

Walking past a few streets, Yang Kai suddenly paused his steps and looked up at a certain building not far away.

The building looked like a six floored pavilion and was neither big nor small; however, it occupied a large amount of space in the busiest area in the city, so obviously the owner behind this pavilion was definitely not simple.

In fact, the owner of this pavilion truly was not a simple person.

Because this was Ice Heart Pavilion!

Yang Kai knew that Ice Heart Pavilion’s Pavilion Master was a top-level Emperor Realm Master that stood on equal ground with the Clear Sky Island Lord. Only, this Ice Heart Pavilion Master was different from the Clear Sky Island Lord in that the former seemed to only control a single pavilion, while the latter had control of the entire Clear Sky Island.

When Yang Kai first arrived on Clear Sky Island, Ling Yin Qin sold his share of the goods to a beautiful woman called Fan Xin, and that beautiful woman was one of Ice Heart Pavilion’s disciples.

The three words, ‘Ice Heart Pavilion’, reminded Yang Kai of many past events. Sang De also mentioned that besides himself, the Ice Heart Pavilion Master and the Clear Sky Island Lord were also aware of where this Sealed World’s exit was.

It was naturally unrealistic to ask about any information from these two, however, as they were Third-Order Emperors, not characters Yang Kai could casually meet. What’s more, even if he did manage to meet with one of these Masters, it would be impossible for him to pry any information out of them directly.

Yang Kai had the nagging suspicion that Sang De wasn’t a very reliable person and may be plotting some unknown scheme in the background. As they say, you shouldn’t put all your eggs into one basket. Yang Kai figured that he would have to come in contact with the Ice Heart Pavilion Master sooner or later if he intended to leave the Solitary Void Sealed World, so he might as well get started now.

Outside Ice Heart Pavilion was a wooden sign with two lines carved into it. Yang Kai got closer and found that Ice Heart Pavilion was hiring an Alchemist.

‘Senior Alchemist wanted, well-paid position!’

There were only these two lines written on the sign which caused Yang Kai’s eyes to brighten.

The handwriting was elegant and filled with force. There was an inexplicable rhythm hidden within it. It seemed to have been written by a powerful master.

When Yang Kai stopped to look at the wooden sign, a beautiful woman came out of Ice Heart Pavilion and asked, smiling, “Little Brother, are you an Alchemist?”

As he stood motionless in front of the sign, it was naturally easy for others to surmise this.

Yang Kai looked up at those words and their eyes met. The beautiful woman was surprised, “It’s you.”

“Senior Sister Fan!” Yang Kai cupped his fists with a smile.

This beautiful woman was none other than Fan Xin who bought Ling Yin Qin’s goods at the docks.

“Who are you calling Senior Sister?” Fan Xin glared at Yang Kai, “You’re making me sound older for no reason. Since your cultivation is higher than mine, just call me Junior Sister.”

“Junior Sister Fan!” Yang Kai immediately corrected himself.

“What should I call Senior Brother?” Fan Xin asked.

Yang Kai immediately introduced himself, and Fan Xin smiled, “So, it is Senior Brother Yang. So, Senior Brother Yang, you’re an Alchemist?”

“En. I know a thing or two about it.” Yang Kai said humbly.

Fan Xin’s eyes brightened and she eagerly asked, “What grade of Alchemist is Senior Brother Yang?”

“Dao Source Grade!” Yang Kai understated his own abilities; after all, an Emperor Grade Alchemist was an extremely rare existence even in the vast Star Boundary. Sang De was only a Dao Source Grade Senior Artifact Refiner, and he was already well-respected on Clear Sky Island. If he ever did become an Emperor Artifact Refiner, then even the Clear Sky Island Lord would have to show Sang De some courtesy.

“What is the highest grade pill that you can refine?” When Fan Xin heard that Yang Kai was actually a Dao Source Grade Alchemist, she seemed to have become more enthusiastic. Her entire person was leaning closer to Yang Kai, which instantly caused a fragrant scent to waft over, tickling one’s heart and soul.

“Dao Source Grade Mid-Rank. I can occasionally succeed with High-Rank pills, but the chances aren’t high.”

“Would Senior Brother Yang be interested in coming in for a test? If you really can refine a Dao Source Grade Mid-Rank Spirit Pill, our Ice Heart Pavilion will definitely offer you a well-paid position.”

“Sure,” Yang Kai smiled. He came here because he wanted to find a backer; after all, he was new in the city and may encounter some difficulties in the future, so life would be easier for him if he had someone behind him. Secondly, it was naturally so he could meet the Ice Heart Pavilion Master and get acquainted with them.

Fan Xin was overjoyed to see Yang Kai agree so quickly and quickly led him inside.

Yang Kai swept his gaze around and found that this Ice Heart Pavilion seemed to be a place where various materials were sold. The goods placed on the shelves were all sorts of Alchemy, Artifact Refining, and cultivation materials. No finished pills nor artifacts were displayed.

To Yang Kai’s surprise, business in the Ice Heart Pavilion didn’t actually seem that good. There were only a few customers inside who were looking around.

On the other hand, there were a few women dressed similarly to Fan Xin accompanying the customers and introducing the goods to them.

“Does your Ice Heart Pavilion only accept women?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

Fan Xin pursed her lips and smiled, “That’s right, this is a rule set by the Pavilion Master.”

“Then wouldn’t I be breaking those rules?” Yang Kai raised his brows. [The Ice Heart Pavilion Master really is a hidden dragon... one of those who show their tail but never their face. They are either a womanizer or a woman. Else, such a rule would never be set.]

Fan Xin said, “It’s not the same. We’re all Master’s Low Ranked Disciples. If Senior Brother Yang joins the Ice Heart Pavilion, it would just be an employment relationship.”

“So, that’s how it is!” Yang Kai nodded. It didn’t really bother him that much. If they only accepted female disciples, it was naturally impossible for him to join, not to mention, Yang Kai would not join even if given the opportunity.
