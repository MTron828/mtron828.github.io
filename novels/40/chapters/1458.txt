Chapter 1458, Shan Qing Luo’s Experience

“Sister Chen, can I trouble you to comfort her? Her emotions seem to be a bit unstable,” Yang Kai asked, fearing that once Bi Luo restored enough of her strength, she would really slap him. Regardless of the circumstances, allowing himself to get slapped twice for no reason was highly improper.

“En,” Chen Shi Tao responded positively and hurried over before sitting down next to Bi Luo and allowing the latter to lean on her while offering some comforting words. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yang Kai got up and briefly communicated with Mo Yu and Gu Zhen. From talking with these two, Yang Kai learned that after entering the Emperor Garden through the Space Array on floating platforms, the three of them had been split up, but fortunately, they weren’t teleported too far apart so it only took them a short time to regroup.

As for the whereabouts of everyone else, they had no clue.

“So that’s how it is,” After listening to their explanation, Yang Kai gently nodded, not revealing any kind of disappointment on his face. He had originally intended to investigate the situation of Yang Yan and Ye Xi Yun, but since Gu Zhen and Mo Yu were just as lost as he was, Yang Kai could only drop the matter. In any case, with Ye Xi Yun following Yang Yan, the latter should not have run into any danger.

Glancing back at Bi Luo, Yang Kai’s brow twitched involuntarily.

At this moment, Bi Luo had all but buried her head into Chen Shi Tao’s soft mountains and, whether intentionally or unintentionally, she had placed her mouth atop one of the latter’s pointed peaks. Bi Luo’s breathing had become heated as she inhaled Chen Shi Tao scent, causing the latter’s face to flush bright red. Although Chen Shi Tao was definitely embarrassed and uncomfortable, she found it difficult to raise any objections because the other party was still heavily injured.

What’s more, Bi Luo even went so far as to hold Chen Shi Tao’s jade white hand tightly while rubbing and playing with it, as if enjoying a new toy that she had just acquired.

Yang Kai’s face went black.

There was no doubt this woman was Bi Luo. As the saying goes, wolves had the instincts of wolves while dogs had the instincts of dogs! Bi Luo had such inclinations all those years ago, and it seemed that even after thirty years had passed that had not changed. A person’s interests apparently could not be altered so easily.

Seeing Chen Shi Tao growing more and more uncomfortable, Yang Kai could not stand it anymore, walked over to grab Bi Luo’s collar, and yanked her up.

Bi Luo glared fiercely at him, seemingly wanting to snap at him, but before she could her injuries seemed to flare up and she could only cough weakly.

“Sect Master Yang, what do you plan to do next? If you would like, how about accompanying this old master and Elder Mo?” Gu Zhen looked over at Yang Kai and asked sincerely, the dangers inside the Emperor Garden had far exceeded his original estimates. It was not just the numerous barriers and Spirit Array traps which were scattered about, there was also the threat of cultivators from other Cultivation Stars, so having even one more person to work with would increase their chances of survival.

Especially if that person was Yang Kai. Gu Zhen knew about Yang Kai’s phenomenal abilities; while on the surface this boy was just a First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, his performance in the battle just now was enough to shock anyone who witnessed it.

Gu Zhen very much hoped to cooperate with Yang Kai to explore this place.

Yang Kai thought about it for a moment before slowly shaking his head and saying, “Thank you for the invitation, Sect Master Gu, but this Yang will have to politely decline. If it was just me, I’d have no objections to working together, but now...”

Saying so, he glanced over towards Bi Luo.

This woman had just been rescued from the gates of death and was now more a burden than an asset, so how could Yang Kai allow her presence to hamper Gu Zhen and Mo Yu’s progress? On the other hand, Yang Kai couldn’t ignore Bi Luo since he had many things to ask her still.

What’s more, it would not be convenient for outsiders to know about the actions he was about to take.

“Since that’s the case, this old master won’t insist,” Gu Zhen clearly understood Yang Kai’s concerns, so he raised no objections. To be honest, he and Mo Yu were already struggling with just Chen Shi Tao, so if they were to add Bi Luo now, the road ahead would surely become even harder to pass. With a light smile, Gu Zhen said, “This old master is planning to explore around this area for a few more days before heading outside. If Sect Master Yang feels that his strength falls short, this old master encourages him to quit while he is ahead. This old master has heard that there are also many opportunities and benefits outside the Emperor Garden’s main palace.”

“Junior will keep that in mind,” Yang Kai gently nodded before suddenly seeming to remember something and asking, “Right, the three of you have been here for more than ten days, correct? Have you by chance come across a place with an ice road?”

“Ice road?” Gu Zhen and Mo Yu exchanged a glance before slowly shaking their heads, “We haven’t seen such a place.”

“Is that so? En, alright, I was just asking casually,” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

Although they were curious about why Yang Kai was asking about an ice road, neither Gu Zhen nor Mo Yu had any intentions of investigating this matter. The two parties exchanged a few more words with each other before the Clear Sky Sect trio said their goodbyes.

Before leaving, Chen Shi Tao glanced over at Bi Luo with some slight wariness, and after finding that the latter was still staring at her with a bright smile on her face, Chen Shi Tao couldn’t help shivering slightly, apparently having suffered some psychological trauma.

After the three from Clear Sky Sect left and it was only Yang Kai and Bi Luo, he turned towards her with a complicated expression on his face for some time before finally asking, “Can you move?”

“I still need to rest for a while,” Bi Luo said with a pale face.

“Sure. I had some things I wanted to ask you about anyways, so staying here temporarily isn’t a problem.”

Saying so, the two found a corner in the palace to rest while they talked.

Yang Kai was naturally curious why Bi Luo was here, where Shan Qing Luo was, and where the two of them had gone after they left the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land.

Asking these questions one by one, Bi Luo did not try to hide anything and explained briefly.

Her story was actually incredible though. Two or three years after Yang Kai separated from Shan Qing Luo and headed off to Tong Xuan Realm, Shan Qing Luo took Bi Luo to search for his trail.

Although she had heard about where he was going from Yang Kai before, and that as long as she could find a Void Corridor, she could reach that place, even after Shan Qing Luo travelled to various lands and places, she was unable to achieve her wish. She had found several Void Corridors in fact, but none of them led to Tong Xuan Realm, most of them turning out to be unstable or only transmitting a person over short distances.

Three years later, she and Bi Luo returned to Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land. Each generation of Beguiling Demon Queen bore the sad fate of their inherited Poison Widow Body. Shan Qing Luo’s mother and grandmother both had similar lost love experiences, something which was inevitable with this special constitution.

However, Shan Qing Luo was different from them in that her loved one had only gone to a place she was unable to follow instead of dying at her own hands.

One day, feeling nostalgic, Shan Qing Luo had taken Bi Luo to the Spider Mother’s Den. This was the place where she and Yang Kai were held captive by the Seventh-Order Monster Beast Spider Mother. It was there that the two shared a life or death experience and it was also there that they came to know each other. Just prior to that experience, through a series of accidents, Yang Kai had left an indelible mark on her mind.

If Shan Qing Luo wanted to reminisce, there was no better place than here.

Since the Seventh-Order Monster Beast Spider Mother had been killed by Yang Kai, the Spider Mother’s Den had become an abandoned lair. Yet, after arriving, Shan Qing Luo discovered a small hidden altar that seemed to be summoning her. Shan Qing Luo was unable to resist this call and after arriving at the altar cut her wrist and poured her fresh blood onto it.

In an instant, a brilliant light appeared from the altar and engulfed her and Bi Luo.

When she woke up with Bi Luo, Shan Qing Luo suddenly found herself in an entirely different place.

Initially, Shan Qing Luo rejoiced, thinking she had finally come to the higher world Yang Kai had told her about, but her joy was quickly replaced by terror as when she examined her surroundings, she discovered a massive silver spider looming over her. Shan Qing Luo and Bi Luo were nearly scared to death when they saw this spider, and both thought this would be where they died.

However, after careful examination, they discovered that this several hundred-metre-tall silver spider was nothing more than a corpse which had died countless years ago.

But what Shan Qing Luo found even more shocking was the subtle connection she felt with this giant spider, and when she circulated her Secret Art, she discovered that she was actually able to absorb some kind of mysterious power from its body.

This mysterious energy not only changed her Poison Widow Body physique but also greatly improved her aptitude and rapidly increased her cultivation.

If one survives long enough, they will eventually encounter great fortune! As a member of the Beguiling Demon Queen lineage, Shan Qing Luo deeply realized this point and understood that this was her greatest opportunity, so she did not hurry to leave and instead began cultivating in this place.

A few years later, after the giant spider’s corpse crumbled to dust and the mysterious power inside of it had all been absorbed by her, Shan Qing Luo found that her strength had climbed from the Second-Order Saint Realm straight to the First-Order Origin Returning Realm!

Bi Luo had also obtained many gains from this place. Although she could not absorb the mysterious energy from the spider’s body like Shan Qing Luo, the ambient energy was of great benefit to her.

At this point, the two women left from the strange place they had arrived at.

After some inquiries, the pair realized they had entered the Star Field and were currently on a certain Cultivation Star.

The Monster Emperor Star!

On this Cultivation Star, ninety percent of the sentient inhabitants were Monster Beasts or belonged to the Monster Race. This Cultivation Star was enormous, however, so there were also some Human and Demon Race cultivators around, but their numbers were scarce and their living environments were also quite bad; after all, Monster Emperor Star was ruled by the Monster Race.

After the master-servant pair spent a period exploring Monster Emperor Star, they coincidentally encountered an opportunity, Shan Qing Luo had been discovered by Chi Yue, one of the Ten Great Tribal Lords, and was taken in as her adopted daughter, granting her and Bi Luo status and a stable residence. As one of the Ten Great Tribal Lords on Monster Emperor Star, Chi Yue was naturally an Origin King Realm master, so as her adopted daughter, Shan Qing Luo’s position could be described as below one, above all others.

After listening to Bi Luo’s story, Yang Kai was dumbfounded.

He had many encounters and experiences over the years, but never had he expected Shan Qing Luo and Bi Luo’s experiences to be no less astonishing than his own; however, their luck was undoubtedly better than his. Over the past decades, Yang Kai had faced many life or death dangers.

He had entered the Star Field step by step through Tong Xuan Realm as a stepping stone.

Meanwhile, Shan Qing Luo had made the same trip in a single leap by passing through that strange altar to reach the Star Field.

“That Chi Yue is not only an Origin King Realm master but also one of the Ten Great Tribal Lords... Why would she suddenly take a liking to Qing Luo, even going so far as to accept her as her adopted daughter?” Yang Kai asked curiously; after all, Chi Yue belonged to the Monster Race while Shan Qing Luo was human, normally the two different races were at odds with one another.

Yang Kai could not help thinking that Chi Yu had some kind of hidden intention.
