While Yang Xiao and Blood Crow were secretly communicating, Yang Kai broke one of the Four Symbols Formation formed by the four Territory Lords with his spear.

After engaging in a fierce battle, although both Yang Kai and Mo Na Ye were dead tired, a starving camel was still bigger than a horse. In any case, he was a Divine Dragon, and a Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so how could four mere Territory Lords resist him?

In addition, Yang Kai’s infamy also made the Territory Lords extremely fearful. Seeing Yang Kai charging towards them, whether it was the Territory Lords or Xiao You, who was fighting Ou Yang Lie, all of them became fearful.

Under such circumstances, how could a Four Symbols Formation stop Yang Kai’s rampage charge? He easily broke the Battle Formation after just a few attacks.

Without the support of the Battle Formation, the four Territory Lords were quickly slaughtered by Yang Kai one after another.

But suddenly, Yang Kai frowned and stowed the Azure Dragon Spear back in his Small Universe all while muttering, “Annoying!”

Saying so, Yang Kai’s body went down on his fours as an intense hostility and murderous intent broke out from him, like he was a ferocious beast that had been trapped for 10,000 years!

He then slightly raised his head and stared in the direction of the other Four Symbols Formation. The next moment, a mysterious energy surged from him before he disappeared, as if he had never been there.

Inside the Four Symbols Formation, the four Territory Lords were frightened like birds startled by the mere twang of a bow-string; after all, they had just witnessed their four companions being easily killed by Yang Kai. Now that it was their turn, how could they remain indifferent?

Even before Yang Kai reappeared, the four Territory Lords, who had been struggling to maintain their Battle Formation, became extremely unsettled.

Suddenly, a flash of lightning appeared before Yang Kai’s figure emerged behind a Territory Lord out of thin air, his hand suddenly thrusting towards the Territory Lord like a beast’s claw. Furthermore, lightning was crackling around his palm.

By the time Yang Kai pulled his hand back, a huge gaping hole had appeared in that Territory Lord’s body while lightning crackled around the wound. The violent lightning energy made the Territory Lord shake uncontrollably!

Immediately after, Yang Kai burst into laughter, “Better!”

Ou Yang Lie’s eyes shrank upon seeing this!

He had immediately realized something.

On another side, Yang Xiao’s eyes involuntarily widened as he blurted out, “Thunder Shadow Great Emperor!”

That strange offensive stance, the brutal way of killing his enemies, even the Concealing Divine Ability and those violent Thunder Principles were exactly the same as Thunder Shadow Great Emperor whom Yang Kai had taken into his Small Universe!

Blood Crow was also shocked beyond words.

The other Human Race Masters who saw this were also puzzled.

[What’s going on!? How did Yang Kai suddenly become Thunder Shadow Great Emperor? Was he possessed?]

At the same time, they also finally understood why Yang Kai had failed to kill Mo Na Ye. Indeed, it was meaningless to flee before someone proficient in the Dao of Space, but what if Thunder Shadow Great Emperor had occupied Yang Kai’s body? He was not proficient in the Dao of Space, so if Mo Na Ye wanted to escape, he could be helpless.

While everyone was still in shock, Thunder Shadow had already killed all four remaining Territory Lords, cutting them down like vegetables. After that, he had concealed himself once more, and thanks to Yang Kai’s Ninth-Order foundation, Thunder Shadow’s concealment became even more mysterious and unpredictable. Even Ou Yang Lie could not find any trace of him.

As for Xiao You, he was incomparably depressed!

Originally, he was seriously injured by Yang Xue’s sneak attack and was already having a hard time fighting Ou Yang Lie. The only reason he had been able to hold on until now was thanks to the eight Territory Lords who were assisting him, but now that they had been killed by Yang Kai, he would definitely not be able to hold on anymore. The only reason he was still alive was because Ou Yang Lie was somewhat dazed and confused.

However, with a powerful enemy like Yang Kai lurking nearby, ready to attack at any moment, Xiao You’s heart was firmly lodged in his throat. He didn’t feel safe at all even when he was on full alert.

“Thunder Shadow, what happened to Yang Kai!?” Ou Yang Lie grit his teeth and shouted, not letting down his guard just because the Thunder Shadow had killed the eight Territory Lords. He knew about the Three Selves Source Reconstitution Art, and that the union of three Selves was the key to Yang Kai’s breakthrough to the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm, but by the looks of it, something had gone wrong with the Three Selves Source Reconstitution Art which resulted in Thunder Shadow occupying Yang Kai’s body.

Of course, Thunder Shadow was also part of Yang Kai, but he was not Yang Kai, so Ou Yang Lie had no choice but to ask.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s figure appeared with a flash of lightning as he ruthlessly clawed towards Xiao You’s head. Xiao You had been on guard the entire time, so when he sensed danger, he promptly turned around and threw a punch, barely managing to resolve the crisis. But taking advantage of this opportunity, Ou Yang Lie also attacked Xiao You, and his attack managed to land.

Thunder Shadow couldn’t help but click his tongue before he once again concealed himself while sending Divine Sense transmission to Ou Yang Lie, “Big Brother’s Dao Strength became unstable in the last battle. Also, he was too exhausted after suffering repeated serious injuries. He’s currently in a deep sleep, but don’t worry, he should recover after a while!”

After a momentary pause, he added, “Stop wasting your breath, let’s get this over with first!”

Ou Yang Lie nodded lightly in agreement. Long story short, Yang Kai’s problem wasn’t very big, but there was a big problem with the Three Selves Source Reconstitution Art.

Regardless, it was not the time to mull over such matters. Whether Yang Kai would suffer a mishap or not remained to be seen. The most important thing right now was to deal with the remaining Black Ink Clan.

Immediately, Ou Yang Lie straightened his thoughts and attacked again with renewed focus.

With Ou Yang Lie suppressing Xiao You and creating opportunities, it became much easier for Thunder Shadow to launch sneak attacks. Every time Xiao You was caught off guard, Thunder Shadow would suddenly appear and fiercely attack before going into hiding again. Every strike put Xiao You in agony, gradually worsening his injuries further.

From the start, Xiao You was not Ou Yang Lie’s opponent because of his grave injuries, so when an expert like Thunder Shadow was hiding in the dark nearby, attacking him at every opportunity, it became impossible for Xiao You to survive.

Compared to Ou Yang Lie, the hidden Thunder Shadow posed a much greater threat to Xiao You.

[We lost! The Black Ink Clan completely lost this time!]

At first, the Black Ink Clan had the advantage, but things took a turn for the worse when Yang Kai suddenly advanced to the Ninth Order.

The straw that broke the camel’s back was Mo Na Ye’s escape at the last moment, which ruined the Black Ink Clan’s last hope of victory. Nonetheless, Xiao You also knew that if Mo Na Ye had not run, he would have been the first to die!

At that time, escaping was the only option for Mo Na Ye.

As such, although Xiao You held some resentment towards Mo Na Ye, he did not hate him. If he was in Mo Na Ye’s position, he would have made the same choice.

Now that he was being targeted by two Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters though, Xiao You knew his death was assured, so his mindset changed as he became determined to make the most of the time he had left.

There were many Black Ink Clansmen on the battlefield; Xiao You could not let them all die!

“Withdraw and escape!” Xiao You suddenly shouted to the Black Ink Clan troops who were besieging the Human Race’s defensive line.

The moment he gave this order, the Black Ink Clansmen scattered without a moment of hesitation, as if they had been waiting for those exact words all along.

The tides were already not in their favour, which anyone could see. Mo Na Ye had already fled, and it was difficult to tell whether Xiao You would survive or not. If the remaining Territory Lords and Pseudo-Royal Lords didn’t run now, when Xiao You was killed and the two Ninth-Order Masters became free to act, none of them would be able to escape.

Previously, they had not fled because they didn’t dare to, but now that Xiao You had given them the order, how could they hesitate?

All the Black Ink Clansmen fled, and the Human Race Masters, who were originally having a hard time, were freed all of a sudden. Yang Xue let out a cold snort and stared at a Pseudo-Royal Lord, before giving chase. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She also knew that it was impossible to eliminate all of the Black Ink Clan troops, so she decided to target the Pseudo-Royal Lords, who were stronger than the others, and eliminate as many as possible.

“Pursue them!” Xiang Shan shouted. Having been an Army Commander for millennia, he was well-versed in the art of war. In battle, the best time to get results was when chasing a fleeing enemy. At least half of all kills were generally obtained during this time, while it was extremely hard to eliminate an opponent when two Armies were confronting each other head-on.

So naturally, when the Black Ink Clan started fleeing in every direction, it was a good opportunity for the Humans to chase and slaughter them. As for how many they could kill, that would depend on luck and methods.

The faster Black Ink Clansmen fled into the distance in the blink of an eye, while the slower ones suffered.

The Humans had been suppressed since the beginning of this battle, so after having gone through so much hardship, they had a lot of anger and resentment bottled up in their hearts, which they finally got a chance to vent.

Suddenly, small battles broke out all across the void, with the sound of Territory Lords falling occurring frequently.

Seeing this, Ou Yang Lie shouted anxiously, “Finish him quickly!”

As long as Xiao You was alive, he and Thunder Shadow would be tied down with him. They had to kill Xiao You as soon as possible so that they could join the pursuit of the other Black Ink Clansmen.

This was a rare opportunity. If they could kill even half of the Black Ink Clan Masters present here, it would definitely lift a lot of pressure from the Human Race in the near future.

With two Ninth-Order Masters acting together, one in the open and one in the dark, it was impossible for the injured Xiao You to survive even if he was a true Royal Lord.

Under the repeated sneak attacks of the Thunder Shadow, Xiao You’s injuries slowly piled up, but he still went all out to hold on as long as possible, just to buy more time for the other Black Ink Clansmen to escape.

However, there was still a limit.

Thunder Shadow, controlling Yang Kai’s body, suddenly reappeared behind Xiao You and punched out. Lightning flashed and the power of thunder exploded, almost blowing his head off on the spot.

Surrounded by lightning, Xiao You violently convulsed and lost all control over his body. At that exact moment, he saw Ou Yang Lie’s long blade swinging towards him, but he was unable to defend himself.

“Die!” Ou Yang Lie roared as he used all his strength to cut Xiao You in half.

The aura of a Royal Lord suddenly flared up before vanishing!

The next moment, Black Ink Strength along with pitch-black blood gushed out from Xiao You’s two halves.

In response, Ou Yang Lie did nothing. He just stood there with his sabre, letting the black blood stain his body as he shouted, “Good!”

Thousands of years had passed since the devastating war in the Barren Territory, and this was the first time a Royal Lord had been killed since then, and he was killed by Ou Yang Lie!

It was a glorious moment.

The next instant, Yang Kai, who was moving like a beast the entire time, also appeared nearby.

Ou Yang Lie glanced at him as the corner of his mouth twitched. He could not help but wonder what kind of expression Yang Kai would make when he recalled this scene after regaining consciousness.

However, Thunder Shadow could not be blamed for this either. Thunder Shadow had always lived in the Myriad Monster World, cultivating the Primal Art and tempering his Monster Core. He had never taken on Human Form, nor did he have the ability to do so. He had always maintained his beast-like appearance, so suddenly asking him to smoothly control Yang Kai’s body and act like a Human was impossible. So, it was better for Thunder Shadow to simply act in accordance with his original nature.

“Don’t just stand there! Kill!” Thunder Shadow shouted as lightning crackled around him before he transformed into a streak of light that chased after the fleeing enemies.

Ou Yang Lie followed closely behind.

A short while later, shockwaves of a fierce fight could be felt coming from the distant void.
