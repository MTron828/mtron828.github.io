Seeming to sense Yang Kai’s thoughts, Fu Guang said, “The power I have accumulated is already enough. All that remains is the evolution of my Bloodline. No external force can help me now.”

Over the past three years, the Dragon Pool power that Yang Kai drew using the Great Sun and Moon Marks was almost equivalent to what Fu Guang would take in after 100 years of effort. This showed the immense power of the two Marks.

Previously, Fu Guang could not take this final step because the Ancient Dragon Vein Tempering Art he was using could not draw enough Dragon Pool power at once to apply sufficient pressure to force a breakthrough. However, this was not a problem with the Great Sun and Moon Marks.

Although he could draw the same amount of Dragon Pool power in 100 years as Yang Kai did for him in three years, that did not mean that the effect was the same.

Without Yang Kai’s help, he might not have been able to take this final step in 100 years, or even 1,000 years.

Now, Fu Guang could feel that his Bloodline was changing, so it was time to finally take that last step.

Maybe when the Dragon Pool opened again, the Dragon Clan would have another Divine Dragon!

Yang Kai was relieved to hear him say that. He did not want to owe someone a favour. Fu Guang had instructed him on the Dao of Time, and Yang Kai helped him to advance to become a Divine Dragon. Thus, there was a mutual gain and neither owed the other.

A Dragon Scale suddenly flew towards Yang Kai and Fu Guang said, “Bring this to those three old ghosts and you will get the rewards that you deserve.”

Yang Kai reached out and grabbed it. He had a feeling that the Dragon Scale had been marked by Fu Guang’s Secret Techniques but he did not know what it said.

He had no intention to pry either as he had not done anything wrong to the Dragon Clan during his trip to the Dragon Pool, except for devouring a lot of Dragon Pool power. He even did Fu Guang a favour.

Although he was now a pure-blood member of the Dragon Clan, and he had purged the part of him that was Human when he broke through, subconsciously, Yang Kai still felt like he was Human.

A flash of light suddenly came from above. The light came from afar but seemed to penetrate the entire Dragon Pool.

Immediately afterwards, a low voice sounded from above, “Time is up, quickly leave the pool.”

The voice was naturally from one of the Ancient Dragon Elders. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Without delay, Yang Kai nodded slightly at Fu Guang and said, “Farewell, Senior. I hope to hear good news from you the next time we meet.”

Although Fu Guang said he had accumulated enough power, and all that was left was Bloodline conversion, things might not go so smoothly.

Just look at the number of Divine Dragons who had appeared throughout the Dragon Clan’s history and one would understand. If it was so easy to break through and become a Divine Dragon, then the number of Divine Dragons in the Dragon Clan would not be so low.

“Go on,” Fu Guang nodded lightly.

Yang Kai flicked his Dragon Tail and swam into the beam of light.

This glowing path seemed to have the effect of warping space. He did not know how the Dragon Clan managed to do it, but Yang Kai, who was millions of metres deep into the Dragon Pool, reached the top after just a blink of an eye.

At this moment, in the huge square of the No-Return Pass where the five statues of the Dragon Emperors stood, a portal appeared.

Dozens of Dragon Clan members gathered from all directions. 13 Dragons then rushed out of the vortex, one after another, appearing in the No-Return Pass.

Instantly, the Dragons roared one after another, causing the void to shake.

However, the Dragon Clan was stunned after seeing the condition of those who entered. Even the three Ancient Dragon Elders frowned.

This could not be helped though; after all, the growth of those that went in seemed too small during this Dragon Pool cultivation session.

Their expectation was, among the three Young Dragons, the one called Big Brother Ji was sure to advance to become a Grand Dragon; after all, he was already over 9,000 metres and was not far from breaking through. A few years of training in the Dragon Pool should have been enough to cross this divide.

Zhu Wu You and Fu Qian were a little further behind, but if they were lucky, they might also be able to advance to become Grand Dragons.

Although one Young Dragon had indeed advanced to become a Grand Dragon, he was just over 10,000 metres, which clearly indicated that he had broken through not too long ago.

Zhu Wu You and Fu Qian’s progress was even more pitiful. They were barely 9,000 metres each, still a long way from becoming Grand Dragons.

This was only the Young Dragons’ performance though, and the Grand Dragons were even more disappointing.

Among the 10 Grand Dragons who entered, at least two or three should have reached the Ancient Dragon realm.

However, only Ji Lao San had become an Ancient Dragon while the others were still Grand Dragons. Even their growth was unsatisfactory.

The Three Ancient Dragon Elders had never seen a batch of descendants with such poor performance before. It could be said that this was definitely the group of Dragons with the smallest achievements in the Dragon Pool in history.

Some distance away, Huang Si Niang was sitting on a branch of the Immortal Parasol Tree, dressed in her usual colourful robes. She swung her legs leisurely as she looked on eagerly at the unfolding drama.

When she saw the state of the Dragons that emerged out of the Dragon Pool, she smiled and muttered, “I knew it. When they let that Human into the Dragon Pool, I knew that there would be a negative effect on the other Dragons. It turns out that I was right.”

Feng Liu Lang stood next to her and frowned as he said, “Didn’t the Dragon Clan ever consider checking his Source?”

Huang Si Niang pursed her lips and said, “The Dragon Clan is too proud. Even if that Human had refined a Dragon Source, it was of no importance to them. Additionally, they made some agreements with the Old Ancestors from the Human Race, so they would not waste their energy checking. What they did not know is that the Source that Human obtained was extremely powerful.”

Yang Kai had the Golden Divine Dragon Source, the Source of the Third Generation Dragon Emperor. While the Dragon Clan did not know about this, the Phoenix Clan had guessed it before he went in.

This couldn’t be helped, as Yang Kai had been able to access a Phoenix Nest on his own.

That Phoenix Nest belonged to the Phoenix Empress of the same era as the Third Generation Dragon Emperor. The Sources of these two were lost together, and had never been found.

Since Yang Kai was able to enter that Phoenix Nest, and he said that his Wife obtained the Source of that generation’s Phoenix Empress, it was likely for that Dragon Emperor’s Source to be with him.

Since the Dragon Clan was too lazy to check, the Phoenix Clan Head also did not bother to tell them. By letting such a person into the Dragon Pool, there certainly would be some impact.

That was why when the Dragon Pool reopened this time, Huang Si Niang waited to watch the drama unfold.

It was so boring staying at the No-Return Pass and there was no place to have fun when they were cultivating in their Phoenix Nests.

Huang Si Niang did not understand what Yang Kai did in the Dragon Pool, but why did the Dragons who entered with him grow so little? Could their lack of performance be related to him? Even if his Source originally belonged to the Third Generation Dragon Emperor, it should not have such a dramatic effect, right?

Nonetheless, her doubts were soon answered.

Zhu Wu You went straight to his parents’ side and shouted, “That Yang Kai fellow is such a bastard! He snatched so much of the Dragon Pool power that we did not have enough for us to cultivate with!”

Zhu Wu You’s parents, an Ancient Dragon and a Grand Dragon, both frowned when they heard what had happened.

It was common for clansmen to fight in the Dragon Pool for more power. When they first entered the Dragon Pool, they also fought with their other clansmen for a better position.

Thus, Zhu Wu You’s accusations were quite flimsy.

Zhu Wu You’s Father, an Ancient Dragon, immediately reprimanded, “What is there to complain about if you are not as good as that Human? Furthermore, that Human should be able to transform into a Grand Dragon. Even if he fought with others, he wouldn’t bother with your position. You’ve always been too lazy which is why you did not advance much this time!”

Zhu Wu You felt aggrieved and explained, “No Father, that guy really has something strange about him. I don’t know what method he used, but he was somehow able to quickly devour an enormous amount of Dragon Pool power. My strength is weak and I occupied the uppermost position, but just half a month after entering the pool, the position where I was no longer had any Dragon Pool power at all.”

“The Dragon Pool power was depleted that rapidly?” Zhu Wu You’s Mother, a Grand Dragon, appeared stunned.

Zhu Wu You nodded and continued, “Yes, so I went to Fu Qian’s territory to fight for a better position, but after just half a month of fighting, his place also did not have any Dragon Pool power left. We continued descending through the pool to fight with the others, but no matter how deep we dove, the Dragon Pool power did not last long. It not only happened to where we three Young Dragons were, but also the places occupied by the Senior Grand Dragons. Go ahead and ask them if you don’t believe me.”

The Ancient Dragon turned his head and looked doubtfully at the others who had just emerged, to which all of them nodded in agreement.

Upon hearing the explanation and seeing their collective reaction, the Dragons, who were waiting in the square, loudly remarked.

“No wonder all those who entered the Dragon Pool this time have not improved much.”

“How can that be? The power of Dragon Pool should have been sufficient, how could it have dried up so quickly?”

“The Dragon Pool power seeps up from bottom to top. If too much power is consumed at the lower depths, it would disrupt the replenishment above and then the top would dry up. But… how can a mere Human have that kind of ability?”

“Or could ‘that’ Senior be the cause of it?”

“It’s possible. If his breakthrough was imminent, he would naturally require a tremendous amount of Dragon Pool power and it would not be surprising for him to disrupt the density above.”

“If it was really because of ‘him’, then these brats were just unlucky to enter the Dragon Pool at this time.”

“…”

Zhu Wu You did not know who they were referring to. Fu Guang had been cultivating in the Dragon Pool for the past 5,000 years, and Zhu Wu You was only a few hundred years old; thus, he did not know of Fu Guang.

Zhu Wu You’s parents certainly knew about Fu Guang though. If it was really because of him that these Dragons did not advance much during this Dragon Pool cultivation session, then there was nothing they could do about it. After all, an additional Divine Dragon in the clan was worth far more than having a few more Grand Dragons or Ancient Dragons.

When Zhu Wu You heard their speculations, he complained, “Why do you all keep referring to ‘that’ Senior? It was all due to that Human! Ask Third Uncle Ji if you don’t believe me. Third Uncle Ji saw it clearly when that Human broke through!”

“A breakthrough?” The group of Dragons all gasped in surprise.

Frankly, the Dragon Clan did not know the specifics and extent of that Human’s Dragon Bloodline; after all, Yang Kai had never exposed his Dragon Form or Pressure to them. They only knew that he was a Grand Dragon and even that was revealed to them by the Human Old Ancestors.

As Huang Si Niang said, the Dragon Clan had their pride and even though Yang Kai managed to refine a Dragon Source, they did not take him seriously and did not bother to investigate.

An old Ancient Dragon Elder looked at Ji Lao San and asked, “Did that Human really achieve a breakthrough in the Dragon Pool?”

Ji Lao San nodded meekly.

Before he entered the Dragon Pool, his Dragon Body was nearly 50,000 metres. Now, when he left the Dragon Pool, he was only 55,000 metres.

But what about that Human?

When Yang Kai entered the Dragon Pool, he was 35,000 metres, yet after just half a year, he managed to break through to become an Ancient Dragon. Now that three more years had passed, there was no way to guess just how much he had grown.

Ji Lao San was a pure-blood Dragon! To think that he could not even compete with the advancement rate of a mere Human in the Dragon Pool! He was utterly ashamed of his poor performance compared to that dastardly Human.
