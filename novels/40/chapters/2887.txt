Yang Kai did not evade the grasp of the gigantic skeletal hand this time.

As the huge hand closed its grip, Yang Kai’s figure disappeared, and more than a hundred thousand Bone Devouring Clansmen cheered and worshiped their five Shaman Kings.

The faces of Yue and Lu turned pale, and they seemed to be unable to accept the scene in front of them; however, Tiea’s voice immediately came from the side, “He’s fine!”

Tiea was a notably special existence in the Shaman Niu Clan. She was just a Shaman Grandmaster, but she seemed to have insight that even a Shaman King could not possess, her words never once being false.

She stated before that Yang Kai would come for them.

Then Yang Kai came.

Therefore, everyone in the Shaman Niu Clan seemed to be affected by her words and felt reassured.

On the contrary, the five Shaman Kings of the Bone Devouring Clan wore stern looks on their faces and did not seem to rejoice in their success.

A grunt suddenly came out of the gigantic skeletal hand. No one could make out the mutter clearly; however, after the grunt, a loud Dragon Roar suddenly burst out, followed by an incomparably huge Golden Dragon manifesting inside the palm of the gigantic skeletal hand.

A terrifying aura filled the air.

The five Bone Devouring Clan Shaman Kings who joined hands suddenly felt a sense of insignificance.

*Kacha…*

The gigantic skeletal hand was forced open by a golden light as a huge figure could be seen through its fingers, standing on its palm.

Followed by a swing of sword light, the skeletal hand trembled and its fingers were severed, falling from the sky like five small hills, frightening the Bone Devouring Clansmen below and forcing them to flee the mess.

Yang Kai, who used his Dragon Transformation, jumped onto the skeletal palm, dragging the Myriads Sword along with him as he ran up the arm, creating a series of screeches and sparks.

In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai reached the elbow of the skeletal arm, standing towering like a glorious king as he gazed down at everything below him.

The five Bone Devouring Shaman Kings looked up together, and saw a scene that they would never forget in their life.

The skeletal hand, which was jointly condensed by five of them, was cleaved by a newly promoted Shaman King with sheer brute force. A huge crack split from the wrist of the skeletal hand all the way to the elbow, like a ravine that represented a testimony of the passage of years and the changes of eras.

Yang Kai tapped his foot lightly, and the entire skeletal arm was split into two. The Shamanic Spell of the five Shaman Kings was broken, and the gigantic skeletal hand immediately turned into a million points of light before vanishing.

With his Myriads Swords pointing downwards, Yang Kai declared with a cold face, “I didn’t want to fight with you, but that doesn’t mean that I can’t. Since you started this, I will give all of you an unforgettable lesson.”

His eyes darted at Shaman Chi!

Shaman Chi was in a panic and stepped back involuntarily upon sensing the strong murderous intent in Yang Kai’s eyes.

“Save me!” Shaman Chi bellowed, and moved to get close to the other Shaman Kings. The bald Shaman King was the first to react and attempted to fly towards him.

But Yang Kai released a sword light from the sky to block his path, and when the sword light dissipated, the bald Shaman King was stunned in place as he stared at the scene before him. There, Shaman Niu had already rushed to Shaman Chi, his sword pointed at the neck of the Shaman Chi.

“Hundreds of villagers in Blue South Village died because of your Bone Devouring Clan. Killing one of your Shaman Kings today should be sufficient revenge for my people.”

Appalled, Shaman Chi bellowed, “How dare you! Sir Shaman Saint will not forgive this! If you really kill me, the Shaman Saint will chase you till the ends of the world!”

Yang Kai sneered, “I’ve been chased by a Demon Saint for a month already, do you really think I’d fear your Shaman Saint? Besides, he seems to be recuperating, right? So, you’d best just die in peace!”

“Stop!” The bald Shaman King suddenly shouted.

Yang Kai asked steadily as he turned to him, “You have something to say, Sir?”

“Let Shaman Chi go and I’ll let all of you go!” The bald Shaman King proposed in a deep voice.

Yang Kai smiled, and shook his head, “When I asked you to stop, you kept forcing me. Now that something has gone wrong, you want to make peace with me? Life is not so kind. I’m sorry, the decision is in my hands now.”

The bald Shaman King pressed on, “Killing Shaman Chi won’t do you any good. It will only forge a deep enmity between you and our Bone Devouring Clan!”

Yang Kai curled his lip, “And your Clan won’t hate me if I don’t kill him? You are a Clan that will seek revenge for the slightest grievance. If it weren’t for the invasion of the Demon Race, you would have already attacked my Blue South Village again. Since we already have an old grievance, I don’t mind adding a new one.”

“A Shaman King is an indispensable force in the war of two races right now. You can’t kill him.”

“Funny!” Yang Kai snapped back, “I’m also a Shaman King, yet did you five not join hands to kill me just now?”

“That’s because we thought you were transformed into a Demon.”

“If I were transformed into a Demon, all of you would have to die today, not just one.” As Yang Kai’s words fell, the chilling light of the Myriad Sword in his hand flashed and Shaman Chi’s head flew into the sky as a fountain of blood burst from his neck.

The remaining four Bone Devouring Shaman Kings all stared in horror.

They thought Yang Kai was just bluffing, and would not really kill Shaman Chi, but they did not expect him to really do it. Shaman Chi’s body was still standing in place, while the expression on his severed head was one of utter shock. Obviously, he did not think his life would end just like this.

Instead of dying at the hands of the Demon Race, he died at the hands of a fellow Barbarian.

After killing Shaman Chi, Yang Kai teleported in front of the bald Shaman King and stabbed the Myriads Swords a hand length into his chest.

The bald Shaman King was instantly stiffened, and dared not to move a muscle.

“Don’t underestimate me. I can kill all of you if I wish.” Yang Kai stared at the bald Shaman King coldly as a drop of cold sweat rolled down the latter’s cheek.

“But all of you still have some use. You can fight and kill Demons, so I will spare your lives today!” Yang Kai withdrew his Myriads Swords before staring down from above at the bald Shaman King and declaring in a fierce voice, “All of you better remember, don’t provoke my South Barbarian Clan. Whoever dares will pay the price.”

The bald Shaman King remained silent, obviously somewhat traumatized.

Stowing away the Myriads Swords, Yang Kai walked past the bald Shaman King and went straight to the place where the twenty thousand people of the Shaman Niu Clan were being detained.

The Bone Devouring Clansmen who stood in the way looked at Yang Kai in fear, as if they were looking at a fierce beast, and soon they split apart, opening a path for him.

When he reached the front of the Shaman Niu Clan, the Shaman Grandmaster of the Bone Devouring Clan who had been guarding them looked as if he had still not come to his senses. Yang Kai raised his eyes, and the Shaman Grandmaster immediately stepped aside, a breeze blowing by as he felt a chill shoot up his back.

“Sir!” Yue, Lu, and all the others came forward to salute him, their eyes were filled with awe.

“Let’s go.” Yang Kai called.

Ah Hu came forward and reported, “They took our mounts.”

Yang Kai looked back at the bald Shaman King.

It was obvious that the bald Shaman King was struggling, and Yang Kai began to reveal a meaningful grin.

A moment later, the bald Shaman King seemed to have made the hardest decision of his life and shouted, “Return to them those things!”

The clansmen of the Bone Devouring Clan immediately rushed out, and a moment later, a thousand Demon Beasts and several dozen Giant Eagles were released from their cages and returned straight back to their masters.

The cavalry mounted their Demon Beasts, while the Aerial Cavalry rode their Giant Eagles into the air. More than twenty thousand people marched out of Cang Er Mountain Valley in an orderly fashion, each member of the Shaman Niu Clan holding their heads high, their backs as straight as javelins.

Behind them were the eyes of more than a hundred thousand Bone Devouring Clansmen, all of them filled with complicated feelings.

When the people of the Shaman Niu Clan finally left their sight, only then did the people of the Bone Devouring Clan let out a sigh of relief. The remaining four Shaman Kings all looked tired, as if they had exhausted all their energy.

Outside the mountain valley, the army was no longer able to contain their excitement and the silence was finally broken. People began to chatter amongst themselves about what had just happened, and the more they discussed, the more exhilarated they became.

No one stopped them.

Everyone had been detained by the Bone Devouring Clan and suffered mental torment for the past few days. Now that they had finally been rescued, not to mention in an extremely astonishing way, by Sir Shaman Niu, they naturally needed to vent their pent-up emotions.

“What do you want to say?” Yang Kai turned to Yue and asked. Since earlier, she had clearly been hesitant to say something. Even before she spoke though, Yang Kai already guessed what she wanted to discuss and asked, “Do you think I shouldn’t have killed Shaman Chi?”

Yue nodded, “He is a Shaman King of the Bone Devouring Clan after all, but now he died at your hands. If word of this spreads, other Clans may reject us. Our South Barbarian Clan is now in decline, so we should avoid drawing too much unwanted attention.”

Yang Kai smiled lightly and shook his head, “It is exactly because we are on the wane that we cannot restrain ourselves. We must let all the other Clans know that even if there is only one Shaman King and twenty thousand people left in the South Barbarian Clan, the South Barbarian Clan will not die. We will control our own destiny, not submit to others!” His eyes gradually narrowed, “The defence line of the Demon Race is narrowing and the war will become more and more intense. If we don’t become stronger and more ruthless, we will be used as sacrifices by other Clans sooner or later.”

After pondering for a while, Yue found his words reasonable and could only nod her head, “Perhaps you are right.”

Yang Kai pressed on, “Furthermore, it’s their fault this time. It’s wrong for me to kill a Shaman King, but I don’t think anyone will be in a hurry to stand up for Shaman Chi. The Bone Devouring Clan will continue to hate us and want to fight us, but that will only happen after the war between the two races ends. I just hope that they can survive until the end.”

“What about us?” Yue looked up at Yang Kai, like a child who had yet to mature.

“We will survive, drive away the Demon Race, and rebuild our homes!”

Yue’s eyes were filled with fascination as she visualized this beautiful future.

“Sir Shaman Dang died in battle!” Yang Kai suddenly declared.

The longing on Yue’s face was retracted, and her eyes drooped without a word, overwhelmed by sadness. Lu reached out to hold her arm, and the two sisters leaned closely together.
