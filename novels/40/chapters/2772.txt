“This Mistress offers this toast in gratitude for you saving my life,” Hua Yu Lu raised her cup and drained it in a single gulp.

Although this Hundred Flowers Palace Palace Master appeared delicate and fragile to the point where a gust of wind would cause her to topple over, she displayed a boldness that did not pale in comparison to any man. Having drained the cup in a single gulp, the shade of her face grew even more flushed than before.

“You’re too courteous, Palace Master Hua. On the contrary, the matter with Tan Jun Hao caused Palace Master Hua to be questioned by Star Soul Palace.” Yang Kai smiled lightly and drank some of the wine in his cup.

Hua Yu Lu shook her head and replied, “That wasn’t much trouble, as it was just a few questions. This Mistress simply told them the truth. Did it cause any trouble for Elder Yang?”

Yang Kai laughed and said, “Palace Master Hua’s truthful words helped me, so how could it bring trouble to me?”

Hua Yu Lu revealed a look of relief, before turning her head to glance at her surroundings before asking in a soft voice, “Why is there no sign of Xia Sheng here?”

Previously, when they had met in Flowing Shadow City, Hua Yu Lu mentioned that she was a friend of Xia Sheng’s, and from the looks of it now, these two seemed to be old acquaintances indeed. If not, she wouldn’t care this much about his presence, or lack thereof.

“Senior Brother Xia is currently stationed at Spirit Lake Palace. I’m afraid that he might be unable to come back in the near future,” Yang Kai replied. “If Palace Master Hua wishes to find Senior Brother Xia, you can take a trip to Spirit Lake Palace to pay him a visit.”

“Is that so…” A look of disappointment appeared on Hua Yu Lu’s face.

Right as she was about to say something, Gao Xue Ting suddenly walked over with a cold look on her face.

Hua Yu Lu immediately said, “Elder Yang still has other matters to attend to, so this Mistress will not disturb you further,” before turning around and leaving.

“How are your injuries?” Gao Xue Ting moved to Yang Kai’s side and asked in a soft voice, though her eyes remained fixed at Hua Yu Lu’s retreating figure.

“They’re fine,” Yang Kai replied.

If any other First-Order Emperor Realm Masters took Xue Zheng Mao’s palm to their chest, they would have to lie in bed for at least a few days. It might even be possible that they would be killed on the spot; however, with his exceedingly strong and sturdy body, coupled with the Great Soaring Black Dragon Armor he had worn, Yang Kai only suffered a few broken bones as a result of the blow, with not much damage done to his organs. He would recover from such an injury within a day or two even if he didn’t do anything about it at all.

“How do you know that woman?” Gao Xue Ting shot a question out abruptly, a look of disdain present on her face.

Yang Kai replied, “I exchanged greetings with her once in Flowing Shadow City. What about her?”

“Nothing. If you’re still injured, you should go and recuperate rather than mingle with a dubious and shady figure like her.”

Dubious and shady figure…

Gao Xue Ting seemed to have a very big issue with Hua Yu Lu. After realizing this, Yang Kai did not dare to ask her more about the details.

With a flicker, Gao Xue Ting snatched away the wine cup in his hand, before saying, “There will be an exchange meeting between Emperors in the evening. Good things can appear there, so you should take a look if you’re interested.”

“Exchange meeting?” Yang Kai was indeed interested in it.

Gao Xue Ting nodded and replied, “It is rare for so many Emperor Realms to be gathered in a single place, so everyone naturally wants to take this opportunity to make connections, regardless of it being useful or not. This is also something that the Temple Master wishes to see, so the exchange meeting will be hosted by our Azure Sun Temple. That’s right, you can take anything you do not need to exchange as well.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Good, call me when it’s time,” Yang Kai nodded his head.

“Go on,” Gao Xue Ting waved her hand in response.

With the end of the Grand Canonization, Yang Kai was now a full-fledged Elder of Azure Sun Temple. However, due to the time constraints brought about by the whole series of events, he still did not have his own residence, so he naturally could only return to Purple Bamboo Peak.

Yang Kai took the next half a day to adjust his breathing to recover from his injuries. By the time night had fallen, his injuries were almost fully healed.

The communication artifact beside him vibrated slightly at that point. Extending his hand out to grab it, Yang Kai swept it with his Divine Sense before standing up.

The location of the exchange meeting was still Myriad Saints Peak, though this time the event was held inside the main palace. The various attendees should have already received the news of this exchange meeting, so only a few of the guests from earlier had left Azure Sun Temple. If not for urgent matters that required their attention, even those who left absolutely wouldn’t have missed an exchange meeting like this.

A few Azure Sun Temple disciples were standing at the doors to welcome the guests, and upon seeing Yang Kai, respectful looks appeared on their faces as they bowed their heads and shouted, “Greetings, Elder Yang.”

Yang Kai nodded his head in response, before walking in with huge strides.

Sweeping his eyes across the room, Yang Kai noticed that the palace was already filled with people. The guests that were here for the Grand Canonization Ceremony during the day were basically all present, with over a hundred Emperors accompanied by their Disciples or descendants they had brought along.

Although there were many people present here, everything was neat and orderly, devoid of the usual bustle from a crowd. Although conversations were occurring throughout the place, everyone was doing so privately with whispered voices.

The interior of the palace was brightly lit, making it seem as though it was daytime.

“Over here!”

As Yang Kai was looking around to find a place to sit, Gao Xue Ting’s voice suddenly rang in his ears. Looking over to the source of the sound, Yang Kai noticed Gao Xue Ting seated at the left side of the palace, beckoning to him.

With a faint smile, Yang Kai walked over to her.

That place seemed to be the area where the Azure Sun Temple Elders were seated, as other than Gao Xue Ting, there was also Chen Qian, Di Rong, and You Kun present. Seeing Yang Kai walk over, all of them revealed kind smiles on their faces.

Yang Kai exchanged greetings with everyone before sitting down at Gao Xue Ting’s side.

“Junior Brother, have you participated in such an exchange meeting before?” Gao Xue Ting suddenly turned her head over to him and asked.

Yang Kai stared blankly at her for a while, before looking to his other side. Noticing that there was no one there, he snapped back to his senses and looked back towards Gao Xue Ting, “Elder Gao, are you talking to me?”

Gao Xue Ting laughed and replied, “Who other than you do you think I’m talking to? Ghosts?”

Chen Qian, who sat by Gao Xue Ting’s side, covered her mouth to let off a soft laugh before explaining, “Yang Kai, you’ve broken through to the Emperor Realm and are now an official Elder of the temple, so you naturally have to be treated as an equal. This is the rule of our temple.”

An awkward look appeared on Yang Kai’s face as he scratched his head in response, “It may take me a while to adapt.”

Earlier today, he had placed himself in the status of a disciple before Gao Xue Ting, but now he had suddenly become her Junior Brother, which was a huge jump in position. This jump was a little too sudden and significant for him to wrap his head around.

Nevertheless, as he thought about it, everything made sense. At this moment, be it his cultivation or status, he was not one bit inferior to Gao Xue Ting and the other Elders, so he indeed possessed the qualifications to be considered an equal.

“Let me hear you call me Senior Sister!” Gao Xue Ting wore a serious expression on her face as she looked at Yang Kai.

“Senior Sister Gao!” Yang Kai said with a grin, showing his exceedingly strong adaptability.

“So obedient. It’s a pity there’s no reward.” The corners of Gao Xue Ting’s mouth curled up in response, before she followed up with another question, “So, have you participated in an exchange meeting before?’

“No,” Yang Kai shook his head. Although he had participated in quite a few auctions, he had only heard rumours of such exchange meetings. “Nevertheless, I know the basic rules, which is a barter trade.”

“That’s correct.” Gao Xue Ting nodded her head. “When one’s cultivation reaches the Emperor Realm, Source Crystals become less important and valuable. There are many good things that cannot be bought with Source Crystals; therefore, everyone generally prefers to conduct direct barter trading. Naturally, this does not mean that people would not take out Source Crystals to trade, though everything depends on the conditions set by the owner of the treasure.”

Yang Kai committed every one of Gao Xue Ting’s words to heart as he continued to nod his head, his humble stance causing Gao Xue Ting to be exceedingly satisfied with him.

After a moment, the great doors of the Myriad Saints Palace creaked, before closing shut with a bang.

Yang Kai knew that this exchange meeting was about to start.

Indeed, as soon as the palace doors closed shut, an elderly man flew up to the stage. This was not an outsider, but Azure Sun Temple’s Vice Temple Master, Qiu Ran.

Being the organizer and host, Azure Sun Temple naturally needed to be the first one to grace the stage and stir the crowd up.

After a soft cough, Qiu Ran spoke, “Many thanks to all the friends gathered here to attend tonight’s exchange meeting. This Old Master wishes for everyone to be able to obtain what they want and return from a rewarding journey. There’s not much more to say about the rules, so let the exchange meet begin. Our Azure Sun Temple will start things off and hopes for everyone to be able to offer up good items here.”

With a wave of his hand, a jade bottle appeared. Raising it slightly, Qiu Ran said, “This is an Extreme Soul Tempering Pill, a Low-Rank Emperor Grade Spirit Pill. This pill is for Emperors to consume, and upon refining its efficacies, it will allow a huge surge in one’s Spiritual Energy, enabling one to display one’s Soul Techniques with greater effectiveness. There are three pills within the bottle and only Source Crystals are accepted. Everyone, please make your bids.”

Right as his words rang out, the faces of the greater majority of the Emperors present changed.

This could not be helped, as those were Emperor Pills!

Emperor Pills were absolutely not easy to be chanced upon. Only Emperor Alchemists were capable of refining Emperor Pills, yet how many Emperor Alchemists were there in the entire Star Boundary? Even a great Sect like the Azure Sun Temple did not have their own personal Emperor Alchemist.

The Violet Source Chamber of Commerce had an Emperor Alchemist amongst its ranks; however, Grandmaster Huang Fu’s Alchemy schedule was already packed full to the brim. Even if someone wanted him to refine a pill, they would need to wait in line for a few years at least before getting their chance.

Among the Star Boundary, Spirit Pills beneath the Emperor Grade were still a common sight as there was still a substantial number of Dao Source Grade Alchemists out there. Nevertheless, things like Emperor Pills were basically rarities.

Yet now, Azure Sun Temple actually took out three Extreme Soul Tempering Pills, which was more than sufficient to show their sincerity.

Furthermore, only allowing Source Crystals as bids allowed all of the Emperors present to participate.

Therefore, right as Qiu Ran finished with his words, bids were announced in rapid succession, with the old bid being outbid immediately after being called. In a moment, an extremely lively atmosphere akin to a flea market appeared inside Myriad Saint Palace, as every Emperor present shouted until their faces and necks turned red, a display of their exertion in the bidding process.

Nevertheless, those pills seemed to have not much of a use for the Emperors from Azure Sun Temple.

That was because Azure Sun Temple possessed the Divine Ascension Mirror!

When he had first arrived at Azure Sun Temple, Wen Zi Shan had told Yang Kai that the cultivators of their Azure Sun Temple possessed Soul cultivations superior to their fellow cultivators in the same realm. The reason for this was the Divine Ascension Mirror.

The Divine Ascension was a Sealed World used for the improvement of one’s Spiritual Energy. As long as the Emperor Realms of the temple could go in once to cultivate, the result would be countless times more effective compared to this Extreme Soul Tempering Pill.

If they wanted to increase their Spiritual Energy, they would just need to enter the Divine Ascension Mirror, without the need to consume any Emperor Pills at all.

In other words, the Extreme Soul Tempering Pill might really not be of much value to the Emperor Realms of Azure Sun Temple. One could immediately realize this just by seeing the indifferent expressions present on the faces of Chen Qian and the others.

After realizing this, Yang Kai laughed quietly in his heart.

“5 million!” A person’s voice rang out before the entire place turned silent.

The bid of 5 million High-Rank Source Crystals immediately halted all of the other Emperor Realms in their tracks, as this price was basically the extreme limit that one would pay for those pills. People who were capable of cultivating all the way to the Emperor Realm were not stupid, and thus would naturally not recklessly toss away their Source Crystals; after all, this was just the beginning of the exchange meet, and who knew what good things might come up later.
