“Dare I ask Brother Yang, was there really no treasure on the Soaring Dragon Altar?”

Qin Yu’s voice clearly rang in Yang Kai’s ears.

“Why would Young Lady Qin ask that?” Yang Kai looked at Qin Yu in amazement, looking extremely surprised.

Qin Yu stared deeply into Yang Kai’s eyes with a clear and flawless gaze, as if trying to see into the depths of his heart.

Yang Kai stared back flatly but soon frowned and asked in a low voice, “Young Lady Qin means... Could it be that among the dozen or so treasures on the Soaring Dragon Altar, some weren’t illusions?”

“Haha...” Qin Yu smiled, “This Mistress cannot say for certain and was just asking casually. At that time, only Brother Yang, Brother Duan, and Brother Zong were near the Soaring Dragon Altar, so only the three of you were able to check all the items carefully.”

Yang Kai shook his head and said, “I did not see any real treasures there, and according to my observations, neither of the other two obtained any benefits.”

“So that’s how it is, this Mistress simply thought too much,” Qin Yu nodded apologetically.

“Is this what Young Lady Qin wanted to ask?”

“Yes, it seems I have wasted Brother Yang’s time. I apologize.”

“It’s fine. If there is nothing else, then this one will take his leave,” Yang Kai cupped his fists and turned to go.

“Brother Yang, please wait!” Qin Yu suddenly called out.

“Is there something else?” Yang Kai frowned, a little displeased. If it were not for the fact that the other party was a weak woman who had a gentle and forthright temperament, he wouldn’t have bothered even speaking to her; after all, he and Qin Yu were strangers who had only just met.

“Please calm yourself, Brother Yang, this Mistress simply wanted to ask Brother Yang if he was seeking the entrance to the second layer?”

“What of it?” Yang Kai didn’t try to deny it.

“Then does Brother Yang know where that entrance is?”

Yang Kai shook his head. He only knew that the entrance was a Five Coloured Light Pillar, but where exactly that pillar was, he had no clue. Kang Si Ran had not mentioned anything about it at the time.

Nonetheless, since a giant Five Coloured Light Pillar was quite a dazzling sight, it should not be difficult to find. As long as he was close enough, he should be able to discover some clues.

However, seeing the look on Qin Yu’s face, Yang Kai suddenly realized that things might not be as simple as he thought so he could not help raising his brow and asking, “Does Young Lady Qin know where the entrance is?”

“I don’t know the exact location,” Qin Yu shook her head apologetically.

Yang Kai was stunned speechless at once.

Qin Yu smiled and followed up though, “But, while this Mistress doesn’t know the specific location, she has a general idea...”

Lowering her voice further, she whispered, “Between the mountains, beyond the misty banks of fog, surrounded by a clear river spring, the pillar of light appears.”

“Between the mountains, beyond the misty banks of fog, surrounded by a clear river spring, the pillar of light appears?” Yang Kai repeated with a frown.

“En!” Qin Yu nodded, “The Five Coloured Light Pillar is the only entrance to the second layer, but if one does not arrive at exactly the right spot, they will never be able to find it. Even if one passes right by it, there is a chance they will not notice.”

“Is this something you learned from your ancient books as well?” Yang Kai looked at her in surprise.

Qin Yu nodded.

“Young Lady Qin’s knowledge is truly profound!” Yang Kai admired sincerely.

Qin Yu’s pale face showed a slight blush, and for a moment seemed to be a bit more energetic, but she soon shook her head and said, “Brother Yang is too polite, this Mistress simply knows some superficial things while being unable to ascend to gain true understanding. In truth, this Mistress is now on her way to search for the entrance to the second layer. If Brother Yang does not mind, would he like to accompany me?”

She had invited Yang Kai.

Yang Kai heard this and could not help glancing at the ship behind her, a hesitant look appearing on his face.

If he had such a ship, he could save a lot of energy and could even rest and recuperate onboard while still advancing forward, which was a distinct advantage.

However...

“This Yang appreciated Young Lady Qin’s kind offer, but he is more accustomed to travelling alone,” Yang Kai thought it over for a moment but eventually declined Qin Yu’s proposal.

Qin Yu wore a look of disappointment, but did not try to force the issue, simply nodding and saying, “In that case, this Mistress will not disturb Brother Yang any further. I wish Brother Yang good fortune.”

“To you as well, farewell!” Yang Kai cupped his fists before turning away and flying off.

“Hmph, can’t appreciate kindness!” After his figure disappeared, a guard next to Qin Yu stared in the direction Yang Kai’s flew off and coldly snorted cry, a look of dissatisfaction filling his face, apparently incensed on behalf of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu simply smiled and said, “He’s simply acting cautiously, how could that be the same as not appreciate kindness? I think it is normal for him to have made such a choice.”

“Young Lady, you are far too generous,” The guard looked upset, “By the way, Young Lady, why did you ask him that before? Weren’t all the treasures on that Soaring Dragon Altar fake?”

“Perhaps... but... from what I saw in the ancient records, things should have been a little different. I don’t know what happened.”

After saying a few words, Qin Yu suddenly coughed violently.

The guard became panicked and quickly said, “Young Lady, let us return inside, the wind is quite strong outside.”

“En,” Qin Yu nodded lightly before turning around and heading into the ship.

...

At the same time, somewhere in the first layer, there was a petite woman with a striking crescent-shaped birthmark on her face. It was none other than Mo Xiao Qi, who had been with Yang Kai at the entrance of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda.

At this moment, Mo Xiao Qi was riding a Monster Beast that resembled a lion and a tiger. The Monster Beast had a fierce look, and its fur was a mixture of snow white and silver. It possessed a giant body and when it breathed, the heat from its nose seemed to contain a mysterious force that caused the ground before it to melt slightly.

If anyone else was here, they would be incredibly shocked.

Because the creature Mo Xiao Qi was riding was the famous Silver Maned Liger. Although this Monster Beast could not trace its lineage to the Ancient Divine Spirits, it was still an extremely powerful creature that was born as a Fifth-Order Monster Beast. As long as this Monster Beast’s aptitude and fortune weren’t bad, it could easily grow to the Tenth-Order and possibly even reach the Eleventh-Order at its peak.

In other words, a fully matured Silver Maned Liger could compare with an Origin King, or even Dao Source Realm, master.

Some legends even told of Twelfth-Order Ligers which were as strong as Emperors!

This Silver Maned Liger was obviously not comparable to a Dao Source cultivator as it only exuded a peak Tenth-Order aura, but it was still not to be underestimated.

Silver Maned Ligers were famous for their wild ferocity, not something an ordinary cultivator could subdue. Even if an Emperor Realm master took action, they might not necessarily succeed in taming one. The most likely result would be that the Liger would fight to the death, choosing to die rather than submit.

But now, this majestic Silver Maned Liger was being used as a simple mount by Mo Xiao Qi. What’s more, it didn’t seem the least bit dissatisfied, obeying all of the young girl’s orders without question, a stunning sight to behold.

In front of Mo Xiao Qi, there was a strange beast about the size of a palm flying about. This strange beast looked like a bat and was quite unremarkable at first glance; but judging from the aura fluctuations coming from its body, it was apparently a Tenth-Order Monster Beast.

This Heaven Escaping Bat, like the Silver Maned Liger, was another extremely rare species.

It was a wonder where Mo Xiao Qi had acquired these two precious Monster Beasts and how she had gotten them to obey her so loyally.

It was not even clear if these two Monster Beasts had been subdued by Mo Xiao Qi before she entered the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda or after.

“Xiao Fu, quickly find the entrance! If you do, I’ll give you something delicious... Xiao Yin, you also walk a bit faster, don’t be sluggish now,” Mo Xiao Qi sat on the back of the Liger and gave out orders, obviously looking for the entrance to the second layer.

The Heaven Escaping Bat named Xiao Fu by Mo Xiao Qi seemed to have some special abilities and was leading her across a certain mountain range covered in fog and lined with streams. These mountains were quite strange, seemingly stretching up into the Heavens and out to the horizon, making it impossible to see what lay beyond them.

Amidst these mountains, the babbling of mountain springs seemed to echo all around in a disorienting manner. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The Heaven Escaping Bat flew directly past a certain mountain spring before stopping and fluttering in place.

Mo Xiao Qi quickly had her Liger follow and when she arrived on the other side of the stream, she looked up and laughed, “That wasn’t too hard to find... En, I must be the first one here hehe.”

Just as she was about to go forward though, she suddenly remembered something and said, “Right, I should see where Big Brother Yang is first.”

Saying so, she took out a bead from her Space Ring and sent her Qi into it. A moment later though, she showed a look of disappointment and shook her head, “This place is really too big, the Sound Bead can’t reach. Could it be because the World Principles are too fragmented here as well? Forget it, Big Brother Yang will certainly come here eventually. Xiao Fu, you wait here, and when you see Big Brother Yang, bring him to find me on the second layer.”

After leaving this command, she took out a jade slip, poured her Divine Sense into it, and left some information in it before hanging it around the Heaven Escaping Bat’s neck and rushing forward happily.

A moment later, in a brilliant flash of light, Mo Xiao Qi and the Liger disappeared.

The Heaven Escaping Bat circled around for a moment before it suddenly dove into a pile of rocks and vanished into the ground.

...

On the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda’s third layer, Lan Xun wandered around surveying the surrounding environment. She was exuding a faint glow that seemed to be capable of repelling all dangers from her.

At a certain point, she arrived at a secluded mountain valley and after scanning it carefully, she smiled happily and nodded, “Here.”

Saying so, she took out some Spirit Array equipment from her Space Ring and got to work.

Two days later, she had finished arranging everything and took out a large amount of Source Crystals, creating a big pile nearby. Only after this was done did she sit down cross-legged and begin circulating some kind of mysterious Secret Art while impacting the bottleneck to the Dao Source Realm.

As time passed, Lan Xun’s tender body began to emit a faint suction force that drew in many firefly-like wisps from nearby. These wisps looked similar to the starlight wisps Yang Kai had absorbed in the Starlight Corridor some time ago.

However, if one examined them carefully, they would discover that these wisps were completely different in nature.

The starlight in the Starlight Corridor was a kind of catalyst that could promote the transformation of Saint Qi into Source Qi.

But the wisps here were actually shattered World Principles.

As these wisps entered her body, Lan Xun was able to more clearly grasp Principle Strength, and her aura began to slowly increase in intensity.
