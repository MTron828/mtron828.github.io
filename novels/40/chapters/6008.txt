Chapter 6007: He Left!?

Whether it was High Heaven Territory’s Star Boundary, or the Universe Worlds of Myriad Monsters Territory, everywhere where Humans had settled, Humans were chanting Yang Kai’s name non-stop, singing his praises, spreading the name of Void Great Emperor.

For the first few days, nothing unusual happened, but as time passed, a strange sound started ringing in everyone’s ears, like waves crashing onto the shore.

Furthermore, the sound became louder and louder with the continuous actions of the Humans. Finally, at a certain moment, a strange phenomenon occurred.

Everywhere the Humans were gathered, a river suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

The sonorous sounds of waves crashing were originating from the river, and everyone witnessed this magical sight.

The water in the river swelled and flowed towards the horizon, passing through the endless void, flowing through one Great Territory after another, to the Late Ancient Era battlefield, and finally converging on the final battlefield where Yang Kai and Mo fought each other.

The dozen or so of Yang Kai’s close relatives in the palace looked excited at the sight of this. Their chanting became more hurried, and their expressions more fervent.

The river was illusory at first, as if it existed in another Space-Time, but it soon became real and tangible. Immediately afterwards, a figure emerged from the tumultuous waves in the river.

Looking at the figures standing in the palace, the figure cracked a smile and stated, “I’m back!”

The figures in the palace broke into tears of joy as they swarmed towards the figure one after another.

…..

Meanwhile, the Masters in the Taboo Realm soon got the news and rushed over. Over 100 people had gathered in a short time, and more were still coming from afar.

These people were all Supreme Masters of their respective Universes. Each and every one of them had reached their own limits. Every single one of them used to be a legendary figure where they came from.

But now, their worlds had long forgotten about them, causing them to be trapped in this Taboo Realm.

Over 100 of the strongest Masters in existence were calmly standing around the location where Yang Kai had fought with Jiang Ba, staring at a corpse floating nearby.

The corpse naturally belonged to Jian Ba. Jian Ba was tightly holding a broken sword in his hand, while the cause of his death was none other than the other half of his sword being rammed through his chest.

Dead!

There was no shortage of brave and ruthless men in the Taboo Realm, and battles broke out all the time. These were the kind of battles one would seldom see in the outside world.

Be that as it may, very few people actually lost their lives during these fights.

Because although the cultivation methods were different for Universe to Universe, everyone’s prime focus would be their Dao, after their cultivation had reached its utmost limit. It could be said that all things lead to the same destination; as a result, everyone’s strength was basically the same here. So, no matter how intense a battle was, very few people would die.

The last time someone died was over 100,000 years ago, and that was because a certain man with a horrible personality ultimately drew everyone’s ire and was besieged by many Supreme Masters.

But the current situation was far from that. It was pretty obvious that Jian Ba had not died because he was ganged up on. No matter what kind of Dao they were cultivating here, they all had sharp vision and insight.

The one who had killed Jian Ba was just a single man! Furthermore, Jian Ba’s opponent had killed him so easily that he had even snapped Jian Ba’s sword in two!

Even if these Supreme Masters present here weren’t very familiar with Jian Ba, most of them had fought him at least once in the past.

Jian Ba’s sword was his Dao. So, killing someone might not be a big deal, but killing someone while destroying their Dao at the same time was inconceivable.

What the Supreme Masters were concerned about was that they had sensed some unusual fluctuations a while ago. Even when they were far away, those fluctuations were as bright as a match in the darkness.

Those were clearly the fluctuations caused by someone breaking through their current cultivation realm! But by the time they arrived here, they didn’t see anything.

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, the faces of Chong Jiu and Jian Ba’s companion were filled with a bitterness, their expressions way worse than eating a bitter pill.

Both had witnessed Jian Ba’s death at the hands of Yang Kai, which had shook them to the core. By the time they came back to their senses, the Supreme Masters had already arrived here to investigate after noticing the commotion.

As a result, they were unable to leave.

If they tried to leave now, they would definitely be forced to stay.

The Supreme Masters had been trapped here for far too long, so any unusual movements would definitely attract their attention, let alone a disturbance that exceeded the limits of their current strength.

“Who was here?” Someone suddenly asked.

Although it was a random question without a head or tail, the meaning behind it was obvious. The speaker was obviously asking who had witnessed Jian Ba’s death.

No one answered.

“Who arrived here first?” Someone asked.

Still no answer, but the eyes of the Supreme Masters began to wander across each other, their gazes swiftly changing as they reached a certain unspoken agreement.

Finally, everyone’s eyes landed on Chong Jiu.

Chong Jiu scowled in anger as he stared at the colleague invited by Jian Ba, “Why are you only looking at me? He was here as well!”

Although the two were originally on different sides, they clearly had no choice but to band together at this moment. If they didn’t handle this situation well, they might become the public enemies of all the Supreme Masters, so they couldn’t afford to be careless.

There was no escape from this Taboo Realm. If they became public enemies, things would be hard-pressed for them in the future.

“Who killed Jian Ba?” An old man with small stature asked. This old man had been trapped in the Taboo Realm for who knows how many years. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that he was one of the oldest Supreme Masters in the Taboo Realm; at least, these 100 or so Supreme Masters present had all come to the Taboo Realm later than him.

“It wasn’t me,” Chong Jiu quickly clarified, “I’m not that capable.”

The Supreme Master standing beside him also quickly denied, “I didn’t kill him either.”

“You were here first, didn’t you see who did it?” The short old man asked. Although he was the only one who spoke, he represented everyone.

“Well…” Chong Jiu hesitated for a moment. He knew that no matter what, he couldn’t avoid this matter. Rather than drawing everyone’s ire, he might as well speak the truth. After understanding this point, he finally answered, “Yang Kai killed him.”

“Who is Yang Kai?” The short old man frowned. He had never heard of this name before.

“He was a newcomer whose Dao Strengths had manifested into a river. He arrived about 8,000 years ago,” someone explained.

The short old man finally understood, “I seem to have some impression of him, but how could a newcomer kill Jian Ba? Where is he?”

“He left,” Chong Jiu replied.

“Where did he go?”

“He left, from this place.”

The Supreme Masters were stunned for a moment before staring at Chong Jiu in shock.

Being the focus of attention of so many Supreme Masters, Chong Jiu felt as if an enormous mountain was weighing down on him. The Supreme Master who was standing by his side subtly stepped away from him, drawing a clear line between them.

“You said… he left this place?” The short old man asked. Although his tone remained calm, his heart was in turmoil.

“Brothers, Sisters, there’s no need to stare at me like that, he really did leave. This friend and I saw it with our own eyes,” Chong Jiu stated as he pointed towards the Supreme Master who had just stepped away from him.

The man’s face darkened, but he knew he couldn’t avoid it. All he could do was brace himself and nodded, “Yes, he did leave.”

Chong Jiu smiled and said, “Weren’t you all attracted by those strange fluctuations? I’ll be frank with you, according to the rumours, there are two ways to leave the Taboo Realm, and the second method is apparently true. Yang Kai used that method to leave this place. What’s more, when he broke through the restrictions here, he seemed to also break through to the next realm, allowing him to kill Jian Ba!”

Since ancient times, it had been passed down that there were two ways to escape the Taboo Realm. One was to constantly fight and kill other Supreme Masters. So long as you killed enough Supreme Masters, you would have a chance to leave this place. The second was to have enough people from your original Universe remember you and wish for your return.

Whether the first method would work or not, no one knew, because few people ever died in the Taboo Realm.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

But now, the second method had been proven effective. If Chong Jiu wasn’t lying, Yang Kai had left the Taboo Realm using this method.

Under these circumstances, there was no need for Chong Jiu to lie, everyone was well aware of this.

“How is that possible? Once we arrive here, the denizens of our Worlds would’ve quickly forgotten about us. Without any memories, how can they remember us? This is simply impossible,” Someone questioned.

Chong Jiu spread out his hands and stated, “I don’t know. In any case, Yang Kai told me a long time ago that his world would never forget him. Perhaps because he saved his Universe, the people of that world still remember him?”

The Supreme Masters still found it difficult to accept this, because from ancient times until now, there had never been a precedent of anyone leaving this place.

But now, a newcomer who had only entered 8,000 years ago had done just that.

This made them envious, but at the same time, they also saw a glimmer of hope.

If someone could leave here, it meant that this Taboo Realm wasn’t a prison they couldn’t escape from, it was just that they had not found the right way.

It was definitely impossible to count on Yang Kai’s methods. Not mentioning who knows how his world still remembered him, the main reason was that he had only been here for 8,000 years.

The others had simply been here for far too long. Before Yang Kai, the previous Supreme Master to arrive here had done so some 20,000 years ago. After tens of thousands of years, all traces of his existence in his world would have long since vanished

“You can get a glimpse of the next realm after breaking the restrictions here? What kind of Realm is that?” The short old man asked.

Chong Jiu shook his head, “I don’t know what Realm he reached, but once he broke through, he casually snapped Jian Ba’s sword with just two fingers.”

All the Supreme Masters gasped in shock.

What those two fingers destroyed was not just a sword, but Jian Ba’s Dao!

One could only imagine what amazing realm Yang Kai must have reached at that instant.

“Everyone, before Yang Kai left, he told me that he will find a way to rescue me. Although I don’t know if he would be able to do it, if he does, everyone here will have new hope of finding a way out.” Chong Jiu threw out another piece of news that excited everyone.

In an instant, the expressions of all the Supreme Masters present changed.

Half a day later, the Supreme Masters finally dispersed.

Chong Jiu let out a long sigh and wiped the sweat from his forehead. Although he was also a Supreme Master and didn’t fear any individual in the Taboo Realm, being stared at by hundreds of Masters just as strong as him still felt like being stabbed multiple times.

If he hadn’t thrown those words at the last moment, Chong Jiu believed that these guys would have attacked him together and then interrogated him for more information.

Even if he had already divulged everything he knew…

However, everything was different once he spoke those last words. As long as they still wished to leave the Taboo Realm, they would not make things difficult for him in the future. In fact, if anyone dared to make things difficult for him, they would become public enemies of this Taboo Realm!
