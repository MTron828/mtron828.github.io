“Sir, do you remember the White Divine Dragon from 1,000 years ago?” Mo Na Ye mentioned.

The Royal Lord pondered for a while and then it suddenly dawned on him, “You mean…”

Mo Na Ye said, “If I’m not mistaken, their destination should be the Source Domain!”

“How dare he!” The Royal Lord was furious and slapped the armrest of the bone throne, his Black Ink Strength radiating through the hall like a tsunami.

1,000 years ago, a White Divine Dragon passed through the Territory Gate, through the No-Return Pass, then flew into the Black Ink Battlefield, and had not been heard from since. At that time, the Royal Lord felt the intense Dragon Pressure and was reluctant to start any conflict with the Divine Dragon; thus, he helplessly watched as it soared through the No-Return Pass and strutted away.

It was a good thing that the Divine Dragon was not interested in the Black Ink Clan and was just passing by.

At that time, he didn’t know what the White Divine Dragon was going to do, but later, he realized that the only thing in Black Ink Battlefield that a Divine Dragon would care about was the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction.

The Divine Dragon was probably rushing to the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction to monitor the situation there.

In this regard, the Black Ink Clan could not do anything.

Now, after more than 1,000 years, Yang Kai led hundreds of Eighth-Order Masters aboard a Purifying Black Ink Battleship towards the No-Return Pass. The Royal Lord thought that Yang Kai was going to create trouble at the No-Return Pass, but Mo Na Ye saw his real objective with a glance.

Thus Human force was most likely heading to the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction.

The Mother Nest was the root of the Black Ink Clan, and it was also the place that the Human Race feared the most. How could they not pay more attention to it?

If a Divine Dragon wanted to go to the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, no one in the current Black Ink Clan could stop it, but if Yang Kai and these Eighth-Order Masters wanted to follow, how could the Royal Lord allow them to do so? If they had any ill intentions towards the Mother Nest, it would have a great impact on the entire Black Ink Clan.

Thinking this, he shouted immediately, “Mo Na Ye, quickly recall the Territory Lords who can fight! Those Humans must not leave here alive!”

Mo Na Ye, however, shook his head, “Sir, it’s too late to recall the Territory Lords.”

The Purifying Black Ink Battleship should have reached the Barren Territory by now, and would soon arrive at the No-Return Pass. There was no time to recall the other Territory Lords.

The Royal Lord got up and paced back and forth several steps, before declaring with determination, “If that’s the case, then let’s gather all our strength and fight.”

Mo Na Ye exclaimed, “No!”

The Royal Lord turned and glared at Mo Na Ye angrily, as he was displeased that he had opposed his order. He suppressed Mo Na Ye so forcefully with his pressure that the latter quickly bowed and explained, “Sir, if a war breaks out at the No-Return Pass, countless Black Ink Nests will be destroyed regardless of who wins.”

There were hundreds of Territory Lords stationed here, many of them healing in the Black Ink Nests at the No-Return Pass. Together with a true Royal Lord, a Pseudo-Royal Lord, advantageous terrain, and a huge Black Ink Clan Army, they could certainly put up a good fight with the incoming Humans; however, as Mo Na Ye said, once the fighting started, the Black Ink Clan would incur enormous losses. Furthermore, many Black Ink Nests would be lost.

The Black Ink Nests were critical to the Black Ink Clan as without them, they could sustain themselves.

What Mo Na Ye said immediately dampened the Royal Lord’s anger. He took a deep breath, sighed and frowned for several moments, before sitting back down on the bone throne. He then said with some resignation, “Yes, there is a need to guard the Black Ink Nests. Mo Na Ye, you are right!

Mo Na Ye understood the Royal Lord’s near depression well. In some sense, it was torture for a powerful being like the Royal Lord to be sitting here at the No-Return Pass for thousands of years, unable to do anything.

The Black Ink Nests were the foundation of the Black Ink Clan, but they were also an invisible shackle that bound the only Royal Lord here.

In the battle at the Barren Territory, almost all of the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were killed, including the Dragon and Phoenix Clan Leaders. That final battle was a huge victory for the Humans as they killed almost all the Royal Lords and even managed to seriously hurt the Black Ink Giant Spirit God…

The battle that took place over 3,000 years ago and had a profound impact on both sides to this day. In fact, the impact of that battle would continue on for many years into the future.

Perhaps only when the number of Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters and Royal Lords recovered would a new era begin.

After a moment of deliberation, Mo Na Ye asked, “Sir, is there any news from the Mother Nest?”

The Royal Lord slowly shook his head and replied, “There has been no news since the Supreme One fell into deep sleep. Obviously, it is not time for the Supreme One to awaken.”

Mo Na Ye nodded and said, “Sir, there is no need to worry too much about the Mother Nest and the Supreme One’s situation. Since it has been the same for so many years, obviously there would be no changes in the short term regardless of what the Humans attempt. What can a mere Divine Dragon do to the Supreme One other than monitor it?”

The Royal Lord suddenly snorted coldly, “A lone Divine Dragon? If it dares to penetrate the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, then I have to thank it for contributing to the war effort!”

Though they could not do anything to a Divine Dragon, the Supreme One was different. If the Supreme One was awakened, even a Divine Dragon could be corrupted by Black Ink Strength. If that Dragon dared to go deeper into the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, he would definitely make a fool of himself.

“That’s right!” Mo Na Ye agreed, “If that is the case for the Divine Dragon, then it would be the same for Yang Kai and the others!”

The Royal Lord suddenly understood what Mo Na Ye meant, looked at him, and asked, “You suggest we just let them go?”

Mo Na Ye calmed down and was secretly relieved that the Royal Lord was convinced by him. At least his efforts were not in vain. As such, he nodded and said, “If they are just passing through the No-Return Pass, then we should let them go. This can also take some pressure off the battlefield.”

The intel mentioned that the number of Eighth-Order Masters with Yang Kai numbered in the hundreds. If so many Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters went to the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, that would mean that the Great Territory Battlefields would have less of them and the pressure on the Black Ink Clan would be reduced significantly.

“But we can’t let our guard down!” Mo Na Ye added, “We should still make some preparations in case Yang Kai decides to attack the No-Return Pass. If that happens, we will need Sir to deal with him personally!”

The Royal Lord nodded and said, “If that is the case, he will not be spared.”

“Sir is the only Royal Lord left and represents the face of the Black Ink Clan…”

Before Mo Na Ye could finish his sentence, the Royal Lord responded, “I know, I will enter a Black Ink Nest later to heal my old wounds.”

Mo Na Ye shouted, “Sir is wise!”

…..

The Purifying Black Ink Battleship swiftly flew across the Barren Territory. Powerful Divine Senses spread out from inside the ship. They could see two Giant Spirit Gods from afar, continuing their 3,000-year-long battle. In another direction of the void, another Black Ink Giant Spirit God was sitting cross-legged with one of his arms stuck through the boundary wall…

The rising stars who saw the Giant Spirit Gods for the first time were awed by their sheer size.

Even those who had encountered the Giant Spirit Gods before were just as unsettled as when they first saw them.

No one could help but wonder how there could be such huge beings in this Universe. If such a huge being was to sneeze in their direction, the ship full of Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters would be smashed and many would undoubtedly die.

Their forefathers and the Ninth-Order Old Ancestors who died in the Barren Territory thousands of years ago had faced such frightening figures. To think that they had launched such a brave attack on such a powerful foe and managed to seriously wound it!

If the Black Ink Giant Spirit God was so powerful, then what about Mo, the being who created them? Was this an enemy that could be defeated?

There was an ominous feeling all around. Yang Kai remained silent and had no intention of encouraging the ship full of Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. After so many years of cultivating, if they gave up their will to fight just after a glance at the enemy, then the Human Race was doomed no matter what he said.

Naturally, those who had reached the Eighth Order had strong wills.

In fact, if Yang Kai wanted to, he could have activated the Purifying Black Ink Battleship’s Defensive Arrays to prevent them from looking outside so that they would not be intimidated by the Black Ink Giant Spirit God; however, he did not do so.

He wanted them to realize how powerful the enemy really was and to let them know that the road ahead was long and arduous! Their Eighth-Order cultivation was far from enough. If the Human Race wanted to defeat the Black Ink Clan and eliminate Mo, the only way was to get stronger! Much, much stronger!

They silently travelled through the vast Barren Territory, and soon arrived at the Territory Gate.

Yang Kai had planned to go to the No-Return Pass first to check if the Black Ink Clan had set up an ambush on the other side. He thought that if the Black Ink Clan had any intelligence, they would not do something so stupid; after all, it would not do the Black Ink Clan any good to fight at the No-Return Pass. However, he had to take some precautions.

Before the Purifying Black Ink Battleship could reach the Territory Gate though, a voice shouted from afar, “Is that Sir Yang Kai?”

Yang Kai looked up and saw a sturdy figure waiting in the distance and felt the aura of an Innate Territory Lord…

[Interesting, did the Black Ink Clan arrange for someone to welcome us?]

Aboard the Warship, the group of Eighth-Order Master had a change in expression. Most of them had already fought against Territory Lords on the battlefields, but they hardly spoke with one another and instead just fought to the death. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

It was also the first time they heard a Human addressed as ‘Sir’ by a Territory Lord.

Yang Xiao whispered to Yang Xue, “Little Aunt, Adoptive Father is so powerful! Even before we arrived, a Territory Lord came from afar to welcome him. His fame from all his killing rampages must be truly remarkable!”

Yang Xue lightly pursed her lips and smiled, “There is no need to envy him. The Dragon Clan is not bad, either.”

Yang Xiao sighed and said, “It’s not the same. I’m afraid I can only look up to my Adoptive Father in my entire life. However, Old Fang… still has some hope.”

Old Fang had also made a name for himself amongst the Black Ink Clan over the years and was widely known as Little Yang Kai. Not only was he proficient in the Dao of Space, but he was also extremely powerful and had a deep heritage. He was much stronger than average Eighth-Order Masters, but although that was the case, he remained calm and honest.
