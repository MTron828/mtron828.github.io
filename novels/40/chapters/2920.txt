As everyone watched on, Yang Tai smashed into the giant blood-coloured door.

He used all his strength to crash into the door and did not protect himself in the slightest, so it wasn’t hard to predict what would happen.

They heard a bang, and just like Wu Kuang Yi before him, Yang Tai exploded into a mist of blood.

But his blood and flesh didn’t splatter over the door like a messy paste; instead, it seemed to have its own life, slowly wriggling in mid-air and gradually coming back together.

Everyone who had just begun to feel relieved was instantly set on edge again. They had no idea what this situation entailed, but everyone’s hearts filled with a very bad feeling. Yang Kai’s perception was better than the others and he was able to feel wisps of Demon Essence coming from the mist of blood that Yang Tai had burst into. Naturally, it was a type of aura that made him very uncomfortable, as if he had returned to that ancient world and was facing the Masters of the Demon Realm once more.

In the blink of an eye, the cloud of blood gathered into a shape.

“This…” Gong Yue’s eyes widened.

“Demon Character!” Yang Kai gritted his teeth and shouted, his heart swelling with anxiety.

The shape that the bloody mist gathered into was none other than the Demon Character that Yang Tai revealed when he performed his Secret Technique earlier. Under a mysterious force, the bloody Demon Character was propelled forward and smashed against the door.

No one knew what kind of effect the Demon Character formed of Yang Tai’s physical essence through the blood sacrifice would have on the door, but since Yang Tai had done this, he must have been certain about its efficacy.

A light burst from the door that was so bright that they could hardly open their eyes, and just as everyone was blinded for a moment, they could hear a sudden creak.

Everyone jumped in fright, and by the time they realized what sound it was, all their faces were pale.

The giant blood-coloured door was opened!

Even though the blood sacrifice that had gone on for so long was interrupted by Yang Kai halfway through, Yang Tai’s final desperate struggle became the last straw that broke the camel’s back.

Whatever was hidden behind the door was going to be revealed at this moment.

Yang Kai focused his eyesight to its maximum and finally saw something. The giant blood-coloured door had indeed been opened, but only by a small crack. Many of the sealing patterns on the door still seemed to be effective, creating a force that was opposite from the Demon Character, preventing the door from opening.

At that moment, Yang Kai vaguely saw something fly out from the gap.

When the light dissipated and the door was shut once more, everything felt like it had just been an illusion after the dust settled.

Everyone was in shock and were all looking at each other.

But very quickly, someone noticed something was wrong. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“What… What is that?” Chen Bing Ru’s voice was trembling as she pointed at the object floating in front of the door.

The group turned to the direction she was pointing at, and they all looked shocked.

At some unknown time, a black light the size of a green bean had begun floating in front of the door. It was simply too small and wasn’t emitting any special aura, so nobody noticed it at first. Not to mention that the lighting here wasn’t very good, so Chen Bing Ru had also only noticed it by chance.

The black light didn’t seem to be a living thing at all and just floated there quietly without any strange behaviour.

But when Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense over it, his face changed and he shouted, “It’s a Demon Spirit! Everyone, guard your minds, don’t let it invade your Knowledge Sea or you’ll definitely be demonised!”

When they heard that, the faces of the group changed, but Yang Kai had just saved them from death’s door, so even though they didn’t understand everything, they still moved out of instinct. All of them closed off their Knowledge Seas and guarded their minds vigilantly.

“Brother Yang, this Demon Spirit… Is it the type of Demon Spirit that we’re familiar with?” Fang Zhuo asked.

The Demon Spirit that he mentioned was the mass of distracting thoughts that would appear in a cultivator’s mind on their path of cultivation. These were the thoughts that could affect their cultivation, such as greed, vanity, jealousy, hatred… All of these were Demon Spirits, and at times, they were able to cause dissonance in one’s cultivation.

Yang Kai shook his head and turned back to that small mass of black light. He couldn’t help but recall his experiences in the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld, “There is another Great World out there called the Demon Realm, and the beings that live there are called the Demon Race. Several times, they’ve tried to invade the Star Boundary, but they were forced to withdraw by the ancient warriors who killed off many of the Demon Race’s Masters. But the Demon Race had a very strange and special characteristic, their incredibly tenacious vitality. They were extremely difficult to kill, and even those ancient warriors were unable to destroy all of them completely. For that reason, they could only seal them. I have no idea what is sealed behind that giant blood-coloured door, but this Demon Spirit definitely escaped from behind it. In short, the Demon Spirits I speak of are Remnant Souls of Demon Race Masters.”

The thing they saw speeding out from behind the door was this black light.

When they heard this, everyone was stunned. It was the first time they’d heard about the Demon Realm. They were, at the very least, Emperor Realm Masters with exceptional skill in cultivation and vast amounts of experience, so while they wouldn’t dare say that they knew all the secrets of the world, at the very least, it was very rare for them to have not even heard of something.

But it was the first time they’d heard the words ‘Demon Realm’. They knew about the Demon Race of course, as there were some vague references in ancient books they’d seen, but those weren’t very detailed.

“Brother Yang means to say that there are Demons sealed behind this door?” Fang Zhuo asked with a frown.

“From how it seems, I’m afraid it is so.”

Chen Bing Ru asked, “This Ancient Cave Mansion has existed for tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years. Even if a Demon Race Master was truly sealed behind that door, there’s no way they would still be alive now, is there?”

Yang Kai answered, “That is why only a Demon Spirit appeared. The Demons sealed inside may be dead, but their Remnant Souls still exist.”

“It’s just a Remnant Soul… There’s no need to be so…” Chen Bing Ru squeezed out a smile, vaguely feeling that Yang Kai was making a big problem out of nothing. Regardless of whether a Demon was sealed behind that door or not, so much time had passed that a Remnant Soul likely wouldn’t be able to achieve much even if it showed up.

“What do you know?” Yang Kai shouted in anger at her.

Chen Bing Ru shut her mouth in embarrassment. Her cultivation was higher than Yang Kai’s, so if not for the fact that Yang Kai had just saved her life, she would probably be snapping back at him right now. Even so, she still didn’t take too kindly to being shouted down at by Yang Kai like this.

Yang Kai took a breath to moderate his mood and tone before continuing, “As long as the Demon Spirit is still around, we can not put down our guards, otherwise… Hm?”

As he was speaking, the black light which had not been moving this whole time suddenly flew up and rushed straight at him. It was not known whether it was intentional or by coincidence.

An extremely unsettling aura pulsed from within that small Demon Spirit, and as if flew towards Yang Kai, he could feel a burning sensation come from his right eye.

He immediately understood that it was not a coincidence that the Demon Spirit chose him; rather, its actions were driven by instinct.

His right eye was fused with the Ancient Demon’s Black Eye, which had the aura of an Ancient Demon. Since the Demon Spirit was the Remnant Soul of a Demon Race Master, it was only natural that it would be attracted to it.

Yang Kai coldly snorted and began chanting a Shamanic Spell, raising his hand and pointing it forward.

A burst of light shot out and swept across the black ball that was flying over to him. In an instant, the black light which was the size of a bean was thrown back like a falling leaf in a storm, seemingly being hit hard.

Yang Kai’s current state was like an arrow at the end of its flight, so the power he could exert at this moment was not great by any means; however, this Demon Spirit had been sealed for so long that as a Remnant Soul, it wasn’t very powerful. It immediately shrank in size the moment the Shamanic Spell hit it.

Seemingly sensing that Yang Kai was not easy prey, the black light shot off in another direction.

Its target was now Gong Yue.

Gong Yue was currently somewhat dazed. He had been deceived by Yang Tai and joined hands with him to try and kill several Emperor Realm Masters from the Southern Territory, but now, after Yang Tai used himself as a blood sacrifice, a Demon Spirit had come out from behind the door, proving that Yang Kai’s words were true.

The so-called ultimate secrets of the Martial Dao were not in there at all. Those lies were merely part of Yang Tai’s scheme.

Yang Tai wanted to release all the Demon Spirits sealed behind that door, and that was why he came to Gong Yue, to take advantage of his skills in the Dao of Spirit Arrays.

He was the former Patriarch of the Gong Family, and everything he did was going to reflect back on the Gong Family. After today, the Gong Family’s reputation would have been completely destroyed, putting it in a difficult situation.

When he realized this, Gong Yue’s heart turned to ashes and even after hearing the conversation Yang Kai and the others had about the Demon Spirit, he didn’t react too much to it.

It wasn’t until the Demon Spirit began flying over to him that Gong Yue finally moved. He raised his hand slightly, sending a solid palm print flying towards the approaching Demon Spirit.

Even though he was an Array Grandmaster, he still had Second-Order Emperor, so while his palm strike wasn’t enough to cause both Heaven and Earth to flip, it was still very strong. At the very least, it was several times stronger than the Shamanic Spell that Yang Kai cast earlier.

He thought this would be enough to sweep away the Demon Spirit, and even kill it.

But something unexpected happened.

The palm print passed right through the Demon Spirit, having no effect on it in the slightest.

“Watch out!” Yang Kai shouted. Even though Gong Yue was partly responsible for the current situation, he didn’t want Gong Yue’s mind to be corrupted after what he encountered in the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld. That was why Yang Kai tried to warn him.

Gong Yue also focused himself quickly and brought out everything he had. He had been hurt by the Mountains and Rivers Bell, but under desperate conditions, he still exerted extraordinary strength, placing several layers of solid protection in front of him.

But the black light passed through his layers of protection as if they weren’t even there, piercing straight into his mind.

Everyone was stunned.

Gong Yue’s eyes also widened for a moment before he let out a shout, as if he was suffering great torment.

Yang Kai was a little dumbfounded. He couldn’t understand why such a thing happened no matter how he thought about it. He saw Gong Yue’s protection, and it was reasonable to say that it was sufficient to withstand the Demon Spirit’s erosion.

But in fact, it didn’t even seem half as useful as it should be.

[This doesn’t seem right…]

Just as Yang Kai was feeling puzzled, Gong Yue suddenly let out a roar and a raging aura escaped from the pores of his body. Both his hair and his beard danced wildly while his voice shook the cave and rustled the rocks.

The faces of everyone changed as they all watched Gong Yue nervously.

At this moment, nobody had much power left to resist, so if Gong Yue went berserk, then everyone would be in trouble.

Chen Bing Ru said in a trembling voice, “Brother Yang, he… Did he…”

“His mind is being invaded by the Demon Spirit. He’s going through demonification!” Yang Kai shouted through gritted teeth.
