Source Crystals and pills were auxiliary aids, in the end, the true capital of a cultivator lay in their Secret Arts. After Gui Zu obtained the Secret Arts and Techniques of the Netherworld Sect, he was naturally overjoyed. Now this was a real gift!

Yang Kai turned to look at Chi Yue next.

Chi Yue pursed her lips and smiled, “There aren’t many Secret Arts for the Monster Race to cultivate, so don’t tell me you have one prepared for me too.”

“Indeed I don’t, but I do have this,” Yang Kai stretched out his palm and a small mound appeared in front of him. As soon as this pile appeared, Monster Qi filled the hall in a flash, surprising everyone.

“Monster Cores!” Chi Yue exclaimed as she picked up one of the Monster Cores and examined it, her face changing greatly as she shouted, “A Twelfth-Order Monster Core!”

Twelfth-Order Monster Cores were Monster Cores that formed in the bodies of Twelfth-Order Monster Beasts, equivalent to human Emperor Realm Masters.

Any such Monster Core was worth a lot of money and was so rare that an average cultivator may not even see one in their entire life.

“This is also a Twelfth-Order Monster Core,” Ai Ou also picked another up and commented in shock.

“This one is Tenth-Order, this one is Eleventh-Order…”

There were just over a thousand Monster Cores in this pile, all of them being Tenth-Order or above, with at least ten percent being Twelfth-Order, a terrifying amount.

“I know the Monster Race cultivates differently from Humans, but with the help of these Monster Cores, Senior should be able to obtain twice the results with half the effort in the future,” Yang Kai said to Chi Yue.

Chi Yue was dizzy at the sight of those Monster Cores and asked in disbelief, “Where did you obtain so many Monster Cores?”

“I picked them up!” Yang Kai grinned meaningfully.

Chi Yue couldn’t help but glare at him and snort.

How could one simply pick up treasures like these? She thought Yang Kai was talking nonsense.

But in truth, Yang Kai really did just pick them up. He found more than a million Monster Cores in the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb in the Ancient Wild Lands, so what was a thousand of them worth? If Chi Yue knew the real number of Monster Cores that Yang Kai had, she would probably go crazy.

The only place where such a humongous amount of Monster Cores could be found would be in the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb of the Ancient Land.

Without further questions though, Chi Yue put away the Monster Cores excitedly. As Yang Kai said, the Monster Race cultivated differently from Humans. Most of them consumed World Energy directly or refined the Monster Cores of other Monster Beasts and Monster Race.

With so many Monster Cores, Chi Yue would definitely be able to cultivate swiftly in the future.

“Senior Gu. These Sword Dao Secret Techniques should be appropriate for your current cultivation, cultivate these for now. I’ll help you look for better ones in the future,” Yang Kai then took out a few jade slips and handed them to Gu Cang Yun.

Gu Cang Yun was the Union Master of Sword Union back in their native Star Field and cultivated the Sword Dao, so these Sword Dao Secret Techniques were undoubtedly the most suitable for him.

Yang Kai had killed many Emperor Realm Masters and obtained too many spoils of war over the years, so it was naturally not difficult to find some good Sword Dao Secret Techniques among his loot.

Gu Cang Yun took a look and his eyes brightened, “These are much more profound than what this Gu has been cultivating so far.”

The Sword Dao Techniques he had previously come in contact with were at Dao Source Grade at best, but what Yang Kai brought out were all remnants from Emperor Realm Masters, so they were naturally much more advanced than what he himself had been cultivating.

Finally, it was Ai Ou’s turn. Yang Kai also gave him several sets of matching Secret Arts and Secret Techniques.

Everyone was delighted and felt as if they had received upgrades, instantly reaching a whole new level.

But Yang Kai wasn’t finished yet. He next took out a number of Star Sources, shocking the crowd completely this time.

It had to be known that Star Sources were only formed within Cultivation Stars, and a complete Star Source was equivalent to a Cultivation Star’s core essence. They had all lived in the Star Boundary for some years now and knew that such a treasure was extremely rare here.

Chi Yue and the others always felt regret that they didn’t make the decision to refine a Star Source back in their native Star Field. Now that they had come to the Star Boundary, they felt they would never have a chance to do so.

But refining a Star Source during that time was too dangerous, so none of them could find the determination to risk it. Only Ai Ou succeeded in this endeavour.

But now, Yang Kai just took out Star Sources like candy and handed one to each of them, along with the Star Refining Art.

Ai Ou himself was already a Star Master, so he did not need a Star Source.

After making some preparations, Yang Kai stood guard for Chi Yue, Gui Zu, and Gu Cang Yun while they refined these Star Sources.

Three days later, the three of them opened their eyes one after the other, delighted expressions on their faces. With these Star Sources, it would become easier for them to comprehend the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao, as well as Principle Strength, which would be of great benefit to their future cultivation.

Yang Kai’s actions today were enough to help them increase the efficiency of their cultivation by ten times or even a hundred times, saving them a great deal of time and effort from now on.

“En, if there is anything you don’t understand or are confused about in cultivation, we can discuss it together.” After passing out the gifts, Yang Kai looked around the four of them.

They understood that this discussion Yang Kai spoke of was merely a modest statement. In truth, he would be the one helping them by answering their questions regarding cultivation.

So, they did not hesitate and all voiced their questions.

Inside the hall, questions and answers flowed like a stream, and time slowly went by.

“Is everyone dead in there? Get out here now!”

It was not known how long had passed when a voice suddenly echoed from outside High Heaven Palace. The speaker seemed to have gathered up his power before he shouted, so his voice would sound across hundreds of kilometres, ringing through the mountains.

Yang Kai frowned and turned his head towards the direction of the main gate, silently extending his Divine Sense over to investigate.

Outside the main gate, in front of the Sect Defending Array, an exquisitely-crafted ship floated mid-air. This ship was extremely ornate, and even though it was not an Emperor Artifact, it was still Dao Source Grade High-Rank. A large flag was hung on the mast of the ship with the character ‘medicine’ emblazoned on it.

At this moment, a young teen around the age of only fifteen or sixteen stood on the deck gazing towards High Heaven Palace’s inscribed tablet with an annoyed look on his face.

Even though he was young, he still had First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation, which amazed Yang Kai.

That shout just now obviously came from him, but he had no idea what sort of Secret Technique or artifact he used to make his voice carry so far.

[Where did this little brat come from? Daring to behave in such a way in front of my High Heaven Palace as just a First-Order Dao Source Realm!] Yang Kai had a strange look on his face.

Right at that moment, Yang Kai suddenly sensed something and took out his communication artifact. After a quick check, he saw Hua Qing Si’s message, “Palace Master, someone seems to have come looking for trouble.”

She had quite obviously heard the young man’s voice as well.

Using his Divine Sense, Yang Ki responded, “He’s just a brat. You take care of it.”

Now that Hua Qing Si was the Big Manager of High Heaven Palace, Yang Kai naturally did not intend to deal with this matter personally. What’s more, the other party was just a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator. Yang Kai had no idea what sort of backing this brat had, so it would be best to let Hua Qing Si handle it.

Chi Yue and the others all asked after they saw him using the communication artifact for a while, “What happened?”

“It’s nothing, don’t worry about it. Let’s continue!” Yang Kai put the communication artifact away as he said so.

Seeing his reaction, the others didn’t ask anything more and continued asking Yang Kai questions about their cultivations.

After a while, Yang Kai suddenly frowned and took out the communication artifact again. Checking it using his Divine Sense, an astonished expression was instantly revealed on his face.

“If something has happened, then Palace Master should go and take care of it. High Heaven Palace was founded not long ago, so we ought not to make enemies so easily,” Ai Ou said.

“En, I’ll go take a look.” Yang Kai nodded and stood up before leaving the hall in a flash.

After several flickers, he arrived outside the Sect’s main gate.

Hua Qing Si was currently there, looking at that young man on the other side of the array, but what surprised Yang Kai was the fact that this First-Order Dao Source Realm kid actually wasn’t the slightest bit meek in front of the Emperor Realm Hua Qing Si. Instead, he had a prideful look on his face.

When he saw Yang Kai appear, the boy swept his eyes over him and asked casually, “He’s the Palace Master of High Heaven Palace?”

“Yes,” Hua Qing Si nodded, “This is our High Heaven Palace’s Palace Master, Yang Kai. Speak as you wish.”

“Hmph, nothing much, I was wondering if he had three heads and six arms,” the young man smiled with contempt.

This strange haughty attitude made Yang Kai inexplicably angry, but he also didn’t want to lower himself to the same level as this boy so he simply laughed the other’s attitude off and asked, “You say you come from Medicine Pill Valley? What proof do you have?”

It was because Hua Qing Si sent a message saying this young man claimed to be a disciple of Medicine Pill Valley that Yang Kai rushed over.

The young man did not answer directly, instead just pointed to the flag behind him and coldly snorting, “Are you blind? Can’t you see this?”

Yang Kai’s forehead veins throbbed as he almost had the impulse to beat this brat up, but thinking that he might really come from Medicine Pill Valley, Yang Kai endured this urge and quickly said, “What can a single word prove? What a joke!”

The young man couldn’t help but widen his eyes and stared at Yang Kai with a strange look, “From under what rock did a turtle like you crawl out? Can’t you even recognize the mark of our Medicine Pill Valley? You actually had the face to found a Sect here?!”

[He… actually called me a turtle!]

Yang Kai could feel anger boiling in his chest, rising to his throat like magma in a volcano that was about to explode. Only after taking a few deep breaths was he able to calm himself down.

But the young man didn’t notice his reaction and jumped up to the mast, grabbed the flag, and unfurled it grandly while proclaiming, “Open your eyes and look closely! Everyone in the entire Northern Territory recognizes this flag!”

“Heh…” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and nodded lightly, “Now this Palace Master recognizes it.”

He transmitted his voice to Hua Qing Si, “I really want to punch this little brat.”

Hua Qing Si was shocked and quickly responded, “Please don’t be impulsive, Palace Master. If he really does come from Medicine Pill Valley, then we definitely cannot offend him. We still have to eke out a living in the Northern Territory in the future!”

“If I didn’t know that, why would I have to put up with him until now!” Yang Kai was indignant.

A young man waving a big flag with the character ‘medicine’ on it was not enough to scare Yang Kai.

But the name Medicine Pill Valley really did carry some weight.

This couldn’t be helped as this was the retreat of the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor. It was a Holy Land in the hearts of billions of cultivators throughout the Northern Territory!

Even though the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor did not involve himself in worldly affairs nor establish a Great Emperor Sect like the other Great Emperors, instead choosing to live in seclusion in Medicine Pill Valley along with a few disciples, this did not prevent the cultivators in the Northern Territory from revering and worshipping him.

If one offended the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor or Medicine Pill Valley in the Northern Territory, then they would definitely have a grim future. Not to mention the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor with his supreme cultivation, the cultivators of the Northern Territory themselves would not tolerate him being insulted.

The young man jumped down from the mast and stood on the deck again, standing akimbo and saying in a domineering tone, “Good! You’d best remember it well. You never know, you may have need of us in the future!”
