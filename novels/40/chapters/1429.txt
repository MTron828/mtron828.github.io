Chapter 1429, As People Mature

Yang Kai did not quite understand why Mo Yu had helped him back then, but everything became clear after seeing Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying standing behind him now.

Obviously, Mo Yu had helped him at Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying’s request.

These two young women knew how to express their gratitude, and the middle-aged Mo Yu from Clear Sky Sect was also quite upright. If this were not the case, he would not have secretly helped Yang Kai back on Dragon Cave Mountain, and even though it was just a small action, Yang Kai was not one to forget such a grace.

After all, no one had been optimistic about Dragon Cave Mountain’s survival at that point, so taking a righteous stance proved Mo Yu knew how to distinguish gratitude and grudge.

“Sister Chen and Sister Lu Ying, you two come as well,” Yang Kai called out.

Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying’s pretty faces filled with happiness as they nodded and quickly flew up after Mo Yu.

Through the open hatch of the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle, Dai Yuan and the Clear Sky Sect trio entered. After seeing the situation inside, however, Mo Yu’s expression became solemn as he hurriedly greeted Ye Xi Yun before following Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu’s example, sitting down with a straight back, and remaining silent.

Finished delivering his ultimatum, Yang Kai swept his eyes around once more before also entering the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle, after which this strange flight type artifact flickered slightly and disappeared into the flame barrier.

Outside the Flowing Flame Sand Field, countless masters wore gloomy expressions as they stared towards the flame barrier resentfully, but they were powerless to act.

After seeing Yang Kai’s rampant appearance just now, many people couldn’t help wanting to attack him, but since characters like Mo Xiao Sheng and Cheng Peng Xuan didn’t take action, naturally everyone else restrained themselves, leading to them missing their opportunity. Now that Yang Kai had re-entered the Flowing Flame Sand Field, there was nothing they could do to catch him.

“Elder Mo, that little brat acts far too supercilious. Could it be that we’re just going to let him go like this?” A burly man stepped forward and asked Mo Xiao Sheng, his face filled with unwillingness.

This man was not unknown, and his cultivation was not low. Just a few years ago, he had broken through to the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm and was the Sect Master of a second-class force.

Although he was a Sect Master-level figure, his identity was still lower compared to the Great Elder of Heaven Battling Union; after all, Heaven Battling Union and his Sect were simply not comparable.

“So what does Sect Master Lan wish to do?” Mo Xiao Sheng glanced at him faintly, his expression not betraying any emotion.

“This Lan cannot bear such an insult,” The Sect Master surnamed Lan declared angrily.

“If Sect Master Lan really cannot stand it, then you are free to attack this Flowing Flame Sand Field, perhaps you will even be able to break through the flame barrier. If you can accomplish this, this old master will definitely bring the full power of Heaven Battling Union to assist Sect Master Lan in twisting off that boy’s head!”

Hearing Mo Xiao Sheng speak so mockingly toward him, Sect Master Lan didn’t become upset, simply wearing an awkward look on his face and quickly waving his hand, “Elder Mo must be joking. This Flowing Flame Sand Field has been Shadowed Star’s Forbidden Zone since ancient times. No one can even touch it, so how is this Lan supposed to break through it?”

“Since that’s the case, then stop wasting this old master’s time with such meaningless drivel!” Mo Xiao Sheng coldly snorted.

Receiving such rebuke, Sect Master Lan’s face filled with embarrassment and could only silently retreat.

“Brother Mo, it seems we have no choice but to feign deference here,” Cheng Peng Xuan frowned while letting out a sigh.

“En, this Mo also thinks so. For now, our best option is to try to find a way to enter this Flowing Flame Sand Field, otherwise, when the Emperor Garden opens, we will definitely miss out on some opportunities. As for that High Heaven Sect... Hmph, the future is still long, we’ll let that boy have his moment and demand twice the repayment later.”

“What Brother Mo says makes sense. In the meantime, we shouldn’t remain here and continue to annoy him. If that little brat really decides to take that Origin King Grade Starship and rush to my Thunder Typhoon Sect...” Cheng Peng Xuan shivered as he thought about such a possibility before quickly shouting to his subordinates to follow him, taking the lead to withdraw.

Mo Xiao Sheng did the same.

Seeing that these two giants compromised at this junction, how could any of the other great forces dare to remain? All the assembled masters gathered their companions and disciples and quickly retreated beyond the hundred-kilometre mark Yang Kai had delimited.

At the same time, inside the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle, Yang Yan stared at a projection in front of herself and said with a grin, “Sure enough, they all retreated.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Wise choice,” Yang Kai sneered, seemingly having anticipated this scene.

It was not that Yang Kai had some kind of foresight ability, it was just that with the power High Heaven Sect had shown, these loiterers had no other choice.

Without even mentioning High Heaven Sect’s location inside the Flowing Flame Sand Field, which allowed them to sit back and relax without ever worrying about being attacked, High Heaven Sect also had its Origin King Grade Starship as a deterrent.

With just this Starship at its disposal, none dared to easily provoke High Heaven Sect.

After all, once such a provocation was made, they would spend all day on edge, worrying about that Origin King Grade Starship coming to attack them while they could not attack High Heaven Sect at all. Only being able to passively defend while unable to fight back was a strategy that could only end in defeat.

What’s more, this Origin King Grade Starship was the sole existence on Shadowed Star that could possibly do long-distance voyages.

With it, Shadowed Star could completely restore its contact with the outside world, and those masters who had reached the peak of the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm could use it to travel to other stars, escape the suppression of Shadowed Star’s World Principles, and obtain a chance to break through to the Origin King Realm.

Who among Mo Xiao Sheng, Cheng Peng Xuan, and Old Woman Feng had not had such thoughts? Which one of them did not want to take advantage of this Origin King Grade Starship?

They were all masters who had reached and been stuck at the peak of the Origin Returning Realm for countless years, so their greatest wish in life was to be able to break through to the Origin King Realm. Now that an opportunity to do just that had presented itself to them, they naturally wanted to grab hold of it tightly.

It could be said that if not for the incident on Dragon Cave Mountain, they would all be finding ways to establish a good relationship with High Heaven Sect and Yang Kai.

Unfortunately, they had torn face with High Heaven Sect along with many other great forces during the battle of Dragon Cave Mountain. Naturally, they were extremely reluctant and embarrassed to lower their heads and apologize because, if they had done so, they would become laughing stocks for the rest of their lives. Mo Xiao Sheng, Cheng Peng Xuan, and several others could only take a step back and try to stabilize their relationships with High Heaven Sect by not offending it or its interests for now. From there, they could try to find a way to slowly win over Yang Kai.

If there was a chance to resolve their grievances in the future, that would naturally be best.

If they could not though, they would definitely not just sit back and watch High Heaven Sect grow, doing everything they could to uproot and destroy it.

As people mature, they begin to look more long term rather than focusing solely on immediate gains, if this were not the case then Yang Kai’s warning alone would not be enough to force them to withdraw hundreds of kilometres away.

Everyone’s actions today were due to High Heaven Sect’s strategic location and the existence of its Origin King Grade Starship.

Since Yang Kai was well aware of his advantages, he acted with such overbearing confidence.

Although the speed of the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle was quite quick, the Flowing Flame Sand Field was also quite expansive, so it took half a day before it arrived in front of High Heaven Sect’s front gate.

After Yang Yan opened the battle shuttle’s hatch and took the lead with Ye Xi Yun, Qian Tong, Fei Zhi Tu, and Mo Yu hurriedly exited as well, each of them taking in deep breaths of the fresh air around them.

Inside the Starship just now, the atmosphere had really been quite stifling.

Each of these three was a top-level presence in their respective Sects and was famous across Shadowed Star; however, when facing Ye Xi Yun, they always felt suppressed, not daring to act aloof or to even speak casually.

Only after they left the shuttle were they able to relax somewhat, but moments later, all of them became stunned as their eyes bulged and their faces filled with shock.

Seeing the magnificent white jade steps and feeling the incredibly rich World Energy aura made each of these guests almost think that they were no longer on Shadowed Star.

“This...” Qian Tong opened his mouth to speak but was unable to form his thoughts into words.

“Senior, this is my High Heaven Sect’s headquarters. What do you think?” Yang Kai stood up beside him and introduced with a smile.

Qian Tong and the others glanced over at him speechlessly. It was only after quite some time that Qian Tong managed to say, “Little brat, why did you have to show off such a sight to us? The richness of the aura here is something this old master has never seen before in his life.”

“Yeah... this is without a doubt the best cultivation paradise on Shadowed Star,” Mo Yu also nodded solemnly, his face filled with envy. Clear Sky Sect’s headquarters was also located in a mountain range with rich World Energy aura, but compared to this place, the disparity was not small. On top of that, this was just the entranceway to the Sect, so what would it be like inside?

“These must be the ruins of some ancient Sect, yes? There’s no way you could have built such a massive headquarters in such a short time,” Fei Zhi Tu looked at Yang Kai thoughtfully.

“City Lord Fei’s insight is quite sharp. Yes, this is indeed the ruins of an ancient Sect. We are simply the doves occupying this magpie nest,” Yang Kai chuckled.

“Nonsense, you being able to occupy this place is due to your own good fortune. Even if others wanted to occupy this place, they couldn’t,” Qian Tong smiled and shook his head. He was still unable to figure out how they had so easily crossed the Flame Area just now.

Wasn’t this place a Forbidden Zone? Wasn’t it supposed to be impossible for Origin Returning Realm masters to step into this place?

“If you want to talk, we should go inside first. Why just stand around gawking at the entryway?” Ye Xi Yun said lightly before walking up the jade steps alongside Yang Yan.

Since Ye Xi Yun had spoken, no one dared disagree, all of them quickly following behind her.

Walking along the road, Qian Tong and the others secretly surveyed their surroundings and were thoroughly shocked by the richness of the World Energy aura here. A few words were exchanged now and then as the overall atmosphere remained harmonious.

Yang Kai brought up the rear, accompanied by Wei Gu Chang and the others from the younger generation, laughing and chatting with each other the whole way.

Not long after, this small group of people arrived at the Front Court of High Heaven Sect. Seeing the exquisite palaces and massive, open squares once again amazed the newcomers, and the richness of the World Energy made them unconsciously take a few more deep breaths.

Fascination and envy appeared on all their faces.

Looking up, the entire Flowing Flame Sand Field was still surrounded by the red flame barrier, but directly above the Front Court, there was actually an opening more than a dozen kilometres in size, allowing the natural sunlight to pour in.

The Emperor Garden could also be seen floating directly above.

“Please come in!” Yang Kai said aloud as he led everyone inside the reception hall.

This palace was where High Heaven Sect had decided to welcome honoured guests, and with Qian Tong and the others being their very first guests, Yang Kai would certainly not show any neglect.
