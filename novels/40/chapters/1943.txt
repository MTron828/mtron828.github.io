Time marched on and soon, ten days had passed. Yang Kai woke up from his meditation and silently sensed his physical condition before shaking his head, somewhat dissatisfied.

The slow rate at which his Saint Qi was being transformed was somewhat frustrating to him.

For an Origin King like him, the higher the proportion of Source Qi there was in his body, the higher the strength he could exert.

At this moment, only about a fifth of Yang Kai’s Saint Qi had been transformed into Source Qi, and at this rate, it would take at least another year or two to finish the conversion process.

Seeing him open his eyes, the three male prisoners in the cell all put on their best flattering smiles, but none of them dared to speak.

The brutal and overwhelming image of Yang Kai had penetrated deep into their bones and they knew that it would be simple for him to take their lives in this place. With him controlling whether they lived or died, how could they not go all out to flatter Yang Kai?

Even Liu Xian Yun was repeatedly praised and flattered by these three men over the past few days. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Although Yang Kai very much looked down on these three who bullied the weak and feared the strong, he kept them around because they were useful sources of information.

These three were able to inform him about various things regarding Blue Feather Sect and the Star Boundary as a whole.

As Yang Kai expected, Blue Feather Sect was really not a righteous Sect, but it also couldn’t be said to be an evil one. Simply put, the disciples of this Sect were unscrupulous and unruly. There was also Daybreak Pavilion nearby, which had many grievances and grudges with Blue Feather Sect, leading to constant small-scale conflicts between the two forces as they competed for resources and prestige.

Beyond Blue Feather Sect, the Star Boundary seemed to be divided into four primary territories split between south, west, north, and east. Each of these territories was unimaginably vast, to the point where even a Dao Source master could spend their entire life travelling and still not see everything in a single territory.

Within each territory, there were countless smaller provinces. Blue Feather Sect was situated in the Star Boundary’s Southern Territory, Qi Province.

Qi Province was roughly 80 million kilometres from end to end and was considered average in the Southern Territory, whether it was in terms of the number of masters or overall strength and size.

In Qi Province, forces like Blue Feather Sect were countless in number.

This information allowed Yang Kai to vividly feel the magnificence of the Star Boundary as he realized just how much wider a world it was than the Star Field. Just the words of these three had painted an epic picture before Yang Kai, causing him to yearn for that broader sky.

However, it was questionable how accurate this information was, as these three were just First-Order Origin Kings who had never even left the Qi Province before.

Still, this information was enough for Yang Kai to digest for a long time.

Right now though, Yang Kai had his brow furrowed slightly as he continued to inspect the changes inside his body.

Suddenly, Yang Kai raised his head and frowned deeply.

“Heh heh heh... kid, you’re indeed a bit unusual, even able to detect the Divine Sense of this old master!” A voice suddenly sounded in Yang Kai’s ear, one that was ethereal and untraceable.

Yang Kai remained silent as he swept his eyes around, but no matter how he looked, he was unable to notice anything from the surrounding prisoners.

“Don’t bother, this old master is locked up in the innermost depths. You can’t see me from where you’re sitting,” The voice sounded again.

After being imprisoned here for more than ten days, Yang Kai also knew that the more powerful a prisoner’s cultivation was, the deeper inside they would be imprisoned. This mysterious master said he was imprisoned in the innermost depths, so his strength obviously was not low, at least reaching the Dao Source Realm. If this weren’t the case, it would have been impossible for this master to conceal himself while still using his Divine Sense to talk to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment before asking, “Who is Senior? Is there something Senior needs to discuss with me?”

“Naturally, there is something, and it’s a good deed at that,” The voice cackled. “Since you entered this place and killed Zong Qi, this old master has been paying special attention to you. If this old master is not mistaken, you have cultivated any extremely advanced Body Tempering Secret Art, yes?”

“And so?” Yang Kai frowned, not denying it. Since the other party had been paying attention to him for some time now, there was no way Yang Kai could conceal the strength of his physique.

“If so, this old master wants you to do him a favour.”

“Senior, please speak plainly.”

“This old master wants you to free him!” the voice’s master said.

Yang Kai could not help but sneer, “Senior must be joking. Junior is a prisoner himself, how is he supposed to free you?”

“Since this old master has made this request, he has a plan,” The person coldly snorted. “I can pass you the method to unlock the seals on your body and restore your strength. With your ability, as long as you can recover the use of your cultivation, no one in this Bone Prison will be able to stop you and you can easily free this old master.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s eyes could not help but brighten up.

The mysterious person quickly spoke again, “You do not want your destiny to be controlled by others, do you? This old master’s Secret Technique can definitely allow you to free yourself!”

The words were spoken in a steady tone, but they contained an almost irresistible charm. Yang Kai almost instinctually agreed, but he was shaken awake in the next moment as he realized something was wrong. This unknown figure was definitely using some kind of mental manipulation technique to influence his thinking. Snorting coldly, Yang Kai snapped, “Senior using such tricks to tempt me, don’t you feel any shame?”

The voice laughed loudly hearing this, “Boy, you’re better than I thought! En, it was this old master’s mistake, this old master will apologize to you.”

Seeing him apologize and admit his mistake so frankly left Yang Kai speechless for a while.

After a short, dumbfounded silence, Yang Kai said, “Since you have a Secret Technique to restore your strength, why not use it yourself instead of asking for Junior’s help?”

The voice snarled, “If I could use it myself, why would I be asking you for help? This old master not only has his strength sealed, he has also been shackled with chains made from Spirit Suppressing Gold by those bastards and cannot use any Secret Techniques at all. Even if this old master were to unseal his cultivation, with these Spirit Suppressing Gold chains, he wouldn’t be able to circulate any strength!”

“So that’s how it is!” Yang Kai nodded faintly.

Although he had never heard of Spirit Suppressing Gold, from the information revealed by this unseen master, Yang Kai could tell that it was definitely some kind of metal used to impede the flow of Source Qi, otherwise, it would have been impossible to imprison a Dao Source Realm master.

“One more question: There are so many cultivators in this Bone Prison, so why did Senior choose me? With your eyesight, it should not be difficult to see that I’m not that strong, right?” Yang Kai asked cautiously.

“This old master naturally knows what kind of cultivation you possess, and there are indeed many others in this Bone Prison who are stronger, but... Spirit Suppressing Gold is impenetrable by Source Qi, only brute force can destroy it, so this old master thinks you’re the most appropriate one to ask.”

Hearing what he said, Yang Kai understood why this man had asked him whether he cultivated some kind of extremely profound Body Tempering Secret Art, it was all because of the existence of the Spirit Suppressing Gold.

Many thoughts flashed across Yang Kai’s mind.

Although he did not know who this person was, or what kind of strength he possessed, Yang Kai himself was currently imprisoned here and didn’t even know what kind of fate he would have tomorrow. If Protector Bian sent an order to execute him, Yang Kai was certain Yan Xiu Ran would happily carry out the sentence.

If he could really obtain the method to lift the seal on his body, he would at least be able to put up a fight and not simply be a fish on the chopping board.

As for whether or not to rescue the mysterious man, that would depend on how he felt at the time.

Seeing Yang Kai thinking through his offer over, the unknown man quickly struck while the iron was hot and said, “This old man will speak frankly with you. This old master is a Third-Order Dao Source cultivator, only one step away from the Emperor Realm. If you can save this old master, this old master will certainly compensate you handsomely!”

[A Third-Order Dao Source Realm master!] Yang Kai was shocked!

Senior Brother Kou who he had met before was nothing more than First-Order Dao Source Realm, but that was enough to totally suppress Yang Kai. If it were a Third-Order Dao Source Realm, Yang Kai imagined he could be killed on a whim.

Before knowing this person’s temperament, Yang Kai did not dare to rashly agree, he didn’t want to try to steal a chicken but end up losing the rice in the process.

“I know what you are worrying about, but you may rest assured, this old master is not deceiving you in any way. If you cannot believe this old master, he can swear an oath on his Soul!”

Yang Kai frowned, pondered for a moment, then said, “Junior can feel Senior’s sincerity, but this matter... let me think about it before giving an answer!”

“No rush, there is no rush, you can just ponder over it carefully!” The man cackled gratingly, not trying to urge him any further.

“By the way, dare I ask Senior’s name?”

“Wu Meng Chuan!”

Yang Kai silently memorised this man’s name as he began to consider the pros and cons between agreeing or not.

In fact, Yang Kai felt that agreeing right away in order to obtain that Secret Technique to lift the seal on his strength wasn’t a bad idea.

But with his current strength, even if he was restored to his peak, he wouldn’t be able to leave Blue Feather Sect. At that time, he would still need to rescue Wu Meng Chuan to make use of his Third-Order Dao Source strength.

However, there was no way to tell what Wu Meng Chuan would do to him once he was free.

As such, Yang Kai hesitated to give an answer.

Just as he was feeling indecisive, the sound of footsteps echoed outside the cell.

Yang Kai raised his head in amazement and frowned slightly.

Every day, at exactly the same time, he would be taken out by the two guards and tortured, but the hour had yet to arrive for today’s ‘session’.

Yang Kai did not know what the guards wanted with him to come early today.

A moment later, the two guards who had been responsible for torturing Yang Kai appeared at the door to the cell with a strange expression on their faces. After opening the cell, they motioned to Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun, “You two, come out!”

Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun exchanged a glance but did not try to resist and simply stood up obediently.

Liu Xian Yun’s tender body trembled slightly as she subconsciously thought that she would be subjected to the same torture as Yang Kai.

On the other hand, Yang Kai asked thoughtfully, “Do two friends have instructions for us?”

One of the two guards swept his eyes over Yang Kai and grinned, “It seems your luck is changing. Protector Bian wants to see you.”

“Protector Bian!” Yang Kai frowned.

Being locked here for more than ten days without any word from Protector Bian, Yang Kai thought that the other party was disinclined to even bother with him and Liu Xian Yun, but now it seems he was mistaken.

Regardless of why the other party wanted to see them, Yang Kai knew that an opportunity was about to present itself before him.

Turning to Liu Xian Yun, Yan Kai found the other party’s beautiful eyes had also lit up slightly, obviously also aware of what this change meant.
