Chapter 1640, No Choice But To Accept

Not long after, Wei Qing returned with a young man.

This young man had good looks, but his sallow complexion and the dark circles under his eyes ruined his appearance. On top of that, at a glance, it was obvious he was the type to indulge in wine and women, putting up a strong front while actually being weak and cowardly.

When he came here, the young man was shivering and his face was pale as he constantly kept gulping, his eyes glancing towards Chi Huo in fear and horror.

Although he was already an Origin Returning Realm cultivator, he behaved like an ordinary mortal without the strength to truss up a chicken, hiding behind Wei Qing as if trying to seek shelter, not daring to face Chi Huo directly.

Chi Huo glanced at him and coldly snorted, a look of contempt and disdain clearly covering his face.

“Supreme Elder, I’ve brought Feng’er,” Wei Qing said helplessly.

“Good, you may leave,” Chi Huo waved his hand at Wei Qing.

Wei Qing opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but he remained silent in the end, simply sighing while looking back at his son and shaking his head slowly before quickly leaving.

Wei Feng immediately fell into a panic as he watched his father’s disappearing back and cried out, “Father...”

“Shut up!” Chi Huo shouted.

Wei Feng was so frightened he nearly collapsed to the ground in terror as he struggled to turn his head and look at Chi Huo, his face lacking any form of colour.

He had no idea why the Supreme Elder had summoned him. He had an extraordinary status in Brilliant Flame Sect and could rely on his father’s power and strength to do as he pleased, but before the Supreme Elder, he was not worth a fart.

If the Supreme Elder wanted to kill him, even his father could not do anything.

“Su... Supreme... Elder... disciple has... has spent the p... p... past few days be... behind closed doors, c... cultivating i... in the Sect. I... I haven’t made a... any mistakes, p... please understand... Supreme Elder... don’t... don’t kill me... please!” Wei Feng stuttered and fumbled over his words as he whimpered like a baby, snot dripping from his nose as he knelt on the ground and kowtowed vigorously, knocking his head against the ground repeatedly.

The contempt and disgust in Chi Huo’s eyes rapidly grew stronger.

Luo Hai on the side also slowly shook his head, frowning as he said, “Wei Qing is worthy of being the future pillar of Brilliant Flame Sect, so how did his son end up as such a waste?”

“Defeated by a loving mother!” Chi Huo coldly snorted as he angrily glared at Wei Feng and shouted, “This old master orders you to stand up!”

Wei Feng yelped in panic but dared not refuse, quickly getting to his feet but still hunching over as his tears continued to pour down while he squeezed out a flattering smile, his face an utter ugly mess.

“Can you not even stand up straight you good-for-nothing waste?!” Chi Huo’s heart filled with grievances as he stepped forward and slapped Wei Feng twice.

With two crisp slaps, Wei Feng felt that his face had been beaten out of shape and gone completely numb.

Chi Huo was an Origin King Realm master, so even if he did not use any of his cultivation’s power, a casual slap would be enough to shatter Wei Feng’s body. Fortunately, Chi Huo still had a use for Wei Feng, so he couldn’t kill the latter here.

Grabbing Wei Feng’s neck and lifting him up like a butchered chicken, Chi Huo said coldly, “Boy, today is your lucky day. Weren’t you obsessed with a certain female disciple from Ice Heart Valley? This old master is going to bring you to Pure Ice Island to obtain her!”

“Huh?” Wei Feng wore a blank look as he stared at Chi Huo, seemingly never having expected the Supreme Elder to have called him here for this.

After a moment of stunned silence, Wei Feng became overjoyed and said eagerly, “Does Supreme Elder really mean it?”

Su Yan’s exquisite face, which seemed to be carved from the purest ice jade, suddenly flashed before his eyes, causing Wei Feng to tremble with excitement.

“Do you think this Supreme Elder will crack a joke with you?” Chi Huo snickered.

“But... but what if Ice Heart Valley refuses to give her up?” Wei Feng asked.

“They have no choice but to accept. Regardless of anything else, you are still the son of my Brilliant Flame Sect’s Sect Master and possess extraordinary status. Marrying you is an extreme honour for a mere Ice Heart Valley female disciple. Even if they want to refuse, they won’t be able to!”

“That’s right, that’s right...” Wei Feng’s excitement had completely overwhelmed his fear and he repeatedly nodded to Chi Huo and began to fantasize about all the things he would do once he obtained Su Yan, a stupid and obscene grin appearing on his face.

Luo Hai watched faintly from the side and shook his head slowly.

He naturally understood why Chi Huo was doing this, it was nothing more than another method to suppress and humiliate Ice Heart Valley.

Chi Huo was using this opportunity to borrow from Luo Hai’s prestige, something he had admitted to a moment ago.

But Luo Hai did not care. The struggles on Scarlet Wave Star had nothing to do with him. He came here only for Yang Kai. Since Chi Huo only wanted to make use of his power to gain a small advantage, Luo Hai was willing to accept.

After he ate the meat, Luo Hai could not stop Chi Huo from drinking the soup. As long as Chi Huo didn’t pursue the real reason he wanted to find Yang Kai, Luo Hai wouldn’t object.

“Brother Luo Hai, let’s go!” Chi Huo turned to Luo Hai while still gripping Wei Feng in his hand.

Luo Hai nodded and the two immediately turned into streams of light, disappearing from the bamboo forest and flying straight towards Pure Ice Island which was a few million kilometres away.

—

Pure Ice Island, the Outer Island.

Yang Kai was sitting in meditation in the guest room he was provided while trying to think of a way to meet with Su Yan.

He couldn’t set foot on the Inner Island, so if he wanted to meet Su Yan, he had to somehow get her to come to the Outer Island.

However, Yang Kai soon realized that Su Yan had no intention to come out and meet him as her aura remained essentially stationary somewhere on the Inner Island.

[Is she at a critical point in her cultivation and cannot move?] Yang Kai was puzzled. If it were not for her cultivation being at some kind of turning point, he was certain Su Yan would have come out to see him by now.

Yang Kai never suspected that Su Yan was not at a critical juncture in her cultivation but had been put under house arrest by Ran Yun Ting. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

But now that he was here on Pure Ice Island and knew that Su Yan was only a few hundred kilometres away, Yang Kai no longer felt rushed.

There would certainly be a moment when they reunited.

After their last spiritual communication was disturbed, Yang Kai did not dare to reach out to Su Yan in the same manner. He was a mere guest here while Su Yan was in the Sect’s inner sanctuary, if he acted rashly, it would only backfire on him.

And so, he waited patiently for the right opportunity.

The next day, Yang Kai was still sitting in meditation when suddenly he opened his eyes and called out loudly, “I don’t know which Senior has come, but Junior offers his humble greetings.”

A soft voice came from outside the door, “This Queen is Ice Heart Valley’s Valley Master.”

A hint of surprise flashed across Yang Kai’s eyes; although he knew that there would definitely be a high-level Elder from Ice Heart Valley coming to meet him at some point, he hadn’t expected the one to come would be the Valley Master herself!

Ice Heart Valley’s Bing Long was a character Yang Kai had heard about from Qing Ya. Bing Long was the strongest master beneath Ice Heart Valley’s Supreme Elder Luo Li and was rumoured to be on the verge of breaking through to the Origin King Realm.

Did Ice Heart Valley really take his existence so seriously?

With a wave of his hand, Yang Kai opened the front door and stood up solemnly to greet this visitor.

Two women walked in from outside, both beautiful middle-aged women. The one in front wore a temperate but dignified smile and exuded a type of noble grace as she lightly stepped forward.

However, the woman who followed wore an ice-cold expression, and even though this was the first time they had met, Yang Kai could sense some inexplicable hostility coming from her.

Yang Kai frowned and wondered why this woman seemed to have a prejudice against him.

Bing Long stopped ten metres in front of Yang Kai, swept her eyes over him, and gently asked, “Are you Yang Kai?”

“Junior Yang Kai greets Senior Bing Long!” Yang Kai cupped his fists.

Bing Long nodded lightly, “Truly a dragon amongst men, your aura is calm yet profound, no wonder you were able to kill Jiang Xi and Yan Chi Lei so easily. For the act of saving Junior Sister Yu, this Queen offers her sincere thanks.”

Yang Kai shook his head and replied politely, “Junior was simply protecting himself; Valley Master need not be so polite.”

After saying so, Yang Kai turned a curious look at the beautiful woman behind Bing Long and asked, “This is...”

“This is my Ice Heart Valley’s Great Elder!” Bing Long introduced.

Yang Kai raised his brow as he realized that this beautiful woman was actually Su Yan’s master!

And judging from her aura, Yang Kai could tell that she was the one who interfered with the spiritual connection between him and Su Yan yesterday!

[She seemed to have a deep prejudice and hostility towards me... Have I done something to offend her?] Yang Kai frowned in confusion.

Even thinking so, Yang Kai still cupped his fists again and said, “So it is Great Elder, Junior has been disrespectful!”

Ran Yun Ting just snorted coldly, not reciprocating any politeness with Yang Kai.

A trace of astonishment flashed across Bing Long’s eyes as she saw this and wondered what Great Elder was trying to do here, but she hurriedly took control of the conversation, “Great Elder and I have arrived here uninvited, please don’t take offence.”

“Valley Master must be joking; this is Pure Ice Island. This Junior is merely a guest here. Junior should be apologizing for failing to take the initiative to visit and offer his greetings.”

A hint of approval appeared on Bing Long’s face. She felt that Yang Kai was not only a cultivation genius but was also quite humble and polite, vastly different from other rising stars of the younger generation. Most of the so-called young handsome men had eyes atop their heads and acted insufferably arrogantly, doing whatever they wanted and parading around their strength as if they hoped everyone would know their strength. These young rising stars all seemed to lack the virtue of respecting the old and caring for the young.

Bing Long’s first impression of Yang Kai was quite good.

Bing Long and Ran Yun Ting then sat down at a small ice table with Yang Kai while a female disciple from Ice Heart Valley served tea.

Yang Kai did not know why these two had come here at this time, so he didn’t dare speak rashly, simply sipping his tea while waiting quietly for them to reveal their purpose.

Ran Yun Ting on the other hand had been glaring at Yang Kai since he took his seat, as if she was trying to pierce him with her sharp gaze.

Fortunately, Bing Long took the initiative to make some small talk with Yang Kai, asking him a few irrelevant questions to lighten the atmosphere.

After a cup of tea, Bing Long suddenly asked, “Little Brother Yang is not a Scarlet Wave Star cultivator, right?”

Yang Kai knew that she was trying to obtain some background information on him, but he didn’t have a reason to conceal something so simple so he nodded and replied, “Indeed, I am not from Scarlet Wave Star.”

“Then where does Little Brother Yang come from?”

“My homeland is Tong Xuan Realm!”

“Tong Xuan Realm?” Bing Long frowned, apparently never having heard of such a place.

On the other hand, Ran Yun Ting’s phoenix eyes narrowed, and a faint light flashed across their depths.

Bing Long had never heard of Tong Xuan Realm, but she had.

After all, Su Yan also came from Tong Xuan Realm!

[This brat really is the one who sullied Su Yan’s innocence! This little animal is preventing her from reaching the peak of the Martial Dao!]

A faint murderous intent began leaking from her body as Ran Yun Ting thought of this, and although it was extremely faint, Bing Long still noticed it. After shooting a glance towards Ran Yun Ting suspiciously, Bing Long found that Yang Kai seemed to be unaware of this ill-intent so she did not make a fuss and instead smiled slightly, “It looks like this Queen is somewhat ignorant and uninformed as she has never heard of such a star before.”

“Senior need not improperly belittle herself, my homeland is extremely barren and has no contact with the wider Star Field, so it is normal to not have heard of it.”
