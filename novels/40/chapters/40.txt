Chapter 41 - Tempered body eighth stage

“I don’t know.......are you this powerful in other places too.” Hu Mei Er’s sharp and watery eyes looked at Kai Yang mysteriously, her words explicitly clear.

This type of open and brazen enticement, as long as it was a male, then I’m afraid they wouldn’t be able to resist. Not to mention Hu Mei Er, because she was also quite attractive, her figure was not bad. So many people were already thinking about it.

A series of sounds came from all directions, the sound of people simultaneously swallowing their saliva. Su Mu’s group of people were already weak in body, now with this type of stimulation, their blood rushed to their heads, their lower parts stuck up, while some fainted on scene.

(TL: Blood rushed to my head too........T_T, man.......) Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Kai Yang also felt a burning sensation rise upwards, his adam’s apple bobbed a bit. His breathing became rough, and his grip on Hu Mei Er’s neck involuntarily increased in strength.

Hu Mei Er delicately gasped, her body squirmed a bit before angrily speaking: “Why do you still not let go?”

While she said that, she also reached out a tender hand to gently prise open Kai Yang’s hand. It’s unknown whether it was an accident or if it was on purpose, all in all she had moved Kai Yang’s hand and placed it on her plump and well-rounded chest.

An astonishing amount of elasticity and warmth passed on through his hand, and Kai Yang clearly felt a defined peak from the palm of his hand. This type of stimulation cause the blood flowing from his wounds to increase a bit.

Kai Yang’s face was somewhat red, he had never imagined that his woman would be licentious to this degree. She really was ah, she most definitely possessed some ulterior move with this flirtatious behaviour today.

When she saw Kai Yang’s embarrassment, Hu Mei Er unexpectedly started to laugh. Exhaling she said: “What do you want to do?”

As Kai Yang looked down at Hu Mei Er, he felt like a dog that had bit a hedgehog. Thinking back to the start of the battle, this Hu Mei Er really didn’t attack any of the Sky Tower Pavilion disciples so Kai Yang naturally couldn’t hit her. The only reason he wanted to give this woman a lesson was because she had been constantly fanning the flames during the battle.

But because he was this easily toyed with by her, Kai Yang was somewhat annoyed. Kai Yang after all was still a man, how could he be so easily played around with by her?

As he thought over it, Kai Yang’s hand that was covering Hu Mei Er’s hand suddenly squeezed tighter. T_T

“En...........” Hu Mei Er’s expression changed as she moaned out, looking at that handsome face hers turned red. Angrily she glared at Kai Yang, for she would never have imagined he would harbour such feelings towards females.

(TL: Old man Meng’s teachings are coming in)

Laughing out loudly, Kai Yang stood up and said to Hu Mei Er: “You can go.”

Hu Mei Er stared blankly ahead before looking dazedly at Kai Yang. She would have never expected that her seductions would have almost no effect. Her body, it was unknown how many people wished to have a taste. On ordinary days, there were numerous rivals that she didn’t even pay attention to. But today, when there was finally a male that she held some interest in, when she had tried to seduce him, she was actually disregarded by him.

Is he still a man?

After standing there for a few moments, she started to laugh. With a multitudinous array of movements, she got up from the ground. Towards Kai Yang, she nibbled her red lips. Walking over to Kai Yang’s side, she gently blew into his ear and whispered: “You are very interesting!”

Once she finished speaking, she chuckled and turned around to leave not forgetting to use her thousand way swaying of the hips technique.

From afar, Su Mu’s lot were watching stupidly, their eyes full of jealousy and envy. They didn’t think that Kai Yang would actually refuse this type of good luck. They were all thinking that if it was them who were in that situation, what would they do?

They would have probably pounced! No, no, no they would have definitely pounced. The good luck of meat pastries dropping from the sky, why would they refuse it? In any case, they wouldn’t have lost anything.

After Hu Mei Er left, everybody then turned their heads back to Kai Yang, feeling both sad and embarrassed.

Ai.........many sighs rang out.

Kai Yang squatted down, and went to rip a few strips of cloth off the bodies of the fainted disciples from Storm House. Then he went to roll the cloth strips around his own hands a few times.

Looking at Su Mu’s group, these junior disciples all had faces full of embarrassment.

“Do you still have the strength to walk?” Kai Yang asked.

They nodded their heads slightly.

“Then walk.”

The entire group had bloody noses and swollen faces, as they returned to Sky Tower Pavilion with great difficulty before dispersing to find their own medicines and seek out treatment. Although they had fought a great battle today, it was only a battles between juniors. And the three powers would often have such fights between each other, so there was nothing special about it.

Also long as nobody important died, the respective elders of each faction would turn a blind eye and ask no questions. Only through battles, would one improve, and every faction elder wished for this kind of tempering to occur so as to allow for improvement in the strength of their juniors.

Kai Yang returned to his little wooden hut, as he had planned to take out that remaining blood clotting cream. But after thinking it over, he discarded the idea.

During today’s events, the only serious injury he received was the one on his hand that had been pierced by the long sabre, the rest were nothing really. Although the wound on his hand looked really serious at first, when you looked more carefully, you could see it wasn’t that major. When he went to catch Cheng Shao Feng’s sabre, Kai Yang purposefully avoided allowing it to pierce his bones or meridians. So although there was an extra hole in his palm, it was only a simple flesh wound.

It was literally the same type of wound that he had received from that flower patterned spider. It had taken him roughly three-fours days to basically recover, so should be the same this time too.

In addition, in just this short amount of time, Kai Yang’s wound had already healed by quite a lot, and his stamina had also recovered by a bit. Without sensing his body condition, he wouldn’t have guessed that the warmth emitted by the golden body also contained healing properties. And that the True Yang Tactics, Yang qi also contained a small amount of healing properties. With the assistance of these two, his injuries recovered quickly.

After he learnt that the True Yang Tactic’s Yang qi contained healing properties, Kai Yang quickly drifted over to Coiling Dragon Stream to absorb the Yang qi. Although in the battle today, he didn’t use a single bit of that drop of Yang energy, he had used up quite a bit of his body’s Yang qi. He urgently needed to replenish it.

Just as he was absorbing the Yang qi, Kai Yang felt a drumming from within his body. Uncontrollably, the outside Yang qi surged into his body, and within a moment, the amount he had absorbed was equal to one or two days worth at his previous speed. Not only was his Yang qi replenished from today’s fight, it was also even richer than before and his meridians and channels had also strengthened and expanded by a fair amount.

Tempered body eight stage? Turning his body around, Kai Yang’s face held a happy expression.

He had reached the tempered body eight stage in such a short amount of time, it came as no small surprise to him. He had originally estimated that it would take at least another seven to eight days before he would breakthrough.

For such a thing to occur, it was clearly related to Kai Yang’s battle today. As expected, battling with others really helped you improve quickly.

His heart happy, Kai Yang began to cultivate his True Yang Tactics even more diligently than before. After he had broken through a level, the speed at which he absorbed the Yang qi had clearly increased by a lot and furthermore overall his abilities were strengthened.

At nighttime Kai Yang returned to his wooden hut to rest. In the end, he had still received several injuries today, so it wasn’t the right time to pull an all-nighter in order to cultivate.

Over the next couple of days, apart from eating and sleeping, Kai Yang spent all his time near Coiling Dragon Stream in order to cultivate.

On the other hand, Su Mu’s group, not a single one of them had popped out. It was probably because they were all still nursing their injuries.

Early in the morning a few days later, just as Kai Yang was sweeping the grounds, he saw Su Mu leading Li Yun Tian and the others over towards him; all those who had participated in the battle that day, not a single one was missing. They were all valiant and full of vigour following behind Su Mu.

Although they had recuperated well over these past few days, their appearances were still a bit miserable, their eyes were bruised, mouths were swollen and overall they appeared very comical.

Looking over, Kai Yang couldn’t help but say: “Junior Su, is your skin itching again?”

(TLN: This is similar to saying are you itching for a beating again? Lol)

p.s. Heyo again! Well this chapter was another hurdle to tl, :P. Really Hu Mei Er starting to remind both Ben and I of a certain lady in TDG with her persistence and usage of her sex appeal. Just read all your comments and whoa, all those about berserk and blood sucking. Unfortunately, as you just read that doesn’t happen. Though...............as a spoiler, here’s the next chapter title - Chapter 42 - That day......ke.....you touched right? Hmmmm, I wonder what happens here????
