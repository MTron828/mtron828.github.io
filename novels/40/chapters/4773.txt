In the short span of time taken to boil a cup of tea, two out of the five-man team had been captured. Only three of them remained!

Such a situation was something they never expected. They believed that preparing the Heaven Sealing Earth Locking Grand Array in advance would prevent Yang Kai from using his Instantaneous Movement Secret Technique, thereby allowing them to attack him all together. It was supposed to be the final blow that determined their victory! Who could have known that Yang Kai would retaliate so fiercely!?

Le Mang said solemnly, “Junior Brothers, Yang Kai is bound to return. We only have three people left, but we still stand a fighting chance. If he appears again, don’t leave Void Flower Spirit Province no matter what!”

Both of them nodded heavily, “Rest assured, Eldest Senior Brother!”

They had only just finished responding when they detected the fluctuations of Space Principles. Sure enough, Yang Kai had appeared again!

Yang Kai approached Le Mang and the two others in a few quick steps.

Le Mang quickly asked, “How are Junior Brother Feng and Junior Brother Yun?”

Yang Kai smiled, “They are fine, but shouldn’t you be worrying about yourselves?”

Taking a deep breath, Le Mang summoned a longsword into his hand and pointed at Yang Kai, “No matter what happens, I will never let you succeed again!”

“That… will depend on whether or not you have the ability!”

When Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, his figure launched towards the three of them like an arrow that was released from its string. At the same time, his World Force burst out like a tsunami and caused a pressure wave that was visible to the naked eye to spread out into the surroundings.

Le Mang and his two Junior Brothers roared in defiance. Activating the power of their Small Universes, they struggled desperately to block their enemy’s advance; however, their efforts were in vain!

Three figures were sent flying in three separate directions following the initial clash!

Le Mang finally stabilised his body with some difficulty. Looking over, he immediately felt as though his eyes were about to pop out from their sockets.

Yang Kai had set his sights on one of his two Junior Brothers and was indiscriminately bombarding him with attacks! Accordingly, this Junior Brother was steadily being forced back. It was the exact situation that Junior Brother Feng had experienced earlier!

Le Mang shouted, “Hold on, Junior Brother Peng!”

His figure shifted as he hurriedly pursued Yang Kai.

At this moment, Junior Brother Peng was filled with a deep sense of bitterness. When he previously saw Yang Kai forcing Junior Brother Feng out of Void Flower Spirit Province with ease, he had believed that Junior Brother Feng had been too careless. It was not until he actually faced Yang Kai that he understood. Junior Brother Feng was not being careless. The gap between their strength was simply too large!

Yang Kai bore down on him from the front with crushing momentum, and no matter how he tried to resist, he could not fight back. He felt as though his Small Universe was about to collapse with every single collision of their World Forces.

Under this violent offensive, he had no choice but to retreat even if he was unwilling!

He distinctly saw Senior Brother Le Mang’s figure transforming into a stream of light and chasing after him. Nevertheless, it was obvious that it was too late. Under the tremendous pressure from Yang Kai, he was quickly forced out of Void Flower Spirit Province like a duckweed caught in the rapids.

[It’s over!] His heart thumped hard in his chest. Staring helplessly at Yang Kai’s large hand stretching out to fill his vision, he was unable to resist at all. His previous confrontation with Yang Kai had caused his Small Universe to be greatly shaken, so his power could not flow smoothly!

In the next moment, everybody watched as Yang Kai grabbed Junior Brother Peng by the neck and dragged the latter away like he was picking up a common chicken to be slaughtered.

Le Mang and the other Junior Brother stood at the edge of Void Flower Spirit Province, watching everything unfolding before them but being helpless to do anything. Their expressions were filled with despair.

The Open Heaven Realm Masters of Lang Ya Paradise who had been communicating unceasingly via their Divine Senses all this while suddenly sank into silence at this moment.

They initially thought that the outcome of this battle would be difficult to predict, but judging by the current circumstances, things were not looking optimistic for Lang Ya Paradise. Be that as it may, this outcome was very difficult for them to accept. Yang Kai had defeated all the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in Lang Ya Paradise with his strength alone.

“Junior Brother Dai!” Le Mang took a deep breath, “There’s only the two of us left, but we still have a chance! Yang Kai will definitely come again! Don’t let your guard down!”

Junior Brother Dai was sorrowful, “Eldest Senior Brother, that’s what you said earlier.”

[Then, Junior Brother Peng was kidnapped... Even when we had three people, we were not his opponents. What can we do now that there are only the two of us left!?] It was not that his mental strength was lacking, it was just that he could not muster the strength when faced with an opponent like Yang Kai!

Le Mang shouted, “Junior Brother Dai, the honour or disgrace of Lang Ya Paradise lies in our hands. You need to get yourself together!”

Realisation suddenly struck Junior Brother Dai. His eyes instantly filled with fighting spirit, and he nodded repeatedly, “Got it, Eldest Senior Brother!”

Half an incense stick’s time later... Le Mang stared into the Void with a blank gaze.

There was nobody next to him. Junior Brother Feng, Junior Brother Yun, Junior Brother Peng, and even Junior Brother Dai had all been captured...

Such desolate loneliness! But, so what if that was the case? Even if he had to fight alone, he would never be discouraged! With so many Junior Brothers and Junior Sisters watching him, as the Eldest Senior Brother, Le Mang had to set a good example for the others.

Reaching this enlightenment, Le Mang’s aura abruptly began to swell. The wind and the clouds in Void Flower Spirit Province swirled and all the World Energy in the Spirit Province became agitated and flooded towards him.

The illusory phantom of a Universe World suddenly appeared behind him, but the Universe World was extremely distorted and ever-changing. Following the rise of his aura, the ethereal Universe World showed signs of becoming solid.

“That is...” Somebody among the crowd suddenly exclaimed, “What is happening to Eldest Senior Brother?”

“Eldest Senior Brother is going to advance into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm! Look at his Small Universe! It’s showing signs of materializing!”

“Hahahaha! That Bastard is dead meat now! No matter how powerful he is, how can he be the opponent of a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master!?”

“Advancing into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm is not that simple. Eldest Senior Brother probably just grasped the opportunity for a breakthrough and is showing signs of advancement. He needs to enter retreat immediately. Only when his Small Universe fully materializes can he be considered to have truly advanced into the next Order!” An Open Heaven Realm Master of Lang Ya Paradise who had some understanding of how to advance from the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm explained.

“Even so, Eldest Senior Brother will now possess some heritage of the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm. The power he can wield is definitely above that of a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Even if Yang Kai is powerful, he might not be Eldest Senior Brother’s opponent.”

“That’s right! It will now depend on how much strength Eldest Senior Brother can exert.”

“Sect Master has arrived!” Somebody shouted all of a sudden.

The advancement of a disciple from the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm was not a trivial matter, especially for somebody like Le Mang. Furthermore, Li Yuan Wang had always been monitoring this training, so he knew about everything that was taking place here.

Following the emergence of Li Yuan Wang’s figure, the hundreds of Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters bowed in unison, “Greetings, Sect Master, Vice Sect Master!”

Li Yuan Wang did not come alone. He was accompanied by Gao Ting. Nodding lightly in acknowledgement, he gestured for them to be at ease. Only then did he turn to look at Le Mang below.

Upon sensing Li Yuan Wang’s gaze, Le Mang looked up and cupped his fist, “Disciples greets Sect Master, Vice Sect Master!”

Li Yuan Wang asked in concern, “How confident are you?”

Comprehending the opportunity to advance into the next Order did not mean that one could successfully complete the breakthrough. There was no saying whether an unexpected accident might occur during the process.

The transformation of one’s Small Universe from immaterial to material was no different from stepping over the threshold. Only by overcoming this threshold could a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master advance into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm. Unfortunately, many Open Heaven Realm Masters failed to cross this chasm.

Le Mang replied, “Disciple is confident!”

“Good!” Li Yuan Wang nodded, “But, before that, you should end this training.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Le Mang nodded and quickly said, “I will not disappoint you, Sect Master!” Turning his head to look at somebody among the crowd, he pointed with his longsword, “Junior Brother Yang, this Senior Brother is in a hurry to enter retreat. Let’s get this over with quickly.”

Unbeknownst to the others, Yang Kai had appeared in that direction at some point of time.

Most of the Open Heaven Realm Masters in the surroundings had been focused on Le Mang, so they had failed to notice Yang Kai’s presence and it was not until this moment that they saw him.

On the other hand, Le Mang had comprehended the opportunity for advancement. At this moment, his strength could no longer be judged simply by the standards of the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. His strength was already beyond the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, though still below the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm.

His words and attitude conveyed great self-confidence. His confidence infected the Open Heaven Realm Masters of Lang Ya Paradise, causing them to become extremely excited.

Yang Kai abruptly turned to look at Li Yuan Wang, “Sect Master Li, with Senior Brother Le Mang’s current condition, will there be any aftereffects if he were injured?”

Li Yuan Wang pondered in silence for a moment, “Go easy on him!”

Many of the disciples turned pale. [Why do the Sect Master’s words sound so much like he is favouring the outsider instead?]

Before they could understand the situation, Yang Kai broke out into a grin, “Since you are in a hurry, Senior Brother, I will do as you request!”

He shifted his body and charged towards Le Mang.

Immediately after that, all the Open Heaven Realm Masters in Lang Ya Paradise witnessed an incredible scene.

Le Mang, who now wielded strength beyond the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, suffered a fate no different from the rest of his comrades. He was overwhelmed and suppressed by the storm of attacks from Yang Kai, which gave him no time to catch his breath. In fact, he didn’t even have the strength to fight back.

Even Le Mang himself looked like he had seen a ghost!

He knew about the gap in strength between him and Yang Kai; after all, he had been defeated once in the past already. It was just that he was different from before. He had already comprehended the opportunity to advance into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, so his strength was much greater than before.

[I can’t believe nothing has changed!] It was not until this moment that he realised something. He had always underestimated Yang Kai. Yang Kai’s strength as a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was not something that could be judged using common sense. As the saying went, ‘There are always people beyond people out there’!

In front of everybody’s eyes, Yang Kai continuously advanced while Le Mang steadily fell back. The moment the two of them left Void Flower Spirit Province, they disappeared out of sight together.

In the void where many Open Heaven Realm Masters of Lang Ya Paradise gathered, a blanket of dead silence filled the air! Such an outcome was very difficult to accept.

An energy fluctuation from the collision of World Forces seemed to come from afar before it was quickly extinguished.

A short while later, Le Mang flew over from that direction with a bruised and swollen face. He cupped his fist and said, “Sect Master, Disciple will enter retreat now.”

Li Yuan Wang nodded, “Go on, but don’t be impatient. You only need to allow nature to take its course.”

“Yes!” Le Mang nodded.

Meanwhile, the Open Heaven Realm Masters of Lang Ya Paradise were so stunned that they were in a daze. At this point, the situation was clear. Senior Brother Le Mang had lost, and Void Land’s Lord Yang Kai had single-handedly defeated all the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in Lang Ya Paradise.

Hence, their faces burned with shame!

They looked towards Li Yuan Wang only to see that his expression was calm and collected. He didn’t seem to care that his disciples had failed so miserably, which only made them feel even more ashamed with themselves.

It was just... This training was over, so why was the Sect Master not announcing the results? Based on his appearance and demeanour, he seemed to be waiting for something.

The same seemed to be true even for Vice Sect Master Gao Ting who was standing by the side.

The Open Heaven Realm Masters in Lang Ya Paradise were confused and puzzled. However, as long as the Sect Master and Vice Sect Master said nothing, they did not dare to say anything either. As such, they could only stand there quietly.
