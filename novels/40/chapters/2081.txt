Taking in this spectacle, a blank expression appeared on the old man’s face as he stared at Yang Kai’s figure in shock.

During the past two days of defending against the Demon Qi invasion, he found that Yang Kai was Maplewood City’s newest Dao Source Realm Master. Nevertheless, he never expected Yang Kai to be this powerful.

He could clearly sense the Space Force fluctuations radiating from the Secret Technique Yang Kai had just unleashed. Didn’t this mean that Yang Kai was already able to harness Space Force?

He could no longer be treated as an ordinary Dao Source Realm cultivator.

Originally, the old man didn’t care much about Yang Kai, assuming that he was just a young and newly promoted master. However, after witnessing this Secret Technique, the old man had no choice but to regard Yang Kai in a new light.

Right at this moment, a shout rang out from below them. “Two sirs, there’s... there’s a slight problem with the Spirit Array repairs.”

The old man frowned. Looking down, he immediately shouted back in response. “What’s the problem?”

“It’s like this, Senior Qin...” The Array Master wore an awkward expression as he quickly continued, “If we want to close that hole, there cannot be powerful energies in the area that would interfere with the repair!”

“What do you mean?” The old man replied with a frown; although he was a Dao Source Realm Master, he didn’t have a good understanding of Spirit Arrays. Naturally, he didn’t know what the Array Master was trying to imply.

“In other words, if you two sirs are to continue fighting against those demonic creatures where the hole is, it will be impossible for us to repair the Spirit Array!” A look of unease appeared on the Array Master’s face.

“Useless!” The old man roared out in anger, “Are you trying to say that it’s simply impossible to repair the Spirit Array?”

Feeling the anger radiating from the old man, the Array Master’s eyes shrunk in fear before he replied weakly, “That isn’t the case. As long as you two sirs can shift the battlefield to another location, it will not hinder the repairs.”

“Where to?” The old man asked in a deep voice.

The Array Master’s face scrunched up in embarrassment. “You two sirs might have to go outside the Spirit Array...”

Before he could finish his sentence, old man Qin had already roared out in fury. “Bullshit! If that’s the case, isn’t it just a death sentence?”

The reason Maplewood City was still relatively unscathed was that the attacks launched by the Demoni Qi yesterday were relatively weak, and the Spirit Array was sufficient to hold those attacks off.

If he really left the protection of the Spirit Array to engage in combat against the Demon Qi and demonic creatures, it wouldn’t take long for him to get corrupted by the Demon Qi, transforming into a demon with his consciousness lost forever.

“Please calm down, senior Qin. It’s all due to my inadequate skills.” The Array Master also knew that his suggestion was ridiculous for anyone to accomplish. However, just as the cultivation realms of the cultivators in Maplewood City were rather mediocre, the might of the Array Masters were simply ordinary.

If they wanted to repair the damage, they couldn’t get disrupted by any powerful sources of energy near the area of repairs.

If Yang Kai and old man Qin were to engage in endless combat against the demonic creatures, they would be utterly incapable of doing anything.

“I’ll go, Old Sir Qin!” Yang Kai suddenly spoke up.

“You will?” Upon hearing this, old man Qin turned around to look at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai replied with a smile. “Since we need to shift the battlefield in order for the Spirit Array to get repaired, there’s no other way.”

A sliver of worry flashed across old man Qin’s face as said worriedly, “Are you sure about this, Little Brother? If you head out of the Spirit Array’s protective radius, you’ll be entering enemy lines alone. The Demon Qi can’t be easily defended against. If anything untoward were to happen...”

“I can’t guarantee anything, but I’ll know when I try,” Yang Kai smiled faintly. “If we don’t take care of this now, the city will get invaded the moment we become exhausted and run out of strength.”

After hearing Yang Kai’s reply, old man Qin also knew that there was truly no other way but to head out of the hole. Clenching his teeth, he quickly said, “Since that’s the case, let this old man go along with you, Little Brother. Hmph, as the saying goes, how can men be brave if they don’t dare to go into the tiger’s den? This old man really wants to see whether the Demon Qi will erode his consciousness!”

Yang Kai failed to stifle his laughter as he replied, “If old sir Qin were to head out there, how would the people below deal with any small fry that manages to get past?”

“About that...” Old man Qing gawked in speechlessness.

With a stern expression, Yang Kai gave his reply. “I’ll take the lead, while old sir Qin will stand guard in the rear.”

Knowing that Yang Kai wouldn’t back down from his words, old man Qin sighed and said, “Then you must be very careful, Little Brother. If you feel that your strength is waning... just retreat back into the city.”

Yang Kai nodded his head.

“If we succeed in doing this, I will definitely give a report to the City Lord, and make sure he acknowledges your contribution!” Old man Qin quickly said.

Declining to comment, Yang Kai flickered away towards the hole.

At once, old man Qin stepped up while roaring out loudly, “Repair the Spirit Array with the greatest speed you can muster! If you can’t complete the repairs on the Spirit Array within a quarter-hour, this old man will throw all of you Array Masters outside!”

Miserable expressions immediately appeared on the few Array Masters below. Nevertheless, they didn’t dare to utter any retort as they hastily started to repair the Spirit Array.

Right as Yang Kai exited the city, he felt that he had entered another world; a world without light, engulfed in endless darkness. The jet-black Qi that flowed all around his body possessed terrifying corrosive properties, and also seemed to contain some mysterious components.

The instant Yang Kai appeared outside, the Demon Qi and demonic creatures were like beasts that had spotted fresh meat, as all of them rushed towards him.

In a second, the space before Old Man Qin was emptied. It seemed as if the Demon Qi and demonic creatures were no longer flooding through the hole.

Witnessing this, delight, as well as a sliver of anxiety, surfaced in his heart.

He was delighted that the Array Masters would be able to repair the Spirit Array in peace, allowing them to complete the repairs in the shortest possible time.

He was worried about whether Yang Kai could endure until the repairs were complete. If Yang Kai were to suffer from misfortune before that, not only would their repair attempt end in failure, there would be an additional Dao Source Realm Master among the ranks of the demonic creatures.

If that were to happen... Maplewood City’s situation would become even worse!

Just as Old Man Qin was waiting anxiously, a few streaks of light suddenly came streaking over from not far away.

Not long after that, the streaks of lights descended before Old Man Qin, dissipating away to reveal a few figures.

“Yu’er, why did you come here?” Upon seeing a delicate-looking girl standing among the new figures, his expression changed drastically. “It’s dangerous here. Hurry up and go back.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

That delicate-looking girl was precisely Qin Yu, whom Yang Kai had met once before. Furthermore, within Maplewood City, the only Dao Source Realm Master surnamed Qin was the Qin Family’s old ancestor, Qin Zhao Yang.

Nevertheless, despite hearing this, Qin Yu didn’t make a move. Instead, she replied: “We received news that the situation here was critical. Therefore, we hurried here as reinforcements...”

As she continued to speak, Qin Yu turned to look at her surroundings, only to discover in astonishment that everything in her vicinity was currently under control. Other than the hole in the Spirit Array, there wasn’t a single trace of demonic creatures.

The Demon Qi and demonic creatures outside the Spirit Array even seemed to be ignoring the hole in the Spirit Array, and seemed to be surging around, congregating towards some location outside the city instead.

“Over there...” A dark look appeared on Qin Yu’s face. “What is going on over there?

Qin Zhao Yang sighed in reply. “There’s a young man who rushed out to attract the attention of the Demon Qi and demonic creatures. If not for his actions, how would this area be so peaceful now?”

“There’s someone who rushed out?” Looks of astonishment appeared on the faces of other Qin Family members present.

After all, although they had yet to personally witness the terrifying might of the Demonic Qi, just the sight of it was enough to cause all the hair on their bodies to stand on their ends. Who would dare to rush out into the Demonic Qi?

The courage to face such a terror head-on would mean that the person simply had no regard for their life.

Just the thought of this caused feelings of respect for the unknown person to surface in their hearts, as they silently admired the person’s decision.

“Yu’er, since you’re here, then so be it. Help this old master observe the situation over there!” All of a sudden, Qing Zhao Yang seemed to have recalled something, prompting him to speak to Qin Yu.

“Okay!” Qin Yu nodded, before closing her eyes. After reopening them, a silver glow radiated from her eyes. Within her pupils, silvery currents were flashing about, while a mysterious power beamed out from within, piercing through the void before her.

Due to an incurable disease that plagued her body, Qin Yu was frequently not well. Furthermore, displaying this Secret Technique seemed to put an immense burden on her. Tremors started to rack through the body, beads of sweat seeped out of her forehead, while her originally pale face gradually grew even paler.

“So, how’s the situation?”

“Ah...” Right after gazing into the void, Qin Yu could not help but let out a soft yelp.

Very quickly, a sliver of delight flashed across her face as she said out in astonishment, “It’s him?”

Right after she said those words, Qin Yu’s tender body trembled as she closed her eyes abruptly. Like a fish out of water, she proceeded to gasp deeply for air.

Seeing this, a look of fear flashed across Qin Zhao Yang’s face. With a series of finger movements, he made successive taps on the pressure points on Qin Yu’s body. At the same time, he retrieved a Spirit Pill from his Space Ring and shot it straight into her mouth.

He did not chase her for a reply, just waiting for Qin Yu to sit down and adjust her breathing.

After a short while, Qin Yu opened her eyes, looked towards Qin Zhao Yang excitedly. “Old ancestor, was that person named Yang?”

“You recognize him?” Qin Yu’s reaction caused Qin Zhao Yang’s expression to change as he asked her in pensiveness.

“It’s really him!” Qin Yu smiled and replied in a low voice, “Old Ancestor, do you remember the last time Yu’er returned, I had asked for our family to look out for a particular person?”

“I remember hearing about this matter.” Qin Zhao Yang nodded, before asking curiously. “Are you saying that this is the person you were looking for?”

“Indeed!” Qin Yu nodded in response. “Old Ancestor, this person is extraordinary! If it’s possible, you have to try your best to pull him to our side, and get him employed by our Qin Family!”

“This old man can already tell that he is extraordinary...” Qin Zhao Yang’s mouth twitched as he gave a bitter smile in response. If this man was just an ordinary cultivator, would he dare to rush out of the city by himself? “So, how did you come to know about him?”

Qin Yu continued, “That’s because Yu’er was observing him from a distance when he was promoting his cultivation into the Dao Source Realm! When that person was promoting his cultivation realm, the resulting Heavenly Manifestation was exceedingly terrifying, and the spectacle was simply unlike any ordinary cultivator promoting into the Dao Source Realm. Furthermore... at the critical moment of his promotion, he even had enough strength to spare, and dealt heavy injuries to Ghost Hand Shen Tu!”

“What?” Qin Zhao Yang exclaimed in shock, “Are you sure about this?”
