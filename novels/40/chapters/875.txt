Chapter 876: I Know Who She Is

After he obtained Zhang Ao’s memories related to the Starry Sky, Yang Kai refined his Soul remnant directly.

In the process, as always, Yang Kai obtained Zhang Ao’s insights and understandings of the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao.

His own comprehension was subtly enhanced, but not significantly improved.

As Yang Kai’s strength grew, the benefits he harvested from refining these Soul remnants were decreasing correspondingly; however, thanks to this particular method, Yang Kai had never had to worry about bottlenecks while he cultivated. As long as he could kill some high-level cultivators from time to time and absorb their sentiments, Yang Kai’s future cultivation path would be free of obstacles. Of course, this was all under the premise that his True Qi and physique could keep up.

With Yang Kai’s current comprehension, he wouldn’t encounter any kind of bottleneck before breaking through to the Third Order Saint Realm.

Collecting his thoughts, Yang Kai returned his consciousness to his physical body and slowly got up, preparing to inquire about current events when suddenly he heard Han Fei’s shout in the distance, “Who goes there?”

In the next instant, a blast of cold air erupted and the sound of something cutting through the air rang out. It seemed that Han Fei was pursuing someone or something.

Yang Kai frowned, walked out of his tent, and saw a lot of Ancient Demon clansmen gathered around, all of them staring off in a certain direction.

“Master!” Li Rong rushed over to ensure Yang Kai’s safety. Her hut had been set up next to Yang Kai’s for this explicit purpose, the two of them living no more than five meters apart.

“What happened?” Yang Kai asked, releasing his Divine Sense into the surroundings to examine the situation.

“It seems that someone has been spying on us for the past few days but we have so far been unable to find them. Han Fei apparently caught a trace of whoever it was and immediately gave chase.”

“Even you haven’t been able to discover their identity?” Yang Kai was amazed.

“En, that person’s ability to hide their aura is very profound, it’s almost as if they can make themselves completely invisible, shielding themselves from all our senses,” Li Rong’s brow furrowed deeply.

“Oh? Interesting,” Yang Kai grinned. Outwardly, Li Rong was only a Second-Order Saint, but her true strength was not inferior to that of a Demon General, yet even she was unable to track down this elusive enemy.

The only one nearby capable of such a feat should be the Monster Race Great Senior!

However, Yang Kai had already reached an agreement with him and it was impossible for that Great Senior to be so bored to run over here to spy on them.

Waiting for a while, Han Fei flew back, her expression dim.

“That person?” Li Rong asked.

Han Fei shook her head, “Their speed is too fast, and their movement skill is quite exquisite. I wasn’t able to catch up with them!”

“Did you manage to see what kind of appearance they had?” Yang Kai asked.

“It was a woman,” Han Fei frowned, “But her appearance was quite strange. All her clothes seemed to be tattered and her hair was a complete mess, almost like she was a lunatic. She never said a word. As soon as she discovered me, she immediately fled. Oh, right, I also didn’t feel any vitality from her, instead... there was Death Qi lingering about her!”

“Death Qi?” This time it was Li Rong’s turn to be shocked.

“En, it was definitely Death Qi, only someone who has already died would have such an aura around them!” Han Fei nodded.

Hearing all this, Yang Kai expression changed as his brow rose, his figure flicking, leaving behind an afterimage where he was previously standing, coming to a stop a moment later and asking, “Did her movement skill look like this?”

Han Fei nodded, “En, her movement skill gave off this kind of feeling, it was quite profound.”

“I know who she is,” Yang Kai stared off into the distance and sighed.

The several Ancient Demon Clan Great Commanders exchanged glances, none of them knowing why Yang Kai showed a low-spirited look.

“Master, is that woman an old acquaintance of yours?” Li Rong asked carefully. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Yang Kai shook his head, “I don’t know her, but she is related to me, she is Nine Heavens Holy Land’s previous generation Saintess!”

Yang Kai then told the Ancient Demon Clan’s leaders the story of Saintess Nan, surprising all of them quite seriously.

“Before death not killing one person, after death slaughtering millions...” Li Rong spoke thoughtfully, “She is somewhat similar to Coffin Slave Senior, but the opposite!”

Coffin Slave and Saintess Nan were both living corpses! It’s just that after death, one of them caused a massive number of casualties while the other never directly killed anyone. Both of them had a powerful obsession in their hearts which allowed their body to continue moving even after death.

Because she was a living corpse, Saintess Nan gave off no life aura, which was why Li Rong and the others had such difficult tracking her.

If they wanted to deal with such a person, the only options were to completely destroy her physical form or somewhat erase her heart’s obsession. Once this last will of hers was crushed, her dead body would naturally stop moving.

“I suppose it’s time to deal with this issue,” Yang Kai stated calmly.

Regardless of what she had become, Saintess Nan was still a member of the Holy Land, if Yang Kai allowed her to continue to roam free; it would only lead to a repeat of the troubles from a few years ago.

Moreover, her lingering presence did nothing for the stability of the Nine Heavens Holy Land.

Her appearing here at this time was obviously because she was tracking him, so as long as Yang Kai acted as bait, Saintess Nan would surely show herself.

Explaining his thoughts to the Great Commanders, Li Rong and the other Ancient Demon Clan Saints made no objections.

In order to ensure things went well, Yang Kai brought both Li Rong and Han Fei with him to a remote location in the jungle.

Saintess Nan was still a powerful Second-Order Saint, even if she was already dead she was not to be underestimated.

A hundred kilometres away, Yang Kai came across a mountain valley and stopped, swiftly sweeping his eyes over the area before nodding lightly.

Li Rong and Han Fei immediately hid and concealed their auras, lying in ambush.

Yang Kai walked leisurely into the mountain valley, picking a few spirit herbs he came across along the way. Unfortunately, he only found a few Heaven Grade and Mysterious Grade herbs, not even a single Spirit Grade item appeared.

It wasn’t until after he circled the entire mountain valley once that Yang Kai felt a sense of inconsistency.

It was as if someone was staring at him from nearby.

Turning his head in the direction he sensed this gaze coming from, Yang Kai saw Saintess Nan appear. Dressed in white, her hair dishevelled, swaying back and forth like an evil spectre, she faintly stared at him while maintaining a short distance between them.

Her white dress had been significantly worn due to the many fights she had been in as she had obviously never changed or washed them these past few years, giving her an even more ghastly look.

Yang Kai didn’t know when she had appeared and wasn’t even clear how long she had been staring at him, all he could tell was that there was a hint of tenderness and nostalgia which flashed across the depths of her eyes as she fixed her gaze on the Holy Master Spirit Ring on his hand.

The Holy Master Spirit Ring was a symbol of every Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land. The old Holy Master had also worn it on his hand before he died. Saintess Nan was the old Holy Master’s life companion, so when she saw this ring, naturally she would show some reaction.

However, the tenderness in her gaze quickly faded and was replaced with endless killing intent as she shot forward towards Yang Kai without so much as a word.

Before Saintess Nan even arrived in front of him, a huge pressure had already descended upon Yang Kai.

A giant sword appeared in the sky and slashed down towards Yang Kai.

Profound Heavenly Sword!

Yang Kai simply stood in place, not making any attempt to evade.

“World of Ice and Snow!” Suddenly, a cold yet melodious voice rang out from the jungle.

In an instant, the entire mountain valley’s temperature plummeted! With a crackling sound, a thin layer of ice quickly covered the lush vegetation while a sky blue barrier appeared above the mountain valley, sealing it off from the outside world.

The dramatic change in climate was accompanied by snowflakes falling from the sky.

These seemingly dainty snowflakes each contained an enormous amount of power and each time one fell it would explode in a burst of light, sending out an uncountable number of tiny attacks towards Saintess Nan.

The Profound Heavenly Sword was instantly crushed.

Saintess Nan, who had been rushing towards Yang Kai, instinctively stopped, leapt back and summoned a Grand Heavenly Shield to protect her body, a great spear then appearing in her hand which she proceeded to throw towards Han Fei’s hiding place.

*Xiu...*

Like it was breaking through space itself, the Heaven Punishing Spear instantly appeared in front of Han Fei, causing her eyes to bulge.

A chill rising from the bottom of her heart, Han Fei’s pretty face was immediately covered in her Demon Crests as she extended her jade hand and grabbed towards the approaching spear.

Red blood dripped from her hand as she somehow managed to block this strike.

At the same time, Li Rong has quietly arrived behind Saintess Nan. A red light blossomed as a huge flower appeared beneath Saintess Nan’s feet.

This blooming flower was quite beautiful, its petals gently rotating almost like a lotus platform as it sent out a strange energy wave that engulfed and drew Saintess Nan towards it.

The petals gradually began to close, trying to wrap up and trap Saintess Nan inside them.

A hoarse, nearly inhuman roar escaped Saintess Nan’s lips as her body flickered, leaving behind a fuzzy afterimage as she seemingly teleported a short distance away.

Standing firm, Saintess Nan directed a murky glare towards Li Rong and Han Fei, like a wounded beast.

Li Rong and Han Fei also gathered together, their eyes flashing with a mix of pity and dread as they looked towards Saintess Nan, both of them realizing just how difficult an opponent they were facing.

“You don’t have to hold back. Try to capture her, but if you can’t... destroy her directly!” Yang Kai faintly said.

“Yes!” Li Rong and Han Fei shouted together, both of them taking action again.

*Chi chi chi...*

Ice blades swirled about.

*Xiu xiu xiu...*

Bright red flower petals danced through the air.

Two Ancient Demon Clan leaders joining forces to fight against the Second Order Saint Saintess Nan, naturally, there was no suspense.

The mountain valley had been surrounded by Han Fei’s barrier so Saintess Nan could not escape.

If not for them having scruples about her being from Nine Heavens Holy Land, Li Rong and Han Fei would have already beaten her.

Half an hour later, Saintess Nan was finally overpowered and bound by Li Rong’s red flower.

A brilliant red light burst out and when it faded, the flower petals seemed to have sunk into Saintess Nan’s skin, leaving behind petal tattoos all across her body.

Her True Qi had been sealed and her movements had been restricted. Saintess Nan had been caught.

Walking up to get a close-up look at Saintess Nan, Yang Kai, who had been entangled by her for several years couldn’t help feeling somewhat complicated.

The person in front of him, when she was young, was a peerless beauty. Even after she died, her face still retained its youthfulness.

But at this moment, she was now a dishevelled corpse driven only by the desire to slaughter.

If the old Holy Master was still alive and saw this scene, it was difficult to imagine what he might think.

In fact, if Su Yan or Xia Ning Chang ever ended up like this, Yang Kai would have felt more aggrieved than if they had just died.

Wanting to destroy her directly, yet somehow not able to bear doing so, Yang Kai eventually let out a sigh and said, “Take her back with us and watch over her carefully.”

He decided to hand over Saintess Nan to Xu Hui and the others to handle.

Li Rong and Han Fei glanced at each other and nodded gently, the former wrapping Saintess Nan in her Demonic Qi before both of them followed Yang Kai back the way they came.
