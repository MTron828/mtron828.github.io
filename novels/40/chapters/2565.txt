The Monster Race members were thrown off their feet, miserably wailing as they were helplessly struck by the thousands of Sword Qi blades before they could even approach Yang Kai. Blood gushed out from their bodies as if they had been riddled with holes like a sieve.

After this one move, Yang Kai suddenly disappeared from his position.

*Shua…*

His figure flickered as he flew to the front of the charging Monster General, swinging his sword down.

The Monster General had never seen such a scary Human before. After having seen his subordinates cut down like straws, he realized that things weren’t looking good for him. This Human seemed to be different from the ones he had encountered before. He was too scary!

Having been suddenly attacked, the Monster General was naturally shocked and angry.

However, his reaction was swift as well. The bone spear in his hand left afterimages, forming a screen of thrusts directed straight at Yang Kai. Monster Qi burst forth as the sound of the spear cutting through the air filled the surroundings.

Yang Kai similarly swung his sword again and again, and coupled with his Emperor Qi, the Myriads Sword became incomparably sharp; so sharp that the white bone spear was chipped off bit by bit and in the blink of an eye, only half of the long spear in the Monster General was left.

“Ah!?” The Monster General turned pale in horror. In this short time, who knows how many times he had visited the gates of Hell.

He had encountered a lot of Human cultivators before, but he had never seen one who could kill him without him being able to fight back. Even if the Human’s cultivation was higher than his, they were fighting him in the Ancient Wild Lands, where most of their strength was suppressed. And coupled with his several dozen subordinates, he had never been defeated. He had killed and robbed a lot of Human cultivators, making a big profit in the process.

This time though, it seemed he had kicked an iron plate. Not only did his feet hurt, but he might even lose his life if he didn’t handle things well.

Seeing Yang Kai swing his sword again, the Monster General screamed in horror and raised his arms up, lifting the remaining bone spear and pouring his Monster Qi into it to defend himself.

*Hong…*

A terrifying force struck him from above before the bone spear that had been with him for who knows how many years was cut into two. Sharp Sword Qi almost chopped off his face as it cut through his chest and abdomen.

The steel-back maned boar under him directly buckled to the ground, kneeling down. It was quite apparent how heavy this blow was.

In pain, the steel back maned boar’s eyes suddenly turned red and its steel-like hairs stood on end before they shot outwards.

Yang Kai raised his brow, surprised by this mount’s unexpected blow. It seemed this boar wasn’t just a status symbol but also a combat asset.

Yang Kai didn’t take this attack head-on, instead choosing to fly back as he swept his sword forward, deflecting the oncoming steel needles flying at him.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, the steel-back maned boar pig suddenly jumped, leading the Monster General away from Yang Kai.

Having hardly recovered from the shock, the Monster General patted himself all over for a while before laughing, “I’m not dead! Hahaha, I’m not dead!”

At that moment, he thought he would die for sure, but to his surprise, he was still alive, making him feel lucky to have survived.

However, how could he dare to fight with Yang Kai again after this short confrontation? He knew that he wasn’t Yang Kai’s opponent, so he spurred his mount with his legs, turning tail and fleeing. Right now, his little life was the most important. He didn’t dare to pester Yang Kai and couldn’t even care about his subordinates’ lives.

But just as he had taken a few steps, a figure flickered and appeared in front of him, blocking his path. It was Yang Kai.

With his black hair dancing in the wind and a cold look in his eyes, Yang Kai stated stoically, “You didn’t die because you are of use to me. Why else do you think you survived?”

Having said this, he swung his sword down again.

The charging steel-back maned boar was too late to dodge this time and was hit straight on by the Sword Qi. It immediately let out a miserable squeal before its enormous body was split in two, blood and organs splashing out on the ground as its two halves kept rushing forward due to the inertia.

The Monster General sitting on its back was also sent flying, knocking over a dozen or so towering trees one after another before finally sliding across the ground and coming to a stop at the base of a particularly large tree. He was heaving hard and couldn’t get up for a long time.

*Zheng…*

A cold gleam flashed before the Monster General’s eyes as he found a sword resting on his forehead. He immediately panicked, staring at the sword. When looked ahead, cross-eyed, he slowly noticed Yang Kai standing in front of him, condescendingly gazing down at him. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

A drop of cold sweat trickled down his forehead as the Monster General knew that Yang Kai had spoken the truth. He wasn’t dead, not because of his own strength, but because Yang Kai had spared his life. If Yang Kai had wanted to kill him just now, it would only have taken a flick of his wrist.

*Gudong…*

The fierce face of the Monster General turned pale as the sound of him gulping sounded. He forced a smile and started begging for mercy, discarding the integrity of the Monster Race, “Spare me, Sir! Spare me!”

It wasn’t the first time Yang Kai had dealt with the Monster Race. In Tong Xuan Realm’s Nine Heavens Holy Land, he had many encounters with the Monster Race, so he knew that these guys were no different from Humans in a certain sense; many of them clung to life instead of choosing death.

Although the fellow before him was a Twelfth-Order Monster Race, he was no doubt a timid fellow.

“Do you want to live or die?” Yang Kai asked in a cold voice, pushing the Myriads Sword a bit, cutting the Monster General’s skin lightly and drawing out a trickle of blood that ran down his face. Of course, the Monster General shouted, “Live! I want to live!”

“If you want to live, answer my questions. If you dare to lie even one word, I will immediately take your dog life!”

“Sir, just ask away!” The Monster General didn’t dare to move, otherwise, his head would have been repeatedly nodding like a chicken pecking rice.

Yang Kai asked, maintaining a cold face, “You asked about a crazy woman just now, have you seen her?”

The Monster General immediately understood that the cause of this disaster was its stupid mouth. This Human Master must have some connection with that crazy woman! He nervously gulped and gingerly asked, “May I ask Sir a question, is that woman your…”

“Hmm?” Yang Kai immediately glared as he coldly snorted through his nose before rebuking, “I am the one asking the questions, you only need to honestly answer them!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” The Monster General’s body went stiff as he hurriedly replied, “I’ve seen her. Not only have I seen her, but I have also fought with her more than once!”

“What happened? Tell me everything in detail!”

Suddenly, an agonized look appeared on the Monster General’s face as he sorrowfully explained, “Sir, please understand, that crazy woman… Cough cough…” Knowing nothing about the relationship between Yang Kai and the crazy woman, the Monster General didn’t want to annoy Yang Kai and have his head cut off. He had been paying close attention to Yang Kai’s language and countenance, so he could tell that Yang Kai shouldn’t be annoyed yet, but was clearly not happy, so he immediately corrected himself and continued, “That woman has caused us a lot of harm. She has been stealing the Heaven Star Nurturing Spirit Fruits that this lowly one has been raising on the mountain. She would steal once every month. I had a total of five fruits and she stole them all in less than half a year. Even the tree was uprooted by her! This lowly one had been keeping those spirit fruits to use for his breakthrough and had spent a thousand years raising them. Just when it was about time to reap the harvest, I didn’t even get to taste one! She has also dug up a dozen or so Turtle Snake Grass that Old Niu, next door, had been raising…”

“Who is Old Niu?” Yang Kai furrowed his brow.

The Monster General hurriedly replied, “Niu Quan is a Monster General under Monster King Ying Fei, just like this lowly one. He lives next door to me.”

“Continue!” Yang Kai poked him with the sword, causing the Monster General to retreat as he could feel the sharp pain grow stronger, not daring to make a rash move so that he could keep his life.

“Hei Ya’s Ten Directional Fruit, Tu Rui’s Golden Rainbow Fountain Flower, Zhui Feng’s Royal Limes… All have suffered at her hands. This lowly one knows more than a dozen others who were robbed by her. I too have no idea exactly how many victims there are. She has been running around the surrounding region, and almost all of my fellow Brothers’ treasures had been taken away by her. Monster King Ying Fei was furious when he learned of this, cursing us as incompetent for being unable to catch one crazy woman. He ordered us to capture her within half a year, lest he loses face in front of the other Monster Kings.”

Yang Kai looked stunned.

Who were these Hei Ya, Tu Rui, Zhui Feng, and the like? Yang Kai had no idea, but he reckoned all of them must be Monster Generals like the one in front of him. He was quite familiar with the Ten Directional Fruit, Royal Lime and the like as well, as all of them were top-grade spirit medicines.

Judging by what this Monster General had said, it seemed like the Third Disciple had robbed these Monster Generals of a lot of the precious treasures they had been guarding.

But this wasn’t strange. She was still a Second-Order Emperor, even if her sanity had been lost. The Ancient Lands might be fraught with dangers, but it was also filled with opportunities, so her cultivation was bound to improve after robbing so many treasures.

After hearing this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but find it infuriating as well as funny.

Why did it feel like that the Ancient Lands had turned into the Third Disciple’s backyard, where she could come and go as she wished, take whatever she wanted, and enrage any Monster General she came across?

“When did this all happen?” Yang Kai asked again.

“It has been like this for fifty years…” The Monster General replied with an ashamed look on his face. A crazy woman had been roaming around in the Ancient Lands for fifty-some years, yet the Monster Race members here were unable to do anything to her. It was really embarrassing to speak of it out loud.

The corner of Yang Kai’s brow twitched before he continued asking, “You brought these subordinates to find that crazy woman?”

The Monster General replied, “Yes, yes. This lowly one heard my subordinate say that they found traces of her in this area, so this lowly one rushed straight here, but… we then ran into Sir,” the Monster General forced a smile as he gingerly asked, “Sir, how is that woman related to you?”

“None of your damn business!” Yang Kai coldly snorted.

The Monster General shrank his neck; however, he could tell that Yang Kai had something to do with the crazy woman, and they were obviously not enemies, otherwise, why would he look worried?

The Monster General rolled his eyes before speaking, “That woman is quite strange. Although we have been looking for her for so long, no one ever succeeded and every time we do spot her, she escapes before we even notice… Uh, Sir, what are you doing?”

While he was talking, he suddenly noticed Yang Kai’s eyes turn colder. Yang Kai appeared to be about to thrust the sharp sword in his hand into his body, frightening the Monster General greatly. Knowing that his life was hanging by a thread, he quickly pleaded, “Sir, please spare me! This lowly one can be of use to you! This lowly one will work very hard to repay this kindness, Sir!”

“What’s the point in keeping a bunch of vile members of the Monster Race alive?” Yang Kai coldly snorted, continuing to push his sword forward. He just wanted to inquire about the Third Disciple for a bit, so now that he had learned everything he needed, there was no reason for him to keep this Monster General alive.

Sensing his murderous intent, large beads of sweat rolled down the Monster General’s forehead. He racked his brain hard before an idea suddenly came to him and he hurriedly stated, “This lowly one can help Sir find traces of that woman! This lowly one has been tracking her for fifty years now and has some understanding of her habits. Sir, please give me a chance!”

Silavin, Hmm… Well, the author just gave 50 years even though it was 20 years prior. Let’s think of the woman that was lost as being someone else? Or maybe she went back and forth, doing this while she was still sane?
