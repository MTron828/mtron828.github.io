An eager, ordinary-looking young man arrived at the front of the Recruitment Hall. Although the young man had an ordinary appearance, he was dressed in exquisite robes and despite the cold temperature of the Northern Territory, he was actually fanning himself lightly while striding towards the hall, looking extremely suave.

He seemed to have caught the attention of some cultivators on the street, all of whom shook their heads and spurned him for being shameless.

The young man was, of course, Yang Kai. He had exited Ice Heart Valley quietly without getting noticed and went straight to Ice Moon City. After inquiring about the location, he headed towards the Recruitment Hall.

The hand fan in his hand was actually a Dao Source Grade High-Rank artifact, something he had collected from one of his many fallen enemies and that he had finally found a use for.

Two Seeking Passion Sect disciples were guarding the entrance of the Recruitment Hall. Their strengths were mediocre, with only First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivations, but no one dared to embarrass Seeking Passion Sect, so their cultivations did not matter as they were only given the role of gatekeeping.

The two guards exchanged disdainful looks when they saw Yang Kai strut over arrogantly.

Although their cultivations weren’t high, they had the identity of being disciples from the Seeking Passion Sect. From his appearance, Yang Kai was probably a Young Master from an unknown family, dressing in pompous clothing and strolling across the street snobbishly, as if he owned the ground he walked on.

Such an appearance could be passed as acceptable if he was extremely handsome, but his exquisite robes and elegant hand fan were completely mismatched with his completely ordinary face, making for quite a distasteful scene.

“Stop, what are you doing here?” One of the guards stretched out his hand to stop Yang Kai with an extremely cold look on his face.

Yang Kai looked up at the inscribed board, folded the fan in his hand and tapped it on the palm of his other one, “This is the Recruitment Hall, right? What do you think this Young Master is here for?”

The guard frowned and questioned, “Are you here to receive the Recruitment Order?”

“Of course,” Yang Kai smiled, unfolding the fan with a swipe and waving it a few times comfortably, giving him the appearance of someone who was quite the promising young man.

Since he was here to receive the Recruitment Order to work for Seeking Passion Sect, the two guards had no reason to stop him, so the one who had previously blocked his path nodded gently, “Go straight after you enter, then turn left and look for one of the Deacons.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly and strode into the hall.

Following the guard’s instructions, he went straight ahead, then turned left to enter a hall.

Unexpectedly, there were many waiting in line in this hall while behind several tables, Deacons from Seeking Passion Sect were interviewing those who had come to Seeking Passion Sect. If there was no problem with their backgrounds, these people would be registered and then issued a Recruitment Order.

With a Recruitment Order in hand, one would temporarily belong to the Seeking Passion Sect. After breaking the Sect Defending Array and destroying Ice Heart Valley, they would be rewarded.

After the cultivators who had clean backgrounds received the Recruitment Order, the disciples of the Seeking Passion Sect would direct them out and arrange tasks for them to do.

Yang Kai frowned slightly at the long lines behind the numerous tables. It did not look good for Ice Heart Valley that so many had come to receive the Recruitment Order from Seeking Passion Sect.

He stood there to observe for a while before immediately striding towards a table without hesitation when he had a clear picture of the registration process. With the fan in his hand swaying unceremoniously from side to side as he walked, Yang Kai shooed the people around him, “Move aside, move aside, don’t block this Master’s way.”

His arrogant and lawless attitude made it seem like he was some important figure from the Seeking Passion Sect.

The cultivators queuing up were sorely beaten by the hand fan, and the neat line was also quickly disrupted. Everyone glared at Yang Kai, but did not act rashly as they were not sure of his identity.

Sneering, Yang Kai completely ignored these people. They were here to join the Seeking Passion Sect, so they would be the enemies of Ice Heart Valley once the war started. As such, there was no need for Yang Kai to show any respect. The mysterious force sweeping out of the hand fan was enough for those cultivators to be feeling pain for the next ten days to half a month.

The Deacon of the Seeking Passion Sect sitting behind the table was furious at Yang Kai’s arrogant behaviour which completely disrespected the Seeking Passion Sect. He coldly snorted, “Junior, stop this racket!”

“That’s right, he’s too rude, Sir Deacon must teach him a lesson!”

“It burns! This brat is hitting others too rampantly! Sir Deacon, you must seek justice for us!”

“Don’t let him go!”

The group of beaten cultivators yelled.

“Shut up!” Yang Kai’s face turned cold as he palmed towards the complaining group. Instantly, Emperor Qi surged while Principles swirled, sending the whole hall into a buzz.

“Emperor Realm!”

“Heavens, it’s an Emperor Realm Master!”

The cultivators who had been yelling before suddenly became apprehensive, and even the expressions of the Deacons of the Seeking Passion Sect who were sitting behind the tables changed drastically. Although they were Deacons of the Seeking Passion Sect, all of them were just Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators. They had no chance of resisting in the face of an Emperor Realm Master.

*Hong…*

Several dozen people flew out after being struck by Yang Kai’s palm, all of them spitting blood in mid-air before they struck the ground miserably. However, everyone was relieved that although the power of this palm was great, none of those who were hit died, though the injuries they suffered were not something that could be restored with just half a month of cultivation.

“Speak nonsense again and I’ll take your dog lives!” Yang Kai snorted coldly, with the arrogant ‘everyone is beneath me’ demeanour.

No one dared to say a word; the hall was so silent that even a needle falling to the floor could be heard.

*Shua… *

A figure suddenly shot out from the inner hall and stood in front of the tables.

As soon as this person appeared, the few Seeking Passion Sect Deacons who did not even dare to breathe lit up and quickly cupped their fists as if they had seen their saviour, “Greetings, Elder Sun!”

“Elder Sun, it’s Elder Sun Ping!”

“It’s really Elder Sun Ping. Now, this little brat is going to be in trouble! Elder Sun Ping is a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master! That boy is definitely not his opponent.”

“How dare he act so rampantly in the territory of the Seeking Passion Sect! This brat should check his face in the mirror.”

At their words, Yang Kai turned to look at the Master who had suddenly appeared.

It was an old man with an all-white beard, his aura was like an abyss, as deep as the sea, which gave tremendous pressure to the surrounding people. His face was thin, but his eyes were as bright as the sun that could pierce through one’s mind.

“Elder Sun?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

He was not familiar with this Emperor Realm Master from Seeking Passion Sect; after all, he only knew Feng Xuan and Yao Zhuo. This was the first time Yang Kai had met Elder Sun, but seeing his Second-Order Emperor Realm cultivation, it was obvious his status in the Seeking Passion Sect was not low.

“Young man, your temper is a bit too hot.” To everyone’s surprise, Sun Ping did not reprimand Yang Kai, but instead addressed him with a smile.

Yang Kai sneered, “They were too noisy, so this Young Master taught them a little lesson.” He lowered his voice and his attitude changed tremendously, cupping his fists as he grinned, “I didn’t mean to disturb Elder Brother Sun. It was indeed my fault.”

‘Bullying the weak, but acting humble in front of a Master’, This saying perfectly described Yang Kai’s current behaviour.

Everyone in the hall despised him, but did not dare to show anything on their faces as they still feared his Emperor Realm cultivation; it was truly frustrating.

“It’s fine!” Sun Ping smiled slightly as he asked, “Since you are here in the Recruitment Hall, I assume Little Brother has come here to receive the Recruitment Order?”

Yang Kai nodded and replied, “Naturally. I heard that the Seeking Passion Sect is looking for talents, so this Young Master came to have a look. Does Elder Sun not welcome me?”

“I wouldn’t dare!” Sun Ping stroked his beard and laughed lightly, “The Sect definitely welcomes young capable people like Your Excellency.”

“That’s good.” Yang Kai grinned.

“But…” Sun Ping turned around and narrowed his eyes, “I shall first warn you, you must possess a clean background to be able to receive the Recruitment Order. My Seeking Passion Sect will not accept those of unknown origins, especially those with cultivation like Your Excellency’s, so Your Excellency will need to answer a few questions from this Old Master.”

If his cultivation was below the Emperor Realm, it would be fine even if his background was a bit vague; but for people with Emperor Realm cultivation, one’s background must be clean and traceable, lest they turn out to be a spy or ally of Ice Heart Valley.

This was the rule.

“I understand,” Yang Kai smiled lightly, not revealing the slightest panic as he probed, “What is it that Elder Sun wants to ask?”

Sun Ping began his interview, “Where does Your Excellency come from? What is your name? Who is your Master?”

Yang Kai answered frankly, “My name is Xiao Bai Yi, and I hail from Azure Sun Temple in the Southern Territory. My Master is Elder Gao Xue Ting!”

As he spoke, Yang Kai silently apologized, [Xiao Bai, Xiao Bai, let me borrow your identity for a short while and please don’t come to settle accounts with me in the future.] He had already planned to use this identity since the beginning, so he was not hesitant to answer the questions now.

“Azure Sun Temple!” Sun Ping was stunned when he heard this name.

Although the Southern Territory was far away from the Northern Territory, Sun Ping still knew of Azure Sun Temple; after all, Azure Sun Temple’s status in the Southern Territory was the same as Seeking Passion Sect’s status in the Northern Territory. They were both top Sects of their respective territories. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

However, it was quite incomprehensible for a disciple of Azure Sun Temple to appear in Ice Moon City of the Northern Territory.

Sun Ping frowned and probed further, “This Old Master has long heard of your noble Temple, but… why are you here?”

Yang Kai chuckled and answered, “I only recently broke through to the Emperor Realm, so my Honoured Master ordered me to roam and explore the world to temper myself. I have been travelling the Star Boundary for some time now and just happened to pass by here. I decided to come have a look after hearing what happened between your noble Sect and Ice Heart Valley.”

“I see!” Sun Ping did not suspect him.

It was normal for a young man like Yang Kai to travel the Star Boundary after a big breakthrough to broaden his horizons. Sun Ping himself had done this before, but he had never been to the Southern Territory, instead choosing to wander around the Territory and Eastern Territory. As a result, he didn’t see anything wrong with Yang Kai’s explanation.

After pondering for a while, Sun Ping looked up again and asked, “Considering Young Master Xiao’s age, you should be a core disciple even in Azure Sun Temple with a cultivation like yours. Words can’t prove anything, unfortunately, so does Young Master Xiao have anything to prove your identity?”

“Something to prove my identity with…” Yang Kai thought for a while, then suddenly reached out and turned over his hand. A token had appeared on the palm of his hand, which Yang Kai tossed over towards Sun Ping, “This should be enough to prove my identity.”
