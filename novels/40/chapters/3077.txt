In the blink of an eye, more than ten Great Dragons had gathered around Yang Kai. These Dragons didn’t have a physical form, but their Source Strength was extremely pure. The most shocking thing about them was their sizes.

Even the smallest one was 400 metres long!

The greatest of them was nearly 1,000 metres in length. Its gigantic figure, which had spread across the entire hall, swam majestically through the air, giving immense pressure to everyone present.

It was as though these gigantic Dragons just jumped out of the ancient scrolls and arrived at this place for no reason.

*Gudong…*

All the Dragon Clan members gulped as their faces turned ashen. Under the influence of such terrifying Dragon Pressure, they could hardly support their own weights as their legs had turned to jelly and their faces were completely white.

Although the Dragon Grave was where the Dragon Clan members would go after their death, not all of them would end their lives in that place. Some of them would be enshrined in the Dragon Temple after their fall to provide good fortunes and blessings to their descendants.

Those who could be enshrined in the Dragon Temple were all Heads of the Dragon Clan.

In other words, only the Great Elder of every generation had the right to be enshrined in the Dragon Temple. For the current generation, only Zhu Yan had such a right. Even Fu Zhun was not eligible for this honour.

Hence, all these Great Dragons coming from all directions in the Dragon Temple were once Great Elders of the Dragon Clan who had been enshrined in this place.

Zhu Yan even saw a familiar figure, a Yellow Dragon between 400 and 500 metres long. In an instant, it was as though he had been thrown into a world of memories as he recalled the events of his childhood tens of thousands of years ago.

At that time, he was still working hard to grow and become a powerful Dragon under this Elder’s guidance. After his death, Zhu Yan took over his position and became the Great Elder.

He looked dazedly at the Yellow Dragon as his lips trembled. In his heart, he longed for this Elder, who had passed away many tens of thousands of years ago, to look at him and praise him for doing a good job. However, he was disappointed to see that this Elder, who had never bowed his head his entire life, was doing just that as he hovered quietly behind Yang Kai.

“The first Great Elder…” Astounded, Fu Zhun stared at the only Dragon that was 1,000 metres long. Although they were many generations apart, Fu Zhun could still recognize this particular Great Dragon at first glance.

Only the Dragon Clan members of that generation could grow to be so mighty.

As time passed, the Dragon Clan had gradually become weaker, and in the current generation, even the strongest of them could barely reach 500 metres in length, half of the size of those from the first generation.

The next largest after the first Great Elder must be the Great Elder of the second generation, followed by the third generation, the fourth generation and so on.

All the Great Elders of the past dozen generations had been called upon by the Ancestral Source and gathered together, a sight then sent shockwaves into everyone’s heart.

“How dare you do this!” Fu Zhun was startled for a long time before she snarled through clenched teeth, her beautiful face contorting madly. She stared resentfully at Yang Kai, as though she wanted to pierce through him countless times with her gaze, “How dare you disturb our ancestors!”

Although her tone was still fierce, she no longer appeared overbearing under the Dragon Pressure of these ancient Great Elders as well as the pressure from the Dragon Temple. Now, she looked like an enraged kitten that was brandishing its claws, so she appeared rather laughable.

She couldn’t be blamed for being so incensed though; after all, the Dragon Temple was where the deceased Great Elders of every generation were enshrined. This was the true foundation of the Dragon Clan’s fortune and the basis of their continued bloodline. All of these ancestors were long gone, so they didn’t have their own consciousness nor will. Even the Great Elder and Second Elder couldn’t summon these ancestors using any Secret Technique.

However, right after Yang Kai gave the order, the Great Elders of the past generations all awoke from their sleep, deeply embarrassing all the Dragon Clan members present.

Mo Huang was also amazed as he looked at Yang Kai. He had never expected this young man to be capable of pulling off such a feat. He swept a glance over the Golden Divine Dragon Source next as he knew that everything was made possible because of this strange-looking Dragon Source.

“You left me no choice,” Yang Kai stared down at Fu Zhun, but he didn’t try to aggrandize himself or pressure her in some way. If it weren’t because he was left with no choice, he really wasn’t willing to make such a big fuss.

The moment he stepped into the Dragon Temple, he could feel that the Golden Divine Dragon Source within his body had become active, as though it had been connected to something in the surroundings. In fact, it was just a subconscious act that he had summoned all these ancestors of the Dragon Clan.

“You were left with no choice?” Fu Zhun sneered, “What do you want now, then? Do you want to kill all members of the Dragon Clan?”

“That’s a great idea. Grudges have been formed between us anyway. The best solution is to kill all of you so that there won’t be any future worries for me.” As Yang Kai spoke, he swept an eerie glance over all of them, as though he was mulling over the feasibility of this idea.

All the Dragons were stunned when they met his gaze, as though they had been engulfed in the aura of death. The blood in their veins seemed to have frozen all over.

Appearing defiant, Fu Zhun pressed her lips together, while Zhu Yan appeared solemn.

If Yang Kai decided to deal with them with the help of the Dragon Temple’s power, Zhu Yan and Fu Zhun could only flee from this place even if they joined forces, unless they could kill him in one decisive strike.

However, under the watchful gazes of all the Great Elders from the past generations, killing Yang Kai was all but impossible. They knew just how formidable the Dragon Temple’s power was.

It was a special place that contained a special power, which was what made it unrivalled. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Mo Huang parted his lips in an attempt to persuade Yang Kai. Although he wasn’t fond of the Dragon Clan, the idea of killing any one of them had never crossed his mind, as there were no real blood feuds between them. He wasn’t sure what Yang Kai’s temperament was like though, and if he really did what Fu Zhun had said, the consequences would be dreadful.

Whatever the case, Mo Huang wouldn’t want the Dragon Clan to be slaughtered here. The Dragon Temple was one of the two foundations of the Dragon Clan, and it would be the biggest joke in history if it was responsible for their demise.

Before Mo Huang could speak, however, Yang Kai suddenly curbed his murderous intent and returned to an indifferent stance, “All of you are Qing’er’s family though, so we shouldn’t keep hurting each other. Why don’t we have a seat and talk it out? What do you think, Great Elder?”

Zhu Yan’s face twitched as he uttered, “Since ancient times, the one whose fists are bigger gets to decide. In this place, you have the final say.”

Yang Kai replied, “You seem to have some biases against me, but that’s fine. Besides going to the Lower Star Field, I don’t have other requests, so I hope that you’ll agree to it… Good. Since you remain silent, I’ll just take it as acceptance. You’re indeed a highly principled man, Great Elder. Many thanks.”

The corner of Zhu Yan’s mouth twitched as he lowered his gaze and remained silent. [He’s basically talking to himself. How does he have the nerve to spout such nonsense?]

The Void Corridor that had been created by Wu Kuang would be completely closed soon, so Yang Kai couldn’t dawdle any longer. If he wanted to head to the Lower Star Fields before the Void Corridor closed, he had to do it quickly.

Then, he turned to Zhu Qing and uttered, “You’ll stay here.”

Zhu Qing parted her lips in an attempt to say something, but Yang Kai stepped forward and pulled her into his embrace before locking his lips with hers right in front of everyone.

All of their expressions turned awkward as they looked away in embarrassment. They thought that this brat was too shameless to be carrying out such a blasphemous act in this sacred place.

If someone else had done this, they would have been killed by now.

With her lips locked, Zhu Qing couldn’t utter a word, and after their lips finally parted, she was blushing deeply. Yang Kai only said one thing to her then, “Wait for me.”

It wasn’t that he wasn’t willing to bring Zhu Qing with him, but the road ahead was uncertain, so he didn’t have the heart to make her suffer such hardships with him. Since Fu Chi was dead, it would be alright for Zhu Qing to stay on Dragon Island.

Then, he gazed at Fu Zhun and said, “Second Elder, I apologize for offending you today. I hope that you’ll forgive me. After all, I’m young and reckless, so I hope you don’t take my actions to heart. I will return one day to formally apologize to you.”

Since Zhu Qing had to stay here, he had to relax tensions with Fu Zhun. Otherwise, the Second Elder might oppress his woman.

However, what he just said could also be regarded as a threat. Since he had broken into Dragon Island once, he could do it again. If Zhu Qing was mistreated after he left, he would come back to Dragon Island with a different attitude. Instead of apologizing to them, he would be condemning them.

Upon grasping the meaning behind his words, Fu Zhun snorted.

Following that, Yang Kai turned to Fu Xuan, who had been in Mo Huang’s embrace the whole time, and flashed a smile at her, “Fourth Elder, many thanks for everything today. I didn’t manage to prepare a gift for our first meeting, so please accept this small token of my appreciation instead.”

As Yang Kai spoke, he performed a hand seal with one hand, upon which a Dragon roar could be heard. At the same time, a beam of light emerged from the void and shot towards Fu Xuan at the speed of lightning.

Mo Huang frowned upon seeing that. Although he could intercept it, he could feel that Yang Kai did not carry any ill-intentions, which was why he allowed him to proceed.

The beam of light shot into Fu Xuan’s body, upon which cracking sounds could be heard.

While Zhu Yan’s gaze turned softer as he was looking at him, Fu Zhun’s expression became grim.

Fu Xuan’s pale face gradually became lively again as her gaze brightened. Pleasantly surprised, she turned a grateful smile to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded slightly at her before turning around. No longer daring to delay, he stepped into the Void Corridor and disappeared from everyone’s sight.

After he was gone, the Great Elders from the past generations disappeared one by one, as though they hadn’t been there at all.

The terrifying Dragon Pressure ebbed, upon which the Dragon Clan members gasped for air and looked at each other in shock, still reeling from the experience.

Mo Huang appeared pleasantly surprised as he gazed hopefully at Fu Xuan and asked in a small voice, “Was it…”

Fu Xuan nodded gently, “The Binding Dragon Seal has been removed.”

Binding Dragon Seal was one of the Dragon Clan’s Secret Techniques which was used on the Dragon Clan’s sinners. Once the Binding Dragon Seal was implanted on someone, their Dragon Source would be completely suppressed.

When Fu Xuan was thrown into the Dragon Grave all those years ago, the Binding Dragon Seal was used on her.

This Secret Technique wasn’t just a punishment for the Dragon Clan members who had made a mistake, it was also a symbol of their status as criminals. With this technique binding Fu Xuan, even Mo Huang was powerless to remove it.

Although he could get Fu Xuan out of the Dragon Grave, he couldn’t prevent her from growing weaker until she eventually lost her life, unless the Binding Dragon Seal was removed.

However, he didn’t have a method to remove this seal.
