In the void, over twenty Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters stood over 10,000 meters apart, confronting each other

A distance of 10,000 kilometres was akin to a few steps away to a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Any Divine Ability could easily cross this 10,000 kilometres gap instantly.

However, neither side had any intention of being the first to attack.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense surged as he scanned his surroundings, searching for Zuo Quan Hui’s aura. Being observed in the dark by a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, Yang Kai felt like a mountain was pressing down on him. If he couldn’t find any trace of Zuo Quan Hui, he wouldn’t be able to easily act.

A faintly discernible murderous intent lingered all around, and it did not originate from any of the Sixth-Order Masters in front of him, so it had to be from Zuo Quan Hui, who had concealed himself.

Yang Kai’s body tensed up as his muscles went taut. His eyes were filled with determination. If Zuo Quan Hui dared to make an entrance, he would have no choice but to call out Iron Blood Great Emperor and the others to fight to the death.

After a long and torturous wait, the murderous intent that had been lingering around him suddenly disappeared into thin air. The ten Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters confronting the Void Land cultivators 10,000 kilometres away, suddenly had a change in their expressions at the same time, as if they had received some kind of instruction. The next moment, all of them turned into streaks of light and withdrew.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes slightly, knowing that it was Zuo Quan Hui who had ordered them to retreat, and couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.

After watching everyone from Heavenly Sword Union retreat more than 100,000 kilometres away, Yang Kai ordered, raising his hand, “Let’s return.”

He still had many questions that remained unanswered and now was not the right time for a decisive battle. It would be better to ask Hei He what happened first before deciding their next move.

Everyone turned around and flew towards the shattered Spirit Province where Void Land’s encampment was located, returning a short while later.

“Go and recuperate first!” Yang Kai ordered Luan Bai Feng before striding towards the main hall.

Hei He, who was the first to return, had already brought Lan Xun into the main hall. She happened to be surrounded by a group of people, while Serene Soul Great Emperor was investigating her situation.

When everyone heard some commotion behind them, they promptly turned. And when they saw that it was none other than Yang Kai, they promptly stepped aside, giving him way.

“How is she?” Yang Kai asked as he grabbed Lan Xun’s wrist and looked down at her.

As their eyes met, Yang Kai’s heart sank. Lan Xun’s eyes were open, but while they should have been lively and bright, they were now dull and lifeless.

Serene Soul Great Emperor replied in a grim and serious voice, “It’s not good, her Soul has suffered a great injury. I can’t repair it.”

“Even you can’t do anything about it?” Iron Blood Great Emperor asked.

Among all the Great Emperors, the one with the highest attainments in the Soul was undoubtedly Serene Soul. His Grand Dao was that of the Soul, so his authority when it came to such matters was unparalleled.

From the first battle with Heavenly Sword Union until now, all the Great Emperors had broken through to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm apart from Wondrous Pill and Heavens Revelation.

Hearing this, the other Great Emperors’ expressions became extremely ugly. Naturally, they didn’t feel good seeing their old friend’s daughter in such a state. Their hatred for the person who had caused Lan Xun to suffer was even greater.

Serene Soul pondered for a moment before replying, “Perhaps we can try, but first we need to figure out why her Soul suffered such serious injuries.”

Everyone turned their heads, looking at Hei He. When Hei He had brought Lan Xun here, all the Great Emperors had gathered around to investigate her condition, but none of them had had time to ask.

Hei He replied honestly, “Someone used a Soul Searching Technique on her.”

“Soul Searching Technique!” Everyone was shocked when they heard this.

No matter where, Soul Searching Techniques were considered extremely vicious. Lan Xun was fortunate to make it out alive with only damage done to her Soul after being subjected to a Soul Search. If she had been unlucky, she would have lost her life right then and there.

Serene Soul’s expression became solemn, “If the damage was the result of a Soul Searching Technique, I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do.”

“I’ll give it a try!” Yang Kai suddenly picked up Lan Xun and rushed to the room at the back of the hall. He then activated the restrictions before placing her on the bed and sitting down cross-legged next to her head.

Lan Xun’s Soul was severely damaged from the Soul Searching Technique, and even Serene Soul Great Emperor had raised his hands in resignation, but it was not that Yang Kai was also powerless.

The Soul Warming Lotus was a Supreme Treasure and had the effect of constantly nourishing and repairing one’s Soul. Yang Kai had fought many powerful enemies and suffered heavy damage to his Soul numerous times over the course of his life. If it was anyone else, his or her Soul would have been torn apart, rendering them either crippled or dead, but every time Yang Kai suffered injuries to his Soul, the Soul Warming Lotus quickly mended it.

His powerful Soul was all thanks to the nourishment of the Soul Warming Lotus over the years.

Yang Kai took a deep breath and bent down, putting his forehead against Lan Xun’s. His Divine Sense congealed into a Soul Avatar before he enveloped the Soul Warming Lotus with it and rushed into Lan Xun’s Knowledge Sea.

Under normal circumstances, if Yang Kai wanted to enter another person’s Knowledge Sea, he would definitely encounter some obstruction or resistance, but Lan Xun’s Soul had been damaged and she was currently unconscious, so Yang Kai didn’t encounter any difficulty entering her Knowledge Sea with the Soul Warming Lotus.

Looking around, Yang Kai saw that the world inside her Knowledge Sea was in tatters, like the scene of the apocalypse. The ground was scorched and torn apart, causing Yang Kai’s heart to ache at the sight. He could almost feel the pain Lan Xun had suffered that day.

Having one’s Soul searched forcibly by someone was definitely not a pleasant experience. It was as if someone was picking apart every part of your life; every scene and every incident. One had to endure the pain of their Soul being torn asunder.

Yang Kai noticed a faint glow in a certain part of her Knowledge Sea.

Yang Kai immediately flew over and saw a hazy human figure curled up inside like a baby, sleeping. He could vaguely make out Lan Xun’s outline, but it was indistinct. The dim light was also flickering constantly, as if it would disappear at any moment, but was stubbornly maintaining itself.

Yang Kai didn’t dare to delay and quickly released the Soul Warming Lotus, which lifted up the hazy figure.

A seven-coloured light blossomed in Lan Xun’s Knowledge Sea as the petals slowly closed, wrapping the hazy human figure in the center of the flower while an invisible force nourished her damaged Soul, causing her shattered Knowledge Sea to suddenly calm down.

Yang Kai heaved a light sigh of relief.

With the nourishment of the Soul Warming Lotus, it was only a matter of time before Lan Xun’s Soul was restored. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Just as he was about to withdraw from Lan Xun’s Knowledge Sea, an image suddenly appeared in Yang Kai’s mind. It was a picture of Yin Xin Zhao’s hideous appearance, followed by an indescribable sense of panic and helplessness, causing Yang Kai to feel like he was drowning.

But soon, this scene shattered and the inexplicable emotions that had filled Yang Kai also disappeared.

Yang Kai’s face immediately turned dark and menacing, his eyes burning with fury.

Obviously, the scene he saw just now was one of Lan Xun’s memory fragments. Furthermore, he was able to see this nightmare-like memory and experience everything Lan Xun had experienced because his Soul Avatar had entered her Knowledge Sea.

This panic and helplessness were a kind of trauma to Lan Xun.

Because she was so traumatized by the incident, it had turned into a nightmare that was tormenting her even though she was in a deep coma.

Luan Bai Feng had said that Hei He and Lan Xun were brought here by Yin Xin Zhao, so the one who had used the Soul Searching Technique on Lan Xun was undoubtedly Yin Xin Zhao!

[That bastard deserves to die!]

[However, these nightmare-like memories should no longer be haunting her after the nourishment of the Soul Warming Lotus.]

Yang Kai took one last look at the Soul Warming Lotus wrapping Lan Xun’s Soul Avatar before slowly withdrawing.

He then returned to the main hall, where everyone anxiously waited.

“She’s fine, but it may take some time for her to wake up,” Yang Kai waved his hand and stopped everyone from asking.

When everyone heard this, they all accepted it as a matter of course. Even Serene Soul Great Emperor didn’t ask any questions. Yang Kai had created too many miracles in his life for them to start questioning him now. Yao Jun may not have been able to do anything for Lan Xun’s severely damaged Soul, but that didn’t mean that Yang Kai couldn’t.

“What happened? How did you get caught by Yin Xin Zhao?” Yang Kai turned to look at Hei He.

Hei He quickly replied, “Reporting to Sir, ever since Sir left back then, this subordinate has been staying at the border of the Star Boundary, safeguarding the tranquility of both it and the Demon Territory without slacking off. Over the years, the cultivation of the cultivators living in the Star Boundary has been improving at an astonishing pace. Young Lady Lan Xun long ago broke through to the peak of the Third-Order Emperor Realm and successfully condensed her Dao Seal. The same is true for Head Manager Hua, as well as Sir’s Honoured Father and Mother. Thinking that there would be no future for them with the current cultivation limit in the Star Boundary, Head Manager Hua came to me and asked me to escort Young Lady Lan Xun to Void Land and report the situation to you while asking you to return to take a look.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai asked in surprise, “My Father and Mother have also formed their Dao Seals?”

The Great Emperors were also stunned.

It wasn’t surprising that Lan Xun was able to form her Dao Seal; after all, she was the daughter of Bright Moon Great Emperor and had inherited the Bright Moon Physique of the Great Emperor. She was also Star Soul Palace’s Palace Master and had an outstanding aptitude. Even before Yang Kai first left the Star Boundary, Lan Xun had reached the Third-Order Emperor Realm. Although she had congealed her Dao Seal a bit quickly, it wasn’t impossible.

Head Manager Hua Qing Si congealing her Dao Seal was also somewhat acceptable.

However, Yang Kai was well aware of his Father and Mother’s aptitudes. The reason why his parents hadn’t followed him to Void Land back then was because they considered their own aptitudes to be lacking. Even if they had come to the Outer Universe, it wouldn’t have benefited them much, so they decided it was better for them to remain in the Star Boundary and guard Yang Kai’s homeland. Although the First-Order Emperor Realm wasn’t high, it was still quite good in the current Star Boundary.

Yang Kai had spent countless resources and effort to achieve even this; so, it was quite hard to believe that his Father and Mother had grown so tremendously in such a short time.

It was not like it was impossible for Yang Yi Feng and Dong Su Zhu to condense their Dao Seals eventually, but it was absolutely impossible for them to have done so in such a short time.

The Great Emperors naturally understood this, which was why they and Yang Kai were so surprised.

This speed… was too fast.

Hei He continued, “It’s not just Young Lady Lan Xun and Sir’s Honoured Parents. Over the years, many Emperor Realm Masters had appeared in the Star Boundary. I’ve never seen anyone’s cultivation rise so quickly, and it’s not just one person, but essentially everyone in the Star Boundary.”

“Why is that?” Yang Kai asked with a puzzled expression. [Could it be that there was something special about the Star Boundary that I hadn’t noticed?]

What’s more, the Star Boundary was ruined by Mo Sheng, and the great battle had nearly caused the entire Star Boundary to collapse, leaving it in an essentially desolate state.

Hei He looked around and hesitated.

Yang Kai stated, “If you have something to say, just say it. No one here is an outsider.”

Hei He replied with a nod, “This subordinate once went to the Star Boundary to investigate, and I believe the reason why it has undergone such a dramatic change is related to the tree Sir planted there all those years ago.”
