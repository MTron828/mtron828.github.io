Elder looked at Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Guo’s faces with hope, one after another, but he was ultimately disappointed. The three had stoic looks on their faces, expressing nothing.

“He’s just one Human, why would Sirs and Madam make things difficult for him?” Elder angrily asked.

The other three Divine Venerables remained silent, but Shi Hou replied with a cold snort, “Elder, don’t be stubborn. If not for your Stone Spirit Clan and this King having some common origins, this King would have no choice but to exterminate your clan for today’s matters. This King is already showing kindness by sparing you. You shouldn’t try to reach out for a yard after taking an inch!”

Elder wanted to say something but Yang Kai suddenly intervened, “Elder, agree with him, don’t worry about me.”

Elder shouted in a low voice, “This incident was caused by my clan and we have put Little Friend in a lot of trouble. If word got out, my clan would never be able to lift their heads in public.”

Xiao Xiao, who was standing beside him, also vigorously shook his head. Obviously, he didn’t want Elder to discard Yang Kai.

Yang Kai helplessly heaved a sigh before whispering, “I would have already left if I was alone; however, it’s not too late to leave now. Take care of yourselves, I’ll be leaving first!”

Saying so, he manipulated the local Space Principles and his figure disappeared into thin air.

Since it had been confirmed that the Divine Venerables just wanted to subdue the Stone Spirit Clan and didn’t want to ruthlessly kill them, Yang Kai was able to rest assured. In the current situation, the Stone Spirit Clan would definitely not be able to leave, so all he could do was protect himself first. In a hurry, he didn’t have the time to even collect the Embodiment into the Small Sealed World.

However, the Embodiment also had the body of a Stone Spirit, so it wasn’t in any danger with the Stone Spirit Clan. After escaping from here, Yang Kai would find a way to get the Embodiment back. He would even find a way to take the Stone Spirit Clan away from this place where they were bound to always be in trouble.

This bizarre scene left Shi Huo, who had been keeping an eye on Yang Kai, in a daze. Apparently, he still couldn’t figure out what just happened.

Fan Wu’s eyes flickered with a bright gleam as he exclaimed, “A Spatial Divine Ability!”

Just as he spoke, his figure suddenly made a sharp turn and he thrust his finger towards a certain point in the void.

Immediately, a groan was heard as a figure mysteriously appeared out of thin air. At this moment, Yang Kai looked in Fan Wu’s direction in shock.

He didn’t expect that this Divine Spirit would actually be able to force him out of the void.

Their eyes met only for a moment, with Fan Wu’s face being as tranquil as an ancient well. It was hard to tell what was going through his mind from his expression. Yang Kai ground his teeth and tore space again, his figure phasing out and disappearing in the next moment.

Luan Feng’s pretty eyes darted left and right before she opened her mouth wide and breathed out a jet of black flames. The black flames slithered through the air like a nimble black snake, shooting into the void before disappearing.

A moment later, a strange cry rang out as Yang Kai appeared, cutting a sorry figure. He was being chased by the World Extinguishing Black Flames and was unable to shake them off.

Cang Guo sneered and said, “This boy’s teleportation ability is pretty good, but unfortunately, his strength is still lacking a little.”

Fan Wu indifferently stated, “If he were allowed to grow even a bit more, I’m afraid he would be able to come and go freely even in front of me. No one would be able to stop him then. The Dao of Space is truly remarkable.”

*Dang…*

Suddenly, a deafening knell resounded. At the critical moment, Yang Kai had summoned the Mountains and Rivers Bell in front of him, blocking the World Extinguishing Black Flames. After the knell, the World Extinguishing Black Flames, that could burn anything in the world, suddenly went out.

Standing in the air, a pale Yang Kai stated, grinding his teeth, “Sirs and Madam teaming up to deal with this Junior is truly an honour.”

Anyone could hear the sarcasm in his words, but whether it was Fan Wu or Luan Feng, they didn’t look ashamed. Fan Wu rather replied, “It’s natural to use extraordinary means to deal with extraordinary people. There is no need for any sarcasm.”

Yang Kai sneered outwardly, but his heart had already hit rock bottom.

He hadn’t expected for his Teleportation Secret Technique to be useless before the Divine Spirits. This had cut off all his routes of retreat. Today, things were really not looking good for him.

“Human brat, this King also doesn’t want to bully you with numbers, but it’s not impossible to let you live. If you waste your cultivation and leave the Mountains and Rivers Bell, you may leave the Ancient Lands,” Shi Huo stared at Yang Kai, but his eyes kept wandering to the Mountains and Rivers Bell, filled with greed.

Elder snapped after hearing this, “Sir, how is having him cripple himself any different from killing him?”

Shi Huo turned his head and stated in a freezing cold voice, “Elder, don’t challenge this King’s patience anymore. This King has been tolerating you long enough, if you keep acting stubborn, don’t blame this King for teaching you a lesson.”

Elders quickly added, “He is the guest of my clan. My clan has dragged him into today’s affairs. Sir, if you want to do anything, direct it to my clan!”

Shi Huo agreed, grimly smiling and nodding, “Alright, since Elder refuses to realize the errors of his ways, then this King will educate you on showing proper respect.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

As he said this, he let out a roar before transforming into a twenty-metre tall stone giant, similar to the Stone Spirit Clan. However, Shi Huo’s stone giant form appeared much more vicious than the Stone Spirit Clan. His entire body was covered in black flames, which looked quite similar to Luan Feng’s World Extinguishing Black Flames. What’s more, there were sharp thorn-like protrusions on the surface of Shi Huo’s body, giving him an extremely violent and fearsome look. The aura around him made others extremely uncomfortable and seemed to have an effect of suppressing the mind.

Having revealed his true form, Shi Huo sneered and contemptuously stated, beckoning towards the Elder, “All of you can come at me together, this King will let you taste what the gap in our strength is first hand.”

These words were too insulting. Every member of the Stone Spirit Clan was a top Master and a natural-born fighter. They couldn’t bear Shi Huo’s provocation and immediately roared in anger as they charged him without waiting for the command.

Even if Elder wanted to stop them, there was nothing he could do at this moment. He could only grit his teeth and join the attack as well.

In an instant, twelve enormous stone giants were entangled together. It looked like twelve mountains were colliding with each other. Their fists danced against each other, knocking each other back and forth. Their fight caused the sky to shatter and the world to turn upside down.

All the Monster Kings’ eyes trembled. A contest of pure strength like this was extremely rare. They have fought with the Stone Spirit Clan just now, so they knew how difficult these stone giants were to deal with. But Shi Huo was fighting the entire Stone Spirit Clan alone; this scene was extremely shocking.

“Hahaha!” Shi Huo arrogantly laughed as the dark flames on the surface of his body burned more and more fiercely.

While the punches were exchanged back and forth, the attacking Stone Spirit Clan endlessly complained to themselves. They couldn’t even get close to their enemy and when their attacks occasionally did land on Shi Huo, the sharp protrusions on his skin made them injure themselves more than they injured him.

*Hong…*

During the melee, a Stone Spirit was knocked flying by Shi Hou and crashed straight to the ground, leaving a huge pit.

Before the Stone Spirit could crawl back out of the pit, Fan Wu raised his hand and shot a seal straight towards the Stone Spirit that found its target right away.

The struggling Stone Spirit knelt down on the ground, not even having the strength to stand up.

“Secure him!” Fan Wu coldly snorted.

A few Monster Kings immediately flew over, surrounding the Stone Spirit who had been struck by the seal. Each of them returned to their true form and clawed and bit at him, restraining him right then and there.

“Hou!” The Stone Spirit was unwilling, but having been hit by Fan Wu’s seal, eighty percent of his strength was locked up. Also, he was restricted by a few Monster Kings in their true forms, so how could he have the strength to move?

All he could do was kneel down on one leg on the spot, looking at the sky with a look of unwillingness hanging on his face.

*Hong…*

Another Stone Spirit was knocked away by a tremendous force, smashing into the ground and leaving behind an enormous pit. Fan Wu did the same again; he shot out a seal, and before he even gave the order, a few other Monster Kings rushed forward to suppress the Stone Spirit.

*Hong hong hong…*

Stone Spirits were sent flying, one after another. The battle of an entire clan against the Divine Spirit, Shi Huo, actually was completely one-sided. The Monster Kings were bedazzled and gratified at the sight of this.

Among the four Divine Spirits, only Shi Huo could defeat the Stone Spirit Clan with such brutal and direct methods. Except for him, neither Fan Wu, nor Luan Feng or Cang Guo could accomplish this. Not to mention others, even the three Divine Spirits weren’t as good as him when it came to pure strength. But if they were really compared, Luan Feng was the strongest, with Fan Wu as second, and Cang Guo and Shi Huo almost on par.

However… Shi Huo’s Stone Monster form was like the Stone Spirit Clan’s Stone Giant Form. He was born with rock-hard skin but had an extra support of Monster Fire as compared to the Stone Spirit Clan. Also, his entire body was covered in sharp spikes, giving him an added advantage in close combat.

When it came to endurance, Divine Spirit Shi Huo was almost the same as the Stone Spirit Clan.

When it came to strength, Shi Huo was above the Stone Spirit Clan.

Who had the advantage was quite obvious even without fighting. At this moment, the Stone Spirit Clan wasn’t Shi Huo’s opponent even with their entire clan taking action together.

Ten Stone Spirits plus Yang Kai’s Embodiment were all wiped out in less time than it would take to drink a half cup of tea by Shi Huo. After each Stone Spirit fell, they were sealed by Fan Wu and then restrained on the spot by the Monster Kings.

Each Stone Spirit kept roaring. Their faces filled with humiliation.

Shi Huo, on the other hand, stood arrogantly under the sky with eyes filled with disdain and contempt. Finally, he coldly gazed at Yang Kai.

In the previous battle, Yang Kai didn’t intervene not because he didn’t want to, but because Fan Wu’s Divine Sense had locked onto him, making him unable to move.

“Little brat, this King gave you a chance. Since you don’t want to cripple your cultivation, this King will send you to hell!” Just as he said this, Shi Huo punched in Yang Kai’s direction.

Yang Kai’s expression drastically changed and he promptly slapped the Mountains and Rivers Bell, causing the Ancient Exotic Artifact to instantly grow to the height of a human, protecting him. A deafening knell rang as a shockwave spread towards Shi Huo’s oncoming punch.

Shi Huo sneered, “If you were a Third-Order Emperor Realm and had that bell in your hand, this King might have some scruples, but unfortunately… you are only a First-Order Emperor. How much of its power can you even bring out!?”

Shi Huo didn’t even try to evade the oncoming shock wave and met it head-on.

*Kachaca…*

The shockwave visible to the naked eye was suddenly smashed apart. Although Shi Huo’s fist stagnated a little, it continued forward in the next moment and struck right on the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

Another knell rang as Shi Huo’s massive body quaked before he retreated a few steps.

Whereas Yang Kai’s chest violently heaved up and down as his blood and vitality were sent into turmoil by that tremendous force. He opened his mouth and spurted a mouthful of blood as his figure flew back.

“Worthy of an Ancient Exotic Artifact!” Shi Huo was overjoyed instead of getting angry, gulping hard as he stared at the Mountains and Rivers Bell that flew off together with Yang Kai; greed clearly filling his eyes.

A mere First-Order Emperor Realm Master could block his blow with the Mountains and Rivers Bell, so if he could conquer this treasure, he might even dare to fight with the Dragon Clan.
