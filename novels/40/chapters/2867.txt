The faces of the two Demon Kings changed drastically at Yang Kai’s words.

Sha Ya asked in shock, “Sir, do you want to subdue him?”

She initially thought that Yang Kai aimed to kill Bao Qi, so she put extra effort into it. Saying the Charm Demon Clan was unforgiving would be a gross understatement. It was not an exaggeration to say that they would remember every little resentment until the end of time, just like how Sha Ya did not forget about Bao Qi humiliating her even though it was only one round of slander many years ago. Therefore, when Yang Kai asked about nearby Demon Kings, she quickly sold Bao Qi out.

She was exhilarated at the thought that Bao Qi would end up dead after being brought into this world by Yang Kai, but then the latter suddenly mentioned other plans.

It did not sit well with her.

If Bao Qi was really recruited by Sir Shaman Niu, would she not have to work with him in the future? Sha Ya could not accept this idea at all.

“You want me to submit to you?” Bao Qi stared at Yang Kai with a mocking smile. This was truly funny to him, and he finally could not hold back his laughter and cackled in disdain, “Crazy Foreign Race, although I don’t know how you subdued this bitch, I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed if you plan to make me submit. This King is different from that bitch!”

Sha Ya responded with a cold face, “Could your mouth be more filthy?”

Bao Qi snorted coldly and glared at her, but did not further argue, instead just warily staring at Yang Kai.

Although he made up his mind that he would never lower his head to this foreigner, this new world he was brought to gave him a strange and unnerving feeling. He had to be more careful to prevent himself from falling into another trap. For now, Bao Qi planned to find out what the hell this place was as soon as possible, then leave here to make plans for the future.

“Sha Ya, is he always this stubborn?” Yang Kai suddenly turned to Sha Ya and asked.

Sha Ya immediately answered, “Incredibly stubborn. He even dares to talk back to the Demon Saints.”

Bao Qi put on a proud face, as if this was a compliment to him.

Sha Ya then continued, “So, Sir, you should not waste time trying to convince him. Just kill him and get it over with.”

She suggested with a malicious expression, clearly having plans of her own. Other than the fact that she was not willing to work with Bao Qi, her special existence would become insignificant if Yang Kai accepted another Demon King, lowering her position in her new master’s eyes.

Therefore, she wanted Bao Qi to die as soon as possible.

“Then I have no choice,” Yang Kai nodded slightly and decided to act decisively, lifting his hand gently towards Bao Qi as he spoke.

Sha Ya’s beautiful eyes brightened up, cursing Bao Qi constantly in her heart all the while anticipating his tragic end.

Bao Qi also immediately pushed his Demon Qi and pounced towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai waved his hand slightly and Bao Qi was suddenly dumbstruck because he felt a huge and incredible force immediately bind him. He was a Demon King, but at this moment he felt as helpless as a newborn baby, immobilized and completely powerless to resist it.

His eyes shook violently, and the blood in his veins stopped flowing. Even the Demon Qi that he had condensed was suppressed inside his body by the invisible force.

Bao Qi had never encountered such a situation since he began to cultivate and could not help feeling bewildered.

Sha Ya laughed loudly, “Our Sir controls all here. Even a Demon Saint would not be his opponent here, let alone you.”

Three months ago, Yang Kai said the same words when he subdued her. At that time, Sha Ya did not take him seriously and regarded his comments as shameless boasting, but facts proved that he really had the power to control everything in this strange world.

And now, she repeated the same words to Bao Qi as she gloated over his misfortune.

Bao Qi’s face turned ugly. He was obviously struggling to resist, but in front of the power of a world, a Demon King’s resistance was equivalent to an ant trying to shake a tree, completely in vain.

The colour of Yang Kai’s left eye changed again, and golden light flashed.

He looked into Bao Qi’s eyes, pushing his Spiritual Energy wildly and destroying his Soul defences without any difficulty.

Great pain pierced through Bao Qi from the damage to his Soul defences. He screamed miserably as his face contorted in pain.

Looking at Bao Qi’s miserable appearance, Sha Ya laughed even more maliciously, her face displaying unconcealed pleasure.

As Yang Kai’s Spiritual Energy did its work inside Bao Qi’s Knowledge Sea, the latter’s eyes rolled back into his head and his whole body trembled violently as it became drenched in sweat.

A short time later, the golden light in Yang Kai’s eye faded.

Bao Qi fell to the ground with a weak aura, and one would think he was dead without careful examination.

Sha Ya frowned, seemingly rather unhappy.

Because she found that although Bao Qi was in a truly miserable state, Yang Kai had not killed him. Instead, it seemed Yang Kai had implanted a Soul Imprint into Bao Qi’s Knowledge Sea, similar to what he did with her back then. However, she had willingly opened up her Knowledge Sea at that time, while Bao Qi was forced to accept this branding instead. The treatment was quite different.

But in the end, the result was the same. It seemed that she really had to work with Bao Qi in the future, a thought that caused Sha Ya to purse her lips unhappily.

After waiting for a long time, Bao Qi slowly got up from the ground and looked up at Yang Kai with a complicated expression. As a Demon King, he was actually subdued by an existence equivalent to a Demon Great General, and then marked with a Soul Imprint in his Knowledge Sea. Bao Qi could even feel that this Soul Imprint could control whether he lived or died.

Previously, he was still laughing at Sha Ya for being a traitor and a lowly slut, but he did not expect himself to wind up in the same situation as her so soon.

Yang Kai looked at him and declared faintly, “If you’re unhappy, you’re free to kill yourself.”

Bao Qi’s eyes flickered, but there was no impulse to commit suicide. It was not easy for him to reach the Demon King Realm, so why would he want to die? Although some people in the world would rather die than surrender, Bao Qi was not one of them.

“Very good!” The corner of Yang Kai’s mouth curved into an inconspicuous smile, “Then from now on, you will serve me.”

Sha Ya’s grimace deepened.

With great difficulty, Bao Qi asked, “Sir… What can I do for you?” For the first time, he called a man whose strength was inferior to his own ‘Sir’. Bao Qi could not help feeling a little awkward and tried to keep his back as straight as possible when asking to preserve his remaining dignity.

“Eat this first,” Yang Kai threw a jade bottle to him. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Sha Ya’s beautiful eyes suddenly lit up.

Bao Qi caught the bottle quickly and asked with some doubt, “What’s this?”

Sha Ya snorted, “If Sir wants you to eat it, you just eat it. Why do you have to ask so much nonsense? You can give it to me if you don’t want it!”

Sha Ya never forgot the taste of the Spirit Pill ever since the last time she obtained one from Yang Kai. Before that, she never thought that anything like that could possibly exist. It was funny that Bao Qi did not know how extraordinary this pill was and instead seemed vigilant and afraid that it was a poison.

Why would Sir want to poison him when he already controlled his life with the Soul Imprint in his Soul?

After hearing what she said, Bao Qi immediately realized that this was a good thing, and after a sneer, he opened the cap and directly stuffed the Spirit Pill inside into his mouth without even looking at it. The next moment, a look of shock appeared on his face and he immediately sat down cross-legged. The pain displayed on his face caused by the trauma to his Soul was immediately greatly relieved and a delighted expression soon filled his face.

Sha Ya looked disappointed and turned to look at Yang Kai with a longing face.

At that moment, a jade bottle was tossed towards her. Sha Ya caught it with pleasant surprise and smiled widely, “Many thanks for your reward, Sir. Sha Ya will work harder.”

Half an hour later, Bao Qi opened his eyes, his face still covered in shock as he realized he had just taken some kind of treasure that had a very powerful healing effect, one that almost completely repaired the damage to his Soul. Although he was not fully recovered, the damage that remained would not hinder him in any notable way. He only needed to rest for a month or two to fully recover, and there would be no drawbacks that would affect his future.

[What the hell was that? Why have I never heard about the foreign race having such miraculous things?]

While he was bewildered, he suddenly heard Yang Kai introducing himself, “My name is Shaman Niu. You can call whatever you want.”

“Yes, Sir Shaman Niu!” Bao Qi responded respectfully.

“Now tell me about the disposition of your troops.”

As soon as Bao Qi heard this, he knew what Shaman Niu was going to do. He hesitated for a while, but eventually sighed and began explaining all the details of his forces without any concealment.

He knew that trying to conceal things would be pointless in front of this Shaman Grandmaster.

After listening, Yang Kai frowned, “There are a lot of people.”

Bao Qi had about seven thousand people under his command, which exceeded the current number in the Shaman Niu Clan and was more than double the manpower controlled by Sha Ya previously.

After three months of recruitment, Shaman Niu Clan had only managed to gather a force of five thousand people.

Facing such a huge number, even with the blessings of Shamanic Spells, it would be inevitable for large numbers of casualties to appear in the Shaman Niu Clan during a head-on clash. In a war involving more than ten thousand people, it was simply impossible to avoid casualties.

After pondering for a while, Yang Kai continued, “Listen, this is what you will do when I send you out of this place…”

After giving his orders, Yang Kai brought Bao Qi and Sha Ya out of the Sealed World Bead.

In the room, Sha Ya looked at Bao Qi with a sneer, “Don’t screw up. Otherwise, your end will be miserable.”

As the first Demon King to take refuge under Yang Kai, although Sha Ya was not as strong as Bao Qi, her performance was strong enough to maintain her unique position in Yang Kai’s heart.

If Sha Ya had spoken like this to him before, Bao Qi would certainly quarrel with her or even start a fight, but now he was in a bad mood and did not want to mess with her. He just nodded his head gently and stated, “Don’t worry, Sir.”

“Good, then I’ll wait for the good news,” Yang Kai signalled Sha Ya, then the two flew out of the palace together, transforming into a streak of black Qi that rushed out of the city.

After the two left, several Demon Great Generals rushed in and one of them with a square face looked at Bao Qi and asked, “Sir, why did that bitch appear here?”

Bao Qi looked solemn as he replied faintly, “Nothing important, she just came to ask for reinforcements.”

“Reinforcement?” The several Demon Great Generals were dumbfounded.

Bao Qi pressed on, “A group of foreign race seem to be eyeing her, so she came to me for help.” While talking, he pointed at the square-faced Demon Great General and instructed, “Take two thousand people with you to investigate the situation.”
