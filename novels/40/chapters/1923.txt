Time flew, and two years went by in a flash.

Over these two years, Yang Kai had been always on the go, arranging the Cross-Cultivation-Star Space Array on the eighteen stars of the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce.

The stars owned by the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce were far away from each other. Yang Kai had really spent a great deal of time just travelling between stars. Otherwise, based on his skills, it would have taken him less than three months to arrange the Space Arrays alone.

Most of his time was wasted on Starships.

After two years, Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce’s eighteen stars were completely connected. And with the hub in Water Sky City, the transmission between the stars was made easy. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Xue Yue had always been by Yang Kai’s side these two years.

Being accompanied by a beauty naturally made the travels far from boring.

Today, the team finally returned to Water Moon Star.

Ni Guang was responsible for Yang Kai’s grand reception. He kept thanking Yang Kai for his efforts over these two years on the behalf of the Chamber of Commerce. Because of these Cross-Cultivation-Star Space Array, the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce would save a lot of time and money in transportation.

Ai Ou hadn’t appeared. When Xue Yue asked, only then she came to know that Ai Ou had already gone to a certain Cultivation Star to refine the Star Source.

This was a matter of great importance. In the entire Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, only Long Tian Shang and Ni Guang knew about it. The others only thought that Ai Ou had entered a retreat, that’s all.

When Xue Yue came to learn about it, she couldn’t help but look worried.

After all, refining the Star Source was dangerous. Generally speaking, only when the cultivators had reached the Third-Order Origin King Realm could they successfully refine the Star Source. A Second-Order Origin King would basically be unsuccessful.

Luo Hai, the Star Master of Green Mountains Star, was really an exception.

At present, Ai Ou only had the cultivation of Second-Order Origin King Realm. As a girl, Xue Yue couldn’t help but worry.

Yang Kai persuaded her and informed her of the power of the Star Refining Art, which finally put Xue Yue much at ease.

“Yang Kai, someone is here to see you,” suddenly, Ni Guang walked to Yang Kai’s side and whispered to him, acting all mysterious.

“Who!?” Yang Kai looked at him curiously.

Ni Guang smiled. “You will know if you follow me.”

Yang Kai didn’t ask any more questions and followed Ni Guang into a secret room.

There were only three people in the secret room; a man and two women. The man was young. He had sword-like straight eyebrows and stars-like bright and shining eyes. He was quite handsome. And the two sisters were like flowers, serving him from left and right.

Seeing Yang Kai arrive, the man in the room broke into laughter and greeted, cupping his fists, “Brother Yang, we meet again.”

Yang Kai stood in a daze. He immediately asked in surprise, “Brother Gu, how come you’re here?”

He hadn’t expected to meet the Young Union Master of the Sword Union, Gu Jian Xin, at Water Moon Star.

He and Gu Jian Xin had met once, and they had lived together for a while. Although it couldn’t be said that they had a deep friendship, they still found each other pleasing to the eye. In the time they had not seen each other, Gu Jian Xin’s cultivation seemed to have improved a lot. He wasn’t that far from the Origin King Realm. Presumably, he got his lucky break and just needed some time to stabilize his cultivation before he could try to break through.

And the girls by Gu Jian Xin’s side were naturally his left and right sword servants, Ling Yue and An Xing!

The two girls grew up with Gu Jian Xin and the master-servants trio had developed a set of Secret Techniques. When they fought against an enemy together, their power was simply extraordinary. Furthermore, the trio had a very good relationship. Gu Jian Xin had never regarded the two sword servants as his subordinates. When he was attacked by Origin King Realm master, Li Ming Hai, Gu Jian Xin was even willing to sacrifice himself to save Ling Yue and An Xing.

This had left a good impression on Yang Kai.

Only people who valued love and brotherhood were worth making friends.

“Greetings, Young Master Yang!” Ling Yue and An Xing weren’t strangers to Yang Kai either. After seeing Yang Kai, they hurriedly bowed and greeted him in a crisp voice.

“Ladies, greetings to you too!” Yang Kai smiled and returned the greetings.

“Brother Yang, did this Gu catch you by surprise by waiting for you here?” Gu Jian Xin looked at Yang Kai, smiling.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment as various thoughts flashed in his mind. But then he said, “I was surprised but... it was within my calculations.”

“It seems Brother Yang knows why this Gu is here.”

“I can guess a little but I ask Brother Gu to make it clear,” Yang Kai said earnestly.

Gu Jian Xin nodded. “Talking with Brother Yang is really fun. If that’s the case, this Gu will shed some light.”

While speaking, he took out something from his Space Ring and said, handing it to Yang Kai, “Brother Yang, look at this.”

“Star Emperor Token!” Yang Kai’s eyes immediately lit up. He hurriedly took it from Gu Jian Xin’s hand.

This was the last Star Emperor Token. It looked exactly the same as those he had collected before. With this piece of the Star Emperor Token, he had gathered all nine Star Emperor Token crafted by that Great Emperor back then!

Gu Jian Xin smiled. “My father asked me to give this to you. He said that you need it.”

“Union Master Gu?” Yang Kai was taken aback for a moment. He then carefully put the Star Emperor Token away before speaking, “I wonder what are Union Master Gu’s conditions?”

He didn’t have much contact with the Sword Union. He had just a little friendship with Gu Jian Xin. Yang Kai didn’t believe that Union Master of Sword Union, Gu Cang Yun would hand over the Star Emperor Token just because of this. Obviously, there were other conditions.

Gu Jian Xin broke into laughter. He looked to Ni Guang and said, “Conditions, of course there are conditions. I beg Senior Ni to elaborate.”

Yang Kai turned to look at Ni Guang.

Ni Guang lightly coughed and said, “Yang Kai, it’s like this: President had already negotiated this matter for you before entering the retreat. Union Master Gu is willing to give you this Star Emperor Token for use and is also willing to become one of the six people. But... the condition is that you have to go to Sword Union and arrange the Cross-Cultivation-Star Space Arrays for them!”

“As I thought!” Yang Kai forced a wry smile.

He had already guessed it, but when he heard the request made by the Sword Union, he felt a little tired.

After all, helping the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce set up the Cross-Cultivation-Star Space Array wasn’t a matter of a day or two and the Sword Union had its own intelligence network. They would definitely get the news.

How could a great force not be greedy of the Cross-Cultivation-Star Space Array!

Yang Kai looked at Gu Jian and asked, frustrated, “How many Cultivation Stars does the Sword Union have?”

Gu Jian Xin replied with a grin, “It’s not that many, we have a little less than the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce. It’s just seventeen stars!”

Yang Kai stretched his hand out and rubbed his forehead.

It took him two years to set up Cross-Cultivation-Star Space Array for the eighteen stars of the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce. Presumably, it would take him no less than two years to set up another seventeen for the Sword Union.

“Brother Yang, an able man is always busy. My Sword Union is counting on you,” Gu Jian Xin persuaded.

“Are there any other conditions apart from this?” asked Yang Kai.

Gu Jian Xin forced a smile. “There is one, a unanimous request by my Sword Union Alchemists. I hope Grandmaster Yang can come to the Sword Union’s Home Star to teach Alchemy at least once!”

“Is this matter out too?” Yang Kai was having a big headache.

“Brother Yang, I’m afraid you don’t know how big your reputation in the Star Field is now!” Gu Jian Xin looked at Yang Kai with a strange look in his eyes. His eyes were filled with endless envy. “Brother Yang’s name is on everyone’s tongue in the Star Field today! You are a Second-Order Origin King and an Origin King Grade Alchemist as well! Who can compare with you? You have also triggered the Grand Alchemist Dao Tone, a matter that will be known for ages to come!”

Ni Guang added, nodding sincerely, “Yang Kai, since you have been moving around over these two years, maybe you haven’t heard much about it, but everyone in the Star Field has indeed heard of you.”

Gu Jian Xin added again, “Of course, my Sword Union won’t ask Brother Yang to work in vain. Every time you arrange a Cross- Cultivation Star Space Array, we will give you satisfactory compensation. Brother Yang, please don’t refuse. This Gu is begging you.”

While speaking, he bowed to Yang Kai in a serious manner.

Before coming here, Gu Cang Yun had said that if he couldn’t invite Yang Kai to the Sword Union, he could forget coming back. His father’s words were still ringing in his ears. How dare Gu Jian Xin dismiss them?

Yang Kai thought for a moment and agreed, nodding, “Brother Gu, don’t do this. I agree.”

“Really!?” Gu Jian Xin was overjoyed. “Excellent. I wonder when Brother Yang is planning to set off? The Sword Union isn’t very far from here!”

“Tomorrow, we will head straight to Azure Tree Star.”

“Azure Tree Star!?” Gu Jian Xin was a little confused. But very soon, he seemed to have thought of something. He asked in surprise, “Brother Yang, have you set up a Cross-Cultivation-Star Space Array on Azure Tree Star!?”

“Mhmm.” Yang Kai smiled and acknowledged it, nodding.

“That saves us a lot of time. Since that’s the case, this Gu will be waiting for Brother Yang’s good news.”

After coming out of the room, Yang Kai went straight to Xue Yue and told her about the next trip. Xue Yue was a little reluctant, but she couldn’t ask him to stay.

Furthermore, she knew that Yang Kai would be going to someplace called Star Boundary in the foreseeable future. If she wanted to remain by his side, she could only improve her cultivation. Otherwise, she would only become a burden.

“You don’t have to worry. I will enter a retreat after you leave, trying to break through to the Origin King Realm!” Xue Yue angrily said, “All your women are so great. I don’t want to be at the bottom.”

Yang Kai chuckled. “You don’t have to put so much pressure on yourself. You are also outstanding.”

Xue Yue immediately smiled sweetly.

“By the way, when Senior Ai Ou returns, be sure to hand this thing to him.” Yang Kai suddenly took out something from his Storage Ring and handed it to Xue Yue.

“What’s this!?”

“Star Chart, it will tell him where I am so he can look for me,” explained Yang Kai.

“I understand.”

“And one more thing, there is one last candidate left. Ask your father or Senior Long to be on a lookout. If they find anyone reliable, please invite him or her.”

“Alright, I will remember it.”

Staying up all night, Yang Kai explained the mystery of the Origin King Realm to Xue Yue, telling her how to form a Domain. Finally, he bid her goodbye in the morning.

Gu Jian Xin and his two sword servants, Ling Yue and An Xing had already finished their preparations. They were only waiting for Yang Kai to set off.

Yang Kai and his team went straight to the Cross-Cultivation-Star Space Array Hub at Water Sky City. Yang Kai tinkered with it a bit, connecting it to the Array on the Twin Shark Island of Azure Tree Star. Soon, their figures slowly disappeared under everyone’s gaze.

When their vision finally restored, Yang Kai, Gu Jian Xin, and the others were already in Yang Kai’s palace on the Twin Shark Island of Azure Tree Star.

Yue Xi and her disciples, He Zao and He Mao, who had been stationed at the palace, immediately greeted them. Over these few years they had not seen each other, Yue Xi and her disciples’ cultivation had also greatly improved with He Zao and He Miao entering the ranks of Origin Returning Realm masters.
