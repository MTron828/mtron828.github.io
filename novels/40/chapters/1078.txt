Just after the several guards stopped Yang Kai with smiles on their faces and were about to ask him to forgive them for carrying out their responsibilities, Xue Yue’s pleasant voice sounded off, “Let him in!”

Upon hearing this, the guards stepped aside, breathing deep sighs of relief, throwing out silent looks of encouragement as they did so.

Yang Kai was disinclined to deal with them, strode forward, pushed open the door with a cold look on his face, and walked inside.

There was no change in the room, everything was the same as it was the last time he visited. Xue Yue on the other hand somehow seemed worse for wear, her expression a mixture of sadness and gloom. She didn’t avoid Yang Kai’s angry eyes, nipping her lip lightly as she stared back at him, “Sit down, let’s talk.”

Seeing her appearance, Yang Kai had nowhere to vent his anger.

Women were truly unfair!

Obviously, her strength was far higher than his own, and if it came down to a fight he would definitely not be her opponent. She could punch him into submission at will, yet at this moment, she could rely solely on her expression to create the illusion of weakness.

Like the Heavens themselves had wronged her ...

Yang Kai picked up the teapot on the table, poured himself a cup, took a sip gently, then opened his mouth to say something, but before he could utter a word, Xue Yue’s jade finger landed on his lips.

Her fingers were icy cold, but there was still a faint fragrance on its tip.

“Don’t say anything, let me show you something first,” Xue Yue said lightly, with a softer tone than ever before.

“What?” Yang Kai immediately became vigilant, sweeping his eyes up and down Xue Yue before saying, “If it’s your body, there’s no need, every part of it has already been imprinted into my head, I can perfectly picture it even with my eyes closed.”

“A dog’s mouth can’t spit out ivory!” Xue Yue became ashamed and angry, “Do you think I’m the kind of woman who’d try to seduce a man with my body?”

“Then what do you want me to see?” Yang Kai ignored her question and asked.

Xue Yue glared angrily before pushing a sheet of paper over to him.

Yang Kai accepted the piece of paper, sipped his tea lightly and began browsing its content.

After a while, a strange expression appeared on his face and he grinned, “Xue Yue, these conditions are a bit too good, aren’t they? Just by becoming your guard, I’ll be paid a hundred thousand High-Rank Saint Crystals every year and obtain a five hundred kilometre radius domain?”

“Not really, my guards all obtain certain benefits, but everyone’s treatment is different,” Xue Yue took the teacup of tea in front of her and calmly took a sip, putting on a calm appearing, but the slight trembling of her hands betrayed her inner nervousness.

If before, the warm feelings she had for Yang Kai, and even the intimacy and affection she felt for him, had only been a result of the effects of the Soul Chains. However, right now she could say for certain that even without the bindings of the Soul Chains, those feelings wouldn’t completely disappear as they had taken root in her soul.

When forced actions and feelings became natural habits, they weren’t easy to change anymore.

What’s more, he had peered into her Knowledge Sea, and all of her secrets had been exposed, making her feel shyer and more embarrassed than if she was standing in front of him naked, allowing him to examine her.

Xue Yue sincerely hoped that Yang Kai would remain with her, even though she knew he couldn’t wait to get away from her.

While pretending to drink her tea, she quietly watched Yang Kai’s reaction, wanting to see if he showed any interest at all.

However, to her disappointment, Yang Kai showed no trace of temptation and only seemed to be curiously examining the different articles and clauses in the document.

“I’ll have twenty beautiful maids to serve me?” Yang Kai glanced up at Xue Yue with a raised brow, “Aren’t I just a guard? Am I supposed to have beautiful maids?”

“What’s so strange about it? An average person’s guard is naturally just a subordinate and not entitled to have such luxurious, but could my, Xue Yue’s, guards possibly not have such qualifications?” Xue Yue smiled deviously as she saw a trace of anticipation finally appear in Yang Kai’s eyes, quickly adding some embellishments, “I can choose the best women for you. You may not know this but my Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce also operates a slave business. Many big and small families that go bankrupt or fall into ruin will have their Young Ladies bought up by the chamber of commerce to later be sold. Each of these women have good education and their aptitudes and strength aren’t bad either. As far as I know, the strongest ones have reached the Saint King Realm. They’re nothing less than precious treasures!”

While she was colourfully describing these women to Yang Kai, she was silently cursing him out in her heart, she had offered him so many favorable conditions yet besides this one, he had treated them all indifferently. Xue Yue couldn’t help feeling the urge to reach out and choke him.

[Seems like he’s a man after all...]

Xue Yue sighed helplessly.

“Very good, very good!” Yang Kai nodded strongly a few times, he was truly quite interested in having some beautiful maids serving him. When he was back on Tong Xuan Realm, there were too many acquaintances around, and he didn’t dare act sloppily, but now that he had arrived in the Star Field all alone, such concerns didn’t exist anymore.

On top of that, since he took that last step with Little Senior Sister, Yang Kai had found that his mentality towards the happenings between men and women had changed greatly. At least, he no longer repelled the idea of having some fun here and there.

Back when he was staying in Shen Tu’s palace, his freewheeling activities had provided him with much food for thought.

“You think so too?” Xue Yue still maintained a smile on her face as she secretly ground her teeth before softly coaxing, “If you agree, then just leave your mark on the contract and from now on you’ll be my person and receive my shelter. From now on, if anyone dares to bar your way or offend you, you need only report my name, you’ll be able to walk sideways* in the Star Field if you so please.”

(Silavin: Walk sideways means, do anything you want)

“I’m not a crab,” Yang Kai smiled and put the instrument back on the table.

Xue Yue stared straight at him, her brow furrowing slightly.

Yang Kai let out a sigh, shifting his gaze away from hers as he said, “Why do this? You know what it is I want, what do you intend to do by asking me to sell myself into servitude?”

“Who said anything about selling yourself into servitude?” Xue Yue’s beautiful eyes dimmed as she said uprightly, “Isn’t it written at the very top? This contract is only valid for five years, if you’re not satisfied after five years, it can be renegotiated, I just want you to spend some time considering it.”

“After I sign, in this lifetime, I’ll never be able to leave. Xue Yue, let’s unlock the Soul Chains and from now on you will walk along the broad road while I traverse the narrow path, well water should not mix with river water,” Yang Kai said sincerely.

When Xue Yue heard these words, the impulse to cry welled up inside her but she stubbornly refused to let her tears fall, lifting her head and tilting her head back slightly.

Amazingly, the tears disappeared, seemingly drawn back into her tear glands through sheer force of will.

She then clenched her teeth and said, “I don’t care, everything that you could touch you touched and you even dove into the depths of my Knowledge Sea, peeping on all of my secrets, you have to sign this contract with me of the loss I suffered can’t possibly be made up!”

“If it’s about your secrets, you can rest assured I will keep them safe without leaking a single word, I won’t joke around with my life, I fully realize the strength and influence you possess,” Yang Kai said solemnly.

Xue Yue became even more indignant as she muttered, “It seems you even know that secret.”

Yang Kai scratched his cheek and said innocently, “I really wish I didn’t know it. Who could have guessed that you were hiding something even more shocking than the fact that you’re actually a woman! No wonder President Ai Ou forced you to live as a man, he did it for your sake and you shouldn’t blame him!”

“For my sake?” Xue Yue’s eyes suddenly flashed with cold light as she said dreadfully, “I was separated from my own mother for several decades, and then in order to keep this secret, my father killed everyone who knew it, including her, was that also for my own good?”

Yang Kai didn’t know how to respond.

What Xue Yue mentioned he had already uncovered from his time in her Knowledge Sea. This was her family’s matters though so it wasn’t appropriate for him to comment on it. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding Xue Yue’s mother’s death remained a mystery; even Xue Yue had only heard some rumours about it.

“So what if I possess the Dragon Marrow Phoenix Body? Could it be that everyone in the world can see through my physique come to snatch me for it?” Xue Yue screamed in anger, her proud chest heaving up and down in a souls stirring rhythm.

“Lower your voice!” Yang Kai called out in fright, “Do you not want to live anymore? Why would you yell out so crazily like that?”

Seeing Yang Kai act so nervous, Xue Yue couldn’t help feeling a little smug, the anger she just felt thrown a thousand kilometres away as she directed a smile towards him, “Right, you also know about this secret, so why didn’t you make a move? You should know what kind of advantages a Dragon Marrow Phoenix Body can bring to you.”

“Of course I know,” Yang Kai shot her a faint look, “According to what those people in your memory said, any man who is able to take your Primordial Yin will gain unimaginable benefits. The moon slave business of your Chamber of Commerce was actually inspired by your special constitution, right?”

Xue Yue gently nodded, “Yes! You can say that I am the highest quality Moon Slave in the Chamber of Commerce, but no one knows about it. While I was unconscious, you obviously had many opportunities; I don’t believe you weren’t tempted! You aren’t nearly that righteous.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Saying so, she directed a look towards him as if to say she had completely seen through him.

“You’re right, I was tempted, extremely tempted!” Yang Kai nodded firmly, “When I learned that secret, my first thoughts were to strip off your clothes and take possession of you.”

“Then why didn’t you?” Xue Yue asked curiously, “You also knew that even if you did that, I wouldn’t blame you for it. At worst I would beat you a bit.”

She said these words incredibly calmly, as if she wasn’t talking about her own innocence but that of another woman she didn’t know.

Yang Kai felt a headache and after a moment of silence declared, “I’m a man of principles!”

Xue Yue lips curled fiercely, obviously not believing a single word Yang Kai just said.

“According to the old man who first discovered your special constitution, the higher your strength, the greater the benefit the one who obtains you will gain. You are currently a Third-Order Saint King. If I really took you, I’m afraid the most I would be able to achieve would be breaking through the First Order Saint King Realm!” Yang Kai said lightly, “But so what? I don’t need the aid of your body to reach such a level. Do you believe I can’t achieve the same height in less than three years?”

Xue Yue stared at Yang Kai with a stunned look. Listening to his grand words, her beautiful eyes flashed in confusion for a moment before she nodded repeatedly then seemingly casually asked, “What if I wasn’t a Saint King, but an Origin King?”

Yang Kai swept his eyes over her once then without thinking said, “Then you’d already be my woman.”

The blur in Xue Yue’s beautiful eyes instantly disappeared and was replaced with endless contempt, cynically snapping, “So the truth is that in your mind, there just weren’t enough benefits!”

“Yes!” Yang Kai admitted frankly.

“And those high minded principles you were just spouting off about?” Xue Yue’s sneered as the contempt in her eyes grew even stronger.

“What are those worth? Can they be sold for money?” Yang Kai said in disdain.
