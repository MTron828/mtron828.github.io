10 years passed in the blink of an eye. On this day, Yang Kai opened his eyes inside the tree cave located in the World Tree clone. Closing the portal to his Small Universe, he severed his connection with the Star Boundary and breathed out deeply.

Although he had only cultivated in retreat for 10 short years, his overall strength had undergone Earth-shaking changes. When he looked inside himself, he discovered that the heritage of his Small Universe had more than doubled in depth compared to 10 years ago. That was not all. Even the various Dao Strengths in his Small Universe had gotten more potent during this period.

If the Ninth Order was divided into early, middle, and late stages, then Yang Kai had undoubtedly belonged in the early stage 10 years ago. In contrast, he was now well into the middle stage. The past 10 years of cultivation had been almost as effective as cultivating for 2,000 years with normal methods. It was the benefit of using the power of a Universe World to cultivate, as well as the exclusive right of a Great Emperor.

Furthermore, this outcome was the product of Yang Kai‚Äôs intentional restraint. If he had disregarded the consequences and opened his Small Universe wide to devour the World Energy to his heart‚Äôs content, he would have completely devoured the power of the Star Boundary in just a few short years.

Just like how his heritage had improved by leaps and bounds, the Star Boundary‚Äôs heritage had suffered a corresponding amount of damage as a result. Fortunately, the Star Boundary‚Äôs heritage was rich enough that there was not much impact on it even though a substantial amount of World Energy had been lost. At the very least, the cultivation and advancement of the cultivators in the Star Boundary would not be disrupted by this incident. Besides, the lost heritage would eventually be replenished by the World Tree clone‚Äôs continuous feedback.

Yang Kai had carefully planned everything in advance before he borrowed the power of the Star Boundary to boost his cultivation; after all, he could not disregard the future of all the living creatures in the Star Boundary just for his own selfish interests; otherwise, he would have done so a long time ago.

Even though this was the fastest growth in his cultivation he had ever experienced since he advanced to the Open Heaven Realm, Yang Kai could not shake the feeling that he had not grown enough.

Back in the Barren Territory, he and several other Ninth-Order Masters had worked together with Ah Da and Ah Er to fight the two Black Ink Giant Spirit Gods; hence, he was very familiar with the strength of the Giant Spirit Gods. According to Yang Kai‚Äôs estimations, he would need to reach the peak of the Ninth Order just to fight a Black Ink Giant Spirit God on even ground. Even then, it was nothing more than a possibility. Seeing as he was only in the mid-stage of the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm, it was obvious that he did not fulfil the basic requirements at the moment.

‚ÄúBig Brother, go to the Myriad Monsters World,‚Äù seeming to sense his intentions, Thunder Shadow‚Äôs voice appeared in his mind, ‚ÄúHave you forgotten? I am a Great Emperor of the Myriad Monsters World.‚Äù

Yang Kai chuckled at those words, ‚ÄúI did not forget.‚Äù

Yang Kai had been planning to take a trip to the Myriad Monsters World, but he had not been certain whether such a trip would be useful; after all, it would be more accurate to say that Thunder Shadow was dead. All that remained was Thunder Shadow‚Äôs consciousness. There was no saying whether Yang Kai would be recognized by the Myriad Monsters World‚Äôs Will. Nevertheless, it was something he had to try to find out.

With that in mind, Yang Kai left the tree cave and transformed into a stream of light, soaring into the sky. It did not take long for him to arrive in Myriad Monsters Territory by travelling through the Territory Gate; then, he flew straight in the direction of the Myriad Monsters World.

Many years had passed since Yang Kai first planted the World Tree clone in the Myriad Monsters World. Compared to back then, the barbaric Universe World where only ancient beasts existed now contained many traces of activity from the Human Race. In fact, the entire Myriad Monsters World could be said to be ruled by both the Human Race and Monster Race.

The Myriad Monsters World had consecutively given birth to many other Great Emperors since the birth of its first, Thunder Shadow. Most of them were from the Monster Race, but there were also a few from the Human Race. That was only natural since the Grand Dao in the Myriad Monsters World was more inclined towards the Grand Dao of the Monster Race.

Under the feedback from the World Tree clone, the Myriad Monsters World‚Äôs heritage was no longer comparable to the past. While it was not equal to the Star Boundary, it was certainly extremely abundant.

As soon as Yang Kai arrived in the Myriad Monsters World, he allowed Thunder Shadow to take over his physical body. They found an isolated place with nobody around, and then Thunder Shadow sat down cross-legged and opened both his mind and Small Universe to connect with the Myriad Monsters World. In the next moment, the same phenomenon that occurred in the Star Boundary repeated itself. The World Energy of the Myriad Monsters World poured into Yang Kai‚Äôs Small Universe without pause and became part of the Void World‚Äôs heritage

Upon seeing this situation, Yang Kai knew that Thunder Shadow‚Äôs status as a Great Emperor was still recognized by the Myriad Monsters World‚Äôs Will; otherwise, the connection would not have been formed so easily.

His actions immediately attracted the attention of the Great Emperors in the Myriad Monsters World, and when they learned that Yang Kai was behind the phenomenon, they couldn‚Äôt help feeling a little surprised. As far as they knew, only the Great Emperors of the Myriad Monsters World had the qualifications to perform such actions. Yang Kai was not a Great Emperor of the Myriad Monsters World, so how was he able to achieve such a feat?

In any case, the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm was not something any of them had ever achieved before. Combined with the fact that Yang Kai was often performing extraordinary stunts, they did not bother to question the situation even though they were puzzled.

‚Ä¶

Five years later, a general order was issued by the Supreme Headquarters and relayed throughout the lands where the Human Race inhabited.

When the news spread to the public, everybody knew‚Ä¶ the war was about to resume. Be that as it may, this war was different from the previous wars. In this war, the Human Race was taking the initiative to attack the No-Return Pass and launch an offensive against the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. If everything went smoothly, they might even succeed at eliminating the Black Ink Clan once and for all.

The Human Race Army that had been resting for the past 20 years assembled once more and set off for Black Territory. At every location where the Human Race inhabited, every single person came forward to send off the soldiers who were bravely heading to war. They did not seem overly worried or anxious. On the contrary, they were filled with determination and faith that they would not give up until they broke through the enemy‚Äôs defences. When the belief rooted itself in their very being, they firmly believed that the Human Race Army would be invincible and indomitable!

For a time, all the places that the Human Race‚Äôs various outposts and bases became deserted as all those with the ability to participate in the war had set off to join the fight.

In just three months, the 12 Armies had gathered in Black Territory. The entire Black Territory instantly became overcrowded. As Warship after Warship continuously arrived, they eventually formed an enormous fleet.

At this moment, Mi Jing Lun stood with his hands behind his back on a Universe Fragment where the Supreme Headquarters was located, outside of Pure Yang Pass. He stared fixedly at the Territory Gate in the direction of High Heaven Territory. He knew that many of the soldiers who embarked on this mission might never return home. There was a high possibility that many of them would lose their lives on the battlefield.

Nevertheless, it was a decision that had to be made. It was also a painful tragedy that the Human Race was bound to face one day. They could never coexist with the Black Ink Clan, and this war would either see their ultimate rise or eternal fall. They would either destroy their enemy or perish in the attempt!

A stream of light suddenly came from afar. When the light came closer, Ou Yang Lie‚Äôs figure was revealed and Mi Jing Lun inquired, ‚ÄúHow is it?‚Äù

Ou Yang Lie shook his head, ‚ÄúHe is still cultivating in retreat at the moment, but he should be done soon. The World Energy of the Myriad Monsters World has almost been drawn to the limit before it will severely affect the Universe World. That brat will never drain the lake just to catch the fish, after all.‚Äù

Mi Jing Lun nodded and suddenly seemed fascinated, ‚ÄúI wonder how much his strength has grown by now.‚Äù

Ou Yang Lie had a nonchalant attitude towards the question, ‚ÄúIn any case, he is bound to be much stronger than you or I.‚Äù Then, he couldn‚Äôt help clicking his tongue in mock annoyance, ‚ÄúIf I had known earlier, I would have found a Universe World and become the Great Emperor there.‚Äù

Mi Jing Lu burst out laughing, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs useless even if you become a Great Emperor. The feedback from the World Tree clone is the only reason the Star Boundary and the Myriad Monsters World have such rich heritage. The Great Emperors of ordinary Universe Worlds would not be able to emulate him.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true.‚Äù Ou Yang Lie nodded, ‚ÄúAs the saying goes, ‚ÄòHeroes are born during troubled times‚Äô. While it is different for the Myriad Monsters World, I‚Äôm sure that brat never expected the Star Boundary to become one of the last hopes of the Human Race when he first planted the World Tree clone there.‚Äù

If not for the Star Boundary, it would have been impossible for the Human Race to possess such powerful heritage in the present circumstances. Be that as it may, Yang Kai had only planted the World Tree clone in the Star Boundary to save his dying homeland at the time.

Needless to say, his Small Universe and the Myriad Monsters World also played a huge role in the grand scheme of things. It was precisely because of these three Open Heaven Realm Cradles that countless talented individuals were perpetually being produced among the Human Race.

‚ÄúHow is the situation with the Void Guard?‚Äù Ou Yang Lie asked.

‚ÄúThe Space Arrays connecting the Star Boundary to the No-Return Pass are already being installed, so it should be completed soon,‚Äù Mi Jing Lun replied.

At the moment, their rear was practically deserted. All the cultivators with the slightest ability to participate in the war had been recruited into the Human Race Army; therefore, only a small number of the old and weak had been left behind.

The reason the old and weak had remained behind was not to protect the rear though. To put it bluntly, the Human Race would go extinct if they failed to obtain victory in this war, so there was no point in leaving behind the old and infirm when they could not protect anything either. On the contrary, the main reason they stayed behind was to guide the cultivation of the younger generations. Doing so would ensure that the Human Race had a steady stream of fresh blood being produced in the future, which was extremely crucial for them to gain the capital required to support the frontlines during the war.

Originally, it would have taken even an Eighth-Order or Ninth-Order Master quite some time to travel from the Star Boundary to Black Territory; however, the presence of the Teleportation Road laid by the Void Guard would greatly shorten the travel time required. Besides, this was simply the early stages of their preparations. Once the Human Race Army conquered the No-Return Pass, they would further proceed with the Space Arrays that would eventually connect directly to the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction.

After exchanging some pleasantries, Ou Yang Lie said, ‚ÄúSince everything is going smoothly, I will head to Black Territory first.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo ahead. Relay the order for the troops to wait at ease,‚Äù Mi Jing Lun instructed.

Ou Yang Lie nodded and left in a flash.

A few days later, Mi Jing Lun‚Äôs wait finally ended. He suddenly raised his head to look in a certain direction. There seemed to be a figure rapidly approaching him from that direction. A short while later, a figure stepped out from the ripples in the Void. It was none other than Yang Kai, who was late.

‚ÄúLong time no see,‚Äù Yang Kai nodded lightly at Mi Jing Lun.

Mi Jing Lun studied Yang Kai for a moment. Although he could not determine the depth of Yang Kai‚Äôs strength, the aura that was inadvertently emanating gave him a heavy sense of oppression.

It had to be said that Mi Jing Lun was also in the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. The fact that Yang Kai gave him a sense of oppression meant that the latter‚Äôs strength had grown tremendously during this period. After all, he did not experience this feeling from Yang Kai 20 years ago. He couldn‚Äôt help feeling taken aback, ‚ÄúWhat do you estimate your current strength is like?‚Äù

Yang Kai did not know how to answer Mi Jing Lun‚Äôs abrupt question. According to his personal breakdown of the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm, he had entered the late middle stage of the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm after devouring and refining the heritage of the Myriad Monsters World.

After pondering in silence for a moment, he answered the question, ‚ÄúThe me right now can defeat three of me from 20 years ago!‚Äù

The explanation was so novel and unique that the corners of Mi Jing Lun‚Äôs mouth twitched in response; however, he soon became shocked.

The Yang Kai from 20 years ago had already been very strong, but the current Yang Kai could defeat three of himself from that past‚Ä¶ In just 20 years, his strength had improved significantly. It was difficult to imagine just how much he had grown after devouring and refining the power of two Open Heaven Realm Cradles.

Nevertheless, this was a good thing for the Human Race. There were not many Ninth-Order Masters at the moment, so the greater Yang Kai‚Äôs strength, the greater the suppression he could exert against the Black Ink Clan.
