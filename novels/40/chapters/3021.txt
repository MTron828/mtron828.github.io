Half a day later, Yang Kai and Li Jiao sat opposite each other in a teahouse. The fragrance of the tea tickled their noses, but both of them remained silent.

Half a day of observation had given them a lot of time to see many things. Half-Dragon City was extremely strange. Putting aside how odd it was to see so many Dragonborn in one place, just the number of Masters here was staggering. At least 1 out of 1,000 people in the street were in the Emperor Realm. To put it into perspective, the population of this city was approximately 500,000. In other words, there were 500 to 600 Emperors living in this Half-Dragon City!

[What is this!? There are simply too many of them!]

There were countless cities across the entire Star Boundary, both large and small; however, no other city would ever have enough Emperor Realm Masters to compare with Half-Dragon City. Oftentimes, just a dozen Emperors living in one city was an astonishing sight. And, even those numbers had taken the Emperor Realm Masters that were simply passing by into account. 100 was impossible let alone 500!

Even if the World Energy here was extremely pure and helped the cultivators break through quickly, the ratio was still too frightening to think about. To put it into perspective, even the Top Sects such as Azure Sun Temple had no more than a dozen Emperor Realm Masters among their ranks. That wasn’t even a fraction of the numbers in Half-Dragon City.

In addition, Dragonborn with the Dragon Clan’s bloodline seemed to have a generally higher status in Half-Dragon City. Of those in the same cultivation realm, a Dragonborn was often the leader among their peers.

Yang Kai made a conjecture that if all the Masters in this city were to take up arms, they would have enough strength to take over any city and any top Sect in the Star Boundary. Only the Great Emperor Sects would be able to put up some resistance against Half-Dragon City. This entire city was like an invincible army!

However, both Yang Kai and Li Jiao also discovered something else that was strange. The Dragonborn, especially those with slightly purer bloodlines, seemed to suffer from unstable auras. No matter how high or low their cultivation, they seemed unsteady on their feet and looked as if they were suffering from hidden injuries. Moreover, the higher the cultivation among those in the Emperor Realm, the fewer the Dragonborn among them.

[What’s with this situation?] Yang Kai and Li Jiao had even more trouble understanding.

Logically speaking, the Dragonborn had a unique advantage in cultivating due to the Dragon Clan’s blood in them. Take Li Jiao for example. If he had not been a Dragonborn, his cultivation journey would have ended when he was in the Second-Order Emperor Realm. It was because of his Dragon Clan bloodline that he was able to break through to the Third-Order Emperor Realm.

Strangely enough; the situation seemed to be reversed in Half-Dragon City. The purer the Dragon Clan’s bloodline, the harder it was for their cultivation to advance, and they reached the end of their cultivation in the Second-Order Emperor Realm. Thus, most Dragonborn cultivators were only First-Order Emperors. Contrarily, there were Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters among those that did not have the Dragon Clan’s bloodline in them, such as the Humans and Monsters.

After staying in the teahouse for a long time and listening to the conversations around them, Yang Kai and Li Jiao did not hear anything that stood out too much. The only thing that caught their attention was when one person accidentally mentioned the words ‘Dragon Palace’. Unfortunately, that person immediately realized that he had said something that was not supposed to be said and quickly changed the subject. It had left Yang Kai and Li Jiao feeling frustrated.

Half-Dragon City, Dragon Palace, Dragonborn… There were all indications that this place was none other than Dragon Island itself. However, Yang Kai found that hard to believe in the face of a population of several hundreds of thousands. [How can there be so many people on Dragon Island?]

Li Jiao was also confused. The difference between this place and what he had imagined was so vast that he could not accept reality.

While the two of them were immersed in their silence, a loud commotion sounded from the opposite shop. It sounded like a quarrel and immediately following that, Emperor Qi surged and Principles churned. The sound of something hitting the ground rang out, followed by a shocked exclamation. At the same time, a figure flew out from the shop and landed heavily on the ground.

The figure turned out to be a woman dressed in a light yellow dress. She had a head of black hair that fell to her shoulders like a waterfall while the shape of her back was slender and graceful. It was too bad that her face remained out of sight. The aura coming from her body was also not weak; she was a First-Order Emperor Realm Master.

Nobody knew who she had gotten into a conflict with inside that shop for her to be beaten up and thrown out but it seemed as though the injuries she suffered were not light. When the pedestrians on the street saw the commotion, they hurriedly evaded the area. Without knowing the cause and effect, no one was willing to stick their nose into another’s affairs, lest they bring trouble upon themselves.

“Mother!” A child’s voice cried out with a trace of sobbing. The woman lying on the ground got up with some difficulty, wiped the fresh blood from the corner of her mouth, and glared in front of her with a livid gaze. Her entire body trembled uncontrollably, whether from anger or fear remained unknown to the people.

“Hmph!” A cold snort rang out and a man walked out of the shop with a sullen expression. His movements were neither fast nor slow. His hand was slightly lifted, grabbing a girl by her hair and dragging her outside with him. Caught in that manner, the girl could only walk after him with her body half-arched backwards.

The girl was beautiful. She looked fairly young, and her body wasn’t very well-developed. With two small bulges on her chest, she looked extremely petite and exquisite. All in all, she looked no more than 15 or 16 years old. Her eyes were reddened, and tears slid down her cheeks. She seemed to be frightened, and her expression was filled with panic. Looking ahead of her, she cried out again, “Mother, please save me!”

Listening to her cries for help, this girl seemed to be the daughter of the woman that had been thrown out of the shop before.

“Let her go!” That woman growled through gritted teeth. The Emperor Qi in her body churned violently while her posture indicated that she was desperate to rush forward and fight; however, her daughter had been captured which made her hesitant to act, lest she cause her daughter to be harmed. She didn’t dare to act hastily regardless of how furious she was.

Besides, the cultivation of that sinister and vicious-looking man wasn’t just higher than hers; he was also a Dragonborn. Even if she fought with her life on the line, she would still be no match for him.

“Let her go?” The sinister and vicious-looking man looked at the woman and laughed coldly, “Why should I let her go just because you asked me to? What thing are you?”

Disdain was dripping from his words and it was obvious that he did not put the woman in front of him in his eyes. While he was speaking, he lowered his head and took a sniff at the girl’s hair. Then, he suddenly showed an expression of ecstasy, “How fragrant. I just love little girls like her.”

The girl had never gone through such experiences before and feeling the burning aura coming from behind, she stiffened and wept even harder, crying out pitifully, “Mother…”

“Don’t you dare!” The woman was enraged by the sight. Gnashing her teeth, she yelled, “Do you know whose daughter she is? How dare you act so frivolously toward her?!”

The sinister and vicious-looking man sneered, “Of course I know whose daughter she is!”

The woman seemed stunned by those words. She clearly had not expected the other party to reply in such a manner. At first, she assumed that the other party was abusing his authority and harassing them; thus, she only needed to bring out the name of her daughter’s father to make the other party back off in fear, leaving the mother-daughter pair unharmed. Who could have expected that it would have no effect at all?

She couldn’t help but feel her heart sinking, knowing that the situation was against her. The other party had been targeting her all along. He must have investigated them beforehand so threatening him with the father’s identity was no longer of any use.

The sinister and vicious-looking man said, “Did you think that person would care about a Human like you? If he cared, he wouldn’t have driven the two of you out!”

As soon as the words left his mouth, not only did that woman’s expression darken, but the expressions of the onlookers also became dejected. They looked as if they had gone through the same experience that woman did.

“Believe me; even if I strip her naked right here and right now, nobody will care about what happens to you!” The sinister and vicious-looking man said, placing his hand on the girl’s shoulder.

The girl’s body stiffened abruptly. Her tears slid down her cheeks uncontrollably like a broken string of pearls.

The woman standing opposite him was incredibly shocked by those words and shrieked, “No!”

If he really stripped her daughter naked here, then her daughter would never be able to hold her head high in public again. In the worst case, her daughter might even commit suicide. Her daughter was the only thing that made living bearable so how could she just watch this travesty happen?

The words of that sinister and vicious-looking man made many of the onlookers frown in response. They felt that he was going too far and somebody immediately piped up, “Hey, Friend. It’s not necessary to drive them into a corner. Even if they provoked you in some way, there’s no need to humiliate them in this manner, right?”

The moment that person spoke up, the expression of his companion next to him immediately changed drastically. His companion hurriedly tugged at him and whispered something in his ear. Following that, his expression changed too and his face became rather sickly and ashen.

The sinister and vicious-looking man turned to look in that person’s direction and sneered, “What did you say just now? I didn’t hear you clearly. Why don’t you repeat that?”

That person’s complexion paled further as he cupped his fists and bowed, responding in a low voice, “Sir, please forgive me. I failed to choose my words carefully. Please forgive me if I have offended you, Sir.”

The sinister and vicious-looking man stared at him coldly and a long while passed before he suddenly shouted, “Scram!”

When that person heard that word, he reacted as if he was granted a pardon by the Heavens. He hurriedly turned around and fled. Although he was willing to stand up against injustice if it was within his capabilities, he did not have the courage to do so when his life was at risk.

The rest of the onlookers saw the scene unfolding before them and understood that the Dragonborn in the Second-Order Emperor Realm was very influential. He might have a powerful backer supporting him, otherwise, his threat alone could not have been such a great deterrent.

Some of the others could recognize that sinister and vicious-looking man. Thus, they knew just where his confidence was coming from. Sighing, they thought to themselves, [Both of them are done for. They could have offended anybody in the world, but they just had to offend this bastard. Their futures will not be easy.]

After throwing his weight around, the sinister man turned his head to look at the girl’s mother and said with a smug expression, “Do you know what to do now?”

How could the woman not know what he was talking about? She clenched her fists so hard that her nails cut into her palms. Even so, she did not feel the pain. Lifting her eyes to look at her daughter, she smiled sadly and slowly got down on her knees. Prostrating herself, she pressed her forehead against the backs of her palms and aggrievedly said, “I… am willing to serve you, Sir. Please let my daughter go!”

The corners of his mouth lifted into a jeering sneer. The woman’s lowly posture satisfied him greatly and his gaze lingered on her round and tight bottom for a while before he leisurely swaggered over. All of a sudden, he lashed out and kicked the woman to the ground. The force of his kick was not small and caused the woman to roll across the ground several times before she stopped.

“Mother!” The girl cried out sorrowfully when she saw that.

“Shut up!” The sinister and vicious-looking man slapped his palm across the girl’s cheeks, causing her face to swell up greatly.

It could be that she had been scared senseless and did not dare to say anything else again after that. The pupils of her bright eyes dilated with fear.

Meanwhile, the sinister and vicious-looking man kicked the woman again. It was clear that he was not done with her. Stepping forward, he stomped one foot down on her chest, causing her voluptuous peaks to deform from the pressure.

The woman’s expression was twisted in pain, but even so, she called out to her daughter, “Close your eyes!”

She did not want her child to see the state she was in right now.
