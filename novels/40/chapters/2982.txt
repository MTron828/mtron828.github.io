“Call your Elder Sister here,” Yang Kai looked at Zhu Lie and ordered.

Zhu Lie lightly snorted. Although he was unhappy with Yang Kai’s overbearing tone, he didn’t haggle with him much. Having heard everything so far, he prompted his Dragon Essence and formed a few hand seals as his lips moved up and down a few times.

Yang Kai turned his attention back to the Charm Demon and smilingly asked, “If I ask you which Demon King you would like to kill, who would you pick?”

The Charm Demon’s face changed after hearing this and she immediately asked, shocked, “Sir, what do you mean?”

“I’m just asking, who do you find the most disgusting?”

The Charm Demon replied with a forced smile, “Sir, please don’t joke, we all belong to the Demon Race. We stand together and help each other in times of difficulty. All in Demon Fury City are brothers and sisters, how can we find each other… disgusting?”

Other Demon Kings puffed their chests after hearing this, trying their best to assume the stance of sharing life and death together in adversity. Although no one knew why Yang Kai was asking this, everyone felt that something wasn’t right.

This Human seemed to have some ill-intentions, and it was by no means as friendly as he looked on the surface. He was a beast shrouded in the wool of a sheep, one that would attack if they accidentally touched it.

Yang Kai’s brow twitched as he declared, “The opportunity is in your hand, it will be gone once you let it slip away.”

The Charm Demon didn’t say a word, hesitating for a time before using her Divine Sense stealthily.

Yang Kai raised his eyes, looking toward one side, his gaze happening to land on a sinister-looking Demon King. This Demon King was surging with Blood Qi, forming a faint red halo around his body. He seemed to be a member of the Blood Demon Clan and there was an uneasy expression on his face, as if he was worried about something.

When Yang Kai’s gaze swept over him, he immediately reacted, shouting at the Charm Demon, grinding his teeth in anger, “Slut, how dare you betray me!”

The Charm Demon had her red lips pursed and her face turned a little pale, but she said nothing to the accusation of the Blood Demon.

The Blood Demon grew angrier, “Ungrateful slut! When you were under my crotch, you did everything to seduce me, but now that you’ve climbed a higher branch, you want to kill me!? I should have known never to trust a wench like you!”

The Charm Demon became angry out of shame and rebuked, gritting her teeth, “Although I am a Charm Demon, I’m not loose! If you hadn’t forced yourself on me, why would I…”

“Hahaha!” The Blood Demon broke into laughter as Blood Qi fiercely surged from him, “Enough with the sophistry. The Charm Demon Clan are all cheap sluts! If it wasn’t for this King’s help, how could you have ever reached the Demon King Realm with your aptitude!? You think that this King had no idea that you have been secretly hooking up with other people all these years? And you still have the gall to say that you aren’t loose? Now, you are just a piece of rotten meat that not even the wild dogs would bother to sniff! Even if you kneel down and beg me, this King wouldn’t touch you!”

“What nonsense!?” Charm Demon screamed before she turned and begged, looking at Yang Kai, “Sir, although this slave has no idea what you want to do, if you want to kill someone, please kill him! The slave will be at your beck and call in the future.”

“How dare you want to kill me!? I’ll kill you first!” The Blood Demon erupted and the moment he raised his hand, a beam of bloody light shot straight towards the Charm Demon. The beam then exploded, transforming into a rain of blood that poured down over a large area.

The blood rain seemed to be extremely corrosive and made sizzling noises even as it fell through the air.

The Charm Demon immediately screamed. Her cultivation was much lower than the Blood Demon’s so she couldn’t resist his attack. She promptly retreated as she chanted some verse in the Demon language, while repeatedly swinging her arms, shooting pure Demon Qi out again and again. Nevertheless, she was unable to stop the blood rain from falling on her.

*Chi chi chi chi…* T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The drops of blood rain melted through the Charm Demon’s defences, corroding her clothes, laying a large part of her body bare. The exposed skin was then stained by the blood rain and quickly rotted away, turning into pus and dripping down along her body. At some places, her white bones could even be seen, making her look extremely miserable.

“Die slut!” The Blood Demon didn’t give up and charged straight at the Charm Demon. By the looks of his posture, he wanted to finish her once and for all.

The Charm Demon’s face turned pale in horror. She did her best to retaliate but was unable to stop the Blood Demon from charging. She felt death approaching and believed no matter what, she would not survive this.

But suddenly, the Blood Demon collapsed in the mid-air, blowing up as an endless wave of blood shot straight towards Yang Kai. Its momentum was quite shocking, giving the impression of a tidal wave. The tsunami of blood was extremely powerful and destructive, seemingly capable of sweeping away all things in existence, and at the forefront of the blood wave, the Blood Demon’s face slowly emerged. He seemed to be riding the waves, fiercely rushing towards Yang Kai.

Attacking the Charm Demon was just a cover, that’s all. His real target was always Yang Kai.

Although he didn’t want to have a conflict with Yang Kai, having been stirred by the Charm Demon, he had been pushed to the edge of the storm. If he wanted to survive it, he had no choice but to strike first.

The red-haired young man was too terrifying. Even the top Demon King was instantly killed, so the Blood Demon didn’t dare to have any thoughts of attacking him whatsoever.

Although Yang Kai had killed a few Demon Kings, he had done it by depending on the might of an artifact, so in the Blood Demon’s opinion, Yang Kai’s own strength might not be that great. Now was his opportunity to take Yang Kai down while he had not yet summoned his artifact.

[As long as I can capture this Human, I can have the absolute upper hand!] Thinking so, the Blood Demon immediately made his move. Furthermore, he was extremely confident that he would succeed.

At that moment, he noticed a meaningful grin on Yang Kai’s face. The smile promptly made his confidence hit rock bottom as he inexplicably felt that he was a sheep throwing himself at a wolf. He immediately felt that he had made a fatal mistake.

The hesitation in his heart caused his blood wave incarnation to freeze for a moment.

Yang Kai raised his hand and flicked his fingers.

*Chi chi chi chi…*

Crescent-shaped pitch-black slashes cut through the blood waves like hot knives through butter.

Every Moon Blade made the Blood Demon grunt in pain as his crimson halo dimmed, reducing the size of the blood wave.

After seven or eight Moon Blades, the blood wave converged to a point as the Blood Demon’s figure re-appeared and staggered not too far away from Yang Kai.

Yang Kai quickly formed hand seals as a solemn look appeared on his face while a faint Time Principle fluctuation rose from his body.

“Time Flows on Infinitely, Like a Mighty Stream, Like an Unending Dream!”

He lightly smacked his palm out, hitting the absent-minded Blood Demon in a flash, who immediately spurted a mouthful of blood before his figure flew away like a kite. Somehow, the Blood Demon regained his wits after taking this hit and his figure jolted as he transformed into rays of blood light that shot off in multiple directions.

The serious injuries he had suffered in that brief clash let the Blood Demon, who was a powerful Demon King, know that he had greatly underestimated his opponent. From the start, he wasn’t Yang Kai’s opponent.

Now, he just wanted to escape, the farther the better.

“Blood Shadow Escape Technique!” Yang Kai lightly snorted before sneering, “If it was Shadow Demon Clan’s Divine Shadow Slayer Escape Technique, then this Young Master may have taken a little more time to solve it, but you dare act so arrogant in front of this Young Master with mere Blood Shadow Escape? Watch how this Young Master instantly breaks it.” Saying so, Yang Kai’s gaze quickly swept through various streaks of blood light in succession before he focused his gaze on one in particular and pointed his finger at it.

Immediately, Space Principles surged, turning the area around that streak of blood light into an invisible cage.

The streak of blood light crashed into the cage wall and was knocked back as a pale Blood Demon appeared.

“How is this possible!?” He couldn’t help but cry out in shock.

The Blood Shadow Escape Technique was one of the Blood Demon Clan’s Innate Divine Abilities, one that boasted superior concealment and speed. If an ordinary person encountered this Divine Ability, he or she wouldn’t be able to distinguish between the real and fake bodies.

The Blood Demon never expected a mere First-Order Emperor Realm Human boy to see through it.

And the words this young man had spoken just now horrified him even more. The Blood Demon’s Blood Shadow Escape Technique and the Divine Shadow Slayer Escape Technique were both Innate Divine Abilities. Even for the Demon Race’s Demon Kings, it would be too difficult to see through these techniques, but judging by this Human’s confident tone, he was well versed and experienced with the unique skills of the Demon Race.

The Blood Demon was horrified to the extreme and his entire body had gone cold.

He tried to use his escape technique again, but a figure had appeared before him; Yang Kai was already blocking his way.

The Blood Demon immediately gasped in horror, hurriedly retreating.

“Look at me!” Yang Kai spoke in a heavy tone, his voice seemingly carrying an irresistible power. The Blood Demon instinctually looked up at him when he heard this and when their eyes met, the Blood Demon saw the opposite party’s left eye turn into a vertical golden slit. The majestic golden glow of this eye seemed to suck away his Soul, shaking his Knowledge Sea, rendering him unable to have any thought of looking away. The next moment, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense surged like a tide as a budding lotus flower flashed away from his left eye, shooting straight into the Blood Demon’s Knowledge Sea.

In an instant, the Blood Demon’s thoughts froze even more firmly as he stood rooted on the spot, dumbstruck.

His Knowledge Sea had collapsed. The Blood Demon was now as good as a walking corpse.

A figure rushed over from the side at that moment, its eyes filled with deep-rooted hatred, holding a white bone dagger. The bone dagger didn’t appear to belong to any kind of Ominous Beast. Rather it was more like a bone left behind by a Human or Demon Race Master, one that had been refined into a Demon Artifact using some unknown technique.

The aura of the bone dagger was pretty good, and it was ruthlessly thrust straight towards the head of the rooted Blood Demon, wanting to reap his life in a single blow.

Yang Kai promptly sent out a palm along with a cold snort, knocking the Charm Demon away, who crawled back up and doubtfully asked, wiping the blood from the corner of her lips, “Sir?”

The Charm Demon’s condition was pretty miserable at the moment. Her clothes were in tatters, and ugly pustules could be found all over her beautiful figure. Many of these pustules were bleeding, radiating an unpleasant aura.

She was far weaker than the Blood Demon, and was nearly killed by his opening attack. Coupled with the humiliation she had suffered, she naturally wanted to take revenge.

It was just that she couldn’t understand why Yang Kai would stop her; after all, it was Yang Kai who asked her who she wanted to kill in the first place.

“What do you think you’re doing?” Yang Kai coldly looked at her, the golden glow remaining in his left eye. The Charm Demon’s entire body went cold as she hurriedly explained, “Didn’t Sir want to kill him? I only wished to assist you!”

“If I want to kill someone, I can do it myself, why would I need your help?” Yang Kai lightly snorted.

The Charm Demon tremblingly admitted her mistake, “This Mistress was wrong, Sir, please don’t be angry!”

She knew that she had to be submissive if she wanted to survive, so she didn’t dare show any grievance or anger.

Yang Kai simply ignored her though and looked over at the nearby Zhu Lie.
