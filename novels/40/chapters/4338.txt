It was indeed Xiao Hong’s and Xiao Hei’s blessing that they could follow Bi Xi. Bi Xi had lived for many years and had knowledge to match. Any wisdom that he could pass to them would benefit them for life.

Yang Kai also wanted to get closer to Bi Xi, so he took this opportunity to do him a favour.

After returning to his own room, Yang Kai continued to heal while in retreat.

Ten days later, in the Main Conference Hall of Earth Spirit Land, Yang Kai sat at the head seat, with the Left and Right Protectors, Yue He and Mo Mei, to his left and right. Further below were the members of the Elder Council.

Yue He and Mo Mei were Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, while among the members of the Elder Council, other than Chen Tian Fei being a Fourth-Order, the rest were all Fifth-Order. Void Land had now become a place full of upcoming talents, and not many places in the entire 3,000 Worlds could compare with them.

Furthermore, Void Land was founded just a few years ago. Compared to it, how many generations had those top-tier Second Class great forces inherited to become where they were today? Of course, Void Land had the upper hand mostly thanks to the recruitment of the Abundance City cultivators, but this was also due to Yang Kai’s capabilities.

It was the first time that the leaders of Void Land had gathered for such a meeting to discuss its future direction. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, before that, they talked to each other about all the gains and losses of the previous battle. Although it was a landslide victory for Void Land, it did not mean that they did not make any mistakes. Any great force that rose would have to go through all kinds of hardships. Such a battle was the nutrient and catalyst for the growth of Void Land, and it only did good to Void Land but no harm.

The scene of everyone’s bustling discussion was rather lively.

When the crowd calmed down a little, Yang Kai started, “Although our Void Land has won a complete victory in this battle, we shouldn’t take things lightly. Don’t ever think that the great forces of 3,000 Worlds are easy to bully. This time, we had the upper hand because the enemy had extremely limited or outright inaccurate information about us and the power of our Grand Array, which is why we could have such outstanding results. If Kong Feng had known the heritage of our Void Land in advance, it would have been a far, far more difficult battle. Everyone should strive to cultivate and strengthen yourselves going forward.”

Everyone naturally agreed with him; after all, they were already aware of this without Yang Kai needing to say it. Although there were a lot of Open Heaven Realm Masters in Void Land, 99% of them had only just broken through. They were insufficient in terms of heritage and their foundations weren’t even stable yet. When fighting alone with the cultivators in the same Realm, they would obviously be put at a disadvantage. Regarding this, Yue He and Mo Mei clearly experienced it.

Especially Mo Mei. When she was fighting against Luan Bai Feng, she was being suppressed almost the whole time and could only keep defending.

However, they would need a lot of resources if everyone started cultivating, especially Open Heaven Pills and cultivation materials of all Orders would be in high demand.

If they did not recently experience such a battle, the finances in Void Land would be tight again.

Fortunately, they had killed almost 10,000 enemies in the recent battle, and gained many spoils of war, which was sufficient to meet the needs of Void Land for a short time.

Second Manager Bian Yu Qing immediately stood up and briefly reported the amount seized. After listening for a while, Yang Kai nodded lightly and ordered, “Second Manager, please take care of the matter of cultivation resources, we must make sure we meet the needs of all cultivators in the Sect.”

Bian Yu Qing replied respectfully, “Yes!”

A contribution points system had been implemented in Void Land now. All the cultivators who participated in the previous battle had earned a large number of contribution points and could exchange them for the resources they needed. As for how to keep supply and demand in balance, Yang Kai did not need to worry about it, for Bian Yu Qing and the Elder Council would come up with a solution.

Yang Kai looked around as his fingers gently clasped the armrest of his chair as he added, “But we can’t just sit idly and consume our resources. Any great force that wishes to prosper needs a variety of income sources, which our Void Land currently lacks. Although we earned a great deal this time, sooner or later, there will come a day when those spoils will be depleted. If we want to grow and flourish in the future, we need to start earning as well.”

Yun Xing Hua immediately cupped his fist, “Sir, please allow this subordinate to return to the Star City. I will definitely take care of it well for Sir!”

Yang Kai responded, “Naturally, we can’t lose the Star City as it is our greatest source of income and will likely continue to be so in the future. However, with the current scale of the Star City, I’m afraid it won’t be sufficient to supply Void Land in the long run.”

In the past, the number of Open Heaven Realm Masters in Void Land was small, so the income of the Star City could still balance the budget, and even run a small surplus. But the situation was different now. With the addition of more than 300 Open Heaven Realm Masters all at once, the daily consumption of Open Heaven Pills alone became a massive number, so the revenue of the Star City was falling far short.

Yang Kai looked around and asked, “Does anyone have any good ideas?”

The group from Abundance City looked around at each other but did not know what to do. After all, they just entered the Outer Universe, and knew nothing about the outside world. Since now the topic was about the continuous development of Void Land, what good suggestions could they give?

Yun Xing Hua pondered a little and then cupped his fist, “Sir, perhaps we could find a way to procure more resources in Void Territory.”

Yang Kai turned to look at him, “Tell me more.”

Yun Xing Hua explained, “In any Great Territory, there are many great forces and Universe Worlds. The periphery of these great forces and the various Universe Worlds should have been developed long ago. If there were resources anywhere, they would have been pocketed by others by now. However, this does not mean that there is no value in searching the rest of the Great Territory. Perhaps there are some unknown places that contain undiscovered resources, especially the existence of Universe Cave Heavens and Universe Paradises. A Universe Paradise was found 3,000 years ago in our Shocking Swan Territory, inside Shocking Swan Pavilion’s domain. It was precisely because of the development of that Universe Paradise that Shocking Swan Pavilion became the overlord of Shocking Swan Territory!”

Yang Kai raised his brow, “A Universe Paradise?”

Universe Paradises and Universe Cave Heavens were the Small Universes left behind after the death of High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters. The Small Universes of High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters were essentially no different from true Universe Worlds; therefore, after such a Master’s death, there was a chance that the Small Universes in their body would not collapse but instead maintain its structure and merge with the Void.

The remnant of a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master’s death would be a Universe Paradise, while the remnant of an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master’s death would be a Universe Cave Heaven!

Blood Monster Cave Heaven was a Universe Cave Heaven!

Yun Xing Hua continued, “Since Ancient Times, how many High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters have been born in the 3,000 Worlds? After the death of those High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters, the Small Universes in their bodies will sometimes be left behind. Although most High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters will return to their native territories before death, there are always exceptions. It could be said that almost every Great Territory of the 3,000 Worlds has Universe Paradises and Universe Cave Heavens. However, the entrances of these places are always closed and ordinary people can’t enter them at all. So, it’s natural to not be able to find them.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Yun Xing Hua added, “Therefore, as long as we can find such an entrance, we can inherit all the legacies of that fallen High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master!” All High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters had extremely abundant heritages. One could infer by the example of the situation in Blood Monster Cave Heaven.

To the side, Chen Tian Fei frowned, “I’m afraid it will not be that easy.”

Yun Xing Hua cupped his fist as he replied, “If we don’t even try, we will never know. There may be some opportunities! This subordinate should bear the burden of this search for Sir, but regarding this matter, it would be better to have someone with higher cultivation handle it…”

Pang Duo immediately got up and offered himself, “I’ll go!”

Yun Xing Hua quickly proclaimed, “Elder Pang is a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so it would be appropriate for him to carry out this task. Moreover, even if we can’t find a Universe Cave Heaven or Universe Paradise, it would still be worth it if we found some undiscovered Universe World or Spirit Province.”

Yang Kai pondered for a while and announced, “Let’s discuss this again next time.”

Although the legacies of High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters were truly attractive and it would be of great help to Void Land if such a legacy could be found, there was no trace of such things appearing in Void Territory for so many years. If they looked for it now, they might not be able to find anything. The Open Heaven Realm Masters in Void Land needed time to consolidate their cultivations, so there was no time to waste for the time being.

It would not ne too late to look for such buried treasure when Void Land had completely stabilized in the future.

Yue He proposed, “It seems that we can only expand the scale of the Star City for now. If the scale of the Star City expands, we could increase our income.”

Yang Kai smiled lightly, “I think so too.”

But Yue He was still a little worried, “But Young Master, given that Void Land has just encountered a great battle, and with the rumours surrounding the Star City from before, the fame and reputation that was gained has almost all been used up. Although we don’t know what the situation in the Star City is now, it certainly will not be good.”

Before, Void Land attracted a large number of great forces by marketing complete sets of Fifth-Order materials, which brought the Star City its short-lived prosperity. However, with the invasion of the Hundred Sect Alliance, and with Yun Xing Hua and the others, who were guarding the Star City, captured alive, it must be in a mess now.

The news of this battle would definitely spread too. Of course, it would make Void Land famous, but it would not sweep away the many negative effects either. If someone was afraid of Heavenly Sword Union or the other Sects in the Hundred Sect Alliance, they may not have the courage to trade in Void Star City again.

Furthermore, there were some Cave Heavens and Paradises backing Heavenly Sword Union. No one dared to offend the Cave Heavens and Paradises by visiting Void Star City. If no one came, the Star City would naturally be deserted; therefore, being able to maintain the Star City was already good enough, while expanding it seemed hopeless.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, “Since fame can be depleted, it can naturally be regained too. As long as Void Land offers up something attractive enough, why would we worry about customers not coming?”

Yue He looked at Yang Kai thoughtfully, “What Young Master means is…”

Yang Kai answered, “If we sell Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills, I believe the Star City will soon become famous!”

The Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill could greatly improve the chance of a cultivator successfully breaking through to the Open Heaven Realm. Such a good thing would be coveted by everyone, leading to a huge demand for it. Even the Cave Heavens and Paradises would want these pills too. It could be imagined that once this news was spread, perhaps the entire 3,000 Worlds would go crazy about it. By then, countless people would flock to Void Star City.

...

“But Young Master, if we do this, all of Void Land’s Open Heaven Realm Masters would be needed to guard the Star City,” Yue He frowned.

The Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill was an enviable treasure. Without enough power to keep watch over the Star City, it would be difficult to guarantee that it would not lead to riots. Thus, even if all the Void Land Open Heaven Realm Masters were dispatched, they may not be able to prevent such riots from occurring either. This was tantamount to playing with fire.
