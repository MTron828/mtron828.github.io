A dishevelled Yang Kai slowly lifted his head up at that moment, his eyes flashing with an almost imperceptible gleam as he rapidly formed a set of hand seals. The Mountains and Rivers Bell suddenly started spinning before it grew bigger than the size of a house, a powerful suppressive force suddenly bursting from it as it fell towards Shi Huo, who was approaching Yang Kai step by step.

“Be careful!” Cang Guo’s face changed drastically as he warned Shi Huo.

Shi Huo was also taken aback. Apparently, he hadn’t expected Yang Kai’s physique to be so strong that he hadn’t suffered any major injuries from his indirect blow just now. If it was any other First-Order Emperor Realm Master, he might have already lost his life.

The power to suppress the World itself caused Shi Huo to stagnate. Seeing the Mountains and Rivers Bell falling down on him, he hurriedly tried to escape, but it was already a little late.

*Hong…*

In front of everyone’s eyes, the enormous Mountains and Rivers Bell directly suppressed Shi Huo, perfectly encasing him.

“Hahaha!” Yang Kai broke into wild laughter, wiping the blood off the corner of his mouth and cheerfully shouting, “You might be stronger, but this Young Master is smarter!”

Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Guo’s faces turned ashen.

The Ancient Lands’ four Divine Venerables might not like each other, and even had some grudges between them, but generally speaking, their rise and fall were linked to one another; if one suffered, all suffered; if one prospered, all prospered. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After Shi Huo was suppressed by Yang Kai under the Mountains and Rivers Bell, the faces of the other three turned extremely unsightly. Shi Huo had also smeared mud on the faces of Divine Venerables. Although Yang Kai had relied on the Ancient Exotic Artifact to do this, he was still just a Human First-Order Emperor. In the eyes of the Divine Venerables, he was no different than an ant.

But now, Shi Huo has been suppressed by an ant. It was tantamount to a slap on their faces.

*Hong Hong Hong…*

Suddenly, deafening knells and furious roars came from inside the Mountains and Rivers Bell. Obviously, the enraged Shi Huo was bombarding the Mountains and Rivers Bell, trying to escape out of it.

But the World Suppression of the Ancient Exotic Artifact was beyond comparison. Even the Phoenix True Fire had been suppressed under this bell for tens of thousands of years, so despite being a Divine Spirit, Shi Huo was unable to do anything no matter how much he wanted. On the contrary, under his crazy attacks, the Monster Kings in the vicinity had their vitality sent into turmoil by the reverberating shockwaves. All of them had an uncomfortable look on their faces while Hu Li, the weakest of all, and the injured burly Great King even spurted mouthfuls of blood; their faces going completely pale.

Shi Huo, who was suppressed under the Mountains and Rivers Bell, was probably not feeling any better. The bell rings contained terrifying power and he was inside the Mountains and Rivers Bell, so he no doubt suffered the most.

“Shi Huo, stop!” Fan Wu coldly shouted.

Shi Huo probably also noticed that something was wrong and really stopped his crazy bombardment after hearing this, leaving only loud gasps coming from inside the Mountains and Rivers Bell. He was like a trapped beast, his breathing mixed with the sound of unmatched anger and murderous intent.

After having been suppressed by Yang Kai, his lungs were burning with flames of fury. He was like a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.

“Little brat, your courage is quite big!” Fan Wu indifferently added, coldly glaring at Yang Kai, “Let Shi Huo out, or else you will definitely die!”

Yang Kai meaningfully grinned. His figure slightly staggering as he got to his feet and replied with a completely indifferent look on his face, “Sir, if you want to do it, you are more than welcome. This Young Master knows that he can’t escape before you. Since he can’t escape, he won’t even try.”

“Aren’t you afraid of dying?” Fan Wu coldly snorted.

Yang Kai coldly looked at him and indifferently stated, “It’s very easy for Sirs and Madam to kill me, but if you kill me… I’m afraid Shi Huo will be suppressed for many years to come. Maybe someday, someone will be able to subdue the Mountains and Rivers Bell, setting Shi Huo free, but definitely not any time soon.”

Just as he said this, the faces of the Divine Venerables completely sank.

Everyone knew that Yang Kai was right. When the Mountains and Rivers Bell was still in the Ancient Wild Lands tens of thousands of years ago, many had tried many times to subdue it, but none of them had succeeded. Finally, it was taken away by someone called Yuan Ding.

That was simply a disgrace!

Today, if they really killed Yang Kai, perhaps everything would happen just like he said; Shi Huo would remain suppressed under the Mountains and Rivers Bell until someone conquered this Ancient Exotic Artifact someday and released him.

Luan Feng narrowed her beautiful eyes and asked, “Kid, you are young, why do you put the word death so easily on your lips. Let Shi Huo go and we can discuss terms.”

Yang Kai sneered, “When I was leaving before, it was Sirs and Madam who insisted on keeping me here. Now, you want to talk everything out? This Young Master feels quite insecure.”

When Fan Wu and Luan Feng heard this, their expressions turned a bit unsightly. They felt as if they had lifted a rock only to drop it on their feet.

Taking a deep breath, Luan Feng asked, “Then how will you feel secure?”

Yang Kai raised his brow and looked left and right before replying, “Let me take the Stone Spirit Clan away from here first. When I’ve reached a few thousand kilometres from here, I will take back the Mountains and Rivers Bell and let Shi Huo out. In that case, maybe I will feel a little safe.”

As long as he could put a few thousand kilometres between him and the Divine Spirits, Yang Kai was confident he could escape together with the Stone Spirit Clan. At that time, no one would be able to stop him.

Fan Wu rebuked, “Don’t you think you are going overboard with your request? If it’s just you leaving, this King can turn a blind eye, why would you want to drag the Stone Spirit Clan too?”

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “Sir, there are thirty-two Monster Kings and eight Great Kings under you. Adding the Stone Spirit Clan is like adding flowers to a bouquet, and a forcefully picked melon isn’t sweet. Why do Sirs and Madam insist on this? Rather than forcing the Stone Spirit Clan to be loyal to you, isn’t it better to let them be free? I think the Elder will be grateful for this. If Sirs and Madam encounter any trouble in the future, they might even help you out.”

Fan Wu contemptuously smiled and stated, “What trouble would this King even run into?”

Yang Kai earnestly replied, “Life is full of ups and downs, who can guarantee anything?”

“Are you sure you want to do this?” Fan Wu indifferently asked as the smile receded from his lips.

Yang Kai didn’t reply, but a firm look appeared on his face.

Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Guo looked at each other as their Divine Senses surged; they seemed to be communicating with each other.

Yang Kai remained calm, at least on the surface, but his heart was crazily pounding like a drum inside.

He was now using the Mountains and Rivers Bell to suppress Shi Huo. Although he had found himself a slim chance of survival, who knows whether these three Divine Venerables would care for Shi Huo’s life or not. Perhaps if they wanted Shi Huo to be suppressed here forever, they would even take the initiative to kill him. At that time, all Yang Kai would be able to do is make a last stand.

The hope was slim, but it was better than surrendering without a fight.

Just when Yang Kai was internally panicking, Fan Wu gazed at him again, as if he had reached some consensus with Luan Feng and Cang Guo.

Yang Kai’s nerves immediately became taut as he gazed back.

“This King…” Fan Wu indifferently agreed, “Agrees to your conditions.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately heaved a sigh of relief. He couldn’t help but rejoice after having escaped this disaster. In any case, Fan Wu was a Divine Venerable, so since he had said it, he would definitely not regret it.

“However…” Fan Wu switched the topic, making the relieved Yang Kai nervous again, “This King also has a condition.”

Yang Kai’s face turned ugly as he hesitatingly asked, “What’s the condition?”

“This bell…” Fan Wu pointed at the Mountains and Rivers Bell and stated in a firm voice, “Needs to stay here.”

The Mountains and Rivers Bell was too dangerous. The Divine Venerables were unable to conquer it, and once it fell into the hands of the outsiders, it was also a threat to them. Yang Kai with just a First-Order Emperor Realm cultivation was able to suppress Shi Huo.

If it was a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, it wouldn’t be impossible for all four of them to be suppressed under the Mountains and Rivers Bell. So, no matter what, the Mountains and Rivers Bell must remain here. If they couldn’t subdue it, they didn’t want others to have it either.

Yang Kai’s eyes widened as he stated, gritting his teeth, “Sir, isn’t this request too domineering?”

Fan Wu coldly snorted and stated, “You lot have committed a capital offence by trespassing the Blood Gate Restricted Area. This King has left you way out where you keep your lives and your freedom. You should be grateful for that and not try to bargain again.”

Luan Feng also added, “At the end of the day, an artifact is an external thing that’s not connected to your body. Kid, don’t you think leaving it in exchange for a dozen lives is worthwhile?”

Cang Guo also slightly smiled and stepped in too, “Not to mention, this bell belongs to the Ancient Lands. Now, it’s simply returning to its original owner.”

“That is the truth!” Fan Wu agreed with a slight nod.

Yang Kai almost crushed his teeth while grinding them in anger. No one knew the power of Mountains and Rivers Bell better than him; after all, he had spent more than a year in the Shattered Star Sea to subdue this Ancient Exotic Artifact. If he were to hand it over just like that, it would be equivalent to wasting that year’s worth of time and also losing an important trump card. It was a very big loss.

But Luan Feng was also right. Ultimately, artifacts were external aides and not part of his body. Compared with his own life and the Stone Spirit Clan’s future, it was really nothing.

The most important thing was… he couldn’t twist his arms and thighs now. If he didn’t agree, Shi Huo would be unable to get out of his trap, but it would be disastrous for him too, and the Stone Spirit Clan’s future would also be fraught with worries.

“Alright,” Yang Kai muttered, his voice filled with reluctance, “I can leave the Mountains and Rivers Bell here, and allow you to manage it. But sooner or later, this Young Master will personally come and retrieve it.”

Cang Guo sneered and disdainfully rebuked, “Shamelessly boasting!”

He didn’t deny that Yang Kai’s aptitude was pretty good and he had a great chance of becoming a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master in the future, but if they could get the Mountains and Rivers Bell in their hands, then in order to face them all, Yang Kai would first have to become a Great Emperor.

Fan Wu also shook his head with a smile, obviously not taking Yang Kai’s words to his heart, “Since you have agreed, remove your Soul Imprint from this bell. Don’t try to play any tricks, this King will personally monitor you and if he finds something wrong, don’t blame this King for being merciless.

“Sir, you must be joking!” Yang Kai immediately shouted, “If I release my Soul Brand now, wouldn’t Shi Huo try to take my life after he comes out?”

Luan Feng couldn’t help but smile as she assured, “You are quite careful, but don’t worry, with us here, Shi Huo won’t treat you like that.”

Yang Kai shook his head and stated, “I won’t believe it unless you make him swear.”

Fang Wu and the others’ faces immediately blackened, secretly feeling like Yang Kai wasn’t playing by the rules. With their identity and status, they would keep their words, but to their surprise, this brat was declining with all sorts of excuses, which was infuriating them.

Immediately, Shi Huo’s furious shout came from inside the Mountains and Rivers Bell, “Bold! Little brat, what right do you have to make this King swear!”

Yang Kai stated with a straight face, “If you don’t have any ill intention, what’s the harm in swearing? Is it that Sir Shi Huo will really try to take my life once you come out? If that’s the case, then Sir, be prepared to be suppressed inside forever. Suppressing you for a lifetime in exchange for this Junior’s life is a small price to pay.”
