“We’ll know whether it has any use once we try it!” Yang Kai took a deep breath, circulating his Emperor Qi, and poured it into the Dragon Island Token.

Li Jiao widened his eyes and watched carefully, for fear of missing something.

The Dragon Island Token had been in Yang Kai’s possession for many years. When he first got this token, he had experimented with it to see what use it had; however, it had not shown any reaction whatsoever when he poured his Qi into it back then.

This time was no different from the rest. His Emperor Qi was accepted by the Dragon Island Token. Unfortunately, this simple token showed no response whatsoever.

Yang Kai and Li Jiao’s expectant gazes gradually became looks of disappointment.

“W-W-What?! How can it be useless?” Li Jiao felt slightly guilty. What he said just now had been based on mere guesswork, but there was some basis to it. Who could have known that the experiment would produce no results at all? He couldn’t help feeling rather embarrassed, as if he had offered up a bad idea.

On the other hand, Yang Kai sighed softly. Just as he was about to stop pouring his Emperor Qi into the Dragon Island Token, a sudden change occurred. The Dragon carving on the Dragon Island Token blinked all of a sudden.

He looked up and stared at Li Jiao. Similarly, Li Jiao was staring at him with wide eyes too. Their gazes met, and Yang Kai exclaimed, “Did you see that?!”

Li Jiao confirmed, “You saw it too?!”

The two of them were shocked. Once again turning their attention to the Dragon Island Token, they finally saw it clearly. That Dragon carving was indeed blinking. Not only was it blinking, but it also seemed to have been given a breath of life. It looked like it was going to jump out of the token.

The lifelike Dragon carving stretched its body as if it truly had a life of its own, swimming about inside the palm-sized token. Needless to say, it could not escape the constraints of the Dragon Island Token regardless of how hard it swam. Even so, its actions gave one the feeling that it was swimming freely.

Yang Kai observed it carefully and seemed to realize something. Placing the Dragon Island Token flat on his palm, he slowly rotated the token around in all directions. The direction the Dragon carving pointed in did not change. No matter how he rotated the Dragon Island Token, the Dragon carving always faced a certain direction. The Dragon’s Claws danced as if it were travelling through the skies.

“Dragon Island lies in the direction the Dragon’s head is facing!” Li Jiao shouted.

“Let’s go!” Yang Kai was overjoyed and hastily flew in the direction the Dragon’s Head was facing. Likewise, Li Jia seemed very fired up and quickly followed after Yang Kai.

They sped forward without paying any attention to their surroundings. Yang Kai only needed to follow in the direction indicated by the Dragon’s Head. They did not know how many tens of thousands of kilometres they flew when all of a sudden the Dragon carving spun around. The original position where the Dragon’s Head had been was replaced by the Dragon’s Tail while the position of the Dragon’s Tail was replaced by the Dragon’s Head.

Yang Kai slid to a stop and a moment later, Li Jiao abruptly stopped next to him and asked, “What’s wrong?”

Yang Kai did not answer. Instead, he slowly backtracked, and after taking several dozen steps, a change came over the Dragon carving again. The Dragon carving folded down into a right angle and the Dragon’s Head disappeared, leaving only the Dragon’s Tail pointed at Yang Kai.

“What does this mean?” Li Jiao was paying close attention to the changes of the Dragon Island Token and couldn’t help being puzzled.

Yang Kai frowned and studied the Dragon Island Token carefully for a moment. Then, he stretched out a finger and pointed at the sea, “That’s where Dragon Island is!”

“What?!” Li Jiao was shocked, “That’s where Dragon Island is?! Are you sure you aren’t making a mistake?”

Yang Kai replied, “If this token really does have a guiding function, then I’m not mistaken.”

The Dragon Island Token had been placed flat against his palm all this while. At this moment, the Dragon carving was obviously perpendicular to the sea surface and the Dragon’s Head was pointing toward the depths of the water.

“How can this be?! How can Dragon Island be beneath the sea?!” Li Jiao had trouble accepting such a truth. [Dragon Island! It’s called Dragon Island! Since it’s an island, shouldn’t it be on the surface of the sea?! In any case, it shouldn’t be under the sea!] Even so, the Dragon Island Token was guiding them in that direction so it left him with no other explanation.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai shook his head, “If that’s the case, it’s not surprising why Dragon Island has managed to remain concealed for so long.”

Everybody assumed that Dragon Island was located above the sea, who could have thought that Dragon Island was actually located under the sea?! This dramatically increased the secrecy of Dragon Island!

“Let’s go and investigate!” After saying so, Yang Kai plunged downwards.

With a loud splash, seawater splashed in all directions and he vanished from sight. He activated his Emperor Qi and formed a defensive barrier around his body, pushing the seawater around his body away.

At first, the light from above was sufficient; however, as Yang Kai dove deeper and deeper, the light from the surface became dimmer and dimmer. At the same time, more massive Sea Beasts passed him by. Those black shadows flitting by gave him a strong sense of oppression and anxiety.

Sea Beasts were usually large, and their strength normally corresponded to their size. Fortunately, Yang Kai and Li Jiao were not weak. By releasing their Emperor Pressure, the nearby Sea Beasts did not dare to approach them at all and their journey was unobstructed.

They did not know how long had passed. The depths of the sea were pitch-black and they couldn’t even see their fingers in front of them. Simultaneously, the surrounding pressure became quite terrifying. With such heavy pressure crushing down on them, even a Dao Source Realm Master would have been crushed to death. Only an Emperor Realm Master could manage to continue diving.

Their Emperor Qi flowed outward as rapidly as floodwaters and cold sweat was pouring from Li Jiao’s forehead, but he could sense with his Divine Sense that Yang Kai had not stopped. Thus, he could only grit his teeth and keep up with him.

All of a sudden, a powerful aura swiftly rushed towards them from the front. It was a Sea Beast hurtling towards them without any hesitation. Although both their Emperor Pressures could scare away most Sea Beasts, some domineering existences were utterly fearless.

When the black shadow passed by, the two of them were swallowed into its abdomen before they could even react. A fishy smell immediately enveloped them.

Yang Kai’s expression turned grim and raising his hand, countless Moon Blades flew out. Thudding sounds echoed as Yang Kai followed the Moon Blades and slipped out of the Sea Beast’s abdomen.

When Yang Kai looked back, he saw the huge black shadow writhing constantly. The pitch-black waters surrounding it seemed to be dyed red. Meanwhile, Li Jiao also escaped from that Sea Beast’s stomach through the wounds Yang Kai had inflicted on it. Sea Beasts generally had strong vitality and would not die even if they suffered this level of injury. Even so, it immediately understood that it had provoked an enemy that should not be provoked, and consequently, it swiftly fled.

“Keep up!” Yang Kai sent Li Jiao a Divine Sense message to which the latter nodded and sped up.

Another quarter of an hour passed but the pair still couldn’t see the bottom of the sea. Without warning, Yang Kai abruptly stopped in his tracks for some reason. At this point, they no longer knew how deep they had gone. There was no light nor sound from their surroundings, making it extremely quiet. It felt like the world had not been born yet and this was an endless space of chaos.

“What’s wrong?” Li Jiao asked, puzzled, standing beside Yang Kai. The defensive barrier he built with his Emperor Qi deforming slightly under the pressure of the seawater.

Yang Kai replied, “We’re in the right place.”

Li Jiao was overjoyed to hear those words, “That’s great! It’s great that we got the right place, but… Is Dragon Island really beneath the sea?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “It’s not beneath the sea.”

Li Jiao was a little confused, “What do you mean?” [We’ve come so far down into the sea… He even said that we’ve come to the right place. Where else can Dragon Island be if not here?]

“The entrance to Dragon Island is right in front of us!” Yang Kai raised his finger and pointed to the front.

Li Jiao hurriedly spread his Divine Sense out to investigate what was ahead of them, but his Divine Sense did not find anything related to what Yang Kai had mentioned.

“It’s a Void Corridor!” Yang Kai breathed out softly, “There’s a Void Corridor here. It’s just that it’s very well-hidden. Look closer.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Upon hearing those words, Li Jiao finally noticed that something was wrong with this place. There certainly were traces of a Void Corridor nearby. Although he did not cultivate Space Force, he was still a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master. He had some experience and eye for these kinds of things and immediately exclaimed in shock, “Dragon Island is hidden behind a Void Corridor?!”

“Indeed!” Yang Kai nodded gently. With this, everything made sense. He had not been able to understand it before. He did not know why the Dragon Island Token would point into the depths of the sea. It wasn’t until he found the entrance to the Void Corridor that he had a sudden realization.

Putting aside the exact location of Dragon Island, this was obviously the entrance. Thus, it meant that whichever direction the Dragon Island Token pointed in was the location of the entrance.

*Gudong…*

Li Jiao swallowed audibly, “Will we enter Dragon Island once we pass through this?”

What he had been pursuing and dreaming about his entire life was now right in front of him so he couldn’t help becoming nervous. He had dreamt and imagined what Dragon Island was like, what he would feel upon setting foot on Dragon Island. He had imagined the scene so many times that he lost count. Therefore, he felt a little lost now that the goal was within his reach.

“Brother Li, you should leave now if you want to go back. I can handle the rest alone.” Yang Kai sent a transmission to Li Jiao.

When Li Jiao heard those words, the impulse to leave this place and return to the Northern Territory surged up in his heart; however, that impulse disappeared just as quickly as it came.

“I’m going with you!” He said decisively.

“Good, are you prepared?” Yang Kai turned his head to look at Li Jiao with a smile.

Li Jiao’s expression was solemn. Taking a few deep breaths, he calmed the tumultuous emotions in his heart and nodded firmly, “Yes!”

“Let’s go!” Yang Kai shouted and enveloped Li Jiao with his Space Principles before plunging into the Void Corridor.

The surrounding space changed suddenly. At the same time, a tearing force came at them from all directions. The barriers of space were broken and the two of them seemed to enter a whole new world in the next moment.

Just then, a thunderous Dragon Roar sounded from the Void ahead. Immediately following that, several huge Dragon Phantoms aggressively rushed towards them from the front, brimming with murderous intent.

When the Dragon Roar rang out, Li Jiao nearly jumped in fright. All the hair on his body stood on end as the feeling of death wrapped around him.

Yang Kai’s expression changed drastically too. He could feel the horrifying murderous intent coming from those Dragon Phantoms and without even thinking about it, he shouted, “Dragon Transformation!”

Another Dragon Roar sounded and a Golden Dragon Phantom flashed behind him before rushing into his body and disappearing. With the Dragon Clan’s blood in him awakened, a crackling explosion rang out and Yang Kai’s body grew to a massive forty-five metres in height. Stubby Dragon Horns appeared on his forehead and his hands turned into Dragon Claws while his body was covered in Dragon Scales.

Just as Yang Kai assumed his Half-Dragon Form, the Dragon Phantoms from before slammed into him. A mighty wave of power struck him from the front, forcing him to stagger backwards by more than three hundred metres. A sweetness rose in his throat and he nearly coughed out a mouthful of blood.

Meanwhile, those Dragon Phantoms immediately turned their heads back after that attack and haughtily looked down at Yang Kai and Li Jiao from above.

Yang Kai was covered in cold sweat. If he had reacted the slightest bit slower just now, he would have either died or been seriously injured. Fortunately, his Dragon Transformation protected him, otherwise, things would be very bad by now.

Yang Kai stared at those Dragon Phantoms, frowning slightly. That was because he noticed that the Dragon Phantoms did not have physical bodies nor were they like Soul Avatars. Rather, they seemed more like a kind of Secret Technique, a Dragon Clan Secret Technique!
