Seeing Yang Kai’s bewildered look, Yue He went straight to the point with a smile, “All the Ore Stars in Black Territory have been mined out, and all the materials belong to us.”

Yang Kai was stunned by what he said and then responded, “In order to crack the Super Array?”

Yue He nodded, “Exactly.”

Yang Kai asked curiously, “And, all the Cave Heavens and Paradises were fine with that?”

The number of Ore Stars in Black Territory was quite large, and each one was rich in materials. Even the Cave Heavens and Paradises would be envious of such wealth. Unexpectedly, when these Ore Stars were being destroyed, all the materials ended up in Void Land and High Heaven Palace’s pockets.

Although only a few words were exchanged, Yang Kai could already imagine what had happened during the past 100 years he was trapped in the cage.

The Cave Heavens and Paradises must have deployed a large number of people to mine out all the Ore Stars in Black Territory, which broke the Super Array. Thus, those from the Cave Heavens and Paradises were able to avoid being restricted by the power of the Super Array when they fought the Black Ink Royal Lord.

“It was Big Sister who argued with them, saying that Young Master had risked his life for the sake of the 3,000 Worlds. Black Territory originally belonged to Void Land and High Heaven Palace, so everything mined here naturally belongs to us. With such reasons on our side, even they couldn’t do anything too outrageous.”

“En.” Yang Kai nodded lightly, “That’s good.”

With the huge supply of materials from Black Territory, High Heaven Palace and Void Land’s disciples would have more abundant resources to cultivate with. He had a huge amount of Yin and Yang Element materials in his hands, and he was worried that he might not have enough Five Elements materials in the future. Now, Yang Kai did not have to worry about anything.

This was a fortunate turn of events, which was why everyone in the Grand Hall looked happy.

“Young Master, you can’t be so reckless anymore,” Yue He said, “High Heaven Palace and Void Land have many people counting on you. What will we do if anything untoward happens?”

Everyone in the hall nodded their heads.

High Heaven Palace and Void Land’s rise had just begun and Yang Kai was the one who held them all together. If something happened to him, the Sect would definitely fall apart.

Yang Xue also said sternly, “That’s right, Big Brother, you are not on your own now, think more about your wives who have been living in fear and worry all these years.”

Yang Kai’s smile suddenly appeared forced.

Yang Xue looked at him and suddenly had a bad feeling. She frowned and asked, “Big Brother, are you going to do something dangerous again?”

Although they had not spent much time with each other, and Yang Kai was not with Yang Xue during her formative years, blood was thicker than water and there was a special bond between siblings that enabled her to sense something was off right away.

Yang Kai heaved a long sigh which immediately caused everyone in the Grand Hall to turn solemn. Yu Ru Meng and her Sisters also looked doubtfully at him.

“There is gateway in this world called the No-Return Pass!” Yang Kai suddenly said something that seemed completely unrelated.

“Even the Common Disciples of the Cave Heavens and Paradises do not know of its existence. Those who are qualified to know of it are all elite disciples from the Cave Heavens and Paradises, as well as the Elders. I only recently learned about it as well.”

“Once a person crosses the No-Return Pass, they will never be able to return. Beyond this great pass is a battlefield of never-ending war!”

The crowd was amazed, and Mao Zhe asked, “Battlefield? What kind of battlefield?”

“The Black Ink Battlefield!” Yang Kai replied in a deep voice.

Everyone gasped with their mouths and eyes wide open. Although this was the first time they heard of the ‘Black Ink Battlefield’, just by hearing the name alone, they knew that it was definitely not a pleasant place.

“Yes, as you can imagine, the armies of the Black Ink Clan fill this Black Ink Battlefield, and they have been trying to invade the 3,000 Worlds since ancient times. They want to turn all living beings in this world into their slaves and livestock. The Cave Heavens and Paradises shoulder the responsibility of guarding the 3,000 Worlds and all of their strongest Masters are stationed there to resist the Black Ink Clans.”

The Great Emperors’ faces turned grim, while Mao Zhe, Hui Gu and the others were dumbfounded.

It was understandable that the Great Emperors had not heard of the Black Ink Battlefield, for they had not been out of the Star Boundary for many years. Additionally, they had only advanced to the Open Heaven Realm a few hundred years ago.

However, Mao Zhe, Hui Gu and the others were already veteran Open Heaven Realm Masters. Even so, they had never heard of the existence of the Black Ink Battlefield and No-Return Pass, which was rather unbelievable.

Everyone turned their heads toward Qu Hua Shang and Tao Ling Wan who were held the highest statuses of all those present. They were the Core and Elite Disciples of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, so surely they would understand more of such secrets than the others.

Qu Hua Shang nodded lightly, “Honoured Master took Senior Brother and Senior Sister to cross the No-Return Pass and join the Black Ink Battlefield more than 300 years ago. As far as I know, every few years, every Cave Heaven and Paradise has to send a group of people into the Black Ink Battlefield to replenish the attrition losses of the great war.”

The crowd could not imagine how cruel and fierce the battles were in the Black Ink Battlefield that the Cave Heavens and Paradises had to constantly send reinforcements to hold the line.

“The Cave Heavens and Paradises have intentionally suppressed all information about the Black Ink Clan, so it’s naturally that you haven’t heard about it.” Yang Kai explained lightly.

Mao Zhe and the others were relieved to hear this. If it was not for the Black Territory incident, they really would not have heard of the existence of the Black Ink Clan. If they did not know about the Black Ink Clan, then it would be strange to know about the Black Ink Battlefield and the No-Return Pass.

“But… what does this have to do with us?” Xue Yue asked as her face turned pale.

It did not make sense for Yang Kai to bring this up for no reason, especially after the great battle with the powerful Black Ink Master had just ended. Thus, it was obvious something else was brewing behind the scenes.

“Originally, it didn’t matter much. Throughout the ages, the Masters of the Cave Heavens and Paradises fought against the Black Ink Clan on the Black Ink Battlefield in order to safeguard the peace of the 3,000 Worlds. Although the losses have been enormous, nothing has gone wrong in countless ages. If nothing changed, this pattern would continue on for a long time. However… the battle in Black Territory has changed everything.”

The crowd listened intently.

Yang Kai suddenly asked, “Do you know how many Masters from the Cave Heavens and Paradises lost their lives in this battle?”

All of them shook their heads, only Qu Hua Shang’s expression turned grave as she reported, “In this battle, the Cave Heavens and Paradises deployed more than 1,000 High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters. Even so, 268 in the Seventh-Order and 5 in the Eighth-Order were killed!”

Although officially she had married out of the Sect, she was still a Core Disciple of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven and had some means to find out such information.

When they fought against the Black Ink Royal Lord, Yin-Yang Cave Heaven also deployed a team of Masters led by an Eighth-Order Ancestor. It was from this Ancestor that Qu Hua Shang found out the details. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Hearing this number, the crowd was shocked. They knew that in this battle, many High-Rank Masters from the Cave Heavens and Paradises fell, but they did not expect that so many had died. 268 Seventh-Orders and 5 Eighth-Orders were killed!

Those Eighth-Orders Open Heaven Realm Masters were considered to be among the strongest in the entire 3,000 Worlds!

“The Black Ink Clan is so fierce?” Martial Beast Great Emperor exclaimed in disbelief.

“The Black Ink Master who was trapped in Black Territory was especially extraordinary. A Black Ink Royal Lord at their peak is comparable to a Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master!” Yang Kai explained, “If it weren’t for the years of confinement that caused her strength to plummet, we might not have been able to kill her at all.”

The crowd felt slightly relieved, but were still astonished about the Black Ink Royal Lord being on par with a Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

“After her death though, a Void Corridor appeared where she fell!”

The crowd stared in disbelief.

Zhan Wu Hen frowned and then asked, “Where does that Void Corridor connect to?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “I don’t know for certain, but we can only assume the worst.”

“The Black Ink Battlefield…” Someone murmured softly.

If that was the case, then things might turn serious.

“Indeed!” Yang Kai nodded, “We can only assume that the Void Corridor is connected to Black Ink Battlefield. Right now, the Void Corridor is still sealed by an ancient power but that seal is gradually dissipating and will disappear completely in short order. Once that happens, the Black Ink Clan will discover the Void Corridor and invade the 3,000 Worlds. The consequences will be catastrophic.”

Yang Kai paused to let the crowd digest the news, and then quickly said, “I must enter the Void Corridor to re-seal it. This is the only way to avert the disaster.”

Yu Ru Meng gritted her teeth and asked, “Why must you go? Aren’t there many Masters in the Cave Heavens and Paradises? Why aren’t they doing anything about it? Why does it have to be you? What is the meaning of this!?”

Yang Kai laughed bitterly and said, “They didn’t ask me to go. I was the one who volunteered.”

Yu Ru Meng smashed the armrest of her chair and screamed, “I think you want us Sisters to become widows!”

“Ru Meng…” Yang Xue saw Yu Ru Meng’s furious anger and quickly interjected, “Big Brother is now considered the head of the family. Your outburst is disrespectful, especially when there are so many people here in the Grand Hall. Even if you wish to discuss personal matters with Big Brother, you should do so in private.”

“I’m in the wrong to question this!?” Yu Ru Meng was furious and pointed her finger at Yang Kai, “How many life-and-death risks has your Big Brother taken over the years? Without even mentioning things from the far past, didn’t he recently follow a Giant Spirit God into the Chaotic Dead Territory? Is that a place for ordinary people to go!? If Mao Zhe hadn’t been alive and well all this time, how would we have known he was even alive!? When he ran into that cage to live together with that Black Ink Master for 100, we also had to turn to Mao Zhe just to figure out if he was still breathing!”

Mao Zhe looked helplessly with his eyes lowered as he rubbed his nose.

“It took so much effort and difficulty for him to come back alive from the Chaotic Dead Territory, and then survive the confinement with that Black Ink Royal Lord. Now you want to enter that damned Void Corridor to seal it? Do you have a death wish!?”

Yang Kai replied feebly, “Ru Meng, please don’t be angry, sealing the Void Corridor is not necessarily risky.”
