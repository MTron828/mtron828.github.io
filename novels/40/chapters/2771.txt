200 million High-Rank Source Crystals was a gargantuan amount that not just anyone could possess. This amount was comparable to the total income of Azure Sun Temple for a number of years.

Even Xiao Yu Yang and Xue Zheng Mao’s expressions lit up upon hearing that amount.

On the contrary, Yang Kai continued to wear a calm expression on his face, as though he had not heard 200 million, but 2 million, or 200 thousand…

The few people present could not help silently nodding their heads in appreciation. In the end, Yang Kai had just broken through to the Emperor Realm, so no matter how many assets he possessed, he couldn’t be overly wealthy in their opinion. Yet, how was it possible for him to remain that unmoved in the face of such enormous wealth?

How could they know that Yang Kai was now in possession of such astonishing wealth that 200 million High-Rank Source Crystals truly did not amount to much for him.

“What about the second compensation?” Yang Kai asked in a calm tone.

The strange glint in Lan Xun’s eyes faded as she replied, “The second compensation… is that you can ask my father three questions. Anything, regardless of what type of question, is allowed.”

Right as those words rang out, Xue Zheng Mao and Xiao Yu Yang’s breathing both turned rapid as a fervent shade blossomed on their faces.

Despite being Elders of Star Soul Palace and possessing great authority that was second only to the Great Emperor, it was still not an easy matter for them to meet the Great Emperor. The Great Emperor was often in retreat, just like a hidden dragon who showed its tail but never its face. Basically, dozens of years might go by before there might be a possibility to meet the Great Emperor, much less being able to personally ask the Great Emperor some questions.

The two of them would definitely be ecstatic if they were able to obtain the opportunity that was now presented to Yang Kai. That was because any cultivator would definitely have many unanswered questions on their Martial Dao. Questions that Masters like them could ask could only be answered by the Great Emperors, so any advice or answer might allow their strength to soar.

Although the second compensation was not as direct as 200 million Source Crystals, it could be said that it was worth much more than the first. Source Crystals could be obtained through time, but an opportunity as good as being able to ask a Great Emperor three questions could only be gifted, not sought.

Even Wen Zi Shan wasn’t able to control his emotions as he turned his head to look at Yang Kai, really hoping the latter would accept this offer right away.

Who would have known that Yang Kai’s expression would still remain calm? After a moment of silence, he continued, “What is the third?”

Lan Xun replied, “The third form of compensation we can offer is allowing you to enter Star Soul Palace’s Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda and cultivate in there for one month.”

Yang Kai nodded his head at these three choices before him. Truthfully speaking, Star Soul Palace had shown much sincerity through this gesture, as any one of those compensations was sufficient for Yang Kai to return the Golden Armor Heavenly Book to them.

“Do I really have to return this Emperor Artifact?” Raising his head, Yang Kai held on to the Golden Armor Heavenly Book as he asked Lan Xun.

An apologetic look appeared on Lan Xun’s face, “Senior Brother Yang, I hope that you can empathize with the several dozen disciples of our Star Soul Palace that are trapped within that Sealed World.”

Without the Golden Armor Heavenly Book, there was no way to open the Grand Illusion Realm, meaning that those several dozen disciples would be forever trapped within.

Yang Kai sighed, before replying, “Then I’ll choose the third option.”

Elation appeared on Lan Xun’s face, though she proceeded to gawk and say, “Why don’t you take a while longer to consider?”

Wen Zi Shan chimed in to advise him too, “That’s right, Yang Kai. There’s no harm in thinking over your decision in detail. Since the Great Emperor has offered you three forms of compensation, he definitely would not force you to make your choice immediately. There is time for you to consider before making your decision.”

Yang Kai shook his head and replied, “There’s no need. I choose the third option.”

Wen Zi Shan’s jaw hung loosely, as though he was unable to say anything in the end.

He thought, if he was in Yang Kai’s position, he would have definitely chosen the second option. Although a trip into the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda was an extraordinary opportunity, one had to rely on luck to be able to gain within it. If one wasn’t lucky, they wouldn’t be able to harvest anything even if they cultivated for ten years, much less one month. This made it very lacking when compared to being able to ask three questions to the Great Emperor. He also didn’t know what plan Yang Kai had. The only counterargument to his thoughts was that Yang Kai was the final and only decision-maker in this matter. Since the latter had made his choice, it naturally left him in a spot where it was better to not say anything.

Lan Xun was also very surprised by Yang Kai’s choice, as she had obviously assumed that there was over a ninety percent chance of him choosing the second offer. Yet, the development of this matter was moving out of her expectations. Nevertheless, she finally nodded her head and replied, “Then our Star Soul Palace will look forward to your arrival, Senior Brother Yang.”

Yang Kai nodded his head, and with a flick of his Divine Sense, wiped away the Soul Imprint he had engraved within the Golden Armor Heavenly Book in his hand. He then handed the Emperor Artifact to Lan Xun, who proceeded to store it into her Space Ring.

With this matter settled, Wen Zi Shan warmly invited Lan Xun and the others to stay in Azure Sun Temple for a few more days. Nevertheless, both Xiao Yu Yang and Xue Zheng Mao were utterly not in the mood, as they subsequently bade their farewells.

Having completed her mission, Lan Xun wanted to leave as well.

Before she left though, Yang Kai suddenly called out, “Junior Sister Lan, would you mind staying back for a bit? I still have a small personal matter to ask you.”

Lan Xun turned around and let Xiao Yu Yang and Xue Zheng Mao wait outside for her. The two naturally didn’t have any qualms about it while on the contrary, Xiao Chen was adamant on staying behind, a look of hostility covering his face as he did not feel assured leaving Yang Kai alone with Lan Xun.

“Senior Brother Xiao, you can go out first,” Lan Xun shot a commanding look at Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen opened his mouth, but was unable to say anything when he noticed Lan Xun’s beautiful eyes staring at him firmly. Immediately, his mood deflated while the words he was about to say became stuck in his throat. In the end, he shot an angry glare at Yang Kai before turning around to leave.

After a short while, Lan Xun and Yang Kai were the only ones left within the large palace hall.

Lan Xun smiled lightly and said, “There’s no one here now. What does Senior Brother Yang want to ask?”

Yang Kai replied, “Junior Sister Lan mentioned earlier that you visited Spirit Beast Island not long ago, yes?”

Lan Xun nodded her head, “That’s right. I visited there approximately three months ago when my father brought me to the Eastern Territory after being invited by Senior Martial Beast.”

“Then, did Junior Sister Lan meet Senior Jiu Feng on Spirit Beast Island?” Yang Kai’s expression changed.

“Aunt Jiu Feng?” Lan Xun was surprised by Yang Kai’s question, as she had assumed he had requested a private conversation to ask about Mo Xiao Qi. Who would have known that he wanted to ask about Jiu Feng. According to what she knew, there seemed to be no lines of communication between Yang Kai and Jiu Feng. Shaking her head, she replied, “I did not see her.”

After a short pause, she continued to speak, “However, I’ve heard from Little Sister Xiao Qi that Aunt Jiu Feng has been in a retreat recently, and was not to be disturbed unless absolutely necessary.”

Yang Kai frowned, a pensive look appearing on his face.

Jiu Feng being in retreat undoubtedly had something to do Liu Yan. After coming out of the Shattered Star Sea, Liu Yan had fused with the Phoenix True Fire, transforming into a Phoenix Egg before being brought back to Spirit Beast Island by Jiu Feng. As of now, there was still no news of them. At that time, Jiu Feng had mentioned that it would take at least one year at best, and five years at worst before the results could be seen.

Although there was Jiu Feng standing guard for her, Liu Yan was bearing substantial risk as she received the Fire Phoenix Inheritance, leaving Yang Kai feeling unassured and uneasy about her safety.

Originally, he hoped to be able to glean some news for Lan Xun, though he did not expect for her to have no information on this at all.

Seeing him reveal a disappointed look left Lan Xun with a face full of doubts and confusion, as she did not know what Yang Kai’s relationship with Jiu Feng was.

After turning silent for a while, Yang Kai said, “That’s right, I have another matter that I would like to ask Junior Sister Lan for help with.”

Lan Xun smiled faintly, “Of course, Senior Brother Yang.”

Yang Kai said, “Do you know a person by the name of Hua Qing Si, Junior Sister Lan? She is also a disciple of your Star Soul Palace, and her Master was that Tan Jun Hao…”

…

Half an hour had elapsed before Lan Xun walked out of the palace. The nervously waiting Xiao Chen immediately went forward to greet her, all while sizing her up in anxiousness, afraid that she might have suffered a mishap. After noticing that she was fine, as well as noticing the frustrated look on Yang Kai’s face, his mood instantly turned for the better.

“Senior Brother Yang, you can head to our Star Soul Palace whenever you have the time, and this Junior Sister will warmly welcome your arrival!” Lan Xun turned around to say to Yang Kai.

“Take care, Junior Sister Lan,” Yang Kai nodded his head absentmindedly.

Lan Xun signalled to Xiao Yu Yang and Xue Zheng Mao, before the few of them transformed into streaks of lights that proceeded to shoot across the horizon.

The various guests on Myriads Saint Peak quietly observed the situation.

With the Grand Canonization Ceremony complete and Yang Kai receiving Azure Sun Temple’s Jade Elder Token, from this point onwards, he was an official Elder of Azure Sun Temple. The appointment of an Elder should have been an ordinary matter, but Yang Kai’s display of strength before everyone’s eyes, exchanging a move with Xue Zheng Mao, brought him much fame. Although Yang Kai seemed to have suffered quite a serious injury as a result, that did not take away from the fact that he managed to wound the latter. Regardless of his courage or his strength, either one was enough for people to treat Yang Kai with high regard.

Furthermore, Lan Xun’s arrival had caused a strange atmosphere that hung over the guests, even after the members of Star Soul Palace had left.

Therefore, at this moment, quite a few of the gazes sent towards Yang Kai’s way had changed from before. No longer were they using the gaze a Senior would use towards a Junior. On the contrary, it was one of equals.

After a momentary bout of silence, the atmosphere returned back to its original liveliness through the efforts of the various Azure Sun Temple Elders.

Despite the completion of the Grand Canonization Ceremony, having so many Emperor Realms gathered at one place was a very rare occasion to come by. Furthermore, this happened in the territory of Azure Sun Temple, so they did not dare to neglect their guests.

Wen Zi Shan walked Yang Kai around the tables to exchange toasts, introduce himself, and get to know the various Emperors of the Southern Territory, which might prove useful to him in the future.

As he walked along, Yang Kai recognised quite a few familiar faces in the crowd.

Heavenly Martial Holy Land’s Wu Chang, Orthodoxy Temple’s Zhuang Bu Fan, and Eight Paths Sect’s Luo Yuan were people with whom Yang Kai had crossed paths before.

These rising stars that had radiated with extraordinary brilliance while in the Dao Source Realm had all broken through to the Emperor Realm now.

It was not surprising for Wu Chang and Zhuang Bu Fan, as they were already famous rising stars of the Southern Territory. Both of them possessed considerable status in their respective Sects, just like Xia Sheng in Azure Sun Temple, and had access to cultivation resources and opportunities that far exceeded those of ordinary people.

On the contrary, the Sect that Luo Yuan hailed from, Eight Paths Sect, was just a small force. In fact, it was not even able to rival the Blue Feather Sect that Yang Kai had previously joined. Nevertheless, with his outstanding aptitude and perseverance, Luo Yuan had broken through to the Emperor Realm! He had even assumed command of Eight Paths Sect, becoming its Sect Master!

This fellow’s face was brimming with an intent to fight as he stared at Yang Kai, appearing as though he wanted to duel with Yang Kai the first chance possible.

If not for it being Yang Kai’s celebratory day, Luo Yuan might have already issued a challenge.

After three rounds of drinks and five rounds of food, everyone moved about, exchanging cheers, forming groups and cliques, alongside greetings and pleasantries.

The majority of the Emperors present had brought along their disciples and Juniors to this place, which just so happened to be a good place to open their eyes to the world.

“We meet again, Young Master Yang.” A waft of delicate fragrance blew over, as a curvaceous figure squeezed her way to Yang Kai’s side, before letting out a laugh, “Forgive me, it should be Elder Yang now.”

Yang Kai turned his head over to find a beautiful woman standing elegantly with a wine cup in her hand. Her pretty face was of a ruddy pink shade, a presumed result of alcohol. Even her fair neck had a pink hue to it, creating an exceedingly alluring sight to behold.

“Palace Master Hua!” Recognizing this woman immediately, Yang Kai gave a faint smile and raised his cup in recognition.
