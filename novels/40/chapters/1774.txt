Chapter 1774, Divine Nirvana Fruit

In the face of Ni Guang’s sudden attack, Xue Yue stood still and did not move. She believed that Ni Guang would not harm her and that her Uncle Ni must have his own reason for doing this.

*Xiu...*

A strong wind blew past the top of Xue Yue’s head and a strand of black Qi suddenly flew from her hair and hovered for a moment before flying over towards Gui Zu’s location like an arrow from a string.

This strand of black Qi escaped so fast that even Ni Guang could not stop it.

He could not clearly see what this strand of black Qi was, but it resembled a human figure with a distorted face, like a Yin Soul. It had been hidden in Xue Yue’s hair just now, and because both were black and it had completely restrained its aura, even Ni Guang had not been aware of it at first.

By the time he noticed, it was too late.

The strand of black Qi quickly flew over to Gui Zu, and as he let out a burst of wicked laughter, he opened his mouth and swallowed the black Qi into his belly.

“Don’t you feel ashamed of acting like that, Your Excellency?” Ni Guang looked over at Gui Zu and shouted coldly.

“Heh heh heh...” Gui Zu still just grinned strangely, “How this old master acts, there’s no need for others to comment on!”

Ni Guang’s face went gloomy as he glared at Gui Zu for a long time before waving his hand and saying, “This King cannot be bothered with you now, but he will certainly settle this account another day!”

Although he was displeased with the little trick Gui Zu had pulled on Xue Yue, it was obviously not the time to fight. Zi Long, who was not far away, was already watching with interest, seemingly eager to see the only two present who could rival him fight.

Naturally, Ni Guang wasn’t about to do what Zi Long wanted. What’s more, he could tell that Gui Zu hadn’t harmed Xue Yue in the slightest and was only trying to eavesdrop to obtain information.

With no other choice but to set the matter aside for now, Ni Guang snorted coldly and turned back towards the medicine valley.

“Yang Boy, did you hear what they said just now?” On the other side, Gui Zu whispered to Yang Kai.

“I heard,” Yang Kai looked surprised, “Senior, when did you leave that thing on Xue Yue?”

He had been carrying Xue Yue this whole time, yet he didn’t even notice when Gui Zu planted that strand of black Qi.

“When this old master handed over the Shocking Void Beast’s Monster Core to you,” Gui Zu smiled triumphantly, “What’s wrong? Are you dissatisfied with this old master’s conduct?”

“Nothing of the sort...” Yang Kai chuckled. “I just felt that Senior really stands high and sees far.”

Gui Zu laughed, “Don’t try to flatter this old master, it’s just that this old master has always worked alone, so he needs to be vigilant of everything and take advantage of every opportunity! En, now that you’ve heard what they just said, this old master will be counting on you.”

“I’ll do my best!” Yang Kai nodded, not arguing.

Outside the medicine valley, there was silence for a time as all the gathered Origin Kings waiting patiently. Those like Zi Long and Ni Guang knew how they needed to act next, and while those like Kong Fa, Xu Wei, and Meng Tong may not have any idea about this place, they were still Origin Kings who possessed extraordinary observational skills and analysis capabilities. Even if they did not know how to enter the mountain valley safely right now, watching Ni Guang and Zi Long gave them enough clues.

Xu Wei would cast his eyes towards Yang Kai from time to time. He was very curious about how Yang Kai and Xue Yue survived after being surrounded by so many Illusionary Void Butterflies. At that time, he had used them as bait to delay the Illusionary Void Butterflies so he could escape and was certain these two Juniors would die.

He never thought that he would see both of them appear here a few days later, completely unscathed.

Xu Wei could only attribute their survival to Gui Zu who came with them, thinking it was Gui Zu who appeared and rescued them.

Time passed by.

After about an hour, a strange sound suddenly came from a certain location deep in the huge mountain valley ahead. This sound was almost like a great beast inhaling deeply in its sleep.

The sound was dull and rolling, like the mixture of drums and thunder pounding heavily on one’s soul.

Almost all the Origin Kings present wore solemn expressions upon hearing this sound.

On the other hand, Ni Guang, Luo Lan, Zi Long, and a few others wore eager looks as they secretly condensed their Saint Qi in preparation to move.

The next moment, a change suddenly occurred.

The peaceful mountain valley suddenly filled with a strong gust of wind that blew straight towards its deepest depths. At the same time, the inhalation sound became even more obvious.

As this inhalation continued, the Seven Coloured Radiant Light flooding the mountain valley seemed to receive an irresistible attraction and rapidly receded from the mountain valley like a tide. In the blink of an eye, the scenery inside the mountain valley was exposed to everyone.

*Xiu xiu xiu...*

At that moment, three Origin Kings, Ni Guang, Luo Lan, and Zi Long, all moved, shooting out like arrows from the string and chasing after the ebbing Seven Coloured Radiant Light as they charged into the mountain valley!

Seeing this movement, Kong Fa, Xu Wei, and Meng Tong, who had been waiting and watching, no longer restrained themselves, each of them using their movement skills to turn into streaks of light that shot off in different directions.

Gui Zu let out riotous laughter, summoned his Ten Thousand Soul Banner, wrapped it around Yang Kai, and rushed forward.

His cultivation was profound, and among the Origin Kings present, only Ni Guang and Zi Long could match him, so his speed was naturally extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, he crossed ten kilometres.

Inside the mountain valley were innumerable Void Cracks, some tiny, some massive, all scattered about randomly. These cracks were like scars in space that could never be repaired.

Many Void Cracks were also hidden, and while some could be located by Divine Sense, some were completely undetectable.

Both Ni Guang and Zi Long carried artifacts that were able to detect Void Cracks, and at this moment they relied on them to push forward while constantly changing directions to avoid these hidden dangers.

The other Origin Kings, who had not prepared for this in advance, had to release their Divine Senses to the greatest extent possible to avoid as many dangers as they could.

After only ten breaths of effort, everyone had settled into a steady pace, and although they had all rushed into the mountain valley at almost the same time, Ni Guang and Zi Long were undoubtedly much further ahead.

However, Gui Zu’s progress was even more exaggerated.

With Yang Kai showing him the way, he did not even need to worry about the threat of Void Cracks. He only needed to follow Yang Kai’s guidance and was easily able to surpass Ni Guang and Zi Long in a short time, leaving them in his dust as he disappeared into the valley.

“That bastard!” Zi Long looked at Gui Zu’s figure in the distance and could not help cursing.

He had spent so many years waiting for the Severed World to open so he could come here to harvest the rare ancient herbs that had long gone extinct in the greater Star Field. Every time the Severed World opened, many rare herbs were obtained from this medicine valley, and those who were faster naturally obtained more.

He thought that his biggest competitor here would be Ni Guang, but then the unanticipated variable, Gui Zu, had appeared halfway and caught him by surprise.

“Does that fool want to die?” Zi Dong, who was following Zi Long, also looked up ahead with a stunned expression, “Rushing in so quickly, once he touches a hidden Void Crack, even if he’s an Origin King, he’ll surely suffer greatly.”

“Don’t concern yourself with him!” Zi Long coldly snorted, “If he wants to court death, let him.”

“Yes!” Zi Dong thought about it and agreed. Even if one rushed in quickly, that did not guarantee good results and instead might lead to a quick death.

Thinking so, his mood became stable.

On the other side, Ni Guang, who was keeping pace with Zi Long, also shook his head and sighed, “Xue Yue, that boy is probably going to meet disaster. That guy named Gui Zu doesn’t know how dangerous this place is, how could their end be good?”

“I doubt that,” Xue Yue shook her head. She knew what Yang Kai and Gui Zu had to depend on, but she did not bother explaining.

Only Luo Lan sighed softly.

If Yang Kai was with them now, their situation would definitely be much better, but unfortunately, he wasn’t.

“We’re here,” After releasing his Divine Sense, Gui Zu confirmed there was no one around for a dozen kilometres and suddenly slowed, allowing his and Yang Kai’s figures to be revealed.

“Hm? There’s a medicinal fragrance!” Yang Kai suddenly sniffed and said with shock.

“Heh heh, we’ve only just come in and we already have a harvest,” Gui Zu chuckled before his expression suddenly turned solemn. “Yang Boy, this old master will make this clear right now, whatever we find in this medicine valley, we’ll split evenly, this old master won’t take advantage of you. What do you think?”

“We’ll do as Senior proposes,” Yang Kai nodded readily.

In this kind of place, although Gui Zu had to rely heavily on Yang Kai’s expertise in Space Force, that did not mean he couldn’t act without Yang Kai, it’s just his speed would be much slower.

Therefore, Gui Zu’s proposal to split the gains evenly was actually a bit of a loss to him; so of course, Yang Kai wouldn’t object.

“Over there!” Yang Kai confirmed the source of the medicinal fragrance and pointed in a certain direction.

Saying so, he rushed over with Gui Zu following close behind.

Ten breaths later, the two arrived in front of a fruit tree about half a person tall. The branches of this fruit tree were a bit sparse and only a few scattered cone-shaped leaves adorned its branches.

On these branches, there were a total of four purple fist-sized fruits that gave off a light twinkling. Their skin was crystal clear and one could see the sweet flesh on their inside.

An indescribable aura lingered around these four fruits, making them stand out all on their own.

Gui Zu’s whole body was wrapped in black Qi, but the piercing fire in his eyes was still difficult to contain.

He could see just how extraordinary these four fruits were at a glance and that they were of great use to improve his strength!

“Divine Nirvana Fruits!” Yang Kai took a moment of observation to identify these fruits from his vast knowledge, and when he did, he could not help calling out in alarm.

“These are Divine Nirvana Fruits?” Gui Zu raised his brows and asked with pleasant surprise, “The ones that are used to refine the Great Nirvana Pill?”

He had obviously heard about the Divine Nirvana Fruit before and what pill it was used to refine.
