Chapter 1616, Winning Over

As a Star Master, it was only natural to be able to sense what happens on the Cultivation Star of which one refined the Star Source.

However, this would also consume a great deal of power, and no Star Master was idle enough to simply be spying on others at will. If there was enough time for that, they might as well just cultivate instead.

Yang Kai naturally understood this as Xia Ning Chang was also a Star Master, although her situation was a bit special. With her ability, she was still able to perceive the situation everywhere in Tong Xuan Realm.

As a Second-Order Origin King, Luo Hai was several times stronger than Xia Ning Chang and probably had no difficulties perceiving the situation inside the Blood Prison.

Seeing the dark look on Yang Kai’s face, Xu Bin Bai immediately understood what he was worried about and chuckled, “Brother Yang doesn’t need to be too nervous. The chaotic power of Domain which floods the Blood Prison is so powerful that even Senior Luo Hai shouldn’t be able to perceive what happens inside too clearly.”

“Not too clearly?” Yang Ka’s brow rose.

“Yes, it is said that there is a barrier which was erected by the previous Star Master of Green Mountains Star using the power of its Star Source around the Blood Prison. The previous generation Star Master had a Third-Order Origin King cultivation, which is higher than the current Senior Luo Hai, so until Senior Luo Hai reaches a similar height, it should be difficult for him to overcome this barrier entirely,” Xu Bin Bai explained.

Yang Kai nodded slightly, his nervous expression relaxing somewhat.

However, even if what Xu Bin Bai said was true, Yang Kai remained a little uneasy.

The movement at Domain Stone Mountain wasn’t of concern as it was the Stone Puppet who was secretly acting at the time. As such, Yang Kai was confident that even if Luo Hai was paying attention, he would never have noticed what really happened.

However, the events on Monster Mountain were a different story.

Chi Yue and the other Tribal Lords knew about the existence of the Origin Essence Crystal there, so how could Luo Hai, as Green Mountains Star’s Star Master, not know?

Yang Kai had fought a great battle with Mad Crocodile Monster King on Monster Mountain after which he had taken the Origin Essence Crystal away with him...

[Does Luo Hai know about this?] Yang Kai didn’t dare to make arbitrary judgments, but the Origin Essence Crystal was a treasure that Chi Yue coveted greatly.

Chi Yue had the same cultivation as Luo Hai, so what she wanted, he must want as well!

Many thoughts flashed across Yang Kai’s mind before he took a deep breath and restored his calm while shooting a glance towards the golden-crown-wearing Luo Hai.

The other party was also paying attention to him, and when their four eyes suddenly met, Yang Kai clearly saw Luo Hai’s eyes flash.

Yang Kai’s heart sank!

“Oh... Young Man, what’s the relationship between you and Senior Wu Dao?” The beautiful woman who had walked over to Yang Kai first and was about to ask him about himself suddenly noticed Xu Bin Bai standing beside Yang Kai as well as the three-petal flower pattern on his chest and asked in surprise.

“He is my Master!” Xu Bin Bai replied, neither humbly nor arrogantly.

“Senior Wu Dao is your master?” Li Wan Ning couldn’t help covering her mouth as a look of shock filled her face.

“What, this little guy is Senior Wu Dao’s disciple?” The other Origin Kings who were following behind also exclaimed, as if they had found something extraordinary, all of them turning to look at Xu Bin Bai with interest.

Even Luo Hai, who was the strongest amongst this group and who also possessed the highest status, showed a trace of shock. Obviously, he had not expected that someone with such immense background would participate in this Blood Prison Trial.

“Xu Bin Bai greets several Seniors!” Although Xu Bin Bai was a disciple of Wu Dao, he was still a Junior, so he didn’t dare act aloof when facing so many Origin Kings and politely offered his greetings.

“En, Little Brother need not act so polite.”

“That’s right, there are no outsiders here so there’s no need for such formality. This Zhou was fortunate enough to meet Senior Wu Dao five hundred years ago and suddenly became enlightened thanks to Senior’s advice. Only then was I able to break through to the Origin King Realm. Strictly speaking, Senior Wu Dao is this Zhou’s half-master, so you and I are fellow apprentice brothers.” The burly looking man wore a kind smile as he spoke to Xu Bin Bai. Even as an Origin King, he obviously didn’t care about his identity at all and highly praised Wu Dao.

“Senior Zhou must be joking; this Junior does not have the skill or ability to dare call Senior Zhou a brother!” Xu Bin Bai smiled lightly and said humbly.

“Hahaha. Senior Wu Dao seems to have found a promising successor. Little Boy, work hard so as not to lose face for Senior Wu Dao.”

“Junior will take Senior’s teachings to heart!” Xu Bin Bai replied.

“En, when you see Senior Wu Dao again, please extend him this Luo’s greetings,” Luo Hai exhorted him kindly.

“Junior will certainly deliver Senior Luo’s sentiments!” Xu Bin Bai nodded, “Master once said that if nothing unexpected happens, the next master to break through to the Third-Order Origin King will be Senior Luo Hai.”

When the various Origin Kings heard this, all of them turned a look of admiration towards Luo Hai, obviously treating such an evaluation from Wu Dao as extremely high praise.

“Really?” Luo Hai raised his brows, a look of pride appearing on his face as he laughed loudly. “Then this Luo will certainly do his best to live up to Senior Wu Dao’s high expectations!”

“Junior hopes that Senior achieves this accomplishment soon.”

“En, enough gossip though. All of you should do what you came here to do,” Luo Hai smiled and looked at Yang Kai with interest.

“How should we address this little brother?” Li Wan Ning was the first to ask, smiling at Yang Kai as a light floral fragrance wafted from her figure.

The others also stared at him with inquisitive eyes.

“Yang Kai!”

“Yang Kai?” Everyone heard this name and frowned, looking around at each other as they shook their heads slowly, indicating they had never heard this name before.

Generally, the rising stars in the Origin Returning Realm would have some fame associated with their names, but this was the first time they had heard of Yang Kai.

“Why does this old master feel like he’s heard someone mention your name before?” Only Old Jiu showed a thoughtful expression.

“Senior is...”

“This is Old Jiu of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce!” The beautiful woman took the initiative to introduce Yang Kai.

“Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce?” Yang Kai’s brow twitched, “Senior may have heard my name from Xue Yue.”

Old Jiu’s eyes lit up and he nodded and said, “That’s right, I heard about you from the Third Young Master. This old master remembers the last Third Young Master came back from the Emperor Garden he mentioned you several times. Is Little Brother familiar with Third Young Master?”

“En,” Yang Kai braced himself and nodded.

Rather than familiar, that woman Xue Yue couldn’t wait to cut him up into tiny little pieces...

“This is really fate!” Old Jiu was overjoyed, “It is no small matter for the Third Young Master to never forget a person. Little Brother, if you are willing to join my Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, you can definitely become one of my Chamber of Commerce’s future high-level figures with your aptitude. You should understand just how influential my Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce is in the Star Field, right?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Hey Old Jiu, this Mistress came here first, didn’t she? Isn’t it a bit unfair for you to suddenly cut in line?” Li Wan Ning saw Old Jiu speaking so straightly that she suddenly felt a little unhappy.

“How can this kind of thing be decided by a first-come-first-served attitude? Clearly, the one who strikes first has the advantage!” Old Jiu laughed loudly while he continued trying to win over Yang Kai, “Little Brother, Xue Yue Third Young Master rarely cares about any young talents, and this old master also knows a little bit about your strength and aptitude, so if you join my Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, this old master can take responsibility to offer you this...”

Old Jiu began listing a set of attractive conditions that caused all the nearby cultivators who were listening to gasp and stare at Yang Kai with envy and jealousy, wishing they could rush up and recommend themselves while begging Old Jiu to let them join Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce.

“Don’t listen to him, what’s so good about Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce?” Li Wan Ning sneered and immediately set her beautiful eyes upon Yang Kai while elegantly saying, “Little brother, as long as you promise to join my Purple Star, I can offer you the same conditions as Old Jiu as well as find you an Origin King Realm master to personally guide your cultivation. Of course, if you would like, this Queen can also personally guide you. What do you say?”

“Don’t go making exaggerated claims without having anything to back your words up with, you two,” The old woman surnamed Lei couldn’t help butting in, tapping her cane on the ground as she turned to Yang Kai and said. “Little brother, you should join my Sword Union instead. En, our Sword Union always welcomes young fresh blood. As long as you agree to join now, this token is yours!”

Saying so, the old woman surnamed Lei suddenly summoned a black token into her hand.

The token was made from neither metal nor jade and had a sword-shaped emblem on it while pulsing with a faint but sharp aura.

“A Sword Union Elder Token!” A rather knowledgeable person called out as he gazed at this token blazingly.

“Impossible, how could it be a Sword Union Elder Token? Can a Second-Order Origin Realm cultivator even become a Sword Union Elder?”

“Senior Lei is truly bold. There should only be ten Great Elders in the entire Sword Union, each one a top-rank character.”

“Tsk tsk, with this Elder Token, one can mobilize a large part of the human and financial resources of Sword Union. With it, there would be no need to worry about one’s cultivation in the future.”

“What is so special about this little brat? Why are so many masters trying to win him over?”

Amongst the onlookers, various reactions like admiration, jealousy, and confusion abounded.

No one understood why these Origin Kings were ignoring all the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators around them and doing their best to invite a mere Second-Order Origin Returning Realm boy to join their forces instead.

All of them weren’t any worse than him, right? Many felt indignant and began having competitive thoughts.

With the Star Field’s three super forces all having set out their offers, the other Origin Kings were unwilling to fall behind and instantly began trying to woo Yang Kai one by one, each of them expressing an extremely sincere attitude.

There was only one lone Origin King Realm old man who remained indifferent, as his intentions here were simply to purchase Domain Stones.

“Several Seniors’ intentions, Junior understands well,” Yang Kai waited for them to finish before nodding sincerely.

He never expected that he would receive so much attention just after stepping out of the Blood Prison. These Origin King Realm masters were all trying to win him over with unusual zeal!

Each of them had a friendly attitude and a very sincere look on their face.

However, the more enthusiastic they acted, the more disturbed Yang Kai’s heart became!

These masters inviting him so vigorously must be because they knew about his performance inside the Blood Prison, otherwise, how could they act like this?

And the reason why they could understand this was all because of Luo Hai!

[This place is not suitable to stay for long!] Yang Kai secretly made up his mind to immediately leave Green Mountains Star after Qian Tong finished his breakthrough successfully.

“Since you understand, what is your decision?” Li Wan Ning asked nervously.

From Luo Hai, they deeply understood how excellent Yang Kai was. Throughout the ages, many Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators had entered the Blood Prison, but the number who had come out unscathed was one, Yang Kai being the very first.

This alone was enough for them to want to win the other over, not to mention that they were able to tell that Yang Kai had some incredible ability, with their vision.

He was definitely a genius among geniuses, and no one wanted to miss out on a chance to recruit him.
