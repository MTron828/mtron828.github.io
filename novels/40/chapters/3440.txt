“Okay, okay, don’t get angry, it’s bad for your body. I apologize, okay?”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes at her, “I don’t see the slightest sincerity in your apology.”

Yu Ru Meng asked, “Then what kind of sincerity do you want?”

Yang Kai curled his finger to beckon her. Yu Ru Meng leaned her ear over and Yang Kai whispered in her ear.

Yu Ru Meng gave him a quick glance, and nodded, “Sure.”

“A real woman never goes back on her word. You promised!” Yang Kai suddenly beamed in joy.

“I promise.” Yu Ru Meng nodded happily, “As long as you can make me, you can do as you like!”

Yang Kai was a little dumbfounded, [Make you? You’re a Demon Saint! How is that possible?!] Understanding this, he burst out, “You’re screwing with me!”

Yu Ru Meng giggled as her tender body flickered and turned into a stream of light that shot forward. Mid-flight, she turned back and taunted him, “Chase after me. I’ll give you a treat if you can catch me.”

“You’re a naughty one!” Yang Kai grinned as Space Principles fluctuated and his figure flashed and disappeared, hurriedly chasing after her.

The two figures, one in front and one behind, passed through the air at an incredible speed. Although Yang Kai worked hard to push his Space Principles, Yu Ru Meng’s cultivation was just too outstanding, making it impossible to catch up with her, leaving Yang Kai feeling extremely helpless.

After an hour, Yu Ru Meng stopped suddenly. She raised her head slightly, opened her arms as if to embrace the whole world and took in a deep breath.

Yang Kai hurried over from behind, looking pleased with himself.

“I’m finally back,” Yu Ru Meng let out a long sigh, with a satisfied expression on her face.

Yang Kai looked at her from the side, then looked down at the fragmented continent below, and started, “When you said you wanted to take me somewhere, was it the Demon Realm?”

Yu Ru Meng nodded and admitted, “Yes.”

“A dignified Demon Saint did not hesitate to use her Heart Seal Secret Technique on me. It seems like the Demon Realm is very interested in my ability to manipulate Space Principles.” Yang Kai grinned meaningfully.

Yu Ru Meng smiled and explained, “Space Principles are indeed a very peculiar power. Although there are many who live in the Demon Realm, no one is proficient in the Dao of Space, while in the Star Boundary, only you and Li Wu Yi have notable accomplishments in it. Since Li Wu Yi is a Pseudo-Great Emperor, it’s not easy to make a move on him, so you became the only option.”

Yang Kai snorted coldly, “So you’ve targeted the weaker one.”

Yu Ru Meng tilted her head at him, “I even sacrificed myself for you, why are you still upset?”

Yang Kai answered, “I’m not upset. It is my honour to be so valued by a mighty Demon Saint, but I still don’t understand. Since you’re a Demon Saint, you could have just captured me, why bother spending so much time and effort?”

“Do you think that I didn’t want to?” Yu Ru Meng sighed helplessly, “But I changed my appearance using a Secret Technique, and could only exert the power of a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master in the Star Boundary. I wasn’t your opponent in that state, so I couldn’t bring you to the Demon Realm unless you were willing to come.”

“I see,” Yang Kai suddenly realized, secretly rejoicing in his heart that his plan somewhat coincided with Yu Ru Meng’s plan, otherwise he would not have entered the Demon Realm with such ease.

He pondered for a while before questioning again, “Then what do you want from me? Do you want me to set up Space Arrays to help you more quickly mobilize the Demon Race’s troops?”

“Could you do that?” Yu Ru Meng looked at him in surprise.

Yang Kai shook his head slowly, “It can’t be done. My Space Arrays only function within the same world, and the Demon Realm is clearly a special case. Since each of the fragmented continents here make up independent worlds, Space Arrays can’t be used to connect them. So if you have brought me here for this reason, I’m afraid I will have to disappoint you. If I had a deeper comprehension of the Dao of Space, I might be able to find a way to cross World Barriers, but at the moment that’s impossible.”

Yu Ru Meng smiled lightly, “I already expected as much. Don’t worry, we’re not expecting you to arrange Space Arrays for us. With the Territory Gates, the requisition of the Demon troops is fairly convenient, though it does take a bit more time.”

“Then what am I expected to do?” Yang Kai frowned.

“I’ll tell you when the time comes.”

Seeing Yang Kai’s less than pleased expression, Yu Ru Meng quickly changed the topic, “Do you want to see my true face?”

She had changed her appearance and disguised herself as Li Shi Qing, and although her appearance was restored after returning to the Demon Realm, her face was constantly covered by a strange, hazy power that blurred her features. Only one with a power stronger than hers could break through that layer of power.

But she had told Yang Kai before that her actual face would not be worse than Li Shi Qing’s.

Having said that, she was a Charm Demon, and a Demon Saint at that, so it was only natural that her appearance would not be bad.

“I don’t want to!” Contrary to Yu Ru Meng’s expectation, Yang Kai actually raised his hand and refused.

Yu Ru Meng was taken aback for a moment, “Why? Are you afraid I’m too ugly?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Kai remained nonchalant, “Even if you were as ugly as a pig, you’d still be precious to me. So, your true appearance doesn’t matter.”

“You’re such a sweet talker, aren’t you? No wonder you managed to capture so many women.” Yu Ru Meng snorted before she stretched out her hand to pinch Yang Kai’s chin, just like how Yang Kai did to her in the Star Boundary and forced him to face her, “I want you to see me even if you don’t want to.”

Saying so, the layer of haze on her face faded gradually, revealing an exquisite and stunning countenance.

She had the appearance as pure as a snow fairy, and her beauty was unparalleled. Her features were as youthful and lively as a spring in the mountains, without the slightest impurities. There was even a sense of sacredness and holiness to her.

Yang Kai had originally planned to provoke her, but at this moment, he was completely starstruck.

[Is she really a Charm Demon?] On the battlefield, he had met and killed plenty of Charm Demons, and each and every one of them could be described as seductive and alluring. Their attire was as revealing as possible, and they seemed to be in heat all the time, desperate to strip naked right then and there and seduce anyone they came upon.

But Yu Ru Meng completely subverted Yang Kai’s impression of Charm Demons. She looked so pure that it was unbearable to even think of tainting her. Thinking of what he had done to Yu Ru Meng before, Yang Kai unexpectedly felt a sense of guilt.

Secretly surprised, he quickly focused his mind and returned to his senses.

This woman’s charms were simply unfathomable. She must have cultivated her innate charm to such an extreme that she did not even need to do anything anymore to fascinate others. Her face was enough to enchant her targets, making them feel that she was the most beautiful existence in the world and doing anything to her would be unforgivable.

The corners of Yu Ru Meng’s eyes curved up like crescents, very satisfied with Yang Kai’s response as she softly whispered, “Am I pretty?”

Yang Kai bobbed his head like a chicken pecking rice, then instinctively put his arm around Yu Ru Meng’s soft waist, and moved his lips towards hers involuntarily.

A slender jade finger pressed against Yang Kai’s lips, however, as Yu Ru Meng looked at him teasingly, “It’s not that easy to take advantage of me in the Demon Realm.”

Yang Kai bullied her terribly when they were in the Star Boundary. She was a Demon Saint, but she was forced into near-death situations with Yang Kai at every turn and was even flipped over on his lap and was spanked without any power to resist. Now that they were in her territory though, how could she let slip an opportunity for payback?

Yang Kai wrapped his lips around her finger though, trying his best to tease her as he muttered, “Ru Meng, I think it’s time for us to consummate our relationship. You know what I want, and I came to the Demon Realm knowing it was impossible to go back. Can you bear to see me suffer?”

Yu Ru Meng laughed sweetly, “I told you, as long as you can make me, you can do whatever you want.”

“Who knows how long that will take?” Yang Kai complained with a bitter face, “You’re presenting me with the grandest of feasts without letting me eat it.”

“I don’t care, let go.” Yu Ru Meng shook her head slowly.

Yang Kai rolled his tongue around her finger and shook his head, “Nope.”

Yu Ru Meng was mad but wanted to laugh at the same time, “If you don’t let go, I won’t be polite to you.”

“How impolite will you be?” Yang Kai smiled cheekily.

Yu Ru Meng had no choice. She raised her other hand and lightly flicked her middle finger at Yang Kai’s forehead at lightning speed.

With a bang, Yang Kai was sent tumbling a thousand metres before he could stabilize himself. The world was currently spinning around him and it was only with great difficulty that he managed to recover from the shock and yell angrily at Yu Ru Meng, “Are you trying to kill me!?”

Yu Ru Meng just snickered, “I’m simply teaching you a lesson, I’ll do the same thing again the next time you pester me this way.”

Yang Kai’s eyes were threatening to pop out of their sockets. He was fuming. They were truly merciless, the wheels of fate, if he had known it when they were still in the Star Boundary, he would have taken her without hesitation to avoid the mess he was currently in.

[Fine, I can’t beat her, so I’ll just bear with it!]

Resentment clearly displayed on his face as he complained silently in his heart.

Yu Ru Meng stretched out her hand, and Yang Kai was drawn back towards her by a huge force involuntarily. Yu Ru Meng reached out and grabbed Yang Kai’s collar again, pulled him close, tiptoed, and planted a gentle kiss on his forehead.

Yang Kai stretched out his hand and wiped his forehead, and snickered, “What’s this? Trying to make me feel better after that with just a small kiss? Am I a three-year-old?”

“Think what you’d like. Good, let’s stop this. I will take you somewhere first.”

Saying so, she surged her Demon Qi, which wrapped itself around Yang Kai, and the two of them rushed towards a nearby Territory Gate.

Yang Kai was sulking silently, but Yu Ru Meng did not care. With the restoration of her cultivation, this woman seemed to become more confident. She no longer followed Yang Kai desperately as she did in the Star Boundary, giving him a strange sense of loss.

The two sped all the way, passing through Territory Gate after Territory Gate, going through continent after continent.

As Yu Ru Meng said before, these fragmented continents were all very different. The big ones, which could be several hundred thousand kilometres in radius, were so large that their borders could not be seen, while the small ones were just as small as the fragmented continent where the two worlds passage was located. As long as one looked from a little higher, the outline of the entire continent could be seen.

Moreover, the environment of these fragmented continents varied greatly. Some continents were abundant in World Energy and vitality, while others were dead, and had scarce World Energy.

Yang Kai observed in amazement all the way along.

But without exception, these fragmented continents were rich in Demon Qi, and non-Demon Realm creatures absolutely would not be able to survive safely here…
