Yang Kai couldn’t help becoming excited with this discovery. If that was the case, then the Star Boundary Great Emperors, himself included, would have a much easier time to advance into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm compared to others. That was because cultivating in the Star Boundary was a shortcut for them!

What’s more, he initially planned to find an opportunity to advance into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm upon his return from the Shattered Heaven.

The Proprietress had been in retreat for close to 100 years now, but even so, she was nowhere near breaking through to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm. It could be seen just how difficult it was to cross over from the Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm to the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm!

It had not been long since Yang Kai advanced into the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. Be that as it may, his heritage was extraordinary thanks to various opportunities he had come across. Ordinary Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters could not compare to him at all. He had just enough qualification to try advancing into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm.

It was precisely because of this plan that he came up with the brilliant idea of asking the Cave Heavens and Paradises to provide the opportunity to train in the Small Source Worlds in exchange for the right to use the Good Fortune Divine Furnace.

He only needed to enter one more Small Source World for training to accumulate his Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm heritage to the peak, then he could enter retreat with peace of mind. But, he would need to fulfil his 100 year contract with Yin-Yang Cave Heaven before that.

Qu Hua Shang was put in isolation for 100 years, but based on a quick calculation of the time, there was only a couple dozen or so years left before she would be released.

There was no saying how long it would take for Yang Kai to try advancing into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm. Nevertheless, he could not keep Qu Hua Shang waiting. Yin-Yang Cave Heaven and Xu Ling Gong would not approve either. That was why he needed to wait for Qu Hua Shang’s 100 year isolation to end before he could proceed with his plan.

Enter a Small Source World belonging to one of the Cave Heavens and Paradises to train and accumulate his Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm heritage to the peak, then head to Yin-Yang Cave Heaven to pick up Qu Hua Shang, and finally enter retreat with peace of mind to attempt advancing into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm. That was Yang Kai’s his original plan.

Now that he learned about the situation in the Star Boundary though, the opportunity to train in the Small Source World no longer mattered. Such opportunities were rare after all, and it was better to leave such opportunities to the other people in Void Land. It was enough for him and the other Star Boundary Great Emperors to cultivate with the help of the Star Boundary’s World Force alone.

Just as Yang Kai was quietly making plans in his heart, he heard Mo Huang saying something with a small laugh, “It’s because of the current situation in the Star Boundary that the Star Boundary Great Emperors have not gone to the Small Stone World to cultivate. All of us have stayed behind in the Star Boundary. Although the situation in the Small Stone World is similar to the Star Boundary, there are more limitations in the Star Boundary. With the exceptions of the Great Emperors, the other Open Heaven Realm Masters do not benefit from cultivating in the Star Boundary.”

Yang Kai asked in astonishment, “The situation in the Small Stone World is similar to the Star Boundary?”

This was only his second time hearing about the Small Stone World. Hua Qing Si had also mentioned the name earlier; however, he did not ask any questions and she did not explain in detail. It was unexpected to hear about the situation in the Small Stone World from Mo Huang at this moment.

“Don’t you know?” Mo Huang looked at Yang Kai questioningly.

Yang Kai shook his head, “I just came back not long ago. Head Manager Hua did not tell me anything in detail and simply asked me to check out the situation myself.”

Mo Huang nodded in understanding, “In that case, you should go. The Small Stone World is the name that Head Manager gave that Universe World. You will understand immediately once you arrive there.”

Yang Kai nodded, “In that case, I’ll be going now.”

The Territory Gate was protected by a special Space Array that Yang Kai had personally arranged together with Luan Bai Feng; therefore, a special token that he created was required for people to travel through it safely. Recklessly trying to trespass would only cause the trespasser to be exiled to the Void. This was the final defence he left behind to prevent the Cave Heavens and Paradises from putting their hands on the New Great Territory.

Other people might require the special token to use the Territory Gate, but Yang Kai had no such difficulties. Yang Kai activated his power to wrap around Hei He once more, then the two of them passed through the Territory Gate and entered the New Great Territory.

Hei He took the lead and Yang Kai followed closely behind. Along the way, they occasionally encountered figures shuttling through the void or ships speeding past them.

There were a total of about 2,000 Open Heaven Realm Masters in Void Land and High Heaven Palace combined. Out of these 2,000, approximately 1,500 of them had been dispatched by Hua Qing Si to explore and develop the New Great Territory.

It was all thanks to the hard work of these 1,500 Open Heaven Realm Masters over the past few decades that Void Land and High Heaven Palace had so many resources to splurge.

The cultivation resources and materials of various Orders produced by the New Great Territory accounted for half of Void Land and High Heaven Palace’s total income. Meanwhile, the other half came from the combined output of the two Star Cities and the Black Prison. It could be seen just how rich the New Great Territory was.

The pair travelled for more than half a month before a Universe World finally appeared in front of them. It was a green Universe World and Yang Kai could already sense the abundant aura coming from it before he even got close.

This Universe World was much bigger than the Star Boundary, almost five times the size in fact. Looking down from above, the entire Universe World seemed to be covered in large swathes of green, indicating it was filled with dense forests.

Hei He briefly checked his bearings before he led Yang Kai half way around the Small Stone World and plunged into the clouds on the opposite side.

There was a Spirit Peak below them that soared into the clouds. Furthermore, there was a bamboo building atop the Spirit Peak where two familiar auras were residing.

Yang Kai and Hei He sped over in that direction.

The two people cultivating inside the bamboo building clearly noticed the arrival of Yang Kai and Hei He and immediately came out of the building and looked up into the sky.

A short while later, Yang Kai and Hei He landed lightly as Yue He greeted them joyfully, “Young Master!”

Behind her, Zhou Ya bowed elegantly, “Greetings, Sir!”

Yang Kai nodded and looked around his surroundings, “Are you the only ones here?”

There were over 20 Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in Void Land. The Great Emperors had stayed behind in the Star Boundary while to Mo Mei, Yang Xue, and Yang Kai’s numerous Wives had stayed behind in Void Land. On the other hand, the others such as Yue He, Mao Zhe, Geng Qing, Zhou Ya, Hui Gu, Hua Yong, Shu Mu Dan, Xiang Ying, and Fang Yue had all gone to the New Great Territory.

However, the others who were stationed in the New Great Territory were nowhere to be seen at this moment.

Yue He explained, “The others are helping with the development of the New Great Territory. Although there are few dangers in this place, there are many tasks that require the presence of a Master to prevent any unexpected accidents. After some discussion, we decided to work in groups of two and take turns to rest. It happened to be my turn to rest with Senior Sister Zhou, so we returned to this place.”

Yang Kai nodded, “You’ve worked hard.”

Yue He smiled and shook her head, “It’s not hard at all.”

“Let’s go inside and talk.” Yang Kai gestured, to which the two women nodded in response.

Hei He cupped his fist and said, “Sir, this subordinate will return to his duties now.”

“Good, go on.” Yang Kai nodded.

Hei He took a deep breath and looked around somewhat reluctantly before soaring into the sky.

The three of them entered the bamboo building. While Zhou Ya was brewing tea, Yue He and Yang Kai talked about the development of the New Great Territory. Hua Qing Si had explained some of it to Yang Kai, but her understanding of the situation was not as detailed as Yue He’s; after all, Yue He and the others had been staying in the New Great Territory over the past few years. They were the first to know about any changes that occurred in this place, and it was only later that they would report the incident to High Heaven Palace.

The resources in the New Great Territory were extremely rich, indeed. The countless Universe Worlds that had yet to be developed contained a seemingly inexhaustible supply of cultivation materials of various Orders, as well as many rare and precious treasures.

For example, the newly-born Universe World that they discovered at the very beginning harboured precious treasures such as World Source Liquid, which was the main ingredient for refining Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills.

This was part of the reason as to why Yang Kai had sealed the New Great Territory’s Territory Gate and monopolised the resources in this place.

The Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills had brought a lot of income and fame to Void Land, which in turn gathered large numbers of people to Void Star City. If a large quantity of World Source Liquid was leaked out into the world, then the advantage Void Land enjoyed would be gone forever.

In addition, many treasures such as the Divine Dao Water that could fortify a person’s Dao Seal and the Tai Yi Soul Cleansing Water that could cleanse the Powers from the Dao Seal to give a cultivator a chance to start over had also been found in great abundance here.

“Young Master, have you heard of the Four Universe Pillars?” Yue He asked all of a sudden.

Yang Kai’s expression became strange as he nodded, “I’ve heard of them before.”

He had more than heard of them before. During his trip to the Shattered Heaven, he had been hunted relentlessly because of the World Spring. In the end, he finally escaped by fleeing into the Ancestral Land.

Yang Kai thus asked suspiciously, “Did you discover one of the Four Universe Pillars in the New Great Territory?”

The Four Universe Pillars were incredible treasures. He himself had refined the World Spring, so he had profound experience in this regard. Thanks to the World Spring, Yang Kai’s Small Universe was incredibly firm and stable. His Small Universe would not be shaken when he engaged in brutal conflict with powerful enemies, allowing his World Force to always flow smoothly.

Without the risk of his Small Universe being shaken or destroyed, he could also raise living creatures inside his Small Universe to steadily enhance his heritage and reduce the time he needed for intense cultivation.

Even an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master like Bright Sun Divine Monarch would go crazy with jealousy over the Four Universe Pillars. It would be an amazing discovery if one of the Four Universe Pillars was found in the New Great Territory.

“Yes, and no.” Yue He smiled, “Since you know about the Four Universe Pillars, Sect Master, I’m sure you’ve also heard of the Four Great Universe Pillars and the Twelve Minor Universe Pillars.”

Yang Kai nodded.

“What we discovered in the New Great Territory is not one of the Four Great Pillars, but one of the Twelve Minor Pillars, the Profound Yin Bamboo. It’s just that we don’t have any Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters at the moment, so we can only place it aside for now. We agreed to wait for you to return and decide what to do with the Profound Yin Bamboo, Sect Master.”

The Twelve Minor Pillars and the Four Great Pillars were not the same although their effects were similar in that they fortified a cultivator’s Small Universe. There was no doubt, however, that the effects of the Four Great Pillars were stronger.

Refining any one of the Four Great Pillars was enough to reinforce a cultivator’s Small Universe and prevent any external force that was not beyond a certain critical threshold from affecting it. In comparison, the Twelve Minor Pillars did not have such magnificent effects. The Profound Yin Bamboo, for example, could only produce about 30% of the effect of one of the Four Great Pillars.

While the Four Great Pillars could be refined by any Open Heaven Realm Master regardless of their Order, the Twelve Minor Pillars could only be refined by High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters. The Small Universe in their bodies had to materialize before they could refine the Twelve Minor Pillars; hence, those below the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm could not refine the Twelve Minor Pillars.

That was why even though one of the Twelve Minor Pillars had been discovered in the New Great Territory, Yue He and the others could only leave the Profound Yin Bamboo untouched and place a seal around the area for protection.

Yang Kai already had the World Spring, so he had no interest in the Profound Yin Bamboo. After a brief consideration though, he came up with a plan, “Give the Profound Yin Bamboo to whichever Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master among yourselves advances into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm first.”

Yue He pursed her lips into a smile, “There is a large patch of Profound Yin Bamboo growing here, more than enough for many people. Besides, it is said that the Profound Yin Bamboo will continue to reproduce when placed in one’s Small Universe. Each person will only need to take a small piece of the root. You don’t need to worry about not having enough resources for everyone, Young Master.”

Yang Kai smiled after hearing her assurance, “That’s for the best.”

In this way, anybody from Void Land who advanced into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm would receive a stalk of Profound Yin Bamboo. Even so, it would take a long time to nurture the Profound Yin Bamboo shoot so that it could produce satisfactory effects. The Profound Yin Bamboo could never compare with the World Spring in this regard.

“Young Master, do you want to harvest some of the Profound Yin Bamboo to sell? Many people will be interested in this item,” Yue He asked.

Yang Kai was silent for a moment before he said, “There’s no rush. Let’s revisit this topic when we’ve gotten stronger; otherwise, we don’t know how many people will become greedy once we reveal such treasures to the world.”
