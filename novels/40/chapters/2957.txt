The palanquin was extremely luxurious, and its translucent pink curtains gave off a hazy sense of extravagance.

There was a man and two women reclining on the palanquin with wine and fresh fruit placed on the divan. The man held a woman in each arm while sipping on wine and eating a spirit fruit with a look of comfort on his face. The two women were wearing very little, so much of their snow-white skin was exposed. They were squirming around in his arms, the sound of their coquettish flirtations incessantly leaking out as they waged a veiled contention for his affection.

As if no one else were around him, the man fondled the tender bodies of the two women wantonly with his large hands, drawing a charming gasp from time to time.

All the people along the way knelt down before him, not daring to look up, much less to discover the infinite beauty of spring happening inside the palanquin. Only the sweet and charming voices of the women remained to be heard, fanning the flames of desire in the men in the crowd.

In the blink of an eye, the palanquin arrived in front of the teahouse. Before the palanquin was even lowered, the Dao Source Realm palanquin bearers straightened their bodies and stood in place.

It was silent all around. Only the decadent sounds within the curtains grew more and more obvious.

Yang Kai stared with great interest.

Blushing slightly, Zhu Qing snorted, and when she saw the lustful expression on Yang Kai’s face, she couldn’t help but kick him under the table and glare at him, “What are you looking at? If you keep looking, your eyes are going to fall out.”

Yang Kai grimaced in pain as he grinned, “Qing’er, you look so adorable when you’re jealous.”

“Nonsense,” Zhu Qing blushed even redder, “W-W-Who’s jealous?”

The two were flirting without any regard for anyone else, drawing cold looks from the cultivators around them. A burly bald headed man walked into the teahouse next, seemingly a lackey, but he had an impressive Second-Order Emperor Realm cultivation, with a full and robust aura.

He glared coldly at Yang Kai and Zhu Qing before bellowing, “The First Imperial Prince has come, are you still not going to kneel?”

“So it really is an Imperial Prince.” Yang Kai exchanged glances with Zhu Qing. It was just a casual guess he made earlier, but he didn’t expect it to actually be an Imperial Prince who arrived.

He and Zhu Qing had only been in Human Imperial City for a short time but had already had a small conflict with the Third Imperial Prince’s subordinates, so Yang Kai didn’t expect this First Imperial Prince to show up just a while later.

The Third Imperial Prince gave him a warning, then sent someone to him immediately after, undoubtedly in hopes to take him in as his subordinate.

But Yang Kai had no idea what this First Imperial Prince was planning to do by coming here; however, from how the First Imperial Prince embraced a woman in each arm, he had a vague guess, which instantly made him feel displeased. Even his tone became unkind as he snorted, “I apologize, but this Young Master does not have the habit of kneeling to others. If you have something to say, then say it. Otherwise, get lost.”

The burly bald headed man was infuriated by his answer and roared, “Impudence!”

After saying that, he raised his hand and was just about to make a move when a soft voice came from the palanquin, “Stop right now. Using violence over such a small matter… What are you going to do if you hurt this beauty?”

Upon hearing that, the burly bald-headed man withdrew his hand immediately, but he still shot a mean glare at Yang Kai.

The voice from the palanquin continued, “Beauty, let’s get to know each other. I am Human Imperial City’s First Imperial Prince, Fu Shu. Are you interested in following this Prince out to have some fun?”

Before Zhu Qing could even answer, the two women in Fu Shu’s arms became dissatisfied and one of them climbed on top of Fu Shu, feeding him a mouthful of wine from her mouth before coyly whispering, “First Imperial Prince is so bad, you’re actually still looking for others despite having us sisters to serve you.”

The other woman also chimed in, “That’s right, First Imperial Prince. What’s so good about that cold-faced woman? How could she be as understanding and attentive as us sisters? Don’t bother with her, First Imperial Prince. Who knows where this village girl came from, let’s go back to the imperial palace. Elder Sister and I recently came up with a good idea that will surely satisfy you.”

The First Imperial Prince swallowed the fine wine into his belly, which made his body feel light and airy, before squeezing the soft and tender bodies of the two women by his side with his big hands, drawing sweet moans from them as he laughed, “You two are good, but she’s not so bad either. This Prince can just take her in to become your sister.”

“No! We already have enough sisters. First Imperial Prince, don’t take in any more!”

“That’s right! We can’t even count all those sisters we have, and First Imperial Prince, you promised this humble servant a few days ago that you wouldn’t play around again. Why are you going back on your promise after just a few days? I won’t forgive that!”

The First Imperial Prince laughed dryly, “Yes, yes, yes, this Prince did say that before, but this beauty wasn’t around then. I’ll take in one more, one last one. I absolutely won’t take in any more in the future.”

“First Imperial Prince is lying, I don’t believe you!”

“No, First Imperial Prince! There’s nothing special about this woman. Oh… She has red hair. If First Imperial Prince likes it, we sisters can also dye our hair red and show it to you every day until you have your fill.”

“How could that be the same?” Fu Shu shook his head incessantly, “You may not know this, but even though that beauty doesn’t look like anything special, I heard she’s from the outside world. This Prince has seen countless women, but it’s the first time this Prince has encountered one from the outside world, so I naturally can’t let her go so easily.”

“She’s from the outside?”

“What’s so unusual about that? Women are all the same. First Imperial Prince…”

“Enough. Both of you shut up.” Fu Shu’s tone suddenly cooled, instantly silencing the two women who were trying to act coy. They understood their own status and their position in the First Imperial Prince’s eyes. They were mere playthings, so it was fine for them to whine a little in order to receive more pampering, but if they insisted on stopping the First Imperial Prince from having his fun, then they would surely lose all favour with him.

The First Imperial Prince had numerous beautiful women in his residence, so it was by no means necessary for him to keep the two of them to serve him.

So, as soon as they noticed the difference in the First Imperial Prince’s tone, the two women did not dare to disobey, with one of them immediately changing her tune, “Since First Imperial Prince likes her so much, then just take her in. It’ll just be one more sister for us. Anything is fine as long as First Imperial Prince is happy.”

“Elder Sister is right. This woman’s looks don’t seem bad. She can barely be qualified to serve First Imperial Prince.”

A smile instantly spread across Fu Shu’s face and he kissed the cheeks of the women on his left and right before laughing happily, “You two are the most reasonable of my women, en this Prince did not favour you for nothing.”

Two tender bodies squirmed around in the First Imperial Prince’s arms with the older woman speaking up, “But this beauty’s heart seems to belong to someone else. What is First Imperial Prince going to do?”

Fu Shu smiled, “Naturally it’s because she doesn’t know this Prince’s might. Once she’s had a taste of this Prince’s skills, how will she be able to think about another man? Just wait and see, this Prince is going to make her bend!” While saying that, he broke away from the two tender bodies and straightened his loose clothes before standing up in the palanquin. Lifting the curtain, he stepped down and raised his eyes to look at Zhu Qing once he entered the teahouse.

As soon as he did, his heart was brimming with delight.

He was not able to see too clearly behind the curtain just earlier, so it was only now that he could see that this red-haired woman was simply beautiful beyond words. Even though her face looked a little icy, it only provoked a man’s desire to conquer her further.

As he said, he had never had a taste of a beauty from the outside world before, not because he was lacking in power, but because it has been many years since outsiders last came into Human Imperial City.

He was the First Imperial Prince and in Human Imperial City, he stood below only one man, while above countless others. Any beauty he wanted, he only needed to give the order and someone would immediately arrange it for him. Not a single one of those women dared to resist. On the contrary, they all tried their best to please him.

Having grown so used to fine delicacies, a change of taste every once in a while was also a blessing.

So, the colder Zhu Qing’s expression was, the more it pleased him. Deep inside, he was eager to take this red-haired beauty back to the imperial palace immediately and love her tenderly.

His hot, unrestrained gaze was like a leech biting down on Zhu Qing’s face, examining her from top to bottom.

Yang Kai moved and stood in front of Zhu Qing.

The First Imperial Prince’s face changed at once. As if he’d stepped on a pile of smelly shit, he said with a look of disgust, “What is your name?”

Before Yang Kai could answer, Fu Shu waved his hand, “Never mind, no matter what your name is, step aside if you want to live. For your merit of offering up this beauty, this Prince can bestow you one leaf.”

At these words, the gazes of the cultivators all around turned hot.

The status of one leaf may be the lowest level of a noble, but it was still a noble status that could enjoy privileges in Human Imperial City that ordinary people can only dream of. This would instantly set him apart from the ordinary citizens of the city. Of the servants nearby, many had followed the First Imperial Prince for numerous years, but none of them had ever received similar rewards. They did not expect this outsider to gain such privileges just because he had a beauty with him, which made many of the First Imperial Prince’s subordinates feel red-eyed with envy, lamenting at the little brat’s good fortune.

The burly bald-headed man stepped forward and yelled furiously at Yang Kai, “Little brat, still not giving thanks and standing back? Do you want to die?”

Yang Kai sighed and gazed seriously at the First Imperial Prince, “This… First Imperial Prince, this one also has deep feelings for his wife and is unwilling to separate. I have no desire to offer up a beauty. First Imperial Prince has Heaven shrouding power and countless beauties by his side. This one can see that the two in the palanquin are already very good, so why set your gaze on a married woman? If word gets out, then this would be detrimental to His Highness’s reputation. Why don’t we just say our goodbyes here, and to meet again if fate plans it?”

Fu Shu’s face turned cold, “Are you insulting my intelligence or your own?”

The corner of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched as he also found his proposal overly naive.

Fu Shu followed up, “This Prince does not want to take advantage of his position to bully people either. What about this? If you think those two in the palanquin are good, then this Prince will give them to you. I want the one standing behind you.”

When they heard those words, the faces of the two women in the palanquin became extremely stiff, as if they had been struck by lightning, but they didn’t dare to say anything. For a while, they had miserable looks on their faces, weeping in the shadows.

Yang Kai said in amazement, “This… Wouldn’t this be a loss for First Imperial Prince?”

Fu Shu snorted, “This Prince is generous, what harm is there to let you take this bit of an advantage?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “But I’m not interested in taking advantage of others. Staying with my wife is enough for me.”

Fu Shu waved his hand and said impatiently, “Then consider it a reward, no need to thank me!”

Yang Kai opened his mouth, but he had no idea what to say.

Zhu Qing said from behind him, “Seems like they won’t let me go. What are you going to do?”

Yang Kai grinned, revealing a bright smile, “What else can I do? Since they’ve come, I’ll just fight them!”
