Chapter 1724, Sea God Bead

Before the six Array Masters of Sea Temple had time to speak, Yang Kai had already inserted the necessary Saint Crystals to activate the array.

The Space Array immediately started up and after a burst of white light, the six Array Masters only felt a slight weightless sensation overcome them. By the time they reacted, the scenery in front of them had changed drastically.

Looking around, the earth was a charred, reddish-black colour and the surrounding air was filled with a rich Fire Attribute energy, making it a bit stifling.

This was completely different from the Limitless Ocean where Sea Temple was located.

Below their feet was a large round Space Array identical to the one they had just finished arranging. Around them, there were several cultivators busy erecting a large palace that was clearly a work in progress.

The busy cultivators nearby were all wearing uniform robes with a small ‘High’ character embroidered over their chests!

[High Heaven Sect disciples!] The six Sea Temple people immediately realized they had arrived at High Heaven Sect as the environment around them was very similar to the legendary Flowing Flame Sand Field.

The activation of the Space Array alarmed the nearby High Heaven Sect disciples, and a few quickly came to investigate, but upon discovering that the newcomer was Yang Kai, the disciples quickly cupped their fists in salute.

Yang Kai simply waved his hand, “I’m just testing whether this Space Array works properly, carry on with what you were doing.”

“Yes!” The disciples received their orders and dispersed.

This Space Array was placed outside the Flowing Flame Sand Field by Yang Kai in order to avoid the drawbacks of there being a direct entryway into High Heaven Sect’s headquarters.

This Space Array was of great significance, as it was the bridge which connected High Heaven Sect to the larger world.

Yang Kai intended to set up special Space Arrays in all major cities across Shadowed Star so that High Heaven Sect could reach anywhere at any time in an instant.

This would be of key importance to the future development of High Heaven Sect.

“Sect Master!” One High Heaven Sect disciple didn’t leave immediately but stood there respectfully cupping his fists.

“Is there something else?”

“Great Elder told me a few days ago that if Sect Master appears, I am to inform him that half a month ago, Shadow Moon Hall’s Sect Master Qian sent a request for Sect Master to visit Shadow Moon Hall to discuss a certain matter!”

“En,” Yang Kai nodded.

The disciple then retreated.

Yang Kai did not know what Qian Tong was looking for him for, but it should not be an urgent matter, otherwise, he would have come in person rather than simply requesting Yang Kai come see him. Additionally, the current Qian Tong was an Origin King, so few things in this world could threaten him.

Yang Kai did not consider this matter urgent and decided to prioritize finishing his current task before going to Shadow Moon Hall to meet with Qian Tong.

After experimenting with the Space Array, Yang Kai returned to Black Reef Island along with the six Sea Temple Array Masters.

The six cultivators seemed to still be a bit unsatiated.

The old man looked towards Yang Kai with extreme admiration and said, “Sect Master Yang, this old master has used many Space Arrays over his life, but every time, the farther the transmission distance, the more backlash he received; however, this Space Array causes no discomfort or dizziness at all, a truly brilliant achievement! This old master is in awe of Sect Master Yang’s great talent!”

The other five people also nodded in agreement.

Space Arrays were truly convenient tools to use, but teleporting over long distances caused great strain on a cultivator. This strain was not only related to one’s physical body, but also one’s Soul.

The further the distance one teleported, the greater the load.

Therefore, weaker cultivators did not dare use Space Arrays to teleport too far. Under the most extreme of circumstances, teleporting a greater distance than one was capable of withstanding would destroy one’s Knowledge Sea, leaving them brain dead. Even short-distance teleportations couldn’t be conducted too frequently.

Among these six Array Masters, all of them had used Space Arrays multiple times, so all of them were well aware of the drawbacks.

However, the ultra-long distance teleportation they just conducted, one on the order of several million kilometres, actually didn’t produce any kind of discomfort. Using this Space Array felt no more difficult than visiting a neighbour’s house.

In other words, the Space Array arranged by Yang Kai had far surpassed the ability of those ancient relics in terms of stability and usability.

This caused the six Array Masters to respect and admire Yang Kai even more than before.

Yang Kai just smiled lightly, “It’s nothing much. En, please transfer the Transmission Tokens in your hands to Old Sha and inform him that when everything in Sea Temple has been settled, he can send someone to High Heaven Sect to meet with Great Elder Ye to discuss the material exchange.”

“Is Sect Master Yang planning on leaving now? Do you not want to stop and rest for a few days and meet with Martial Uncle Sha?” The old man attempted to retain Yang Kai.

“No, I need to head for Sea God Palace,” Yang Kai waved his hand and his figure flickered, disappearing from where he stood.

A look of regret appeared on the faces of the six, but after a brief discussion, they hurried to the centre of Black Reef Island. The six Transmission Tokens were of great importance and they did not dare treat them carelessly.

Sea God Palace was the other great force on the Limitless Ocean together with Sea Temple and was composed of almost all the sentient ocean races.

In fact, Sea God Palace was stronger than Sea Temple both in terms of the number of masters it possessed and the strength it wielded.

Although there was some friction from time to time between these two giants though, neither side desired to go to war on a large scale, so they were able to coexist.

Sea God Palace’s headquarters was located somewhere deep underwater and composed of a sprawling number of beautiful undersea palaces protected by powerful Spirit Arrays. There was even breathable air in some places, the ocean held back by strong barriers.

To others, looking for the headquarters of Sea God Palace on the huge Limitless Ocean floor was akin to looking for a needle in a haystack. Even Sea Temple was unable to figure out where Sea God Palace was located.

But to Yang Kai, this was a simple matter.

After leaving Black Reef Island, it only took him a day to locate Sea God Palace and easily arrive at its entrance.

Here, he did not encounter any difficulties. Although the Sea Clan looked down on the Human Race, it also respected powerful masters.

Yang Kai undoubtedly was qualified to receive a courteous reception here.

What’s more, the little dolphin, the Sea Clan’s princess, was extremely close to Yang Kai.

Qian Mo and Shang Ao, two of the eight Generals, also owed Yang Kai a life-saving gratitude.

As such, forming a cooperative relationship with the Sea Clan was easier than forming one with Sea Temple.

Yang Kai immediately met with the Sea Clan’s king, the father of the little dolphin and patriarch of the Dolphin Flood Dragon Clan, Lie Kong. After engaging in a small exchange of pointers, Lie Kong realized how deep and unfathomable Yang Kai’s strength was and quickly agreed to his proposed trade arrangement.

Just like in Sea Temple, Yang Kai requested Sea God Palace provide him with some materials, and a third Space Array, as well as several Transmission Tokens, were produced inside Sea God Palace a few days later.

With Space Arrays in Sea Temple and Sea God Palace, High Heaven Sect was now able to obtain massive amounts of deep-sea resources anytime it wanted. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Now, whether these resources were used or sold, High Heaven Sect would never lose money. In fact, using this trade route, it would be possible for High Heaven Sect to rapidly expand its available materials, making it so that its disciples never had to worry about having enough cultivation resources to use.

This was an advantage that no other Sect on Shadowed Star possessed!

Yang Kai did not intend to stay in Sea God Palace for long, so after he finished arranging the Space Array, he bid farewell to Lie Kong and prepared to depart.

However, before leaving, something unexpected happened.

The little dolphin came swimming up to Yang Kai’s side with a bead in her mouth and handed it to him.

This bead was the size of a fist and was azure blue, just like the deep sea. Although this bead was not very large, after it was pushed into his hand, Yang Kai discovered that it was actually extremely heavy. What’s more, he could hear the sound of crashing waves coming from it and could sense an extremely rich Water Attribute energy inside of it.

After seeing this bead, Lie Kong, Qian Mo, and Shang Ao, who were all present to see Yang Kai off, wore solemn expressions.

Many others who were present also showed nervous expressions.

“This... I can’t accept it,” Yang Kai smiled slightly as he gently rubbed the little dolphin’s head.

Although he did not know what the story behind this bead was, he could tell from the looks on everyone’s faces that its value was definitely not trivial. He had just managed to establish a cooperative relationship with Sea God Palace so rashly accepting such a heavy gift would likely only make the Sea Clan unhappy.

The main reason Yang Kai refused though was because this gift was given to him by the little dolphin. The little dolphin only had the mental age of a young child and acted entirely based on its personal preferences. In short, she could not represent the wishes of the entire Sea Clan.

If this bead had been given to him by Lie Kong personally, Yang Kai would have gladly accepted it.

Seeing Yang Kai tactfully refuse, the leaders of the Sea Clan all showed relieved expressions.

The little dolphin, however, refused to give up, making a series of rapid cries as if to say it would not rest until Yang Kai accepted her gift.

Yang Kai tried hard to persuade her, but the little dolphin absolutely would not take the bead back, soon even shedding tears of unhappiness, putting Yang Kai in an incredibly awkward position, and forcing him to turn to Lie Kong for help.

Lie Kong anxiously looked at the little dolphin for a while before eventually his expression softened and he spoke, “Since Sect Master Yang has such a close relationship with my daughter, please accept her gift. It is clear that if Sect Master Yang does not accept it, she will be very sad; after all, Sect Master Yang is her lifesaver. Sect Master Yang need not refuse.”

Yang Kai frowned for a moment before asking, “May I ask what this thing is and what its function is?”

“This is one of the treasures of my Sea God Palace, the Sea God Bead, and while it may not be of much use to Sect Master Yang personally, anyone who cultivates Water Attribute Secret Arts or Secret Techniques will benefit greatly from it. This is a piece of the source of the sea, so the Water Attribute energy it contains is not only extremely pure, but also almost inexhaustible. The Sea God Bead was a birthday gift this King gave his daughter two years ago, so it is her personal property and she has every right to gift it to Sect Master Yang,” Lie Kong explained.

“The source of the sea...” Yang Kai’s eyes flashed, “This thing truly is of great use to me, so this Yang will not refuse.”

Lie Kong smiled and nodded.

The other leaders of the Sea Clean, seeing how matters had already gotten this far, had no objections in the end.

“However, this Sea God Bead is still a bit too precious for this Yang Kai to simply accept, so this Yang will exchange it for five hundred Origin Grade Shadowed Heaven Pills. What does Palace Master Lie Kong think?”

“Five hundred Origin Grade Shadowed Heaven Pills?” Lie Kong’s eyes lit up this time.

The expressions of many of the Sea Clan leaders also suddenly became excited.
