The mysterious Master, who chose to Soul Descend in Old Fu’s body, might have his own considerations. First, Lin’er was a girl, making it a little inconvenient, and second, Old Fu was much stronger than Lin’er. The mysterious Master would be able to use a few more moves by manifesting his Soul in Old Fu’s body. Furthermore, he didn’t have to worry about damaging Old Fu afterwards.

Also, it would be a bigger burden on the person with a weaker body when a Master’s Soul manifested in their body.

Under Yang Kai’s watchful gaze, Old Fu, who was lying on the ground, stood up straight, his grey hair dancing as if in the wind despite there not being any blowing. His eyes were now as deep as the sea, giving off an awe-inspiring impression.

In the blink of an eye, Old Fu’s temperament had drastically changed, and the look in his gaze was now one of a superior being, who considered everyone beneath him, like the ruler of the world.

Old Fu glanced around, his gaze momentarily stopping on Yang Kai, before turning to Lin’er’s direction. His face remained stoic, making it hard to tell whether he was happy or angry.

At this point, Lin’er finally showed a response. She reached out to her neck and touched the area where the pendant was originally hanging, then she glanced at Old Fu. After noticing a familiar gaze, she couldn’t help but shrink her neck again, already realizing what had just happened.

“Father…” She called out in a mosquito-like voice. Rather than being happy that her father’s Soul had appeared, it looked more like she was scared.

“Hmph!” Old Fu let out a cold snort before indifferently speaking, “Why are you outside? You should be behind closed doors, reflecting on your mistakes.”

Lin’er was rendered speechless after hearing this, flinching as she looked away, not daring to meet her father’s gaze. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Yang Kai’s brow twitched upon hearing this. It turned out that this Young Lady had secretly run away from home! No wonder she looked afraid when her father had used a Soul Descent. Why did all these little girls like to do this? Mo Xiao Qi also often sneaked out of Spirit Beast Island, now there was this girl too.

All of them were so spoiled! Yang Kai coldly snorted in his heart.

“What did you do now?” Old Fu asked.

Lin’er didn’t answer and instead began glancing left and right, as if she was looking for a way to escape.

“I’ve asked you a question. Why aren’t you answering?” Old Fu suddenly shouted.

Lin’er trembled before blurting out in a conditional reflex, “Your dear daughter was bullied…”

While she replied, tears rolled down her white cheeks before dripping down on the ground. She appeared as pitiful and as sad as could be. Her previous arrogance and domineering bearing were nowhere to be found. Her current performance was completely opposite from before.

Yang Kai was flabbergasted, thinking in heart, [This Young Lady’s acting skills are pretty good. I guess she does this quite often.]

Her tears started pouring out as soon as she started speaking and they kept rolling down like there was no end to them. Her cries sounded extremely miserable and pitiful, as if someone had really bullied her intolerably. Next, she pointed at Yang Kai and shouted, “It was him! He wanted to kill me! Father, you must uphold justice for me!”

Old Fu, maintaining a stoic look, stated, “Is there anyone who would dare to bully you? It’s always you who has been bullying others and causing trouble everywhere you go, but this time you were taught a harsh lesson, am I right?”

He seemed to know his daughter very well and didn’t believe her story at all, hitting the nail on the head in just a few sentences.

Lin’er’s cries came to an abrupt stop as she looked at Old Fu, mouth agape.

“Sir is really wise!” Yang Kai praised, hurriedly cupping his fists, a grin on his face.

Old Fu turned and indifferently looked at Yang Kai, “This King is talking to his daughter. You have no right to interrupt us.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but disdainfully snort, finding the whole situation tiresome and frustrating.

Old Fu then asked, “Aren’t you surprised to see this King?”

Yang Kai replied with a snort, “What’s there to be surprised about? Had you not been spoiling and protecting her, with your daughter’s temper and ability to cause trouble, how could she survive till today? Without such sheltering, you wouldn’t even know how she died.”

Since the opposite party wasn’t polite towards him, Yang Kai didn’t bother to give him face. In any case, he was in the right now, so Yang Kai didn’t believe that the opposite party could bully him.

Feng Xi’s father, Feng Xuan might forcefully stand up for his son, paying no attention to his face, but the opposite party couldn’t do this as he still had to have qualms regarding his identity. And precisely because of this, Yang Kai wasn’t afraid at all.

Lin’er glanced at Yang Kai in astonishment. She had never thought that Yang Kai would have such guts that he could say such things right in her father’s face. Not just anyone could do this.

[Why did I provoke this kind of crazy person?] Lin’er was deeply regretting it now.

Old Fu’s face turned grim as he doubtfully asked, “Little brat, are you accusing this King of being too lax in his discipline?”

Yang Kai snorted and ignored him. What was the point of asking this when he clearly knew the answer already?

Seeing his indifferent appearance, Old Fu was also taken aback and immediately asked, “Aren’t you afraid of this King?”

Yang Kai gave him a sidelong glance and stated, “Why should I be afraid?”

Had it been before his trip to the Shattered Star Sea, Yang Kai might have still been frightened, but he was far more experienced now and had even met the Bustling World Great Emperor and the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. He already had an extremely rich experience.

“Do you know who this King is?” Old Fu asked again.

Yang Kai remained indifferent for a while before he cupped his fists and greeted, “Junior Yang Kai greets Senior Serene Soul!”

He didn’t greet him out of fear, but rather he was showing his respect towards a Master.

Old Fu was really shocked by this, but that couldn’t be helped as Yang Kai had actually known his identity. It was quite evident that Yang Kai knew who he was dealing with and what his status was.

As Yang Kai had just said, the Soul Manifestation before him belonged to one of the Ten Great Emperors of the Star Boundary, the Serene Soul Great Emperor; the hegemon of the Eastern Territory and founder of the Serene Soul Palace.

The Soul Contracts that widely circulated throughout the Star Boundary were this Master’s personal creation.

Yang Kai could guess all this because of the attitude the Netherworld Sect disciples had towards Lin’er. The Netherworld Sect was a top Sect of the Eastern Territory, so if Lin’er’s status wasn’t nobler than theirs, why would they treat her so politely?

Who could have a higher status than a top disciple and Elder from the Netherworld Sect?

It wasn’t that strange to make the connections.

“How did you know?” Old Fu furrowed his brow.

Yang Kai grinned meaningfully and stated, “I made a guess.”

Old Fu’s eyes glimmered but he didn’t pursue it, pondering for a moment before asking, “Since you know about Lin’er’s background, how dare you try to kill her? Could it be… That your purpose was to draw this King out?”

[Seems this old man does have some brains at least…]

After having his intentions revealed, Yang Kai didn’t bother playing dumb and cupped his fists and stated, “Sir’s vision is truly sharp. Junior did have such intentions.”

Of course, if he didn’t show up, Yang Kai would have really silenced all the witnesses. Lin’er had provoked him many times already. More importantly, her interference had almost gotten him killed, so Yang Kai couldn’t assume that this had never happened.

Old Fu curiously asked, “What do you get by drawing out this King?”

Yang Kai sighed and replied with a pained look on his face, “Sir, Junior had no choice as well. I was forced by your daughter.”

“How is this related to me!?” Lin’er was now calmer than before. With her father here now, she wasn’t worried for her life. What she was rather worried about was how long she would be grounded for this time.

Yang Kai glanced at her and angrily responded, “If you didn’t have an astonishing background, do you think you would still be alive to be able to speak right now?”

Lin’er let out a snort. She was too lazy to argue with him, but when she recalled how Yang Kai slashed at her without a shred of hesitation, she was gripped with lingering fear and knew that Yang Kai was right. Without her father’s protection, she would indeed be dead.

Yang Kai cupped his fists and continued, wearing a sad face, “Senior Serene Soul, your daughter has made things difficult for me over and over again. This Junior had no intention of haggling over such matters though, as with this little girl’s background, a little mischief is justified. Junior let her indiscretion pass several times, but not only did she not appreciate it, she colluded with the Netherworld Sect to set an ambush for me, an unforgivable act! With no other choice, Junior was forced to slaughter twenty Netherworld Sect members right here…”

Old Fu raised his brow and looked around. He had already noticed the corpses littered on the ground before, but he hadn’t expected these guys to be from the Netherworld Sect.

[Is this brat really so impressive? He is just a First-Order Emperor, how did he kill so many by himself?]

Yang Kai continued, “The death of the Netherworld Sect’s members isn’t worth pitying, but this Junior doesn’t dare to make rash moves against your daughter!”

“You… You are lying!” Lin’er angrily pointed at Yang Kai and shouted, “You clearly wanted to kill me!”

Yang Kai sneered and stated, “If I didn’t threaten your life, how would I draw Sir out!?”

Old Fu asked, looking at Yang Kai with narrowed eyes, “What do you want by drawing out this King?”

Yang Kai was taken aback but still promptly responded, “Sir, I don’t dare to kill your daughter, but I have to vent my anger one way or another, don’t I? Naturally, I can only ask you to settle it. Who asked my fists to not be bigger than yours?”

Old Fu softly sneered.

[So, you think that it’s okay for me to be bullied, right?] Yang Kai’s heart burned with fury and immediately continued, “Sir, I almost lost my life because of your daughter. Look at this wound, it burns even now.”

Old Fu gazed down at the half-meter long scar on Yang Kai’s chest and was indeed shaken a little.

[This brat really is one of a kind, speaking so boldly with me even after suffering such a serious wound while maintaining a straight face! Isn’t he afraid that I will crush him into nothing with just a wave of my hand?]

“This King understands! How do you want this King to settle this?” Old Fu gazed at Yang Kai, maintaining a calm and composed look, “Since I am here now. Just say what’s in your mind. If you don’t say it right now, you won’t get another chance again.”

Yang Kai’s face sank as he asked, “Sir, are you thinking of silencing me? Sir, if a man of your status does something like this, how will you keep your face if the word ever got out?”

Old Fu replied, “Whatever your motive was, it is a fact that you wanted to kill this King’s daughter. What does it matter if this King kills you?”

Yang Kai immediately blew his top and lashed out in anger, “Sir, are you really going to do this? Relying on your own status and strength to bully me?”

This old fart was simply too shameless! As one of the Ten Great Emperors, he was someone of great prestige. How could he do something so deplorable?

Lin’er, on the other hand, was excited and immediately shouted, “Father, there is no need to talk nonsense with him. Quickly kill him!”

Old Fu coldly smiled and asked, gazing at Yang Kai, “Are you afraid now?”

Yang Kai grit his teeth and stated, “What have I to be afraid of? This Young Master has fought shoulder to shoulder with the Bustling World Great Emperor, it’s not like I have never seen the power of a Great Emperor! This Young Master is also an experienced person. What’s there to be afraid of?”

Once he mentioned this, a strange look immediately appeared on Old Fu’s face as he asked, “You have fought shoulder to shoulder with Old Hong Chen?”

“That’s right!” Yang Kai snorted before continuing, “Sir, if you really came in person, this Junior would naturally flee right away, but with just a wisp of Sir’s Soul having manifested here, how much of your strength can you display? Forgive this Junior for being blunt, but if forced to, this Junior can drag your daughter down with me before he dies! I wonder if Sir cares about your daughter’s life or not!?”
