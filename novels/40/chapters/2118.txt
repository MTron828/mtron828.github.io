The next day, Yang Kai visited the Qin family early in the morning.

Qin Zhao Yang had already made adequate preparations and he was glad to see that Yang Kai had arrived as promised. He greeted him, “Little Brother Yang, I have something to pass to you before leaving.”

“What is it?” Yang Kai asked.

Qin Zhao Yang gestured lightly at Qin Yu, who was waiting next to him respectfully, and she walked slowly to Yang Kai with a wooden box in her hands and showed him a faint smile.

Yang Kai cast a glance at the wooden box. This was a four-foot-long rectangular box crafted out of exceptional materials and decorated with mysterious designs.

As for the inside of the box, it was emitting unusual energy ripples.

“Huh?” Yang Kai furrowed his brows. He had detected that the object inside the wooden box was anything but simple.

Yang Kai cast a glance at Qin Zhao Yang and the latter only nodded at him, asking him to open the box and take a look at it.

Yang Kai didn’t hesitate and he stretched his hand toward the wooden box and opened its lid.

Sword light emanated out of the box, a sword light so dazzling that Yang Kai had to squint his eyes. But shortly after, he got a clear look at the object inside the box and he said in surprise, “This is...”

As he spoke, he stretched his hand into the box and took a long sword out of it then said, “An Emperor Artifact?”

This was a three-foot-long sword with a heavy three-inch-wide blade. Both sides of the blade were crystal clear, while one little word was carved on the hilt of the sword.

“The Myriads Sword!”

“Once the sword makes a move, it can obstruct the way of myriads of men. This is the Myriads Sword left by our Qin family’s ancestor,” Qin Zhao Yang explained with a solemn look on his face.

Yang Kai raised his brows. “Myriads Sword? What a bold name!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

As he spoke, he raised the sword and infused it with his Source Qi. The sword let out a humming noise and its blade started shivering.

It looked like a heroic spirit, which had been asleep for innumerable years, was finally awakened again. The sword blade emitted a bright halo and a sizzling Sword Qi.

Upon seeing this, Qin Zhao Yang’s pupils contracted. He couldn’t help but say out of frustration and shock, “Little Brother Yang, your power is really far above mine. You didn’t even refine it, yet you could still release such great power out of the sword.”

This was an Emperor Artifact, and even though it had been asleep for innumerable years, it still couldn’t be used by an ordinary Dao Source Realm Cultivator. Even if Qin Zhao Yang had infused it with his whole Source Qi, it might not show any response.

But, what surprised Qin Zhao Yang more was that Yang Kai didn’t show any surprise and excitement upon learning that it was an Emperor Artifact, as if this was only an ordinary artifact in his eyes.

“Brother Qin, what do you mean by this?” Yang Kai tried several moves with the sword in his hand then turned his head to look at Qin Zhao Yang.

Qin Zhao Yang said with a smile, “If you want a horse to run, then you’ll have to feed it grass...”

Qin Zhao Yang couldn’t finish his statement, as he quickly found himself face to face with Qin Yu’s infuriated glare.

“It’s a slip, a slip of the tongue.” An embarrassed look appeared on Qin Zhao Yang’s face and he said solemnly, “Little Brother Yang, take this sword and use it to protect yourself. The Four Seasons Realm isn’t a... safe place.”

Yang Kai said, “Brother Qin, aren’t you afraid I’ll just run away with it?”

Qin Yu next to them then spoke up, “Senior Yang, if you were to do so, then it’ll still be its glory. This sword has been passed through many generations of our Qin family and it has been buried for so long. It probably wants to find a better Master, carry out a new journey and display its magnificent power.”

Yang Kai cast a glance at her. [This little girl is so shrewd and has a way with words.]

After hearing Qin Yu’s statement, even if he planned to run away with it, he would still be too embarrassed to carry it out. But in any case, he didn’t really plan to take it for himself in the first place.

Emperor Artifacts were very rare, but Yang Kai wasn’t short of them and he had more than just one...

Yang Kai mulled this over for a moment then said, “I’ll take the Myriads Sword for now and I’ll return it to your Qin family after leaving the Four Seasons Realm.”

Qin Yu curled her mouth into a smile and passed over a jade slip to Yang Kai. She said, “Senior Yang, this is the Myriads Sword’s refining method passed down by our ancestor. It’ll probably be useful to you.”

Yang Kai received it and nodded. He didn’t bother with observing it carefully and he just threw it into his Space Ring along with the Myriads Sword.

“Then... let’s leave,” Qin Zhao Yang waved his hand and spoke.

Yang Kai nodded and walked outside along with him.

“Senior Yang....” Qin Yu’s shout echoed out behind them. She said, “Nothing is more important than your safety.”

Yang Kai didn’t bother with turning his head around and he just waved his hand at her.

...

After they left Maplewood City, Yang Kai took out the Ship Artifact he got from the Flying Saint Palace and got into it along with Qin Zhao Yang, then he manoeuvred it and flew away.

Originally, Maplewood City had a Space Array, but it had been destroyed by the Drunkard when the city got shrouded by Demon Qi and they couldn’t build another one by themselves in a short while. They could only notify the Star Soul Palace or other great sects and ask them to send people to build the array.

Yang Kai could obviously provide help, but he didn’t want to do so.

He was still quite weak and it wouldn’t be good for him if more people learned that he was proficient in Space Force.

The ship flew at a very high speed, while Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang took turns in driving the ship and adjusting its direction. This wasn’t really a hard task!

On the road, Qin Zhao Yang made use of their free time to inform Yang Kai of detailed information about the Four Seasons Realm, as well as some key things he must pay attention to, and Yang Kai had borne everything in mind.

According to what Qin Zhao Yang had said, the Four Seasons Realm’s entrance was located in a valley within the Southern Territory and it would open up by itself every so often. Once it got opened, it would stay open for thirty days, and once this time had elapsed, all cultivators within the Sealed World would be expelled and teleported outside.

The Four Seasons Realm got its name from its strange environment. Its environment was divided into four areas corresponding to the four seasons. the verdant Realm of Spring, the Realm of Summer with its blazing sun, the Autumn Realm known for its cool breeze, and the Winter Realm covered by snow.

Many precious treasures and herbs rarely seen in the Star Boundary were present in the Four Seasons Realm, and there were even some special opportunities in it. Once the elite disciples of great sects entered the Four Seasons Realm, they could choose to enter and search a specific realm based on their necessities and the methods cultivated by them.

As for the Tribulation Fruit sought by Yang Kai, it was present in the Winter Realm. Only the Winder Realm’s cold environment satisfied this spirit fruit’s growth conditions.

The opening of the Four Seasons Realm wasn’t just a chance for the Southern Territory’s sects to collect rare resources, and it was also a chance for them to compete against each other. This was why they allowed the disciples to fight and kill each other, and they used this trial to test the disciples’ cultivation attainments.

The great sects would send their top disciples into the realm precisely for this reason. Every trip there would be an intense and violent competition and the casualties would always cross four-tenths of the participants. The stronger one was, the least likely they were to die.

Qin Zhao Yang wasn’t a member of a great sect and he also hadn’t ever entered the Four Seasons Realm. He learned everything he knew about it from information collected by Qin Yu from various books or word of mouth.

This was why, once Yang Kai entered the realm for real, it would be up to him to determine the most appropriate course of action.

The trip had been safe and uneventful!

Other than chatting with Qin Zhao Yang, Yang Kai didn’t do anything else other than studying the jade slip about the Myriads Sword’s refining method, and he learned a lot from it.

He had many of Emperor Artifacts in hand, but the Myriad was a Sword Artifact, a Sword Artifact at the Emperor Grade, and he might get some interesting insights through studying its refining method

...

After five days, the ship flew over a piece of wilderness.

Yang Kai who was sitting in one of the ship’s rooms and refining the Myriads Sword suddenly detected something and his heart skipped a beat. His eyes suddenly snapped open and he gazed with rapt attention at the void.

Soon after, Qin Zhao Yang had also discovered something and he stopped the ship in the air, then yelled, “May I ask who you are and why are you obstructing our path?”

After his voice fell, Yang Kai jumped from the ship’s rear and looked ahead. A scarlet silhouette was standing three hundred meters from the ship with her back facing them.

The silhouette was covered by blazing flames and her face was hidden from view, but from her curvaceous body and plump butt, it could be seen that it was a woman.

“What happened?” Yang Kai asked in a low voice.

Qin Zhao Yang shook his head and said, “This woman suddenly appeared in front of us and I don’t know if she had always been here or if she...”

“She’s so unfathomable...” Yang Kai’s expression changed after he swept the woman with his Divine Sense.

His Divine Sense couldn’t see anything there, and if he wasn’t seeing her with his naked eye, then he wouldn’t have noticed the red-robed woman.

“Is she... at the Emperor Realm?” Qin Zhao Yang cried in alarm, while a chill ran down his spine.

“She’s no ordinary Emperor Realm Master.” Yang Kai couldn’t help but swallow his saliva.

When he had been possessed by the Demon Sense, he fought against three First-Order Emperor Realm Masters, and he had some understanding of their power. He could clearly feel that those three Emperor Realm Masters wouldn’t be a match for the woman even if they joined hands.

In other words, the woman was at least a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master or more. She was most likely a... Third-Order Emperor Realm Master.

As this thought ran across Yang Kai’s mind, his heart sank.

No matter why the woman was standing in front of them, if they ended up incurring her wrath, then they would both die here.

“Yang, Little Brother Yang... Do you know her?”

“How the hell would I know her?” Yang Kai’s mouth twitched.

Yang Kai gave this some thoughts then shouted, “Senior, may I ask for your name? Why are you obstructing our path?”

After his shout, the woman slowly turned around and showed them a side of her face.

She had a delicate nose, rosy lips, and pretty facial features, as well as long hair and a curvaceous body. She had a plump chest and delicate snow-white skin, as well as a pair of watery eyes.

Upon facing the woman’s gaze, even Qin Zhao Yang fell into a daze and got mesmerized by her beauty.

“You’re really so slow,” the woman mumbled, but despite Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang’s high cultivation base, as well as their acute hearing, they still couldn’t hear the woman’s voice. She must have used some mysterious power to achieve this feat!

After she spoke, the woman curled the corners of her mouth and looked at the ship with a fake smile.

Yang Kai’s body suddenly stiffened.

He felt like the woman’s gaze had penetrated the void and all obstructions of the ship in its way and fell upon his body directly. He got alerted and he used his Source Qi, getting ready for any conflicts, while he also started pondering over this. [When did I meet this woman and how did I offend her?]
