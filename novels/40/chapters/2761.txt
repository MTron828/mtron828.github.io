The Violet Source Chamber of Commerce was one of the two top chambers of commerce in the Southern Territory, and they were in cooperation with many Sects in the territory when it came to business. If they really offended them, then it would not have any benefits to their Sects.

“This Old Master offers 21 million! Boy, up the bid if you have the guts!” The old man in one of the private rooms coldly snorted, seemingly convinced that Yang Kai was a hired troublemaker.

“30 million!”

The old man almost spat out a mouthful of blood when he heard this, and his face turned extremely ugly.

He originally thought that, since Yang Kai was hired to raise the price during the auction, then his task would have been completed after raising the price by 10 million. Even though it aggravated him so much that it made his teeth itch, being able to buy the Artifact Armor for 21 million was still a good bargain.

But he didn’t expect that little brat from Room A3 to raise the price to 30 million in one breath.

He wasn’t working for them! There was no way he was a hired plant as no one would be hired to make such ridiculous bids, and it was also impossible for them to make such irrational bids. If they were to hike up the price as madly as this, it would most likely scare most of the prospective bidders away.

That was to say, this little brat really intended to get his hands on the Great Soaring Black Dragon Armor.

This old man was not the only one who realized this; most of the Emperor Realm Masters at the auction realized this as well.

That person in Room A3 was definitely a man with a lot of money.

“31 million!” Only ten breaths later did someone make a bid with much difficulty.

“35 million!” Yang Kai immediately followed.

A sigh soon came from one of the private rooms, followed by many others soon after, but nobody raised the bid.

A normal Emperor Artifact could basically sell for around 15 to 20 million High-Rank Source Crystals. If it was a defensive Emperor Artifact, that number could go even higher, to around 20 to 30 million. Even though this Great Soaring Black Dragon Armor was an Emperor Grade Mid-Rank defensive artifact, it was damaged, so its price hovered between Emperor Grade Low-Rank and Emperor Grade Mid-Rank defensive artifacts.

35 million was already the bottom line for most.

Moreover, such an enormous amount of Source Crystals could not be taken out by just anyone.

At the auction in Flowing Shadow City a few months ago, most of the Emperor Realm Masters who attended only had a net worth of around 10 to 20 million. Rarely would any of them have 30 million High-Rank Source Crystals or more.

That was why Yang Kai was almost certain that this 35 million bid was going to be enough to seal the deal.

And so it was.

The beautiful auctioneer looked around for a moment, and once she was certain nobody would bid anymore, so she shouted at once, “Great Soaring Black Dragon Armor, 35 million High-Rank Source Crystals! Are there any higher bids? If not, then this armour will belong to our friend in Room A3.”

After counting to three, the beautiful woman smiled in Yang Kai’s direction, “Congratulations to our friend in Room A3!”

She couldn’t help but get a strange feeling welling up inside of her. This finale should have been a hard-fought battle between the Emperor Realm Masters, with many competing bids called one after another until ultimately the dust settled and one victor emerged. She never anticipated that this man from Room A3 would settle things so decisively, winning the auction in just a few rounds.

Most of the attendees who were thinking of bidding didn’t even manage to make a single offer. The only thing they got out of it was the show.

Even after hosting so many auctions, it was the first time she had encountered a situation like this. The man from Room A3 was truly a big patron. If she had the chance, she wanted to get to know him and perhaps even secure an opportunity to work with him.

With the dust of the final item settled, the auction came to an end. The cultivators in the hall all got up and headed out, still feeling a little dazzled. The Emperor Realm Masters in the private rooms were also led out of the rooms by the maidservants, leaving through secret passages.

In Room A3, Yang Kai waited quietly for a moment before a knock sounded at the door.

Yang Kai responded to the knock, and the door was immediately pushed open. A maidservant entered with two strong men who were carrying that metal storage box inside. A short while later, after the goods and payment were exchanged, someone else guided Yang Kai towards his private secret exit.

This was one way in which the auction house protected their customers in order to prevent any auctioned goods from being targeted by others. The Violet Source Chamber of Commerce built hundreds of secret passages leading in all directions out of Maplewood City. Without knowing the direction beforehand, no one could track a particular patron.

Even though Yang Kai wasn’t afraid in the first place, he didn’t refuse this arrangement.

Very soon, under the guide of the maidservant, they entered an underground tunnel.

Outside Room A9, Gu Hong knocked on the door and was allowed inside.

Le Dong Zheng, who was resting in the room, opened his eyes. A flicker passed across his eyes as his lips opened and closed, silently transmitting a question to Gu Hong.

Gu Hong couldn’t hide the excitement on his face and quickly responded.

Le Dong Zheng then got up, and with a flick of his sleeves, left quickly.

Gu Hong stood in place and pondered for a moment, but he still decided to sneakily follow him out. He knew Le Dong Zheng’s nature too well. For that Yang Kai guy to actually be so rich was something he did not expect before. If Le Dong Zheng really succeeded, then he did not believe that he would keep his promise to share fifty percent of the profit with him.

That was why it would be better for him to keep an eye on them himself. Once Le Dong Zheng succeeded, he would go over and catch him. He believed then that it would be difficult for him to deny him anything on the spot.

This was a matter concerning tens of millions of High-Rank Source Crystals, so how could Gu Hong not be careful? If this deal went well, then he wouldn’t have to compete with Kang Si Ran for anything anymore. He could just go wherever he pleased, living out the rest of his life without worries.

It was a cup of tea’s time later that Yang Kai and Qin Yu finally came out from the side of a small hill.

When they looked up, they could see the bright moon and the stars.

After finding his bearings, Yang Kai released his Emperor Qi, wrapping it around Qin Yu, before leaving in a certain direction.

In just a few moments, the two arrived above a small knoll. Looking down, they could see many people gathered below. Seemingly having sensed them approaching, those people looked up, wary expressions forming on their faces when they saw a stream of light shooting towards them.

“Grandpa!” Qin Yu shouted.

When Qin Zhao Yang heard her, he let out a relaxed laugh and shouted, “No need to worry, it’s just Little Brother Yang and Yu’er.”

The stream of light landed in front of the crowd, revealing the figures of Yang Kai and Qin Yu.

Looking over the crowd, Yang Kai asked, “Is everyone here?”

Before going to the auction, he sent a message to the Zhang Family, telling them to meet up with the Qin Family here. Looking at them now, no one seemed to be missing.

Old Lady Zhang said, “Everyone from the Zhang Family is here.”

The Zhang Family did not have many people to begin with, and they had also just about gotten everything prepared in the days before, so when they received Yang Kai’s message, they were able to move at once. The Qin Family was also in the same situation. Qin Zhao Yang had even managed to sell off the land deed. Now, both families were all gathered here.

Together, the two small families numbered around a hundred and fifty people with a wide variety of cultivations. The strongest one here was Qin Yu at the mere Second-Order Dao Source Realm. The others were either Origin King Realm, Origin Returning Realm, or even Saint King Realm and Saint Realm.

“Brother-in-law, are we really going to the Northern Territory?” Zhang Ruo Yu jumped out, her small face filled with tension and anticipation.

She hadn’t even travelled outside Maplewood City’s boundaries, despite how old she was, but now she would be going to the extremely far Northern Territory. As a native of the Southern Territory, she was extremely unfamiliar with the Northern Territory.

“Brother-in-law?” Qin Yu was stunned, feeling both confusion and anxiety.

“Who’s your brother-in-law? Don’t just shout randomly, little girl!” Yang Kai’s face went black.

Ning Su Wan also shouted, “Ruo Yu! Come back.”

“Oh,” Zhang Ruo Yu pouted and stood sullenly to the side. When she looked up, she suddenly met Qin Yu’s eyes. She grinned at her, revealing a bright, happy smile as she called out, “Elder Sister Qin!”

Qin Yu squeezed out a smile at her, “Little Sister Ruo Yu.”

“Since you’re all here, let’s go,” Yang Kai called out to them. If he were going alone, then he would be able to reach Thousand Leaves Sect in just two days, but since he had to bring along such a large group of people with varied strengths, he estimated that it would take them at least half a month to arrive.

As soon as he said that though, Yang Kai frowned. Sensing something coming from behind, he turned around just to see a stream of light speeding through the sky, and it seemed to be moving towards them.

Qin Zhao Yang, Ning Su Wan, and the others clearly noticed it as well, and they all instantly became nervous, especially Qin Zhao Yang. After all, Yang Kai had just offended one of Star Soul Palace’s disciples the other day, so if one of their Masters were to come after them, then the Qin Family would be done for.

“You should all go on ahead. I’ll be right behind you.” Yang Kai had already recognized who was coming when he released his Divine Sense, so after telling the Qin and Zhang Family to leave first, he turned around and waited.

“Which way do we go?” Qin Zhao Yang asked.

Yang Kai pointed in a direction.

“Be careful, Little Brother Yang,” Qin Zhao Yang said out of concern, and after a nod to Ning Su Wan, the two immediately led their clansmen forward.

If they stayed here, then they would only become a drag on Yang Kai, so the two of them made a quick decision to leave.

In the blink of an eye, the hundred and fifty people gradually moved further and further away.

A few moments later, the stream of light landed. Light fading away, an elderly man’s figure was revealed.

“Sect Master Le, where are you going in such a hurry?” Yang Kai smiled at Le Dong Zheng who had come chasing after him. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

A cold glint flashed past Le Dong Zheng’s eyes and he snorted, “You already know the answer.”

Looking towards the two clans walking away in the distance, Le Dong Zheng asked, “Are those all your people?”

“Indeed!” Yang Kai nodded.

Le Dong Zheng sneered, “Very good. None of them will be able to escape. This Old Master will slaughter them all!”

Yang Kai smiled in response, “That will depend on whether you can live that long.”

Le Dong Zheng narrowed his eyes, “You talk big, little brat. You think you can win against this Old Master?”

Even if Yang Kai’s cultivation level was similar to his, Le Dong Zheng still didn’t put him in his eyes. They were both First-Order Emperors, but he had been immersed in this realm for a long time, so how could some insignificant unknown person be able to compare to him?

“You really are a frog in a well, aren’t you!” Yang Kai snickered.

“Impudence!” Le Dong Zheng fumed at his words.

But as he spoke, Yang Kai who was originally several dozen metres away suddenly appeared in front of him, his face almost sticking to his. The distance between them had instantaneously shrunk to an arm’s length!

Le Dong Zheng gasped, so shocked that all his hairs stood on end.

He didn’t even notice how Yang Kai moved before this young man was already in front of him.

Those eyes that were right in front of him were filled with disdain and mockery, causing Le Dong Zheng’s heart to sink straight down into the abyss.

He pushed his Emperor Qi out of instinct and moved his feet, trying to open some distance between him and Yang Kai, but Le Dong Zheng was shocked to find that no matter how he moved, Yang Kai would stick to him like maggots on rotting bones, not allowing him to get away.

Casually throwing out his palm towards Le Dong Zheng’s chest, the mocking look in Yang Kai’s eyes morphed into coldness as he snorted, “Die!”
