“Shit!” Yang Kai couldn’t help cursing as his bad mood only got worse.

Since he entered the Starlight Corridor, he seemed to only run into one disaster after another.

First, he had met Yin Le Sheng who had attacked and tried to rob him, then he met Senior Brother Kou who had captured him and brought him back to Blue Feather Sect for no reason. After that, he met Yan Xiu Ran who wanted to steal his artifacts in front of the Bone Prison, and finally, he met this tall, brawny man...

Yang Kai suddenly discovered that, up until now, the Star Boundary was only filled with unpleasant memories.

Were all people from the Star Boundary so cruel and aggressive? Or did he just have terrible luck?

Regardless of the reason, Yang Kai’s patience had run out.

After all these repeated misfortunes, the anger in his heart had become like a raging torrent, just waiting to erupt.

This Zong Qi’s shameless provocation was like a fuse that set off all the rage Yang Kai had been building up.

So after hearing Zong Qi’s threats, Yang Kai not only wasn’t afraid, he instead grinned with interest, “If I understand what you mean, it doesn’t seem to matter if people die here, right?”

Zong Qi sneered, “This is Blue Feather Sect’s Bone Prison. What does it matter how many people die in here?”

“Understood,” Yang Kai gently nodded before suddenly raising his head and grinning fiercely, “Then it seems you’re quite unlucky!”

As soon as his voice fell, he rushed in front of Zong Qi in a single bound and threw out a punch.

This punch seemed to contain all the anger and dissatisfaction Yang Kai had pent up until this point, his rage soaring to the Heavens as his fist flew as fast as lightning.

Zong Qi was extremely proud of his burly stature and his great attainments in Body Tempering, so he did not put Yang Kai’s attacks in his eyes at all, simply sneering as he mocked, “Interesting, someone dares to provoke this Zong. I’ll crush every bone in your body as punishment!”

Saying so, he too threw out a punch to meet Yang Kai’s head-on.

When the two fists collided, the cold look on Yang Kai’s face turned into a sneer while the disdain on Zong Qi’s face rapidly changed to astonishment, then panic...

With a pitiful scream, Zong Qi’s towering figure was actually sent flying through the air as the crisp sound of the bones in his arm breaking rang out.

*Peng...*

Zong Qi hit the bone bars of the Bone Prison before falling to the ground heavily.

Before he could get up though, Yang Kai had already rushed out like a fierce tiger and mounted him before unleashing a storm of fists.

*Peng peng peng...*

Inside the Bone Prison, shockwaves from the continuous bombardment propagated, creating a war-drum-like rhythm that seemed to pound directly on people’s hearts.

Inside the Bone Prison cell, the three men who were expecting to see a good show had long gone dumbfounded, their eyes bulging as they stared at the sight in front of them in amazement.

Liu Xian Yun was also standing frozen on the spot, her heart filling with both shock as well as excitement.

This could not be helped though. In this kind of place, the stronger Yang Kai’s performance was, the safer she would be. Regardless of anything else, she was currently Yang Kai’s ally!

In the other cells, calls and shouts echoed about. The cultivators detained here were tortured year-round, which had either completely eroded their wills or stimulated their inner ferocity. Many enjoyed watching this kind of bloody fight as it gave them some entertainment in this gloomy, depressing hole.

*Peng peng peng...*

The muffled impacts continued to be heard as red blood splashed out, sometimes mixed with bits of broken bone and organs.

The commotion in the cell aroused the guards’ attention, and two Blue Feather Sect’s disciples soon came over to investigate. After they discovered that Yang Kai, the guy who had just been imprisoned, was making a display of his strength, these guards just stood by and watched with cold grins, not showing any intention to interfere. After entertaining themselves for a moment, the guards turned around and left.

Zong Qi was right about one thing: In this Blue Feather Sect Bone Prison, what did it matter if some people died? The Blue Feather Sect guards had no interest in stopping this.

As time passed, Zong Qi’s pitiful roars and howls began to fade, his curses and bravado giving way to pleas for mercy.

However, Yang Kai seemed to have devolved into a wild beast and ignored all of these cries.

Soon, Zong Qi’s groans were silenced altogether.

When Yang Kai stopped and stood up, what was left of Zong Qi lay in a puddle of bloody mud, most of his bones shattered beyond recognition, dead beyond any doubt.

Yang Kai shook off the blood staining his hands before letting out a long breath. He immediately felt refreshed as the depression in his heart was greatly lifted.

Yang Kai turned to the other three inside the cell next, causing all of them to scurry to the corner of the cell and stare back at him with clear terror filling their eyes, panicking as they worried Yang Kai would butcher them next.

They were well aware of Zong Qi’s abilities. Under the premise that everyone’s Qi was sealed inside this Bone Prison, whoever had the strongest physical body occupied the absolute advantage in a fight. All three of them had been subdued by Zong Qi previously, and even all together, they knew they were not his match.

However, this newcomer was actually able to overwhelm Zong Qi to the point where the latter couldn’t even fight back. It was easy to imagine just how powerful this boy’s body was!

There was good reason for them to be afraid.

Fortunately, Yang Kai did not seem interested in fighting anymore and simply walked to a corner of the cell and sat down cross-legged. This made the three breathe a sigh of relief, as if they had just escaped from the jaws of death.

Liu Xian Yun did not disturb Yang Kai either, realizing that his mood was still a bit unstable at the moment. Finding a place nearby, she also sat down cross-legged and began to recover her strength.

After some unknown length of time, the door of the cell was suddenly opened.

The two Blue Feather Sect guards who had shown up earlier entered the cell and with cold faces called out to Yang Kai, “Boy, get up!”

Yang Kai raised his eyes to look at them before slowly standing up.

Liu Xian Yun pulled on his clothes from behind, a worried look on her face.

Yang Kai just smiled slightly, “Don’t worry, I’ll be back in a while. They won’t dare to kill me.”

As long as that Protector Bian whom he had never met didn’t pass judgement on him, no one in Blue Feather Sect would dare to take extreme measures. Regarding this, Yang Kai felt he should thank Protector Bian.

After comforting Liu Xian Yun, Yang Kai turned his head to the three cowering men in the cell and grinned, “If you do not want to die, don’t make a fuss. If I come back and find that you hurt a single hair on my companion’s head, you know what the consequences will be.”

The three men had been deterred by Yang Kai’s ferocity long ago, not even daring to move Zong Qi’s mashed up corpse, which was lying nearby, so how could they dare have any improper thoughts now? All three of them kept nodding their heads like chicken pecking rice.

“Still dawdling? Do you want to die? Hurry up and get out here!” The guards at the door urged impatiently.

Yang Kai spat disdainfully before he walked out of the cell. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Once outside, the two guards swept their eyes over Yang Kai for a moment before one of them sneered and said, “I heard that you made Senior Brother Yan suffer a big loss?”

“Boy, you’re quite capable, killing Zong Qi the first day you arrived. He was a nasty one. For this alone, we brothers admire you a bit.”

“But, Senior Brother Yan said that we need to ‘take care’ of you well, so don’t blame us for what comes next. If you want to blame someone, blame yourself for having eyes but failing to see, provoking those who shouldn’t be provoked.”

From the way these two spoke, Yang Kai quickly understood the whole story.

As such, he did not bother responding and simply motioned for these two to lead the way.

The two guards glanced at each other and could not help but give Yang Kai a big thumbs up as they laughed deeply, “You’ve got guts!”

Soon, Yang Kai was taken to a dim cell, chained up, and tortured in various ways by the two Blue Feather Sect disciples.

It was not until half a day later that a half-dead Yang Kai was thrown back into his cell.

After seeing Yang Kai’s miserable appearance, Liu Xian Yun was deeply frightened, thinking that he would soon be dead. If Yang Kai died, she would become isolated and alone. In this kind of place, in that kind of condition, she didn’t even want to imagine what her fate would be.

However, contrary to her expectations, Yang Kai, who seemed to be on the verge of death, actually got into a cross-legged sitting position after an hour and entered a state of meditation.

By the next day, Yang Kai was once again as mighty as a dragon and fierce as a tiger. Although he looked quite dishevelled, his injuries seemed to be mostly healed, and even the scars on his body had mostly disappeared. Even the dried up blood had fallen off, revealing new, healthy-looking skin.

Liu Xian Yun found it even more difficult to see through Yang Kai as time passed and instinctively realized that he was absolutely hiding some unimaginable secrets...

This routine repeated itself for the next few days.

Yang Kai would endure the torture of the two Blue Feather Sect guards every day, then be thrown back into his cell half-dead, meditate, then restore himself.

What’s more, as time passed, Liu Xian Yun was shocked to discover that Yang Kai’s condition seemed to be changing little by little, his body actually becoming stronger and stronger. There seemed to be an unimaginable surging power coming from his frame, one that was being suppressed by some incredible force that was slowly being lifted.

In fact, this was not far from the truth!

The torture the two Blue Feather Sect guards administered to Yang Kai had actually caused the starlight he had absorbed in the Starlight Corridor to quickly merge into his physique, prompting the transformation of his Saint Qi into Source Qi.

He had absorbed an unimaginable amount of starlight in the Starlight Corridor, part of which was fused into his body, becoming a catalyst to transform his strength, but most of it had been stored away in his Knowledge Sea.

This was why, even as a Star Master, he did not give off any starlight glow.

Under normal circumstances, Yang Kai would need to slowly guide the starlight in his Knowledge Sea to integrate it into his body and promote the transformation of his Saint Qi.

But right now, his cultivation was sealed, so he was unable to complete this process on his own.

When the two Blue Feather Sect guards tortured him the first day though, Yang Kai quickly realized something.

When his physical body was damaged and then forced to repair itself, the stored starlight would actively rush out of his Knowledge Sea and pour into his physique, forcefully transforming his Saint Qi into Source Qi!

After discovering this, Yang Kai could not help feeling overjoyed.

As such, facing the repeated torture of the two guards, instead of feeling it unbearable, he was actually willing to do so, wishing they would torture him as mercilessly as possible to help speed up this process.

Silavin: Hmm... It seems he might have awakened something? Nah. It can’t be. Right?
