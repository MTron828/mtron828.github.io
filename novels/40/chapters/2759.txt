“170 million!” Yang Kai raised the price without even a change in his expression, amazing Qin Yu at the very sight.

“180 million!” The old man surnamed Zhou shouted.

“2 million!”

As soon as those words came out, the crowd was stunned and the old man surnamed Zhou let out a laugh, “Boy, is your mind muddled? 2 million…”

“High-Rank Source Crystals!” Yang Kai added.

The old man surnamed Zhou instantly choked on his mockery.

2 million High-Rank Source Crystals were equivalent in terms of pure energy to 200 million Mid-Rank Source Crystals, but in auctions like these, 200 million Mid-Rank Source Crystals couldn’t be used as a substitute for 2 million High-Rank Source Crystals. In other words, even though there was no theoretical difference between these 2 million High-Rank Source Crystals and 200 million Mid-Rank Source Crystals, the former had a far greater value than the latter.

The old man surnamed Zhou would have to pay in High-Rank Source Crystals if he wanted to raise the price again.

As such, he instantly fell silent.

With a charming smile on her face, the beautiful auctioneer gazed towards Yang Kai’s room and said, “2 million High-Rank Source Crystals from our friend in Room A3. Is there any higher bid?”

Naturally, no one raised the price.

It had to be known that the Twelfth-Order Low-Rank Monster Core that Yang Kai sold to Violet Source Chamber of Commerce was only worth 2 million High-Rank Source Crystals, so the worth of this Flowing Clouds Butterfly Hairpin was more or less the same as that of a Twelfth-Order Low-Rank Monster Core.

But this was not something that just anyone could get their hands on.

“Congratulations to our friend from Room A3!” The beautiful woman smiled. Though, she was filled with suspicion when she heard Yang Kai’s rather unfamiliar voice. She had no idea when such an important customer had arrived at their chamber of commerce. The A-Block Private Rooms were not available to ordinary cultivators, and from the fact that this unknown man could occupy a room as high up as Room A3, it was not hard to imagine that he must be a very distinguished guest.

Just after Yang Kai opened his mouth to bid, in another of the A Block Rooms, Le Dong Zheng’s eyes went cold.

He naturally recognized Yang Kai’s voice thanks to their previous interactions, so he was currently directing a hostile gaze towards the direction of Room A3, feeling a burst of anger welling up in his heart. He was already considered a big customer of Violet Source Chamber of Commerce, but even with his status, he could only sit in Room A9. What skill or ability did this youngster have in order to occupy Room A3?

After pondering for a short time, he spoke to the maidservant kneeling nearby, “Tell Manager Gu to come see me.”

“Yes!” The maidservant rose and walked out of the room.

A few moments later, Gu Hong knocked on the door and entered, cupping his fists, “Sect Master Le, what can this little one help your distinguished self with?”

Le Dong Zheng said, “The man from Room A3… What kind of person is he?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Gu Hong was stunned and answered with some difficulty, “Why does Sect Master Le ask? Sect Master Le should also know about the chamber of commerce’s rules. Even though this Gu is a Manager, he is in no way allowed to disclose information about our customers.”

Le Dong Zheng smiled, “There are always exceptions, are there not?”

Gu Hong answered, “That is somewhat difficult, Sect Master Le.”

Le Dong Zheng frowned. He had been doing business with Gu Hong for so many years, and they knew of each other’s natures, so he knew that this Gu Hong was no honourable man. Sighing, he spoke, “I’ll be frank with you. This Old Master has a grudge with that little brat.”

Gu Hong was curious, “What has he done to offend Sect Master Le?”

Le Dong Zheng coldly snorted, “It would be fine if he had just offended me, but three of my Third-Order Dao Source Realm disciples died at his hands. One of them even happened to be a descendant of this Old Master!”

“What?!” Gu Hong was shocked, thinking to himself it only made sense for Le Dong Zheng to inquire about this man’s information. It turned out there was a deep grudge between them.

Le Dong Zheng continued, “Manager Gu, you saw it yourself. That boy didn’t hesitate to make such an astonishing bid, so he must be extremely wealthy. If I can take him down, then I’m sure to get a handsome profit out of it. How about a thirty percent share for Manager Gu when the time comes?”

Gu Hong wore a bitter look on his face, “Sect Master Le, it’s not that this Gu is unwilling to help…”

“Fifty percent!”

“This, this…” Gu Hong pretended to think for a while before striking his thigh, “Sect Master Le, this Gu is not too clear about his origins, but he suddenly appeared yesterday in the branch. Prior to this, this Gu had never seen him…”

“It seems like Manager Gu is unwilling to help this Old Master with this favour. Fine. This Old Master won’t come to the Violet Source Chamber of Commerce to do business anymore in the future,” Le Dong Zheng coldly snorted.

Gu Hong smiled bitterly, “Sect Master Le, although I don’t know his origins, this Gu can inform Sect Master Le about his whereabouts and when he leaves the auction later.”

Le Dong Zheng’s eyes flickered as he nodded, “In that case, this Old Master will offer his gratitude to Manager Gu.”

Rubbing his hands, Gu Hong asked, “About the fifty percent that Sect Master Le mentioned before…”

“It will definitely be yours,” Le Dong Zheng waved his hand.

“Then many thanks to Sect Master Le. This Gu will wish for Sect Master Le’s absolute victory in battle!”

After leaving the room, a cold glint appeared in Gu Hong’s eyes, [Don’t blame me for this, boy, but you need to disappear for my future.]

After Yang Kai appeared yesterday, he clearly noticed that Branch President Lou Chi’s attitude towards him had grown much colder, and he had become more enthusiastic with Kang Si Ran. After remembering what happened when Yang Kai came to the branch, how could Gu Hong not realize that he must have negotiated a big deal with Kang Si Ran? What’s more, this deal most likely totalled to an unimaginable sum for such a dramatic shift in attitude to occur.

Only with that would he be able to help Kang Si Ran overturn his luck. If Kang Si Ran managed to turn his fortunes around, then Gu Hong would become the unfortunate one.

Someone had to be transferred away from this branch, and if Kang Si Ran remained, Gu Hong would definitely be transferred.

But if Yang Kai died, Kang Si Ran would lose his support, and then he naturally would have nothing more to fear.

In Room A3, a maidservant brought over the Flowing Clouds Butterfly Hairpin, and Yang Kai paid 2 million High-Rank Source Crystals before taking the jade hairpin in his hands and fiddling with it. Even though he hadn’t refined it, and could not appreciate the full capabilities of this Flowing Clouds Butterfly Hairpin, Yang Kai could tell that this jade hairpin had been crafted with utmost care and was a rare artifact.

On closer inspection, the monkey face on the side seemed even more vivid and lifelike.

After taking a careful look at it, Yang Kai tossed the jade hairpin towards Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was still recovering from her shock and caught it in a flustered manner, only to stare back at Yang Kai in astonishment.

“A small gift for you,” Yang Kai said. Then, he shut his eyes and continued to meditate.

“For me…?” Holding the jade hairpin in her hand, Qin Yu’s heart froze as if it had been struck by lightning and her cheeks burned up.

She was wondering just a moment ago which woman occupied such an important position in Yang Kai’s heart that he was willing to spend 2 million High-Rank Source Crystals to buy a mere hairpin for them, but now that hairpin suddenly landed in her hands.

[Did Big Brother Yang buy this for me?]

[Do I really occupy such an important position in his heart?]

Qin Yu couldn’t help but let her thoughts run wild as she looked timidly at Yang Kai, only to have the flames in her heart instantly doused with cold water. She could see that Yang Kai’s eyes were closed, as if what he just gave her was not a flight type artifact worth 2 million High-Rank Source Crystals, but a trinket he found in a street stall somewhere.

“Big Brother Yang, this is far too expensive…” Qin Yu calmed herself and quickly refused.

This hairpin was purchased for 2 million High-Rank Source Crystals, an enormous sum for her Qin Family. She and Yang Kai were neither kin nor lovers, so how could she accept such a heavy gift from him?

While saying that, she handed the jade hairpin back to him.

Yang Kai opened his eyes, “You really don’t want it?”

Qin Yu bit her lip and shook her head. This hairpin cost too much, she simply couldn’t accept it.

Yang Kai laughed, “If you don’t want it, there’s no use for me even if I take it back.”

Qin Yu lowered her head and muttered, “Big Brother Yang can give it to… a woman he likes. No matter who it is, I’m sure they’ll be happy.”

“But I’ve already given it to you first,” Yang Kai said.

“But I’m not…” Qin Yu’s voice grew even quieter.

Yang Kai told her, “I’ve been using your Qin Family’s Myriads Sword for so long, and it has aided me in many great battles. Just take this hairpin as my thank you gift to the Qin Family. You don’t have to let it trouble you.”

“It’s not the same,” Qin Yu shook her head. Why would someone gift a piece of jewellery to someone they were not close with? And a piece that was so valuable at that.

“Then I can only return the Myriads Sword to your Qin Family,” Yang Kai said with a serious face.

“Don’t!” Qin Yu quickly shook her head. Even though the Myriads Sword belonged to the Qin Family, it was a genuine Emperor Artifact, and there was no way the Qin Family would be capable of guarding it. It was fortunate that Qin Zhao Yang let Yang Kai take away the Myriads Sword back then, for if it really had remained in the Qin Family, it would have already brought them incredible danger.

Qin Yu was stunned, but somehow, she felt much more relaxed.

It seemed that the 2 million High-Rank Source Crystals, which was an enormous amount to the Qin Family, was nothing to Yang Kai. In other words, what he gave her was not considered something particularly valuable to him, but just a simple thank-you gift.

Thinking about it that way, Qin Yu felt a little relieved.

“Then… Thank you, Big Brother Yang.” Holding the jade hairpin in the palm of her hands, Qin Yu thanked him.

[This may just be a simple thank-you gift in your eyes, but to me, this is the most valuable gift I have ever received, and it has nothing to do with the price…]

The auction continued. After the shocking price the Flowing Clouds Butterfly Hairpin was able to sell for, the atmosphere had grown even more fervent. It seemed like everyone’s competitive spirit was stirred up, and the price of each item steadily climbed.

An hour later, the auction was drawing to a close.

After a short break, the beautiful auctioneer came back onto the stage and said with great enthusiasm, “The next item on the auction will be the finale of tonight… The Great Soaring Black Dragon Armor!”

As soon as she said that, she made a gesture with her hand and at once, two strong men walked out from backstage carrying a fine metal box, trudging step by step towards the auction stage, seemingly requiring arduous effort just to walk steadily.

In an instant, thousands of eyes were focused on the stage and the breaths of many suddenly quickened in the dark.

This Great Souring Black Dragon Armor had been announced by Violet Source Chamber of Commerce for this auction three months ago. It was also for that reason that many Emperor Realm Masters who had their eyes on this Great Soaring Black Dragon Armor attended the auction today. It was safe to say that this one piece of Artifact Armor was worth more than all the previous auction items added together.

*Hong…*

When the two strong men put the box on the ground, it issued a dull thud as it landed on the stage, as if this Great Soaring Black Dragon Armor was extremely heavy. Many people were astonished, but they all knew that as long as they were able to refine it, then even the heaviest of Artifact Armors would become as light as air. Otherwise, the weight alone would be enough to greatly diminish the value of the Great Soaring Black Dragon Armor.
