Although Xue Yue and Yang Kai had once embraced one another naked atop a Dead Star, that was in a barren place without an audience, so how could it compare to this public display of affection?

What’s more, seeing Yang Kai not resisting and letting this enchantress act as she pleased caused a deep rage to explode inside Xue Yue, her body trembling with anger as her knuckles whitened. As such, Xue Yue couldn’t bear it and loudly shouted to end this farce.

After shouting out like this though, Xue Yue also realized that her reaction had been a bit excessive so she quickly added some righteous sounding words, “Embracing each other in front of so many people, you really know no shame!”

As she spoke such accusations, she ground her teeth and glared at Yang Kai as if she wanted to slowly peel his skin.

“My, how frightening...” Shan Qing Luo patted her well twin peaks exaggeratedly, her relaxed expression slowly turning to one of anger as she cast a side-long glance towards Xue Yue before giggling and turning back to Yang Kai, exhaling an orchid scent as she whispered, “We’ll ‘talk’ more later.”

“Yeah!” Yang Kai nodded seriously as he felt relief in his heart. From what he saw, he could tell that Shan Qing Luo’s mood had calmed down after this little episode. However, after not seeing this enchantress for so many years, it was also clear that her innate charm had become even more astonishing. When she had been staring at him with such pitiful yet fiery eyes, Yang Kai nearly felt his soul get taken away by her.

After taking a moment to settle his mood, Yang Kai asked lightly, “Do you have some kind of grudge with them?”

“Not at all, it’s just... this androgynous boy and I are somewhat incompatible,” Shan Qing Luo chuckled, “Since you came here with Bi Luo, I assume you’ve heard my story, yes?”

“Indeed.”

“That’s good,” Shan Qing Luo giggled lightly before giving him a brief summary of her experiences in the Emperor Garden. It was a series of coincidences, starting with her vaguely perceiving that Yang Kai had also entered the Emperor Garden, then her searching for him, leading to her arriving at this deep part of the main palace. After discovering this Stone Monument, she had paused to study its mysteries, soon after which Xue Yue and her group had arrived.

Yang Kai and Bi Luo followed right afterwards though, so she and Xue Yue’s people hadn’t even had time to fight yet.

“This...” Yang Kai finished listening to her story and gently nodded while thinking to himself that since these two sides had no hatred between them, it shouldn’t be necessary to fight here. Considering all this, he turned to Xue Yue and grinned before proposing, “Third Young Master, as the saying goes, there’s no such thing as an irresolvable grudge. You and I meeting here can be considered a matter of fate, how about we let matters drop for today?”

“Good!” Unexpectedly, Xue Yue agreed immediately, causing Yang Kai to be stunned, but soon, his brow furrowed. Xue Yue being so accommodating here was extremely unusual, so Yang Kai couldn’t help thinking she was planning something.

Sure enough, Xue Yue stared at Yang Kai with a smile on her face and continued, “Out of consideration for our previous ‘friendship’, this Young Master won’t try to embarrass you so as to avoid others spreading rumours that my Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce uses its strength to bully the weak, but...”

“But what?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes.

“Don’t be so nervous,” Xue Yue chuckled as a smug look appeared on her face, “I have a simple request, I want one of you to come with me.”

“One of us?” Yang Kai’s complexion sank, “Who do you want?”

Yang Kai glanced over at Shan Qing Luo, subconsciously thinking Xue Yue wanted to vent her anger on this bewitching woman.

Everyone present had similar thoughts, including Shan Qing Luo herself; after all, she was quite clear on just how powerful her charms were. There had never been a man who could remain completely calm in front of her, so when she heard these words, she couldn’t help a smile from blossoming on her face as she let out a burst of pleasant laughter and said, “I apologize Young Master, but if you want me, then I’m afraid I must disappoint you. This Lady already has a precious man, who completely fills her heart, and after dozens of years, we have finally been reunited. So from now on, I refuse to be separated from him.”

Saying so, she stretched out her arms and linked them with Yang Kai’s, pressing her tender body up against his intimately.

A strange light flashed across Xue Yue’s eyes before she folded her arms and laughed, directing a sarcastic look at Shan Qing Luo before saying, “Enchantress, don’t try to put on a coy act in front of this Young Master. When did this Young Master say the one he wants is you? Your skin must truly be thick!”

She didn’t know why, but Xue Yue did not want to let go of any chance to ridicule Shan Qing Luo even though it would have been impossible for her to think this way just a moment ago.

“Uh...” Shan Qing Luo’s cultivation and mental fortitude were quite good, but even she couldn’t help blushing in embarrassment at this moment, asking in a somewhat awkward tone, “Then who do you want?”

As she said so, she glanced suspiciously towards Bi Luo, but the latter quickly waved her hands to indicate that she had never met Xue Yue before.

“The one this Young Master wants is the man beside you!” Xue Yue glared coldly towards Yang Kai, her mouth twitching slightly as she snapped shut her folding fan and pointed it at him, “If you stay, I won’t embarrass these two women, this Young Master lives up to his words!”

Everyone’s eyes turned towards Yang Kai, all of them wondering what kind of grievance there was between these two men to cause Xue Yue to abandon this beautiful flower-like beauty and instead choose to keep Yang Kai.

As long as one was a man, he obviously should have chosen to keep the woman.

It seemed this grudge was quite deep, probably on the same level as killing one’s father or taking one’s wife... The masters around Xue Yue thought this way, but were even more curious about when their Third Young Master formed such a grudge? Why hadn’t they heard anything about it before?

“You want me to stay?” Yang Kai’s expression became strange.

“You don’t dare?” Xue Yue held her white chin, her face filled with arrogance and aggressiveness. “Or, could you be afraid?”

“Nonsense, me? Afraid? I’ve not stolen from or shamed you in any way.”

“You dare say you haven’t stolen from or shamed me!?” Xue Yue instantly became agitated upon hearing these words, her brow tightly furrowing as she glared towards Yang Kai.

Realizing the meaning of what he just said, Yang Kai let out a hollow laugh as he faced Xue Yue across a distance of several dozen metres, not knowing what he should say next. Only after a long silence did he sigh and try to persuade, “Third Young Master, a forcefully picked melon is not sweet, why act like this? You can walk along the high road while I cross the low bridge, well water not mixing with river water, each of us living in peace with one another. If you insist on forcing the issue, it will only result in everyone suffering a loss and leaving unsatisfied.”

“Everyone suffering a loss?” Xue Yue seemed to have heard the world’s funniest joke and mockingly narrowed her eyes, “You think you’re qualified to say such words now?”

“Whether or not I’m qualified, you can try if you like,” Yang Kai smiled deviously, “Moreover, it’s just a matter of speaking a few words; do you think you can prevent me?”

Xue Yue’s complexion changed dramatically when she heard this and shouted, “You dare!”

She was an incredibly sharp and intelligent woman, so how could she not understand the threat in Yang Kai’s words. The other party’s words implied he was willing to reveal her greatest secret, so how could she not become nervous?

“Why wouldn’t I dare?” Yang Kai smiled smugly, “In any case, it won’t cost me anything, but Third Young Master, you... heh heh.”

His laughter was so meaningful that Xue Yue couldn’t help feeling terrified, “If you dare do that, you’ll certainly regret it!”

“Then everything depends on your attitude, Third Young Master,” Yang Kai said in a perfectly composed manner, as if victory was already within his grasp.

“I...” Xue Yue became speechless for a moment, her pretty face filling a cold gloominess. The many masters around her also could not help exchanging glances with one another, all feeling incredibly shocked by the situation. They all knew how fierce their Third Young Master’s methods were, but now he was being cornered so thoroughly by some unknown First-Order Origin Returning Realm boy’s words, as if the other party was just casually toying with him.

This had never happened before.

Just what kind of hold did this boy have on their Third Young Master that would make the latter so cautious about acting lest innocents be hurt? At that moment, the six Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters also became curious, all of them secretly hoping that Yang Kai would blurt out whatever this secret was so they could soothe their curiosity.

The Third Young Master was a perfect person in their minds, yet such a person apparently had a fatal weak point; others would become interested in such information.

Suddenly, the tense situation came to a stalemate, with Xue Yue’s mood fluctuating up and down.

This was the first time she had found herself unable to make a choice. She was completely unwilling to let Yang Kai and this enchantress leave here. Because of how Yang Kai had saved her life, she had not prevented him from leaving Rainfall Star, but afterwards, she had deeply regretted this choice.

She felt that no matter what method she used, she should have tied this boy to her and make him become her servant.

In this world, except for a few of her closest relatives, only he knew her secrets, so whether it was because of logic or emotion she didn’t want to let him out of her sight. What’s more, Xue Yue had complete confidence in her charms, so as long as they were together for long enough, how could she not make him fall for her? At that time, not only would the possibility of her secret being exposed disappear, but she could also firmly capture his body and mind, killing two birds with one stone.

So she didn’t want to let Yang Kai leave. If she missed this opportunity, she didn’t know when she would see this bastard again.

But facing Yang Kai’s blatant threat, Xue Yue didn’t dare to act lest she really forced him into a hopeless situation and he let out her secret in desperation.

Thoughts flashed like lightning across her mind, but soon, Xue Yue’s eyes lit up and she smiled lightly towards Yang Kai, “Don’t say things just to frighten me, you won’t do it.”

“Nonsense!” Yang Kai declared.

“Is it?” Xue Yue sneered, “Then go ahead, say it if you have the courage! However, the consequences that will happen afterwards, I hope you can live with them!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Xue Yue suddenly began acting like a rogue, even shooting a casual glance towards Shan Qing Luo as she spoke.

Yang Kai frowned slightly, and after pondering for a moment, his face sank.

He hadn’t considered what fallout would occur if he were to disclose Xue Yue’s secret here, but after being reminded by her, he understood. If he really talked, then Xue Yue would have no choice but to silence all the witnesses. In other words, Shan Qing Luo and Bi Luo would be regarded as targets to be killed and even the masters beside her might have to die!

After all, to keep such a secret, Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce wouldn’t care about the lives of a few Origin Returning Realm masters.

“Seems like you’ve become much more shameless in the several years I haven’t seen you!” Yang Kai quipped at Xue Yue sarcastically.

“You as well!” Xue Yue chuckled, “Don’t think you’re any better.”

“However, do you truly think this is enough to make me hesitate?” Yang Kai looked at her with a sneer, “You’re too naive.”
