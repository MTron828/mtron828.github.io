Before the Great King could investigate and understand what was happening, the space around the Blood Gate started distorting as a tall and stalwart figure appeared out of thin air.

The Great King was greatly taken aback. He and his seven compatriots had clearly blocked the area within ten kilometres of the Blood Gate, so not to mention a Human, not even a mosquito could enter this place without their knowledge. What’s more, the surrounding fifty-kilometre radius of the Blood Gate was being guarded by the thirty-two Monster Kings, so how did this person arrive here?

Furthermore, this aura clearly belonged to a Human!

This was outrageous!

The Great King was shocked and angry, hurriedly shouting aloud, “Bastard, how dare you trespass into the Restricted Area! Surrender your life!”

Just as he said this, Monster Qi exploded from his form and he pounced at Yang Kai, leaving a long afterimage behind him. While in the air, he palmed forward. This was the anger-fueled attack of a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, so its might was extraordinary.

Yang Kai, however, just stood in place, despite feeling like his bones were creaking. For the first time, he truly got to experience the terrifying power of a Master on par with a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master first-hand.

But he didn’t panic and just coldly watched as the Monster Race Master closed in, waiting until the critical moment to wave his hand before himself.

*Shua Shua Shua…*

Immediately after, the Stone Spirit Clan, led by the Elder, made an entrance like divine soldiers descending from the Heavens.

However, the Wood Spirit Clan was nowhere to be seen, confusing Yang Kai.

*Hou…*

Instantly, a furious roar resounded, shaking the Heavens and Earth. Xiao Xiao jumped out in one step as his child-like figure grew bigger with crackling sounds. All of sudden, he transformed into a dozen-metre-tall stone giant with his entire body covered in rock-solid armour that looked extremely hard and impenetrable, giving the impression that it would be able to defend against any attack.

The Heaven Shaking Pillar resting on his shoulder also became longer and thicker at the same time as it swept towards the oncoming Monster Race Great King.

Wind howled and the air crackled as the Heaven Shaking Pillar cut through the air with the momentum that shook the world around it.

The attacking Monster Race Great King was in a state of total confusion. Before, when he saw Yang Kai alone, he didn’t hesitate to attack. He wanted to kill Yang Kai to eliminate any future troubles, so how could he have known that so many stone giants would suddenly appear in the blink of an eye?

In a moment of surprise, he was completely unguarded and couldn’t react. Meanwhile, Xiao Xiao’s stick was already upon him.

The moment before the Monster Race Great King was about to get hit, he hurriedly stopped and promptly pushed his Monster Qi to form a defensive shield around his body. At the same time, he crossed his arms before his chest.

*Hong…*

As the Heaven Shaking Pillar struck him, the Monster Race Great King felt a force beyond his imagination impact him. His Monster Qi defence shattered and his arms fractured as his figure was sent flying.

He spurted a mouthful of blood as his figure flew back several thousand metres before he finally stabilized himself.

The might of Stone Spirit Clan was so terrifying and domineering that even a Monster Race Great King with the strength comparable to a peak Third-Order Emperor Realm Master was unable to take it head-on.

“Stone… Spirit!” The Monster Race Great King’s eyes instantly turned red. He might have suffered a loss, but it was only a minor injury, so it didn’t pose a major problem to his combat efficiency. On the contrary, it stimulated his murderous intent.

*Shua Shua Shua…*

One after another, figures flew over from all directions after hearing the commotion here, landing on either side of the Monster Race Great King. Including the previous Monster Race Great King, there were a total of eight figures.

They were the eight Great Kings of the four Divine Venerables.

These eight Monster Race Masters undoubtedly recognized the Stone Spirit Clan; after all, when the four Divine Venerables wanted to subdue the Stone Spirit Clan, they were the ones passing messages between them, so they had met each other more than once.

One of the Great Kings with a stocky and imposing build stared ahead as his pupils shrank, letting out a cold snort as he asked, “Elder, what’s the meaning of this?”

The Stone Spirit Clan was standing by the Blood Gate with the Elder in the lead, who pointed his cane and replied in a reverberating voice, “My clan’s future is here, and you are asking what this Elder is doing?”

The Great King’s gaze turned colder as he stated in a heavy voice, “Elder, don’t do this. You should know the consequences of angering the four Divine Venerables. The Stone Spirit Clan members are few in number. You don’t want your clan to be exterminated, do you?”

Elder chuckled and replied, stroking his stony beard, “My clansmen live thanks to the luck bestowed by the Heavens, so unless the Heavens themselves will it, others can forget about exterminating my clansmen. I’m afraid you don’t have such ability!”

Another Great King immediately rebuked, gritting his teeth, “We were ordered to guard this place and cannot permit anyone near it. Elder, are you trying to make things difficult for us?”

Elder indifferently stated, “It’s not like we can’t work things out. If you turn a blind eye to this, my Spirit Clan will definitely be grateful to you.”

“In your dreams!” The Great King who was injured first angrily yelled, “Since you have intruded upon the Blood Gate Restricted Area, today you will definitely die!”

Elder sighed before proposing, “The changes of the Blood Gate are a great opportunity for the Ancient Lands creatures to revive their ancestral glory. As long as we can break the Blood Gate seal and enter the Blood Gate, we will have the opportunity to obtain Divine Spirit Sources. Since you have been by the four Divine Venerables’ sides, you must also know about the secrets of the Blood Gate. Rather than opposing my clan, wouldn’t it be better if we teamed up and shared the Sources inside the Blood Gate? Wouldn’t that be wonderful?”

“I really didn’t know that Elder was so good with words. Today, you have opened this King’s eyes,” the injured Great King coldly snorted, a mocking look on his face.

Elder stated, “Today, my Stone Spirit Clan will display its full strength. We are going to have our hands on the Blood Gate for sure, no matter what. Anyone who dares to hinder our path will be killed without mercy! Friend, you’d best think things through.”

Just as he said this, the expression of the eight Great Kings immediately darkened.

In the past, when they had come in contact with the Elder, they felt that this old guy was withering away and it took great effort for him to even speak. This had made them look down on him, but today, his staunch stance and the murderous intent overflowing from him had taken them by surprise.

The burly Great King sighed and stated, “If Elder insists on doing this, I’m afraid I can only offend you.”

No one dared to underestimate the Stone Spirit Clan’s strength. If they really had to fight with these stone giants, they weren’t sure of their victory.

While the talk was going on, the Great King who was hit by Xiao Xiao’s stick and had suffered some injuries, suddenly had his expression change as he fiercely shouted, “Despicable Human, what the hell are you doing!?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Everyone was startled and turned their gazes towards the Human boy who had suddenly appeared at the very beginning. They saw his hands dancing wildly, constantly making mysterious seals. Moreover, the space around him was extremely distorted, giving the impression that it would collapse at any moment.

The eight Great Kings were extremely shocked by this sight and couldn’t fathom what mysterious ability this Human had mastered that was actually causing space to distort like this.

Yang Kai, without stopping, turned his head with a smile on his lips and stated, “I’m breaking the seal! It’s strange that Sir Great King is asking such an obvious question.”

“Outrageous!” The Great King’s face distorted in anger as he angrily shouted, “Stop right now or this King will tear you into a thousand pieces!”

Yang Kai let out a cold snort before retorting, “This Young Master’s act of breaking the seal is something beneficial for the future of the entire Ancient Lands, but instead of appreciating it, you actually want to kill me? Where is the logic in this?”

“Human, you are quite good at spurting nonsense! What gives you the right to intervene in the affairs of the Ancient Lands!?”

Elder intervened right then, “This Little Friend is the Honoured Guest of my Stone Spirit Clan. This Elder has asked him to break the seal.”

“You think a trivial First-Order Emperor Realm can crack the seal on the Blood Gate? What a joke!?”

Elder justified, “This Little Friend is proficient in the Dao of Space, while there is an independent small world beyond the Blood Gate. As long as Little Friend can tear the barrier between worlds, he can naturally open the seal.”

“The Dao of Space!?” The eight Great Kings were thoroughly shocked.

Elder continued, “Friends, there are many Divine Spirit Sources inside the Blood Gate, and all of you should be able to sense them resonating within your bloodlines. If Little Friend can really break the seal, it will be greatly beneficial for you too.”

The burly Great King stated, “It’s not like something cannot be arranged, but the Divine Venerables’ orders…”

Elder chuckled before adding, “The Divine Venerables aren’t here, are they? They are a few thousand kilometres away. They won’t notice.”

“The Divine Venerables aren’t here?!” The eight Great Kings were stunned and quickly turned their heads, looking in the direction the four Divine Venerables’ were previously located. Immediately after, they noticed that that place was completely empty.

In a flash, everyone couldn’t help but become a little eager.

No one wanted to be a subordinate forever. Although the eight Great Kings were loyal to the Divine Venerables, if they could make their own strength grow a step further, none of them would want to miss this opportunity.

[If we really allow this Human to tear the space barrier and open the Blood Gate, we might really be able to enter it and inherit the Divine Spirit Sources of our distant ancestors and attain the glorious strength they once possessed.]

[But… Who can say for certain that this Human will be capable of breaking the seal!? If he fails and the Divine Venerables learn we didn’t do everything in our power to stop him while they were away, we will certainly be blamed and punished.]

The eight Great Kings glanced at each other, seemingly able to guess each other’s thoughts.

The burly Great King stepped forward and indifferently stated, “Sorry, although Elder’s offer is tempting, the Divine Venerables’ order cannot be violated. Forgive me for offending you!”

Just as he said this, the eight Great Kings moved together, their figures flashing as they charged straight at the Stone Spirit Clan all of a sudden.

“Block them!” The Elder waved his cane and pointed forward.

Under his order, eight Stone Spirits apart from Xiao Xiao, from Shi Yi to Shi Ba (one to eight), jumped out one after another, each meeting a Great King head-on.

In an instant, Monster Qi surged in the vicinity of the Blood Gate. Bursts of Monster Qi swept outward as the Stone Spirits fought with the eight Great Kings, creating a Heaven shaking riot.

But very soon, the eight Stone Spirits fighting noticed something odd. The eight Great Kings weren’t displaying their complete strength, making it easy to block all of their attacks.

Although the Stone Spirits were lacking in intelligence, they weren’t that stupid; after all, after living so many thousands of years, how could they not know what the eight Great Kings were planning?

Everyone was secretly elated, but that did not stop their battle from causing the world to tremble. Very soon, the barren peak had rocks and dust flying everywhere, looking just like the scene of a heated battle.

Yang Kai had already guessed what was going on after seeing this and knew that the eight Great Kings had been tempted by Elder’s proposal. They were just pretending at this moment, that’s all, so that they wouldn’t be blamed by the four Divine Venerables if something went wrong.

But then again, even if they tried their best, they could do nothing to the Stone Spirit Clan.

Since the eight Great Kings were willing to play along, Yang Kai now had nothing to worry about and immediately focused on cracking the seal of the Blood Gate, weaving and manipulating the local Space Principles to the best of his ability.

At the same time, Xiao Xiao and Elder stood on guard by his side, nervously watching.
