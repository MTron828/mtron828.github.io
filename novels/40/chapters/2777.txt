After some time, a group of people were huddled together in the corner, all of their faces a pale shade, while Chen Qian and another female Elder were shivering in fright.

Yang Kai’s face was filled with shock as he looked towards the beautiful figure dancing about in the large hall with an Emperor Artifact longsword in her hand. After gulping with much difficulty, he asked seemingly to the Heavens, “What kind of situation is this?”

That figure was moving about without inhibition, staggering about with a bottle of wine in her hand. Her eyes were scarlet red, while she would cheer to herself from time to time, take a swig of her wine, before complimenting how good the wine was. Her emotions flowed out without restraint, as flower after flower of sword patterns formed as her longsword shook, radiating a chilling glow in all directions.

Di Rong replied in a bitter tone, “Junior Brother Yang, since you’re still quite new here, you’re not aware of the Three Great Taboos of our temple. I never imagined that you would witness this so soon after you become an Elder. This is truly… something to be celebrated.”

Yang Kai gawked, “Three Great Taboos? What Three Great Taboos?”

Chen Qian replied in a soft voice, “Temple Master’s birthday, Senior Brother Qiu’s fury, and… Senior Sister Gao drinking alcohol!”

“What kind of taboos are these?” A look of astonishment appeared on Yang Kai’s face before he looked back to the person before them. At this moment, he felt that the noble and pure image he had of that lady had completely collapsed and disintegrated. The lady he was looking at right now was basically a mental patient! Cleaning away the cold sweat that had formed on his forehead, he replied, “Why does Senior Sister Gao turn into a different person after drinking alcohol? Could it be that she has been taken over by some malicious spirit?”

“It isn’t that serious…” You Kun hastily waved his hand, while his expression turned strange, “It’s just that Junior Sister Gao… could never handle her alcohol.”

“How can that be? For better or worse, Senior Sister Gao is a Second-Order Emperor. No matter how strong the alcohol is, she would be able to easily remove its effect just by circulating her Emperor Qi. How does it turn into this?”

Chen Qian sighed, “It’s all due to Temple Master’s negative influence.”

“How does it concern Temple Master?” Yang Kai was utterly surprised by her reply and felt that what he had seen and witnessed today had caused his outlook of the world, life, and his values to collapse.

Chen Qian replied, “Senior Sister Gao was brought up by Temple Master from childhood. You should know about this, right?”

“Yes. I’ve faintly heard about this,” Yang Kai nodded his head.

Chen Qian revealed a sad and depressed look, “When she was young, Temple Master made Senior Sister Gao drink a number of times, and each time, it was until she was totally drunk. This culminated in one incident where she drank too much and turned crazy for a few days and nights before finally returning back to normal. After that, Senior Sister Gao always becomes like this whenever she touches alcohol.”

In this short story, one could sense the miserable childhood Gao Xue Ting had experienced. This truly made anyone who heard it feel sad and burst into tears.

“That’s… utterly heartless! It makes one bristle with anger!” Yang Kai cursed out in extreme anger, causing a wave of commotion that incited the group of Elders to nod their heads in succession, looks of contempt and disdain present in their eyes that were aimed towards that Temple Master of theirs.

After gawking for a while, Yang Kai continued, “Since she cannot drink alcohol, she should know better than to do it. Yet, how did she get so much Spirit Wine…” As he said that, Yang Kai took a sniff of the wine fragrance, before saying in praise, “This Spirit Wine has been fermented for a few hundred years. Tsk tsk, what a waste.”

“Who knows where she got them from?” Chen Qian was on the brink of tears, “She should have been feeling great the past few days, right? Last night, she even came to my Small Spring Peak to chat through the night with me before leaving.”

Another female Elder immediately added, “She had also come to me last night…”

Yang Kai sighed, “So, with this happening, what is the best option? Don’t tell me we have to wait for her to become sober for her crazed antics to stop?”

Chen Qian replied, “It’ll be alright when the wine is finished.”

Yang Kai swept his eyes across the scene, and his head started to hurt, “There are still over a hundred bottles, so how long will she be drinking for? In accordance with her speed, it will take a few days and nights before they are empty.”

“Other than that, there isn’t any option left,” Chen Qian shook her head.

Yang Kai thought silently for a while before a resolute expression appeared on his face as he stood straight up.

“What are you going to do, Junior Brother Yang?” You Kun asked in surprise.

“I’m going to accompany her to drink. The faster the wine is finished, the earlier this matter can end,” As he said that, he took big strides forward, appearing just like a man who would face an army of tens of thousands of people by himself!

Respectful looks immediately appeared on the faces of the various Elders present, as they looked blankly at his back figure.

“Youth…” Di Rong shook his head and sighed.

“Enough of this nonsense. Let’s help Junior Brother Yang restrain her before getting out of here as soon as possible,” You Kun shot a glare at the others, before looking over to Yang Kai, who had at some point been captured by Gao Xue Ting and was already getting alcohol forced down his throat. He immediately turned his head away, unable to continue watching on.

[Junior Brother! We will remember your sacrifice and pay this favour back in the future!]

Everyone understood this tacitly, proceeding to hold their breaths and tiptoe out of the premises.

Just as they arrived at the entrance though, an elegant figure suddenly shot towards them, flying straight towards You Kun’s face. A few strands of his black hair drifted away while a deep gulch was carved onto the ground. If not for the protection of the Spirit Array, that strike might have caused the entire palace to collapse.

“You all want to leave?” A frosty look was present on Gao Xue Ting’s face, appearing just like the north wind that had whipped over from the Nine Hells, to the point where even the air seemed to have frozen up. An ice-cold voice reverberated in everyone’s ears, causing everyone to freeze up, their entire being turning cold as a ghastly voice sounded, “Let me see if you all dare to take another step?”

Chen Qian looked pitifully at Gao Xue Ting and replied in a soft voice, “Senior Sister Gao, you’re drunk…”

Gao Xue Ting immediately tossed Yang Kai away, and with a flicker, appeared before the hall entrance, blocking the path. Slashing her long sword down, she glared imposingly at Chen Qian, “How am I drunk?”

“You, you… I…” Chen Qian was at a loss. An Emperor was actually forced to the point where she was just like a mouse that had bumped into a cat, unable to utter a single word properly at all.

“Stop your nonsense and come here and drink!” Gao Xue Ting grabbed hold of Chen Qian, wrapped her arm around the latter’s neck, and shoved the wine bottle towards her mouth.

Chen Qian only managed to gulp down a few mouthfuls before she could not hold back her gag reflex. Wine flowed and dripped down her slender neck, staining her robes, obliterating her gentle and humble pretty girl image in an instant…

“Hahahahaha!” Gao Xue Ting burst into laughter, appearing as though she was feeling exceedingly ecstatic before her pretty eyes rotated and locked onto You Kun.

You Kun instantly jumped up and extended his hand. Grabbing hold of a wine bottle as he hastily replied, “There’s no need for you to take action, Junior Sister Gao. This Senior Brother will do it himself.”

As he said that, he raised his head to take a drink, appearing incomparably heroic as he did so.

Only after seeing this did Gao Xue Ting reveal a satisfied look, before her pretty eyes shifted once again.

However, any Elder that was targeted by her, while filled with bereavement, hastily grabbed the fragrant wine and gulped it down in large mouthfuls.

Gao Xue Ting continued to laugh heartily, seemingly having lost all of her intellect. Waving her longsword once again, she started to perform a sword dance within the hall, causing Sword Qi to fly out in all directions, leaving Yang Kai and the rest to run helter-skelter away in distress.

“Junior Brother Yang…” Chen Qian managed to regain her senses after much difficulty. Extending her hand to rub the corners of her mouth, she proceeded to remind him with good intention, “Please do not use your cultivation to dispel your drunkenness, if you do…”

“If I do?” Yang Kai asked in surprise. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This conversation came too late though, as just like a spectre, Gao Xue Ting suddenly appeared in front of him. Extending her hand out, she grabbed hold of him, lifted him up just like a little chick, before speaking out in a chilling voice, “Little brat, you dare to cheat!?”

As she said that, the long sword in her hand started to vibrate, as though it was about to fly out from her hand at any moment.

Yang Kai’s face turned pale as he clamped his legs and cried out in alarm, “Please be merciful, Senior Sister Gao!”

“Hmph, you want me to be merciful?” Gao Xue Ting let out a cold snort, swept her eyes over Yang Kai before nodding, “Put your best into it then!”

Her longsword rose and shook before a bottle of spirit wine appeared on top of the sword’s tip as it was delivered before Yang Kai.

Yang Kai immediately revealed a look of deep bitterness. However, under the demanding glare from Gao Xue Ting, he had no choice but to clench his teeth and take up the bottle.

“Good, good, good!” Gao Xue Ting clapped and danced about, a satisfied look appearing on her face, as though she was a little girl that had just gotten a new toy. Just as Yang Kai had emptied the bottle, yet another one was hoisted before him.

Yang Kai looked at her with a face filled with bitterness.

“Are you going to drink or are you going to drink?” Gao Xue Ting’s face immediately turned frosty.

“I’ll drink, I’ll drink, I’ll drink…” Yang Kai stared at the longsword positioned below his chin, before nodding vigorously like a little chick pecking at rice grains.

After downing a total of thirteen successive bottles of hundred-year-old spirit wine, Yang Kai let out a full belch as his body started to sway. Under the sympathetic looks from the various Elders, he opened his mouth with much difficulty, “Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters… this little brother will take his leave first!”

As his voice rang out, he collapsed backwards onto the ground.

“Waste!” Gao Xue Ting stepped on Yang Kai ruthlessly and sneered. With a twist of her body, she leaned on his body, using him as a support as she raised a wine bottle in her hands and opened her mouth to drink.

The clear yet strong fragrant wine transformed into arrows of water, before being drunk up completely in just a few breaths.

With Yang Kai leading by negative example, the other Elders did not dare to hesitate anymore as they all proceeded to hug a bottle and start drinking. Within a moment, the entire hall was filled with a miserable atmosphere, as though Azure Sun Temple had been decimated by its bitter enemies.

The alcohol strength of the spirit wine was extraordinary, and coupled with them being unable to circulate their cultivation to get rid of its effects, even these Emperor Realms were unable to prevent themselves from getting wasted.

It did not take long for Chen Qian to reach her limits. She felt her entire world shake, while it seemed as though her eyelids were being weighed down by a few mountains. No matter how hard she tried, she could not keep them open. She tipped over as she collapsed onto the ground, passing out then and there.

Not long after, another female Elder joined her.

You Kun and Di Rong fell over in succession.

After a short while, snoring sounds filled the hall, as Azure Sun Temple Elders laid on the ground in a disorderly fashion. If anyone saw this scene, they would be in for a great shock.

The only person left was Gao Xue Ting, who continued to persevere away in her fight with those fragrant wines.

Only after drinking the last bottle up did she smack her lips, and collapse limply on the ground.

……

“You all actually gathered together to partake in heavy drinking in broad daylight! Highly improper!” On top of Spirit Jade Peak, Vice Temple Master Qiu Ran slammed his fist on the table, his moustache waving chaotically in the wind while the group of Azure Sun Temple Elders before him lowered their heads, embarrassed looks covering their faces.

“All of you are Elders of our Azure Sun Temple, with important responsibilities to shoulder, the very pillars of our temple! If we were to have faced an enemy incursion yesterday, what path would the thousand-year foundation of our temple have taken!?” Qiu Ran grew angrier as he shouted, to the point where his saliva shot out in all directions.

“We know our mistake, Senior Brother,” Gao Xue Ting lowered her head and straightforwardly admitted her wrongdoing.

“You know your mistake?” Qiu Ran grew even angrier as he stared at Gao Xue Ting and roared, “Do you think a single ‘I’m wrong’ will suffice!?”
