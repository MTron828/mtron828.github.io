The huge palm pressed down from above his head, together with a destructive aura, causing Mo Duo to let out a sigh, close his eyes, and bare his neck for execution.

At that moment, Yang Kai’s roar exploded in his ears, “You’re not making a move? Do you really want to die?”

This roar was like the Devil’s whisper, causing Mo Duo’s eyes to shoot open, and driven by primal instincts to survive, he pushed his Demon Saint strength wildly and swung his fists upward.

He suddenly found that the strength that had been restraining him had disappeared, and the Void Turbulence that had been binding him had also vanished, allowing him to use his full strength.

But Mo Duo regretted it the moment he threw his attack.

He asked himself, [What am I doing? As a Demon Saint, why am I resisting Sir Great Demon God?]

All his actions were made instinctually, done without any thought, driven by a simple desire to live. At the verge of death, one could not afford to think too much.

In any case, this was the full powered blow of a Demon Saint.

At the same time, Yang Kai, who was not far away, turned solemn and raised the Demonic War Hammer in his hand, pouring his own Demon Qi into it before swinging it heavily at the giant palm.

Space Principles engulfed the Demonic War Hammer, causing the Void to crack and distort wherever it passed. Not only that, Yang Kai also pushed his Time Principles into this attack. At this critical juncture of life or death, Yang Kai delivered a violent blow that surpassed his own limit.

This blow was the strongest he had ever unleashed, one that even he found difficult to comprehend.

Of these two great attacks, one was intentional while the other was unintentional. Yang Kai and Mo Duo’s coordination was perfect and delivered an amazing counterattack.

The giant palm halted slightly before a huge hole was pierced through it, causing a seemingly endless Demonic Qi to erupt out in all directions.

However, in the next instant, the giant palm recovered from their interference and slammed down towards where Yang Kai and Mo Duo were, destroying the two insignificant ants before continuing to press downwards.

Mo Duo’s muffled grunt disappeared instantly, and the three-hundred-metre-tall body fell apart, turning into pieces of shredded meat, scattered in the endless Void. Yang Kai too felt as though he was torn apart, his body dissipating completely, and only his Soul falling into an endless abyss.

[Am I dead?] Yang Kai did not know what death was like, but if Demon Saint Mo Duo could not survive this, it was naturally impossible for him to be alive.

[I think I’m really dead.]

In a daze, he suddenly felt as if he had forgotten many important things, only to suddenly remember something vaguely.

All the while he was self-reflecting, he continued to fall. His entire body was somehow loosened and relaxed as he plummeted endlessly. There was nothing that required his attention, nothing that could worry him. Maybe it was not such a bad thing to keep falling like this.

Then, there was a change, and the feeling of falling suddenly disappeared, followed by a change in his vision. When Yang Kai recovered his senses, he was already standing in a Void blanketed with twinkling stars. He turned his head to observe his surroundings; nothing but deathly silence remained. Even Yang Kai found he was without a physical presence or form.

Suddenly, the clamour of war and wild fluctuations of energy reached him from below.

He looked down, and his eyes widened.

He saw a huge, unmatched tree that connected Heaven and Earth standing tall in the middle of a battlefield full of blood and corpses. The magnificent tree crown had penetrated into the crack in the sky and was still growing continuously.

He saw some strong Humans evading the attacks of Demons under the big tree.

He also saw millions of Humans and Demons risking their lives in the vast surrounding wilderness.

In the sky on the other side, eight exceptionally powerful Masters were fighting. The Saints of the two races seemed to be competing on equal footing.

Yang Kai had the chills as he remembered something he had forgotten just now, and then remembered something even more distant from him.

[I am Shaman Niu, and I am the Shaman King of the South Barbarian Clan. I commanded a strong army called the Shaman Niu Clan.]

[I’m also Yang Kai, the Palace Master of High Heaven Palace in the Northern Territory of the Star Boundary.]

He did not know when he had completely forgotten all of this, especially his latter identity.

When he first came to this world, he would still remember it from time to time, remember that he was but a visitor in this world and had entered this Sealed World as a simple training experience. However, along with the outbreak of the war between the two Races, his identity became increasingly vague and had gradually adapted to the identity of Shaman Niu, ultimately completely forgetting his real name, Yang Kai.

He dragged a Demon Saint and launched a suicidal attack against Great Demon God. Was he trying to emulate the sacrifice of the Evergreen Divine Tree?

If he had remembered that he was Yang Kai, he would never have been so reckless and impulsive; after all, this was just a Sealed World, with everything he experienced possibly being one giant illusion.

But if he was looking at the situation as Ancient Barbarian Shaman Niu, doing such a thing would seem normal.

Shaman Niu would definitely make such a choice. Any Ancient Barbarian would make such a choice without hesitation. Even if he died, as long as there was even the slightest chance of success, his death would have value.

There was only one thing he could not understand, what the Hell was this place? Was everything just an illusion, or was he really dead?

“Isn’t it bizarre?” A voice suddenly came from behind.

Yang Kai jumped, not having expected anyone else to be here at all, but he did not turn around immediately, because he knew who the voice belonged to.

Standing in the void, he pointed down and asked, “Is all this real or just illusionary?”

“It’s real, and it’s also illusionary!” A petite figure walked over to him slowly and stopped next to him, her beautiful eyes looking down, watching the scene with Yang Kai.

Yang Kai turned to look at her in curiosity, “Please explain!”

“There is falseness in the truth, and there is truth in the false.” The woman winked at him a little playfully. This was an expression she had never shown before, and Yang Kai was taken aback.

Yang Kai continued to look at her without saying a word.

The woman continued, “This war is real. There really was such a battle between the two races in the Ancient Times. It’s not much different from what you are seeing before your eyes, only on a larger scale.”

Yang Kai frowned, “Then what about Shaman Niu?”

“It’s exactly because there were countless Shaman Nius in that war that this land could be preserved and the Demons were forced to retreat!”

Yang Kai exclaimed, “So what I saw and experienced as Shaman Niu is just a kind of summary?”

“Exactly!”

Yang Kai nodded, “I understand. Everything I experienced was just an illusion, but this illusion is not an empty fantasy, but instead based on the reality of the ancient past.”

This illusion had lasted quite a while, a full two years in fact.

But Yang Kai believed that it was impossible for such a war to have ended in just two years. It could have been twenty years, or maybe even two hundred years, but all of that had been condensed into a ‘short’ two year summary for him.

“Yes, and congratulations on your contributions in this war.” The woman pursed her lips and smiled.

Yang Kai sneered, “I died, there is nothing to congratulate me on.”

“Only in this world. You are still alive.” The woman chuckled slightly.

Yang Kai shook his head and continued, “I want to see the final result of this war.”

The woman nodded gently, stretching out her hand to touch the void. In the next moment, Yang Kai seemed to have turned into a Deity and everything below simply played out before him as he wished.

First, it was the Two Worlds Passage that connected the two Great Worlds. After Great Demon God destroyed Demon Saint Mo Duo and Shaman Niu, his palm continued to press downward.

However, the sacrifice of Mo Duo and Shaman Niu was not without effect. A hole was punctured into the huge palm, and a large amount of Demon Qi gushed out and was absorbed by the surrounding Void, greatly reducing the power of the huge palm. And as the giant palm continued pressing down, its power became weaker and weaker.

In the end, when the giant palm collided with the tree crown, it still shook the world.

The huge tree crown cracked, and countless broken branches and fallen leaves scattered in the wind as its mighty trunk splintered and split, as if it might collapse at any time.

But the Evergreen Divine Tree only swayed for a moment before it stabilized again. Emerald green light bloomed from every leaf and branch of the Evergreen Divine Tree, releasing an amazing aura of vitality.

The crown of the tree that had already touched the top of the Two Worlds Passage soared as if it was going through a growth spurt and immediately blocked all cracks in the sky.

Immediately afterwards, countless emerald green lights flew towards the sky like fireflies, rushing into the sealed boundary and disappearing.

The Two Worlds Passage was soon flooded with the same emerald green light.

The life essence that the Evergreen Divine Tree had accumulated for tens of thousands of years shrunk rapidly, its life aura all being transformed into emerald green light, which was used to seal the Two Worlds Passage.

When the Two Worlds Passage was completely flooded by countless emerald green lights, the tall sacred tree suddenly shook and its branches fell off, leaving only a bare trunk.

The Two Worlds Passage gradually shrank under the influence of the inexplicable force, and finally closed and disappeared.

The entire process took quite a long time, but after the green light faded, the Evergreen Divine Tree seemed to have lost all its vitality. The trunk of the tree that connected Heaven and Earth had turned into dust and scattered into the wind.

The Evergreen Divine Tree, Senior Qing, had sacrificed his life for the World, sealing the Two Worlds Passage.

All the Barbarians cheered in ecstatic surprise at this scene, while the Demons, who were still fighting, looked grief-stricken as if their parents had just died.

Losing the connection to the Demon Realm was a huge blow to the strength and morale of all the Demons, whether it was the miscellaneous warriors or the Demon Kings. It seemed that they could no longer perform at their best.

The Barbarians fought back and killed countless enemies.

And the stalemate of the battle of the Saints was finally broken.

The four Demon Saints gradually lost their footing and fled in embarrassment as the Shaman Saints chased after them. Half a day later, two Demon Saints were beheaded and killed on the spot. The other two Demon Saints knew that the situation was beyond salvation and split up to escape.

The Shaman Saints chased each of them separately.

The Demon Saints either fled or died while the Demons under their command were even more helpless. The war was over, and all that was left was to clean up the battlefield.
