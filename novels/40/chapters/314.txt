The mature beautiful woman Yun Li’s ten slender fingers seemed to contain some kind of magical power. No matter where she touched, Yang Kai’s physical and mental fatigue would vanish, which caused him to involuntarily relax and fall into a sense of extreme comfort.

A gentle village was the burial place of a hero, these words were not false.

Yang Kai also felt very contented with this service, and gradually closed his eyes and immersed himself in this pleasant feeling.

He was by no means an obstinate person, and since Shan Qing Luo had specifically sent Yun Li, Ruo Yu, and Ruo Qing to serve him and had even ordered them to accept any request he made, Yang Kai simply didn’t mind imposing such a minor matter upon this mature beauty.

These three, an enchanting mature woman, a gentle and tranquil girl, and an elegant and dignified young lady, each had their own unique style, but all of them were undoubtedly extremely attractive to men.

Now that this beautiful woman had taken the initiative to serve him, Yang Kai naturally had no reason to refuse. Doing so would only make it seem like he felt guilty about something.

A temporary tranquility fell upon the pavilion. Yang Kai didn’t speak, nor did the beautiful woman Yun Li make any noise. Both just concentrated on the massage.

As time passed, Yang Kai began to notice that the beauty kneeling behind him was beginning to breathe slightly heavier. Even the faint heat her body was radiating gradually increased. As she breathed in and out, a faint aroma leaked from her lips, and her heartbeat also started to accelerate.

Whether intentionally or unintentionally, while she was massaging him, Yun Li’s full amazingly elastic peaks from time to time would brush against Yang Kai’s back, which added to the ambiguous atmosphere.

Two cherry-like bulges occasionally pressed against him and sent a light shock running up his spine.

Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling surprised, and was unable to stop his expression from becoming awkward.

Yun Li, this graceful mature beauty, couldn’t actually be just as Bi Luo described, right? After suffering a ten year drought, was she really now akin to a starving wolf or crouching tiger, just waiting for an opportunity to pounce?

If not, why would she have such an exaggerated reaction from just a simple massage?

The not so subtle change in this beauty, along him being alone in his bedchamber, suddenly made various stray thoughts surface in Yang Kai’s mind.

In truth, Yun Li’s age was not large. At most, she was only twenty-five or so years old, and although she couldn’t be described as a girl anymore, she was still in the prime of her life.

Most importantly, she gave off the charm of a mature woman, both physically and mentally. She had a certain appeal that was impossible to find on a young naive girl, and this point alone made her particularly attractive.

This woman had been married once, but she had only been able to spend a single month with her husband before he died, since then she had spent ten years as a widows.

Ten years ago, she would have only been fifteen years old. To have tasted that kind of wonderful feeling and then have to spend so long without it, she may really have some unsatisfied desires.

Seemingly aware of Yang Kai’s awkward reaction, Yun Li once more wore an elegant smile and took the initiative to separate herself from Yang Kai as she softly said, “Young Lord, Ms. Bi Luo should arrive shortly.”

“En.” Knowing that she was simply reminding him, Yang Kai just nodded slightly before falling silent once more.

The mature beauty couldn’t help being slightly surprised. Apparently not thinking Yang Kai would be so succinct, she felt a bit lost in her heart.

A moment later, from outside the pavilion, the sound of Bi Luo gnashing her teeth and cursing under her breath rang out, as if she was just at a critical moment in her cultivation but had been disturbed by Ruo Yu and Ruo Qing. However, with Shan Qing Luo’s order in place, she really had no choice but to swallow her dissatisfaction and arrive quickly.

“Yang Kai!” Calling out from downstairs, Bi Luo stood straight with her hands on her hips, and her eyes clearly contained an unhappy light.

Yang Kai, in response simply stood up, walked over to the window, and without reservation jumped down to lightly land in front of her.

“A woman should try her best to maintain some elegance, why must you look so vicious?” Yang Kai quipped.

“Mind your own business!” Bi Luo snapped back at him and glared at Yang Kai in annoyance, “Don’t think that just because you managed to please me last time, I’ll suddenly take a liking to you! I’ll say it clearly once more, if not for Mistress’s orders, I, your aunt, wouldn’t bother wasting any of my time with you!”

“Fine, then give those things back!” Yang Kai reached out solemnly.

“What things?” Bi Luo asked in an indignant voice.

“That pair of earrings.”

Bi Luo hurriedly took a few steps back and bitterly stared at Yang Kai, “Why do you want them back now?”

“Since it’s no use trying to please you, why should I offer you anything, come on, quickly return them!” Yang Kai coldly said.

“Hey hey hey, are you really a man?” Bi Luo suddenly asked sarcastically, “Sending something out but then trying to grab it back, aren’t you being a bit too stingy?”

“It’s your own fault!” Yang Kai sneered. “Now, are you going to return them to me or not?

“Never!” Bi Luo firmly declared, “I won’t give them back! Since you gave them to me already they’re mine now, I’ll never give them back to you!”

“You’re determined?”

“En!”

“Good!” Yang Kai nodded, quickly striding forward towards the Palace.

“Where do you think you’re going!?” Bi Luo suddenly felt suspicious and quickly blocked his path.

“I’m going to tell your Mistress that you stole an artifact from her Treasure House!” Yang Kai looked at her defiantly as he smiled deviously.

“You... you...” Bi Luo falteringly took a few steps back and pointed her trembling finger at Yang Kai with her face dyed a bright shade of crimson, “How can you act so ruthlessly, you heartless, shameless bully! Obviously, you were the one who took them out from the Treasure House and threw it to me. That day you said...”

“I didn’t say anything that day!” Yang Kai smiled arrogantly towards her.

[Silly little girl, you’re still too naive. Did you really think this young master would be so kind to send you something without some strings?]

“That day, I didn’t get anything except two bottles of pills,” Yang Kai calmly declared.

“Don’t be so unreasonable, okay?” Bi Luo became completely sluggish. She finally understood what it meant to suffer injustice from receiving another’s gifts. She had no choice but to swallow her anger now. Although she couldn’t wait to rip Yang Kai’s corpse into ten thousand pieces, she still wore a delicate and aggrieved expression on her face.

Staring begrudgingly at Yang Kai she desperately pleaded, “You’re not such a person, right? Simply because my attitude just now wasn’t very polite, and I had a minor disagreement with you, are you really going to intentionally create a misunderstanding between Mistress and I just to see me get punished?”

Bi Luo wore a pitifully expression as she begged him, and her eyes became slightly watery, which gave her the appearance of an innocent young girl suffering a great injustice.

However, Yang Kai simply pretended he didn’t see any of this and coldly said, “I’m sorry, after all, I’m just a shameless ruthless person. Any grievances I have must be settled. Since you provoked me, I have to make sure you learn the folly of your choice.”

“You... I’ll remember you!” Bi Luo saw that the soft approach wasn’t going to work, so she immediately dispensed with her cheap act and bitterly ground her teeth as she asked, “What do you want...”

“Nothing, I’m just too bored, I thought it’d be a good time to have a chat with your Mistress!”

Bi Luo’s True Qi suddenly ferociously surged as she glared fiercely at Yang Kai, seemingly tempted to teach this rude brat a lesson.

Yang Kai remained indifferent however and instead sneered provocatively towards her. If Bi Luo thought that her True Element Boundary Seventh Stage was enough to suppress him, she was really looking down on him too much. He actually hoped she really would start something here. It would give Yang Kai the perfect excuse to act furiously towards Shan Qing Luo and allow him to legitimately escape from this devilish woman’s grasp.

The pair continued staring each other down until, all of a sudden Bi Luo’s momentum collapsed, and her threatening air evaporated, “Name your terms, I’ll agree!”

From childhood till now, the first gift she had received from a man had actually become a fatal constraint!

[From now on, even if it kills me, I’ll never accept gifts from someone ever again, especially a man!] Bi Luo felt like her innocent soul had suffered a deep wound, casting a lingering shadow in her heart.

“Either show me some respect or return those earrings.” Yang Kai casually demanded.

“Agreed!” Bi Luo replied forlornly, “What else?”

“I want to go out for a stroll, come with me.”

“En....”

“Good!” Yang Kai laughed triumphantly, his mood suddenly a bit lighter. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

As the two of them left, Yun Li, Ruo Yu, and Ruo Qing, who had watched this scene unfold, still couldn’t help staring with astonishment at the pair’s shrinking backs.

[Bi Luo... backed down?]

In Fragrance City, Bi Luo had always been fearless. Besides Shan Qing Luo, no one could make her submit, yet now Yang Kai, this young man of unknown origin, had actually forced her to back down?

The mature beauty and the two girls still couldn’t believe what they had seen, standing there stunned, not knowing what to say.

“Right, did Shan Qing Luo tell you if I wanted to buy something, she would pay?” After leaving the palace and arriving on the streets, Yang Kai suddenly asked.

“En.” Bi Luo nodded softly and seemingly did not have the energy to even reply.

However, suddenly thinking something, she angrily snapped, “You dare casually call Mistress by her real name?”

Before she could finish though, Yang Kai decisively interrupted her.

“Even in front of your Mistress’s face I dare call her by her name yet she never had a problem with it, so stop being so long winded.”

“You...” Bi Luo tightened her fists in rage, “I warn you, don’t overstep your bounds!”

Yang Kai simply ignored her and continued walking in front. Behind him, the sound of grumbling was obvious, as was the piercing glare of hatred which seemed akin to a wild beast ready to rip him to shreds.

Wandering around the city for a while, they eventually came to a medicine store.

This was a fairly high grade shop, as soon as the two of them entered, the store’s Head Treasurer stumbled out from behind the counters and swiftly arrived before Bi Luo, his forehead filled with cold sweat, “Greeting Ms. Bi Luo, your arrival was unexpected, so this servant has not prepared an appropriate welcome, please forgive this sin!”

As soon as the shop’s Treasurer shouted as such, all the people in the shop, whether they were employees or guests swiftly made their escape, as if they had seen a poisonous viper suddenly emerge. In the blink of an eye only the Head Treasurer and the young pair were left.

Yang Kai couldn’t help being astonished as he witnessed all of this, quickly discovering just how famous Bi Luo was in Fragrance City, and not in a good way.

“En.” Bi Luo offhandedly nodded, apparently used to such treatment already.

“Did Ms. Bi Luo perhaps come here today to... purchase something?” The Treasurer asked carefully while wiping the sweat from his forehead.

“I’m not here to buy things, he is! Quickly greet him.” Bi Luo snappily pointed towards Yang Kai.

“Hm?” The Treasurer suddenly became confused, and glancing back and forth between Yang Kai and Bi Luo, a light of suspicion flashed across his eyes.

“Do you have Soul nourishing and Spiritual Energy recovery type pills?” Yang Kai asked directly.

“Yes!” Treasurer repeatedly nodded, “Soul Cultivating Pill, Soul Supplement Pill, Soul Restoring Pill, we have all of these, which one does this Young Lord want?”

“How many do you have?” Yang Kai asked.

“The number of these pills is generally quite small, this humble store only has three or four bottles of each, only the Soul Recovery Pills have five bottles.”

“I’ll take them all!” Yang Kai’s casually made such grand demands.

In any case, since Shan Qing Luo was backing him, he might as well take advantage of the situation while he could. With her being a Great Demon King who reigned over several thousand kilometres of territory, she was definitely not short on money.
