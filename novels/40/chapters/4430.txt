The light of the spear expanded. Faced with the attack, Li Luo Shui bellowed, “Impudence!”

She raised her hand and pushed out her palm at Yang Kai. A Seventh-Order Open Heaven force fluctuated around her slender hand as it filled Yang Kai’s vision. The world seemed to have disappeared as all he could see was her palm.

He stiffened and squirmed as he instinctively felt a great sense of danger.

It was the first time he directly battled against a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master. Although he had witnessed battles between High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters several times before, he never actively participated in any of them. Be it the war when the Hundred Sects Alliance besieged Void Land or Zhu Jiu Yin’s battle against four High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters outside the Shadowless Cave Heaven, he was only a spectator.

Although Yang Kai was able to feel the formidableness of High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters at those times, it was too far beyond him to truly understand.

It wasn’t until this moment that he realised the huge gap between the Mid-Rank and High-Rank Open Heaven Realms.

Faced with this palm, Yang Kai felt as though he had turned into an ant, and that there was no way he could dodge. With a great roar, he thrust out his spear even harder, causing it to give off a terrifying radiance.

Violent explosions were heard as a horrifying force spread out.

A pale Yang Kai was sent flying away while Li Luo Shui remained on the spot, her figure only shaking slightly.

When she looked down at her hand, she saw a tinge of redness in the centre of her palm. Although the wound soon healed, she couldn’t believe that the other party was able to harm her during the exchange of moves just now.

This was inconceivable to her.

She had ascended to her current realm from the peak of the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, so she was fully aware of just how much strength a Sixth-Order Master should be able to exert. Initially, she thought that she could easily kill this arrogant boy, but the situation turned out far different from what she had imagined.

Just like Yang Kai had said, she was a newly promoted Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so the power she could use was limited. On the other hand, the enemy was quite intimidating as they had seven Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters and fifteen Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. Facing such a force, she might not be able to save Golden Rainbow Province. She initially intended to kill one of the enemy’s Sixth-Order Masters first to deter and intimidate the others, but it turned out that not only could the other party escape from her strike, but he even had the power to counterattack.

The young man’s capabilities were beyond her wildest imagination, and at that moment, she sported a solemn expression.

On the other hand, after Yang Kai was forced backwards for some distance, he managed to stabilize himself. He didn’t even bother to wipe away the Golden Blood at the corner of his mouth as he looked down condescendingly at Li Luo Shui and sneered, “Is this all you, a Seventh-Order Master, has to show?”

Back then, when the Hundred Sects Alliance invaded Void Land, other than using the Nine Heavenly Layers to kill Kong Feng, Yang Kai could only stand back and watch. When Zhu Jiu Yin battled against four Masters outside of the Shadowless Cave Heaven, he could only watch the intense battle from the sidelines. However, at this moment, he finally had the right to fight a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master. This right meant a lot to him, as it signified a huge leap forward in his Martial Dao. He no longer felt as powerless as he was in the past.

At this moment, Yang Kai felt fortunate that he didn’t insist on directly ascending to the High-Rank, which was practically impossible. Only the strength within one’s own grasp could be considered real.

After spitting out a mouthful of blood, Yang Kai pointed his spear at Li Luo Shui and roared coldly, “Kill!”

As Space Principles undulated, he instantly appeared in front of her and forcefully thrust out his spear.

At the same time, Mao Zhe, Geng Qing, Zhou Ya, Hua Yong, Shu Mu Dan, and the Proprietress all made a move as they sent out their own Divine Abilities at Li Luo Shui.

Seven Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters surrounded Li Luo Shui like moths to a flame, not only recklessly charging her, but also ensuring that she wouldn’t be able to escape. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In an instant, the entire Golden Rainbow Province shook and the world itself paled. Horrifying forces reverberated across the sky, causing the ground to crack and Spirit Peaks to crumble.

Chang Qi Shui and the others had already fled since they were unable to interfere in this kind of fight. Turning their heads, they saw that the Old Ancestor was surrounded by many figures as the lights of Divine Abilities dazzled their eyes. The energy fluctuations caused Chang Qi Shui, a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, to tremble.

He secretly prayed that their Martial Ancestor would be able to kill all the enemies; otherwise, Golden Rainbow Province would be doomed on this day.

Just then, he heard someone yelling at him, “Go to Hell!”

Turning his head, he saw a fatty who looked like a Chef coming at him with a kitchen knife in his hand. The man was clad in an apron with a giant ‘Slaughter’ character emblazoned on him.

The fatty was accompanied by a man with drooping eyes who was holding a golden abacus. While he was flying over, he fiddled with the beads which soon shot forward. Every bead seemed to contain a terrifying force behind it.

A flustered Chang Qi Shui immediately met the enemy head on with the Left and Right Protectors.

However, there was a huge gap in power between both parties. Golden Rainbow Province only had three Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters on their side while the enemy had fifteen Open Heaven Realm Masters in the same Order as them. These Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters wouldn’t dare to take part in the battle against Li Luo Shui, so they decided to pinch the soft persimmons instead.

Ma Tian Yuan, Chef, and Accountant engaged the three Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters from Golden Rainbow Province while the rest plunged into the Sect and launched a bloody massacre. Soon, the ground was covered in corpses and blood formed rivers across the land. Although Chang Qi Shui was incensed, there was nothing he could do to help them.

Horrifying forces spread around and caused the Spirit Peaks to explode as the Seven Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters engaged in an intense battle against the Seventh-Order Master.

From time to time, someone would grunt in pain before they were sent flying away, spraying out a mouthful of blood in mid-air.

Li Luo Shui was a new Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master whose realm was still not stable, but despite that, the seven Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters could only force a draw in the battle against her while Yang Kai alone had to bear half of the pressure.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but think that the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm was indeed a completely different realm from the Mid-Rank. Li Luo Shui was already so powerful even though she had only just achieved an ascension. When she managed to stabilise her realm and accumulated some heritage, how much more power would she be able to exert?

How formidable must Zhu Jiu Yin be since she was able to deal with four High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters on her own outside of the Shadowless Cave Heaven back then?

It had to be noted that the four High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters from that time were unlike Li Luo Shui. All of them ascended to the Seventh-Order a long time ago, so they were certainly much stronger than Li Luo Shui currently was.

Since a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was already so strong, what about the Eighth-Order or a Ninth-Order?

When Li Luo Shui saw that many of the disciples from Golden Rainbow Province were either killed or critically injured, and that the Sect had descended into chaos, her alluring face contorted into a hideous expression. Her moves became increasingly powerful, as though she was adapting to her current realm.

However, even though she was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, she found it extremely difficult to kill any of her opponents. The leading young man was a Master of the Dao of Space, and his strength far surpassed the other Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. He had practically borne half of her attacks. If it weren’t for this young man, Li Luo Shui had the confidence to kill the rest in short order.

After just half an hour of combat, Yang Kai and everyone on his side was injured, but Li Luo Shui wasn’t in any better condition. She no longer looked like a sweet young woman as presently, her hair was a mess and she was covered in sweat.

Just then, someone was heard screaming. Chang Qi Shui and the others were pushed over the edge by Chef, Accountant, and Ma Tian Yuan and had no choice but to cry out, “Martial Ancestor, save us!”

Right after Chang Qi Shui shouted, Chef slashed across his neck with his knife and sent his head flying away. Blood started spurting out of his neck like a fountain.

Realising that they were unable to turn things around, the Left and Right Protectors tried to flee, but they didn’t have a chance to do so. Accountant shot the beads from his abacus at them from all directions and formed countless holes in their figures. Ma Tian Yuan promptly made a move and beheaded the two of them.

The three Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters of Golden Rainbow Province were all killed while the other Open Heaven Realm Masters had basically been wiped out beforehand. Countless others below the Open Heaven Realm were either dead or dying.

The entire Golden Rainbow Province was no different from a living Hell and the Spirit Province where the Sect was located was beginning to crumble and crack.

Li Luo Shui shouted through clenched teeth, “All of you must die today!”

All of a sudden, her curvy figure shook as an invisible force spread out with her as the centre. Yang Kai and the others, who had surrounded her, were sent flying away as they were caught off guard.

Yang Kai’s pupils contracted when he saw what was happening as he felt his chest tightening.

That was because Li Luo Shui’s black hair and clothes flapped in the air even though there wasn’t a trail of wind, as though an invisible force was infusing into her petite figure from all directions. At the same time, her aura seemed to be rising rapidly.

Yang Kai was flabbergasted as he had no idea what was going on.

...

It was difficult to deal with this woman to begin with as seven Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were unable to take her down; however, it now seemed that her strength was rapidly increasing all of a sudden.

Right then, the Proprietress exclaimed, “Azure Void Universe Augmentation Grand Law!”

“What in the world is that?” Yang Kai asked in shock. The Proprietress’ words suggested that she realised what Li Luo Shui was doing.

There was no time for any explanation so the Proprietress simply sent him a wisp of her Divine Sense that contained all the information he needed to know.

Soon, Yang Kai learned what this Azure Void Universe Augmentation Grand Law was. Strictly speaking, it was a Forbidden Technique.

An Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master named Azure Void Divine Monarch had created this technique many years ago. Using his own body as a Refining Furnace, he drew the heritage of his Sect’s Headquarters into his body and forcefully increased his strength with this Forbidden Technique.

The Headquarters of every great force contained a heritage that had been accumulated over thousands, if not tens of thousands of years. This heritage was the inheritance left behind in the Headquarters by the Open Heaven Realm Masters who passed away over the millennia for its future disciples.

However, this kind of heritage could also be absorbed and refined.

It was a painfully long process for an Open Heaven Realm Master to increase their strength through the refinement of Open Heaven Pills, cultivation resources, or the World Force of a Universe World.

Regardless of what method they used, the goal was to strengthen the World Force of their Small Universe, thus allowing them to wield greater force.

The heritage within the Headquarters of a great force could be absorbed and refined in a similar manner.

...

Nevertheless, no one would do that, usually. Firstly, it would weaken the Sect’s heritage, thus causing some instability to their own great force. Secondly, it was basically impossible for this heritage to match with their Small Universe. Absorbing this heritage forcefully was basically like drinking poison to slake one’s thirst.
