World Principles were what made a world a world, the fundamental laws and building blocks of everything that existed, it was simply impossible for them to ‘change’ in such a short amount of time, unless the end of the world was coming. And yet, the way this man spoke sounded absolutely certain, very much unlike a lie. Nevertheless, it was simply too hard to believe.

“Hurry up, what are you still dawdling over there for?”

A shout suddenly came from the depths of the cave. Yang Kai raised his brow as he didn’t think there would actually be people inside this cave.

After hearing the man’s urging, the couple hurriedly went deeper into the cave. Shooting a glance at Zhu Qing, Yang Kai quickly followed them.

A small light was lit, and within a not so spacious stone room, a middle-aged man stood with a gloomy look on his face, seemingly waiting for something.

“Liao Guan Shi.” The man who led Yang Kai here went up to him and cupped his fists to salute the man in a respectful manner.

Meanwhile, that Liao Guan Shi didn’t even look at him and was just staring curiously at Yang Kai and Zhu Qing who had followed the couple in before asking in surprise, “Why are there two extra people? Where did they come from? They don’t look very familiar.”

The man responded, “They seem to have strayed in from the outside world and happened to run into us, so we brought them here as well.”

“From the outside?” Liao Guan Shi clicked his tongue in awe. He continued observing the two unfamiliar faces. When he looked at Yang Kai, he showed no special reaction, but when his eyes steered to Zhu Qing, they couldn’t help but light up, revealing a look of interest.

Zhu Qing was a natural beauty, and after receiving the nourishment of the dew during the past few days, she was currently at her most tender and beautiful state, so she appeared especially charming.

Zhu Qing wore her usual cold expression on her face, but even though she did not like being stared at in such a way, she did not get angry. Yang Kai’s body moved in front of her at that moment, blocking the man’s view.

Liao Guan Shi coldly snorted, looking unhappy, “These outsiders not knowing the rules is acceptable.” He raised his head to the man, “But it can’t be that the two of you don’t either, can it?”

The man quickly answered, “I will be troubling Liao Guan Shi.”

Only then did Liao Guan Shi’s face clear up a little before beckoning the couple over.

After both of them stepped forward, Liao Guan Shi suddenly began chanting under his breath and circulating the energy in his body. Then, fingers erected like a sword, he tapped several points on the man’s body in mid-air.

Yang Kai was stunned at this, because he actually saw some traces of a Shamanic Spell in this Liao Guan Shi’s techniques. Curiosity piqued, he couldn’t help but observe carefully.

In just a short while, a complicated seal suddenly appeared in the air. Liao Guan Shi struck his palm out, and the seal was thrust into the man’s body. The seal seemed to have other purposes and was not an attack. After his figure swayed slightly, the man was fine.

When it was the woman’s turn, there was a rare smile on Liao Guan Shi’s cold face. Instead, it was the woman who had a nervous look on her face. She glanced at her husband, as if pleading for help.

The man slowly shook his head and lowered his gaze.

Liao Guan Shi did the same thing to her, but this time, his hands were a little less well-mannered. When he was pointing out the spots with his fingers, he would touch the woman’s body from time to time, and when his fingers brushed past the woman’s full peaks, it caused her tender body to shudder.

The man ignored all this and stood to the side, watching them without turning his gaze away.

Liao Guan Shi was now in a joyful mood and the movements of his hand grew more and more unruly, causing the woman’s face to look more and more terrible, yet she had no choice but to endure it.

In just a short while, another seal was drawn and Liao Guan Shi thrust it into the woman’s body a little reluctantly before leisurely withdrawing his hand. Only then did the woman’s stiff body relax and she glanced at her husband with a look of chagrin.

Turning his head to Yang Kai, Liao Guan Shi’s face immediately cooled down, “Since you come from the outside, let me tell you about the rules here.”

Yang Kai looked at him with a smile, “Please enlighten me.”

Liao Guan Shi explained, “In a moment, the World Principles will change. Other than the Human Imperial City, there will be no safe place in the entire Revolving World. So, if you want to live, then you have to go to Human Imperial City. Got that?”

“Understood. We must head to Human Imperial City!” Yang Kai looked enlightened.

Liao Guan Shi continued, “And, if you wish to enter Human Imperial City, then you must receive the Human Sovereign Seal from this Guan Shi. Only those with the Human Sovereign Seal can be transported to Human Imperial City through the array. So, there is only one rule in this place… The Heavens and the Earth are great, but this Guan Shi is the greatest!”

Liao Guan Shi swung his sleeves and stood with his hands crossed behind his back, shouting, “This Guan Shi asks you, do you want to live or die?”

Yang Kai smiled, “Naturally, if I can live then I want to live.”

Liao Guan Shi nodded, “Seems you’re a student who can be taught. Come, let me apply the Human Sovereign Seal to you.”

Yang Kai stepped forward, but Liao Guan Shi waved him away with a repugnant look, “Women first. You stand aside.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Yang Kai frowned and did not insist. As he stood aside, he said, “I must ask Liao Guan Shi to please be careful. My wife’s temper is not very good.”

Liao Guan Shi coldly snorted, “She better be smart if she wants to live!”

After saying that, he began chanting another spell. Fingers forming a blade, he tapped several points in front of Zhu Qing’s body, seemingly drawing something in mid-air. At first, his hands were still behaving, but in just a moment, the movements of his hand grew wider, and when he swung his fingers next, they brushed right over Zhu Qing’s chest, and his expression that instant also swelled with excitement. He was clearly anticipating something.

Zhu Qing suddenly looked up and glared coldly at him.

Liao Guan Shi was taken aback, but the movements of his fingers did not stop. It seemed he fully intended to take advantage of this situation.

“Wang!”

“Ah!”

A bark and a man’s scream broke out at the same time. The black puppy that had been in Zhu Qing’s arms the whole time suddenly opened its mouth and bit Liao Guan Shi’s hand. Even though its mouth was clearly not very big, it was able to swallow Liao Guan Shi’s entire hand, its sharp teeth sinking deep into his wrist, drawing a spray of fresh blood.

Liao Guan Shi howled in pain, but the black puppy refused to let go. It shook its head left and right, seemingly trying to bite the man’s hand off while a threatening growl was emitted from its mouth.

“Let go! Let go of me! This little beast is courting death!!” Liao Guan Shi cursed angrily, but he could not break free. Out of desperation, he slapped a palm fiercely towards the black puppy, and as energy fluctuated, rumbling thunder and flashing lightning emerged in the cave.

Flicking his wrist gently, Yang Kai released a burst of Emperor Qi.

Liao Guan Shi let out another miserable howl and his extended arm dropped limply.

“You… How dare you attack me!” Liao Guan Shi turned his head to glare in hatred at Yang Kai, grinding his teeth and hissing. It had been a long time since he encountered such a thing. He had always been the one to order people around and act as he pleased. He never expected to actually kick an iron plate this time.

This all happened in the blink of an eye. The couple who brought Yang Kai and Zhu Qing were also shocked. When he saw Liao Guan Shi eating a loss, the man quickly said, “Stop! Do not hurt him!”

The woman finally spoke up as well, “Don’t fight with him. You’ll only regret it.” This was the first time she spoke, her voice panicked beyond expression.

Liao Guan Shi quickly said to them, “Hurry up and kill those two! Otherwise, this Guan Shi will condemn both of you!”

The couple was both dumbfounded when they heard that, and their faces paled as if a great disaster had befallen them. For a moment, they were at a loss of what to do.

“You sure are arrogant!” Yang Kai went up to Liao Guan Shi and stared at him curiously, “Tell me, what gives you the right to act so haughty? As a trivial First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator actually dares act unruly in front of this Young Master?”

Liao Guan Shi’s forehead was covered in a cold sweat as he tried to struggle several times, but was still unable to break free from the black puppy’s restraint. Seeing how he was really stuck, he instead sneered and scoffed, “What right? By the right of me being a Steward, by the right of controlling the Human Sovereign Seal!”

Yang Kai turned his head over to the couple, “Just because of that Human Sovereign Seal? That’s why you choke down your voices even when you’re being bullied? This guy probably isn’t even as strong as you two, right?”

The man lowered his head, “Without the Human Sovereign Seal, we won’t be able to enter Human Imperial City. If we can’t enter Human Imperial City, we’ll only die!”

Yang Kai scoffed, “What joy is there in life, and what is there worth fearing in death? You’re a man, aren’t you? If you won’t resist even when your wife is being molested in front of you, then you’re better off just dying.” He turned to Zhu Qing and winked at her, “Qing’er, rest assured. I, your husband, will not let you lose a hair even if I die.”

Zhu Qing scowled, “Don’t try to be slick with me. I didn’t even see you make a move just now.”

Yang Kai was amused, “He’s nothing but trash. You could take care of him with just a breath. You didn’t need my help at all.”

Zhu Qing grunted but didn’t say anything more.

The man was extremely humiliated by Yang Kai’s words, but the woman went over to him and tugged on his hand before turning to Yang Kai, “You’re new here so don’t talk nonsense when you don’t know what you’re talking about. You better let go of Liao Guan Shi as soon as possible, otherwise, you’ll never be able to establish any foothold in Human Imperial City.”

Liao Guan Shi became energized and shouted, “Newcomers always have to suffer some losses to learn the rules! Release me now, otherwise, this Guan Shi will give you a death without burial!”

Yang Kai laughed, “And you’re going to make concessions if we let you go?”

Liu Guan Shi said, “Don’t even think about it. This Guan Shi is the Human Sovereign’s subordinate. If you dare to hurt this Guan Shi, then Human Imperial City won’t accept you! Your woman, on the other hand… If you surrender her to this Guan Shi, then perhaps we can work out a way for you to survive.”

“You seem… a bit messed up in the head.” Yang Kai looked at him with a speechless face. Even at death’s door, he was still trying to threaten him. He really had no idea what this guy was thinking inside.

Zhu Qing called out, “Ah Wang, bite him!”

The black puppy heeded her order and suddenly split its mouth into a giant maw, swallowing Liao Guan Shi into his stomach with one gulp before sticking its big tongue out to lick its lips, as if it still hadn’t had enough.

As this was her first time seeing the black puppy’s Divine Ability, Zhu Qing was stunned. She had only wanted the black puppy to bite the man harder, but she never thought he would swallow him directly instead.

What kind of Divine Ability was this?

When the couple saw this, their faces changed and they said in horror as they shouted, “Demon Beast! It’s really a Demon Beast!”

The reason why they chased after the black puppy previously was that they had detected some Demon Beast aura from it, but after a quick inspection, they confirmed that it was just their imagination. But now, it seemed like they weren’t mistaken. The black puppy’s Demon Qi had merely been hidden too deeply and only when it suddenly struck out using its strange innate ability was there a clear surge of Demon Qi, which they recognized at once.
