The next day, when Yang Kai walked out of his wooden house, two hundred pairs of eyes fixed on him simultaneously. All the men, women, young and old villagers were gathered here. Although there was a large number of people, they were all silent and unified.

The petite girl, Tiea, was standing at the head of the crowd, looking particularly eye-catching.

Yang Kai swept his eyes across the crowd, and every villager who met his eyes showed a simple and honest smile.

They probably did not know what the Demon Race was, and had no idea what the invasion of the Demon Race meant, but they all knew that once they left this village, they might die in a foreign land and never return.

Ah Niu had already made this clear yesterday.

But no one chose to remain. The Ancient Barbarian Race was destined to move forward bravely and never glance back in regret.

There was sadness in Yang Kai’s eyes, but he did not say much and instead just waved his hand, “Let’s go!”

He led the two hundred villagers to King City like a well-trained army.

With the strength of the Barbarians’ legs, they would take at least three days to reach King City. If it was an ordinary Shaman who led these two hundred people, they would probably have to travel at full speed in order to reach their destination within the specified time.

But Yang Kai was a Shaman Grandmaster now and was also proficient in various Shamanic Spells. With the application of the Light Body Spell, the movement speed of the villagers immediately increased by about thirty percent.

Although they were fast, everyone was calm and moved in an orderly fashion.

After two days, Yang Kai had led the villagers to King City, and his group of two hundred people had expanded to a thousand people!

It was because they met several groups from other villages along the journey. There were Shamans in those villages too, but they were incomparable to a Shaman Grandmaster like Yang Kai. Among them, the strongest one was just a High-Rank Shaman Apprentice, while the rest were just Low-Rank and Mid-Rank Shaman Apprentices.

The strength of these villages was almost the same as that of Blue South Village when the old Village Chief Shaman Li was still alive.

The Barbarian Race had a custom of revering strength, and since all of them were South Barbarian Clansmen, and Yang Kai was a Shaman Grandmaster, these villages naturally accepted him as their leader.

After witnessing Yang Kai’s Shamanic Spells that could completely bless an army of a thousand people, the Shaman Apprentices respected him even more. These villages had some contact with each other, so they were quite familiar with each other, and after gathering together, they soon became one unified group.

After this war, if these thousand people were not killed, Yang Kai could even establish a small independent Clan with his strength and prestige.

A thousand troops stood in front of King City. Looking from a distance, the structure of King City was no worse than that of Frost and Snow City, the only difference being that Frost and Snow City had the Evergreen Divine Tree guarding it, while the South Barbarian Clan had no such guardian deity.

Many Ancient Barbarians gathered in an open area outside King City in groups of hundreds to thousands. Each group had a Shaman in it, and their strengths varied greatly. Obviously, they all came after receiving orders from King City. It was impossible for all of them to enter King City itself though, as there were too many of them arriving at once. King City did not have enough space to house them.

Therefore, everyone could only wait outside, sleeping and eating in the open area, but such a lifestyle was nothing to the Ancient Barbarian Race.

Yang Kai and his people arrived neither too late nor too early. The places near King City had been occupied by other villages, so Yang Kai scanned over the region with his Divine Sense and then led his group to an average-sized space that he found.

Upon arriving at this place, without any further instructions, the team of a thousand people got to work. Some took out their rations, and some started fires while preparing to cook. Everyone was working efficiently.

Just then, a Shaman Master flew out of King City, and shouted while flying through the sky, “Sir Shaman King has ordered all Shaman Grandmasters to gather inside King City.”

He shouted several times, attracting everyone’s attention.

Immediately, a Shaman Grandmaster flew out of the crowd and straight into King City. As if a chain reaction was triggered after someone took the initiative, Shaman Grandmasters flew out from the crowd one after another, like swallows flying into the arms of King City.

Yang Kai glanced at them, then looked back and instructed, “I’ll go over. You should stand watch over here.”

Tiea nodded lightly.

Although she was also a Shaman Grandmaster, she belonged to the Nomad Clan, so it was inconvenient for her to appear on this kind of occasion.

King City was huge, but although Yang Kai had set out later, he still arrived earlier than most. Like the other Shaman Grandmasters, he landed in front of a palace of King City and waited quietly.

Many had gathered here as, due to the invasion of the Demon Race, the entire South Barbarian Clan had been assembled by the order of the Shaman King. As such, Shaman Grandmasters who were rarely seen were now like cabbages and radish in this square.

Yang Kai investigated with his Divine Sense and found that there were at least a hundred Shaman Grandmasters assembled here, and this was definitely not all of them as there should be more still on the way here, having failed to reach King City in time.

The Shaman Grandmasters dared not to intrude into the Shaman King’s palace rashly after being summoned and could only wait outside. Those Shaman Grandmasters who knew each other gathered together in groups to discuss the situation of the invasion of the Demon Race in hushed whispers.

They had obviously gotten some information from the messenger too, but no one knew what the Demon Race was. Therefore, the more they discussed, the more confused they got. Nevertheless, such a grand summons from King City had made everyone feel a little uneasy.

Everyone knew that the battle this time around was probably going to be unprecedented.

Just when Yang Kai was feeling bored, a dark burly shadow suddenly appeared and shaded him like a mountain.

Yang Kai turned around and saw a wide and strong chest covered in black hair.

“Are you also from our South Barbarian Clan?” The master of the dark shadow looked down at Yang Kai and asked in a rumbling voice.

The sound of discussion around them abruptly softened a lot as many Shaman Grandmasters turned their eyes to them, watching with great interest.

Previously, when everyone gathered here, many had looked at Yang Kai curiously; after all, his body shape seemed a little different from theirs and was quite out of place, like a goat appearing among a group of tigers.

It was hard for such a weird person to not attract attention. There were very few clansmen with this kind of body in the Ancient Barbarian Race. Even Shaman Li, the former Village Chief of Blue South Village, who was quite old, still had a burly physique similar to the one he possessed in his younger years.

Nevertheless, Yang Kai did exude an aura of a Shaman Grandmaster, so even if the others were curious, they did not care too much until someone questioned Yang Kai face to face.

Ever since he came to this ancient world, it had become a habit for Yang Kai to look up while talking to people, as if everyone wanted him to look up to them, which made him feel quite uncomfortable.

This time, however, he simply stared at the man’s black hairy chest and nodded, “En.”

“Ha!” The man laughed, “Little brat, I’m talking to you, look up at me.”

“My neck is sore, how about you squat down and talk to me?” Yang Kai shook his head and replied casually.

The burly Shaman Grandmaster’s aura abruptly became cold as someone nearby laughed at him, “Shaman Tu, this guy is underestimating you! Teach him an unforgettable lesson quickly!”

The Ancient Barbarian Race were basically all hot-tempered, so it was natural for fights to break out. Everyone felt bored standing here doing nothing anyways, so they were looking forward to some excitement to kill some time.

All of a sudden, everyone’s attention focused on them, anticipating a good show.

“I don’t need you to tell me!” Shaman Tu turned to bellow at the person who spoke to him, then turned back to Yang Kai and snorted coldly, “What? Are you afraid of looking at me?

Yang Kai continued to stare at the bundle of black hair on this man’s chest and remarked, “I prefer others to talk to me with their heads down.”

Shaman Tu was stunned, but soon he understood what Yang Kai meant, and retorted angrily, “Little brat, are you looking for a fight!?”

Just when he finished the sentence, he threw his plate-sized fist at Yang Kai.

Instead of being shocked, the onlookers were all overjoyed. Some of them even whistled, looking extremely excited. The Ancient Barbarian Race was known for its combative nature, and moreover, everyone here was a Shaman Grandmaster, so this punch would not be lethal. At most, this scrawny man would bleed a bit, and seeing blood in a fight had always been the Barbarians’ favourite pass-time.

Yang Kai remained unmoved, however, as if he did not realize his opponent was attacking him, the wind of the punch whistling as it approached him, sending his hair flying.

At the last moment, the palace doors that had been closed the whole time suddenly opened and a Barbarian Warrior with a steel blade hanging on his waist came out from inside and bellowed, “Sir Shaman King asks all of you to enter.”

The huge fist stopped abruptly less than a finger’s width from Yang Kai’s head. Shaman Tu’s face contorted with anger, and it took great effort to suppress his wish to push his fist forward.

“You got lucky. If you dare to do this again next time, it won’t be just a simple lesson,” he remarked as he withdrew his hand.

After that, he turned around and left.

He dared not ignore the Shaman King’s order. Although he could have let his punch continue, his loss would outweigh his gain if his action offended the Shaman King. Even though the Ancient Barbarian Race was simple-minded, they weren’t stupid. They clearly knew how to weigh profits and losses. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The group of more than one hundred Shaman Grandmasters walked towards the hall orderly and quietly, the whispering and discussion from before ceasing entirely.

Yang Kai was the last in line, and he intentionally shot a glance at the Barbarian Warrior as he walked by.

He could feel the insanely vigorous vitality coming from this Barbarian Warrior’s body; Ah Hu and the others were nothing compared to him. Yang Kai vaguely felt that this Barbarian Warrior was someone that he should not mess with.

Even an ordinary Shaman Grandmaster may not have a good end even after opposing such a man.

But Yang Kai did not notice any fluctuation of Shaman Strength from this warrior, which meant that he was purely a Body Cultivator.

Sure enough, the three thousand Grand Daos all led to the Heavens. It was rumoured that someone was able to achieve Sainthood through Body Tempering in ancient times. Yang Kai did not care much about this before, but after he saw this Barbarian Warrior, he believed that achieving Sainthood through Body Tempering was not just a rumor.

It was said that one of the four Great Shaman Saints achieved Sainthood through Body Tempering.

The Barbarian Warrior naturally sensed Yang Kai’s unbridled gaze and widened his eyes as he stared straight back at Yang Kai with a pair of eyes as sharp as two blades, actually causing the latter’s eyes to sting slightly.
