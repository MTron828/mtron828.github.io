“You want to sell them at an auction?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, “Good idea, President Hua really has a talent for business!”

“Sir surely jests!” Hua You Meng flushed.

“No no, I sincerely admire your talent. An ordinary person can’t think of such a good idea in such a short period of time.”

“Then does Sir agree?” Hua You Meng looked at Yang Kai in pleasant surprise.

“En, I wanted to go out for a walk to see the richness of Purple Star City anyways, so I’ll have to trouble President Hua to be my guide,” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

Hua You Meng quickly got up and said happily, “Then please wait a moment, Sir. I’ll be right back after I inform Uncle Xia and the others about my plan to sell these land deeds.”

“Go on, I’ll wait for you outside,” Yang Kai nodded.

Some time later, Hua You Meng walked out of Five Paths Chamber of Commerce.

Regarding the sale of the thirty-odd land deeds, everyone in the Chamber of Commerce had different thoughts. Some, like the previous Hua You Meng, wanted to keep all the land deeds to grow the Chamber of Commerce; after all, this was a rare opportunity that no one wanted to miss. Some wanted to compromise, selling half while keeping the other half, this way, not only would they have enough shops, but also enough Saint Crystals.

However, in the end everyone agreed to Hua You Meng’s decision to sell all the land deeds.

Although they did not know why Yang Kai would suggest this, they dared not disregard the words of an Origin King. However, because of this, Five Paths Chamber of Commerce would miss an opportunity to establish themselves in Purple Star City, making many sigh.

Hua You Meng looked around and saw Yang Kai squatting in front of a stall not far away, bargaining with its owner.

[Do Origin Kings actually buy things like this?] Hua You Meng felt strange just seeing this scene and quickly walked over. Soon, the voices of Yang Kai and the seller reached her ears.

“Brother, my Red Copper Web Crystal is a good Artifact Refining material that took me a lot of effort to mine. Using it, one can definitely refine a Saint King Grade High-Rank artifact. Isn’t your offer of 10,000 High-Rank Saint Crystals a bit outrageous?” The seller exclaimed angrily.

“Ten thousand isn’t low,” Yang Kai ignored the seller’s argument entirely and just said back with a smile.

“Good, good, you drive a hard bargain. I’ll sell it to you for 80,000 Saint Crystals. Consider it my respect for your business skills.”

“10,000!”

“70,000. This is really my bottom line, I can’t lower it any further!”

“10,000!”

“Are you serious? Bumping into a fellow who cannot tell the quality of goods is my misfortune it seems... Fine, you look like a handsome and intelligent man my brother, so I’ll give you a bit of face. 65,000!”

“10,000!”

“60,000!”

“10,000!”

“Damn it, which of my enemies sent you to mock me? Do you think I won’t hack you to death here!?” The seller was so angered by Yang Kai after a while that he drew out a Saint King Grade sabre and pointed it at his nose while fiercely cursing, seemingly saying he would not tolerate any more nonsense.

Yang Kai let out a hearty laugh, quickly got up, and rushed away.

“Damn fool!” The seller saw him run off and stowed his artifact before yelling out towards the disappearing Yang Kai, “Don’t let me see you here again, or I’ll beat you senseless!”

“Sir...” Hua You Meng appeared next to Yang Kai with a deep frown on her face, “This... this is...”

She could not believe what she had just seen. A dignified Origin King Realm master actually bargaining back and forth over a few thousand Saint Crystals with a Saint King Realm cultivator for half an hour, in the end not actually buying anything and being driven away.

Was he really an Origin King? Did he not care how offensive that seller had been to him? If that seller knew he had just cursed out and pointed a weapon at an Origin King, it was really hard to imagine just what his expression would be.

“I was just experiencing the local customs of Purple Star City while passing the time away,” Yang Kai explained with a smile. “En, the temper of Purple Star City’s cultivators is a bit hot.”

Hua You Meng did not know whether to laugh or cry, thinking that anyone who was pestered so endlessly would react similarly.

“Anyways, let’s head to that Clear Sky Auction House to deal with the land deeds,” Yang Kai motioned. “Lead the way.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“En,” Hua You Meng responded and obediently led the way.

Yang Kai kept looking around as they walked forward, as if he was a countryside hick who had just come to the big city for the first time, everything giving him a fresh feeling.

As for Hua You Meng, her head was a mess. Yang Kai’s performance completely subverted her perception of Origin Kings.

In her imagination, Origin Kings should be like Lu Tian Feng, arrogant and aloof, but when she saw Yang Kai mix into the crowd, he seemed no different from an ordinary cultivator, even somewhat naïve compared to most. If she were to have met him right now, Hua You Meng would not believe he was an Origin King.

Soon after, Hua You Meng arrived at a carriage rental stall.

The carriages were pulled by two monster beasts that looked similar to horses. The carriages were spacious and comfortable. After Yang Kai and Hua You Meng boarded one, the carriage driver swung his whip and the carriage moved forward smoothly.

“These Snow Treading Colts are Fifth-Order Monster Beasts, and although they don’t have much combat power, their speed is quite good, so Purple Star City raised many of them to use as a means of transportation in the city for cultivators. Because flying is not permitted, and the city is quite large, these carriages are very popular with everyone, but the cost to use them even once isn’t low, five thousand High-Rank Saint Crystals,” Hua You Meng explained to Yang Kai as they rode.

“Fifth-Order Monster Beasts...” Yang Kai nodded. “Purple Star certainly lives up to its reputation.”

Although Fifth-Order Monster Beasts were not anything special on their own, if you wanted to fill the entire city with carriages pulled by them, at least tens of thousands would be necessary. This was not something an ordinary great force could achieve. Purple Star must have mastered some special techniques for breeding these Monster Beasts in captivity and had methods for domesticating them.

While talking to Hua You Meng, Yang Kai frowned suddenly and looked up into the sky.

Under his gaze, the roof of the carriage was as good as glass, unable to block his sight at all.

“What happened?” Hua You Meng asked in surprise when she saw his expression change.

“Is fighting allowed in Purple Star City?” Yang Kai asked rhetorically.

“Of course not. Is there some blind fool trying to act presumptuously here?” Hua You Meng was shocked.

“Interesting,” Yang Kai smiled slightly before stretching out his hand and releasing an invisible field around the carriage to shield it.

The next moment, there was a violent series of noises in the sky, accompanied by several explosions.

Hua You Meng’s face changed as she suddenly became slightly nervous.

Although she was not affected by the aftermath of the fight because of Yang Kai’s protection, she was also a Third-Order Origin Realm cultivator and realized that it was an Origin King who had acted just now.

She finally understood why Yang Kai did what he just did. Obviously, he was trying to avoid having the Monster Beast pulling their carriage become startled.

Because after this battle, the Snow Treading Colts pulling other carts were neighing and running about chaotically while the cart she and Yang Kai were in was safe.

This scene puzzled the driver of their carriage greatly.

However, the battle ended just as quickly as it began, and by the time Hua You Meng released her Divine Sense to investigate, no one remained up in the sky. All that was there was a damaged Starship.

“Hm? Is that...” Hua You Meng’s brow furrowed as she quickly opened the curtains of the carriage and looked up, a moment later her complexion changed greatly as she quickly sat back down.

“What did you find?” Yang Kai asked.

Hua You Meng looked at him and said, “If I’m not mistaken, that Starship belongs to Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce.”

“Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, are you sure?” Yang Kai was stunned.

“En, the emblem on that Starship is definitely Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce’s!” Hua You Meng nodded sincerely.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense again to confirm this and soon found that just as Hua You Meng said, the somewhat damaged Starship did have a special emblem on it that he vaguely remembered seeing embroidered on Xue Yue and Ni Guang’s robes.

[Was this Starship really from Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce?]

[So, just now, the cultivators of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce fought with Purple Star?]

After being silent for a moment, Yang Kai asked, “Why is a Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce Starship in Purple Star City?”

Hua You Meng smiled, “Although Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce is a massive super force, it’s primary focus is still commerce. In this Star Field, wherever there are cultivators, there will be their business opportunities. Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce coming to Purple Star City isn’t strange, but as for why the two sides suddenly fought, that is not something this Mistress can speculate on.”

Yang Kai gently nodded, checked the Starship one last time, then set the matter aside.

No matter what kind of friction there was between these two super forces, as long as it didn’t affect his plan, he didn’t care.

The carriage continued to move forward steadily, at a speed like that of the wind.

After a while, the pair arrived at a huge auction house.

After getting off the carriage, Hua You Meng pointed to the front and said, “This is Clear Sky Auction House. It is also one of the three largest auction houses in the outer city and its reputation is quite loud. I heard that they will be holding an auction in five days with many rare items appearing.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly before turning his head and glancing at Hua You Meng and asking, “President Hua, why do you seem a little nervous? Is this the first time you’ve come here”

Hua You Meng flashed a wistful smile as she replied, “It’s not the first time I’ve been here. I’ve been here several times, in fact, to participate in auctions, but I’ve rarely won anything as the prices are simply too high for this Mistress to afford. However, this is the first time I’ve been here to sell something... Perhaps, it will also be the last.”

“I’m with you, so don’t be afraid!” Yang Kai cast an encouraging look at her.

Hearing what Yang Kai said, Hua You Meng calmed down immediately, remembering that she was being accompanied by an Origin King, and an extraordinary one at that. Even Lu Tian Feng had to treat this Sir with respect, so although Clear Sky Auction House was a powerful force, she was here to auction a valuable item, so they should not embarrass her, right?

Moreover, the reason why she pulled Yang Kai along was that she wanted to use his identity as a deterrent, otherwise, if her tiny Five Paths Chamber of Commerce were to suddenly take out so many land deeds, it would likely cause lots of trouble.

Considering all this, Hua You Meng immediately collected herself and stepped forward.
