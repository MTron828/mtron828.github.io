“You can stay here if you want, but it’ll cost you a thousand crystals per day,” the woman continued.

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched. He asked, “Didn’t we pay the ship fare already?”

Even though he wasn’t short on Source Crystals right now, he still couldn’t find this woman’s behaviour acceptable. Did she really have to charge them extra for the room? It seemed as though she was trying to milk them.

“The fare and the room fees are two different things. Would you want to stay in a free room if we had one?”

“What’s the difference?” Yang Kai was confused. [Even the rooms on this ship were divided between free ones and paid ones? But the room in front of us doesn’t seem to look decent, so why should we be charged for it?]

The woman explained, “This room is equipped with a special Spirit Purifying Array that can purify the Disruption Force in the Solitary Void Sealed World. Even though it isn’t a high-grade array, it can still be used to cultivate.”

[Used to cultivate?] Yang Kai finally understood why the cultivators on the ship were able to maintain their cultivation.

[So, it is because of this Spirit Purifying Array.] He had previously tried to cultivate in here and naturally knew what sort of damage the mysterious power in this world could do when it entered a cultivator’s body. It turned out that mysterious energy was called Disruption Force.

This one short sentence from this woman allowed Yang Kai to understand many things.

With that, it also made sense now for them to charge for the room. The Spirit Purifying Array could purify the strange Disruption Force in the air so the cultivator in the room would be able to absorb the World Energy without the impurities.

But Yang Kai soon realized that something was wrong, because the World Energy in this room was extremely thin, a far cry from the dense World Energy outside.

From the looks of it, this Spirit Purifying Array did not come without drawbacks. While it purified the Disruption Force, it also hindered the flow of World Energy.

Even though one would not be hurt by the Disruption Force if they cultivated here, it was still impossible to maintain their cultivation with such thin World Energy. Their cultivation could only slowly regress unless they could find another method to restore their Source Qi, such as Source Crystals or whatnot.

No wonder all the cultivators here looked to be lacking Source Qi. Despite being at the Dao Source Realm, Yang Kai could tell that these people simply wouldn’t be able to display their full strength at all.

“Are you staying or not?” The woman asked impatiently when she saw Yang Kai’s mind wandering.

“Yes, of course we’ll stay!” Yang Kai nodded hurriedly. Even if the grade of the Spirit Purifying Array here was poor, and the room was mediocre, the fact that the Disruption Force could be purified here was better than nothing.

Anyway, it’s not like he was short on Source Crystals; after all, he had just managed to secure hundreds of millions of Source Crystals from Yao Chang Jun’s Space Ring after killing him.

“You’ll have to pay for a month in advance. You get your balance back if we reach land before then, or pay extra if otherwise,” The woman extended her hand towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai no longer objected, taking out 40,000 Source Crystals and handing them to the woman.

The woman put the Source Crystals into her Space Ring with great haste and instructed, “Don’t wander around if you have no other business. We came out here on a mission and we’ll bring you to Clear Sky Island once we’re finished.”

Yang Kai nodded, “We understand.”

Only then did the woman turn around and walk out. When she reached the doorway, she suddenly stopped and turned her head to look at Yang Kai, “Are you curious as to why I brought you into this room to collect the Source Crystals?”

Yang Kai was stunned. He did not understand what she meant by asking this.

The woman snorted and did not continue speaking, instead just stretching out a hand to Yang Kai, “Give me one more Source Crystal and I’ll tell you the reason why.”

Veins started to pop on Yang Kai’s forehead. This woman was seriously obsessed with money, wanting Source Crystals for everything.

Though a little disgruntled, he took out a Source Crystal and tossed it towards the woman.

The woman caught it and sneered, “Watch carefully.”

As she spoke, she tossed the Source Crystal straight out of the room.

With a *ding*, the Source Crystal landed in the hallway. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Then, the next scene caused Yang Kai’s face to change. The Source Crystal had actually begun to dissolve at a rapid rate. In less than ten breaths, a whole piece of Low-Rank Source Crystal disappeared without a trace, dissipating into World Energy.

The woman coldly snorted, “If you’re new here, you’re new, don’t bother trying to act smart!”

After she said that, she went straight out and shut the door behind her.

Yang Kai’s face burned red. He knew that his lies had been seen through the moment he tried to take out the Source Crystals for her outside. Otherwise, if he was someone from here, how could he not even know this bit of common knowledge?

“Senior Brother...” Liu Xian Yun’s pretty face also changed slightly, “That Source Crystal...”

Yang Kai said frustratingly, “Source Crystals probably can’t be exposed outside of the Spirit Purifying Array, otherwise they’ll disappear quickly.”

The woman clearly wanted this last piece of Source Crystal to show him this.

“Does that mean they figured out we’ve just arrived here?”

Yang Kai smiled awkwardly, “Definitely, but that doesn’t matter. That woman seems a bit aloof, but I don’t think she’s a bad person. Let’s get some rest first. We’ll figure out how to get out of here once we reach that Clear Sky Island she mentioned.”

“En.” Liu Xian Yun nodded and found a place in the room to sit down in a cross-legged position.

.....

On the deck, two men immediately sprang up when the woman walked out and approached her on each side.

The man on the left had a huge scar on his face that ran from his cheekbone all the way down his mouth, appearing fierce and scary. The one on the right on the other hand had a rather stout round build and a fierce aura.

“Big Sister Ling, are those two... staying?” The man on the left asked softly, eyes flickering with a dangerous light. He could not help but stick out his tongue to lick his lips when he asked this question, as if there was a delicious meal placed in front of him.

“En,” Ling Yin Qin nodded. She looked at him and said coldly, “What’re you asking that for?”

The man on the right grinned meaningfully, “You already know the answer, Big Sister Ling. It was clearly that pair’s first time here in the Solitary Void Sealed World. Obviously, they’ve stumbled here by accident, but newcomers here always have a lot of good stuff on them.”

The man on the left nodded, “That’s right, Big Sister Ling. We only have several dozen Source Crystals left. If we don’t get any more, then our cultivations will start to regress. You also know how the situation on Clear Sky Island is. Now that two fat sheep suddenly stumbled onto us... Heh heh, we brothers just can’t help ourselves.”

“Is this what you two were planning, or is it the plans of everyone on the ship?” Ling Yin Qin paused in her steps and asked in a grim voice.

The man on the left scratched his head, “Even though they didn’t say anything, they’re definitely thinking the same thing. As long as Big Sister Ling gives the order, we’ll rush in there right now and tie them up!”

“What nonsense!” Ling Yin Qin shouted angrily, saliva spraying all over the scar-faced man’s face, “Control your greed and don’t give me any trouble!”

The scar-faced man wiped his face embarrassedly, “Big Sister Ling, we can just talk, no need to spit on me...”

Ling Yin Qin coldly snorted, “How about I throw you overboard so you can cool your head first?”

The scar-faced man jumped in fright and quickly waved his hands, “No, no, no thank you!”

Lin Yin Qin took a deep breath and said, “That man isn’t someone we should be messing with. Since you know they’re newcomers here, then you should know that nobody who just arrived here is to be underestimated. Unlike us who have lived here for a long time, their cultivations haven’t regressed yet, so they are able to use their full strength. That man is a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, so who on this ship can fight him? If we really start a fight here, several of our men are going to end up dead at least. Do you really want to see that happen?”

The two men looked at each other and were instantly much more clear-headed. They both shook their heads.

Ling Yin Qin continued, “The first rule of the Solitary Void Sealed World is that we should never pick unnecessary fights, remember that. The Source Qi that we consume cannot be so easily replenished.”

“Yes,” The two men seemed extremely submissive to Ling Yin Qin and answered her seriously when they heard her say that.

“What’s more, we still have a mission to finish out here. Rest assured, once our task is done, all of you will receive Source Crystals and cultivation resources.” While speaking, Ling Yin Qin took off her Space Ring and passed it to the scar-faced man, “I got 40,000 Source Crystals from that man just now, take them and distribute them to everyone. Each of you should get a good share out of this.”

“40,000!?” The two men were overjoyed, as if 40,000 Source Crystals was an amazing fortune for them.

This was simply unimaginable in the outside world. Any Dao Source Realm cultivator wouldn’t even spare a glance at 40,000 Low-Rank Source Crystals, but Source Crystals were a rare commodity here in the Solitary Void Sealed World.

Cultivators who live here year-round would naturally need to consume Source Crystals, but there were no Source Crystals to mine here. There was simply no way to make ends meet in the long run. Only cultivators who end up getting caught and dragged into this place would bring some Source Crystals with them.

But not many cultivators ended up here each year, and the number of Source Crystals they brought with them was an even greater uncertainty. How could this be enough for the several hundreds of thousands of people living in Clear Sky City?

These 40,000 Source Crystals were a huge sum for the cultivators aboard this ship.

And yet, Ling Yin Qin had handed this over without hesitation to share with everyone. This was the reason why a woman like her was able to get the whole ship to yield to her and obey her orders.

Ling Yin Qin never hid anything for herself, and this kind of virtue was enough to gain everyone’s respect.

“Tell our brothers not to have any funny thoughts about those two, and don’t reveal their origins when we return to Clear Sky City. If you want Source Crystals, get it from them the proper way. Our mission is going to be a long one. If you use the right method, then you may be able to get some Source Crystals out of them.” Ling Yin Qin warned them again, still not completely assured. She was clear about the type of men she had working under her.

“Got it, Big Sister Ling.” The two were overjoyed at her words. After shooting a glance at each other, they immediately rushed into the cabin.

Not long after, the scar-faced man returned and handed the ring back to Ling Yin Qin, “Big Sister Ling, we left 10,000 Source Crystals for you. The rest we’ve split up with the boys. Heh heh, everyone said they’ll have to thank Big Sister Ling for this reward!”

Ling Yin Qin snorted, “I’ll be thanking the Heavens as long as you don’t bring me any trouble.”

“No, no, absolutely not!” The scar-faced man responded seriously.
