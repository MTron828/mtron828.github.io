Sweat, Strength, Success

A few months ago, Lu Si had gone to Hidden Cloud Peak, handed Yang Kai’s letter and jade slip to Xiao Fu Sheng, and Grandmaster Xiao had immediately refined that Mysterious Grade pill for him. After taking that pill and refining its medicinal effects, Lu Si’s meridians were completely healed and he at last truly became an Above Immortal Ascension Boundary powerhouse.

After returning to the Lu Family, Lu Si called Lu Liang and explained some secrets to him.

As for what the Grand Elder said to the Patriarch, no one else knew, but all of the Elders in the family could feel that after Lu Si’s return, Lu Liang’s opinion of Yang Kai had changed greatly. It was also because of this that he had so refreshingly ordered Lu Song to bring such a large amount of gifts to the Central Capital to offer Yang Kai.

Lu Song was unaware that all of these twists and turns had even taken place so to this day he still didn’t understand why his father had given such orders.

“If that Yang Kai is eliminated from the Inheritance War so quickly, what’s the point in giving him these things?” Lu Song said as he shook his head in annoyance, muttering under his breath, “It will be such a waste!”

The guard next to him eventually relented, “Young Master, how about we wait and see how that Yang Kai performs? In any case, Patriarch had only said that we must deliver him these things, he didn’t say when. If he can’t even last one day, then these materials will be useless to him and we’ll act according to Young Master’s plans. If he does manage to survive though, we should follow the Patriarch’s instructions and deliver these things to him.”

“Good, we’ll do that,” Lu Song nodded in approval, “If he were to lose on the first day of the Inheritance War, then he’ll definitely have no future in the Yang Family. Such a person, my Lu Family doesn’t need to fear.”

“It is just as the Young Master says!” The guard also nodded.

War City northwest corner, Yang Kai’s mansion.

In one of the rooms, Yang Kai was sitting lazily, a pretty maidservant serving him tea, after Yang Kai took a sip, he casually waved to dismiss her.

Before the maidservant left, her eyes glanced towards Qu Gao Yi and Ying Jiu in fear.

The conditions of the two Blood Warriors had gotten worse and worse over the past few days, especially after Yang Kai had sent them out to help subdue the North City district’s small forces. Their vitality drained quickly and their injuries noticeably worsened, even if they took the Yang Family’s special healing pills they would have little effect.

Their foundations had been compromised!

About this, both Yang Kai and they were very clear. So long as their foundations weren’t shaken, with their cultivation realm and inherent blood force, they would still have had a chance to recover.

At this moment, the two Blood Warriors were pale white and their bodies were constantly sweating. They were enduring severe pains all the time. The faces of the two men alternated between stern and fierce, blue veins throbbing on the foreheads like wriggling worms.

If any ordinary person saw this, they would naturally be terrified.

In spite of all this though, the two of them continued to stand there, straight and motionless.

Yang Kai looked up at them, his eyes filled with admiration.

He was also a very strong willed person, his temperament quite determined, but when he thought about himself enduring the same treatment as these two Blood Warriors, he felt that he wouldn’t be able to do better than them.

At the very least, watching a Young Lord who didn’t seem to see them as people but instead just wanted to squeeze whatever final value he could from them before their vitality passed, that alone would be something Yang Kai could never accept.

But the two Blood Warrior’s loyalty to the Yang Family made them feel no complaints. Not only did they not complain, even their expressions didn’t betray any bitterness, only steadfastly fulfilling their oath to serve Yang Kai without the slightest hint of displeasure.

Feeling Yang Kai’s gaze upon them, Qu Gao Yi and Ying Jiu did their best to straighten themselves up.

After a long time, Yang Kai let out a laugh, “Which of you is Qu Gao Yi?”

To be honest, Yang Kai really didn’t know who was who, because after he came back from the Blood Warrior Hall that day, he hadn’t exchange a single word with either of them.

When the two Blood Warriors heard this question, their expressions didn’t change in the slightest, the taller of the two who also had a broader stature quickly cupped his fists, “Subordinate is Qu Gao Yi!”

“Then you must be Ying Jiu?” Yang Kai looked at the other person.

Ying Jiu nodded lightly. Between the two Blood Warriors, Ying Jiu was more distinct, because although he was a man, his physique was slim and lean, the short mustache adoring his face giving him a particularly shrewd look. His personality was reticent and taciturn, in some ways he resembled Yang Kai’s Eldest Brother Yang Wei.

From the words of the Yang Family Fourth Master and Dong Su Zhu, Yang Kai already knew what fields these two Blood Warriors specialized in.

Qu Gao Yi was best at the rapid outbursts of power. He can completely expend his True Qi and Spiritual Energy in a short stick of incense worth of time. Once he entered a fight, he would unleash a torrent of attacks that wouldn’t give his opponent time to breathe. Within a stick of incense worth of time, he was basically invincible among those in the same realm.

(Silavin: stick of incense: 15mins)

In terms of instantaneous power, he was the strongest in the entire Blood Warrior Hall! Although he was an Immortal Ascension Boundary Eighth Stage, but over the years, the number of Peak Immortal Ascension masters he had defeated was a lot.

Even considering the entire Blood Warrior Hall, his strength was relatively high.

Ying Jiu was completely different as his specialties were speed and stealth, able to hide in the shadows and strike when least expected, he could often defeat his opponents before they even realized his presence.

There were rumors that the most difficult person to handle in the Bood Warrior Hall was not the Hall Master Feng Sheng nor the Deputy Hall Master Zhou Feng, but the shadow-like Ying Jiu.

Anyone stared at by him, even if he fled to the ends of the earth, could not escape his pursuit.

When these two worked together they complemented each other’s abilities perfectly, giving them a reputation as slaughterers amongst the Blood Warrior.

Previously, when the two of them were escorting the Yang Family’s Fourth Young Lord Yang Xin Wu they were besieged by a large number of Immortal Ascension Boundary masters. The enemy’s strength was even higher than group encountered by Yang Kai.

Qu Gao Yi and Ying Jiu put up a desperate fight but unfortunately Yang Xin Wu’s own strength wasn’t high so he had not managed to escape.

Yang Kai suddenly speaking to them confused Qu Gao Yi and Ying Jiu, both of them wondering what instructions he had to give, quickly composing themselves as they awaited their orders.

“Do you have any complaints about me?” To their surprise, Yang Kai didn’t give them new orders but actually asked such a question.

As he spoke, Yang Kai smiled and stared at the pair deeply.

Qu Gao Yi quickly replied, “Subordinate doesn’t dare.”

“Are you sure there’s nothing?” Yang Kai sneered lightly, “I want to hear the truth.”

Qu Gao Yi couldn’t help but look a little embarrassed as he glanced towards Ying Jiu, both of them not sure what to say.

Back at the Blood Warrior Hall, the two had listened to Tu Feng and Tang Yu Xian about how outstanding the Little Lord was and how he treated the Blood Warriors benevolently, and how later Yang Kai had agreed to use the two of them as in their moment of desperation.

With Tu Feng and Tang Yu Xian’s high praise and Yang Kai’s willingness to support them, Qu Gao Yi and Ying Jiu naturally felt incredibly grateful to him and secretly decided to assist Yang Kai in making a name for himself, even if they were to lose their lives they wouldn’t hesitate.

After accompanying him these days though, Yang Kai had never met eyes with them, his attitude towards them extremely cold, not even allowing them time to rest and recover.

The Blood Warriors had pledged undying loyalty to the Yang Family, but they were still only human! Them being willing to sacrifice themselves yet receiving such harsh treatment from Yang Kai would obviously make them feel uncomfortable.

“Speak freely,” Yang Kai took another sip from his cup as he stared at them seriously.

Qu Gao Yi eventually licked his cracked lips and said, “Ying Jiu and I had already given up on ourselves when the Little Lord extended his hand to us! It was the Little Lord who gave us a reason and a place to continue to serve, so regardless of how we have been treated we would never dare to complain to the Little Lord, we are just... slightly disappointed!”

The words he spoke were earnest and his expression firm, it was obviously his heartfelt opinion.

Yang Kai calmly incited, “Do you think that I am different from what Tu Feng described?”

Qu Gao Yi and even the unsociable Ying Jiu nodded lightly.

“Of course I treated you differently, because I didn’t want you to begin with!” Yang Kai stood up, “I wanted Tu Feng and Yu Xian. After all, we were already familiar with one another!”

The two Blood Warrior’s expressions dimmed slightly at these words.

“But the two of you have followed me for some time now so I think we are at least somewhat familiar with each other.” Yang Kai looked at the two and smiled, “At the very least, I understand what you really think.”

Qu Gao Yi and Ying Jiu faces brightened once more as they stared forward silently. Yang Kai saying this was equivalent to telling them that he wanted to open a dialogue with them, something the two of them very much hoped for.

“Your loyalty to the Yang Family and your gratitude towards me, are emotions that I no longer doubt!” Yang Kai raised his brow and grinned, “But if there is a day when I find myself in conflict with the Yang Family, what will you do? How would you choose? Would you stand by my side, or would you side with the Yang Family?”

The two men’s faces changed greatly as they looked at Yang Kai with amazement.

“Is the Little Lord making a joke?” Qu Gao Yi asked, frowning.

“I’m serious,” Yang Kai stared at him firmly and sharply.

Qu Gao Yi took a deep breath before replying, “Although I hope such a day never comes, but if it does, I and Ying Jiu will still follow the Little Lord!”

Ying Jiu also took the rare step of expressing himself, “Without the Little Lord, the two of us may have already wasted ourselves and retreated to the mountains, so our lives already belong to the Little Lord, if the Little Lord has need of us we will not hesitate to act.”

Listening to their responses, Yang Kai grinned meaningfully.

The reason why they had said this was firstly because Yang Kai was also a member of the Yang Family, so they didn’t believe such a situation would ever arise. Secondly, because saying so now wouldn’t create problems for them, even if such a day came, they could worry about it then.

But in any case, Yang Kai finally got the answer he wanted.

“I once told Yu Xian, those who know my secrets either become my people or become corpses!” Yang Kai’s grinned fiercely, “Now you are qualified to know so of my secrets.”

Qu Gao Yi and Ying Jiu glanced at each other before looking at Yang Kai with some surprise, not knowing what he was trying to say.

“Each of you take one of these pills.” Yang Kai reached into his sleeve and threw two pills out.

Qu Gao Yi and Ying Jiu reached out and thanked Yang Kai, but still felt puzzled.
