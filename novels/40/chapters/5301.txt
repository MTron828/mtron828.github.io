Huang Si Niang understood instantly, “No wonder. Since you’re not from any of them, it’s to be expected that you don’t know much about such things. Every Divine Spirit possesses their own unique Bloodline Talent, an innate Talent that is distinct from that of your Human Race. Just like how the Bloodline Talent of the Phoenix Clan is the Dao of Space, the Bloodline Talent of the Dragon Clan is the Dao of Time. If not, how could the Dragon and Phoenix Clans become the leaders of all Divine Spirits?”

Yang Kai’s eyes widened so much in shock that they almost fell out, “The Bloodline Talent of the Dragon Clan is the Dao of Time?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Huang Si Niang became more confused, “You don’t even know that? Then, do you cultivate the Dao of Time?”

“I do.” He nodded.

“That should be expected. If you don’t have a Dragon Source or have Dragon Clan Blood in your, how would you be able to cultivate the Dao of Time?”

Yang Kai became speechless upon her saying this, but instinctively, he felt something was wrong.

His cultivation of the Dao of Time was not heavily influenced by his Dragon Vein or his Dragon Source. Instead, it all began for him with a piece of the inheritance left behind by Flowing Time Great Emperor. The opportunity he met by chance previously helped him comprehend the Time Flies Seal Divine Ability, which allowed him to begin cultivating the Dao of Time. After much studying, cultivation, and some other opportunities, he had reached his current level of proficiency in the Dao of Time. What did any of that have to do with the Dragon Clan?

But if he thought about it further, since the Dragon Clan’s Bloodline Talent was the Dao of Time, it could be argued that his success in the Dao of Time was due to his Bloodline Talent.

It made Yang Kai confused about whether his comprehension of the Dao of Time was due to his Dragon Clan bloodline, or his own talent.

Suddenly, he shook his head, “Wait, Si Niang, before I came to the No-Return Pass, I met quite a number of Dragon Clan members, but only one of them was proficient in the Dao of Time. In fact, forget being proficient at it, they didn’t even have a foundation in it. How can this be explained?”

“You met Dragon Clan members in other places?” Huang Si Niang was taken aback.

Yang Kai gave a serious nod. He was referring to Zhu Qing’s branch of the Dragon Clan. There weren’t many Dragon Clan members on Dragon Island in the Star Boundary at any one time, but there were always a few, yet none of them had ever cultivated the Dao of Time before Yang Xiao.

Now, all those Dragon Clan members had travelled with Yuan Chu to the Divine Spirit Ancestral Land, located in the depths of the Shattered Heaven, to continue their cultivation. Since it had been such a long time, they should all have grown stronger.

Some of them might even have advanced to become Grand Dragons.

Feng Liu Lang, who had been silent up until now, cut in, “It’s not surprising that there are Dragon Clan members roaming about outside. My forefathers once told me that there were other Dragon Clan members that committed mistakes and were exiled from the Ancestral Land as a result.”

Huang Si Niang appeared to have remembered this as she casually nodded.

“The ones you met must have been Young Dragons,” he continued while turning to face Yang Kai.

“Why Young Dragons?” Yang Kai inquired humbly.

Yang Kai was quite knowledgeable about Grand Dragons as they were equivalent to High-Rank Open Heaven Masters in their Dragon Forms which were at least 10,000 metres long. But, what about Young Dragons?

Huang Si Niang smiled and explained, “Anyone below the Grand Dragon rank is considered a Young Dragon.”

Yang Kai understood instantly. It was pretty much what he thought, but the Dragon Clan’s hierarchy was really thoughtless; everything only depended on the size of their true body and their strength. If any Dragon Clan member was unable to breakthrough to become a Grand Dragon, would they only be able to stay a Young Dragon for their entire life?

However, it was clear that nothing of the sort would occur. The Dragon Clan was extremely talented, so even if they did not cultivate and only lazed about all the time, their strength would keep increasing over time regardless. They would eventually be strong enough when they had reached a sufficient age.

The Human Race was incomparable in this aspect.

Once more, Yang Kai questioned, “What about the Dragons above the Grand Dragon rank?”

“Above the Grand Dragons are the Ancient Dragons,” Huang Si Niang stated.

Young Dragons, Grand Dragons, and Ancient Dragons were the three standard divisions of the Dragon Clan.

Yang Kai had a vague feeling that the three old Dragon Clan members he had met before were Ancient Dragons. If Young Dragons corresponded to the realms below the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, and Grand Dragons corresponded to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, then Ancient Dragons should at least correspond to the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

This suggested that the Dragon Clan was likely running out of talent as there were only three Ancient Dragons in such a large Clan. If things continued in this manner, the Clan would eventually go extinct.

“According to what Si Niang said just now, I assume that Young Dragons are not proficient in the Dao of Time?”

“Not only the Dragon Clan, but nearly all Divine Spirits are this way. The three stages of our long life are the development stage, the adolescent stage, and the mature stage. The Young Dragons fall under the Dragon Clan’s developmental stage. As long as they enhance their Dragon Vein, they will inevitably become stronger and larger. When a Young Dragon becomes a Grand Dragon, their Bloodline Talent will fully awaken and they will be able to master the Dao of Time. The same goes for the Phoenix Clan, but the only difference is that our Talent is the Dao of Space,” Huang Si Niang replied.

“So, that’s how it is…” Yang Kai instantly understood the reason Zhu Qing and the others still had no grasp over the Dao of Time. Though the Dragon Clan was considered very strong in the Star Boundary, they were still just Young Dragons. Their Bloodline Talent in regards to the Dao of Time was still dormant and would only slowly awaken when they had grown to become Grand Dragons.

This made Yang Kai suddenly think of his Adopted Son, the little White Dragon, Yang Xiao.

Raising a brow, he asked again, “Are there any exceptions?”

Huang Si Niang smiled, “Exceptions are always possible. Some have their Bloodline Talents awaken while they are still Young Dragons. They are regarded as extremely gifted individuals; however, in the lengthy history of the Dragon Clan, such individuals could be counted within 5 fingers.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but frown upon her answer. If that was the case, Yang Xiao seemed to be quite the gifted one.

Yang Kai deserved some credit for the birth of this boy as Yang Xiao’s dragon egg appeared to have some kind of accident after Fu Zhun gave birth to him. Yang Xiao had been unsuccessful in breaking free of his shell, resulting in his vitality growing thinner and thinner over time. Fortunately, when Yang Kai went to Dragon Island at that time to stir up trouble, he ‘unintentionally’ found the location of Yang Xiao’s dragon egg.

In order to hatch him, Yang Kai put in a great deal of effort.

As a result, this young boy had a natural sense of closeness to him and had known him as though Yang Kai was his Father, now Adopted Father, since birth. In addition to that, the relationship between Yang Kai and Dragon Island softened up a bit thanks to Yang Xiao.

Soon after his birth, this young boy demonstrated his talent in the Dao of Time. Yang Kai initially believed it was because of his own comprehension; after all he used a lot of his own Blood Essence when Yang Xiao was being hatched, so naturally, inheritance from Yang Kai was to be expected.

Yet, it appeared now that this was not inheritance from his Blood Essence.

This was unmistakably a Dragon Clan Bloodline Talent; yet, Yang Xiao had it since birth while other Dragon Clan members had to reach the Grand Dragon stage in order to awaken it.

Later, Yang Xiao and Yang Xue received Flowing Time Great Emperor’s Legacy Inheritance, became his Inheritance Disciples and gained possession of the Flowing Time Temple. Looking back now, it was as though everything was predetermined. The Bloodline Talent of the Dragon Clan was the Dao of Time, and Yang Xiao had become the Disciple of Flowing Time Great Emperor, which would greatly help him with his future cultivation.

Yang Xiao was clearly one of the few exceptions that Huang Si Niang spoke of. Of course, this was not limited only to the Dragon Clan, but also other Divine Spirits. There were always some existences that showed their uniqueness at a very young age and these existences would somehow achieve great things one day.

The trip to the No-Return Pass had been well worth it for Yang Kai.

Even just learning this information from Huang Si Niang was a very valuable; not to mention, he had something waiting for him on the Dragon Clan’s side as well.

Was his mastery of the Dao of Time thanks to his own talent or due to his Dragon Clan Bloodline?

After giving it some thought, he believed that it might be both. If so, Su Yan might be able to awaken her Phoenix Clan Bloodline Talent once she got strong enough. By then, she would be able to master the Dao of Space as well.

This was very exciting news to him.

His cultivation of the Dao of Space, however, must be the result of his own talent; after all, he lacked the Phoenix Clan Bloodline, so he could not have gotten influenced by it.

Looking at the long feather in his hand, Yang Kai said, “This Junior dares not accept such a precious gift so lightly. Si Niang, is there any way that I can assist you in exchange for this gift?”

Although it was only a feather from the Phoenix Clan, Yang Kai valued it highly. He would undoubtedly benefit if he used this feather to further understand and cultivate the Dao of Space because it carried insights of the Phoenix Clan’s intrinsic talent in the Dao of Space.

This was a precious opportunity, so Yang Kai couldn’t just take it for nothing.

Unexpectedly, Huang Si Niang covered her mouth and giggled, “I don’t need help with anything. This is only a prize. You should just keep it.”

Yang Kai sensed that it wasn’t quite right for him to simply accept the gift, but since she had said so much, he couldn’t object to it either. This gift was just too alluring and he also believed that the Phoenix Clan wouldn’t try to harm him.

Even if Huang Si Niang would ask him to do something by bringing up this gift matter later, he would comply under the condition that it didn’t go against his own principles.

Such was what he thought in his heart to repay her. Nevertheless, he still stated for show, “It’s not appropriate for me to be rewarded for nothing, is it?”

Huang Si Niang took a deep look at him and saw through his thoughts. With a snicker, she stated, “You just said that you dare not reject a gift from your Seniors and now you say you shouldn’t be rewarded for nothing? Humans really don’t know what they want, huh?”

Yang Kai let out a dry laugh upon hearing that.

“If you really feel bad, let me ask you a question. This feather would serve as a reward if you answered me,” stated Huang Si Niang.

Yang Kai straightened up his position, “Si Niang, please ask.”

“What technique did you use to defeat Ji Lao San just now?”

As soon as those words left his mouth, Feng Liu Lang looked over curiously as well. Though they were both strong, they couldn’t understand how Ji Lao San ended up that way.

Ji Lao San clearly had superior momentum in that confrontation. Moreover, it was incredible that a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was able to effortlessly capture a Grand Dragon who was approaching 50,000 metres twice.

It was impossible for a Divine Spirit to be so vulnerable, let alone someone from the Dragon Clan.

Though they were just spectating for fun previously, the defeat of Ji Lao San more or less embarrassed both Clans. If word of this situation spread, people would start looking down on the Divine Spirits.

“Oh, I did not do anything in particular,” Yang Kai was surprised that the Phoenix Clan members brought up the subject first. He thought the Dragon Clan would be the ones asking about it, but since Huang Si Niang brought it up, he did not intend to keep it a secret. In that moment, he suddenly had a feeling that it would have some effect, but he did not know it would have such a strong impact on the Dragon Clan until he tried it.
