“You dare kill someone in front of this King? Impudence!” Qiu Ze was enraged and grit his teeth as a furious look covered his face.

If word got out that Luo Jin was killed despite him personally suppressing Yang Kai, then everyone would probably think he was only a paper tiger. This was his first battle since advancing to the Emperor Realm, so Qiu Ze had come expressly to show off his might, but he didn’t expect things to go the other way.

Yang Kai killing Luo Jin was equal to slapping him in the face. How could Qiu Ze bear such humiliation?

After he spoke, Qiu Ze flicked his wrist and a blood-red spear appeared in his hand. It could be surmised at a glance from the dense fluctuation of energy coming from the spar that it was a Dao Source Grade High-Rank artifact, and was connected with Qiu Ze’s mind and soul through his own blood.

Qiu Ze had only just advanced to the Emperor Realm and did not have an Emperor Artifact on hand, but if given enough time to refine and nurture this spear, then it was not impossible for it to advance into an Emperor Artifact.

Unfortunately, he didn’t have the time.

It was not very honourable for him to use an artifact against someone in the Dao Source Realm, but Qiu Ze didn’t care about that right now.

With his spear in hand, Qiu Ze’s imposing manner increased once more. The aura of the blood-red spear was closely linked with him, and the two seemed to completely fused into one entity with both mind and soul connected. Qiu Ze shouted and made the first move, trying to save face by killing Yang Kai in a single blow.

*Chi...*

Countless blood-red spears made of light shot out towards Yang Kai like a cloud of locusts. The entire sky had become as red as blood as the murderous intent and violent power spread out, causing horrified looks to arise on everyone’s faces.

Yang Kai waited for the right opportunity to use his Myriads Sword. Sword Intent flashed as a sword made out of light appeared and he shouted, “Myriad Sword Arts, One Man As A Mountain!”

He was right between Qiu Ze and Chi Yue and the others at this moment, so Yang Kai could not dodge Qiu Ze’s attack. If he had moved away, then Chi Yue and the others would definitely be enveloped by the spear shadows.

Not only was Qiu Ze trying to launch a sneak attack, but he was also cleverly using Yang Kai’s concern towards Chi Yue and the others against him, which was a despicable act.

A normal Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator would’ve been powerless to resist and would definitely be crushed to pieces by this move.

But Yang Kai had an Emperor Artifact and the defensive stance he performed was greatly effective in neutralizing Qiu Ze’s power.

*Hong hong hong...*

Spear and Sword Qi clashed mid-air, energy surging turbulently, shaking the Heavens and Earth.

Qiu Ze’s expression changed abruptly as he was forced back a step. With a flourish of his spear, he crushed a Moon Blade hidden inside the Sword Waves made of light into dust.

On the opposite side, Yang Kai did not retreat, but following several slicing sounds, blood splashed out from all over his body. Obviously, he had suffered a small loss during this trade of blows.

Qiu Ze was still an Emperor Realm Master, after all, so being able to exchange blows with him was already enough to prove his strength. If Yang Kai really came out of this unharmed, that would truly be too terrifying.

“Little brat, you dare play tricks against this King? Shameless!” Qiu Ze was shaken inside, but he did not show it on his face. He did not see the true appearance of the Moon Blade earlier because of how hurriedly he had struck. All he knew was that the attack was silent and extremely well hidden.

Yang Kai curled his lip, “Don’t you feel yourself blushing saying things like that, old fart?”

Qiu Ze naturally knew what he meant, but had no intention of arguing with him. Drawing his spear, another powerful move appeared, shattering the skies and shooting straight towards Yang Kai’s face.

Yang Kai was enraged seeing this. This old fart knew he couldn’t dodge at will, so the heavy hits he was constantly throwing at him was so he could force him to engage in a head-on clash. If Chi Yue and the others were not behind him, then of course Yang Kai would dodge rather than fight, but there was simply no way he could put aside their safety.

Yang Kai wasn’t the only one who understood this situation, everyone else saw this clearly too. Ruan Hong Bo and the others had awkward expressions on their faces. They were secretly thinking to themselves that Qiu Ze didn’t have the air of an Emperor Realm Master at all, he was simply as shameless as a scoundrel.

But they were all tied to the same rope now, so they didn’t dare to say anything even if they saw it.

“Give an inch and you want a mile... You shameless old dog!” Yang Kai bellowed at him and poured his Source Qi into his Myriads Sword, meeting him in battle.

As the blade passed, the spears made of light were broken apart, instantly disintegrating.

This time, Qiu Ze’s face greatly changed. He could have never imagined that a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator could match him in a contest of strength. If he did not have the burden of protecting his companions behind him, then wouldn’t Yang Kai be completely beyond his depth?

After breaking Qiu Ze’s attack, Yang Kai did not dally for even a moment. He flicked his fingers, sending ten Moon Blades whistled over.

Qiu Ze’s pupils shrank. This time, he could clearly feel the rich, fluctuating Space Principles contained within the black blades. This made it impossible for him to grasp the trajectory of the Moon Blades’ attack.

“Space Principles?” Qiu Ze exclaimed, his body shivering. Emperor Pressure burst out and formed a domain spanning ten metres around him.

Within this domain, he could finally identify the trajectory of the Moon Blades’ attack and he moved his spear to break them.

In an instant, Qiu Ze was drenched in cold sweat, a shocked expression on his face.

He was not too alarmed when Yang Kai displayed extraordinary combat abilities. Even when they fought to a standstill, he only thought that Yang Kai was a rare talent, but when he realized that Yang Kai was this proficient in the Dao of Space, every fibre of his body was screaming something ominous was about to happen.

The Dao of Space was a rare and esoteric Dao. No need to even mention getting started with it, normal people couldn’t even be able to perceive it in the slightest. This had nothing to do with cultivation aptitude as there were also many Emperor Realm Masters in the Star Boundary, but how many of them actually comprehended the Dao of Space?

But this young man in front of him was able to use Space Principles against his opponent in battle. What did that prove? It meant that his attainments of the Dao of Space had already reached an incredible height. A man like this was certain to have a bright future, and in time, would rise to the peak of the world.

[If his cultivation were to grow any further, wouldn’t I be dead for sure?]

As this thought filled his mind, how could Qiu Ze still care about his face? The only thought in his mind was to cut weeds and pull out the roots. Thinking so, he bellowed, “What are you all waiting for? Attack him together!”

Only with his shout did everyone come to their senses. They had come to provoke the Thousand Leaves Sect, not to watch a show. What’s more, they had killed so many of Thousand Leaves Sect’s disciples already, so if they did not eradicate them here, Thousand Leaves Sect may rise again from the ashes.

“Palace Lord Qiu, I’ll help you!” A loud cry emerged as a figure flew over.

To everyone’s surprise, the first person to answer Qiu Ze’s call was neither Ruan Hong Bo nor Mu Zheng, but Thousand Leaves Sect’s Shi Cang Ying.

He looked like he held a deep grudge against the Thousand Leaves Sect and couldn’t wait to kill Yang Kai and the rest of the Sect right here and now. While speaking, he had already summoned his artifact and his Source Qi was surging wildly as he rushed towards Yang Kai.

Shi Cang Ying had already made his move, so how could Mu Zheng and Ruan Hong Bo just stand to the side and watch? They only hesitated for a moment before gritting their teeth and taking action. In a flash, the auras of a dozen Third-Order Dao Source Realm artifacts and Secret Techniques enveloped Yang Kai, launching towards him.

Even though Yang Kai was powerful and his strength increased even more after reaching the Third-Order, to the point of being able to fight with Qiu Ze without falling to a difficult position, it was only natural that two fists couldn’t block four strikes. He was instantly trapped and was unable to escape. It was a dangerous situation and in just three short breaths, his body was already battered and bloody.

After Yang Kai was trapped, the other cultivators from Sky Illumination Palace, White Clouds Tower, and Sky Peak Temple all joined in the fray and rushed towards Chi Yue and the others.

When she saw this, Hua Qing Si’s pretty face turned cold in an instant and she quickly said, “Sister Ye, bring them into the Sealed World!”

Ye Jing Han asked, “Then what about you?”

Hua Qing Si glanced at Liu Yan who was still sitting cross-legged on the ground and not moving, saying, “I have to stay here.”

No one knew what Liu Yan was doing, but she hadn’t moved since sitting down. Naturally, Hua Qing Si couldn’t just leave her here.

Unexpectedly, Ye Jing Han spoke back against her persuasion, “This concerns the life or death of our Thousand Leaves Sect. How could we possibly run away?”

Ye Hen also nodded, “That’s right. Even as an outsider, Young Master Yang was willing to help solve the problems of our Thousand Leaves Sect. As the Sect Master, how can this Ye just run from here? Even if this Old Master coughs up the last of his blood here, he will definitely not retreat!”

To his words, all the others nodded as well, looking prepared to risk their lives.

“You all are...” Hua Qing Si stomped her feet in anxiety, but once she saw how determined Ye Hen and the others were, she knew it was useless talking them out of this and could only turn to Chi Yue and the others.

Chi Yue smiled, “One more person is one extra source of strength. No need to persuade us, Elder Sister. It was a rare chance that we were able to reunite with Yang Boy. If we separate once more, I worry we will never see him again.”

Hua Qing Si sighed. She knew there was nothing she could say anymore, “Then watch out for yourselves!”

While they were speaking, the area where they were was already densely surrounded by cultivators. Only, they were watching them cautiously instead of rushing at them and they had no idea what these cultivators were scared about.

Right at this moment, a loud roar suddenly came from Yang Kai’s side. Yang Kai seemed to be truly enraged now. Following that roar, a dazzling light shot out from there, engulfing where Yang Kai was in an instant.

More than twenty Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators and an Emperor Realm Master had joined hands against him. How could Yang Kai hold them off?

During this critical moment, he could only teleport out and appeared in an instant in front of Hua Qing Si and the others.

The way he appeared without warning startled all of the cultivators gathered here, and they all backed away. Yang Kai was able to fight with Qiu Ze and even killed Luo Jin in one blow, so how could they not be afraid?

In an instant, a large area was vacated at the array base platform.

“As expected, the rumours are true. Being proficient in the Dao of Space has great benefits.” Qiu Ze’s slightly jealous tone came from the distance. Following that, the crowd took the initiative to move away. With Qiu Ze in the lead, a dozen Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators strolled over and stood several tens of metres before Yang Kai and the others.

Yang Kai spat disdainfully, an unruly look on his face. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Even though he could not defeat so many Masters, it was also impossible for these people to kill him. Moreover, after retreating to the Space Array, they could advance or retreat at will. There was nothing to worry about at all. If anything, he could just activate the Space Array and bring Chi Yue and the others to the Sealed World.

Moreover, Yang Kai hadn’t used any of his trump cards yet.

Previously, he was acting cautiously so he wouldn’t hurt any innocents, but now that the situation had developed to this point, there was nothing more to worry about.
