“Since you won’t have any regrets even in death, then you can die right now.”

When the fat cultivator was about to kiss Luo Bing, an ice-cold voice reverberated.

The fat and thin cultivators had been completely focused on their impending activities and their vigilance had been overwhelmed by their base instincts, so it wasn’t until they heard another person’s voice that they reacted in terror.

The fat cultivator leapt to his feet, but he didn’t get to see who was talking before he saw a fist coming at him. It was a fist covered in Saint Qi, exuding a vicious force.

He could clearly see the fist getting larger as it approached him, shrouding his entire vision. He wanted to dodge this strike, but couldn’t. It looked like his opponent’s cultivation vastly surpassed his...

*Peng...*

A soft noise echoed out, followed shortly by the fat cultivator’s miserable scream. His fat body had been sent flying through the air, and his head burst open like a watermelon soon after, spurting scarlet and white fluid around.

“Ah!”

When this incident had just begun, the thin cultivator let out a surprised cry, only to see his Brother quickly dying right in front of his eyes. Everything ended before he could respond.

He raised his head and saw that a muscular man had appeared at some point. The muscular man’s body was now drenched in blood, as if he had just come out of a battle. Half of his face was swollen and blood was dripping from it. It was a pretty ghastly sight and ordinary people wouldn’t dare to look straight at him, especially because one of the man’s eyes was completely white, without any pupils or iris. It was quite terrifying to behold!

“Who... Who are you?” When the thin cultivator swept this newcomer with his Divine Sense, his heart couldn’t help clenching because he discovered that he was a Third-Order Origin King.

The thin and fat cultivators were just First-Order Origin Kings, and the enemy’s cultivation was higher than theirs by two Minor Realms. The enemy didn’t look to be in his best state, but he was still able to kill the fat cultivator with a single punch; therefore, the thin cultivator knew he was no match for him.

“I’m the man who will send you to the underworld,” the muscular man snorted coldly and his large body instantly disappeared.

Upon seeing this, the thin cultivator shouted, “Friend, let’s have a civil conversion! We have no grievance or grudge with you, so why are you assaulting us?”

Even though he said so, the thin man had already summoned his defensive artifact, forming a luminous shield around himself.

The muscular man’s voice reverberated behind the thin man’s back, his voice cold and indifferent, like a whisper of a reaper of death, “What else is there to discuss with scum that oppresses people and assaults women? Die!”

As his voice fell, a sabre appeared in his hand. As he imbued his Saint Qi into it, it let out a sonorous roar while the phantom image of a giant tiger’s head appeared above the blade. This tiger phantom opened its maw to devour the thin man.

The thin man turned pale with fright and shouted sharply, “I’ll fight!”

His cultivation was lower than his opponents by two small realms, but if he gave it his all, then he might still have a chance to survive. The fat cultivator had gotten killed by a single punch only because he had been careless back then, and didn’t even get a chance to summon his artifact.

Now, he was protected by his defensive artifact, the thin man was sure he wouldn’t be killed so easily.

But, matters didn’t develop as he expected. As his opponent hacked him with his blade, all his defences were cut down and his body was quickly sliced apart.

“That’s... Impossible!” The thin man stood there in a daze. He took a look at the large wound that went from his shoulder to his belly, then gazed at the muscular man and said in a bitter voice, “Are you a Dao Source Master?”

A while ago, he clearly detected a special power possessed only by those in the Dao Source Realm coming out from this muscular man’s body. Meanwhile, his weapon was also a Dao Source Artifact. This was why he managed to so easily break through his defence and inflict a fatal wound upon him.

“You’ll die shortly, so why are you still so inquisitive?” The muscular man snorted coldly in response.

As his voice fell, the thin man’s blood spurted out like a fountain. His body had been chopped into two halves, and even his internal organs were exposed to the air.

A bloody smell started pervading the air!

Luo Bing laid on the ground with her body shivering and teeth chattering, while her eyes were wide open; however, a moment later she turned her head and began throwing up.

She had always lived like a princess and had never seen such a bloody sight before. She had been greatly shocked by it and couldn’t stomach it.

She didn’t recover until she had thrown up for a while. It felt like she had thrown up everything she had eaten. She turned around her pale face and looked at the muscular man with a grateful look, asking in a trembling voice, “Did they... Did they both die?”

The muscular man looked coldly at her with faint hatred flashing past his sole eye. He didn’t reply and just snorted coldly in response before putting away his sabre.

Shortly after, he walked toward Luo Bing and poked several points on her body.

Luo Bing’s cultivation had been unsealed and Saint Qi started flowing back into her meridians again. The young girl stood up, faltering, and looked in fright at the corpses of the thin and fat cultivators then averted her eyes off them and covered up her small mouth for a moment then started throwing up again.

The muscular man didn’t utter a word and just stood there in silence, observing everything coldly.

After a long while, Luo Bing raised her head and looked at the muscular man, “Thank you, thank you...”

She expressed her heartfelt thanks to him repeatedly.

After all, if the muscular man hadn’t shown up, then a miserable fate awaited her. She had never suffered such danger, and she had been praying for someone to save her at that precarious juncture.

Now, someone had really come to save her. Even though this person had a hideous and frightening look, Luo Bing didn’t find him scary for some unknown reason and she felt safe next to his large and muscular body. She felt that as long as she was under his protection, she would never suffer such dangers again.

This was a feeling she did not get even from her father or Qiu Yu.

The young girl’s heart started beating strongly, and some peculiar feelings started welling up in her heart.

“You... What’s your name?” Luo Bing looked timidly at the man and questioned him in a soft voice.

The muscular man cast a glance at her with his sole eye, as coldly as before.

Upon facing the man’s gaze, Luo Bing couldn’t help but shiver and she quickly lowered her head. She didn’t dare to look at him again.

“Chai Hu!” The muscular man suddenly blurted out his name.

Upon hearing this, Luo Bing was delighted and she raised her head with a smile, “So, it is Brother Chai, I’m Luo Bing, the City Lord’s daughter. Have you ever heard of me?”

After she said so, she was startled by her own actions.

Other than Qiu Yu, she had never called another man so intimately. Yet, in the face of this man, she called him ‘Brother’ so naturally. She felt at ease with him, and after she addressed him as such, she even felt a little delighted and excited, as if she had just done something exceptional.

[What’s wrong with me?] Luo Bing’s confusion was apparent in her pretty eyes.

“I know who you are,” Chai Hu replied calmly, then averted his gaze, as if he didn’t want to scare her with his hideous face. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“That’s a matter of course, even though I rarely go out, as long as you live in Sky Crane City, you must have heard of me.” Luo Bing pursed her lips and revealed a smile, a smile that brightened up the whole world around her.

Luo Bing hesitated for a moment then said, “Brother Chai, I have... gotten lost. Can you send me back home?”

She put on such a delicate act with her face still a little pale because of the terrifying ordeal she had just gone through. No man would be able to refuse her request!

Chai Hu nodded and said, “I can.”

Luo Bing was delighted and she said, “Many thanks.”

“But not today,” Chai Hu added coldly.

Luo Bing’s smile stiffened on her face and she looked in a daze at Chai Hu, then asked, “Brother Chai, what... What do you mean?”

Chai Hu said, “Young Lady Luo, I have to ask for your help with something and you’ll have to take a trip with me.”

Luo Bing was terrified and she couldn’t help but recall the way the previous two men had treated her. Her face, which had just regained some vigour, turned pale again and she shook her head repeatedly as she moved back, calling out in alarm, “You... You also want to do the same thing to me as those two men?”

“Nonsense, I won’t hurt you as long as you cooperate with me,” saying so Chai Hu stretched his hand toward Luo Bing.

“No!” Luo Bing shouted, but Chai Hu’s cultivation was a lot higher than even the previous two men’s, so how could she fight back? She was instantly restrained.

Luo Bing felt like she had just fallen into an ice hole. On this day, she had suffered more ordeals than what she had been through in her whole life. She had just gotten rid of wolves and didn’t expect that she had only made way for a tiger. She beat Chai Hu’s arm repeatedly and scolded, “You’re a bad man, a bad bad man! You’re all bad men!”

Chai Hu was unmoved and he just spoke coldly in response, “If you make another move, then I won’t be polite with you anymore.”

Upon hearing this, Luo Bing’s body stiffened, but she quickly opened her mouth and bit the back of Chai Hu’s hand.

Luo Bing bit him so forcefully and strongly that her mouth quickly was overflowing with blood, and a bloody odour started to reek from it, but she still didn’t let go of him despite this.

Chai Hu was a Third-Order Origin King. Therefore, if he wanted to get rid of Luo Bing, then he would just have to use a little bit of his force, and her teeth would shatter.

But, he didn’t do so for some unknown reason. He just stared at Luo Bing, who kept biting at his hand and swallowing down any blood coming her way. She had done so just to protect herself.

Upon seeing this, a complex gleam flashed past his eye, but Chai Hu quickly let out a sigh and raised his palm before chopping the back of Luo Bing’s neck.

He had a good grasp over his power, so after Luo Bing let out a soft groan, she just fell weakly to the ground. She had already lost consciousness, yet two trails of tears were still streaming down her face.

Soon after, Chai Hu lifted her like a sack and his body flickered, disappearing from where he stood, leaving behind the corpses of the fat and thin cultivators.

Inside Heavenly Puppet Workshop.

Yang Kai had just returned leisurely, only to see Ye Jing Han standing at the entrance, looking around anxiously. When she finally spotted Yang Kai, she heaved a sigh of relief and went toward him to ask, “Young Master Yang, where did you go?”

Yang Kai said, “I just took a stroll.”

Then cast a glance at Ye Jing Han and spoke with a smile, “What’s wrong? Were you afraid that I just left without bidding you farewell?”

Ye Jing Han waved her arms in denial, “No, not at all. I just didn’t see you and the others had no inkling as to where you had gone...”

Yang Kai spoke, “You can set your mind at ease, since I have already given you a promise, I won’t go back on my word. I wanted to notify you before leaving, but I noticed that someone else was in your room and didn’t want to disturb you, heh heh!”

Ye Jing Han’s face got flushed and she spat, “Hateful!”

She stomped her foot, then rushed into the inner hall, as if she was running away from him.
