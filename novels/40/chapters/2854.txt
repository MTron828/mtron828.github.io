A Sand Demon suddenly popped out of the ground, grabbed the injured Sha Ya, and burrowed back into the ground once more, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

How could she dare delay and wait for Yang Kai to launch another attack?

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense, and found Sha Ya’s aura speeding away, burrowing deeply into the ground and soon escaping his range of perception causing him to sigh.

This Sand Demon’s ability was really annoying and Yang Kai could not help frowning. Fortunately, these Sand Demons seemed to have relatively low sentience; otherwise, this special ability to burrow through the earth alone would be enough to overpower the Ancient Barbarians.

Sha Ya had escaped, and Yang Kai was unable to pursue her. There were bursts of rumbling noises from all directions. Obviously, other Demons had noticed the commotion or had received Sha Ya’s orders to come, wanting to overpower Yang Kai with numbers.

Bundles of black shadows loomed in the darkness, all of them resembling the short Demon from before, who had superior concealment and assassination skills.

But before they could do anything, Yang Kai had already plunged into the enemy lines with a grin like a tiger descending from the mountain. Blood flowers blossomed everywhere Yang Kai moved as he crushed the enemy like dry weeds and rotten wood. The scene was both beautiful and grotesque.

The shadows were thrown into a panic, and they quickly retreated into hiding.

Apart from these smaller Demons, muscular Demon Warriors rushed out of the surrounding corridors with their weapons raised, launching a bold and deadly charge towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai did not evade though and instead summoned his Myriads Sword. With a swing, the Demons who dared to pounce at him were cleanly cut into two, not a single one able to escape. Blood and organs flowed out and filled the cave with the pungent smell of death.

The outcome of that fierce battle was the completely unharmed Yang Kai and the loss of hundreds of Demons.

The Demons began to hesitate. The person in front of them was not someone they could contend with, and stepping forward was just a useless sacrifice; as such, they did not dare to come forward easily and instead froze in place with horrified expressions, looking at Yang Kai vigilantly.

“You’re not coming?” Yang Kai raised his sword as he grinned, “If you won’t, I will!”

The Demons did not answer.

Yang Kai moved, flickering around the cave at lightning speed, and when he returned to where he first stood, viscous blood was dripping from the Myriads Sword.

Figures fell to the ground silently.

Yang Kai sneered, “A bunch of trash!”

Just as he finished speaking, his face suddenly changed as a greenish tinge crept onto his cheeks and he cried out involuntarily, “That slut actually used poison on me? Shameless!”

The green tinge was like a living being that immediately started spreading to all parts of his body after its emergence. In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai had turned completely green.

Yang Kai was fuming.

“Hahahaha!” Sha Ya’s erratic laugh echoed loudly in the cave. She must be hiding somewhere in the cave to observe him and with Yang Kai’s current strength, it was impossible to locate her with his Divine Sense. Satisfied with her little trick, Sha Ya called out, “Green Demon Poison! Although Green Demons don’t have the strongest poison, out of the Hundred Clans of the Demon Race, their poison is the most mysterious and difficult to resist. Little Brother, you’re dead. Maybe you can beg me to turn you into a slave and live.”

Yang Kai frowned and pondered. He recalled that there was indeed a green coloured Demon, who looked a little different from the other Demons he killed just now. If that was the case, that Demon was the Green Demon that Sha Ya mentioned.

But Yang Kai did not notice any trace of an attack from it, and he did not have any actual contact with that Demon at all. But even so, Yang Kai was poisoned. The Green Demon Poison was truly mysterious and difficult to guard against. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

With a cold snort, Yang Kai growled in a low voice, “Sorry, but I have no interest in used goods.”

Sha Ya’s voice abruptly turned chilly, “I will slap all the teeth from your mouth and make you pay for your words!”

“Used goods, used goods, used goods! Your whole family is just a bunch of used goods!”

Sha Ya didn’t say another word, too angry to speak.

The area suddenly fell silent, with neither a trace of another Demon nor Sha Ya. Yang Kai curled his lip and mocked, “If you’re not coming out again, I’ll leave.”

There was still no response.

Yang Kai shrugged and with a flicker, disappeared from where he stood.

Long after they confirmed Yang Kai had left, Sha Ya slowly reappeared from the shadows, still naked, but her body no longer looked tender and charming like before. Instead, she was full of malice and rage, the chills radiating from her body even capable of freezing fire.

The black short Demon appeared beside her silently and asked nervously, “Madam, are we going to let that guy go just like that?”

Sha Ya coldly snorted, “You don’t want him to go?”

The short Demon replied, “He killed many of us.”

“Then, why didn’t you stop him just now?” Sha Ya turned to him and asked.

The short Demon looked embarrassed. [Even you refused to face such a madman, so what can I do with my pitiful strength? A reflexive punch from that guy almost took my life! I really can’t figure out how such force could be exerted from that thin-looking body.]

“Hmph, he’s poisoned with the Green Demon Poison. Unless he becomes a part of our Demon Race, he will die. Just wait, he’ll be back to beg me soon enough,” Sha Ya sneered confidently, her face looking smug.

The short Demon agreed after hearing that.

Although the Green Demon Clan held no significant position in the Demon Race’s Hundred Clans, only serving under the Charm Demon Clan, their poison was extremely lethal when used against non-Demons. Once affected by the Green Demon Poison, there was no other antidote than to be demonised.

Now that the terrifying thin Barbarian had been poisoned, there was no need to pursue him.

Sha Ya flickered and disappeared without a trace. The short Demon glanced at the corpses around him, and ordered with a sigh, “Throw these into the beast den!”

Many Sand Demons immediately appeared from the ground, carrying the fresh corpses without saying a word, transporting them to the beast den where they would obviously be turned into food for the Demon Beasts.

……

“Sir, what… what… what happened?”

A hundred kilometres away from the Demon Cave, Yang Kai appeared and a dozen Shamans looked at him in shock while all the surrounding Barbarian Warriors’ jaws dropped.

Yang Kai was currently entirely green and looked rather unusual. The great green glow coming from his head was particularly conspicuous amongst the crowd.

Such an appearance would make the crowd roll on the ground in laughter on other occasions, but everyone knew that Yang Kai had gone to the Demon Cave to gather information, and suddenly returned looking completely green. Something unexpected had obviously happened.

This shocked everyone, so how could they laugh? All eyes simply stared at Yang Kai nervously.

Yang Kai was the leader of this group and the spiritual pillar of everyone’s hearts. If anything unexpected happened to him, this army would become leaderless. In a war between two Races, how effective could an army be without its leader? Perhaps the Demon Race could wipe out the three thousand people in just one small counterattack.

“I was accidentally poisoned,” Yang Kai’s face darkened and with a wave of his hand he repelled the few Shamans who were about to approach him and ordered, “Don’t get too close to me, it could be contagious!”

[Contagious…]

Upon hearing this, the Shamans who were about to approach him instinctively retreated a few steps but immediately felt awkward after perceiving that this behaviour was not very appropriate.

“Is that the Green Demon Poison?” Yue suddenly asked.

“Huh?” Yang Kai looked at her in surprise, “How do you know?”

It was obvious that Yue was knowledgeable about this poison by guessing the name of this poison accurately. But even Yang Kai only knew about this just now, so how could Yue have known about it?

Yue nodded lightly, “So, it really is the Green Demon Poison.”

Lu continued, “Then there is no cure.”

The twins directly sentenced Yang Kai to death, and two pairs of beautiful eyes looked at him pitifully.

“How do you know about the Green Demon Poison?” Yang Kai asked again.

The twins glanced at each other before explaining, “There is an ancient book in the Shaman Divine Temple, which has some records of our previous conflict with the Demon Race. There is little information and it is not very comprehensive, but there is still some information about the Green Demons. We came across it accidentally while reading.”

[So it was from the Shaman Divine Temple.]

Yang Kai nodded lightly, from the knowledge he gained from Senior Qing ‘s inheritance, Yang Kai learned that this was not the first time that the Demon Race had invaded this world. In other words, the residents of this land had some dealings with the Demon Race before. It had been tens of thousands of years though, and over time, almost no one remembered what happened during that war. However, the Shaman Divine Temple was the most important place for the entire Ancient Barbarian Race, so it was only normal that it had some records about the Demon Race.

The oldest Shaman Apprentice of the Shaman Niu Clan trembled and asked, “Is there really no way to cure this Green Demon Poison in Sir Shaman Niu?”

Yue and Lu shook their heads simultaneously before Yue continued, “Although there is no way to get rid of it, you don’t have to worry about it being contagious. Green Demon Poison cannot be spread from person to person.”

As she spoke, she stepped forward to touch Yang Kai’s cheek to prove her statement. Yang Kai frowned, but did not avoid it. After Yue retrieved her hand, there was really no trace of contamination.

This was a small piece of good news.

However, the expressions on all of the Shamans present were grievous.

Yang Kai quickly asked, “What are the symptoms of this Green Demon Poison?”

Yue shook her head, “The information in that ancient book was incomplete, only a few words about the poison were mentioned. I only know that you will turn green and the only cure is to demonize yourself into a Demon, otherwise, you will undoubtedly die. I don’t know much more than that…”

Lu asked, “Sir, do you have any last words? We can convey them for you.”

Yang Kai burst out laughing, “I’m not dead yet.”

Lu pressed on seriously, “But if you die, you will have no chance to speak.”

Yang Kai nodded, “But I won’t die. Although I don’t know why, I actually feel fine now, so please don’t look so worried.”

Yue and Lu frowned at the same time and felt the anxiety in each other’s hearts when they looked at each other.
