After Yang Kai had broken through the raging cloud of fire, several arcs of lightning fell upon him. His body couldn’t help but shiver, while a burnt odour emanated from him.

Lightning possessed great might, and if Yang Kai didn’t have a tough body thanks to his Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art, then he would have been knocked out on the spot. But despite this, the flow of his Source Qi was obstructed and wasn’t as smooth as before.

“Spring Breeze... Rain!” The Wind-titled cultivator suddenly appeared next to Yang Kai and thrust his dagger at him. The dagger brought with it a breeze that engulfed Yang Kai, one that contained a sleep-inducing power that would make one’s will to resist fade.

As the breeze invaded Yang Kai’s body, a confused and blank look appeared in his eyes, but at the critical moment, he bit his tongue and Space Principle swirled around his body.

Yang Kai waved his hand and sent out several large Moon Blades into the surroundings.

“Dodge them!” The expression of the Wind-titled cultivator changed and he shouted in a deep voice.

It looked like the Thunder and Fire-titled cultivators also had some understanding of Yang Kai and a grave look surfaced on their faces upon seeing this Space Secret Technique. All of them swiftly used their Movement Skills to dodge it.

*Huala...*

A soft sound echoed out as a pair of wings suddenly appeared on Yang Kai’s back. These wings contained the power of wind and thunder and they increased Yang Kai’s speed greatly.

The Wind and Thunder Wings!

Yang Kai hadn’t used them for a long time. Along with the increase of his strength, and his grasp over the Space Principles, his Wind and Thunder Wings weren’t as useful to him as before.

But, at this moment, with this region being sealed by the Mountain-titled cultivator, limiting Yang Kai’s ability to teleport around, he could only summon his Wind and Thunder Wings to compensate.

The wind hovered around him, while the thunder surged about. The Wind and Thunder-titled cultivators were both surprised by the appearance of Yang Kai’s wings, neither of them having expected him to possess such a treasure on top of his mastery over the Five Elements and Space Principles.

At this moment, the members of Blood Dagger realized that the number ‘Daos’ Yang Kai had touched upon had reached an astounding number.

*Shua...*

Yang Kai managed to increase his speed further with the Wind and Thunder Wings. As his body flickered, he suddenly appeared next to the Fire-titled cultivator and his face was almost stuck to his opponent’s.

The Fire-titled cultivator was startled by this, but upon seeing the mockery and murderous intent apparent in Yang Kai’s eyes, he flew into a rage out of shame and shouted, “What are you staring at!?”

“Isn’t it obvious that I’ll start with the weakest one?” Yang Kai chuckled.

The expression of the Fire-titled cultivator changed, “Are you implying that dealing with me is the easiest?”

“Who knows!?” Yang Kai grinned.

It was a fact that he decided to assault the Fire-titled cultivator first, mainly because it was easier to deal with him as he said.

The Mountain-titled cultivator was out of the question, as it could be discerned with a glance that he had exceptional defence. If this Mountain man was assisted by his resonance with his three companions, Yang Kai believed that it wouldn’t be possible for him to break through his defence in a short time. As for the Wind and Thunder-titled cultivators, they were both endowed with high speed and could dodge easily, so dealing with the Fire-titled cultivator was indeed the easiest option.

Saying so, Yang Kai stretched his hand ahead and shouted, “Freeze!”

Manipulating the local Space Principles, even though they were affected by the Divine Ability of the Mountain-titled cultivator, Yang Kai could still lock the body of the Fire-titled cultivator in place somewhat.

When Masters exchanged moves, lives could be lost in an instant.

In this short moment, the Fire-titled cultivator felt death looming over him and his face turned deathly pale.

“Die!” Yang Kai shouted as he slashed out with his Myriads Sword.

The Fire-titled cultivator couldn’t even put a defence against this strike and the sword quickly reached him.

At this critical juncture, the eyes of the Mountain-titled cultivator snapped open.

A mountain phantom image suddenly appeared between Yang Kai and the Fire-titled cultivator and it quickly solidified. The Myriads Sword fell upon the mountain and let out a jarring metallic clank. The mountain quickly collapsed but managed to absorb all of Yang Kai’s strike.

The body of the Mountain-titled cultivator flinched slightly, but he quickly closed his eyes again as he sat cross-legged as before.

As for the Fire-titled cultivator who had just escaped death, his forehead was perspiring profusely and his body flickered, making a quick escape.

Meanwhile, the Thunder and Wind-titled cultivators had also arrived. After this short confrontation, they had both realized that Yang Kai was far from ordinary. They both exchanged a glance then started pushing their strength while weaving hand seals.

As the force of wind and thunder surged out, they both swung their daggers and formed a thunderstorm that engulfed Yang Kai.

In an instant, Yang Kai found himself in a precarious situation. His clothes had been torn by the sharp blades of wind and his sturdy muscles were revealed. As for the sizzling lightning, it was swimming across his flesh, paralyzing him. He could move only with great difficulty and couldn’t fight back, leading to a situation where he had to passively defend against this move.

The Mountain-titled cultivator in the distance suddenly waved his hand and a mountain phantom image suddenly appeared above Yang Kai, threatening to fall upon him and trap him.

As a rumbling noise echoed out, the mountain phantom image descended upon Yang Kai and pushed him down, while the ground beneath his feet cracked open, forming many spider-web like patterns.

However, Yang Kai suddenly raised his hands to hold up the mountain.

The Mountain-titled cultivator’s composed look finally had a subtle change and shock flashed past his face for a short moment.

The other three wore solemn looks as well. After this short confrontation, they all didn’t dare to close in on Yang Kai again and they only observed him from afar.

“Is this brat really... Human?” The Fire-titled cultivator had just escaped death and his heart was still beating loudly because of it. He stared ahead with wide eyes and spoke, “He could withstand the Mountain’s Mt. Xumi Technique with his fleshly body. Mt. Xumi weighs at least a hundred thousand kilograms and even ordinary Emperor Realm Masters can’t lift it. What’s more, it has the ability to seal its targets.”

“His flesh body is too strong!” The Wind-titled cultivator spoke enviously.

The Thunder-titled cultivator sighed, “I now understand why our superiors want him alive... This person is worth studying. He’s only a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, yet he’s already so strong. If we can learn his secrets, then we will gain unimaginable benefits.”

Upon hearing this, the eyes of the Wind-titled cultivator and the Fire-titled cultivator lit up, as if they had suddenly seen a bright future awaiting them.

“But, it still ends here.” The Thunder-titled cultivator snorted, “No matter how much he resists it, he’ll still be suppressed by Mountain’s Mt. Xumi.”

The Wind-titled cultivator and the Fire-titled cultivator gave him an approving nod. They were both aware of the great power of the Mountain-titled cultivator’s Mt. Xumi.

“Ha... hahaha...”

Meanwhile, Yang Kai suddenly sneered. He had been surrounded and attacked by these four cultivators for so long and he was already in a sorry state, yet he still laughed as freely as before.

The Fire-titled cultivator shouted, “Little brat, laugh while you can, I’ll make you cry soon enough!”

“If this is the limit of your powers, then it will be you who is crying shortly,” Yang Kai cast a glance at the Fire-titled cultivator and calmly spoke.

The expression of the Wind-titled cultivator changed and he shouted, “Bad! We need to act now, he still has another trump card.”

Saying so, he already charged ahead, winder swirling around his body while a certain Principle Force started pervading the surroundings.

A loud Dragon Roar reverberated at that moment, accompanied by the manifestation of a giant golden phantom behind Yang Kai. The phantom quickly took the shape of a Golden Dragon, one that floated atop Yang Kai’s head and looked down on its surroundings disdainfully with its giant Dragon Eyes.

“Dragon Transformation!” Yang Kai didn’t wait for his enemies to reach him and roared madly.

The body of the Wind-titled cultivator who had been charging toward Yang Kai suddenly came to a stop and he couldn’t help but draw a sharp, cold breath as he was forced to retreat.

“This is...” The eyes of the Thunder-titled cultivator trembled.

“Dragon Pressure!” The eyes of the Fire-titled cultivator bulged as he shouted hysterically.

The trio wore shocked looks, as if they had just sighted upon an Emperor Realm Master. They all felt dizzy and their feet started cramping up.

As for Ye Jing Han, she didn’t look any less shocked than them. Upon seeing Yang Kai being pushed down by Mt. Xumi, she planned to go forward and help him, yet the situation changed again before she could make a move. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

In an instant, Dragon Pressure filled the air and a pure Dragon Aura began pervading the surroundings. This was a lofty, noble aura that forced myriad beings to cower in fright, even evoking primordial fear in the hearts of the four from Blood Dagger.

*Kachaca...*

A cracking noise echoed out as Dragon Scales started emerging on Yang Kai’s arms, and even his exposed muscles were covered by dragon scales. As for the phantom image of the Golden Dragon, it rushed into Yang Kai’s body and disappeared. A moment later, a partially dragonized Yang Kai appeared.

Yang Kai’s aura rose markedly, touching upon that of a true Emperor Realm Master.

Yang Kai started slowly clenching one of his fists with an ice-cold look plastered on his face while he lifted Mt. Xumi with a single hand. It wasn’t a difficult feat for him like just now, seemingly as simple as lifting a brush.

Soon, he thrust his free fist and struck the bottom of Mt. Xumi.

As a rumbling noise echoed and Mt. Xumi, which weighed a hundred thousand kilograms, was sent flying into the air, flickering erratically.

The face of the Mountain-titled cultivator fell and he almost bit his tongue. He quickly weaved more hand seals, turning his Mt. Xumi into a ray of light which he quickly collected.

“You’re all going to die miserably!” Yang Kai wasn’t suppressed by Mt. Xumi any longer and he regained his freedom, not forgetting to taunt the three members of Blood Dagger with a nasty grin.

“Kill him!” The Wind-titled cultivator shouted, “Wind Dagger and Snow Sword!”

Using all of his Source Qi, he formed a large dagger and a sword, sending them after Yang Kai. The two weapons seemed to possess a might great enough to slice open the world.

Meanwhile, the Fire-titled cultivator and the Thunder-titled cultivator also used up their own trump cards to attack Yang Kai.

The Formation Technique used by the Wind, Thunder, Fire, and Mountain men resonated with each other, strengthening and supporting one another, combining to reveal an indomitable might!

They were truly able to exchange moves with an Emperor Realm Master, but on this day, they witnessed an even more shocking sight.

In the face of their three Divine Abilities, Yang Kai simply charged ahead and faced them head-on.

As a cracking noise echoed out, the three cultivators could only look on helplessly as Yang Kai shattered the Wind Dagger and Snow Sword with his fists then continued making his way through the gales and thunderstorms.

In just several breaths of time, the three cultivators’ Divine Abilities had been broken and extinguished.

As the body of the demi-dragon Yang Kai flickered, he suddenly reached the three cultivators and thrust out his Dragon Claw, which could rival the sharpest Artifacts in the world, straight towards the chest of the Wind-titled cultivator.
