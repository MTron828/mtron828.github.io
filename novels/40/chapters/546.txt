He was calling for reinforcements.

If the others didn’t immediately support them, Chen Xuan would have to order his people to retreat, if they kept fighting, the entire Fallen Leaves Hall would likely fall here.

The cultivation and methods the people in Yang Kai’s house were completely beyond his expectations.

These Immortal Ascension Boundary cultivators not only had extremely pure True Qi but each of them was equipped with high-grade artifacts.

Weren’t all of these Immortal Ascension Boundary cultivators from ordinary first-class families? Why did each of them appear to be wealthier than him? Chen Xuan couldn’t help silently complaining. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The Fallen Leaves Hall was one of the Qiu Family’s most important halls because of their strength and loyalty to the family. The number and grade of artifacts they possessed was not small and could even be said to be the best the Qiu Family had to offer, but compared to Yang Kai’s Immortal Ascension allies, they were nothing short of shabby pieces.

On top of that, the pills that these people took in battle were also quite unusual. Chen Xuan and the Fallen Leaves Hall masters were already panting for breath, their True Qi quickly depleting, but their opponents were still as mighty as dragons and fierce as tigers, unscrupulously spending their True Qi as if they were worried they couldn’t use it all.

What kind of True Qi supplementing pills had such potency?

Although it was a well-known fact that Yang Kai has two unbelievable forces supporting him, Medicine King’s Valley and Treasure Instrument Sect, Chen Xuan only now realized just how much of an impact these auxiliary supports could provide.

When she heard Chen Xuan call her name, Ye Xin Rou, who had intended to drag things out a while longer, couldn’t sit still.

The Qiu Family’s Fallen Leaves Hall had already lost a lot of people, all of which she had clearly seen, causing her to coldly snort, “A group of wastes.”

After making no attempt to hide her disdain, she wore an unwilling expression and shouted, “Let’s go.”

It was almost as if she was being forced to do something against her will.

Seeing her appearance and the current state of the Fallen Leaves Hall, Gao Rang Feng and Kang Zhan couldn’t help feeling a sense of revulsion.

The distance separating them wasn’t great so they arrived very quickly.

Ye Xin Rou’s voice spread throughout War City as she shouted, “Yang Kai, as long as you continue to associate with demons, you will sooner or later fall to the Devil’s Practices. Don’t let your pride cloud your judgement. Surrender the Evil Sect disciples you are sheltering in your house and repent for your crimes! Do so, and out of consideration for the many longs years of friendship between the Central Capital’s Eight Great Families, we will not embarrass you any further, if you insist on being stubborn and continue to resist, you will only implicate the innocent around you in your sins.”

From amidst the fierce battle, Yang Kai suddenly leapt up and hovered mid-air, fixing his gaze on the approaching group of cultivators, his expression indifferent.

With their respective Young Lords or Young Ladies at their head, groups of masters from six super-families that were in no way weaker than those from the Fallen Leaves Hall rapidly closed in.

Everyone who looked up and saw Yang Kai either wore solemn or bitter expression, except for Ye Xin Rou who had a self-satisfied look upon her face. Huo Xing Chen even quietly sneered, “Junior Sister Ye’s eloquence is quite good.”

Such an excuse, portraying Yang Kai as evil while casting their side as righteous and merciful, Huo Xing Chen felt even he wasn’t capable of spinning such a compelling narrative.

It seemed like Ye Xin Rou had carefully and painstakingly planned out how to force Yang Kai into a passive situation.

“Young Lady Ye,” After a moment of silence, Yang Kai suddenly grinned, “It has only been a few days since we last met, and I’m glad to see you in such high spirits. Where might my Second Brother be?”

Ye Xin Rou’s eyes flashed a trace of hatred. The last time they had met, she had tried to seduce Yang Kai only to be scorned as a pair of worn out shoes. Naturally, she still bore a grudge against him, but although her heart was filled with resentment, she didn’t show any trace of it on her face as she gently smiled, “Second Young Lord is currently in secluded retreat. All of his house’s matters are currently being managed by me.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly, a light smile adorning his face, “I always felt that my Second Brother wasn’t so shameless and despicable. So, it turns out that it was someone else directing this action. No wonder, no wonder.”

Ye Xin Rou’s expression dimmed slightly as she silently cursed.

However, Yang Kai just laughed before suddenly wearing a strange expression and saying in a regretful tone, “Young Lady Ye, for how I treated you a few days ago, I really must apologize. After thinking about it later, I realized I was mistaken. Since you delivered yourself to my door, I should not have refused you. Baring your beautiful and delicate body before me without hiding a single thing, I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. I don’t know what foolishness possessed me to give up such a wonderful opportunity. I sincerely regret it!” As he shouted loudly, Yang Kai slapped his thigh as if he was truly aggrieved.

Listening to his words, Kang Zhan, Gao Rang Feng, and many others all suddenly made weird faces and turned to stare at Ye Xin Rou awkwardly.

None of them knew when Ye Xin Rou attempted to seduce Yang Kai, and judging from the current situation, it seemed like she had gone with high spirits but returned disappointed...

This... was really letting a Heaven sent gift slip.

The Little Lord had such formidable will! Every man present couldn’t help admiring him a little, imagining that if Ye Xin Rou were to seduce them... they would not have been able to resist.

“I’ve reconsidered now.” Yang Kai said seriously, “Young Lady Ye, let us find a secluded place and I will do my best to meet your expectations. I am quite confident in both my skill and stamina, I guarantee you won’t be disappointed.”

Ye Xin Rou’s expression was completely sullen and the rage she felt caused her to tremble faintly. She had never expected Yang Kai to be so shameless, not hesitating to openly publicise these kinds of private matters.

Wanting to refute him directly but lacking confidence in her believability, she couldn’t help angrily retorting, “Yang Kai, don’t spout nonsense! Wanting to use such vulgar words to smear my name, how could I, Ye Xin Rou be such a woman?”

Hearing this argument, Gao Rang Feng, Kang Zhan, and everyone else awkwardly turned their heads away, their expressions still somewhat unconvinced.

Huo Xing Chen even whistled obnoxiously.

“You don’t believe me?” Ye Xin Rou glared at these people, her pretty face now a bright shade of red.

However, no one bothered responding.

“Hmph, whether you believe me or not doesn’t matter. In any case, nothing ever happened between this bastard and me.” Ye Xin Rou huffed angrily, seemingly completely annoyed.

“Obviously. Young Lord Kai just said he shut you out, how could anything have happened between you two?” Huo Xing Chen cynically muttered.

Ye Xin Rou took a deep breath and slowly exhaled, forcing down the anger in her heart before turning an ice cold stare towards Yang Kai, her mouth curving into a malicious grin as she nodded lightly, “Yang Kai, this time I’m not here to trade meaningless words with you but to bring you back to the Central Capital and force you to repent for your wicked deeds, this is also the meaning of the Eight Great Families!”

Declaring so, she pointed right at him and shouted, “Capture Yang Kai, anyone who dares to resist, kill without mercy!”

She had been thoroughly enraged by Yang Kai’s little stunt and didn’t plan on arguing with him any longer.

Immediately, the six groups of masters behind her shot forward, bringing with them a terrifying momentum.

“Since when was I defenceless?” Yang Kai roared, “Tu Feng!”

Seven figures suddenly flew out from the house, headed by Tu Feng, it was the remaining seven Blood Warriors.

Counting the previous Ying Jiu and Tang Yu Xian, the nine Blood Warriors who resided in Yang Kai’s mansion had all been deployed.

“Mad Tyrant Blood Skill!” Seven voices simultaneously boomed and a torrent of True Qi and Blood Force erupted, causing everyone’s eyes to shrink and all of War City to tremble, as if in the next moment the entire city would be crushed under the pressure.

Ye Xin Rou’s face suddenly filled with indignation as she shouted, “Yang Kai, have you forgotten? This is the Inheritance War, and the Yang Family has forbid these seven people from intervening! If you dare let them fight, you will be violating your agreement with your family!”

“This is no longer the Inheritance War,” Yang Kai sneered, “You know this better than me!”

Old Demon, who was currently fighting with the Fallen Leaves Hall masters, also let out a wicked laugh and shouted, “Since when did Little Lord care about this nonsense Inheritance War? Patriarch of the Yang Family, what crap is that? All of you slandering him so maliciously, if there weren’t things here he still worried about, he would have already left long ago!”

“What are you trying to say?” A master from the Fallen Leaves Hall, who was fighting Old Demon, saw him suddenly shout this monologue and couldn’t help asking.

Old Demon grinned maliciously towards this man and declared, “I’m saying, you’re already dead!”

(PewPewLaserGun: Hahaha, all that comes to mind is kenshiro)

These words seemed to contain a strange and profound power that caused a sense of death to infiltrate the mind of this master, the next moment, his movements stopping and his eyes glossing over, his face suddenly becoming pale as he muttered, “I... I’m dead... already dead...”

“Idiot.” Old Demon coldly snorted, rapidly thrusting his hand out and inserting it into the dazed master’s chest and pulling out his still beating heart.

Fresh blood splashed out from the new hole in the man’s chest

Old Demon’s face became more and more terrifying as he glanced around to find the most heavily populated enemy position, “Blood Sea Seals the Heavens!”

A crimson light shot out from behind him, filling the air with a gloomy aura, the ground instantly transforming into a bubbling swamp of blood that impeded the movements of all those unlucky enough to be caught in it.

Ye Xin Rou’s expression became fearful along with Gao Rang Feng, Kang Zhan, Meng Shan Yi’s, even Liu Qing Yao’s always stoic expression became incomparably grave.

Old Demon’s cruel methods were far beyond what any of them could accept. Before now, none of them had ever even heard of a man who could cultivate such evil Martial Skills and Secret Arts.

Smelling the rich, bloody aura, Ye Xin Rou couldn’t help but vomit.

Old Demon’s powerful technique had instantly pulled a dozen Immortal Ascension Boundary masters into this bloody sea and sealed them, none of them able to escape.

“How is this possible?!” After watching the battle for a while, Gao Rang Feng couldn’t help shouting.

He discovered that the seven super-family coalition force comprised of more than a hundred Immortal Ascension Boundary Sixth Stage and above masters, were actually unable to quickly defeat the cultivators from Yang Kai’s mansion.

Despite the fact that they held an absolute numerical advantage in terms of Immortal Ascension masters compared to Yang Kai, their opponent was still able to put up a strong resistance.

Observing carefully, Gao Rang Feng suddenly understood, “Yang Kai’s subordinate Blood Warriors... Since when did all of them reach the Immortal Ascension Boundary Ninth Stage?”

This sentence shook others awake as well, many of them glancing around and discovering that this was really the case.

Nine Blood Warriors, Nine Immortal Ascension Boundary Ninth Stage masters...

When Yang Kai broke through to the Immortal Ascension Boundary, four of them were only at the Immortal Ascension Boundary Eighth Stage, yet after only a dozen or so days, all of them had broken through.

An Immortal Ascension Boundary Ninth Stage Blood Warrior, after activating their Mad Tyrant Blood Skill, could exchange a few moves with an Above Immortal Ascension Boundary master. Although the masters from the seven families were also not ordinary powerhouses, how could any of them be opponents of these nine Blood Warriors in a one on one fight? Even if a number of them collaborated they wouldn’t necessarily be able to defeat their enemy.

It could be said that the biggest reason Yang Kai’s forces could last until now was solely because of these nine Blood Warriors.

“Their other Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary master hasn’t appeared yet!” Liu Qing Yao suddenly reminded, causing everyone’s heart to tighten once more.
