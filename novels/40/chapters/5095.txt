Seeing that the Warship was coming at him at full speed without showing signs of decelerating, Mei Qiong barked, “Stop!”

Yang Kai, who was standing on the deck, curved his lips into a smile. Instead of stopping, he infused even more energy into the Warship’s arrays, which caused the Warship to accelerate further.

[Something is wrong with him. He’s not a Black Ink Disciple!] An idea flashed through Mei Qiong’s mind.

If he was really a Black Ink Disciple, regardless of who his Master was, he wouldn’t dare to be impudent in front of a Territory Lord; however, instead of obeying Mei Qiong’s order, this person became even more brazen.

Mei Qiong didn’t have time to ponder on this issue though as the Warship was about to hit him. Roaring, he surged his rich Black Ink Strength, which turned into a huge Black Ink Cloud and engulfed the Warship. At the same time, he pushed out his palms.

The giant Warship hummed as every part of it creaked upon impact. Mei Qiong was forced to move backwards, but he soon stabilised himself after more than ten steps. He successfully stopped the Warship.

Given his power as a Territory Lord, such a Warship with only a single person in charge couldn’t cause any damage to him. If he wanted, he could have destroyed this Warship.

However, this was the treasure that the Royal Lord had high hopes of. They had spent countless amounts of time, resources, and manpower to build it. This ship was the key to securing the Black Ink Clan’s future. That was why he wouldn’t dare to destroy it.

Left with no other choice, he could only stop the Warship in such a way. By stopping the vessel so easily, it went to show how powerful he truly was.

Separated by only a light barrier, Yang Kai and Mei Qiong stared at one another. One of them was unfazed while the other was infuriated.

Mei Qiong said through clenched teeth, “Bastard, you’re dead!”

Yang Kai grinned at him as he madly channelled his power into the Warship like a torrent.

The next instant, a dangerous aura could be felt coming from every part of the Warship.

With widened eyes, Mei Qiong roared, “You dare?!”

As he spoke, he extended his hand towards Yang Kai. The thin light barrier around the Warship couldn’t possibly fend off the powerful attack from a Territory Lord and lasted for only one breath before it shattered.

As he was about to capture Yang Kai though, a dazzling light suddenly exploded from the Warship. A horrifying force spread out as the entire Warship was engulfed in a ball of raging flames.

Mei Qiong missed his target and failed in his attempt to capture the insolent Human. At the most critical moment, the Human seemed to have vanished into thin air.

On the other hand, the Warship’s explosion caused his arm to be injured and he was also forced to move backwards upon impact.

The Warship was destroyed!

Mei Qiong stared at the burning Warship. Despite the heat, he felt as though a basin of cold water had been poured onto his heart.

He could almost envision how infuriated the Royal Lord would be upon learning what had happened. He probably would have to bear all the responsibility. Despite being a Territory Lord, he wouldn’t be able to bear what was to come.

Up until this moment, he still had no idea what was going on. How did things go so wrong all of a sudden? After all, not long ago, Qing Lei told him that the Warship was almost completed, so he had to head to the Royal City and inform the Royal Lord about it.

Mei Qiong thought that he would not have to stay here much longer. In the future, he could stand on a Warship and look down condescendingly at his enemies on the battlefield.

Barely two hours later, his dream burst like a bubble. It was expected that he was enraged.

[That Human!]

As long as he could capture that Human, he would find out the truth.

He suddenly turned his head and gazed at the portal before yelling, “Cordon off the portal! Make sure no one can leave this place!”

Although the Human disappeared as the Warship exploded, Mei Qiong didn’t think he was dead. The Human must have pulled a trick and avoided his detection by using the explosion to cover his tracks.

In that case, the Human’s target would undoubtedly be the portal, for he had to leave this Sealed World as quickly as possible.

Upon giving the order, Mei Qiong turned around to return to the portal.

As soon as he started moving though, he heard the sound of battle coming from the portal. Following that, the portal in mid-air opened rapidly.

The Human that had escaped from Mei Qiong had really headed to the portal. The instant the portal was opened, he dashed past it and disappeared.

After that, the portal closed abruptly and vanished.

A furious Mei Qiong turned into a dark streak of light and reached the portal in just a few breaths’ time. Lifting his gaze, he realised that seven or eight Feudal Lords had collapsed, all badly injured. The most severely wounded one had a large hole in his figure as his body was penetrated by some kind of weapon earlier. Black blood was splattered all over the place.

[That Human is so strong!] Mei Qiong was startled.

As far as he knew, the Black Ink Disciple sent to this place by Hei Yuan was just a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Usually, a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was more powerful than a Feudal Lord, but even if one Feudal Lord was no match for him, how was it possible that so many Feudal Lords were defeated at the same time? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, only a few breaths of time had passed since the Human escaped from Mei Qiong. How did he disable seven or eight Feudal Lords in such a short time?

Mei Qiong didn’t have time to ponder on this issue. While gritting his teeth, he ordered, “Open the portal!”

Since the Human had fled, he naturally had to chase after him. Only by capturing the Human could he make up for his mistake and find out what had happened.

It wasn’t necessary for Mei Qiong to give the order. In fact, after Yang Kai fled, a Feudal Lord, who was usually responsible for opening the portal, had been trying his best to do just that; however, the portal that could be opened with ease normally showed no reaction on this day.

After several attempts, he still got the same outcome.

The Feudal Lord’s forehead was covered with sweat, possibly because of pain, anxiety, or both. Still, he turned to look at Mei Qiong and reported, “Sir, I can’t open it!”

“Waste!” Mei Qiong directly kicked the Feudal Lord away and snatched the token. He then infused his power into the token and waved it at the portal.

As usual, a dark light shot into the Void, but no reaction was seen. The portal, which should’ve been opened by now, was nowhere in sight.

Mei Qiong widened his eyes and made one more attempt, but the outcome was the same.

A Feudal Lord came over and said in a hushed voice, “Sir, the portal’s restriction was set up by the Black Ink Disciples. They must have tampered with it somehow.”

Certainly, Mei Qiong realised this as well; otherwise, he couldn’t explain what was going on. He directly exerted more force with his hand and turned the token into dust before demanding, “Break it open!”

As he spoke, he made a move first by launching an attack on the portal. Seeing that, the Feudal Lords followed suit.

In the void, Yang Kai manipulated Space Principles and repeatedly used Instantaneous Movement. He was trying to get as far away from the Royal City as possible.

Previously, when he was led to the Royal City to purchase materials, he left behind a trick in the Sealed World’s portal. Given his mastery in the Dao of Space, no one else could possibly notice it. Now that he had to flee from this Sealed World, he activated the trick.

However, he knew that this little measure couldn’t hold Mei Qiong up for long. Mei Qiong just had to forcefully break through the portal, which would take no more than a cup of tea’s time. After that, a large number of Black Ink Clansmen would relentlessly pursue him.

Therefore, he only had a cup of tea’s time to flee. Given such a short time, regardless of how proficient he was at the Dao of Space, Yang Kai couldn’t possibly escape from the Black Ink Clan; therefore, he could only get as far away from the Royal City as possible.

Given his strength, he might be able to escape from a Territory Lord; however, if the Royal Lord made a move, there was nothing else he could do but to wait for death.

Nie An was dead, and the only completed Warship was destroyed. It could be said that the Black Ink Clan’s plan was as good as dead.

Everything would be perfect if Yang Kai could bring the remaining 300 Artifact Refiners in his Small Universe back to the Humans’ side.

Nevertheless, the road ahead of him was paved with danger. He wasn’t certain if he could get away. Presently, he could only do his best to run for his life. If he succeeded, everything would be fine. If he failed, he had more than 300 friends to accompany him on the road to the Yellow Springs, so he wouldn’t feel lonely.

As he fully activated Space Principles, his figure flickered like a phantom.

Fortunately, Yang Kai didn’t run into any real danger while navigating through the void.

Even though he would sometimes come across some Black Ink Clansmen who were heading to the Royal City, he would disappear from their sight the next instant. Many of the Black Ink Clansmen even thought that they saw an illusion.

Suddenly, there came a moment when Yang Kai felt all his hair standing on end. There seemed to be a pair of eyes that were opening and staring at him from a faraway place behind him.

Mu Guang Royal Lord!

After making some calculations, Yang Kai realised that Mei Qiong should have broken through the portal and informed the Royal Lord about what had happened in the Sealed World by now.

Even from such a great distance, the Royal Lord could still accurately locate him, astonishing Yang Kai.

One had to know that he had never stopped using Instantaneous Movement since he left the Sealed World and presently, he was very far away from the Royal City.

The Royal Lords were really astounding, and their powers were beyond Yang Kai’s imagination.

He wasn’t certain whether Mu Guang could really find his exact whereabouts, but he wouldn’t dare to stop fleeing. However, after he was targeted by that gaze, he felt that something had been wrapped around his figure, which made him feel a constant sense of discomfort and left him slightly muddle-headed.

It was obviously because of the Royal Lord’s aura that had locked onto him.

With a solemn expression, Yang Kai continued charging forward without worrying about his consumption of energy. Regardless of whether Mu Guang had really discovered his whereabouts, he still had a chance to flee; after all, Mu Guang was still far away from him, so it wouldn’t be easy for the Royal Lord to catch up.

Half a day after Yang Kai escaped from the Sealed World, he finally came across a Black Ink Clan army that was there to stop him.

It wasn’t appropriate to call them an army really, as their scale suggested that they were just a Feudal Lord’s private force. There were only a small number of Feudal Lords, and the rest were High-Rank and Low-Rank Black Ink Clansmen, numbering about 300 people.

This private force was right in front of Yang Kai, as though they had been waiting for him for a long time. The moment Yang Kai’s figure appeared, the Feudal Lord at the front shouted, “He’s that Human! Capture him and the Royal Lord will reward you handsomely!”
