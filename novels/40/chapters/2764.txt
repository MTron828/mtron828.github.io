Being a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, Xiao Yu Yang’s vision was far higher than a greenhouse flower like Xiao Chen’s, so with a single look, he was able to tell that Xiao Chen was completely outmatched by Yang Kai.

Shock filled his heart as he knew that their respective breakthroughs to the Emperor Realm after their trip to the Shattered Sea had occurred within a short period from the other. Yet, the gulf between their strength was akin to night and day.

“Retreat, Chen’er!” Xiao Yu Yang roared out. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Nevertheless, it was a pity that he had spoken too late. A palm came extending through the flurry of sword lights, smashing through them as if they were rotten twigs. The screen of swords instantly withered, turning Xiao Chen’s Sword Intent uncontrollably chaotic in the process.

Shock bloomed across Xiao Chen’s face as he hastily pulled back in retreat. Nevertheless, like a shadow, the incoming palm travelled along his path of retreat, moving threateningly close to his body.

Right at that instant, a gale came whipping from the side as Xiao Yu Yang was forced to take action to save his son.

With a tap of his foot, Yang Kai’s body came to an instant stop, right as a gale whipped past his fingertip.

Moving swiftly, Xiao Yu Yang had a solemn look on his face as he stood between Yang Kai and Xiao Chen, “Yang Kai, this King doesn’t want to be oppressive to the young, and doesn’t wish to take action against you. Would it be possible for you to cooperate?”

Yang Kai smirked, “That’s not possible!”

Xiao Yu Yang gave a soft sigh, “Since that is the case, pardon my offence.”

As his voice rang out, he extended his hand and made a grasping motion towards Yang Kai. Immediately, it appeared as though the entire surrounding space had been locked, as a buzzing sound started to ring out from the void.

Nevertheless, Yang Kai did not evade or dodge Xiao Yu Yang’s grab; instead, he replied indifferently, “Senior Xiao, it isn’t because this Junior looks down on you, but I’m afraid that you’re unable to keep this Junior here. The mountains and rivers always come together in the end, so let’s meet in the future.”

Space Principles started to ripple out, before Yang Kai’s body suddenly flickered, leaving behind only an afterimage in its place.

Upon grasping through the afterimage, Xiao Yu Yang’s face changed slightly as he growled, “A Spatial Ability!”

He turned and looked around; however, Yang Kai’s presence had totally disappeared, and no one could tell where he had run off to. Despite releasing his powerful Divine Sense, Xiao Yu Yang was unexpectedly unable to grasp Yang Kai’s aura, causing his expression to sink.

Originally, he believed that Tan Jun Hao and Wu Ming’s deaths were due to the Monster King taking action; however, with what had just happened, the possibility of Yang Kai being the culprit had just become slightly higher. Being able to freely teleport was by itself an extraordinary skill that could overturn the most dangerous of situations, and it was also mentioned in the reports that this boy was in possession of the Yuan Ding Great Emperor’s Mountains and Rivers Bell.

That was an Ancient Exotic Artifact! No one knew exactly how powerful that Mountains and Rivers Bell was, but it was not to be underestimated.

Turning around, he noticed Xiao Chen standing slumped over there. The hand that held the sword was trembling incessantly, while an ashen and ugly expression was present on his face.

Losing to Yang Kai’s move was a huge blow for Xiao Chen. Earlier, despite having just broken through to the Emperor Realm, he had always assumed that no one could rival him in this realm. He was a Core Disciple of Star Soul Palace, and moreover, he was Xiao Yu Yang’s son! Having been nurtured since young, he was the best of the best within Star Soul Palace. In fact, he was well known to be an invincible existence among cultivators in the same realm.

However, at this moment, this sense of superiority that had accompanied him since young had been shattered apart by Yang Kai’s palm, something that was impossible for him to endure.

“Victory and defeat are commonplace in battle. Rather than dwelling in this moment of defeat, why not think of how to increase your strength.” Xiao Yu Yang said in an indifferent tone.

A tremor shook through Xiao Chen’s body. Finally coming back to his senses, he quickly replied, “Many thanks for your guidance, Father.”

“Let’s go.” Xiao Yu Yang waved his hand.

“Where to?” Xiao Chen asked.

“Azure Sun Temple,” Xiao Yu Yang replied, before taking the lead and flying off.

Having laid an ambush here, they had managed to run into Yang Kai. This was a clear indication of Yang Kai’s motives; he was headed to Azure Sun Temple. Since they weren’t able to hold him here, they would have to head to Azure Sun Temple to find him.

Regardless of the circumstances, they still needed to settle this matter.

…

“Halt!”

Not long after escaping, Yang Kai came face-to-face with two new figures. The lead figure shouted out loudly as he obstructed Yang Kai’s path of travel.

Having entered Azure Sun Temple many times before, Yang Kai naturally knew its rules. Immediately, he retrieved his Azure Sun Golden Token and tossed it to the two disciples on guard.

Catching the token, the lead figure’s face changed, “Azure Sun Golden Token?”

Only the few Core Disciples of Azure Sun Temple had the qualifications to hold this golden token. Although they were all disciples of Azure Sun Temple, there was a great disparity in their status compared to those Core Disciples.

They took another look at Yang Kai, whose face was extremely foreign to them, and did not recognise him as his profile looked nothing like one of the few Core Disciples they had seen among the Sect.

The lead disciple proceeded to shout out in anger, “How deceitful of you, daring to pose as a disciple of our temple! Where did you get this golden token from!?”

After those words rang out, the two disciples immediately summoned their artifacts and locked their auras onto Yang Kai, appearing to be ready to take action at any moment. Yang Kai was an in-name disciple of Azure Sun Temple, while this golden token was given to him by Gao Xue Ting back in Maplewood City many years ago, so it was not a widely known fact among the temple. Therefore, many disciples didn’t know about Yang Kai at all. At this moment, after seeing a foreign person holding a Core Disciple token in his hand, it was natural for them to raise their guard.

Yang Kai replied, “Elder Gao gave me this token. You two can ask Elder Gao or the other Elders about this. Just tell them that Yang Kai has arrived, and they will naturally give you an explanation.”

“Yang Kai!” The lead disciple frowned, shooting a look to his Junior Brother by his side before nodding his head and replying, “Wait a moment.”

He proceeded to retrieve a communication artifact, and from the looks of it, was contacting his higher-ups to report this matter.

A moment later, the communication artifact shook, and sending his Divine Sense into it, a strange look immediately appeared on the face of the lead disciple.

The Elders had replied that the token was genuine, and the person by the name of Yang Kai was an actual disciple of their temple.

“I apologize for the earlier offence. Please, Senior Brother!” Receiving the Elder’s command, the disciple on guard duty naturally didn’t dare to obstruct Yang Kai anymore. Moving his body to the side, he said, “Elder Gao said to find her on Myriad Saints Peak.”

Yang Kai nodded his head and retrieved his golden token. As he moved past the two disciples on guard duty, he suddenly thought of something and said, “That’s right. There will be two fellows coming here later. Think of a way to obstruct them for a while.”

“Yes!” Despite not knowing any details, the two disciples immediately acknowledged his command.

Myriad Saints Peak was the main peak within Azure Sun Temple. With routine ease, Yang Kai travelled towards it, and as he did so, he noticed a white figure standing in front of a distant palace, looking right in his direction.

The figure appeared just like a white lotus, pure and unstained. Her accompanying dress accentuated her elegant figure. Furthermore, there was another small and unassuming figure standing by her side.

From a distance away, Yang Kai revealed a faint smile and shot over.

As he approached, the pure white figure suddenly raised her hand, before a circular mirror with a sun-like appearance rose from behind her head. Just like a rising radiant sun, the temperature of the surrounding air proceeded to shoot up.

Emperor Artifact, Radiant Sun Mirror!

Incomparably hot beams of light shot out from the mirror, drawing beautiful arcs in the air before appearing right before Yang Kai in the blink of an eye.

Yang Kai gasped in shock before summoning his Myriads Sword. Unleashing a defensive move, a protective sword barrier appeared before him.

*Chi chi chi chi…*

The scorching rays of light were blocked by the sword barrier, unable to hit their mark, though Yang Kai was forced to retreat as a result.

After dispelling those rays of light, the figures before him flickered, before Gao Xue Ting suddenly appeared right before him. Extending a slender, jade white hand, she formed a fist, exposing her middle finger slightly, before giving a knock towards Yang Kai’s head.

Not daring to evade, Yang Kai had no choice but to take the hit. With a dull thud ringing from his head, he felt as though his entire being had grown shorter by a head.

“Elder Gao…” Yang Kai revealed a look of injustice as he rubbed the place where he had been struck.

Gao Xue Ting gave a cold snort, before casting a sidelong gaze at him, “So, now your wings have grown hard, you dare take action against me?”

“When did that happen?” Yang Kai gave a wronged look, “Just now it was an instinctual reaction…”

“Do you know why I hit you?” Questioned Gao Xue Ting.

Yang Kai grinned, “Because I’ve not come back for quite some time, causing you to miss me.”

Gao Xue Ting snorted, “I don’t care whether you’ve come back or not. However, after causing such a big ruckus and encountering such great danger, why did you not seek help from the temple? Do you feel no sense of belonging with the temple, or do you see yourself as an outsider?”

Yang Kai immediately knew she was referring to the matter with Star Soul Palace, causing a burst of warmth to fill his heart and a smile to form on his lips.

“Stop grinning and get down for me!” Gao Xue Ting extended her hand, grabbed onto Yang Kai’s ear, and pulled him down towards Myriad Saint Peak.

“Pain, pain, pain, pain…” With his head twisted while still holding on to the Myriads Sword in his hand, Yang Kai was led about by Gao Xue Ting. Even though he was able to stand up against Great Emperors and Divine Spirits, he didn’t dare to muster any resistance at all. Nevertheless, he felt as though his ear was about to detach from his head, causing him to scream and plead, although his protests fell on deaf ears.

Only after arriving at Myriad Saints Peak did Gao Xue Ting release her grip, though she followed up with a slap towards the back of Yang Kai’s head.

Yang Kai staggered forward, though he did not dare to utter any complaints.

Raising his head, he spotted Wen Zi Shen, leading him to hastily move forward, “You’re looking well, Temple Master Wen!”

The corners of Wen Zi Shan’s mouth twitched as he looked towards the Heavens, appearing as though he did not hear anything at all. Nevertheless, he proceeded to send a Divine Sense transmission towards Yang Kai stealthily, “Little Xue Ting is very angry. You better quell her anger before talking. If not, this Temple Master doesn’t dare to talk to you.”

Yang Kai’s face turned black while a look of contempt flashed across his eyes.

Turning his head around, he looked towards the few people standing to the side. Vice Temple Master Qiu Ran, Elders Chen Qian, Di Rong, and You Kun; all of them evaded his gaze, as though they had not seen him looking over at all.

Gao Xue Ting was the only exception as she continued to stare coldly at him. Her gaze was sharp and penetrating as a sword, seemingly wanting to turn him into a pincushion.

Yang Kai obediently walked towards Gao Xue Ting and lowered his head, “Elder Gao, this disciple has made a mistake. Please mete out your punishment, Elder Gao.”

Gao Xue Ting replied in an indifferent tone, “You made no mistake, so why does this Elder have to punish you? That’s right, I still have to thank you. If not for you saving me that time, this Elder might not have been able to extricate herself from that situation.”

After saying that, she proceeded to bow towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was scared stiff by her actions, leading him to leap aside.

Turning towards his direction, Gao Xue Ting gave another bow.

A crying expression appeared on Yang Kai’s face as he said, “What do you want, Elder Gao? Whatever it is, I’ll accept it, okay!”

Gao Xue Ting immediately raised her head and shot a scorching gaze at Yang Kai, “You better keep to your word! En, this Elder will not put you in a difficult spot. As long as you agree to this matter, this Elder will forgive you this time.”

“Please speak.” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up.

“Become an Elder of the temple.”

Yang Kai’s face immediately turned serious as he spoke out in a solemn tone, “Elder Gao, this…”

“You dare refuse?” With a flick of her hand, Gao Xue Ting aimed her sword towards Yang Kai’s throat and growled, “Let this Elder see if you dare to reject this Elder’s personal request!”
