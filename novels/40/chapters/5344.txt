The Feudal Lord was overjoyed after hearing Yang Kai say that the Territory Lords had found the how of the Old Ancestor mysteriously appeared and disappeared.

Yang Kai solemnly nodded, “This matter is confidential, so before leaving, Sir Che Kong ordered the outer ring Feudal Lords to use the Black Ink Nest to perform a thorough search.”

“Search for what?” The Feudal Lord asked in a low voice.

“For a certain thing.” While speaking, Yang Kai took out a Space Beacon and handed it to the Feudal Lord, “This.”

“What is this?” The Feudal Lord took it and carefully examined it, but did not find anything special about it.

Yang Kai kindly explained, “I have no idea what this is either, but the Territory Lords should know. What I can confirm is that the Old Ancestor somehow uses this thing to travel to the vicinity of the Royal City.”

“There’s a strange energy lingering around it…” The Feudal Lord muttered.

Yang Kai patiently added, “It should be the energy of Space Principles.”

“Space Principles…” Realization immediately dawned upon the Feudal Lord, “No wonder.”

Obviously, he was not unfamiliar with Space Principles.

“There should be quite a number of these things in the vicinity of the Royal City, so we must carefully search for them. In addition, I would like to ask Sir Mao Bo to step out of the Black Ink Nest so that he can memorize its aura, as Sir Mao Bo is in charge of the Black Ink Nest. It will be easier to investigate with the power of the Black Ink Nest.”

“En,” the Feudal Lord nodded and handed the Space Beacon back to Yang Kai, “Wait a moment, I’ll go and bring Brother Mao Bo.”

“Many thanks!” Yang Kai cupped his fist.

The Feudal Lord entered the Black Ink Nest once more and returned with another Feudal Lord a moment later, who stretched his hand towards Yang Kai after seeing him, “Show me.”

Yang Kai casually tossed as he stated, grinning, “Sir, please look carefully.”

The next moment, 10 Space Beacons flew towards the two Feudal Lords.

The two Black Ink Clan Feudal Lords were taken aback, [So many?]

This was especially true for the Feudal Lord who had communicated with Yang Kai earlier. He had thought that since the Old Ancestor used it to travel, it must be extremely valuable and rare.

But much to their surprise, Yang Kai suddenly threw over 10 of them.

Before they could figure anything out, the Space Beacons suddenly started radiating strange energy fluctuation, and immediately after, figures appeared out of thin air one after another.

Each Space Beacon corresponded to a figure. 10 Space Beacons were equal to 10 people!

Also, the surrounding space instantly solidified, giving the Black Ink Clansmen the feeling of falling into a quagmire.

[What’s going on?] The two Feudal Lords were utterly confused, and so were the High-Rank and Low-Rank Black Ink Clansmen.

“Kill!” Yang Kai shouted as he thrust his spear towards Mao Bo.

He was the Master of the Black Ink Nest, so as long as he was taken down, there was nothing to fear.

The moment Chai Fang and the others appeared, they dispersed in all directions. Chai Fang and two other Seventh-Order Masters charged straight at the other Feudal Lord, casting various restrictive methods.

The other seven Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were like wolves in a flock of sheep, ruthlessly slaughtering the High-Rank and Low-Rank Black Ink Clansmen.

“You… Humans!” Mao Bo shouted in horror. If he still didn’t know he had fallen into the Human’s trap at this point, he would have lived all his life in vain.

What he couldn’t fathom was how someone, who looked so much like a Black Ink Disciple, could be a normal Human. Be that as it may, his movements weren’t slow at all. Instantly, his consciousness communicated with the Black Ink Nest and the next moment, the giant flower bud shaped nest started trembling slightly as a tremendous amount of Black Ink Strength surged towards him.

Just like the Royal Lord could use the power of his Black Ink Nest at the Royal City to increase his strength, the Feudal Lords could also do the same. Of course, the boost in strength they received was not nearly as significant as the Royal Lord’s.

At the critical moment of life and death, Feudal Lord Mao Bo had to go all out.

Unfortunately for him, Yang Kai’s spear was faster. It easily destroyed Mao Bo’s hastily condensed defensive barrier and pierced straight through his forehead.

Mao Bo’s eyes cracked wide in disbelief.

He could not be considered as weak among the Feudal Lords, and had even personally killed a Seventh-Order Human in one-on-one combat in the past. Today though, his opponent was only a Seventh-Order Human, but he was simply unable to block that spear thrust.

A powerful shockwave swept outward as Mao Bo’s head exploded, leaving a headless corpse floating lifelessly in the void.

The vibrating Black Ink Nest instantly calmed down after having lost his control.

Yang Kai short forward, smashing Mao Bo’s headless corpse to pieces before rushing into the Black Ink Nest.

There might be other Black Ink Clansmen inside the Black Ink Nest, so he quickly went inside to take total control of it. He did not need to manage the battle outside.

Chai Fang and the others had the absolute advantage and would take care of it properly.

There were indeed a few High-Rank Black Ink Clansmen inside the Black Ink Nest, but none of them was at the core area.

Mao Bo had been staying inside the Black Ink Nest all the while; as such, the High-Rank Black Ink Clansmen didn’t dare to do anything outside their jurisdiction.

Yang Kai went on a killing spree with his spear. After he had confirmed that all the Black Ink Clansmen in the Black Ink Nest had been annihilated, he exited casually.

The battle outside was over by the time he arrived.

The 10 High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters of the Old Turtle Squad were more than enough to deal with a single Feudal Lord and a group of less than 50 weaker Black Ink Clansmen.

The Feudal Lord who had led Yang Kai here fell at the hands of Chai Fang and the other two Seventh-Order Masters in less than five breaths while the remaining small fry were unable to cause any trouble.

By the time Yang Kai emerged from the Black Ink Nest, not only had all the Black Ink Clansmen been taken out, even the battlefield had been cleaned up by Chai Fang and the others.

“Come inside,” Yang Kai beckoned everyone.

Chai Fang and the others entered the Black Ink Nest in single file.

After entering the Black Ink Nest, Chai Fang released the Old Turtle Squad’s Warship as everyone landed on the deck, looking at each other, grinning.

“Is there any problem?” Chai Fang asked in a low voice.

Yang Kai shook his head, “It should be fine.”

The battle was finished very quickly. In addition, there was quite a bit of distance between them and the other Black Ink Nest, so the fallout of their battle wouldn’t reach them.

“I’ll go bring the others,” Yang Kai stated before activating Space Principles and disappearing into thin air, leaving behind only a Space Beacon.

Yang Kai returned a short while after. He then opened a portal to his Small Universe as 40 people walked out one after another.

They were the members of the Old Turtle Squad.

Previously, all the Old Turtle Squad members below the Seventh Order had been left with Dawn to facilitate a rapid deployment. Now that they had taken over this Black Ink Nest, they needed the full Old Turtle Squad to guard it, which was why the remaining members were brought over.

The Black Ink Strength inside the Black Ink Nest was quite dense and strong, so even a Seventh-Order Master would find it hard to bear for a long time. The Purifying Black Ink Pill might provide some help, but it was not suitable for an extended stay in an area filled with Black Ink Strength.

A Warship, on the other hand, could provide firm protection. As long as the Warship’s Defensive Arrays remained intact and active, there was no risk of being corrupted by Black Ink Strength.

Yang Kai didn’t stop to rest after helping the Old Turtle Squad settle down at the Black Ink Nest and immediately headed towards the third target.

This trip was even easier than the last, thanks to his prior experience.

When he met with the Black Ink Clan team, who had come to investigate the situation, Yang Kai didn’t say he was here to collect supplies; after all, such an excuse was a little risky.

If the Feudal Lord he had killed first had already collected the resources from here, he would have to come up with a new story to slip his way out of it.

Saying that the Royal City had discovered how the Old Ancestor mysteriously appeared and disappeared, and wanted all of the Feudal Lords in charge of the Black Ink Nests in the outer ring to carry out a joint search was a much better excuse.

As expected, the Black Ink Clan did not find it suspicious. Not only did they not become suspicious, they even became quite excited.

To them, if they could unravel the mysteries of how the Old Ancestor was randomly showing up out of thin air, they would have a safer future.

After arriving in front of the third Black Ink Nest, Yang Kai used news of the Space Beacons to easily lure out the Master of the Black Ink Nest, and using the same trick, Yang Kai tossed out a handful of Space Beacons and attacked.

But he was cooperating with Ma Gao’s Squad this time.

All the Special Operations Squads were almost equally strong, except Yang Kai’s Dawn Squad, which was much stronger thanks to the latter.

Under the cooperation of 10 Seventh-Order Masters, the Black Ink Clansmen guarding this Black Ink Nest were swiftly wiped out.

As such, the third Black Ink Nest was successfully occupied.

The three adjacent Black Ink Nests covered quite a wide area of the Black Ink Clan’s defence line. Now that they had been captured, a hole had appeared in the detection net. So long as Great Evolution Pass disguised itself slightly, it would be able to pass through this hole and rush to the rear of the Black Ink Clan’s defence line undetected.

Obviously, Great Evolution Pass must have some kind of Illusion Array installed on it, so disguising itself would be a piece of cake.

They had now occupied three Black Ink Nests. Dawn was stationed at one, the Old Turtles at another, and the Profound Wind Squad at the last one.

Things settled down from the moment, but it would be hard to say after some time had passed. The Black Ink Clan would definitely grow suspicious if three Black Ink Nests fell silent for too long, but delaying things for 10 days or half a month shouldn’t be a problem.

Great Evolution Pass would have arrived in half a month at most.

So long as Great Evolution Pass could pass through the defence line, Dawn and the other Squads would only have to keep up this act for a few more days. Even if the Black Ink Clan noticed after that, it would be too late. It would be difficult for them to respond in time. At the very least, it would be difficult for the Black Ink Clan forces stationed at the perimeter to rush back to help defend the Royal City. As such, the forces of the Royal City would be weakened.

Originally, Yang Kai thought that taking down the three adjacent Black Ink Nest was enough, as this was also the minimum requirement for Great Evolution Pass to quietly sneak through the enemy defence line.

But now that he had such a good strategy, Yang Kai felt like he could take over an additional Black Ink Nest.

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to take down even more after that, it was just that he was lacking in manpower. Right now, each of the three Squads was guarding a Black Ink Nest, while he alone could guard the fourth. If he took a fifth, there would be no one left to guard it.

After all, it would be difficult for the others to last long in the Black Ink Nest without the protection of a Warship.

Three Black Ink Nests were the lowest requirement. If there were four, it would naturally be better, as the margin for error would be bigger.

Having made up his mind, Yang Kai gave a word of advice to Dawn before continuing on his way without a moment of delay. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The fourth Black Ink Nest was taken down quite easily, just like the previous two. All Yang Kai had to do was use the Space Beacon as an example. The Black Ink Clansmen out in the defence line were extremely concerned about the Old Ancestor, so when they heard that the Territory Lords had solved the mystery of the Old Ancestor’s mysterious appearance and disappearance, they were overjoyed, which easily lured out the Feudal Lord guarding the Black Ink Nest.

But he didn’t expect to be greeted with Yang Kai’s spear.

This time, Dawn’s Shen Ao and the others worked together with him. After taking down the Black Ink Nest, Dawn’s members didn’t stay and instead used their Universe Transference Law to return to Dawning Light.

Yang Kai remained alone at the Black Ink Nest, monitoring the situation in the outer ring.

Everything remained calm and peaceful for the next few days.

He occasionally contacted the three Squads, but nothing unusual happened in their respective areas.
