At the head of this group was an old man with snow-white hair. Behind this old man stood several men and women of varying cultivations, some Origin Kings, some Dao Source Realms. At this moment, however, all of them wore astonished looks as they stared at the strange scene below.

After seeing this old man, Zhou Yi was overjoyed and hurriedly shouted, “Protector Miao, save me!”

[Protector Miao?] Yang Kai’s brow rose when he learned the identity of this newcomer.

Miao Qi was also one of Blue Feather Sect’s Protectors and had a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation, the same as Bian Yu, Qing Zhu and Jun Shan.

If a master at this level wanted to take Yang Kai’s life, he would likely not be able to put up any resistance.

Yang Kai did not know exactly what kind of attitude this Miao Qi would take to deal with today’s affairs and secretly made up his mind that if this old man wanted to favour Zhou Yi and suppress him, he would directly release his new Monster Insect Queen and raise as much chaos as possible.

Although the Monster Insect Queen could only exert the strength of a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator; with its solid foundation if it went all out it could at least delay Miao Qi for a while.

Yang Kai would take that opportunity to flee with Liu Xian Yun.

As for whether he could escape at that time, it would depend on his own means.

Considering all this, Yang Kai adjusted his mood and turned his eyes fearlessly towards Miao Qi.

Miao Qi seemed to be looking at Yang Kai too, and seeing the strange scene in front of him, he could not completely hide his surprise. With the difference in strength between Yang Kai and Zhou Yi, logically speaking, Yang Kai should have been subdued with ease, but it was obvious that at this moment, Zhou Yi was the one who was restrained and had lost his right to decide if he lived or died. Miao Qi could not figure out what had happened.

As for Chu Fei and his minions... they were so miserable and unsightly that Miao Qi didn’t want to spare them a second glance.

“Protector Miao, help!” Chu Fei and the others also yelled one after another. The appearance of Miao Qi gave them hope so regardless of Yang Kai’s previous threats, they hurriedly stood up from the ground with their swollen faces and begged for salvation. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Miao Qi remained indifferent, however, as he used his Divine Sense to repeatedly scan Yang Kai, seemingly trying to understand what mysteries he was hiding.

Behind him, a middle-aged man stepped forward and looking down below condescendingly, he asked coldly, “What happened here?”

Chu Fei and the others clearly recognized this man and hearing this, they quickly cupped their fists and said, “Reporting to Senior Brother Pang, I had some grievances with this Junior Brother Yang before, but today, I heard he had returned from the Ice Cliff and came here to apologize. I don’t know what kind of insanity possessed Junior Brother Yang as he suddenly struck out without warning or explanation. Before we could resist, we were made into this miserable state! Senior Brother Pang and Protector Miao must uphold justice for us.”

Chu Fei was articulate and quickly made up an excuse on the spot, pushing all the blame and fault onto Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was a bit stunned when he heard these words and could not help admiring Chu Fei’s ability to twist the truth.

Senior Brother Pang was noncommittal and with a frown asked, “Then what happened to Junior Brother Zhou?”

Chu Fei was immediately filled with righteous indignation as he pointed at Yang Kai and shouted, “Senior Brother Pang, please understand. Senior Brother Zhou was just passing by here, saw us being humiliated, and out of righteousness and compassion stepped forward to intercede, but Junior Brother Yang was treacherous and under the guise of apologizing suddenly attacked Senior Brother Zhou. Senior Brother Zhou has a kind heart and did not expect to suddenly be attacked and was caught off guard... it is all our fault; we are the ones who caused Senior Brother Zhou to fall into such a state!”

Chu Fei sobbed bitterly while he spoke, and while Zhou Yi did not say a word during the whole process, he also made an aggrieved face and cooperated with him in this face.

“Bullshit!” Liu Xian Yun could not listen to this anymore and her pretty face flushed red as she shouted, “Clearly it was you holding a grudge and coming to look for trouble with Yang Kai by taking advantage of Senior Brother Zhou Yi, but when things turned against...”

“Xian Yun, you don’t need to explain,” Yang Kai interrupted her as he turned to look at Chu Fei with a sneer before saying lightly, “Right or wrong, Protector Miao will make his own judgment.”

“But...” Liu Xian Yun wanted to say more, but seeing the firm look in Yang Kai’s eyes, she simply sighed and stood down.

She and Yang Kai both knew that if this Protector Miao favoured Chu Fei and Zhou Yi, even if Chu Fei’s lies were exposed, Protector Miao would not care. If on the other hand Protector Miao was a fair and just man, there was no need to explain anything.

Everything would depend on Miao Qi’s attitude!

“No need to explain? That must mean you have a guilty conscience! Senior Brother Zhou’s life is being held in your vicious hands, what is there not to explain?” Chu Fei changed his previous cowardly appearance and became impassioned as if the Heavens themselves had wronged him.

Yang Kai just sneered.

The Senior Brother Pang up in the sky frowned and said with disgust, “Shut up!”

Chu Fei hurriedly shut his mouth.

Senior Brother Pang looked at Yang Kai and said lightly, “Are you the disciple who has just joined the Sect?”

“Yes, Yang Kai greets Senior Brothers and Protector Miao. Please forgive this disciple for not giving a proper salute as his hands are currently a bit preoccupied,” Yang Kai replied in a neither humble nor arrogant demeanour while maintaining his previous posture.

Senior Brother Pang sneered, “I’ve heard about you, your courage truly isn’t small. You only just entered the Sect and have already stirred up so much trouble. It seems that Yan Xiu Ran suffered the loss of his Treasure Seizing Snake at your hands and you even committed a big enough mistake to be confined in the Ice Cliff by Protector Bian. Now you’ve just returned, and this is the mess you make?”

Yang Kai raised his brow slightly before snorting coldly, “The tree simply wishes for quiet, but the wind continues to howl!”

“Bold!” Senior Brother Pang snapped, “A little brat who only just joined the Sect dares to disregard the rules and caused trouble everywhere, it seems you have no redeeming values!”

Yang Kai’s face became cold as he solemnly said, “Isn’t Senior Brother Pang being too biased here, not understanding the whole story but already rendering judgement about me?”

“Senior Brother is teaching you for your own good, yet you dare argue back?” Senior Brother Pang looked angry as his Source Qi flared up, like he was ready to attack Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s heart sank seeing this. If the attitude of this Senior Brother Pang represented the attitude of Protector Miao, then today things would not be settled peacefully.

Just as he was preparing to summon the Monster Insect Queen and run rampant, Protector Miao waved his hand gently.

The furious Senior Brother Pang bowed his head and restrained his Source Qi fluctuations before stepping back docilely.

Miao Qi’s gaze swept across Yang Kai before landing on Zhou Yi, at which point he coldly declared, “Waste!”

Upon hearing this, Zhou Yi could not help turning pale.

He could naturally hear the deep dissatisfaction and disappointment in Miao Qi’s voice; after all, it was a fact that he was suppressed by Yang Kai, and nothing he said would be able to justify it.

Being defeated and held hostage by a Junior Brother at the Third-Order Origin King Realm was certainly a performance worthy of such an evaluation.

Zhou Yi realized that, no matter what, he would not be able to rise up in the Sect again from now on, causing both a sense of profound loss and infinite hatred to well up inside him.

If it were not for Yang Kai, how could Miao Qi have judged him so? Lowering his head, Zhou Yi grit his teeth and said nothing, but the extreme rage in his eyes could not be concealed.

At this time, Protector Miao turned back to Yang Kai and declared, “No matter what happened here today, everyone belongs to the same Sect, and since this old master has encountered this situation, he cannot just ignore it. Imprison all of them and throw them into the Bone Prison. Once Protector Bian returns, she can deal with it.”

After rendering his judgement, Miao Qi turned around and left.

Senior Brother Pang bowed and acknowledged Miao Qi’s orders.

After Miao Qi left, Senior Brother Pang turned around and yelled, “Did you not hear Protector Miao’s words?!”

Chu Fei and his followers stood frozen on the spot, with bitter, defeated looks on their faces, not having expected Protector Miao to handle today’s affairs in such a manner.

Yang Kai, on the other hand, looked happy because as long as Miao Qi didn’t directly attack him, there was still room for him to manoeuvre.

This was undoubtedly the best result Yang Kai could have hoped for.

Grinning, he called out, “Senior Brother Pang, it’s not that Junior Brother doesn’t want to obey Protector Miao’s command, but just look at Senior Brother Zhou’s eyes. Junior Brother is afraid if he releases him now, he will immediately attack... If that happens, heh heh, Junior Brother is quite weak and couldn’t possibly resist.”

“Still trying to act smart!?” With a cold snort, Senior Brother Pang assumed an air of authority and declared, “Rest assured, since Protector Miao has spoken, Zhou Yi would not dare disobey. Just let him go.”

“Since Senior Brother Pang has said so, Junior Brother will obey,” Yang Kai smiled and retracted his Golden Blood Threads and took his hand out from Zhou Yi’s chest, bringing with him a big splash of fresh blood.

At that last moment, Yang Kai also secretly urged his strength to explode inside Zhou Yi’s body, causing some damage.

Zhou Yi couldn’t help coughing up a mouthful of blood as he grit his teeth and glared at Yang Kai, “You...”

“Sorry, did I act too quickly? Should I insert my hand again and try once more?” Yang Kai asked innocently.

Zhou Yi nearly choked on his rage as he shouted, “You best pray you don’t fall into my hands one day, otherwise, you will definitely wish you had died here today!”

“Senior Brother Pang, he’s threatening me!” Yang Kai yelled immediately with a look of panic on his face.

Senior Brother Pang naturally ignored him and formed a series of seals with his hands before palming towards everyone present with an unhappy expression, including Liu Xian Yun.

The six people involved in today’s incident all had their cultivators sealed.

“Come with me!” Senior Brother Pang looked extremely impatient, wrapped everything in his Source Qi, and flew off in the direction of the Bone Prison with a wave of his hand.

In front of the Bone Prison, Yan Xiu Ran was still standing guard, and when he saw Senior Brother Pang arrive, he promptly greeted him with a smile.

Senior Brother Pang nodded lightly before saying, “Lock up these troublemakers and be sure to watch them carefully.”

“Yes,” Yan Xiu Ran replied before sweeping his eyes around, the next moment gawking as he pointed at Yang Kai, an expression of anger filling his face as he yelled, “It’s you... you bastard!”

“Heh heh, Senior Brother Yan, we meet again,” Yang Kai greeted him with a warm smile on his face.

Yan Xiu Ran couldn’t help his face from going cold as he snorted, “Good, good, good, I didn’t expect you to return to the Bone Prison so soon. Senior Brother will definitely entertain you well this time.”

“Then I’ll be imposing on Senior Brother’s hospitality,” Yang Kai spoke happily, as if he was not even afraid of death, causing Senior Brother Pang to shake his head in frustration once again.
