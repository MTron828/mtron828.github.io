“Human, Sir Yu Xiong’s temper is short, if you want to survive, you should admit your mistakes and apologize by kowtowing and you might just get to keep your life!” A Monster Race master yelled, as if trying to give instructions to Yang Kai. The charm of their Young Lady was obvious to all so no one thought it was entirely this human boy’s mistake.

“Acknowledge my mistakes and apologize by kowtowing...” Yang Kai touched his chin, as if he didn’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth as he continued staring at the enchanting woman with scorching eyes, a playful smile appearing on his face as he asked, “Beautiful, do you want me to do so?”

The audience was shocked by these words.

Everyone looked at Yang Kai in disbelief.

This Human... actually dared call their Young Lady ‘Beautiful?’ This was not just rudeness, but blatant sexual harassment!

Although the Young Lady was originally human, she had been accepted as the adopted daughter of Lady Tribal Lord for special reasons and had been instructed in cultivation personally by Chi Yue over the years. The Young Lady’s talent was world famous and even if the elite of the Monster Race stood before her they had to act politely and respectfully.

Yet now, a human actually tried to flirt with her in front of so many onlookers? Did he have a death wish?

“Bold!” A Monster Race master roared angrily.

To harass the Young Lady was an insult to the Monster Race and to Red Moon Tribal Lord!

No Monster Race cultivator could tolerate Yang Kai’s presumptuousness and immediately everyone in the hall became indignant and began releasing murderous intent.

Yu Xiong also froze for a moment, but after quickly recovering from his shock, he actually burst into laughter, pointed at Yang Kai, and said to the bewitching woman next to him, “Little Sister, this boy toy actually address you so loosely, only calling you by ‘beautiful’!”

“Am I not?” The enchantress glanced over at Yu Xiong lightly, her enrapturing eyes narrowing slightly.

Yu Xiong’s laughter immediately got stuck in his throat as he shrank his neck and quickly denied, “Brother naturally didn’t mean that, it’s just... I’ve never heard anyone call you that way, so I was surprised for a moment. En, this boy toy is too shameless, Big Brother will teach him a lesson for you!”

Saying so, he looked viciously towards Yang Kai.

In Red Moon Territory, Yu Xiong’s position was under one person while above ten thousand. He was the adopted son of the Red Moon Tribal Lord and his strength and status were incomparable to those of ordinary Monster Race masters.

His demeanor was also straightforward, courageous, and bold, so there were just two people who could make him back down.

One was naturally Red Moon Tribal Lord, while the other was this beautiful woman sitting to his right. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

If what Yu Xiong felt towards Red Moon Tribal Lord was a sense of awe, then what he felt for this little sister of his was deep admiration. In terms of aptitude and cultivation speed, his little sister’s talent vastly exceeded his own.

His adoptive mother had once said to him that his little sister was the most promising talent in Red Moon Territory besides Ba He and would definitely break through to the Origin King Realm! He was unable to match this.

“No need!” The beauty rejected Yu Xiong’s proposal.

“You’re letting him off? Isn’t that too lenient? He has to pay for his frivolousness!” Yu Xiong shook his head, somewhat unhappy.

The enchanting woman just smiled lightly, however, got up from her chair, and walked forward while saying with a laugh, “Let him off? Naturally, there’s no way that’s possible. Such a shameless man who clearly goes around loosely plucking flowers everywhere cannot go unpunished. I’ll personally put him in his place!”

“Uh... alright then,” Yu Xiong nodded, glancing towards Yang Kai while clearly taking pleasure in his misfortune, grinning as he said, “Boy toy, you’re finished now. If Father here was the one to make a move, you’d at least have a swift end, but with little sister taking action, heh heh heh...”

As soon as the Monster Race masters lined up on both sides of the hall heard that their Young Lady was going to handle this boy toy herself, all of them grinned as they began looking forward to the coming show.

On the other hand, this boy toy being able to receive their Young Lady’s lesson personally... it was also a kind of blessing, one many of the Monster Race masters were envious of.

A moment later, the enchantress arrived in front of Yang Kai and lifted her smooth, jade-like chin up slightly, giving her a noble and inviolable air while slightly revealing her slender neck-line, a dazzling sight to behold.

Yang Kai showed no fear as he continued smiling at her.

The woman grit her teeth as she slowly stretched out her hand, extending her jade finger as she poked Yang Kai’s chest.

Yu Xiong observed mockingly, expecting his little sister to use some cruel and inhuman ways to torture this shameless boy...

Numerous Monster Race masters also craned their necks as they watched expectantly...

Poking her jade finger onto Yang Kai’s chest, the coquettish woman said lightly, “You decide, should I dig out your heart, pull out your liver, or... split open your chest and take a look whether your insides are black or white!”

“Do you hate me so much?” Yang Kai touched his nose.

“Absolutely!” The woman lifted her chin slightly more, “I hate you to the bone... I wish I could tear your corpse into ten thousand pieces then burn your remains to ashes...”

“Haha...” Yang Kai smiled dryly.

While the enchantress was talking, her jade finger continued tracing over Yang Kai’s chest as she ground her teeth, as if she truly had a deep hatred for Yang Kai.

Yu Xiong’s face flushed with excitement, secretly paying attention to Yang Kai’s reaction.

This little sister of his never seemed to use particularly harsh methods, but with her ability, it should be a simple task for her to make this boy toy suffer.

He was just waiting for this boy toy’s five viscera and six organs to be melted into a pool of pus after being poked by his little sister.

However... why did it seem like his little sister’s tone carried so much sadness with it? Yu Xiong scratched his head, somewhat puzzled.

“Don’t make trouble!” Yang Kai showed a helpless look before grabbing the enchantress’ little hand. The other party tried to shake him off but failed to escape his grip.

The assembled Monster Race masters were immediately filled with righteous indignation as their eyes nearly spat fire.

Impudence! This boy toy not only dared to sexually harass their Young Lady, now he had even gone so far as to frivolously touch her hand; how could this be tolerated?

All of them were about to rush out to teach Yang Kai an unforgettable lesson, but then they saw a shy look on their Young Lady’s face as well as a hint of blush on her delicate cheeks and slender neck. Even her raised chin drooped down, making her arrogant air instantly turn docile...

What exactly just happened? Why was their Young Lady reacting like this?

The gathered Monster Race cultivators were all dumbfounded.

“You bastard!” The enchanting woman cursed under her breath as an aggrieved look filled her beautiful eyes, “Didn’t I tell you that I’m on Monster Emperor Star? Why didn’t you come see me until now?”

“I couldn’t help it, I had no way to carry out a long-distance voyage through the Star Field so I was unable to reach you,” Yang Kai explained helplessly, “Even this time, arriving here was a lucky stroke, but in the end, didn’t I still come? Qing Luo, don’t be angry, it will just create a scene here for everyone to see.”

“They’ve been watching this scene the whole time already,” Shan Qing Luo glared at Yang Kai, “Didn’t you want things to turn out like this? Are you satisfied now?”

“Haha,” Yang Kai grinned, “Actually, I didn’t expect that it would be you meeting me and Little Senior Sister here, so if anyone was caught off guard it should be me.”

“If that’s really the case, then I won’t hold it against you,” Shan Qing Luo snorted softly.

The two of them affectionately and sweetly interacting with one another caused many of the Monster Race masters in the hall to stare dumbly.

By now, all of them had obviously figured out that their Young Lady and this boy toy knew each other from a long time ago, and their relationship was also very close, otherwise they would not have put on such a flirtatious scene.

This only made it harder for everyone to accept though.

Yu Xiong also gawked as his eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets.

He had never seen his little sister act so tenderly, and when she spoke with this boy toy, she flashed a look of complete satisfaction and happiness!

Yu Xiong had seen his little sister pining in loneliness for many years, but now, her contentment stood in sharp contrast to her solitary figure.

“Your position here seems to be very high,” Yang Kai commented lightly.

To be honest, seeing Shan Qing Luo sitting at the head of this hall had really surprised him. Even though he had known that Shan Qing Luo was accepted as an adopted daughter by Red Moon Tribal Lord, she was still from a different race so Yang Kai had originally thought that Shan Qing Luo would be having a difficult time here. After seeing her though, he realized he was completely wrong.

“En, Adoptive Mother regards me very highly, so no one from the Monster Race dares to disrespect me,” Shan Qing Luo replied softly.

“Who is he then? He seems to hold the same status as you,” Yang Kai raised his head to look at Yu Xiong.

“He’s the same as me, taken in by Adoptive Mothers. In name, he is my big brother, but he is an orthodox Monster Race,” Shan Qing Luo explained softly, after which she saw the slight trace of hostility in Yang Kai’s eyes disappear.

This discovery made her heart leap for joy.

What it meant for a man to be jealous of his woman, Shan Qing Luo knew better than anyone else.

“Brother-in-law, nice to meet you!” Yang Kai suddenly raised his head and smiled at Yu Xiong, calling out loudly.

Yu Xiong nearly fell backwards on the spot!

If Yu Xiong had a guess about their relationship after seeing his little sister and this boy toy act so intimately just now, the title Yang Kai had just addressed him by, confirmed it.

His little sister and this boy toy... actually had that kind of relationship!

How was that possible though? Yu Xiong stared at Shan Qing Luo in disbelief, but he could clearly see that she had no intention of denying it, instead just smiling shyly.

Yu Xiong suddenly heard from cracking sounds and couldn’t help glancing around at the other Monster Race males in the hall, quickly discovering many of them wearing looks of grief and anguish, as if they just had a knife driven through their hearts. Many were also glaring hatefully at Yang Kai, as if they wished to turn their gazes into sharp arrows that could piece and kill this boy toy immediately.

“Uh...” Yu Xiong found himself somewhat unable to keep up with the situation and also at a loss for what to say Yang Kai, but when his eyes landed on Xia Ning Chang, who had been standing quietly beside Yang Kai the whole time, he couldn’t help asking, “Then what is your relationship with this young lady?”

“Little Senior Sister is my woman!” Yang Kai smiled as he stretched out a hand to wrap around Xia Ning Chang’s waist while using his other to embrace Shan Qing Luo.

Shan Qing Luo struggled slightly but soon complied with Yang Kai’s meaning, nestling her blushing face into his arms.

Yu Xiong’s jaw dropped as he stared at the confidently smiling boy in front of him, a feeling of admiration spontaneously welled up inside of him as he gave a big thumbs-up.

This was a real winner in life! The true role model for all boy toys!
