“Why are you being so unreasonable? I saw this thing first and even paid for it, so why should I give it to you?” Mo Xiao Qi was holding something behind her back, facing off against a group of a dozen men without the slightest fear.

“Girl, there are some things beyond your control. Since my Young Lord is interested in this item, he must have it. We will pay you double the Source Crystals you bought it for so please hand it over and we can avoid any unpleasantness,” On the other side, a man coldly snorted and as he spoke, he intentionally released his aura in a threatening manner.

“What would I need your Source Crystals for?” Mo Xiao Qi pursed her lips, turning her head to the elderly stall owner and saying, “Tell me, did I buy it from you first?”

The old man could not help frowning as he glanced between Mo Xiao Qi and then dozen or so menacing men and awkwardly laughed, “I... I guess?”

“What do you mean ‘you guess?’” Mo Xiao Qi looked at him in amazement, “Didn’t I give you the Source Crystals already? I even gave you some extra as a sign of gratitude, but you didn’t even thank me.”

The old man’s mouth twitched as he fell silent.

The young man who had been surrounded by cultivators on the other side suddenly chuckled and turned to the old seller, “Old man, how many Source Crystals did this girl pay you?”

The old man’s expression became embarrassed as he hesitated for a moment before stating, “Eight thousand!”

“Eight thousand, en, not too many. This Young Lord will pay you ten thousand, so why not sell that item to me?” The young man looked at the old man with a smile.

“Ten thousand?” The old man was overjoyed when he heard this and nodded hurriedly, “Good, good...” After agreeing, he looked embarrassed again though, “But this thing has already been bought by this girl...”

“So what? This is business: The one who offers the higher price wins,” The young man smiled heartily and looked at Mo Xiao Qi. “Girl, you should understand clearly now. This Young Lord will buy this thing for ten thousand Source Crystals, please hand it over...”

“The higher price wins?” Mo Xiao Qi grit her teeth angrily and before the young man could finish, she shouted, “Good, then I’ll pay twenty thousand for it.”

Hearing this, the old seller was both surprised and delighted, never having expected that one of his items would sell for such a high price. At the same time, he was a bit annoyed with himself. Since these two parties were willing to fight so vigorously over this item, clearly it was quite valuable, but he himself was unable to recognize it and had just sold it as an ordinary trinket, allowing others to pick up a bargain.

The young man frowned, a ruthless expression appearing on his face as he shouted, “This Young Lord will pay thirty thousand then! You think you have more Source Crystals than this Young Lord?”

“Fifty thousand!” Mo Xiao Qi threw out a number lightly, but they pounded down on the young man’s head like a hammer, causing him to even shrink his neck slightly.

The young man lost all patience at that moment and roared, “Girl! Do you know who this Young Lord is? How dare you try to steal from me!”

“I don’t know who you are,” Mo Xiao Qi looked at him with clear disgust, “Besides, aren’t you the one trying to steal from me? You’re a liar!”

“Good! You little skank. It seems you will not regret unless you see your coffin! If so, this Young Lord will let you understand, I am Flying Saint Palace’s Young Palace Master, Ning Yuan Cheng. If you understand your place now, hand over that thing and then scram, if you don’t... Heh heh heh, this Young Lord will make both you and that thing stay behind!”

Ning Yuan Cheng smiled deviously as he shot a malicious look towards Mo Xiao Qi.

“Flying Saint Palace!”

“He’s Ning Yuan Cheng?”

“That girl is in big trouble.”

After Ning Yuan Cheng’s voice fell, before Mo Xiao Qi could even respond, the surrounding crowd began to whisper among themselves slightly.

After all, while Flying Saint Palace was not a first-class force in the Southern Territory and could not be mentioned in the same sentence as Heavenly Martial Holy Land, Orthodoxy Temple, or Azure Sun Temple, it still had some reputation and was far stronger than the forces around Maplewood City.

As Flying Saint Palace’s Young Palace Master, Ning Yuan Cheng’s reputation was also not small. At least in the Southern Territory, he was a somewhat known figure.

During this period of time, because of the appearance of a Luan Feng, many great forces had sent representatives to Clear Jade Mountain to investigate the situation, Flying Saint Palace was no exception, and the leader of its delegation was none other than Young Palace Master Ning Yuan Cheng.

However, after exploring Clear Jade Mountain for some time and gaining nothing, Ning Yuan Cheng had decided to stop over in Maplewood City briefly, ultimately leading to this encounter in the black market.

Ning Yuan Cheng had a smug expression on his face, thinking that after announcing his name and the great force behind him, this little woman who did not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth would bow down and apologize, perhaps even offering herself to him to garner his forgiveness.

[En, although this little girl has that ugly birthmark on her face, her figure is really outstanding, especially her chest. They’ll be great fun to play with.]

Once it was night, after the clothes were removed and the lights were extinguished, what one’s face looked like made no difference.

“Flying Saint Palace? What is that? I’ve never heard of it,” Mo Xiao Qi frowned slightly, a blank look on her face.

Ning Yuan Cheng’s proud expression instantly stiffened while the other Flying Saint Palace cultivators wore gloomy faces.

“Bold! How dare you insult my Saint Palace! Capture her! This Young Lord will let her know what Flying Saint Palace is!” Ning Yuan Cheng shouted with a fierce expression on his face.

A dozen or so Origin Kings took action without hesitation.

Maplewood City was a small, out of the way town, whose City Lord was only a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator. As for the two Vice City Lords, they were just First-Order Dao Sources, making for three Dao Source Realm masters in total, not a force Flying Saint Palace needed to put in their eyes. What’s more, this was the black market of Maplewood City, so even if violence was used, no one would dare raise any fuss.

So what if the City Lord’s Mansion investigated later. Would they dare oppose Flying Saint Palace?

Out of the dozen or so people who rushed out, three of them moved faster than the rest and arrived around Mo Xiao Qi in an instant, two of them reaching for her delicate shoulders while one patted his palm towards her lower abdomen.

From their respective palms, power surged.

They had been ordered by their Young Lord to capture Mo Xiao Qi, not to kill her, so they held back.

The onlookers all exclaimed as they showed looks of pity.

After all, a group of men were acting together to bully a little girl. Although this little girl was also clearly a Third-Order Origin King, just the situation alone was enough to arouse the sympathy of others.

Yang Kai also could not bear to watch what he knew was about to happen and turned his eyes aside.

However, his pity was not aimed at Mo Xiao Qi, but rather at the Flying Saint Palace cultivators who had attacked her.

What happened on Clear Jade Mountain that day was still fresh in Yang Kai’s memory...

Even though he had cultivated the Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art and had a physique many times more powerful than cultivators in his realm, his hand had been bloodied when he touched Mo Xiao Qi, so what fate awaited these three was quite obvious to him.

What’s more, Yang Kai had only wanted to lead Mo Xiao Qi away with him at that time and thus did not use any of his strength, but these three actually attacked her, so the consequences...

“Ah...*

Sure enough, a series of screams rang out, causing all the surrounding cultivators to stare dumbfounded at the scene before them, their jaws dropped to the ground.

The two cultivators who had grabbed towards Mo Xiao Qi’s shoulders were thrown through the air the moment they laid hands on her, their palms bloodied and torn apart to the point where their bones were visible. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

As for the cultivator who palmed towards Mo Xiao Qi’s lower abdomen, he was even more miserable. After his palm landed, while Mo Xiao Qi stumbled backwards a bit from the force, the man actually let out a pitiful scream as he fell backwards, his hand feeling like it was on fire.

Looking closer, at some point, a distorted, horrifying looking face seal had appeared on this man’s hand. As for the man himself, a terrifying howling sound echoed throughout his Knowledge Sea.

The cultivator froze in place instantly as a huge phantom face appeared in his Knowledge Sea and began to drain his Spiritual Energy at an astonishing pace, all the time showing a wicked and intoxicated expression.

This man was completely unable to resist and the light in his eyes quickly dimmed.

“What?” Ning Yuan Cheng saw this scene and immediately cried out in shock.

Everything that happened in front of him here was beyond his ability to understand.

It was clear that his three subordinates were the ones attacking Mo Xiao Qi while she had just stood there, her face flustered, as if she did not even know how to defend herself, but while she was perfectly fine. His three subordinates were the ones who had suffered severely.

Two serious injuries and one death, this kind of result made Nin Yuan Cheng doubt his eyes.

Just what kind of Secret Technique had she used?

Was this girl just playing pig to eating a tiger?

Could she actually be an old witch who had lived for thousands of years and was hiding her cultivation while pretending to be innocent here?

Various thoughts flashed across Ning Yuan Cheng’s mind, causing cold sweat to drip down his back.

“Retreat!” At that moment, the rest of the cultivators who were rushing towards Mo Xiao Qi heard a loud shout in their ears.

All of them realized how precarious their situation was and reacted extremely quickly, not daring to attack Mo Xiao Qi as they scurried back in fright.

A man then walked out from behind Ning Yuan Cheng with a gloomy expression on his face. He was a middle-aged man who had an unassuming look to him and had been standing behind Ning Yuan Cheng silently until now, a calm look on his face. However, now, he actually had to stand in front of Ning Yuan Cheng to protect him.

As the Young Palace Master of Flying Saint Palace, Ning Yuan Cheng had one or two real masters protecting him while he was out travelling.

This middle-aged man was a master from Flying Saint Palace who was responsible for protecting Ning Yuan Cheng, a Second-Order Dao Source Realm master named Liu Yi Zhi.

As a Second-Order Dao Source Realm master, his vision was naturally sharp, so it only took him an instant to realize that Mo Xiao Qi had some kind of extraordinary background. Just now, he had seen that the situation was bad and ordered the other Flying Saint Palace disciples to fall back.

As he stood in front of Ning Yuan Cheng, blocking all angles from which he could be attacked, Liu Yi Zhi stared at Mo Xiao Qi solemnly, seemingly trying to peer through her secrets.

“You... you... what do you want to do?” Mo Xiao Qi didn’t come back to her senses until this moment and though obviously still frightened, tried to put on a strong act and shouted, “You... don’t come here, I’m not good to provoke, if you’re not careful... I’ll punch you!”

The surrounding crowd could help rolling their eyes when they saw and heard this.

[You not being good to provoke is obvious... Why bother saying it yourself?]
