Hearing his words, Ling Yin Qin and her crew paled.

The two strongest Masters of the Solitary Void Sealed World were in front of them and about to come to blows, how could they not be scared? When Immortals fought, it was the mortals who would suffer the consequences! If these two started to fight here, everyone would become involved. At that time, Ice Heart Pavilion’s Pavilion Master wouldn’t have the time to worry about their safety, and a moment of carelessness would be enough to seal their fate.

Hearing Chi Ri’s threat, Bing Yun said coldly, “Chi Ri, although this Queen said that she doesn’t want you as an enemy, it isn’t because I’m afraid of you. If you keep being so forceful, this Queen will have no choice but to respond in kind.”

Chi Ri narrowed his eyes, his anger palpable.

He had known Bing Yun for many years, but it was the first time she had used this kind of tone when speaking to him. In the past, even if she was impatient, she wouldn’t make it too obvious. She was always as cold as ice and rarely revealed her emotions, but today, she was different. Her words were as sharp as a blade, and she didn’t seem to fear him at all.

This enraged Chi Ri, as he’d always had an edge over Bing Yun. Although their cultivations were almost identical, the same couldn’t be said for the resources at their disposal. For this reason, the difference between them kept increasing with time.

He felt that it was only a question of time before he subdued Bing Yun, making her his personal property, but now, that very same woman was rebelling! How could he not get angry?

“It seems you really want this King to seize you and drag you back!” Chi Ri’s face darkened as he decided that he would shatter Bing Yun’s spirit today, even if it meant getting injured. He wanted to let her know about the difference in strength between them.

“Yang Kai, take everyone and leave first,” Bing Yun didn’t talk nonsense and quietly instructed Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gently nodded, handing over the High-Rank Hundred Revolutions Emperor Yuan Pills that he’d refined in the past few days as he whispered, “In that case, Junior will depart first and await Senior at the destination.”

He wasn’t worried about her safety as she’d already recovered to her peak thanks to the ten million High-Rank Source Crystals he had given her. Moreover, she had several High-Rank Hundred Revolutions Emperor Yuan Pills with her. How could Chi Ri possibly defeat her?

Bing Yun couldn’t lose!

Yang Kai turned and winked at Ling Yin Qin and the others. At the same time, he made a few hand seals, urging the sea ship to move forward.

Chi Ri didn’t care about what Yang Kai and the others were planning, neither did he try to stop them, he simply stood mid-air, gazing at Bing Yun. As long as he could stop Bing Yun, he didn’t care if the others lived or died.

Emperor Pressure filled the area above the sea, looking almost tangible as it clashed, setting off terrifying storms. The surrounding World Principles began to warp under this pressure, causing the world to dim.

Pang Guang, who was behind Chi Ri, felt so much pressure that his face paled.

Although he was also in the Emperor Realm, he was much weaker than Chi Ri and Bing Yun. The two Masters hadn’t even started fighting, but the pressure that exuded from their bodies was enough to make Pang Guang feel unwell.

He was shocked to realize that the disparity between them was so big.

Since staying was useless, he raised his head and looked in the direction Yang Kai had left, his figure flickering as he prepared to give chase.

As he couldn’t intervene in the battle here, he decided to catch up to Yang Kai and settle their old score.

But before he could take action, Bing Yun pointed at him from afar.

Ice Principles were unleashed with the movement of her finger, shrouding Pang Guang’s body.

Pang Guang felt a gust of deadly air blow across his face, one so cold that it seemed capable of freezing even his Soul, instantly immobilizing him.

If he were at his peak, he might have been able to resist a bit, but now, with his wounds still yet to fully recover, there was no way he could escape from Bing Yun’s pressure.

In desperation, he loudly shouted, “Sir City Lord, save me!”

Chi Ri didn’t really care about him, but as soon as Bing Yun made her move, he instinctively swung his sleeve, sending out a wave of hot air, dispersing the bone-chilling cold.

Pang Guang instantly felt much better and hurried to circulate his strength, retreating more than a dozen kilometres as he gasped for breath, fear still lingering on his face.

“This King is in front of you, and yet you’ve the mind to take care of others? Don’t look down on me!” Chi Ri shouted.

Bing Yun’s pretty face darkened as she said in amazement, “You’ve been concealing your strength all along!”

Although he merely swung his sleeve, Bing Yun instantly became aware of this detail. Each time he fought with her over that cup of tea, he wasn’t using his full strength! Only now was he revealing his real strength.

At the same time, she rejoiced once again for meeting Yang Kai, her lucky star. He had given her ten million High-Rank Source Crystals all at once, which allowed her to recover her strength completely. If not for his help, there was no way their plan would have a chance at success.

“You also seem to have recovered your strength,” Chi Ri was likewise surprised. Today, he was planning to completely crush Bing Yun and make her submit, but now, it was unclear who would come out on top! After realizing this fact, Chi Ri’s expression became ugly.

But even if the two of them were surprised, they were still Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters, with extraordinary mental fortitude, so they swiftly regained their composure.

Bing Yun looked past Chi Ri, fixing her gaze on the deathly pale Pang Guang. Her jade white hand gently grasped at the void in the next moment as a snow-white sword appeared in her hand. This sword was just like her – pure and flawless, like the most exquisite piece of art in the world, devoid of any kind of murderous aura.

With this sword in hand, Bing Yun’s momentum skyrocketed and she slashed at Pang Guang, “Clear Sky Snowfall!”

When she slashed out, the sky itself dimmed, as the Heavens and Earth inverted.

Ice Principles filled the surrounding area, quickly freezing the churning seawater.

Then, snow began falling!

Goose feather-sized snowflakes came pouring down, turning the whole world a magnificent white.

Pang Guang, who bore the brunt of the attack, wasn’t able to react as he blankly gazed at the beautiful scenery, completely immersed in it. He revealed an intoxicated expression, and even stretched out his hand to catch the snowflakes drifting in the wind.

His exposed skin and hair were quickly covered in frost, with the rest of his body rapidly turning into an ice statue.

“Grand Sun Covers The Sky!” Chi Ri bellowed and a dazzling sun appeared amidst the world of ice and snow. The unparalleled heat it brought dispersed the snow in the sky and melted the frozen sea.

Two powers of completely different nature clashed against one another on this stretch of sea a hundred kilometres in diametre, quickly cancelling each other out.

No clear winner emerged from this contest.

Pang Guang returned to his senses at that moment, and when he recalled the beautiful scenery just now, bean-sized beads of sweat appeared on his forehead and continually trickled down.

He understood that he’d been standing at the edge of the gates of hell, and if Chi Ri hadn’t helped him, he would now be dead!

The fact that a top Master like Bing Yun had sneak attacked him made Pang Guang angry; however, he understood why she’d done so. She was afraid that he would chase after Yang Kai and the others, so she made the first move to gain an advantage. Unfortunately, Chi Ri stopped her before she could succeed.

Seeing the situation, Pang Guang hurried to leave and chase after Yang Kai. This wasn’t a battle he could meddle in, and staying here was enough to put his life in danger. If he really got involved, he would die for sure.

The only thing he could do was to follow Yang Kai and the others in the hope of disrupting Bing Yun’s concentration.

Although he wasn’t Bing Yun’s match, he was more than capable of dealing with Yang Kai’s group. As long as he captured them, he could threaten Bing Yun with their lives and perhaps make her surrender.

If he made Chi Ri happy, he’d have a good life later.

“Do you think you can escape?” Seeing Pang Guang trying to flee, Bing Yun guessed what he was scheming, grit her teeth, and stabbed her sword out into the void.

A pure white ice flower shot towards Pang Guang from the tip of her sword. The ice flower bloomed midway, preparing to engulf Pang Guang.

Chi Ri’s figure flashed, appearing in front of the ice flower. Raising his fist, he violently punched, shattering the flower to pieces.

“Still trying to fight others while this King is here? You’re really looking down on me!” Chi Ri sneered.

Bing Yun furrowed her brow as she helplessly watched Pang Guang’s figure disappear. Fighting Chi Ri would require all of her attention; she didn’t have spare energy to deal with Pang Guang.

Her chest heaved as she took a deep breath, and in the next moment, her anxiety disappeared, replaced by calmness and strong determination.

She knew that she had to deal with Chi Ri if she wanted to chase after Pang Guang, and if she wanted to deal with Chi Ri, she couldn’t afford to hold back or get distracted.

Seeing Bing Yun’s change, Chi Ri was surprised; however, he didn’t show it and continued, “Bing Yun, all the people on that ship will die because of you. If you obediently surrender now, this King will treat you well in the future.”

The reason he mentioned Yang Kai and the others was to disrupt Bing Yun’s concentration.

However, Bing Yun remained unmoved, simply lifting her sword as the surrounding Ice Principles surged towards Chi Ri.

Chi Ri loudly roared. Despite his anger, he didn’t dare to take Bing Yun lightly, using all of his ability to battle her.

Two figures moved back and forth across the sea’s surface. Principles clashed, Heaven and Earth trembled, oceans flipped, and all the World Energy within ten thousand kilometres became chaotic. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Even if the Star Boundary was taken as a whole, it was rare to witness a battle to the death between two Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters. What was even rarer was that their strengths were well matched, and the Principle Strengths and Divine Abilities they possessed mutually restrained one another. The battle was absolutely breathtaking.
