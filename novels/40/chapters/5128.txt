Miao Fei Ping’s temperament was undoubtedly firm and steady; he did not falter even in this situation.

Until he suddenly heard the Ancestor’s voice.

Logically speaking, if one were to be disturbed at such a critical moment, their mind would definitely be shaken. In the best-case scenario, they would suffer from cultivation dissonance, and in the worst-case scenario, they might even die on the spot.

Nonetheless, this did not happen to Miao Fei Ping, because at the same time the Ancestor’s voice was transmitted to him, a gentle force stabilized his state of mind, allowing him to avoid this calamity. Even the berserk Emperor Qi in his body calmed down.

When he opened his eyes, Miao Fei Ping saw a smiling man standing in front of him. It was none other than the Ancestor.

Miao Fei Ping hurriedly stood up and respectfully bowed, “Disciple greets Ancestor!”

Yang Kai lightly nodded. At this moment, he was nothing more than a Soul Avatar, just like when he travelled across his Small Universe all those years ago. Nonetheless, the Soul Avatar in Miao Fei Ping’s eyes was equivalent to the arrival of the Ancestor’s true body. He didn’t dare to show any disrespect.

“It’s been hard on you all these years.”

Only 20 years had passed in the outside world since the establishment of the Void Dao Temple, so 80 years had passed in the Small Universe. Over the past 80 years, the number of disciples the Void Dao Temple had accepted had reached over 2,000, each and every one of them a Dragon among men.

With Miao Fei Ping acting as the Temple Master, the Deacons chosen by the Dao Temple all diligently guided these disciples. He had truly worked hard over these years; after all, the cultivation of these chosen disciples wasn’t high. Many of them were children who had never cultivated before. Taking care of them was indeed a daunting task.

There were many benefits to managing various affairs of the Dao Temple, the most direct of which was that one could obtain a fixed amount of contribution points every month, and these contribution points could be exchanged for cultivation resources in the Dao Temple, but the downside was that it delayed one’s cultivation.

If not for this, Miao Fei Ping would not have taken a century to finally reach this point with his aptitude.

“Disciple is honoured by Ancestor’s concern, but it was not difficult at all,” Miao Fei Ping replied respectfully.

Yang Kai nodded his acknowledgement, “Right now, you’re just a step away from the Open Heaven Realm, but if you want to reach it, you must make a choice.”

“A choice?” Miao Fei Ping was puzzled, “Ancestor, please explain.”

Yang Kai continued, “With your aptitude and current foundation, it may be a bit risky to break through to the Sixth Order, but the risks aren’t that great. Do you know why you still haven’t been able to break through even after being in a retreat for so long?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Miao Fei Ping shook his head, “Perhaps this Disciple is slow-witted. Perhaps I will not be able to comprehend the fleeting opportunity to break through even if I put in all my effort. But Ancestor can rest assured, this Disciple will definitely redouble his efforts in cultivating so as not to disappoint you.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “If you can be considered slow-witted, then there aren’t many smart people in Void World.”

“The reason you can’t break through is not because your comprehension or aptitude is lacking, but because of the environment. As long as you remain in Void World, you will never be able to break through the shackles of the Emperor Realm and advance to the Open Heaven Realm.”

Yang Kai replied, looking at him with a smile, “Because Void World is my Small Universe.”

Miao Fei Ping was rooted to the spot, stunned.

Yang Kai continued, “When Emperor Realm cultivators condense their Dao Seals and gather the Powers of Yin, Yang, and Five Elements, they will be able to form a Small Universe World inside their body, thus advancing to the Open Heaven Realm. The Open Heaven Realm is divided into nine Orders. First to Third-Order is the Low-Rank, Fourth to Sixth-Order is the Mid-Rank, Seventh-Order and above is High-Rank. Low-Rank and Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters’ Small Universes are immaterial and illusory, while High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters’ Small Universes are solid and tangible, just like this Void World.”

“Every Open Heaven Realm cultivator has their own Small Universe, and the World Force of that Small Universe is the foundation of the Open Heaven Realm’s strength. Even if two people cultivate the same Secret Art and comprehend the same Grand Dao, after they reach the Open Heaven Realm, the World Force in their Small Universes will naturally be different.”

“This kind of difference is unique to every Open Heaven Realm Master. Other Open Heaven Realm Masters might be able to refine it for their own use to increase their strength, but if the difference is too great, it will instead become impurities that destroy their foundation.”

“If you broke through to the Open Heaven Realm inside my Small Universe, the World Force you unconsciously release at the moment of ascension will contaminate my foundation and affect my cultivation, so I cannot allow you to break through in Void World. This can be considered a restriction of the entire Void World, do you understand?”

It was not that hard for Miao Fei Ping to understand, but after learning that the world he had been living in was actually the Ancestor’s Small Universe, he was still shocked and couldn’t recover for a long time.

“If you want to enter the Open Heaven Realm, the only option is to leave my Small Universe and enter the vast Outer Universe.” Yang Kai’s eyes became solemn, “However, the environment I am in right now is not safe. If you leave Void World, your life will constantly be at risk, and you will have to fight against powerful enemies. Even with my strength, I may not be able to protect you.”

Miao Fei Ping muttered, “Is this the choice Ancestor spoke of?”

Yang Kai nodded his affirmation, “That’s right, whether to remain in Void World as an Emperor Realm Master, or take the risk and leave Void World to achieve the Open Heaven Realm is up to you.”

In the face of such a sudden choice, even an Emperor Realm Master like Miao Fei Ping was a little hesitant.

Yang Kai observed his expression and lightly nodded, “You can take your time and inform me after you have made a decision.”

Saying so, his figure gradually started to fade as he prepared to leave.

Before he could go though, Miao Fei Ping suddenly raised his head and asked, “Ancestor, are Junior Sister Zhao Ya and Senior Brother Zhao Ye Bai still in Void World?”

Yang Kai’s figure solidified again as he shook his head, “They left long ago.”

Miao Fei Ping let out a long sigh. Although he had suspected it, it was only now that he got the confirmation. He lightly nodded his acknowledgement before asking, “Since Junior Sister Zhao Ya and Senior Brother Zhao Ye Bai have long since left Void World, I assume they will advance to the Open Heaven Realm in the future?”

Yang Kai pondered for a moment before replying, “Naturally, but their situation is different from yours. They are currently in another Great World, where they don’t have to be worried about external threats. So, there is no need to worry.”

“May I ask what Order those two will reach when they break through?”

“If everything goes according to plan, they should reach the Seventh Order!”

“Seventh-Order!” Miao Fei Ping chuckled, “As expected of those two, but the difference between the Sixth and Seventh Order is only one Order, the difference isn’t too great.”

Saying so, Miao Fei Ping cupped his fist and declared his choice, “This Disciple wishes to advance to the Open Heaven Realm. I ask Ancestor to help!”

Yang Kai looked at him, slightly narrowing his eyes, “Have you thought your decision through? Don’t try to compete with others, only follow your heart.”

Yang Kai happily nodded, “Your heart is righteous indeed. Since that is the case, I shall grant your wish.”

Miao Fei Ping once again cupped his fist in gratitude, “Many thanks, Ancestor, but… after this Disciple leaves, who will manage Void Dao Temple? Please make a decision.”

Yang Kai asked, “Who do you recommend?”

Miao Fei Ping pondered for a moment, “Deacon Tang Wen is steady and virtuous, he is also fair in his conduct. He is a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, so his cultivation is enough to convince the others. After this Disciple leaves, I believe he will be the appropriate choice to assume the position of Temple Master.”

“Tang Wen!” Yang Kai meaningfully looked at him, “He’s not from Seven Stars Sect, he seems to be from Stalwart Pavilion, right?”

Miao Fei Ping justified, “This Disciple believes that the Ancestor created the Void Dao Temple to select talents from all over the world, presumably to fight against a powerful enemy that this Disciple doesn’t know about. Since that is the case, this Disciple doesn’t dare to have any selfish motives. Seven Stars Sect has been rapidly developing these past few years and has already become the number one Sect in Void World. If another Elder from the Seven Stars Sect were to take over the position of Temple Master, I’m afraid that he would become too arrogant and dishonour Ancestor’s original intention to create the Dao Temple.”

Yang Kai agreed with a smile, “You’re wise. Since that’s the case, Tang Wen will take over the Void Dao Temple.” He pondered for a moment before continuing, “Let’s put on a show before you leave.”

“A show?” Miao Fei Ping was puzzled.

Half a day later, Miao Fei Ping summoned all of the Void Dao Temple Deacons and announced that he would be advancing soon, and that he would like to take care of Void Dao Temple’s affairs before entering retreat.

The Deacons were both shocked and envious. After working in the Dao Temple, they naturally had a better understanding of the Open Heaven Realm than others. Everyone had been working towards this goal all these years, but the fastest among them had only refined three materials and was still far from breaking through.

When they suddenly heard Temple Master Miao Fei Ping say that he was about to break through, they were naturally extremely envious.

Although they were envious, they still congratulated him.

After making some arrangements, Miao Fei Ping made a trip back to the Seven Stars Sect to inform the Sect Master Shang Guan Ji and the Elders that he was about to enter retreat to break through.

Soon, all of the Emperor Realm Masters in Void World knew that Miao Fei Ping was about to break the Emperor Realm’s shackles. The Emperor Realm Masters were naturally looking forward to it.

It had to be known that this was the first time in the entire history of Void World that someone was about to rise above the Emperor Realm. Whether he succeeded or failed would affect the future development of the entire world’s Martial Dao, so it naturally garnered a lot of attention.

Furthermore, personally witnessing this breakthrough would be greatly beneficial to them in the future.

Miao Fei Ping soon went into the retreat.

All the top Sects were constantly trying to find out whether Miao Fei Ping had succeeded or failed in his retreat, but none of the Deacons knew, because after Miao Fei Ping went into seclusion, they had received no word from him; no one even knew if he was alive or dead.

On a certain day after about a month, Void World suddenly shook as dazzling multi-coloured lights filled the sky and a powerful aura suddenly overflowed from the Void Dao Temple.

This aura clearly surpassed the Emperor Realm.

The higher-ups of the various great Sects were beside themselves and immediately turned their eyes towards the Void Dao Temple.

Under everyone’s gaze, a figure suddenly stepped out from the Void Dao Temple. It was none other than the first Temple Master, Miao Fei Ping!

But at this moment, Miao Fei Ping was surrounded by a dazzling glow, making him look like a Deity descending from the Heavens. The aura emanating from his body made all the Emperors yearn to achieve the same.
