[This smelly brat is really troublesome to deal with.] Chi Yue cursed to herself.

However, she hadn’t expected Yang Kai to easily agree; after all, how could this shrewd brat not ask about such details?

“Fine,” Chi Yue sighed, “The reason why this Queen needs you to take it is because only you can. Although that top master from my Monster Race fell long ago, his Origin Essence Crystal is not something that can easily be obtained. Any attempt to interfere with it will cause it to resist, likely leading it to self-destruct, leaving nothing behind.”

“It has sentience?” Yang Kai was stunned.

“No, it only possesses a trace of the Remnant Soul of that Monster Race master,” Chi Yue slowly shook her head, “I need it in order to comprehend the mysteries of the Third-Order Origin King Realm, and only you can suppress it the moment you encounter it with the power of your Golden Divine Dragon Source. Do you understand?

“En, Junior understands...” Yang Kai nodded, “But Junior is curious, since Senior wants to obtain it so badly, why not go retrieve it yourself? With your means, suppressing it should be easy, right?”

“You must be joking!” Chi Yue snorted angrily, “Don’t you know that Green Mountains Star has a Star Master? It’s fine sneaking a few Monster Race Juniors into the Blood Prison, but if this Queen were to go to Green Mountains Star in person, how could that old dog just stand by? This Queen isn’t foolish enough to fight with him inside his territory!”

“Ah, Green Mountains Star actually has a Star Master?” Yang Kai was stunned, “So, you’re saying that Green Mountains Star has a Third-Order Origin King Realm master?”

“Who knows how that old dog obtained such good fortune? With just a Second-Order Origin King cultivation, he dared to refine Green Mountains Star’s Star Source and managed to succeed by some annoying miracle!” Chi Yue pretty face distorted somewhat, as if she was familiar with that Star Master.

Yang Kai gently nodded. If this was the case, then everything made sense. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

With a Star Master guarding Green Mountains Star, Chi Yue really wouldn’t dare go there easily. With both of them having Second-Order Origin King cultivation, if they were to fight somewhere else, they might be tied, but on Green Mountains Star, Chi Yue definitely would not be that Star Masters’ opponent!

On top of that, since the core left-over from that Monster Race master, also known as an Origin Essence Crystal, was extremely sensitive, any attempt to interfere with it would lead to unpredictable consequences; however, the power of the Golden Divine Dragon’s Dragon Pressure would have an incredible suppressive effect on it!

It would be similar to how Yang Kai suppressed Xue Lian before.

“That is the proposal of this Queen, whether you want to agree or not, you can take some time to consider. In any case, there is still quite some time before the Blood Prison Trial starts! This Queen can wait!” Chi Yue looked at Yang Kai with a smile, as if she was absolutely assured he would comply.

“There’s no need to consider. I agree,” To Chi Yue’s surprise, however, Yang Kai accepted very readily.

“But I also have a condition!” Yang Kai grinned.

“What?”

“Teach me the method to tap into the power of the Divine Dragon Source first.”

“Do you take this Queen for some three-year-old child?” Chi Yue asked in exasperation, “You’ll only get your reward after you succeed! How could this Queen possibly pay you in advance?”

Yang Kai just faintly shook his head, “Senior’s thinking is flawed. According to what Senior said before, whether or not Junior can succeed depends on being able to use the Golden Divine Dragon Source’s suppression. Junior knows nothing about how to utilize the strength of the Golden Divine Dragon Source, so if something goes wrong at that time, how is he supposed to stop the Origin Essence Crystal from self-destructing? Presumably Senior doesn’t want to see such a result, right?”

Chi Yue’s pretty face sank as her brow furrowed.

She was well aware that Yang Kai was simply speaking irresponsibly, but in this situation, even these small worries had to be taken into consideration by her.

“To be on the safe side, Junior thinks Senior should teach that method to me first. Senior may rest assured that since this Junior has agreed to this matter, he will not go back on his word and exert his utmost effort to retrieve that Origin Essence Crystal!”

[This Queen would be a fool to believe you!] Chi Yue coldly snorted to herself.

After some hesitation, however, Chi Yue suddenly smiled, “It’s not impossible to give it to you first, this Queen can even instruct you personally in it and share with you her personal experiences!”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his brow, “It would be impolite for Junior to refuse Senior’s kindness.”

“However, this Queen will only teach you half of it, you will only obtain the other half after you succeed.”

“Deal!” Yang Kai nodded lightly, but after speaking, he seemed to think of something and added, “En, can Senior teach me the first half of this method then give the second half to Yu Xiong for safekeeping? That way, after going to Green Mountains Star, once Junior obtains that Origin Essence Crystal, he can exchange it for the second half immediately.”

Chi Yue frowned slightly as she stared at him suspiciously.

“Hehe, Junior is very impatient to obtain such a good Secret Art,” Yang Kai showed a harmless smile.

Chi Yue stared at him for a long time before gently nodding, “Fine! But this Queen must warn you, don’t get any crooked thoughts! Otherwise, don’t blame this Queen for not taking Qing Luo’s feelings into account.”

“Of course, of course! I always act in an upright manner,” Yang Kai patted his chest and affirmed.

Having finished the negotiations, Chi Yue immediately took Yang Kai to a cultivation room and taught him half of the Secret Art that would allow him to unlock the potential of the Golden Divine Dragon Source inside him.

In order to ensure that Yang Kai’s chances of successfully retrieving the Origin Essence Crystal were as high as possible, Chi Yue did not conceal anything and imparted all of her own experiences and insights into this Secret Art.

This Monster Transformation Secret Art was designed to tap into the strength hidden inside one’s bloodline and had remarkable effects when it came to Sources on the Divine Spirit level.

Since Yang Kai obtained the Golden Dragon Tattoo, he hadn’t been able to tap into this source of strength at all, but now, with Chi Yue’s help, he was finally able to draw out the incredible power of the Golden Divine Dragon.

Although his cultivation did not see any kind of increase, if he were to use the Golden Divine Dragon Source strength now, Yang Kai’s combat power would increase significantly!

Time flew by, and soon half a month had passed.

Yang Kai walked out of Chi Yue’s palace with excitement as well as a somewhat half-full expression on his face.

Now he truly realized the value of the Source he was bearing, but unfortunately, Chi Yue had only taught him half of the Secret Art rather than the complete article, causing him some small regrets.

“Just what kind of mischief is this little brat up to?” Inside her chambers, Chi Yue muttered to herself. Although Yang Kai asking her to give the second half of the Secret Art to Yu Xiong made her feel that something was wrong, after much contemplation, she was unable to understand what Yang Kai was plotting.

Was he not planning to return to Monster Emperor Star? That was the only way his proposal made any sense.

However, as long as his Little Senior Sister was still here, how could he not return? Judging from his appearance and actions, he didn’t seem like a man who wouldn’t care about his Senior Sister’s safety. If that was really the case, Qing Luo would definitely have long ago become disgusted, and parted ways, with him.

This was a result Chi Yue very much hoped to see actually.

After some more thought though, Chi Yue still couldn’t figure anything out and decided to just watch how the situation played out for now.

As long as Xia Ning Chang was still in the palm of her hand, she didn’t need to fear Yang Kai stirring up any trouble.

Meanwhile, inside Xia Ning Chang’s room, she and Shan Qing Luo were both waiting anxiously.

It had been half a month since Yang Kai and Xue Lian clashed and Yang Kai was taken away by Chi Yue, but until now, he had yet to return, a fact that made the two women extremely worried.

Shan Qing Luo had visited Chi Yue’s private chambers many times to ask for a meeting, but had never gotten a response.

“Ning Chang, don’t worry, Adoptive Mother won’t do anything to him,” Shan Qing Luo herself was as anxious as an ant on the hot wok, but still tried to comfort Ning Chang.

“Elder Sister Qing Luo, are you sure Red Moon Tribal Lord won’t do anything bad to Junior Brother?” Xia Ning Chang looked at her eagerly, as if pinning all her hopes on her.

Shan Qing Luo felt immense pressure being asked this so innocently. Although she didn’t dare to guarantee anything even to herself, she quickly nodded with a look of confidence.

At that moment, there was a slight sound of footsteps outside, and the two women released their Divine Senses at the same time, the next moment showing joyful looks on their faces as they hurriedly jumped to their feet.

Soon after, Yang Kai opened the door and stepped inside, completely unharmed and seemingly in very good spirits.

“Were you waiting for me?” Yang Kai glanced at the two women, walked over to the table, and poured himself a glass of water.

“Are you okay?” Shan Qing Luo asked nervously.

“Me? I’m very good,” Yang Kai chuckled, “Don’t worry, Senior Chi Yue didn’t do anything to me, she just wanted to make a deal.”

“A deal?” Shan Qing Luo frowned, “What kind of deal?”

“Hm, it’s difficult to explain all the specifics, but in short, I’ll be travelling to Green Mountains Star with you!”

“You’re also going to Green Mountains Star? Are you going to participate in the Blood Prison Trial?” Shan Qing Luo covered her small mouth.

“En!”

“But you’re only at the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm!” Shan Qing Luo’s beautiful eyes trembled, “Those who go there are all Third-Order.”

“There’s no problem with that,” Yang Kai chuckled, “No one stipulated that you must be a Third-Order to enter. In any case, I’ve already promised Senior Chi Yue so it’s too late for regrets now.”

“Maybe so, but...”

“Don’t worry,” Yang Kai shook his head. “However, there’s still something I’m confused about. By my count, the Blood Prison Trial should be starting in just a month or two. If we don’t set out now, how are we supposed to make it there in time?”

Shan Qing Luo smiled lightly, “We don’t need to spend any time traveling there. There’s an Ultra-Long Distance Space Array inside the palace which can send us directly to the Blood Prison, so we just need to wait for the Blood Prison to open.”

Yang Kai’s eyes immediately lit up, “There’s an Ultra-Long Distance Space Array here?”

“En,” Shan Qing Luo nodded, “Supposedly, it’s a relic from over ten thousand years ago. The Blood Prison Trial is a famous event that many of Monster Emperor Star’s Monster Race masters wanted to participate in, but it is inconvenient for us to go to Green Mountains Star, so a previous Red Moon Tribal Lord gathered a group of Array Masters and Artifact Refining Grandmasters to construct an Ultra-Long Distance Space Array thousands of years ago. Basically, every time the Blood Prison Trial is opened, Monster Emperor Star will secretly send a group of rising stars to participate.”

“So that’s how it is!” Yang Kai suddenly understood, “No wonder time is so tight yet Senior Chi Yue didn’t seem to be in any hurry. It turns out she had such a method in hand the whole time.”

“En, why else do you think Mi Tian and those other Young Lords came here? They all need to set out for the Blood Prison from here,” Shan Qing Luo explained with a smile.
