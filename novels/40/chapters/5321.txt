Chapter 5322, You Want To Do What With Me?

The Dragon Clan was divided into three Families, the Fu, Zhu, and Ji. The Dragon Clan’s Bloodline was being continued by these Three Families.

Which was why Fu Guang was surprised that he did not feel the Bloodline aura of any of these Three Families from this young one.

Moreover, if he was not mistaken, when he first perceived this youngster, he was using the Ancient Dragon Vein Tempering Art, which meant that he was not yet an Ancient Dragon.

Under up close observation, this youngster was already a nearly 70,000 metres long Ancient Dragon. It was simply unimaginable for a Dragon to have such a huge improvement in less than a year’s time.

Even for someone as gifted as himself, it was impossible to have such an achievement. Throughout history, no Dragon had ever grown so rapidly. It was completely beyond Dragon Clan’s ability to understand how this could be accomplished.

While asking the question, Fu Guang inadvertently looked at Yang Kai’s two front Dragon Claws.

When he noticed the Great Sun and Moon Marks, he realized that they must have something to do with this Junior’s rapid growth and the enormous consumption of Dragon Pool power.

“Senior, I am not a Dragon of the No-Return Pass.” Since he was sure that the Ancient Dragon before him was Fu Guang, Yang Kai had nothing to fear. At least, he would not be attacked for no reason.

“You’re not a Dragon of the No-Return Pass?” Fu Guang was slightly surprised as he continued to ask, “Did you return to your roots from the outside to pay respects to your ancestors?”

Yang Kai shook his head and explained, “No. I am Human. It was a coincidence that I had the opportunity to refine a Dragon Source and advance to become an Ancient Dragon. During that process, my Bloodline was purified.”

Fu Guang was even more surprised and exclaimed, “Human? Those few stubborn old goats actually agreed to let you into the Dragon Pool?”

He obviously knew the stubbornness of those Ancient Dragons. The Dragon Pool was fundamental to the existence of the Dragon Clan, so no one was worthy to enter it except for the pure-blood Dragons.

He wondered what they were thinking to let a Human enter the Dragon Pool.

However, Fu Guang soon nodded lightly and said, “Whether you were a Human or not before, now that your Bloodline is pure, you can be considered part of the Dragon Clan. Furthermore, you are already an Ancient Dragon.”

As he said, he continued to study Yang Kai. He noted that Yang Kai’s Golden Dragon Source was extremely powerful. If he was not mistaken, it should be the legendary Source that was lost all those eons ago.

[No wonder those stubborn old goats were willing to let him enter the Dragon Pool. They must have taken this into consideration.]

Unaware of the other party’s thoughts, Yang Kai was slightly stunned when he heard what Fu Guang said and said with a touch of dismay, “Yes, this Junior is part of the Dragon Clan now.”

Fu Guang laughed slightly and asked, “What’s the matter? Are you reluctant to give up being a Human?”

Fu Guang nodded and said, “Although someone like you is very rare, there have been a few recorded in my Dragon Clan’s history. I do not understand your feelings as there is no downside to being part of the Dragon Clan. At least when comparing to others in the equivalent realm, the Dragons are much stronger than Humans.”

“Senior’s vision is truly sharp. They are indeed from those two Seniors.”

Yang Kai was not surprised; since Huang Si Niang could recognize the origins of the two Marks at a glance, there was no reason why Fu Guang could not.

Fu Guang swam around Yang Kai with some curiosity and asked, “Those two Marks can draw in and absorb the Dragon Pool power? I’ve never heard of anything like them before. However, since they are Marks granted by those two, it’s not surprising that they have this ability. What I wonder is how you managed to withstand such a huge amount of power inside your body? By right, you should have exploded long ago.”

He had been observing Yang Kai for a while and was truly puzzled by this situation.

Yang Kai explained, “When those two Senior’s granted me their Marks, they also gifted me a portion of their pure Yin and Yang Powers. When this Junior sucked in the Dragon Pool power, the Yin and Yang Power turned into something like a millstone and ground it down, allowing me to rapidly absorb and refine the Dragon Pool power.”

Fu Guang was amazed and exclaimed, “There is such a thing?”

He had never known of such a possibility. Even the entire Dragon Clan knew nothing about this; otherwise, the ancient books would have records of these capabilities.

This brat in front of him not only had the marks of the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer, but he had also received a part of their powers. That meant that they considered him in high regard.

The Burning Light and Serene Glimmer would never grant their powers to others lightly. At least, Fu Guang had never heard of anyone having such an opportunity before.

“Come, come, activate those two Marks again,” Fu Guang asked eagerly.

Yang Kai shook his head rapidly and said, “Senior, unfortunately, this Junior has exhausted the Yin and Yang Powers of those two. If I draw in any more Dragon Pool power, I won’t be able to handle it.”

“What are you afraid of? Just do as I say. I’m here and will take care of you.” Fu Guang spoke with utmost confidence, as if he wanted to reassure Yang Kai and let him act boldly.

Yang Kai was at a loss for what to do and about what Fu Guang’s intentions were. However, considering that Fu Guang was close to becoming a Divine Dragon, he was surely not a match if things got out of hand.

Besides, it should not matter if he just demonstrated the two Marks’ ability a little for Fu Guang to see.

With that in mind, Yang Kai nodded his head and said, “In that case, Junior will show you how they work.”

He then activated the Great Sun and Moon Marks on his two Dragon Claws. The moment the marks shone, they started to suck in the rich Dragon Pool power from the surrounding area.

Yang Kai was prepared to stop at a moment’s notice as he did not have the Yin-Yang Millstone inside him anymore. He really could not withstand too much Dragon Pool power entering his body.

However, just as he activated the two Marks, Fu Guang made his move. His nearly 100,000 metres Dragon Form vibrated immediately and his Dragon Scales stood on end.

As he did so, Fu Guang’s Dragon Body suddenly turned into what seemed like a bottomless abyss, madly devouring the incoming Dragon Pool’s power.

Feeling his Dragon Vein roar and his bones crack loudly, Fu Guang’s eyes lit up.

Yang Kai was not experiencing too much pressure, because almost 80% of the Dragon Pool power drawn in by the Great Sun and Moon Marks was being intercepted by Fu Guang, leaving a mere 20% to enter Yang Kai’s body.

Although it was still a bit uncomfortable for Yang Kai, it was within his ability to tolerate. At least he would not be at risk of dying anymore.

Si Niang said that Fu Guang had been in retreat in the depths of the Dragon Pool for 5,000 years. If he had not broken through yet, it meant that advancing from an Ancient Dragon to a Divine Dragon was no easy task.

If Yang Kai could help him achieve a breakthrough, it would be an enormous favour, not only to Fu Guang himself, but to the entire Dragon Clan.

The Dragon Clan had only one Divine Dragon right now, so their overall strength would soar with an additional one.

As Yang Kai was thinking about this, Fu Guang signaled to Yang Kai to stop.

Yang Kai obediently did as he was told.

Fu Guang pondered silently while glancing at Yang Kai every now and then, as if he was thinking about how to make a request. He also appeared very hesitant.

Yang Kai was amused and wondered just what he was going to say.

[What is there to hesitate about? The advancement to become a Divine Dragon should be far more important compared to owing a favour or some notion of pride.]

Nonetheless, even with such thoughts, he did not say anything and just waited in silence.

After a long time, Fu Guang said awkwardly, “Kid, do you want to dual cultivate with me?”

Yang Kai was shocked and stuttered, “D-Dual… dual cultivate… with you?”

[What the Hell are you talking about!? Why did you suddenly bring this up? Are you actually a female Dragon? But, it doesn’t look like it, and your voice is obviously too low to be that of a female….] Yang Kai doubtfully thought.

Fu Guang nodded seriously and said, “Yes, cultivate with me! See, you can draw in an enormous amount of Dragon Pool power by using those two Marks. However, you can’t digest it all, so I can digest most of it for you while you absorb the rest yourself.”

Yang Kai choked and remarked, “O-Oh… ahem, so… this is what you meant by ‘dual cultivate’ with you?”

He thought that Fu Guang was… referring to something else.

Fu Guang said with a straight face, “Of course! What else could I have meant?”

Yang Kai was speechless, and even suspected that Fu Guang did not understand what the connotation was. In Fu Guang’s mind, dual cultivation simply meant cultivating together.

Noticing that Yang Kai did not agree immediately, Fu Guang said, “Of course, this is more beneficial to me, but I will not let you suffer a loss. Let’s do this. You are now a pure-blood Dragon and can only enhance your Bloodline on your own without anyone’s guidance. However, my Dragon Clan’s Bloodline Talent is the Dao of Time. If you agree to my request, I can give you a few pointers while you cultivate.”

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up when he heard what Fu Guang said and exclaimed, “Really?”

Fu Guang nodded, “Of course.”

“Many thanks, Senior!”

Even if Fu Guang did not offer to give him pointers on improving his mastery over the Dao of Time, Yang Kai was already planning on helping him. If Yang Kai really helped him become a Divine Dragon, then the Dragon Clan would owe him a huge favour. Now, with the added benefits on top, Yang Kai would certainly not refuse.

“Do you agree?” Fu Guang asked to confirm.

“This Junior can’t think of a reason to refuse.”

“Very good.” Fu Guang slithered his Dragon Form and continued, “This matter cannot be delayed. Come with me.”

It had been over a year since the Dragon Pool opened, so Yang Kai would leave in at most a few years’ time. Thus, Fu Guang did not want to waste even a single moment.

Yang Kai followed Fu Guang closely, diving deeper into the pool.

He did not know how deep they went, but Yang Kai felt that he had reached his limit. If he went any deeper, the dense Dragon Pool power around him would kill him even if he did not activate the Great Sun and Moon Marks.

Yang Kai was not surprised that Fu Guang looked so relaxed; after all, there was a difference of over 30,000 metres between their sizes. Fu Guang was on the cusp of becoming a Divine Dragon, so it was only natural that he would be able to resist the pressure better than himself in the Dragon Pool.

Fu Guang also sensed this and without waiting for Yang Kai to say anything, he took the initiative to stop and said, “This will do.”

Yang Kai promptly replied, “As you wish, Senior.”

Fu Guang was very considerate and explained, “You should slowly activate the Great Sun and Moon Marks and progressively draw in the Dragon Pool power. You don’t have to do it all at once, just slowly adjust it.”

Yang Kai nodded and replied, “I’ll try.”

He had never tried to control the Great Sun and Moon Marks, because previously, he had the Yin-Yang Millstone in his body to help him grind however much power he could draw in.

Now that he was going to help Fu Guang cultivate though, it was necessary to use a more refined method. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Coil up your body,” Fu Guang said.

When Yang Kai heard this, he quickly coiled himself into a ball.

Fu Guang placed Yang Kai in the middle and wrapped him with his body for protection.

On seeing this, Yang Kai felt a lot more assured. In this way, the Dragon Pool power sucked in by the Great Sun and Moon Marks would be devoured by Fu Guang first, and only what he could not take in would flow to him.

Thus, Yang Kai’s safety was guaranteed.
