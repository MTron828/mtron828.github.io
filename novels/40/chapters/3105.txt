The pressure was as heavy as a mountain on He Yun Xiang. However, since Yang Kai had remained silent, she had no choice but to continue chasing after them, all the time feeling as though she was a moth that was flying towards a fire.

After they kept flying at full speed for half a day, they finally saw those people stopping in front of a solitary mountain.

The mountain was about a thousand meters high, and there was a bamboo hut at the peak. The place was practically covered in bamboo forests as the plants swayed with the wind, which looked like a sight that came right out of a beautiful painting.

The arrival of these hundreds of cultivators had added a layer of murderous intent to this place. Apparently, they were all from the same Sect as their movements were orderly and organized. Upon arriving at this place, they immediately dispersed and surrounded the mountain.

Upon a closer inspection, He Yun Xiang was shocked to discover that these people were actually arranging a huge Formation. She wondered who the Master was that could make these people go all out and form into such a huge Formation to oppose him. In her heart, she lamented that there was always someone stronger out there. Then, she took a look at Yang Kai, who was still casually lying on the Star Shuttle, as though he was unperturbed by the tension below them.

At that instant, she realised she had forgotten that the person she was following was also an inscrutable Master and probably had no regard for the people below them.

After pulling herself together, she keenly looked down at the good show.

“It’s just a normal vendetta against someone. There’s nothing to see here,” Yang Kai pinched Liu Yan’s ear.

Liu Yan just let him be as she looked excitedly at the events down there and uttered gently, “There’s a Secret Technique in the Phoenix Clan that can be used to predict the future. Just now, I suddenly had a feeling that your wish would come true today.”

Hearing that, Yang Kai sat up straight and gazed at her in shock, “Really?”

Liu Yan replied, “It wouldn’t cost us anything to just watch.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly and released his Divine Sense to investigate the solitary mountain, but it was blocked in front of the bamboo hut and couldn’t go any further. In an instant, his expression turned awkward.

Just then, a grey-haired old man leapt into the air. Although his figure was thin, he appeared very energetic. There were some age spots on his wrinkled face, which made him look like he didn’t have much time left in this world; however, his eyes beamed with a horrifying glare.

He stared fixedly at the bamboo hut and bellowed, “How dare you break into Wild Dragon Pavilion and steal our Sect’s Supreme Artifact!? This place will be your burial ground today!”

“Wild Dragon Pavilion…” He Yun Xiang was stunned.

It had been half a year since she arrived in the Ancestral Domain, so although she had always been on the road to carry out Yang Kai’s orders, she wasn’t as clueless as before and had even gained a lot of information during her journey. Certainly, she had heard about Wild Dragon Pavilion before, which was one of the most powerful Sects in the Ancestral Domain.

It was no wonder that there was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master among them. They were all from Wild Dragon Pavilion, which was why there were so many formidable Masters.

It wasn’t that there were no other great forces that could go up against Wild Dragon Pavilion, but there were definitely not many. Who was it that was gutsy enough to steal the Supreme Artifact from Wild Dragon Palace? What amazed He Yun Xiang was that the person in question had actually succeeded and fled from the place.

It would take immense power and boldness for someone to achieve that.

At that instant, she felt curious about the person who was hiding in the bamboo hut.

“Stop hiding in your shabby hut and come face us now!” Gong Yang Xi was extremely furious. His Sect’s Supreme Artifact had been stolen, but there were no signs prior to that of anything amiss. If it weren’t because the thief didn’t intend to erase his traces, they wouldn’t have even been able to pursue him to this place.

The thief apparently had no regard for him or Wild Dragon Pavilion. He would like to find out who had the guts to steal something from the tiger’s den in the Ancestral Domain.

“Come out!” The people from Wild Dragon Pavilion were agitated as they chanted along with their leader.

Just then, a dispassionate voice could be heard from the bamboo hut, “I was just taking back my own thing, so how could you call me a thief? Trash like all of you should mind your language. I’m in a good mood today, so I don’t want to kill anyone. Go back to where you’re from now.”

Gong Yang Xi was so angered that he actually started laughing, “What a shameless man!”

[Who is this arrogant man? Who does he think he is? Wild Dragon Pavilion has stood in the Ancestral Domain for over ten thousand years! Our inheritance is rich, and our disciples are both powerful and plentiful.]

Gong Yang Xi was in the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, which was the highest cultivation achievable in the Ancestral Domain, so he had never been afraid of anyone.

Moreover, what this man said was ridiculous. The Supreme Artifact was a relic left behind by their Ancestral Founder more than thirty generations ago, which meant that it was at least ten thousand years old, so how was it possible that it belonged to some outsider?

“Sir?” He Yun Xiang was shocked that the person was so haughty, as though he had no regard for anyone in the world, but just then, Yang Kai stood up on the Star Shuttle. He had always been calm and carefree, but at this moment, his expression had turned solemn for the first time as he stared fixedly at the bamboo hut, as though a formidable enemy was right before him.

[What’s going on?] He Yun Xiang’s heart was filled with doubts.

She still did not understand the full extent of Yang Kai’s strength, because since she started following him, she had never seen him use his true power. Be it Origin King Realm Masters or Dao Source Realm Masters though, he could kill all of them with just one punch. Certainly, he wouldn’t need to use all his power when faced with enemies that he could kill with one move.

He Yun Xiang had speculated that Yang Kai was probably at the peak of the Third-Order Dao Source Realm. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to kill those First-Order Dao Source Realm Masters as though they were mere ants.

Given his cultivation, he could be considered one of the top cultivators in the entire Ancestral Domain. Wherever he went or whoever he faced, he would still be confident enough.

So, why would this kind of Master appear so solemn all of a sudden? Who was that person inside the bamboo hut?

“Master?” Feeling that something was off, Liu Yan looked up at him and asked.

After a gulp, Yang Kai stroked her head and said in a bitter voice, “It seems that you’re right. My wish will come true today.”

Liu Yan’s gut feeling had indeed lit up a light that could show him the way forward, but the light was so dazzling that he was worried he would be blinded by it.

“Little Friend, you’re here as well! What a coincidence!” The voice sounded from the bamboo hut again.

Hearing that, Yang Kai stiffened. Up until a moment ago, he was 30 percent doubtful and 70 percent shocked, but upon hearing what this man just said, he was now 100 percent confident of his speculation. The man in the bamboo hut was exactly the one he thought it to be.

[I can’t believe he’s here!]

It was pointless to try to hide their figures in front of such a Master, so the moment Yang Kai’s trio arrived at this place, that person must have discovered them.

As such, Yang Kai let out a loud growl, “You thief! I don’t care how powerful you are, but you’re in the wrong to have stolen their Sect’s Supreme Artifact! Such heinous acts are contrary to how a true Master should behave! It wouldn’t matter if I hadn’t come across this incident, but since I’ve seen it now, I won’t just stand by!”

Then, he turned to look at the old man from Wild Dragon Pavilion and cupped his fists, “Old man, although this has nothing to do with me, it seems fate has brought us together today. If you require any help, please don’t hesitate to ask. I have always pledged to help those in need.”

He appeared righteous, and his voice sounded determined.

[O-Old man?] Gong Yang Xi was astounded. Since he took over Wild Dragon Pavilion, anyone who had come across him would always call him ‘Pavilion Master’ in a respectful manner. Now that he was called an ‘old man’, his expression turned weird, but it wasn’t the right time to flare up. So, his expression only slightly darkened.

The person in the bamboo hut fell silent for a moment before he uttered again, “Little Friend, are you pretending that you don’t know me?”

“I don’t know who you are!”

[I don’t know who you are either.] Gong Yang Xi felt helpless toward this young man. Although he had realised that the latter had been following him, he ignored him because he was busy. However, he didn’t expect that the young man would butt in on his affairs.

[He said he wanted to help me?] Gong Yang Xi wasn’t a fool, so he wouldn’t believe the young man’s nonsense. It seemed that the young man and the person in the bamboo hut were old acquaintances. It was just that they were on bad terms.

Still, he didn’t want the situation to become more chaotic, so he saluted the young man and said, “Young Friend, many thanks for your offer. However, this is an internal matter for Wild Dragon Pavilion, so we don’t want any outsiders to interfere in it. Please step aside now, as I’m worried that you might be accidentally harmed during the fight.”

In truth, he didn’t want Yang Kai to get involved in this matter because he was worried that the young man was the accomplice of that person in the bamboo hut.

“Alright.” Yang Kai bowed his head, “Old man, since you’ve said so, I’ll stand aside for now.” He intended to find out the strength of the man in the bamboo hut by using these people from Wild Dragon Pavilion in the first place.

He had been suppressed and repelled by the Heavenly Way since he came to the Lower Star Field, so Yang Kai knew that it was the same case for that person as well. When they fought later, Yang Kai could probably find out about it. However, he was worried that Gong Yang Xi would underestimate the person, so he said solemnly, “Old man, it’s not that I’m trying to frighten you, but the person in the hut is a difficult character to deal with. You have to be careful. Otherwise, you will suffer.”

Gong Yang Xi frowned and replied impassively, “Many thanks for your warning.”

However, his expression suggested that he didn’t take the young man seriously. He was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master, so he was already one of the top cultivators in the Ancestral Domain. Even if there was someone stronger than he was, that person wouldn’t be overwhelmingly more powerful. Now that all the top cultivators from Wild Dragon Pavilion had gathered here, there was basically no one in the world that could be a match for them. No matter how formidable the person in the hut was, he was determined to kill him.

Then, with a dark expression, he turned back and uttered, “It seems that you’re unwilling to return our artifact to us in a peaceful manner. I’ll ask you one last time. Will you give back what you stole or not?”

“I told you this thing belongs to me, so stop harping on it. You’re annoying.”

“Good! Since that’s the case, don’t blame this Gong for being ruthless! Die!” Gong Yang Xi pushed his Source Qi as his beard and hair flapped in the wind. Then, he leapt into the air and charged towards the bamboo hut like an enraged ram. His aura was strong, and his fury seemed able to burn through the air.

However, there was no reaction from the person in the bamboo hut.

Gong Yang Xi’s threat from earlier wasn’t effective at all. When he reached the bamboo hut, he attempted to land a palm on the door, “It’s disgraceful that you don’t even have the guts to show your face. Come out now!”

*Ziya…* The bamboo hut’s door suddenly flung open as a gale gusted out of the house. Gong Yang Xi’s pupils contracted as his expression was transformed by horror. Under the attention of hundreds of stunned cultivators, Gong Yang Xi was sucked into the bamboo hut.

*Hong…* The door was closed again, but no noises were coming from the house anymore, nor any signs of a struggle. It was so quiet that it was as though they were in the earliest stage of the universe.

With their eyes widened, everyone held their breaths and became all ears. However, the atmosphere was eerily quiet, which caused their hearts to be filled with horror.

At that instant, the bamboo hut looked like an ancient beast that had swallowed Gong Yang Xi whole.
