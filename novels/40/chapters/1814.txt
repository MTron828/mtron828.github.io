Using his full strength, Zi Long instantly got rid of the encirclement of the Ten Thousand Soul Banner and vibrant purple light burst from his body as he shot out like a dazzling comet towards Yang Kai.

“Yang Boy, run!” Gui Zu was shocked, then he pursued Zi Long while putting away the Ten Thousand Soul Banner.

But Yang Kai stood his ground, as if he did not notice the approaching danger, but his expression became extremely solemn.

Seeing Zi Long rapidly approach, Yang Kai released a guttural roar as he pushed his strength.

The Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art circulated, causing a burst of five coloured brilliance to burst from his figure.

Next, Yang Kai activated his Dragon Transformation Secret Technique, covering his right arm in golden Dragon Scales and transforming it into a dragon claw.

Drawing the maximum force he could from his dantian, Yang Kai condensed all his strength on his fist and punched forward.

The five-coloured brilliance collided with the purple meteor, causing an explosion that shook the surrounding thousand-kilometre area.

In the next moment, visible shockwaves spread out to the surroundings, centred on the point of contact between these two.

Yang Kai snorted as he was sent flying uncontrollably, coughing up Golden Blood from his mouth as he tumbled.

Although Zi Long stood his ground, his face turned pale as a look of extreme shock filled his face and traces of red liquid began to leak out from the corner of his mouth.

In this frontal collision, he had also been slightly injured!

[This little brat...] Zi Long felt a great storm sweep through his heart as a look of total surprise appeared on his face.

He was a veteran Second-Order Origin King and the Sect Master of Purple Star. He cultivated one of the Star Field’s more powerful and profound Secret Arts. There were not many who were his equal and ordinary First-Order Origin Kings were like ants before him.

But Yang Kai, a junior who had just broken through to the Origin King Realm, was able to fight him head-on.

Even masters like Xu Wei and Kong Fa would have had their bones shattered and organs reduced to paste from that blow.

Just what were the origins of this boy? Who taught him? Why did he have such terrifying potential?

Yang Kai had only just broken through to the Origin King Realm but was already capable of fighting him. If he broke through to the Third-Order Origin King Realm one day, who in the Star Field could be his opponent?

The more he thought about it, the more cold sweat leaked from Zi Long’s forehead, and his determination to kill Yang Kai only became stronger.

An eerie howl rang out from behind Zi Long and he knew that Gui Zu had caught up. Whipping around, Zi Long spat out a profound stream of purple light!

Extreme Purple Profound Qi Surge! One of the Divine Abilities that belonged to the Purple Qi Eternal River Secret Art, each Extreme Purple Profound Qi Surge strand needed to be condensed over the course of two hundred years and Zi Long only had three such strands.

But in order to quickly overpower Gui Zu’s attack, he had to use it.

The stream of purple light before him caused Gui Zu’s face to change drastically as he felt the extremely terrifying power behind it. Not daring to be negligent, Gui Zu summoned his Ten Thousand Soul Banner, unfurled it into a defensive curtain, and shielded his body with it.

However, the Extreme Purple Profound Qi Surge shot forward like an all-conquering spear, piercing directly into the Ten Thousand Soul Banner.

In an instant, countless Yin Souls were exterminated, causing Gui Zu’s heart to clench in distress!

But at this time, he had no time to think about this and simply pushed his Ten Thousand Soul Banner madly to resolve the Extreme Purple Profound Qi Surge as he rushed towards Yang Kai for fear that Yang Kai would be killed by Zi Long.

Arriving beside Yang Kai, Gui Zu’s figure reappeared, and he asked worriedly, “Are you dead?”

Yang Kai clutched his chest, glanced at him while coughing, and smiled wryly, “What do you think?”

“As long as you’re not dead, it’s all fine. Haa... you really frightened this old master,” Gui Zu couldn’t help feeling a big stone lift from his heart as he blinked and carefully examined Yang Kai’s condition, shock gradually spreading across his face. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He discovered that Yang Kai’s injuries were not actually that serious and that his vitality and aura were still strong and stable. Even his complexion was only a bit red, not deathly pale like he expected it to be.

Gui Zu could not help gulping as he felt as jarred as Zi Long.

[This boy is a true monster! How did he do it? What was that five coloured glow he released just now? And that dragon claw, what kind of Secret Technique was that?]

The dragon claw left an especially strong impression on Gui Zu as he felt a faint sense of pressure and intimidation from it!

[Dragon Pressure!] Gui Zu was taken aback as this thought emerged in his mind.

Quickly composing himself, Gui Zu focused on the situation at hand and said, “Kid, do we carry on or take the win and leave? This old master will follow your lead.”

“Naturally, we need to pull out the weed by their roots!” Yang Kai wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and glared forward coldly.

“Sure!” Gui Zu squinted his eyes and nodded heavily, “In that case, this old master will accompany you in this madness! Since this old master came out from that place, he has not really fought against another Origin King. I didn’t expect my first battle would actually be against such an important figure, jie jie...”

As he spoke, Gui Zu’s body began to emit a thick fighting intent.

On the other side, Zi Long, who had been repelled by Yang Kai’s blow just now and forced Gui Zu away, did not show any intention to act again immediately. Instead, he summoned an artifact that looked like a round bowl and pressed it towards the dead Zi Dong.

An extremely soft light radiated from the round bowl and covered Zi Dong’s corpse. Watching this light, Zi Long’s expression turned dignified as he forced a series of seals before pressing his hand towards the bowl.

Something seemed to be pulled out from Zi Dong’s corpse in the next instant and was gathered into the round bowl.

Soon, an illusory figure appeared in the centre of the round bowl, one that seemed similar to the now-dead Zi Dong.

At first, this figure was ethereal and illusory, as if it would blow away in the alight breeze, but with Zi Long’s continued efforts, this figure became more and more corporeal, as if it was Zi Dong’s Soul Avatar.

The blurry eyes of this figure gradually became clearer.

Finally, after Zi Long spat out a mouthful of Blood Essence, Zi Dong’s figure came to life and turned around, his expression going blank as he quickly understood what had happened.

“Father, please avenge your son by killing that bastard!” Zi Dong’s figure stood in the round bowl as he cried out pitifully; however, since he was just a Soul now, no tears fell.

“You waste!” Zi Long’s complexion was pale as he severely reprimanded, but his complexion soon softened as he nodded, “Rest assured, Father will seek revenge for you, so just stay in the Soul Sustaining Bowl. Once we return to Purple Star, I will find a way to recreate your body!”

“Yes,” Zi Dong was overjoyed and quickly disappeared into the bowl.

Zi Long carefully put away the Soul Sustaining Bowl before he turned around and glared coldly in Yang Kai’s direction.

No matter what, this boy had to die, even if it cost him serious injuries! Such a terrifying young man could not be allowed to mature any further.

“Radiant Purple Star River!” Zi Long suddenly shouted as the purple light all over his body quickly receded and concentrated into a shocking purple sword in his hand.

Gripping this purple sword, Zi Long’s aura soared upwards, causing the surrounding space to tremble. Staring at Yang Kai coldly, he then shouted, “Boy, no one can save you today!”

“Will you die if you scream empty threats all the time? My life is right here, if you have the ability, come and take it!” Yang Kai showed no fear as he stepped forward.

Zi Long did not say another word. Brandishing his sword, his entire figure became wrapped in sword light as he crossed the several-kilometre gap between them in an instant and directly attacked Yang Kai.

“Exile!” Yang Kai stretched out his hand and palmed forward, causing the space in front of him to collapse and form a black hole-like existence.

Zi Long speed was so great he nearly crashed into the black hole, but at the last possible moment, he managed to halt his advance and dodge.

“Moon Blade!” Yang Kai’s voice sounded again as crescent blades swept towards Zi Long without pause.

Zi Long was forced to awkwardly dodge this barrage as he did not dare allow these attacks condensed from pure Space Force to hit him.

Who knows what would happen if he was to touch them?

Yang Kai laughed loudly, “Old Dog, you can’t even get close to me, so how are you going to take my life? You should try again in your next life!”

Gui Zu watched from the sidelines with cold sweat and while secretly sighing that talents from the new generation would replace those from the old...

He was an Origin King, and there were few people he truly feared in this Star Field, but Gui Zu had never seen anyone with such unexpected methods as Yang Kai. Even putting himself in Zi Long’s place, Gui Zu did not think his situation would be any better, unable to close the gap between him and Yang Kai.

“Rising Purple Qi!” Zi Long suddenly shouted as his terrifying Qi once again increased in intensity. The next moment, he no longer evaded and simply slashed out with his purple sword towards the countless Moon Blades.

This sword could only be described as world-shaking, and it contained not only Zi Long’s endless anger but also his full comprehension of the Martial Dao, causing even Gui Zu’s eyes to bulge.

Without even thinking about it, he directly threw his Ten Thousand Soul Banner out to shield himself and Yang Kai.

*Hong long long...*

The Moon Blades were cut apart, and even the Ten Thousand Soul Banner was unable to resist the might of this sword light.

The attack fell directly on top of Yang Kai’s head, as if it would split him in two in the next moment.

Yang Kai grabbed Gui Zu and with a single step released his Space Force and vanished from the spot, appearing behind Zi Long in the next instant.

*Zheng...*

The Dragon Bone Sword appeared at that moment, and as Yang Kai poured his Saint Qi into it, it transformed into a giant dragon that bit towards Zi Long.

Gui Zu also took action, clenching his fist and punching out, releasing a giant ghost head filled with Yin Qi that followed right after the Dragon Bone Sword’s tail as it charged towards Zi Long’s back.

Zi Long’s reaction was extremely fast. The moment he saw Yang Kai and Gui Zu disappear, he realized what would happen next.

Adjusting his stance, he swung his sword towards his back without any hesitation.

This sword struck the giant dark green dragon and ghost head.

A dragon roar rang out as Zi Long’s full-powered strike sent the giant dark green dragon flying. The ghost head also distorted as it quickly split in two.

Although the combined blow of Yang Kai and Gui Zu was resolved, Zi Long’s imposing momentum had noticeably dampened and his face had turned pale. Obviously, it wasn’t easy for him to resolve this attack.
