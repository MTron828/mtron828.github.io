Considering all this, large beads of sweat the size of beans began dripping down Ruan Hong Bo’s forehead. He knew that life in Sky Peak Temple would be difficult for him in the future. Originally, Sky Peak Temple and Sky Illumination Palace were similar in strength, but an Emperor had appeared in the latter. If Sky Peak Temple wanted to survive now, they would have to show their sincerity.

Qiu Ze had become a veritable overlord! No wonder he came over so rampantly and smugly.

Inside the Sect Defending Array, Ye Hen and the others had all paled in despair. The Sect was already in turmoil and split into two because of that opportunist Shi Cang Ying, and now, Qiu Ze had actually reached the Emperor Realm and was standing right outside their Sect Defending Array. How could they withstand all of this?

Shi Cang Ying was also horrified. He no longer dared to be reckless with Qiu Ze and congratulated fearfully, “So, Palace Lord Qiu has already advanced to the Emperor Realm. This Shi congratulates Palace Lord Qiu!”

Ruan Hong Bo and Mu Zheng also said in unison, “Congratulations to Palace Lord Qiu for ascending to the Emperor Realm!”

Qiu Ze laughed loudly, the sound of his laughter deafening, sending chills down everyone’s spine.

.....

Inside the mountain cave, Yang Kai was staring at the strange oval stone, not daring to miss even the slightest of changes.

After smashing tens of millions of Mid-Rank and High-Rank Source Crystals and turning them into a mist of World Energy, an even more powerful devouring power emerged from within the strange stone, constantly swallowing up this energy. And, as time went by, the crimson light on the surface of the stone became even more exuberant while Liu Yan’s aura also became clearer and clearer.

A few days passed and Yang Kai gradually realized that things were different from what he expected.

Liu Yan was not in danger. Even though she had been swallowed up by the strange stone, Yang Kai could sense that Liu Yan was sleeping within it. She was in an extremely peaceful state, and traces of cheerfulness were even mixed into her unconsciously releasing aura. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

It seemed like this encounter was not a bad thing for her, but rather, a good thing.

[Could it be that Ye Chong’s words were true? That there really is an opportunity here, but that this opportunity is for Liu Yan?]

Remembering that Ye Chong had been staring at Liu Yan when he mentioned the opportunity, Yang Kai believed it might really be the case.

Though, whatever the opportunity was, was still a mystery to Yang Kai. So, all he could do now was to watch over Liu Yan and see what happened.

A day later, the sea of World Energy in the cave had become extremely thin. Even though the World Energy in this Sealed World was also very dense, the strange stone didn’t seem full yet.

Yang Kai crushed another million Source Crystals and allowed the strange stone to swallow it up with the same method.

At this moment, the entire stone had already become crimson red, as if it had just been fished out of a pool of lava. The cave had also become extremely hot, so much so that even the surrounding walls were melting.

Meanwhile, Liu Yan’s aura was becoming clearer, but what surprised Yang Kai was the fact that Liu Yan’s aura seemed to be much stronger than before, and there was also another type of feeling to it... an indescribable feeling.

Looking at it, a thought suddenly came to Yang Kai’s mind and he exclaimed, “Isn’t this an egg!?”

He was preoccupied before and didn’t care much, but now that he looked at it carefully, he discovered that the oval shape of the strange stone was just like that of an egg.

Considering all of this, Yang Kai then remembered that Xiao Xiao and his own Embodiment had emerged from a black stone previously. It was the special way Stone Puppets were naturally born. Could it be that Liu Yan would also emerge from this strange stone?

This strange stone was different from the two he got back then, so this was not produced by the Stone Puppet race. Yang Kai also couldn’t say what sort of thing this stone was, but after this guess came to mind, Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel excited.

If his guess was correct, then Liu Yan would eventually emerge from the shell, and who knows what would become of her when that time came.

This really was a priceless opportunity for Liu Yan.

Another two days went by.

The speed at which the strange stone absorbed World Energy had clearly decreased and was growing slower as time went on. Yang Kai knew that the stone must have become saturated. What had happened to Liu Yan would be revealed at any moment, so he just stared at the stone without moving a muscle, heart pounding heavily.

Half a day later, just as Yang Kai was growing apprehensive, a crisp sound suddenly came from the strange stone.

Yang Kai was startled and quickly looked towards the stone. There, he found that a small crack had actually formed on the surface.

*Kacha...*

When the crack appeared, it seemed to have caused a chain reaction. More cracking noises rang out as a dense spider web of cracks appeared on the egg’s surface.

Yang Kai’s expression focused. He watched the stone even more closely, ready to lend Liu Yan a helping hand at any time.

*Huala...*

After that noise, the strange stone suddenly split into several pieces, then into countless tiny pieces, and fell to the ground.

Yang Kai was shocked. He thought that something had happened to Liu Yan, but only when he saw the crimson glow in place where the strange stone was, did his heart finally relax.

That light was clearly transmitting Liu Yan’s aura, indicating that she was fine.

The light was strong and drenched the entire cave in red. Squinting his eyes to observe it, Yang Kai couldn’t find any clues. Probing with his Divine Sense also came up as a blur. It was as if the light had inherited the strange stone’s ability to swallow up Divine Sense so that he could not investigate clearly.

It was only after an incense stick of time that the red glow waned and the cave returned to darkness.

Only then did Yang Kai get a clear view of the scene before him.

In the next moment, his eyes suddenly turned round and his jaw went slack. He looked as shocked as if he had just seen a ghost in daylight.

Because the figure of a girl appeared where that strange stone once sat!

This little girl looked about seven or eight and was lying on her side, her small body curled up with her two hands pillowing her head, sleeping peacefully.

Yang Kai could clearly hear her breathing.

That in itself was surprising enough, but what was even more unbelievable to Yang Kai was the fact that he could actually feel Liu Yan’s aura coming from the little girl’s body.

[Is this Liu Yan?]

Yang Kai’s eyes almost popped out.

Ever since Liu Yan was able to assume human form, she had always appeared before Yang Kai as a beautiful woman with revealing clothes, a pair of plump peaks and a well-defined bottom that could stimulate one’s imaginations. But after this sudden change, she ended up like this.

Yang Kai simply could not accept this.

But it wouldn’t make sense if this was not Liu Yan either, because Liu Yan’s aura was in fact radiating from the little girl. Not only that, but she also perfectly inherited Liu Yan’s fiery red hair. The smooth red hair was draped over her body, covering up the small figure conservatively.

Only then did Yang Kai notice that there were no clothes on the little girl’s body. The red hair had been covering her up, so he obviously didn’t notice it before.

While Yang Kai was bewildered, the long lashes of the girl in front of him quivered a little, then she slowly opened her eyes. She still seemed a little confused at the situation at hand. Glancing around, she soon found a dumbfounded face in front of her, and only then did she sit up.

Once she sat up, her long hair slipped down, revealing her fair white body; however, she was clearly still quite confused and her face looked dazed.

Yang Kai quickly turned away and rummaged around his Space Ring, taking out a piece of clothing before tossing it directly to her.

In a flash, the wide fabric covered her up.

“Master, what are you doing?” The little girl mumbled in dissatisfaction as she reached up to pull the clothes off her head.

But as soon as the words came out, she froze.

Her beautiful eyes trembled fiercely for a while, then she brought her two hands in front of her and stared at them in a daze...

A few moments later, a tragic scream rang out from inside the cave.

.....

An hour later, Yang Kai and the little girl gradually calmed themselves down. The two sat face to face, one with a strange expression, and the other teary-eyed, mouth pursed into a line.

The little girl was indeed Liu Yan, but she had no idea why she had turned into this form.

Liu Yan had already put on the clothes Yang Kai’s gave her, but they were far too big for her current size. The loose clothes matched with that pitiful expression on her face was enough to melt anyone’s heart, making one want to gently comfort and coax her not to cry.

Appearance-wise, she did have some trace of Liu Yan in her, but it was the child version of Liu Yan. She had a pink and delicate face like jade, just like an exquisite porcelain doll. She had fair and rosy skin still with some baby fat on her cheeks, making it hard to resist reaching out to give them a pinch to test the texture.

“Seen enough yet?” Liu Yan glared at Yang Kai with an unhappy expression.

Yang Kai shrugged and spoke calmly, “You do know you’re completely not intimidating in your current appearance, right?”

Liu Yan gnashed her teeth.

After turning out like this, even her voice had become child-like. It was crisp and pleasant, no longer the cold but sultry voice she had before.

“Alright, alright,” Yang Kai consoled her, saying solemnly. “Let me ask you, do you feel anything wrong after transforming?”

“Not really. It’s just a little hard to get used to,” Liu Yan responded softly.

“Can’t you transform back to how you were before?” Yang Kai asked.

Liu Yan responded, “Perhaps you haven’t noticed yet Master, but I... have my own body now.”

“What?” Yang Kai was shocked at those words and immediately probed with his Divine Sense. However, his Divine Sense was swallowed up as soon as it reached Liu Yan’s body. He couldn’t investigate the situation at all. It was the same as before, that was why Yang Kai couldn’t figure out much about Liu Yan’s current situation.

Now that he heard her say so did Yang Kai remember to take a closer look, but since his Divine Sense didn’t work, he could only use his hands.

Considering this, Yang Kai immediately reached out to pinch Liu Yan’s little cheek.

Once he made contact, he knew what Liu Yan said was true.

She did in fact have her own body now, because the sensation on his fingers was not just pure energy, it was real and solid! Not only that, but Liu Yan’s face was just like a human’s, very elastic and was soft to the touch. Yang Kai believed few people in this world could compare to her.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but squeeze it even more.

Liu Yan slapped his hand away in disgust, “That hurts!” She rubbed her cheek while pouting.

“How can this be?” Yang Kai frowned. Liu Yan was an Artifact Spirit that assumed human form. She was supposed to be a being of pure energy, so she couldn’t have her own physical body. As far as he knew, there existed a Spirit Pill called the Flesh Incarnation Pill that could help a cultivator who has lost their physical body regain one, but the refinement of that pill required the Flesh Incarnation Fruit, a spirit fruit that had already gone extinct.
