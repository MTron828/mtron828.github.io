All of them widened their eyes as they couldn’t believe what they saw.

A Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master had gathered all his strength to thrust out his spear, yet that spear was easily grasped by another Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master with only one hand. It proved that the latter must be immensely powerful.

“You’re from Heavenly Sword Union?” Yang Kai examined Kong Tian Yu, “Kong Feng was your father?”

Upon closer look, he realised that the person named Kong Tian Yu indeed shared some similarities with Kong Feng in terms of their appearances.

After recovering from the initial shock, Kong Tian Yu gripped his spear and with a flourish shook off Yang Kai’s grasp. Retreating a few steps to widen the gap with his enemy, both shocked and doubtful, he muttered, “You…”

Kong Tian Yu was shocked at the fact that his enemy possessed such incredible strength. Just now, he couldn’t detect Yang Kai using his World Force at all, but the latter could easily grab his spear. In other words, Yang Kai had only used brute force to accomplish this feat.

The fact that a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was able to reach such a point in terms of physical strength was unheard of. At the very least, throughout Kong Tian Yu’s Martial Dao, he had never come across anyone who was so strong before.

However, he wasn’t aware of the immensity of Yang Kai’s strength in his Dragon Form. No cultivators in the same Order could surpass him when it came to physical prowess.

“Heavenly Sword Union… Hahaha.” Yang Kai suddenly started chuckling, “Very good. I haven’t managed to visit your Sect yet, but you’ve come here to make a scene instead. Interesting indeed.”

After his return from the Shadowless Cave Heaven, Yang Kai subsequently destroyed Boundless Altar and Golden Rainbow Province to help the Proprietress resolve her heart demon oath, which sent a shock wave across the great forces that took part in the raid on Void Land. Consequently, many of those same great forces sent representatives to Void Land’s Star City with gifts and requested to meet Yang Kai as they were worried that he would also destroy their Sects.

In fact, Yang Kai didn’t really care about the great forces that had invaded Void Land before. At that time, they were forced to join the alliance for various reasons. Void Land was a powerful Sect now, so there was no point in settling the grudges against those minor great forces. It would be a waste of time and energy.

With that said, Yang Kai didn’t intend to let Heavenly Sword Union off.

He initially planned to call the roll and storm into Heavenly Sword Union to get even with them; however, the Dao Theory Assembly had derailed his plan, so he had to come to Yin-Yang Cave Heaven first.

It never crossed his mind that he would bump into Kong Feng’s son here. It seemed that Qing Kui had deliberately made him stay on Intertwining Fate Peak for this exact reason.

Then, Yang Kai let out a long sigh, “So troublesome. I initially planned to keep a low-profile, but it seems that won’t be possible now.”

He was fully aware of what was going on with the Dao Theory Assembly. The most powerful participants were only in the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm. By taking part in the assembly as Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he was like an adult who was competing against children. There was no doubt that he could easily win first place if nothing changed.

If he revealed his true strength now though, the situation in the Dao Theory Assembly would change. By then, people who were above the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm would participate in the assembly.

Then, it suddenly dawned upon Yang Kai that perhaps this was the exact outcome Xu Ling Gong and Qing Kui wanted to see. He reckoned that it must be the truth, and it wasn’t until this moment that he realised why he and Qu Hua Shang were caught in the act. This was all a plot set up by Xu Ling Gong.

[Cunning old fox!] Despite knowing that Xu Ling Gong was doing it for Qu Hua Shang, Yang Kai was still displeased as no one would be happy being manipulated.

“What are you talking about?” Kong Tian Yu glared at him as he finally calmed down. The fight between Open Heaven Realm Masters was always about the powers of their Small Universes, not physical strength. He was astonished that Yang Kai was able to easily grasp his spear just now, but he had now recovered from his shock.

“Regardless of what you say, you will die today!” Kong Tian Yu wielded his spear again and pointed it at Yang Kai. As he spoke, he pushed out his spear, which was surrounded with an aura from an experienced Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. As his World Force permeated the place, a trail of darkness was left behind that could hardly be healed as he extended his spear.

“I was the Young Union Master of Heavenly Sword Union and the successor to the Union Master. I had all the glory with me; however, it’s all because of you that I’m marginalised by the old farts in the Sect now. But so what? As long as I can become the winner in the Dao Theory Assembly, I’ll be the Young Master of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. By then, I’ll make all of them kneel before me and beg for my mercy! Hahaha! Do you see it now? That’s the difference between us! Although you’re also a Fifth-Order Master, you’re not comparable to me! I’ve been in this Order for hundreds of years while you only achieved an ascension two years ago. Let’s see how much longer you’ll… What!?”

Kong Tian Yu abruptly had his arrogant speech cut off as he became rooted to the spot. His hideous expression contorted as he gazed at his own hands with trembling eyes.

He was supposed to be holding a spear, which was a Fifth-Order artifact that Kong Feng had refined for him when he ascended to the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm in the past.

However, there was presently nothing in his hands. The Fifth-Order artifact that had been with him for hundreds of years had suddenly gone missing.

Looking up, he saw that his spear was now in Yang Kai’s hands as the latter nonchalantly wielded the weapon.

[When did that happen!?] Kong Tian Yu’s pupils contracted as the cold sweat slid down from his forehead to his cheeks. Although the young man in front of him looked ordinary, he felt like he could see the door of death slowly opening before his eyes.

The people around them were flabbergasted.

Initially, they could see that Kong Tian Yu’s attacks became increasingly menacing every time he pushed out his spear. Faced with the bombardment of attacks, Yang Kai’s only option would be to dodge and flee.

However, to their astonishment, the situation had been turned around in the blink of an eye. Kong Tian Yu’s artifact was snatched by his opponent, and no one could clearly see what happened at that moment. When they came to their senses, the dust had already settled.

“You talk too much.” Yang Kai shot a disinterested glance at Kong Tian Yu, “Moreover, that’s not how you’re supposed to use a spear. I’ll teach you a move.”

Then, he wielded the spear and slowly thrust it out towards Kong Tian Yu. Compared to the spear technique Kong Tian Yu had used, Yang Kai’s attack wasn’t intimidating at all; furthermore, it was outrageously slow as all of them could see the trail clearly.

Even a three-year-old kid could easily dodge it.

The spectators were all doubtful as they wondered what was special about the attack.

However, Kong Tian Yu, the only one actually facing the attack, was now in an utter state of panic. He could clearly feel that the spear contained a horrifying power that he could not possibly resist, and that the shadow of death was about to consume him whole.

He attempted to dodge, but regardless of how hard he tried, he was unable to move a muscle. The space around him seemed to have been sealed off, and even his senses seemed to have been warped, like time itself had slowed down.

The spear magnified before his eyes to the point where he could see nothing else.

*Hong…*

Violent force exploded as the spear struck Kong Tian Yu’s forehead and instantly exploded his head.

The headless corpse convulsed as blood started spurting out of his neck and dyed his snow-white robes scarlet.

The force lingering in the air slowly dissipated.

“Sixth-Order! A Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master!” Someone exclaimed.

*Xiu xiu xiu…*

All the spectators instantly fled in all directions with pale looks on their faces.

The Lord of Void Land, Yang Kai, who had just arrived, was actually a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

Despite being a powerful Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, Kong Tian Yu was still killed in one move.

Kong Tian Yu had been the most powerful person on Intertwining Fate Peak until now, so if he wasn’t a match for Yang Kai, there was no way the others would be able to deal with him. That was the reason that they had immediately fled as they were worried that Yang Kai would target them next.

“Have you learned it?” Yang Kai asked dispassionately, “In that case, you can rest in peace.”

Looking up next, Yang Kai saw a petite figure that looked like a young girl only seven or eight years old. Her face was pretty cute, and her hair had been tied into two ponytails. As she silently hovered in the air, she looked down at the entire Intertwining Fate Peak. There was a writing brush in her hand as she dipped it in her mouth before jotting something down on a pad. It seemed that she was trying to record something.

She had to be some kind of invigilator and there must be such a person on every Spirit Peak. They were the people sent by Yin-Yang Cave Heaven to observe the participants and everything they did would be recorded by them.

...

Yang Kai flashed a smile at her.

The young girl’s expression instantly darkened as she raised her book to stop Yang Kai from looking at her.

After storing Kong Tian Yu’s Space Ring, Yang Kai turned around and re-entered his lodging to continue cultivating.

Since he was a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master now, it was no big deal for him to kill a Fifth-Order Master, and the matter didn’t bother him one bit. If Kong Tian Yu hadn’t caused a scene, Yang Kai wouldn’t have ruthlessly ended his life.

However, that was perhaps the outcome Xu Ling Gong and Qing Kui wanted to see.

Since Yang Kai had revealed his Sixth-Order cultivation, the situation in the Dao Theory Assembly would soon change drastically.

Some disciples from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven soon came over to take the corpse away and clean up the blood. Just a while later, the spot in front of Yang Kai’s door was spotless once more, as though nothing had happened just now.

Just like Yang Kai had expected, after he returned to his room, messages were sent out in all directions. The fact that a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master appeared on Intertwining Fate Peak spread around at the speed of lightning.

On a certain Spirit Peak in a certain mountain range surrounded by mist, inside a gazebo, there were more than ten figures who were either standing or seated as they seemed to be having a casual chat. One of them was Xu Ling Gong.

The Dao Theory Assembly was meant to select a Husband for Qu Hua Shang, so as her Honoured Master, Xu Ling Gong was naturally unable to stay out of this matter. Therefore, he was here to receive the top Masters who came from other Cave Heavens and Paradises. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xu Ling Gong was a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master, so the people who deserved his attention were also High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters. Therefore, the people in the gazebo were all the Inner Elders from various Cave Heavens and Paradises. None of them was a nobody.

...

There was also another group of people outside of the gazebo, but unlike the meeting between the Elders, it was just a meet-up among the younger generation.
