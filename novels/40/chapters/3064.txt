The Heavens and Earth seemed to have been shattered; Sun and Moon seemed to have lost their lustre; Principles had plunged into chaos; World Energy had become turbulent; countless tears in space appeared; waves on the sea rose by more than 300 metres.

The Small World in which Dragon Island was located appeared unstable at the moment. The grand battle on this day was bound to be recorded in the history books.

The Dragon Clan members had gone all out to destroy their opponents while Yang Kai and his allies were tackling their enemies separately. Although the pressure had been distributed, Yang Kai still had to confront seven Great Dragons alone. He was the primary culprit for all the things that had happened on this day, so naturally the Dragons hated and targeted him the most.

Of all the battles at the moment, only the battle between Yang Kai and the seven Dragons might end up with a winning side.

Zhu Qing was going against two people on her own, but she wasn’t on the losing side. It was the same case for Jiu Feng, but she mainly dealt with her opponents by evading their attacks. Although she couldn’t defeat the two Dragon Clan members, they were unable to harm her either. Just like Zhu Qing’s battle, it was hard to tell which side would end up winning the fight in a short period of time.

On the other hand, Zhu Lie was having a one-on-one fight with his opponent. Both of them were Eighth-Order Great Dragons, which meant that they were equally powerful, so it was hard to tell who would end up being the winner.

Although Fu Qi, who was battling against Liu Yan, did not have as high a ranking bloodline, he had a strong foundation supported by the Dragon Clan’s extensive heritage. On the other hand, even though Liu Yan had obtained the Phoenix Clan’s inheritance, she was still far from full maturity. Not long after the battle began, she was put in a disadvantageous position. The Dragon roared and the Phoenix cried as they scuffled.

At that moment, Liu Yan could only try to protect herself. Instead of defeating her opponent, she just hoped that she could help lift some pressure off Yang Kai’s shoulder. Worried about Yang Kai’s safety, she was constantly distracted, so it was hard for her to parry her opponent’s attacks.

For the other battles, the balance hadn’t been tilted strongly in favour of anyone; however, Yang Kai was clearly on the losing side.

After the failed sneak attack, the seven Dragons closed in on Yang Kai again and did not give him any room to maneuver. In a subsequent manner, they used their own Dragon Clan Secret Techniques to bombard him.

Having been injured, Yang Kai appeared utterly battered as his huge figure kept writhing about in mid-air. In just a few minutes, more than a hundred new wounds had appeared on his body. The wounds were so deep that his bones had been revealed. His Dragon Scales were soaked in blood, which made it look like a layer of golden powder had been painted onto his body.

Fortunately, his physical toughness had improved significantly after the transformation. Otherwise, he would have lost his life countless times by now from the mere fallout of this kind of high-intensity battle.

It was also thanks to his Space Divine Ability that he could twist space at every critical moment and escape fatal damage.

As his Golden Blood dropped into the sea, countless Sea Beasts got a whiff of the smell and rushed over to gulp down the bloodied sea water in order to cultivate their own Dragonic nature. Dragon Blood was extremely precious, and in normal times, it was impossible for the Dragon Clan members to bleed. That was why, although these Sea Beasts had been living around Dragon Island for years, they had never had the chance to have a taste of Dragon Blood.

However, now, Dragon Blood was dropping into the sea as though it wasn’t worth anything, so naturally the Sea Beasts fought with each other to obtain a greater share.

In the sky, Yang Kai was battling against the seven Dragons while in the sea, countless Sea Beasts were slaughtering each other. The entire world seemed to have descended into madness and bloodlust.

As the battle went on, they gradually drifted away from Fu Chi’s Spirit Island, so the island had become hardly visible to the combatants.

Panting heavily, Yang Kai straightened up his 80-metre-long figure with an arrogant gaze. The seven Dragons surrounded him as they stared fixedly at him.

“You must die for humiliating the Dragon Clan!” One of the Dragons growled.

“That’s right!” The other six Dragons agreed as their Dragon Roars seemed to contain some traces of a Dragon Clan Secret Technique. Their roars then transformed into an invisible Soul Attack which launched itself at Yang Kai and penetrated his Knowledge Sea.

After such a long battle, they had become less wary of Yang Kai. Earlier, they were indeed shocked by his ruthlessness when he crippled their fellow clansman in the blink of an eye; however, now it seemed that Yang Kai wasn’t as powerful as he appeared to be. He only managed to succeed before because he mounted a sneak attack.

It was a great honour for Yang Kai to have seven Dragons battle against him, so he should not have any regret even if he had to die.

Unperturbed, Yang Kai picked his ear and grinned, “It’s still too soon to tell who will be killed in the end! Don’t get too conceited, otherwise, you might end up having to eat your words.”

“Bold!” One Dragon Clan member growled impatiently, “Since you’re set on dying today, I’ll grant your wish!”

After he finished his words, deafening Dragon roars could be heard as the seven Dragons pounced on Yang Kai from all directions. The whole world was filled with their boiling Dragon Pressure. Any Third-Order Emperor Realm Master would be terrified of this Dragon Pressure and lose the power to resist.

Although Yang Kai wasn’t so weak, the playful smile on his face faded as his expression turned serious. Even though he wasn’t willing to admit it, he indeed couldn’t defeat the seven Dragons here on his own. These Dragon Clan members were truly hard to deal with.

[I need more people to help me.] With this thought in mind, Yang Kai tried to evade the Dragons’ attacks while secretly activating his Divine Sense.

On the other hand, Fu Ling and the Blue Dragon had joined forces to stop Zhu Qing, but there was no clear winner in sight. The three Dragons were tussling with each other in the sky, which made the atmosphere quite lively.

Suddenly, Fu Ling stopped what she was doing and sent out a Divine Sense Message to the Blue Dragon. Understanding her intention, the Blue Dragon twisted her body and rushed towards Zhu Qing.

Just then, Fu Ling, who was in her Purple Dragon form, suddenly flew towards the Blue Dragon and clawed at her stomach.

*Chi…*

The Blue Dragon shuddered and instinctively avoided getting her vitals injured; however, she soon felt a sharp pain in her stomach. At the same time, she was engulfed in the Ninth-Order Dragon’s Dragon Pressure, rendering her unable to circulate the Dragon Essence within her body. After she grunted with difficulty, her 150-metre-long figure started shrinking at a rapid speed.

[Bloodline suppression!] The Blue Dragon was both terrified and puzzled, as she didn’t understand what was going on. When she turned to look at Fu Ling, an inconceivable idea sprang into her mind, so she growled, “Fu Ling, you…”

At this moment, there was a light blue Dragon Scale gripped in Fu Ling’s Dragon Claw, and that scale obviously belonged to the Blue Dragon. It wouldn’t matter if it was just an ordinary scale, but that particular scale was where the Dragon Temple’s Blessing had been placed.

With the scale pulled out, the Blessing Technique had lost its effect, which was why she was affected by bloodline suppression immediately.

She still couldn’t understand why Fu Ling would attack her all of a sudden. If it weren’t because she was unsuspecting of her, she wouldn’t have let her have a chance to hurt her critically and destroy the Blessing Technique.

Apparently, Zhu Qing didn’t expect this either. While Fu Ling was mounting a sneak attack on the Blue Dragon, she approached Fu Ling and wrapped her body around the latter’s figure tightly. Then, she placed her pointed Dragon Claw on Fu Ling’s head, causing her red Dragon Blood to stream out of her wounds.

“Big Sister Qing, wait!” Fu Ling yelled in fright.

Her Dragon Form was less than half as big as that of Zhu Qing’s. It didn’t feel so obvious when she was battling against Zhu Qing alongside the Blue Dragon, but now that she had to face Zhu Qing directly, she started feeling horrified.

It seemed that Zhu Qing could end her life at any moment. It felt terrible to have her life or death controlled by someone else, but there was nothing she could do.

Zhu Qing grunted curiously and stopped what she was doing. After taking a look at the Blue Dragon, she shifted her attention to Fu Ling and asked, “Why did you do that?”

She didn’t understand why Fu Ling would mount a sneak attack on the Blue Dragon, as she and Fu Ling were not on good terms.

“I’m brother-in-law’s person,” Fu Ling hurriedly explained.

“Brother-in-law?”

“Yang Kai. Big Brother Yang.”

“What?” A murderous intent flashed across Zhu Qing’s eyes suddenly.

Fu Ling was astounded, but upon realizing the problem, she hurriedly added, “Brother-in-law planted a Soul Imprint in my Knowledge Sea previously, so I have to obey him now!”

She understood why Zhu Qing seemed to have the intention of killing her as she had said she was ‘Yang Kai’s person’, which obviously led Zhu Qing to misunderstand that there was some kind of immoral relationship between the two.

“He planted a Soul Imprint in your Knowledge Sea?!” Zhu Qing yelled in disbelief, immediately understanding why Fu Ling would help her all of a sudden.

Fu Ling hurriedly nodded, “Yes, he ordered me to make a move just now.”

“Got it!” Zhu Qing retracted her claw and took a look at the Blue Dragon. At this moment, the Blue Dragon had returned to her Human form. Under a Ninth-Order Dragon’s suppression, it was pointless for her to sustain her Dragon form, so she decided that she should just save her strength.

There was a long wound on her stomach as her blood was still streaming out of it. She covered her wound with her hand and glared at Fu Ling.

Anyone would be furious after experiencing such a sneak attack. However, upon hearing Fu Ling’s explanation, she understood that Fu Ling was left with no choice. Nevertheless, it was a humiliation for a Dragon Clan member to have a Soul Imprint planted in their Knowledge Sea by a Human, so she couldn’t help disdainfully gazing at Fu Ling.

“Big Sister Qing, brother-in-law needs help.” Fu Ling looked apprehensively at Zhu Qing.

“Don’t call him brother-in-law! Also, Zhu Lie will never marry you!” Upon finishing her words, Zhu Qing swung her Dragon Tail and flew towards Yang Kai.

She knew that Fu Ling was a promiscuous woman, so she didn’t want Zhu Lie to get married to her.

“I’m sorry.” Fu Ling looked at the Blue Dragon with an embarrassed expression and apologized to her.

“Keep the apology to yourself until you face the Second Elder. Let’s see if she’ll forgive you!” The Blue Dragon sneered.

A sense of fear flashed across Fu Ling’s eyes, but there was nothing else she could say, so she hurriedly raced after Zhu Qing.

Zhu Qing was worried about Yang Kai’s safety, so she was flying at full speed. As her gigantic figure soared across the sky, she left behind a beautiful arc that seemed to blaze with crimson flames, even burning some marks into the space she passed through.

Although Fu Ling was only one step later than Zhu Qing, she could hardly keep pace with her, so she was slightly frustrated.

Yang Kai didn’t just order her to go over to help. Most importantly, they had to destroy the other Dragon Clan members one by one, which was the key to winning the battle today.

Their biggest disadvantage was the small number of people on their side. However, if they could help Zhu Lie, Jiu Feng, and Liu Yan defeat their opponents first, there would be six of them by then. Although they would still be at a disadvantage when confronted by seven Dragons, their collective power would become much greater. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Unfortunately, before she could explain Yang Kai’s plan to Zhu Qing in detail, the latter had flown off. That was why Fu Ling was anxious, as she was worried that Yang Kai might reprimand her later.

Yang Kai’s battlefield wasn’t far away from Zhu Qing’s, so it only took them a short moment to reach it. When Zhu Qing saw the state Yang Kai was in, her eyes turned bloodshot.

At that moment, the seven Great Dragons were ganging up on Yang Kai like thugs. Every inch on his towering figure had been wounded and big pieces of his flesh had been completely torn off, revealing his bones.
