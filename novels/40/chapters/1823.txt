Chapter 1823, This Sect Master Promises Not to Kill You

It was quite evident that it wasn’t Xia Ning Chang’s true body rather an embodiment of her made from the wisp of her soul, that’s all. At this moment, Xia Ning Chang’s clear and crystal eyes were filled with anxiety and helplessness, along with a sliver of anger.

Meanwhile, that middle-aged man and the other Origin Returning Realm cultivators looked calm and steady, like everything was in their grasp.

Both sides seemed to be locked in a confrontation.

After a long time, the middle-aged man parted his lips and spoke, “This King had been waiting for many days, I wonder if Young Lady Xia had given it a thought? Can you give this King a satisfactory answer?”

Xia Ning Chang furrowed her brow and responded gently, “Can you wait a little longer? This matter is very important. I need to discuss it with my Junior Brother but the problem is that I can’t get in touch with my Junior Brother.”

The middle-aged man let out a cold harrumph in response. “Young Lady Xia, are you kidding me? This King has been tolerant and doesn’t want to use force because of the fact that you have refined the Star Source at such a young age. I love people with talents, but you have been passing the buck several times. Do you think that this King is a fool? Everyone would generally consult with their Honored Master when in trouble, why would you discuss with your Junior Brother? It’s really ridiculous.”

“But...” Xia Ning Chang said to herself. [Honored Master’s cultivation is even worse than mine, how can it be comparable to Junior Brother?]

“No buts,” the middle-aged man interrupted Xia Ning Cheng impatiently. “Since you’re unwilling to cooperate, then this King can only extract all of this world’s World Energy and turn it into a Dead Star! As for the Star Source, since you aren’t willing to let it go, then this King doesn’t want it either! When I have extracted all its World Energy, this King would like to see how long will you be able to hold its Star Source without the support of World Energy! How would Missy bring it back to life? Hehe, there are hundreds of millions of beings living on this planet ... without the nourishment of World Energy, I’m afraid they will be reduced to nothing but bones!”

“Wait!” Xia Ning Chang turned pale in fear. Her eyes were filled with hesitation and helplessness.

The middle-aged man sneered at her as a steadfast look appeared on his face. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

He might not have been communicating with Xia Ning Chang for long but he could see that she had a scanty experience of life and was kind-hearted. She didn’t want to see this planet slowly go extinct. It was for this reason that he could threaten her to let go of the Star Source.

Otherwise, it was impossible to get an already refined Star Source unless he found her true body and killed her.

But how could the middle-aged man know where her true body was? Xia Ning Chang let a wisp of her soul come here only because she had sensed that there was something wrong with the planet. Unless he had some super Divine Ability that could follow her Divine Sense and track the location of Xia Ning Chang’s true body.

Judging by the extremely distressed look on Xia Ning Chang’s face, the middle-aged man knew that his threat had worked. [How can a little and kind-hearted girl like her bear it when I’m using the lives of billions of creatures to pressure her?] He timely struck the iron while it was hot, “Young Lady Xia, this King is unwilling to resort to acts of cruelty. If you release your reign over this Star Source and allow this King to refine it, this King will become this planet’s Star Master. How can I not care about this planet as its Star Master?”

“But... but haven’t you been extracting its World Energy?” Xia Ning Chang wasn’t clear about the sinister Spirit Devouring Crystal. As such, she hadn’t noticed the evil intentions of the other party for the moment.

“It’s just deconstruction before reconstruction.” The middle-aged man smiled a little. “Young Lady Xia, I can’t tell you why. Young Lady just needs to know that if you allow this King to refine the Star Source, this King will definitely lead this planet to prosperity!”

“Is that really so!?” Xin Ning Chang murmured to herself. She might be kind and simple in nature but it didn’t mean that she was a fool. She could naturally tell that this middle-aged man was far from honest and good. But the opposite party was threatening her weakness.

[If I don’t let go of the Star Source and let him refine it, he would really draw all the World Energy of this world sooner or later. By then, it would already be reduced to a Dead Star.]

The very day she became the Star Master of this Cultivation Star, she could feel the billions of lives living on Tong Xuan Realm. She could feel all the ups and downs of this planet. How could she bear to watch this planet be reduced to a cold and lifeless planet?

Xia Ning Chang really had no idea what to do. There was only one thing echoing in her mind, [Junior Brother, where are you? What would have done if you were in position?]

“Little Senior Sister, don’t listen to his bullshit!” Suddenly, a voice reverberated in the depths of the core.

Xia Ning Chang immediately raised her head. Instinctively, she thought that she was just imagining things; her ears were playing tricks on her. But when she saw a familiar figure walking out of the darkness not far away, and saw the smile on that familiar face, she realized that her Junior Brother was actually here.

Xia Ning Chang looked as if she would break into tears anytime now; she was extremely aggrieved.

Having been negotiating with the middle-aged man over the past few days, her delicate and sensitive heart was under unimaginable pressure, but she was still dealing courteously but without insincerity. But when this figure appeared, Xia Ning Chang suddenly felt that her entire body was about to collapse. Her shoulders had been bearing a burden all the while; it almost crushed her bones. Only when this burden was relieved that she came to realize what she was carrying.

“Junior Brother!” Xia Ning Chang pursed her lips and shouted.

“Senior Sister, don’t cry!” Yang Kai’s figure flickered before he appeared right before the wisp of Xia Ning Chang’s soul, staring at her. He then pursed his lips into a smile and immediately consoled her, “It’s okay, everything’s okay! I’m here now!”

He comforted her like he was comforting a little child. He almost patted Xia Ning Chang’s head several times.

Xia Ning Chang nodded obediently.

“Did you notice that something was wrong here, so your wisp of soul came?” Yang Kai immediately understood everything with just one glance. Only a Star Master could do this. He too could let a wisp of his soul return to Shadowed Star if he wanted to, but his consumption would be too much. “It’s not good for the soul to remain this far for so long. It can cause irreparable harm easily. Go back and tell them that I will return to the Sect soon, they don’t need to worry.”

“Mhmm, Junior Brother, be careful. These people...”

“It’s okay! It’s just a few wastes who can’t show their faces in public, that’s all.” Yang Kai sneered.

Xia Ning Chang smiled sweetly upon hearing this. She was no longer worried. She then formed some seals as the embodiment of her soul slowly disappeared.

But just before Xia Ning Chang left, she suddenly seemed to have remembered something. She hurriedly said, “By the way, Junior Brother, Yang Yan, she ...”

“What happened to Yang Yan?” Yang Kai panicked. But there was no trace of Xia Ning Chang before him. Her wisp of soul had already crossed the Starry Sky and returned to Shadowed Star.

“What the hell happened?” Yang Kai was depressed. Xia Ning Chang might not know Yang Yan’s true identity, but he was completely aware of it. Yang Yan had been sleeping after returning from the Emperor Garden; apparently, her true body and embodiment had completely fused. It had been over a decade now, and he had no idea about her current situation. And now when Xia Ning Chang suddenly brought up Yang Yan but failed to finish her sentence, Yang Kai grew completely impatient.

“Look how I deal with you after I return!” Yang Kai thought in his mind, furious.

“Brat, how dare you judge this King like this.” The middle-aged man and the Origin Returning Realm cultivators had been staring at Yang Kai vigilantly since he showed up. But Yang Kai’s recent comment that they were just wastes who can’t show their faces in public had immediately drawn their ire.

In addition, Yang Kai had also denied them the opportunity of getting the Star Source that they were just about to get with just a few words. How could the middle-aged man take this? He immediately shouted in anger.

Yang Kai slowly turned around and responded with a sneer, glaring at them, “What’s wrong? Are you guys not wastes? Several grown men were threatening and bullying a little girl. Calling you guys wastes is an insult to all wastes!”

The middle-aged man let out a cold snort as an intense murderous intent filled his eyes.

“Who just said that he will turn this planet into a Dead Star? If you stand up now, this Sect Master promises not to kill you!” Yang Kai glared at the people before him and acted in a completely rampant manner.

“Kid, don’t think that you can act lawlessly with just a little bit of strength. A frog in a well knows nothing of the ocean. Judging by the fact that you have reached the Origin King Realm at such a young age, you can be considered to have good talent. How about you join this King? This King can provide you with an awesome Secret Technique that can let you reach the top as quickly as possible,” the middle-aged said in a serious voice, carrying his hands behind his back. His tone and bearing gave the impression of a grandmaster.

“What!? This kid is in Origin King Realm!?”

“This kid!?”

“Impossible!?”

The Origin Returning Realm masters behind the middle-aged man were struck with terror, screaming one after another. They had been trying to sense Yang Kai’s cultivation all the while but they noticed that they couldn’t find any clues at all, so they believed that he was wearing some artifact that could isolate their Divine Senses. How could they know that the other party was stronger than themselves?

[But ... is there such a young Origin King Realm expert?]

Yang Kai chuckled and rebuked contemptuously, “You people from the Spirit Devouring Sect are really idiots! No wonder your Sect was destroyed.”

The middle-aged man’s pupils immediately shrunk upon hearing this. “You know that we are from the Spirit Devouring Sect, so what gave you the guts to act so rampantly?”

The Origin Returning Realm masters shuddered as if someone came to know of their deep, dark secrets. Fear apparent in their eyes.

“So what if I am acting rampantly? Come and bite me if you don’t like it!” Yang Kai sneered. “If you don’t have guts to do it, how about I lend you some?”

The middle-aged man’s entire body shook in anger but he didn’t dare to make a move. He had long noticed that Yang Kai was in First-Order Origin King Realm, the same as him, so he wasn’t a hundred percent sure that he could Yang Kai. That’s the only reason why he had been bearing Yang Kai’s arrogance.

But he couldn’t let the secret of the Spirit Devouring Sect be brought to anyone’s notice. Or else, they would quite likely be chased and killed by all the cultivators of the Star Field.

The middle-aged man was in a big dilemma. He didn’t know what to do.

Yang Kai, noticing his hesitation, sneered and added fuel to the fire, “By the way, I killed a few members of your Spirit Devouring Sect before coming here. One of them happened to be someone called Spirit Devouring Sect Young Sect Master. What was his name? Right, Mu Cheng Feng, that guy was your son, right!? Sect Master Mu Wu!?”

Mu Wu shuddered as his eyes turned bloodshot. “You killed Cheng Feng!?”

“Uh, that’s not right, per se. I’m sorry.” Yang Kai smiled apologetically. “I didn’t kill him. I just beat him up a bit. Well, he was beaten to death by the members of the Shrouded Heaven Mansion, dying miserably. He was minced to pieces. Sect Master Mu Wu, if you had been there and saw it, you would have surely cried. Tsk, tsk...”
