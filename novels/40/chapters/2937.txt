By the time he recovered, Zhu Lie had already backed thousands of metres away while Yang Kai laughed maniacally, “Where do you think you’re going!”

Space Principles fluctuated around him and he caught up with Zhu Lie in an instant, grabbing his Dragon Tail with both claws and yanking it hard.

Zhu Lie, who was heading straight for the sky, was held back by that force, and his huge Dragon Body plunged downward involuntarily as a deafening roar came from his mouth. He suddenly turned his head around and opened his mouth wide, biting towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai sneered. Body weaving back and forth, not only did he avoid Zhu Lie’s attack, he even tied his tail into a bow knot.

Having made a breakthrough in his Dragon Transformation Secret Art, the Golden Divine Dragon’s Source was stimulated to a far greater extent. Yang Kai suddenly felt as if this Zhu Lie was completely not his opponent at all, and he was convinced that this feeling was correct.

It’s not that he had become stronger, but rather that the bloodline of the Half-Dragon Form he transformed into had become purer. It was enough to allow him to suppress Zhu Lie’s bloodline.

“Hou!” Zhu Lie roared furiously, voice filled with grief and anger as if he had been greatly humiliated. A member of the Dragon Clan, ruler of the myriad spirits, actually had his tail tied into a bow. It was simply intolerable. He shook his tail in an attempt to shake off Yang Kai’s hold, but under the bloodline suppression, he was able to use at most seventy percent of his strength, so how could he succeed?

Yang Kai was grabbing onto Zhu Lie’s Dragon Tail and refused to let go. With a shout, the muscles on his arms swelled, and he spun him hard.

*Huchi…*

*Huchi…*

The two-hundred-metre-long Great Dragon was like a toy in Yang Kai’s hands, being spun around and around just like a windmill.

The eyes of the group of Emperor Realm Masters from Star Soul Palace and Azure Sun Temple widened at this sight. Even the soles of their feet were feeling a little cramped from this display.

In the beginning, the speed of the rotation was not too fast; however, the speed gradually became more and more violent. Zhu Lie’s two hundred-metre-tall body now looked like a blurry flat disk, like he was able to form countless clones of himself. With Yang Kai as the centre, Zhu Lie’s figure seemed to be re-created over a dozen times.

But that wasn’t even close, merely a series of after-images left behind by the speed of rotation.

Zhu Lie was dizzy from all the spinning and was unable to gather any of the Dragon Essence from his body. Feeling the stares of the group of ants below, he would rather pass out immediately than suffer this indescribable shame.

With a *xiu* sound, Yang Kai let go and Zhu Lie slammed into the ground just like a meteor.

The earth shook and dust rose up as a huge crater appeared, the two hundred-metre-long dragon shook its head in the crater, trying to get up but was stumbling around like a drunk.

Yang Kai came down from the sky and rode atop Zhu Lie’s head, grabbing one of his Dragon Horns with one hand while clenching his fist and slamming it with the other.

*Hong hong hong…*

Just like a large hammer crashing down on their hearts, each one of Yang Kai’s blows caused the hearts of Wen Zi Shan and the others to clench.

Zhu Lie tried to fight back, but under the double pressure of the bloodline suppression and his dizziness, his resistance seemed extremely childish and ridiculous.

“Come, come, come, tell me now what the immensity of Heaven and Earth is!” Yang Kai said while punching him.

But Zhu Lie wasn’t in the mood for jokes anymore. He could do nothing but hiss and growl. Hearing Yang Kai’s ridicule and sarcasm filled him with even more grief. He almost spat out the blood that was rolling around inside his chest.

After raining down hundreds of punches one after another, Zhu Lie’s head was smashed open. A few pieces of his Dragon Scales almost cracked, and he seemed to be exhausted. Crawling on the ground, Zhu Lie was panting heavily with his big tongue hanging out to the side, but his giant Dragon Eyes were still filled with flames of fury.

If there was no bloodline suppression, then he would definitely jump up and swallow Yang Kai into his belly right now.

“So, do you still want me to go to Dragon Island?” Yang Kai was still riding on his head, tossing a slap across his face while speaking. Even his own hand was in pain from all the blows.

“Whether you’re willing or not, you have to go. The Dragon Clan won’t…”

Before he could finish, Yang Kai had already gotten up and stomped on his head with tremendous force. Zhu Lie’s Dragon Head hit the ground with a bang and he almost bit his tongue. He quickly shut his mouth after that.

“I’ll ask you one more time. Do you still want me to go to Dragon Island?” Yang Kai looked at him from above.

After having suffered an initial loss, how would Zhu Lie dare to answer him?

“You think I can’t handle you?” Yang Kai sneered and began scanning his body. He noticed something during their battle before, he wasn’t too sure what it was he saw. Now was the best time for him to take a look.

In just a few moments, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, a burning gaze stopping upon a Dragon Scale around Zhu Lie’s neck.

At first glance, that Dragon Scale didn’t seem much different from the rest. However, if one looked closely, then differences of this Dragon Scale could be felt. Its colour seemed to be darker, and its aura was also a little different.

Using his Dragon Claws, Yang Kai grabbed the washbasin-sized Dragon Scale directly.

“What are you doing?” Zhu Lie turned his head over and roared in shock, but when he saw what Yang Kai was up to, he began to struggle even harder. It was not known where this strength came from, but he even tried to fly up to the sky.

Yang Kai ignored him and just grabbed hold of the Dragon Scale with both hands. With a shout, he drew all the strength in his body to rip it violently from Zhu Lie’s body.

With a *chi la*, Dragon Blood splashed everywhere and Zhu Lie’s pained cry filled the sky.

His Great Dragon Body also shrunk in an instant, turning into a red-haired young man in the blink of an eye. In human form, Zhu Lie appeared to be in his early twenties. With sharp brows and bright eyes, he was exquisite in both demeanour and appearance, with healthy jade white skin. With an appearance like his, he was bound to attract the attention of countless women no matter where he went.

However, after taking a beating from Yang Kai, Zhu Lie looked more miserable at this moment. His red hair was messy as if it had not been groomed for more than a decade, his body was covered in bruises and his clothes were messy. There was even a small wound gushing with fresh blood on his neck.

After losing that Dragon Scale, Zhu Lie no longer had the strength to resist the Golden Divine Dragon Source Strength in Yang Kai’s body, to the point where he could not even maintain his dragon form.

He leapt out from the ground and pounced like a madman at the scale in Yang Kai’s hand, shouting, “Give it back! That’s mine!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

But right now, in front of Yang Kai’s forty-metre Half-Dragon Form, Zhu Lie was as laughable as a child.

Yang Kai slapped him down like a mosquito, hitting Zhu Lie directly into the ground. Then, Yang Kai stepped on his head with one foot so that he could not move before observing the Dragon Scale in his hand, asking, “So this is what you were relying on to face me?”

Zhu Lie gritted his teeth and refused to answer.

“Without this, how are you going to be bringing me back to Dragon Island?” Yang Kai grinned viciously and looked down at Zhu Lie, coldly snorting, “Seems like that girl Zhu Qing revealed a lot about me.”

Yang Kai was truly annoyed. Zhu Lie was clearly not unprepared during this visit. If he had not been able to make a breakthrough in this Dragon Transformation Secret Art at the crucial moment, then there was no saying who would have won or lost that battle just now.

Information about him must have been revealed by that damned girl, Zhu Qing, which made Yang Kai feel a little uncomfortable.

But on further thought, Zhu Qing was a member of the Dragon Clan. He rejected her request to travel to Dragon Island several times, so it was only natural that she would reveal some of his information.

“Tell me, how does this offset the bloodline suppression?” Yang Kai asked in a solemn voice.

Before this, he thought that the Dragon Scale didn’t belong to Zhu Lie, and that it was the Dragon Scale of a higher-ranking Great Dragon from Dragon Island. However, upon closer inspection, he realized he was wrong. This was indeed Zhu Lie’s Dragon Scale, but as for why the colour was deeper and the aura different, it likely had to do with the enhancement of some Secret Technique.

Yang Kai was a little wary about such a Secret Technique.

Two Dragon Clan members approached him one after another, so there was no saying he might not have to deal with even more of them in the future. He couldn’t rely on making a breakthrough with his Dragon Transformation Secret Art and Golden Divine Dragon Source Strength each time. So, if he could figure out what Secret Technique this was, then he could also make preparations beforehand.

“Just kill me!” Zhu Lie stiffened his neck, seemingly ready to face death unflinchingly as he sneered, “Do you have the guts to slay a member of the Dragon Clan?”

Yang Kai’s expression turned cold, “I can’t stand people provoking me. Once people provoke me, I tend to get impulsive, and there’s no saying what I’m capable of doing when I’m impulsive. So, young man, don’t try and act smart. Whether you live or die is up to my whims right now.”

Zhu Lie gritted his teeth and said nothing more.

Suddenly, Yang Kai crouched down and took a closer look at Zhu Lie’s profile, frowning, “What’s your relationship with Zhu Qing?”

“I have nothing to say about it!” Zhu Lie coldly snorted.

“So be it, then!” Yang Kai spat disdainfully. He just felt that this guy and Zhu Qing shared some similarities in their appearance, and they were both Red Dragons, so they should be related in some way. That was why Yang Kai had asked; however, since the other party didn’t want to answer, he also couldn’t be bothered to get to the bottom of it.

Wen Zi Shan and Lei Hong flew over side by side and stopped ten metres away from Yang Kai, their expression appearing complicated.

Nobody thought that things would escalate to this extent.

At the very beginning, when both Yang Kai and Zhu Lie were engaged in a heated battle, they thought that Yang Kai would be the one to lose. They thought they would wait for the Dragon to vent his anger before coming out to deal with the aftermath, but who knew that Yang Kai would be so fierce as to be able to beat a Dragon into the ground, and even trample him underfoot?

This made things difficult!

“Great Elder Lei, you came just in time!” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as if he had found his saviour when he saw Lei Hong.

Lei Hong’s body suddenly froze, and a bad feeling came over him in an instant. He suddenly regretted not having left earlier and actually foolishly followed Wen Zi Shan over. Wasn’t he just finding trouble for himself?

Yang Kai paid Great Elder Lei’s obvious apprehension no mind and carried on, “I caught a Dragon, but this guy is being too arrogant and domineering, so I think it best I hand him to you to bring him back to Star Soul Palace for the Great Emperor to deal with. Whether he kills him or skins him, it’s all up to the Great Emperor. I have no objections either way!”

The corner of Lei Hong’s mouth twitched and he was unwilling to move any closer. Acting as if he did not hear what Yang Kai said, he turned to Wen Zi Shan and cupped his fists, “Temple Master Wen, since the matter has come to an end, this Lei will say his farewells here. We still have to trouble Temple Master Wen on the matter of the Demon Banishment Order. My Star Soul Palace will also do its best to aid in this hunt. If there is any news, please inform me as soon as possible.”
