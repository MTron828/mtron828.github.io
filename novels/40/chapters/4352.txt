Manager Zhou asked with a bitter face, “Can Sect Master Yang change his conditions?”

Yang Kai shook his head slowly, “I cannot.”

Manager Zhou couldn’t help but smile bitterly, and after pondering for a long time, he said, “This matter is very important, and this Old Master can’t make the decision. I will need to consult my superiors for instructions, but Sect Master Yang, I think there is a good chance that those in charge will not agree to your demands.”

Yang Kai said in response, “Manager Zhou, just ask, whether they agree or not is up to them.”

“Then… all right.” Now that it had come to this, there was no need for further discussion. Each of them had put forward their own requirements and conditions. The only thing remaining was to see whether the two sides could reach an agreement on the issue. It was not something for Manager Zhou to decide, so he stood up and said, “Good, this Old Master will leave first and deal with this matter.”

Yang Kai personally sent him out of the reception hall before returning.

Qu Hua Shang, wrapped in a fragrant scent, rushed to Yang Kai’s side and stretched out her hand without hesitation and took his arm. With her large twin peaks pressing up against his arm, she delicately called out, “Junior Brother…”

Yang Kai looked at her with narrowed eyes and said with a headache, “Does Senior Sister have something to say? I promise I will never refuse if it is something I can do!”

Qu Hua Shang smiled and exhaled a breath filled with the scent of an orchid in Yang Kai’s ear, “I knew Junior Brother was the best. About those Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills…”

Yang Kai pulled his arms out of Qu Hua Shang’s grasp, and said with a smile while he faced her directly, “Before Senior Sister speaks, could she please confirm whether she came to Void Land this time for herself or for Yin-Yang Cave Heaven?”

Qu Hua Shang’s long lashes fluttered when she blinked, “Is there a difference?”

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Senior Sister, do you have to ask me that?”

“Junior Brother, you’re so ruthless.” Qu Hua Shang’s face was filled with resentment, like she was a weak woman abandoned by Yang Kai after a thoughtless night of fun, which would make one feel sorry for her, “Why ask such a cruel question, Junior Brother? Did you forget how tightly we held one another in the Blood Monster Cave Heaven just to stay warm?”

Yang Kai said sternly, “It is precisely because I remember that I have to ask clearly.”

Qu Hua Shang gave him a charming look. This woman had originally already been a seductress, but now that she had advanced to the Open Heaven Realm, she had become more and more enchanting…

Yang Kai sat down and drank his tea without looking at her.

Qu Hua Shang, annoyed, came to sit down beside him angrily, after which she puffed up her cheeks and said, “Since Junior Brother wants to distinguish between public and private affairs, let’s talk about proper business first!”

Yang Kai gestured in agreement.

Qu Hua Shang continued, “My Yin-Yang Cave Heaven would like to buy some Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills from Junior Brother!”

“No!” Yang Kai replied immediately.

Qu Hua Shang glared at him fiercely, slapped the table and said, “Just now you and Old Zhou said that you would sell 3 to Asura Cave Heaven!”

Yang Kai said slowly, “Naturally, that was the last available stock.”

Qu Hua Shang’s chest heaved as she grit her teeth and said, “You will not suffer a loss in terms of price, Junior Brother. I can make the decision on that.”

Yang Kai thought for a while, then smiled, “If Yin-Yang Cave Heaven can sell me a High-Rank Yin Element treasure…”

“Junior Brother, you should give up on that, those old farts agreeing to this condition is absolutely impossible.” Qu Hua Shang said speechlessly, “No matter how high a price you offer it won’t happen!”

Yang Kai raised his brow and asked, “Is Senior Sister certain?”

Qu Hua Shang gently nodded, “I don’t dare to say anything else, but what Old Zhou said was right. The attitudes maintained by the Cave-Heavens and Paradises are firm and united, no one will sell you a High-Rank Yin Element treasure.”

Yang Kai frowned.

Seeing that he was in a low mood, Qu Hua Shang also slightly regretted that she had spoken too much, and swiftly changed the subject, “Junior Brother, what if it is I, your Senior Sister, who wants Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills?”

Yang Kai casually asked, “How many does Senior Sister need?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Qu Hua Shang looked at him in disbelief, “Do you have that many of them?”

Yang Kai smiled slightly, “I don’t have a lot, but it should meet Senior Sister Qu’s needs.”

Qu Hua Shang fidgeted for a while before muttering awkwardly, “Five… No, three is enough.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Yang Kai put a jade bottle in front of her. Qu Hua Shang picked it up and opened it, only to see that there were five Spirit Pills inside. Although she had never seen this Spirit Pill before, she was certain that they were Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills.

With some slight shock, Qu Hua Shang called out, “Junior Brother, you…” She was now an Open Heaven Realm Master, so naturally she had no need for these Spirit Pills. It was not possible that Yang Kai was unaware of this, but he still took out five of them the instant she asked.

Yang Kai followed up, “In the Blood Monster Cave Heaven, if it were not for Senior Sister’s unwavering support, I am afraid that the consequences would have been disastrous. No cost can be put on a life saving grace, so a few trivial Spirit Pills is nothing. Senior Sister asked for them, so how can I, as your Junior Brother, refuse?”

Qu Hua Shang was deeply moved, and as squeezed the jade bottle in her hand tightly, she whispered, “Junior Brother, thank you!”

Putting away the jade bottle, Qu Hua Shang added, “There is one more thing that I need the help of Junior Brother for!”

“Senior Sister, please speak.”

“When I came this time, I was also ordered by my Master to come to your Void Star City to set up a Dao Temple, but I came a little late, and the better locations were taken away by others, so…”

Yang Kai nodded knowingly, but was also a little puzzled, “Why does Yin-Yang Cave Heaven want to set up a Dao Temple? Could it be to open the door to accept disciples? But there’s no need to do that in this Star City.”

Qu Hua Shang smiled, “You should have some understanding of the situation in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. Disciples, whether male or female, need to find a partner when the time is right, but how difficult is it to find a partner who is suitable for them and can accompany them for a lifetime? Even if they do find someone appealing, they may not be willing to marry into Yin-Yang Cave Heaven.”

She glanced at Yang Kai accusingly as she spoke.

Yang Kai looked down his nose, ignoring her stare.

“That’s why some of the outstanding disciples from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven need to go out for life experience and to mingle with fellow cultivators in various Dao Temples, so as to find a good match.”

“So that’s how it is!” Yang Kai nodded. Yin-Yang Cave Heaven was trying to use this as a way to recruit people under them and enhance their own strength, “A simple matter. I’ll have Second Manager accompany you and let you choose whichever location you need for your Dao Temple.”

“Then this Senior Sister will thank Junior Brother in advance.” Qu Hua Shang thanked him, and after a pause, pursed her lips and smiled, “Now that proper business is over, let’s talk about private affairs.”

Yang Kai looked at her suspiciously, “What else does Senior Sister want to talk about?”

Qu Hua Shang blushed slightly and replied shyly, “Could it be that Junior Brother forgot what I told you in the Blood Monster Cave Heaven? Those words are still valid now, so if you could agree…”

She now seemed like a na?ve young lady, one who would grasp everyone’s attention.

Yang Kai wanted to ask what was going on, but when he saw her eyes, he understood everything. In the Blood Monster Cave Heaven, Qu Hua Shang wanted to recruit Yang Kai on behalf of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, bluntly saying that she hoped that he could enter Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, the premise being only after she broke through to the Open Heaven Realm.

...

However, at that time, Qu Hua Shang was still just an Emperor Realm cultivation, and had not yet reached the Open Heaven Realm, so she needed to fall in love with Yang Kai and cut off her emotions to reach a Grand Accomplishment in the Heartless Grand Dao.

But now that she was in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, what was the point of mentioning this?

Qu Hua Shang added, “If Junior Brother becomes my partner, there is no need for you to join Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, since you are now the lord of Void Land, we only need to maintain it in name. If you want to stay in Void Land, you can stay here, or if you want to come to Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, you can do that too.”

Yang Kai looked at her and said, “Is this what you want, Senior Sister, or is this what Yin-Yang Cave Heaven wants?”

Qu Hua Shang lowered her head, twisted her hands around the corners of her clothes, and said softly, “It doesn’t matter whose wish it is, what matters is what Junior Brother thinks.”

Seeing her act this way, Yang Kai was touched to know that Yin-Yang Cave Heaven had not requested this. Rather, it was completely pursued by Qu Hua Shang herself. She wanted to use Yin-Yang Cave Heaven to shield him, even at the expense of her own reputation.

He hurriedly got up and bowed, “Senior Sister’s good intentions, this Junior Brother has received them, but… I am only one step away. If I can’t take this step, my Dao Heart will forever be obscured, and even if I achieve the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, I am afraid that it will become difficult to continue in the future.”

Hearing this, Qu Hua Shang sighed. Although she had expected it, she was still a little disappointed to hear Yang Kai say this. She raised her head and said with a smile, “Senior Sister admires Junior Brother’s firm will in the pursuit of the Martial Dao. I will be stationed in this Star City in the future, so maybe I will come visit you in your Void Land from time to time. I hope it won’t be too troublesome when the time comes.”

Yang Kai laughed, “I’d like nothing more, how could it be troublesome?”

Qu Hua Shang stood up, “Then I’ll say take my leave first. I’ll return when matters related to the Dao Temple have been settled.”

Yang Kai got up to send her off, and at the same time summoned Bian Yu Qing to accompany her to the Governor’s Residence to help her choose the location for the Dao Temple.

...

Once the arrangements were made, Yang Kai entered retreat once more.

However, before he could start cultivating, he noticed that the isolation barrier had been touched and frowned. He opened the barrier, and Bian Yu Qing walked in from the outside, “Sect Master!”

“Has Qu Hua Shang’s business arrangements been completed?” Yang Kai asked.

Bian Yu Qing said, “Yes, the arrangements have been made.” As she spoke, she took out a wooden box and handed it to Yang Kai.

“What is this?” Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

Bian Yu Qing looked at him with a puzzled face, “Isn’t this something that Sect Master left behind? Some disciples saw it while cleaning the reception hall, and thought it was something that the Sect Master had accidentally dropped, so they handed it over to this Mistress.”

Yang Kai laughed, “How could I have left something behind, it should be Senior Sister Qu’s. Go and return the box to her.”

Bian Yu Qing replied, “Sect Master, if this was really Lady Qu’s, then it can’t be sent back, since this should be her gift to you. She is a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, how could she have taken out and then forgotten a box for no reason?”

When Yang Kai heard this, he pondered over it. After Qu Hua Shang entered the reception hall, he hadn’t seen her take out this box. Only after she left did a disciple discover it, which made it apparent that Qu Hua Shang had left it behind on purpose.

Her cultivation was now much higher than Yang Kai’s, so if she wanted to do something covertly, he would not be able to discover it. If it wasn’t for the disciples who saw it while cleaning the reception hall, it would not have been found.

“The contents of this box should be very valuable!” Bian Yu Qing casually stated.
