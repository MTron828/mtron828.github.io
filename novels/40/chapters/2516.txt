The victory of this battle was too odd.

Gu Shan clearly felt that his attack was mostly resolved by Asura Girl, and the remaining power was not sufficient to kill her. Moreover, even though there were fragments of clothes in the arena, there was no trace of blood.

If she were really blown to pieces by him, there should be at least some residual bits of blood and flesh.

But in reality, nothing else was left.

[That girl is not dead!] Gu Shan concluded in his heart.

[But if she is not dead, where could she be? Is it really like what the audience said and she is hiding somewhere, preparing to ambush me?] Considering all this, Gu Shan’s face changed drastically and he hurriedly searched around, but he could not find even the shadow of Asura Girl.

After a long time, Asura Girl did not appear, only then did Gu Shan accept the victory cheer for him with a puzzled face.

……

Ten thousand kilometres outside of Purple Mountain City, Yang Kai and Zhang Ruo Xi sat on his wooden boat, flying away as fast as lightning.

After Gu Shan unleashed his final skill in the last fight, Yang Kai stepped into the arena and brought Zhang Ruo Xi out.

The outcome was already decided, there was no need to carry on the fight. Gu Shan was already spent, while Zhang Ruo Xi was not in jeopardy. Zhang Ruo Xi would have easily destroyed Gu Shan in the next move.

Yang Kai was already in the Emperor Realm, and with his proficiency in the Dao of Space, the cultivators in Purple Mountain City were not sharp or strong enough to notice anything when he came and went, which led to the illusion of Zhang Ruo Xi being blown to pieces.

After being taken out of the arena, Zhang Ruo Xi’s ferocious aura immediately dissipated and she became extremely well-behaved, sitting quietly on the boat, constantly looking at Yang’s back with a timid look, afraid that he would be mad at her due to her previous reckless behaviour.

She did not know what was wrong with her. She had never fought with people before, but after she stepped into the arena, she was filled with passion. Every bit of pain on her body and every drop of her blood she shed brought her an incomparable satisfaction. It seemed that fighting with people had become her favourite hobby.

She regretted it every time she returned from the arena, knowing that she needed to follow her Master obediently and not fight with others. She even secretly warned herself that she must not go to the Rising Dragon Arena again.

But the next day, she could not resist the temptation and went out again, heading to the arena with the identity of ‘Asura Girl’, accepting more and more challenges from the cultivators, and beating all of them. She took great joy in fighting with others. Victory or defeat was not what she cared about, what she relished was the heat of battle itself.

She was a little afraid of herself and felt that there was a devil sealed within her heart.

“Do you like to use swords?” Yang Kai broke the silence with a question, without looking back. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Hm?” Zhang Ruo Xi jumped, but she quickly reacted, “I don’t know.”

“I noticed that you favoured a sword hand style during your battle with Gu Shan, and your body released a strong Sword Intent unconsciously,” Yang Kai paused for a while, and continued, “Have you ever used a sword artifact before?”

“No,” Zhang Ruo Xi shook her head slowly, and murmured, “I have never used any offensive artifacts before.”

“That’s strange,” Yang Kai revealed a dubious look. Although Zhang Ruo Xi was not proficient in using her sword hand, it was still exceptionally powerful, and the Sword Intent unleashed from her body was genuine. A cultivator couldn’t have such power unless one immersed themselves in swordsmanship for many years.

Among the Masters Yang Kai knew, Chen Wen Hao of Heavenly Martial Holy Land had the strongest Sword Intent. He possessed the Emperor Artifact Flowing Water Sword, and his Three Thousand Sword Dao still appeared vividly in Yang Kai’s mind.

Yang Kai occasionally used a sword too, like the broadsword, Myriads Sword, but this was not his strength. All the tricks that he performed were the Secret Techniques which paired with the Myriads Sword itself, and they were incomparable to Chen Wen Hao’s techniques.

Nevertheless, Zhang Ruo Xi’s Sword Intent seemed natural and powerful. She was like a piece of unpolished jade, but once her full potential had been developed, the greatness that she could bloom into would absolutely be terrifying.

Suddenly, Yang Kai recalled a specific memory.

During Zhang Ruo Xi’s Great Realm breakthroughs, a giant figure of a woman would always emerge behind her. Yang Kai had no idea who this woman was, but every time she opened her mouth, she absorbed the Heavenly Manifestation from Zhang Ruo Xi’s breakthrough and surprisingly, it made Zhang Ruo Xi’s breakthrough effortless.

When that phantom woman appeared, she was holding an exceedingly astounding and broad sword in her hands.

[Perhaps, the reason why she has Sword Intent and instinctively used a sword hand has something to do with that phantom?]

Although it was just a guess, Yang Kai believed it must be the case.

Since Zhang Ruo Xi liked to use swords, Yang Kai thought that he should hand over the Myriads Sword to her.

The broadsword that was held in the hands of the giant woman phantom was similar to the Myriads Sword, so Zhang Ruo Xi would like it.

It was just that… the Myriads Sword did not belong to Yang Kai. It was an ancestral treasure of the Qin Family in Maplewood City. Old Patriarch Qin made it very clear when he handed over the Myriad Sword to Yang Kai, that he hoped Yang Kai could take care of it for him and return it to Qin Yu when she became an Emperor Realm Master.

Therefore, after a few thoughts, Yang Kai decided not to give Zhang Ruo Xi the sword as he believed that giving away an item that belonged to others was something that went against his principles.

It looked like it was time for Yang Kai to find a broadsword type Emperor Artifact. Among his companions, Liu Yan obtained the Annihilation Thunder Bead, Hua Qing Si wielded the Five-Coloured Spear, and even his Embodiment obtained the Demonic War Hammer. All of them were Emperor Artifacts.

Yang Kai naturally could not be biased.

“Sorry, Sir. Ruo Xi shouldn’t have caused such a big mess without your permission!” Zhang Ruo Xi lowered her head and finally plucked up her courage to admit her mistake.

Yang Kai chuckled, “Why are you sorry? I am not blaming you.”

Zhang Ruo Xi lifted her head in befuddlement, “Sir, are you not angry?”

Yang Kai smiled gently, “Choose your own path and don’t be bothered by what others think, as long as you feel no shame in your heart. Let me ask you, do you feel happy fighting in the arena?”

“I was very happy!” Zhang Ruo Xi nodded her head like chicken pecking rice, without even needing to think about it.

“Then, did you kill anyone?”

Zhang Ruo Xi shook her head, “I just knocked them down every time, but I didn’t kill them.”

“Do you feel guilty?”

Zhang Ruo Xi pondered seriously and shook her head again. “No, they were not as skilled as their opponent yet decided to challenge them in the arena. It was only natural that they were prepared to be defeated. Ruo Xi also went in knowing the risks.”

“That’s right,” Yang Kai nodded, “If you think it was correct, it is correct. There will no doubt be people who point fingers at you and make irresponsible accusations against you in the future. If the advice is reasonable, listen to it humbly and accept it with an open mind; but if they are simply trying to find trouble, just let them bark as much as they want. The key is here…” Yang Kai pointed at his heart.

“Ruo Xi understands!” Zhang Ruo Xi nodded gently, smiling like a flower and cheered, “It is wonderful to travel together with Sir.”

……

After travelling around for half a month, Yang Kai reached the central region of the Eastern Territory.

During the journey, he and Zhang Ruo Xi had travelled across countless mountains and rivers together. While appreciating the local customs, Yang Kai also guided Zhang Ruo Xi in cultivation, making the journey a lot less dull and lonely.

Zhang Ruo Xi’s growth rate was insanely quick. Even though she did not improve much in terms of her cultivation, she made great progress in controlling her strength, which certainly had something to do with her twenty days of battles in the Rising Dragon Arena.

Intense battles could often make one realize one’s own flaws and potential, and further promote their growth.

Zhang Ruo Xi had not only grown stronger, she had also gained more experiences and learned lessons through her previous fights.

During the trip with Yang Kai, she kept recalling the battles in the arena, turning all those accumulated experiences and lessons into nutrients, constantly growing herself.

Yang Kai witnessed this, but he did not comment on it.

One day, Yang Kai suddenly stopped, bringing the boat to a halt in mid-air.

“Sir? What happened?” Zhang Ruo Xi hurriedly asked, and covered the surroundings with her Divine Sense.

She thought there was some danger.

But there was nothing unusual nearby.

When she turned to Yang Kai, she saw that he took out a golden token with a bewildered look, and sent his Divine Sense into it.

The next moment, his face darkened.

Zhang Ruo Xi was so frightened that she dared not to speak. It was her first time seeing Yang Kai this angry since the day she began following him. It was obvious that something serious had happened that maddened Yang Kai.

[What exactly… is that golden token? Why did Sir get so angry after examining it?]

Zhang Ruo Xi was puzzled, but she dared not to question.

Subsequently, Yang Kai immediately spread his terrifying Divine Sense around like a tide, covering a large area in an instant.

After a while, Yang Kai seemed to have discovered something, and with a flicker, he shattered space, bringing Zhang Ruo Xi together with him, the both of them disappearing directly from the spot they stood.

When they reappeared, Zhang Ruo Xi found that she and Yang Kai had arrived at a place an unknown distance away, standing in the void as a group of cultivators were besieging a Monster Beast that resembled both a turtle and a tiger underneath them.

This Monster Beast seemed to be at the peak of the Eleventh-Order, and was rich in Monster Qi. If it was converted to the cultivation of a human cultivator, it would be at the peak of the Dao Source Realm.

There were only three Dao Source Realm cultivators among the crowd, while the rest were just Saint Kings. The three Dao Source Realm cultivators did not really have high cultivations, with only one of them at the Second-Order Dao Source Realm. They seemed to be Elders of some small Sect leading their disciples to come out for training. From a cursory glance, it could not be deduced how they encountered this Monster Beast.

It was common for disciples to train together as a Sect and most of them would have some Elders with higher cultivation travelling with them to provide guidance and protection. If it was not necessary, these Elders would not usually show up.

There was already a torn corpse on the ground, while the remaining cultivators were wounded and had panicked looks on their faces.

Judging from their situation, they seemed to be no match for the Monster Beast.
