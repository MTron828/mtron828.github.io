When that Luan Feng first appeared, Yang Kai was in Clear Jade Mountain.

It could be said that among the cultivators who were able to observe the Luan Feng up close and personal, only Yang Kai had survived, all the others had perished.

As such, Yang Kai was naturally not interested in Kang Si Ran’s proposal.

And so, he declined Kang Si Ran’s invitation. Although Shopkeeper Kang felt it was a pity, he did not say much; after all, not everyone was interested in showing their face to Sir Star Envoy in hopes of somehow currying favour with him. Everyone had their own ambitions and preferences, so Kang Si Ran didn’t force the issue.

Kang Si Ran even somewhat admired Yang Kai’s free and easy disposition, so he simply encouraged him to take a few days to rest before taking his leave.

Yang Kai cleaned himself up and then left Spirit Pill Plaza to return to the secluded home he had rented in Maplewood City.

The next day, a magnificent, extremely large, and luxurious flying ship set out from the City Lord’s Mansion and headed towards Clear Jade Mountain. Emblazoned on the side of this ship was a shining moon symbol.

This was naturally the insignia of the Southern Territory’s Supreme Sect, Star Soul Palace.

All of Maplewood City was simply abuzz at the mere sight.

Yang Kai, on the other hand, ignored all this and went to rent a White Jade Dragon Horse carriage before ordering the coachman to head to a certain street in the west of the city.

Even if Maplewood City was a small, unknown city in the Southern Territory, it still occupied an extremely vast area, and since flying and flight type artifacts were not allowed inside the city, if cultivators wanted to save time on the road, they could only rent one of the White Jade Dragon Horse carriages. These White Jade Dragon Horses were rumoured to have the blood of ancient dragons flowing through their veins, but this bloodline was extremely thin. These Monster Beasts had a gentle temperament and were easy to domesticate while possessing great speed, so they were well suited for pulling carriages.

After just half an hour, Yang Kai arrived at his destination.

Yang Kai paid for the ride before getting off the carriage and moving to a remote alleyway where he took out a set of clothes he had prepared in advance from his Space Ring and donned them. With his face and figure covered by these black robes, Yang Kai walked straight out into the bustling street ahead.

This was the location of the black market in Maplewood City!

Although he had not been in Maplewood City for long, Yang Kai had already inquired about the existence of this black market.

The black market here was a place that could not openly exist, but its existence in this street was essentially condoned by Maplewood City’s City Lord’s Mansion. Here, spoils people obtained after killing others and robbing them, as well as certain other items which could not be sold aboveboard could be found.

There were also many items of unknown origin sold in this place.

The cultivators who streamed in and out of the black market all abided by certain unspoken rules, the most important of which were that no one asked the origin of any item, no one asked for any names, and after transactions were settled, there were no refunds.

In this kind of place, it was easy to find treasures, so it is very popular among Maplewood City’s cultivators and was always crowded.

However, because of the customs here, it was also easy for substandard and counterfeit goods to be mixed in with genuine ones. This was a kind of test of a buyer’s vision and knowledge. If someone was deceived because of their greed or ignorance, they had no one to blame but themselves.

Yang Kai was originally worried that his black robes and covered hat would draw too much attention; after all, hiding one’s appearance was a clear indication that one was up to no good.

But when he entered the street where the black market was located, he found that his worries were unnecessary.

There were many cultivators dressed similarly to him, so Yang Kai was quickly able to relax.

As soon as he entered the street, an old man with shifty eyes quietly came up to him, glancing around, acting all mysterious as he tugged on Yang Kai’s clothes and motioned him over.

“Speak quickly,” Yang Kai said coldly.

“Little Brother, this old master wants to tell you about something good, not something that can be discussed out here in the open; after all, the walls have ears in this place.” As the old man spoke, he glanced around vigilantly, as if someone really was watching.

“Then don’t talk about it,” Yang Kai naturally knew these kinds of people would linger in a place like this, so he didn’t want to waste any time on this old man.

Saying so, he stepped forward and walked off.

“Ah, Little Brother, don’t go!” The old man hurriedly caught up and blocked Yang Kai’s path, gritting his teeth as he said, “Alright, Little Brother seems to be a busy man, so this old master won’t waste your time; here, take a look at this!”

Saying so, he took out a crumpled piece of animal skin from his chest pocket. This animal skin looked very old and was clearly made from some kind of Monster Beast leather. Some subtle energy fluctuations were coming from this animal skin and a series of complex lines crisscrossed its surface, making it look extremely profound.

The old man showed the animal skin paper to Yang Kai quickly before hiding it away in the next instant, speaking with some slight grief in his tone, “This old master will speak frankly, this is a hidden treasure map that has been passed down through this old master’s family for generations. This old master’s ancestors once served Heaven Devouring Great Emperor and this treasure map leads to Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s hidden treasury! This old master’s strength is weak, however, so he is unable to make use of this map. Today, this old master was fortunate enough to see Little Brother and instantly knew he was a man of great destiny, one who would be worthy of obtaining this treasure map! What does little brother think? Will he purchase this map?”

“Heaven Devouring Great Emperor?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

“En!”

“The Great Emperor who cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Law?”

“Who else but him?” The old man looked at Yang Kai with joy, “It turns out that Little Brother even knows about the Heaven Devouring Battle Law. That is a peak-level Secret Art that is not tolerated by Heaven and Earth. Speaking truthfully, this Secret Art is very likely inside the hidden treasury. If Little Brother can obtain this Secret Art, his rise to the Ten Great Emperors will be just around the corner!”

“Hehe, I already know the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, so I am not interested in your hidden treasury. You should find someone else.”

“This old master will sell this big opportunity to Little Brother for just five thousand Source Crystals! Is little brother really willing to pass up such a fortuitous encounter?” The old man shouted from behind towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai didn’t even bother with him anymore.

The old man suddenly put on an angry face and spat, “Smelly brat, if you don’t want to buy it then just say so instead of boasting so shamelessly! Saying he already knows the Heaven Devouring Battle Law; does he take this old master as a fool?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After shouting out loud, the old man muttered to himself, “Is this trick too easy for others to see through...? Should I use a different approach?”

As this old man was worrying he wouldn’t be able to deceive anyone for a few months and would really wind up penniless, he suddenly saw another cultivator walk up the street, a young girl who looked less than twenty years old. This girl was a great beauty with an outstanding figure, but a large crescent-shaped birthmark that covered her right cheek ruined her overall beauty, causing many who saw her to sigh.

The girl was skipping around the street, like a playful spirit, an innocent look covering her face.

Upon seeing this, the old man immediately greeted her with the kindest smile he could muster on his face.

“You... what do you want?” The girl was startled and immediately stepped back from the old man warily.

“Don’t be afraid, Little Girl! This old master has no malicious intent!” The old man smiled more and more kindly.

“Then what do you want to do?” The girl looked the old man up and down, with a trace of instinctive vigilance still apparent in her clear, beautiful eyes.

The old man chuckled while pretending to be mysterious, “This old master seems to share some destiny with this little girl, so he would like to deliver you a big opportunity!”

When the girl heard this, her beautiful eyes brightened and she asked happily, “A big opportunity? What kind of big opportunity? Hurry up and talk about it!”

She was excited from the bottom of her heart as she secretly thought that the legendary stories that Aunty Feng told her when she was a child were true. Opportunities and fortuitous encounters were something real! In those childhood stories, ordinary cultivators would sometimes receive guidance or benefits from mysterious elders, allowing them to soar up into the sky and become supreme existences, worshipped and adored by countless others.

When she was young, she had loved listening to these stories but after coming out for the past half-year, she had not encountered any such situation, causing her to think that her Aunty Feng was simply making them up.

Now, though, there was a mysterious old man who wanted to give himself a big opportunity standing right in front of her! The young girl was so excited that suddenly, in her eyes, the old man who was clearly an old trickster now looked like a powerful hidden master who was stealthily searching for an appropriate inheritor to his legacy in this crowded place!

Now, this old master had seen that she was a peerless genius, one in hundreds of millions, so he had chosen her.

As for his casual... or rather his sloppy appearance, shouldn’t a powerful master who was trying to hide themselves look like this?

“Heh heh heh...” The old man flashed his big yellow teeth as he reached into his chest pocket to take out a crumpled animal skin...

.....

“Grandma, is there a shop that deals in Spirit Pills around here?” Yang Kai stood in front of a stall, looking at the silver-haired, trembling old woman, and asked.

“One for five hundred Source Crystals, they were refined by this old woman personally,” The old woman looked at Yang Kai with a smile on her face and pointed to the pile of odd objects Yang Kai could not even identify in front of her.

Yang Kai frowned and asked again, “I asked if there are any pill shops around here!”

“Oh, if you buy two, this old woman can give you a small discount, just nine hundred Source Crystals,” The old woman raised her hand and swung it lightly, as if she was offering him a great bargain.

“Don’t pretend to be deaf and dumb with me. Do you think I won’t smash your stall?” Yang Kai spat viciously at the old woman in front of him before releasing his Third-Order Origin King aura.

The old woman’s complexion changed and her senility from just now disappeared, her eyes becoming cold and stern as she spat, “Little Brat, don’t you know how to respect your elders? So impolite.”

“A First-Order Origin King pretending to be deaf, do you think I’m a fool?” Yang Kai looked at her contemptuously.

“Go there, don’t block this old woman’s business. These years, business has been getting harder and harder,” The old woman pointed her finger in a certain direction before blinking and restoring her feeble, frail look.

Following the instructions of the old woman, Yang Kai quickly arrived at the door of a shop.

The shop hand here was a normal person, unlike the old women and the old man he had met before, so after seeing Yang Kai, he greeted him enthusiastically before arranging a room for him as well as serving some tea then drawing back.

Yang Kai was not in a hurry, so he waited quietly while tasting the fragrant tea.
