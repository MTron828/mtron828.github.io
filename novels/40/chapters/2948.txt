Picking up Zhu Qing, Yang Kai propped her up against himself before extending two fingers to her wrist and pouring his Emperor Qi into her body to check her condition.

A moment later, Yang Kai’s brows knitted into a frown. The aura inside of Zhu Qing’s body was in disorder, but it was not likely the cause of her injury. Instead, it seemed more like dissonance in her cultivation. It puzzled him and made him wonder what it was that Zhu Qing encountered in the Frozen Earth to end up facing such an odd crisis. She was a member of the Dragon Clan, after all.

In addition, Zhu Qing’s physical condition was also very bad. She must have stayed in the Frozen Earth for too long, causing her vitality to be drained by the cold. Most of her body was astonishingly weak, and if she was not provided proper treatment soon, she could very well die.

Yang Kai did not dare to delay. Releasing his Divine Sense, he quickly found a nearby cave, lifted Zhu Qing up, and sped over.

The cave was probably left by some beast as a pungent smell remained inside, but it had clearly been abandoned for quite some time. From the looks of it, no living creature had visited this place in years.

In order to avoid any unnecessary disturbances during the treatment process, Yang Kai directly summoned the Sealed World Bead and brought Zhu Qing into it.

In an environment that was beautiful and refreshing like a spring day, Yang Kai laid Zhu Qing flat on the ground before taking out a large handful of Spirit Pills from his Space Ring and prying her mouth open, stuffing them in without a second thought.

Zhu Qing’s current situation was a little tricky to deal with. Under the effects of the Frozen Earth’s cold, her physique had been severely corroded, and the Dragon Essence in her body had somehow been thrown into dissonance. So, if she were to be saved, the chill first had to be forced out of her from the inside. Only then would she be able to bring order to the rioting Dragon Essence inside her body.

Most of the pills Yang Kai had on hand were good-quality Spirit Pills, worth millions of High-Rank Source Crystals, but he still stuffed them into her mouth without reservation.

The effects were naturally remarkable. Under Yang Kai’s assistance, the Spirit Pills’ medicinal efficacies soon came into play. As they travelled through Zhu Qing’s limbs and bones, a biting chill gradually seeped out from her pores, the same cold as the one permeating through the Frozen Earth. As it flowed out from her body, the surrounding vegetation soon withered and died.

Gradually, her cold body regained a trace of warmth and her snow-white face also began to show some signs of vitality.

Yang Kai kept on calling out her name and even broke into her Knowledge Sea with his Divine Sense in an attempt to wake her up.

But despite his efforts, Zhu Qing showed not a shred of reaction. It seemed as if she were unable to detect any sensations from the outside world and both her eyes were tightly shut, as if she had already passed on.

Yang Kai could only constantly circulate his Emperor Qi to ease her out of her current danger.

Yang Kai lost track of how long had passed, but the situation never improved. After the medicinal efficacies of the Emperor Pills wore out, the coldness inside Zhu Qing’s body reared its head again. The cold seemed to have a life of its own and was able to divide and multiply within her body. As long as a trace of it remained, it would flare up again.

Yang Kai withdrew his hand and sighed, staring at her exquisite face, and only after a long bout of hesitation did he make up his mind and grabbed something from the void. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

A verdant glow suddenly appeared on his palm, a glow of bright jade green. Even though it was only a glow, it contained an unimaginable surge of vitality.

The essence of the Immortal Tree!

This time, Yang Kai did not pick a leaf of the Immortal Tree directly since there were not many left. If he picked any more, the Immortal tree would become bare. Extracting the essence of the tree this way was sure to cause damage to the Immortal Tree, but Yang Kai did not care because a life was at stake.

“It’s up to your luck now. If this doesn’t bring you back, then your fate must have run its course.” After muttering to himself, Yang Kai pried apart Zhu Qing’s delicate lips and stuffed the green light into her mouth.

The green light turned into a drop of pure green water and rolled down Zhu Qing’s throat, into her belly.

A dazzling light burst out in the next instant as the surface of Zhu Qing’s body was instantly steeped in green, as if glowing moss was growing over it. At the same time, her faint vitality also burst out like a pot of oil splattered over a blazing fire.

*Chi chi chi chi…*

The cold spilled from Zhu Qing’s pores like a flood, melting with the green light on her body, emitting dense sparks of noise.

Yang Kai watched quietly while constantly checking her condition with his Divine Sense.

As time passed, there was less and less cold pouring out of Zhu Qing’s body, and the green light on the surface of her body also gradually weakened. It seemed as if both the cold and the essence of the Immortal Tree were running out of energy.

Meanwhile, Zhu Qing’s flesh also gradually regained its vitality, and her exposed skin was slowly getting rosy.

Yang Kai breathed out a sigh of relief, feeling that his efforts had not been in vain.

When the last trace of coldness was expelled from Zhu Qing’s body, the green light that was enveloping her form also slowly faded away. The essence of the Immortal Tree was not exhausted, but it would now become capital for Zhu Qing when she grew stronger.

She lay on the ground, seemingly able to sleep until the end of time.

Crossing his arms, Yang Kai stood beside her and looked down at her, eyes sweeping from head to toe without restraint. He recalled the time when he held her before and could not help but feel a little excited.

“As expected of a Dragon, such a figure… Tsk tsk.” Yang Kai commented as if he were admiring a work of art. Suddenly, a trace of evil began to surge in his heart. After suffering such a big loss, shouldn’t he collect some interest too?

Anyways, it wasn’t like he’d never done anything frivolous to this girl before. They were strangers in their first meeting, friends the next, and they already knew each other so well by their third meeting. If not for her, he wouldn’t have risked danger to come to the Frozen Earth, much less be swallowed up by the Frozen Tide, now not even sure where he was.

There was even a chance he may not be able to leave here for the rest of his life and would end up with her here to live like birds flying and nestling together, then raising a family of little dragons.

An excited voice was screaming in his mind, telling him to collect interest. He had to collect some interest for all this!

As such a thought sprung up though, Yang Kai realized in shock that his suppressed desires were cropping up again. He hurriedly tried to suppress the urges, but suddenly, he felt an enchantingly soft feeling on his hands.

Looking down, Yang Kai’s mouth couldn’t help but gape in shock.

His two hands had somehow ended up pressed onto the two great peaks on Zhu Qing’s chest. It was exactly that lofty softness and amazing elasticity that made it impossible for him to kneed and massage these mountains a few times.

His nostrils flared up, and Yang Kai could feel the blood boiling in his body. The quiet voice in his mind now began screaming loudly. Eyes locked below Zhu Qing’s slender and fair neck, he gulped. Just like a traveller walking in the desert for months and finally coming across an oasis of fresh water, he wished for nothing more than to dive in.

It was at that moment that the woman in front of him suddenly opened her eyes and stared at Yang Kai with a blank face.

Four eyes suddenly met, and Yang Kai felt as if he had been drenched with a pot of cold water from head to toe. He instantly came back to his senses and with his mouth twitching wildly, he smiled in embarrassment and stuttered, “If I told you that this was a misunderstanding, would you believe me?”

Zhu Qing did not have the slightest response as her clear eyes continued to stare blankly at him.

Yang Kai stood up and pondered for a moment with a frown on his brow before, like a dead pig that did not fear boiling water, he puffed up his chest and declared proudly, “Yes, I touched them, so what? It’s not like they’ll fall off if I touch them. Speaking of which, I saved your life! If I hadn’t gone through the trouble of coming to the Frozen Earth to find you and save you from that predicament, you would have lost your life, so just take what happened as me collecting some payment for services rendered and let’s call us even. What do you think?”

Zhu Qing still did not respond.

Yang Kai was annoyed, “Could you at least give me a reaction?!”

As if in response to Yang Kai’s noisy chatter, Zhu Qing finally gave him a response, but it wasn’t quite as Yang Kai expected. She opened her mouth, and a long groan of pain was emitted from her throat, as if she were going to die. Then, her body curled up abruptly while at the same time, an extremely cold aura radiated from her body.

Yang Kai was shocked, “Still no good?”

Seeing this scene, he was worried that even the essence of the Immortal Tree was unable to dispel the coldness that had encroached into Zhu Qing’s body, but he soon realized that something wasn’t right. This was not the Frozen Earth’s cold. Even though it was cold enough, it was different from the cold from the Frozen Earth. They were not from the same source.

Just as Yang Kai was at a loss, a dragon roar erupted, followed by the illusory phantom of a Great Dragon emerging from Zhu Qing’s body.

“Huh?” Yang Kai looked at the Giant Dragon’s manifestation in a daze and wondered if his eyes were playing tricks on him.

Zhu Qing was a Red Dragon from the Dragon Clan, so her Dragon Source should be the same as Zhu Lie’s. If she were to show her true form, then it would definitely be a vibrant red Great Dragon, but now, the one appearing before Yang Kai’s eyes actually turned out to be a crystalline snow-white Dragon’s phantom.

No matter how he looked at it, the Great Dragon looked just like a vivid ice sculpture, a masterpiece without the slightest flaw; however, it was completely different from a Red Dragon. This was an Ice Dragon, and the chill emanating from Zhu Qing’s body was precisely matching this Ice Dragon’s aura.

Yang Kai wondered if he was mistaken. He wondered if Zhu Qing had any twin sisters or something. There could be similarities in appearance, but as Dragons, their Source Strength couldn’t be mistaken.

At that moment, another high-pitched dragon roar erupted.

When Yang Kai looked over, he saw the expected Red Dragon’s phantom emerging, and this second Great Dragon actually came out from Zhu Qing’s body as well.

Yang Kai’s expression changed as all kinds of thoughts flashed through his mind and he instantly understood many things.

“Two Sources?”

There were actually two Sources inside of Zhu Qing’s body, and they were both of different attributes! The Red Dragon that emerged after was clearly Zhu Qing’s own Source, while the Ice Dragon that appeared before that was just an invader. The reason why Zhu Qing’s Dragon Essence was in a state of dissonance was because of the two Source Strengths clashing with each other inside her body.

Even though Yang Kai checked her condition earlier, he overlooked this point, not because he didn’t check carefully enough, but because this Source was hidden too deeply, and with the severe damage to her body, he ended up neglecting it.

No wonder Zhu Qing was still not awake despite her body recovering. It turned out the problem was not with her physical body, but rather with the battle between the two Sources.

The next question, however, was where did this Ice Dragon Source come from?
