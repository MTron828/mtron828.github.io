Yu Ying looked inexplicably surprised, which Yang Kai found extremely strange, “Is there something wrong with that?”

Yu Ying excitedly explained, “I heard rumours that the Shattered Star Sea is the best place for Star Masters to seek opportunity because their speed of refining Source Strength is far greater than that of others. In the past, I used to think that it was just a lie, but now, it seems those rumours are indeed true. Your speed of refining is much faster than I expected!”

Yang Kai curiously asked, “Do Star Masters really get to enjoy such benefits?”

“Senior Brother Feng, don’t you know?”

Yang Kai shook his head and replied, “I have been alone since I came in. And I have been refining the Star Sources like this. I thought that it was the same for everyone.”

“How could that be? The same?” Yu Ying screamed, “If you let this Junior Sister refine the Star Source here alone, I would take at least two months!”

“That long!?” Yang Kai looked as if he had been greatly taken aback.

Yu Ying looked at Yang Kai with a fiery hot gaze and explained, “Senior Brother, do you know how amazing you are? I guess it should be true for Senior Brother Yin as well!”

Yang Kai agreed, nodding, “Senior Brother is stronger than me. Naturally, he is more amazing than me.”

While saying this, Yang Kai sneered in his heart. Yin Le Sheng might also be a Star Master and may enjoy some benefits, but it was impossible for him to refine it this quickly without the Star Refining Art. At best, he would be a little faster than others.

It was the Star Refining Art that made the Shattered Star Sea a walk in the park.

“Senior Brother Fen really has a bright future.” Yu Ying looked at Yang Kai with a fiery gaze. She knew that Yang Kai, like Yin Le Sheng, came from the Grand Desolation Star Field and his aptitude was good. So, he most likely would achieve high success and status someday. However, after learning that he was in fact a Star Master, Yu Ying immediately understood that the Feng De before her was a second Yin Le Sheng.

If she could recruit such a person into the Netherworld Sect by herself, her status would also rise. She would be greatly appreciated by the Sect’s upper echelon. And when her Brother Feng’s cultivation reached the top, who would dare to provoke her?

In a flash, Yu Ying made a decision. She secretly made up her mind that she would find a chance to occupy her Senior Brother Feng’s heart and body so that only she could use him.

“Junior Sister Yu is too polite. Since the Star Source here is already finished, why don’t we set off.” Yang Kai’s heart was preoccupied with Yin Le Sheng, so he didn’t want to waste time chatting with her.

Yu Ying agreed with a nod, “Good.” Saying so, she flicked her wrist and summoned a small flying artifact. This artifact looked extremely delicate but the energy fluctuations emanating from it weren’t weak. Surprisingly, it was a Dao Source High-Grade flight type artifact, on par with the wooden boat Yang Kai used.

Yang Kai was secretly shocked as he thought to himself, [This Yu Ying is indeed an elite of one of the top Sects in the Star Boundary.] To his surprise, a mere Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator like Yu Ying had easily taken out such a precious artifact.

“Senior Brother Feng, why don’t you join me?” Yu Ying winked at Yang Kai and appeared shy before inviting in a sweet voice, “We will need to travel for a long time, so we won’t be lonely if we go together.”

Yang Kai’s skin crawled as he shuddered. He didn’t want to stay in the same room with her, but at this point, it seemed too inappropriate to refuse. So after a moment of pondering, he could only choke down his disgust and agree, “Of course.”

Yu Ying invited with a smile, “Senior Brother Feng, please come in.”

While speaking, the hatch of the flying shuttle opened.

The two entered one after another.

After entering, Yang Kai found that the space inside the flying artifact wasn’t that big. Besides a bridge from which to control the artifact, there was only a bedroom; however, the interior of the artifact was luxuriously decorated by Yu Ying and was filled with a luxurious fragrance that lingered at the tip of Yang Kai’s nose.

Who knows how many people she had invited into her shuttle. In any case, Yang Kai didn’t like this environment at all.

Yu Ying appeared bashful as her eyes were filled with spring, as if she was expecting something amazing to happen.

Yang Kai didn’t wait for her to speak and simply stated, “Junior Sister Yu, I have been fighting a lot of people recently, making me exhaust a lot of my Source Qi. So, I will have to use Junior Sister’s bedroom. I will recuperate for the time being and take your place after a few days!”

After having said this, Yang Kai immediately walked into the only bedroom, closed the door, and sat down cross-legged.

Yu Yin stood there blankly; it was obvious as to what she was thinking. After a good while, she let out a snort before she turned around to control the artifact.

Over the next few days, Yang Kai lived very cautiously and bitterly.

Yu Ying always came up with ways to tease him, harass him, and kept pestering him, hoping he would give in to her. If he didn’t need Yu Ying to search for Yin Le Sheng, Yang Kai would have already slapped this shameless woman to death.

In any case, having been with her for so many days, Yang Kai knew there wasn’t anything decent about Yu Ying.

Yang Kai spent most of his time in retreat, inside her bedroom. Except for replacing Yu Ying to pilot the shuttle, Yang Kai didn’t come out, so Yu Ying never found a chance to ‘further’ their relationship.

Occasionally, they would find some shattered stars or asteroids with Source Strength along the way. Naturally, the two would not miss them.

Whenever they refined this Source Strength though, Yang Kai would always use the Star Refining Art with all his strength, resulting in little benefit for Yu Ying. Because of this, Yu Ying couldn’t help but grumble a little. She felt that this Feng De wasn’t generous enough as whenever they encountered something good, he would unceremoniously snatch it all, leaving nothing for her.

However, Yu Ying didn’t dare to not give Yang Kai face. First, Yang Kai’s cultivation was higher, and second, she also hoped that Yang Kai would shelter and take care of her after entering the Netherworld Sect. So, even though she was extremely dissatisfied, she still didn’t grumble in front of Yang Kai, only cursing him in secret.

But oblivious to her, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense had been paying attention to her movements while he was in retreat, so he knew all about her sentiment. He also understood how evil she was.

Today, Yang Kai, who was in retreat, suddenly opened his eyes as he sensed some quickly approaching Star Seal fluctuations. Star Seal fluctuations meant that a cultivator was approaching, but he had no idea how many there were because he could only sense the existence of the cultivators whose Star Seals were lower than his. If the Star Seal level was the same or higher than his, he couldn’t sense them.

Considering all this, Yang Kai sent a message to Yu Ying, “Junior Sister Yu, some people are approaching us.”

A bored Yu Ying was piloting the shuttle, but the moment she heard this, she immediately asked in surprise, “Where are they and how many of them are there?”

Judging by how ignorant she looked, obviously, she hadn’t noticed the ones approaching, which meant that the Star Seals of the people coming were all on the same level as hers’ or higher.

“To the east, as for how many, there are at least three of them!” Because Yang Kai could only sense the fluctuations of three Star Seals, he was certain that there were at least three approaching. While speaking to this point, he paused and then added, “They have increased their speed. They are rushing towards us.”

Yu Ying was greatly shocked after hearing this, but just as she was about to accelerate and leave this place, a streak of light appeared in her sight. In that fleeting moment, the streak of light had arrived not too far away from the shuttle and came to a halt.

Immediately afterward, five figures suddenly appeared in that location.

Yang Kai was secretly surprised because he could only sense the fluctuations of three Star Seals, but now, there were five people. In other words, two of them had six-pointed Star Seals at least.

Meanwhile, when Yu Ying saw these five figures, her pretty face went pale and she nervously gulped, as if she was very afraid of them.

[It’s too late to run at this point, and any rash move might cause a negative chain reaction. Judging by these people’s attitudes, it seems that they were targeting us from the start. Who knows whether this is a blessing or curse.] In a flash, Yu Ying felt extremely uneasy.

“Who are these people?” Yang Kai suddenly appeared beside her and asked.

Yu Ying’s pretty face slightly paled as she replied, “They are disciples of Brahma Holy Land. Brahma Holy Land is also a top Sect of the Eastern Territory; our Netherworld Sect is just slightly weaker than theirs.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Yang Kai asked again, “And the relation between yours and their Sect isn’t very good, right?”

Yu Ying smiled bitterly as she agreed, “It isn’t that bad, but there is still some small friction between the two Sects, the same as with all disciples from top Sects.”

Yang Kai lightly nodded before he asked, pointing at two particular individuals, “Those two should be extremely strong!”

Yu Ying glanced at him in surprise and replied, “Those two are the Holy Sons of Brahma Holy Land, so they are naturally extremely strong. In my Sect, only a few Senior Brothers can compete with them.”

“Holy Sons?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

“I don’t know what they are doing here. Senior Brother Feng, please don’t say anything, I will deal with them,” Yu Ying nervously exhorted. She was afraid that Yang Kai would ignorantly offend them, dooming them.

“Good,” Yang Kai nodded.

At that moment, one of the five suddenly shouted, “Get out!”

Yu Ying had a bitter taste in her mouth as she reluctantly opened the shuttle hatch and went out.

Yang Kai followed closely behind her. At this point, it was meaningless to hide as the opposite party’s Divine Senses were constantly scanning the shuttle. They must have discovered him a long time ago.

After stepping out of the shuttle, Yu Ying politely cupped her fist and gently greeted, “Yu Ying greets Senior Brother Zhang Hao and Senior Brother Zhang Xian!”

The two called Zhang Hao and Zhang Xian should be the two Holy Sons of Brahma Holy Land, the ones Yu Ying was afraid of. Both of them were peak Dao Source Realm Masters and seemed extremely powerful. As for the remaining three, they were only in the Second-Order Dao Source Realm, so Yu Ying wasn’t too afraid of them.

Zhang Hao, who looked a little angry, narrowed his eyes and coldly glared at her before stating, “I was wondering who it was, so it’s you, you slut!”

He didn’t show the slightest bit of politeness when he directly called Yu Ying a slut. Obviously, he knew about Yu Ying’s infidelity and lasciviousness.

After all, both of them were disciples of top Sects in the Eastern Territory, so they had some intelligence about one another. What’s more, Yu Ying was extremely famous throughout the Eastern Territory for her debauchery.

Zhang Xian, on the other hand, glanced at Yang Kai with a meaningful gaze before sarcastically commenting, “In the short time I haven’t seen you, you have already changed your man. Yu Ying, you have really opened my eyes!”
