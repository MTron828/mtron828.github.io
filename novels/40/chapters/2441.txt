Yu Ying lightly bit her cherry red lips and pitifully asked, “Senior Brothers, why are you slandering me as soon as we meet? How did this Junior Sister offend you? Senior Brother Feng and I share a pure and innocent relationship. Senior Brothers, please don’t soil my reputation.”

While speaking, she looked at Yang Kai with some worry, as if she was afraid that he would come to know of her past.

“Pure and innocent!?” Zhang Xian’s eyes immediately widened, stunned. He was rooted on the spot while the four other disciples of Brahma Holy Land also looked as if they had seen a ghost.

After a while, the five suddenly laughed out loud in unison., their voices rampant and filled with sarcasm.

Suddenly, they stopped laughing as Zhang Hao stated with a cold look on his face, “That’s the funniest joke I have ever heard.”

Zhang Xian also added, “A man staying with you in a bedroom and still remaining pure and innocent? I’m afraid such a man must be one that has yet to be born!”

Yu Ying’s face turned red and blue. Even if she was fickle and lascivious, she found it a little hard to take it when it was said straight to her face. She glanced at Yang Kai and defended herself, “Senior Brother Feng, don’t listen to their nonsense. This Junior Sister isn’t that kind of person.”

Yang Kai said, nodding, “I know.”

But he also sneered in his heart. He had pretty much figured out her nature over the time he was with her. [What’s going on in her mind? She is still pretending to be innocent and explaining herself to me even at this point?]

Yu Ying, seeing Yang Kai’s indifferent look, was a little bit annoyed in her heart and secretly blamed the Brahma Holy Land disciples for being meddlesome. But since she was weaker than them, she didn’t dare to be angry. All she could do was cast a pitiful look and defend herself, “Senior Brothers, did you stop this Junior Sister just to humiliate her? If that’s the case, then you have succeeded. This Junior Sister… will take her leave.”

“You want to leave? Did you ask me yet?” Zhang Hao shouted aloud.

“Senior Brothers, what do you want?” Yu Ying’s heart started pounding. Seeing Zhang Hao and his group aiming at her, it was quite obvious that they weren’t here for a chat.

Zhang Xian coldly glared at Yu Ying and asked, snorting, “Cheap slut, let me ask you, where is our Junior Brother Deng Yong now?”

When she heard this, Yu Ying’s expression slightly changed; however, she hid it very quickly as she forced a smile and stated, “Senior Brother Zhang Xian, why are you asking me this? Shouldn’t you know where Deng Yong is? Why are you asking this Junior Sister? I haven’t seen him.”

“You still dare to lie!?” Zhang Hao’s eyes flickered with a cold gleam as he shouted, “Junior Brother Deng Yong clearly died at your hands.”

Panic-stricken, Yu Ying defended herself, “Why would Senior Brother Zhang Hao think that? I and Deng Yong have no past grudges or grievances. Even if I ran into him, why would I kill him? Not to mention, Deng Yong is stronger than me. Junior Sister is powerless to kill him even if I wanted to. Senior Brother Zhang Hao, don’t slander me.”

“You are still trying to give excuses!” Zhang Hao grit his teeth, his burning with fury as he glared at Yu Ying and coldly snorted, “Since you are being so stubborn, I let you understand! The Scattered Soul Seal of Junior Brother Deng Yong is clearly branded on you. We tracked you down by sensing this Scattered Soul Seal. Now, what else do you have to say!”

Yu Ying’s face suddenly paled.

Zhang Xian added, “At first, we were still wondering who it was that killed Deng Yong, but it turned out to be you! Deng Yong is indeed stronger than you, but it’s not surprising that he died at your hand; after all, he has always been a lecher!”

Zhang Hao continued, “Although Deng Yong was utterly depraved and deserved to be damned, he was still a Brahma Holy Land disciple. Yu Ying, you will have to pay for his death with your life! However, I will give you a chance to commit suicide here and now rather than suffer at our hands.”

The two of them had directly pronounced Yu Ying’s death, draining Yu Ying’s pretty face of its blood, causing her tender body to tremble.

At this moment, Yang Kai had already noticed a hidden Soul Imprint somewhere on Yu Ying’s body. Obviously, it was left by this Deng Yong before his death. It was ridiculous that Yu Ying had been unaware of it, causing her to be caught by the disciples of Brahma Holy Land. Now, she couldn’t justify herself even if she wanted to.

Yang Kai had been wondering why the five Brahma Holy Land disciples would come straight at them and block him and Yu Ying, but now it seemed that it was because of the Scattered Soul Seal.

It was unclear when Yu Ying had killed Deng Yong, but she must have done so within this year.

Yang Kai was secretly annoyed. He followed Yu Ying just so that he could find Yin Le Sheng, nothing more, nothing less. He had never expected such a thing to happen, and worse, he couldn’t just ignore it either. If he didn’t do anything, Yu Ying would die for sure, and all his hard work and perseverance would go to waste.

So, whether he wanted to or not, he had to save Yu Ying.

“Still not acting?” Zhang Hao, seeing Yu Ying stalling, he couldn’t help but shout, “Think about it, if you force us to do it, you won’t die even if you want to!”

Yu Ying’s face turned paler as she grit her teeth and stepped back as she tenderly shouted, “This is Senior Brother Feng De from my Sect. If you have anything to say, talk to him!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

When she saw that things weren’t in her favour, she directly pushed Yang Kai out, wanting to use him as a shield and not making any qualms about it.

“Feng De?” Zhang Hao narrowed his eyes as he indifferently glanced at Yang Kai, “Where did this waste pop out from? I’ve never heard of him!”

Regarding Netherworld Sect, any Dao Source Realm cultivator who could compete with the Holy Sons of their Sect was well known, so since he had never heard of Feng De, it meant he was just a normal disciple, not someone they needed to care about.

“Boy, are you going to stand up for this slut? You still have time to think it out!” Zhang Xian looked at Yang Kai and sneered.

Yang Kai remained calm while he was filled with irritation, using this opportunity to vent slightly, “Junior Sister Yu, since you called me Senior Brother, then this Feng naturally can’t sit back and watch. If you want to kill her, you have to pass through this Feng first!”

Yu Ying, who was hiding behind him, had her eyes brightened immediately. She hadn’t expected his response would be so bold and responsible; after all, he wasn’t a Netherworld Sect disciple and they were just acquaintances. If he fled at this moment, it would be understandable. But he didn’t do so.

[This guy is really stupid!] Yu Ying sneered in her heart.

However, if Feng De kept them busy for a while, she may have a chance to escape. As for whether Feng De could survive or not, she didn’t care, her life was most important.

[Unfortunately, I can’t bring him to Netherworld Sect, but who would have thought that he was this unlucky?]

Yu Ying secretly made plans in her heart. She had already taken the posture to escape at a moment’s notice. Although her stance was quite well concealed, it couldn’t escape Yang Kai’s notice.

He sneered in his heart seeing this. Yu Ying was as sinister and vicious as could be. If he was really Feng De, he might have been sold out by her already. Unfortunately for her, even with all her schemes, what was the point if they are so obvious?

“Alright, since you want to die, then I will fulfil your wish!” Zhang Hao looked rough and was clearly someone with a fiery temper. He was undoubtedly irritated by Yang Kai, so as he spoke, he summoned a war hammer into his hands. This artifact gave off terrifying energy fluctuations as he raised it up high and smashed it towards Yang Kai and Yu Ying, showing no mercy.

In a flash, the surrounding space froze, and it seemed as if the void was about to collapse. The next moment, an enormous hammer image appeared above Yang Kai and Yu Ying, covering them entirely.

Even though this move was powerful, it was nothing in Yang Kai’s eyes. If he wanted, he could easily wipe out these five disciples of Brahma Holy Land.

However, he didn’t want to expose his true abilities here, especially in front of Yu Ying.

So, he pretended to be panic-stricken. He didn’t use any Secret Techniques or summon any artifacts, instead just wielding his fists madly towards the giant hammer.

*Hong Hong Hong…*

The next moment, the void shook as powerful shockwaves spread in all directions.

Yang Kai spurted a mouthful of blood and retreated ten metres, as if he couldn’t bear it.

Taking advantage of this momentum, Yang Kai promptly jumped back and fled towards the depths of the void, without even looking back. Before fleeing, he didn’t forget to shout, “Junior Sister Yu, quickly run!”

At this moment, Yu Ying had already used some kind of Secret Technique and her figure vanished into a plume of smoke, flying off into the distance like a gust of wind. Judging by her appearance, it seemed that she had already decided to run when Yang Kai and Zhang Hao clashed, having no intention of helping Yang Kai.

Hearing Yang Kai’s shout, she hurriedly said, “Senior Brother Feng, you escape as well! You will definitely die if they catch you!”

Her escape technique was very peculiar and it seemed that she was burning up all of her Source Qi to use it. Such consumption was terrifying, but it made her move extremely fast.

Yang Kai took a glance and hurriedly bit the tip of his tongue, pretending to spurt out a mouthful of Blood Essence before catching up with Yu Ying.

Zhang Hao and his group stood gawking on their spot, dumbfounded.

When Yang Kai took a brave and senseless stance, they thought that they had encountered someone with some backbone. However, they hadn’t expected Yang Kai to spurt blood after clashing just once with Zhang Hao and now even burned his Blood Essence to escape.

“That guy… he’s just an embroidered pillow!” Zhang Xian teasingly remarked.

“Hmph, he should count himself lucky for running so quickly, otherwise, he would have definitely died without a burial!” Zhang Hao added, furious. He then put away his hammer artifact and ordered, waving his hand, “Follow them. No matter what, they have to die to avenge Junior Brother Deng Yong!”

The others nodded in agreement as they followed closely after the two Holy Sons, Zhang Hao and Zhang Xian, in pursuit of Yang Kai and Yu Ying.

Yu Ying and that guy named Feng De had resorted to such extreme means to escape. One using such a high consumption Secret Technique and the other, using his Blood Essence; however, both methods could not be maintained for long! Once enough time passed, they would definitely be in a greatly weakened state.

At that time, they wouldn’t have to worry about anything when killing them.

On the other side, Yang Kai and Yu Ying, who had fled into the depths of the void, didn’t dare to look back.

Having ‘burned his Blood Essence’, Yang Kai appeared to be in a sorry state. But in fact, everything was under his control as he simply hadn’t done such a thing.

After flying for a while, Yang Kai finally shouted, “Junior Sister Yu, you have to dispel the Scattered Soul Seal on your body as quickly as possible, otherwise we won’t be able to escape.”

[This woman is really stupid, those two Holy Sons just mentioned this but even now she hasn’t thought of getting rid of it!] If she had no relation to finding Xiao Xiao, Yang Kai would have never reminded her.
