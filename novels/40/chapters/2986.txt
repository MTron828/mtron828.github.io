In the group of four, Yang Kai was in the lead with the black puppy in his arms, whereas the Zhu sister and brother duo were in the middle, with Li Jiao bringing up the rear, though the distance between them did not exceed more than three steps each.

The surrounding landscape was completely invisible. Even their Divine Sense couldn’t spread more than two hundred metres. Nonetheless, Yang Kai wasn’t worried about going in the wrong direction. He just needed to walk in the direction from where the Cold Demon Qi was blowing.

After a day, they finally noticed signs of an anomaly up ahead.

Powerful Space Principle fluctuations were radiating from that direction. Yang Kai was greatly excited and cried in a loud voice, “We are almost there.”

Hearing what he said, all three of them turned serious, especially Li Jiao. The Emperor Qi emanating from him was extremely fierce and a voice was ringing in his mind, [As long as I can leave this damned place, I’m going straight back to Fire Dragon Palace and not coming out!]

Thinking so, his blood was pumping as he was filled with expectation.

The air around the black puppy became colder and colder as a thick layer of frost covered its body. Its big wide open mouth also became smaller and smaller. Obviously, it was approaching its limit.

About a thousand metres ahead, there seemed to be the source of the Cold Demon Qi. The whistling Yin Winds that were found everywhere on the Yin Wind Mountain were nowhere near as terrifying as they were here.

The last stretch was always the hardest to cross. Yang Kai discovered this place the last time he came here and knew that this should be the place where the exit was. The black puppy had grown a lot stronger over the last few days, so he reckoned that he should be able to bring himself and the others to the exit.

Sink or swim, it all depended on this moment.

Yang Kai constantly whispered words of encouragement in the black puppy’s ears.

The black puppy could obviously understand everything and probably knew that everyone’s life and death were tied to its performance. Suddenly, like divine providence, a muffled roar came from its throat as its small mouth suddenly became bigger again.

All the oncoming Cold Demon Qi was swallowed by it.

Immediately, the pressure on everyone sharply dropped! Yang Kai promptly sped up his footsteps.

Seven hundred metres!

Five hundred metres!

Three hundred metres!

With just one hundred metres left, Yang Kai finally saw what the exit looked like. At first glance, it looked like a rift in space. Furthermore, pure and rich Demon Qi along with an extremely cold aura that could freeze anything and everything in the world was billowing out from that tear, converging in one place.

The rift was several dozen metres long and stretched across the top of Yin Wind Mountain, weaving up and down, continuous and ever-changing, looking extremely unstable.

Logically, such a gap could not possibly continue to exist for a long time because the World Principles would automatically repair it.

But the Revolving World was quite peculiar, located in the Void Crack between the Demon Realm and the Star Boundary. It wouldn’t be surprising if the pulling force of the two Great Worlds were what made a crack appear in the Revolving World and kept it open.

If someday, the pulling force of a certain Great World on the Revolving World suddenly grew stronger, it might tear the entire Revolving World to pieces. At that time, all the creatures living here would surely perish.

A rift like this was inappropriate for anyone to pass through as they wished, because the wild fluctuations in Space Principles could have unpredictable effects on those who tried to cross it. One might pass through without any trouble, or might be ripped apart the instant they tried, it was completely up to luck.

If one wanted to cross such a rift, one would first need to stabilize it to create a safe entrance.

As all kinds of thoughts flashed across Yang Kai’s mind, he had already anticipated this situation and had long come up with a plan. He then shouted, “I will stabilize this exit, but I won’t be able to hold it for too long, three breaths at most. You must quickly follow me so that you don’t get lost in the Void Crack!”

“En!” Zhu Qing nodded while Zhu Lie and Li Jiao also turned serious; their nerves were taut and they were ready to act at a moment’s notice.

When it came to the Void Crack and anything else related to the Dao of Space, they were completely helpless regardless of their great strength. They could only depend on Yang Kai at this moment.

Yang Kai’s face also turned serious as Space Principles flared from his figure. Although he was standing on the same spot, it gave the impression that he was sometimes far and sometimes near as space warped around him.

“Open!”

With a loud shout, the invisible Space Principles condensed, creating a wave visible to the naked eye which shot straight towards the shifting Void Crack.

In an instant, an invisible gate seemed to have been erected at a certain location on the rift, stabilizing that small piece of it.

“Qing’er, hurry!” Yang Kai shouted.

Zhu Qing, who had prepared beforehand, rushed into the invisible gate and disappeared in the blink of an eye. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Zhu Lie followed right on her tail without a word.

Li Jiao was the last to make a move, and in light of his strength, he should be able to rush in if there was no accident, but the moment he left the black puppy’s protection range, he became completely stiff. He was unable to circulate his Emperor Qi, and could only watch the entrance just before him helplessly as he stood rooted on the spot.

His eyes bulged and were almost ready to pop out as his blood went cold and almost froze as panic and despair gripped his heart and soul.

He knew that he was finished this time. If he missed this opportunity, he would never be able to leave this place and would freeze to death in the end.

Panic-stricken and anxious, all he could do was cast a begging look at Yang Kai.

“Waste!” Yang Kai angrily cursed. He hadn’t expected that Li Jiao would freeze at the critical moment. He wanted to leave him behind but he still reached out and grabbed him before quickly rushing towards the crack, holding the black puppy with his other hand.

The three breaths were already over and the stabilized part of the rift had begun to collapse.

Yang Kai had no choice but to push his Space Principles once again, forming a semi-safe region in front of himself before disappearing into it.

The howls of the wind disappeared all of a sudden and their surroundings turned completely quiet and calm. There was no light, nor any World Energy here, only nothingness.

Arriving at such a mysterious and silent place from the howling environment before would make anyone a little uneasy.

In this place, only Divine Sense was of some use.

“Qing’er!” Yang Kai promptly shouted but no voice could propagate here. Fortunately, he sensed Zhu Qing’s aura and immediately threw Li Jiao down and came to Zhu Qing’s side, pulling her into his arms.

“Are you okay?” Yang Kai asked via Divine Sense.

“I’m alright!” Zhu Qing replied. She was the first to charge into the rift, so naturally, nothing would happen to her, but Yang Kai’s concern still filled her with warmth as she asked, “Is this the Void Crack?”

“That’s right, this is the Void Crack!”

It wasn’t the first time Yang Kai had been to this place. The Void Crack was everywhere, and one could enter it from anywhere. Although it was similar in all places, it was unimaginably vast and for most, no matter how strong they were, such a place was extremely dangerous. Once someone was cast into the Void Crack, he or she might become lost here and never escape for the rest of their life.

Only someone proficient in the Dao of Space was qualified to traverse this place, and they were only qualified, far from being able to leisurely stroll around.

At this time, Zhu Lie and Li Jiao also converged on him. Zhu Lie was still good and fine, but Li Jiao was trembling as he had been almost frozen just now; fear still lingering on his face.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense surged as he warned them, “There are many space turbulences in the Void Crack that can swallow up and sweep one away, or teleport them to some random location. If you sense something strange, don’t try to investigate out of curiosity, just move as far away from it as possible.”

“Palace Master Yang is right, I will follow your orders here,” Li Jiao nodded his agreement without a moment of hesitation.

In this situation, even if Yang Kai farted, he would breathe it in gratefully. He had no choice. After having owed him so many times, including being rescued just now, Li Jiao had no choice but to pin his hopes on Yang Kai if he wanted to make it back to the Star Boundary. If he couldn’t count on him, who could he count on?

“It’s also easy to get lost here. In this place, a momentary lapse is all that is required to lose contact even if you are just arm’s length away, so I suggest that everyone hold each other’s hands like good friends!”

“That’s a really good proposal!” Li Jiao was trying to find some sense of security, and Yang Kai’s proposal undoubtedly hit home as he hurriedly looked over at Zhu Lie.

Zhu Lie, maintaining a cold face, responded, “If you dare to lean over, you’re dead.”

“Ahem, it was Palace Master Yang’s suggestion…” Li Jiao replied, now stuck in a tight position.

Zhu Lie furrowed his brow before he took out a ribbon from his Space Ring without another word.

Although they were inside a chaotic nothingness, when the ribbon appeared, a flash of light immediately brightened the surroundings for a moment. Obviously, it was a fairly good Emperor Artifact. Moreover, it was an Emperor Artifact quite suitable for women.

“Use this,” Zhu Lie suggested. Asking him to hold hands with Li Jiao was more difficult than killing him.

“That should work too!” Yang Kai nodded.

Zhu Lie immediately flicked the ribbon straight at Yang Kai, who grabbed its end and tied it around his waist while Zhu Lie tied the other end to himself.

Li Jiao, looking with eager eyes, asked with an unashamed look, “Leave a bit, leave a bit for me too.”

Zhu Lie let out a snort. Although he was filled with dissatisfaction, he didn’t make things difficult for him and really left a section for Li Jiao, who hurriedly and happily tied it to his wrist.

This way, all three of them were connected with each other, and the quality of the ribbon was pretty good, so it wouldn’t break that easily.

As for Zhu Qing, there was no need to worry about her. Yang Kai was holding her in his arms the whole time, so it could be said that she was in the safest place. It was just that she was blushing and having a hard time adapting to being so close to Yang Kai in front of others.

“Alright, let’s find the exit now,” Yang Kai shouted.

“Do you know where the exit is?” Zhu Lie asked.

“I can sense it somewhat,” Yang Kai turned and looked towards a certain direction before walking off. Zhu Lie and Li Jiao hurriedly followed after him.

After walking for a while, Zhu Lie felt that something was wrong.

Indeed, it was a good idea to use a ribbon to remain connected to each other, avoiding the embarrassment and discomfort of holding hands, but now, it gave the impression that Yang Kai was leading two animals…

Once this thought crossed his mind, Zhu Lie’s face blackened right away.

Li Jiao was struck with panic and large beads of sweat started oozing from his forehead as, much to his surprise, he felt a murderous intent rising from Zhu Lie.

[I didn’t provoke him! So what’s going on now?] He couldn’t understand.
