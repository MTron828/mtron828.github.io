This was a Second-Order Dao Source Realm Monster Beast Monster Core, and it belonged to a Monster Beast with an extremely powerful Soul, so it was the best raw material to refine a Spirit Pill for enhancing Soul cultivation.

Yang Kai stuffed it into his Space Ring before swimming over to the altar.

Above the altar, there was no trace of any barrier or Spirit Array, only the green bead placed on top of it.

Yang Kai spent some time confirming there were no hidden traps before he reached out carefully and snatched the bead, everything going unexpectedly smoothly.

After using both his Divine Sense and Source Qi to probe and stimulate the bead, Yang Kai observed no reaction at all, exactly like the red bead he acquired earlier!

He really didn’t understand how the strange beast managed to draw energy from this green bead to heal itself.

Immediately afterwards, Yang Kai took out the fiery red bead to compare the two side by side, quickly determining that aside from their different colours, these two beads were identical.

After observing for a long time, he slowly shook his head.

He couldn’t infer the purpose of these two beads at all, so he had no choice but to put them away for now.

Just after Yang Kai stored the green bead into his Space Ring though, a sudden change occurred.

Although the lake was cold before, there were no sign of it freezing, but now, a kind of crackling sound came from all directions and a piercing chill began to fill the water as it began to condense into ice.

Yang Kai’s face changed as he quickly flew upwards.

Bursting through the surface of the lake, Yang Kai came to a halt a couple dozen metres up and turned back just in time to see the entire lake freeze over, blending in with the rest of the silvery white scenery perfectly.

“It seems that it was all thanks to the green bead that this lake was able to avoid freezing,” Yang Kai muttered to himself, wondering just what kind of secret power the green bead held that could actually hold back such an intrusive and severe cold.

After pondering for a moment, Yang Kai turned and flew towards the shore.

Upon his return, Liu Yan just rushed to him and nodded lightly, not saying much, while the little snowflake seemed extremely happy and danced around Yang Kai non-stop.

“Let’s move on,” Yang Kai said to the little snowflake, and the other party seemed to understand his meaning and flew off in a certain direction.

Over the next few days. Yang Kai toured around the Realm of Winter.

With the guidance of the little snowflake, as long as there was any precious treasure nearby, it would smoothly enter Yang Kai’s Space Ring.

Yang Kai’s thinking was quite simple. Since the Bustling World Great Emperor specified that Qin Zhao Yang should come to the Four Seasons Realm to find the Tribulation Fruit, it should not be a pointless endeavour. In other words, this Four Seasons Realm definitely had this special spirit fruit, it was just that he had yet to find it.

However, as long as Yang Kai persevered, he would eventually find what he was looking for, especially now that he had the assistance of the little snowflake, which had a unique advantage in this environment.

Thinking so, Yang Kai made up his mind to not leave the Realm of Winter unless he found the Tribulation Fruit, otherwise, once he left the Four Seasons Realm, he would have no way to explain himself to Qin Zhao Yang.

What disappointed Yang Kai though was that despite gaining many rare and precious Ice Attribute herbs, there was no sign of the Tribulation Fruit anywhere. What’s more, Yang Kai had killed a large number of Monster Beasts during this time, but aside from some Monster Cores, he didn’t obtain another Star Seal.

As time passed, Yang Kai couldn’t help secretly becoming anxious.

On this day, atop an ice glacier, Yang Kai stood with an ugly expression on his face as he stared at a crystal-like fruit tree in front of him.

This fruit tree was only about two metres tall and its leaves seemed to be formed from pure ice that exuded a frigid chill.

On this fruit tree, there was nothing of value; however, at a certain spot on one of its branches, there was a clear trace of something being plucked.

“What a miscalculation, I was a step too late!” Yang Kai muttered in annoyance.

This fruit tree was none other than the Tribulation Fruit Tree. Under the leadership of little snowflake, a ten day exhaustive search had led Yang Kai to this Tribulation Fruit Tree.

However, the Tribulation Fruit which should have existed here had clearly been taken away!

Judging from the traces left on the tree, the fruit should have been harvested only a few days ago.

“Master, you did your best. There’s no need to blame yourself...” Liu Yan quickly comforted when she saw Yang Kai’s expression turn sour.

“I just want to know... who actually took the spirit fruit,” Yang Kai frowned.

Although the Tribulation Fruit was precious and rare, it was not a widely known product, and even if it was taken away, there were very few uses for it. If Yang Kai could figure out who took this spirit fruit, he could likely exchange it for a correspondingly valuable treasure.

As long as the other party wasn’t too unreasonable, they should be happy to make such a transaction, and it wasn’t a big deal for Yang Kai to offer up something in exchange.

But the current situation was that Yang Kai had no idea who this Tribulation Fruit had been obtained by! As such, it was impossible for him to implement this method.

“Is there another fruit tree like this in the Realm of Winter?” Yang Kai turned his head and asked the little snowflake expectantly.

The little snowflake’s fuzzy facial features appeared to furrow before it shook itself side to side.

Yang Kai’s last hope was shattered.

Sighing lightly, Yang Kai grumbled unhappily to himself.

After the Four Seasons Realm opened, the cultivators that entered could only remain inside for thirty-three days. When the time limit came, they would have to already be at a specific location in order to leave the Four Seasons Realm, otherwise they would be trapped inside until the next opening.

Counting the days, it had been about twenty days since Yang Kai entered the Four Seasons Realm, and he had spent more than half that time in the Realm of Winter.

Starting from here, it would take him a few days to rush to the location of the exit, so there was not much time left.

What’s more, he had almost explored the entire Realm of Winter and most of the spirit grasses and medicines that grew here had entered his Space Ring. Now that the Tribulation Fruit had been picked by someone else, there was no point in continuing to remain here.

It would be better to first rush to the exit, then wait for the return of the disciples from the major Sects so he could find a chance to inquire about the whereabouts of the Tribulation Fruit. There was still a chance for success!

Thinking so, Yang Kai made a decision and turned his head to the little snowflake, “Show us the way out!”

“Is Master planning on leaving?” Liu Yan asked as her beautiful eyes flashed.

“En,” Yang Kai nodded.

Liu Yan naturally had no objections, but the little snowflake seemed to be a little sad. These past few days this lonely little creature had experienced so much fun that now it was a little reluctant to be left behind. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Yang Kai grinned and said, “If you want, you can come with me!”

Hearing this, the little snowflake’s wrinkled facial features suddenly unfolded and it beamed with joy, but soon, it once again slumped and shook its head helplessly.

Liu Yan whispered, “It can’t leave the Realm of Winter... It is different from me. This land was where it was born, and its source is here, if it leaves, it will soon wither and die.”

“How can that be?” Yang Kai was stunned.

Liu Yan sighed, “If it leaves here, it would be similar to me abandoning my vessel... rootless wood and sourceless water cannot be sustained for long, unless...”

“Unless what?” Yang Kai asked.

“Unless there was a similar environment in the Sealed World Bead, then it could continue to survive,” Liu Yan replied.

Yang Kai heard this and immediately understood that his recruitment plan was hopeless. He originally thought he could take the little snowflake into his Small Sealed World, but apparently he was too naive.

Understanding this, Yang Kai stretched out his hand, held up the little snowflake, and placed it on his shoulder as he smiled and said, “Don’t be so sad, if there’s a chance, I’ll return here to see you! Just wait for me, next time, I’ll be sure to find a way to take you away!”

Though he said so, Yang Kai also knew that the chances of this were basically next to none, as it would be several hundred years before the Four Seasons Realm opened again at the earliest, and by then, he would likely not be able to enter.

After all, by then, he should have reached the Emperor Realm...

However, the little snowflake was too innocent to understand this, so this simple coddling immediately allowed its mood to improve and become joyful again.

Watching it dance about happily, Yang Kai felt quite some pain in his heart...

Starting from the glacier, it took a full four days before Yang Kai reached the Two Seasons Mountain Range, and although there were some gains along the way, there weren’t many.

At this point, the little snowflake didn’t move forward anymore.

Yang Kai and Liu Yan bid farewell to it here before flying off.

Once he passed through the Two Seasons Mountain Range, Yang Kai flew straight towards the exit.

Before entering the Four Seasons Realm, each Sect Elder had informed the disciples of their Sect that they must arrive at the exit before the closure date.

As for the location of this exit, it was at the centre of the Four Seasons Realm!

As such, Yang Kai didn’t need to worry about going in the wrong direction.

After three days of travel, Yang Kai arrived at a flat plain and soon spotted the exit of the Four Seasons Realm on the horizon.

The exit, like the entrance in the unnamed mountain valley, was a giant oval light door that quietly floated mid-air.

Cultivators who entered the Four Seasons Realm could leave the Four Seasons Realm at any time through this light gate.

However, the time limit had not been reached yet, so obviously no cultivator would leave early.

The situation here was just as Yang Kai had expected, empty, with no one else around.

Counting the days, there were still five or six days until the time limit was reached.

Yang Kai didn’t intend to explore the Four Seasons Realm anymore and just planned to wait here; after all, there was no guarantee that the person who obtained the Tribulation Fruit wouldn’t arrive here early and leave.

While waiting, Yang Kai began to think about what he would exchange with others if he really found the one who obtained the Tribulation Fruit.

There were countless valuables in his hands, but many of them could not be brought out to trade, such as his five Emperor Artifacts.

He had a few Dao Source Pills left over from his recent breakthrough, but these were only useful for peak Origin Kings. Most Dao Source Realm cultivators wouldn’t be interested in these.

He also had a lot of gains in the Four Seasons Realm that he could bring out, but whether the one who had the Tribulation Fruit would be interested in any of these items was uncertain.

After thinking it over, Yang Kai decided that his best bet was to offer up the drop of Immortal Source Liquid he still had, as it was a chip that no one would refuse.
