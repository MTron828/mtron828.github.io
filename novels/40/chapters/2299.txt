Qiu Yu couldn’t just continue to observe in silence. He stretched out his hand to pull Luo Bing and warned, “Little Sister Bing, don’t make a scene, the City Lord is completely focused on preparing for the wedding ceremony tomorrow, and he probably doesn’t have time to meet with you.”

“I’m not making a scene, I just want to make a purchase,” Luo Bing said obstinately.

Yang Kai shook his head and took the medicinal ingredients then put them in his Space Ring. Shortly after, he paid the shopkeeper enough Source Crystals and turned around to leave.

He didn’t bother with quarrelling with the two!

“Stop!” Luo Bing ordered, but her shout was futile. Upon seeing that Yang Kai would shortly leave, she quickly pulled at Qiu Yu and entreated him, “Brother Yu, please block him for me, I have to buy those medicinal ingredients today.”

“Just forget about it!” An irritated look flashed past Qiu Yu’s eyes. He had already accompanied this insensible little girl for so long and he couldn’t stand her temper tantrum any longer; however, Sky Crane City was a fairly powerful force and Sky Illumination Palace wanted to have a better relationship with them, so every time he visited Sky Crane City, he needed to keep Luo Bing company. “If the City Lord learned of this, it won’t be a good end for you.”

“What? What did I do wrong? I can take and do whatever I want in Sky Crane City, and if anything goes wrong, I’ll take responsibility,” Luo Bing said bossily. “What’s more, isn’t he with Thousand Leaves Sect? We can take this opportunity to ask him the reason why he sneaked into the city, and what he is plotting.”

“Haa!” Qiu Yu let out a helpless sigh. She kept pestering him as before, and he could only brace himself and agree. In any case, he also wanted to know how Yang Kai was related to Thousand Leaves Sect. After all, he knew that the Thousand Leaves Sect didn’t have any disciples or Elders called ‘Yang Kai’.

However, Ye Jing Han had claimed that he was part of the Sect, so he couldn’t help but get a little wary and eventually nodded, “Good, but if the City Lord asks about this...”

“I won’t mention your name. Brother Yu, you’re the best!” Luo Bing revealed a delighted look.

Qiu Yu’s expression turned grave and he shouted, “Elders, I’ll have to trouble you with this.”

He seemed to be talking to the air, those who saw this would question who he was talking to...

Luo Bing stood there with a smile and observed Yang Kai’s back in anticipation, and she started daydreaming about taking him down and interrogating him until he would kneel and beg for forgiveness. Finally, she would get him to hand over the herbs to her. But, as she continued observing, her smile quickly disappeared. Yang Kai had just walked out of the door leisurely then turned around and disappeared into the crowd.

“He... He ran away!” Luo Bing shook Qiu Yu’s arm and reminded him.

A startled look appeared on Qiu Yu’s face and he shouted to the void, “Elders, what’s wrong?”

When his voice just fell, two silhouettes flickered and appeared in front of them. The two Third-Order Dao Source Realm Masters, who had been at the city gate with him appeared, but they were now drenched in a cold sweat with faces as pale as paper, as if they just experienced some terrible fright.

“Why didn’t you make a move?” Anger was apparent on Qiu Yu’s face. He felt like he had just embarrassed himself in front of Luo Bing and was in an awful mood.

The two old men exchanged a glance then one of them spoke, “Young Master, you must know, we didn’t wish to disobey your orders, we simply couldn’t make a move.”

“What’s wrong?” Qiu Yu’s face fell.

The old man continued, “I also can’t say why, when we were about to act against that boy, we suddenly felt an ominous premonition, as though the shadow of death was looming over us... It was as if... As if....”

Saying so, clear fear appeared on his face.

The other old man added, “If we had really made a move, we would now be corpses.”

“Are you cracking a joke with me?” Qiu Yu’s jaw dropped as he glared at the two old men in disbelief.

The old man who had spoken first responded, “Young Master, we have followed you for so many years and we have never disobeyed your orders, but this time... Things are just not as they seem!”

“That’s right, please forgive us,” the other old man pleaded.

Qiu Yu observed them for long then said bitterly, “What you are implying is that he’s hiding his true strength, and he’s likely an... Emperor Realm Master?”

Upon saying so, Qiu Yu couldn’t help but gulp hard as cold sweat dripped down his back, his face turning deathly pale.

The two old men were both Third-Order Dao Source Realm Masters, and even though they had already grown old, their power had only grown more refined and vigorous with time. No one other than an Emperor Realm Master could instantly take them down and deter them from making a move.

Upon thinking he may have just provoked an Emperor Realm Master, Qiu Yu suddenly felt feeble and his legs started shivering, making it impossible for him to stand straight.

“No, no, no...” The old man that spoke a while ago shook his head and said. “He is fairly young so he is unlikely to be an Emperor Realm Master. What’s more, we have observed him with our Divine Senses carefully, and he’s really just in the Second-Order Dao Source Realm.”

“Then there is an Emperor Realm Master in the dark protecting him?” Qiu Yu was surprised again.

“It isn’t the case, that feeling we felt... It didn’t seem like it was from an Emperor Realm Master...” The other old man shook his head.

Qiu Yu knitted his brow, “Then aren’t your senses betraying you?”

The old man who spoke first asked, “Young Master, don’t you believe us?”

“I didn’t say so,” Upon hearing this, Qiu Yu quickly waved his hand in denial. “It’s just... This matter must have a reasonable explanation, is it because that young man could easily defeat you?”

The old man sneered, “He’s one hundred years too young to defeat us with his current cultivation.”

Luo Bing, who had been listening to this for such a long time, was confused. so, she butted in, “What are you talking about? That man has already left. You two old men are so useless, Brother Yu has taken care of you in vain.”

Qiu Yu’s expression turned cold and he glared at Luo Bing, “Shut up!”

Luo Bing was startled by this. Qiu Yu had never treated her like this since she became acquainted with him and she had never seen him so angry. In addition, she had just been thwarted a while ago; therefore, she couldn’t take it any longer and shouted hysterically, “Did you just scold me? You dare to scold me!?”

Qiu Yu snorted coldly, “These two are as close to me as my own Grandparents! You don’t have the right to insult them!”

Luo Bing’s eyes got flushed and she broke into tears. She gnashed her teeth and glared at Qiu Yu resentfully then pounced at him, raining kicks and punches on him as she shouted, “I hate you, I hate you, you’re the worst. I hate you so much!”

After she beat him for a while, she turned around and ran outside of the store and quickly disappeared among the crowd.

“Young Master, go after her!” Upon seeing this, the expression of one of the old men changed and he advised.

Qiu Yu snorted coldly, “That little girl has been spoiled to the core, just let her be. Hopefully, she will reflect on her actions after this.”

“But, if Lady Bing suffers any mishap, then...” The old man spoke with a worried look.

Qiu Yu didn’t take this seriously and he just explained, “She’s the daughter of the City Lord, so who would dare to harm her in Sky Crane City? She probably ran back to the City Lord’s Mansion. I know her temperament, you don’t have to worry over this.”

Upon hearing this, the two old men quieted down and didn’t say more.

“About that young man... We should pay more attention to him,” Qiu Yu said with a grave look on his face, “He probably has some great secrets, and I’m also pretty curious about his origins.”

“Young Master, you can rest assured, I will go to investigate this right away,” After one of the old men cupped his fist and spoke, his body flickered and disappeared.

.....

In one of Sky Crane City’s streets, a heartbroken young girl was rushing ahead through the crowd in tears, knocking into some people along the way. Her careless actions caused many to shout and curse at her.

Luo Bing was deeply hurt. She didn’t just get mocked by someone, she had also been shamed in that store. Worse, now even Qiu Yu, who she saw as her closest friend, had publicly scolded her.

She had never suffered so much in her life and she felt immensely aggrieved. The young girl’s tears flowed without stop and her eyes quickly got flushed and swollen.

As she ran away in tears, she still didn’t forget to frequently look back, as if she was expecting someone, but she didn’t see him chasing after her. Upon realizing this, she felt even more hurt and felt like she was the most miserable and pitiful person in Sky Crane City.

As she mulled this over repeatedly and eventually realized that the chief culprit was that wicked young man. If he had just given up the herbs to her, then she wouldn’t have found herself in such an awkward position and she also wouldn’t get scolded by Qiu Yu.

Upon realizing this, she cursed Yang Kai viciously in her mind and vowed to teach him a memorable lesson.

Luo Bing had been running in tears for a long time, and when she finally came back to her senses, she discovered in shock that she had gotten lost.

She was the daughter of Sky Crane City’s Lord and she had lived her whole life here; however, she was always accompanied by guards when she went out into the city, so she never paid any attention to her surroundings, only caring about her own amusement. After she was done with what she wanted to do, she would be escorted home.

Moreover, all regions she visited were the most prosperous areas of Sky Crane City!

But, at this moment, she ended up in a deserted region with narrow roads and filthy air. A sickening odour pervaded this place and many broken stalls and run-down shops surrounded her.

There was also a wretched beggar covered in filth trying to pick the lice off of himself, tossing each one he caught into his mouth, chewing them in delight...

Luo Bing quickly looked away and she felt like she would soon throw up. She couldn’t help but question whether this was still the prosperous Sky Crane City? Did she run so far away and end up in another unknown city?

Upon thinking of this, Luo Bing was terrified.

If it was so, then she wouldn’t be able to find her way back home. She had just calmed down, yet she quickly succumbed to despair again and started crying.

At this moment, she sighted upon two men walking in front of her and she quickly ran toward them in tears, as if they were the last straw she could clutch onto. She shouted in a desperate voice, “Sirs, please wait!”

Upon hearing this, the two men halted and turned their heads to take a look at Luo Bing.

Upon seeing her, their eyes lit up.

Luo Bing was quite pretty and had an alluring figure. She had always lived like a princess so she had a naturally authoritative air, and even though her face was tear-stained, this only added a kind of special charm to her.

It was no wonder that the two men couldn’t take their eyes off her and they had even started drooling. Usually, any woman with decent looks wouldn’t step into this region of Sky Crane City, yet a great beauty had arrived on this day. So, how could they resist the temptation?
