[Why only him? We are all Shaman Grandmasters here, so why did they only give Shaman Niu weapons but not us? We are not any weaker than Shaman Niu!] Many of the Shaman Grandmasters grew agitated at the thought.

“Hey, what’s the meaning of this? Why did you send everything only to him? Why not this Shaman too?” A Shaman Grandmaster shouted from mid-air.

“Yes, war is near. These things should be divided equally. He can’t just get everything alone.” Someone immediately agreed.

Many Shamans agreed with the statement and for a moment, everyone clamoured endlessly and the scene turned chaotic.

“What’s all this noise for?” The Barbarian Warrior who led the way rebuked angrily, not giving these Shamans Grandmasters any face. He looked up and snorted coldly, “Who told you that we gave these weapons to Sir Shaman Niu? He bartered his belongings for all of these.”

“Ba… bartered?”

“Impossible!”

“What did he use to exchange for so many weapons?”

No one could possibly have such huge financial resources to exchange for at least a thousand weapons that had been piled up at the scene, and more weapons had yet to come. Even a Shaman King couldn’t have this much wealth to purchase so many weapons.

The Barbarian leader shook his head and answered, “I don’t know what Sir Shaman Niu exchanged with the others, but he gave me this.”

While speaking, he took out a round object. Many Barbarian Warriors had no idea what it was, but the faces of those Shaman Grandmasters changed drastically when they saw it and shouted, “A Monster Core!”

Moreover, it was a notably high-quality Monster Core. Such a Monster Core could even be beneficial to the cultivation of a Shaman King, let alone Shaman Grandmasters. Such a Monster Core was indeed worth a lot of weapons.

But no Shaman Grandmaster would be willing to trade this treasure for weapons that were not useful to himself. In order to get so many weapons, how many Barbarian Beast Cores had Shaman Niu spent?

It was scary just thinking about it.

“Sir Shaman Niu also exchanged this with me.” Another shop owner followed up, taking out a similar Monster Core and waving it in front of the audience, blinding the eyes of the Shaman Grandmasters.

If these various kinds of weapons had great attraction to the ordinary Barbarian Warriors, these Monster Cores had just the same effect on the Shaman Grandmasters.

The look they gave Yang Kai changed instantly, as only one question filled their minds, how did he get so many Monster Cores?

A Shaman Grandmaster was not capable of killing so many powerful Barbarian Beasts, not even a Shaman King could. Likewise, where were there so many Barbarian Beasts to kill?

Time passed slowly, and after learning the truth of this trade, the clamorous Shaman Grandmasters were too embarrassed to shout anymore. They could only stare at the weapons placed in front of them with envious looks. Some people were even silently plotting whether they should start building a good relationship with Shaman Niu. Not to mention others, just by getting Barbarian Beast Monster Cores from him would be enough to infinitely benefit them.

It took until after the sun had set fully for the final Barbarian shop owner to bring the last weapons to complete Yang Kai’s transaction. There were now thousands of weapons in total piled up on the ground!

Bursts of rapid breathing exposed the restless hearts of many surrounding Ancient Barbarians.

The villagers from Blue South Village were even more exhilarated, all of them gulping their own saliva in excitement; after all, they had already guessed what these weapons were going to be used for.

They were not fools. On this day, when the invasion of the Demon Race was announced, the reason why Yang Kai suddenly bought so many weapons was obviously to prepare them for the upcoming war. Nevertheless, Yang Kai’s incredible method was still too shocking for them to accept.

Ah Hu came up to Yang Kai, quietly pulled him aside, and whispered, “Ah Niu, are these things… for us?”

Yang Kai smiled, and patted him on the shoulder, “Of course, they’re for all of you.” Then, he waved his hand and invited them, “Choose one for yourself.”

The faces of the thousand of people turned solemn at his words.

The Shaman Apprentices who had secretly complained about Yang Kai’s inaction earlier had nothing to say at this moment, only respect and awe remained on their faces.

There were a hundred Shaman Grandmasters gathered outside King City, but who had the capability to collect so many weapons at once? Who could pull off what Shaman Niu did?

One must first sharpen their tools before doing good work. With so many sharp weapons, even if there were only a thousand people in their group, the advantage that they would have was by no means something a mere collection of two or three thousand more warriors could compare with. Furthermore, the number of weapons that were stacked up here was definitely more than a thousand pieces.

The several Shaman Apprentices seemed to be able to foresee what would happen next and their complaints and dissatisfaction towards Yang Kai completely vanished. Despite Shaman Niu’s youthful appearance, it seemed he was completely capable of handling this situation. He seemed to be doing nothing just now, but once he made his move, it delivered a killing blow so devastating that everyone could not help but admire his wit and courage.

The several Shaman Apprentices from different villages smiled as they glanced at each other.

The sound of gulping came up one after another. The thousand people under Yang Kai’s lead gathered around the mountain of weapons, but no one was eager to scramble for them. Everyone stared at the stacked weapons with giddy faces, their eyes glowing as if they were not looking at cold weapons, but at naked beauties.

“You guys go first!” Ah Hu suddenly turned around and looked at the villagers of the other villages. As a warrior who came from the same village as Yang Kai, Ah Hu felt that it was time to win some glory and establish prestige for Ah Niu. Therefore, he was not in a hurry to grab his weapon, but gave priority to the villagers of the other villages instead.

The leaders of those villages exchanged looks at his words, and one of them smiled and shook his head as he replied, “These are the weapons brought by Sir Shaman Niu. Blue South Village should go first. Please.”

“That’s right, Ah Hu. You pick first!”

“Yes, Ah Hu. Don’t refuse us!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

But Ah Hu shook his head, “It is precisely because Ah Niu obtained these things that I want you to pick first. These things are not just brought for Blue South Village, but for everyone.”

The leaders of the several villages burst into a quarrel with each other, because they did not give in to each other and were unwilling to pick first. At the same time, the surrounding Ancient Barbarians who were watching them secretly cursed in their hearts, feeling envious and helpless.

All of a sudden, the oldest Shaman Apprentice remarked with a smile, “Let’s not quarrel. Now that we are gathered together, there is no difference between this village and that village anymore. We are one now and are all under Shaman Niu’s command. It could be said we are now in the Shaman Niu Clan. It doesn’t matter who comes first or who comes later. Moreover, there are so many weapons here, so there will still be a lot left even if each of you takes one. So, there’s no need to be shy.”

“The Shaman Niu Clan…” Everyone’s eyes lit up listening to his words, and started to ponder about it.

The old Shaman Apprentice was right. Now that they had all gathered together, there was really no point to distinguish everyone by their original village. Only by truly combining into one whole could they unite in the upcoming war with a common will as strong as a fortress. If they deliberately distinguish themselves by their original villages, it would only allow selfishness to grow between them, and any disunity may result in death in the coming war.

After a moment of pondering, Ah Hu nodded, “I agree with what Elder has said. In that case, let’s pick together.”

The rest naturally had no objection and immediately rushed up to begin dividing up those weapons. When they found the weapon that was most suited for themselves, they took it out and moved back to allow others to choose their weapons.

For a moment, the whole place was filled with the noise of a celebratory crowd; laughter of contentment could be heard everywhere. The situation was lively yet not chaotic, as everyone moved in an orderly manner.

The other Shaman Grandmasters took in the scene before their eyes, their expressions complex.

Needless to say, envy and admiration were what they felt. Shaman Niu easily united a thousand people together with a simple giveaway of weapons, which was a method that was worth being commended upon. They took a look at the Barbarian Warriors in their groups, letting out a sigh, seeing that many were now gazing at these people in jealousy.

It could not be helped though, as although such a method seemed to be simple, they had no way to mimic it because they did not have the financial resources that Shaman Niu apparently did.

On top of admiration, they felt a sense of crisis.

The order of the Shaman King made it very clear that every Shaman Grandmaster had to win over two to three thousand clansmen. Quite a number of people had completed the task after half a day, but there were still a few of them working hard towards it.

There were also more scattered warriors and wandering heroes still waiting to decide who to follow. Originally, everyone used their own means in recruiting under fair competition, but now, with what Shaman Niu had done, he instantly gained the absolute upper hand over the other Shaman Grandmasters, throwing them far behind him.

Perhaps, more clansmen would be willing to join them after the thousand people finished getting their share of weapons. What would they do if those powerful warriors were all drawn away by Shaman Niu by then?

Thinking of this, a few Shaman Grandmasters who were on good terms with each other gathered together and began to discuss countermeasures.

After a stick of incense worth of time, the thousand Barbarian Warriors under Yang Kai had chosen their own weapons. Looking proud and majestic, they held up high the axes, swords, and spears that were forged from refined metal. On the other hand, the archers also replaced their old weapons with new, powerful bows and arrows.

The mountain of weapons that piled up in the place had only shrunk by a third of its original size, and there were still many more weapons waiting for their masters to choose them.

Groups of Barbarian Warriors started to approach the mountain and stare at the weapons with covetous looks, all of them shooting glances towards Yang Kai with desire-filled eyes.

Yang Kai smiled, snapped his fingers and announced, “The Shaman Niu Clan… is recruiting!”

“Sir Shaman Niu, I am willing to join!”

“I will join, of course I will join!”

“I also want to join! Sir Shaman Niu, please accept me. I’m the most powerful warrior in our village!”

As soon as Yang Kai’s voice fell, the voices of countless people immediately overwhelmed the area. The situation was almost out of control. Fortunately, Ah Hu and the others drew out their new weapons in time and stopped the other Ancient Barbarians from flooding the place.

Yang Kai raised his hand and assured, “Don’t rush and don’t push. Sir Shaman King ordered us to gather up to three thousand clansmen, and this Shaman Niu’s goal is precisely three thousand people. Therefore, many still have a chance. If anyone is interested in joining the Shaman Niu Clan, please line up here and come forward to get your weapon. Once you have your weapon, you will be a clansman of my Shaman Niu Clan.”

As soon as the words came out, everyone immediately quieted down and the Ancient Barbarians quickly formed a queue like a long, snaking Dragon.
