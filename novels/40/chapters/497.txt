Colorful Balloons Take Flight

The burning torches everywhere illuminated the entire mansion while the moon hung high in the sky, all around, War City was passing a peaceful, quiet night.

“You’ve come?” Yang Kai, who was cultivating, suddenly opened his eyes and stared at a certain patch of darkness, a smile on his lips.

Old Demon, who was standing guard beside him, also let out a laugh, disturbing the once peaceful night.

“Since you’ve come, why not show yourself?” Yang Kai called out.

The door suddenly opened and Yang Kai’s eyes stared straight ahead, spotting a nearly transparent figure in the pale moonlight. This figure, just like earlier today, was like a clear stream of water and slowly walked into the room, coming to a stop roughly ten meters away from Yang Kai.

Old Demon secretly circulated his True Qi while Ying Jiu, who was hiding in the darkness, also focused all his attention on the mysterious master, not daring to miss a single movement.

“As timid as a mouse!” From the place where the almost transparent figure stood, a disdainful, yet somewhat sweet and tender female voice called out, apparently mocking Yang Kai for having two masters guarding him at this time.

“Show your true face!” Yang Kai didn’t care, quietly calling out.

“A rat like you isn’t qualified to see this young lady’s face!” The person in front of him snorted before pausing for a moment, “Unless, you let those two beside you leave first!”

Yang Kai smiled playfully, silently taking out the little doll made from this person’s hair.

As he did so, he could clearly feel the woman’s gaze lock onto the doll; her gaze seemingly filled with dread and bitterness, obviously anxious to snatch it and then disappear into the night.

After a short standoff, Yang Kai suddenly waved his hand.

“Young Master!” Old Demon’s expression changed slightly, quietly objecting.

“It’s alright.” Yang Kai shook his head. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Old Demon frowned then nodded, “Then old servant and Ying Jiu will wait outside, if Young Master has any instructions, just call out!”

After saying that, he walked towards the door. Passing by the mysterious woman, Old Demon suddenly muttered, “Don’t mess with my Young Master, or your future will be miserable.”

The mysterious woman just snorted coldly.

After Old Demon and Ying Jiu went out, the mysterious woman became relaxed. With the two masters constantly staring at her, even she was a little nervous.

Noticing the subtle change in her demeanor, Yang Kai lightly laughed, “It seems like you’re not very strong.”

If she was worried about Ying Jiu and Old Demon, obviously she wasn’t a top powerhouse.

“Stronger than you at least.” The woman shot back, not wanting to show any weakness.

Yang Kai’s brow wrinkled slightly, in this situation, this woman... actually responded to his simple taunting, she was obviously somewhat immature, how old was she? At this point, Yang Kai was also quite curious.

“Now, as you wished, my two guards have left. Show your true face!”

“Hehe...” The woman giggled, although her body was all but transparent, it was still easy to tell her style was excellent, coupled with her pleasant laughter she gave off a teasing aura, “You just want to see me?”

“Right!” Yang Kai slowly got up and walked towards her.

The mysterious woman’s breath suddenly stagnated, it was like Yang Kai truly didn’t fear the immensity of Heaven, even in the absence of any followers, and he dared approach her.

Even if he came right up to her, the woman shouldn’t have anything to fear, yet at this moment she couldn’t help feeling a sense of crisis.

Quickly shaking her head, the woman dispelled the uneasiness in her heart and her aura suddenly became dangerous, coldly saying, “I’ll give you a chance, hand over that thing in your hand.”

“And if I say no?”

“All the people who angered this young lady have never had a good end!” The woman snorted, her almost invisible body suddenly bursting, filling the room with a strange mist that quickly wrapped surrounded Yang Kai.

Sensing the movement inside the room, Ying Jiu, who was standing at the door, wanted to rush inside, but Old Demon promptly held him back.

Slowly shaking his head, Old Demon said, “Young Master won’t suffer any harm.”

“If something happens to him, you’ll pay with your life!” Ying Jiu coldly shouted.

Old Demon smirked, “In terms of loyalty, this old master is no worse than you. Don’t worry, the one who is in danger is that woman, daring to threaten Young Master, her end will certainly be miserable.”

As soon as he spoke these words, a pitiful scream erupted from inside the room. It was the voice of the woman, and listening to her cries, it seemed like she was suffering from some kind of inhumane torture.

Among her screams once could also make out Yang Kai’s low-pitched sneers.

Ying Jiu’s expression immediately became awkward. In his mind, he couldn’t help imagining a scene where a strong man was brutally tormenting a weak, helpless girl while laughing maliciously at her suffering.

His blood suddenly became cold.

Inside the room, Yang Kai stood in the same place, holding the little doll in his hand, squeezing and bending it with his fingers. Every time he moved it, the woman’s screams would resound again.

After a while, a figure suddenly appeared in front of his eyes, the mist around him was still too thick so he couldn’t see everything, but under this painful torture, the woman twitched and spasmed on the ground, like a quail in winter, her tender body trembled, her silky light blue hair scattered around like a waterfall. She seemed delicate, helpless, and pitiful.

Seeing all this, Yang Kai remained indifferent, releasing some scorching True Yang Yuan Qi from his body to evaporate the remaining mist before calmly walking up to the woman and looking down at her.

Seeing her light blue hair which shimmered like a clear lake, Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling a little surprised.

It was the first time he had seen such hair, supple, elegant, and beautiful! Anyone would find this kind of blue silk attractive upon laying eyes on it.

The mysterious woman’s body was also relatively small, her hair long enough to reach all the way down her back, her legs curled up as both her hands held her head, lying on the ground motionless, only her delicate mouth moved slightly as she gasped for breath.

Through the gap between her fingers and hair, Yang Kai saw a pair of bright eyes glaring at him hatefully; moreover, although this woman seemed to be in a weak and pitiful state, she was actually maintaining a defensive stance, ready to counterattack.

As long as Yang Kai went a step further, she would launch a lightning fast strike.

With a slight grin, Yang Kai stopped where he was.

Seeing this, the woman’s eyes suddenly became disappointed.

“Get up!” Yang Kai said lightly as he stared down at her.

The woman slowly shook her head, her attitude remaining firm.

“Don’t act like I’m forcing myself on you, I have no interest in old women!” Yang Kai snorted.

“Who is an old woman!?” Almost like a cat that had its tail stepped on, the woman immediately jumped up from the ground and glared at Yang Kai, her teeth grinding fiercely as her full chest heaved up and down, her long silky hair fluttering about, brushing past her well rounded hips and bottom.

After she spat these words, seeing Yang Kai’s proud smile, the woman realized that she had been baited, her expression becoming ugly as her cheeks flushed slightly.

On the other hand, Yang Kai’s gaze also became strange as he stared straight at the woman in front of him skeptically.

He discovered that this woman’s face was as immature as her voice.

The years had seemingly not left any trace upon her.

A woman, even if she had a beautiful face, couldn’t avoid the passage of time, unless she used some kind of rare Precious Treasure.

For example, although Dong Su Zhu and Tang Yu Xian both looked young, many people even mistakenly thinking Dong Su Zhu was the Yang Family Fourth Master’s daughter, but if one looked closely, they would still notice that they weren’t young girls.

But the woman in front of him was different; Yang Kai instinctively felt that if she hadn’t taken some beauty preserving Precious Treasure, she would really be a twenty year old girl.

As for her cultivation... Yang Kai’s Divine Sense swept over her and suddenly froze.

Immortal Ascension Boundary Eighth Stage!

This was the first time Yang Kai had clearly judged her cultivation. From the very first time they met, his Divine Sense couldn’t elucidate her realm, even Meng Wu Ya couldn’t tell, it was as if she had a special method to conceal herself from being investigated by other’s Divine Senses.

“What do you want to do here?” Yang Kai’s eyes became sharp as he interrogated, causing the woman’s beautiful face to pale slightly, her body instinctively shrinking back somewhat.

“I asked you, what are you doing here?” Yang Kai stared at her.

“What have I done to you? Why are you torturing me like this?” The woman suddenly became aggrieved her beautiful pair of eyes slowly becoming watery.

From when she was a child till now, she has never suffered such bitterness. This evil man tightly held onto a little doll made from one of her hairs and while he held it, he seemed able to control her every action, even whether she lived or died!

“I just came here to find someone, I haven’t done anything bad. Why are you treating me like this?” The woman said with an aggrieved expression.

“Find someone? Who are you looking for?” Yang Kai frowned.

“I’m not telling you!”

“How old are you?” Yang Kai suddenly felt a headache, inferring from her strength, it was absolutely impossible for her to be young, yet from her tone of voice and way of acting, it really was like she was just a little girl.

Under the Heaven’s, was there really such a strong girl? Even Su Yan right now he guessed would only have reached the Immortal Ascension Boundary Second or Third Stage.

“I’m not telling you this either, a woman’s age is her biggest secret.” The woman licked her lips and glared back at Yang Kai, suddenly thinking he wasn’t as vicious as she imagined, her expression relaxing quite a bit.

“Old Demon!” Yang Kai suddenly shouted out.

Old Demon swiftly came in, “Old Servant is here.”

“Seal this woman’s True Qi, strip her, and tie her up outside the house!”

“Yes!” Old Demon responded quickly and without hesitation.

The woman’s face which had just relaxed quickly became pale as she stared at Yang Kai incredulously. She never expected this man to not only be vicious, but also shameless to this extent.

In her mind, the scene of her being stripped naked and put on display for all to see outside the mansion flashed; picturing it, she couldn’t help shuddering.

Seeing Old Demon smirking evilly at her, her figure immediately disappeared, even her aura vanished.

“You think you can run?” Yang Kai sneered, viciously squeezing the doll again.

Along with a loud scream, the woman who had just disappeared once again appeared and fell to the ground and writhed about, unable to move as she liked, appearing extremely tragic.

Silavin: I know that light blue isn’t really that big of a deal for hair colour since the manhwa has shown some character having light hair. So, for now, imagine them to be of an unique shade.
