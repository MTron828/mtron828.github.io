This mass of grey Qi gave off an extremely uncomfortable feeling and gave off an aura like that of a senile, dying old man.

With Xia Ning Chang having a symbiotic relationship with it, how could it be good for her future?

Yang Kai could not help wearing a deep and profound look.

Although he wanted to immediately free Little Senior Sister from this worry, Yang Kai had no idea how to even start and did not dare do so before he fully understood the essence of this grey Qi.

Moreover, he vaguely felt a profoundness from this grey Qi that he could not completely fathom, and as he examined it, he felt like he was on the verge of comprehending something deep in his heart.

Even after further investigation though, he still could not learn anything of note.

This mass of grey Qi seemed to be able to exclude Yang Kai’s Divine Sense.

Xia Ning Chang breaking through to the Saint King Realm in a place like Tong Xuan Realm was no doubt linked in some way to this strange grey Qi.

This thing probably allowed her to comprehend a more profound level of the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao and provided her with the energy she needed to break through while also tightly binding itself to her.

But Yang Kai could not tell whether this was a blessing or a curse.

Just as Yang Kai was at a loss, the grey Qi bound by the golden net suddenly began struggling much more intensely; however, this time, instead of pointlessly trying to break free, it instead directly burst into millions of tiny pieces of grey Qi and slipped through its bindings.

Yang Kai did not have any time to react, and the mass of grey Qi managed to escape.

Immediately after, it flew downwards at remarkable speed and sank into the ground, disappearing from Yang Kai’s sight.

Yang Kai swiftly sent his Divine Sense into the ground but was unable to sense its existence anymore.

It had simply vanished. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Standing in place, Yang Kai wore a solemn look with a deep frown on his face.

It seemed that he would have to wait for Little Senior Sister to wake up before he could get some answers from her.

He did have a guess in his mind, but he could not be sure.

Looking at the peacefully sleeping Xia Ning Chang, Yang Kai gently picked her up by her waist, placed her on the bed, leaned over and kissed her on her forehead, and gently brushed her hair back before leaving silently.

A few breaths later, a thousand kilometres away, above the former site of War Spirit Temple.

Yang Kai stood mid-air, looking down as he spread his Divine Sense out like a tide.

Familiar auras appeared everywhere under his investigation, appearing like bright stars in the night sky.

Grinning widely, Yang Kai felt warmth in his heart that he had missed these past several dozen years. Immediately, he used his Divine Sense to send a simple message to all his relatives and friends, ‘I’m back’!

A scene just like what happened yesterday at Nine Heavens Holy Land appeared next.

The former War Spirit Temple site immediately erupted as rays of light shot up into the air from various places of retreat and rushed towards the place where Yang Kai was.

Everyone was so excited that as they met each other halfway they could not help asking one another to confirm whether they too had heard about Yang Kai’s return.

Only after arriving high up in the sky and seeing Yang Kai standing there did everyone dare to believe the authenticity of this news.

Tu Feng, Tang Yu Xian, Qu Gao Yi, Ying Jiu... All the Blood Warriors who fought alongside Yang Kai in the Inheritance War arrived in the first batch, each of them trembling with excitement as they called out to their Young Master and bowed deeply.

The Yang Family’s First Brother Yang Wei, Second Brother Yang Zhao, Third Brother Yang Tie, Fourth Brother Yang Xin Wu... All the brothers gathered as they hugged Yang Kai for the first time in decades.

“Haha, you bastard! You’ve been away for so many years, it’s like you wouldn’t return until after I died,” The Huo Family current Patriarch, Huo Xing Chen, laughed and appeared nearby.

After several decades, the suave Central Capital Wolf had become a middle-aged man, but rather than looking old, he instead just seemed more mature and his hot temper had been smoothed by time, making him even more handsome than before.

Next to Huo Xing Chen was Qiu Yi Meng, with tears in her beautiful eyes as she bit her red lips and stared at Yang Kai in disbelief, seemingly wanting to say something but too scared to open her mouth, worried that if she were to speak she would wake from this beautiful dream.

“Brother Huo, Sister Qiu!” Yang Kai turned to the two of them and gently nodded.

Huo Xing Chen chuckled before glancing over at Qiu Yi Meng, sighed to himself silently.

He realised something from the way Yang Kai addressed Qiu Yi Meng; by only using her surname.

Dong Qing Han and Dong Qing Yan also came, calling out to their cousin, livening up the atmosphere even more.

Yang Kai’s gaze suddenly turned to a certain spot next, however, as three streaks of light hurriedly rushed over towards him.

When these lights dispersed, three figures appeared.

The first was a man with a sage-like temperament who was dressed in clean scholarly robes, followed by a man with a tall stature and a woman who seemed quite cute and petite.

Yang Kai stood before these three and bowed lightly, “Grand Master!”

Ling Tai Xu nodded repeatedly, laughing heartily, “Good, good, it’s good that you’re back.”

“Father, mother!” Yang Kai next turned to the pair standing behind Ling Tai Xu and bowed again.

The Yang Family Fourth Master was a man of iron, but when he opened his mouth, he couldn’t find the right words to say and could only wipe the corners of his eyes quietly and nod, “Your Mother... missed you very much.”

There was no need to say this, though, as Dong Su Zhu was already crying like a child suffering from unimaginable grievances. Hurriedly, she flew forward and hugged Yang Kai tightly, weeping uncontrollable, unable to form any words at all.

Seeing her like this, Yang Kai could only smile.

Several dozen years had passed, but his mother’s childish character had not changed in the slightest, a fact that allowed him to relax unconsciously.

“Why you, what kind of cultivation do you have now? Why can’t I sense anything from you at all?” Huo Xing Chen walked up carelessly and circled Yang Kai as he asked in surprise.

Everyone else was also taken aback and released their Divine Senses to scan Yang Kai’s body.

However, none of them achieved anything, feeling like their Divine Senses were simply sinking into the ocean, unable to create the slightest ripple.

This discovery shocked everyone and made them subconsciously feel that Yang Kai’s current cultivation had already surpassed the level of Tong Xuan Realm.

“The Origin Returning Realm,” Yang Kai let go of Dong Su Zhu and patted her on the shoulder to comfort her. He did not know how to explain to everyone what the Origin Realm was, so after a moment he simply said, “En, two Great Realms above the Saint Realm.”

Gasps resounded from all around.

The Saint Realm was the pinnacle of Tong Xuan Realm, and above it was the Saint King Realm, but throughout the ages, only the Great Demon God had reached that realm.

But now, Yang Kai had surpassed this legendary realm, taking a further step on the Martial Dao.

Qiu Yi Meng’s beautiful eyes dimmed suddenly as bitterness flooded her heart.

She suddenly felt as if there were a thousand mountains and rivers between herself and Yang Kai. He now stood high up amongst the clouds while she was still stuck on the ground looking up, unable to reach him at all.

Huo Xing Chen pursed his dry lips as he gave a wry smile while glancing over at Qiu Yi Meng, not knowing how he should comfort her.

Although the Qiu Family’s Young Matriarch had an outstanding aptitude and hadn’t needed to worry about cultivation resources after she came to Tong Xuan Realm, she was still just a Third-Order Transcendent now, not even reaching the point of True Qi Sanctification yet.

The gap was simply too big...

“The outside world is filled with so many unimaginable and exciting things, I’ll tell you all about them, but let’s go back first,” Yang Kai chuckled.

“En, en, let’s return first!” Yang Ying Feng nodded and yelled spiritedly.

This group of people then rushed back down to War Spirit Temple’s grounds.

Inside a grand hall, everyone sat together watching Yang Kai and listening to him talk about the strange and wonderful Star Field.

“Kai’er, are there really countless Cultivation Stars in the vast Star Field?” Ling Tai Xu asked in disbelief.

“En, I alone have visited around six or seven Cultivation Stars. In addition, there are Ore Stars and Medicine Stars suitable for mining ore and cultivating herbs,” Yang Kai nodded gently.

“Incredible,” Huo Xing Chen’s jaw dropped so far, he could nearly fit his fist inside.

“In the Star Field, are Saints weak?” Dong Qing Han asked timidly. After several dozen years, Fatty Dong was chubbier than ever.

“Very weak,” Yang Kai nodded solemnly, “In the Star Field, most cultivators can reach the Saint Realm, and those with good aptitude can do so by their twenties or thirties.”

Everyone looked at each other with a look of shame.

There was only one person sitting here who was a Saint, Ling Tai Xu, the Sect Master of High Heaven Pavilion. Others who had astounding aptitude, like Qiu Yi Meng, had only reached the Third-Order Transcendent Realm, while Fatty Dong and Huo Xing Chen had both just broken through to become Transcendents.

The younger generation here was nearly fifty years old and used to think highly of their own achievements, but now when Yang Kai talked about the situation in the Star Field, they couldn’t help feeling ashamed, wishing they could find holes to crawl into and hide.

“The frog at the bottom of the well is unaware of how vast the sky truly is!” Ling Tai Xu sighed deeply.

“Grand Master need not belittle himself so improperly. The cultivators in the Star Field can achieve this kind of feat because the World Energy of their Cultivation Stars is extraordinarily rich. Tong Xuan Realm, on the other hand... is not suitable for cultivators to grow on. If given the same cultivation conditions, everyone here would have no trouble breaking through to the Saint Realm,” Yang Kai said seriously.

“Even if that is so, isn’t it extremely difficult to enter the Star Field?” Ling Tai Xu slowly shook his head as he laughed at himself, “Truthfully, your Grand Master and Brother Meng joined forces to try to enter the Star Field ten years ago, but the two of us barely got a hundred thousand kilometres from Tong Xuan Realm before we were forced to retreat. There seems to be a kind of magical power flooding the Star Field that pressures one from all directions. If one’s physique is not strong enough, it seems they cannot even survive for long in that environment much less explore it.”

“The power of the Starry Sky,” Yang Kai gently nodded, but soon grinned and said, “But Grand Master need not worry about this. I’ve returned this time to take all of you to the Star Field, to a better Cultivation Star.”

Inside the hall, the expressions of everyone turned excited as they looked to Yang Kai in surprise.

“Really?”

“How are you going to do that?”

“There’s so many of us, can you really take all of us?”

Everyone asked in a rush, obviously interested, and extremely excited about what Yang Kai just told them. They could not wait to leave this backward place and travel to a star with far richer World Energy where they, just like Yang Kai, could see a wider and more wondrous world.
