When he used the Evil Purging Divine Spear, Yang Kai felt that its speed was slightly faster than before. This was clearly because of a change in Artifact Refining process.

The Evil Purging Divine Spear was fast, but Hong Hu was faster. By the time the streak of light shot towards him, Hong Hu was already prepared to react appropriately. His figure flickered about the room, dodging the oncoming streak of light.

Yang Kai didn’t care about his attack missing its target for this had happened dozens of times in the past two centuries. Having fought several dozen times with each other, they were already familiar with each other’s tricks and techniques.

With a surge of Yang Kai’s Divine Sense, the streak of light seemed to have been given life as it nimbly chased after Hong Hu like a shadow.

If they were in the vast void and Hong Hu was already on guard, Yang Kai might not be able to do anything to him; after all, the difference in their strength was still quite large. But they were in a secret underground room at the forward base, and although it was quite spacious, it still had boundaries.

In less than the time it took to drink half a cup of tea, Hong Hu, who had been dodging the streak of light all this time, was forced into a corner where he was unable to dodge in any way. Seeing the streak of light rapidly approaching him, a trace of ruthlessness flashed on his face as he unleashed a punch. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Even before his punch reached its target, dense Black Ink Strength emerged from his fist and instantly enveloped the Evil Purging Divine Spear.

Right then, pure white light bloomed from the tip of the spear, mostly dispersing the Black Ink Strength, but the streak of light didn’t slow down, not in the least, and shot straight into Hong Hu’s chest.

Even someone as strong as a Territory Lord had his skin and flesh torn apart by the streaking light as the Evil Purging Divine Spear pierced him. In the next instant, Hong Hu’s body went stiff before it started violently quivering as he let out a deafening cry, like a wounded beast.

The Purifying Light sealed in the Evil Purging Divine Spear had erupted!

Generally speaking, even though the Evil Purging Divine Spear had a certain degree of lethality, its ability to actually kill a Territory Lord was quite minimal. Nonetheless, its main focus was not to kill, but to inject Purifying Light into its target, which was the best weapon against the Black Ink Clan.

With a furious roar, Hong Hu grabbed the Evil Purging Divine Spear in his abdomen and fiercely removed it, drawing a fountain of blood with it. But Zhong Liang, who had been waiting all this time, rushed straight at him without giving Hong Hu any chance to breathe.

In the blink of an eye, the two of them became locked in a fierce battle, causing the surrounding barriers to wildly flash.

Yang Kai and Grandmaster Ma Fan quickly retreated until they were standing at the edge of the barrier.

The layers of shields in the underground room were enough to withstand the fight between Zhong Liang and Hong Hu for a while without being destroyed; of course, they would not be able to withstand the shockwaves from the battle between an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master and a Territory Lord forever, but it was already good enough.

Zhong Liang attacked with all kinds of lethal moves as a fearsome murderous intent radiated from him, forcing Hong Hu to focus on dealing with him. Under normal circumstances, even if a Territory Lord like Hong Hu couldn’t defeat Zhong Liang, he wouldn’t be defeated in a short time.

But this time, Zhong Liang only took an incense stick worth of time to beat Hong Hu to the point that his entire body was riddled with wounds and his aura was extremely weak. He did not have even a little bit of strength to fight back.

After a short while, Zhong Liang returned with a refreshed look on his face. Hong Hu’s enormous body lay limp on the ground like a corpse, his aura extremely feeble.

“20%!” Zhong Liang looked towards Grandmaster Ma Fan with an excited look on his face, “This is the result when Yang Boy used the Evil Purging Divine Spear and the Purifying Light had to be released before the spear hit its target. If an Eighth-Order Master like us were to use it, we should be able to bring out the full power of the Evil Purging Divine Spear. It should be somewhere between 20% and 30% effective in the field.”

Grandmaster Ma Fan let out a long sigh of relief, “Finally!”

Although this experiment could be already considered a success judging by the results, nothing was certain before they had obtained Zhong Liang’s evaluation.

After dozens of experiments and countless days of brainstorming and improvements over the past two centuries, the current Evil Purging Divine Spear was finally ready to be put into use on the battlefield.

A 20% suppressive ability was the criterion set by the higher-ups, because according to the Eighth-Order Master’s estimations, if the Evil Purging Divine Spear could reduce the strength of a Territory Lord by 20%, they could easily kill them.

If it was any less than 20%, it would greatly lower the chances of a kill. In that kind of situation, if the Territory Lord felt that things were not looking good for them, they would be able to escape. And once they had their guards up against the Evil Purging Divine Spear, the next time they used it, they would have lost the element of surprise and it would not be as effective.

20% might not seem much, but it was actually quite substantial. For instance, if Hong Hu’s strength had not been reduced by 20%, with the usual gap between Zhong Liang and Hong Hu’s strength, it would have taken the two at least half a day to determine a victor. But now, Zhong Liang only took an incense stick to beat Hong Hu up so badly that the latter couldn’t even fight back. If he wanted to, he could even have taken Hong Hu’s life.

Comparing the two situations, the Evil Purging Divine Spear played a decisive role.

“Grandmaster, many thanks for your hard work. After two centuries, the dark clouds have finally been dispelled and we can see the face of the Sun!” Zhong Liang gave a deep bow, “If we annihilate the entire Black Ink Clan someday, Grandmaster will have made the greatest contribution!”

Ma Fan waved his hand casually and humbly stated, “Humans and Black Ink Clan cannot coexist. This old man only did what he was supposed to do. This old man doesn’t care if it’s meritorious or not, just don’t forget what you promised me.”

Zhong Liang solemnly assured, “Of course not!”

Yang Kai didn’t know what kind of agreement Zhong Liang had with Grandmaster Ma Fan, but since it related to someone’s privacy, he wouldn’t rashly ask about it. The successful development of the Evil Purging Divine Spear had lifted his spirits. With this artifact, the Human Race’s crusade was just a matter of time, although much preparation would still need to be done.

Furthermore, if Yang Kai’s guess was correct, he would have his hands full in the near future.

As expected, Zhong Liang turned to look at Yang Kai and ordered, “The matter of the Evil Purging Divine Spear will need you to cooperate. The refining method of this artifact will soon be sent to all the Great Passes, so it won’t be long before a stockpile of Evil Purging Divine Spear will be sent to Blue Sky Pass. At that time, you will need to seal Purifying Light into all of them.”

The corners of Yang Kai’s brow twitched as he accepted his fate, “Junior understands.”

Once the refining method of the Evil Purging Divine Spear was made public, the other Passes would start mass-producing them. Any Artifact Refining Grandmaster could refine one, but only Yang Kai could seal Purifying Light in them.

Yang Kai could vaguely see painful days ahead of him.

The trio left the underground room after everything was settled. As for Hong Hu who was lying on the ground, no one paid him any attention.

Humans had spent a great deal of time and effort to capture him, even using Xiang Shan as bait to draw Hong Hu out and capture him alive so that Grandmaster Ma Fan could experiment on him.

The Humans kept him alive because he was the test subject for the Evil Purging Divine Spear, so he was useful. But now that the Evil Purging Divine Spear had been developed, there was naturally no need to keep him alive.

Furthermore, it was quite dangerous to imprison a Territory Lord in this place. Hong Hu was definitely doomed.

Yang Kai once again went into a retreat to cultivate. Since he knew that he wouldn’t have much free time in the future, he naturally treasured this opportunity all the more. Furthermore, both the forward base and Blue Sky Pass had been peaceful for a long time now, so there was nothing else he could do other than enter retreat.

Last time, when he visited Myriad Demons Pass, Yang Kai had received personal guidance from the Myriad Demons Heaven’s Old Ancestor, which greatly advanced his comprehension of the two Eye Techniques. Be that as it may, the cultivation of his Eye Secret Techniques required time. Before he left, the Myriad Demons Cave Heaven’s Old Ancestor gave him a jade slip which recorded his insights on these two Eye Techniques. This was a good opportunity for Yang Kai to carefully study them; in addition, cultivating the Eye Techniques would not interfere with refining cultivation materials and increasing his Small Universe’s heritage; he could do all of this simultaneously.

In the blink of an eye, five years went by.

Yang Kai was roused from his secluded cultivation. He exited the secret room and found a man waiting outside.

“Senior Brother Wang!” Yang Kai cupped his fist in greeting. Senior Brother Wang was Zhong Liang’s adjutant, a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Usually, whenever Zhong Liang had any orders, he would be the one to pass them on.

Since Senior Brother Wang had personally come to find him, it must be at the behest of Zhong Liang.

Sure enough, Senior Brother Wang reported, “Sir Army Commander has summoned you, Junior Brother. Please follow me.”

Yang Kai nodded and followed Senior Brother Wang to the Army Headquarters of the forward base. Zhong Liang was waiting for him, and when he saw Yang Kai arrive, he didn’t beat around the bush and went straight to the point, “It’s time. Return to Blue Sky Pass.”

Yang Kai immediately understood what was going on after hearing this and accepted the order right away, “Yes!”

Yang Kai did not leave immediately after accepting the order though; instead, he stood in his spot for a moment before suddenly waving his hand. The next moment, two figures appeared in front of him, a man and a woman, both of them at the peak of the Emperor Realm.

Zhong Liang’s eyes lit up at the sight of the two, “Another batch of good seedlings?”

The reason he said this was because Zhong Liang had seen this happen multiple times already. There were no Emperor Realm Masters on the Black Ink Battlefield. Everyone who arrived here was at least a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

Only Yang Kai’s Small Universe had Emperor Realm cultivators.

It had already been more than two centuries since Miao Fei Ping was brought to the Black Ink Battlefield by Yang Kai. Before that, Yang Kai had established the Void Dao Temple in his Small Universe to select outstanding geniuses. The flow of time in Yang Kai’s Small Universe was four times faster than the outside world, so while only two centuries had passed outside, 800 years had gone by in his Small Universe.

Over the past 800 years, the mortals of his Small Universe had already given birth to dozens of generations. The World Tree Clone had been very effective in nurturing these people and there were now many cultivators with outstanding aptitudes in Yang Kai’s Small Universe. Currently, there were thousands of disciples in the Void Dao Temple, all of whom could be said to be dragons amongst men, the best of the best.

It had to be known that the Void Dao Temple’s selection criteria were extremely harsh. Ordinary geniuses could not enter the Void Dao Temple, only geniuses among geniuses were qualified.

Those cultivating in the Void Dao Temple didn’t have to worry about food or clothing, nor did they lack cultivation resources, so their rate of growth was extremely fast. When they reached the peak of the Emperor Realm, the Void Dao Temple Master would explain to them the mysteries of the Open Heaven Realm and the outside world. If they wanted to improve further, Yang Kai would bring them out and allow them to advance to the Open Heaven Realm on the Black Ink Battlefield, becoming a part of Blue Sky Pass.

Over the past two centuries, over 100 cultivators had left Yang Kai’s Small Universe. On average, one would appear every two or three years. Each of them would advance straight to Sixth-Order. There had been two who had even broken through directly to the Seventh Order!

Directly to the Seventh Order! In other words, these two had a chance of reaching the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm in the future! Who wouldn’t be jealous of such talent?

In comparison, although those that directly advanced to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm would only be capable of reaching the Eighth-Order, these kinds of geniuses would still be Core Disciples in the various Cave Heavens and Paradises in the 3,000 Worlds. Every single one of them would enjoy the same kind of treatment as Qu Hua Shang and Gu Pan. Basically, geniuses like them would only appear once every century, but they actually appeared in batches from Yang Kai’s Small Universe.
