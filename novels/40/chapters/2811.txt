Bonfires danced merrily as the smell of barbeque filled the entire canyon. The villagers of the Flame Sickle Village and the villagers of the Blue South Village were chatting and laughing harmoniously. The two Shamans, who acted as their leaders, had set aside their differences and made peace with each other; thus, the villagers under them had put aside their vigilance and grudges to coexist peacefully.

The villagers of the Flame Sickle Village contributed the fruit wine they brought with them, allowing the villagers from both villages to eat and drink heartily. They were getting along so well that they were like one large family. Many men had even begun gathering around the beautiful women from the other village and were in the midst of courting them in hopes of leaving a beautiful memory behind in this valley.

On the other hand, Ah Hu and another villager from the Flame Sickle Village were competing in an impromptu arena.

There were few forms of entertainment in the daily lives of the Ancient Barbarian Race, with the most common form of entertainment being hand-to-hand combat. Besides, friendships among the Ancient Barbarian Race were formed from exchanging blows with each other. The villager from the Flame Sickle Village wrestling with Ah Hu was stronger, but Ah Hu was younger and had greater stamina. For a while, the fight between them was extremely close, and they could not distinguish who was better among them. It made the other clansmen that were watching nearby applaud and cheer.

Yang Kai cast his gaze at the battlefield and saw Ah Hu taking the opponent’s punch and bending over like a shrimp. However, Ah Hu took advantage of the moment the opponent carelessly rushed forward to end the battle to counterattack. He kicked the opponent’s knees, and in response, the Flame Sickle Village villager was caught off guard and knelt to the ground.

Then, Yang Kai turned back and asked, “Shaman Ya, is this the Shamanic Spell Shield you mentioned before?”

While speaking, he stretched his hand forward slightly and his Emperor Qi spread out. The air before him rippled slightly and turned into a transparent shield blocking in front of him.

Ya was so shocked that his jaw fell open. Only a long while later did he finally nod, “En. That’s it!”

“So, that’s how you do it!” Yang Kai nodded and continued, “But, this Shamanic Spell Shield can only defend against a Shamanic Spell one realm lower than your own cultivation. If a Shaman in the same realm casts a Shamanic Spell at you, this Shamanic Spell Shield won’t be able to withstand the attack.”

Ya replied, “At the very least, it will give me some time to dodge to the side. During critical moments, this spell can save one’s life!”

Yang Kai said, “That makes sense. However, don’t you think it’s better if we cast the Shamanic Spell Shield in this manner instead?”

As he spoke, he demonstrated what he meant…

Meanwhile, Ya felt like he was going to go crazy! After talking to Ah Niu, he found that the other party’s understanding of Shaman Spells and Shaman Strength was extremely shallow. Moreover, Yang Kai could not cast many of the commonly used Shamanic Spells. It was as if he had only become a Shaman recently and was still ignorant of his own abilities. However, this boy’s comprehension and creativity were beyond shocking.

Ya had explained and demonstrated several commonly used Shamanic Spells for him, and in turn, the other party absorbed the knowledge instantly and duplicated the Shamanic Spells all but perfectly on the first try. If not for Yang Kai’s sincere expression and lack of malicious intent, Ya might have suspected that Yang Kai was just pretending to be dumb.

Furthermore, not only was Yang Kai capable of quickly learning and improving these kinds of commonly used Shamanic Spells, his casting speed and the power of the spells he modified elevated them to a whole new level! How was he just a High-Rank Shaman Apprentice? Only Shaman Grandmasters could achieve such feats, right?

As a Mid-Rank Shaman Warrior, Ya had only been able to imitate what he learned and follow in the footsteps of his predecessors. He had no ability to improve the Shamanic Spells he learned. Even so, he witnessed various miracles, one after another, coming from this Shaman known as ‘Shaman Niu’.

Throughout the night, the two Shamans sat together and exchanged knowledge continuously with both sides gaining much. Yang Kai learned several simple and practical Shamanic Spells, while on the other hand, Ya gained a deeper understanding of those Shamanic Spells through Yang Kai’s inspiration and demonstration. Although his realm had not advanced, Ya’s strength had risen sharply. As long as he was given some time to absorb what he learned today, Ya would be able to fight back slightly even if he encountered a High-Rank Shaman Warrior in the future.

At dawn, the people from both villages prepared to set out, parting ways at the entrance of the canyon.

Ya looked at Yang Kai with some reluctance to part and said, “Shaman Niu, please be sure to visit the Flame Sickle Village one day. We will definitely entertain you and your clansmen with the best food we have!”

Yang Kai chuckled, “Sure. You should also visit the Blue South Village, Shaman Ya.”

Ya’s eyes lit up at those words, “Good! I’ll definitely visit you when the snow melts and spring comes!”

“Until we meet again!” Yang Kai cupped his fists.

Ya looked startled. Although he didn’t know what etiquette this was, he clumsily imitated the gesture.

After that, Yang Kai turned around, grabbed the hind legs of two wild beasts, and dragged them along the snow-covered ground, leading a hundred villagers behind him and gradually disappearing into the distance.

Ya watched Yang Kai’s departure and murmured, “I seem to be witnessing the birth of a new star!”

“What?” A clansman next to him asked.

“It’s nothing! Let’s go home!” Ya waved his hand. Following that, the villagers of the Flame Sickle Village each dragged a beast and returned home with a good haul.

…..

It was not easy for a person to drag two beasts behind them while running in the snow. Therefore, the group from Blue South Village only managed to return from the canyon to the village two days later. The hundred villagers were warmly welcomed back as heroes before everyone began processing the beasts for storage. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

During that time, the Village Chief walked over on shaky legs and asked if anything happened during this trip, to which Ah Hu told the Village Chief about their encounter with the people from Flame Sickle Village.

When the Village Chief heard the whole story, he nodded at Yang Kai and said, “You did a good job, Ah Niu. Although we come from different clans, we are all from the same race. We shouldn’t be stingy when others are in need and we are able to help.”

“I think so too,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Good. You must be tired. Why don’t you go back and take a rest? I will speak with you again tomorrow.”

The next day, Yang Kai went to meet the Village Chief early in the morning.

“Ah Niu, I want you to be the Village Chief of Blue South Village. What do you think?” The Village Chief cut to the chase as soon as they met.

Yang Kai was stunned for a moment, but quickly refused the suggestion, “That won’t work…”

“Don’t be in such a hurry to reject!” The Village Chief smiled slightly as if he had expected this reaction, sighing as he said, “Let me finish first.”

Yang Kai nodded.

Only then did the Village Chief continue, “I am old and won’t live for much longer, so you can formally take over as the Village Chief after I die. Originally, I was worried that this village would have to be taken in by other villages since it lacked a Shaman’s protection. You know as well as I do what kind of life awaits a village that is taken in by others. Fortunately, you were blessed by the Barbarian Gods and unlocked your Shaman Strength. Moreover, you are now a High-Rank Shaman Apprentice, which is one minor realm higher than me. You are fully capable of taking over as the Village Chief. I admit that you are still young and I was initially worried about leaving the position of Village Chief to you, but after seeing how you dealt with the Flame Sickle Village, I know that you will not disappoint me or the villagers in the future. You are kind, honest, and intelligent. I’m sorry I never noticed that before. That’s why I believe you will be a better Village Chief than I ever was. More importantly, the villagers already trust you and will follow you.”

After experiencing the invasion of the Beast Tide and the confrontation with Shaman Ya, the clansmen in the village had grown to respect Yang Kai greatly. Therefore, no one would say anything if he took over as the Village Chief.

Yang Kai shook his head in response, “Village Chief, I can’t agree to this matter.”

“Why?” The Village Chief showed a disappointed expression, not having expected Yang Kai to refuse after everything he said.

Yang Kai sighed. [I can’t just say I came to this Sealed World to cultivate… I don’t even know whether the Village Chief or these villagers are real or just elaborate illusions… In any case, I will have to leave this place one day.]

“I want to go out and see the world while I am still young. I probably won’t stay in the village for much longer.” Yang Kai quickly came up with a plausible excuse.

“You… Want to leave the village?” The Village Chief looked at Yang Kai in surprise; however, he quickly seemed to understand, “That’s true. Your aptitude is extraordinary, so being stuck in this village won’t benefit you much. You should go out and see the world, that would be what is best for your growth.”

“I’m sorry, Village Chief.”

The Village Chief smiled lightly, “Don’t be sorry. Your home will always be a part of Blue South Village, no matter where you go. Good, let’s not talk about this anymore. Let’s study.”

After that, the Village Chief taught Yang Kai to recognize those strange-looking ancient characters as always, as if nothing had happened just now.

Snow started falling two days after Yang Kai led the villagers back to the village from the canyon, and the whole world turned into a frozen land. Under such circumstances, even the beasts were reluctant to leave their caves without good reason, let alone people. All the villagers holed up inside their houses and rarely came out.

During this time, Yang Kai’s daily life went by with a fixed routine. He learned the ancient characters from the Village Chief for an hour in the morning, then he returned to his log house to cultivate his body. Later, he would accumulate his Shaman Strength.

Ten days later, he felt himself breaking through a barrier in his body. Power surged through his meridians, and his strength seemed to soar. He had just become a Shaman Warrior!

When he awoke his Shaman Strength, it only took Yang Kai one night to become a High-Rank Shaman Apprentice; however, he now took half a month to go from a High-Rank Shaman Apprentice to Low-Rank Shaman Warrior.

Over the past ten days, Yang Kai had been waiting for this Sealed World to kick him out, but for some reason, it had yet to do so. It had reached a point where he was beginning to doubt if he had really fallen into the Sealed World or was unable to break out of this Sealed World. Regardless of what it was, he had to make plans for the long term.

[This world is very strange and is suppressing my Emperor Qi. I can’t even release my Divine Sense or access my Space Ring either.]

According to the Village Chief, he would only gain something like a Divine Sense when he raised his power to the realm of a Shaman Master. Therefore, Yang Kai’s current goal was to quickly cultivate until he became a Shaman Master. Then, he could access his Space Ring and retrieve the millions of Monster Cores stored inside it. As long as he had those Monster Cores, he would be able to exponentially increase his cultivation speed. At that time, becoming a Shaman King or even a Shaman Saint would be a simple matter. Perhaps, he might even find a way to escape this world once his Shaman Strength reached a certain level.

Unfortunately, Yang Kai would need to rise an entire Great Realm to reach the Shaman Master realm. At his current cultivation speed, he estimated that it would take him another year to do so, and he simply couldn’t afford to wait that long!

Stuck inside this inexplicable Sealed World, Yang Kai felt strongly that his own strength was the foundation of his survival. Thus, he couldn’t wait to become stronger.

The best way to improve his strength would be to find Monster Beasts, obtain their flesh and blood, and retrieve their Monster Cores. The Monster Core was the most important part. Yang Kai could now consume them directly to increase his strength quickly, so as long as he had enough Monster Cores, breaking through to become a Shaman Master would be as easy as snapping his fingers.
