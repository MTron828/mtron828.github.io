In front of his simple wooden house, Yang Kai’s right arm dripped with red blood as golden blood leaked from the corner of his mouth, making for a terrifying picture as he tightly clenched Zhou Yi’s still-beating heart.

Zhou Yi was still bound tightly by the net of Golden Blood Threads as he stared at Yang Kai in front of him with dilated eyes.

Madman! This Junior Brother of his was an absolute lunatic! Zhou Yi kept screaming in his heart.

The two maintained such a stalemate, motionless.

An extremely solemn atmosphere filled the air, making it almost impossible to even breathe.

Not far away, Liu Xian Yun covered her mouth with her small hands as her beautiful eyes shook violently, while Chu Fei and the other two Origin Kings stood there gulping hard.

“Heh heh, it seems this is your loss, Senior Brother!” Yang Kai grinned suddenly.

Zhou Yi’s face twitched slightly and although he was full of unwillingness, there was no doubt that his life was currently no longer his to control.

As long as Yang Kai exerted a little bit more force, he can take his life.

“If you kill me, you’ll die too!” Zhou Yi stared at Yang Kai coldly but did not even try to beg for mercy, instead making threats.

“Are you willing to bet on that? Let’s see if I can leave this damned place after I kill you! Junior Brother may not be very strong, but he is confident in his ability to escape!” Yang grinned wickedly as Zhou Yi shut his mouth, not daring to speak for fear that this crazy Junior Brother of his would really crush his heart.

If that happened, it wouldn’t matter to him if Yang Kai lived or died because he would already be dead regardless. Everyone had only one life, so Zhou Yi didn’t dare to risk his.

“If you dare to move, I’ll kill him immediately!” Yang Kai suddenly turned his head and stared coldly at Chu Fei who seemed to be trying to escape.

Only after Yang Kai spoke, did Liu Xian Yun suddenly recover from her shock and with a flicker she arrived in front of Chu Fei to stare at him vigilantly in case he took the opportunity to escape.

Chu Fei felt like crying in anguish as he really didn’t dare to move now.

“You seem like a smart person, and obviously you don’t want to fight a battle where everyone dies in the end, right? Draw back and Senior Brother will let this matter drop,” Zhou Yi’s expression narrowed as he stared at Yang Kai in front of him and spoke.

Yang Kai snickered, “Naturally, I don’t want to die, but with things having gotten to this point, there can be no good end. Senior Brother, what do you think would be best, killing you now and fleeing... or killing you and waiting to see what punishment the Sect metes out? And do not spout any nonsense about not finding trouble with me again if I let you go, only a fool would believe such drivel.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Zhou Yi’s face went gloomy as he did not know how to answer.

“Forget it,” Yang Kai suddenly laughed cheerfully and said. “We should settle accounts here first before discussing what comes next.”

Saying so, he turned his head and looked at Chu Fei and his minions, his eyes gradually becoming cold, “In the end, you’re the reason all of this happened. Whether it was me being confined for three months or this incident, it’s all your fault. Since that’s the case, let’s start by having you kneel down and slap yourselves while calling yourselves pigs!”

As soon as this statement came out, Chu Fei and the others’ complexions changed drastically.

“You... don’t go too far!” Chu Fei screamed. Although this place was relatively remote and there were usually very few people who came and went from here, if he really obeyed Yang Kai’s command, how would he be able to show his face in the Sect in the future? This story would immediately be passed out to every disciple and he would degenerate into a complete laughing stock.

“We’d sooner die than suffer such humiliation!” The Second-Order Origin King also yelled, his face filled with anger.

“Is that so?” Yang Kai smiled slightly before ignoring Chu Fei and the others, instead turning to look at Zhou Yi while slowly tightening his grip, “Senior Brother, Senior Brother Chu doesn’t seem to want to cooperate, so what should we do now? Junior Brother currently has his hands full and cannot force them to comply, which is annoying him greatly. If by some chance Junior Brother were to lose control and apply too much strength...”

Zhou Yi immediately began oozing big beads of sweat from his forehead. He could already feel the pressure on his heart growing stronger and stronger, causing his breathing to become a bit hurried. Quickly turning his head, he yelled at Chu Fei and the others in a panic, “The guilty must pay for their own crimes, this matter was caused by you three so you cannot just stand by and feign innocence. If I die, I die, but if I, Zhou Yi, can escape this disaster, you should understand what fate you’ll endure.”

As soon as Zhou Yi spoke, Chu Fei and the others could not help turning pale as all of them turned hate-filled yet imploring looks towards Yang Kai, as if praying he would show them mercy and spare them.

Yang Kai of course turned a blind eye to them as he continued to increase the strength of his grip.

“You haven’t kneeled down yet?!” Zhou shouted.

Chu Fei and the others didn’t dare to hesitate, and all fell to their knees, their expressions uglier than if they were about to die.

Shame, such great shame!

Regardless of anything else, they were Origin King Realm cultivators. Fighting and being injured was a common matter to them, but when had they ever been forced to kneel? Each of them cursed out Yang Kai in their hearts as they all secretly vowed to find a chance in the future to repay this humiliation a hundredfold, otherwise how could they purge the hatred in their hearts.

“Why don’t I hear the sound of faces being slapped?” Yang Kai turned his ear to the side with a puzzled look on his face.

Zhou Yi’s fierce eyes immediately floated over towards Chu Fei and others.

*Pa pa pa...*

Chu Fei and his followers lifted their hands and slapped their cheeks numbly.

“What else?” Yang Kai continued to sneer.

Chu Fei felt his blood boil as his heart seized, almost causing him to pass out from rage and making him wish he could rush out and fight Yang Kai to the death, but because of Zhou Yi’s despotic power, how could he dare show any trace of resistance?

Steeling himself, with a face as ugly as if he was crying, he began to shout.

“I am a pig, wu wu...”

With Chu Fei taking the lead, the remaining two naturally did not dare to hold their silence and so a grand spectacle played out. Three Blue Feather Sect disciples knelt on the ground, slapping themselves while calling themselves pigs. This kind of humiliation was a hundred times worse than any torture the Sect would use as punishment.

“I should not have provoked Junior Brother Yang, I am a pig!”

“I’m a pig, Junior Brother Yang, please show mercy and spare us this time.”

...

“En, very good,” Yang Kai laughed with satisfaction, “Even if things were a bit forced, it’s good.”

“Is that enough?” Zhou Yi looked at Yang Kai coldly, his teeth grinding so hard they seemed they would shatter as the hatred in his eyes was so thick it was almost tangible.

“Senior Brother, you’re really fierce!” Yang Kai immediately put on a frightened look, “Junior Brother is quite timid, so please don’t stare at him like that. If Junior Brother becomes flustered, he might accidentally crush your heart...”

Zhou Yi closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and when he opened them again, they were dull and indifferent as he quickly said, “Junior Brother Yang, it was Senior Brother that had eyes but failed to see and angered you today. We should let this matter stop here. In the end, we’re both fellow Sect Brothers, so we should not raise our hands against...”

Before he could finish speaking though, Yang Kai suddenly lifted his left hand and slapped him.

*Pa...* A blood-red palm print appeared on Zhou Yi’s cheek and even a few teeth were knocked out.

“Now you say we’re fellow Brothers? We should not raise our hands against one another? Why didn’t you think so when you tried to attack me just now!”

“You......”

“You what?” Yang Kai slapped out again. Zhou Yi instinctively wanted to resist, but feeling the grip on his heart tightening, he did not and could only receive this second slap willingly. The anger which he had just forced down was instantly rekindled and his eyes became bloodshot.

“If you utter another word, I will slap you, and if you keep staring at me like this, I’ll punch you like this,” Yang Kai punched out, hitting Zhou Yi’s eyes, blackening them.

Zhou Yi finally held his tongue, knowing that Yang Kai was completely insane and could not be provoked. Showing any signs of resistance or anger now would only cause him to suffer. With no other option, Zhou Yi simply lowered his head, so he didn’t have to look at Yang Kai. At the same time, he was already thinking up just how he would torture Yang Kai in the future to wash off this insult.

“Xian Yun, is he the one who hurt you?” Yang Kai suddenly asked an inexplicable question.

Liu Xian Yun’s expression changed, opening her mouth as if she wanted to say something, but she just nodded in the end.

It wasn’t difficult for Yang Kai to guess this; after all, he understood Liu Xian Yun’s strength well and knew it was impossible for Chu Fei to have wounded her so. The only person who had such ability was this Zhou Yi.

Yang Kai nodded indifferently before grinning, “As a Senior Brother in the Sect, not only did you not take care of your Junior Brother and Sister who were newly recruited, you deliberately bullied and oppressed them. Senior Brother Zhou Yi, you’re a true role model.”

When his words fell, Yang Kai’s left fist flew and beat Zhou Yi violently.

Zhou Yi had no ability to resist and could only endure Yang Kai’s abrupt beating.

Although Yang Kai’s cultivation was a Minor Realm lower than his own, his physical strength was extremely strong so the force behind each fist could not be ignored. As such, it was not long before Zhou Yi’s face had become swollen and bruised, deformed to the point it was miserable to look at.

Suddenly, Zhou Yi laughed coldly and said in no uncertain terms, “Boy, if you don’t kill me today, you’ll pay for this in the future.”

Yang Kai frowned, looked out into the distance thoughtfully, then coldly snorted and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll be sure to kill you before I die!”

At that moment, he had sensed a master rapidly approaching their position.

This was not a surprise, of course, as it had been some time since this incident had begun and word of it had surely spread throughout Blue Feather Sect by now, so Yang Kai expected someone to come sooner or later.

What he didn’t expect was that the master who came would be so powerful. Even from so far away, the pressure Yang Kai felt was not weaker than that of Bian Yu Qing’s.

[Which Protector has come?] Yang Kai could not stop his expression from sinking.

Soon, Liu Xian Yun also sensed the approach of this master and her beautiful eyes could not help looking at Yang Kai with worry; after all, the trouble he had gotten into was indeed a bit fierce. Meanwhile, Chu Fei and his two minions were still kneeling on the ground slapping themselves while calling themselves pigs.

A moment later, a profound streak of light appeared and came to a halt up in the sky not far from where Yang Kai and the other stood. When the light faded, a number of figures were revealed.

Terrifying coercion fell from the sky, making it difficult for everyone to breathe and causing their bodies to sink, as if a great mountain was pressing down on them.
