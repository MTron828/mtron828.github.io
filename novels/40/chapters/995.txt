Chapter 995, You Dare Come Back

Inside a luxurious room aboard the Purple Star Starship, a short, sallow-skinned old man held a communication type artifact in front of himself and poured his Divine Sense into it, trying to contact Ke Meng in the power room, but no matter who he tried to reach, he received no response.

“What happened?” The old man wiped the sweat from his forehead and stomped his foot.

After a moment of hesitation, he hurriedly opened his door and prepared to go down to the power room personally to see the situation.

But just as he opened the door, he saw two youths emitting clear malicious intention flying towards his direction.

The old man didn’t think too much about this though and simply called out to the two youths, “You two, come here!”

Shen Tu, who was leading the way, let out a cry of surprise and said, “It’s this old man, he’s the Chart Master on this Starship! I saw him go in and out of the power room some time ago!”

Yang Kai nodded lightly and followed after Shen Tu, quickly arriving beside the old man.

“What’s going on in the power room, why isn’t Ke Meng responding to this old master’s call?” The old man roared angrily.

Shen Tu just grinned back at him, revealing a gloomy smile as he said, “Ke Meng is dead, so of course he won’t respond to your messages!”

The old man’s expression filled with surprise at these words and suddenly realized that something wasn’t right. Just as he was about to turn back and return to his room, a lightning snake appeared from Shen Tu’s body and quickly wrapped around the old man’s body, binding him tightly.

The powerful lightning arc caused the old man’s body to go stiff and numb.

“Carry him!” Shen Tu looked around and saw that no one else as nearby before he turned towards a certain direction and sped off.

Yang Kai’s face became cold as he grabbed the old man tied up in the lightning rope and faintly said, “If you want to live, you’d better cooperate, or I’ll kill you!”

Although the Chart Master of this Purple Star Starship wasn’t young, his strength wasn’t very high, only reaching the Third Order Transcendent Realm, so it was easy for Shen Tu, and Yang Kai to capture him.

Ordinary Chart Masters didn’t possess high cultivations because they dedicated most of their time and energy to studying the mysteries of the Starry Sky and producing Star Charts.

This also caused them to not have any self-protection ability when they fell into danger.

“Who are you?” The old man asked sternly.

“Who we are is none of your concern. So long as you take us out of the Chaotic Abyss, everything will be fine, once we leave this place, we will naturally let you go, I promise you!” Shen Tu spun around and said flatly.

“Good, I’ll lead you away, but you must take me to the Starship’s power room first, otherwise we’ll all end up dead!” The old man hurriedly shouted.

Shen Tu sneered, “Do you think we’re idiots? We just managed to escape from the power room, and now that place is filled with Purple Star’s masters, are we supposed to go there and meekly accept death?”

“You don’t understand, naturally I have a good reason for insisting on going to the power room, this has nothing to do with you letting yourselves get caught!” The old man said desperately, “If you don’t take me there now, not only will we three die, even this Starship will be destroyed.”

“What do I care if this Starship can’t be saved?” Shen Tu’s snickered, taking pleasure in Purple Star’s misfortune.

“How can I convince you... There is a huge danger brewing outside that will soon sweep across the entire Chaotic Abyss, if we don’t act quickly, no one here will survive.”

Shen Tu came to a halt and turned back towards the old man, “What do you mean? Speak clearly.”

“Just look outside for yourself!” The old man didn’t answer but instead gestured towards the outside. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Shen Tu and Yang Kai both exchanged a glance and felt that this old man wasn’t simply being an alarmist, the two of them casting their eyes through one of the windows in the corridor in the next moment.

Outside, it was the same scene of massive and beautiful stars, but right now, the incredibly rich World Energy field seemed to have taken on a hazy quality, appearing somewhat like an illusory fog.

The powerful domains produced by the various stars also seemed to be fluctuating as well.

All the cultivators from Sword Union and Purple Star, who were originally heavily engaged in a battle to the death, had ceased all combat and were instead fleeing with all haste towards their respective Starships.

“What happened? They’re all returning now,” Shen Tu expression changed greatly, “It couldn’t be because of the crystal cannon barrage I just shot, right?”

Yang Kai looked at him faintly but said nothing.

Shen Tu seemed somewhat embarrassed and shrugged, “I didn’t expect things to turn out like this, I just wanted to vent some of my anger...”

“I don’t think it has anything to do with what you did. If it was, the Sword Union cultivators wouldn’t also be retreating but instead chasing after them; but right now, both sides are withdrawing. They should be aware of the coming danger,” Yang Kai turned his attention to the old man in his hand and quickly asked, “What is this danger?”

“A domain eruption! You can’t feel it from inside here, but all of those people are coming back because they sensed the drastic change in the energy domains of the Chaotic Abyss’ stars. None of them dares stay outside now, they should only want to return to their ships as quickly as possible to flee from here. If they’re too late, even if they hide inside this Starship, they won’t be safe!”

“A domain eruption?” Shen Tu’s face sank.

“The Chaotic Abyss’ greatest danger!” The old man explained hurriedly, “Do you think that the chaotic and disorienting energy fields here simply cause one to lose their sense of direction? You’re very wrong, the stars in the Chaotic Abyss contain unimaginable World Energy, and once the World Energy in the surrounding space reaches a state of saturation, exceeding the limit of what this region can withstand, the delicate balance they normally maintain collapses and all that energy explodes. As for what happens next, I’m sure you can both imagine, yes?”

Yang Kai and Shen Tu both gasped and went deathly pale.

“Can’t you understand!?” The old man yelled, his spit flying out, showing not the slightest awareness of being a prisoner.

“Do you understand?” Shen Tu asked quietly.

“Nonsense! This old master is a Chart Master. If this old master doesn’t understand what’s happening, who would?” The old man shouted and scolded Shen Tu.

“Since you saw this coming, why didn’t you stop the two sides from fighting? Isn’t it because of their fight that the balance between the fields was broken?” Yang Kai shot him a cold glare.

The old man quickly averted his eyes and awkwardly said, “I only noticed after they started fighting. This old master’s Stargazing Technique isn’t omnipotent, how could I have known things would become so dangerous so quickly?”

“Stargazing Technique?” Yang Kai’s brow rose.

“The technique’s Chart Masters use to study the mysteries of the Starry Sky. I’ll explain to you some other time, but right now, what should we do? This old guy doesn’t look like he’s lying,” Shen Tu hesitated.

If what this old man was saying was true, then all the effort he and Yang Kai had put into silently catching this old man was for nothing, once the Chaotic Abyss’s domain eruption occurred, there would be nowhere for them to run or hide.

As long as they stayed inside the Starship, they would at least have another layer of protection.

This was a Saint King High-Rank Starship after all!

However, with all of Purple Star’s surviving masters about to return to the Starship, staying here wasn’t exactly a good plan either.

“Your thoughts are quite sharp, aren’t they? You make the decision,” Shen Tu said to Yang Kai with an expectant gaze, seemingly hoping he would have some brilliant way out of this mess.

“What’s the status of this Chart Master in Purple Star?” Yang Kai asked suddenly.

“His position is extremely high!” Shen Tu looked towards the old man, “Grandmaster Wu Suo’s ability to create Star Charts ranks among the top three in all of Purple Star and is someone that the other major forces have constantly tried to win over.”

“Do you know this old master?” The old man looked at Shen Tu with clear surprise.

“I’ve heard of you,” Shen Tu grinned.

“Let’s go to the power room,” Yang Kai quickly said.

Shen Tu’s expression cramped and seemed to hesitate, but after carefully thinking about it for a while, he nodded and said, “Agreed, if what he said is true, going outside is no different from courting death.”

“Let’s go!” Yang Kai lifted up the Chart Master called Wu Suo and headed back to the power room.

The corridor outside the power room was overcrowded, with the cultivators who were outside just now battling and the ones who had stayed behind in the Starship all gathered around, wondering who it was that fired the crystal cannons a moment ago, not only killing many of their enemies but also many of their own people as well.

They were all enraged because, if their luck had been a bit worse, they might have been killed just now.

However, after seeing the situation in the power room, their anger suddenly froze up.

There was no one living inside the power room, Ke Meng and the dozen other Saint Realm cultivators had been killed by some unknown enemy.

Inside the power room, a middle-aged man in fine robes with his hands folded behind his back glared around with an angry expression, his pair of sharp eyes soon landing on two pairs of opened shackles, causing him to let out a gloomy snort, “Wastes!”

With his eyesight, it was natural for him to see how Ke Meng had died, and although he didn’t know exactly what had transpired, he could make a fairly accurate guess.

One of the cultivators who had been locked up in those shackles had launched a sneak attack, butchered Ke Meng, snatched the key, released his companion, and then swept through the power room. After killing everyone, these two rats had taken control of the Starship, then shot that crystal cannon barrage, causing the Purple Star cultivators to suffer great losses.

[Ke Meng, that waste, his death isn’t worthy pitying!]

The middle-aged man was infuriated.

Just as he was about to order his subordinates to search the ship for the escapees, a loud voice suddenly resounded outside the power room, “Who are you! Release Grandmaster Wu Suo immediately, or else!”

The middle-aged man’s eyes became gloomy as he looked up.

A cynical and arrogant voice soon echoed, “Make way, make way! Clear a path and don’t get any funny ideas, the moment you try anything, Grandmaster Wu Suo dies!”

A moment later, a group of three figures strolled into the power room.

Two strange youths walked in, one of them wearing a self-important look upon his face while the other wore an indifferent expression while tightly grasping Wu Suo’s shoulder, his Divine Sense and Saint Qi both covering the latter, ready to strike at any moment.

The middle-aged man’s eyes shrank as he shouted, “You dare come back?”

Although he had never met or even seen Yang Kai or Shen Tu, the middle-aged man was certain these two were the rats who had escaped from the power room and fired the crystal cannons, killing several dozen Purple Star cultivators in the process.

Glaring at them, the middle-aged man’s wrath soared towards the Heavens and he couldn’t wait to palm them to death to vent the rage in his heart.
