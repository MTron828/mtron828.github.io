Chapter 1499, The Array Plate’s Power

Standing in place, Yang Kai’s eyes were as sharp as a blade with cold light overflowing from them.

Obviously, he had become truly enraged.

“Boy, it seems this is the extent of your ability! You should refrain from shamelessly boasting in the future! Young people who do not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth always have to suffer a bit to see the reality. I advise you to surrender now without a fight!” Fang Peng laughed loudly, the muscles on his face twitching slightly as he did, but no one noticed.

Although he made light of Yang Kai, he was actually quite shocked in his heart.

[This little brat is a monster!] A trivial First-Order Origin Realm cultivator was able to withstand the indiscriminate bombardment of more than twenty Origin Returning Realm masters. Although he had only managed to resist for ten breaths, that was already enough to be called a miracle.

Even Fang Peng did not dare say he could do this. Did that mean the strength of this boy was comparable to his own then?

Moreover, Fang Peng had heard that Yang Kai was just a Third-Order Saint when he first arrived on Shadowed Star, yet after just ten years, he had now broken through to the Origin Returning Realm!

This rate of growth was astonishing.

No cultivator on Shadowed Star could achieve such terrifying growth in such a short period of time.

No cultivator could have such terrible combat power compared to their realm!

When Fang Peng looked at Yang Kai, it was as if he saw infinite possibilities and hope, hope to break through to the Origin King Realm!

This boy could not be allowed to grow anymore. He was already so terrifying with such low cultivation, so if he were really allowed to fully mature, who on Shadowed Star could possibly oppose him?

Today, Heaven Battling Union and Thunder Typhoon Sect had thoroughly offended him, and if he had the opportunity in the future, he would definitely return it back a hundredfold. From the look in his eyes, Fang Peng could tell that Yang Kai was not one to easily forget his grudges.

[This boy must die!]

Fang Peng’s heart filled with murderous intent and dread as he secretly decided to kill Yang Kai once the task assigned by Star Emperor Mountain this time was completed. As long as this boy was alive, Fang Peng would have trouble just sleeping and eating.

“He’s already an arrow at the end of its flight, capture him!” Fang Peng shouted decisively. A long delay led to many problems, so he didn’t plan on hesitating.

When these words fell, half of the Origin Returning Realm masters rushed towards Yang Kai while the other half remained in place to prevent him from escaping.

In a blink, more than a dozen masters had approached to within ten metres of Yang Kai. At that moment though, the frustrated, hate-filled expression on Yang Kai’s face, as if he was incapable of fighting back any longer, suddenly transformed into a grin and he roared out in a furious voice.

“There was a path to the Heavens but you refused to take it, no gate to Hell but you still charged in. Since that’s the case, I will send you to the underworld myself!”

As he spoke, Yang Kai took out a wooden token the size of a palm. This wooden token had several complicated and subtle patterns carved onto it and radiated a mysterious power and brilliant, blinding light that.

“Not good!” Someone exclaimed, hurriedly wanting to withdraw.

But it was too late. The brilliant light which was being emitted by the wooden token suddenly spread to the surroundings and the dozen or so Origin Returning Realm masters near Yang Kai were engulfed in the next instant.

In the blink of an eye, these dozen Origin Returning Realm masters found themselves in a different world.

White clouds filled the sky as lush grass and trees surrounded them.

Everyone was stunned, with blank expressions filling their faces, unable to comprehend what their situation was.

At the same time, Fang Peng and the dozen or so Origin Returning Realm masters who did not move were also shocked as they stared blankly towards the scene in front of them.

In that instant, Yang Kai and a dozen of their companions had disappeared together without a trace. When the white light enveloped them, everyone seemed to disappear into thin air.

This was truly strange.

However, in the place where Yang Kai originally stood, there were some odd energy fluctuations.

An old man wearing Thunder Typhoon Sect robes and possessing a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation frowned, as if he had noticed something, and raised his hand to attack. However, this attack only flew out a short distance before it was blocked by a thin invisible barrier.

“A Spirit Array!” The old man’s eyes bulged as he exclaimed in shock.

“Why is there a Spirit Array here?” Fang Peng’s expression was also ugly to the extreme. They had just driven Yang Kai into a corner and were on the verge of capturing him, but now this unexpected development had occurred.

Yang Kai and a dozen or so cultivators from their side were trapped inside this Spirit Array! People outside of the Spirit Array could not see them at all and were also blocked from entering it, so even if they wanted to rush in to assist their companions, they couldn’t.

But how could there be Spirit Array here?

If it had been here all along, it should have been triggered long ago, and it was even more impossible for it to suddenly activate at this critical moment. Could it be that Yang Kai was aware of it, gained control of it, and had been planning to use it when a crisis broke out?

This was also highly unlikely!

“Sect Master, this Spirit Array shouldn’t have been arranged here,” The old man seemed to have studied Spirit Arrays and was able to see some clues.

“It wasn’t arranged here?” Fang Peng frowned and looked at him, “Elder Zou, what do you mean? If this Spirit Array was not arranged here to begin with, are you saying that brat Yang Kai suddenly just arranged it?”

“It should be so,” Elder Zou gently nodded.

Fang Peng coldly snorted and said, “Although this old master doesn’t know much about Spirit Arrays, he at least knows that such a powerful Spirit Array cannot be easily arranged. Let’s not talk about all the auxiliary tools required to do this, just the amount of time required should be far greater than the instant that boy was provided, so how could he have instantly arranged a Spirit Array?”

“Sect Master, I believe the answer lies with that wooden token that boy took out,” Elder Zou said thoughtfully, “If this old master is correct, then that wooden token is very likely to be a long lost, legendary Array Plate!”

“Array Plate?” Fang Peng’s eyes narrowed, apparently having heard about Array Plates at some point. Staring at the old man surnamed Zou in amazement, he could not help asking, “Are you sure it was such a thing?”

“Besides this, this old master cannot think of another suitable reason to explain why this boy was able to instantly arrange such a Spirit Array. That wooden token was most likely an Array Plate with a Spirit Array sealed inside of it. Moreover, it is an extremely powerful Spirit Array.”

“How could he possibly have such a thing?” Fang Peng’s face went pale, “Can you crack this array?”

Elder Zou hesitated for a moment before answering, “If this old man was given two days, he would be able to crack it. Just now, this old man probed this Spirit Array slightly and discovered that it was quite powerful, so... two days is the fastest.”

“Two days...” Fang Peng smiled bitterly.

Such a long time was enough for spilt blood to go cold.

“It doesn’t matter what Spirit Array it is; we can just destroy it!” An angry shout suddenly rang out, causing Fang Peng’s look to shake. Turning his head, Fang Peng discovered that the speaker was Qu Zheng, but at this moment, Heaven Battling Union’s Union Master’s eyes were completely bloodshot and an extremely violent aura was pulsating from his body.

The pain of losing a son had obviously infuriated him!

“Ahem, Brother Qu, please restrain your grief!” Fang Peng put on a sorrowful expression and comforted while celebrating in his heart. No matter what kind of trouble Yang Kai caused him, it was nothing compared to Qu Zheng’s pain of having to bury his son.

However, since the two forces were now working together, Fang Peng had to at least keep up appearances, otherwise Qu Zheng would likely turn his anger on him.

“A mere Spirit Array is enough to block you?” Qu Zheng ground his teeth and shouted with a ferocious expression, “Break this damn thing and drag that little brat out for me! He and I are absolutely irreconcilable! This old master will rip his corpse into ten thousand pieces!”

“Brother Qu, calm yourself,” Fang Peng was taken aback, and quickly repeated, “You must stay calm.”

“You dare to stop me?” Qu Zheng glared at Fang Peng, “Whoever dares try to stop me will be this Qu’s enemy. This Qu will not let anyone off!”

Fang Peng frowned in displeasure as he said, “That boy truly deserves death. It is just as Brother Qu says, just as you cannot tolerate him, neither can this old master!”

“In that case, help this Qu break this Spirit Array, Brother Fang.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“This Spirit Array definitely needs to be broken and that boy dragged out, but... Brother Qu, before we complete our task, that boy cannot die. Don’t forget who gave us this task, if Brother Qu kills that boy out of anger and causes us to fall short of success, I believe Brother Qu should understand the consequences.”

Qu Zheng shivered slightly when he heard these words and finally regained some of his composure, casting a glance towards a certain person among the crowd while revealing a look of dread before muttering, “What Brother Fang said is correct, this Qu was not thinking just now.”

“Good, as long as you understand,” Fang Peng breathed a sigh of relief. Although he was eager for Qu Zheng to kill Yang Kai and implicate Heaven Battling Union, his Thunder Typhoon Sect would not escape unpunished if such a thing happened. He had to dissuade Qu Zheng using both emotion and logic, and fortunately Qu Zheng had not yet reached a point where he couldn’t be reasoned with.

“But... after this matter is finished, that little brat must be handed over to this Qu. I want him to taste the most brutal torture this world has ever known!” Qu Zheng grit his teeth and shouted sternly.

“Certainly, after this matter is over, whether that boy lives or dies will be up to Brother Qu to decide,” Fang Peng nodded before shouting, “Stop standing around! Quickly break open this Spirit Array and capture that boy!”

“Yes!” The remaining dozen or so Origin Returning Realm masters simultaneously shouted before hurriedly summoning their respective artifacts and releasing their Secret Techniques towards the invisible barrier in front of them. Even Fang Tian Zhong, who had been observing from a thousand metres away, ran over and contributed his strength.

While these people attacked the Spirit Array from the outside, the dozen or so Origin Returning Realm masters who had been caught by Yang Kai looked around the inside the Spirit Array created by the Array Plate, confused.

A moment ago, they were attacking Yang Kai, but now they had suddenly come to this strange place, so they were at a bit of a loss. On top of that, after looking around, each of them realized they were no longer close to each other, all of them spread out somewhat.

“Brother Si Tu, what is this place?” Elder Liang Yong of Heaven Battling Union turned his head and asked someone not far away, Vice Sect Master Si Tu Hong of Thunder Typhoon Sect.

Before, it had been the two of them who let Yang Kai pass and join up with Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu.

“I don’t know, but it looks like we’re trapped in some kind of Spirit Array.”

“Spirit Array!” Liang Yong’s face changed slightly, “What about Yang Kai?”

“What do you think?” Si Tu Hong answered with a question of his own.

Liang Yong’s heart clenched before sinking considerably.
