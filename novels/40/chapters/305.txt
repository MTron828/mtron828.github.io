Inside the spider’s sack, Yang Kai looked suspiciously at Shan Qing Luo, “Beauty... have you taken a fancy to me, so you’re suddenly being so generous to me?”

Shan Qing Luo blushed lightly and glanced towards him, “So what if I am?”

Yang Kai was instantly dumbfounded, “So you prefer having an old cow to eat tender grass? Gah... it hurts!”

Shan Qing Luo sneered and maliciously twisted Yang Kai’s chest as she grit her teeth, “Old cow eating tender grass? This Queen taking a fancy to you is your lifetime’s ultimate blessing!”

“I can’t accept such a blessing!” Yang Kai stared at her in shock, unable to believe what he was hearing. “Even if you’ve become taken with me, I have no way to really be with you. Why are you intentionally trying to seduce me?”

Shan Qing Luo’s face instantly became chilly, and she glared at him with a slightly murderous look. “You’ve already done so many bad things to me. Felt and explored every part of my body, yet you still refuse to take responsibility?”

(Silavin: Not everything 😀)

“Simply by touching you a little, you’ve decided it is necessary for you to rely on me?” Yang Kai wryly smiled and stared back at her before he seriously replied, “Besides, I’m just a young kid without any previous experiences; before meeting you, I was both physically and mentally innocent, so in reality I’m the one who’s lost something! But out of fairness and virtue, why don’t we forget about all of that and just carry on as if it never happened?”

“You shameless lying little bastard! Being so skillful and aggressive, how could you have possibly had no experience?” Shan Qing Luo angrily glared at Yang Kai before suddenly revealing an elegant smile, “Each generation of my Poison Widow Body family will only ever develop emotional attachment to a single man. Since you’ve already emblazoned your image into my heart, don’t even dream of being able to escape in this lifetime!”

“...Fuck! How can the Heavens be so cruel!” Yang Kai complained vehemently.

“Hehe...” Shan Qing Luo giggled happily with a proud smile pasted upon her face and a victorious light flashing in her eyes.

(Silavin: Why the hell are you happy? I’m checking the translations and it’s accurate. WTF?)

But suddenly, a shrill scream rang out from nearby.

Everyone who had awakened heard this scream, held their breath, and perked up their ears to listen only to hear a slicing noise followed by the sound gushing liquid, and then they saw a bright red splash of light just outside the layers of spider silk imprisoning them.

“Young Lord... don’t come out, they’re just outside, ah!” After an anguished shout, there was quickly no more movement.

A moment later, an eerie sound of chewing could be heard.

Shan Qing Luo’s beautiful face slightly paled. Her soft tender body involuntarily pressed closer to Yang Kai, shrinking up into his arms.

“That was one of Bai Family’s man...” Luo Xiao Man’s voice tremblingly called out from beside them, a light whimpering obvious in her words. This girl, although her chest was large her courage was somewhat small. This one month of panicked fleeing had no doubt strained her nerves to their limit.

Usually, Qiu Yi Meng would quickly comfort her, but now that they had been captured and she had been separated from Qiu Yi Meng, she suddenly found herself isolated and alone, the pressure she felt was quickly becoming unbearable.

“Xiao Man, don’t cry, or else you’ll draw those spiders’ attention to you!” Qiu Yi Meng hurriedly called out, eagerly trying to soothe her.

But how could Luo Xiao Man all of a sudden control her emotions after losing control? Although she had quickly clamped her hands over her mouth, her sobs were still gradually becoming louder, leading to an ox-sized eight-legged spider soon arriving in front of her. Frightened by this, Luo Xiao Man let out a loud shriek and instantly fainted.

[We are doomed!] Everyone was certain that this girl had reached the end of her life.

Even Yang Kai couldn’t help holding his breath as he listened carefully to the noises around him.

Fortunately, for some unknown reason, this giant spider simply lingered around in front of Luo Xiao Man for a while before leisurely walking away.

*Haa...* Qiu Yi Meng let out a long sigh of relief. Her worst fears slowly receded, and she quickly discovered that her entire body had become soaked in cold sweat.

“It looks like even if we speak to one another, as long as we don’t make any attempt to escape they’ll ignore us,” Yang Kai said thoughtfully.

Unfortunately for that Bai Family cultivator, he had used some unknown method to escape from the spider sack and was thus condemned to death.

Listening to his hypothesis, everyone couldn’t help relaxing slightly. The sound of ragged breathing suddenly erupting from all over the cavern. Before now, everyone had tried their best to suppress the sound of their breath and even their own heartbeats.

“Brother Guo, Brother Guo...” Yuan Shi suddenly called out.

“I’m here!” Guo Yuan Ming quickly responded, softly whispering, “Brothers, are you alright?”

“Not really!” Gu Tian Luo joined in.

“Right now we’re only wrapped up in these spider sacks and are temporarily unable to move.” Yuan Shi continued, “We’re capable of breaking these webs but Brother Guo knows there are many of those spiders outside, right? How should we deal with them?”

Guo Yuan Ming was unable to reply, twenty or thirty Sixth-Order Monster Beasts. Altogether they only had five or six Immortal Ascension Boundary masters on their side. Clearly, they weren’t worthy opponents. And these spiders’ ability to shoot webs was really overwhelming, even if they were capable of flight they would not necessarily be able to escape.

“Damn it! How did this happen?!” Yuan Shi cursed angrily, “Why are there so many spiders here?”

Shan Qing Luo couldn’t help letting out a light laughter, reveling in these mens’ anguish, sarcastically quipping “Retribution!”

Guo Yuan Ming quickly became enraged, cursing viciously, “Cheap slut! You’d better pray that I don’t manage to escape from here, if I get out, sooner or later I’ll make you suffer a fate worse than death! I’ll make you beg for mercy under this Lords crotch!”

Shan Qing Luo face suddenly went cold as she inhaled a deep breath. She wanted to retort, but eventually didn’t saying anything.

Since no one here could actually fight, in a war of insults, a woman was never a man’s opponent, cursing back at them with any kind of unscrupulous words would only serve to stain Shan Qing Luo’s dignity further.

(Silavin: ... sorry. I have no means to protect this statement.)

“Hahaha!” Seeing her chose to remain silent, Yuan Shi burst out into laughter, “Brother Guo, this whore’s fame is legendary, and you alone might not be her opponent! Be careful that she doesn’t suck you dry!”

Gu Tian Luo also lewdly called out, “Good thing Brother Guo isn’t alone! There are so many of us brothers here to help.”

“Fuck yeah! Wait until we escape this storm, with more than a dozen of us brothers taking turns nonstop, I’d like to see how many days and nights this world’s greatest slut can persist for!”

“Elder Brother Yu, you cultivate a yin-yang absorbing art, right? Which do you think is more potent, your Secret Art or her Beguiling Technique?”

That Brother Yu wore a vicious grin, “Between our two Secret Art’s strength, how could I dare compare myself with this wench! Everyone knows this slut spends all night crying out in ecstasy, draining the Yang Yuan force from an untold number of men then tossing their dried up dead husks into mass graves! But if both our Secret Arts aren’t used, this Lord has confidence that this bitch will soon choose to submit!”

“Hahaha! Brother Yu has such great style!”

“Brother Ban, I heard a few days ago you received quite a number of girls; all of them beautiful virgins. After we escape from here, you should contribute a few of them to us, let your brothers share in your fun!”

“Good idea Brother Yu!” Guo Yuan Ming loudly applauded, although he was still slightly unnerved by their current predicament, even he couldn’t stop his breath from becoming heavy, and he laughed wretchedly, “At that time, we’ll cripple this so called Demon Queen’s cultivation, then force feed her some violent stimulants, then while we brothers play with Brother Ban’s new girls, we can watch this slut writhe in agony.”

“Hahaha! At that time, I’m sure this arrogant Demon Queen will cry out and beg us to rape her!”

“After we play with her a thousand times, we’ll sell her to this world’s filthiest whore house so that those beggars, cripples and wastes can have a turn with her! After a few years living there, forget being this world’s most charming woman, I’m afraid even wild dogs won’t be able to stand her rotten stench!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Ha ha ha...”

...

As their foul language became uglier and uglier, this group of the Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land cultivators suddenly found themselves unable to stop, and they released their pent up bitterness by profaning Shan Qing Luo with the most horrid and obscene insults they could hurl.

As these words reached her ears, Shan Qing Luo’s face became more and more cold, and her breathing slowly increased. Her tender body trembled involuntarily, and her beautiful eyes were now dyed completely in murderous light, as her anger reached never before seen heights.

Yang Kai who was with her also couldn’t help becoming indignant.

“I’ll kill them! Sooner or later I’ll slaughter each and every one of them like dogs!” Shan Qing Luo ground her teeth as she clenched her fists. Her mouth constantly murmured such thoughts. She was the Beguiling Demon Queen. Usually no man dared even gaze upon her much less insult her with obscene curses, but now that they had all fallen into the tigers den, these few trash servants of the Beast King had debased her no less than a hundred times.

“Don’t worry, I’ll help you vent your anger!” Yang Kai suddenly chuckled loudly.

“Hmm?” Shan Qing Luo suddenly looked up at him.

“Well, just listen!” Yang Kai grinned mysteriously, and his face slowly became cold.

This group of evil cultivators were still continuing their presumptuous tirade, spewing mouthfuls of base insults, venting to their hearts content, when suddenly one of them screamed out in horror.

All of a sudden this conversation came to an end.

“Brother Yuan, what happened? What happened to you?” Guo Yuan Ming asked frantically. The voice that had cried out no doubt belonged to Yuan Shi, but after that he no longer spoke.

“Brother Yuan!”

Several others also called out, yet Yuan Shi still didn’t respond.

An unknown feeling of dread slowly began to envelop the crowd, but before they could figure out what had happened, another scream rang out.

This time it was that Brother Yu, he cried out in pain, screaming in despair, “Why!? This Lord didn’t try to escape, why are you attacking I?”

As he screamed, this Brother Yu quickly tried to release a Martial Skill.

However this only served to bring more attention to himself, soon drawing many more giant spiders towards him. Within a mere few breaths of time, this Brother Yu had become a shredded corpse.

Everyone instantly fell silent, and no one dared to speak.

Shan Qing Luo’s beautiful eyes filled with an astonished light, and she quickly gazed suspiciously towards Yang Kai, while trying to figure out what secret hand he had played in these events.

However, Yang Kai simply grinned and softly whispered, “It’s not over yet.”

As soon as he spoke these words, another panicked voice cried out, “Brother Ban, one of those spiders is moving towards you!”

“What?” A panicked voice cried out, this Brother Ban clearly didn’t want to sit still and wait for death, so he instantly began pushing his True Qi and with a great roar violently ripped the silk cocoon holding him, but just as he emerged, a sharp knife-like spider leg chopped down on his head.

After a violently blooming crimson flower burst forth, a severed head rolled down to the ground, quickly followed by a fountain of blood spraying out.

“What’s going on!?” Guo Yuan Ming cried out.

All of them had thought that there would be no problem if they spoke as long as they didn’t try to escape, but now it seems like they had unwittingly drawn the attention of these spiders.

At that moment, the sound of movement suddenly came from in front of Guo Yuan Ming accompanied by the faint outline of a giant Sixth-Order Monster Beast spider appearing through the thick white spider silk cocoon before him.

“Brothers, these spiders have started indiscriminately slaughtering, we have to escape now!” Guo Yuan Ming roared loudly, instantly split open the cocoon which was binding him, and launched an all-out assault towards the giant spider before him, using the rebounding force from this attack to fling himself backwards.

Seeing Guo Yuan Ming act so decisively, the others didn’t dare hesitate. All of them used whatever means available to them to escape from these sacks and follow behind him.

*Pu pu pu....*

Instantly, the surrounding twenty or thirty Sixth-Order Monster Beasts pounced onto these evil cultivators, wantonly spitting out threads of silk and captured everyone one by one, not allowing a single one of them to escape, and soon all of them were once more wrapped up and turned into squirming dumplings.
