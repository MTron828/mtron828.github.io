Nan Dou Peak was the second highest peak in the Star Moon Mountain Range where Star Soul Palace was situated. It was an excellent environment for cultivation as World Energy was abundant there. It wasn’t even inferior to the Main Peak of High Heaven Palace.

Star Soul Palace was where billions of cultivators in the Southern Territory gathered. Not only was it closely linked to the well-being of the Southern Territory, but it was also the central axis of the Earth Vein across the entire Southern Territory. It was only natural for that place to have an abundance of World Energy as a result.

After arranging a place for Yang Kai to stay, Lan Xun took her leave.

For a while, Nan Dou Peak was tranquil. Yang Kai’s mental state seemed to be slightly affected by the environment, and he became very calm. Since there was nobody to disturb him, he closed his eyes and meditated, cultivating the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique Zhu Qing had taught him before she left.

Time flew by, and night fell. Yang Kai, who was cultivating quietly, suddenly felt a disturbance and opened his eyes abruptly. Shifting his body slightly, he exited the private room and stood atop Nan Dou Peak. What entered his vision made him agape with shock.

The crescent moon hung brightly in the sky, surrounded by the stars. It looked like a stunningly beautiful scroll was spread out over the entire sky above Star Moon Mountain Range. Moreover, each and every star twinkled with a dazzling light, almost as if one could reach out and grasp them.

However, what amazed him the most were the flashes of light falling from those stars, connecting the Heavens and the Earth together. Each flash of light seemed to contain some sort of mysterious power that made the World Energy on Star Moon Mountain become more alive. The space between the Heavens and the Earth was filled with a charm that could not be experienced during the day. It was insignificant and elusive yet seemed to contain some kind of profound truth.

At this very moment, the entire Star Moon Mountain Range looked like a heavenly land. It was so mesmerizing that it made one reluctant to leave this place. He stared at the sight before him blankly until he even forgot to breathe. Even so, his mind was calmer than ever before.

“This is the Star Tide, which occurs once every month. According to the Great Emperor, the Star Tide contains the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth. One can receive countless benefits if one can comprehend anything from the Star Tide. En… It is a fact that many Star Soul Palace disciples received various benefits from the Star Tide, some even managing to break through their cultivation bottlenecks in a state of epiphany and, consequently, learned Divine Abilities taught directly from the Heavenly Way. For those Star Soul Palace disciples cultivating the Star and Moon Secret Technique, in particular, they have received even more from the Star Tide.” A person’s voice rang out suddenly from not far away.

“So, that’s how it is.” Yang Kai looked unflustered. He was immersed in the starlight enshrouding him, but unfortunately, he failed to receive any benefits from the Star Tide even though he found it absolutely miraculous and was vaguely aware of its mysterious powers. He wasn’t sure if the failure was caused by the presence of the Star Soul Palace disciple next to him, or was simply his lack of opportunity.

After a while, Yang Kai turned his head and looked at a sturdy young man, who had his hands clasped behind his back, and asked, “How should I address you?”

The young man turned to him and grinned, revealing a set of clean and white teeth, “Lei Ting!”

Frowning, Yang Kai mulled over it for a bit, “I’ve heard of the four Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters that serve as the Elders of Star Soul Palace under the Great Emperor. Among them, Great Elder Lei Hong is the most powerful. His strength even goes beyond that of a Third-Order Emperor. What relationship do you have with that Great Elder Lei?”

Lei Ting spat disdainfully, seemingly unwilling to hear Lei Hong’s name. Even so, he truthfully replied, “He is my Uncle!”

Yang Kai made a non-committal sound in response, “I see. You are Great Elder Lei’s Nephew.”

Lei Ting’s gaze sharpened at those words as he snapped back, “I much prefer hearing you say that he is my Uncle.”

Yang Kai shrugged, “I apologize. I have only ever heard of Great Elder Lei’s name.”

Lei Ting coldly snorted as a faint blue arc of electricity danced in his hair, making crackling sounds before he quickly said, “I spend most of my time in retreat inside Star Soul Palace and rarely travel out of the Sect. Therefore, it is only natural that you have never heard of me before; but that’s okay, my name will spread far and wide from now onwards.”

“Then, Brother Lei…” Yang Kai smiled slightly at Lei Ting’s shameless boasting, not sure how else he was supposed to react. “Why did you come here in the middle of the night?”

Lei Ting’s eyes lowered, a cold light shining in their depths as he spoke, “I heard that the Princess personally came to welcome you when you arrived today.”

“Yes, that did happen.” Yang Kai nodded.

Lei Ting’s aura flared up and he spoke through gritted teeth, “Does that mean that you are very close with the Princess?”

“Not really. We’ve only met each other a few times before,” Yang Kai rubbed his chin, feeling rather annoyed and troubled, “I think I can guess the reason why you came to find me, Brother Lei.”

“It’s good that you understand! Let’s have a duel! You have to scram out of Star Soul Palace immediately and never meet with the Princess again if you lose!” Lei Ting shouted in fury as the aura of a First-Order Emperor surged from his body, seemingly boiling over in rage. It felt as if the person standing in front of him was not Yang Kai, who he had met for the first time today, but his greatest and most hated archnemesis instead.

Yang Kai stared at Lei Ting, “Don’t you think you’ve chosen the wrong opponent? Shouldn’t your enemy be Xiao Chen? He is the biggest obstacle between you and the Princess.”

Lei Ting burst out into mocking laughter, “Xiao Chen? Xiao Chen is nothing! If he refuses to listen, I will beat him up so badly that his own father won’t be able to recognize him!”

Yang Kai was stunned by those words. Xiao Chen was a rising star of the Southern Territory who had just broken through to the Emperor Realm. Even if Lei Ting seemed slightly stronger, he was still just a First-Order Emperor as well. What made this boy dare to boast so shamelessly? Still, Yang Kai had truly never heard of the name Lei Ting before, only knowing that this generation of Star Soul Palace disciples was led by Xiao Chen and Lan Xun. Now, it seemed like there is one more person among them.

Ruminating over what Lei Ting said before, Yang Kai quickly understood the situation. If Lei Ting was constantly in retreat inside Star Soul Palace and rarely stepped outside the palace, it wasn’t strange that his name wasn’t known to the public.

Yang Kai went silent for a moment before saying seriously, “Brother Lei, I’m afraid you have misunderstood something about me…”

He found Lei Ting’s attitude of immediately finding faults with him displeasing; nevertheless, he was currently a guest in Star Soul Palace. If any conflict were to arise between him and Lei Ting, it might upset the higher-ups at Star Soul Palace. Moreover, since Lei Ting’s Uncle was none other than the Great Elder, Lei Hong, it would be bad if this incident ruined his chance to cultivate in the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda.

Yang Kai was only halfway through his sentence when Lei Ting shouted, “Enough nonsense! Fight me!”

Lei Ting lifted his hand the moment those words left his mouth and deep purple lightning crackled around him. Suddenly, the lightning condensed into a kind of whip in his hands which he swept towards Yang Kai. This was a powerful and heavy attack that looked as if it could split worlds apart.

Yang Kai was forced to swallow the rest of his words with a shocked expression. He could tell from Lei Ting’s attack that this guy was stronger than Xiao Chen. In fact, Lei Ting was more powerful than any other First-Order Emperor Yang Kai had ever met. It could even be said that Lei Ting was on par with most Second-Order Emperor Realm Masters in terms of strength.

[He hasn’t even gone all out yet. If he exerted his full strength, I’m afraid even ordinary Second-Order Emperors may not be his opponent. He certainly has some skills. No wonder he dares to come and pick a fight with me.]

The electric whip struck towards Yang Kai, who summoned his Myriads Sword in response and swung it horizontally in front of him. Sparks flew and a loud clashing sound rang out as the lightning whip was deflected. Even so, that terrifying current flowed through the Myriads Sword and into Yang Kai’s arm. In an instant, he felt as if a snake had slithered across his entire body, causing all his hairs to stand on end. Only after pushing his Emperor Qi did Yang Kai manage to dissipate the foreign force invading his body.

Before Yang Kai could even react though, the lightning whip struck towards him again, twisting mid-air as it quickly transformed into a gigantic lightning python. The lightning python opened its mouth wide and struck at him swiftly, letting out a thunderous and horrifying roar in the process. In response, Yang Kai waved his hand and sent out a Moon Blade that cleanly cut the python in half.

An exclamation of shock rang out as Lei Ting seemed to be incredibly astonished. He had cultivated this Lightning Python Secret Technique for many years now and was well aware of how powerful it was. Most First-Order Emperors would not be able to withstand it no matter how they struggled, but Yang Kai seemed to have split it in two with ease. Besides, the Divine Ability Yang Kai used gave off a strange feeling, seemingly containing fluctuations of the Space Principles.

As the lightning python dispersed into the air, Lei Ting took advantage of the distraction to silently approach Yang Kai. Amidst the flashes of lightning, he snuck closer until he was no more than one meter away. Raising his palm, Lei Ting sent out a palm covered in lightning that crackled loudly as it shot forwards.

“Enough!” Yang Kai roared in anger, lifting his finger and poking towards Lei Ting’s palm. If this finger connected with Lei Ting’s palm, a hole would surely be opened in the latter’s hand. Yang Kai would also suffer some injuries of course, but they wouldn’t be anywhere near as severe.

Just as their attacks were about to meet though, Lei Ting’s body suddenly shuddered. A trace of panic swept across his expression as he turned to look back in a certain direction. The palm strike he was about to make also froze in mid-air instantly.

When Lei Ting stopped moving, Yang Kai stopped moving too, his finger actually tapping against Lei Ting’s palm, focusing his strength on that one spot but not releasing it.

“Bastard! How dare you spoil my good deed, Xiao Chen!” Lei Ting cursed suddenly before retracting his palm and turning to leave. He had taken no more than two steps though before he turned around and glared at Yang Kai seriously, “I never came here tonight. You and I did not greet each other. More importantly, we did not fight! Do you understand?!”

Yang Kai looked up at the sky and leisurely said, “The night sky is so charming.”

“You…” Lei Ting seemed like he had more to say; however, he obviously didn’t have enough time to do so, so he just glared at Yang Kai ferociously before transforming his body into a flash of light that quickly disappeared.

Moments after Lei Ting left, another flash of light landed on Nan Dou Peak. Lan Xun glanced at Yang Kai and asked, “Senior Brother Yang, are you okay?”

“I’m fine. Why?” Yang Kai smiled slightly, “The night view of Star Soul Palace is beautiful, so I came out to get some fresh air.”

“I heard that Lei Ting came here. Did he cause any trouble for you?”

“Who is Lei Ting?” Yang Kai blinked at her in surprise, a bewildered expression on his face, but his slightly singed hair which was all standing on end, obviously giving him away.

Lan Xun gave him a pondering look before she pursed her lips and smiled. On the other hand, Yang Kai just casually ran his fingers through his hair and calmly explained, “The wind did a number on my hair.”

Lan Xun shook her head lightly and retorted, “Lei Ting cultivated so much that he became a little stupid in the process. He can be a little unreasonable. The next time you meet him, let me know immediately, Senior Brother Yang. I will take care of him.”

Yang Kai fell silent for a moment before he nodded, “Good.”

“En. You can… Continue enjoying the night air, Senior Brother Yang. I’ll head back first,” Lan Xun covered her mouth and giggled. After that, she turned around and left.

“Lei Ting…” Yang Kai touched his chin and pondered for a moment before a smile suddenly spread across his face.

Not far away from Nan Dou Peak, Lei Ting grabbed Xiao Chen by his collar and viciously snarled, “You were behind it, right? I’m sure it was you! If you didn’t notify Little Sister Xun, she wouldn’t have come over at such a timely moment! You rotten bastard! If you had given me just a little more time, I’d have been able to kick that guy out of Star Soul Palace!”

“Let go of me! Pulling at my clothes like that… highly improper!” Xiao Chen’s eyes drooped slightly, staring at Lei Ting’s large hands with a disgusted look.
