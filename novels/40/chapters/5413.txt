Cang had never seen Mo use this Secret Technique before, nor could he figure out what the other party was about to do. With that said, he finally realised why Mo had been trying to sustain the balance on the battlefield, even letting so many of its servants get killed. It had all been to prepare for this moment.

Despite not knowing what Mo was about to do, Cang reckoned that he had to immediately stop it; otherwise, the Humans would be in grave danger. He madly surged his power in an attempt to reseal the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction; however, from the depths of the darkness a violent force burst forth to resist it, stopping the gap from closing.

As this competition unfolded, Cang eventually gained the upper hand because he had the restriction’s help, but even though the gap was closing, it was extremely slow.

“Kill!” A Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master’s roar reverberated across the entire battlefield. Everyone knew that they had reached the most critical moment. Regardless of what Mo was up to, if they couldn’t stop him, they would lose the war.

Several hundred thousand Human soldiers who had been recuperating in the Great Passes charged towards the battlefield. All the Human soldiers were ready to strike. Even the soldiers guarding the arrays drove their Warships towards the battlefield. In an instant, the 106 Great Passes became empty.

The Black Ink Clan soldiers also divided into two groups, the first group leaving to intercept the Humans while the other group joined the dark tide to strengthen it.

The competition between Cang and Mo was still ongoing. Having said that, Cang was apparently in an advantageous position as the speed at which the opening of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction was closing had increased.

Just then, a force that was as immense as a tidal wave gushed out from the depths of the darkness and penetrated the gap before joining the squirming dark tide. Then, the dark tide contorted and wiggled before forming into an arm.

The arm was made from countless limbs, black blood, and Black Ink Strength, but it wasn’t engulfed in Death Qi at all. Instead, it was as vibrant as a real arm. The bulging muscles of the arm suggested that it was full of strength. It was so gigantic that everyone could see nothing else and the aura billowing from it shook all beholders to the core.

The arm was connected to the force coming out from the gap. Looking from afar, it was as though a giant was sticking a hand out from the opening.

In fact, Cang could indeed feel a horrifying aura coming to life from the darkness where a giant was rapidly taking shape. The arm that penetrated the gap became a force that stopped the restriction from sealing.

Cang’s expression changed drastically as he exclaimed, “Have you reached that realm?”

The realm that was beyond the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm!

In the past, Cang and the other nine had been trying to ascend to that realm, but none of them succeeded. Even though Cang was more powerful than the average Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he still hadn’t broken free from the Open Heaven Realm.

He believed that beyond the Open Heaven Realm was the Creation Realm that no Humans had ever reached.

However, Mo’s voice sounded dispirited, “That realm? Maybe… I don’t know. Do you think I’ve reached that realm? I don’t think so.”

Cang was flabbergasted as he recalled the turmoil that took place in the restriction back then. At that time, Mo almost managed to break free from the trap. It seemed that Mo had already reached the Creation Realm at that time as in the endless darkness, it had created a lot of powerful beings.

After giving it some thought though, Cang realised it wasn’t surprising. Mo was able to create innumerable servants. All the Black Ink Clansmen were created from its Black Ink Strength and given its innate power and years of accumulation, it shouldn’t be shocking that it had reached the Creation Realm.

All of a sudden, Cang turned calm and let out a sigh, “Mo, you were born alongside the Universe with unrivalled gifts and incredible capabilities. You’re supposed to be free from any restraints, but your strength dictates that you’ll not be accepted by everyone else.”

Cang replied impassively, “Millions of years have passed, so this matter should come to an end. I’m worried that my friends have grown anxious from waiting for so long.”

All of a sudden, Mo had a bad premonition and shouted, “Don’t do anything silly!”

Cang guffawed, “You’re the one who’s doing something silly.”

Saying so, he flicked his fingers as a ray of light broke through the air. Wherever the light went, it penetrated the Black Ink Clansmen and destroyed them.

Previously, he told Yang Kai that while he was part of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, he could only make a move within the restriction; he was unable to have a hand in the affairs outside the Grand Restriction. That wasn’t a strict rule though, but there was a huge price to pay for breaking it. In order to send this ray of light out of the restriction, he had no choice but to put himself at stake.

The moment he made a move, the entire Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction seemed to have become unstable. Seizing the chance, Mo exerted more force to expand the gap. The arm that spanned the gap was shaking in an attempt to enlarge the opening.

“Stop it!” Mo’s Divine Sense spread across the void. Even though it had no idea what the ray of light was, it couldn’t let Cang achieve his goal at this point.

A Royal Lord extended his hand to catch the ray of light, but before he could even grasp it, his arm exploded. The power within the light was unimaginably horrifying.

Seeing that, the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, who had been chasing after this Royal Lord, immediately summoned his Divine Manifestation that turned into a hideous giant beast and swallowed the Royal Lord whole. Then, the Ninth-Order Master cast several seals at the Royal Lord and directly refined him.

Driven by Mo, the other Black Ink Clansmen along the way tried to stop the ray of light; however, even a Royal Lord was unable to intercept it, so how were the other Black Ink Clansmen supposed to achieve anything?

The ray of light crossed the void and left behind a vacuum in its wake before it actually penetrated Yang Kai. Upon impact, Yang Kai’s figure shook, and before he could figure out what was going on, he saw countless Black Ink Clansmen savagely coming at him from all directions. He promptly retreated and dashed towards the place where the Human Race soldiers gathered together.

The Black Ink Clansmen chased after him, but they were soon intercepted. Both parties clashed in the void as their blood spattered.

On the other hand, after casting that ray of light, Cang extended his hand into the void and pulled out a rough, uncut jade.

“Mu!” Mo exclaimed. It could feel Mu’s aura coming from this uncut jade. This was definitely something Mu had left behind after her death.

Among the 10, Mo was most fond of Mu, and it was also closest to her. However, in the end, it was confined to this place because of her. Millions of years had passed, but it didn’t hold hatred for her. Nevertheless, when it felt the familiar aura again, it couldn’t help but have conflicted feelings.

Mo soon pulled itself together and roared in a voice that still sounded childlike, “Ah! What do you plan to do, Cang!?”

As it spoke, another hand stuck out from the opening and clenched the edge. The other arm that had originally penetrated the gap retracted and grasped the other side.

Both hands exerted themselves and pushed the gap open as though they were opening a door. A horrifying aura streamed out of the gap, and at the same time, a gigantic head stuck out from the chasm. Its dark eyes reflected the entire battlefield, as though it was going to devour everything in sight.

The world trembled as the universe seemed to have been turned upside down and countless cracks started appearing in the Void.

“I don’t know what is going to happen either,” Cang’s voice sounded helpless.

His words sounded perfunctory, but he indeed had no idea what was about to happen. The uncut jade was the last testament left behind by Mu. She told them that they just had to summon this uncut jade at the most perilous moment.

Back then, Mu entered the Grand Restriction and arrived at the depths of the endless darkness. When she returned, she was already on her last breath. After passing the uncut jade to them, she blended herself into the restriction to fortify it.

After the uncut jade was summoned, it rose into the sky and shone brightly. From the light, a slender figure appeared. The figure was so colossal that she seemed to cover the entire sky, but no one could make out her face. Nevertheless, the moment she appeared, she became the centre of the universe.

Everyone stopped fighting on the battlefield as their attention was drawn to her. It was the most immaculate figure in the world, as though everything good and beautiful had been condensed within her. No one would ever have any evil thoughts about her.

“Mu!” Cang looked up with a conflicted gaze.

“Mu!” Mo muttered.

There seemed to be a smile on Mu’s face as she spoke in a gentle tone, “We haven’t met for ages, Mo.”

“Are you still… alive?” There was a hint of pleasant surprise in Mo’s voice.

Mu shook her head, “I’m dead. You know that I passed away a long time ago.”

Mo let out a sigh and replied in a dejected tone, “Yes, I know. I thought you were still alive, but since you’re dead, what are you trying to do now?”

All of a sudden, Mu said in a mischievous tone, “I’m going to play your favourite game with you for the last time.”

Mo was torn between tears and laughter, “You’re such a good friend.”

Mu refuted, “Call me Big Sister. I’m not that old.”

Saying so, she swept her hand across the darkness and muttered under her breath, “There, there. When you wake up, there’ll be games to play and food to have.”

Following her movement, the entire Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction started shining brightly and pulsing rhythmically. On the battlefield, both the Humans and Black Ink Clansmen became sluggish as a sense of sleepiness washed over them, making them feel dizzy.

Besides the Fifth-Order, Sixth-Order, and Seventh-Order Masters, even the Eighth-Order and Ninth-Order Masters were unable to fight off the sleepiness.

At that instant, a strange scene appeared on this violent battlefield. The weaker soldiers of both Races fell into a peaceful sleep all of a sudden. In general, the Black Ink Clansmen were most heavily affected as the Humans had their Warships’ protection, so they still had some power to resist the mysterious force.

Yang Kai was sleepy as well. He felt his eyelids threatening to shut against his will, but at the most critical moment, a sense of coolness coursed through him, making him come back to his senses. It was the Soul Warming Lotus.

Even though he had no idea what move Mu had used, it was apparently a technique that affected the Soul, so the Soul Warming Lotus’ protection helped him endure it.
