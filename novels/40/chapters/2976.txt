In the time it took to boil a cup of tea, Zhu Lie’s face became swollen and bruised. Lying on the floor, his clothes were in disarray, and he was panting heavily, like a girl who had been ravaged by a hundred and eighty strong men.

His eyes swelled and became nearly imperceptible slits while his handsome face was even worse off, looking practically deformed.

“The next time you dare to be disrespectful to Qing’er and me, the consequences will be worse,” Yang Kai looked down at him condescendingly.

Zhu Lie turned his head, ignoring him as he thought, [As long as the forest remains, there would be no lack of firewood, isn’t that the saying among humans? A wise man knows better than to fight when the odds are against him. I’ll show him one day…]

Yang Kai released the Dragon Transformation Secret Art and returned to his Human Form.

“Yang… Palace Master Yang!” Li Jiao timidly called from the side, “Help.”

Yang Kai looked over and suddenly wanted to laugh.

The black puppy had run over to Li Jiao at some point and was sniffing him curiously. Occasionally, it would even stick out its tongue to lick Li Jiao.

Li Jiao, being corroded by Demon Qi, now exuded a similar smell to the Demons, thus attracting the black puppy’s interest.

The scene where it swallowed the Blood Demon was still vivid in his mind, so Li Jiao was naturally afraid of it. Not to mention, since it was a pet beast brought by Yang Kai, he didn’t dare to act rashly towards it, and could only ask Yang Kai for help.

“Ah Wang, that’s not food!” Yang Kai called out.

The black puppy looked at Li Jiao reluctantly but still walked away obediently and jumped into Zhu Qing’s arms.

“What a perverted guy!” Yang Kai looked at it contemptuously. Before, the black puppy was only close to him, but ever since meeting Zhu Qing, it wouldn’t leave her side.

Zhu Qing said, “What are you saying, she’s a girl!”

Yang Kai was dumbfounded, “Really?”

Come to think of it, he never paid attention to the gender of the black puppy. He walked over and lifted the black puppy’s tail for a look, but Zhu Qing slapped his hand away.

“I’m just taking a look… What’s the big deal?” Yang Kai mumbled but didn’t continue to press the matter. Instead, he looked over at Li Jiao and Zhu Lie, saying, “Since we’ve found them, let’s head towards Yin Wind Mountain.”

Li Jiao asked, “What kind of place is Yin Wind Mountain?”

Yang Kai replied, “If you want to leave here, that place is the only exit.”

Li Jiao instantly became lively and he stood up energetically, “Then, what are we waiting for? Let’s go!”

His cultivation wasn’t the lowest present, after all, there was Yang Kai; however, based solely on combat ability, he was undoubtedly the weakest present, not to mention he was being corroded by Demon Qi and was feeling extremely unwell. He couldn’t wait to leave this damned place as soon as possible.

“Then, let’s head off,” saying this, Yang Kai summoned his Flowing Clouds Shuttle.

Zhu Qing held the black puppy and walked inside. Li Jiao followed in with a smile.

Yang Kai turned his head, “Do you want to get on as well?”

“Hmph!” Zhu Lie snorted coldly, his face full of contempt. Naturally, there would be no good feelings towards the person who had just thrashed him, not to mention he still had pride as a Dragon.

“Don’t then!” Yang Kai spat in disdain and didn’t ask anymore, in any case, he had already extended an invitation so he couldn’t be blamed if the other party didn’t want to enter. Since Zhu Lie didn’t view him as a brother-in-law, why did he have to kiss up to him?

Entering the shuttle, Yang Kai confirmed his destination, then used his Emperor Qi to guide the Flowing Clouds Shuttle towards the Yin Wind Mountain.

The Emperor Artifact was extremely fast, turning into a stream of light as it disappeared in a flash.

Li Jiao was self-aware and found a corner to sit down to meditate in a cross-legged position, utilizing his Emperor Qi to resist the corrosion of the Demon Qi. At the same time, the restlessness in his heart grew. The speaker said it casually but the listener paid heed. When Yang Kai suggested he ask Zhu Lie for Dragon Blood to suppress and expel the Demon Qi inside his body, although it sounded unrealistic, he still took it seriously.

The more he thought about it, the better the idea seemed. Dragon Blood could definitely purge the Demon Qi troubling him, not to mention for a half-dragon like himself, Dragon Blood had another use. It could purify his bloodline.

His cultivation had reached a bottleneck with no hope of improvement in this life, so if he wanted to increase his strength, he could only improve his bloodline.

Back then, he risked his life to bring back a Dragon Blood Flower from the Frozen Earth, nourished it painstakingly with his own Blood Qi and Blood Essence for three hundred years before it matured, but Yang Kai ended up benefiting from it instead. Every time he thought of this, his heart ached. The one who officially took it from him though was Zhu Qing, a member of the Dragon Clan, making it so he didn’t even dare to resist or take revenge.

However, the Dragon Blood Flower’s effects were pitiful compared to a Pure Dragon’s blood.

If he could get a drop, it would be more effective than one hundred Dragon Blood Flowers.

The more he thought about it, the harder it was for him to hold back. In a fight, he would lose for sure, maybe he should just ask Zhu Qing? Who knows, she might give him a drop.

As his thoughts were running wild, the Demon Qi in his body fluctuated and the black puppy looked up from Zhu Qing’s arms to stare at Li Jiao with a burning gaze.

To the side, Yang Kai smiled lightly and said comfortingly, “Don’t worry, he’ll be able to catch up to us.”

Zhu Qing sighed, “Don’t bully him like that in the future. Dragons are like that, he didn’t mean anything by it.”

Yang Kai smiled and said, “But your temper seems different.”

Although Zhu Qing had an aloof and prideful demeanour when they first met, as if no one in the world could enter her eyes, it changed later on.

“It is only towards you… Who knew that when we first met…” Zhu Qing glared at him, “I should’ve known you weren’t a good thing even back then.”

“But you still stayed by my side,” Yang Kai added sweetly.

Zhu Qing beat her hand on his chest, turning her head away shyly.

Yang Kai glanced at Li Jiao and scolded angrily.

[I shouldn’t have let this guy up with us.]

……

The Revolving World wasn’t big, so with the speed of the Flowing Cloud Shuttle, Yang Kai and the others arrived at Yin Wind Mountain within a day.

In a remote land, an ancient castle was situated hundreds of kilometres from a tall mountain peak. The castle’s design was crude and sinister-looking, like an ominous beast, constantly hovering and waiting to devour its prey.

There were various buildings scattered in no particular order around the periphery of the castle, forming a unique city there.

Demon Fury City!

The gathering place of Demons in the Revolving World.

Demon Fury City covered a much wider area than Human Imperial City; after all, Demon Fury City didn’t need to be protected by a barrier to resist the changes in the World Principles. Unlike the Human Race, no matter how the World Principles of the Revolving World changed, none of the Demons would be affected, and during this period where it was inclined towards the Demon Realm, they were like fish in water.

Currently, the Demon Qi was dense and it also carried a hint of coldness that could almost be called Cold Demon Qi.

This couldn’t be helped though as Demon Fury City was located near the foot of Yin Wind Mountain and Yin Winds blown down from the mountain had the characteristic of being bone-piercingly cold, attracting Demons to live here.

The Demon Race obviously chose this spot to build Demon Fury City for the sake of a better cultivation environment. The closer you were to Yin Wind Mountain, the stronger the Demon Qi would be, and the more suitable it was for the Demons to enhance their strength. Hundreds of thousands of years of research had allowed them to reduce the impact of the cold while incorporating the maximum amount of Demon Qi to enhance their strength.

When the Flowing Clouds Shuttle arrived in the sky, the Masters of Demon Fury City naturally took notice of it and leapt into the sky.

In the blink of an eye, a dense crowd had formed above Demon Fury City. There were at least a thousand people gathered and among them were a number of Demon Kings.

The Flowing Clouds Shuttle stopped outside the city and Yang Kai slowly walked out.

Countless eyes gathered on him and powerful Divine Senses swept over him, warping the surrounding space to a degree.

Yang Kai was calm and relaxed, with a smile on his face.

“Impudent Human, actually daring to trespass into my Demon Fury City, preposterous!”

“Who are you, state your name!”

“Kill him, kill!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Let me do it, I’ll suck his Yang Qi dry!”

The Demon Kings hollered. No Human ever dared to come into Demon Fury City in such a bold manner, it was simply against common sense. Many of the Demon Kings felt that the majesty of the Demon Race was in question so they wouldn’t let this matter go.

Dark Demon Qi soared into the sky, covering it, forming a large black cloud that slowly advanced towards Yang Kai.

Yai Kai chuckled and said loudly, “This Young Master is heading to Yin Wind Mountain, passing by here was just on the way and he has no intention to cause conflicts with everyone. If it is possible, this Young Master asks for your understanding.”

“Hahaha, what did this brat say? Heading to Yin Wind Mountain? Is he courting death?”

“It’s said that Humans don’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth. It seems to be true. He wants to go to Yin Wind Mountain with his pitiful strength? This King is going to die of laughter.”

“Little Brother, why rush to die? Even I can’t easily approach Yin Wind Mountain as a Demon King. If you go there, I’m afraid you’ll die a cold, lonely death. Why not stay here and accompany this Elder Sister instead? Elder Sister is so lonely.”

Yang Kai cupped his fists and said, “Many thanks for Elder Sister’s concern, but I must go to Yin Wind Mountain, so I can only thank Elder Sister for your kindness. If it is possible, could Elder Sister speak with the other Demon Kings so they would let us pass?”

The Charm Demon smiled elegantly with a pure expression that unconsciously aroused goodwill in others. Hearing Yang Kai’s words, she asked innocently, “Little Brother, why are you headed towards Yin Wind Mountain?”

“It’s rumoured that atop Yin Wind Mountain there is a way to leave this world, so I’m going to find it.”

The Charm Demon nodded, “There is indeed such a rumour, but no one can confirm its authenticity.”

“It’s alright, I’m just trying my luck. If I can’t find a way out, I’ll come back to accompany Elder Sister. This Little Brother is well-equipped and skilled, I’m sure Elder Sister won’t be disappointed.”

The Charm Demon covered her mouth and tittered, “My, what is Little Brother saying? How shameless. Alright, seeing how sincere you are, Elder Sister will help you, but whether or not they let you go is not something I can control.”
