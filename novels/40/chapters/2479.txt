Yang Kai looked at him in surprise, his eyes almost popping out from their sockets as he asked in a trembling voice, “What… What did you say? Did you just say that Senior… is not dead yet?”

Wu Meng Chuan realized that he accidentally leaked a secret he shouldn’t have due to his overexcitement, and he now stared at Yang Kai coldly with murderous intent.

A chill suddenly crept from the soles of the feet to the top of his head, causing Yang Kai to shiver.

Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was a legend, but that legend was killed by the other Great Emperors in the Shattered Star Sea tens of thousands of years ago, his very Soul exterminated, yet now, Wu Meng Chuan had revealed an unbelievable truth.

Yang Kai may not have taken this information seriously if it was from someone else, but Wu Meng Chuan was the descendant of Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, so what he said must have had a basis.

If Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was not dead, it would truly be pandemonium.

What’s more, after several tens of thousands of years of dormancy and forbearance, what had Heaven Devouring Great Emperor been doing? And what was he planning to do next?

Yang Kai gulped hard.

“You possessed great potential, so this King did not want to kill you, but now it seems that you must die!” Wu Meng Chuan bellowed in a deep voice, clenched his fist and threw a punch towards Yang Kai. The punch seemed to crush space as it flew forward, carrying with it seemingly infinite power.

His eagerness to kill Yang Kai to keep his mouth shut made the latter feel even more uneasy, wondering if his guess was correct.

Yang Kai could not help being shocked by Wu Meng Chuan’s actions.

This madman’s strength was far greater than what an ordinary Dao Source Realm cultivator should be able to display. It could even be said that he had exceeded the Dao Source Realm entirely.

Even those outstanding rising stars like Wu Chang and Xia Sheng may not necessarily have such impressive capability like Wu Meng Chuan.

The descendant of Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was no joke. Although he had been cultivating in anonymity all by himself all these years, he did not seem to be worse than other top elites.

However, even though Wu Meng Chuan was outstanding, Yang Kai was not weak. He did not dodge the punch, but returned one of his own instead.

*Hong long long… *

There was a loud explosion and chaotic energy flew everywhere between the two, colliding with each other.

“Hm?” Wu Meng Chuan was taken aback, for he did not expect Yang Kai to be so strong.

He knew his own strength; Ordinary Dao Source Realm cultivators were no match to him, otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to kill so many cultivators in the Shattered Star Sea, robbing their Star Seals in order to upgrade his own to a seven-pointed one.

But because of this, Wu Meng Chuan’s eyes lit up and he bellowed, “Young man, what kind of opportunities have you had these past few years? It really amazes this King that you could progress to this level so quickly from the Origin King Realm.”

He did not know what kind of adventures Yang Kai had been through, but it was certain he was blessed with enormous fortuitous encounters to have such rapid growth and great strength. However, no matter what opportunities Yang Kai had, as long as he killed him, it would all belong to him.

As Wu Meng Chuan spoke, he rushed to Yang Kai’s face and rained down punches on him. Despite his apparent madness, his eyes still showed a hint of clarity.

Yang Kai looked solemn as he silently pushed his Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi, surrounding himself with the force of Five Elements while he confronted Wu Meng Chuan dauntlessly.

Previously, on the Source Sea, their battle was just for show and both of them did not use their full strength, so neither of them knew the other’s limits yet.

But now, neither side was holding back; this was a true life or death battle.

In an instant, the two exchanged hundreds of punches and kicks, resulting in a chain of rumblings.

Yang Kai was undoubtedly superior to Wu Meng Chuan in terms of physique. Furthermore, with the addition of his Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi, which was a profound Body Tempering Secret Art, Wu Meng Chuan instantly fell into a disadvantage in this hand-to-hand match up, and was constantly being beaten back by Yang Kai in humiliation.

Wu Meng Chuan was startled as he realized that he had greatly underestimated Yang Kai’s ability.

In the span of not more than thirty breaths of time, Wu Meng Chuan already had blood splattered all over his body, looking dreadfully pitiful.

But his eyes were still extremely bright.

Yang Kai faintly noticed something wrong, because if it was someone else who was beaten up by him like this, their aura would have weakened significantly; however, Wu Meng Chuan did not show any signs of his aura fading. Instead, his momentum only seemed to be increasing.

In contrast, Yang Kai’s own aura had decreased…

As realization dawned, Yang Kai squinted his eyes and growled in a low voice, “Old Dog, how dare you devour my strength!”

Under his careful observation, Yang Kai finally discovered some clues. He found that a part of the strength he used every time to hit Wu Meng Chuan would strangely disappear, and this part of his power was obviously being swallowed and absorbed by Wu Meng Chuan.

Wu Meng Chuan burst into laughter, “This King has cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, so no one is his equal! Unless you can kill this King in one hit, just wait to die obediently!”

Killing Wu Meng Chuan in one hit was absolutely impossible even for an ordinary First-Order Emperor Realm Master; only a powerhouse at the Second-Order Emperor Realm would be capable of this.

Yang Kai sensed that the situation was not favouring him, and he hurriedly pulled back.

But Wu Meng Chuan roared violently, “You can’t just come and go in front of this King! Heaven Devouring Domain, open up for me!”

*Hong… *

A formless domain expanded in a loud crash, directly wrapping Yang Kai in it. In this domain, Yang Kai found that the power in his body was uncontrollably leaking out of his pores and flowing towards Wu Meng Chuan.

Not only that, his vitality also showed signs of being devoured.

The rate at which this drain was occurring also seemed to be getting faster and faster.

Yang Kai turned pale with fright as he learned the true terror of the Heaven Devouring Battle Law. Although the Embodiment also cultivated this Heaven-defying Secret Art, his capabilities were naturally far weaker compared to Wu Meng Chuan’s. Therefore, he could not summon such a domain that was able to devour the strength of everything and everyone trapped within it.

Everything in this domain became a source of power for Wu Meng Chuan and it was inevitable to be devoured by him. If someone fought with him in this domain, the loss of their strength would turn into a gain for Wu Meng Chuan; Wu Meng Chuan would easily win the battle and eventually kill his opponent as long as he survived.

Yang Kai was stuck in this awkward situation now.

“What rich vitality! What pure Source Qi!” Wu Meng Chuan’s eyes gleamed. While fighting with Yang Kai at full tilt, he shouted in amazement, “Little brat, you tempered your body to such an extent? Good, good, good! Now when this King breaks through to the Emperor Realm, he will also have an amazing supplement like you!”

Yang Kai snorted, “Do you really want to devour me so much? Be careful not to choke to death!”

Saying so, he pushed the local Space Principles, causing the surrounding space to become fragile and unstable.

Wu Meng Chuan’s eyes widened in surprise, “This, this, this is… Space Principles!”

He seemed to be seeing a ghost in broad daylight, and could not feel any more shocked.

But the next moment, he was overjoyed, “You are actually proficient in the Dao of Space as well!?”

Seeing this situation, Yang Kai’s heart sank as he secretly wondered if this guy could…

Before he could finish his thought, Yang Kai sensed something was wrong and was terrified, “Bastard, you can even devour Principle Strength!?”

A look of ecstasy was revealed on the face of Wu Meng Chuan as he spread his arms wide and allowed his mind and body to freely devour everything around him, all while loudly praising, “Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! Space Principles turn out to be so mysterious, no wonder not many people can cultivate them!”

By devouring Yang Kai’s Space Principles, Wu Meng Chuan was comprehending the mysteries of the Dao of Space.

If it continued for a long time like this and he was able to comprehend these mysteries, Wu Meng Chuan would certainly be able to cultivate the Dao of Space and obtain all of Yang Kai’s Space Divine Abilities.

Yang Kai truly realized the terror of the Heaven Devouring Battle Law now.

This Secret Art was indeed a marvellous ability, there was nothing it could not devour!

No matter how incredible Principle Strength was, once it was used by others, the Heaven Devouring Battle Law cultivator could comprehend it by devouring it, then cultivating it as his own. This was blatant robbery, and the victim could not do anything about it.

No wonder during the War of Emperors in the Shattered Star Sea in the past, Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was able to take four top Masters with him to the afterlife. With the Heaven Devouring Battle Law being so Heaven-defying, no one in this world could be his opponent.

This was simply cheating.

“This King is a little reluctant to kill you now,” Wu Meng Chuan looked at Yang Kai in euphoria and shouted, “Little brat, this King is going to give you another chance; stop resisting, open your Knowledge Sea, and allow this King to brand his Soul Imprint onto it. When this King rules the Star Boundary in the future and revives the glory of his Ancestor, this King will allow you to reign over the world too. What do you think?”

“Is there such a good offer?” Yang Kai stared at him with his teeth gritted, waving his hands as he sent out two gigantic Moon Blades towards Wu Meng Chuan.

Wu Meng Chuan’s eyes brighten up again, fixing his eyes on the Moon Blades, as if he had seen something novel.

He rapidly turned to avoid them when the Moon Blades almost slashed him and licked his lips while revealing an avaricious look, “This King really likes your Space Principles. As long as you can assist this King to cultivate and comprehend the Dao of Space, this King will not treat you badly.”

“Good, I will give you whatever you want! But I need one thing from you first!” Yang Kai sneered.

Wu Meng Chuan responded with a sullen face, “If it’s this King’s life, we are done with the conversation.”

Yang Kai replied, “You’re quite smart, are your parents proud of you?”

Wu Meng Chuan reprimanded, “My parents are long dead, this has nothing to do with them! Flame!”

While Wu Meng Chuan yelled in anger, he waved his hand and a ball of flames instantly condensed and charged towards Yang Kai. This flame contained pure Fire Principles and seemed capable of burning everything in existence.

Yang Kai grimaced seeing this as he knew that the Fire Principles contained in this attack were not cultivated and comprehended by Wu Meng Chuan himself, but should be the Principle Strength of others who he devoured through the Heaven Devouring Battle Law. Even so, this Divine Ability could not be underestimated.

“Exile!” Yang Kai stretched his hand out and opened a black hole before him, using it to directly engulf the fireball.

“You never learn!” Wu Meng Chuan’s face turned red as his hands suddenly spread out, releasing two completely different waves of Principles; the left hand burned with fire, the right hand froze with ice. The Principles of Fire and Ice were unleashed together. Surprisingly they did not cancel each other out, but instead perfectly merged into one as Wu Meng Chuan roared, “Have a taste of the original creation of this King, Nine Heavens Ice Fire!”

*Pa… *

He clapped his hands together in front of him, and in an instant, the power of fire and ice burst out violently, rolling up the void and crumbling the world around him.
