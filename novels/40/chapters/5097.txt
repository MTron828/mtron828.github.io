Chapter 5098, Old Ancestor’s Avatar

Apparently, Mu Guang had used her Royal Lord Secret Technique on Yang Kai.

The Royal Lord Secret Technique was a technique that was, naturally, unique to Royal Lords, and they wouldn’t use it unless it was absolutely necessary. That was because even though this Secret Technique was powerful, as even Eighth-Order Masters were powerless to resist it and easily transformed into Black Ink Disciples, it would take the Royal Lord a lot of strength to cast it.

Therefore, on the battlefield, with a Human Old Ancestor around, the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters didn’t have to worry about getting struck by the Royal Lord Secret Technique and becoming Black Ink Disciples. If the Royal Lord really did so, it would give the Old Ancestor a chance to land a heavy blow on them. However, without the Old Ancestor’s deterrence, the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters could only rely on themselves if they came across a Royal Lord.

As expected, after using the Royal Lord Secret Technique, Mu Guang flushed slightly. The pressure that made it difficult for Yang Kai to breathe since her appearance had also weakened.

Despite that, the woman before Yang Kai’s eyes was still a powerful being he could not hope to defeat.

“You indeed have one of the Four Universe Pillars. That smelly girl in Yin-Yang Pass is pretty generous.” Seeing that Yang Kai was still fine, the woman wasn’t one bit surprised. Instead, she seemed to have expected this outcome.

After all, there had to be an explanation for why a Black Ink Disciple had suddenly betrayed them. Only a Human who possessed one of the Four Universe Pillars wouldn’t have to worry about Black Ink Strength or the Royal Lord Secret Technique. It also enabled them to pretend to be a Black Ink Disciple and sneak into the Black Ink Clan to kick up a storm.

However, the cultivators who possessed the Four Universe Pillars that they had come across before were all Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters; none of them was a Seventh-Order Master. Moreover, when Hei Yuan corrupted this Human, he saw him giving up a part of his Small Universe twice. The Human even appeared powerless to turn things around and was determined to sacrifice his life to avoid capture.

Both Hei Yuan and the Royal Lord were fooled. They had never expected that the Humans would be audacious enough to let a Seventh-Order Master own one of the Four Universe Pillars and pretend to be a Black Ink Disciple. Furthermore, he almost succeeded.

Yang Kai had no idea who the ‘smelly girl from Yin-Yang Pass’ that the Royal Lord had mentioned was, but before he could ponder on it, he felt his entire figure stiffen on the spot.

The woman extended her slender hand and said impassively, “Do you think I have no way to deal with you just because you have one of the Four Universe Pillars? Since Nie An is dead, you’ll replace him from now on!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she pushed out her palm.

Endless darkness shaded his vision, and a great sense of danger engulfed his entire figure; however, Yang Kai was powerless to resist. Faced with the Royal Lord’s attack, he was unable to even move.

Right then, he felt a warm stream of energy gathering in his forehead. Following that, something broke out from his figure. At that instant, he broke free from the horrifying pressure and regained his freedom.

On the other hand, Mu Guang let out a cry of surprise.

As a dazzling light expanded, Yang Kai could see a wisp flying out of his forehead and shooting towards Mu Guang. The wisp of light soon turned into a Human form.

It was an old man whose hair and beard were grey with age. Clad in an ordinary robe, he stood there barefooted. His entire figure was covered in a gentle white light, which made him look a bit ethereal and immaterial.

Yang Kai was flabbergasted and unconsciously muttered, “Old Ancestor?”

Yang Kai wouldn’t be mistaken, for he had met the Old Ancestor once when he was in Blue Sky Pass.

But soon, he realised that it wasn’t the Old Ancestor’s true form. It was more like a projection or an Avatar.

That was because the figure that was engulfed in the white light didn’t look like it had a physical body.

In an instant, Yang Kai figured out everything. Previously, he was asked to see the Blue Sky Old Ancestor. Just when he was ready to leave after the meeting ended, the Old Ancestor told him that both the dead and the living were contributors to the Human race. After that, he poked a finger on Yang Kai’s forehead and told him to leave.

Yang Kai had no idea why the Old Ancestor did that. He had even inspected himself but did not find anything of note. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He reckoned that the Old Ancestor must have given him something to help save himself; after all, he possessed the Purifying Light, which was important to the Human race. Therefore, it was expected that the Old Ancestor would treat him differently. The technique was hidden most of the time, but it would be triggered when Yang Kai’s life was at stake.

However, when he and Bai Yi snuck into Zhu Feng’s hideout and fought with the latter, Yang Kai almost lost his life on several occasions. At the most critical moment, he even spat out his own Dragon Bead and engaged in a life-and-death clash with Zhu Feng. Yang Kai eventually managed to kill Zhu Feng. He was in a perilous situation at that time, but the Old Ancestor’s technique didn’t activate.

Hence, Yang Kai thought that his speculation was wrong. The Old Ancestor’s technique was probably not a way to save his life; instead, it might have other uses. It just wasn’t triggered because the right time hadn’t come yet.

As time passed, Yang Kai almost forgot about that incident, but just when he was in danger this time, the technique was triggered and the Old Ancestor’s Avatar appeared!

Yang Kai was elated. It seemed that his speculation was right. The Old Ancestor had really given him a life-saving charm, but that technique would only be triggered when he was facing a Royal Lord and not on lesser occasions.

After a moment of thought, Yang Kai figured out everything. As the Old Ancestor’s Avatar was facing off against Mu Guang, Yang Kai heard him say, “I can only delay her temporarily. Run!”

The next instant, the Old Ancestor’s Avatar clashed with Mu Guang and blocked her violent attack. As their ferocious powers clashed, a ring of light expanded. Space trembled, and the entire universe seemed to be cracking apart.

Struck by the fallout, Yang Kai was sent tumbling away.

With determination written all over his face, he forcefully cast out the ancient coin in his hand. Usually, the ancient coin looked just like any other coin, but at that moment, it spun rapidly and enlarged. Despite being a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master as well as a Grand Dragon, Yang Kai was still dumbstruck after the two powerful Masters clashed. However, the ancient coin wasn’t affected one bit.

In the blink of an eye, the ancient coin expanded to the size of a house. There was a square hole in the middle of the ancient coin and at this moment, violent Space Principle fluctuations could be felt coming from it, causing the local space to ripple and warp.

A slender figure stepped out from the hole in the coin in the next instant. She looked like she was a young woman in her early twenties. With a smile on her face, she called out to Yang Kai and asked, “Are you alright?”

A dumbfounded Yang Kai gazed at her and replied, “You…”

Although he hoped that the ancient coin could save him, he hadn’t expected to see such a sight. He initially thought that the ancient coin was a powerful artifact that could be used to injure the Royal Lord, but it turned out that the ancient coin was actually a kind of artifact that could be used to build a Void Corridor that led to somewhere.

This woman apparently stepped out of the other end of the Void Corridor.

For some reason, Yang Kai found this young woman familiar, as though he had seen her before. Nevertheless, he was certain he had never come across her in his life.

That was because the aura exuding from this woman suggested that she was an Old Ancestor.

The woman waved her hand in front of Yang Kai’s and with a frown, she asked worriedly, “Did you injure your head or something?”

An anxious Yang Kai quickly cupped his fist, “Junior Yang Kai greets Old Ancestor!”

However, the age of an Old Ancestor would naturally not show on her face. Despite looking like she was in her early twenties, she must be an old monster that had lived for at least 10,000 years.

The woman laughed happily, “You don’t have to be overly polite with me.”

Then, she turned her head and said, “Didn’t I tell you to use that ancient coin when you were in mortal danger? Fortunately, that old man left a Secret Technique in your body; otherwise, you wouldn’t have even had a chance to use the ancient coin.”

A sheepish Yang Kai lowered his head, but he was secretly cursing in his heart. He couldn’t help thinking that the Old Ancestor of Yin-Yang Pass was somewhat unreliable. Since the ancient coin was so important, she should have explained its uses clearly to him. Instead, she actually had a little girl pass it to him, which made him think that those from Yin-Yang Pass never provided any help for him. He even thought that if he couldn’t turn things around, he would perish today along with 300 Artifact Refiners.

As they spoke, the fight between the Old Ancestor’s Avatar from Blue Sky Pass and Mu Guang was already in its final stage; after all, it was just an Avatar. Although it had the power of an Old Ancestor, it couldn’t last for long.

As the violent forces dissipated, the two figures separated. Mu Guang stared fixedly at the woman and said through clenched teeth, “It’s you, little bitch!”

The woman refuted, “Mind your language, old hag, or I’ll skin you alive!”

She then gazed at the Old Ancestor’s Avatar from Blue Sky Pass. Presently, the Avatar was dim and flickering, as though it would disappear at any moment.

Noticing the woman’s gaze, the Avatar turned his head and nodded gently, “I’ll leave the rest to you.”

With a solemn expression, the woman replied, “Rest in peace, old man. I’ll certainly avenge you.”

Yang Kai’s brow twitched as he found the whole conversation awkward. The Old Ancestor’s Avatar was indeed going to disappear, but it wasn’t like he was really dying.

With that said, even though it was just an Avatar, its destruction would undoubtedly cause a serious loss to the Old Ancestor. If not for the fact that Yang Kai had made a huge contribution to the Human Race and was of incredible importance, the Old Ancestor wouldn’t have left an Avatar with him.

The Avatar took a glance at Yang Kai, then turned into countless motes of light and dissipated.

“I’ll hold her here!” The Yin-Yang Pass Old Ancestor suddenly yelled. Yang Kai turned his head and saw that she had deliberately folded her arms, as though she was gripping something. With her left hand remaining still, she extended her right hand, like she was drawing out an invisible sword.

As she did that, she really unsheathed a sharp-looking sword!

Mu Guang’s expression turned solemn as the Black Ink Strength around her surged.

“Yang Boy, head in the direction of Yin-Yang Pass. The Army has sortied from the Inner Sanctum. Join up with them!” The Old Ancestor ordered as she raised her sword.

“Yes!” Yang Kai replied and turned around to leave.

Mu Guang couldn’t help looking in that direction.

“What are you looking at, old hag?” The woman yelled. Only half of her sword was unsheathed at this point, but the next instant, she forcefully drew it and disappeared from the spot. When she reappeared, she was right above Mu Guang as she slashed down with her weapon.

Mu Guang roared and lifted both of her hands, blocking the attack with her rich Black Ink Strength.
