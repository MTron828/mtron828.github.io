When Yang Kai woke up, he put Xiao Xiao and Liu Yan away before looking at his Embodiment. After accepting the feedback from it, he immediately understood what the Embodiment had just chatted with Gui Zu about.

After gently nodding his head, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense gushed out like a tide to wrap up the Embodiment.

The next moment, the Embodiment disappeared.

Gui Zu’s jaw dropped again as he tremblingly pointed at Yang Kai and said, “How big is your... your... your Space Ring? Even your Embodiment can fit inside.”

He was absolutely stunned. The Embodiment was a stone giant with a height of three hundred metres, yet it just disappeared into thin air, if it was not taken into Yang Kai’s Space Ring, then where had it gone?

Yang Kai smiled lightly, “I didn’t put it into a Space Ring, I just sent it to another place.”

Naturally, Yang Kai put the Embodiment into the Sealed World Bead as no Space Ring could accommodate its existence.

Gui Zu scratched his head in frustration as he muttered, “This old master can be regarded as an expert, and there aren’t many things that can surprise me in this world, but kid, you... every time, you can cause this old master’s heart to clench.”

What he saw and heard during this period far exceeded his cognition.

Yang Kai laughed loudly, “You’ll get used to it eventually.”

This battle had truly been thrilling, especially at the last moment Zi Long wanted to self-destruct. If Yang Kai did not have the Annihilation Thunder Bead, an Emperor Artifact, he would have had to run away with Gui Zu at the time.

After all, who could withstand the blast of a Second-Order Origin King’s detonation?

Only a blow from the Annihilation Thunder Bead could completely negate such a move.

However, using an Emperor Artifact had directly emptied Yang Kai’s strength. Although the effects were outstanding, the Annihilation Thunder Bead was clearly still dangerous to use.

Just remembering the feeling of all his strength being drained to the point his body went limp caused Yang Kai some lingering fear.

“Forget it, let’s not talk about this, let’s see what we’ve gained this time,” Yang Kai quickly changed the subject, reached out, and summoned four Space Rings onto his palm.

These four Space Rings were all extremely high-end and were naturally owned by the four who Yang Kai and Gui Zu just killed.

Even Gui Zu’s eyes began to shine as he rubbed his hands in anticipation.

He very much enjoyed the feeling of killing others and taking their possessions, and although he had not done it that many times in his life, each time he had he had gained greatly.

Not to mention, of the four rings in front of him now, three belonged to Origin Kings while the last belonged to Zi Dong, who despite being an Origin Realm cultivator was also the Young Master of Purple Star, so how could his ring not contain amazing wealth?

Yang Kai picked up one of the rings casually and swept it with his Divine Sense, but in the next moment, his face suddenly sank and he cursed, “Which bastard does this ring belong to? Why is there nothing good inside? Could he really be so poor?”

“That’s not possible, is it?” Gui Zu was stunned and took the ring from Yang Kai’s hand and swept it with his Divine Sense before also cursing, “F*$k, this bastard really is poor! Isn’t he embarrassed?”

Neither of them knew who this ring belonged to but at a glance, they could tell there were only a few hundred thousand Saint Crystals left in it, along with some miscellaneous things that were of little value.

“It has some traces of Xu Wei’s aura on it, it looks like it was his,” Gui Zu spat disdainfully, “His death isn’t worth pitying.”

What neither of them knew was that all the good things in Xu Wei’s ring were divided up by Zi Long and Zi Dong. It would be more strange if anything good was still left inside.

“En, this is much better!” Yang Kai searched another ring and his foul mood was immediately fixed. Obviously, this ring was well stocked. Tossing it over to Gui Zu, Yang Kai said casually, “Supreme Elder should take a look, if you need anything, just help yourself.”

“Sect Master is too generous, hahahaha. Then, this old master won’t refuse,” Gui Zu had always been a loner, so it was difficult for him to find any good cultivation resources. Now that so many good things were placed in front of him, he couldn’t help snatching the ring and rummaging through it, soon grinning as he commented, “Hey, there’s some Solid Gold Star Sand in here. If it is used for Artifact Refining, it could definitely refine an Origin King Grade artifact. It’s said this ore is only produced in Galaxy Ridge. It looks like this is Kong Fa’s ring, oh... so many herbs as well! It looks like this old dog gained a lot in the Severed World.”

“Leave the herbs behind. When we return to High Heaven Sect, I’ll have them made into pills for you,” Yang Kai said casually.

“This old master knows,” Gui Zu grinned.

After a while, Yang Kai tossed another ring over and Gui Zu rummaged through it again before returning it to Yang Kai.

“There’s only one left, and it should be Zi Long’s ring. I am really looking forward to what’s inside. Purple Star’s Sect Master should have many good things on him, right?” Gui Zu had to wipe the saliva from the corner of his mouth as his eyes stared fixedly.

Yang Kai browsed through the ring before putting on a strange expression, “There are indeed many good things, but there is also this...”

As he spoke, Yang Kai opened his hand and summoned a round, bowl-like artifact. This round bowl looked quite simple, but the aura which surrounded it made one’s Soul feel comfortable.

“Isn’t this the thing Zi Long summoned just now?” Gui Zu examined it curiously, “Oh, it’s made from Soul Sustaining Wood. No wonder it was able to collect the Soul of a dead cultivator. Purple Star really can’t be underestimated.”

Yang Kai just chuckled lightly and said, “It’s one of the top three forces in the Star Field. Without enough background and strength, it would have been eliminated long ago.”

As he spoke, his eyes flashed and he sent a stream of pure Spiritual Energy into the Soul Sustaining Bowl as he shouted, “Get out!”

The next moment, a miserable howl sounded from the Soul Sustaining Bowl and an illusory figure appeared inside it.

Naturally, it was Zi Dong.

Enduring the pain coming from his Soul, he looked around blankly but when he saw Yang Kai and Gui Zu smirking at him unkindly, his expression suddenly changed, “How could it be you?”

“If it wasn’t us, who else would it be?” Gui Zu taunted, causing Zi Dong’s Soul Avatar to tremble, as if it were about to break apart.

“Where is my father? Where is my father!?” Zi Dong yelled in a panic. He had been hiding inside the Soul Sustaining Bowl and thought that the next time he came out would be when his father helped him reshape his body. Seeing these two detestable faces instead, what was left of his Soul shivered and his blood ran cold, or it would have if he had any.

“Since we’re safe and sound, what do you think Zi Long’s fate was?” Yang Kai sneered.

Zi Dong’s expression changed as he shouted hysterically, “Impossible! That’s impossible! My father is Purple Star’s Sect Master, a Second-Order Origin King! There are not many in this world who can match him much less kill him. With just the two of you, it’s absolutely impossible such a thing happened!”

As he spoke, his confidence seemed to increase as he screamed at Yang Kai angrily, “Don’t lie to me!”

“Ha!” Yang Kai sneered, “Why would I bother lying to you? What good would that do me? Forget it, I do not want to bother with you anymore. Supreme Elder, your Soul Banner could use Soul for nourishment, right? I’ll leave this brat in your hands.”

“Jie Jie... sounds good,” Gui Zu smiled strangely as he took out the Ten Thousand Soul Banner, “In any case, he’s still a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator. After refining him, this old master’s Ten Thousand Soul Banner will surely strengthen once more.”

As he spoke, countless twisted human faces appeared out of the Ten Thousand Soul Banner, wailing ferociously as if they smelled a delicious meal, all of them soon turning towards Zi Dong.

Zi Dong was so frightened his Soul nearly shattered and he quickly hid inside the Soul Sustaining Bowl as he cried out, “Don’t kill me, don’t kill me! I am Purple Star’s Young Master! We can talk about this! What benefits do you want? Whatever it is I can give it to you!”

“You’re quite the dumb one aren’t you, kid? What benefits could you possibly give this old master in your current state? Come now, this old master’s Ten Thousand Soul Banner is hungry!” Gui Zu snorted coldly, remaining unmoved.

“A Star Emperor Token!” At that moment, Yang Kai suddenly let out a shout as a look of excitement filled his face. Taking a token out of Zi Long’s Space Ring, Yang Kai looked it over carefully before shouting once more, “It’s really a Star Emperor Token!”

Gui Zu stared at him in amazement, “Why are you so excited? This old master remembers giving you a Star Emperor Token back then, right? This one even seems to have been used long ago and no longer has any worth.”

The joy on Yang Kai’s face remained undiminished though as he simply glanced over at Gui Zu and said, “Supreme Elder may not know but there is a grand mystery hidden inside the Star Emperor Tokens. If one can collect all nine of them, this secret will be revealed.”

“A grand secret?” Gui Zu said with some suspicion, “Will that secret allow this old master to reach the peak of the Martial Dao?”

“May... maybe!” A weak voice came. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Yang Kai and Gui Zu stared at Zi Dong who had just spoken out.

“What do you know?” Yang Kai looked at him seriously. Regardless of anything else, Zi Dong was the Young Master of Purple Star, so there was a chance he did know some secrets about the Star Emperor Tokens.

Zi Dong’s Soul flickered slightly as he turned to Gui Zu and implored, “Senior, can you put away this artifact first? I... I’m quite scared.”

“Useless thing,” Gui Zu coldly snorted, reached out, and put away the Ten Thousand Soul Banner.

Zi Dong stood up inside the Soul Sustaining Bowl and wiped the non-existent cold sweat from his forehead, took a few breaths, then carefully asked, “If I tell you, will you let me go?”

“Supreme Elder, swallow him!” Yang Kai shouted loudly.

“With pleasure!” Gui Zu summoned the Ten Thousand Soul Banner again.

“Wait, wait, wait! I said wait! Please!” Zi Dong almost wept.

“Coward!” Yang Kai spat disdainfully.

“Talk!” Gui Zu also threatened from the side, urging the hostility of his Ten Thousand Soul Banner from time to time to create more pressure on Zi Dong.

Zi Dong sobbed as he haltingly spoke, “Wu wu... Actually, I don’t know much... But when I heard my father chatting with a few Elders once, I heard them say that if one collected all the Star Emperor Tokens, they would be able to... able to glimpse the secrets of the Great Emperor!”

“The secrets of the Great Emperor!” Both Yang Kai and Gui Zu were shocked.

“Is that true?” Yang Kai stared at Zi Dong fixedly.

“That is what I heard... and, it is said that those words were spoken by the Great Emperor himself back when he still roamed the Star Field. You probably don’t know, but my Purple Star’s ancestors had some interaction with the Great Emperor over ten thousand years ago... wu wu, that’s all I know, please don’t hurt me, I don’t want to die!”
