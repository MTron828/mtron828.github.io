After being reminded by Yang Kai, Yu Ying finally came to her senses and she immediately started undressing herself. After a while, she had completely stripped herself, leaving only a set of undergarments that were as thin as cicada’s wings and completely transparent.

Black lines immediately appeared on Yang Kai’s face at the sight of this and he couldn’t help but ask, “Junior Sister Yu, what are you doing?”

Yu Ying justified herself, “I can’t even sense where the seal is. I hope that it’s on the clothes.”

Yang Kai was rendered speechless, “It’s on your shoulder, focus your Divine Sense to look for it!”

The Scattered Soul Seal was indeed pretty well hidden, and had it not been for Yang Kai’s extraordinarily powerful Divine Sense, he would not have been able to easily find it. Now, with Yang Kai’s guidance, Yu Ying hastily gathered her Divine Sense on her delicate shoulder.

After a while, a smile bloomed on her face. Obviously, she had found something.

Who knew what Secret Technique she had cast, but as the two escaped, Yang Kai could feel the Scattered Soul Seal slowly dissipating before finally vanishing into nothing.

Only then did Yu Ying heave a sigh of relief. She then took out a new set of clothing from her Space Ring and put it on.

Now that there was no Scattered Soul Seal, the two of them only needed to run faster and get rid of the Brahma Holy Land disciples to be safe.

After having gotten free of the worries, Yu Ying finally thanked Yang Kai, “Many thanks, Senior Brother Feng, for everything you did just now.”

Yang Kai indifferently responded, “You’re welcome.”

As if she had sensed his indifference, Yu Ying couldn’t help but look a little sad. She was wondering whether this Senior Brother Feng was angry at her because of what just happened; after all, she had indeed gone overboard. Had it been someone else, they would have surely been angry.

After escaping for half an hour like this, Yu Ying’s already pale face whitened even more. She was out of breath and although her Secret Technique was easy to use, it consumed a lot of her energy. It was difficult to maintain their speed.

Yang Kai, seeing that she had slowed down, summoned his ship and proposed, “Get on, I will take you with me!”

Yu Ying immediately nodded her agreement before jumping straight onto his ship. She sat down cross-legged and started stuffing herself with restorative pills. While at it, she took out a communication artifact and continuously sent out messages. Apparently, she was trying to contact some Netherworld Sect disciples.

Seeing this, Yang Kai was secretly elated. He hoped that Yu Ying could connect with Yin Le Sheng at once.

The Brahma Holy Land disciples seemed to have been thrown far behind as when Yang Kai spread his Divine Sense, he was unable to find them.

One day later, Yu Ying’s pretty eyes suddenly lit up and she shouted in a low voice, “Senior Brother Feng, I found someone from my Sect.”

Yang Kai was overjoyed and immediately asked, “Who?”

Yu Ying replied, “It’s Senior Brother Zhong, Zhong Zhen Yong. I wonder if you have heard of him or not?”

[It’s not Yin Le Sheng.] Yang Kai was a little disappointed, but he still replied, “I don’t know much about the Eastern Territory as I have never been there, so I haven’t heard of your Senior Brother Zhong.”

Yu Ying explained with a smile, “Senior Brother Zhong ranks among the top three in the Dao Source Realm within our Sect. If we can get his protection, we don’t need to be afraid of those Brahma Holy Land disciples. We should look for him right away.”

“Good, lead the way!” Yang Kai nodded.

Although Yu Ying couldn’t reach Yin Le Sheng, Yang Kai felt that it might not be impossible to inquire about Ying Le Sheng from this Zhong Zhen Yong; after all, maybe Zhong Zhen Yong knew something they didn’t.

Next, Yang Kai changed direction under Yu Ying’s guidance and flew towards a certain place.

After an hour, a figure standing in the void entered Yang Kai’s vision. Yang Kai immediately piloted his ship toward this figure and even before the ship could come to halt, Yu Ying rushed out in joy and cried, “Senior Brother Zhong!”

“Junior Sister Yu!” Zhong Zheng Yong smiled at Yu Ying before he raised his eyes and indifferently gazed at Yang Kai while asking, “Is this the Brother Feng that Junior Sister Yu mentioned?”

He directly spoke Yang Kai’s false name, so obviously, Yu Ying had already informed him about Yang Kai before coming here.

Yu Ying agreed with a nod, “Yes, Senior Brother Zhong. Junior Sister was only able to safely come here thanks to Senior Brother Feng.”

Zhong Zhen Yong was handsome and suave and seemed to have an amiable air around him without much arrogance. Having gotten the confirmation, he glanced at Yang Kai and asked, “I heard Junior Sister Yu say that you are from the Grand Desolation Star Field and a Star Master, just like Junior Brother Yin?”

Yang Kai politely cupped his fists and replied, “This Feng is indeed from the Grand Desolation Star Field and is also a Star Master, just like Senior Brother Yin. I haven’t seen Senior Brother Yin for many years and miss him very much, so I took the liberty to come with Junior Sister Yu here. I hope Senior Brother Zhong will forgive me.”

Zhong Zhen Yong broke into laughter as he stated, “No worries, no worries, since you intend to join our Netherworld Sect, we might be fellow Brothers in the future, so there’s no need to be so polite.”

Yu Ying added, “Senior Brother Zhong, this is not the right place to talk. Senior Brother Feng and I were being chased by Zhang Hao and Zhang Xian of Brahma Holy Land. I don’t know if they are still chasing after us. Let’s talk while on the move.”

“Zhang Hao, Zhang Xian!” Zhong Zhen Yong’s eyes glistened with a cold gleam as asked in a cold voice, “They dared to chase you? What for?”

Yu Ying apologetically replied, “Junior Sister accidentally killed Deng Yong…”

Zhong Zhen Yong angrily looked at her and asked, “He died because of the exhaustion of his Source Qi, am I right? How many times have I told you not to improve your strength like this! It will cause your foundation to become unstable and can also lead to an accident…”

“Yes, yes!” Yu Ying, seeing Zhong Zhen Yong about to lay bare all her past scandals in front of Yang Kai, immediately interrupted him and coquettishly reminded, “Let’s go quickly. Thanks to Senior Brother Feng, I am finally safe and sound. Senior Brother Feng is my saviour.”

“Then you better treat others a little better in the future,” Zhong Zhen Yong slightly smiled.

It seemed that because Yu Ying had said so many good things about Yang Kai, Zhong Zhen Yong’s attitude towards Yang Kai’s was pleasant. Obviously, he wanted to become friends with Yang Kai.

Under Yu Ying’s repeated urging, the three of them immediately set off.

Zhong Zhen Yong seemed to already have a destination in mind as he led the way without saying a word. Yang Kai and Yu Ying were left with no choice but to quietly follow after him.

After flying for a while, Yu Ying couldn’t help but ask, “Senior Brother Zhong, where are we going?”

“I’m looking for the others. They seemed to have found a very interesting place.”

“A very interesting place?” Yu Ying’s eyes lit up as she immediately asked, “What’s interesting about it?”

“You will know when you get there,” Zhong Zhen Yong left her hanging and didn’t explain anymore.

Yang Kai’s expression changed as he asked, “Will Senior Brother Yin be there as well?”

Zhong Zhen Yong replied, “I don’t know. I also received a call from another disciple and was rushing over when I suddenly received a message from Junior Sister Yu. So, I stopped and waited for you.” He glanced at Yang Kai and stated with a smile, “Brother Feng and Junior Brother Yin must have a very good relationship for you to be so anxious to meet him.”

Yang Kai’s heart jumped as he realized that he had acted too eagerly. Nevertheless, he maintained the same expression as he explained himself, “Senior Brother Yin helped me a lot in the Grand Desolation Star Field in my early years and I have never gotten the opportunity to repay him. Naturally, I’m concerned about him.”

“You owe a debt of gratitude and hope to recompense it! Brother Feng is also a man with brotherly sentiments. My Netherworld Sect will gladly welcome someone like you,” Zheng Zhon Yong broke into laughter.

Yang Kai replied, “It is this Feng’s honour to join the Netherworld Sect. But I don’t know how high the threshold of your noble Sect is.”

Zhong Zhen Yong patted Yang Kai’s shoulder and said, “Rest assured, you will be fine.”

“Then, let me thank Senior Brother Zhong for his kind words in advance.”

The three chatted as they continued with their journey.

After two days, a huge dark red star suddenly came into view.

When their eyes laid on this star, whether it was Zhong Zhen Yong, Yu Ying, or Yang Kai, they were all shocked.

Ever since they entered the Shattered Star Sea, all the Cultivation Stars they had encountered were shattered. They had never seen a complete star; however, at this moment, one such star was right before their eyes.

The star was enormous and seemed quite ancient. Looking at it, it looked like a giant eye indifferently watching over the surroundings, causing everyone to shudder at the sight of it. It even gave off some kind of inexplicable pressure.

Not only that, this Cultivation Star was also radiating a terrifying heat, so much that even the space around it appeared to be distorting. In addition, there were countless black holes of varying sizes around this Star. When everyone turned their attention towards these black holes, it felt as if they would be completely devoured by them.

“Senior Brother Zhong…” Yu Ying’s pretty face slightly turned pale as she leaned against Zhong Zhen Yong a little as she asked, “Is this the interesting place you mentioned?”

Zhong Zhen Yong replied with a grin, “Exactly!”

Yang Kai’s expression changed as he stated, “What dense Source Strength. Furthermore… it seems to be a little different from a normal Source Strength…”

Zhong Zhen Yong explained with a nod, “That’s because it is a Fire Attribute Star Source, not just an ordinary Star Source. If a cultivator cultivating a Fire Attribute Secret Art or Secret Technique can obtain this Source Strength, his or her strength would soar!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“A Fire Attribute Star Source!” Yang Kai’s expression changed and he immediately thought of Liu Yang.

This would be extremely useful for Liu Yan! But Yang Kai hadn’t seen her after we had parted ways some time ago. It was a mystery whether she knew about this Fire Attribute Star Source.

However, Liu Yan was currently with Zhang Ruo Xi, and this Cultivation Star seemed like a dangerous spot, so even if Liu Yan had sensed this Fire Attribute Star Source, Zhang Ruo Xi might not be able to get close since her strength is still too low.

[Since it is here, if I can obtain and collect this Fire Attribute Star Source, I can just leave it for Liu Yan.]

Yang Kai secretly made up his mind as he became interested in this strange star.

And in that momentary loss of concentration, a sense of crisis suddenly flooded Yang Kai’s heart. Immediately after which a matchless burst of energy flew towards his face.

Yang Kai’s expression slightly changed as he saw a giant ghost claw piercing towards his heart.

This wasn’t the first time he saw such a ghost claw. When he had first encountered Yu Ying, he had seen her use this Secret Technique to fight with Guan Qi. It could be considered a symbol of the Netherworld Sect.

In a flash, Yang Kai understood who had sneak-attacked him.

If any ordinary cultivator had been sneak-attacked at such a close range and without any prior warning, he or she would have been completely powerless to resist, but Yang Kai cultivated the Dao of Space, so it was easy for him to sense and avoid such a sneak-attack.

At the critical moment, he directly used Nihility, turning his body illusory.

The ghastly ghost claw pierced through Yang Kai’s body, flying toward the depths of the void before disappearing very soon after.

Yang Kai’s figure solidified again as he coldly glared at Zhong Zhen Yong.
