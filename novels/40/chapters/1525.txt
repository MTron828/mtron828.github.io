Atop the main square, Ye Xi Yun stood proudly mid-air with more than two hundred Star Emperor Mountain cultivators all looking up at her.

Yang Xiu Zhu and the others glanced at each other, and feeling that the time was right, they quickly half-kneeled on the ground and shouted in a loud voice, “Subordinates welcome Sect Master’s return to the mountain!”

“Subordinates welcome Sect Master’s return to the mountain!” The others Yang Xiu Zhu had contacted in advance also followed up, half-kneeling and echoing loudly in unison.

Those who were not informed all witnessed this and, realizing the flow of events, also offered similar greetings.

A large part of these people had no opinion either way as to who should be the Sect Master, not preferring Ye Xi Yun or the current Sect Master. They belonged to the faction which simply wished to not get involved in any trouble, so seeing the trend of events flowing in a particular direction, they simply followed along.

The trio lead by Bai Xi who arrived earlier were now panicking, their faces going from red to blue, looking extremely disturbed and anxious.

“Bai Xi!” Yang Xiu Zhu yelled, “The Sect Master stands before you, why haven’t you kneeled!”

“She is no longer the Sect Master, that position is occupied by another now. Why must this old master bow to her?” Bai Xi coldly snorted. He was a sharp old fox and knew that the situation was hopeless, but what he hadn’t expected was that even after a hundred years of painstaking management, the current Sect Master still hadn’t been able to accumulate enough prestige. On the contrary, Ye Xi Yun only had to re-appear after a hundred years and the current Sect Master’s foundation collapsed to pieces.

The current Sect Master’s status looked quite ridiculous at this moment.

On the one hand, it was only natural for Ye Xi Yun to be held in such high regard considering her noble and fair character. On the other hand, it was also natural for the current Sect Master, who used a plot to usurp his position, violating millennia of traditions passed from by their ancestors, to be despised!

Regardless of righteousness or tradition, the current Sect Master simply couldn’t measure up to Ye Xi Yun.

Bai Xi was certain that even if he surrendered now, it would not help him one bit. After Ye Xi Yun took care of the current Sect Master, the next to be killed would likely be him.

That was why he refused to give in!

“Impudence!” Yang Xiu Zhu slowly got up, his eyes flashing a cold light as he glared at Bai Xi, clear murderous intent pulsing from his body.

Lin Yu Rao and Chu Han Yi also moved at this moment, using profound movement skills to suddenly appear on the left and right sides of Bai Xi, cutting off all avenues of escape.

“Bai Xi, the ancestral precepts state that no Star Emperor Mountain disciple can kill another, but out of respect for our many years of brotherhood, I will give you one chance to cripple your cultivation and commit suicide!” Yang Xiu Zhu declared to Bai Xi indifferently.

“You want this Bai to waste his cultivation?” Bai Xi laughed, “Yang Xiu Zhu, are you perhaps sleep talking? Since the ancestors declared that we cannot kill one another, I’d like to see how you force this Bai to submit!”

He unexpectedly wore a confident and complacent look.

Yang Xiu Zhu frowned, his expression turning frigid.

A few days ago, one of the main caveats they had made when agreeing to help Yang Kai was that none of them would participate in the fighting or contaminate themselves with the blood of their brothers and sisters. The reason for this was precisely because of the restraints of their ancestral traditions. Now though it looked like Bai Xi was going to shamelessly take advantage of this point, making Yang Xiu Zhu feel somewhat awkward.

“Star Emperor Mountain disciples really can’t kill one another, but this Queen is now High Heaven Sect’s Great Elder, so there’s no problem if I take care of you,” Ye Xi Yun snorted coldly before lifting her jade hand, then lightly pressing her palm downwards, as if she was just gently brushing the air.

However, Bai Xi instantly went into a panic as his eyes bulged and his Saint Qi madly burst together with his Shi as he lifted both his hands towards the sky.

*Kacha...*

A silent explosion occurred deep in the depths of Bai Xi’s soul and, as if struck by lightning, his body trembled and staggered backwards. Opening his mouth, Bai Xi coughed up a bloody mist before he stared up towards Ye Xi Yun incredulously and shouted, “Your Shi has reached the grand accomplishment stage!?”

As soon as this statement came out, everyone’s eyes bulged as they stared towards Ye Xi Yun in shock.

Only when a cultivator broke through to the Origin Returning Realm would they be able to comprehend Shi, and only when one’s Shi reached the grand accomplishment stage would they be eligible to break through to the Origin King Realm.

This was a necessary condition, otherwise, no matter how much one cultivated as an Origin Returning Realm master, it would be impossible to touch the threshold of the Origin King Realm.

Origin Realm masters on Shadowed Star were as numerous as the hairs on an ox; the main square here actually had more than one hundred and fifty cultivators of this level gathered, but none of them had managed to cultivate their Shi to the grand accomplishment stage, even Yang Xiu Zhu and the others all felt that they had yet to completely master their Shi.

This was a realm they simply could not reach.

But now, they had witnessed a true grand accomplishment stage Shi!

When Ye Xi Yun struck, it had been silent and invisible, but the fluctuations of her Shi were still obvious. Everyone had clearly felt the power which directly destroyed Bai Xi’s defences and seriously wounded him!

As Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators, the gap between Ye Xi Yun and Bai Xi was clear.

However, Yang Xiu Zhu and the others present somehow felt that Ye Xi Yun’s Shi seemed to be somewhat qualitatively different from their own.

“Fool, do you think this Queen was using Shi?” Ye Xi Yun snorted softly. After that strike, she had not bothered following up immediately, instead just looking down below coldly with a mocking expression.

“That was not Shi... then...” Bai Xi’s mind turned sharply, and soon his face lost all coloured as he pointed towards Ye Xi Yun in terror, “Could it be that you...”

“Domain!” Yang Xiu Zhu let out a gasp, his eyes suddenly bursting with shock as his body trembled with excitement.

He immediately understood why he felt that Ye Xi Yun’s Shi was a little different from his own.

He recalled some secrets recorded in the Sect’s ancient books at that moment.

It was rumoured that when one cultivated their Shi to the grand accomplishment stage, they would gain some comprehension of the mysteries of a Domain. This was a power that only Origin Kings could master and was many times more powerful than Shi.

Domain!

This was a height that Shadowed Star’s cultivators could never reach.

Could it be said that their Sect Master had reached this state? However, looking again, Ye Xi Yun was clearly still just a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, so there could only be one explanation.

That is, Ye Xi Yun’s cultivation had reached the absolute limit of the Origin Realm and she now had the qualifications to break through to the Origin King Realm, but because of the suppression of Shadowed Star’s World Principles, she has been unable to break through.

[A harrowing reality!] Yang Xiu Zhu sighed.

Although they lived in an isolated place like Shadowed Star, Yang Xiu Zhu knew that even considering the entire Star Field, there were very few Origin King Realm masters, and each one was an extremely prestigious existence. Their Sect Master had the talent and aptitude to reach this level, but she was simply born in the wrong place. Shadowed Star had become a cage that prevented her from truly spreading her wings and soaring!

“Former Sect Master deserves her reputation as a genius only seen once in ten thousand years, this Bai is truly impressed!” Bai Xi clasped his, clenched his teeth and shouted fiercely, “But so what? Although this Bai’s strength is truly inferior to yours, if you wish to kill me, you must be willing to pay the price!”

As soon as he spoke these words, Bai Xi flicked his wrist and summoned a longan sized bead into his hand.

Emperor Pressure immediately filled the air!

Everyone present paled.

“Annihilation Thunder Bead!” Ye Xi Yun narrowed her eyes, “Is this what you’re relying on?”

“So what if it is?” Bai Xi laughed, “This Bai knows what former Sect Master is capable of, but can you block this Emperor Artifact? If This Bai must die here today, he will at least be able to bury you along with him! Now, why don’t we all sit down and have a good talk to come up with a way to resolve this conflict?”

“I refuse!”

An indifferent voice suddenly rang out from a short distance away.

This voice was strange and barely anyone on the scene had heard it before. Turning to look at the source of the sound, everyone saw a young man with a heroic look and a sardonic smile on his face walking over towards them unhurriedly.

“Yang Kai!” Bai Xi narrowed his eyes and shouted.

Many cultivators from Star Emperor Mountain wore strange expressions.

Who Yang Kai was, most of them had no clue; after all, they had not even heard the news of Ye Xi Yun resurfacing, so it was only natural for them to not know about Yang Kai’s existence.

Seeing that this young man was only a First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, yet he had dared to rashly intrude upon Star Emperor Mountain, many felt quite puzzled.

However, even in this tense moment, these people did not become confused and simply assumed that this Yang Kai boy must have followed Ye Xi Yun here. Not saying anything, they all just observed Yang Kai curiously, wondering why he did not show any fear towards the Emperor Artifact.

One had to know that this was an artifact that even Ye Xi Yun could not possibly resist head-on.

“Taking that thing out just to scare people again,” Yang Kai curled his lips with a look of disdain, “Old dog, if you’re ready to die, then go ahead and use that Thunder Bead, you will certainly be able to kill me or Great Elder, so you won’t suffer a loss, but... are you prepared?”

Bai Xi’s face sank as he glared towards Yang Kai savagely and shouted, “Little brat, don’t go too far!”

“Am I the one that is going too far?” Yang Kai grinned meaningfully as he quipped, “Old dog, are you really so ignorant of your situation? This Sect Master is standing right in front of you, so all you have to do is use the power of that Thunder Bead. If I can’t avoid it, I will die, but you will die too. If I can avoid it though, I’ll live but you’ll still die. So what choice will you make?”

Bai Xi’s face went from blue to white as he gripped the Emperor Artifact in his hand, not daring to take any rash actions.

No matter what he chose to do, he would definitely die a miserable death, causing him to hesitate.

“Of course, there is a third option,” Yang Kai grinned extremely brightly.

“And what’s that?” Bai Xi became curious.

“Hand over the Emperor Artifact to me, and I’ll spare your life!”

“In your dreams!” Bai Xi exclaimed.

On Shadowed Star, Origin King Grade artifacts were few and far between, each one a hallowed treasure of a powerful Sect, not to mention Emperor Artifacts. After experiencing the power of an Emperor Artifact, how could Bai Xi be willing to just surrender it?

What’s more, he wouldn’t believe Yang Kai’s rhetoric. Likely, the moment he handed over the Emperor Artifact, he would become a fresh corpse.

“In that case, don’t blame this Sect Master for being ruthless!” Yang Kai declared impatiently before shouting, “Come out!”

With this shout, the clouds up above suddenly began to churn and a moment later, a one-hundred-meter-long, pitch-black Starship strangely appeared.

It was as if the Starship had always been there, yet no one had noticed it.

A great uproar spread among the numerous cultivators gathered below, all of them revealing looks of shock and disbelief.

There were many cultivators here, most of whom were Origin Returning Realm masters, yet no one had noticed this Starship hiding so close by, an astonishing revelation. If it had not taken the initiative to show itself, it was likely everyone present would have remained ignorant.

Moreover, this Starship seemed quite unusual, far more powerful than any Starship they had seen before, almost as if... it was an Origin King Grade Starship!

The sight of it made the audience dumbfounded!
