“Elder Sister, you’re right,” Zhao Xing Chen nodded repeatedly. He quickly sobered up and asked as his eyes lit up, “Then what’s Brother-in-law’s plan?”

The woman shook her head, “I have no idea what’s on your Brother-in-law’s mind. He didn’t say anything before he left. What’s more, I’m just a woman, why would I care about all these things? All I know is that Scarlet Star wouldn’t abandon its foundation for one man.”

Zhao Xingchen clapped his hands, “I understand!”

He looked in the direction of Yang Kai’s mansion as a big grin appeared on his face, “Yang Kai, let’s see how you’ll escape this time!” His face lit up with joy at the thought of watching Yang Kai being cut to pieces by Thunder Light and Sword Pavilion.

At this moment, the Star City was once again thrown into chaos after an uncomfortable pause. Although Scarlet Star disciples were maintaining order, how could they control so many people? Everyone was clamouring for Scarlet Star to deactivate the defensive Grand Array and let them leave the city.

Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light’s 3,000-strong force had surrounded the Star City. If they really launched an attack, the entire Star City would be affected. At that time, all of them would most likely become collateral damage.

However, how could Scarlet Star’s side deactivate the Grand Array so easily? Before they could get a complete read on Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light’s intentions, rashly opening the Grand Array was no different from courting death.

This Grand Array was Scarlet Star’s final line of defence!

Inside the meeting hall, Chen Tian Fei and the other Managers were all in a terrible fix. The normally calm Lady Qin was no longer interested in playing her zither as her black brows happened to be knit tightly as she sat there like a bitter older woman abandoned by her husband of many years.

The entire hall was filled with a gloomy atmosphere.

“What should we do now? Everyone, let’s hear what you have to say.” Chen Tian Fei turned to the others.

Bei Yu Shan’s face was brimming with anger, “Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light aren’t taking my Scarlet Star seriously at all. They actually led so many people to attack us. I suggest that we gather all our disciples and fight them to the death! We should let them know that our Scarlet Star isn’t that easy to bully!”

“Are you being serious?” Chen Tian Fei couldn’t help cursing. Sometimes he really wanted to smash this guy’s head open and see what he was thinking.

Ou Yang Lie frowned, “What did Head Manager say?”

Chen Tian Fei slowly shook his head, “I’ve already sent a message to Head Manager, but I don’t know if it is because he is in a critical state of retreat but he still hasn’t replied.”

Ou Yang Lie couldn’t help but furrow his brow. At this time, if the Head Manager didn’t step in, it would be difficult for them to handle the situation.

Ou Yang Bing added, “It’s also possible Head Manager feels that this matter has not reached the point where Scarlet Star’s survival is at stake. After all, the one who provoked Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light was not my Scarlet Star, but that guy!”

Chen Tian Fei corrected, “Although that’s the case, he is still Scarlet Star’s Sixth Manager. His every word and action represents Scarlet Star. Whatever he does outside has been imprinted with Scarlet Star’s mark.”

Ou Yang Bing suggested, “No matter what, we must first figure out what Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light wants.”

As soon as these words were spoken, a vigorous voice rang out from outside, “Sword Pavilion’s Zhong Fan has come to pay his respects. I ask the Managers of Scarlet Star to show themselves!”

The sound was like the roar of a dragon. Although it was not loud, everyone in the Star City heard it clearly.

It seemed he was trying to use peaceful means before resorting to force.

Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light had joined forces and had amassed around 3,000 people. Even if Scarlet Star had a defensive Grand Array, it would still be useless if so many were to attack this Star City. However, the fact that the other party had asked Scarlet Star Managers to meet undoubtedly confirmed many people’s previous speculations.

Scarlet Star wasn’t some weakling, so if Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light did rashly start a war, both sides would suffer heavy losses.

Inside the main hall, Chen Tian Fei and the others looked at each other, not knowing how to respond. Suddenly, Chen Tian Fei’s expression changed as he took out a communication artifact and a look of joy on his face, “It’s Head Manager!”

Lady Qin, the Ou Yang Brothers, and Bei Yu Shan instantly looked over. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Chen Tian Fei used his Divine Sense and quickly sent a message back.

Lady Qin’s red lips parted slightly as she softly asked, “What did Head Manager say?”

Chen Tian Fei put away his communication bead and said, “Head Manager has given us the full authority to handle this matter, he won’t interfere.”

[What’s the meaning of this?] The Managers were confused.

At this moment, Zhong Fan repeated his previous invitation, but this time he sounded a little impatient.

Lady Qin sighed and suggested, “No matter what, let’s go meet him first.”

“That damn Brat, he caused trouble outside and actually wants my Scarlet Star to clean up his mess,” Ou Yang Lie cursed. Compared to Ou Yang Bing, his temper was more volatile.

When Zhong Fan shouted for the third time, five figures rose from the Star City’s center and rushed over.

“It’s the Managers of Scarlet Star!” Someone shouted.

“They finally came out. If they didn’t come out now, Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light would surely have attacked us.” Another person secretly wiped away his cold sweat. If the situation really developed to such a point, they would not have been able to escape from this predicament either.

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, Chen Tian Fei and the others flew a thousand meters away from Zhong Fan and stood just behind the eight layers of the defensive Grand Array.

Chen Tian Fei smiled and cupped his fist, “So it is the Managers of Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light, please forgive this Chen for not coming out to greet you sooner.”

Zhong Fan remained calm while Luo Qing Yun’s cold eyes swept over the group, seemingly searching for something, but in the end, he couldn’t help snorting coldly after being unable to find it.

Chen Tian Fei didn’t feel embarrassed when the other party gave him the cold shoulder even when he had shown respect. He knew that the other party had come here in anger, so why should he show respect when they couldn’t even see their enemy?

Still smiling, Chen Tian Fei asked, “May I ask why everyone has come?”

Luo Qing Yun sneered, “Don’t you know why we’ve come? Why ask even though you already know?”

Chen Tian Fei forced a laugh and looked below. He saw a crowd of tens of thousands of people staring in their direction with all kinds of emotions flashing across their eyes. He heaved a sigh secretly before sending a Divine Sense transmission to Zhong Fan.

No one knew what he was talking about, but Zhong Fan simply nodded lightly and just spoke a single word in response, “Good!”

Afterwards, he turned to Luo Qing Yun and the others, ordering, “Wait here for now.”

Chen Tian Fei cupped his fists and thanked, “Many thanks, Brother Zhong!” Saying so, he turned around and shouted towards a certain place, “Open the Array!”

A moment later, a crack appeared in the defensive Grand Array as Zhong Fan stepped into the Star City. After he entered, the crack closed again, isolating Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light from the city once again.

The crowd below immediately became restless.

“Manager Zhong actually went to the meeting alone? As expected, skilful Masters are always bold!”

“A Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master isn’t something to joke about. If the Head Manager of Scarlet Star doesn’t make an appearance, who can suppress him?”

“That’s true.”

After Zhong Fan entered, Chen Tian Fei asked Luo Qing Yun and the others to be excused before extending his hand and leading Zhong Fan towards the meeting hall; obviously, he was going to discuss the matter with Zhong Fan.

Inside Yang Kai’s mansion, when Yue He saw this, her eyes darted around before she turned to the two Great Moon Province disciples and Chen Yue, exhorting them, “Pack up your things and prepare to run.”

With Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light’s army bearing down on them, Scarlet Star would not be able to bear such pressure no matter what. Abandoning Yang Kai would be the wisest course of action. Yue He’s quick mind instantly saw through this, so naturally she ordered Chen Yue and the others to make preparations.

“I’ll go call Eldest Senior Brother!” One of Great Moon Province’s disciples hurriedly rushed over to where Meng Hong was cultivating.

“I have nothing to pack,” Chen Yue shook her head.

The Managers of Scarlet Star and Zhong Fan entered the meeting hall. Although many people were curious about what they would be discussing, they had no way of finding it out. Perhaps apart from the Managers, no one would ever know.

After the time it took to drink a cup of tea, Zhong Fan soared into the sky and stood in the air, coldly glancing towards Yang Kai’s mansion. His gaze just happened to meet with Yue He’s eyes.

Yue He smiled sweetly at him with a charming expression.

“Bitch!” Zhong Fan coldly snorted before transforming into a streak of sword light and rushing out. If not for his fear of Yue He, a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he would have already rushed into the mansion and captured Yang Kai.

Although he was also a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm cultivator, he didn’t have any confidence in defeating Yue He. Not to mention, this was the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, where he couldn’t display his full strength. Once someone else helped her, he would definitely be defeated and would be forced to flee.

Therefore, after weighing the pros and cons, he could only temporarily retreat.

The Grand Array opened a crack and allowed Zhong Fan to leave.

“So, what did they choose?” Zhu Li asked.

Zhong Fan indifferently replied, “What else can they do? As I expected, they sacrificed the rook to save the king. Scarlet Star has abandoned that Yang fellow.”

Luo Qing Yun asked, “If that’s the case, why haven’t they deactivated this damned Spirit Array and let us kill that bastard?”

Zhong Fan said, “Naturally, they’re afraid we’ll take advantage of this opportunity to destroy them.” He waved his hand and added, “It’s only natural for them to have such concerns. Since our groups have joined forces, how could Scarlet Star not take precautions?”

Luo Qing Yun frowned deeply, “But if that bastard keeps hiding inside and doesn’t come out, are we just going to wait?”

“Of course not, Chen Tian Fei said he would find a way to force that brat out. All he asked is for us to leave immediately after achieving our goal.”

“Retreat?” Luo Qing Yun sneered, “He’s dreaming! So many people have been mobilized this time, so how can killing just one man appease the hatred in my heart? Since that bastard is a member of Scarlet Star, they should pay the price as well. Also, there is Emperor Heaven and Ding Yi too, since they dare to offend Sword Pavilion’s prestige, they must all die!”

Lu Xue whispered, “How will Scarlet Star force him out? What if he refuses to come out?”

Zhong Fan glanced at her, “He’ll come out, it’s not like we don’t have any bargaining chips.”

Lu Xue suddenly understood and nodded silently.

Sometimes, silence is another kind of pressure. Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light’s 3,000 forces had surrounded the Star City, and although they didn’t make any moves or say a word, it still caused everyone inside to feel uneasy.

In the midst of this turbulence, a piece of news quickly spread throughout the Star City.

Yang Kai’s position as Scarlet Star’s Sixth Manager was not official. He had not received the approval of the Head Manager and instead had used underhanded means to usurp the position. He had killed Du Niang Zi and Gan Hong using a sneak attack, then used despicable means to coerce Chen Tian Fei and the others, and finally took the position of Sixth Manager for himself. The Head Manager, who had been in secluded cultivation, did not know about this matter, nor did he ever acknowledge Yang Kai’s identity as the Sixth Manager. His words and actions simply did not represent Scarlet Star.
