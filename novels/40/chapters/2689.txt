The barrier around room thirteen was still intact, so everyone’s Divine Senses were blocked and no one could see what was going on inside. However, the dialogue inside was still crystal-clear to everyone’s ears.

They heard the Emperor Realm Master in room thirteen decide to fight head-on after failing to beg for mercy. However, he seemed to have been subdued before he could even begin. Then there was a cry, followed by a few strange gulping sounds.

Although they could not see anything, everyone seemed to be able to imagine what happened to that Emperor Realm Master in room thirteen.

*Ou… *

A woman in the hall could not hold back anymore and vomited.

That sound seemed to be a fuse that set everyone else off. Those cultivators who were still struggling to hold themselves back could no longer endure it. They turned around and vomited everywhere. In an instant, the entire hall turned into a mess, while those who didn’t vomit felt more and more like it as they were surrounded by such a disgusting situation.

The Emperor Realm Masters in the other private rooms, on top of being repulsed, also felt bewildered. Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce was considered one of the two top chambers of commerce in the Southern Territory, yet no one had come out to resolve this incident. Realizing this, these Masters started to feel that this auction was not as simple as it appeared to be and that they had unwittingly become involved in a swirling quagmire.

After a long time, Yang Kai strode out of room thirteen and clapped his hands, “It’s really my first time seeing someone make such a weird request. What an eye-opener.”

Dreadful vomiting sounds could be heard from inside the room.

“Carry on!” Yang Kai looked up at Hua Qing Si who was on the stage and said.

Hua Qing Si nodded lightly. She could tell that Yang Kai felt really annoyed this time because of her Honoured Master. He was full of anger and had no place to vent, so now that the Emperor Realm Masters from rooms seven and thirteen had provoked him, how could he spare them?

Fortunately, the Emperor Realm Master in room thirteen was still able to keep his life, but perhaps he would have rather died than go through that punishment.

After looking around, Hua Qing Si asked, “Room one has offered one hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals. Is there anyone who wants to bid a higher price?”

No one responded, for the offer of one hundred million was already exorbitant.

Hua Qing Si nodded, “Since there is no one, the third auction item belongs to room one.”

At her gesture, the maidservant immediately walked towards room one with a tray in her hands. Her little face was pale, and her legs were trembling as if she was walking towards hell, [not room one].

Yang Kai returned to his room and claimed the third Heaven Grade Puppet.

On the stage, Hua Qing Si proceeded, “The fourth auction item, a Thousand Leaves Sect Heaven Grade Puppet… “

“One hundred million!” Yang Kai shouted.

Hua Qing Si beamed as she looked around the hall and asked, “Is there anyone interested in bidding a higher price?”

After asking, she made eye contact with the maidservant who had just come out from backstage, not even needing to give any instructions.

The rest of the auction devolved into a two-man show between Yang Kai and Hua Qing Si. Whenever an auction item was presented, Yang Kai would offer one hundred million without hesitation, and Hua Qing Si would send the maidservant to deliver the item directly to room one.

The expressions of the Emperor Realm Masters in every private room were helpless and ugly. They did not expect to come all this way only to be patronized. Not only could they not win any auction items, but they didn’t even have a chance to bid as Yang Kai would offer one hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals for every item. Who could compete with him at that price? Furthermore, they were now clearly aware that Yang Kai had other intentions here. It seemed that he was here not for the auction at all but rather to cause trouble.

Not to mention that he had just killed the old man in room seven and horribly humiliated the man in room thirteen, his continuous offer of a hundred million alone was somewhat thought-provoking.

He was indeed wealthy, having hundreds of millions of High-Rank Source Crystals without any doubt, but even so, it was unreasonable for him to bid like this as those High-Rank Source Crystals must not have come to him easily. The only explanation was that Yang Kai did not intend to pay at all.

The Emperor Realm Masters here were not idiots, and after observing the situation for some time, they started to sense something. An uneasy feeling gushed out from the depths of their hearts, like invisible chains wrapping around them, making them feel incredibly uncomfortable.

But it was strange to them that the auctioneer on stage still continued to cooperate with Yang Kai.

After only a quarter of an hour, the nine Heaven Grade Puppets of Thousand Leaves Sect were auctioned off. As expected, all of them fell into Yang Kai’s hands and were then returned over to Ye Hen.

Ye Hen was so excited that he could barely contain himself. He could not believe that he could recover all the Heaven Grade Puppets so easily. He thought that he had lost the inheritance of his Sect forever together with Thousand Leave Sect itself. All this time, he had been feeling guilty towards his ancestors and was so heartbroken he could not pull himself together even after Li Qing Yun released him unscathed.

But now, with the nine Heaven Grade Puppets back in his hands, Ye Hen’s fighting spirit was rekindled.

Since the Thousand Leaves Sect was destroyed under his watch, it had to be rebuilt by his hands to reclaim the glory of his ancestors. The five hundred disciples he sent into Emperor Heaven Valley, together with the Sect’s Techniques and ancient books, were his biggest hope, but these nine Heaven Grade Puppets were the capital he needed.

In an instant, Ye Hen regained his spirits, as if turning over a new leaf in spring after a dark winter.

Ye Jing Han and Du Xian were equally exhilarated as they witnessed the retrieval of the puppets, and they felt even more grateful to Yang Kai. After all, these Heaven Grade Puppets were outstanding treasures with strength comparable to Emperor Realm Masters. If it was someone else, they would probably have kept them for themselves, but Yang Kai gave all of them to Ye Hen. There was no way for them to not feel immense gratitude towards Yang Kai’s noble act.

“Young Master Yang, they seem to be stalling for time,” Ying Fei suddenly stated.

Yang Kai nodded, “I know.”

He had presented himself in a high profile manner and snatched every auction item, but Wu Ming did not try to stop him and simply remained quiet. What else could this be but a stalling tactic?

It seemed the masterminds here would rather give up the nine Heaven Grade Puppets in order to buy more time. It could be seen that there were a lot of preparations taking place behind the scenes.

“Do you want to request Lady Hua to speed up the auction?” Ying Fei frowned.

Yang Kai shook his head, “Sister Hua is implanted with a Heart-Strangling Insect. She cannot help even if she wants to.”

“Heart-Strangling Insect!” Ying Fei’s face changed, obviously familiar with this particular Exotic Ancient Insect.

“Since we’re already here, we should sit back and see what they plan to do.” Yang Kai took a sip of tea.

On the stage, Hua Qing Si suddenly frowned and glanced backstage. After a moment of hesitation, she announced, “This is the end of the first half of the auction. Please take a moment to relax and prepare yourselves as there are even more auction items coming next. None of you will be disappointed.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai could not help narrowing his eyes.

The Emperor Realm Masters in the private rooms also curled their lips. This auction would certainly have been exciting if not for Yang Kai’s presence, but with this bastard sitting here, this auction was like a pot of delicious porridge contaminated by a piece of rat dropping.

Yang Kai was a living calamity in this auction. No one had the chance to participate because of him.

All nine of the Heaven Grade Puppets from Thousand Leaves Sect had fallen into his hands, and even if there were more and better items to be auctioned, perhaps they would not be able to obtain any of them either. Once Yang Kai opened his mouth to shout the bid, the auction item was bound to enter his pocket again.

Thinking of this, many people were discouraged, as they accepted the fact that they had no fate with the following auction items. Some even got up from their private rooms and wanted to leave the auction house.

Shortly, half of the people in the more than thirty private rooms prepared to set off, while the other half remained there just to watch the show without any expectations to get any of the following auction items.

When those who wanted to leave reached the doors of the auction house though, they found that this place had been sealed. They were hindered by what seemed to be a solid Spirit Array enveloping this branch of Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce.

“What happened? Why won’t they let us go?”

“How dare Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce do this! Are they planning to capture all of us in one net?”

“I already felt something was wrong with this auction earlier, now it seems like there is indeed a conspiracy afoot.”

“Don’t panic, everyone, if we work together then this trivial Spirit Array won’t be any trouble to break.”

There were a dozen First-Order and Second-Order Emperor Realm Masters at the doors, so if they joined forces, the power they could display would be quite substantial. After a simple discussion, they started to jointly attack the Spirit Array.

After a stick worth of incense though, the dozen Emperor Realm Masters were forced to give up. All of them stared at the barrier which did not even flicker under their bombardment and their hearts sank.

No one expected the Spirit Array here to be so strong that it could resist the combined forces of a dozen Emperor Realm Masters for so long.

“Brother Gong, your Heavenly River Valley Gong Family are Grandmasters in the Dao of Spirit Arrays, yes? Do you know what this Spirit Array is?” A man suddenly turned to an elderly man who was wearing black. This elderly man looked like a commoner among the crowd, but he was actually the Patriarch of the Gong Family.

The Gong Family from Heavenly River Valley had a resounding reputation throughout the Southern Territory because the people of this family were all proficient in Spirit Arrays. The Sect Defending Arrays of many Sects were arranged by this family.

Gong Wen Shan, whom Yang Kai met in the Four Seasons Realm back then, was a member of the Gong Family. Despite Gong Wen Shan being just a Dao Source Realm cultivator, his achievements in the Dao of Spirit Arrays had reached an astonishing height, so nothing more needed to be said about the current Patriarch of the Gong Family.

In terms of attainments in Spirit Arrays, this Gong Family Patriarch should be on par with Nanmen Da Jun from the Northern Territory.

“What? Your Excellency is actually Patriarch Gong? Please forgive my rudeness!” Someone exclaimed and quickly saluted with his fist cupped. It was obvious that he had heard a lot about the elderly man surnamed Gong, but this was his first time meeting him.

Most of the people were like this too and immediately greeted the elderly man surnamed Gong.

Now that they recalled, when they were attacking the array together previously, Patriarch Gong did not use much of his strength. It turned out that he was not idling, but instead observing.

Patriarch Gong frowned slightly and remarked after pondering for a while, “If this Old Master is not mistaken, this is the Five Elements Grand Sealing Array.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“What’s particular about this array?” Someone asked from the side.

Patriarch Gong answered, “The Five Elements Grand Sealing Array gathers and condenses Five Element World Energy, creating a cycle of mutual reinforcement and neutralization. It’s not something that can be broken by brute force. Once it is activated, it is even capable of isolating the space within it from the outside world.”

“Sealing space!” A cry of shock came out.

“This is an extremely profound Spirit Array,” Patriarch Gong’s face turned solemn, “And…”

“And what?”
