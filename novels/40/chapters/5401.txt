“This Old Master and my friends came with hostile intentions, but Mo did not realize it at all. Instead, it welcomed us and showed us the beauty of its territory and its achievements with great delight…”

Looking back, Mo truly behaved like a child. It had something that it was proud of but there was no one to share it with. It was a rare occasion that others could be its guest; thus, it happily tried to show off to Cang and the nine other Martial Ancestors.

The reason why Mo liked Cang and his friends was because they could resist its Black Ink Strength, unlike the others who became subservient to it and obeyed its orders after being corrupted.

For Mo, what it needed was not a servant, but a friend, whom it could share joy and happiness with.

“Initially, Mo considered us friends with completely pure intentions. It was so friendly and honest that we did not know what to do when we were faced with it. We originally thought of killing it, but when it came time to act, not one of us could bring ourselves to be ruthless against a child. Black Ink Strength was simply the power it was born with. It did not have the intention of wreaking havoc on the 3,000 Worlds, it just did not understand what harm it could do to the Human Race, and that its existence would lead to the destruction of everything.”

“In addition to our own feelings, Mo was indestructible, so there was essentially nothing that we could do to destroy it. So, our plans gradually changed. We explored its birthplace and decided to lure it here. Once it was here, we would use our strength and seal it here. We wanted to slowly find a way to understand its power, not only to see if we could find a way to preserve its life, but also to neutralize its Black Ink Strength.”

“Before we did that, we worked together to split apart the Great Territories occupied by Mo so that its Black Ink Strength would not poison the others that remained uncontaminated. At that time, many Masters gathered under Mo’s command, so when we imprisoned Mo here, it was furious and ordered its servants to attack the Human Race. That was how the war began, and the vast void behind you is where the two sides fought.”

“Initially, we could still perceive the movement of the battle, but as time passed, the battlefield gradually expanded outward, and we lost track of how the war was progressing.”

The war suddenly broke out after Cang and the other nine imprisoned Mo. The Human Race wanted to stop the encroachment of Black Ink Strength and protect their home; however, Mo was angry with Cang and the others’ betrayal and ordered its slaves to slaughter all living beings.

Thus, the Black Ink Battlefield was born in this new era. It was an era where the Human Race had experienced many new dangers, dangers that persisted to today. At that time, there was a tragic great war where the Black Ink Clan and the Human Race fought to the death across the vast Black Ink Battlefield. For both sides, retreat was not an option.

“That great war lasted for around 10,000 years. Many Human Masters were killed and injured. Naturally, the forces under Mo were ruthlessly killed as well. Just when we thought that Black Ink Strength’s hidden problems were basically pacified, Mo’s power suddenly erupted out from the restriction. It had been accumulating power for those 10,000 years, and the 10 of us were caught off guard and nearly overwhelmed by it. Although it took a lot of effort for us to reseal it, some of the servants it created escaped from this place… If I’m not mistaken, you call those servants Royal Lords.”

Yang Kai nodded as the pieces seemed to come into place.

When Yang Kai questioned the Territory Lord who was trapped in Void Crack, Ge Chen, he said that the Royal Lords came out of the Source Domain and brought with them their Black Ink Nests.

Now, it seemed that those Royal Lords were the same ones that escaped at that time.

Yang Kai was horrified.

What kind of power did Mo have to directly create so many Royal Lords?

Then, what kind of powers did Cang and the other nine Martial Ancestors possess to be able to imprison Mo?

Cang said that he was only in the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm, but how could he merely be in the Ninth-Order? Was it really as simple as him being further along the Martial Dao than the current generation’s Ninth-Order Masters?

“Thus, we were very worried when we saw those Royal Lords escape. If those Royal Lords managed to conquer the 3,000 Worlds and take over everything, it would be enough for them to create an endless number of Black Ink Clansmen. With such numbers, it would not be difficult for them to amass 500 Royal Lords in time.”

Cang managed to give the Old Ancestors magnificent descriptions of what happened during the Primordial Era, the Early Ancient Era, and the Late Ancient Era. He also revealed a lot of unheard-of secrets to the Old Ancestors and explained to them the origins of Mo.

At the end of the Late Ancient Era, the battle between the Black ink Clan and the Human Race was so fierce that even the Supreme Masters of the Human Race were killed. With a lack of records or distortions as generations passed, it created a gap in the Human Race’s knowledge of the World’s history, which was why even the Cave Heavens and Paradises ended up not knowing much about these ancient events.

If the Human Army had not arrived here today, they still would not understand the origins of their history.

Although they were unclear, the tradition of fighting against the Black Ink Clan had continued because the Human Race needed to survive. They had to prevent the Black Ink Clan from ever getting to the 3,000 Worlds, or it would be the end of the Human Race.

More than 100 Theatres in more than 100 Great Passes continued to resist in the Black Ink Battlefield. Countless years and generations of Humans gave their lives to ensure this steadfast protection.

The battles were grand and glorious. The Humans and the Black Ink Clan had a long history of fighting since the end of the Late Ancient Era, which continued on to this day.

The reason why the Black Ink Clan invaded was because they needed to use the resources to breed more Royal Lords so that they could return to this place to free Mo.

The Old Ancestors were silent after Cang finished speaking.

What they heard today was beyond their imagination, and they needed some time to process all the new and alarming information.

After a long time, an Old Ancestor asked, “Senior, our Crusade Force has arrived. What can be done to completely destroy Mo? We have around 2 million soldiers pledged to fight to the death. Is this enough to clear all the evil that lies within?”

Cang slowly shook his head and replied grimly, “Mo was born with the Universe itself, its existence is special. The 10 of us could only seal and weaken it, but we could never completely destroy it.”

The Old Ancestors listened with trepidation. [It could not be completely destroyed?]

If there was no way to completely destroy it, then was this not a true immortal and indestructible existence?

The Great Battle Cave Heaven Old Ancestor quickly noticed something, however and asked, “The 10 of us could only…? Did you mean that there is a way? Senior, please enlighten us. Since we came here, we will not just turn around empty-handed.”

Cang pondered a little and said, “There is a way, but this Old Master cannot guarantee whether it will work or not. This solution was discussed by all my old friends when they were still alive, but this idea had never been proven.”

The Ninth-Order Masters listened carefully.

“Previously, this Old Master said that when the World first began, the Primordial Light came into existence together with darkness, which later became Mo. Therefore, we believe that the Primordial Light and the darkness are in a symbiotic relationship. If we want to completely eliminate the darkness, perhaps we need to find the Primordial Light in this World. Perhaps, with the power of the Primordial Light, we can eliminate Black Ink Strength once and for all.”

“The Primordial Light…”

The Ninth-Order Masters’ jaws dropped, while Yang Kai was dumbfounded.

How were they supposed to find that?

When the World was created, light was born. How could they know how to find the first light in existence? How do they find the Primordial Light that existed since the dawn of time?

It was totally unimaginable.

When he said this, all the Ninth-Order Masters suddenly turned their heads towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he suddenly remembered the two Supreme Beings he was acquainted with.

Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan!

If there was any power in this Universe that could truly restrain Black Ink Strength, it was the Purifying Light, which Yang Kai could produce by using the two marks granted to him by those two and fusing the Sun’s Burning Light and the Moon’s Serene Glimmer’s power which was contained in the Yellow and Blue Crystals.

[Were Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan once the Primordial Light?] Yang Kai was also a bit confused. [If they are the Primordial Light, how did they become two beings? Could it be that the two could fuse into one? That doesn’t sound right either. These two represented the extremes of Yin and Yang, and they have been fighting each other for countless years in the Chaotic Dead Territory. How could they ever fuse together as one?]

Whether or not it was Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan, these two were avatars of destruction whose mere presence annihilated the world around them, so how could they possibly be brought here?

Seeing the reactions of the Old Ancestors, Cang asked, “Does this little friend know something about the Primordial Light?”

Yang Kai replied, “I’m not sure if those two are the incarnations of the Primordial Light, but Senior, I had received some power from them…”

After saying that, he activated the two marks, drawing power from the Yellow and Blue Crystals to merge into Purifying Light.

As the white light blossomed, Cang’s eyes glowed brightly as he concentrated on perceiving the light for a moment, only to shake his head and say, “This light is not pure enough, and far from matching the Primordial Darkness. However, it should have some relationship with the Primordial Light. Where did you get this power, little friend?”

Yang Kai told him about the Chaotic Dead Territory.

Cang softly murmured, “Burning Light, Serene Glimmer… So, it’s them!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He obviously knew about these two as well.

The Burning Light and Serene Glimmer had existed for a very long time and were known as the two legendary ancestors of all Divine Spirits. It was because of them that there were Divine Spirits.

The Divine Spirits existed during the Primordial Era, so these two Supreme Beings must have existed even earlier than the Divine Spirits.

Since Cang was from the Late Ancient Era, how could he not have heard about them?
