Yang Kai’s face had gone blue and he was constantly forming seals with his hands, pushing his Source Qi madly. After struggling for a while, the wisp of black Qi was finally halted.

But from the looks of it, half of his right arm had been terribly corroded. It was bloody all over and the blocked black Qi was still thrashing about like a living creature, desperately trying to push towards Yang Kai’s shoulder.

Yang Kai fiercely raised his head and shouted in a grim voice, glaring at Yin Le Sheng, “You dare plot against me!”

At this moment, Yin Le Sheng too was dumbstruck. That Asura Earth Demon was one of Netherworld Sect’s Forbidden Secret Techniques. In each generation, only the top disciple could cultivate it. Furthermore, one needed to connect to the real Netherworld Purgatory to cultivate it by refining an Earth Demon with Netherworld Yin Qi. Once one had cultivated it successfully, the might of this Secret Technique was astonishing, and basically, anyone below the Emperor Realm would be completely powerless to resist it.

Yin Le Sheng had secretly hidden this wisp of Asura Earth Demon in his Space Ring, and when Yang Kai took it, he suddenly activated this Secret Technique. As he had expected, Yang Kai was afflicted.

But what shocked Yin Le Sheng was that Yang Kai actually blocked the progress of the Asura Earth Demon. Although he was injured, he hadn’t suffered serious damage and there was no danger to his life.

After a momentary shock, Yin Le Sheng immediately regained his wits and his figure flickered as he pounced towards Yang Kai like a hawk spreading its wings. A fierce and hideous look appeared on his face as he shouted, “This Yin always takes his revenge as quickly as possible! Ten years is too late for me! Yang Kai, go to Hell!”

And the same time Yin Le Sheng made his move, Zhang Hao and Zhang Xian also attacked together as their Source Qi surged. Who knows what kind of Secret Technique they used, but their figures merged into one as they flew towards Yang Kai with astonishing momentum, leaving a single long trail.

Others also reacted quickly. One after another, they let out war cries as they rushed at Yang Kai.

Having been forced to surrender their Space Rings, they were already burning with fury, so seeing Yang Kai get seriously injured after being sneak-attacked by Yin Le Sheng, they naturally seized this opportunity to take their revenge.

“Yang Kai, run!” Lan He was startled, and seeing the situation change so quickly, she hurriedly urged Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s face grimaced, who knows whether it was from pain or anger, but in a flash, a crazed look appeared on his face as he stated in a firm voice, “We can’t escape.”

He couldn’t find the exit to this Natural Spirit Array, and unless he had time to study it in peace, he wouldn’t be able to get out of here anytime soon. As such, he promptly raised the Myriads Swords and swung it hard towards the Mountains and Rivers Bell, fiercely shouting, “You want my life!? You can all die first!”

*Hong…*

As the Myriads Sword struck the Mountains and Rivers Bell, a halo suddenly appeared around it before a terrifying sound wave swept outwards, causing everyone’s eyes to widen as they started screaming.

But to everyone’s surprise, the sound wave didn’t travel far, instead just sending the nearby Yang Kai flying.

“Hahaha, if disasters come from nature, something can be done to counter them, but if they are of one’s own making, one is done for!” Zhang Hao was overjoyed by this. Although he didn’t know why the Mountains and Rivers Bell reacted differently this time, in his opinion, right now was the best chance to kill Yang Kai. He roared at the top of his voice, “Everyone, let’s attack together! Let’s make this surnamed Yang die without a burial!”

The rest of the people also had their spirits lifted and they immediately charged ahead, one after another.

Yang Kai was dazed. Having taken the full brunt of the shockwave, he couldn’t tell north from south. The Mountains and Rivers Bell’s deviation had caught him by surprise too and he couldn’t understand what the Artifact Spirit’s intentions were.

At this juncture of life or death though, the Mountains and Rivers Bell suddenly shook on its own, causing a spatial collapse along with it.

This Natural Spirit Array collapsed and disappeared in an instant. The next moment, a black hole of the size of a house appeared out of thin air. The Mountains and Rivers Bell turned into a streak of light as it was sucked into the black hole, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

The next moment, the black hole expanded at an extremely fast speed. At the same time, a tremendously powerful suction came from the black hole, pulling in all the nearby cultivators.

“What happened!?”

“What’s going on!?”

“Damn it, quickly get out of here, the space here is collapsing!”

“Surnamed Yang, you’re not human!”

Everyone started yelling and screaming one after another. Everyone was panicking and even Yin Le Sheng, who was relentless about Yang Kai’s death, had a change in his expression. How could he still care about Yang Kai’s life or death in this situation? He promptly turned around and tried to escape.

But the black hole’s suction was irresistible. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t make any forward progress, much less escape.

With the rapid expansion of the black hole, its pull grew stronger and stronger, making every cultivator feel desperate and powerless.

Yang Kai and Lan He, who were closest to the black hole, were sucked in first and disappeared

After a while, screaming and panicking cultivators were swallowed into the black hole, one after another.

In less than ten breaths, each and every cultivator was pulled into the black hole; no one could escape it.

And the black hole was still expanding.

Until a certain moment, after the black hole expanded to a certain limit, it suddenly shrank back down and disappeared in a flash.

The void had regained its peace, but strong Space Principle fluctuations remained behind, the only signs that an abnormal event had taken place here before.

…..

A dizzy Yang Kai woke up sometime later and immediately heard Lan He’s distressed cries.

The pain coming from his arm was still unbearable and seemed to pierce straight through to his Soul, making Yang Kai feel like it was being torn apart.

He had vaguely sensed the things going on before, but because he had borne the brunt of the Mountains and Rivers Bell’s sound wave, his consciousness had become blurry, so he hadn’t been able to investigate his surroundings.

He only saw the formation of a black hole and felt its powerful pull dragging him in. The next thing he knew, he was here.

If he hadn’t had a precious treasure like the Soul Warming Lotus, the shockwave alone from before would have been enough to extinguish his Soul.

As the shouts in his ears became clearer and clearer, Yang Kai shook his head and finally regained some lucidity. He turned his head to look, but he couldn’t see anything at all. There was no light here, just some chaotic nothingness, a familiar feeling to him.

“The Void Crack!” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he cried out in surprise.

Obviously, this was the interlayer of the void crack.

The Void existed everywhere in the world, but if one didn’t understand the Dao of Space, he or she couldn’t detect its existence at all. It was also impossible for one to enter this place except in very special circumstances. Recalling the previous scene, Yang Kai immediately understood the reason why he was here in the Void. It was completely because of the sudden eruption of the Mountains and Rivers Bell that shattered space with tremendous force.

The black hole was the most obvious sign.

Forcing his aching body up, Yang Kai quickly spread his Divine Sense. As expected, he found Lan He not far away from him.

At this moment, Lan He’s situation was precarious, because she was caught in a Void Turbulence and was being sucked into it.

The Void was riddled with crises, but the biggest was undoubtedly Void Turbulences which were like invisible rivers. These were chaotic confluences of chaotic Space Principles, and once anyone fell into one, it was very difficult to escape. The only end for someone who experienced such misfortune was being swallowed by this undercurrent.

Even Yang Kai had to be careful of these undercurrents while walking through The Void.

Although Lan He’s cultivation was good, she had no understanding of the Dao of Space, so after falling into a Void Turbulence, she was completely helpless and was only waiting for her death.

Yang Kai quickly came over to her and called out, “Sister Lan He!”

Lan He was slightly startled, and then responded in a low voice, “Yang Kai?”

“Yes, it’s me.”

Lan He shouted, “I’m entangled by some kind of strange force. I can’t get away. Don’t come closer.”

She was afraid that Yang Kai would follow in her footsteps, so she quickly reminded her.

Yang Kai grinned and stated, “Don’t worry, this is a Void Turbulence, I’ll save you now.”

Lan He refused, shaking her head, “No, I tried just now to escape. The harder one struggles, the faster they are pulled under, just like in a swamp. If you try to help me, it will be counterproductive. If you have a chance to leave this place, please go to Eastern Territory’s Heavenly Wolf Valley, and give them a message, tell them that I, Lan He died here.”

She felt that she had no hope of surviving, so she began making arrangements for her funeral.

Yang Kai remained silent, got down on one knee and calmly started probing by her side.

After a moment of silence, seeing Yang Kai not give her a reply, Lan He said in a dejected voice, “By the way, take my Space Ring and hand it to one of my Heavenly Wolf Valley disciples.”

While speaking, she took off her Space Ring.

Yang Kai suddenly stretched his hand out and patted the location where she was. Immediately, Space Principle fluctuations undulated, turning into an invisible force that affected the movement of the Void Turbulence.

After a short while, the surging Void Turbulence became calm, and Yang Kai then reached out his hand and fished Lan He out.

“This… How…” Lan He didn’t seem to believe that she was able to get out so easily. She couldn’t help but remain rooted to her spot, but soon, she reacted and couldn’t help but cry out, “You wouldn’t happen to cultivate the Dao of Space, do you?”

Yang Kai meaningfully grinned and modestly stated, “I understand a little bit.”

Shocked, Lan He asked, “Are you Sir Li Wu Yi’s disciple?”

[It’s that Li Wu Yi again…] Yang Kai had heard this name more than once and had long known that he was a famous Master in the Star Boundary with a powerful Third-Order Emperor Realm cultivation. Moreover, Li Wu Yi was apparently proficient in the Dao of Space.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that this person was the first Master under the Ten Great Emperors.

Yang Kai denied, shaking his head, “I have heard of him a long time ago, but I have never met him.”

He wasn’t going to continue discussing this topic and immediately proposed, “I’ll take you to a safer place first. I also have to heal myself.”

After Lan He heard this, she recalled the scene of him being sneak-attacked by Yin Le Sheng and quickly stated, “The Asura Earth Demon is a Forbidden Secret Technique of the Netherworld Sect. Its corrosiveness is extremely strong. If anyone below the Emperor Realm is hit by it, they are guaranteed to die. How can you be alright?”

Yang Kai chuckled and stated, “I’m lucky, or Yin Le Sheng, that bastard, isn’t that proficient in that technique.”

The Asura Earth Demon was indeed terrifying, and Yang Kai reckoned that if he were any other Dao Source Realm cultivator, he would really be unable to solve this problem. But Yang Kai’s strength was incomparable to an ordinary Dao Source Realm cultivators’; Regardless of whether it was his physique, Source Qi, or his Spiritual Energy, everything was far beyond what an average Dao Source Realm cultivator should possess, so Yang Kai was somehow able to suppress the Asura Earth Demon.

Even so, half of his arm was corroded beyond recognition.
