As they spoke, they could sense Dragon Pressure wafting from the other side of the island. Just like what Zhu Lie had said, Fu Chi was indeed coming over.

Noticing the familiar aura, Madam Hua grew more confident as she stared viciously at Yang Kai.

“Move!” Zhu Lie growled all of a sudden and pushed out a palm at Yang Kai.

Seeing that, Yang Kai stomped his foot and leaped off to the other side.

Right then, Madam Hua, who was still coming up with ideas on how to torture Yang Kai, Lu San Niang and her daughter, spat blood suddenly. All her bones had been cracked as she was engulfed in excruciating pain. With her vitality leaving her body rapidly, she turned her head with difficulty and looked at Zhu Lie in disbelief, “Sir, you…”

As her head slumped to the side, all her aura dissipated. Her eyes were still wide open while she was dead. In her last moments, she still couldn’t understand why Zhu Lie decided to kill her.

Apparently, Lu San Niang didn’t grasp what was going on either. Seeing that Zhu Lie had killed Madam Hua, she raised her hands to rub her eyes, thinking that she was mistaken. [I don’t think he accidentally killed her. He’s an Eighth-Order Dragon, so it’s not possible that he’d kill the wrong target.]

Just when she was doubtful, Zhu Lie pushed out both his palms, upon which the two women who had come to this place with Madam Hua, grunted and lost their lives. Blood was streaming out from all their seven orifices.

At that instant, the colour drained from Lu San Niang’s beautiful face. By now, she was certain that it wasn’t an accident. Zhu Lie intentionally killed all three of Fu Chi’s women. [What’s going on? Wasn’t he supposed to kill Yang Kai? Why did he spare Yang Kai but murder Madam Hua and the other women?]

Lu San Niang was stumped as the incident was beyond her. Just then, Zhu Lie turned his head and stared at Lu San Niang and her daughter. With his gaze filled with murderous intent, he raised his hand and was ready to make a strike.

With her face turning a shade paler, Lu San Niang’s chest tightened. Suddenly, a figure appeared before her eyes. Yang Kai was standing in front of her as he said gently, “You can’t kill them.”

Zhu Lie replied, “Better safe than sorry.”

At that, Yang Kai shook his head, after which Zhu Lie said angrily, “Whatever. If the truth is exposed, it’s you who will be troubled.”

Upon finishing his words, he shifted his attention to Yuan Wu, who had remained lying on the ground after he was attacked by Yang Kai. At that moment, his body was trembling uncontrollably.

After all, he was a Dragonborn who was in the Second-Order Emperor Realm. Yang Kai didn’t exert much force with his palm earlier, so it wasn’t possible that Yuan Wu would really pass out from the impact. In fact, he was just pretending to have lost consciousness. As he watched the following incidents, he felt his heart pounding terribly against his chest.

The sight of Zhu Lie murdering Madam Hua and the other two women was extremely shocking for him. By now, he realized that Zhu Lie had sided with Yang Kai. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have helped Yang Kai silence all the witnesses before Fu Chi arrived. Hence, Yuan Wu knew he was also one of his targets.

The moment Yuan Wu saw Zhu Lie staring at him, he knew that he was in trouble. After hesitating between begging for mercy and running for his life, he decided to flee. As he ran in the direction Fu Chi was coming, he shouted, “Sir, help me!”

Although he didn’t understand why Zhu Lie wanted to kill all of them, he knew that Zhu Lie wouldn’t let him off. Therefore, it would be pointless for him to beg for his mercy. If he wanted to survive, he could only rely on Fu Chi. Even though the chance was slim, it was better than having no hope at all.

After staring coldly at his figure for a while, Zhu Lie lifted his hand and condensed a ferocious Fire Dragon from his flames.

Feeling the heat, Yuan Wu panicked, and when he turned his head and saw the Fire Dragon, he felt as though his soul had left him as he shouted desperately, “No!”

In the blink of an eye, he was engulfed in the Fire Dragon, which was summoned by a Pureblood Dragon, so it wasn’t possible for Yuan Wu to parry or escape. As his body was on fire, he screamed and collapsed to the ground, upon which he rolled around and struggled.

After just a short moment though, Yuan Wu stopped moving. His body was completely charred, looking just like a big piece of charcoal.

Finally, Fu Chi arrived at the scene. He looked like a man in his thirties with a sturdy physique. Despite not saying anything, he gave off a stern vibe. Crackling sounds could be heard as he was surrounded by arcs of lightning.

With a dark gaze, Fu Chi shot a look at Zhu Lie, apparently not welcoming him. It seemed that there were some grudges between them. Then, he took a brief glance at Yang Kai and looked away, as he didn’t have any regard for a Human. However, he frowned when he saw Lu San Niang.

Certainly, he still remembered Lu San Niang. It was he who kidnapped Lu San Niang from the Northern Territory and brought her to Dragon Island. He was also the one who banished her out of the island. The latter incident happened barely more than ten years ago, so he still remembered it.

On the other hand, Lu San Niang didn’t have the courage to look at him. Her face as pale as a white sheet, she stood in front of Lu Yu Qin as her tender body trembled uncontrollably. Fortunately, Fu Chi didn’t seem to care about her as he had only shot her a brief glance.

The next moment, Fu Chi was infuriated and said through gritted teeth, “Zhu Lie, what have you done!?”

At that moment, he saw the corpse of his favourite woman lying on the beach. Her eyes were still wide open, and her mouth was caked in blood. Her corpse was still surrounded by some faint Dragon Essence, so it was apparent that she was killed by a member of the Dragon Clan.

Now, there was only one Dragon Clan member here, which was Zhu Lie. Fu Chi didn’t need to ask any questions to know that it was Zhu Lie who killed her, and that fact alone enraged him. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

This island was his territory, so naturally, he couldn’t tolerate the fact that his toys were killed by Zhu Lie.

While Fu Chi was fuming, Zhu Lie uttered dispassionately, “I just helped you kill a woman who thought too highly of herself.”

With a livid expression, Fu Chi questioned, “What do you mean?”

He wasn’t aware of what had happened. Although this place wasn’t far from his residence, he didn’t have the time to keep watch on this area all the time. He only came all the way here because he could sense Zhu Lie’s aura, but he didn’t expect to see this sight when he arrived.

“What do you think I’m talking about? She’s just an insignificant person, but she had the gall to offend me.” Zhu Lie snorted.

“She offended you?” Fu Chi was both surprised and doubtful. Madam Hua had been living on Dragon Island for centuries, so it wasn’t possible that she would recklessly offend a member of the Dragon Clan. Furthermore, as far as he knew, Madam Hua had met Zhu Lie before and thus knew his identity.

There were only a small number of Dragon Clan members, and those with extremely pure bloodlines were even rarer. Since Madam Hua had met Zhu Lie before, Fu Chi didn’t think she would rashly offend him for it would be akin to courting death.

[What’s going on?]

“What’s wrong? Are you sad to see her dead?” Zhu Lie put on a sneer.

Fu Chi stared fixedly at him and gave it a thought before replying, “They were just my playthings, so I don’t care if they’re dead. Why would I be sad about it?”

Indeed, these women were not important to him, and Madam Hua’s death didn’t really matter. What he cared about was his own dignity. Zhu Lie had just killed his people on his own island, which was a challenge to his authority. However, his situation was a bit sensitive right now, so he wouldn’t want to argue with Zhu Lie, lest the matter escalate into a conflict. After coming up with an excuse, he uttered, “Since she offended you, her death isn’t worth pitying.”

“I’m glad you understand.” Zhu Lie snorted.

Then, Fu Chi questioned coldly, “Why are you here today?”

Zhu Lie replied, “I’m here to check on the construction of the palace.”

“That’s it?” Fu Chi frowned.

His expression turning dark, Zhu Lie said sternly, “This is an important matter.”

Fu Chi nodded, “Indeed, it’s an important matter. Since you’re here, we should have a look together. I’m not sure how much has been completed either. I just took a brief glance, but the progress seemed satisfactory. Those lowly people are indeed somewhat capable.”

With a cold expression, Zhu Lie flew off in the palace’s direction. In the blink of an eye, he was nowhere in sight.

Fu Chi’s expression turned grim for Zhu Lie had been impolite to him on this day. He was displeased at the fact that even though he had extended an olive branch to Zhu Lie, the latter still appeared arrogant.

They were on par in terms of power and bloodline, so Fu Chi couldn’t really flare up. Moreover, in just one month, he wouldn’t have to be wary of him anymore. By then, he would be able to get his revenge. With this thought in mind, he turned around and disappeared as well.

Now, only the corpses, Yang Kai and the mother and daughter pair remained. Just now, Fu Chi hadn’t paid any attention to Lu San Niang, nor did he care about Lu Yu Qin’s presence. To him, these two were air, not even worthy of his attention.

Lu San Niang became dejected realizing this, not for herself, but for her daughter. Lu Yu Qin was still Fu Chi’s daughter, but Fu Chi was utterly stone-hearted towards her, which caused Lu San Niang to be crestfallen. Fortunately, Lu Yu Qin didn’t understand the intricacies of the situation.

Nevertheless, Lu San Niang’s focus was on another matter. Still reeling from the shock, she gazed at Yang Kai and said gently, “Little Brother Yang, he…”

Yang Kai replied impassively, “Don’t tell anyone what has happened today.”

With a solemn expression, Lu San Niang nodded repeatedly, “I understand. My daughter and I swear we won’t tell another soul about this matter. Please rest assured.”

Yang Kai nodded and looked in the palace’s direction. If it weren’t for Zhu Lie’s timely arrival, this issue wouldn’t have been settled so easily, especially after Fu Chi arrived.

Apparently, Zhu Lie was aware of this as well, which was why he turned ruthless suddenly by killing Madam Hua and the other two women as well as Yuan Wu, who had been pretending to have passed out. If Yang Kai didn’t stop him, Zhu Lie undoubtedly would have killed Lu San Niang and her daughter as well.

However, Yang Kai wasn’t so worried. If things really got out of control, he would have just fought it out with Fu Chi; after all, he didn’t put an Eighth-Order Thunder Dragon in his eyes. Yang Kai was confident he could defeat him, so he had nothing to fear.

With that said, he was satisfied with the outcome. The only thing he didn’t understand was that Fu Chi seemed to be wary of Zhu Lie.

They were both Eighth-Order Dragons, so they shouldn’t be afraid of each other. Nevertheless, Fu Chi’s attitude on this day was puzzling. Since Yang Kai couldn’t figure out what was happening though, he decided to stop thinking about it. Now, he only cared about Zhu Qing’s whereabouts.

Since he had come across Zhu Lie, Yang Kai reckoned he should seize the chance and ask him about Zhu Qing’s whereabouts. Nevertheless, Zhu Lie was with Fu Chi now, so it was inconvenient for Yang Kai to look for him. Left with no choice, Yang Kai could only wait.

He believed that Zhu Lie must have realized his intention for coming to Dragon Island, and since Zhu Lie was willing to help hide Yang Kai’s identity, he must have his own considerations.

Moments later, a beam of red light shot up from the palace and headed in a particular direction. The red light flashed past Yang Kai’s head and disappeared over the sea, as though it was done intentionally.

Standing on the beach, Fu Chi stared fixedly at Zhu Lie’s leaving figure. After a sneer, he turned around and left.

Silavin: It seems that even if the Dragons have enmity against each other, they do not wish to ever see their other clan members die.
