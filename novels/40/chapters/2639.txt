Half a day later, the other four hundred cultivators under Yang Kai’s command rushed over. They even caused the ground to rumble as they did so.

Yang Kai came out of the cabin to take a look; then, after a few words, he returned into his cabin, ignoring them.

Yang Kai could not help ruminating as he entered the cabin.

The main purpose of him infiltrating here using Xiao Bai Yi’s identity was to find Nanmen Da Jun. Once found, Yang Kai would kill him or capture him depending on the circumstances. However, he did not expect that he would be assigned a task to guard an array flag; tying him down to a single spot.

Since he was appointed to guard the array flag, he could not simply run around. Furthermore, he had no clue where Nanmen Da Jun was at the moment.

This caused Yang Kai to be anxious.

Looking at the progress of the Seeking Passion Sect, the array flags and the array bases were all but fully arranged. It would not take long for them to break the Sect Defending Array of Ice Heart Valley. If he continued to delay his mission, he was afraid that it would be too late to save Ice Heart Valley’.

Considering all this, a resolute look flashed upon Yang Kai’s face and he pushed the door open and went out again.

The five hundred cultivators scattered around the array flag, sitting cross-legged, all noticed Yang Kai appear and stood up to await his command.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai did not even look at them. Instead, he just turned around and flew off.

“Young Master Xiao…” Huo Han shouted with his fist cupped.

“What?” Yang Kai frowned, looking rather displeased.

“May I know where Young Master Xiao is going?” Huo Han queried in a deep voice.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, “You don’t need to worry about where this Young Master is going.”

Huo Han’s face burned furiously. In a neither humble nor arrogant tone, he pressed on, “That’s not true, Young Master Xiao. Since Elder Feng had appointed you to guard the array flag, Young Master Xiao should obey the order and not leave without permission. I’m afraid Elder Feng would not be happy if he knew about this. If anything happens here, who will bear the consequences?”

“It’s so peaceful here. What could possibly happen?” Yang Kai stared at him coldly.

Huo Han smiled faintly, “Who knows? I’m also saying just in case… “

“I’m just going for a walk. I’ll be back soon.” Yang Kai interjected.

Huo Han warned, “Even leaving for just a moment is still considered abandoning your post. If Young Master Xiao insists on doing so, I’ll have no choice but to report this to the Elders.”

He hated Yang Kai for torturing him before, so it was natural for him to seize this opportunity to irritate him. Moreover, the job of these Seeking Passion Sect disciples stationed here was not only to assist the Emperor Realm Master who received the Recruitment Order to guard the array flag, but also to monitor them.

After all, it was hard to judge one’s heart from his or her face. No one knew whether these Emperor Realm Masters were reliable or not; only their own loyal disciples could be trusted.

Therefore, there would be some Seeking Passion Sect disciples under every foreign Emperor Realm Master. Although there were not many of them, Feng Chi needed these disciples to restrict these outsiders’ movements.

Yang Kai was exasperated looking at Huo Han’s serious yet proud face.

He knew that Huo Han was taking revenge on him, but since Huo Han had made his warning clear, Yang Kai could not act recklessly. If he really caught Feng Chi’s attention, Yang Kai was afraid that he would be monitored more closely.

“Fine, I won’t take a walk then. It’s not a big deal anyway,” Yang Kai chuckled, turned back and returned to his cabin, slamming the door behind him.

Huo Han stood still in the same spot, a happy smile on his face.

Soon, night came.

When Yang Kai was still thinking of a countermeasure, murmuring voices were heard from the outside. After listening carefully for a while, Yang Kai’s face darkened.

The topic that the five hundred cultivators outside were tattling about was not about anything else but himself.

“Have you heard that? Although our Sir Xiao has a huge background, he is a henpecked man.”

“This news is widespread. It’s also said that his fiancée is so hideous that no one could bear to look her in the eye. Furthermore, she is also a shrew of a woman. Sir Xiao could not stand being tortured by his fiancée in Azure Sun Temple and had to escape to the Northern Territory.”

“Haha, I thought he was strong, but he actually fears his woman.”

“Seriously? Such a thing even exists?”

“He said it himself in the Recruitment Hall, how can it be wrong? There were a lot of witnesses present at that time.”

“I think Sir Xiao probably hasn’t met any beautiful woman in his life yet, so he had to come here to receive the Recruitment Order, in hopes of picking up some beauties after Ice Heart Valley is destroyed.

“What’s the point of bringing them back? With a domineering wife at home, I’m afraid that he will not have the guts to go against her. At most, he will only be able to enjoy looking at them.”

“Pitiful, pitiful. He still dares to call himself an Emperor Realm Master? What a disgrace to men.”

…..

Yang Kai mumbled to himself, wondering who was the bastard that spread out these rumours, causing everyone to gossip about him. By now, his, or rather, Xiao Bai’s unsightly ‘history’ was known throughout the city.

Back then, Yang Kai just blabbered some random nonsense in the Recruitment Hall, never expecting he would be teased by everyone now because of this.

Needless to say, it must be Huo Han who spread these rumours.

Although it was just false information, Yang Kai was still annoyed by these people talking behind his back, especially since they were technically his subordinates right now. Embarrassed and filled with a full stomach of grievances, Yang Kai could not help snorting loudly.

Hearing his voice, the discussion outside abruptly ceased. Everyone exchanged glances, and could not help snickering.

“Becoming angry out of shame!” Huo Han gazed at the direction of the cabin, sneering lightly.

Yang Kay stayed in the cabin for two days, for Huo Han’s obstruction and surveillance had given him no choice but to come up with another plan.

As a Master proficient in the Dao of Space, a trivial Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator could never be able to detect it if Yang Kai truly wanted to leave, but he had to be extra careful as he was deep in enemy territory now.

On the third day, Yang Kai, who was meditating in the cabin, suddenly heard a trail of footsteps from outside, followed by a familiar voice, “Cao Xu requests to see Young Master Xiao.”

Yang Kai frowned, as he had no idea why Cao Xu came here. He did not reappear until today since he brought him here a few days ago.

Still feeling dubious about his sudden visit, Yang Kai opened the door and went out with his hand fan waving.

Before he could stand firm though, Yang Kai heard a cold, wrath-filled snort in front of him, followed by an overwhelming aura rushing towards him.

Yang Kai’s face changed abruptly as he staggered a few steps back, staring forward with wide-eyed eyes.

Standing before him was Cao Xu, who had a forced smile on his face. Beside him was a woman dressed in white from head to toe, as if she clothed herself in snow. She had a curvy and exquisite figure that men would not be able to resist fantasizing about while gazing at her.

But the look on her face was stomach-turning.

Freckles and pockmarks were unevenly distributed all over the woman’s face, monolids framing small eyes, and a flat nose accentuated her wide mouth. Although her eyes were energetic, given such ‘majestic’ light, they were also sharp as knives, making any who met them shudder.

The ugliness of this woman’s appearance was indescribable. What could this woman have done to offend the Heavens to be given such a punishment?

“Wha… wha… wha…” Yang Kai’s eyes almost popped out from their sockets as he exclaimed in shock, unable to finish his sentence.

“Hmph, I can’t believe you really came here! You made it all too easy for this Young Lady to find you!” The ugly woman gnashed her teeth and snapped at Yang Kai, as if she was about to peel his skin and tear his flesh.

Yang Kai was drenched in sweat, asking nervously as he wiped his sweat, “What… what are you doing here?”

He totally did not expect the woman in front of him would actually come here.

Despite the strange and hideous look of the woman, Yang Kai recognized her at a glance.

Ji Yao!

It was not that Yang Kai had a sharp vision, it was that Ji Yao deliberately released her own aura at the moment of meeting. Yang Kai and Ji Yao had been together for quite some time, so he was quite familiar with her.

Ji Yao’s current face was obviously a disguise made by Shi Tian He, and there was no trace of her original appearance at all.

Yang Kai had left Ice Heart Valley alone just a few days ago because he did not want to get Ji Yao involved in his plan, but he did not expect that she actually came to him on her own. Moreover, she was brought here by Cao Xu.

[What’s happening!?]

Yang Kai secretly glanced at Cao Xu in horror while the latter forced a smile, “Young Master Xiao, this… this Lady said that she was engaged to you and has come to find you, so… Young Master Xiao, hehe, please forgive me!”

Cao Xu’s voice was hoarse, filled with helplessness.

“Engaged!?” Yang Kai was exasperated.

The five hundred cultivators who meditated nearby also looked over in curiosity. When they saw Ji Yao’s current appearance, their faces changed. For those with poor mental endurance, they instantly turned around and vomited.

“Too ugly, too ugly! No wonder Sir Xiao had to escape from the Southern Region! If I had a fiancée like this, I would run too!”

“I feel sorry for Sir Xiao, too sorry for him… He is an Emperor Realm Master after all, how did he end up with such a woman?”

“A gentleman prefers death to humiliation. It’s better to die proudly than to marry a woman like this!”

The place was buzzing with discussions, as most of the cultivators started to sympathize with Yang Kai from the bottom of their hearts.

After all, he was an Emperor Realm Master, so shouldn’t it have been natural that he could have any kind of beauty he wanted? Why did he have such an ugly fiancée? It was unbearable! Any man in his position would still be traumatized for life even if he extinguished all the lights every night.

However, Huo Han and the other Seeking Passion Sect disciples could not help taking pleasure in Yang Kai’s misfortune, waiting to watch a good show with their eyes peeled.

“What’s wrong?” Ji Yao approached forward with a domineering demeanour, “Do you wish to deny our parents’ orders and the matchmaker’s words? Even though this Young Lady’s looks are a bit mundane, there are still many who want to marry me! If you dare to deny our engagement, I’ll break off your legs right this instant!”

“A bit mundane…” Cao Xu gulped. He could not believe that this lady dared to say such words. It was a complete understatement of her current appearance. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“You recognize the wrong person. I don’t know you. Leave now, leave now!” Yang Kai covered his face and did not dare to look at Ji Yao’s face. At the same time, he sent her a Divine Sense Message stealthily, “Why did you come here? This place is really dangerous, quickly go back.”

Ji Yao yelled hysterically, “Xiao Bai Yi! Don’t reject a face-saving offer! If it weren’t for the order of the Sect Master, do you think this Young Lady would be willing to be engaged to you!?”

At the same time, she sent him a Divine Sense Message back, “How dare you leave me behind! Before, in the Ancient Lands, you lied to me again and again while taking advantage of me. Do you think I have forgotten about that?”

“How do you know my name is currently Xiao Bai Yi? And regarding those matters, you also know that I was forced by the circumstances!” While communicating with her via Divine Sense, Yang Kai continued to shout out loud, “The engagement doesn’t count, doesn’t count! From now on, you and I should walk our own, separate paths and stop appearing in each other’s life!”
