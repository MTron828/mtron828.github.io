The sparkling lights of the Yin Yang Monster Ginseng quickly seeped into Yang Kai and Su Yan’s pores, bathing them in a warm, comfortable feeling as the surrounding energy flooded into their bodies, permeating their five viscera and six organs.

As all of this occurred, an even deeper connection formed between the two.

Obviously the Yin Yang Monster Ginseng’s mysterious role was to forge a kind of invisible bridge between them. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Quickly examining his body Yang Kai found that even if he did not operate his Secret Art, the True Qi inside his meridians would circulate at a rapid pace and he could even faintly feel it blending with Su Yan’s.

On top of that, he found that his Secret Art could circulate much faster than before.

If he were to consciously operate it, this speed would rise once more. Yang Kai was heartened by this outcome and it showed on his face as he smiled happily.

It turns out it was like this, the Yin Yang Monster Ginseng didn’t need them to do anything, all he needed to do was reach a Union of Heart and Soul with Su Yan and it would take the initiative to support them.

By this point, the Yin Yang Monster Ginseng has ceased to exist and instead had transformed into a magical link between Yang Kai and Su Yan.

As long as the two weren’t too far away, even if they didn’t actively operate their Secret Arts, they would be able to passively absorb the surrounding World Energy and strengthen themselves while if they were to consciously circulate their Secret Arts, the efficiency of their cultivation would be redoubled.

Coupled with the effect of their Yin-Yang Joyous Unification Art, the pair’s cultivation speed was quite frightening.

“It feels like our child.” Su Yan touched her chest gently and felt the connection between herself and Yang Kai because of Yin Yang Monster Ginseng, her eyes glistening with a warm maternal light.

“Do you want one?” Yang Kai grinned towards her and laughed meaningfully.

Su Yan suddenly blushed and angrily stared back at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai licked his lips and prepared to pounce.

Upon seeing his expression, Su Yan immediately knew what he was thinking, causing her heart to flutter and her cheeks to burn, quickly lowering her head to avoid Yang Kai’s beast-like gaze.

Yang Kai’s breathing became heavy. Su Yan’s shy appearance had only further stimulated his primal instincts.

Just as he was about to leap forward and devour the prey before him, the sound of a fierce battle reached his ear and strong energy fluctuations erupted outside the mansion.

Yang Kai froze up before his expression became cold.

Being disturbed at this critical moment, Yang Kai’s good mood was thoroughly destroyed.

Su Yan released her Divine Sense and gasped slightly, “It seems like a new group has arrived in War City and has started a fight with that Beguiling Demon Queen outside.”

“I’ll go check it out.” Yang Kai let out a long sigh, wore a calm expression, stood up, and walked outside.

Regardless of everything else, Shan Qing Luo was at least somewhat related to him so he couldn’t just ignore her situation; he also wondered who was fighting with her.

After leaving the house, Yang Kai discovered that there was a group of people standing several thousand meters outside the Heavenly Palace’s barrier.

This group was not small, numbering at least a hundred people, most of them Immortal Ascension Boundary masters, all of them standing around staring up into the sky.

High above their heads, three people were besieging Shan Qing Luo. Each of these three was a Transcendent and working together they had cut off all of Shan Qing Luo’s possible escape routes.

The Beguiling Demon Queen had also broken through to the Transcendent Realm, but she was still quite young and burdened by the need to protect Bi Luo, how could she be the opponent of these three? As the fight dragged on, although she expertly used spider silk transformed from her True Qi to guard herself and Bi Luo, she was obviously being suppressed by her three opponents.

“Demon woman, surrender without a fight and we’ll spare your life!” From among the three attackers, an old man with a sallow complexion shouted.

“I never expected to encounter the famous Beguiling Demon Queen here. It’s really a case of wearing out iron shoes while seeking one’s feet. Such great fortune!” Another old man sneered, his actions clearly indicating he wanted to capture Shan Qing Luo alive.

“Fellow Brothers, take care not to kill her, she’s more useful as a bargaining chip with the Demon Lord!” The third person shouted loudly.

“She won’t die so easily, this devilish woman’s methods are too tricky.” The yellow skinned old man muttered in annoyance. Although it was three versus one, he fully realized that this enchantress was far from helpless; the three of them had no way to take her in short order, and if she wasn’t diverting her attention to guard the girl beside her, she would easily be able to escape from their encirclement.

“Mistress, don’t worry about me.” Bi Luo bit her lower lip anxiously; she also saw that she was a burden on Shan Qing Luo. How could she bear to see Shan Qing Luo fall into danger because of her?

Not waiting for Shan Qing Luo to reply, she immediately dove out from the scope of Shan Qing Luo’s protection.

“Bi Luo!” Shan Qing Luo cried out in alarm, moving rapidly to stop her but unable to block her path.

The sallow-faced old man stared coldly at Bi Luo who was rushing straight towards him, only using a casual palm strike to send the little tigress Bi Luo flying, blood flowing from her lips.

As an Immortal Ascension Boundary First Stage cultivator, there was no way for her to block even a single attack from a Transcendent master.

In an instant, her five viscera and six organs were all displaced and her Blood Force was all but dispersed. Pale as paper, Bi Luo’s consciousness blurred.

From the more than a hundred people who were watching the battle, one Immortal Ascension Boundary cultivator flew out to seize Bi Luo.

But before he could even approach her, a streak of light flashed past him and in the blink of an eye, Bi Luo had been snatched from his grasp.

The Immortal Ascension Boundary master’s brow wrinkled when he felt this intruder’s cultivation had only reached the Immortal Ascension Boundary Fourth Stage, coldly snorting as he shouted, “Drop her!”

As he spoke, he pushed his True Qi fiercely and sent out a punch, not intending to show any mercy.

Yang Kai’s expression dimmed when he noticed the murderous intent behind the opposite party’s strike, quickly returning the sentiment in kind with a punch of his own.

When the two fists connected, Yang Kai remained motionless but the Immortal Ascension Boundary Seventh Stage master screamed in pain and was sent flying back down to the crowd below.

This scene immediately caught the attention of the spectating crowd, all of them turning stunned gazes towards Yang Kai, many of them quickly wearing cold expressions.

Most of these people didn’t recognize Yang Kai, but since he had rescued Bi Luo, all of them naturally thought of him as one of Shan Qing Luo’s group.

“Young Master Yang?” One of the three men who were besieging Shan Qing Luo saw Yang Kai and couldn’t help calling out in surprise and quickly jumping back from the battle circle.

Yang Kai turned his head towards this old man and also wore a curious expression as he unconsciously called, “Senior Lu?”

This person was none other than Lu Si, the Lu Family’s Transcendent Realm Grand Elder. Both of them were quite surprised to meet here.

Lu Si didn’t know that Yang Kai’s house still existed inside War City while Yang Kai didn’t know Lu Si would suddenly appear here.

When the two of them shouted each other’s names, Shan Qing Luo’s battle also paused.

As the Beguiling Demon Queen stared at her three attackers vigilantly, her tender body flickered and appeared next to Yang Kai, worriedly staring towards Bi Luo as she asked, “How is she?”

“Her life is in no immediate danger.” Yang Kai shook his head and flew down to the front of the house with Shan Qing Luo where he handed Bi Luo over to Tang Yu Xian who had rushed out of the mansion, signaling her to bring her back inside to have her injuries treated.

After handling this matter, Yang Kai turned around and began to examine this group of newcomers.

At this moment, these people all stared towards Yang Kai curiously, their expression filled with a mix of shock and puzzlement. As far as they knew, War City had been completely destroyed many months ago, but today, standing before them, was a perfectly intact compound with a large number of masters actively bustling about.

Lu Si’s expression flickered, as if he was rapidly considering a great many matters, his look face slowly relaxing. On the contrary, the other two Transcendent Realm masters stared towards Yang Kai with a look of anger and malice.

Qiu Yi Meng soon came out and after seeing Lu Si, she asked curiously, “Lu Si, why have you come here?”

“Young Lady Qiu.” Lu Si nodded politely, “My Lu Family received the Conscription Command from the Eight Great Families and rushed to the Central Capital to help, but upon witnessing a strange World Vision, we came to investigate only to unexpectedly encounter and Evil King here.”

As he spoke, his eyes glanced between Yang Kai and Shan Qing Luo, not understanding what the relationship between these two and only knowing it wasn’t ordinary.

“So that’s it.” Qiu Yi Meng nodded lightly.

It had been almost half a year since the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land invaded. The Eight Great Families had issued a Conscription Command twice to the forces of the Great Han Dynasty but there were still few respondents.

However, the Lu Family was one of the Qiu Family’s attached forces, so even if Lu Si wasn’t willing, he still had to lead his family’s troops to the Central Capital.

“And these two are...” Qiu Yi Meng shifted her eyes towards the other two Transcendent cultivators.

Lu Si quickly introduced them, “This is Elder Huang Xiao Huang of the Huang Family, and this is Elder Jiang Zhe of Radiant Palace. Both of them were travelling together with this Lu to the Central Capital.”

Qiu Yi Meng faintly nodded. The Huang Family and Radiant Palace, similar to the Lu Family, had a close relationship with the Central Capital Eight Great Families. Because of this, when faced with the Conscription Command issued by Eight Great Families, they had steeled themselves and made their way to the Central Capital.

Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe both greeted Qiu Yi Meng, their attitudes calm and respectful, but when they looked at Yang Kai, their eyes flashed obvious disgust and disdain.

During the waning hours of the Inheritance War, the Eight Great Families had spared no expense to discredit Yang Kai, saying that he colluded with demons and wanted to rebel against the Central Capital. Such rumors had already spread all over the Great Han Dynasty and now that Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe had seen Yang Kai and Shan Qing Luo interacting so intimately, it only served to confirm the vile intelligence they had previously received.

This little bastard really was colluding with devils and demons.

“Young Lady Qiu, why are you here?” Lu Si asked, full of doubts. If it wasn’t for the spectacular World Vision, they wouldn’t have known that there were so many people still living inside War City.

“Taking refuge.” Qiu Yi Meng smiled.

“Refuge?” Lu Si parroted in shock.

“En, I’ve taken refuge here.”

Huang Xiao coldly snorted said, “Young Lady Qiu, what kind of refuge can be sought here? Isn’t this place already the rear base of the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land?”

Qiu Yi Meng’s expression didn’t change in the slightest as she smiled and replied, “Why does Elder Huang say such things?”

Huang Xiao unhesitantly pointed to Shan Qing Luo and Yang Kai and loudly shouted, “An Evil King of the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land and the Yang Family’s traitors Little Lord. Young Lady Qiu, you may be young and naive but you must not allow yourself to be deceived by this evil scum or you will regret it for the rest of your life.”

“Deceived by an evil traitor?” Qiu Yi Meng glanced over at Yang Kai briefly before shaking her head and saying temperately, “Many thanks for Elder Huang’s concern, but although I am indeed not as knowledgeable as Elder Huang Elder, I know what I am doing.”

Huang Xiao’s expression became gloomy as he shook his head. He thoroughly believed that Qiu Yi Meng had been bewildered by Yang Kai and could no longer clearly see reality.

It was nothing less than a miracle that this small mansion could remain intact in this blasted battlefield and the only logical explanation Huang Xiao could come up with was that the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land and Yang Kai had become allies, otherwise with the rest of War City being completely destroyed, how could his mansion still stand here unscathed?
