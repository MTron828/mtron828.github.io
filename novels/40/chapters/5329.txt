The last time Yang Kai came here, it was this Army Commander who took him to meet Wind and Cloud Pass’ Old Ancestor.

“Greetings, Senior Yuan,” Yang Kai bowed.

Yuan Xing Ge lightly nodded in response before solemnly asking, “What did you come here for?”

Anytime someone travelled between the Passes, it was accompanied by a major event. So, he immediately rushed over after receiving this news.

Yang Kai replied, “I have something I want to ask you.”

“Speak.”

“When Great Evolution Pass was breached 30,000 years ago, did anything unusual happen with Wind and Cloud Pass’ Space Array?”

“30,000 years ago…” Yuan Xing Ge was speechless, “This Yuan only arrived at Wind and Cloud Pass 10,000 years ago.”

How could he know anything about what had happened 30,000 years ago? It was too long ago. In fact, he wasn’t even born 30,000 years ago.

“Is there anyone alive from 30,000 years ago in the Pass?”

“There is… but they won’t necessarily know about this.”

Everyone had their own duties they were assigned to. Apart from the person guarding it at the time, it was unlikely anyone else would know anything about the matters of the Space Array.

After a moment of silence, Yuan Xing Ge asked, “Is this important?”

Yang Kai earnestly nodded, “It is of critical importance.”

Yuan Xing Ge turned around and stated, “Follow me, I’ll take you to the Old Ancestor.”

There was no point in asking others about this. It was best to just ask the Old Ancestor; after all, it had certainly been over 30,000 years since the current Old Ancestor began presiding over Wind and Cloud Pass.

A moment later, Yang Kai saw Wind and Cloud Pass Old Ancestor tending his cattle in the manifestation of his Small Universe at a secluded location in Wind and Cloud Pass once more.

Receiving Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao’s reminder, Yang Kai carefully observed this time and found that there was indeed an old ox with a broken horn, secretly guessing that it should be an extremely powerful Monster Beast.

Perhaps sensing Yang Kai’s gaze wandering on its ribs, the old ox, that was casually eating grass, raised its head and mooed.

Yang Kai cupped his fist and answered, “Reporting to Old Ancestor, Great Evolution Pass’ Core is missing.”

Yuan Xing Ge’s expression slightly changed after hearing this, but this was also well within his expectations; after all, the Black Ink Clan had occupied Great Evolution Pass for more than 30,000 years, so they definitely wouldn’t leave the Core behind.

Be that as it may, what he could not understand was what the loss of the Core had to do with Wind and Cloud Pass’ Space Array 30,000 years ago.

Without waiting for them to ask, Yang Kai explained, “Junior suspects that when Great Evolution Pass was breached, the Human soldiers from that time took the Core and tried to send it to Wind and Cloud Pass.”

The Old Ancestor looked at him with interest, “Why do you think so?”

Yang Kai replied with a serious look on his face, “If I were a Great Evolution soldier 30,000 years ago, and saw that the Old Ancestor would fall in battle and the Great Pass was likely to fall, my priority would be to think of a way to protect the Core. And if I wanted to protect it, the only way to do so would be to send it to a nearby Great Pass via the Space Array.”

The Old Ancestor nodded in agreement, “Hmm, that makes sense. Continue.”

“The Passes adjacent to Great Evolution Pass are Wind and Cloud Pass, and Azure Void Pass. At that time, the situation would have been urgent, so they would have definitely chosen one of these two.”

“Then why Wind and Cloud Pass and not Azure Void Pass?”

Yang Kai explained, “After recovering Great Evolution Pass, this Junior managed to repair Great Evolution Pass’ Hyper Space Array, but during the final tests, something went wrong when I tried to teleport to Wind and Cloud Pass. Something was interfering with the Space Array, preventing a smooth connection from being established between the two Passes. I had no choice but to enter the Void Corridor and break through the interference personally, allowing the Space Array to function smoothly. Senior Yuan should know about this.”

The nearby Yuan Xing Ge lightly nodded in agreement.

That day, when Great Evolution Pass’ Space Array connected to this place, a portal had opened, but nothing came through from the other side. It was only after waiting for a very long time that Yang Kai finally arrived.

As this had never happened before, the soldiers on duty that day immediately reported it to Yuan Xing Ge and the Army Commander of Wind and Cloud Pass’ Northern Army, Tian Lu.

Eventually, Yang Kai did arrive, solving the mystery.

Back then, Yang Kai was unable to understand what went wrong with the teleportation. Although he had transited the entire Void Corridor to investigate, he was still unable to find the reason.

What’s more, apart from the first time, nothing unusual happened with the later teleportations. So, Yang Kai didn’t pay any much attention to this matter. He only thought that it was because the Void Corridor had not been used for a long time and needed to be smoothed out or unblocked.

But now, it suddenly struck him that this was not the case.

There was a high chance that something was stuck in the Void Corridor and was interfering with its stability. So, even if they were able to determine the direction and open the portal, nothing was able to pass through it.

If Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao hadn’t told him about Great Evolution Pass’ Core, it would have never occurred to Yang Kai that these two seemingly unrelated matters were actually closely related.

Obviously, the Old Ancestor understood this and asked, “So you suspect that Great Evolution Pass’ Core was lost in the Void Crack and the power it gave off was interfering with the passage between the two Passes?”

Yang Kai nodded, “That is my hypothesis.”

As for what exactly happened that day, no one knew. And it was impossible to investigate what had happened 30,000 years ago as everyone who knew had most likely already died.

The moment the Core was sent, the soldiers must have disabled the Space Array in haste, causing the Void Corridor to become unstable. The Core must have been lost in the Void Crack then because of this, and that is why it had not been found in the last 30,000 years.

“However, these are all my speculations, so I need some kind of proof before taking further action.”

This was the reason why he had come to Wind and Cloud Pass to inquire about the situation. If something unusual had happened with the Hyper Space Array of Wind and Cloud Pass back then, it would greatly bolster his conjecture.

“Mhmm.” The Old Ancestor nodded lightly, “Wait a moment, 30,000 years…is a very long time.”

Even a Master like the Old Ancestor might not be able to recall what happened so long ago. Not to mention, the Old Ancestor might not have been paying attention to the Space Array at the time.

As such, he needed to calm his mind and search his memories for the scene from 30,000 years ago to find some clues.

The verdant mountains and clear waters sunk into silence for the moment as the Old Ancestor’s eyes drooped, as if he had fallen asleep.

Yang Kai and Yuan Xing Ge quietly stood in place, respectfully waiting.

Only a few old oxen were leisurely eating grass nearby.

At first, everything seemed normal, but as time passed, the verdant mountains began to slightly quake and ripples appeared on the calm and clear waters.

It was obvious that the Old Ancestor was mobilizing his strength. It happened in the distant past and there was no specific point in time, so it was not easy to find a small bit of trivial information even for someone as strong as the Old Ancestor.

After half a day, Wind and Cloud Pass’ Old Ancestor suddenly raised his head.

The trembling Small Universe instantly calmed down.

Yang Kai focused his gaze on him.

The Old Ancestor lightly nodded to Yang Kai, “It seems your guess is right on the mark. The day Great Evolution Pass was breached, a portal had indeed opened at our Space Array, but it disappeared right after it appeared. Even the soldiers on duty were unable to locate its origin, so this matter was left unsettled.”

Yang Kai excitedly cried, “So the Core really isn’t in the hands of the Black Ink Clan.”

Although he felt that his guess was correct, it wasn’t until the Old Ancestor here personally confirmed that something unusual had indeed happened with the Space Array that he was certain.

This was great news.

As long as Great Evolution Pass’ Core was not in the hands of the Black Ink Clan, it became a simple matter.

If the Core really was in the hands of the Black Ink Clan, that would be rather troublesome. Although Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao had been pressuring the Royal Lord, why would the Royal Lord easily compromise? If he really had the Core, he would definitely not return it unless she killed him.

And how could a Royal Lord who could mobilize the power of his Black Ink Nest be so easy to kill? No matter how serious his injuries were, so long as he was in his Royal City, he could use the Black Ink Nest to fight with Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao. If he was pushed into a corner, he might even be able to drag Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao down with him.

This was something Great Evolution Pass could not bear.

But now… Yang Kai felt a little sorry for the Royal Lord.

Speaking of which, he had been to several Theatres, but he had never seen such a miserable Royal Lord. He was basically bullied and humiliated by Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao time and time again, but there was nothing he could do about it.

Presumably, when Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao asked him for Great Evolution Pass’ Core, a look of despair must have filled his face.

He could do nothing about it if he did not have it.

Yuan Xing Ge asked, “Just now, you said that you vaguely sensed some kind of disturbance in the Void Corridor. Does this mean that Great Evolution Pass’ Core is still there?”

“Yes,” Yang Kai nodded in agreement.

“Can you find it?”

Yang Kai took a deep breath, “This Junior will do his best.”

In this World, there were not many who stood a chance of finding an artifact that had been lost for 30,000 years in the Void Crack.

On the Divine Spirit’s side, the Phoenix Clan with strong Bloodlines might be able to, but on the Human Race’s side, only Yang Kai was capable.

After confirming that Great Evolution Pass’ Core was still lost in the Void, Yang Kai bid farewell to Yuan Xing Ge and quickly returned to the Space Array.

“Senior Brothers, please activate the Space Array.” Yang Kai bowed.

The soldiers on duty immediately started setting everything up.

Yuan Xing Ge was silent for a moment before asking in a low voice, “How confident are you?”

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “I won’t return unless I find the Core.”

Yuan Xing Ge glanced at him for a moment before cautioning, “Your own safety is of utmost importance.”

“I understand!” Yang Kai earnestly replied. The Spirit Array was set, so he stepped forward.

The Grand Array buzzed before a dazzling glow enveloped Yang Kai and he disappeared.

If it was a normal teleportation, Yang Kai would probably appear in Great Evolution Pass after just a few breaths, but this time, he had to enter the Void Corridor to search for the Core, so he had to interrupt the teleportation.

As soon as he sensed the power of Space Principles from the Space Array, Yang Kai immediately used his own Space Principles to resist the pulling force he felt. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai appeared in the turbulent Void.

In the Void Crack, Void Turbulences were the most dangerous thing. These turbulences had no set pattern and moved randomly, like wild beasts.

If anyone who didn’t have a high comprehension of the Dao of Space was pulled into a Void Turbulence, they would lose all sense of direction and become trapped forever.

Only a miserable fate awaited a person trapped in the Void Crack.
