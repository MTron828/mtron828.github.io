In the Sealed World Bead, Yang Kai sat in a cross-legged position, looking as tranquil as an ancient well.

In front of him was his Purple Origin Furnace, with its lid closed and an intense heat coming from it.

From time to time, knocking sounds could be heard coming from inside the Purple Origin Furnace, as if something was struggling inside it, trying to escape. At this moment, Yang Kai was pouring his Qi into the Purple Origin Furnace, trying to suppress whatever was struggling inside.

As time went by, the Purple Origin Furnace turned extremely red, so hot that it began distorting the surrounding space.

Meanwhile, the struggle inside the furnace was also growing weaker and weaker.

After an entire day, the furnace finally calmed down. Yang Kai called for Liu Yan before opening the Purple Origin Furnace with the wave of his hand. Immediately, Liu Yan turned into a fiery beam and shot out from the furnace before assuming her human form before him.

“Master,” Liu Yan greeted Yang Kai and handed him the gold and silver coloured Wood Spirit Seed before adding, “Master, you may rest assured, this thing could not be any deader.”

“Good job.” Yang Kai nodded with satisfaction, taking the peculiar Wood Spirit Seed and pouring his Divine Sense into it, confirming that Liu Yan was indeed right. The faint Soul wisp hidden inside the Wood Spirit Seed had completely disappeared.

Obviously, the Soul wisp belonged to the Wood Spirit, and unless it was completely destroyed, the Wood Spirit would continue to live on.

But after being thrown by Yang Kai into the Purple Origin Furnace and refined by Liu Yan for a full day and night, how could the residual Soul of the Wood Spirit survive? It had long been wiped out by the scorching heat.

At this moment, the seed in Yang Kai’s hand could no longer be regarded as the Wood Spirit’s seed, but the original seed before the Wood Spirit grew from.

Yang Kai had no idea what the Wood Spirit’s actual body was before it gained sentience; after all, he had never seen a seed like this before.

But since it could stand being burned by the joint effort of Liu Yan’s and his flames for an entire day and night without getting damaged, it was far from ordinary.

If this seed was planted, it might gain sentience again after tens of thousands of years, becoming another Wood Spirit, but that one would have nothing to do with the previous one.

“What are you going to do with this thing?” Asked Liu Yan, glancing at Yang Kai.

“I don’t know. What do you suggest?” Yang Kai looked up at her.

Liu Yan also shook her head, “Master, that is up to you; however, I feel that the two energies flowing in this seed would bring you a great advantage.”

“Oh? Why do you say that?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“I just have a feeling, that’s all. If you really want me to explain it, I can’t describe it exactly,” Liu Yan smiled.

Yang Kai gently nodded before returning his gaze to the peculiar Wood Spirit Seed and pondering. Suddenly, his eyes lit up as if he had come up with a good idea.

The next moment, his figure flickered as he directly arrived at the medicine garden of the Small Sealed World. Then, he looked for a good spot, dug up a little bit of earth, and planted the Wood Spirit Seed in his hand.

He had no idea what this Wood Spirit Seed was or what its uses were, but since that was the case, he could just grow it himself to investigate.

And in this world, what place would be more suitable for planting the Wood Spirit Seed than the medicine garden inside the Sealed World Bead?

This was a medicine garden with a vast amount of Heavy Earth buried beneath it and five Earth Vein Crystals supplying rich amounts of World Energy. In this place, the growth period of the Wood Spirit Seed would be greatly shortened and in just a few years, Yang Kai would be able to figure out what it was.

After carefully re-checking, Yang Kai clapped and smiled in satisfaction. The next moment, his figure distorted again as he reappeared before Liu Yan.

“It’s done! Let’s return to Maplewood City. Accompany me, I need to ask you some questions,” Yang Kai said, looking at Liu Yan.

“Yes.” Liu Yan nodded before she turned into a fiery beam and shot straight into Yang Kai’s body, disappearing right after.

Yang Kai then left the Sealed World Bead, determined his bearings, and swiftly headed towards Maplewood City.

.....

Somewhere about ten thousand kilometres away from Maplewood City, Flying Saint Palace.

Surrounded by mountains and rising clouds, Flying Saint Palace was a majestic sight to behold.

And on a certain peak, an old man with a naked chest and white hair was sitting cross-legged, facing east. This old man’s eyes were closed as he inhaled and exhaled slowly. Every time he breathed out, his breath seemed to transform into birds and beasts that would walk or run away, disappearing into the depths of the forest in the blink of an eye. He was clearly cultivating some strange, profound Secret Art.

Suddenly, the old man opened his eyes and a gleam appeared in their depths, causing anyone who saw it to shudder.

“Hmph, this old master said not to disturb him unless it was something of critical importance. Tell me, what is the matter this time? If it turns out to be something trivial, it will be your head!” The old man suddenly stated in a cold tone without even turning his head.

Several dozen metres behind him, a middle-aged man in black robes immediately froze as drops of cold sweat trickled down his forehead. Promptly cupping his fists, he reported in a trembling voice, “Reporting to the Palace Master, Young Palace Master’s life crystal has shattered!”

Judging by the middle-aged man’s words, this old man happened to be Flying Saint Palace’s Palace Master, Ning Bo Yang.

“Yuan Chen’s life crystal shattered?” Ning Bo Yang’s expression turned colder upon hearing this, the temperature on the mountain top dropping sharply.

“Yes,” the middle-aged man replied in a heavy voice, not daring to lift his head.

“Hmph, that rascal’s life was destined to be short from the start. Since his crystal has shattered, that’s all there is to it,” Ning Bo Yan indifferently said.

“Ah?” The middle-aged man was stunned, not having expected someone to show such an indifferent attitude even after knowing that his son had died.

[Could it be... that the Young Palace Master wasn’t really his son?] The middle-aged man couldn’t help wondering.

“Since Yuan Cheng is dead, let Yuan Shu be the Young Palace Master, see to it yourselves and stop disturbing this old master,” ordered Ning Bo Yang.

The middle-aged man didn’t dare to be neglectful and hurriedly nodded, “Yes, I will obey Palace Master’s orders.”

“However... Yuan Cheng might have been a fool, but he was still my son, the Young Palace Master of the Flying Saint Palace! Someone daring to defecate on my Flying Saint Palace’s head is utterly unacceptable. Find out who is responsible and bring me his head!”

“Yes!” The middle-aged bowed respectfully.

“You may go,” Ning Bo Yang waved.

The middle-aged man immediately backed away without saying another word.

...

In Star Soul Palace, the true overlord of the Star Boundary’s Southern Territory, a similar scene was taking place.

In a secret room, a short old man was listening to the report from a beautiful woman in front of him, and after listening to it, he furrowed his brow and asked, “Did that little bastard’s life crystal really shatter?”

“Reporting to Honoured Master, Junior Brother Han’s life crystal has indeed broken,” the beautiful woman respectfully replied.

“That evil boy was as slippery as a loach, even evading this old master’s personal pursuit, so how did he die?” The old man let out a cold snort, “Waste!”

“Honoured Master, please restrain your anger, Junior Brother Han is already dead, and no matter who killed him, it can be regarded as cleaning house on behalf of Honored Master,” the beautiful woman comforted. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Cleaning house?” The old man let out a cold snort and snapped, “This old master does not need anyone to intervene in his affairs!”

“Disciple has made a mistake, please forgive me, Honoured Master!” The beautiful woman’s face turned pale as she heard this shout.

“Go and investigate who did it, and... while this old master cares nothing for his other possessions, your Junior Brother Han had a token on him, make sure you retrieve it and bring it back to me!” The old man commanded.

“A token?” The beautiful woman was stunned, asking curiously, “May I ask Honoured Master what kind of token it is?”

The old man calmly glanced at her and said, “If you really see it, you will know what it is, explaining anymore is useless!”

“Yes, Disciple will deal with this as quickly as possible. Honoured Master need only wait for good news.” The beautiful woman hurriedly left the secret room, not daring to ask anymore.

After the beautiful woman left, an uncertain and pondering look appeared on the short old man’s face before he suddenly cursed, “Little bastard, you’re lucky that you didn’t die at this old master’s hand!”

.....

“So, after you exited the starlight passage, you fell into the Black Blood Swamp?” Yang Kai asked while making a beeline toward Maplewood City.

The Black Blood Swamp was not too far from Maplewood City, just a hundred thousand kilometres or so away, so Yang Kai had naturally heard of it before.

“En,” Liu Yan’s voice sounded in his head, “I also know that my existence can easily arouse others’ greed, so I’ve been hiding there and didn’t dare to show myself easily.”

“What happened next?” Yang Kai asked.

“Later, I fought with many Monster Beasts in the swamp. Some wanted to devour me, but I managed to escape each time, though at one point, when I was fighting with a certain Monster Beast, I was discovered by a passing master. That man had a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation and not only easily killed the Monster Beast I was fighting, but also captured me. He then sealed me in that bowl.” Liu Yan still seemed to be a little shaken as she recalled her recent encounters, “Fortunately, that man’s Secret Art was Water Attributed, the opposite of my essence, so he brought me to an auction being held in Maplewood City instead of keeping me for himself.”

“It sounds like all sorts of chances and coincidences lead you here,” Yang Kai smiled.

Indeed many chances and coincidences played a part in helping him meet with Liu Yan again. If he didn’t come to Maplewood City after escaping from the Blue Feather Sect, he would have definitely missed Liu Yan.

And once someone like Liu Yan was captured, she would not necessarily survive for long. She would definitely be integrated into an artifact or swallowed and absorbed by a cultivator to enhance their own strength.

“In any case, it’s a blessing to be reunited with Master now. By the way, Master, what about Xiao Xiao?” Liu Yan suddenly asked. She and Xiao Xiao were both Yang Kai’s helpers, his left and right arms so to speak. She had spent many years together with Xiao Xiao, so she was quite attached to him and cared about his situation.

Yang Kai wore a sad look as he shook his head, “There’s still no news.”

“I hope he is safe and sound,” Liu Yan’s tone also fell.

In their native Star Field, they were nearly invincible existences, but after coming to the Star Realm, Liu Yan discovered that there were many powerful people here who she could not currently hope to match, and since even she had been captured by others, it was obvious Xiao Xiao may also be in danger.
