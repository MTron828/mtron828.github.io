Upon hearing Yang Kai’s question, Li Jiao became suspicious too. He frowned and asked, “That’s right. Why did you end up here? What happened to the guy who harmed you?”

Lu San Niang lowered her head and was silent for a while before she whispered, “After being taken back to Dragon Island, I was imprisoned in the Dragon Palace. It was a life no better than death.” Her voice choked, and her body trembled continuously, “Until fourteen years ago…” She turned and glanced at her daughter with a sad smile, “I was finally driven out of the Dragon Palace when Qin’er was born.”

Li Jiao was taken aback by her words and couldn’t quite wrap his head around what she said, but when he finally returned to his senses, his complexion turned pale with rage as he slammed his fists down on the table and shouted, “That bastard!”

Similarly, Yang Kai’s expression was no better, [That Dragon Clan member really is a piece of shit. It was bad enough that he kidnapped a woman, brought her to Dragon Island, and made her suffer for so many years, yet he kicked her out when her daughter was born?! Where are his morals?! Is he someone without a heart!?]

Yang Kai had not held much prejudice against the Dragon Clan before, simply feeling that they were too arrogant for their own good. On this point, both Zhu Qing and Zhu Lie were carved from the same mould; however, if the Dragon Clan was not arrogant, could they even be called the Dragon Clan anymore? He never expected the Dragon Clan, who called themselves the strongest and the head of the myriad spirits, to actually have such reprehensible conduct.

“Then this girl is…” Yang Kai looked at the girl when he asked the question.

She said nothing to that, but the meaning was obvious enough.

“She is a child of that bastard, she has their blood flowing through her! Why was she kicked out of that Dragon Palace?” Li Jiao frowned. As the saying went, ‘even a vicious tiger would not eat its cubs’. Regardless of the circumstances, her daughter was still part of the Dragon Clan, so why would they kick both mother and daughter out of the Dragon Palace the moment the daughter was born?

Lu San Niang replied in a quivering voice, “Those are the rules of the Dragon Palace. It doesn’t matter if you are infertile or have yet to give birth to children, but once you do, those without a Dragon Vein will be expelled from the Dragon Palace. Qin’er she… Wasn’t born with a Dragon Vein.”

“What kind of rule is that?!” Li Jiao was furious. [These children are their flesh and blood, regardless of whether they have Dragon Vein or not! How can they kick their children out like they were disposing of unwanted garbage?! Isn’t the Dragon Clan being too inhumane?!]

“This is truly too much!” Yang Kai lost any favourable impression he had towards the Dragon Clan.

However, Lu San Niang smiled sadly and shook her head, “These kinds of stories are not uncommon on Dragon Island.” Turning to look outside, she pointed at the pedestrians who came and went outside, “Where did you think all these people in Half-Dragon City came from?”

“Where do they come from?” Li Jiao asked.

She explained, “Many of them were expelled from Dragon Palace. Even if they themselves weren’t, their ancestors were.”

“What!?” Yang Kai and Li Jiao widened their eyes in unison.

“There are very few true members of the Dragon Clan and it is always very difficult for them to conceive children. Thousands of years can go by without a single new addition to the clan. Additionally, the ratio between men and women is very unbalanced in the Dragon Clan. Hence, most adult males in the Dragon Clan leave Dragon Island occasionally to search for excellent women, kidnap them, bring them back, and use them as tools to fulfil their desires. Over time, many of these women would eventually become pregnant. After giving birth, they can remain in Dragon Palace under observation. Even if the child is born with a Dragon Vein, it must be of a certain order or else even they will be expelled from the Dragon Palace. That’s how Humans, Monsters, and even Dragonborn with impure bloodlines have been added to Dragon Island over the years. As the number of Humans, Monsters and Dragonborn increased, they eventually established Half-Dragon City. That’s how Half-Dragon City began. Afterwards, the residents of Half-Dragon City got together with each other and gave birth to the next generation. Over the years, the population increased and gradually developed into what it is right now.”

After listening to Lu San Niang’s explanation, Yang Kai and Li Jiao were so shocked that they couldn’t say a word for a very long time. [Is that how Half-Dragon City was formed? All living creatures in Half-Dragon City, be they Human, Monster Race, or Dragonborn, are descendants of the Dragon Clan?! T-That’s… Just unbelievable…]

Lu San Niang had made it very clear. A portion of the people in Half-Dragon City were driven out from Dragon Palace; these people were none other than the women who had been captured by the Dragon Clan and their respective children, like Lu San Niang. However, this group was small in number. The rest were the descendants of people like them that had continually reproduced over the generations; they made up the vast majority of the population.

[No wonder this place was named Half-Dragon City. It turns out that there is an actual reason for this moniker. All the residents in Half-Dragon City had some relation to the Dragon Clan. What else should the city be called if not Half-Dragon City?]

At first, Li Jiao felt as if he had been cheated on by his once future wife. Unfortunately, there was nowhere to vent his anger. Even meeting with her today caused unpleasant emotions to erupt within him and the reason he asked so many pointed questions of her was that he simply wanted to get a clear picture of the situation.

But after listening to those words, all Li Jiao felt now for her was sympathy and regret. It wasn’t her fault for being kidnapped. At the time, she was only a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, so how much resistance could she put up against a member of the Dragon Clan? Besides, what happened to her was so saddening that he couldn’t even blame her anymore.

Letting out a long sigh, he couldn’t help feeling that he was not fated to be in a relationship with her. Then, he looked at the girl and asked, “What is your child’s name?”

She replied, “Yu Qin. Lu Yu Qin!”

Li Jiao nodded and asked another question, “What is the name of the Dragon that harmed you?”

Lifting her head, she anxiously asked, “What are you going to do?!”

“I was humiliated so badly, and it’s all that guy’s fault. Don’t I at least have the right to know his name?”

Lu San Niang shook her head without saying anything. It was clear that she wasn’t willing to tell him the name of that Dragon Clan member, lest she bring trouble down on him. She understood Li Jiao’s circumstances, but… the other party was a member of the Dragon Clan, and this was Dragon Island. How could Li Jiao possibly bear to offend that man? She did not want to see him meeting a tragic ending because of her.

Her reaction enraged Li Jiao and he was just about to say something when he frowned and turned to look into the distance.

At the same time, Yang Kai seemed to notice it too and focused his gaze in the same direction.

“A Dragon!” Li Jiao shouted with a solemn expression.

He and Yang Kai had been searching this place for so long to no avail. They saw neither hair nor hide of the Dragon Clan during this time. Who could have known that the Dragon Clan would show up on their own initiative? Before that member of the Dragon Clan approached, a monstrous power washed over them from a distance and Li Jiao couldn’t even move a muscle from the effects of the bloodline suppression. Similarly, the many Dragonborn in Half-Dragon City noticed what was happening and quickly stopped and stared.

A loud Dragon Roar soon came from afar. Immediately after that, the figure of a Great Dragon appeared before everybody. It was a Green Dragon a few dozen meters long and it flew through the clouds and quickly arrived in the skies above Half-Dragon City. The Dragon Body covered the skies as its giant head stared down from above.

The entire Half-Dragon City seemed to tremble and all the residents within it panicked. The Dragon Clan was absolute on Dragon Island. Furthermore, the Dragon Clan rarely came to Half-Dragon City. For one to suddenly appear left them feeling at a loss for what to do. They did not know the reason for this Green Dragon’s sudden appearance.

That Green Dragon remained in mid-air for a long time, taking in the entire situation of Half-Dragon City before assuming human form. A young man in his twenties or thirties appeared on the spot with a flash of light. He was wearing gaudy clothes, looking like a butterfly flying through the city.

Following that, a figure suddenly flew out from Half-Dragon City.

Yang Kai and Li Jiao watched this scene with shocked expressions. This couldn’t be helped though as the person who flew over to meet the Green Dragon was none other than the person Li Jiao had beaten up earlier.

At this moment, the sinister and vicious-looking man cautiously and respectfully landed in front of the Green Dragon with a fawning smile. He was shorter than the Green Dragon by a head. Furthermore, he had yet to recover from the injuries he sustained before so his cheeks were badly swollen, and he had lost some teeth. Combined with his current ingratiating behaviour, he looked extremely ridiculous.

The Green Dragon glanced at the sinister and vicious-looking man and frowned slightly. The contempt and disgust in his eyes were obvious.

“Greetings, Senior Fu Qi. I didn’t know you were coming. Do you have any instructions for me?” The sinister man did not immediately start snitching to this Green Dragon by the name of Fu Qi. That was because he knew that everyone in Half-Dragon City, including himself, were nothing but ants in the eyes of the Dragon Clan. Although he could communicate with the other side of Dragon Island, he was still no different from an ant to them. Trying to tattle at this moment would not only make Fu Qi ignore him, but it would also annoy Fu Qi instead.

Fu Qi did not look at the sinister and vicious-looking man at all and simply said indifferently, “The Dragon Blood Flowers need watering.”

The sinister and vicious-looking man hurriedly nodded when he heard those words, “I understand. I will prepare for it immediately. Will two hundred as usual be enough?”

Fu Qi nodded gently, “Yes.”

“Sir, please return ahead of me. I will bring the people to Dragon Palace immediately.”

Fu Qi then added, “I also need five hundred ordinary people!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The sinister and vicious-looking man was stunned by those words, “Five hundred ordinary people?”

He looked confused, wondering why Fu Qi made such a sudden request like that. In the past, the Dragon Clan essentially only came to Half-Dragon City for matters related to the Dragon Blood Flowers. It had always been enough to bring two hundred Dragonborn over to the Dragon Palace. There had never been a precedent where ordinary people had been brought along before.

Regardless of how high a person’s cultivation was, they were nothing but ordinary people to the Dragon Clan as long as they did not have the Dragon Clan’s bloodline in them.

“What for?” He didn’t quite understand the situation.

“Are you questioning me?” Fu Qi turned around and glanced at the sinister and vicious-looking man with a frigid look.

In response, the sinister and vicious-looking man became anxious. He knew he should not have asked that question. No matter what the Dragon Clan did, his job was simply to do as he was ordered. He did not have the right to inquire too much into it; therefore, he immediately lowered his head and said, “Of course not. I wouldn’t dare. Please forgive me, Senior Fu Qi, I was careless with my words.”

“Scram!” Fu Qi spat out before closing his eyes and standing there motionlessly.

The sinister and vicious-looking man thanked the Heavens for his luck before he immediately spun around and flew towards Half-Dragon City.

Inside the teahouse, Lu San Niang’s beautiful face paled drastically as she screamed, “Big Brother Li, please leave immediately! It will be too late if you don’t leave right now!”

Li Jiao frowned as he watched the sinister and vicious-looking man fly towards them and calmly replied, “It’s already too late to run.”

He had assaulted that sinister and vicious-looking man previously, and it was clear that the other party was holding a grudge over it. Although he did not hear what that man said to that Green Dragon, Li Jiao knew that he couldn’t get out of this easily just by looking at the unkind expression on that man’s face.

[Do I regret doing that? No, I don’t.] Lu San Niang was being humiliated right in front of his eyes, so if he had just stood idly by, he wouldn’t be able to call himself a man ever again. It was just that Li Jiao had not expected trouble to come knocking on his door so soon.

Lu San Niang once mentioned that the sinister and vicious-looking man could communicate with the other side. Now, it would seem that the ‘other side’ was referring to Dragon Palace and the Dragon Clan.
