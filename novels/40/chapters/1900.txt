Chapter 1900, I’m Waiting

Seven Colored Elk was an ancient species that had long been extinct.

Its Monster Core was one of the main ingredients for refining the Soul Source Restoration Pill. And its heart was one of the main ingredients for refining the Ten Thousand Year Incense.

The Ten Thousand Year Incense had the effect of calming the Qi and Soul. Just one incense could last for ten thousand years. If the Ten Thousand Year Incense was lit when a cultivator was cultivating, his or her heart would not be consumed by their heart demon; his or her mind would remain clear. It was extremely useful for cultivation.

Now, the Rising Dragon Palace of the High Heaven Sect had a part of the Ten Thousand Year Incense burning continuously. Naturally, it was brought by Yang Kai from the Sixth Stage of the Flowing Flame Sand Field.

If any High Heaven Sect disciple needed to break through, he or she could go to the Rising Dragon Palace and cultivate there. There wasn’t just Ten Thousand Year Incense but also the Nine Branch Jade Crystal Tree, a Martial Dao precious treasure in itself that could help the disciples understand the True Essence of Martial Dao Heavenly Way.

As a matter of fact, Ten Thousand Year Incense and Nine Branch Jade Crystal Tree had contributed a lot to the rapid progress of High Heaven Sect disciples over these years. Had it not for these two treasures, the overall strength of the High Heaven Sect would have been a level lower.

The Seven Colored Elk’s entire body was a treasure. Whether it was the Monster Core or the heart, they were very hard to find.

But who would have thought the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce would actually found a Seven Colored Elk’s Monster Core. Even someone like Yang Kai could not help but be shocked.

Ai Ou took out the round and glittering Monster Core from his Space Ring while speaking.

“It sure is a Seven Colored Elk’s Monster Core!” Zong Ao cried in a low voice. His eyes were glued at the Monster Core, flickering with a fervoured look.

This kind of ingredient would pique any alchemist’s interest. There wasn’t any alchemist who didn’t want to use rare ingredients to refine pills, watch various ingredients refined and merged into a pill in their own hands. Every alchemist would be grateful to have a chance like this.

“Alas, this Monster Core should have been stored for a long time. A lot of its potency is lost.” Zong Ao heaved another sigh. Many alchemists nodded one after another, expressing their agreement.

Because the seven-coloured glow around the Monster Core felt a little dim, like a candle flickering in the wind that could go about at any moment.

“Yeah! Moreover... only one Monster Core was found. Even the Seven Colored Elk’s heart wasn’t found. If we had the heart, the effect would have been better with its assistance.” Ai Ou sighed continuously.

All the ingredients gathered all that was left was for the Origin King Grade Grandmaster Zuo De to arrive and refine the pill. Gu Bi Hu could be treated then.

“Senior, did Grandmaster Zuo De say when he would come?” Yang Kai asked, looking at Ai Ou.

Ai Ou forced a smile. “The message said that he will be in Water Sky City in the next few days. As for exactly when... I’ve no idea. But since so much time has already passed, I’m not in a hurry.”

He might have said this but everyone could see the impatience in his eyes.

He was a revered Second-Order Origin King Grade master, as well as the President of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce. It was always others who waited for him; when did he have to wait for others? Only an Origin King Grade Alchemist could make Ai Ou lower his head. Even if he was feeling frustrated, all he could do was cool his head and keep on waiting patiently.

“This Grandmaster sure is putting on a lot of airs.” Yang Kai chuckled.

As soon Yang Kai said this, Ai Ou couldn’t help but glanced at Yang Kai, like Yang Kai spoke what was on Ai Ou’s mind.

But right then, an inopportune voice suddenly echoed in the room, “Your Excellency, what do you mean by this? Are you accusing Grandmaster Zuo De?”

“Huh!? I’m not.” Yang Kai innocently turned his head to look at the source of the voice.

Immediately, Yang Kai saw a crooked-nosed middle-aged man wearing an Origin Grade Alchemist robe let out a cold snort and continued, looking at Yang Kai with dissatisfaction, “As an Origin King Grade Alchemist, Grandmaster Zuo De is naturally neck-deep in work. It’s natural for him to be a bit late. Your Excellency, aren’t you being disrespectful to Grandmaster by saying so?”

Yang Kai furrowed his brow. He immediately understood that this Alchemist must admire Zuo De very much, so he couldn’t bear to hear anyone speak ill of Zuo De.

He took a second look at the insignia on his robes and confirmed that this guy was an Origin Grade Mid-Rank Alchemist. Yang Kai didn’t bother to argue with him. He just chuckled and said, “This one apologizes for my slip of tongue.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Just as cultivators revered stronger masters, the same was true in Alchemist circles. An Origin Grade Alchemist was already very high up the ladder, and an Origin King Grade Alchemist was even more remarkable. There were only a few of them in the entire Star Field.

Grandmaster Zuo De had countless admirers. This hooked-nosed middle-aged man was one of them. He couldn’t tolerate the sand in his eyes, so how could he let it go. “Your Excellency might be an Origin King Realm master but slandering Grandmaster Zuo De is still a pretty big mistake, even for you. This matter cannot be put to rest just like this. Or else, it would be pretty detrimental to Grandmaster’s reputation if the word got out. Can you really afford it if it really happened?”

After having labels unjustifiably pinned on him, Yang Kai’s face immediately sank. “Then what would you like me to do?”

“Apologize! After Grandmaster Zuo De arrives, you must apologize to him!”

“Hehe!” Yang Kai let out a grim laugh. “What!? So Grandmaster Zuo’s reputation is reputation, but this King’s reputation is nothing!?”

In any case, Yang Kai claimed himself to be a Second-Order Origin King. He had identity, status, and strength. How could he apologize to an Alchemist whom he had never met just for a slip of tongue?

Yang Kai suddenly found this hook-nosed middle-aged man to be a bit ridiculous.

“How can a trivial cultivator like you compare yourself with Grandmaster!?” The hook-nosed middle-aged man wasn’t the least bit afraid of Yang Kai’s Origin King Realm identity. Rather he was looking at him contemptuously.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and threatened, “This trivial cultivator can easily take your life!”

The hook-nosed middle-aged man’s expression immediately turned to worse. He hurriedly looked to Ai Ou and spoke, horrified, “Sir President, this person is arrogant and domineering; not only did he look down on Grandmaster Zuo Debut also dared to threaten me. I ask Sir President to uphold justice!”

Yang Kai immediately said, “President Ai Ou too is a... trivial cultivator!”

The hook-nosed middle-aged man’s jaw immediately dropped.

Ai Ou pursed his lips into a smile and looked up at the sky!

The hook-nosed middle-aged man’s words made him very unhappy. He was already terribly upset because of Gu Bi Hu’s injuries. How could he pay any attention to this Mid-Rank Origin Grade Alchemist?

Not to mention, Yang Kai’s words resonated with him very much. As a matter of fact, Zuo De was already in the habit of putting on a lot of airs. Their Chamber of Commerce had bled a lot whenever they invited him to refine pills over the years.

Having noticed Ai Ou’s thoughts, the hook-nosed middle-aged man’s face turned ugly. He knew that he had gone a bit overboard just now. Not only did he scold Yang Kai but also offended Ai Ou. His intestines turned blue in regret. He still insisted, nonetheless, “So what if you can take my life!? I have no grudge with you, if you dared to do it, you will only be smearing your own name; you will be scorned by the entire world! Don’t forget, I’m an Alchemist, if you killed me, who would refine pills for you in the future!”

“Oh, I’m sorry but I too am an Alchemist!” Yang Kai smiled.

“You!?” The hook-nosed middle-aged man sneered. “I admit that you are highly talented when it comes to Martial Dao. You can fight on par with President Ai Ou without falling in a leeward position. But so what!? All your time and effort were spent on Martial Dao. You won’t have made much progress in Alchemic Dao! Even I can walk all over you with my one-hand behind my back!”

It might not have sounded pleasant but it was what was going in everyone’s mind.

Even though everyone knew Yang Kai was an Alchemist, no one believed that he had achieved much in Alchemic Dao. Even Zong Ao didn’t think that Yang Kai’s Alchemist level was much higher. After all, everyone’s energy was limited. It was already remarkable that he had achieved such a high level in Martial Dao.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but laugh and shake his head. “Forget it, I’m not wasting my words on you anymore. Think what you want!”

He truly didn’t want to squabble with someone like him.

“Hmph, don’t be so presumptuous!” Seeing Yang Kai back down, not only did the hook-nosed middle-aged man fail to restrain his arrogance but even grew even more arrogant. He thought that Yang Kai had gotten afraid of his Alchemist’s identity and didn’t dare to make any move on him. He continued, feeling even more reassured and emboldened, “We can put the matter between you and me to rest but you still have to answer for slandering Grandmaster Zuo De!”

“You are not finished yet!?” Yang Kai’s expression immediately turned colder. “Why would I need to answer you? Is Zuo De your father or grandfather? I just said that he is putting on airs and that’s all you have been going on about! Did I say anything wrong? As far as I know, President Ai Ou has already sent someone to invite him half a year ago, but he hadn’t shown up till today. If he is not putting on airs then what is it?”

Yang Kai spoke Ai Ou’s thoughts.

He might have been annoyed and frustrated by the delay shown by Zuo De, but when all was said and done, he was the one with the request. He could only keep his frustration hidden in his heart. He didn’t dare to voice it out. God knows how many times he had cursed Zuo De and his forefathers in his heart over these days.

When he heard Yang Kai, he felt a lot of his frustration vented. He found Yang Kai a lot pleasing to the eyes.

“How dare you address Grandmaster by his name directly!?” The hook-nosed man shouted in anger.

Yang Kai could not help but burst into laughter. He sneered and said, showing no respect to an Origin King Grade Alchemist that he should have, “So what if I called him by his name, isn’t he just an Origin King Grade Alchemist!?”

“You... you... you...” The hook-nosed man blew his top. His hand pointing at Yang Kai kept trembling in anger. He turned to Ai Ou and said, “Sir President, don’t you care that he is being disrespectful to Grandmaster so blatantly? If Grandmaster Zuo came to know of this, it would really make him angry.”

“Um...” Ai Ou stiffened upon hearing this. He looked at Yang Kai and requested a bit, “Friend, can you try to make their mistake sound less serious and then to reduce it to nothing at all.”

The nearby Xue Yue looked at Yang Kai imploringly as well.

They were afraid that if this matter really reached Zuo De’s ears, that old guy with his temper would take advantage of it and try to exaggerate this. He might not turn around and leave but he would surely make the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce’s bleed.

Yang Kai nodded. “Since its Senior’s request, this junior will put this matter to rest here but if someone keeps on rambling, don’t blame this junior for teaching him a lesson.”

“That’s natural.” Ai Ou nodded slightly, giving Yang Kai a glance of gratitude.

The hook-nosed man’s face turned dark as he resentfully looked at Yang Kai. He looked as if he had something to say but when he saw the sharp gleam in Yang Kai’s eyes, he didn’t dare to be anymore presumptuous. He could only add, “Just you wait! When Grandmaster Zuo De arrives, you will be in serious trouble.”

“Hmm, I’m waiting!” Yang Kai nodded.

The original amiable atmosphere had been destroyed by the hook-nosed man. It rather grew stiffer, making it a bit awkward for everyone.
