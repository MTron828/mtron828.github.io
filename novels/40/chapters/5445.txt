Yang Kai raised his brow as the next moment, a jade slip appeared before him from the Void.

He reached out to grab it and immersed his Divine Sense into it, then he breathed a long sigh of relief.

His efforts during this period were finally showing results. The remnant soldiers lurking outside of the No-Return Pass were fortunately perceptive enough. On this very day, the first of the remnant soldiers found Huang Xiong and safely converged at the meeting point.

Considering how much time had passed, it was clear that there were some smart ones among the Human survivors. They had likely noticed the hidden signs he was giving them after appearing only a few times outside of the No-Return Pass; otherwise, it would be impossible for them to find Huang Xiong and the others so quickly.

These remnant soldiers were few in number, only several dozen or so. Enough only to form a few Squads; however, this was a good start.

If there was one group of them, then there had to be a second, and a third…

However…

Yang Kai felt that he was running out of time.

He had been doing this every day for more than a month, so if he continued to do so, his true intentions would probably be exposed. The Black Ink Clan were not complete fools after all. If they were able to see through his goal and where he was pointing towards, then things would not end well.

However, there was a bright spot in all of this.

There was only a single Royal Lord standing guard at the No-Return Pass.

Yang Kai had been worried that there would be too many Royal Lords at the No-Return Pass; but now, it seemed like he had been overly concerned.

Whether it be the battle outside of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction or the battle outside of the No-Return Pass, both the Humans and the Black Ink Clan must have suffered heavy casualties.

Royal Lords and Ninth-Order Old Ancestors too, were certain to have fallen.

Yang Kai did not know the overall situation of the Human Race, but he could be sure that the strongest Masters had been whittled down in numbers, with the Black Ink Clan not being better off.

In other words, for both Races, whether it be Royal Lords or Ninth-Order Old Ancestors, their numbers won’t be high. There should be several dozen of each in the best-case scenario.

The Black Ink Clan had already breached the No-Return Pass and invaded the 3,000 Worlds, so the Humans were bound to put their lives on the line to stop them. With the Ninth-Order Old Ancestors there to suppress them, the Royal Lords would not be able to leave as they please.

Under such circumstances, how could there be several Royal Lords standing guard at the No-Return Pass?

The fact that they left a single Royal Lord here was probably only because they knew the importance of the No-Return Pass. This was the only known entrance to the 3,000 Worlds from the Black Ink Battlefield. As far as the Black Ink Clan were concerned, they couldn’t afford to lose this place now that they had taken it; after all, they had to pass through here sooner or later to return to the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction to help Mo break free from its prison.

This was good news for Yang Kai.

If there was only one Royal Lord, then he would not have too many constraints. Not to mention that he had previously collected the body of Azure Void Pass’ Old Ancestor, which he could use to face such an enemy; even without it, he still had the capital to compete with a Royal Lord for a time on his own.

In the days that followed, Yang Kai would charge the No-Return Pass and provoke the enemy every now and then, pointing the way subtly each time. Even though he had no idea how many of the Human Race soldiers left behind would understand the message, he had to keep trying.

The Black Ink Clan at the No-Return Pass grew more and more irritable. The repeated raids made them hate this Eighth Open Master greatly. Worse yet, every time they thought that they had cornered him, the Eighth-Open Human would suddenly use his strange Escape Technique and disappear without a trace, which would unfailingly result in them, the Territory Lords, being chastised by the Royal Lord who berated them for their incompetence.

The more they were scolded, the more their hatred for Yang Kai grew.

On a certain day, Yang Kai was again picking fights outside of the No-Return Pass, drawing a dozen Territory Lords over with their troops to attack him. He swept back and forth, weaving in and out of the Black Ink Clan Army but avoiding the Territory Lords, only picking on the soft persimmons, felling countless Black Ink Clansmen with his Azure Dragon Spear.

All of a sudden, he felt a shocking murderous intent explode from within a certain Black Ink Cloud.

Immediately afterwards, Yang Kai saw a familiar imposing figure emerge from it, his fiery red hair billowing behind him as he held up a huge sabre with both hands.

Peak Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm might burst out as that sabre slashed down at a nearby Territory Lord.

“Die!” At the same time, the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master howled, the large blade in his hand burst into flames, causing space itself to warp from the intense heat.

The Territory Lord who was caught by the saber light was shocked. Never in his wildest dreams would he have expected to be ambushed here.

However, it wasn’t that the Black Ink Clan hadn’t been careful, just that Yang Kai had been fighting alone for such a long time without any help, so how could they anticipate being ambushed here today?

They were not the only ones who did not expect this situation though, as even Yang Kai did not anticipate this happening.

The sudden slash was the crystallization of the lifelong cultivation of a Peak Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. What’s more, this attack had clearly been channelled and prepared for a long time, so when it struck, even a powerful Innate Territory Lord was cut in half.

Black blood spilled out and evaporated in the blazing heat left from the sabre strike.

This blow had exceeded the Eighth Order in terms of pure force, but it clearly caused an overdraft of the Master who used it, so after cutting down that Territory Lord, he froze in place, unable to move.

After the other Territory Lords recovered from their shock, how could they hold back? They all attacked this unmoving target with their Secret Techniques.

Seeing that his situation was about to become dangerous, Yang Kai swiftly retreated and put one hand on this unexpected ally’s shoulder, pulling him behind him as numerous Dao Strengths condensed onto his spear before he thrust it out.

The violent energy shook the void and blood trickled out from the corner of Yang Kai’s mouth and his body got struck.

Behind him, the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master shouted, “Yang Boy, I came to help you! Let’s kill these bastards! Kill one to break even, kill two to gain a profit!”

Yang Kai choked down the fresh blood in his mouth and said through ground teeth, “In that case, I really should thank you.”

Making use of the force of the Territory Lords’ combined blow, Yang Kai retreated quickly while suffering from a great deal of discomfort.

Fortunately, the sudden loss of one Territory Lord had frightened the other Territory Lords, so they did not dare to chase after them right away for fear that there might be other ambushers nearby, just waiting for an opening to strike.

While the enemy was distracted, Yang Kai hurriedly left.

Before he got far, another figure came out of hiding and shouted at Yang Kai from a distance, “Brother Yang, take me with you! I don’t want to be left behind here!”

Yang Kai turned back his head, feeling so aggrieved that he was about to cough up blood again; however, he had no choice but to dart over to that side and bring along the figure that suddenly appeared.

However, this delay allowed the Territory Lords to compose themselves and chase after them.

Yang Kai desperately pushed his World Force as he fled.

If he was alone, then he could easily shake off his pursuers under this situation, but now, he had to bring along an Eighth-Order Master who was practically a lamp running out of oil and could do nothing but cackle with a smug look on his face, as if killing a single Innate Territory Lord made him invincible, and another Seventh-Order Master, too. How could Yang Kai escape quickly under such circumstances?

The Territory Lords behind them were gaining on them, constantly blasting Secret Techniques out in their direction, causing Yang Kai to stagger.

He threw his hand back and pulled the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master onto his back.

The Eighth-Order Master was shocked and gasped, “Yang Boy! I’ll die like this!”

With him on Yang Kai’s back, the first one to get hit by the attacks coming from behind would be him.

Yang Kai naturally acted as if he didn’t hear him.

Behind them, as another round of the Territory Lords’ attacks were about to reach them, Space Principles undulated and the trio disappeared.

After several uses of Instantaneous Movement, Yang Kai finally escaped his pursuers, but he did not dare to stop. He continued moving forward and it wasn’t until half a day passed that he found a place to hide.

After putting the two deadweights down, Yang Kai fell to the floor and sighed.

It had been quite the thrilling trip…

The Eighth-Order Master also wanted to relax on the floor, but as soon as he touched the ground, he jumped up again. Touching his back, he found it covered in blood and hurting like hell.

He suspected that Yang Kai put him on his back on purpose so he could use him as a shield…

On the other hand, the Seventh-Order Master bowed to Yang Kai, “Many thanks, Brother Yang, for this life-saving grace.”

Yang Kai looked at him, then at the Eighth-Order Master, getting furious at once and scolding, “Brother Gong, your Master doesn’t have a brain, but are you also lacking one? Why did you jump out like that? Were you trying to save me or harm me?”

The Seventh-Order Masters was none other than Gong Lian, whom Yang Kai knew well as he was the Legacy Disciple of the Great Evolution Army’s Southern Army Commander, Ou Yang Lie.

Gong Lian was a man of great aptitude and intelligence, his only fault was his lazy nature.

When Yang Kai was in the Great Evolution Army, he had the chance to interact with Gong Lian on several occasions, but every time he saw him, this guy always had a sleepy look on his face. Even in the Main Conference Hall, during important meetings that would decide the fate of the war, Gong Liang could still sleep while leaning against a pillar.

This time was different, however, as Gong Liang was wide awake, seemingly still in shock from his life being put on the line.

After being reprimanded by Yang Kai, Gong Lian only smiled awkwardly, too embarrassed to say anything.

Next to him, Ou Yang Lie naturally wasn’t happy and glared at Yang Kai, “Smelly Brat, how can you talk like that? What do you mean this Old Master doesn’t have a brain? Look!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

He patted his own head, “Can’t you see this Old Master’s big head?”

Yang Kai looked at him and could not help but think of Xiang Shan and Mi Jing Lun.

The two Big Heads had heads filled with strategies, whereas Ou Yang Lie’s hand was probably filled with water…

Yang Kai sighed a long sigh. One should not compare people lest they anger themselves to death!

Ou Yang Lie was indignant for a while, but then he was suddenly smiling again, “Brat, when did you advance to the Eighth Order? Your cultivation speed is really a sight to behold.”

Then, he turned to Gong Lian, “Damn Disciple, why don’t you learn from him? Yang Kai didn’t even advance to the Seventh Order as early as you, but now he’s already in the Eighth Order. What about you?”

Gong Lian pursed his lips and kept silent, acting like he heard nothing.

Ou Yang Lie tossed the matter to the back of his mind after scolding him. He then turned back to Yang Kai, “If this Old Master hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, then it’s simply hard to believe what happened. Back then, this Old Master even worried about you when you were chased out of the battlefield by that Royal Lord. I wondered whether or not you’d be able to survive and there had been no news all this while. Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao was worried sick about you.”

Many people had seen Yang Kai being chased by the Royal Lord outside of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction; however, the Old Ancestors were completely powerless to help. A few Eighth-Order Masters tried to offer assistance, but Yang Kai and the sheep-headed Royal Lord were both too fast, so they were only able to chase them for a while before losing track of them, forcing them to return to the battlefield and continue their fight against the Black Ink Clan.

Everyone who saw that scene thought that Yang Kai’s fate was surely going to be bad; after all, he was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master being chased by a Royal Lord. So what if he was proficient in the Dao of Space? The gap in strength was so great that it was simply impossible for Yang Kai to escape.

However, when Ou Yang Lie saw Yang Kai again today, not only was the latter alive and well, but he even advanced to the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm. Ou Yang Lie was stunned, to say the least.
