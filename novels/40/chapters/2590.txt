Before the burly Great King’s punch, the sword aura radiating from Yang Kai’s Myriads Sword shattered into pieces. Even Yang Kai himself lost his footing and was swept up by the wind pressure generated by his punch.

“Overconfident!” The burly Great King coldly snorted, his murderous intent flaring as he punched again. This looked like a simple, straight punch, without the slightest bit of fanciness, an attack that pursued only simplicity and power.

Regarding the Stone Spirit Clan, the burly Great King still wanted to subdue them and was unwilling to fight to the death with them unless it was a last resort, but as far Yang Kai was concerned, a Human…a trivial Human was nothing. He could kill him without any scruples!

Before the punch even reached Yang Kai, he could feel a piercing sensation all over his body due to the resulting pressure.

[Can’t block it!] Yang Kai instantly judged; there was too big of a gap between their cultivations.

He had just been able to injure a Great King-level Master because he had the element of surprise on his side and because his opponent had underestimated him. Great credit also belonged to the Flowing Time Great Emperor’s Time Flies Seal. However, at this moment, the punch from the burly Great King was already upon him and he didn’t have the time to form another seal.

“Come out!” Yang Kai suddenly shouted, while at the same time, hurriedly retreating.

The next moment, an enormous stone giant appeared. This stone giant bore startling resemblance with the Stone Spirit Clan, but rather than raw aggression in its eyes, there was a sliver of shrewdness instead.

The Embodiment!

As soon as he appeared, the Embodiment swung his first, punching forward.

Before the blow of the burly Great King could even land on Yang Kai, a Stone Spirit had mysteriously appeared between them, causing the former’s brow to twitch and even causing him to question if his eyes were playing tricks on him.

But when he saw the oncoming punch, he knew this was no illusion.

It was too late to withdraw, so he could only grit his teeth and meet the Embodiment’s punch with his own.

*Hong…*

A deafening explosion reverberated, and in the aftermath, the Embodiment staggered back two steps while the burly Great King let out a groan as faint sounds of bones cracking came from his wrist before he was sent flying like a rag sack.

The six other Great Kings, who were watching from afar, were also dumbfounded at the sight of this.

They stood rooted on the spot, as if petrified. Their response was a little sluggish as if they had lost their wits. They were unable to accept the reality of this situation at all.

On the surface, the Human, who seemed the weakest, actually forced a Monster King to back away, then injured two Great Kings. Although the burly Great King wasn’t personally injured by him, the result of the battle was still shocking.

What the Monster Race Masters were unable to fathom though was where this Stone Spirit came from.

[Can’t the Stone Spirit Clan have no more than ten members? Wouldn’t a Stone Spirit born after there are already ten of them die prematurely? Counting this last Stone Spirit, the Stone Spirit Clan already has eleven clansmen! This has broken the myth that no more than ten Stone Spirits may walk the world at once.]

[This is horrible! If the Stone Spirit Clan can have more than ten members, which clan will be able to fight against them? These guys are crazy about fighting and each one of them is extremely terrifying once they fully mature!]

“Go and help them!” Yang Kai flew up and landed on the Embodiment’s shoulder, saying in a low voice as he turned his head and looked in Stone Spirit Clan’s direction. At the same time, he stretched his hand in a certain direction and opened his palm, as if he was summoning something to him.

Things weren’t looking good for the Stone Spirit Clan. Even if they were naturally born fighters, even if they didn’t know the meaning of exhaustion, even if they had endless strength, even if their bodies were extremely robust and sturdy, against Monster Kings three times their numbers, they would still be stretched and hard-pressed to hold their ground.

One by one, the Stone Spirits seemed to have gone mad. They wantonly punched left and right, but they were completely powerless against the strong and vigorous Monster Kings. On the contrary, the Monster Kings spread out and attacked them from multiple directions, leaving them with no choice but to chase their opponents while defending themselves.

Basically, every Stone Spirit was fighting three Monster Kings, but these Monster Kings were extremely cunning. They had divided their tasks and were cooperating with each other. Two of them would cooperate on the ground to contain the Stone Spirit’s attacks and movements, while the last one would hover up above and look for opportunities to send out devastating attacks.

The Stone Spirits might not have to worry about their lives for the time being, but if things went on like this, it was only a matter of time before they were suppressed.

Elder was obviously aware of this and a look of determination flashed across his eyes as he shouted, “Mu Na, assist me!”

Just as he said this, colourful rays of light suddenly emerged from his back. These rays of light gathered and stretched behind him, forming a pair of radiant wings.

Yang Kai stared in a daze for a moment, finally realizing how the Wood Spirits would provide help in this situation. These radiant wings should be the auxiliary support the Wood Spirits could give to the Stone Spirit Clan.

[No wonder I didn’t see any of the Wood Spirits when I summoned the Stone Spirits. No wonder the Wood Spirits joined us before we set off. It turns out that the two clans really share a symbiotic relationship that goes beyond simply sheltering and supporting one another.]

The biggest drawback the Stone Spirit Clan faced was that they couldn’t fly; it was related to their body structure, but the Wood Spirit Clan could give the Stone Spirits this ability.

*Shua shua shua…*

A pair of radiant wings suddenly emerged behind each Stone Spirit. As those wings fluttered, the Stone Spirits’ movements became nimbler and more flexible. It seemed as if these wings were natural extensions of their bodies, without the slightest bit of discord between them.

The Monster Kings’ faces sank as they rose into the air one after another, flanking back and forth, surrounding the Stone Spirits. By the looks of their stance, it seemed that they wouldn’t let them break through their line of defence.

The Great Kings watching the battle couldn’t sit still anymore when they saw this scene, their figures also rising up to help.

For a moment, the world lost its colour while the sun and moon lost their radiance. A terrifying and dazzling battle broke out mid-air as the collisions between various Principles and raw strength seemed like it would shatter and tear this stretch of the world asunder.

“What are you going to do?” Yang Kai’s face turned black as he asked, looking at his Embodiment. The battlefield had suddenly shifted to the sky, so the Embodiment couldn’t provide any assistance at all.

The Embodiment pursed his lips and stated, “I also have the assistance of the Wood Spirits.”

*Shua Shua…*

Suddenly, rays of light emerged behind him as a pair of wings stretched from his back. After rising from the ground, he shot straight into the air.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, realizing that his Embodiment had formed an agreement with the Wood Spirit before. He couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief as he then swung the Myriads Sword forward and sternly shouted, “Kill!”

…..

A few thousand kilometres away from the Blood Gate, four figures were rushing back towards it as swiftly as the wind. At their current pace, it would not take them long to reach the battlefield.

Each of these four figures was radiating a fearsome aura, one that seemed as vast and deep as the sea. They were none other than the four Divine Venerables of the Ancient Lands.

After having received Xie Wu Wei’s report, they had gone to investigate the appearance of the Mountains and Rivers Bell. When they arrived, they indeed found the Mountains and Rivers Bell, but unfortunately, no matter what they did, they were unable to collect it, let alone bring it away with them. The bell sat in a mountain valley, completely still, and none had any idea why it appeared there seemingly out of thin air.

The four Divine Venerables dared not underestimate the bell’s power to suppress Heaven and Earth.

Just when the four Divine Venerables were feeling helpless and frustrated, they suddenly noticed abnormal movements at the Blood Gate.

The distance of three thousand kilometres was not close, but it wasn’t far either. The perception of the four Divine Venerabeles was extremely keen while the battle at the Blood Gate was extraordinarily fierce, so it couldn’t remain hidden from their senses.

In a flash, the four knew that they had been lured into a trap.

Without a moment of hesitation, they immediately hurried back to the Blood Gate; after all, the Mountains and Rivers Bell couldn’t run away from here while there was room for mistakes at the Blood Gate.

Before they could rush back to the Blood Gate though, they felt a fearsome and shocking aura emerge from behind them. This aura was spreading over and actually made them have a feeling of suppression.

“The Mountains and Rivers Bell!” Cang Guo abruptly turned his head before his figure came to an immediate stop. As expected, he saw a streak of light rushing over, reaching them in the blink of an eye.

Luan Feng, Fan Wu, and Shi Huo all had their faces drastically change as they dared not confront it head-on and hurriedly scattered to the sides.

*Xiu…*

The Mountains and Rivers Bell directly flew between the four Divine Venerables and shot straight ahead before disappearing from their sight in the blink of an eye.

“What’s going on?” Fear could be seen lingering on Shi Huo’s face. He thought that someone was going to use the Mountains and Rivers Bell to suppress them and was so frightened he almost used his Source Strength to attack.

But the Mountains and Rivers Bell actually flew straight ahead, ignoring them entirely. It was really confusing.

The other three Divine Venerables also looked confused.

Suddenly, something seemed to have clicked for Fan Wu and his face turned ashen and cold as he grit his teeth and stated, “The Mountains and Rivers Bell actually has a Master!”

Luan Feng’s pretty eyes were also filled with shock as she confirmed again, “You mean to say… its Master just summoned it?”

Fan Wu replied with a cold snort, “What other explanation could there be?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Cang Guo’s face turned unsightly as he looked towards the Blood Gate and bitterly said, “Whoever it is that subdued the Mountains and Rivers Bell actually used it as bait to interfere with our business!”

Fan Wu added, “No matter who it is, his goal is definitely the Blood Gate. Let’s go!”

After having finished, he hurriedly shot off.

Luan Feng, Cang Guo, and Shi Huo glanced at each other before they hurriedly followed after him.

Several dozen kilometres behind them, Xie Wu Wei had a bitter look on his face as he saw the four Divine Venerables pick up their pace. His speed wasn’t as good as theirs, so he could only chase after them while eating their dust. Just now, when the Mountains and Rivers Bell flew over, he had seen it and naturally knew this was Yang Kai’s handiwork.

Deep down in his heart, he was already raining down curses on Yang Kai, but he also had no choice but to pray for his safety.

Now, he was Yang Kai’s Soul Slave, so once Yang Kai died, he would definitely die along with him.

“Little brat, you better not have an accident and leave as soon as possible. The Divine Venerables are already returning,” Xie Wu Wei muttered under his breath.

At the Blood Gate, the crowd of Monster Race Masters were locked in a heated battle, with the Stone Spirits rushing left and right in a chaotic fashion. Nonetheless, they were unable to break through the line of defence and were trapped in this place.

In the end, the difference in numbers was too great, and with all the Monster Kings not holding back, the Stone Spirits were basically unable to escape.

At this moment, a streak of light suddenly came from nearby. Judging by its direction, it came from the centre of the battlefield.

The streak of light seemed to contain a terrifying aura. Wherever it passed through, the world started shaking.

“Human, go to hell!” The burly Great King, who was injured by the Embodiment, shouted as an enormous illusory phantom of a giant tiger appeared behind him, biting down at Yang Kai the next moment.

Having suffered a huge blow at Embodiment’s hands, he didn’t dare to get close and instead focused on killing this brat first.

At this moment, the Embodiment was blocked by another Monster King and was unable to support Yang Kai at all. Seeing the illusory enormous tiger pouncing at him, glaring, roaring and baring fangs at Yang Kai, the Embodiment instantly released the Heaven Devouring Domain, violently draining his opponent Monster King’s vitality.
