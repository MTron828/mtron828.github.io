Chapter 6008: World Creation

An enormous river stretched across the void, its waters fiercely surging, with waves rising and falling one after another.

Yang Kai was sitting in a cross-legged position over this enormous river, forming a set of profound hand seals. As his hands moved, the water in the river would cycle through states of agitation and calm.

The myriad of Daos Strengths would also undulate with the current in the river.

It had been several years since Yang Kai returned from the Taboo Realm.

Whenever he recalled his absurd experiences over the past few years, Yang Kai didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

On the day, when he finally returned from the Taboo Realm, all his relatives came to meet him tearfully, complaining about their pain of parting. Soon after, everyone returned to the Star Boundary together, and after learning of the news of his return, all rejoiced.

In the 8,000 years after Yang Kai’s disappearance, all their memories about him had been erased, but the moment he returned, all the vanished memories were restored. No one knew what extraordinary power could cause something like this.

Only Yang Kai seemed to notice something.

After that, Yang Kai was placed under house arrest!

He, a mighty expert who had surpassed the Open Heaven Realm, who had reached an unprecedented Realm never seen before, who could call the wind and rain with just the flip of his hand, had actually been placed under house arrest!

The ones who put him under house arrest were none other than Yang Ying Feng and Dong Su Zhu!

His Wives were also under house arrest like him.

According to his parents, they were growing old. It was already a miracle that they had been able to give birth to Yang Xue in the past, but there was no way for them to have any more children. So, the responsibility of continuing the Yang Family’s bloodline fell squarely on Yang Kai’s shoulders!

The old couple didn’t make any outrageous demands, just that he should father as many children as the number of Wives he had. So, each of his Wives should give birth to at least one child. When this condition had been fulfilled, they would release them.

In terms of strength, his parents were naturally not Yang Kai’s opponents and he could easily escape if he really wanted to; however, his parents had also said that if their unfilial son dared to disobey them this time, they would bash their heads against High Heaven Peak until they died!

Yang Kai was left with no choice!

According to his parents, Yang Kai had been cultivating for many years and had explored many worlds, big and small. He had been constantly on the move. But now that the world was at peace and his cultivation had already reached the limit, there was nothing he needed to worry about in this world. As such, he should pay attention to continuing the Yang Family’s bloodline!

Helpless, Yang Kai, Su Yan, Yu Ru Meng, and the others were locked up on a lone peak in High Heaven Palace.

It wasn’t until several years later that Yang Kai walked out of the mountain peak with a tired look on his face, his eyes sunken and his face pale. Right behind him was a large group of beautiful women with big bellies.

Yang Ying Feng and Dong Su Zhu were overjoyed. As the saying went, ‘people need to be pushed to get results!’ In the past, they had tried to make Yang Kai continue their bloodline, but he had always brushed them off with all kinds of excuses. If they had known it would be this simple, they would have put him under house arrest long ago!

After having completed this vital mission, Yang Kai finally had time to catch up with his old friends.

Mi Jing Lun and the others were naturally aware of what was going on with Yang Kai over these past few years; so, they could not help but tease him when they finally met up.

Soon, Yang Kai learned about the current situation of the Human Race from the other Ninth-Order Masters.

With the end of the war more than 8,000 years ago, the Black Ink Clan was completely wiped out, and the Universe had finally achieved a state of peace. Now, the Human Race were the sole rulers of the world.

Be that as it may, the scars of countless years of war were difficult to erase.

The 3,000 Worlds used to be extremely prosperous, but now, apart from those in High Heaven Territory and Myriad Monsters Territory, the Universe Worlds in the rest of Great Territories had either been completely corrupted by Black Ink Strength or had long since been destroyed.

It could be said that the habitable space for the Human Race had been greatly reduced.

Originally, traces of Human activity could be seen in every Great Territory, but now, all the surviving Humans were gathered in High Heaven Territory and Myriad Monsters Territory, with more than 90% of them living in the latter.

In fact, because of the scarcity of cultivation resources, the two Open Heaven Realm Cradles, the Star Boundary and Myriad Monsters World, had essentially been evacuated and cordoned off. The Human Race didn’t dare let too many people live in these two Open Heaven Realm Cradles, lest too many good seedlings were born and there were no resources to nurture them!

If the number of people suitable for cultivation increased, but there were no resources for them to cultivate with, fights over cultivation resources would definitely break out, which would ultimately lead to chaos.

Currently, the population living on the Star Boundary and Myriad Monsters World was extremely small, and if one wanted to enter these two Open Heaven Realm Cradles, they would need to undergo a rigorous series of tests and selections.

This was the current state of the Human Race; they had won the war, but it was a pyrrhic victory.

Nonetheless, they could not do anything about it. The Black Ink Clan had simply done too much damage to the 3,000 Worlds.

In addition, the Human Race didn’t have the means to repair these corrupted Universe Worlds. If no solution was found, the Human Race would have many dark days ahead of them.

Fortunately, Yang Kai had returned from the Taboo Realm, and at this moment, he was repairing a Universe World.

This was an uninhabited Great Territory. Perhaps this Great Territory once used to be bustling with Human activity, with its Universe Worlds being rich and prosperous; however, after the Black Ink Clan occupation, all that was left was deathly silence, and all the Universe Worlds had died.

The massive Space-Time River stretched across the void, with Universe Worlds floating up and down in the river, Daos Strengths fluctuating rhythmically.

The Black Ink Strength that had corrupted these Universe Worlds was quickly stripped away and then sent into the Profound Source Gate by Yang Kai to be sealed. After that, Yang Kai evolved Yin and Yang, then harmonized the Five Elements, which gave birth to the 10,000 Grand Daos.

The flow of time in the Space-Time River was different from the outside world, and with Yang Kai’s current cultivation, this flow rate had reached an extremely exaggerated degree.

Perhaps 1,000 years were elapsing inside the river for each breath that passed in the outside world…

The lifeless Universe World slowly regained its vitality in the Space-Time River.

Suddenly, a small figure stepped out and walked over to Yang Kai’s side before pursing his lips in frustration, “It’s empty outside, there’s nothing here, so boring.”

Yang Kai fiercely turned to him and shot him a glare, “It’s all your fault!”

The figure immediately tried to explain, “What does Mo’s evil deeds have to do with this Little Eleven?”

The small figure standing next to Yang Kai at this moment was none other than ‘Little Eleven’, or rather, it was the same person Yang Kai had seen in the Primordial World’s Dawn City.

8,000 years ago, Yang Kai defeated Mo and sealed it with the Profound Source Gate; however, as the most ancient being in this Universe, even Yang Kai was unable to completely destroy Mo.

After all, Black Ink Strength was a power born at the beginning of the Universe. As long as the Universe still existed, and as long as there was darkness in living beings, Black Ink Strength would never be extinguished.

However, Yang Kai spent some effort to extract the consciousness born from this power from the Profound Source Gate.

This consciousness was Little Eleven, who was standing beside him.

Strictly speaking, Mo was Little Eleven, but these two were different.

In other words, Little Eleven was not making excuses, he was indeed not Mo. During the Early Ancient Era, he had fought alongside the 10 Martial Ancestors to protect the Human Race.

Only Mu had noticed the problem in Mo at the time. She had set up the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction and sealed Mo before its consciousness was completely corrupted.

Afterwards, under Mu’s secret arrangements, Mo’s Source was divided into 3,000 pieces and sealed in different Universe Worlds while Mu kept Mo’s consciousness by her side to guard him.

Unlike what Mu did, the current Little Eleven was not some weak child in Dawn City who did not even have the strength to strangle a chicken; otherwise, he would not have been able to wander the void alone.

Looking at the surging river stretching across the void before him, Little Eleven couldn’t help wondering, “Speaking of which, what Realm are you in now?”

Little Eleven was completely unaware of the fact that Yang Kai was trapped in the Taboo Realm, as Mo was sealed by Yang Kai after his defeat, and Little Eleven was freed just a few days ago. However, Little Elven was surprised to discover that Yang Kai’s strength was far greater than the last time Mo fought with him. It seemed to have gone beyond the scope of the Open Heaven Realm.

Little Eleven reckoned that even if Mo had been at his peak, he would still be no match for the current Yang Kai.

“You’re supposed to be a Master in the Creation Realm, can’t you see through my cultivation?” Yang Kai asked instead of answering.

Little Eleven explained, shaking his head, “That’s a false claim. Mo never reached the Creation Realm. He could at most be described as a Pseudo-Creation Realm Master. The main reason Mo was able to create the Black Ink Clan is because of the unique properties of Black Ink Strength, not because Mo had reached the necessary realm; but you, you’re different. Your current cultivation has indeed exceeded the Open Heaven Realm, so I’m very curious about what Realm you’ve reached.”

Yang Kai had already noticed that there was something wrong with Mo’s ‘Creation Realm’ a long time ago, but at that time, his strength and vision were simply insufficient; as such, he was unable to determine anything.

Now that Little Eleven had personally admitted it, Yang Kai wasn’t too surprised.

“My Realm…” Yang Kai muttered before shaking his head, “No one has reached this Realm before, so I don’t know what it should be called.”

Saying so, he quickly changed his hand seals before raising them towards the Space-Time River, making a grabbing motion.

The next moment, the enormous river was gripped by Yang Kai, who gently shook it and shouted, “Go!”

Immediately after, tiny grains of sand were flung out from the Space-Time River one after another and began rapidly expanding. Surprisingly, these grains were Universe Worlds.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

These Universe Worlds were the remaining Universe Worlds of this Great Territory. Originally, they had been corrupted by Black Ink Strength and were devoid of any life. Some were even destroyed by the Black Ink Clan’s resource exploitation.

But now, all these Universe Worlds had completely changed. Although there were no sentient beings on them, each of these Universe Worlds looked completely new, without a trace of Black Ink Strength left on them. The dilapidated Universe Worlds had been repaired and were filled with perfect Grand Daos. Furthermore, each of these Universe Worlds was lush and green, full of life and vigour.

These Universe Worlds were already teeming with vitality, so they would give birth to their first life forms in just a few years.

Even with Little Eleven’s vast experience, he was still shocked by this amazing sight.

The Universe Worlds were not artifacts, nor were they pieces of furniture; they were not something that could be repaired so easily. However, these devastated Universe Worlds had been brought back to life by Yang Kai. This was not something a normal Human could do.

“Creating something out of nothing, a Divine Ability to create a new world, truly amazing,” looking at the Universe Worlds flying out into the void and slowly coming to a stop at certain spots, Little Eleven couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. He felt that his sins had been significantly reduced.

Hearing this, Yang Kai raised his brow as a smile flashed on his face, “Then let’s call it the World Creation Realm.”

“Huh?” Little Eleven was stunned, but quickly recovered and muttered, “The World Creation Realm… it’s quite appropriate.”

In the past, the Universe Furnace created all Worlds, but now, Yang Kai’s Space-Time River was also able to create Universe Worlds.

The Space-Time River itself was modelled after the Infinite River inside the Universe Furnace, and the Infinite River was the foundation of the entire Universe Furnace. All the Universe Worlds in this Universe had been created by the Infinite River. Yang Kai felt that his own Space-Time River would reach the level of the Infinite River sooner or later.

“Let’s go to the next place.” Yang Kai stood up and rushed towards the adjacent Great Territory, with Little Eleven following closely behind him.
