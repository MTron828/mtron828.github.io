“How improper!” Yang Kai quickly stepped forward and took a blanket from the side to cover the Proprietress’ legs.

The Proprietress looked at him but did not stop him. She smilingly asked, “Why do you have the time to come running here to me now? How is Void Land?”

“It’s doing well!” He walked over to a table by the side and sat down. Taking out a teapot and a teacup, he poured himself a cup before continuing, “The Defensive Grand Array has been completed and it’s all thanks to the excellent Spirit Array Grandmaster that you recommended to me, Proprietress.”

“Didn’t you keep Grandmaster Wu Liang by your side?” She asked.

To which he shook his head, “The Grandmaster refused. Moreover, he claimed that his breakthrough was imminent so he immediately left to find a place to enter retreat after the Grand Array was completed.”

The Proprietress nodded at his words, “Grandmaster Wu Liang has very high attainments in the Dao of Spirit Arrays, but he is used to living a carefree life. It will not be an easy feat for you to win him over, but that is not an urgent matter. You will have more chances in the future. It will benefit you greatly if you can persuade Grandmaster Wu Liang to remain in Void Land.”

Yang Kai took a sip of tea and sighed, “I fear he isn’t interested in such a small Sect.”

Proprietress laughed at his words, “Void Land might be on the weaker side right now, but it will definitely expand greatly over time.”

“That’s for the future. Let’s not talk about this. I came here today to ask you about something.”

“Speak!”

Yang Kai’s expression turned serious, “I used to be all alone. There was no need to worry about feeding my family, but now there are many people in Void Land. How can I achieve long-term stability and obtain the various resources needed for the disciples’ cultivation needs? I can’t just do nothing and squander away my fortune. If I continue at this rate, I will exhaust all my resources one day soon.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Upon hearing what he mentioned, she replied, “The predecessor of Void Land, Seven Wonders Land, has unique geographical conditions. You can just plant all seven kinds of spirit fruits in the seven areas and use them to refine Open Heaven Pills.”

“I was thinking so too.” Yang Kai nodded and continued, “But, Proprietress, you know what kind of situation I am in. Void Land only has the Alchemy ingredients but not the pill recipe for Open Heaven Pills. Do you happen to have it?”

“Of course I have a pill recipe. In fact, I have more than one.” She looked at him with a smile, “Forget it. I’ll sort them out and hand them to you later. There might be countless pill recipes for Open Heaven Pills in the 3,000 Worlds, but most of them are pretty similar. You can bring them back and research for yourself to see which recipe is most suitable for your use.”

Yang Kai was immediately overjoyed, “Many thanks, Proprietress!” [I knew the Proprietress would have the pill recipe. I’m glad this trip was not in vain.]

“Aside from refining Open Heaven Pills, I suggest that you take control of the Star City as soon as possible. The existence of the Star City is extremely important to any great force. You can even say that it is their foundation. Only by taking control of the Star City can you obtain a steady stream of resources and income.”

“I’m already working on taking control of the Star City. I believe that I will have Void Territory’s Star City at my disposal after I return from this trip.”

She smiled, “You sure work fast. With both of these ventures in hand, you can basically guarantee the cultivation resources for all of Void Land’s disciples. Why are you still so worried?”

Yang Kai muttered awkwardly, “There are many people in Void Land. I’m afraid just these two businesses alone won’t be enough.”

She became curious, “Many? How many is ‘many’?”

The number that came out of Yang Kai’s mouth left her stunned for a moment. She had never heard of any Second-Class force with so many people before. Thus, she frowned slightly, “You might have a lot of people, but they won’t consume many resources as long as they do not condense their Dao Seals. What is there to worry about?”

Yang Kai simply laughed, “I have to plan ahead, right?”

She pondered for a moment before asking, “Void Land must have taken control over several Universe Worlds, yes?”

“That’s right.” Yang Kai nodded. These Universe Worlds were previously controlled by Seven Wonders Land so now that Void Land had replaced Seven Wonders Land, it was only natural for Void Land to take over their management as well.

The Proprietress thus proposed, “You also came out of a Universe World, so you should not be unfamiliar with them. But, even if you’ve broken free of your Universe World, you should not underestimate them. Each Universe World might contain cultivation resources of various Orders… It’s not a maybe. It’s a certainty. It’s just a matter of the quantity and how high the Order of these cultivation resources is. Controlling these Universe Worlds is equivalent to controlling all sorts of cultivation resources. It can even be said that Mid-Rank and High-Rank materials are obtained from these Universe Worlds. Do you remember the Nine Nether Continent you once visited? I’ve found many Fifth-Order materials and even Sixth-Order materials there over the years.

“I tend to hear similar news from time to time after being in the Outer Universe for such a long time. For example, somebody would obtain a High-Order material from an unowned Universe World. That would attract countless people to investigate those Universe Worlds.”

Yang Kai’s heart pounded at those words and he couldn’t help thinking about the Immortal Tree. Strictly speaking, the Immortal Tree was something he obtained from one of the Sealed Worlds in one of the Lower Star Fields. Even a mere Lower Star Field could produce such a High-Order treasure, what more an entire Universe World?

Then, he couldn’t help thinking about the Star Boundary. The Star Boundary had produced many cultivation resources needed by Open Heaven Realm Masters, it was just that no Open Heaven Realm Master had ever come from the Star Boundary before, so nobody knew the worth of those items even if they existed.

At present, Void Territory controlled more than a dozen Universe Worlds, each one equivalent to the Star Boundary. As long as he could develop them properly, there was no need to fear not having enough cultivation resources.

Yang Kai suddenly felt as though he had been enlightened!

“Although there are many people in Void Land, the cultivation resources that they need are not that many yet. As long as you take control of the Star City, refine your own Open Heaven Pills, and carefully harvest resources from those Universe Worlds, you should have enough to develop steadily.” The Proprietress taught him earnestly, “You can also plant some spirit flowers and unique plants in Void Land. You can even develop some of the land in those Universe Worlds for farming. In doing so, it will be an income whether you refine them into Spirit Pills or sell them as raw materials.”

“I understand.” Yang Kai nodded solemnly. Since he brought 600,000 people to Void Land, he had constantly been thinking about the future. In particular, the matter regarding cultivation resources had been weighing down on him like a huge mountain. It wasn’t until this moment that he finally felt a sense of relief.

He then changed the topic of conversation abruptly, “There is one more thing I wanted to ask you, Proprietress.”

“Let’s hear it.”

Yang Kai laughed softly, “Proprietress, you know about my current situation. I have condensed four Element Powers, but I still lack Yin, Yang, and Metal. It’s just that High-Rank materials are not easy to find. What I want to ask is, do you have any information about where I can find High-Rank materials for these three Elements?”

The Proprietress opened her eyes wide at those words and stared at him fixedly. A long time passed before she asked, “Are you still planning to achieve the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm?”

Yang Kai quickly replied, “The going is the toughest towards the end of a journey, but I’ve already come so far so I don’t intend to give up halfway.”

“No matter how much resistance you might face in the future?”

“We’ll talk about the future when the future comes.”

She sighed softly, “Since you have already made up your mind, I won’t stop you. I just hope you will not regret your decision in the future. Be that as it may, High-Rank materials are truly hard to find. Even if these materials appear occasionally, they tend to attract a lot of attention and thus have countless Masters competing for them. With your current strength, there’s no way for you to even enter such a struggle.”

“I am well aware of this point.” Yang Kai nodded sincerely. When the Golden Crow Divine Palace appeared, it had attracted several High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters and dozens of Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters to First Inn. One could only imagine how tempting these High-Rank materials were to those Masters.

At first, Yang Kai had not understood the reason why they were competing for these materials. If it was for the sake of their Disciples, then wasn’t it strange for so many Masters to have Disciples that could directly refine Seventh-Order materials?

He later learned that these Masters were vying for the Golden Crow carcass for their own sake. They could absorb and refine the Fire Element Power from the Golden Crow carcass to enhance the heritage of their Small Universes, thereby improving their own strength.

Still, Yang Kai grinned, “But, what First Inn does best is to collect information. I’m sure you know about secrets that other people don’t know, like… where I could possibly find High-Rank materials for these three Elements.”

The Proprietress gave him a glare that was a mix of anger and amusement as she quipped, “What do you think High-Rank materials are? Cabbages that can be found everywhere? I don’t mind telling you. I do know where you can find the High-Rank Yin and Yang materials, but you definitely don’t have the ability to obtain them.”

“Where is that?” Yang Kai’s eyes suddenly blazed with excitement.

She glared at him even more harshly before she took out her Universe Chart, tapped it with her finger, and tossed it to him, “Take a look yourself.”

Yang Kai poured his Divine Sense into the Universe Chart and couldn’t help feeling stunned, “What is the situation with these Great Territories?”

He discovered that the Great Territories she marked were different from other Great Territories. They were completely empty. Normally, one could clearly see the great forces or Universe Worlds that existed in a particular Great Territory, but these few Great Territories were completely devoid of anything at all.

The Proprietress explained leisurely, “Tens and hundreds of thousands of years ago, these Great Territories indeed contained many great forces and Universe Worlds. But, they are all gone now.”

...

“Who could possibly do that?” He felt his scalp tingling from fear. All the great forces and Universe Worlds in several Great Territories had been completely wiped from existence. What kind of violent force could accomplish that?

“Sun’s Burning Light, Moon’s Serene Glimmer!” The Proprietress replied casually.

Yang Kai was taken aback by her words. Then, he immediately took a deep breath and asked in a trembling voice, “Do those two Divine Beasts really exist?”

According to legend, at the beginning of the universe, two strands of Chaotic Qi transformed into Yin and Yang, these two wisps evolved into the Sun’s Burning Light and Moon’s Serene Glimmer in the most primordial of ages. These two were the oldest Divine Spirits in existence. It was from them that all Divine Spirits like the Dragons and Phoenixes came to be. It could be said that the Sun’s Burning Light and Moon’s Serene Glimmer were the progenitors of all Divine Spirits, their one set of common ancestors.

Yang Kai once read the Divine Spirit Record, in which all the known Divine Spirits in the 3,000 Worlds were listed. The Divine Spirit Record listed the Dragon and Phoenix Clans at the top of the list. However, it started with an introduction to the Sun’s Burning Light and Moon’s Serene Glimmer. It was just that the author of this Record who wrote about the Divine Spirits, believed that these two Divine Beings no longer existed.

Who would have guessed that he would learn about these two horrifying existences from the Proprietress!? They were Divine Beasts that stood above the Dragons and Phoenixes, symbols of invincibility! If there were any beings in the universe that could compete against the Giant Spirit God Clan, then the Sun’s Burning Light and Moon’s Serene Glimmer would definitely be among them. It could even be said that they were stronger than the Giant Spirit Gods.

Silavin: Sun’s Burning Light and the Moon’s Serene Glimmer. Honestly, I wanted to give them Chinese names as well.

Tai Yang Zhuo Zhao and Tai Yin You Ying, but it sorta seems ridiculous…
