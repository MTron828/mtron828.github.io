“Everyone, do you want to go deeper and have a look? The Source Strength inside is extremely rich and pure. It would be of great benefit to your cultivation if you could absorb and refine it there,” Yang Kai hurriedly proposed after seeing the tension in the atmosphere had eased slightly.

Lan Xun nodded, “I’m going to take a look. If Senior Brother Yang doesn’t mind, why don’t we travel together?”

Since she asked, Yang Kai did not reject and nodded, “It is my honour to be invited by the Princess.”

Lan Xun smiled faintly, “Senior Brother Yang can just address Lan Xun like how you address Little Sister Xiao Qi. You may omit the word ‘Princess’.”

The last time when she met Yang Kai in the Four Seasons Realm, she already felt that this person was extremely special, and now that seemed to be the case. Although Yang Kai had only a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation and lagged behind Xiao Chen and other elites from their generation, Lan Xun had a feeling that Yang Kai’s future achievements would definitely be much greater than Xiao Chen’s.

Unlike the inexperienced Mo Xiao Qi, Lan Xun had keen insight and foresight.

Immediately, they departed towards the depths of Source Sea in a group.

Not long after their departure, there was a sudden exclamation from the front, followed closely by a bright glowing orb gradually rising from the Source Sea, like a radiant moon.

A clear wave of Source Strength spread out from this orb.

“Star Source!” Xiao Chen exclaimed.

Yang Kai also shouted with his eyes glowing, “A complete Star Source!”

Yang Kai had not seen a complete Star Source throughout his time in the Shattered Star Sea. Although he had absorbed and refined a lot of Source Strength during these past few years, all of that was from Shattered Star Sources. Even though this was still useful to him, it was undoubtedly incomparable to a complete Star Source.

When Yang Kai first came to the Source Sea, he heard that complete Star Sources could be found here.

But he did not expect to really see one.

Even the daughter of a Great Emperor like Lan Xun started to breathe rapidly at the appearance of this complete Star Source, revealing a look of excitement on her pretty face which showed just how attractive this thing was to cultivators.

Before Yang Kai and the others were able to react, countless cultivators flew past them from all directions, focusing on the complete Star Source, soon engaging in a tangled, bloody melee as they competed for this prize.

In just five breaths of time, more than twenty cultivators screamed and fell from the sky, dropping into the Source Sea.

In the span of five breaths, the complete Star Source abruptly disappeared and no one had any idea who snatched it. The remaining people were infuriated and started cursing.

“There really are complete Star Sources here,” Yang Kai witnessed the whole scene from the beginning to end and could not help sighing.

“The Source Sea is really an exceptional place. No one knows how it was formed or why it contains so much Source Strength; however, there has been a rumour about the Source Sea since long ago that only a few people know,” Lan Xun spoke with a solemn face.

“What rumour?” Yang Kai looked at her in surprise.

She was the daughter of the Bright Moon Great Emperor and should be knowledgeable about most of the things in this world. Yang Kai had always been puzzled by the existence of the Source Sea, so now that Lan Xun mentioned it, he could not help feeling excited to hear about it.

Xiao Chen gave Lan Xun an inquiring look too; obviously, he did not know about this rumour she spoke of.

Lan Xun did not answer right away, but turned to Mo Xiao Qi, “About this rumour, Little Sister Xiao Qi should have heard it from Sir Martial Beast, right?”

Mo Xiao Qi’s face turned unusually solemn as she nodded, “Before coming to the Shattered Star Sea, Lord Father did tell me one thing. He mentioned that the formation of the Source Sea has some direct relation to that fallen Sir who was besieged and killed here.”

“What?” Yang Kai and Xiao Chen were taken aback simultaneously.

Although Mo Xiao Qi did not directly name the fallen Sir, everyone knew who she was speaking of.

The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor!

Who else other than him?

Lan Xun further explained, “Back then, that Sir could not be restrained in the Star Boundary as no one could match him, so he acted unscrupulously. He even broke through the World Barrier and travelled to the Lower Star Fields. Wherever he passed, Star Fields were destroyed and Stars were shattered while all the Star Sources of those Cultivation Stars were devoured by him. The number of Star Fields that were devastated by his hands alone was no less than a dozen, so one can imagine how many Star Sources he consumed. After the War of Emperors in the Shattered Star Sea, he was killed and the Source Strength that he devoured remained here strangely after his death, forming this vast Source Sea.”

“Such a thing occurred?” Xiao Chen rounded his eyes, as if he could not believe it.

Yang Kai’s face also turned pale when he heard this and asked in astonishment, “So, the Source Sea is actually the resting place of that Sir?”

Lan Xun nodded her head, “It can be said so, but the location of the Source Sea is random, and it does not always appear when the Shattered Star Sea opens, so no one actually knows if this is really where that Sir fell. However, we do know that the formation of the Source Sea must be directly related to him.”

“No wonder there is so much Shattered Source Strength and even complete Star Sources here,” Yang Kai sighed, his doubts from all these days cleared up at once.

Previously he was still wondering how a broken place like the Shattered Star Sea could form such a peculiar existence like the Source Sea, but now he understood after listening to Lan Xun’s explanation.

The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor devoured untold amounts of Source Strength, but that Source Strength remained after his death and formed the Source Sea.

In other words, everyone was now enjoying the legacy of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor.

Lan Xun smiled slightly, “It is also precisely because of the wanton behaviour of that Sir back then that the passages to the Lower Star Fields were closed off by the remaining Great Emperors. Thus, Masters from the Star Boundary can no longer travel to the Star Fields freely. If it weren’t for this, Star Sources wouldn’t be so scarce nowadays, and everyone wouldn’t be so eager to obtain one.”

Yang Kai’s brow twitched, “So, why is it that I have heard of some Masters who can travel to those Lower Star Fields?”

Back then in Heng Luo Star Field, Yang Kai met a Master who had descended from Star Boundary. Fortunately, Yang Yan was there at that time and subdued the invader before he could do any real harm.

Lan Xun disclosed after a nod, “Although the primary corridors were shut down, it is still possible to go to Lower Star Fields through some special methods. Lord Father once said that every Star Field has its own Guardian, and these Guardians protect the Star Fields from the disturbance of powerful external forces. These guardians can enter and exit the Star Fields that they guard at will. If others intend to enter, they can only look for some tremendously dangerous passages, but these passages are extremely rare in the Star Boundary. Most of them are chaotic and unstable, so they cannot be transited safely. What’s more, if those people insist on descending to lower Star Fields, they need to seal or sacrifice their cultivations first.”

“Star Field Guardians!” The dusty memory of Yang Kai reappeared with Lan Xun’s words, as he heard Yang Yan mentioned this title before.

Yang Kai once thought about being the Guardian of Heng Luo Star Field when he got stronger.

He then hurriedly asked, “How can one become a Guardian of a Star Field?”

Lan Xun shook her head, “I don’t know, Lord Father didn’t tell me.” After a pause, she looked at Yang Kai suspiciously, “Did Senior Brother Yang come from one of those Star Fields?”

Lan Xun could not help but think of some possibilities when she saw Yang Kai being so enthusiastic about this matter.

“Junior Sister Lan is indeed beautiful and intelligent!” Yang Kai smiled faintly without denying it.

“Is Senior Brother Yang really a cultivator from the Lower Star Fields?” Lan Xun was slightly startled, and even Xiao Chen could not help but glance over at him.

It was rumoured that those cultivators who could come to Star Boundary from Lower Star Fields all had Heaven-defying aptitude and bright future prospects. They had always been the targets of competition for top Sects and great forces to recruit.

Although there were indeed many such people in the Star Boundary, compared to the number of native cultivators, it was still a tiny fraction.

Lan Xun had only heard about such people before, but never actually met one.

[No wonder Yang Kai’s cultivation speed can be so fast. It seems like the rumours are true.] She thought to herself.

While they were talking, their group arrived at the deeper part of the Source Sea.

There were obviously more people now than previously when it was only occupied by several Emperor Realm Masters. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Yang Kai led everyone to the island where he had landed before, but his face darkened when he found that the island was already crowded with people and there was no place left for them.

But at this moment, a clear wave of Source Strength suddenly transmitted from somewhere.

“Another complete Star Source!” Xiao Chen shouted.

Everyone turned towards a certain direction and saw a glowing orb gradually rise from the sea.

Before the Star Source completely emerged, numerous cultivators swarmed over.

Things did not end there though as after the emergence of a complete Star Source, another orb of light appeared in another place, followed closely by a third, then a fourth…

In the blink of an eye, the sea was densely packed with dazzling rising moons. With a rough count, there were at least a hundred of them, and many more were still emerging.

“So many!” Xiao Chen was utterly dumbfounded yet extremely excited.

However, Lan Xu frowned as she felt discomforted by this scene, “There is no fire without smoke! This situation has never happened in the Source Sea before.”

Yang Kai also felt a little uneasy, but who would not be tempted seeing so many complete Star Sources in front of them?

“Master!” Liu Yan whispered.

Yang Kai gritted his teeth and replied, “Snatch first, worry later.”

While speaking, he gestured to Lan Xun, “Junior Sister Lan, let’s split up!”

Lan Xun nodded in agreement, “Senior Brother Yang, be careful.”

“You too!” Yang Kai nodded before he led the three young women, Mo Xiao Qi, Liu Yan, and Zhang Ruo Xi, rushing forward.

The situation was complete chaos above the Source Sea, with people falling from the sky constantly.

Up ahead, a group of five people, who seemingly belonged to different great forces, were competing for a Star Source. These people were completely focused on fighting one another and none were actually paying attention to the Star Source.

With a flicker, Yang Kai arrived in front of this Star Source, stretched out his hand, and sucked the Star Source directly into his hand with his Star Refining Art before swiftly depositing it into the Sealed World Bead.
