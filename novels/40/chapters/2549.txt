Although the Netherworld Sect members were upset that they were being bossed around by the girl named Lin’er, since the matter had gotten this far, they couldn’t retreat either.

Not to mention, they were here to kill Yang Kai in the first place.

“Form up!” Yin Le Sheng suddenly shouted, waving his hand.

*Shua Shua Shua…*

Over twenty Netherworld Sect disciples flew up at once, floating in the air, surrounding Yang Kai all of a sudden. They appeared to be very particular about their positions, and whether it was the top or below, left or right, front or back, they didn’t leave a single route of escape.

Yin Le Sheng was nervously keeping an eye on Yang Kai, afraid that he would use his teleportation ability to escape.

If Yang Kai felt that things weren’t looking good for him and escaped, all their efforts would be for nought. They had not laid out the Spirit Array yet, and neither had they sealed the space around him. Basically, they were currently unable to kill or capture Yang Kai.

But what made him happy was that Yang Kai didn’t seem to attach any importance to them; he didn’t care the slightest bit about these twenty or so Netherworld Sect disciples and just stood still in his position.

[Enjoy being arrogant while you can! Do you think that you are invincible with your Space Tearing ability and your breakthrough to the Emperor Realm!? Today, I will let you know what it means that there are mountains beyond mountains and Heavens beyond Heavens.]

Yin Le Sheng was feeling extremely happy in his heart, but there wasn’t the slightest bit of change in his expression as his Divine Sense was locked right onto Yang Kai.

In the blink of an eye, the twenty or so Netherworld Sect disciples had already taken their respective positions.

*Hualala…*

After a series of clattering, those twenty or so Netherworld Sect disciples had summoned their respective artifacts. Their artifacts were exactly the same, as if they were made by the same person. All of them were carrying a huge pitch-black banner that was fluttering and flapping in the wind, exuding an extremely cold aura.

These banners were exactly the same as the Netherworld Purgatory Banner that Yang Kai got from Zhong Zhen Yong in the Shattered Star Sea. Obviously, they were the same kind of artifacts and seemed to be a favorite for Netherworld Sect disciples.

However, the energy fluctuations emitted by the Netherworld Purgatory Banners in these disciples’ hands were weaker than Zhong Zhen Yong’s. It should be because their refinement of these artifacts wasn’t up to par.

Everyone had already taken their respective positions and summoned their banners as well; now, everything was ready except for the crucial thing.

The corner of Yin Le Sheng’s lips rose as he revealed a hideous grin before shouting, “Start the Array!”

The twenty or so Netherworld Sect disciples shouted together before their hands started wildly dancing, forming hand seals. In an instant, a very subtle connection seemed to have formed between these twenty or so men, and an invisible barrier which was formed with them as its anchors, sealing Heaven and Earth appeared. A faint black Qi gushed out of the Netherworld Purgatory Banners next and diffused towards the centre.

“An Array!?” Yang Kai appeared startled as a flustered look appeared on his face, asking in shock, “What Array is this?”

Yin Le Sheng broke into laughter and arrogantly replied, “Of course, it’s the Array that will take your life!”

At this point, he didn’t need to worry about anything anymore. Since the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array was already activated, Yang Kai could not escape from this place even if he was proficient in the Dao of Space, unless he could break this Array, of course.

But could the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array arranged by more than twenty Dao Source Realm disciples using their Netherworld Purgatory Banners be destroyed by a mere First-Order Emperor Realm Master?

Even a Third-Order Emperor would be trapped for a while by this setup.

Yang Kai looked horrified and his face had gone totally pale as he looked at Yin Le Sheng. He nervously gulped as he stated, “Brother Yin, what enmity or grievance is there between you and me that you are so dead set upon going against me? I even spared you in the Shattered Star Sea, didn’t I? Shouldn’t we discard our old enmities?”

Yin Le Sheng was dancing in joy in his heart, but outwardly he just let out a cold snort and stated, “Spared me? Don’t make it sound so pleasant. I just happened to have the information you needed. Otherwise, would you have spared me? Discard old enmities my foot! Yang Kai, spare me the rubbish. Today is the day you die.”

Yang Kai bitterly asked, “Brother Yin, do you really have to kill me?”

Yin Le Sheng raised his head as he sneered, “What’s wrong? Could it be that you still want to live at this point?”

Yang Kai pursed his lips into a smile, replying, “If one can live, who wants to die? Brother Yin, why don’t you let me go today, I will pay you a visit in the future, for sure, to repay your kindness.”

“Do you think that I am a three-year-old child? Aren’t you even embarrassed to say this?”

Yang Kai helplessly said, “I guess Brother Yin has already decided to kill me, whatever I say will be useless…”

Yin Le Sheng yelled, “No matter how pleasantly you spew bullshit, no one is going to listen to you.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but sigh before reaching out to his forehead and tucking his hair back as he requested with a forlorn look, “Brother Yin, I have another request!”

“Hmph, what else do you want to say?” A cold smile was hanging on Yin Le Sheng’s lips, feeling extremely pleasant in his heart. He did not know why, but seeing Yang Kai at his wit’s end and helpless, felt as if he had just ravaged several dozen beauties. He felt as if his entire body was filled with a pleasure he couldn’t vent.

“Please let me die in the most beautiful way!” Yang Kai turned his cheek toward him and stood carrying his hands behind his back, looking at the sky with a sidelong glance, striking a cool pose.

Lin’er’s lips involuntarily twitched as she whispered to Old Fu, “This man is really a showoff.”

Old Fu had no idea how to respond.

Suddenly, a frown appeared on Yin Le Sheng’s forehead as he shouted in anger, “You dare play a joke on me!?”

At this moment, he had finally realized that the reason Yang Kai was bullshitting so much was not because of fear, and neither was it because he wanted to leave a pretty speech on his deathbed, rather he was clearly amusing himself.

Yang Kai broke into laughter as he stated, “I was just playing around! Brother Yin, don’t be so serious. Do you really think that this Young Master is afraid of you?”

The mischievous look on Yang Kai’s face angered Yin Le Sheng so much that he almost spurted blood in anger.

Just as he said this, Space Principles surged as Yang Kai’s figure suddenly blurred.

But very soon, his body phased out and became tangible again, reappearing on the same spot. He hadn’t moved from his position even a step.

“The Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array is well-deserving of its reputation!” Yang Kai raised his brow. Although Qi He Feng had mentioned the might of this Array and he knew that it could isolate space, Yang Kai still wanted to see whether he could get out of it.

After giving it a try, Yang Kai found that the surrounding space was utterly sealed, and with his current achievements in the Dao of Space, he was unable to teleport out of here.

“What are you all waiting for!?” Yin Le Sheng shouted at the sight of this, lest Yang Kai escape if they delay any longer.

The twenty or so Netherworld Sect disciples pushed their Source Qi after receiving the order, pouring it into their Netherworld Purgatory Banners, fully activating the might of the Array.

*Hu Hu Hu…*

Suddenly, ghastly cries and wails appeared out of nowhere, making everyone feel as if they had fallen into the netherworld. A cold and sinister aura spread into the surrounding, freezing the ground and withering the grass and trees instantly before they were reduced into dust that blew away with the wind.

Dense and thick streams of black Qi kept gushing out from those twenty or so Netherworld Purgatory Banner while countless faint Yin Souls could be seen in the darkness, dancing around, bearing their claws and fangs, a terrifying sight to behold.

In just three breaths, the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array had sealed this region, turning it pitch-black. From the distance, it looked as if a giant pitch-black ball had suddenly appeared.

This black ball was a few hundred meters in diameter, covering a fairly wide area, and Yang Kai’s figure had completely disappeared inside.

This Spirit Array was already terrifying with this kind of partial initialization, so it was easy to imagine how frightful it would be if fully completed.

Yin Le Sheng pursed his lips into a hideous grin, his eyes completely glued onto the huge black ball, as if he couldn’t wait to witness Yang Kai’s death with his own eyes.

If Yang Kai had a slim hope of escaping a moment ago, with the Array activated now, Yang Kai had no chance of surviving. Inside the Array, his vitality would keep on withering away. Furthermore, the might of twenty or so Netherworld Purgatory Banners would be greatly increased under the effect of the Array, making the joint attack of more than twenty Netherworld Sect disciples quite capable of taking Yang Kai’s life.

“Yin Le Sheng, it seems you went to great lengths just to take my life, but do you really think that this Young Master can’t break this Array?”

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s fierce shout came from inside the black ball, one that sounded completely energetic, as if he wasn’t affected by his situation at all.

Yin Le Sheng’s pupils shrank as he suddenly felt a foreboding feeling grip his heart.

Before he could reply, a wave of terrifying energy fluctuations suddenly spread from the black ball, followed by a deafening explosion.

The huge black ball suddenly doubled in size under the explosion of energy, and looked as if it would burst at any moment.

The twenty or so Dao Source Realm disciples responsible for arranging the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array also turned pale and their figures trembled as if they had suffered some kind of backlash.

Yin Le Shen was completely taken aback and his eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.

Hua Fei Chen also spoke in amazement, “How is this possible? Hasn’t he just broken through to the Emperor Realm?”

Although he couldn’t see what move Yang Kai had just unleashed because of the isolation of the Array, judging by how the Array was affected, he could easily tell how powerful the attack was.

But how could a newly promoted Emperor display such prowess?

Hua Fei Chen imagined himself in Yang Kai’s shoes, wondering what it would be like if he was trapped inside the Array. In that case, he might not be left with any choice but to wait for his death. He would not be able to shake the Array at all.

What he saw just now felt so surreal!

*Hong…*

Another deafening explosion rang out as that black ball that had just recovered swelled again, this time ballooning even more than before.

*Pu…*

The twenty or so Dao Source Realm disciples coughed up mouthfuls of blood as their figures trembled.

Yang Kai’s previous attack had caused them to bear some shockwaves, and before they could steady themselves, they were struck again. They were injured this time, and while the damage wasn’t serious yet and it would not affect their operation of the Array, who knows how many such attacks Yang Kai could unleash?

If this went on, this Array might really be broken.

“Martial Uncle Hua, Senior Brother Yin, we can’t withstand it anymore!” Someone loudly shouted.

Yin Le Sheng was dumbstruck. He wanted to kill Yang Kai, and for this, he had brought so many people from the Sect, even inviting a Second-Order Emperor, Hua Fei Chen, to participate. What’s more, he had also laid out the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array. If he was still unable to kill Yang Kai after all this, what face would he have left to return to the Netherworld Sect? How would he face his Honoured Master who had placed such high hopes on him?

If he failed, it would be far worse than killing himself.

*Hong…*

The third explosion rang out.

*Pu Pu Pu…*

The twenty or so Netherworld Sect disciples spurted blood directly and went completely pale. More importantly, a tear had appeared on the huge black ball. Dense black Qi had suddenly started permeating into the surroundings.

Yin Le Sheng was flabbergasted.

[The Array… Will really collapse!]

At this moment, only five breaths had passed since Yang Kai had started making his move!
