The young girl walked in, accompanied by a handsome young man with rosy lips, white teeth, and a fan in his hand. This graceful young man was none other than the Sky Illumination Palace’s Qiu Yu.

When Yang Kai’s gaze met Qiu Yu’s, the latter was taken aback a little and he said with a smile, “It’s you?”

Yang Kai covered his face with his hand and turned around, saying, “It’s not me. I think you’ve got the wrong person.”

Qiu Yu was startled and he couldn’t help but wonder what Yang Kai was playing at.

The young girl sized up Yang Kai curiously then gazed at Qiu Yu, asking him, “Brother Yu, do you know this man?”

Qiu Yu smiled, “I know him, but I’m not that close to him.”

“Eh!” The young girl nodded, then patted Yang Kai’s shoulder boldly and said, “Hey, Brother Yu is talking with you, how dare you ignore him?”

Yang Kai moved his shoulder aside and shook off her hand, then looked at her in irritation, “Men and women should avoid any intimate body contact, didn’t your parents teach you this? Why are you patting someone else’s shoulders so casually? What are you up to?”

The young girl’s face got flushed and she said through gnashed teeth, “You dare to rebuke me?”

Qiu Yu said with a smile, “Little Sister Bing, don’t lower yourself to his level, this person has always been so guileful. He was also like this at the city’s gate. He even sneaked into the city under Thousand Leaves Sect’s name, who knows what he’s up to?”

“He is with Thousand Leaves Sect?” Luo Bing’s face fell upon hearing this, as if she had a very bad impression of Thousand Leaves Sect.

“That’s right!” Qiu Yu nodded lightly.

Luo Bing spoke promptly, “Then he surely has some malicious plan. Hey, tell me honestly, what did you sneak into the city for? Are you concocting some devious plot?”

She had unexpectedly started interrogating Yang Kai directly.

Yang Kai looked at the young girl with a helpless look on his face. [This little girl must have been spoiled to the bone and is completely oblivious to the ways of the world.]

Thinking so, Yang Kai suddenly let out a nasty laugh.

Luo Bing spoke out of disgust, “Your laugh is so sickening... Hurry up and blurt it out, what did you come to the city for?”

Yang Kai let out a peal of lecherous laughter and spoke, “What else other than that? I heard that Sky Crane City got so many beauties and I have just come here to enjoy myself, I’m especially interested in young girls with tender skin.”

Saying so, he took a deep sniff of the air with an infatuated look at his face then spoke again, “What a rich fragrance! What taste, so sweet and delicious! Ze ze ze...”

Luo Bing had been so frightened that her face turned deathly pale. She couldn’t help but move back several steps and she couldn’t utter another word.

Qiu Yu furrowed his brows and moved in front of Luo Bing, hiding her behind him, then snorted coldly, “Friend, pay attention to your words. You can eat whatever you want, but you can’t say whatever you want. Some words may cost you your life.”

Yang Kai chuckled and shrugged his shoulders, “It’s you who forced such a label on me, insinuating that I sneaked into the city with ulterior motives. So, I just played along with you.”

At this moment, Luo Bing had come back to her senses and she jumped from behind Qiu Yu and shouted in a sweet voice, “You dared to scare me? Do you know who I am?”

Yang Kai cast a glance at her then brushed off her threats, “Don’t know, please don’t bother me. You’re a nuisance!”

“He dared to... Shoo me off?” Luo Bing widened up her pretty eyes and she got so angry that her chest heaved up and down. She was the daughter of Sky Crane City’s Lord, she was from a family with great influence, and had a prominent status. She was also a great beauty with many suitors pestering her, Qiu Yu being one of them. Every time Qiu Yu visited Sky Crane City, he would accompany her and would follow her closely like her shadow.

Moreover, Luo Jin spoiled her and satisfied every little request of hers. She had always lived with the world revolving around her, where everyone treated her with the utmost care. She had never been so shunned by a man before.

She felt quite aggrieved and she stamped her foot, “You... You... I’ll teach you a lesson!”

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai’s face fell.

He wasn’t afraid of Sky Crane City, but if he got into a conflict with Luo Bing, then he would implicate the members of the Thousand Leaves Sect and he didn’t hope to see this.

Luo Bing shouted then jumped toward Yang Kai with her head held high, staring at him viciously.

When Yang Kai had just gotten wary, she turned her head around and pointed at the goods on the counter then spoke with the shopkeeper, “Did he buy those goods?”

Upon hearing this, the shopkeeper nodded without giving any thought to this, “That’s right.”

“Good!” Luo Bing gnashed her teeth, “Then I want all of them, don’t sell off any of them to him.”

Yang Kai’s expression turned gloomy, while Qiu Yu was taken aback. [Does she plan to teach him a lesson through this? Isn’t this lesson a bit too petty?]

An embarrassed look appeared on the shopkeeper’s face, “Young Lady Luo, those goods have already been picked by this guest, and we have just calculated the cost.”

Luo Bing said, “Then he didn’t pay for them yet, right?”

The shopkeeper hesitated for a moment, “He hasn’t done so. Yet....”

“Then, that’s fine, I want all of them,” Luo Bing snorted and looked at Yang Kai with a complacent look, as if she was saying, [Do you dare to fight with me?]

Yang Kai was dumbfounded by this, and he only got more certain that this little girl had been spoiled rotten to the bone. Even when she got angry, she didn’t know how to vent her anger.

The shopkeeper took a deep breath, “Young Miss Luo, those goods had been selected by him already, and if he wants to buy them, then I have to sell them off to him. So, I’m afraid that I can’t satisfy your request.”

“What?” Luo Bing pulled a long face and glared at the shopkeeper, “Didn’t you hear what I have just said?”

The shopkeeper explained calmly, “Those are our store’s rules, we hope for your understanding.”

This store wasn’t big, but it was still a branch of Violet Source Chamber of Commerce and it represented its face. So, the shopkeeper wasn’t really afraid of the daughter of Sky Crane City’s Lord, Luo Bing, and he also wouldn’t offend a guest for her and ruin the reputation of Violet Source Chamber of Commerce.

As for the consequences of offending the Young Lady of the City Lord’s Mansion? It would be up to his superiors to handle this. Besides, even if Luo Jin learned of this, he likely wouldn’t make any trouble for the store.

“You...” Luo Bing got so angry that her small face got flushed red.

Upon seeing this, Qiu Yu started to try and appease her, “Little Sister Bing, just forget about it. It’s just a few herbs. If they don’t want to sell them, we can just buy them from another place.”

“That’s out of the question! I have set my mind on this! So, I’ll buy them no matter what!” Luo Bing puffed up her cheeks, then said through gnashed teeth, “Shopkeeper, just tell me how much do those goods cost? I’ll pay double for them.”

The shopkeeper rubbed his forehead and said with a bitter smile, “I still can’t break the store’s rules.”

Yang Kai suddenly smiled, “Shopkeeper, how can you miss free money? Since this little girl wants to pay double the price, then just sell them to her.”

Upon hearing this, the shopkeeper cast a grateful glance at Yang Kai and bowed at him, “Dear guest, many thanks for your understanding.”

Luo Bing shouted, “Why are you talking as if he let me have them? I snatched them away, you know?”

“You’re right, you’re right, you have snatched them and I have just conceded in defeat,” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly.

“That’s more like it,” Luo Bing’s expression turned for the better and she raised her head complacently then knocked on the table, saying, “Speak! How much do they cost?”

The shopkeeper quickly calculated the cost and said, “The original price would be 18,604,300 Source Crystals, but we can just round it to 18,600,000. So, Young Lady Luo, you’ll have to pay 37,200,000 Source Crystals.”

*Gudong...*

Luo Bing gulped hard and said with great difficulty, “How... How much again?”

The shopkeeper raised his head and repeated the price with a composed look.

At this moment, even Qiu Yu winded up his eyes and he looked in shock at Yang Kai.

He would have never imagined that the things Yang Kai bought were so expensive. Such an astronomical amount of Source Crystals would shock most Dao Source Realm cultivators. Even Qiu Yu, who was the Young Palace Master of the Sky Illumination Palace, didn’t have such a large number of Source Crystals.

Since Yang Kai was this wealthy, to the point that he would casually carry that amount around, then he surely was no ordinary cultivator.

Luo Bing was completely dumbstruck as she stood there in a daze for a long time.

After a long while, Luo Bing asked bitterly, “Shopkeeper, are you sure you didn’t make some mistake while calculating?”

The shopkeeper replied calmly, “I have been managing this store for thirty years and I have never made such a mistake.”

Yang Kai next to them grinned, “Little girl, what’s wrong? Can you not afford it?”

“Who says I can’t?” Upon hearing this, Luo Bing stomped her foot, as if she was a little rabbit that got its tail stepped on. “I wouldn’t... put such a small amount of Source Crystals in... my eyes. The allowance given to me by my father is a lot more than this...”

“Great!” Yang Kai nodded and cupped his fists at her, saying, “The Young Lady is so rich and imposing, I can’t help but admire you.”

Luo Bing said in a low voice, “But I left home in a hurry today and didn’t bring that much with me.”

Yang Kai smiled and cast a sidelong glance at her then spoke, “Young Lady Luo, are you planning to purchase on credit?”

“Who said anything about purchasing on credit?” Luo Bing’s face got flushed. She really planned to do this just now, but having been mocked by Yang Kai, she no longer felt she had the face to do so. With no other choice, she turned expectantly to Qiu Yu, “Brother Qiu...”

Qiu Yu stroked his Space Ring subconsciously and twitched his lips as he spoke, “Little Sister Bing, I only have a million in hand...”

Upon hearing this, Luo Bing stomped her foot, “Why didn’t you bring more Source Crystals with you?”

A dumbfounded look appeared on Qiu Yu’s face as he couldn’t help but wonder, [A million is more than enough, and I have saved up for so long to accumulate this much. Where can I get more of it? Even if I had more, I wouldn’t take it out now....]

She was trying to buy herbs at double their price in a fit of anger, yet she wanted to use his Source Crystals. Luo Bing’s family would surely not return such a sum to him.

Upon thinking of this, Qiu Yu glared resentfully at Yang Kai. If this man hadn’t caused so much mischief, he wouldn’t have found himself in such an awkward position.

As for Yang Kai, he just turned a blind eye to his glare and laughed loudly, “Young Lady Luo, it seems you didn’t bring enough with you. Then, I can only take these herbs for myself.”

“Stop!” Luo Bing shouted and jumped between him and the counter, using her body as a shield like she was protecting some precious treasure, shouting desperately at Yang Kai, “Just wait for a little while, I’ll go back and ask for the Source Crystals from my father.”

“Would the City Lord give such a sum to you?” Yang Kai curled his lips.

As long as Luo Jin didn’t lose his mind, he wouldn’t give Luo Bing such a large sum for her petty quarrel. At most, he would send some people after Yang Kai to teach him a lesson.
