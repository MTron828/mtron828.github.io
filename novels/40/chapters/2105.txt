Upon hearing Chen Wen Hao’s statement, Feng Ming and Gao Xue Ting both started fully manoeuvring their Source Qi.

“Seniors, do you have to go so far and take my life?” Yang Kai suddenly spoke.

The three Emperor Realm Masters were taken aback.

Since the beginning of the fight, Yang Kai had only uttered several words and they weren’t any different than a madman’s yells, yet at this moment, his voice was pretty calm and he was obviously lucid.

“Demon, don’t waste your breath, we won’t rest today until one of us is dead,” Chen Wen Hao shouted and waved his sword. The Myriad Sword Principle power went after Yang Kai!

Feng Ming and Gao Xue Ting had also attacked at the same time.

Yang Kai held his breath. After he came back to his senses, he realized and understood the Emperor Realm Masters’ terrifying power.

He wasn’t able to contend against those three people!

Previously, he was able to exchange blows with them for so long only thanks to the Demon Sense, which had aroused his instinct for survival and slaughter.

But now, upon facing the Emperor Realm Masters’ shocking joint attack, Yang Kai detected a deadly threat looming over him.

He quickly tapped the ground several times with his foot and moved back gracefully, while he gnashed his teeth and shouted: “Black Eye Prison: Infinite Darkness!”

As his voice echoed out, his right eye’s pitch-black Demonic Pupil shot a dark ray.

When the three Emperor Realm Masters faced said black pupil, their movement came to a stop for a moment. It looked to them like that pupil contained a whole ever-changing world and a universe full of revolving celestial bodies.

A desolate and ancient aura started spreading out, while the sky fell into darkness, a darkness so deep that one couldn’t see his fingers.

The region enveloped by absolute darkness turned into a prison, a large prison with a perimeter of a hundred miles.

Even the radiance of the dazzling sword light, the spear phantom image, and the Nine Suns’ Radiant Shine in the sky couldn’t penetrate the darkness’s seal and disperse it.

The Emperor Realm Masters got nervous, as they couldn’t see even their nearby companions, and when they released their Divine Sense, its detection power was disturbed by the boundless darkness and it descended into a mess.

It looked like this said darkness spread out to the ends of the world, engulfing it whole.

After the Emperor Realm Masters had gone through some short-lived fluster, they quickly regained their calm and started weaving hand seals.

Myriad sword light flew around, while the Lightning Goose Spear turned into a Flood Dragon of Thunder and danced in the sky. As for the nine radiant suns, they had all exploded.

A wisp of light was sparked in the boundless darkness, and it quickly expanded until it dispersed and scattered the darkness.

The three people stood in the air and looked around. They were the sole people left here, while the demon had already disappeared. Who knew where he ran away to?

They all couldn’t help but exchange a glance. Their expressions were quite unsightly as they all released their Divine Sense to cover the land, yet they still couldn’t discern in which direction the demon ran.

“What kind of Divine Ability was that?” Feng Ming shouted with a gloomy look plastered on his face.

Chen Wen Hao shook his head, “No idea!”

“We must quickly report this affair to our sect, and... We should also take a trip to the Star Soul Palace. An Ancient Great Demon’s Demon Sense has emerged, and they probably have some inklings about it,” Gao Xue Ting collected the Radiant Sun Mirror and stroked it lightly with a pained look appeared on her face. A wisp of Dark Power was left in the mirror, and it wasn’t any different than a maggot gnawing at it, yet she couldn’t get rid of it. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Junior Sister Gao, you’re right. There’s no time to lose, we must quickly set off toward the Star Soul Palace. Let’s hope that the Great Emperor has already detected it,” Chen Wen Hao said and took out a Jade Token. He quickly imbued his Divine Sense into it then shattered it.

A complex and strange pattern emerged in front of him, yet shortly disappeared and left with the wind.

Feng Ming and Gao Xue Ting had also cast various Secret Techniques and reported what they had seen and experienced to their sects’ headquarters.

Soon after, they set off toward the Star Soul Palace to visit the Bright Moon Great Emperor and demand an answer out of him.

As for whether the fugitive demon would scourge the nearby Maplewood City, that wasn’t something they had to deal with. That demon acted so strangely, and its means were all-powerful. They weren’t able to slay it even after joining hands, and they still had some apprehension about the Barrier Divine Ability cast by the demon at the end.

If the demon seized that chance to mount a surprise attack on them, then they would end up either dead or injured.

They all didn’t care about the little Maplewood City, and if they hadn’t learned of the damaged Ancient Great Demon’s seal here, then people of their status would never drop by this place.

After a short while, the plane recovered its calm.

...

Meanwhile, a pretty woman with a cold look plastered on her face sneaked into Maplewood City. The woman was clad in an outfit as red as sunset clouds.

The numerous cultivators had just survived a calamity, yet after seeing this pretty woman, they all couldn’t help but gaze at her.

Some people had detected faintly that this said woman possessed an unusual spiritual nature, which was both ethereal yet berserk. It was pretty bewildering!

Soon after, the woman took out a Sound Bead and infused her Divine Sense into it, and it looked like she was communicating with someone.

After a short while, she put away the Sound Bead and made her way toward a secluded alley.

She waited in silence for half an hour until a pretty silhouette emerged strangely.

The young woman detected her presence and turned her head to gaze at her. Upon seeing the young girl, she smiled and said, “You are Sister Xiao Qi, aren’t you?”

Mo Xiao Qi furrowed her brows and cast a glance behind the woman, yet didn’t see that familiar silhouette. She couldn’t help but ask in confusion, “Who are you? Did Brother Yang send you to seek me?”

“That’s right!” The young woman nodded and a Sound Bead appeared on her palm with a flip of a hand.

“This is what I have given Brother Yang,” Mo Xiao Qi nodded and asked, “Where is Brother Yang? I heard from City Lord Duan that he got corrupted by the Demon Qi outside the city, is he alright?”

She looked very nervous, as if she was very worried over Yang Kai’s safety.

“My master isn’t in danger for now, he’s only suffering from some minor issues and can’t meet you in person. He sent me over to pass some words to you,” the young woman replied.

“It’s fine as long as he’s alright,” Mo Xiao Qi set her mind at ease and cast a glance at the young woman. She asked with a smile, “Big sis, what’s your name?”

“My master has given me the name Liu Yan,” the woman replied.

An odd look appeared on Mo Xiao Qi’s face and she said, “It looks like Brother Yang is only a First-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivator, and you are also a First-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivator, aren’t you? So, why do you call him master?”

Liu Yan replied with a smile, “If it wasn’t for my master’s help, I wouldn’t be here. My master has given me a new lease of life.”

Mo Xiao Qi pouted and said, “Fine! In any case, it isn’t my business. Big sis, what do you plan to do later?”

“I’ll follow my master’s orders and reside for now in the Zhang family’s old house outside the city. My master has also instructed me to bring the Zhang family’s members with me,” Liu Yan said.

“Since it’s Brother Yang’s instruction, then please come with me,” Mo Xiao Qi called her over.

Liu Yan shook her head and said, “Isn’t Shopkeeper Kang making a breakthrough now? Isn’t the City Lord in front of your Cave Mansion now?”

“That’s right,” Mo Xiao Qi nodded.

Liu Yan revealed a smile and said, “I can’t see City Lord Duan and the others for now. Miss Xiao Qi, please escort the Zhang family’s members to the outside of the city. I’ll be waiting for you there.”

After she spoke, Liu Yan turned into a ray of light and flew toward the outside of the city.

Meanwhile, Duan Yuan Shan who had been waiting in front of the Cave Mansion detected something and cast a glance toward Liu Yan’s direction. He said in confusion, “What a foreign aura! Is it another Dao Source Ream Cultivator?”

On the other hand, after Liu Yan disappeared, Mo Xiao Qi rolled her eyes and said sceptically, “She doesn’t look human at all, this sister is really strange.”

She was quite curious about Liu Yan’s true form, but since the woman was related to Yang Kai, she just acted like she didn’t notice anything. However, she was also aware of why Liu Yan stated that she couldn’t see and meet City Lord Duan and the others.

Duan Yuan Shan was a Second-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivator and he probably could see through her real nature.

Mo Xiao Qi just shook her head and walked toward her Cave Mansion.

...

After an hour, outside the city.

Mo Xiao Qi brought the Zhang family’s members to Liu Yan.

The Zhang family members had gotten some information about this from Mo Xiao Qi and didn’t reject Liu Yan, rather they all treated her respectfully after they detected her profound cultivation base.

They all couldn’t disregard even Liu Yan’s First-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivation, let alone her master-servant relationship with Yang Kai.

“Are you Miss Ruo Xi? As I thought, you are so pure-looking and cute,” Liu Yan’s gaze surveyed the Zhang family’s members before it fell upon Zhang Ruo Xi. She spoke with a smile, while confusion flashed past her pretty eyes.

She couldn’t understand why Yang Kai was so fond of Zhang Ruo Xi.

Even though the young girl was quite pretty, her young body hadn’t fully matured yet, and if Yang Kai wanted a woman, he didn’t have to seek such a young girl. Someone with his cultivation base could get any woman he wanted.

Moreover, she also had a good understanding of Yang Kai and he wasn’t a lecherous man.

As for Zhang Ruo Xi’s cultivation? She was only a Second-Order Saint King and she couldn’t provide any help to Yang Kai. Thus, Liu Yan couldn’t see through this no matter how hard she racked her brains.

“Senior Liu Yan, hi,” Upon hearing Liu calling her out, Zhang Ruo Xi’s face got flushed and she greeted her in fluster.

Liu Yan responded with a smile.

“Senior Liu, how is mister...” Zhang Ruo Xi bit her rosy lips and summoned her courage to raise a question.

The Zhang family’s grandma and mistress had also looked over at her nervously. They all wanted to inquire about Yang Kai’s well-being and whereabouts.

“My master is safe and sound, you don’t have to worry about him. But, his body has been corroded by Demon Qi and he’s feeble for now. He’s now recuperating and he’ll come back within the next few days,” Liu Yan explained.

“I can set my mind at ease then,” the Zhang family’s mistress heaved a sigh of relief, relieved looks were also apparent on the faces of Zhang Ruo Xi and the others.

“Sister Xiao Qi, I’ll take them back,” Liu Yan spoke with Mo Xiao Qi.

Mo Xiao Qi nodded. “Fine, I’ll look for Brother Yang again once he comes back.”

Thus, both sides bid farewell to each other and separated.

Liu Yan and the Zhang family’s members departed toward a residence outside the city and they quickly reached it.

After they arrived back home, they all treated Liu Yan as an honoured guest and provided her with the best room.

Soon after, Liu Yan told them she would carry out secluded cultivation, and she just shut the windows, set up a barrier, and isolated the room thoroughly.

Inside the room, Liu Yan opened her rosy mouth, spat out a fruit-sized bead, and held it carefully in her palm. She gazed at the bead with worry apparent in her pretty eyes, while her former relaxed and easy-going air had disappeared completely!

This bead was none other than the Sealed World Bead!

At that time, after Liu Yan emerged and awakened Yang Kai’s mind, he forcefully cast an Ancient Great Demon’s Secret Technique and stranded the three Emperor Realm Masters with Dark Power. Soon after, he cast a Spatial Secret Technique and converged with her, then left the Sealed World Bead in her care, before he went into hiding within the bead.
