Zhu Lie snorted and rebuffed, “The waves crashing against the rock would only get destroyed, nothing other than that would happen.”

Yang Kai countered, raising his head, “Then it will depend whether the rock called Dragon Island is hard enough to break my bones to pieces.”

Zhu Lie looked at him in astonishment, as if he wanted to see a joking look on his face, but to his disappointment, Yang Kai didn’t appear to be speaking in jest; although there was no serious look on his face, there was no humour behind it either.

Zhu Lie slowly shook his head and rebuffed with a complex look on his face, “You’re really crazy.”

Yang Kai broke into laughter, “Thanks for the compliment.”

Zhu Lie didn’t want to haggle with him anymore, because Yang Kai’s attitude had made everything clear; he would never give up Zhu Qing, nor would he succumb to Dragon Island’s rules.

That being the case, there was no point in wasting words on him so he turned his head and asked, “What are you doing here?”

While talking, the two had unknowingly arrived at Demon Fury City. It had only been half a day since the last time the two had passed through here, and the aftermath of their havoc hadn’t even been cleaned up yet. The corpses of Demon Kings were still lying where they were before, and a thick stench of blood was lingering in the air.

Seeing the two scourges actually return, and returning together, with aggressive bearings like they were preparing to go all out, the Demon Race members of Demon Fury City turned completely pale. Their hearts were like dead ashes and they felt as if doom had come for them.

But even so, no Demon abandoned the city to escape. The Demon Race had been based here for hundreds of thousands of years, confronting Human Imperial City from a distance. The two races had never stopped fighting, so if they submitted to cowardice now, would they still be called the Demon Race? T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

One after another, Demon Race Masters walked out of the city, gradually gathering towards Yang Kai and Zhu Lie’s location. Even though their cultivations were mixed, their numbers were great.

The Demon Kings had also gathered at one place, gazing with a serious look on their faces towards the two Humans flying over from Yin Wind Mountain’s direction as their fighting spirits slowly rose.

Yang Kai and Zhu Lie stopped a thousand metres away from the Demon Kings, and although they were only two, it seemed as if an army of thousands of soldiers and horses was marching over. On the contrary, the Demon Race had completely fallen into a disadvantage in momentum.

“What are you doing here?” Zhu Lie furrowed his brow, “Could it be that you want to slaughter the entire city?”

Humans and Demons could not coexist. Even in this little Revolving World, the grievances between the two clans had lasted for hundreds of thousands of years, so it wouldn’t be surprising if Yang Kai really came to create a massacre.

“Slaughter the city? Fighting and killing like that is boring,” Yang Kai disdainfully spat before he swept a glance over the Demon Kings with a frown. Finally, his eyes landed on one particular figure hiding behind the crowd and he flashed a harmless, innocent smile as he called out, “Beautiful Elder Sister, can you come out and have a chat?”

All the Demon Kings turned their heads, looking in the direction of Yang Kai’s gaze.

A graceful figure was hiding behind the crowd as if she didn’t dare to show her face.

Obviously, she was very discreet, but she had still been picked out from the crowd by Yang Kai. Her heart was bogged down with sorrow as she kept raining down silent curses on Yang Kai while viciously glaring at him. She hated herself for teasing Yang Kai before out of boredom, as now she couldn’t get rid of this scourge. She had no idea what fate was waiting for her.

In front of everyone’s eyes, the Charm Demon couldn’t hide anymore, so all she could do was walk out of the crowd with a reluctant smile. She knew everything, but deliberately asked, “Sir… are you talking to me? You aren’t, right? Hehehe…”

With no one acting in concert with her, she embarrassedly laughed and immediately stopped, wearing a pitiful and submissive look.

“En, I’m talking to you,” Yang Kai nodded to her with a warm smile.

She knew that was the case, but when Yang Kai confirmed it, her face involuntarily turned pale nonetheless. She replied in a trembling voice, “Sir, please forgive this slave for having eyes but failing to see. Fortunately, Sir is magnanimous and would not lower yourself to the same level as such a lowly one. This slave will not commit the same mistake again. Sir, please spare me!”

She yielded right away while the faces of the other Demon Kings immediately turned ugly. Everyone felt that this bitch had lost the Demon Race’s face. She made the despicable Human look down upon them and they couldn’t wait to rip her mouth out.

But they could only think such things in their heads. Although the Demon Kings despised this Charm Demon’s attitude, they also knew that there should be no conflicts among them at the moment. If they really made their moves now, these two bastards would wash the entire Demon Fury City with blood.

“Don’t be so nervous, we won’t eat you,” Yang Kai chuckled at the Charm Demon. “This Young Master just came over to ask some questions. Is there someplace we can talk?”

Hearing this, the Charm Demon didn’t know whether she should believe him or not, but even if she didn’t believe him, what could she do? The opposite party had a bigger fist, so whatever he said was the truth.

“Yes, there is. Sir, what do you think about there?” The Charm Demon proposed, pointing to a nearby location.

Yang Kai looked over and saw an open square with stone tables and chairs at its edges. There were many statues erected in the square, all of them were quite tall and muscular, with frightening faces. Those statues should have been sculpted by a Master, as each one was vivid and lifelike, just like a real person.

The statues were of males and females, and all different races. Even though Yang Kai knew much of the Demon Race, he couldn’t identify all the races of these statues.

“It will do!” Yang Kai nodded and flew towards the square first.

Zhu Lie furrowed his brow; he had no idea what Yang Kai wanted to do here, so all he could do was follow his lead for now.

The Charm Demon’s feet seemed to be rooted on the ground; she appeared to be in a difficult spot. She really lacked the courage to meet with Yang Kai face-to-face, but if she didn’t go, she might offend this plague.

She turned to look at the other Demon Kings, as if she was looking for their support.

The moment she glanced at them, some Demon Kings looked away, others looked up, some whispered to their companions as if they were discussing important matters, while some infuriatingly even pretended to be counting their hairs! All of them had extremely serious looks on their faces though as they avoided her eyes!

The Charm Demon felt isolated and helpless.

“All you Demon Kings come too, I’ll kill whoever refuses!”

Yang Kai’s voice came from afar. It wasn’t loud, but the countenances of many Demon Kings immediately turned ugly.

Meanwhile, the Charm Demon suddenly smiled happily. She couldn’t help but want to laugh out loud, but seeing the livid looks on her fellow clansmen’s faces, she held back.

Letting out a soft snort, she chased after Yang Kai, swaying her hips lightly.

With her taking the lead, the other Demon Kings followed one after another. Naturally, some prideful and unyielding Demon Kings stood in place, not wanting to follow Yang Kai’s order, but they were dragged over by their companions soon enough.

They didn’t want to give these two fearsome fellows any reason to act out.

In the square, Yang Kai and Zhu Lie, taking their respective seats, gazed at the statues before Yang Kai looked back and asked, “Who are they?”

The Charm Demon was first to arrive, and after coming within ten metres of him, she started shaking. Her mouth went parched and tongue scorched, feeling insecure. In her heart, just when she was wondering what Yang Kai wanted to ask and how she should answer him so as not to arouse his anger, she finally felt at ease when she heard his question. She hurriedly replied, “These are the statues of all the Demon Kings ever born in Demon Fury City.”

Yang Kai raised his brow and asked, “Demon Fury City has been standing for hundreds of thousands of years, but there have only been this many Demon Kings?”

There were many statues in the square, but at most there were two thousand in total. Demon Fury City couldn’t have only given birth to these few Demon Kings.

The Charm Demon hurriedly corrected, “Of course not! The only ones whose statues can remain here are the top Demon Kings.” After having said this, she added, “The top Demon King is the strongest Master of Demon Fury City.”

“So that’s how it is,” Yang Kai gently nodded before asking with interest, “I wonder if among the few Demon Kings who just died, was there a top Demon King or not?”

The corner of Charm Demon’s mouth twitched as she wondered what Yang Kai’s intentions were, but she still gently nodded.

“Who did it?” Yang Kai was a little surprised, thinking that the top Demon King’s luck was too bad.

The Charm Demon cautiously glanced at Zhu Lie and said, forcing a smile, “I would also like to thank Sir for giving our top Demon King the chance to leave his name in advance… After all, according to the rules, one can only leave a statue here after his or her death.”

Zhu Lie coldly snorted, “This Dragon wasn’t aiming at anyone in particular, it’s just that you Demon Kings are weak as chickens!”

The Demon Kings of Demon Fury City happened to have just arrived so their chests immediately heaved up and down in anger, hearing Zhu Lie’s words. Their breathing became ragged, but they dared not voice their discontent, settling for grimacing in anger.

The Charm Demon was rendered speechless too. Although she deliberately wanted to please Yang Kai and Zhu Lie, she wasn’t stupid enough to agree to this in front of so many Demon Kings.

[But speaking of, this red-haired man is really scary. It’s not that the top Demon King was weak. In fact, anyone who could reach the realm of Demon King isn’t weak while the one who rises to seize the title of top Demon King is the strongest Master among all living Demon Kings.]

[Even so, he was killed by this red-haired man in a flash.]

The Charm Demon wanted to know the origins of this red-haired young man and what his cultivation was.

“What about the statue in the middle? It’s like a crane amongst the chickens. And why can’t I see its face clearly?” Yang Kai looked at the centre of the square.

There stood an enormous statue. In contrast, the other statues were simply like grandchildren before their grandfather. It was at least ten times bigger than the other, but what Yang Kai found strange was that the other statues were vivid and lifelike, but only this statue’s face was completely flat, uncarved in any way.

The Charm Demon immediately replied with a solemn face and in a solemn voice, “That is the statue of my Demon Realm’s Great Demon God! Because no one has seen the Great Demon God in person though…”

“Great Demon God!” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes as he suddenly recalled his experience in the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld. Inside the Two Worlds Passage, just one remote attack by Great Demon God had almost extinguished his Soul. That moment was completely terrifying and even now Yang Kai could recall it vividly.
