Far away from Blue Feather Mountain, more than a hundred thousand kilometres away, two streaks of light shot across the sky like lightning before abruptly coming to a halt and flying down to a concealed spot below.

When the light faded, it revealed the figures of Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun.

“Have we escaped?” Liu Xian Yun felt both pleasant surprise and some disbelief as a thrilled look flashed across her beautiful eyes.

During their flight, she unexpectedly discovered that no one tried to stop them. However, this was not too surprising as she and Yang Kai both belonged to Blue Feather Sect at this moment and had Identity Tokens on them, so even if someone asked, all they needed to do was show their Identity Tokens and they could pass through safely.

After leaving Blue Feather Mountain, the two continued to speed along, and now, feeling as if they had gone far enough, they decided to land.

A distance of more than a hundred thousand kilometres was safe enough, and what’s more, no one would care about the two of them fleeing with Blue Feather Sect currently in chaos.

It was also fortunate that Bian Yu Qing and Kou Wu, the two who knew Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun’s real identities, weren’t in Sect.

“Brother Yang, we really escaped!” Liu Xian Yun was still immersed in her excitement and said with a smile on her face.

“Xian Yun, come here,” Yang Kai on the other hand did not look happy at all and simply beckoned to Liu Xian Yun with a solemn expression before immediately taking out a few Space Rings from his pocket and sweeping them with his Divine Sense.

These Space Rings were all owned by the enemies he killed in the Bone Prison before; four in total.

After checking their contents, Yang Kai kept one for himself while stuffing the others into Liu Xian Yun’s hand and saying, “You take this.”

“Brother Yang, what is this?” Liu Xian Yun stared at Yang Kai blankly.

“It’s nothing. From now on, you and I will be parting ways,” Yang Kai replied sternly.

Hearing this, Liu Xian Yun’s tender body trembled as she asked him with some difficulty, “Brother Yang, do you think I’m holding you back?”

Yang Kai frowned in silence but soon nodded, “Yes!”

Liu Xian Yun looked at him seriously as she grit her teeth and protested, “No! Brother Yang, be honest with me, are we in some kind of danger still? Is it related to that Senior Wu?”

“Why are you asking so many questions?” Yang Kai spat impatiently, “Are you women all so long-winded? I’m telling you to leave, so just leave.”

Liu Xian Yun clenched her fists as she glared at him, her proud peaks heaving up and down as she quickly said, “I’ve received much care from Brother Yang during this period, so if Brother Yang is now facing any danger, Xian Yun will not just sit back and watch.”

“What danger could I be in?” Yang Kai said in an exasperated tone, “In any case, you and I are now well water and river water. You walk along the open road while I cross the plank bridge. Good luck!”

When Yang Kai finished, he directly flew off.

“You think you can just leave?” Liu Xian Yun raised her brow and snorted coldly before chasing after him.

Although she did not know why Yang Kai was doing this, from the impression she had of him these days, she knew he was not a ruthless person, so Liu Xian Yun concluded that Yang Kai was definitely in trouble and was trying to separate from her so as not to get her involved.

But how could she be so ungrateful? Naturally, Liu Xian Yun couldn’t let Yang Kai face danger all alone.

Even if her own strength was limited, two people working together was still better than one person alone.

To her surprise though, Liu Xian Yun was only able to chase after Yang Kai for a brief moment before she completely lost his trail. His speed was so great that it had already exceeded what an Origin King was capable of. What’s more, there were some faint Space Force fluctuations in Yang Kai’s wake.

Liu Xian Yun knew Yang Kai comprehended the Dao of Space as, back in the Starlight Corridor, he had used Space Force during his battle with Yin Le Sheng.

Wanting to chase a person who was proficient in Space Force and was determined to throw her off was undoubtedly a fruitless endeavour.

As such, after Liu Xian Yun chased him for a while, she was forced to give up. After falling back to the ground, she sighed faintly before staring in the direction Yang Kai disappeared as she muttered to herself, “Many thanks for this period of time. Please take care!”

Lifting her hand, she finally scanned the Space Rings she had in her palm and quickly realized there were a lot of Source Crystals and artifacts stored inside them. One of the Space Rings had significantly more wealth than the others, so it had to have belonged to Zhou Yi.

“It really fits his character,” Liu Xian Yun smiled bitterly. Yang Kai had only taken a ring belonging to one of the Origin Kings and left everything else to her, obviously out of concern for her future. Now, she would not need to worry about cultivation resources for a while.

...

Up in the air, Yang Kai continued flying along.

The reason why he chose to part ways with Liu Xian Yun was really because he felt a sense of anxiety in his heart, and the source of that anxiety was none other than Wu Meng Chuan.

Although he did not know what Wu Meng Chuan was plotting, he knew that the old man wasn’t just kindly allowing him to leave, especially after he taught him the Heaven Devouring Battle Law.

[This must be some kind of conspiracy!]

That old man was a Dao Source Realm master, possibly even half a step into the Emperor Realm, so Yang Kai did not have any confidence to face off against him. In order to avoid Liu Xian Yun getting involved, he could only separate from her.

In any case, Liu Xian Yun was an Origin King master and was once a dominant figure in her Star Field, so he believed that even in the Star Boundary, she would be able to take good care of herself.

If she had an accident due to bad luck, it would only go to show that her destiny ended there.

Right now, Yang Kai only wanted to be as far away from Blue Feather Sect as possible, so he had no intention of stopping and kept speeding forward.

Along the way, he was able to see the various rivers and mountains of the Star Field. The cultivation environment here was far better than any Cultivation Star in his native Star Field, and at night, when he looked up, he could see the clustered, brilliantly glowing nebulae, each representing a lower Star Field.

After flying for a month straight, Yang Kai finally felt a bit safer.

Over the course of a month, Yang Kai had put a few tens of millions of kilometres between him and the Blue Feather Sect, so even if Wu Meng Chuan was a powerful Dao Source Level Realm master, he definitely wouldn’t be able to deal with him across such a vast distance.

Coming to a stop, Yang Kai looked around, but there was only wilderness as far as he could see.

He did not know where he was now as he was still newly arrived in the Star Boundary and knew nothing about its geography. He only knew that there were four major territories and that he should still be in the Southern Territory.

With no other choice, Yang Kai kept flying at a slower pace, looking for traces of civilization while restoring his strength.

After half a day, he finally found something.

A flight type artifact that resembled a chariot appeared in the distance, and judging from its aura fluctuations, it was Origin King Grade.

Yang Kai quickly moved towards the chariot hoping to ask for directions to the nearest city from whoever the owner was.

However, the other party did not show any intention to stop and simply flew past Yang Kai without even sparing him a glance.

“How indifferent!” Yang Kai looked depressed.

But soon, he discovered that immediately after this chariot, a number of other flight type artifacts flew over from the same direction.

“What’s happening?” Yang Kai was confused and subconsciously thought that he had gotten caught up in some kind of pursuit incident, but after carefully inspecting the situation, he found this wasn’t the case as none of these people showed any murderous intent and were simply flying in the same direction as the previous chariot.

It was almost as if they were hurrying along towards a certain place.

[What is this?] Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Yang Kai stood on the spot, waving his hand constantly, trying to find someone to ask what they were doing, but everyone completely ignored him as they hurried along.

Yang Kai felt somewhat embarrassed standing there being ignored.

However, he was able to glean some insights from his observations. From the variety and grade of all these flight type artifacts, the Artifact Refining standards of the Star Boundary were obviously quite extraordinary.

Some of these flight type artifacts were shaped like simple long swords, while others were shuttle-shaped, chariot-shaped, boat-shaped, sedan-shaped, and a variety of other unique designs. Each one had excellent speed and appeared quite dazzling to Yang Kai.

“Hey, why are you just standing here in a daze? If you do not hurry up, you won’t be able to gain any benefits,” Suddenly, a voice came from the side.

Yang Kai turned his head and found that a tiger-headed chariot had come to stop beside him. The carved tiger’s head was quite vivid and majestic and atop it there was a middle-aged man with an Origin King cultivation staring at Yang Kai curiously.

Overjoyed, Yang Kai quickly cupped his fists and said, “Greetings, friend.”

The middle-aged man nodded, swept his eyes over Yang Kai, and asked thoughtfully, “Are you... not from Maplewood City?”

“Maplewood City?” Yang Kai raised his brow before slowly shaking his head, “No! May I ask if Maplewood City is far from here?”

“Maplewood City is just a hundred thousand kilometres in that direction,” The middle-aged man seemed personable and friendly, so he took the time to point Yang Kai in the right direction before grinning and saying, “However, are you sure you want to go to Maplewood City now and not join in the fun?”

“If I may ask, for what reason is this friend and all the others gathering?” Yang Kai asked with a puzzled look.

The middle-aged man smiled mysteriously, “Thirty thousand kilometres from here, someone in Clear Jade Mountain found a powerful Firebird that seems to be a sentient Artifact Spirit. Everyone is going there now to try to snatch that Artifact Spirit in the hopes of refining it.”

“A Firebird Artifact Spirit?” Yang Kai was shocked when he heard these words.

“If you want to go to Maplewood City, just fly in that direction, if you want to join in the fun though, you’d best hurry,” After the middle-aged man finished explaining, he urged his chariot forward quickly.

Yang Kai stood stunned in place as a burst of excitement filled his heart.

Although the other party’s description was not very clear, if it really was like he said, then it was possible that Liu Yan had appeared in this Clear Jade Mountain!

Liu Yan’s original form was that of a Firebird, and she was definitely an Artifact Spirit with sentience.

Liu Yan’s very existence was extremely attractive to all cultivators.

The reason was simple, it was not easy for Artifact Spirits to form, the process requiring both great opportunity and luck.
