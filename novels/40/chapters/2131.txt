When Wen Zi Shan said this, everyone immediately understood why a matter as trivial as the opening of the Four Seasons Realm could shock the Heaven’s Revelations Great Emperor.

The Heaven’s Revelations Great Emperor was involved when the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was overthrown. They were able to track the whereabouts of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor and saw his end with Heaven’s Revelations Great Emperor’s Divine Ability.

Otherwise, who would have dared to act rashly in front of the strongest master in the Star Boundary back then?

He would have been seeking his own death.

“What did Sir Heaven’s Revelations say?” Gao Xue Ting asked nervously.

Wen Zi Shan said, “It is not that serious, but it is quite unexpected for the Star Seal to appear in the Four Seasons Realm!”

“Star Seal?” Qiu Ran’s eyebrow jumped, “The ticket to enter the Shattered Star Sea?”

“Yes.”

“But...”

“I know what you want to say.” Wen Zi Shan waved his hand. “Over the years, the Star Seal has always appeared immediately prior to the opening of the Shattered Star Sea. It was unusual for the Star Seal to appear in one of the Sealed Worlds, but I assume it is probably a coincidence that this is happening at the same time as the opening of the Four Seasons Realm. Anyway, since it happened so suddenly, and we have been informed by Sir Heaven’s Revelation, we shall inform the disciples to work hard in searching for it. The number of Star Seals is related to the number of slots to enter the Shattered Star Sea, we absolutely cannot be careless about this.”

“What Sir Temple Master says does make sense,” Qiu Ran thought, nodded and said. “If that’s the case, I shall pass the order to the disciples to work hard. By the way, Sir Temple Master, since Azure Sun Temple received a message from Sir Heaven’s Revelations, the other great forces...”

“Anyone with a little bit of ability will definitely receive it.” Wen Zi Shan said.

“If that’s the case, the venture in the Four Seasons Realm will be many times more dangerous than before.” Qiu Ran could not help but reveal a worried look.

Wen Zi Shan smiled and said, “The seedlings must go through some rough patches, they can’t grow up if we’re always protecting them.”

“Sir Temple Master is right!” Qiu Ran said respectfully.

“Okay. Now that the situation has changed, we should depart earlier! Pass the order, gather everyone for departure tomorrow morning!” Wen Zi Shan said to Gao Xue Ting.

“Understood!” Gao Xue Ting replied.

Wen Zi Shan grinned and said, “Elder Gao, don’t forget what you have promised me...”

Gao Xue Ting’s pretty face changed slightly. She grit her teeth and said, “Does it have to be that way?”

Wen Zi Shan laughed sinisterly and said, “What’s wrong? You have to keep your word if you want to be a respectable person...”

Gao Xue Ting said bitterly, “Subordinate understands and will not disappoint Sir Temple Master!”

She finished her sentence with her jaw clenched, her beautiful eyes filled with bloody and tearful accusations!

“I’m looking forward to it!” Wen Zi Shan laughed loudly, he seemed to be in a good mood. In a blink of an eye, he disappeared.

Everyone cast curious looks at Gao Xue Ting, wondering what had happened between her and the Temple Master.

“Sister Gao...” Chen Qian said worriedly.

“There’s no need to speak, you’ll know tomorrow.” Gao Xue Ting was in an extremely bad mood, her emotions abnormal. Her chest inexplicably puffed violently as if she was in fury.

“Okay...!”

It was night when Yang Kai received the news for his departure to the Fallen Flower Peak the next morning.

To his surprise, it was Xiao Bai Yi who brought him the news.

He had no intention of any interaction and just left after passing on the message coldly.

It did not bother Yang Kai at all, but he secretly guessed that the advanced departure could have been related to what had happened during the day.

The next day, Yang Kai got up early and headed straight towards Fallen Flower Peak.

After a short while, he arrived at the square on top of the mountain.

Many people were already gathered there, some were Dao Source Realms, some were Emperor Realms, including Qiu Ran and Chen Qian whom he had met before, but they paid no attention to him after glancing at him.

However, the Dao Source Realm disciples were looking at him curiously.

It seems that the news of the battle between him and Xue Yi had spread among them, and everyone was very interested in him even as a stranger. Several people paled at the information that he was only a First-Order Dao Source Realm.

Xiao Bai Yi was among them but he did not even look at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai did not know anyone there and was not interested in making friends either, so he just waited quietly in a corner.

This was his first time witnessing disciples gathered in a big Sect ever since arriving in Star Boundary, but he was confident in his own abilities and did not feel intimidated.

As he waited quietly, someone approached him.

He turned his head to see an ordinary-looking young man in his twenties smiling at him.

The young man dressed very casually as well and did not possess any charisma. Such a person would not stand out in a crowd.

However, when he made his way towards Yang Kai, the few groups of disciples who were gathered stopped their chattering and turned their attention toward them.

Even a few Emperor Realm Masters noticed, including the young girl named Chen Qian, who had a look of worry on her face.

The young man stopped a short distance in front of Yang Kai, swept his eyes over him and broke into a bright and gentle smile, saying, “Are you the outsider who defeated Xue Yi?”

“I’m Yang Kai!” Yang Kai introduced himself while squinting at the man, giving him a sweep of his Divine Sense.

What changed Yang Kai’s indifferent expression was that he could not identify the level of the young man’s cultivation. It was as if he was non-existent after being scanned with Divine Sense. If Yang Kai did not see him with his own eyes, he would assume there was no one in front of him.

[This guy... is definitely not as ordinary as he looks!]

Combining the reactions of the surrounding disciples and Emperor Realms, Yang Kai privately deduced.

The young man smiled slightly and said, “So this is Brother Yang, I am Xia Sheng!”

“How can I help you, Brother Xia?” Yang Kai skipped the greeting and went straight to the point, maintaining vigilance.

“Nothing, I just want to chat,” Xia Sheng retained his bright smile and said. “I heard that Xue Yi was defeated by you, so I’m just a little curious.”

Yang Kai raised his brows, “Is Brother Xia planning to seek revenge for your fellow disciple?”

“Haha...” Xia Sheng laughed aloud, he waved his hand and said as if there was no one watching, “Don’t think like that, Brother Yang, I have no such intention. It’s just that... Although Xue Yi is crappy, considering that he was defeated by someone who has a cultivation a minor stage below him, Brother Yang’s abilities are not to be underestimated.”

At this point, Xia Sheng’s expression hardened. There was an enormous change in aura and demeanour, and he said in an arrogant and confident tone, “People like us are destined to dominate and become the overlords of the world, all of these old guys can kiss my foot...”

Yang Kai was speechless, trying hard to keep a straight face. The corners of his mouth twitched, feeling like something terrible was going to happen. As he had expected, a loud yell came from the side...

“Bastard!” Qiu Ran was furious and shouted at Xia Sheng, “I will tear your mouth open if you dare to speak such nonsense again!”

“Sir Deputy Temple Master...” Xia Sheng returned to his ordinary appearance again and said in a panic, “Disciple wasn’t referring to you, and I didn’t mean that... Please calm your nerves!”

Qiu Ran seemed to be familiar with Xia Sheng’s actions and did not really mean to teach him a lesson, but he did look extremely hurt by Xia Sheng’s words and sighed, “Subordinates imitate their superiors’ vices...”

But no one knew who was the superior he mentioned.

Xia Sheng looked at Yang Kai again, laughed, “Let me introduce myself again. Hello Brother Yang, I am Xia Sheng, ranked first place in the Sect’s martial arts challenge!”

“I had more or less guessed it.” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Xia Sheng gave a stronger aura than Xiao Bai Yi, who ranked second place in the Sect’s challenge, so it was no question that he would rank first.

“We will definitely meet again, so... let’s work hard together!” Xia Sheng said.

“Okay! Let’s hope Brother Xia won’t be too far behind.” Yang Kai smiled sinisterly.

The smile on Xia Sheng’s face slightly stiffened, but quickly recovered and grinned, “Interesting, interesting! Brother Yang is indeed fascinating, much more than Little Bai.”

Xiao Bai Yi, who was standing nearby spoke in anger, “Who are you calling Little Bai? I will challenge you to a fight now!”

Xia Sheng shrugged his shoulders, looking helpless.

A streak of violet light gleamed across the crowd.

Wen Zi Shan appeared. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He swept across the room wondering, “Isn’t Elder Gao leading the group? Why isn’t she here?”

Chen Qian stepped forward and replied, “Sister Gao should be here soon.”

“Women... so troublesome!” Wen Zi Shan muttered to himself. He looked upwards to the sky and smiled, “There she is.”

For some reason, he had a look of extreme anticipation that his eyes had a slight glow.

The crowd followed the direction of his gaze. Sure enough, a bright white light was zooming towards them at an incredible speed.

The white light descended and faded in front of everyone, revealing the alluring figure of Gao Xue Ting.

“Elder Gao, all the disciples have assembled. Do you...” Qiu Ran rushed toward Gao Xue Ting. After all, she was in charge of the expedition to the Four Seasons Realm Sealed World, she was also the one to lead the disciples to the entrance. However, due to unexpected reasons, there was still something that everyone needed to be informed of before departing, especially regarding the Sealed Star!

Before Qiu Ran could finish, he gaped at Gao Xue Ting with huge eyes as if he had seen a ghost, exclaiming inside, “This woman is NOT Elder Gao!”

The visual impact was so shocking that he almost blurted out, “Who the hell are you and how dare you impersonate the Elder Gao of our temple? Reveal yourself now!”

He swallowed his words before they came out, but the look on his face said it all.
