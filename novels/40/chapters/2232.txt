*Xiu xiu xiu...*

Yang Kai’s figure flickered from side to side. With the addition of his teleportation ability, he was literally randomly appearing and disappearing.

But he still couldn’t shake off the halberd that was hurled towards him.

The halberd rapidly approached Yang Kai.

At this critical moment, Yang Kai had no choice but to use his Spiritual Energy to furiously attack the halberd in an attempt to block it.

*Hong...*

A loud bang erupted as Yang Kai’s body shook and his face instantly darkened. However, the double-crescent halberd was completely unmoved and continued flying towards him.

Yang Kai’s desperate full-force attack was unable to even slow it down.

In the next moment, the double-crescent halberd landed not far away from Yang Kai’s body, digging itself halfway down into the earth. At the same time it landed, a shockwave exploded with it as its centre.

In just one breath, a ten-kilometre radius was filled with an invisible pressure that was so strong and domineering that Yang Kai could not help but feel a sense of despair as he was unable to resist it.

He wanted to teleport away again but was helpless to do so under this mysterious pressure. At the time, even his thoughts seemed to become slower.

In his field of view, Zhou Dian’s stalwart and tall figure walked over slowly, face as cold as ice.

In just a few moments, he arrived before Yang Kai and looked down at him contemptuously, coldly snorting, “Little brat, you’ve got some skills, but... that’s all you have!”

With that, he flicked his wrist and a bolt of energy shot out from his fingertips into Yang Kai’s body.

Yang Kai’s body stiffened. Instantly it felt as if his power was completely sealed and he was unable to move in the slightest.

This was it!

Yang Kai’s face turned ashen. Even though he knew he may not be able to escape under this Third-Order Emperor Realm Master’s pursuit, it was only now that he finally realized how insignificant he was when he was really caught.

If not for his teleportation ability, he would have been captured almost immediately.

A Third-Order Emperor was not something he could fight against right now.

With a flick of Zhou Dian’s hand, his halberd that was stuck into the ground flew back and was absorbed into his body.

This general of the Divine Ascension Country turned his head again and looked towards the direction of Heavenly Monster Valley, his expression fluctuating a few times before he heaved a sigh with endless regret. Hoisting up Yang Kai, he sped off towards the edge of Heavenly Monster Mountain.

He understood that since his Lord King decided to act personally, Yi Quan would have no chance.

The terror of his Lord King was something that even he, as someone who had followed him for so many years, was unable to comprehend.

If possible, Zhou Dian hoped that he would be the one to defeat Yi Quan, but he obviously would not get what he wanted this time.

But... What intrigued him even more was what secret Yang Kai held that drew his Lord King to leave the palace and take care of things personally. No matter how he looked at it, Yang Kai was nothing more than a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Junior with nothing out of the ordinary about him. If he had to say something, then this little brat’s escaping Secret Techniques were quite impressive.

If he hadn’t come after him himself and instead tasked Lian Yan with it, this brat would undoubtedly have slipped away already.

“Boy... Do you know what Lord King wants from you?” Zhou Dian suddenly asked.

Yang Kai was still feeling gloomy and answered in a frustrated tone, “I should be the one asking you that, right?”

But before he could finish speaking, his body stiffened and he revealed a painful look on his face. That was because Zhou Dian actually made a move in secret and shocked him, causing him soul-rending pain.

Realizing that he was currently under the eaves, Yang Kai didn’t dare to act too arrogantly either and could only say, “This Senior, have you got the wrong person? I heard you were looking for some Star of Calamity, but take a good look at me. Do I look like it?”

“This General is only in charge of catching people, everything else has nothing to do with me!” Zhou Dian responded coldly, after a while adding, “Let me ask you, where is Ban Qing? You encountered him previously, didn’t you? Why did he suddenly disappear?”

“Ban Qing? You’re talking about that short, sneaky guy?” Yang Kai pretended to play dumb and randomly blurted, “He was killed by a Monster Race Master.”

Upon hearing this, a cold light flashed in Zhou Dian’s eyes as near tangible murderous intent leaked from his body, causing Yang Kai to shiver.

But very soon, he retracted the murderous aura and coldly snorted, “This debt will be settled sooner or later!”

He did not ask Yang Kai too much, nor did he suspect that Ban Qing had died at Yang Kai’s hands as he felt that was simply impossible.

Only the Monster Race Masters here would be capable of killing Ban Qing.

An hour later, Zhou Dian took Yang Kai back to the place where he had set up camp.

At this moment, the Masters who followed Zhou Dian into Heavenly Monster Mountain had almost all gathered here. Yu Man, Yuan Qing, and even Lian Yan who had escaped from Heavenly Monster Valley earlier were present. Only Ban Qing was missing.

And, right next to these people, was a group of helpless and dispirited-looking people who had been captured and gathered here.

When they saw Zhou Dian return, all of them quickly saluted him.

“Take everyone and head back to the palace!” Zhou Dian gave an order and they gave a resounding response. When he said this, he casually tossed Yang Kai into the group of captured people.

Chen Mu Ji secretly gave Yang Kai a hand so that he wouldn’t fall to the ground, then he nodded lightly at him.

Yang Kai looked around and immediately saw his other ‘Brothers’ and ‘Sister’ in turmoil. When they met each other’s eyes, neither of them could help but laugh bitterly.

None of them had expected to be caught by the local cultivators here after just one month of entering the Divine Ascension Mirror World.

The group moved quickly, and within ten breaths of Zhou Dian’s order, they were already on their way to Divine Ascension City.

Along the way, Yang Kai did not dare to exchange information with the others and could only keep silent.

Even now he had no idea why he and the others were captured, and what that Star of Calamity that Ban Qing mentioned was...

But he could see that this was a very big matter, otherwise, there would be no need to send so many Masters. Even Zhou Dian’s masked Lord King had to come out himself.

Yang Kai vaguely felt as if he had dropped into a huge whirlpool and would not be able to get out on his own.

.....

A day later.

Heavenly Monster Valley.

Yi Quan sat cross-legged and adjusted his breathing, his face twitching slightly. Many Monster Race Masters were looking at him with worried faces, all scattered around on high alert.

Yesterday, Yi Quan fought with Zhou Dian first before getting sneak attacked by the strange masked man, consuming much of his strength.

In addition, he was also wounded by Zhou Dian during the masked man’s sudden appearance and ended up receiving many injuries from the battle after that.

If the masked man was strong enough to crush Yi Quan, then Heavenly Monster Mountain would have lost its Lord and would no longer exist!

Fortunately, it seemed as if the masked man’s only purpose was to capture Yang Kai and had no intentions of eradicating Heavenly Monster Valley, so he only fought Yi Quan for a short while before retreating. Even so, the wounds Yi Quan sustained were not something that could be healed overnight.

While he was silently adjusting his breathing, Bai Lu’s shout suddenly entered his ears, “Who goes there!”

Yi Quan opened his eyes in a flash and gazed straight ahead.

There, a white-bearded old man with absolutely no energy fluctuations around his body stood, appearing just like a mortal who had never cultivated.

Yi Quan had no idea where this old man came from, but upon his arrival, he immediately headed towards him.

The Monster Race Masters naturally did not stand idly by. Yi Quan was currently in a critical moment of recovery and could not be disturbed. Whether this old man was friend or foe, they could not let him approach any closer.

So, after shouting those words, Bai Lu’s body shifted and rushed towards the old man in a stream of white light.

But what shocked her was that despite clearly intending to rush in front of and block this old man, when she came to a stop where she intended to, she actually found herself inexplicably just out of arm’s reach of him.

*Xiu xiu xiu...*

Countless Monster Race Masters also moved to intercept this old man.

But none of them succeeded.

All the Masters who rushed towards the old man appeared not where they expected to, their eyes bulging wide as if they had seen something extremely terrifying in that brief moment.

None of them saw any signs of this old man doing anything, but all of them had failed to even stand in his way.

The old man seemed to be strolling casually, but in the blink of an eye, he had already arrived before Yi Quan and was gazing down at him.

“You...” Yi Quan frowned and muttered, observing the man seriously, a bewildered look appearing on his face, but a moment later, his eyes flashed a brilliant light as if he had recalled something and he called out in astonishment, “You are...”

The old man raised his hand slightly to stop Yi Quan before placing it lightly on Yi Quan’s shoulder.

A stream of pure energy slowly poured into Yi Quan’s body.

Even a person as strong as Yi Quan could not help but reveal a look of comfort as the heavy injuries on his body were being relieved under the nourishment of this power.

A short while later, the old man removed his hand.

Yi Quan was shocked to find that the injuries to his body were mostly healed, all he needed now was some time to condition himself and there would be absolutely no dark injuries left. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Rising to his feet, he cupped his fists respectfully to the old man in front of him and lowered his head, “Junior Yi Quan greets Senior, many thanks to Senior for his assistance!”

Once these words came out, the entire Heavenly Monster Valley turned dead silent.

Countless Monster Race Masters stared at Yi Quan in shock, unable to believe what they had just heard.

Yi Quan was undoubtedly one of the strongest Masters in this world, and also one of the highest-ranking; however, he had just called himself ‘Junior’ in front of this old human man.

Since that was the case, just what kind of seniority did this old man possess? Just who was he?

The Monster Race Masters were completely dumbfounded.

“If you recognize this old Master, then you should know why I am here,” The old man finally spoke and looked seriously at Yi Quan, “Where is he?”

Yi Quan wore a look of shame and responded, “He was taken away!”

The old man raised his brow slightly, “Who took him away, and to where?”

“To Divine Ascension Country’s palace!”

The old man nodded lightly and said, “It seems like I was still a step too late, but so be it, this old Master will just have to take another short trip!”

As soon as he said that, his body suddenly blurred and then faded away, completely disappearing three breaths later.

Yi Quan stood still in the same place with a look of awe on his face, but soon, he couldn’t help letting out a loud laugh like roaring thunder, spreading throughout Heavenly Monster Valley, drawing the attention of countless Monster Race and Monster Beasts.
