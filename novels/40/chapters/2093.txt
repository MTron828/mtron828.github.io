After swearing an oath on his heart demon, the middle-aged man extended his hand coldly towards Qin Zhao Yang.

“Where are the Source Crystals?” Qin Zhao Yang asked with a gloomy expression on his face.

The middle-aged man sneered. “It’s just a mere million Source Crystals. Are you afraid that this king can’t pay up?”

As he said those words, he immediately retrieved a Space Ring from his robes. After making some slight arrangements, he tossed it to Qin Zhao Yang.

Catching it, Qin Zhao Yang examined it in detail. After making sure that the amount was correct, he retrieved an empty jade slip, sent his Divine Sense into it and transferred the complete formation method for the Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array.

After that, he tossed that jade slip to the middle-aged man.

The man suppressed the emotions surging out from his heart as he caught the jade slip. After checking its contents, a look of delight instantly appeared on his face, before he put it carefully with a hearty chuckle.

Clearly, he was extremely satisfied with the results of this trade, to the point that he seemed to have forgotten about the earlier unhappiness.

“Everyone, we should increase our speed. Otherwise, we will get surrounded,” All of a sudden, Yang Kai’s solemn voice gave everyone a wake-up call.

Sweeping their Divine Sense outwards, everyone discovered that it had only taken that short period of time when they were occupied with their conflict to be surrounded by a horde of countless demonic creatures like a tightly-knitted ball.

“Just a bunch of pitiful weaklings!” With a roar, Duan Yuan Shan suddenly formed seals with his hands.

As everyone was connected to the Spirit Array, Duan Yuan Shan’s movements made the others have no choice but to closely follow suit and take action.

The gigantic Divine Spirit projection suddenly opened its large mouth, before dense water elements from the surroundings converged in a berserk fashion. In the blink of an eye, a gigantic ball of water appeared before the dragon head.

As Duan Yuan Shan’s muffled roar rang out, it was as if someone took control of the Divine Spirit as it opened its mouth wide and spit.

The gigantic ball of water transformed into a beam of white light that travelled straight forward. Smashing everything in its path like rotten wood, its might couldn’t be obstructed, as countless demonic creatures were killed in an instant, disintegrating into nothingness.

A safe passage spanning over a thousand metres appeared before them.

Without saying a word, Duan Yuan Shan took the lead and rushed forwards, everyone following suit behind him.

The City Lord’s heart seemed to be filled with fury towards that middle-aged man. However, in their current situation, they couldn’t have a falling out with that man, so the only thing he could do was to let all of his anger out on those demonic creatures.

As the situation changed, the demonic creatures that had surrounded the group seemed to also become affected, lunging at them with total disregard for their lives as they continued to unleash various kinds of attacks at the Spirit Array.

If one was to observe from afar, they would see dense numbers of demonic creatures around the gigantic body of the Black Tortoise projection. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Nevertheless, this was still unable to stop the group’s advance.

After approximately half an hour, the group finally arrived at the original location of the mine.

Although everything within a thousand kilometres of here was filled with jet-black Demon Qi, there was a certain location where the Demon Qi was much denser. There was a black pillar of energy shooting straight up into the sky, connecting Heaven and Earth; it was a soul-stirring sight for anyone who laid eyes on it. Like an open tap, unimaginably pure Demon Qi gushed out from it continuously, spreading out in all directions.

There was no need to warn anyone in the group; when they saw that jet-black energy pillar that shot up towards the sky, all of them naturally knew that it was the origin, and should also be where the seal was located.

Taking the lead, Duan Yuan Shan rapidly flew towards it.

However, as they approached the location, everyone felt the rate at which Source Qi was flowing out of their bodies started to gradually increase. After a moment of shock, everyone proceeded to retrieve restorative Spirit Pills, consuming them to maintain the circulation of their bodies’ energies.

All of a sudden, Duan Yuan Shan’s advance came to a halt, frowning as he looked before him.

Less than ten feet away, several dozen powerful auras were standing quietly, as though they had been waiting for the group for a very long time.

Right at the instant when the group stopped in their tracks, these figures let off simultaneous roars, before rushing forwards in a storm-like manner.

The resulting berserk energies reached the Dao Source Realm level, with the only thing lacking being the mobilization of Principles.

“They’re Jiang Family members!” Yang Kai roared fiercely after narrowing his eyes to look before him.

“Die, you bastards!” Duan Yuan Shan changed his hand seals. In response, the Divine Spirit Black Tortoise projection raised its foreleg and swept out fiercely towards the front.

BANG...

The slap sent two figures flying, exploding into blood mist in midair, their bodies disintegrating into nothingness. Nevertheless, the other enemies managed to nimbly evade the attack.

The group of Jiang Family Origin King realm members had their strength increased by the Demon Qi. Nevertheless, despite reaching a level of strength that rivalled Dao Source Realms, how could they match up to the group which was already displaying their Spirit Array?

With the activation of the Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array, the Source Qi from the seven Dao Source Realm masters were combined into one, and among them, two were Third-Order Dao Source Realm masters.

The palm strike from the Black Tortoise projection was equivalent to a simultaneous strike from seven people!

“It’s that brat, Jiang Lin!” Positioned on the left side of the Spirit Array, Du Li Shen’s gaze landed on a demon rushing forward, with jet-black eyes and a body covered in Demon Crests. Instantly, he recognised that demon, and it was shockingly the Jiang Family’s patriarch: Jiang Lin!

Clearly, Jiang Lin had already fully lost consciousness, as the miserable death of his family’s elders did not incite any fear in him. On the contrary, it stimulated his bloodlust, causing the Demon Qi around his body to surge as he unleashed various highly powerful Secret Techniques to strike the Spirit Array.

His frenzied state of madness frightened Du Li Shen, causing Du Li Shen’s speed of forming hand seals to subconsciously slow down.

Any slight mistake by anyone within the Spirit Array would affect the entire Array. Due to him slowing down, it had risked causing disruptions for the others.

This instantly incited the anger of the middle-aged man, who shot a fierce glare at Du Li Shen and roared, “Do you wish to die, old man! If you feel that you’ve lived too long, this king doesn’t mind fulfilling your wish!”

“It’s a mistake, it’s a mistake!” Sorrow and dejection filled Du Li Shen’s heart as he hastily gave a reply. Giving a shaky smile, he promptly suppressed the shock in his heart and proceeded to adjust his position and state of mind.

There were several dozen Origin King Realm masters that were turned into demons, each with the ability to fight against Dao Source Realm masters. Anywhere else, this would have been quite a powerful lineup. However, they might as well have been children when facing off against the Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array.

With its gigantic frame, the Divine Spirit projection was invincible, sweeping everything before it. The reason behind the lack of technique in its actions was merely due to everyone commanding it to constantly wave its forelegs, smashing every demon that rushed over into mush and blood mists.

From the start to the end, the fight lasted a mere several dozen breaths, with the Jiang Family higher-ups being completely wiped out, leaving Jiang Lin as the only one left alive.

Unexpectedly, he did not initiate any attacks. Instead, he hid his body within the swirling Demon Qi, all while continuing to send roars out, commanding the endless demonic creatures in his surroundings in an attempt to obstruct the group’s progress.

Nevertheless, how could these demonic creatures of varying strength serve any purpose other than becoming cannon fodder?

Rivers of blood formed alongside piles of corpses.

After a full hour, the group finally arrived at the origin of the Demon Qi.

The ground had been smashed apart, and a pile of rubble stood where the mine entrance was, a result from the massive explosion of Demon Qi. This forced the group to dig a hole, all while fighting against demonic creatures, before finally jumping into the mineshaft.

Having previously seen the location of the seal, Yang Kai was naturally familiar with the directions. Through his lead, the group travelled through the twisting tunnel, spending yet another half an hour before reaching the location of the seal.

After cleaning the place up, they finally located the wall where the seal was located.

“Did we find it?” Duan Yuan Shan asked in delight.

“This should be it.” Upon seeing the wall covered with Demon Crests, Qin Yu, who had been protected in the centre of the group throughout the journey, nodded in response, eyes sparkling.

She had managed to catch a faint glimpse of the patterns from Jiang Chu He’s Knowledge Sea. Being an extremely ancient seal, she only had a smattering of understanding of it.

Fortunately, the damage to the seal was only limited to a corner, so repairing it was barely within her capabilities.

“Hurry up and take action!” The middle-aged man urged impatiently.

With a smile, Hua Qing Si said, “What are you afraid of, sir?”

Shooting her a look, the middle-aged man snorted. “It isn’t that this king is afraid, but these other trash are lacking in strength. If we get delayed here for too long, even though this king and you can endure, do you think they can?”

“What sir said makes a lot of sense.” Hua Qin Si giggled.

Upon hearing those words, displeased looks appeared on everyone’s faces!

For better or for worse, everyone here was a Dao Source Realm master. Although they couldn’t rule Maplewood City and the area ten thousand kilometres around it with absolute power, they were first-rate figures at the very least. Yet, at this moment, they had actually been treated like trash by the middle-aged man.

Feelings of unhappiness surfaced in everyone’s hearts, yet they felt too embarrassed to reveal it openly, so they were forced to silently curse the middle-aged man in their hearts.

“I need you all to temporarily disperse the Demon Qi here. If not, I will be unable to repair the seal!” Qin Yu suddenly spoke out.

The broken part of the seal was the source of the Demon Qi. It could be said that the Demon Qi coming out from there was incredibly pure, something that Qin Yu, with her Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation, was utterly incapable of dealing with!

“Use the might of the Divine Spirit to suppress it!” Qin Zhao Yang roared out.

Flashes of understanding appeared in everyone’s minds as they proceeded to take action.

As they formed more and more hand seals, the group started to move. After a short while, the gigantic Divine Spirit projection pressed itself right on top of the seal.

The rate at which Demon Qi surged out instantly slowed down, as though it had encountered an obstruction, before finally being unable to flow out at all.

Nevertheless, exceedingly ugly expressions appeared on everyone’s faces.

That was due to their consumption of Source Qi. After using the strength of the Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array to suppress the broken part of the seal, everyone discovered that Source Qi started to gush out from their bodies like a torrent from a broken dam, pouring out at a frenzied rate.

The speed of energy consumption was simply akin to unleashing Secret Techniques without any regard for their life, something that probably no one could handle.

The faces of the First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators turned pale.

“Little Yu’er, approximately how long do you need to repair the seal?” Du Li Shen asked with a bitter expression on his face.

Continuing to focus on the seal, various kinds of precious materials used to repair seals appeared in Qin Yu’s hands. “It’ll take at least half an hour!”

“Half an hour...” The look on Du Li Shen’s face grew even more bitter.

“Our success or failure rests on this! Everyone, please do not drop your guard!” Duan Yuan Shan roared out loudly in an attempt to boost the group’s morale.

Hearing his words, everyone had no choice but to clench their teeth and summon their strength, all while constantly shoving various kinds of restorative Spirit Pills into their mouths.

“A bunch of trash!” Seeing this, a look of ridicule and disdain surfaced on the face of the middle-aged man, while showing the relaxed state he was in.

Being a powerful Third-Order Dao Source Realm master, the quantity and quality of the Source Qi was several dozen times greater than that of Du Li Shen and the other First-Order Dao Source Realm masters, therefore he naturally did not need to worry too much about the increase in Source Qi consumption.

“Sir, have you done a detailed analysis into this Seven Points Black Tortoise Array?” All of a sudden, Hua Qing Si asked a question out of nowhere while sporting a somewhat mocking smile on her pretty face.
