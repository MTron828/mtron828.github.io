!!

[Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!] Yin Xin Zhao roared inwardly. He originally wanted to make use of Yang Kai’s spy in the Prison League to easily obtain the top spot in the Dao Theory Assembly. Who could have known that he would be besieged by the enemy in this place instead? It would seem that he was doomed to die today.

*Chi…*

A soft sound suddenly came from behind him. He quickly turned to look back before a look of extreme panic appeared on his face.

Not far away, the Prison League’s League Master, Yellow Spring Heavenly Monarch, Huang Quan, was holding a sharp longsword in his hand. The longsword had pierced right through Zhuang Wei’s heart. Following a violent burst of World Force, the impact turned Zhuang Wei’s body into a bloody mess with all his internal organs destroyed.

“Senior Brother Yin… Sa… Save me!” Zhuang Wei stuttered, spewing fragments of his organs out of his mouth as his vitality swiftly dissipated.

Huang Quan withdrew his sword and with the flash of a sword light, Zhuang Wei’s head flew into the sky and blood gushed out from his neck like a fountain.

Dazzling golden light flew out of the golden wristband around Zhuang Wei’s wrist and plunged into Huang Quan’s wrist. The black band around Huang Quan’s wrist was originally empty, but now dozens of stars instantly lit up after the golden light poured into his wrist. All of Zhuang Wei’s achievements during this period had been transferred over to him.

Flicking off the blood on his long sword, Huang Quan smiled lightly and asked, “How would you like to die, little friends?”

Both Yin Xin Zhao and Pei Wen Xuan felt chills running down their bodies upon hearing those words.

…..

*Pu…*

Yang Kai coughed up fresh blood and stumbled to the ground weakly. Although he had managed to break through the Void and escape at the last moment, the attacks from numerous Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters had followed him across space. Even if his flesh and skin were tough, he was still hit so badly that he coughed up blood continuously.

Similarly, Mo Sheng collapsed headfirst to the ground next to him, his aura fluctuating unsteadily. Hui Gu, whom he had been carrying this while, rolled out of his arms and lay to the side motionlessly.

Hui Gu’s aura might be weak, but he was not dead. He was the most severely wounded among them all; however, the vitality of a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was so strong that he would not die so quickly.

“Wu Kuang!” Yang Kai gritted his teeth and looked at the guy named Mo Sheng in front of him.

“Who?” Mo Sheng grinned and sat cross-legged on the ground, surging his strength to heal his wounds.

“You still want to pretend!?” Yang Kai gnashed his teeth.

He would not have dared to confirm that this person in front of him was Wu Kuang if the other party’s actions had not exposed him at the last moment. Be it in terms of appearance or even aura, this person was completely different from the Wu Kuang in his memories. Nevertheless, only people who were very familiar with Yang Kai would have known that his mastery over the Dao of Space was their only hope of escape in that dire situation.

Without question or hesitation, this Mo Sheng immediately dragged Hui Gu over to Yang Kai, so it was obvious that he wanted Yang Kai to bring him along. He would never have done that if he were an actual Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm cultivator from Myriad Demons Heaven; after all, the only person a real Myriad Demons Heaven disciple could rely on at that time would have been Pei Wen Xuan.

“Do you dare to deny it?” Yang Kai pointed his spear at the other party, “Do you believe I won’t stab you to death with my spear!”

Mo Sheng calmly stared at Yang Kai for a while before he reached out, pushed the Azure Dragon Spear away, and chuckled lightly, “If you’re so sure, then why do you keep trying to sound me out with your words?”

Yang Kai was stunned, “So, it really is you.”

Although he was quite sure that the person in front of him was Wu Kuang, he still couldn’t help feeling incredulous when the other party personally confirmed the fact; after all, the perception of his Divine Sense indicated that this person did not contain the slightest bit of Wu Kuang’s aura.

“I guess it’s true that good people don’t live long while a scourge lasts a thousand years!” Yang Kai clicked his tongue.

“It takes one to know one. You’re not much better yourself.” Wu Kuang sneered softly.

The two of them looked at each other for a moment before they broke out into laughter, only for Wu Kuang to suddenly stop laughing and comment, “Alright enough. If you laugh any longer, this guy is going to die.”

Yang Kai slapped his forehead lightly in response. Hurrying over to Hui Gu, he examined the latter’s wounds and furrowed his brow tightly. Hui Gu was badly injured. He might not be in danger of dying at the moment, but he would die tragically if his injuries were left untreated much longer.

Yang Kai quickly took out some healing pills and stuffed them into Hui Gu’s mouth. Afterward, he summoned his Towering Evergreen Divine Manifestation. An ancient tree immediately appeared behind his back, its branches hanging low as wisps of green light filled with vitality flitted about its leaves.

After advancing into the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, Yang Kai’s control over this Wood Element Divine Manifestation became more and more effortless. The ancient tree behind him was not that large, only big enough to cover the three of them, making it more convenient for them to heal from their wounds.

Wu Kuang opened his eyes and took a look, but didn’t pay any more attention to the phenomenon a moment later.

However, Yang Kai soon noticed something strange. Judging by the power leaking out from Wu Kuang’s body, he was not a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, but a Sixth-Order one!

Yang Kai was absolutely dumbfounded!

It was not Wu Kuang’s advancement into the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm that was shocking to him of course as Wu Kuang was supremely talented and many years had passed since he left the Star Boundary. Furthermore, Wu Kuang entered one of the top great forces like Myriad Demons Heaven. What was shocking was how he managed to conceal his cultivation!

Prior to this, Yang Kai had clearly sensed that the fluctuations from Wu Kuang’s attacks were only in the Fifth-Order. Not to mention that Myriad Demons Heaven had allowed him to participate in the Dao Theory Assembly, which could only mean that he was nothing more than a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master in the eyes of the Myriad Demons Heaven Elders. Hence, he was a dispensable pawn!

[Wu Kuang must have an extremely top-notch method or artifact; otherwise, he would have been exposed a long time ago.]

An incense stick later, Yang Kai stood up after helping to stabilize Hui Gu’s injuries, “Help me watch him. I’m going to get Lu Jing.”

Hui Gu’s identity had been exposed, so their previous hiding place was no longer safe. If the Prison League headed towards their hiding place, Lu Jing would be in danger. A Sixth-Order Yang Element treasure was at stake, so Yang Kai could not simply ignore Lu Jing.

Wu Kuang opened his eyes to look at Yang Kai, but did not speak. Seeing as he did not say a word, that could only mean he had no objections.

Yang Kai left in a flash, taking less than an hour to arrive at their previous hiding place. After confirming that there were no ambushes nearby, he carefully brought Lu Jing out from and returned to their new hiding place.

Lu Jing was startled to see Hui Gu with such a weak aura and covered in blood.

On the other hand, Wu Kuang was nowhere to be seen. All he left behind was a single jade slip.

Yang Kai picked up the jade slip and checked the contents. The contents immediately set his teeth itching with hatred! He initially hoped to inquire about the mystery behind Wu Kuang’s hidden cultivation after he brought Lu Jing over, but how could he have known that Wu Kuang would flee in advance?

He had the vague feeling that Wu Kuang did not want to expose the relationship between them in front of others. With no other choice, he could only give up on his intentions. In any case, he now knew that Wu Kuang was in Myriad Demons Heaven, so it would not be too late to search for another opportunity to contact him in the future.

…..

A couple hundred thousand kilometres away, a black cloud churned violently and landed among a small group of six to reveal Wu Kuang’s figure.

The six-man team consisted of two Fifth-Order and four Fourth-Order Masters. They couldn’t help feeling shocked when they noticed somebody blocking their path. Then, they took a good look at the other party. The person blocking their path was drenched in blood and had a very pale complexion. It was obvious to see that he was badly injured; therefore, they simply looked at each other in confusion.

The Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master in the lead cupped his fist in greeting, “So it is a Senior Brother from Myriad Demons Heaven. Dare I ask how we may help you, Senior Brother?”

Judging from the energy fluctuations coming from the Demon Qi Cloud earlier, this person was most likely in the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm. That was why this team of participants were not too apprehensive despite recognising Wu Kuang as a member of Myriad Demons Heaven. They had two Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters on their side after all.

Wu Kuang greedily swept his gaze over the six people and chuckled softly, “I’ve been restrained for so long. I’m finally free now.”

“What did you say, Senior Brother?” The leading Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master scowled deeply. The stare Wu Kuang gave him made him feel extremely uncomfortable, it was like being stared at by a starving beast which had found a mouth-watering meal.

...

“The end of life is just the beginning of reincarnation, and death is not the only ending.”

“Senior Brother?” The leading Fifth-Order Open Heaven frowned even more, shooting a warning look at his companions as he spoke.

“Instead of struggling and suffering in the midst of all living beings, it is better to die and be liberated.”

All six people were speechless and gazed at Wu Kuang strangely, [Is this guy insane? What is he muttering to himself?]

“You are very lucky to have met this King. Now, become one with me! I will grant you immortality!” Wu Kuang opened his arms and the Demon Cloud behind his back transformed into a black screen that covered the sky.

The World fell silent.

A short while later, the Demon Cloud began to converge again to reveal Wu Kuang’s figure while the six people from before were gone. He licked his lips, a hint of colour appearing in his pale complexion. Turning around, he looked in another direction before his body transformed into a black cloud once more and vanished into the distance.

…..

Inside the new hiding place, Hui Gu slowly woke up. He couldn’t help coughing slightly. As his chaotic thoughts slowly cleared up, he recalled everything that transpired earlier. He looked up to see Yang Kai sitting beside him and looking at him in concern.

“Sir!” He struggled to get out of bed.

Yang Kai pressed him down again, “Your injuries are very serious. Focus on recovering. Don’t move about recklessly for the time being.”

...

“Many thanks, Sir.” Hui Gu coughed a few more times before he continued with a look of regret, “Sir, please forgive me. I failed to carry out my duties properly.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “That Yellow Spring Heavenly Monarch is not a simple man. This is not your fault. It’s a pity about what happened to Bai Mo!”

“Bai Mo…” Hui Gu’s expression was heavy. He spoke through gritted teeth, “I will personally avenge Bai Mo’s death one day.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Yang Kai nodded, “It’s good if you can think that way. This place is relatively safe for the time being, so you can rest and recuperate here. I need to go out for a bit.” After saying that, he stood up and patted Lu Jing on the shoulder, “Help me take care of Hui Gu. I’ll be back soon.”

Lu Jing nodded. He knew that a Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master like him had no role to play on the Prison Star; thus, he would only become a burden if he followed Yang Kai around. At present, his only wish was to leave the Prison Star alive.

A few hours later, Yang Kai returned to the mountain valley where he had been ambushed before. Several days might have passed, but the traces of the battle in this place remained clearly visible.

There was a lot of blood on the ground, but not a single corpse. Judging by the situation from before where they were surrounded on all sides, it would have been impossible for Yin Xin Zhao and Pei Wen Xuan to escape death. Even Yang Kai could only hope to escape under those circumstances, so what need be said about others?

Yang Kai was overjoyed!

Both Yin Xin Zhao and Pei Wen Xuan held deep grudges against him, so his greatest wish in this place was for them to die at the hands of the Prison League. The process might have been a little different from what he initially planned, but the results were the same. It could be said that he had successfully carried out a murder with a borrowed knife!

In addition, Zhuang Wei, who had obtained more stars than himself earlier, was dead. With his current achievement, it was obvious that none of the Dao Theory Assembly participants could compare with him. As long as he could hold on to his achievements, it should not be a problem for him to win first place.
