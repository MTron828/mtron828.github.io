Chapter 1631, Chance Encounter

“Everything will be fine as long as you remain obedient!” Yang Kai showed a faint smile, pausing for a moment before following up, “I will warn you now, I could crush this boat and everyone on it to dust with a snap of my fingers; after all, the old fogey with the highest strength here is nothing but a First-Order Origin Returning Realm weakling. However, I am merciful and do not enjoy slaughtering the innocent. So, if you care for your family and friends, you’d best not annoy me. Lest you suffer the consequences.”

The girl’s beautiful eyes trembled as she nodded repeatedly.

Yang Kai casually stating the realm of the strongest person on board had made the young girl realise just how scary the young man in front of her was.

Naturally, she wasn’t going to act carelessly with her and her clansmen’s lives.

Yang Kai released her a moment later, and sure enough, the young girl no longer tried to scream, instead just choosing to stare at him apprehensively without saying a word.

“Okay. There is no need to be afraid. Although I will not claim to be a good person, I am also not someone wicked either, as long as you cooperate, there will be some benefits for you,” Yang Kai finally comforted.

This young girl’s courage apparently wasn’t small, and after recovering from her initial fright, and seeing the amiable look on Yang Kai’s face, she truly calmed down, but she still didn’t dare to speak at will and just stood there uneasily.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense next to carefully scan his surroundings before formulating a hypothesis for why he had appeared here.

Originally, he had hidden the Sealed World Bead at the bottom of a river, but now, it seemed it had somehow found its way into this little girl’s hands.

The exact chain of events was of course still a mystery to Yang Kai, but that did not really matter.

The other party’s cultivation only reached the Third-Order Transcendent Realm, meaning she was not even a Saint yet. She was slender and looked a bit delicate.

“Where is this place and who are you?” Yang Kai focused his attention, found a chair to sit down in, and asked the girl.

The girl gulped before suppressing the panic in her heart and replied with a trembling voice, “Reporting to Senior, this is Thorn Lake, and we are from the Wang Family.”

[Thorn Lake, Wang Family!] Yang Kai naturally hadn’t heard these names before, but he figured it was the territory of some family on this Cultivation Star.

Once again, this did not really matter to Yang Kai. Now that he had exited the Sealed World Bead, his first task was to find out if Luo Hai was still on Scarlet Wave Star.

Although Yang Kai figured he had been here for more than a year now, and Luo Hai had probably given up searching for him, he could not act carelessly or act too overtly. This was why he had forced this young girl to cooperate with him; he needed to gather some intelligence from her.

It was unlikely that this little girl would know much, but seeing how Luo Hai was a Second-Order Origin King, his every move would be very eye-catching, so there was a chance this girl had at least heard some useful rumours.

“En, what Cultivation Star is this?” Yang Kai asked again.

“Scarlet Wave Star!” The girl looked at Yang Kai in amazement, her beautiful eyes full of curiosity.

“Scarlet Wave Star?” Yang Kai frowned for a moment but quickly recalled the many dealings he had with cultivators from this Cultivation Star. Without even mentioning Brilliant Flame Sect and Ice Heart Valley, just Xu Ding Yang he had met in the Blood Prison seemed to be from Scarlet Wave Star.

Before Xu Ding Yang died, he had asked Yang Kai to go to Blue Feather Sect to inform them of his death.

Coincidentally, Yang Kai had come to this very Cultivation Star.

“Is the Scarlet Wave Star occupied by Brilliant Flame Sect and Ice Heart Valley?”

“Yes,” The girl nodded, “Brilliant Flame Sect and Ice Heart Valley are the two most powerful Sects on Scarlet Wave Star and both have an Origin King Realm master who commands them.”

After answering several of Yang Kai’s questions, the girl’s mood settled greatly and she became bolder, even taking the initiative to come forward and pour Yang Kai a glass of water.

She could tell now that Yang Kai was not some kind of villain.

“Both have Origin Kings overseeing them!” Yang Kai was surprised. He didn’t know much about these two Sects but judging from the strength of the people he had come into contact with, it wasn’t too much of a shock that they possessed masters of such level.

“Then is there a force called Blue Feather Sect here?” Yang Kai asked next.

The girl’s beautiful eyes brightened for a moment, “Does Senior have some friendship with Blue Feather Sect?”

“Not exactly, answer my question!”

The girl’s expression changed slightly as she nodded and quickly replied, “En, our Wang Family is attached to Blue Feather Sect.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his brow, “Is that true?”

“Junior dares not deceive Senior,” The girl bit her red lips.

“Then tell me, what is the name of Blue Feather Sect’s Sect Master?”

“Sect Master Xu Ding Yang!”

Yang Kai gently nodded. Observing this young girl’s words and expressions, he could tell that she was not deceiving him. After confirming that the other party was not lying to him, Yang Kai thought about it for a moment before he took out a Space Ring and handed it to her.

“Senior, this is...”

“Your Blue Feather Sect’s Sect Master died in the Blood Prison. This is his Space Ring. I only met him by chance right before the end, at that point, he requested I inform Blue Feather Sect about his death if I ever visited Scarlet Wave Star. Now that I have met you here though, I shall hand this task over to you. If you bring this Space Ring to Blue Feather Sect, they will naturally be able to confirm its authenticity.”

“Sect Master died?” The girl was shocked.

In her opinion, the cultivation of Blue Feather Sect’s Sect Master was extremely profound, higher than she would ever be able to reach. Yet, now, she was hearing that such a powerful master had actually fallen.

The young could not help feeling a bit dazed!

Yang Kai gave her some time to digest this news before he asked, “What is your name?”

“Junior is called Wang Ying!”

“En,” Yang Kai nodded, “Wang Ying, what important matters have happened on Scarlet Wave Star recently? Has some powerful foreign master arrived here?”

“A powerful master?” Wang Ying was at a loss and shook her head, “Junior doesn’t know, but if it is about important matters, there really has been something occurring recently.”

“Let’s hear it.”

Wang Ying proceeded to tell him about how Brilliant Flame Sect and Ice Heart Valley were both searching for someone.

Although Wang Ying didn’t know what person Brilliant Flame Sect and Ice Heart Valley were looking for, or even what they looked like exactly, she had heard rumours that it was a young man in his twenties or thirties.

Hearing this, Yang Kai realized the situation was not optimistic.

[Could the one they were looking for be me? The timing at least matched when I arrived on Scarlet Wave Star.]

Brilliant Flame Sect looking for him, Yang Kai could understand; after all, in the Blood Prison, Yang Kai had heard that the Supreme Elder of Brilliant Flame Sect had some friendship with Luo Hai. If Luo Hai was still on Scarlet Wave Star, he would definitely seek assistance from Brilliant Flame Sect.

But why was Ice Heart Valley looking for him as well?

Yang Kai had some intersection with the people from Ice Heart Valley, but that was only a small incident back in the Emperor Garden. There were no grievances between him and Ice Heart Valley, so why were they interested in finding him?

Word of the Emperor Artifact and Origin Essence Crystal would never have been leaked. Luo Hai’s entire purpose was to obtain these two treasures, so how could he possibly tell anyone else about them? Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yang Kai thought about it but couldn’t figure out the whole story.

“Senior...” Wang Ying could not help calling out when Yang Kai stopped talking for some time.

“En, I’m very satisfied with your answers, this is for you,” Yang Kai said as he placed a small package on a nearby desk before casually getting up and with a flicker, disappearing from the room.

Wang Ying did not even see how he moved.

Stunned for a moment, Wang Ying soon took a deep breath as she felt a great pressure suddenly lift from her shoulders.

Stepping forward slowly, she walked over to the desk and opened the package. The next instant, her beautiful eyes brightened.

Inside were at least twenty exquisite jade bottles, each one filled with precious pills.

.....

No one noticed Yang Kai leaving the iron ship. After Yang Kai was outside, he casually picked a direction and flew forward.

Scarlet Wave Star was not safe as Luo Hai was still searching for him with the assistance of one the biggest Sects on the star. Yang Kai wanted to leave this place as soon as possible. Otherwise, once Luo Hai found some trace of him, things would become troublesome.

Now that his control over Space Force had increased dramatically, Yang Kai was not worried he would die at Luo Hai’s hands, but being chased around by such a master was still an unpleasant experience.

How to leave safely was his biggest problem though.

The Divine Sense of an Origin King Realm master was incredible and there was no way to tell if Luo Hai or Brilliant Flame Sect were paying attention to the movements of cultivators leaving Scarlet Wave Star. If someone noticed him, Yang Kai would be right back where he started. For now, it was probably safest for him to remain in hiding on Scarlet Wave Star.

With a solemn expression, Yang Kai considered his options.

This was the first time he had been hunted down by an Origin King Realm master, and a Star Master at that.

It was a stressful experience!

The atmosphere on Scarlet Wave Star was quite tense right now. Although Brilliant Flame Sect and Ice Heart Valley had always been at odds, there had never been a time when they were openly attacking one another like now.

The small families and Sects attached to the two great forces had also been mobilized.

Throughout Scarlet Wave Star, battles could be seen almost everywhere, and many cultivators died every day.

As Yang Kai flew along, he witnessed countless small skirmishes. Some fights were between two opponents while others involved hundreds or even thousands all at once, making for an extremely lively scene.

One day, as he flew high up in the sky, Yang Kai heard a shout come from below.

Yang Kai looked down and found that there were at least six hundred people gathered below, assembled into two camps, fighting each other.

Needless to say, this was another conflict between Brilliant Flame Sect and Ice Heart Valley, with each side suffering casualties and staining the ground red with blood. The brilliance of artifacts and Secret Techniques was extremely dazzling even from afar.

Yang Kai shook his head slowly and continued on his way

After flying forward a few dozen kilometres, though, Yang Kai sensed the fluctuations of battle coming from below again.

However, this fight was quite small, only involving three people who had seemingly been separated from the main battlefield.

Two men were besieging a woman. The cultivations of this group were not high. The woman was just a Second-Order Saint King while the two men were the same.

Fighting two opponents of the same level, the woman was clearly at a disadvantage. No matter how she tried to move, she would be flanked and forced back. However, the two men seemed to be wary of this woman’s methods and didn’t move in for a decisive blow, instead choosing to wear down her stamina and Saint Qi.

The woman was dressed in pure white robes and gave off an ice-cold aura while the two men clearly cultivated Fire Attribute Secret Arts. The blazing hot aura from their bodies easily countered the chill pulsing from the woman’s body and while they attacked, they would constantly taunt her in an attempt to disturb her concentration.

With their Saint Qi attributes mutually restraining one another, the situation of the woman was extremely difficult.

When Yang Kai passed by above, he couldn’t help frowning slightly and glancing down.

When the woman’s profile entered Yang Kai’s line of sight, he immediately came to a halt as his eyes shrank. Staring at the woman, Yang Kai was dumbfounded, as if he discovered something impossible.

The woman moved about lithely, and as her hair flew about, Yang Kai was able to catch a glimpse of her face.

“It’s actually her!” Yang Kai’s body trembled as an astonishing light flashed across his eyes.

He never expected he would encounter this woman on Scarlet Wave Star!
