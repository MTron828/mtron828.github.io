The Demon Kings were taken aback by the information provided by Fei Li. Furthermore, they totally had no idea about it. They encountered the foreign race before, and they knew what abilities the crude Barbarians had. They had personally killed some of the so-called Masters among them, so they did not think that the foreign race was so hard to deal with.

If they had not been ordered to stay on the defensive by the Demon Saints before as they went to recuperate in retreat, these Demon Kings would have taken the initiative to conquer more land. Therefore, they felt a little surprised hearing from Fei Li that Sha Ya’s territory had fallen and all her subordinates were killed all of a sudden.

“How can that be? Can the foreign race be so powerful?”

“Yeah, Fei Li, are you sure you didn’t make a mistake? Although Sha Ya is not strong, she is a Demon King after all. How can the foreign race have such great capability?”

Several Demon Kings who were clueless about the truth started to question, but the majority of the Demon Kings just stood by and watched.

Being doubted, Fei Li just returned a sneer, “Just ask her yourself. I have no grievance against her, so why would I accuse her without reason?”

The eyes of the Demon Kings immediately darted to Sha Ya.

Sha Ya knew that she had no way to hide it, so she could only admit bitterly, “Fei Li is right. The territory under my rule has indeed fallen, and all three thousand soldiers under my command have died. It was due to my dereliction of duty and incompetence!”

Hearing Sha Ya’s confession, the previous Demon Kings who questioned Fei Li immediately shut their mouths. The gaze that everyone cast at Sha Ya gradually turned cold, revealing a sense of disdain towards her.

Ever since they invaded this land and ever since the foreign race began resisting, they did not suffer too much loss. Even if the foreign race won occasionally, it was just some insignificant victories. None of the Demon Kings here had ever experienced the real taste of defeat.

However, not only did Sha Ya lose her territory, she even lost all her subordinates. This was truly a disgrace to the Demon Race.

She really failed to live up to the expectations of the Demon Saints, and such a failure was enough to deprive her of the rights she had as a Demon King.

“She has to die!” Fei Li’s voice became chillier by the moment. Sha Ya’s defeat seemed to have embarrassed him a lot.

No one spoke for Sha Ya this time. Even Bao Qi dared not open his mouth, lest he draw suspicion.

Sha Ya was still held high in the air, and feeling the strength of Fei Li’s grip tighten, she couldn’t help laughing, “I indeed deserve to die. But I want to tell you that my soldiers didn’t die in vain. They fought an army of ten thousand foreigners to death, and no one retreated or fled. They made the foreign race pay a huge price before they died!”

Of course, Bao Qi knew that she was talking nonsense.

But the other Demon Kings looked flabbergasted, as if they could see the three thousand people struggling to resist relentlessly under the siege of an enemy far outnumbering them, ultimately ending in mutual destruction. The cold faces of the Demon Kings warmed up a little hearing this.

“Then why didn’t you die with them?” Fei Li seemed unmoved by her story as the ghost fire in his eyes flickered menacingly.

Sha Ya opened her mouth, but instead of justifying herself, she just said, “Kill me then. I’ve lost my territory and clansmen. I really don’t have the qualification to be a Demon King anymore.”

She stopped struggling and resigned herself to being slaughtered.

The ghost fire in Fei Li’s eyes suddenly became dark, and he nodded gently, “You still have a little shame. Good, don’t worry, I’ll give you a quick death.”

When he was about to give Sha Ya a fatal blow, Bao Qi, who had been silent, suddenly blurted, “Wait!”

Fei Li turned to him. Although Sha Ya secretly felt relieved, she maintained the same indifferent expression on her face, like she had accepted death and had no fear.

Fei Li said nothing and just stared at Bao Qi, waiting for him to express his opinion. Of course, pleading would be of no use, since he was determined to kill Sha Ya, no intercession would work unless it was an order from the Demon Saints.

“Sha Ya deserves to die, but she shouldn’t die by our hands,” Bao Qi remarked calmly. He pointed at the disguised entrance and continued, “Why don’t we let her be the first to go in and see what’s inside. I believe no one wants to take the lead, right?”

The Demon Kings were immediately moved by his idea. Exchanging looks, some of them bowed their heads, whispered to each other, and nodded one after another. They obviously thought it was a good idea.

The Demon Kings were indeed interested in the tomb of the fallen Ancient Saint, but none of them could help feeling hesitant about what might lay inside. Given that even an Ancient Saint had died here, there were undoubtedly risks in this place.

Although they did not discuss this before, everyone had the same thought in their mind, [Who will go in first?]

It was undeniable that it was dreadfully dangerous to take the lead. The first person to enter may encounter great opportunities, but would be more likely to face unpredictable dangers! All Demon Kings cherished their lives, so no one was stupid enough to volunteer themselves to explore the way for others.

But now, there was a good candidate for the job.

Fei Li remained still, the ghost fires in his eye sockets slowly dimming, as if he was deep in thought.

Bao Qi struck while the iron was hot, “Fei Li, I won’t stop you if you want to kill her, but you’ll have to take her place and enter first then.”

According to Bao Qi’s initial plan, he was supposed to volunteer himself to enter the entrance first to eliminate everyone’s doubts. He knew where the portal in front of him led to anyway, and knew that there was no danger inside, but such a move still might not convince the others too much, because this ‘land of the fallen Ancient Saint’ was actually discovered by him.

But it would be a different case if Sha Ya went first.

As long as she went in and came back again, all suspicions would disappear.

Fei Li snorted coldly, swung his hand, and threw Sha Ya to the ground. His dark pitch-black mouth opened and closed, “Sha Ya, you heard him. I won’t kill you this time, but you have to prove that your life still has value!”

Sha Ya coughed softly and stroked her neck for a long time until she could breathe normally again. She looked up at the Demon Kings with a bitter and pleading look, seemingly unwilling to be the first to enter this strange portal, but who would care about her?

In the end, Sha Ya could only sigh and push her Demon Qi to protect herself before walking towards the place where the vortex was located.

The Demon Kings held their breath and watched. Sha Ya suddenly stopped and announced, “If I don’t come back in an hour, it means there is fatal danger inside.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After saying so, Sha Ya leapt into the vortex and was swallowed up by a mass of chaos and emptiness, vanishing from sight

The Demon Kings waited quietly in front of the vortex, but every pair of eyes was fixed in the direction of the entrance with longing and expectation.

Sha Ya mentioned that if she did not come back in an hour, it meant that there was fatal danger inside, but if she really did not return in an hour, the other Demon Kings would not give up so easily and would begin searching for a safer method to enter for investigation.

At the same time, in the Sealed World Bead, Yang Kai looked indifferently at Sha Ya who came in, and praised, “Both of you did a good job!”

Sha Ya was dumbfounded as she realized that even if Yang Kai hid inside this place, he was perfectly aware of the situation outside. Fortunately, she did not have any treacherous thoughts earlier, otherwise she would be in deep trouble.

“It was Bao Qi who saved the situation with his quick wit. I almost screwed up.” Sha Ya dared not to take credit for it.

Yang Kai shook his head, “There will always be some small accidents in life, but it doesn’t matter. It turned out to be better than the initial plan.”

Sha Ya smiled lightly, “Shall I wait here for an hour, then go out and tell them there’s no danger then?”

Yang Kai replied, “There is no evidence to prove your words, so that alone will not be enough to make them lose their reason and rush in recklessly.”

Sha Ya wondered, “What should I do then?”

“You’ll know later,” Yang Kai’s lips curled into a mysterious smile.

He did not explain it clearly, and Sha Ya did not dare to ask further. She could only stand there quietly and wait for time to pass.

More than an hour later, in the wilderness, the Demon Kings who were quietly paying attention to the entrance of the vortex suddenly froze. They looked closely at the vortex with their eyes lit up, as if they had discovered something amazing.

A faint ripple pulsated in the vortex, followed by the emergence of a graceful figure with a small, short tail.

“She came out!” The Flame Demon shouted as he saw her.

Sha Ya came out safely. In other words, even if the land of the fallen Ancient Saint was dangerous, it was not enough to cause troubles to the Demon Kings. This was excellent news to them.

The other Demon Kings were also excited, but they also had some doubts at the same time.

Because Sha Ya emerged out of the vortex with her back facing them. Not only that, she was moving incredibly slowly, as if there was a force pulling her back in from the other side of the portal.

“What’s going on?” Someone asked.

“Sha Ya, what are you doing? If you want to come out, just come out quickly. Why are you just showing us your ass?”

“Is she trying to seduce us? Hahaha, I have to say, this ass is quite perky. It must feel good to the touch.”

The group of people launched into vulgar children mode at Sha Ya.

“She encountered trouble.” Fei Li suddenly bellowed.

At this time, Sha Ya abruptly pushed her Demon Qi, and lurched her body towards the outside, with only her arms remaining in the vortex, as if she was firmly grasping something and was trying to drag it out of the vortex.

“Come… Help me!” Sha Ya turned her head and shouted at the Demon Kings.

No one moved, as no one knew what kind of trouble Sha Ya was in. It was not worth getting involved just to help her.

“What are you doing?” Bao Qi was even more anxious than the other Demon Kings. The plan somehow went smoothly until now, and as long as Sha Ya stepped out and told everyone that there was no danger inside, he believed that everyone would be willing to enter to investigate, and his task would be complete.

But now, Sha Ya was causing trouble again. This made him anxious and angry as he had no idea whether it was the plan of Sir Shaman Niu or Sha Ya’s own idea.

“Saint Artifact!” Sha Ya blurted out shocking news, “I found a Saint Artifact!”

“What?”

Hearing this, the faces of the Demon Kings all changed drastically.
