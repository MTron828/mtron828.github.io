Zong Ao tipped his hand and the turquoise liquid began pouring out, quickly dispersing into individual droplets that seemed to have their own spirituality. Each of these drops then fell onto Xue Yue’s body and seeped into her pores.

Xue Yue’s pale complexion gradually became rosy as she absorbed these droplets and the sound of her heartbeat grew stronger than before.

Yang Kai stared at this scene intently, his own heartbeat steadying as he watched.

Zong Ao really had profound skills. Yang Kai could clearly feel that Xue Yue’s condition was now much better than a moment ago.

After the turquoise liquid was all absorbed by Xue Yue, Zong Ao took two steps back and a grimace appeared on his face. It seemed this pill and liquid combination was something quite valuable to him.

“Senior, has she been cured?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“Cured?” Zong Ao gave him a sideways glance and sneered, “If you believe the effects of the Profound Yin Sunflower Water can be so easily cured, you’re far too naive! Profound Yin Sunflower Water is an incredibly precious cultivation treasure, but it is also extremely destructive in nature, any ordinary person who comes into contact with it will surely die! Even Origin Returning Realm cultivators cannot resist the power of Profound Yin Sunflower Water. This little girl’s physique seems to be a little special and the grade of artifacts she has on her are also very high, if not for these factors, she would already be dead.”

“Then just now...”

“I only stabilized her vitality, extending her life for a year and a half!”

“What about a year and a half later?” Yang Kai asked anxiously.

“That’s uncertain,” Zong Ao slowly shook his head, “If the appropriate pill can be refined, she will be able to recover, if not... En, you best prepare to collect her corpse.”

Yang Kai paled and immediately cupped his fists respectfully, “Senior’s righteousness is praiseworthy, please provide this Junior with your guidance!”

“Righteousness?” Zong Ao frowned before letting out a big laugh, “This old master isn’t some righteous fellow! I helped stabilize her condition, so now it is time for you to pay up. En, if you can tell me where the Profound Yin Sunflower Water is, this Old master doesn’t mind providing you some more guidance!”

Yang Kai didn’t even think about it before nodding, “I can tell you!”

Ha Li Ka, Lin Mu Feng, and the other executives wanted to conceal the existence of the Profound Yin Sunflower Water, but naturally, Yang Kai wasn’t concerned with their intentions, his only priority right now was saving Xue Yue!

Zong Ao nodded in satisfaction, “Good! If you take me to the Profound Yin Sunflower Water, I will tell you how to save her!”

“Deal!” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly, adding after thinking, “But the place is now guarded by the cultivators of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, Ha Li Ka and Lin Mu Feng probably won’t let you approach it.”

“They dare! If this old master wishes to go, would they dare to stop me?” Zong Ao snorted, “It’s not a problem, I just need to give them some benefits!”

It seemed Zong Ao didn’t want to strain his relationship with Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce too much; after all, the Profound Yin Sunflower Water’s value was too great, and if he tried to take sole possession of it, he would definitely receive retaliation from the Chamber of Commerce.

Sometimes, taking a step back was necessary!

“However, this old master has to make a quick trip first, to collect the Profound Yin Sunflower Water, it’s necessary to create a special container,” Zong Ao said lightly before addressing Yang Kai, “Boy, you stay here, this old master will be back in half a month, we’ll pick up where we left off when I return.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Zong Ao acted swiftly, immediately flying off without saying another word, disappearing to some unknown place.

However, since he had said he needed to create a special container, Yang Kai figured Zong Ao was off to see an Artifact Refiner.

Artifact Refiners held the same level of prestige as Alchemists and were also extremely scarce. High-grade Alchemists and Artifact Refiners were always coveted by major forces.

It wasn’t surprising thought that someone like Zong Ao knew one or two highly skilled Artifact Refiners.

When Zong Ao departed, Ha Li Ka’s voice suddenly called out from outside the palace, “Little Brother, Little Brother!”

He hadn’t left yet! Perhaps he had simply been observing from outside and seeing Zong Ao suddenly leave worked up the courage to approach the palace and inquire about the situation.

Yang Kai walked out and briefly explained what had transpired, and upon learning that Zong Ao was now eyeing the Profound Yin Sunflower Water, Ha Li Ka’s complexion darkened as some panic filled his head, wondering how he was going to deal with Zong Ao.

He did not dare to report this incident to the Home Star. The woman of Xue Yue Third Young Master was still unconscious, her life or death uncertain, this had to be concealed at all costs, so how could he make a report?

Grumbling for a while, Ha Li Ka eventually didn’t blame Yang Kai for exposing this secret and simply sighed, “Since Grandmaster Zong Ao has a method to save her, Little Brother should remain here and wait for him to return. I must return to the branch and discuss with Lin Mu Feng about how to handle what comes next.”

Saying so, he too departed quickly.

Yang Kai returned to the room again, sat by the bed, and stared at the sleeping Xue Yue.

This incredibly enchanting woman now appeared especially tranquil, her breathing even, as if she was simply resting peacefully.

Seeing this, Yang Kai frowned, reached out, and groped her chest maliciously.

He felt that he had suffered a great loss this time! If it weren’t for the Soul Chains effects, he wouldn’t have to go through so much hardship or worry about whether Xue Yue lived or died.

What frustrated him the most though was that even if he managed to save Xue Yue this time, once the Soul Chains were unlocked, he didn’t know what this woman’s attitude towards him would be or whether she would become angry out of shame and hunt him down for the next ten thousand years.

This kind of unpredictable future angered Yang Kai greatly.

However, back on that Dead Star, the situation had forced him into this predicament where his life was linked to Xue Yue. First and foremost he had to preserve his life.

The bitterness in Yang Kai’s heart was unbearable to him and he simply couldn’t find a mental balance unless he profited a bit here and there.

Zong Ao disappeared for half a month, during which, Yang Kai lived in his palace. Xue Yue remained unconscious and didn’t need him to care for her, so he instead explored Zong Ao’s Pill Room wholeheartedly.

Inside the several dozen large and small pill furnaces, there were many Spirit Arrays used for Alchemy. These Spirit Arrays weren’t the same ones hidden in the Medicine Gardens outside, but they were all exquisitely portrayed and perfectly fused together without the slightest signs of conflict.

Yang Kai studied these Spirit Arrays freely, absorbing their structure and formation into his mind, adding them to his own knowledge.

There was also a type of study in the palace that contained many ancient books, and once day when Yang Kai was idling, he decided to go in and browse through them.

To his surprise though, he immediately found a lot of good things which aroused his excitement.

There were many books with pill recipes he had never seen before, so Yang Kai immersed himself in studying them, soon forgetting about the outside world entirely!

The pill recipes Yang Kai had mastered all originated from Tong Xuan Realm, but after coming to the Star Field, the grade of spirit grasses and spirit medicines had become higher and he came to know of many species of herbs he had never heard of before.

These collected pill recipes perfectly complemented his current shortcomings, allowing him to integrate the Star Field’s unique knowledge and skills into his own knowledge of Alchemy.

Half a month passed by without Yang Kai even noticing.

Zong Ao’s life aura suddenly appeared in the palace one day and went straight to the study. Seeing Yang Kai flipping through the various pill recipes and Alchemy’s notes, he actually didn’t mind and instead just called out, “Let’s go, take this old master to the place where you found the Profound Yin Sunflower Water, after this old master successfully collects those treasures, you can read the contents of this place for as long as you want.”

“Alright!” Yang Kai put down an ancient book in his hand, got up and walked out with Zong Ao.

“Will there be any issues leaving my family’s Young Lady here?” Yang Kai asked anxiously.

“How could there be problems?” Zong Ao smirked, “No one dares to break into the palace of this old master; no one has the skill either unless several Origin Returning Realm masters storm this place together! On this Rainfall Star, no one dares to offend this old master. You can rest assured that this is the safest place on Rainfall Star!”

His tone was arrogant, but Yang Kai didn’t think Zong Ao was exaggerating, his words were spoken simply because he was confident in them.

The pair summoned their Star Shuttles and flew off towards the mine.

After half a day, Yang Kai brought Zong Ao to the previous mine shaft.

There were a lot of cultivators waiting down below including Ha Li Ka, Lin Mu Feng, the middle-aged woman, and several other Origin Returning Realm master from the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce branch. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

They seemed to have been waiting for a while.

“A bunch of little brats,” Zong Ao scolded without reserve, a look of dissatisfaction appearing on his face.

Seeing Zong Ao’s figure, Ha Li Ka and others also wore solemn expressions, seemingly a little nervous and helpless, glancing at each other for a moment before stepping forward together.

“Greetings, Grandmaster!”

Zong Ao and Yang Kai swiftly landed and Ha Li Ka and the others saluted the old man respectfully and humbly.

“En!” Zong Ao nodded indifferently.

“I heard that Grandmaster recently used his profound methods to save Lady Xue’er’s life. For that this Ha is extremely grateful. Lady Xue is an honoured guest from the Home Star, if any accident were to befall her, we would not be able to withstand the repercussions. Grandmaster’s generosity and righteousness in saving Lady Xue’er are without equal, and...” Ha Li Ka immediately began a colourful and elaborate flattery campaign, rapidly heaping praise onto Zong Ao.

Lin Mu Feng and the middle-aged woman couldn’t stop their mouths from twitching somewhat as they observed this uncomfortable display.

Even Yang Kai got goosebumps just watching Ha Li Ka, a look of disappointment creeping onto his face, not having thought this gruff Branch President was actually this kind of person.

“Enough nonsense!” Zong Ao waved and cut off Ha Li Ka, squinting towards him and snorting, “Cease trying to flatter this old master, this old master has no interest in such drivel!”

Ha Li Ka suddenly looked embarrassed and didn’t dare open his mouth again.

“This old master’s purpose in coming here today, I assume you all know,” Zong Ao said on his own initiative, “Don’t blame this old master for not giving any face to anyone who tries to stop me!”

Ha Li Ka’s expression grew bitter as he quickly said, “Grandmaster, why you’ve come here today, naturally we understand. Grandmaster came to Rainfall Star a hundred years ago and has refined countless pills for our Chamber of Commerce, yet never asked for any kind of remuneration. Grandmaster’s service has not gone unnoticed and President Ai Ou himself has repeatedly instructed that we regard Grandmaster as the most distinguished of guests, to meet any request you have while never offending you!”

Zong Ao snorted and said, “As long as you understand!”

Ha Li Ka continued though, “If it were something else, why would we not freely deliver it to Grandmaster? But this Profound Yin Sunflower Water...”

“Hm?” Zong Ao’s face grew cold as a bad light flashed across his eyes.

“It’s just that this Profound Yin Sunflower Water... is not something we can take responsibility for!” Ha Li Ka insisted.

“Yes, Grandmaster, if this matter were to become known to the Home Star, we will definitely not escape punishment, please understand!” Lin Mu Feng also stepped forward and begged.
