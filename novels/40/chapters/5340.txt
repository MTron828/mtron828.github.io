Although the Blood Sea was giving off an extremely evil aura, it was also extremely restrained.

Just from this, it could be seen that the person controlling it was extremely skilled.

In the entire Dawn Squad, the only one who cultivated Blood Principles was Blood Crow; thus, only he could have cast the Blood Sea.

This was the first time everyone had cooperated with Blood Crow while fighting an enemy ever since he joined Dawn. That’s why, it came as a surprise that he was able to display such a Blood Sea.

Though this technique gave off a skin-crawling aura, it was extremely effective.

At the very least, the Feudal Lord and the dozen or so Black Ink Clansmen who were trapped in the Blood Sea couldn’t make a single sound.

Bai Yi ignored all this and instead fired a few arrows, taking out the High-Rank Black Ink Clansmen who had yet to react.

Just as she took action, Shen Ao and the others also attacked. They all rushed towards the Black Ink Clan without using any Secret Techniques or artifacts to kill as quietly as possible.

Inside the Black Ink Nest, Yang Kai’s figure flickered as he instantly arrived at its core.

He was extremely familiar with the internal structure of Black Ink Nests so he knew where its key positions were.

After looking around and seeing that the core area was empty, with no one guarding it, he immediately breathed a sigh of relief.

He was really worried that a Feudal Lord would be on guard in this central area. If that was the case, the Feudal Lord would have instantly sounded the alarm about the enemy attacking.

Fortunately, it seemed luck was on their side today.

After giving it another thought, it was not surprising. The main task of the Low-Rank Black Ink Nests set in the periphery of the Royal City was to generate Black Ink Strength and expand the defence perimeter. The Feudal Lords of the Black Ink Nests were surely busy at the Black Ink Pool, so there was no point standing by in the central area; after all, what would they do inside the Black Ink Nest Space, chat with other Feudal Lords?

Without any hesitation, Yang Kai continued deeper, making a beeline straight to the Black Ink Pool’s location.

Finally, he saw a Feudal Lord and a High-Rank Black Ink Clansman.

The High-Rank Black Ink Clansman was standing before the billowing Black Ink Pool, holding a Space Ring and constantly pouring various materials into it for refining.

The Feudal Lord was sitting completely still near the Black Ink Pool, his consciousness apparently linked with the Black Ink Nest.

The Human Race had done a lot of research on the Black Ink Nest they acquired. Furthermore, Yang Kai was stationed in the vicinity of the Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest captured by Great Evolution Pass for many years, studying its various functions and characteristics. As such, Yang Kai could tell that this Feudal Lord was controlling the Black Ink Nest to produce Black Ink Strength with just a glance.

Generally, when resources were thrown into the Black Ink Pool, the refined energy could be used in two ways for a Low-Rank Black Ink Nest. First, it could be used to breed more Black Ink Clansmen, and second, it could be used to produce Black Ink Strength.

If no one was present to control the Black Ink Nest, then it would simply perform both functions.

The current task of the Low-Rank Black Ink Nests was to expand the defence line, so the only thing they needed to do was produce Black Ink Strength.

The moment Yang Kai barged in, it was the Feudal Lord who suddenly looked up before the High-Rank Black Ink Clansman could react.

The next moment, Yang Kai’s grim smile entered his sight.

“You…” The Feudal Lord was beside himself in shock, but before he could get up, the High-Rank Black Ink Clansman next to the Black Ink Pool exploded into a blood mist. Immediately after, a strange wave of energy swept over the Feudal Lord, freezing both his body and mind in place.

In a flash, a spear pierced through his head, blowing it apart.

Yang Kai put away the Azure Dragon Spear and breathed a long sigh of relief.

He had taken control of this Black Ink Nest. It might have seemed simple, but any other Seventh-Order Master would never have achieved this.

To make the attack that killed the Feudal Lord, Yang Kai had simultaneously used Time Principles and Space Principles.

Under the Time Principles, the Feudal Lord’s thoughts became sluggish, and under the Space Principles, his body became stiff, rendering him unable to avoid Yang Kai’s fatal attack.

After scanning the Black Ink Nest with his Divine Sense and confirming that there were no more Black Ink Clansmen inside, Yang Kai exited it without any hesitation.

When he arrived outside, he found that all the Black Ink Clansmen outside were dead, all that was left was a billowing Blood Sea.

As Yang Kai focused his gaze, a slight furrow appeared on his brow.

“Help!” Suddenly, Blood Crow’s voice rang in his ear as the Blood Sea parted, creating a passage.

Yang Kai immediately flew along the passage into the Blood Sea. Soon, he saw a Feudal Lord surrounded by the Blood Sea. At this moment, the Feudal Lord was rapidly casting Secret Techniques to attack the surrounding Blood Sea, his body violently surging with Black Ink Strength.

While this Feudal Lord was pretty strong, Blood Crow could easily defeat him given enough time. Unfortunately, the current situation did not allow him to drag things out so he directly sent a transmission to Yang Kai, requesting assistance.

Yang Kai raised his Azure Dragon Spear and thrust it towards the Feudal Lord. The sharp spear broke through the barriers of space and pierced straight through the unsuspecting Feudal Lord.

A fountain of Black Blood immediately gushed out from the Feudal Lord as Yang Kai pulled out his spear.

Immediately, Blood Crow broke into a maniacal laughter.

Yang Kai’s expression instantly changed as he quickly retreated.

Just as he withdrew from the Blood Sea, it strangely converged into a single place, transforming back into Blood Crow. The many Black Ink Clansmen that were previously submerged in Blood Sea were nowhere to be found.

Blood Crow, on the other hand, had a satisfied look on his face, even letting out a loud burp.

A strange look appeared on Bai Yi and the others’ faces at the sight of this.

Yang Kai’s expression became even more serious as he ordered, “Clean everything up and quickly get inside!”

At the same time, Yang Kai reached out and grabbed Blood Crow by the neck, dragging him into the Black Ink Nest.

The Black Ink Nest was pretty big, so Yang Kai quickly found an empty space and let Dawning Light out. Afterwards, he jumped onto the deck, towing Blood Crow by the neck.

Blood Crow tried to struggle his way out but he was unable to break free from Yang Kai’s grasp. His face immediately became ugly as he shouted, “Let me go!”

No matter what, he was still a Senior to Yang Kai, so he found it disgraceful to be hauled around by the neck by a Junior.

“You’re courting death!” Yang Kai shouted, gnashing his teeth, “Do you know what you’re doing?”

Blood Crow gave a lackadaisical smile, “What do you think I’m doing?”

As he spoke, Bai Yi and the others also rushed over and came to the deck in succession, staring at Blood Crow silently.

As if he sensed everyone’s attitude, Blood Crow lightly chuckled, “What’s wrong? Are you feeling disgusted just because I ate a few Black Ink Clansmen?”

Shen Ao corrected, furrowing his brow, “Brother Xue, it’s not like that, but…”

“There’s no need to explain,” Yang Kai glared at Blood Crow, “I know you cultivate the Great Evolution Immortal Blood Light Scripture and can refine the Blood Essence of others to increase your cultivation, but the Black Ink Clan!? You’ve been on the Black Ink Battlefield for so many years, so I don’t think that you need me to explain it to you. If you refine the Black Ink Clan’s Blood Essence, can you stomach it?”

Blood Crow indifferently replied, “If I can’t stomach it, what would I have eaten all these years?”

Yang Kai’s expression changed, “This isn’t the first time?”

Blood Crow lightly chuckled as a sliver of Black Ink Strength surged in between his brows.

The Black Ink Clan had Blood Essence which could be refined, but that was naturally filled with Black Ink Strength. Refining Blood Essence also meant being contaminated by Black Ink Strength. On the battlefield, the slightest mistake would lead to horrendous consequences; he could be corrupted by Black Ink Strength and become a Black Ink Disciple.

Blood Crow indifferently rebuked, “Don’t speak to me about the Grand Dao. This King resurrected for the sake of greater strength; otherwise, this King wouldn’t have died back then. The Great Evolution Immoral Blood Light Scripture is a wondrous Secret Art, and not nearly as simple as you think. It’s not a problem to refine the Blood Essence from the Black Ink Clan, and as for the Black Ink Strength, there is naturally a way to resolve it now.”

The method he was referring to was none other than the Purifying Light. Not to mention that Yang Kai was right next to him. If Yang Kai noticed something was amiss, he would naturally be able to purify the Black Ink Strength in his body.

Even if there was no Yang Kai, the purifying light sealed inside the Black Ink Purifying Battleships would work just fine.

This was not the first time Blood Crow had refined the Black Ink Clan’s Blood Essence; in fact, he had done so many times on the battlefield. Each time, he would find an opportunity to use the Universe Transference Law to return to the Purifying Black Ink Battleship.

Yang Kai asked in a serious voice, “Are you sure there is no problem?”

Although the Purifying Light could purify and expel Black Ink Strength, it was only effective against the Black Ink Disciples who had been corrupted by the Black Ink Strength. As for Blood Crow, he was actively refining it. Yang Kai couldn’t be certain if there was any Black Ink Strength hidden in him.

“There’s no problem, for now,” Blood Crow slowly shook his head in response, “If some problem really does present itself, just kill me.”

Yang Kai stared deeply at him, “I won’t show any mercy.”

If it really reached a point where even the Purifying Light couldn’t save him, Yang Kai would have no choice but to take his life. This was the path that Blood Crow had chosen, so he couldn’t blame others.

Blood Crow went around Yang Kai and headed for the cabin, wearing an indifferent expression on his face.

Currently, apart from Dawning Light, there were only four Purifying Black Ink Battleships that had Purifying Light in the entire Great Evolution Army. If Blood Crow wanted to safely refine the Black Ink Clan’s Blood Essence, he had to do it in an environment filled with Purifying Light.

Watching him leave, Yang Kai secretly heaved a helpless sigh. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He had also mulled over this before. The Great Evolution Immortal Blood Light Scripture that Blood Crow was cultivating after returning from the dead was indeed a wondrous Secret Art, but it was equally evil. The user of this technique could only improve their strength by relying on their own cultivation technique, which was quite a slow and tedious process, or by devouring and refining the Blood Essence of the others, which was by far the best option for the users of Blood Light Scripture.

On the Black Ink Battlefield, whether it was the Black Ink Clansmen or the Black Ink Disciples, both possessed quite a lot of Black Ink Strength in their bodies, so refining their Blood Essence was quite a risky process.

Yang Kai thought that Blood Crow wouldn’t be so bold, but by the looks of it, he had underestimated his determination to pursue greater strength.

But who did not pursue greater strength in this miserable era? Yang Kai was also like that, so were the members of Dawn, and so was the entire Great Evolution Army.

Only with greater strength could one play a greater role in the battle against the Black Ink Clan.

Be that as it may, Blood Crow’s method of increasing his strength was somewhat different from others.

Now that it was already a done deed, Yang Kai couldn’t possibly ask Blood Crow to spit out the Black Ink Clansmen, it simply didn’t work like that.

“Have you tidied up things outside?” Yang Kai asked.

Shen Ao reported with a nod, “It’s all cleaned up, but this way, it’ll be easy for us to expose ourselves.”

There should be Black Ink Clansmen outside the Black Ink Nest, defending it. When Yang Kai used the Demon Eye of Annihilation to observe them, he saw that every Black Ink Nest was guarded by the Black Ink Clan.

Now though, this Black Ink Nest was completely undefended. If a Black Ink Clan patrol were to pass by, they would definitely become suspicious.

“Should we put on a disguise?” Shen Ao asked.

Yang Kai refused, shaking his head, “No need. If the Black Ink Clansmen really come to investigate, putting on a disguise would be pointless. Furthermore, we don’t have to maintain this position for long. Great Evolution Pass will arrive in half a month at most, so we just need to hold out until then.”

It shouldn’t be a problem to hold out for half a month. What they needed to do now was to quickly take down the other two nearby Black Ink Nests.

When Yang Kai observed from the periphery of the Black Ink Clan’s defence line, he noticed that as long as he could take down these three neighbouring Black Ink Nests, an exploitable gap would appear.

As long as Great Evolution Pass disguised itself a little and entered through this gap, they would be able to completely avoid the eyes and ears of the Black Ink Clan and make it to the Royal City, catching the Black Ink Clan off guard.

Since everything had gone smoothly when they launched a surprise attack using the Black Ink Clan’s ship. Yang Kai planned to simply use the same method to capture the other two Black Ink Nests.
