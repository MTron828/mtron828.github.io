The East-West Army departed from the base and headed to Great Evolution Pass. If everything went well, they would arrive at their destination in one month.

After 10 days of reorganisation, it could only be said that the soldiers were able to move and fight again, but they hadn’t fully recovered. The injured soldiers were still recuperating in the Warships of their Squads. Meanwhile, the Array Masters and Artifact Refiners were moving between the Warships to repair the artifacts and arrays. They were swamped with work.

Wen Cheng Jing and Zhang Yang, who were new to Dawn, soon familiarised themselves with the other members. Feng Ying had assigned some work and duties to them. On the other hand, Blood Crow, who didn’t seem to get along well with the others, was standing on the deck on his own. It wasn’t certain what was on his mind.

Yang Kai didn’t intend to interfere. It was impossible to expect that Blood Crow could get along with the others. His background, experiences, and temperament meant that he was unable to do that.

However, Blood Crow was already different from his past self. Yang Kai could detect that.

In the past, Blood Crow was forced to come to the Black Ink Battlefield to fight against the Black Ink Clan. But now, he didn’t battle against the Black Ink Clan just because he had to. It also had something to do with his Dao Heart.

Even though his life was saved by the members of his previous Squad, he might not necessarily be grateful to them; instead, he might think that those who were killed in his stead were foolish. Regardless, it was an indisputable fact that his life was saved. He didn’t have to be grateful, but he did have to repay their favour.

This was his Dao.

In the cabin, after examining Ning Qi Zhi’s body, Yang Kai said, “Just get some rest for the time being. Even if there’s a battle, don’t make a move.”

In the previous battle, Qi Tai Chu was killed while Ning Qi Zhi was terribly injured and his Small Universe was damaged. If not for the fact that Yang Kai had come to his rescue in time, his Small Universe would have been shattered.

If that happened, Qi Tai Chu wouldn’t have been the only one who died that day.

Although Ning Qi Zhi had survived, his Small Universe had cracked.

Fortunately, Yang Kai had Profound Yin Spirit Fruits on him.

When he was in Blue Sky Pass back then, he had intentionally planted some Profound Yin Fruit Trees and a massive amount of herbs that could be used to refine Purifying Black Ink Pills in his Small Universe.

They were planted in his medicine garden where Mu Zhu and Mu Lu, the two Wood Spirits, would tend to them. Those herbs would easily grow to maturity under their care.

Furthermore, the flow of time in his Small Universe was much faster than that in the outside world. More than 1,000 years had passed since then, so the Profound Yin Fruit Trees in his Small Universe had borne fruits. Yang Kai had handed 90% of them over to Army to be used by the other soldiers while he kept 10% just in case of emergencies.

Profound Yin Spirit Fruits were the only Spirit Fruits the Humans had found that could repair broken or incomplete Small Universes.

That was the reason Ning Qi Zhi’s life was saved. Although the Profound Yin Spirit Fruit had an amazing effect, it would take a long time before his Small Universe was fully repaired. Before that, he was unable to use his World Force, or his injury would exacerbate.

Upon hearing Yang Kai’s words, Ning Qi Zhi nodded, but he didn’t feel any sense of relief.

Qi Tai Chu had lost his life. In Dawn, Qi Tai Chu, Ning Qi Zhi, and Shen Ao were former Black Ink Disciples that Yang Kai had brought back from the Black Ink Clan’s side. They were friends who had shared countless life-and-death moments together on the battlefield.

Now, Qi Tai Chu was no longer there to drink wine and talk about the Martial Dao with the other two.

Yang Kai gently patted his shoulder and turned around to leave. The moment he left the cabin, he saw the gloomy-looking Blood Crow standing on the deck on his own.

Without intending to talk to him, Yang Kai returned to his room to get some rest.

As soon as he opened the door, he batted his eyes in stunned silence. A moment later, he gently stepped back and closed the door.

Before he could close the door though, a voice called out, “Come in and have a talk with me.”

A helpless Yang Kai tutted and opened the door again. Upon entering the room, he saluted the person who was seated on his bed, “Old Ancestor.”

No one knew when Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao had arrived aboard Dawning Light; however, given her Ninth-Order cultivation, no one could detect her presence if she wanted to conceal it.

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao shot him a glance and teased him by saying, “What’s wrong? Are you worried that there will be rumours about us? Is that why you left the door open?”

Yang Kai promptly shook his head, “That’s definitely not the case.”

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao snorted.

A concerned Yang Kai asked, “How’re your injuries? Do you need a place to recuperate?”

Upon hearing that, Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao waved her hand, “I don’t need to recuperate for now. We’ll talk about it when we settle down. Moreover, I wasn’t badly hurt in the previous battle.”

A curious Yang Kai asked, “Why are you here, then?”

Obviously, the Old Ancestor wouldn’t have come all the way here just to have a chat with him.

Without beating around the bush, Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao extended her hand, “Give me some a few sets of Space Beacons.”

The two of them had lived together in Yang Kai’s Small Universe for hundreds of years now and frequently chatted with each other. On occasion, Yang Kai would mention the methods he had developed in the Dao of Space, hoping the Old Ancestor might be able to give him some insights or inspiration.

That was why she was aware of the existence of his Space Beacons.

Yang Kai didn’t ask why she needed the Space Beacons and just fished out a few sets and passed them to her.

After taking the Space Beacons, the Old Ancestor directly disappeared.

Yang Kai batted his eyes once and realised that she was already nowhere to be seen in the room. Soon though, he heard the Old Ancestor’s voice, “Tell your Squad to relax. There won’t be a battle when we arrive at Great Evolution Pass.”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai was stunned.

He thought that the reason they set off to Great Evolution Pass was to launch the last battle against the Black Ink Clan to retake it. However, the Old Ancestor’s words seemed to suggest that they could get Great Evolution Pass back without a fight.

Would the Black Ink Clan unconditionally surrender Great Evolution Pass to them?

Yang Kai frowned, but as he pondered on the issue, he soon realised the crux of the matter and figured out why she had said as much.

Even though it was no different from letting the Black Ink Clansmen from both sides join forces, it was still of greater benefit to the Human soldiers at the moment. Yang Kai had no idea about the North-South Army’s situation, but the East-West Army had just gone through an intense battle. If they fought again after such a short time, there would surely be massive losses.

If they could retake Great Evolution Pass without a fight, they could prevent a lot of unnecessary sacrifices. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

As for the reason that the Old Ancestor wanted some Space Beacons from Yang Kai…

After giving it a thought, he couldn’t help but feel sorry for the Royal Lord for a moment.

Perhaps in the years to come, the Royal Lord would not be able to recuperate with peace of mind.

In the North-South Army’s base, Li Xing was given a room. By activating the Spirit Arrays, he could cultivate at ease without worrying about any interruption, unless the room itself was attacked.

However, he wasn’t in the mood to cultivate. The reason he didn’t immediately return to the East-West Army’s side after completing his task was that he wanted to find out if Mi Jing Lun’s speculation was right.

At the same time, he wanted to know the outcome of the war on the East-West Army’s side.

He had learned a lot of secrets from Xiang Shan, so he knew that it wouldn’t be hard for the East-West Army to win the battle; however, it remained uncertain whether the Old Ancestor would be able to kill the Royal Lord.

Before the outcome was clear, no one could be certain that there wouldn’t be a sudden turn of events.

It wasn’t hard to find out whether the East-West Army had won the battle. They just had to observe the reaction of the Black Ink Clansmen in Great Evolution Pass; therefore, Li Xing had been staring in Great Evolution Pass’ direction in an attempt to find out what was going on over there. Nevertheless, the Great Pass was too far away for a mere Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master to get a clear look. Regardless of what the Black Ink Clan were doing over there, he was unable to tell.

One day, he suddenly saw a ray of light rushing over from Great Evolution Pass’ direction.

Li Xing’s eyes brightened as he knew that it should be one of the people from the North-South Army responsible for monitoring Great Evolution Pass. Since the person was coming back in a hurry, he must have some news to report to the higher-ups.

As expected, after the person returned, he directly landed on the Purifying Black Ink Battleship.

Li Xing had the urge to find out more, but he was worried that it would be awkward for him to do so; after all, he wasn’t from the North-South Army, so he didn’t have the right to head to the Purifying Black Ink Battleship as he pleased.

After waiting for some time, he saw the person emerging from the Purifying Black Ink Battleship, so he promptly went over to stop him and cupped his fist, “Please wait, Senior Brother.”

That person was also a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, and as he lifted his head and recognised him, he asked with a smile, “Brother Li from the East-West Army?”

Li Xing nodded, then quickly asked, “Senior Brother, is there any news about the Black Ink Clansmen from Great Evolution Pass?”

The Seventh-Order Master hesitated for a bit, but reckoning that it wasn’t really a secret, he replied, “Indeed, Brother Li. Just now, we detected some unusual movement from Great Evolution Pass. There seemed to be a commotion; however, due to the Great Pass’ barrier, we were unable to find out what was going on regardless of how hard we tried. If it’s just like the information you’ve brought to us, the East-West Army should have won the battle. The Black Ink Clansmen there must be feeling uneasy now after learning the news from the Royal City.”

Li Xing became excited, “That has to be the case!”

The Seventh-Order Master said with a smile, “I share the same sentiment, so I came back in a hurry to report it to the two Army Commanders. Brother Li, I have to return to continue monitoring Great Evolution Pass, so I’ll take my leave now.”

Saying so, he cupped his fist and left the place.

Li Xing, who had been anxious recently, finally relaxed. Since the Black Ink Clan from Great Evolution Pass started making a move, it suggested that those from the Royal City were defeated.

In that case, the East-West Army must have successfully carried out its plan. In other words, they had won.

Therefore, he no longer had to return to the East-West Army. According to the plan, if the East-West Army won the war, they would soon come over and join up with the North-South Army.

As such, Li Xing just had to wait here and could also find out if Mi Jing Lun’s speculation was right.

After bidding Li Xing farewell, the Seventh-Order Master headed straight in Great Evolution Pass’ direction.

A few hours later, he landed on an asteroid where there were two other Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. One of them was seen with Demon Qi swirling around his figure. It was obvious that he was from Myriad Demons Cave Heaven. On the other hand, it was difficult to figure out the other person’s background; however, he was clad in a green robe, and his aura felt natural and pure.

Presently, one of these Seventh-Order Masters was seen with a golden left pupil. Apparently, he had activated the Demon Eye of Annihilation.

It wasn’t certain what kind of an amazing Eye Secret Technique the green-robed Seventh-Order Master was using, but his eyes had turned amber, and a flash of light was seen flowing behind his gaze.

They were seated in two different places as they stared in Great Evolution Pass’ direction in an attempt to find out what was going on over there.

There were countless talents in the Cave Heavens and Paradises, so it wasn’t hard to get two people who had cultivated Eye Secret Techniques to monitor Great Evolution Pass.

The three of them were in the same group. Two people were responsible for keeping an eye on Great Evolution Pass while the remaining one served as a runner to report any findings to the higher-ups. There was a clear division of tasks.

A moment later, the disciple from Myriad Demons Cave Heaven grunted all of a sudden. At the same time, the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, whose eyes had turned amber, batted his eyes. It was apparent that they had discovered something.
