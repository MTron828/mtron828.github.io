Everyone widened their eyes in disbelief. They had expected that Sheng Yao would either be unyielding or plead for mercy, but it was beyond their imagination that he would lower his head right after he appeared.

[Is he really the Fierce Gale Pirates’ Head Manager? Is he really a Second-Order Origin King?] Everyone felt that the sight they were seeing was surreal; however, after giving it a thought, they knew that he was just submitting to the circumstances.

Apparently, Sheng Yao wasn’t confident about going up against this young man, which was why he appeared so servile. A Master would only back down in front of an even stronger Master.

A glint flashed across the young man’s eyes as he looked over Sheng Yao and curled up his lips, as though he had found something interesting. However, he soon knitted his brow, for he had never expected that this person would be so cowardly. It was said that ‘one should not slap a person in the face when he was smiling at you. Although Sheng Yao had been hiding nearby the whole time, he had never made an aggressive move; hence, there were practically no grudges between them.

Moreover, he appeared humble and subservient now, so it would be inappropriate for the young man to kill him directly. Ma Chao Qun and He Wu Zui only had themselves to blame for their deaths. On the other hand, this Sheng Yao appeared to have sharp instincts for avoiding misfortune.

[This puts me in a tight spot.] After some deliberation, the young man still didn’t know what to do, so he decided to ignore him and close his eyes while remaining in the same spot.

Sheng Yao remained unmoving, his back bent deeply as pea-sized drops of sweat streamed down his face. It felt terrible to have his life controlled by the whims of another. Nevertheless, he had no choice but to remain subservient as this young man was far stronger than he was.

The place fell into silence again as the young man gave no reaction, but even an hour later, the young man still remained unmoving.

Naturally, the people from the Lu Family wouldn’t make a move since their leader, Lu Huai Shuang, also kept her silence. It was the same for the Fierce Gale Pirates. On the other hand, those top cultivators from the He Family traded glances as it was apparent that they wanted to flee when an opportunity presented itself.

Lu Huai Shuang shot them a cold glance all of a sudden, though, as she would definitely not allow them to escape. Both the Lu Family and the He Family were archenemies on Morning Sun Star, and their powers were equally matched because they both had an Origin King Realm Master assuming command. However, from today onwards, the He Family wouldn’t be a threat to the Lu Family anymore.

After He Wu Zui’s death, the He Family was practically leaderless, so the Lu Family could seize the chance and annex their properties and businesses. It would be the best outcome if Lu Huai Shuang could bury all these top cultivators from the He Family here forever.

Understanding that she couldn’t let this chance slip through her fingers, Lu Huai Shuang took one more look at the young man before steeling herself. A glint flashed across her azure longsword as she pointed her weapon at the He Family’s people and ordered coldly, “Kill them all!”

She had instantly decided the fate of those from the He Family. Although she was a woman, she wasn’t a magnanimous person. A soft-hearted person could never be the leader of great force. Since she took over the Lu Family, she could no longer live for herself.

The He Family instantly fell to a disadvantage. In truth, the cultivators from both families were equally matched in terms of quantity and strength; however, the Patriarch of the He Family was dead, and without a leader, these hundreds of top cultivators were unable to act in a cohesive manner. On the other hand, the people from the Lu Family had Lu Huai Shuang on their side, so their momentum was far greater and they were able to defeat their enemies with ease.

Just one hour later, all those from the He Family were slaughtered except for a small number of people who managed to escape. Despite that, they were just like beasts in a cage on this Dead Star, so they couldn’t possibly cause trouble anymore.

While the two families fought, the Fierce Gale Pirates fled from this place. The Lu Family’s people couldn’t divert their attention to those people either as their priority was the cultivators from the He Family.

That was why the Fierce Gale Pirates managed to leave this place with ease without anyone pursuing them. On the other hand, Sheng Yao was abandoned by his own people. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

It was easy to share wealth, but it was hard to endure hardship together. It wasn’t even certain whether their Head Manager could live to see the next sunrise, so none of the Star Pirates were willing to stay there and let someone else decide their fate.

Sheng Yao continued to bow as he cursed all of his subordinates in his heart. Those people were proactive when they followed him around to drink wine and have fun with women; however, after he fell into trouble, they all ran away as quickly as possible. At that instant, he finally saw through their true colours.

One hour later, those from the Lu Family declared victory. In the end, only a few of them had been injured, which was a small price to gain such immense success. After the war, hundreds of top cultivators from the He Family were killed, and even their only Origin King Grade Starship had been seized by the Lu Family. On top of that, the He Family Patriarch was dead.

The outcome was astonishing, and just thinking that the Lu Family would be the sole ruler of Morning Sun Star from this day onward, all of them could barely contain their excitement.

Everyone knew that everything was made possible because of the young man who appeared out of nowhere. If he hadn’t killed He Wu Zui, no one could be certain who would end up the winner today.

Lu Huai Shuang returned from the battlefield with her clothes still clean and her hair still tidy. There was a charming smile on her alluring face; however, she was startled when she took a look at the place where the young man was supposed to be standing and discovered that he was nowhere to be found now.

Meanwhile, Sheng Yao remained on the same spot, still bowing, the sand around him soaked in sweat.

Lu Huai Shuang looked around with a frown, and upon confirming that the young man was indeed gone, she felt somewhat dejected. Then, she moved forward and asked, “Where is he?”

Sheng Yao didn’t reply to her.

“He’s gone,” Lu Huai Shuang uttered.

Shocked by what he just heard, Sheng Yao finally looked up cautiously. Upon realizing that the young man was no longer there, he felt his entire body shuddering. He was more terrified than he was surprised though as he had failed to notice it when the young man left.

He had been less than ten steps away from the young man, and given his Second-Order Origin King cultivation, Sheng Yao should have noticed something even if the young man was a Third-Order Origin King.

However, the young man just disappeared mysteriously without anyone noticing it, which was why Sheng Yao was so frightened. At the same time, he was glad that he had made the right decision. Although his dignity was lost, he had kept his life unlike his Second Brother, Third Brother and Fourth Brother.

“Can I get up?” Sheng Yao asked.

Lu Huai Shuang snorted, “Why are you asking me?”

She was naturally not fond of this Fierce Gale Pirate Head Manager. In fact, all the cultivators in the Star Field despised Star Pirates, which was why Lu Huai Shuang was treating him coldly now.

Sheng Yao put on an embarrassed smile and slowly stood up straight, cautious about his surroundings as he was worried the young man would suddenly reappear and cut him down.

It took him almost as long as it would take to boil a cup of tea to get up completely, but after he did, Sheng Yao heaved a sigh of relief and brushed away the sweat on his forehead. Since he was still breathing, it meant that the young man didn’t have any intention of killing him. Still, he felt slightly dejected for he was a Second-Order Origin King and the young man wasn’t even interested in making a move against him. Otherwise, the young man wouldn’t have ignored him.

“Young Lady Lu, I’ve heard a lot about you. Haha.” Sheng Yao put on a fawning smile and cupped his fists at her.

“Where is he now?” Never before in Lu Huai Shuang’s life had she had such an urge to look for someone. However, at this moment, she could only ask Sheng Yao about it.

“I… I don’t know…” Sheng Yao forced a smile.

In an instant, Lu Huai Shuang looked at him in shock as she had figured out the hidden message in his words, and she couldn’t help but be surprised.

“I suppose he’s still on this Dead Star though.” Sheng Yao wasn’t certain about it himself. Nevertheless, he thought that if that person had really left, he could take the chance and flee from this place. He wouldn’t dare to harm the Lu Family anymore. After such an ordeal, he just wanted to stay as far away from them as possible, so he uttered hesitantly, “Why don’t we look for him together?”

Lu Huai Shuang glared at him for a moment before silently summoning her Star Shuttle and boarding it, flying off in a beam of light.

The corner of Sheng Yao’s mouth twitched as he hesitated between fleeing from this place and looking for that strange young man. Eventually, he clenched his teeth and raced after the shuttle as he shouted, “Young Lady Lu, wait for me!”

For him, it was more than just admiration and fear he felt. He could sense a trace of a higher Martial Dao from that young man which he had been pursuing but couldn’t attain.

Meanwhile, the young man was sitting cross-legged atop a certain small mountain. There wasn’t any vitality on this Dead Star, nor any greenery. Such barren mountains could be seen everywhere on this Dead Star. This particular mountain was covered in sand and stones, and whenever a breeze whisked past, the sand would be brought up into the air, and a radius of ten metres around the young man would be hardly visible.

The stone mountain was only a kilometre high, but as Sheng Yao and Lu Huai Shuang stood at its base and stared up towards its summit, they felt as if they were gazing upon a 100-kilometre-high mountain because of the young man who sat at its peak. The mountain itself was small, while the figure above it appeared many times larger.

Half a month ago, the two of them had cooperated and finally found this figure at this place. Not daring to disturb the young man though, they waited for him at the bottom of the mountain. The wait had lasted for half a month already, and during this time, the young man remained seated on the same spot as though he was dead, no aura leaking from him at all.

Neither Lu Huai Shuang nor Sheng Yao knew what this young man was doing. He didn’t look like he was cultivating at all; rather, it was as if he was simply asleep. The half-month wait was extremely dull, but fortunately, both of them were Origin Kings and were used to cultivating in seclusion for years at a time, so they were used to such monotony.

Sheng Yao wanted to know more about this young man, so he kept asking Lu Huai Shuang about him; however, the latter knew nothing about him other than the fact that he mysteriously appeared on her Starship out of nowhere. At that time, she even thought he was dead. Nevertheless, she realized that her Third Uncle’s speculation was right.

The damage to her Starship was undoubtedly caused by this young man. Only a man with such inconceivable power could ignore a volley of ten Crystal Cannons without being hurt.

However, she was somewhat frustrated now. This couldn’t be helped, as this Head Manager from Fierce Gale Pirates kept talking to her incessantly. He looked more like a nagging housewife than a Second-Order Origin King.

However, she realized that there was no sense of obscenity behind Sheng Yao’s gaze whenever he looked at her. Apart from the fact that he admired the young man, there must be other reasons behind his continued presence.

Nevertheless, Lu Huai Shuang was fine with this as she hated it most when men stared at her with licentious gazes.

“Young Lady Lu, I believe it’s fate that has brought us together. When you’re free in the future, why don’t you visit me at the Fierce Gale Pirates’ headquarters? We have many…”

“We can discuss it if you manage to leave here alive.” Lu Huai Shuang rudely cut him off.

In an instant, Sheng Yao’s expression turned bitter.
