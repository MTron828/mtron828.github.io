Upon getting Fan Wu’s reply, Yang Kai nodded slightly. Just when he was about to beckon to Zhang Ruo Xi though, Shi Huo said coldly, “You can leave with the others, but this little girl must stay.” He pointed at Zhang Ruo Xi and spoke in an unquestionable tone.

Yang Kai’s expression changed as he glowered at him and snarled, “Why should we listen to you?”

Shi Huo tossed the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal in his hand up and uttered in an aloof manner, “It’s because of this. She was brazen enough to seal millions of Beast Souls from our Ancient Lands inside, so she must explain herself to the Monster Race and be held accountable for this crime.”

Upon hearing what he said, most Monster Kings at the scene agreed with him. Nobody wanted their Soul to be refined into an artifact by a Human and to be used as a mindless weapon. Apparently, Zhang Ruo Xi’s Ten Thousand Beasts Seal had caused public outrage.

Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Guo frowned. Although they knew that Shi Huo was basically finding fault with Yang Kai, what he had just said was also sensible. As members of the Monster Race themselves, they were not in any position to refute him.

It seemed that this issue couldn’t be resolved easily on this day. Apparently, Shi Huo was set on killing Yang Kai. They knew that Shi Huo was someone who would seek revenge for the slightest grievance, but they didn’t expect that he would be so petty. The reason he was harping on this issue was simply that Yang Kai had suppressed him using Mountains and Rivers Bell previously.

He couldn’t kill Yang Kai in the previous sneak attack, and no matter how thick-skinned he was, he couldn’t possibly lose all face by launching another sneak attack. However, the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal’s appearance had given him one more chance to achieve his goal.

“How do you want to punish her?” Yang Kai’s gaze turned cold. It was an extremely difficult decision for him to give in to Shi Huo. He would have to ignore the fact that Shi Huo had oppressed him as someone much stronger and older by shamelessly launching a sneak-attack on him. If it wasn’t obvious he could not triumph in this situation, given Yang Kai’s temperament, he would have battled it out with Shi Huo even if it meant losing his life.

However, Zhang Ruo Xi, the Stone Spirit Clan members, and the Third Disciple were all here. If he really confronted Shi Huo, all of them would die, which was why he could swallow down his grievances. However, he didn’t expect that Shi Huo would still not be willing to let them off.

Just then, Shi Huo snorted, “Whoever dares to commit such blasphemy against the Monster Race in our Ancient Lands must die!”

“She must die!”

“Don’t let her off!”

“Kill her!”

All the Monster Kings started roaring as they appeared utterly incensed. It was as though Zhang Ruo Xi had done something that deserved the harshest condemnation.

The blood on Yang Kai’s face hadn’t dried up yet as he swept a cold glance over all the Monster Kings and eventually stared fixedly at Fan Wu.

In a dispassionate manner, Fan Wu added, “This little girl isn’t part of the promise. Since she has violated our taboo, she has to stay in the Ancient Lands.”

Although he despised Shi Huo for his contemptible behaviour, he was a Divine Venerable of the Ancient Lands in the end, so he wasn’t willing to disappoint the other Monster Kings.

“Haha…” Yang Kai suddenly laughed hysterically as he sneered at all the Monster Kings and spoke in a cold voice, “Truly wonderful! Several dozen peak Twelfth-Order Masters and Four Great Divine Spirits are all ganging up to kill a young girl barely twenty years of age! Many thanks for showing me the true colours of the Monster Race living in the Ancient Lands!”

Upon hearing his mockery, some members of the Monster Race flared up and snarled, “What did you say?”

The expressions of Fan Wu and the others were dark; however, just like what Yang Kai had said, if the news that so many Masters were using their authority and strength to punish a young girl was to spread out, it would be a great embarrassment to them.

“Sir, please ignore me! Please just leave me here!” Zhang Ruo Xi suddenly shouted, her gaze filled with anxiety, “Leave this place immediately!”

Upon realizing the problem, she felt extremely regretful and thought that she had dragged Yang Kai into this mess. If she didn’t summon the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal, such an incident wouldn’t have happened.

Yang Kai turned to look at her and shook his head slowly.

Zhang Ruo Xi started bawling and spoke in a choking voice, “Sir, it has been Ruo Xi’s greatest honour to have been raised by you! Ruo Xi could not have been happier being able to serve you for so many years. The only regret Ruo Xi has is that she has always held you back instead of helping you. Ruo Xi cannot accompany you by your side anymore, so you must take good care of yourself!”

Yang Kai’s expression changed drastically as he exclaimed, “Ruo Xi, what are you trying to do!?”

Without replying to him, Zhang Ruo Xi swept a glance over Shi Huo and the other Monster Kings before eventually staring fixedly at Fan Wu, her gaze, which was drenched in tears, suddenly turning cold as she spoke in a grim and resolute voice, “Since I’ve violated the Ancient Lands’s taboo, I’ll atone for my crime with my life. I hope that will settle the wrath in all of your hearts; however, if you still make things difficult for Sir after my death, I’ll transform into the most horrible ghost and retaliate against all of you! I swear I shall haunt you all for the rest of your lives and take every chance to curse you to death!”

The expressions of all the Monster Kings changed when they heard this and even Fan Wu and the other Divine Venerables were shocked. It was apparent to them that Zhang Ruo Xi was trying to ensure Yang Kai’s safety by sacrificing herself, which went to show how steadfast her determination was.

She was willing to make such a pledge before her death, and if her wish wasn’t granted, she would really turn into a horrible ghost and harass all of them. At that instant, all the Monster Kings felt a sense of coldness down their backs.

Zhang Ruo Xi turned her head and looked dazedly at Yang Kai, her tears slipping down her face as the light of longing and reluctance shone within them. In a choking voice, she uttered, “Sir, if there is an afterlife, Ruo Xi would still be willing to serve you!”

As soon as she finished her words, she raised her hand and circulated her Source Qi on her palm before palming towards the top of her skull. If she managed to hit herself with her palm, she would definitely lose her life.

“Damn it!” Yang Kai widened his eyes in shock as he made a move and disappeared from the spot.

“Where do you think you’re going?” Shi Huo sneered and stepped forward before he struck the Void with his dark flaming fist.

With a loud boom, Yang Kai’s figure appeared again, his bones cracking as his vitality churned chaotically. After spitting a mouthful of blood, he roared uncontrollably as he was gripped by a sense of excruciating pain. Before he even landed on the ground, he disappeared in mid-air again.

Shi Huo snorted, “Your Space Divine Ability is indeed elusive, but I can still see some leftover traces with my eyes!”

Upon finishing his words, he threw a kick in the air, upon which Yang Kai appeared again as he fell to the ground, rolling in the dirt.

“Shi Huo!” Yang Kai bellowed as he stopped himself from tumbling and leaped to his feet. With bloodshot eyes, he glowered at Shi Huo as his fury permeated the air. He just wanted to save Zhang Ruo Xi, but such a simple wish couldn’t be granted as Shi Huo blocked his teleportation twice.

After Yang Kai finished speaking, Shi Huo suddenly appeared above Yang Kai’s head and knocked him down with a punch. Following that, he pressed his foot against Yang Kai as though he was stepping on an ant.

*Pu…*

Upon being stepped on, Yang Kai sprayed out a mouthful of golden blood. With difficulty, he turned his head to look at Zhang Ruo Xi in despair. After he was stopped by Shi Huo several times, he had already missed the best chance to save her and was extremely worried that she had already lost her life.

The excruciating pain he felt in his body was unbearable, but it was nothing compared to the pain he felt in his heart. It was as though countless knives were jabbed into his chest at the same time, causing him to suffocate.

Zhang Ruo Xi was a soft-spoken, shy, and obedient young girl who was extremely loyal to him. She left the Zhang Family in Maplewood City with him and ventured into this beautiful yet dangerous world, but before she could truly experience its magnificence, she lost her life here in this place.

At that moment, Yang Kai hated himself for being weak. At the same time, he regretted the fact that he allowed the young girl to tag along and let her experience all the dangers of this world. She should have stayed in the Zhang Family and looked for a husband. After that, she would raise her own children and spend the rest of her life with her family in peace.

Warm liquid slid down from the corner of his eyes as his vision blurred. Yang Kai could still see that Zhang Ruo Xi was facing him on her knees, and her hand was now right above the top of her head; however, her wrist had been grabbed by another hand.

“Hahaha!” Yang Kai was startled for a moment before he started laughing hysterically. It was as though he was over the moon, his joyful laugh in stark contrast with the perilous situation he was in. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Shi Huo’s expression darkened as he exerted more force with his leg, upon which Yang Kai stopped laughing and sprayed out more golden blood. Still, through clenched teeth he shouted, “Senior Luan Feng, I owe you a favour!”

The person who had stopped Zhang Ruo Xi from killing herself was Luan Feng, who was standing right behind her. Given Luan Feng’s power, Zhang Ruo Xi would never be able to kill herself without Luan Feng’s permission.

With a conflicted expression, Luan Feng scolded, “Mind your own business.”

Yang Kai was about to be killed soon, but he still told Luan Feng that he owed her a favour, which was basically useless. Even if he managed to survive, such a favour was probably worthless.

Luan Feng was simply moved by Zhang Ruo Xi’s determination and didn’t have the heart to watch such a tragedy happen. After all, she was a woman too, despite being a Divine Spirit, she still had a sentimental side.

“Let me go!” Zhang Ruo Xi obstinately raised her head and glowered at Luan Feng, who was so powerful that even cultivators in the Third-Order Emperor Realm had to back down when confronted by her. However, at that moment, Zhang Ruo Xi appeared utterly incensed, her lips bleeding as she tried to struggle out of her grip as she snarled, “You evil woman! Let go!”

Luan Feng dispassionately uttered, “Even if you kill yourself, your Sir won’t be able to leave alive, so what point is there in sacrificing yourself?”

She had figured out that Shi Huo had never intended to let Yang Kai off, as he was someone who would seek revenge for the slightest grievance.

Zhang Ruo Xi was startled for a moment before she seemed to comprehend her situation and pleaded in a choking voice, “Senior, please have mercy and save Sir. I will do anything for you in exchange, just please save him…”

Of all the people at the scene, only the remaining three Divine Venerables had the capability to stop Shi Huo. Zhang Ruo Xi had figured this out, which was why she decided to plead with Luan Feng now.

Luan Feng looked down at her and uttered impassively, “Didn’t you just say I’m an evil woman?”

Upon hearing that, Zhang Ruo Xi immediately raised her other hand and slapped herself forcefully as she replied, “I should have minded my language. Senior, please have mercy and forgive me ignorance. Please save Sir…”

The sound of Zhang Ruo Xi slapping herself was loud as she didn’t go easy on herself. After a few slaps, her cheek had swollen, and the corner of her mouth was drenched in blood; however, she exerted more force every time she slapped herself, as though she couldn’t feel pain. While the faces of the Monster Kings watching twitched while the Stone Spirit Clan growled but were powerless to help her.
