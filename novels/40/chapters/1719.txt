Ye Xi Yun presided over High Heaven Sect’s general affairs, so there was no need for Yang Kai to put much effort into it. Even if Yang Kai was not there, everything would be handled properly.

After finishing his discussion with the Elders, Yang Kai went to see his Little Senior Sister again.

This trip to Shadowed Soul Island, Yang Kai’s biggest gain was naturally the ten thousand or so Shadowed Heaven Lotus of different colours. With so many Shadowed Heaven Lotuses, even if Yang Kai personally took action to refine them, it would take a lot of time and effort.

But for Xia Ning Chang, this was not an issue.

To her, Alchemy was cultivating.

Shadowed Heaven Lotus and Shadowed Heaven Pills could not be found in the outside world, so, Xia Ning Chang was very interested in them. After obtaining all the herbs and the pill recipe, she immediately entered retreat to focus on Alchemy.

Yang Kai was certain that High Heaven Sect would have a large number of Shadowed Heaven Pills in the near future, and with these special Body Tempering pills, the overall strength of High Heaven Sect would undoubtedly rise to a new level.

Yang Kai also had his own arrangements for these Shadowed Heaven Pills that would soon be released. Although ten thousand Shadowed Heaven Lotuses seemed like a huge number, if they were all refined into pills, they would produce only about seventy or eighty thousand pills at most.

Currently, there were over ten thousand High Heaven Sect disciples, so these seventy thousand pills could naturally not be freely distributed to everyone.

Besides the Origin Returning Realm masters who would be eligible to receive a certain amount of Shadowed Heaven Pills for body tempering, Yang Kai intended to have Shadowed Heaven Pills be distributed as rewards to the common disciples that made contributions to High Heaven Sect.

Of course, this was just some initials plans Yang Kai had thought up. If he wanted to implement them, he would need to first wait some time to see how the situation developed. Also, he didn’t plan to handle this matter personally and was intending to simply hand it over to Ye Xi Yun to manage.

After leaving Pill King Peak where Xia Ning Chang was, Yang Kai went straight to the sixth layer of the Flowing Flame Sand Field where Yang Yan was sleeping.

Upon arriving on the second level of the simple loft, Yang Yan noticed him and immediately pulled his Soul Avatar into her Knowledge Sea.

Just like the situation when they met last time, the pair’s Soul Avatars sat cross-legged opposite one another while a sea of extremely hot flames burned down below.

“I heard Ye Xi Yun say you went out to hunt down the Insect Emperor. How did it go?” Yang Yan asked.

“Now that I am the Star Master of Shadowed Star, how do think it ended?” Yang Kai grinned meaningfully.

“En, seems like he’s dead,” Yang Yan gently nodded, letting out a slight sigh in the next moment, “The Insect Emperor was a high-level master as well, but now, he fell in your hands. If his enemies were to learn about this, they likely wouldn’t be able to believe it.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Yang Kai thought otherwise. Even if the Insect Emperor was an extremely powerful cultivator at one point, that was over ten thousand years ago. After his cultivation fell sharply, not even reaching the Origin King Realm, fighting the current Yang Kai on Shadowed Star was nothing short of suicide.

Of course, the biggest reason Yang Kai was able to kill the Insect Emperor was that Yang Yan had given him Shadowed Star’s Source. If not for this, with Yang Kai’s current ability, there was no way he could have killed the Insect Emperor.

His escape ability was simply too profound, to the point where even an ordinary Origin King would be helpless to hunt him down.

“Your harvest wasn’t small either, was it?” Yang Yan grinned lightly, “There must have been many good things on the Insect Emperor.”

“I didn’t actually find many good things, only the Soul Splitting Saber as well as a bracelet-like artifact.”

The Soul Splitting Saber and the bracelet-like artifact were both undoubtedly Emperor Artifacts, similar to the Annihilation Thunder Bead, Sealed World Bead, and Three Blazing Flame Rings. As for the role of the Soul Splitting Saber, Yang Kai knew that it was a powerful Soul-type artifact. Unfortunately, since it was an Emperor Artifact, it was currently too difficult for Yang Kai to effectively use. So, he could only slowly refine it and look forward to the day when he could wield it.

However, Yang Kai was completely confused about the bracelet artifact, not even knowing what its purpose held.

“The Insect Enslavement Bracelet?” Yang Yan raised her brow as she recalled the artifact’s name.

“It’s called the Insect Enslavement Bracelet?” Yang Kai parroted back.

“En, the artifacts the Insect Emperor used were all famous, and needless to say the Soul Splitting Saber and Insect Enslavement Bracelet were the most famous among them!”

“Oh? What use does this thing have then?” Yang Kai suddenly became interested.

“The Insect Enslavement Bracelet has many uses,” Yang Yan lightly smiled, “Not only is this artifact inherently capable of restraining all types of Exotic Insects, even having some suppressive effects on smaller Monster Beasts, but if the insects are raised inside of it, they will all become terrifying. If those insects were to be released, they would have no problem destroying the entire Star Field.”

Yang Kai’s expression became solemn as he asked in amazement, “There are Exotic Insects inside this Insect Enslavement Bracelet?”

Yang Yan giggled, “Where do you think the Insect Emperor kept those little things? Do you think he kept them all inside his body or something? The Insect Enslavement Bracelet is where he keeps all his Exotic Insects. He has several dozen, if not a hundred or so different species of Exotic Ancient Insects, many of which were thought to be extinct. Each of them is ruthless and serve a different purpose. In the past, I suffered greatly thanks to that Insect Enslavement Bracelet.”

The more Yang Kai listened, the brighter his eyes became, as if he had discovered a Heaven defying secret.

“Interested?” Yang Yan teased.

“To be honest, a little,” Yang Kai gradually calmed himself, “But I still think that cultivation should focus on one’s self first. This kind of control and enslavement method can only serve as an auxiliary. If one really spends all their effort on this kind of thing, I’m afraid they’re only sacrificing substance for style.”

Yang Yan shook her head slowly, “The Dao is split into three thousand paths, and insect enslavement one of them. If it were not a legitimate path to tread, the Insect Emperor would never have reached such heights in his day. It can only be said that your way and the Insect Emperor’s are different.”

“Our ways are different...” Yang Kai thoughtfully.

Yang Yan chuckled, “It’s still too early for you to think about such things, you should first break through to the Origin King Realm. After reaching the Origin King Realm, you’ll be able to see more and farther.”

“Above the Origin King Realm, is there an even higher realm?” Yang Kai asked suddenly.

“Naturally there is.”

“What about you?” Yang Kai looked at Yang Yan with scorching eyes.

“I exist above that realm!” Yang Yan replied lightly.

Yang Kai fell silent. From the information revealed by Yang Yan just now, it was not difficult for him to infer that there was indeed a higher realm above the Origin King Realm, and another above that as well; Yang Yan apparently belonged to that higher realm.

Before learning this, Yang Kai had not felt anything in particular, but after knowing about it, he felt that he was standing at the bottom of a mountain, looking up at its majestic heights, its peak still shrouded in clouds and mist, making him unable to see the complete scenery in front of him.

The road ahead was endless, the Martial Dao had no peak.

Yang Yan did not speak any more, choosing instead to observe Yang Kai’s reaction. She noticed that he had not become daunted or discouraged, but instead, after a short silence, his expression became relaxed while a burning flame lit in his eyes, showing a deep desire that filled his heart.

Yang Yan pursed her lips and smiled while applauding, “Your mentality is praiseworthy.”

Yang Kai replied bluntly, “I’ve cultivated for several dozen years now, crossing each boundary one step at a time, but even now I have only achieved some small successes. Even if the road ahead is thorny and difficult, I can only use all my might to traverse it so that sooner or later, I can stand at that same height as you and see the world as you see it!”

Yang Yan covered her red lips with her delicate small hand and smiled, “Should I call you a promising young man?”

“It’s up to you!” Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders and teased, “As long as you aren’t afraid of calling yourself old.”

Yang Yan immediately glared at him.

“By the way, can I use this Insect Enslavement Bracelet now?” Yang Kai asked.

“You better not,” Yang Yan’s expression became solemn, “The Exotic Insects inside the Insect Enslavement Bracelet are extremely fierce. With your current cultivation, even if you released them, you would not be able to command or control them, only resulting in severe backlash. Did you even see the Insect Emperor use that Insect Enslavement Bracelet against you?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “He only used the Ten Thousand Poison Evil Insect from beginning to end to control his subordinates or to perform Soul seizing.”

“That’s right, even the Insect Emperor didn’t dare to use it, let alone you. Wait until you reach the Origin King Realm first.”

“I understand!” Yang Kai nodded lightly. In any case, he now had so many methods at his disposal that he did not have much use for the Insect Enslavement Bracelet.

Next, Yang Kai told Yang Yan about Shadowed Soul Island and his speculations about it. Regarding this matter, Yang Yan did not deny anything and told him it was indeed sealed off by her.

However, Yang Yan did not explain why she sealed it or what was hidden inside.

“I can only tell you that inside Shadowed Soul Island is a door! If you really want to open it, you must first gather all the Star Emperor Tokens. Once you do, you’ll naturally understand.”

After leaving Yang Yan’s place, Yang Kai went to Snow and Ice Peak again.

Snow and Ice Peak was one of the eighty-one peaks of High Heaven Sect; one of the seventy-two auxiliary peaks with rich World Energy and beautiful scenery.

What was different though was that below it, was an Ice Attribute Earth Vein, so within a few dozen kilometres of Snow and Ice Peak, the climate was extremely cold regardless of what time of year it was. The temperature here was extremely low and occasionally there was heavy snow falling, blanketing the peak in a silvery-white colour.

This situation became even more obvious after Su Yan moved to Snow and Ice Peak.

Since Su Yan became the owner of Snow and Ice Peak, the cold aura here almost became so strong that it could not be melted. A cultivator with a slightly lower strength could not even get close to Snow and Ice Peak while the stronger ones would need to circulate their Saint Qi to resist the ambient cold.

However, this kind of environment was extremely comfortable for Su Yan.

Few others lived on Snow and Ice Peak, only the original Elders of Ice Sect: Qing Ya, Qian Yue, and Qian Hao.

Yang Kai went straight to the southwest corner of Snow and Ice Peak.

On the ground, there was a thick layer of ice that reflected the shining sun.

In the southwest corner, under a giant tree covered in silvery-white snow, Su Yan sat cross-legged beside the Ten Thousand Year Ice Jade Pedestal with a pair of white Saint Qi wings spread out from her pack, a dignified and sacred look covering her beautiful face. At this moment, Su Yan was forming a series of strange seals with her hands while a metre in front of her, Profound Frost, the sword she obtained from Ice Heart Valley, was suspended mid-air. As Su Yan gently breathed, the Ice Attribute Energy in the atmosphere flowed towards her and poured into her body, causing her white wings to lightly flap.

With Su Yan as the centre, within a thousand-metre radius, there was a peculiar aura permeating the air which seemed able to freeze everything in existence.

It was her Shi. It was close to the grand accomplishment stage!
