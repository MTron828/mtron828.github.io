Did this boy want to unify the whole realm and make the Demon Race and Monster Race submit to him?

Just thinking so, Zhang Yuan’s expression became stern.

It wasn’t that he was particularly small-minded. On the contrary, Zhang Yuan had a heroic spirit, similar to most Demon Race and Monster Race masters, but as the Demon Commander, he had to consider this possibility.

Thunder Dragon was also thinking so. If this was the case, even if the Demon and Monster Races joined forces, they wouldn’t be able to resist, so they could only allow matters to take their course or face disaster.

Hearing his question, Yang Kai glanced at him thoughtfully then smiled, “Demon Commander Zhang doesn’t need to worry, I won’t be staying long. In fact, I’m afraid I will be departing quite soon.”

“You’ll be leaving soon?” Zhang Yuan was taken aback, exchanging a glance with Thunder Dragon, both of them extremely surprised.

Yang Kai didn’t seem to have any ambitions of conquest...

“Yes, the wonders of the Star Field are quite unforgettable, so I don’t plan to remain here for long,” Yang Kai laughed.

Thunder Dragon’s eyes lit up, and he asked quickly, “Is the Star Field truly filled with such excitement? If so, can Holy Master Yang tell us about it?”

The other masters from the Three Clans also perked up their ears as they stared towards Yang Kai, listening carefully.

“Yes, please talk about it, this old master is also very curious,” Chu Ling Xiao smiled and said. Although he had heard much about the Star Field from Ling Tai Xu after he came here, this was still second-hand knowledge and lacked a certain flavour of realism. What Yang Kai had seen and heard with his own eyes and ears would naturally have a more profound weight, so now that Yang Kai was here, Chu Ling Xiao would naturally want to ask him about it.

“Since Martial Ancestor has asked, Disciple will naturally not refuse,” Yang Kai chuckled. After pondering for a while, he began speaking, “There are indeed many wonders in the Star Field, many things we have never even dreamed of before...”

Inside the hall, everyone listened with the utmost concentration.

Time passed little by little, but no one’s enthusiasm faded. On the contrary, their expressions only became more excited.

The vastness of the Star Field amazed them again and again, and the talk of wondrous sceneries and abundant cultivation materials made them yearn greatly. Above the Saint Realm was the Saint King Real, then the Origin Returning Realm, then the Origin King Realm, knowledge that made them blush with embarrassment.

They fully understood the meaning of the words frog at the bottom of the well.

According to Yang Kai, the World Energy of most Cultivation Stars in the Star Field was extremely rich, and Saints were nothing in such places. Only when one reached the Origin Returning Realm could they barely be counted as master, and only Origin Kings could be considered true powerhouses.

Everyone’s blood was burning as their eyes flashed with desire and hope.

They longed to have such a cultivation environment and abundant cultivation materials. They were eager to go further on the Martial Dao and become legendary Saint Kings, Origin Returning Realm masters, and even Origin Kings...

Yang Kai did not make any kind of embellishment or exaggeration in his descriptions, instead just calmly explaining what he had learned about the Star Field and what he had seen and heard over the decades.

However, this was enough. After he finished speaking, everyone’s mood had become chaotic and they were unable to calm themselves down for a long time.

Yang Kai had seen all kinds of wonderful and magical things, but they had been stuck on Tong Xuan Realm, a place most Star Field cultivators would be completely indifferent to, using materials those cultivators would treat as garbage. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

This discovery made everyone depressed, ashamed, and even deeply embarrassed!

Zhang Yuan and Thunder Dragon, who had just been at each other’s throats before, now couldn’t help exchanging a glance and laughing bitterly. Suddenly, they felt that their previous fight was naive and pointless...

“En, the Star Field is truly filled with wonders! This old master wishes he could take a look. If this old master could experience this kind of magical scene in his lifetime, he would be able to die without regrets!” Chu Ling Xiao took a deep breath and declared.

Thunder Dragon and Zhang Yuan also opened their mouths, seemingly wanting to say something, but in the end, they were unable to.

Silence filled the hall for some time before Zhang Yuan sighed and asked in a somewhat depressed tone, “Then dare I ask, Holy Master Yang, for what reason have you called the masters of the Three Clans here this time?”

Hearing his question, Thunder Dragon quickly turned his gaze to Yang Kai, also quite curious.

Yang Kai smiled and responded, “To lead you to the Star Field!”

A single stone thrown had sent out a thousand waves. Everyone was clearly shaken by these words, and their eyes filled with excitement as they looked towards Yang Kai, as they had never expected him to say such a thing.

It was undeniable that the previous descriptions Yang Kai had given them had aroused their yearning and curiosity towards the Star Field, and everyone present earnestly wished to experience it for themselves.

But... Was the Star Field that easy to enter? They could not reach the Star Field, so they could only dream about it while envying Yang Kai’s opportunity and admiring his courage and strength.

But now, Yang Kai had actually extended an open invitation to them.

Everyone was stunned.

“Of course, I won’t force any of you, this is only a proposition. I will be leaving after some time, and those who are willing to follow me can. As for those who are unwilling, they can remain. I came back specially for this purpose,” Yang Kai added.

“Is that true?” Zhang Yuan stood up abruptly as he stared at Yang Kai with scorching eyes.

“Holy Master Yang, you’re not joking, right?” Thunder Dragon also asked incredulously.

Although they didn’t know exactly how difficult it was to bring someone into the Star Field, it definitely wouldn’t be easy. If Yang Kai had such ability, he would give priority to his relatives and friends from the Human Race, but now he was making an offer to the Demon and Monster Races as well. Both Zhang Yuan and Thunder Dragon couldn’t believe what they were hearing and were more than a little confused in their excitement.

“I’m not joking,” Yang Kai replied seriously.

After receiving an affirmative answer, Zhang Yuan and Thunder Dragon were both stunned.

After a long, stunned silence, Zhang Yuan asked solemnly, “Dare I ask Holy Master Yang, what kind of price do we need to pay? Pledge our loyalty and submit to you?”

“Haha...” Yang Kai smiled, a trace of disdain appearing on his face as he said lightly, “Why would I need you to submit to me or give me your loyalty? En, to be perfectly blunt, with a single finger I can force all of Tong Xuan Realm to bow down to me. If I wanted you to submit and swear your allegiance to me, there would be no need for any nonsense, I could just use force to suppress you directly.”

Zhang Yuan and Thunder Dragon both began sweating...

Neither of them thought Yang Kai was blustering. From Yang Kai’s previous explanation, with his current tyrannical cultivation, none of them could put up any resistance against him.

This young man had already surpassed the legendary Great Demon God of the Demon Race! He had travelled further and stood at a higher peak.

Even if Great Demon God resurrected and appeared here now, he would likely only be able to look up to him.

“Then why is Holy Master Yang...” Thunder Dragon looked at Yang Kai hesitantly.

“Everyone here is an old friend, if I can offer you a helping hand, why wouldn’t I? I have no other motives,” Yang Kai said lightly.

Both Zhang Yuan and Thunder Dragon instantly felt ashamed, wishing they could find holes to crawl into and never come out of again.

Swiftly, Zhang Yuan cupped his fists and said in a dignified tone, “Holy Master Yang is a man of high character and integrity. It was this Zhang Yuan who was overly suspicious and pessimistic. If this Zhang has offended Holy Master Yang in any way, please forgive me!”

Thunder Dragon quickly expressed his sincere apologies as well.

“It’s fine, you two are leaders of your respective clans, you should be considering things more critically,” Yang Kai waved his hand lightly, indicating he didn’t mind their suspicions. If he was in their place, he would be behaving the same way.

The two masters both relaxed hearing this.

“While there are many wonders in the Star Field, there should also be many dangers too, correct? If Holy Master Yang brings so many people into the Star Field, will you be able to shelter them?” Thunder Dragon asked with some worry.

“There are dangers, so whether you follow me or not is completely up to you. Of course, you can also choose to remain here. Perhaps Tong Xuan Realm will be rejuvenated one day and become like other Cultivation Stars in the Star Field where you can sense a higher level of the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao; however, I don’t know how long that will take.” Yang Kai smiled lightly as he glanced over at Xia Ning Chang meaningfully.

After refining the Star Source, becoming a Star Master, and breaking through to the Origin Returning Realm, Xia Ning Chang’s aura had become considerably stronger, and the grey aura which had lingered about her had also become much lighter.

As long as she could continue to break through at this speed, one day she would be able to stand at the top of the Star Field, and at that time, all of Tong Xuan Realm would benefit.

“This matter is of great significance, so please allow me a few days, Holy Master Yang. I need to discuss this carefully with my clansmen,” Zhang Yuan said.

“Naturally,” Yang Kai gently nodded.

Immediately, Yang Kai ordered some of the disciples to show the Demon and Monster Race masters to their accommodations so they could have some private conversations.

There was no need for negotiations on the Human Race side. Nine Heavens Holy Land, Yang Kai’s relatives and friends from the Great Han Dynasty and even Soaring Heaven Sect immediately decided to follow Yang Kai to the Star Field. Of course, some disciples were unwilling to leave their native home and wanted to remain in their original Sect, so the various Human Race masters simply granted them their permission.

Not everyone had a fearless spirit and thirst for adventure; in order to gamble one’s life for as of yet unseen wonders, great courage and a strong yearning for a higher Martial Dao were necessary.

However, there weren’t many people who refused, only about thirty percent of each Sect.

Everyone dispersed, as there was much they needed to handle.

Soon, after the hall emptied, Yang Kai smiled and walked over to a pair of women who appeared to be twin sisters.

As Yang Kai approached, the breathing of the two women seemed to quicken slightly, as if they were very excited.

“Jiao’er, Mei’er, long time no see,” Yang Kai smiled and greeted.

There had been too many people just now, so he hadn’t had time to personally greet the Hu Sisters, but now that he was free, he naturally wanted to speak with them a bit.

Moreover, they seemed to be waiting here for him for that purpose.

The two women opposite him smiled and spoke in unison, “It has been a long time, have you been doing well?”

“I have indeed!” Yang Kai nodded before he frowned slightly awkwardly.

His eyes kept glancing between these two, but he still could not tell who was Hu Jiao’er and who was Hu Mei’er.

This discovery made him scratch his head in confusion.

The two sisters had cultivated the Twin Qi Shared Spirit Divine Art, so not only had their appearances become exactly the same, even their temperaments and the life auras coming from their bodies were identical.

It was as if they were one person standing here!

Moreover, their cultivation had actually reached the Second-Order Saint Realm rather than the First-Order that Great Elder Xu Hui had reported to him earlier.

This rate of cultivation was quite astonishing, leaving Yang Kai somewhat speechless.
