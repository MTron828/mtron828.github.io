Wen Zi Shan opened his mouth, but before he could say anything, Lei Hong’s body had already flashed away with a crackle. Enveloping the other Star Soul Palace members, he transformed into a streak of light and flew towards the distance.

“The one surnamed Lei, you come back!” Zhu Lie suddenly shouted, voice spreading far and wide, “My Dragon Island will never forgive you Southern Territory cultivators for treating a member of the Dragon Clan this way!”

Lei Hong of course did not stop but instead fled even faster, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

He originally wanted to ask Yang Kai about the situation of his Dragon Transformation Secret Technique, but how could he still be in the mood to do so? He just wanted to get as far away from here as possible.

Staring in the direction that Lei Hong ran off in, Yang Kai laughed. But suddenly, he stopped and turned around to see Gao Xue Ting, Wen Zi Shan, and the others looking speechlessly at him.

“What should we do now?” Gao Xue Ting asked.

“I don’t know!” Yang Kai had an innocent expression on his face. Only, paired with his Half-Dragon Form appearance at this moment, it looked particularly ferocious.

“Why not just let him go?” Chen Qian suggested in a quiet voice. She was very afraid of the Dragon Island’s might and also couldn’t bear seeing Zhu Lie being beaten up so miserably.

Zhu Lie gritted his teeth “That’s right. If you’re smart, then you should let me go right now, or this definitely won’t end well for you!”

Yang Kai stomped his foot down again and snorted, “Know your place before you speak, little brat!”

“I’m a member of the Dragon Clan, how dare you treat me like this!” Zhu Lie looked humiliated.

“So what if you’re from the Dragon Clan? Aren’t you still crawling under my feet?”

Zhu Lie flushed crimson as he buried his face into the ground as if he couldn’t wait to find a hole to crawl into and no longer show his face to the world.

“Can’t let him go, can’t kill him either…” Wen Zi Shan laughed bitterly, “You little brat, you really brought me a big problem here.”

The Dragon Clan’s pride was legendary, so if he were really released after being humiliated this way by Yang Kai, then how could Zhu Lie be willing to let the matter rest? He would probably send word to Dragon Island immediately, then a large number of Great Dragons would come in a few days in pursuit of him. And of course, killing him was also impossible. If Zhu Lie was really killed, then they would really start a feud with Dragon Island. Not even a Great Emperor Sect could withstand the wrath of Dragon Island, let alone Azure Sun Temple.

Yang Kai waved his hand, “Forget it. You don’t have to worry about this anymore. I will take responsibility for my own actions.”

Gao Xue Ting asked, “What are you planning to do?”

Yang Kai shrugged, “I can’t kill him or let him go, so I can only imprison him. What else can I do?”

Zhu Lie was shocked at his words. He looked up at him and bellowed, “You dare?!”

Yang Kai sneered, “Open your dog eyes wide and see for yourself whether I dare or not.”

As he spoke, he tossed out his hand, and an antique-looking bell appeared in front of him. As it spun in the sky, the bell grew rapidly in size.

Zhu Lie had obviously perceived the danger of this bell. It might look inconspicuous and simple, but it gave him a strong feeling of suppression. If he were really trapped by this thing, then there would be no way for him to escape.

He tried to struggle, but was met with another round of beating from Yang Kai, one that left him grimacing in pain.

The Mountains and Rivers Bell descended, trapping Zhu Lie inside it. Yang Kai jumped out in a flash and the sound of Zhu Lie cursing and his storm of attacks could immediately be heard from within the bell. With just one hand seal from Yang Kai though, the noise died down.

After all, the Mountains and Rivers Bell was an Exotic Ancient Artifact that could suppress all creation. Even the Phoenix True Fire was suppressed beneath it for several tens of thousands of years and could not break free. Even though Zhu Lie was a Dragon, there was nothing he could do if he was really trapped by the bell.

“This isn’t a long-term solution!” Wen Zi Shan sighed.

Yang Kai said, “Temple Master, you should focus on the Demon Spirits and the Great Emperor’s order instead. Just leave him to me. I assure you he’ll become obedient within a month.”

“It’s best if you have the confidence, but everything must be done in moderation.” After saying that, Wen Zi Shan led the others away.

If not for all sorts of ripples that emerged before, then he would definitely find a way to deal with Zhu Lie first, but right now, for the temple, and the Southern Territory as a whole, the most important thing they had to do was track down those Demon Spirits and the Bustling World Great Emperor. Wu Kuang had now taken over Duan Hong Chen’s body, and nobody knew what he was going to do with it.

Tens of thousands of years ago, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor plagued the world and caused the deaths of countless lives. Compared to him, the anger of Dragon Island was secondary.

In just a few days, the entire Southern Territory began to move. Billions of cultivators in the Southern Territory were mobilized under the Great Emperor’s Demon Banishment Order.

Yang Kai did not participate in this campaign, however, and had been resting on Spirit Sword Peak during the past few days.

Even though a demon sealing ground had appeared below Spirit Sword Peak, the Demon Spirits sealed inside had all fled, and the ruins left behind were neither dangerous nor special. So, Spirit Sword Peak remained Yang Kai’s personal spirit peak. The Mountains and Rivers Bell had already been moved to Spirit Sword Peak by Yang Kai, but Zhu Lie’s cursing never stopped for a moment, disturbing his peace.

Every day, Yang Kai would go over and teach him a lesson.

After losing his special Dragon Scale, Zhu Lie was no longer a match for Yang Kai. In front of Yang Kai who had unleashed his Dragon Transformation Secret Art, Zhu Lie couldn’t even assume his Dragon form.

Dragons were incredibly resilient, though, so no matter how badly Yang Kai beat him, Zhu Lie would become as good as new the next day.

Zhu Lie was also hard-headed. He probably knew that there was no way Yang Kai would really kill him, so no matter how miserably he was beaten, his tongue never went soft for an instant. More often than not, he would just glare at Yang Kai with an unyielding look in his eyes as if he were saying, ‘what are you going to do about me?’

After half a month like this, good news finally came.

Many of the Demon Spirits that had escaped from Spirit Sword Peak’s demon sealing ground had been found. In the cleanup operation, most of the Demon Spirits were exterminated, but the Southern Territory also incurred great losses. However, as people learned more about the Demon Spirits, they also found many ways to restrain them, making it far less likely they would be easily corrupted anymore.

But whether it be Yang Kai, Wen Zi Shan, or the other Emperor Realm Masters of the Southern Territory, they knew that the Demon Spirits that were exterminated were not all of them. The troublesome ones were those that remained in hiding.

No one knew whose body those Demon Spirits were hiding in, and no one knew when they would reveal themselves again. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Throughout this whole ordeal, they heard no news from the Bustling World Great Emperor or Wu Kuang.

Since the day Wu Kuang took over Duan Hong Chen’s body and left Azure Sun Temple, it was as if he had evaporated from the world. No one saw him again.

Just like the Demon Spirits in hiding, he had become a thorn in the side of the Southern Territory, and there was a constant risk of that wound festering.

From what Gao Xue Ting told Yang Kai, despite the Bright Moon Great Emperor taking action personally, they still failed to find any useful clues about Wu Kuang’s whereabouts. As such, he had left Star Soul Palace in order to handle this situation and went to look for the Heavens Revelations Great Emperor, hoping to seek help from him.

Yang Kai went into the Divine Ascension Mirror again and spent 3,000 Elder Contribution Points to bring out Tian Yan’s Soul from inside.

It was time for him to fulfil his agreement with Tian Yan.

The Flesh Incarnation Pill had been refined a long time ago, so when Yang Kai sent Nanmen Da Jun back to High Heaven Place, he also took a moment to visit Ji Ying and brought back all the Emperor Pills he had refined to Azure Sun Temple. It was with these Emperor Pills that Yang Kai was able to accumulate Elder Contribution Points so quickly to use the Divine Ascension Mirror. Otherwise, he would not have been able to enter the Divine Ascension World again.

It was nighttime. The moon hung bright in the sky alongside a few stars.

Above Spirit Sword Peak, a strong barrier Spirit Array was arranged, and Yang Kai even turned on the Protection Array to prevent any mishaps.

Tonight was the night when Tian Yan was going to mould his flesh body.

Wen Zi Shan, who had received the news, also came over to stand guard personally. He occupied an Array Node of the array set up by Nanmen Da Jun, which had the ability to stabilize Souls, with a solemn expression. Tian Yan was a Soul with no physical body after all. It was his first time leaving the Divine Ascension World and being brought to the Star Boundary by Yang Kai. If there was nothing to anchor his Soul in place, then it could be extinguished very quickly.

The World Principles of the Divine Ascension World and the World Principles of the Star Boundary were very different after all.

With a solemn expression, Yang Kai calmed his mind and concentrated, only opening his eyes after a long time, “Senior. The time has come.”

It was three-quarters past midnight, the time of day where Yin Qi was the densest.

As he spoke, he extended his hand and pointed in front of him.

A small light bloomed before spreading out, forming Tian Yan’s shape.

It was with the help of the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus that Yang Kai was able to bring Tian Yan’s Soul out of the Divine Ascension World. If not for the existence of a Supreme Treasure like the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus, then Tian Yan wouldn’t even be able to leave that mirror world.

His body looked illusory and translucent, just like a ghost that could scatter in the wind, a mere Soul Avatar.

As soon as he appeared, Tian Yan frowned. Something seemed to be making him uncomfortable as there was a vague look of pain on his face.

There was a rumble in the sky at that moment, then a bang as an extremely strong will and force flooded in from all directions, ignoring the power of the many Spirit Arrays and Spirit Sword Peak’s Protection Array to press down on Tian Yan.

A being with strength comparable to that of a Great Emperor inexplicably appearing in the world was not something tolerated by the Heavenly Way, so it was no surprise it tried to reject him.

Tian Yan clearly expected this though and forming seals with his hands, a profound power spread out, forming a layer of protection around his body that was visible to the naked eye, resisting the rejection force of the World.

Thunder suddenly boomed atop Spirit Sword Peak and lightning danced wildly in the sky, a scene similar to impending doom.

But the disturbance did not last long. It was not known what amazing means Tian Yan used, but the thunder gradually faded away, and the lightning also disappeared quickly. The omnipresent repulsion force also dissipated.

“There’s not much time. It’s not easy to fool the Heavenly Way.” Tian Yan suddenly opened his eyes and looked at Yang Kai, “Give me the Spirit Pill and stand guard for me.”

Yang Kai had been waiting for this, so with a flick of his wrist, a milky white Spirit Pill flew straight towards Tian Yan.

Even though Tian Yan did not open his mouth, the pill still entered his body.

The milky white glow that spread out was not obvious at first, but as time passed, it became more and more dazzling. Soon, all of Spirit Sword Peak was enveloped by the glow.

Yang Kai opened his eyes wide and pushed his eyesight to the max to observe this scene carefully.

He saw the Flesh Incarnation Pill melting away inside of Tian Yan’s body, turning into countless tiny white lights that were moving towards each part of his Soul Avatar.

A faint vitality suddenly emerged. Just like a candle flame in the middle of a storm, on the edge of being blown out.

Tian Yan then sat down crossed-legged and shut his eyes, becoming perfectly still.
