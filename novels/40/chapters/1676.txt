Chapter 1676, Black Sea City

One day later, the Space Array was repaired.

Yang Kai called Mo Yu, Yang Xiu Zhu, and the others over before bidding farewell to Qian Tong.

Yang Kai was not worried about Shadow Moon Hall at all. Qian Tong was now an Origin King, so it was no exaggeration to say he was the strongest master from Shadowed Star in ten thousand years. If some crisis befell Shadow Moon Hall and he could not handle, then all of Shadowed Star would probably be doomed.

“Brother Yang, may good fortune be with you,” Wei Gu Chang cupped his fists in parting.

Yang Kai responded in kind.

“Yang Kai, where is this Space Array connected?” Mo Yu asked from the side.

“Uh... If I am not mistaken, it should connect to Demon Blood City!”

“What do you mean?” Mo Yu asked hesitantly.

Demon Blood City was very close to the Flowing Flame Sand Field and not far from Clear Sky Sect’s headquarters, so Yang Kai choosing to connect the Space Array to that location wasn’t a surprise, but the way he said it gave Mo Yu some pause.

Yang Kai simply smiled awkwardly and replied, “This is the first time I’ve repaired a Space Array, so I can’t guarantee that we will be directly teleported to Demon Blood City.”

Mo Yu was instantly dumbfounded while Yang Xiu Zhu and others also had speechless expressions.

“Relax,” Yang Kai saw the looks on their faces and knew what they were worried about, so he quickly reassured them, “Even if we aren’t sent directly to Demon Blood City, there will be no danger in this transmission, that much I can guarantee.”

Hearing this, everyone felt relieved.

Teleporting with a Space Array was an extremely delicate matter. If the slightest error was made, one could be banished to the endless Void, never to return. Shadowed Star had records of many such incidents occurring over the years, where a Space Array had some kind of problem with it and someone who was sent through it vanished without a trace as a result, or was spat out on the other side in a million pieces.

So, when everyone heard what Yang Kai said just now, they couldn’t help feeling a little nervous.

But since Yang Kai guaranteed that there would be no danger, they no longer had anything to concern themselves about.

Even if they were sent to the wrong place, it would not matter much.

“Time is short, we should leave immediately,” Yang Xiu Zhu and the others could not wait to return to High Heaven Sect to see how things were there.

Everyone nodded and mounted the Space Array together with Yang Kai standing in the centre and channelling his Saint Qi. In an instant, the Saint Crystals placed into the Space Array flashed a dazzling light and pumped out a massive amount of energy.

Powerful Space Force fluctuations emerged, and the group of people disappeared.

“Destroy this array to prevent others from teleporting in!” As soon as Yang Kai his group disappeared, Qian Tong waved his hand and commanded.

Wei Gu Chang nodded and sent a punch towards the Space Array Yang Kai had just patched, splitting it in half and completely disabling it.

Qian Tong’s eyes flashed then as he turned towards the distance and said in a low tone, “It’s time to return to Shadow Moon Hall!”

Fei Zhi Tu, Wei Gu Chang, and the others straightened their backs as they too turned to gaze in the direction of Shadow Moon Hall, all of them releasing a shocking level of murderous intent.

.....

After travelling through The Void, a light flashed, and Yang Kai and the others re-appeared.

Among the group, everyone felt slightly dizzy besides Yang Kai and it took them a moment to gradually adapt. Most long-distance teleportations were accompanied by such side effects. Only Yang Kai, who cultivated Space Force, was able to ignore these effects.

Fortunately, there was no danger where they appeared, otherwise, all of them would have been taken off guard.

Turning his head and looking around, Yang Xiu Zhu furrowed his brow slightly, “This isn’t Demon Blood City. Where are we?”

The place where everyone appeared was clearly a vast plain that stretched out as far as the eye could see, with no signs of a city anywhere nearby.

Sure enough, something went wrong in the transmission.

Yang Kai had warned this was a possibility beforehand so he naturally felt no need to apologize, simply saying, “We should be somewhere between Demon Blood City and Heavenly Fate City. Does anyone have any impression of this plain?”

Yang Xiu Zhu, Chu Han Yi, and Lin Yu Rao all shook their heads slowly, indicating that they did not recognize this place.

Although they were natives of Shadowed Star, they had spent most of their lives in secluded retreat atop Star Emperor Mountain, so they were not very familiar with the outside world’s geography. Even Yang Kai had a better grasp of Shadowed Star’s landmarks than them, so undoubtedly, it was a bit unrealistic to expect them to know where they were.

However, Mo Yu’s eyes lit up as a look of joy filled his face. After looking around a bit more, he flew up into the sky to get a broader view before returning excitedly.

“I know where we are! This is White Bone Plain, and Heaven Rift Gorge is nearby. We’re only a day away from Black Sea City.”

“Oh? Clear Sky Sect’s Black Sea City?” Yang Kai was surprised.

“Exactly!”

Yang Kai nodded lightly. It seemed that the transmission error was not too big, and for Mo Yu, it actually turned out to be a fortunate accident. Black Sea City was under the jurisdiction of Clear Sky Sect and was located close to its headquarters, sharing a similar relation to Heavenly Fate City and Shadow Moon Hall.

Arriving here was a coincidence, but it helped Mo Yu.

“In that case, we might as well go to Black Sea City first,” Yang Kai thought for a moment before proposing. He urgently needed to inquire about the surroundings of High Heaven Sect, and going to Black Sea City was undoubtedly the best choice.

Moreover, the situation of Black Sea City was unknown to them, so naturally, he wanted to travel together with Mo Yu to investigate and lend his aid if necessary.

After all, this was a minor detour at most.

“Many thanks,” Mo Yu quickly cupped his fists.

This was inside the territory of Clear Sky Sect, so Mo Yu was obviously quite familiar with the terrain and took the lead. Only a day later, everyone saw a towering city standing on a vast plain in the distance.

“That’s Black Sea City!” Mo Yu pointed to the front and introduced.

“There seems to be a fight,” Yang Kai noticed the light of Secret Techniques and artifacts flashing up ahead.

“It’s my Clear Sky Sect’s people!” Mo Yu’s face sank as he increased his speed.

There being a battle near Black Sea City was not necessarily bad news; at the very least it meant that Black Sea City had not been occupied by Corpse Spirit Religion as there were still people resisting. The only question now was how precarious the situation was.

Atop the high walls of Black Sea City, a beautiful woman with a pale face stood tall with a dozen Origin Returning Realm masters gathered around her; however, all of these Origin Realm masters had despondent looks on their faces and all of them were injured to varying degrees. The most seriously wounded of these masters had even lost his right arm. This injury seemed to be quite recent as his shoulder was still wrapped in gauze and fresh blood was oozing out slowly.

This cultivator remained standing though, enduring obvious pain with grit teeth, not uttering a word of complaint.

Below the city wall, several Corpse Spirit Race clansmen covered in white, green, and red hairs were fighting with some Human cultivators.

The situation was very chaotic, and the number of people involved in this battle reached at least thousands, but not all the Human cultivators were fighting for the same side. In fact, many Human cultivators were assisting the Corpse Spirit Race to kill their compatriots.

These people had obviously chosen to submit to Corpse Spirit Religion.

“City Lord, please order them to return! If we wait any longer, I’m afraid they’ll all die!” Atop the wall, someone cupped their fists and implored the beautiful woman with a sad look on his face.

This was a completely hopeless battle. There were ten times as many enemies as allies, with every Black Sea City cultivator being forced to deal with multiple opponents at once.

Six hundred people had rushed out to meet the enemy, but after less than a quarter of an hour, only two hundred remained, and these two hundred were on the verge of collapsing.

“Yes, City Lord, these are the last elites of my Clear Sky Sect. If we let all of them die here, how will we explain to our ancestors in the future?” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“They cannot retreat!” The beautiful woman declared firmly, “The Spirit Array barrier of Black Sea City is still being repaired, and if we have them withdraw now, Black Sea City will be defenceless when Corpse Spirit Religion’s army arrives and everyone here will perish.”

“We are well aware, but...” The person who spoke before argued weakly, his voice full of grief.

The six hundred elites that had charged out had done so just to buy time for the Array Masters to repair the city’s Defensive Spirit Array at the cost of their lives. Black Sea City being able to endure until now was thanks to the many protective barriers and powerful Spirit Arrays it possessed. Without these Spirit Arrays, Corpse Spirit Religion’s army would have razed it to the ground by now.

Now, everyone had reached their limit. Corpse Spirit Religion only needed to organize one last powerful attack and they would likely conquer the city.

Given Corpse Spirit Religion’s typical behaviour, if the city’s defences fell, the millions of residents of Black Sea City would probably be exterminated.

“Damn Gale Pavilion, Hundred Transformations Sect, and Traceless Sect! These traitors used to spend all day flattering my Clear Sky Sect, but now they have become willing dogs of Corpse Spirit Religion and slaughtered my Sect’s disciples. If this old master can survive this, he will definitely make them pay for this in blood!” Someone yelled angrily.

The expressions of the others also turned ugly hearing these words.

Gale Pavilion, Hundred Transformations Sect, and Traceless Sect, as well as many other smaller forces and families used to be attached to Clear Sky Sect, would constantly curry favour when the latter was powerful.

Clear Sky Sect had never abused these forces and even granted them some Secret Techniques to allow them to grow while also allowing a number of their elite disciples to enter Clear Sky Sect every year for cultivation and to seek masters to personally teach them.

However, after Shadowed Star’s great upheaval, these opportunistic forces took the initiative to submit to Corpse Spirit Religion, not only betraying Clear Sky Sect but even launching an unexpected sneak attack on Clear Sky Sect headquarters.

In that battle, Clear Sky Sect headquarters had been destroyed, with only a few people managing to escape, reducing the great force that once stood supreme over a ten thousand kilometres radius area to only Black Sea City!

The beautiful female City Lord said nothing, but the pain in her eyes was obvious.

How many people in this world could maintain just and moral stances in the face of such tyrannical evil? Understanding this, she wasn’t angry at those people who had chosen to live on dishonourably, because doing so meant they lost what made them human in the process.

“Where is Chen Shi Tao!” The beautiful woman suddenly shouted.

Not far away, a woman with peach-eyes and a graceful figure hurried forward, cupped her fists, and reported, “Elder Du, Disciple is here!”

In normal times, such a woman would be the centre of attention of all men, but at this moment, none had the mind to have such frivolous thoughts.

The beautiful woman said majestically, “Chen Shi Tao, this Elder commands you to select three hundred people from my Clear Sky Sect’s younger generation and lead them away from Black Sea City through the Space Array!”

Chen Shi Tao was dazed for a moment, but she was not just beautiful but also intelligent so she immediately understood what the purpose behind this command was, her pretty face turning white as she cried out in protest, “Elder Du!”

The beautiful woman just turned and smiled temperately towards her though, “My Clear Sky Sect’s headquarters has been destroyed, and the Sect Master was killed. Now, the last blood of my Clear Sky Sect is gathered here in Black Sea City. You must take those three hundred people away with you and find some way to survive. Only by living on will my Clear Sky Sect have hope for the future!”
