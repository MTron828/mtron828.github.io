Yang Kai sat in silence in the room.

The problem Tao Ling Wan faced seemed to leave him with no choice.

Since it was her life at stake here, Yang Kai might have to keep her with him at all times, otherwise there was no way to solve it.

However, it was obviously not realistic for him to bring her along. It would be fine if the other side of the Void Corridor was not the Black Ink Battlefield. The two of them could still find their way back slowly if that was the case; however, if the other side was the Black Ink Battlefield, then Tao Ling Wan would die if she followed him in.

That was the same as leaving her here.

After a long silence, Yang Kai stood up, went to the table, poured two glasses of wine, and brought them over. He sat next to Tao Ling Wan and gave her one of the glasses.

“We have the rest of our lives ahead of us, so if we have the chance, we should get to know each other better.”

Tao Ling Wan was wondering why Yang Kai had suddenly gotten her a glass of wine; however, upon hearing what he said, she realized what was going on and immediately nodded joyfully.

The two of them intertwined their arms and drank the entire glass of wine.

Yang Kai took the glasses and placed them down. He then gently lifted the red veil and revealed a shy Tao Ling Wan who had her head slightly bowed and her cheeks flushed red.

Yang Kai curled his fingers and extinguished the candles with a flick, plunging the room into darkness. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Tao Ling Wan began to breathe heavily. Even though she had lived in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven for many years and had hardly socialized, she still understood what was waiting for her at this moment.

“It’s late, we should rest,” Yang Kai said.

“En.” Tao Ling Wan nodded lightly.

…..

“Madame, Young Master has entered the innermost courtyard, and the lights have gone out.” Inside the chamber, Yue He reported the situation to Yu Ru Meng.

Yu Ru Meng nodded, lifted the red veil on her head, and cursed, “That smelly man! Always saying one thing then doing another! Never allowing one to not worry about him!”

Yue He was dumbfounded and replied, “You all planned this together, and now you’re complaining about Young Master? Who just threw Young Master out with a black eye? If you had accepted him here, he wouldn’t have gone anywhere either.”

Yu Ru Meng knew very well that this would be the result when she planned to reject him today; however, she could not admit that openly.

Yu Ru Meng sighed and said, “At least Xiao Wan’s matter is resolved. That’s a relief.”

Looking up at Yue He, she asked somewhat helplessly, “Did we do something wrong?”

Yue He shook her head and said, “Madame understands Young Master’s nature. When he was trapped for 100 years with the Black Ink Royal Lord, you constantly worried about him. Now that he has been released, he still intends to go and seal the Void Corridor. He should depart without any unresolved issues so his heart is not burdened. Madame did the right thing.”

Yu Ru Meng nodded, “En.”

If Yang Kai had gone into the Void Corridor while carrying worry and guilt, he would have no peace, and neither would they. That was why they made those arrangements to facilitate Tao Ling Wan’s recovery. They wanted Yang Kai to be free of any burdens so that he could concentrate on the difficult task he was about to face. What they did was also to help Tao Ling Wan secure her position in the household.

“Do the others know about it?” Yu Ru Meng asked again.

“I believe so,” Yue He replied, “Shu Mu Dan sent a message to the others as soon as the candle was extinguished.”

Yu Ru Meng nodded, then suddenly cursed through gritted teeth, “That smelly man must be enjoying himself now!”

Yue He was struck speechless.

Yang Kai naturally did not dare to be partial to any of the six brides he took in; thus, he made sure that he took turns to accompany a different Madame every day.

For half a month, Yang Kai shuffled among the six courtyards. Outsiders envied him, but only he knew how much work it took to placate and satisfy these new brides of his.

When Myriad Demons Heaven’s Mo Sha heard the report from one of the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Masters under his command, the corner of his brow twitched visibly as he muttered, “That brat has been at it for half a month straight?”

The Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master smiled and nodded, “Yes, he seems to be quite addicted to it.”

Mo Sha fell silent before snorting, “In the world of mortals, shouldn’t a married woman return to her bridal family to pay her respects?”

The Seventh-Order Open Heaven Master was stunned and did not quite understand why the Ancestor mentioned this suddenly; however, he immediately nodded and said, “There is indeed such a custom. Does Divine Monarch intend to…”

Mo Sha waved his hand and said dismissively, “It was just a random comment, think nothing of it.”

…..

In Xia Ning Chang’s courtyard, Yang Kai was relaxing on a chair. Now that everything was settled, the ancient seal of the Void Corridor could still be maintained for some time, so there was no rush for him to act. With beauties by his side, Yang Kai’s life was extremely comfortable and enjoyable. How he wished that these days could last forever.

However, he knew that this was impossible and he should enjoy every moment that he could.

Xia Ning Chang was sitting next to him. She took a grape-like spirit fruit from somewhere, and began to peel the skin and remove the seeds. She then gently fed it to him.

Yang Kai took a bite, and playfully bit Xia Ning Chang’s fingers. Little Senior Sister tried to pull her fingers back, but could not bear to be too forceful. She then glared at him coyly and said, “Don’t let the other see this.”

She blushed slightly.

“So what if they see?” Yang Kai said playfully.

“It’s not fair to them.”

“What’s not fair about it?” Yang Kai smiled playfully.

Xia Ning Chang could not stop him, so she let him do whatever he wanted. He tickled her fingers with his tongue.

Suddenly, the door of the courtyard was pushed open and Yue He walked in. Xia Ning Chang was so shocked that she quickly pulled her hand back.

Yue He obviously saw everything, pursed her lips, and snickered. She stood in front of Yang Kai, half-bowing, and greeted, “Young Master.”

“Yes?” Yang Kai asked as he continued to eat the fruit.

“Madame Meng asked me to inform you that it is time for her to return to her family.”

“Back to where?” Yang Kai was stunned.

Yue He said, “For newlyweds, it is customary for the Husband to take his Wife back to her bridal family to pay his respects.”

Yang Kai blinked. He naturally knew about this custom, but it was really more of a mortal custom; thus, he did not think too much about it and had no intention of doing so.

Furthermore, the Cave Heavens and Paradises were not exactly their bridal families. The Divine Monarchs who took them as Disciples did so mainly because they appreciated Yang Kai’s initiative to seal the Void Corridor and wanted to give him a sense of reassurance that his family would be taken care of after he left.

Yang Kai’s forthcoming trip was a gamble with his own life. If he succeeded, it would be a great victory. For such a sacrifice, even the guardians of the 3,000 Worlds had to show their appreciation.

“According to Madame, whether the Cave Heavens and Paradises were sincere in accepting Disciples or not, now that names have been given, and statuses set, it cannot be annulled. Young Master should take each of the Madams back as this will serve as a means to confirm their status. To the Madams, High Heaven Palace, and Void Land, this will be beneficial for the future. The Madams can regard the Cave Heavens and Paradises as their homes and refuge and can visit as frequently as they wish. If protocol is not followed, their goodwill towards the Madams may fade after you leave.”

Yang Kai rubbed his chin as he pondered for a while before nodding, “That’s right, I’ve neglected this. Let’s make the necessary arrangements.”

Yue He nodded and replied, “Which family is Young Master planning to visit first?”

Yang Kai asked, “What does Ru Meng suggest?”

“Madame Meng said that since Yin-Yang Cave Heaven offered two disciples, and both of them are newcomers, you should go there first. The order of the rest doesn’t matter. You may go to Myriad Demons Heaven next,” Yue He explained.

Yang Kai naturally did not have any objections and immediately agreed, “Then let’s do as she suggested.”

The next day, Yang Kai led Qu Hua Shang and Tao Ling Wan to Yin-Yang Cave Heaven’s temporary residence, as a customary visit to their ‘relatives’.

Yin-Yang Cave Heaven was completely unprepared and obviously did not expect Yang Kai to perform such a visit. Nonetheless, the three were still warmly received.

Chen Xiu was particularly appreciative of the visit. After asking Yu Xiang Die to inquire Tao Ling Wan about something, he looked at Yang Kai with immense gratitude.

Chen Xiu was really happy. After his scheme had failed and dragged his Disciple into a predicament, he had been constantly blaming himself. Now, he was finally free of this burden.

Now the only worry was whether Yang Kai could come back alive after entering the Void Corridor. If he met with any accident inside, then his Disciple would be widowed.

At the end of the drinking session, Chen Xiu no longer had the air of a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. He threw his arm over Yang Kai’s shoulders and expressed his friendship for him. All the other disciples looked on with awe and were dumbfounded by how close they were. If not for Chen Xiu’s Second Disciple, Feng Cheng Si, stopping him, Chen Xiu might very well have become Sworn Brothers with Yang Kai, which would have made the family hierarchy quite awkward.

When Yang Kai was about to leave, Chen Xiu was in tears and revealed his true feelings. He took Yang Kai’s hand and told him that he would take care of Xiao Wan in the future.

Naturally, Yang Kai accepted with enthusiasm.

The next day, Yang Kai led Ji Yao back to the Great Battle Heaven. Naturally, he received warm hospitality.

On the third day, Yang Kai led Xue Yue back to Golden Antelope Paradise. Liu Mu led a group of men to drink Yang Kai under the table, causing the latter to flee at the earliest opportunity.

On the fourth day, he and Xia Ning Chang returned to Divine Medicine Cave Heaven.

On the fifth day, Yang Kai finally returned to Myriad Demons Heaven with Yu Ru Meng.

In fact, even now, Yang Kai was not sure about Yu Ru Meng’s discipleship under Myriad Demons Heaven.

It was true that Yu Ru Meng belonged to the Demon Race and had some faint connections to Myriad Demons Heaven, but it was still a great surprise to Yang Kai that the Divine Monarch would really accept her as a Disciple.

As soon as the boat arrived at Myriad Demons Heaven, they were warmly greeted.

It was two Seventh-Order Open Heaven who received them, no less!

“Greetings, Senior Brothers!” Yang Kai cupped his fist and saluted them respectfully.

He realized that his seniority had been raised after his Wives were accepted as Disciples of the Ancestors of the Cave Heavens and Paradises.

Previously, when he saw these Seventh-Orders Open Heaven Realm Masters, Yang Kai had to address them as Senior, Martial Uncle, or Aunt.

Now when he met them, he could greet them as Senior Brother or Sister. After all, Yu Ru Meng was Mo Sha’s Legacy Disciple. With her seniority, no one could fault Yang Kai for addressing them like this.
