It was impossible to know when this man had arrived, or if he had been here the whole time in secret. This man was wearing an Artifact Armour that exuded a stronger aura and was shouldering a long spear. A jade crown adorned his head, giving him a majestic and awe-inspiring image, like a great general on the battlefield.

The aura radiating from his body also made everyone suffocate.

His mere aura had pushed the group from Five Paths Chamber of Commerce back to the ground and even slightly injured them; however, his attention was not focused on Gao Hong and the others but was instead fixed on the pavilion Yang Kai was inside of.

“An Origin King!” Gao Hong’s beautiful face turned pale as she exclaimed.

The other party made no attempt to conceal his aura, so it was clear he was an Origin King. This discovery made Gao Hong’s heart sink as she realized that the Chamber of Commerce was really doomed.

“Ah!” A scream rang out and Bai Zheng Chu was flung out into the yard like a sack, his face bruised and swollen, in a much more miserable state than either Xia Jing Wu and Yao Qing. Bai Zheng Chu now had a swollen pig head, giving him an extremely comical appearance.

“You trash, how dare you disturb this King meditation, you deserve to be damned!” Yang Kai’s dissatisfied, extremely arrogant voice came from the room.

Although Bai Zheng Chu was beaten miserably, there was no danger to his life at the moment, but after hearing Yang Kai’s words, he shuddered and hurriedly got up from the ground. Just as he was about to escape though, he heard a cold snort coming from the sky. Bai Zheng Chu stiffened and looked up just in time to see the General-like cultivator staring at him with displeasure.

Bai Zheng Chu’s expression changed drastically, but he was overjoyed inside as he flew towards this man and shouted, “Lord Commander! Greetings, Lord Commander, this humble officer asks the Commander to take responsibility here. This bastard dared to injure the city’s gate guards, and when this humble officer came here to enforce the law, not only did he refuse to cooperate, he even attacked us. This humble officer has experienced this evil-doer’s skills and knows he is not his opponent, so he can only ask Lord Commander to uphold justice for Purple Star City!”

“En,” The Lord Commander snorted coldly and waved his hand, “Draw back, this man is an Origin King Realm, of course you are not his opponent.”

“Origin... Origin King!” Bai Zheng Chu nearly bit his tongue in shock. Although he had already guessed this, when he heard his Commander confirm his speculations, he could not help trembling slightly.

He had actually fought an Origin King just now. Moreover, he managed to withdraw with his life...

Considering this, Bai Zheng Chu could not help feeling a bit proud. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The people of Five Paths Chamber of Commerce were also stunned. Hua You Meng, who was still being held in Gao Hong’s arms, widened her beautiful eyes, as if she could not believe her ears... [Heavens, that young man really turned out to be an Origin King? He does not seem to be very old, does he? How could he already be an Origin King?]

When she thought back to how she had tried to ‘save’ him at the city gate, Hua You Meng could feel her cheeks becoming hot.

[He was an Origin King, yet I actually had eyes but failed to see and tried to stand up to speak for him...]

If she had not interfered at the time, with his cultivation, the gate guards and even Deacon Min would not have dared to provoke him; after all, Origin Kings were revered masters no matter where they went, and Purple Star wouldn’t offend one for no reason.

But instead, things had become more troublesome because she had intervened.

Thinking so, Hua You Meng was very embarrassed.

On the other hand, Gao Hong was staring excitedly and expectantly towards the guest house. She knew that whether the chamber of commerce would be able to escape this disaster all depended on whether this mysterious young man was powerful enough.

Her original plan was to lead Bai Zheng Chu and the others to Yang Kai and use him to deal with them.

Yang Kai being able to defeat Deacon Min with a single move obviously indicated that his strength was not low. Bai Zheng Chu was also a Third-Order Origin Realm cultivator like Deacon Min, so since Yang Kai could take care of Deacon Min, he should not have any problems dealing with Bai Zheng Chu.

If the two parties fought, no matter who won or lost, it would be their chance to escape with their lives.

That was why she had spoken the way she did to Yang Kai before, and why she had secretly given Xia Jing Wu a signal on the way over, one the old man naturally understood.

Unfortunately for her, although her plan was good, the appearance of another master had cut off all hope of escape.

As for this newcomer... Gao Hong quietly looked over at the cultivator dressed as a General and combined with the way Bai Zheng Chu had just addressed him, she was easily able to identify the other party.

Purple Star City Guard Commander, Lu Tian Feng!

“Finally, someone slightly decent has come,” Inside the room, Yang Kai’s arrogant tone remained undiminished, not putting Lu Tian Feng in his eyes at all.

Hearing this, Lu Tian Feng’s face flashed an unpleasant look as he coldly snorted and said, “Slightly decent? Your Excellency’s tone is not small.”

“Whether it’s small or not, you’ll know if you try it,” Yang Kai snickered back.

“Friend, why do you insist on acting like this in my Purple Star City?” Lu Tian Feng frowned, unexpectedly not getting angry but instead asking cautiously.

The other party was able to cultivate to the Origin King Realm, so obviously he was not a fool. Since this unknown young man knew this was Purple Star City yet he still dared to act presumptuous, not even putting the city Guard Commander in his eyes, he undoubtedly had enough strength to back up his arrogance, or a powerful background that allowed him to act this way.

As the Guard Commander, how could Lu Tian Feng not think of this?

Which was why he had no choice but to act with discretion.

“If you want to know who I am, come down here and speak to me face to face rather than standing up there.”

Lu Tian Feng’s expression became cold, “Is Your Excellency trying to provoke this Lu?”

“What’s wrong? Does Commander Lu not have the courage?”

“Nonsense!” Lu Tian Feng snorted, “You think such paltry threats can intimidate this General? Fine... Since you are so confident, then this General must see if you are qualified to act so. However, if you are just some blind fool, heh heh... Then don’t blame this Lu for being impolite.”

Saying so, with his spear in hand, and as a strong wind whipped around him, he stepped down from where he stood.

Everyone held their breath as the atmosphere grew tense, all of them watching as if a great storm was about to hit; after all, this was a conflict between two Origin Kings; who among them had ever witnessed such a scene before?

Not long after, Lu Tian Feng arrived in front of the pavilion and displaying the boldness of a powerful master he pushed open the door directly and went inside.

With a squeak... the door closed after Lu Tian Feng.

Everything went so quiet one could hear a needle drop...

No fight broke out, and not even an argument occurred.

The atmosphere was quite strange, but heavy enough that everyone could hear their own heartbeat. Bai Zheng Chu even perked up his ears to listen, trying to hear what was happening.

The Five Paths Chamber of Commerce members all exchanged bewildered glances, none of them able to understand what their current situation was.

After a cup of tea worth of time, the door opened again.

Lu Tian Feng stepped out serious, then in front of everyone’s eyes, turned around, carefully closed the door and then bowed deeply, “Since that is the case, I hope Sir will rest early today. Tomorrow, this one will come to pay his respects to Sir again.”

“No need, this King prefers peace and quiet,” Yang Kai’s voice came from inside the house.

“Yes!” Lu Tian Feng replied respectfully.

“Good, you withdraw then. But first, the backyard of this Five Paths Chamber of Commerce was destroyed by your subordinates...”

“Sir may rest assured; this one will definitely give Sir a satisfactory explanation.” Lu Tian Feng quickly said.

“Some people were also injured...”

“This one will handle matters appropriately!”

“En!”

Once no more sounds came from the room, Lu Tian Feng turned around with a solemn expression.

By now, everyone’s jaws had dropped as looks of pure disbelief filled their faces.

What exactly just happened?

The famous Purple Star City Guard Commander Lu Tian Feng, a powerful figure with near-unlimited authority in Purple Star City, was acting so respectful and obedient towards the young man inside the pavilion. Just what was the background of this person?

Everyone from Five Paths Chamber of Commerce could hardly process the scene before them and the burly bald-headed man Yao Qing even rubbed his eyes desperately, wondering if he was hallucinating because of his injuries.

“Lord... Lord Commander...” Bai Zheng Chu went forward to grovel, but Lu Tian Feng simply shot him a cold glare caused Bai Zheng Chu’s head to shrink back as he felt his situation becoming worrisome.

“I’ll deal with you later!” Lu Tian Feng ground his teeth and snorted coldly.

Bai Zheng Chu felt his head go blank as he stood there in shock.

“May I ask, who is in charge of this place?” Lu Tian Feng turned around once more and put on a friendly smile as he addressed Gao Hong and the others, a hint of flattery even apparent in his tone.

The members of Five Paths Chamber of Commerce felt like there was something wrong with their heads as they could not keep up with the changing situation, all of them just standing dumbfounded in place, unable to react.

It wasn’t until Lu Tian Feng called out to them that Gao Hong’s tender body trembled, and she put down Hua You Meng, who she had been holding in her arms the whole time, before offering her shoulder as support and introducing, “This is the President of our Chamber of Commerce. Does Commander Lu have some instruction for us?”

“I wouldn’t dare!” Lu Tian Feng’s hands fidgeted as he quickly put away his long spear artifact. Smiling at Hua You Meng, he asked in a respectful tone, “Dare I ask this lady’s name?”

Hua You Meng replied softly, “This Mistress is Hua You Meng, Lord Commander can simply address me by name. Please forgive this Mistress for being unable to offer a proper greeting at this time.”

“So it is President Hua, I’ve heard so much about you!” Lu Tian Feng put on a surprised expression, as if Hua You Meng’s name was as resounding as thunder, causing one’s ears to ring just from its mention. But Lu Tian Feng did not give her a chance to refute as he smiled widely and continued, “President Hua’s... um...”

“Five Paths Chamber of Commerce...” Bai Zheng Chu quickly informed him.

“En, this Lu has long heard of President Hua’s Five Paths Chamber of Commerce. Its reputation as an honest and upright establishment is well known, a model for all other chambers of commerce. En, seeing it today, it truly deserves its reputation, hahaha!”

Hua You Meng’s cheeks blushed bright red from this clearly nonsensical flattery.

Gao Hong and the others’ expressions were also extremely unnatural.

They were well aware of the chamber of commerce’s situation: Five Paths Chamber of Commerce was a small business that did not have many members. Even if there were not ten thousand such chambers of commerce in Purple Star City, there were at least eight thousand. What kind of status did Lu Tian Feng have? He was the City Guard Commander, one of the highest-ranking members of Purple Star. How could he possibly understand the situation of their tiny chamber of commerce? Suddenly being called a role model for all other chambers of commerce was a hat far too heavy for any of their heads to hold up.

However, everyone knew that this change in Lu Tian Feng’s attitude was completely due to that mysterious young man!
