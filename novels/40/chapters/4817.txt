Yin Zhi Yong was drenched in cold sweat. He knew that Yang Kai had saved him once again.

In just a few breaths’ time, Yang Kai had saved his life twice. Feeling embarrassed, he quickly raised his sword and fought against the enemies alongside Yang Kai.

Since he had been a private guard in the Meng Manor for more than ten years, he was naturally strong. The experiences just now made him feel furious, so he was especially ruthless when dealing with the enemies.

The attackers were mostly weak, but there were a lot of them, and they had hidden themselves in darkness earlier. Now that they had been exposed, there was no way they could defeat the two of them.

A moment later, all the attackers were either killed or running for their lives. Soon, the courtyard fell into silence.

Despite that, they could hear the sounds of intense battles coming from other parts of the manor.

Just then, a high-pitched whistle was heard. The Captain of the private guards was trying to gather his subordinates together.

Yin Zhi Yong shouted at Yang Kai, “Come with me!” With blood still dripping from his sword, he leaped over the wall and led Yang Kai to another courtyard.

More than thirty private guards had gathered together in this place. All of them were covered in blood while some people were badly injured.

Since they were in a perilous situation, the Captain didn’t have time to explain anything in detail as he said, “Those from Hidden Treasure Peak are here, and there are a lot of them. However, all of you don’t have to worry. I’m sure those from the City Lord’s Mansion have gotten wind of this and will send some people to help soon. We just have to persevere for a while, and we’ll all be safe. Now, we’re on the same boat. If we can’t fend off the enemies, all of us will be killed.”

He then started giving orders.

Yang Kai and Yin Zhi Yong were still partners. They were told to guard a route that the attackers must pass through if they wanted to leave the Meng Manor. The bandits from Hidden Treasure Peak had snuck into the Meng Manor. Regardless of what their goal was, they definitely had to leave after achieving their objective. It was a chance to weaken the power of those from Hidden Treasure Peak, so the Meng Manor would never want to miss it. Other than fending off the enemies, they also wanted to work with the City Lord’s Mansion to destroy the bandits.

The others were also given some tasks.

Upon receiving the order, Yang Kai and Yin Zhi Yong left the courtyard.

On the roof of a tall building, they crouched down and waited patiently. They were like the shadows in the darkness. No one could detect their presence without taking a closer look.

Some of the bandits passed by this place from time to time, but before they even realized it, they had already lost their lives.

Yin Zhi Yong increasingly admired the strength that Yang Kai had showcased.

The chaos in the Meng Manor continued. Yang Kai stared intently at the inner court. Noises of intense battles could be heard coming from over there, but they were all in the periphery.

The core area of the inner court was serene, and all the lights were off.

A moment later, a large group of bandits tried to escape out of the Meng Manor. The private guards, who had been waiting at the important routes, appeared and hacked them to death.

The place Yang Kai and Yin Zhi Yong were in was especially bustling with noises. While Yang Kai was still fine, Yin Zhi Yong felt immensely pressured. His thigh was injured as it was now covered in blood.

However, with Yang Kai around, he seemed able to easily ward off the attackers. As long as it wasn’t dozens of bandits coming at him all at once, he could effortlessly kill three to five people at the same time.

Presently, more than twenty corpses had been piled up on the roof.

Meanwhile, the anxiety in Yang Kai’s heart intensified as he felt that something was off.

After killing another bandit, he suddenly realised what was amiss.

When they had gathered together just now, he didn’t see Luo An Guo’s burly figure. Luo An Guo was also a new private guard. Unless he was already killed, he was supposed to have joined them earlier. Nevertheless, he was nowhere to be seen.

Yang Kai instantly looked at a particular spot in the inner court where Luo An Guo had been hiding for several nights in the past.

As the fire flickered in the distance, he saw a burly figure leaping over the wall from the inner court and heading to a place where security was weak.

There seemed to be some helpers over there as they quickly left the place with the burly figure.

Yang Kai immediately jumped off the roof. An astounded Yin Zhi Yong called out in alarm, “Where are you going, Little Brother?”

He didn’t get any response from the young man. On the other hand, some bandits came at him from the side as they intended to flee.

Yin Zhi Yong couldn’t help but shudder. His thigh was injured. Without Yang Kai working with him, he would be killed by those bandits.

However, he would be considered to be absent from his duties if he left just like that. After the dust settled, he would be punished by those from the Meng Manor.

Between death and punishment though, Yin Zhi Yong steadfastly chose the latter. He quickly leaped off the roof and followed Yang Kai.

At the front, Yang Kai ran after the burly figure on the roof and soon left the Meng Manor.

A large group of people could be heard coming from behind. Supposedly, the support from the City Lord’s Mansion had arrived.

On the other hand, Yang Kai stared fixedly at the burly figure ahead. It wasn’t until this moment that he realised there was something on the sturdy figure’s shoulder. Despite that, it didn’t affect his agility as the towering figure remained as dextrous as a rabbit.

Around him, his companions were seen charging forward.

Sensing that there was someone running after him, Luo An Guo turned his head to take a look without stopping in his tracks. Meanwhile, two of his companions turned around and dashed towards Yang Kai.

Their gap soon shortened. Barely thirty metres away, those two people lifted their weapons and came at Yang Kai from both sides.

Yang Kai directly brushed past the two of them as a glint flashed from his sword.

When Yin Zhi Yong arrived at this place, he saw two corpses lying on the roof. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Although the gates of White Jade City were closed, it couldn’t stop a powerful cultivator like Luo An Guo from fleeing as he was well prepared. With the help of a claw hook, he climbed up the wall and soon jumped off to the other side under the night sky.

When Yang Kai arrived, two of Luo An Guo’s companions were still climbing up the wall.

He leaped into the air like a bird and hovered above the two of them for a moment before landing a kick on the one nearest to him. The person crashed into his companion as they fell to the ground together.

Upon landing on the top of the wall, Yang Kai sported a dark expression, for he could hear the sound of a horse neighing. Looking down, he saw that Luo An Guo was mounting up.

Luo An Guo looked up at Yang Kai and grinned. Then, he made the horse turn around and gallop off.

Yang Kai took a deep breath and leaped off the wall before rushing forward. However, even though he was fairly powerful in this Samsara World, with such low cultivation, he could never be as quick as a horse.

Despite seeing that Luo An Guo was getting further away from him, Yang Kai didn’t give up. Instead, he raced after him following the horse’s hoofprints.

About a cup of tea’s time later, Luo An Guo was nowhere to be seen while Yang Kai was feeling extremely anxious.

Just then, a horse could be heard galloping towards him from behind.

He turned his head and saw Yin Zhi Yong rushing towards him on horseback. The horse stopped in front of Yang Kai as Yin Zhi Yong panted and said, “The Eldest Young Lady was captured!”

When he saw Yang Kai leaving the Meng Manor to chase after someone just now, he still had no idea what was going on. But soon, the Meng Manor descended into chaos because while they were locked in an intense battle with the bandits, someone snuck into the inner court and abducted the Eldest Young Lady.

Yin Zhi Yong immediately thought of the person that Yang Kai was running after. With no time to report the matter to the higher-ups, he took a horse from the stable and dashed off in the direction of Hidden Treasure Peak. He faced an obstacle when trying to pass through the city gates, for they were already closed. The people guarding the gates were from the City Lord’s Mansion, and a mere private guard from the Meng Manor had no authority to make them open the gates.

Fortunately, Yin Zhi Yong was friends with the leader of the guards on duty, and he told him what was going on. He also promised a reward from the Meng Family before he was allowed to pass through the gates.

He believed that if his speculation was right, Yang Kai was just in front of him.

Just as he had expected, he soon found Yang Kai.

Following that, he leaped off the horse and said grimly, “Only you can save the Eldest Young Lady, Little Brother. If you’re able to do it, we won’t have to worry about money ever again.”

He had seen Yang Kai’s true strength just now, so he had confidence in him. Moreover, there was only one horse, and he was injured; therefore, he wasn’t willing to follow him to slow him down.

“Don’t worry,” Yang Kai nodded and jumped onto the horse. After clenching his thighs, he galloped off in a hurry.

Yang Kai wasn’t sure where Hidden Treasure Peak was exactly, but fortunately, Luo An Guo had left behind some traces while escaping.

Furthermore, Luo An Guo was a burly man, and he had to carry the Eldest Young Lady with him; therefore, it was expected that Yang Kai could outpace him on his horse.

At the break of dawn, Yang Kai had a feeling that he was getting closer to his target.

After galloping a few more kilometres, he indeed saw Luo An Guo.

The noise from behind alerted Luo An Guo, and when he turned his head and saw someone chasing after him, he was astounded.

The distance between them was getting shorter. Luo An Guo turned his head several times and finally made out Yang Kai’s face. Instantly, he burned with murderous intent.

He could never forget about the humiliation inflicted upon him by Yang Kai, who defeated him with his sword on the selection stage. Nevertheless, he didn’t show it on his face over the past few days; after all, he was on a mission in the Meng Manor, so he didn’t have time to settle the score with Yang Kai.

However, when he saw Yang Kai relentlessly pursuing him at this moment, he was infuriated.

Since Yang Kai’s horse could apparently run faster, there was no way he could flee. After giving it a thought, Luo An Guo slowed his horse down and turned around, choosing to wait on the same spot in silence.

A moment later, Yang Kai stopped at a spot a few dozen metres away from him.

As their eyes met, Luo An Guo put on a grin while Yang Kai remained calm and collected.

“Brat, you’re pretty bold. How did you have the gall to chase after me on your own?” Luo An Guo cracked his neck.

Yang Kai took a glance at the horse and saw a black cloth bag. There seemed to be a person who was squirming in the cloth bag. Perhaps her mouth had been sealed, so she could only grunt.

“Do you want to save the damsel in distress?” Luo An Guo sneered.

“Release her!” Yang Kai placed his left hand on the hilt of his sword with a cold expression.

Luo An Guo scoffed, “You just joined the Meng Manor recently, why are you pretending to be loyal? Brat, you’re pretty strong. Why don’t you follow me to the mountain? You can get all the money and women that you want. It’s better than working as a private guard in the Meng Family.”

“Release her!” Yang Kai repeated his words dispassionately.

The smile on Luo An Guo’s face disappeared, “I wanted to offer you an opportunity since you’re quite talented. However, since you refuse a toast, you must drink a forfeit. Don’t blame me for being rough with you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he leaped into the air. The horse was unable to bear the impact as all its legs broke while it neighed in pain.

While in mid-air, Luo An Guo bellowed, “Do you seriously think you’re more powerful than me just because you beat me back then? I’ll show you my true power!”

In the next instant, his fists turned into countless shadows that rained down on Yang Kai.
