The terrifying and brutal clan had made all the major Ancient Barbarian Race clans isolate them. Some even felt that the Bone Devouring Clan was not a Barbarian Clan at all, but rather a group of uncivilized scourges, one that was best eliminated.

Unfortunately, there was a powerful Shaman Saint residing in the Bone Devouring Clan, so unless the entire Barbarian Race joined forces, no one would be willing to start a war with them. The Bone Devouring Clan was also known for seeking revenge for the slightest grievance, so it was best not to provoke them.

The consequences were unimaginable for the Blue South Village to be attacked by such an enemy.

“Many have died, Brother Ah Niu. save the Village Chief and the rest quickly!” The eldest boy cried and looked at Yang Kai expectantly as if he was an omnipotent being.

“When did they attack?” Yang Kai asked in a deep voice.

“Three days ago.”

It had already been three days, so Yang Kai couldn’t help worrying if it was already too late. He turned to Tiea and instructed her, “Take care of them.”

Tiea grabbed his arm and whispered, “What are you doing? Don’t go courting death!”

Yang Kai grinned, “We don’t know who’s going to die yet.”

Tiea shook her head, “It’s been three days since the incident. You may not be able to catch up to them now. The fate of anyone captured by the Bone Devouring Clan will be ending up as food. Maybe the people in your village are already…”

“Then, they will have to pay the price for that,” Yang Kai flung her hand away and flew into the air.

Tiea stared at his back and sighed, shaking her head slowly.

Jaws dropped, as the few barbarian boys gaped at the sky in amazement. The eldest gawking in admiration as he dumbly shouted, “Ah! Brother Ah Niu can fly…”

…

There were nearly three hundred villagers in the Blue South Village and every man, woman, young, and old, were warriors. In order to capture such a huge number, the Bone Devouring Clan would need to send out a lot of people and would leave obvious traces in their retreat.

As such, it was not difficult for Yang Kai to trace and follow the trail.

The snow was melting, and all beings were beginning to stir from the cold. Perhaps the Bone Devouring Clan’s winter food storage had been running low, which drove them to scavenge for food. They must have accidentally discovered the remote Blue South Village and taken advantage of them.

As far as Yang Kai knew, although the people of the Bone Devouring Clan had no taboos and were willing to eat their own clansmen, they were still human in the end. They would prefer to eat fresh food. In other words, they would not kill all the prisoners at once, but would only kill their ‘livestock’ when necessary.

This gave Yang Kai some time to save his people.

As long as they were stopped or Yang Kai was able to find their lair before the situation became irreversible, he was confident he could rescue them.

Yang Kai arrived outside a stone fortress just as night fell.

The stone fortress was built on a mountain, on the side of a cliff, bordered by precipitous rocks as smooth as a mirror that covered a wide area. Inside the stone fortress were burly, hideous Ancient Barbarians walking back and forth, shouldering varieties of weapons, each of them flashing long fangs and menacing faces.

There seemed to be objects hanging on the stone walls, and as Yang Kai squinted at them with all his might, he was stunned by what he found.

The hanging objects were actually corpses, and based on his rough count, there were at least a hundred of them. There were only three hundred people in the entire Blue South Village, but a hundred corpses were already hanging here. Yang Kai’s heart turned cold, and a chill radiated from his body that could freeze the air.

He was still a step too late!

Taking a deep breath to calm his anger, Yang Kai stood up from his hiding place, preparing to take advantage of the darkness to infiltrate into the stone fortress. He was now a Shaman Master, and an ordinary Shaman Grandmaster would not be his opponent. It was highly unlikely that there was a Shaman King in charge of this stone fortress, but it was always better to be careful.

At that moment, Yang Kai suddenly crouched down again and concealed his aura as he noticed something as he looked in another direction.

There was a rustle of movement over there, and even though it was faint, Yang Kai heard it clearly.

He quietly swept his Divine Sense over that area, and a look of surprise appeared on his face.

After pondering for a moment, Yang Kai snuck over to that spot and reached out his hand.

Right after, a voice exclaimed in the dark, “Who!?”

Yang Kai immediately covered that person’s mouth with his hand and shushed, and comforted the Barbarian Warrior who was subdued by him, “Don’t be nervous, I’m not an enemy!”

The Barbarian Warrior was horrified as although the opponent had only used one hand, no matter how hard he tried, he could not escape from Yang Kai’s restraint. After several struggles, this warrior felt chills running all over his body and despair shrouded him.

The moonlight shone on them, and the Barbarian Warrior suddenly fell silent, staring at Yang Kai with astonished wide eyes, his voice muffled against Yang Kai’s hand, “Shaman Niu?”

“En?” Yang Kai was startled, “Do you know me?”

As he spoke, he let go of his hand, and after seeing the tattoo on the Barbarian Warrior face, Yang Kai suddenly blurted, “You’re from the Raging Flame Clan?”

The Barbarian Warrior was pleasantly surprised and nodded, “Yes, Shaman Niu, we met in the canyon previously.”

Yang Kai immediately understood at the mention of the canyon and his eyes lit up, “Is Ya here?”

“Shaman Ya is nearby, I’ll take you to him.”

“Good,” Yang Kai nodded.

He had noticed the presence of quite a few others here just now and knew that they were not enemies, but he did not expect an old acquaintance to be among them. Fortunately, the Raging Flame Clan Barbarian recognized him, otherwise, it would be troublesome to explain.

Yang Kai moved silently as he followed the Barbarian Warrior from the Raging Flame Clan, attracting suspicious glances along the way, all of them unable to fathom as to why another person had suddenly appeared here.

After a short while, the Barbarian Warrior came to the forefront and whispered, “Shaman Ya, Shaman Niu is here.”

A voice came from the front, “Shaman Niu? Which Shaman Niu?”

A familiar face appeared in front of him, and Yang Kai squeezed out a smile, “Shaman Ya, we meet again.”

Ya was shocked and gaped at him, “Shaman Niu, why are you here?”

This man called Ah Niu, gave Ya a very strong impression after the challenge in the canyon. Only one winter had passed after they met, so it was natural that he did not forget him.

Yang Kai quickly replied, “The reason should be the same as yours for being here!”

Ya froze, and he was dazed for a moment before nodding, “It looks like your village has also been attacked.”

“Why was yours attacked?”

Ya explained with a grim face, “I took some clansmen with me to gather food, and when we came back, the villagers were all taken away. We came here after following the trail.”

“Then, our goals are the same!” Yang Kai grinned, exposing a mouthful of pearly white teeth that ghastly gleamed under the shadow of the moonlight. Ya’s heart jumped in fright seeing this vicious look and quickly continued, “Are you alone?”

“I am the only one left in the village who can fight.”

Ya showed an expression of admiration. If he was in the same situation, and he was the only survivor of his village, Ya was not certain he would have the courage to even track the enemy to their base. The opponent was none other than the brutal and bloody Bone Devouring Clan, so returning alive from such an endeavour was questionable at best.

“Come with me to meet a few of our Seniors!” Ya beckoned to Yang Kai and then led the way.

Yang Kai followed with suspicion, wondering who he was going to meet.

After a short while, a low voice suddenly came from the front, “Ya, what are you doing here?”

Ya replied respectfully, “Shaman Chi, a friend from the South Barbarian Clan has come. It seems his fellow villagers have also been taken captive by them.”

“Oh?” The person called Chi responded in surprise, “Come here.”

Ya signalled to Yang Kai to come forward.

In the dense grass, a man and a woman sat cross-legged, their aura vigorous but well-controlled, blending seamlessly with the surrounding nature.

They were two Shaman Grandmasters! Yang Kai raised his eyebrows in astonishment.

That man should be Chi; he had a tattoo of the Raging Flame Clan on his face, and his aura appeared to be a little hot. He obviously cultivated Shaman Arts and Shamanic Spells related to the Fire Attribute. As for the woman, although she had a big waist and a burly body, she had a sense of elegance and flexibility, which was extremely contradictory to her appearance.

When Yang Kai approached, these two cast sharp gazes immediately at him, watching him with an uncomfortable, scrutinizing gaze.

“Shaman Niu from the Blue South Village, greets two Seniors!” Yang Kai stretched out his hand over his chest.

Chi nodded lightly, and complemented Yang Kai, “A Shaman Master, not bad at all.”

“What? Shaman Master?” Ya was flabbergasted, “Wasn’t Shaman Niu just a Low-Rank Shaman Apprentice? Shaman Chi, are you mistaken?”

Little did he know that at the end of winter, this Shaman Niu had already become a Shaman Master. If only he had known, Ya would probably have complained that the Barbarian God was being unfair.

“How could there be such a skinny clansman? Do you belong to the Nomad Clan?” The woman frowned and did not bother concealing her disgust for Yang Kai.

Before Yang Kai could open his mouth to reply, Ya spoke up, “Shaman Niu is not from the Nomad Clan. He is from the South Barbarian Clan. He is also a generous and righteous man, how could the Nomad Clan be compared to him?”

He recalled the one hundred wild beasts Yang Kai had given him last time as an act of kindness.

“That would be best!” The woman nodded lightly, seemingly having complete trust in Ya’s statement.

“How should I address this Lady?” Yang Kai asked, looking at the woman.

Chi answered, “She is Shaman Zhu of the Fierce Wind Clan.”

Ya spoke in a low voice, “The Bone Devouring Clan raided a total of three villages this time. One of them is your village, another is mine, and the other is of the Fierce Wind Clan. I approached Shaman Chi, and just ran into Shaman Zhu, so everyone is gathered here.”

“There is strength in numbers,” Yang Kai nodded, and said, “If I may ask, what is the plan for the next action?”

Chi simply replied, “We will wait for dawn.”

Yang Kai contemplated and nodded, “Dawn is the time when people are the most relaxed. It is indeed the best time to act, but both of you are Shaman Grandmasters. Are you not confident to take that stone fortress head-on?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Zhu glanced at him and asked, “How much do you know about this stone fortress?”

Yang Kai answered honestly, “I don’t know anything about it.”

Before this, he was not even aware of the existence of a Bone Devouring Clan fortress here.

Zhu explained, “This stone fortress is only a small sub-clan of the Bone Devouring Clan. There are about seven hundred to eight hundred warriors inside, with more than twenty Shamans. The strongest one is called Yeow, and he’s a Mid-Rank Shaman Grandmaster.”

Yang Kai noticed a trace of fear appeared on Chi’s face when Zhu mentioned Yeow, obviously conscious that he was not strong enough to fight against this Bone Devouring Clan’s Shaman Grandmaster.
