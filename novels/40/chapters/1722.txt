“En,” Yang Kai nodded before his expression turned a little sullen, “Suddenly being treated as a bargaining chip makes this Sect Master very unhappy. Old Sha, does it matter if I kill this Jiang Huai An?”

Sha Hu heard this and sighed, “Keep him alive, this old master will deal with it himself!”

“As you wish!”

“You want to kill me? Let’s see if you have the ability!” Jiang Huai An glared angrily at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s calmness made him extremely annoyed and also gave him an unsettling feeling. He didn’t know whether Yang Kai really had something to rely on that allowed him to not fear the Blue Roaring Tidal Array; after all, there were too many rumours about Yang Kai and how he was a master that greatly surpassed the pinnacle of the Origin Returning Realm.

[However, no matter how tyrannical his personal strength is, this man could not be stronger than our grand Spirit Array, right?] Thinking so, Jiang Huai An’s anxiety calmed greatly and he stared at Yang Kai coldly, his expression filled with disdain.

As time passed, the power of the Blue Roaring Tidal Array became stronger and stronger, feeding on the abundant Water Attribute Energy in the surroundings, condensing more and more beasts and weapons within its range.

The pressure coming from this array made even Sha Hu pale slightly.

Yang Kai still did not show any intention of moving though, simply standing in place and seemingly appreciating the power of this Blue Roaring Tidal Array.

After a half cup of tea’s time, the power of the Blue Roaring Tidal Array has been raised to its peak.

The sounds of crashing waves grew ever louder, making everyone present feel somewhat uneasy as they looked up into the sky which was filled with countless beasts and weapons that seemed to be just waiting to pounce and rip Yang Kai into ten thousand pieces.

Jiang Huai An’s face now showed a completely relaxed expression as he knew that now, even if Yang Kai had astonishing ability, he couldn’t escape from the Blue Roaring Tidal Array.

This massive Sect Defending Array had been arranged and enhanced by countless masters over Sea Temple’s history and had never failed to shelter the Sect from danger in the past.

“Sect Master Yang, considering you are a guest of Martial Uncle Sha, surrender without a fight and this Temple Master can consider showing mercy, what do you say?” Jiang Huai An looked at Yang Kai lightly and snorted.

“I refuse!” Yang Kai shook his head, looking at Jiang Huai An with a smile, “I came here with sincerity, but never expected to be treated like this. Honestly, your Sea Temple annoys this Sect Master and if it were not for Old Sha here, this Sect Master would wipe away your Sea Temple from Shadowed Star, but since Sea Temple is Old Sha’s Sect, I will spare you from that fate.”

“You think you alone can remove my Sea Temple from Shadowed Star? Who gave you the gall?” Jiang Huai An roared, “You think you have such ability?”

Yang Kai grinned meaningfully and simply stared towards Jiang Huai An lightly before casually speaking a single word.

“Break!”

As soon as this word was spoken, the Blue Roaring Tidal Array which had already reached the apex of its strength, with countless strange beasts and floating weapons surrounding Yang Kai, suddenly released a popping noise and burst apart.

Even the bright light curtain covering Black Reef Island suddenly cracked and shattered.

The Sect Defending Array of Sea Temple was instantly broken!

It was as if Yang Kai’s words carried some supreme power that commanded even the world itself to obey him.

Sha Hu was dumbfounded, completely shocked to his core as he stared towards Yang Kai in utter disbelief, as if he did not know the man in front of him now. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Jiang Huai An also stood dumbfounded on the spot, staring at Yang Kai, then sweeping his eyes around his surroundings, unable to believe that the Blue Roaring Tidal Array had really been broken by a single word.

Third Temple Master Qi Yun Hai was even more stunned, his body trembling slightly.

The remaining Sea Temple masters also cried out in disbelief.

“What happened?” After a while, Jiang Huai An finally reacted and yelled at Qi Yun Hai, “What happened to the disciples managing the array? Why did they stop it?”

He obviously thought that the failure of the Blue Roaring Tidal Array was because the disciples had stopped operating it, not because of something Yang Kai had done.

Qi Yun Hai quickly took out a communication artifact, poured his Divine Sense into it, and contacted the disciples in charge of managing the Blue Roaring Tidal Array. A moment later, he hurriedly said, “First Temple Master, the disciples have not stopped the Spirit Array, but for some reason, it has simply ceased functioning.”

“How can this be?” Jiang Huai An’s eyes trembled as he stared at Yang Kai in horror.

Yang Kai grinned, “Don’t waste your time, the World Energy within a hundred thousand kilometres of this place is now under my control. Without my consent, your prided Spirit Array is nothing but a fancy decoration.”

“Nonsense!” Jiang Huai An screamed, “Even if you are an Origin King, it would be impossible to control the World Energy across such a wide area. Do you think this Temple Master is a fool?”

Yang Kai simply chuckled before lifting his hand up slowly.

Although his movements were not fast, quite slow in fact, as Yang Kai lifted his hand, the sea around Black Reef Island began to boil fiercely with massive bubbles continuously rising to its surface.

Massive vortices began forming around Black Reef Island one after another.

*Hong Hong Hong...*

Thick water columns then burst forth from these vortices, each one several dozen metres thick, soaring straight up into the sky, even bursting through the clouds above.

The entire world seemed to tremble, causing everyone’s footing to become unstable.

The sea level around Black Reef Island seemed to drop slightly as this happened.

The water columns which rushed up into the sky abruptly transformed into a series of azure water dragons, each one with vivid and realistic features, even their bodies forming thick blue dragon scales.

In the blink of an eye, around Black Reef Island, hundreds of water dragons formed purely from the convergence of seawater had appeared. In the next instant, all these water dragons rushed towards Black Reef Island, only pausing when they came to within a few dozen metres of its shores, their eyes all gazing down at the people before them imposingly.

Black Reef Island was instantly surrounded by hundreds of water dragons, each thousands of metres long, dozens of metres thick, and radiating an astonishing destructive pressure.

It was not difficult to imagine that Black Reef Island would quickly be destroyed if these hundreds of water dragons rushed forward.

Yang Kai, who was the culprit behind all of this, had only just lifted his arm slightly, not showing any signs of using his Saint Qi or any other kind of strength at all.

On Black Reef Island, panicked cries rang out constantly. Suddenly being surrounded by so many water dragons, the disciples of Sea Temple were naturally terrified. They did not know what was happening, but under the terrifying pressure, many fell to the ground or scrambled to escape chaotically.

Jiang Huai An could no longer restrain the panic in his heart as he trembled violently, looking at Yang Kai as if he was some kind of monster, unable to understand how he had managed to accomplish this.

No one dared doubt whether Yang Kai had the ability to remove Sea Temple from Shadowed Star anymore, as proof was now on display before them.

“Impossible! This Temple Master will never believe this, it must be some kind of illusion!” Jiang Huai An still seemed unwilling to give up and quickly came up with a rationalization for this situation, turning to Yang Kai and shouting, “It turns out that Sect Master Yang has cultivated a profound Illusion Technique, this Temple Master was almost fooled by you.”

“Stubborn fool!” Yang Kai coldly snorted before with a single thought he sent one of the water dragons towards Jiang Huai An.

Midair, the huge water dragon distorted and transformed into a water spear only ten metres long as it stabbed towards Jiang Huai An.

Jiang Huai An roared as he pushed his Saint Qi madly, stretching out his hands and executing some kind of Secret Technique that formed a kind of shield in front of him.

His efforts were in vain, however, and the water spear instantly pierced through the shield without stagnating in the slightest.

Jiang Huai An was shocked as he was forced to realize that everything in front of him was not an illusion, but real.

By the time he came to this understanding, it was too late for him to dodge.

The water arrow pierced through Jiang Huai An’s body, causing a great splash of blood as it shot out his back.

Jiang Huai An’s eyes widened as he collapsed backwards.

However, because of Sha Hu’s previous plea, Yang Kai did not kill him. Even so, this blow had taken most of Jiang Huai An’s remaining life, and if he weren’t given immediate treatment, his cultivation would definitely drop significantly.

“With a single word, the world obeys, with a single thought, mountains are flattened and seas are boiled... Yang Kai, have you refined Shadowed Star’s Source?” Sha Hu asked with a trembling voice, an amazed light flashing across his eyes.

“What?” Qi Yun Hai’s face changed drastically as he stared at Yang Kai in utter shock.

Refining the Star Source was something that only existed in legends. Once a cultivator refined a Star Source, they would become the Star Master of that Cultivation Star and become capable of controlling everything on it at will.

Qi Yun Hai was subconsciously unwilling to believe something so unthinkable was real, because it was said that if one wanted to refine a Star Source, it was necessary to be a Third-Order Origin King first!

There were, of course, rumours that Second-Order Origin Kings with great luck were able to refine Star Sources and became Star Masters.

However, even that was too distant a concept, especially for the cultivators of Shadowed Star.

Yang Kai was a trivial Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, so how could he have possibly refined the Star Source?

But if this were not the case, how else could the scene here be explained?

Even an ordinary Origin King may not be able to display such might, right? Only a Star Master who commanded the forces of nature themselves on a Cultivation Star and could dominate its World Energy as he pleased could condense the oceans themselves into water dragons!

“Old Sha’s eyes are quite sharp, I was indeed fortunate enough to have such an opportunity,” Yang Kai smiled slightly, not attempting to deny it.

Qi Yun Hai could not help groaning in his heart.

He suddenly discovered that he had done something with Jiang Huai An that he would regret for the rest of his life.

Was there anything more foolish than trying to plot against Shadowed Star’s Star Master on Shadowed Star?

“As I thought!” Old Sha sighed softly and shook his head ruefully, “Such foolishness!”

He was obviously blaming Jiang Huai An for his short-sightedness. Originally, his friendship with Yang Kai was quite good, but after this incident, Yang Kai’s impression of Sea Temple would definitely be poor, and this would have a dramatically negative influence on the future development of Sea Temple.
