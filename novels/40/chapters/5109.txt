Shrieks were heard reverberating across this special space, each one representing the demise of a Feudal Lord’s consciousness.

Hei Yuan felt his heart sinking.

When the last Feudal Lord’s consciousness died, Yang Kai slowly turned around. While standing on the Seven-Coloured Soul Warming Lotus, he stared dispassionately at Hei Yuan’s consciousness.

The tide of Spiritual Energy swirled around Yang Kai like a violent storm.

“You’re the only one left, Hei Yuan. Are you ready to die?” Yang Kai stepped towards his enemy, the Seven-Coloured Soul Warming Lotus following closely.

Hei Yuan roared, “You’ll pay for underestimating me!”

Despite the ferocity in his tone, it was apparent that he was just acting tough. Just now, he had joined forces with more than 30 Feudal Lords, but they still couldn’t hurt Yang Kai at all. Instead, they were the ones that were wiped out. More than 30 Feudal Lords had died, and he was the only one left now, so how was he supposed to be a match for Yang Kai?

The only thing he could do was to stall for time so that the team he had sent could capture Yang Kai.

After a sneer, Yang Kai said, “Let’s see how you’re going to make me pay then!”

Upon finishing his words, he drove the Soul Warming Lotus to charge towards Hei Yuan.

A flustered Hei Yuan promptly ran away.

While relentlessly chasing after him, Yang Kai mocked him by saying, “Didn’t you say you’ll make me pay the price? Is this how you do it? It’s an eye-opener for me, Sir Hei Yuan!”

Hei Yuan was thoroughly ashamed and had the urge to stop in his tracks and fight it out with Yang Kai, but he didn’t have the courage to do so. His consciousness was already wounded after the exchanges of moves with Yang Kai. If his injuries were exacerbated, he would have to get into a Black Ink Nest and recuperate for a long time.

Therefore, he did his best to avoid fighting with Yang Kai so that he wouldn’t get hurt.

Yang Kai wasn’t a fool, so he soon realised what the other man was trying to achieve, “Are you stalling for time?”

Certainly, Hei Yuan wouldn’t respond to him, but his silence only confirmed Yang Kai’s speculations. After giving it a thought, he figured out the other man’s plan, “If I’m not mistaken, there should be some Black Ink Clansmen coming to capture me. Am I right?”

Hei Yuan finally responded, saying, “You can’t flee. Surrender without a fight now.”

Yang Kai sneered, “We’ll talk if you can survive.”

Left with no choice, he had to exchange moves with Yang Kai several times, which resulted in his aura weakening even further. On the other hand, with the protection of the Soul Warming Lotus, Yang Kai became increasingly ferocious, abandoning all semblance of defence and only attacking.

His consciousness was badly wounded. It would take him several hundred years to heal this kind of injury. If he clashed with Yang Kai again, his consciousness would be destroyed, just like what happened to the Feudal Lords.

Despite his unwillingness, there was nothing else he could do. He had paid a huge price, losing more than 30 Feudal Lords and suffering horrible injuries himself; however, he still hadn’t managed to capture one Seventh-Order Human like Yang Kai.

This was the biggest humiliation in his life.

Nevertheless, things had come to such a point where he could no longer turn things around. If Hei Yuan still didn’t give up, he would be killed by Yang Kai before the team of Feudal Lords he sent could capture him.

Therefore, at the last moment, he promptly decided to escape.

Just as Yang Kai dashed forward with his violent tide of Spiritual Energy, he realised that Hei Yuan was nowhere in sight. At the same time, this special space, which had been locked since his arrival, was reopened.

[He ran away!] Yang Kai ground his teeth, thinking that it was such a shame. If he could keep fighting with Hei Yuan, he had the confidence to kill the latter’s consciousness. Unfortunately, Hei Yuan was the one who could decide whether he would open up the space, and he didn’t give Yang Kai a chance to kill him.

Killing a Territory Lord would be a huge contribution. By doing so, not only could it significantly weaken the Black Ink Clan’s power, but it could also reduce the possible casualties of the Human soldiers on the battlefield.

Although Yang Kai had killed a Territory Lord before, he had joined forces with Bai Yi at that time to do so, and Zhu Feng, the Territory Lord in question, was already badly injured. Despite that, it had still been a perilous situation. In the end, Yang Kai managed to deal a lethal blow to Zhu Feng only by resorting to his Dragon Bead.

The chance to fight with Hei Yuan this time was rare, and it was impossible to have such a chance again.

However, even though Hei Yuan had fled, it wasn’t like Yang Kai had achieved nothing.

When he was dealing with Hei Yuan just now, he managed to ascertain his whereabouts. If he raced after him now, he might be able to kill him.

Therefore, the instant Yang Kai realised that Hei Yuan had fled, he quickly retracted his consciousness and dashed out of the Feudal Lord’s Black Ink Nest.

It was silent all around him with no Black Ink Clansmen in sight, so he turned to look in a particular direction and shot into the sky.

As Space Principles undulated, Yang Kai charged forward swiftly.

About an hour later, he saw a group of Black Ink Clansmen rushing over in his direction. What surprised him was that this team was entirely composed of Feudal Lords, about a dozen in total.

This was obviously unusual.

The strongest Black Ink Clansmen had left to deal with the Human Army from Yin-Yang Pass, and although there were still a lot who stayed back, and Yang Kai had come across many of them recently, it was the first time he saw a group that consisted of only Feudal Lords.

This powerful team was obviously tasked with capturing Yang Kai.

Was this the arrangement Hei Yuan had made? When Yang Kai was dealing with Hei Yuan earlier, these Feudal Lords must have been heading in his direction. Unfortunately, they came too late as the battle in the special space had ended long ago. They were still on their way when Yang Kai happened to run into them.

It seemed that Hei Yuan was really located in that direction.

While Yang Kai had discovered the team of Feudal Lords, the other party had certainly seen him as well. These Feudal Lords, who were moving at full speed, were flabbergasted as they stopped in their tracks and got ready to fight. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

However, this Human’s consciousness was supposed to be trapped inside the Black Ink Nest’s network, and they just had to go over and capture his body. So, why was he here? Had Hei Yuan failed in his attempt to injure this Human in that special space?

Before these Feudal Lords could figure it out, Yang Kai was seen turning into a ray of light and charging towards them.

Before he even arrived, his spear turned into countless shadows.

The instant both parties clashed, the Feudal Lords exclaimed and grunted, feeling that the violent force had torn their defences apart. In an instant, they were all blown backwards.

Yang Kai directly moved past them and left this place without turning his head, soon disappearing from sight.

The place was in a mess as black blood and Black Ink Strength scattered everywhere. The Feudal Lords looked around with horrified expressions. Three of them were killed by Yang Kai in the blink of an eye, and the rest were injured.

It seemed that this Human was even more powerful than they had heard.

The surviving Feudal Lords were glad that Yang Kai didn’t intend to kill them. They had no idea why he was in a hurry as he only attacked them once and left; otherwise, all of them would’ve lost their lives.

One of the Feudal Lords suddenly realised something, “Is he after Sir Hei Yuan?”

When the Feudal Lords heard that, a myriad of expressions came over them. Even if that was true, there was nothing they could do. Now, they could only hope that Hei Yuan could capture that Human; otherwise, all the Black Ink Clansmen in Mu Guang’s Royal Domain would be humiliated.

It only took Yang Kai another hour to rush over to a certain Feudal Lord’s Fief.

The Feudal Lords guarding this Fief were startled upon seeing Yang Kai, and before they could figure out what was going on, they were easily killed.

When the only two Feudal Lords were dead, the other Black Ink Clansmen in the Fief certainly wouldn’t be able to counterattack.

Yang Kai directly barged into the Black Ink Nest and searched around, but Hei Yuan was nowhere in sight. However, some of Hei Yuan’s aura was left in the chamber inside the Black Ink Nest, which suggested that he had been here not long ago.

After dashing out of the Black Ink Nest, Yang Kai caught a horrified High-Rank Black Ink Clansman by the throat and asked in a grim voice, “Where’s Hei Yuan?”

The High-Rank Black Ink Clansman breathed out a puff of Black Ink Strength in an attempt to corrupt Yang Kai, but an unperturbed Yang Kai simply exerted more force with his hand and broke the other party’s neck. He then caught another Black Ink Clansman and asked, “Where’s Hei Yuan?”

Having witnessed what happened just now, the Black Ink Clansman replied in horror, “I have no idea where Sir Hei Yuan went! He left in a hurry just now!”

“In what direction did he head?”

The Black Ink Clansman quickly pointed in a particular direction.

Yang Kai tossed him away, and by the time the Black Ink Clansman landed, he had lost his life.

In the meantime, Yang Kai shot into the sky and raced after Hei Yuan.

Since Hei Yuan had fled, it suggested that he was badly injured, and he had speculated that Yang Kai would come for him; otherwise, he wouldn’t have immediately run away after leaving the special space. Although Yang Kai had promptly pursued, he was still too late.

Even if Yang Kai chased after Hei Yuan now, he might not be able to find him as the void was too vast. He also wouldn’t have any solution if Hei Yuan was determined to hide.

However, he wouldn’t want to miss this rare chance. It would be best if he could kill Hei Yuan, but there was nothing he could do if he couldn’t find him.

One day later, Yang Kai stopped in his tracks somewhere in the void.

Although he had searched around a large area for the entire day, he still hadn’t discovered Hei Yuan’s whereabouts. He felt that it was such a shame.

With that said, it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing for him.

Most of the Black Ink Clansmen had left Mu Guang’s Royal Domain to fight with the Humans from Yin-Yang Pass, so there were not a lot of them left in this place. The Territory Lords who stayed back had to assist Mu Guang to deal with the Old Ancestor from Yin-Yang Pass, so they wouldn’t have time to hunt Yang Kai down.

Previously, he had to put his guard up as Hei Yuan was relentlessly pursuing him. Now that Hei Yuan had gone into hiding though, no one else in Mu Guang’s Royal Domain could restrain him.

In other words, Yang Kai could basically go anywhere in this Royal Domain. Given his mastery of the Dao of Space, he wouldn’t fall into danger as long as he was cautious enough.

At the thought of this, he turned to look in a particular direction and grinned.
