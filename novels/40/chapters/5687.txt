Faced with such an open and blatant threat, Mo Na Ye not only did not get angry, but instead felt a sense of relief that Yang Kai had finally taken this step.

The reason he left the No-Return Pass was to give a false impression to Yang Kai that there was only one Royal Lord on guard now, and he had a chance to destroy the Black Ink Nests!

Unfortunately, for the past 10 years, Yang Kai had never appeared outside of the No-Return Pass and had been constantly looting the resource squads, causing the Royal Lord’s initial plan to fail.

It wasn’t until today that Yang Kai finally revealed intentions of using the Black Ink Nests to threaten the Black Ink Clan.

Mo Na Ye was secretly delighted and quickly replied, “Yang Kai! Some things can be done once or twice, but not thrice! You have trespassed into the No-Return Pass twice and destroyed many Black Ink Nests, but if you dare try this again, I, Mo Na Ye, will never let you go!”

The message was sent out, but there was no response after a long time of waiting.

A million kilometres away, Yang Kai carefully observed each change in Mo Na Ye’s expression and began making plans in his heart…

He had thought about going to the No-Return Pass to threaten to destroy some Black Ink Nests and force the Black Ink Clan to meet his demands and had even taken action for this purpose.

Over the past 10 years, he had secretly investigated the No-Return Pass several times; however, with his increasing mastery of the Dao of Time, his sensitivity to future crises had become much higher.

This sense had helped him avoid some dangers during his last rampage in the No-Return Pass, and it was the same now.

Every time he approached the No-Return Pass, the idea of destroying Black Ink Nests would unconsciously bring a sense of peril, as if there was a great danger hidden within the No-Return Pass that could threaten him!

This puzzled Yang Kai greatly. Mo Na Ye had gone to the depths of void for all these years, and only one Royal Lord was guarding the No-Return Pass. According to his current strength, as long as he avoided that Royal Lord, the No-Return Pass would be his to enter and exit as he pleased. With the No-Return Pass being such a large area and the numerous High-Rank Black Ink Nests of the Black Ink Clan so scattered, one Royal Lord couldn’t look after all of them.

So, where did this sense of danger come from?

The sense of danger he felt during his last rampage in the No-Return Pass was due to Mo Na Ye hiding in the shadows. Based on his experience from last time, Yang Kai naturally guessed that… the Black Ink Clan had produced another Pseudo-Royal Lord!

Mo Na Ye believed that Yang Kai knew nothing about the situation at the No-Return Pass, but in reality, Yang Kai had been observing secretly to confirm his suspicions.

And Mo Na Ye’s response this time was undeniable evidence of this.

Regardless of whether it was Mo Na Ye when he was still an Innate Territory Lord in the past or the current Mo Na Ye as a Pseudo-Royal Lord, he would always address Yang Kai as ‘Sir Yang’, naturally showing respect to an elite fighter regardless of their hostile relationship.

But this time, Mo Na Ye addressed Yang Kai by his name directly, and his words carried a hidden threat, almost like he was daring Yang Kai to immediately cause trouble at the No-Return Pass. This was not Mo Na Ye’s usual behaviour.

Yang Kai, seeing this, knew that his suspicion was probably correct, there must be a new Pseudo-Royal Lord at the No-Return Pass, lying in ambush with the Royal Lord.

In the void, Yang Kai raised his brow and smiled, finding it quite interesting to engage in this battle of wits with Mo Na Ye. He thus quickly replied, “Just wait and see! This time, this King will not rest until he destroys 10 High-Rank Black Ink Nests!”

After transmitting the message, Yang Kai put away his communication bead and disappeared from sight.

In the distant void, Mo Na Ye also hurriedly put away his communication bead, raised his palm, and a surge of thick Black Ink Strength rushed out, quickly forming a vortex in his palm. Within the vortex, a very delicate and small Black Ink Nest appeared.

This was a Low-Rank Black Ink Nest, which was not yet mature.

Such a Black Ink Nest was not very useful to the Black Ink Clan, but it was perfect for transmitting messages.

Now, the Territory Lords who were searching for Yang Kai’s whereabouts and escorting the supply teams almost all had such a miniature Black Ink Nest, just to facilitate rapid communication with each other.

By summoning this small Black Ink Nest, Mo Na Ye sent a message to the No-Return Pass, informing the Royal Lord about Yang Kai’s imminent arrival and telling them to prepare.

After doing so, Mo Na Ye also hurried towards the No-Return Pass, secretly praying for a swift victory.

If Yang Kai thought that there was only one Royal Lord guarding the No-Return Pass, he would surely make a mistake, and if the Royal Lord and Meng Que teamed up, they only needed to entangle him for 10 breaths so the Territory Lords could activate the Four Gates Eight Palaces Great Pagoda Array. Once the Grand Array was formed, Yang Kai would be trapped like a cornered beast, without the ability to use Space Principle’s to flee, Yang Kai would only be a slightly stronger Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, incapable of facing all the elites of the Black Ink Clan.

[After years of entanglement, is it finally time to determine the winner and loser of our little game?] Mo Na Ye suddenly felt like he was dreaming.

However, he had only made it halfway back when he suddenly stopped and hastily summoned the miniature Black Ink Nest. As his Divine Sense poured it to investigate, his face turned pale in an instant.

The message from the Black Ink Nest was too bizarre to believe at first, but after verifying it a few times, he confirmed that he had indeed read it correctly.

Standing there, his expression fluctuated for a moment before he turned and flew in another direction.

Half a day later, he arrived in a spot in the void and appeared before four Territory Lords who had formed a Battle Formation.

“Sir Mo Na Ye!” The four Territory Lords were overjoyed to see him as if they had seen their saviour.

“What happened?” Mo Na Ye asked in a deep voice.

One of the four Territory Lords immediately recounted their encounter with Yang Kai, which was actually quite simple. They were escorting a supply team back to the No-Return Pass when Yang Kai suddenly appeared…

Over the years, they had encountered Yang Kai several times, but he had never attacked them directly; instead, he attacked the Black Ink Clansmen who were transporting materials, killing mostly low-rank soldiers. For the four Territory Lords, Yang Kai mainly used his Soul Secret Technique as a threat, forcing them to compromise and hand over the resources.

Under threat of imminent death, the Territory Lords had no choice but to comply. As a result, every time Yang Kai made a move, he was able to gain something.

But this time, Yang Kai not only slaughtered the Black Ink Clansmen transporting the materials, but also injured the four Territory Lords, one of whom was seriously wounded.

Mo Na Ye was not angry after listening to this, but rather pleasantly surprised, “He used his Soul Secret Technique?”

Yang Kai often used his Soul Secret Technique to intimidate Territory Lords, but he had never actually activated it before.

Mo Na Ye even suspected that Yang Kai was just bluffing this whole time.

Mo Na Ye had intended to prevent the Territory Lords from compromising at all costs, but he knew that even if he issued such an order, the Territory Lords would find it difficult to hold out in a life-or-death crisis.

Losing the materials was a small matter, but losing Territory Lords was a serious blow.

But if Yang Kai had used his Soul Secret Technique this time, it meant that he would enter a period of retreat and recuperation for the next 2 or 3 years. This would undoubtedly be his weakest time, and if they could find his whereabouts, the situation would be promising.

However, to Mo Na Ye’s surprise, the four Territory Lords looked embarrassed and shook their heads in unison. The speaking Territory Lord cried out, “He did not!”

Upon hearing that, Mo Na Ye’s joyous expression instantly disappeared, and he frowned, “If he didn’t use his Soul Secret Technique, how did he manage to injure all of you like this?”

The four Innate Territory Lords had formed the Four Symbols Formation, making it impossible for Yang Kai to pose a substantial threat to them without using his Soul Secret Technique. Although Yang Kai was strong, he was not yet strong enough to break this Formation forcibly. Even Mo Na Ye would have to work hard to injure the four Territory Lords who were united in this Formation.

The expressions of the four Territory Lords became even more embarrassed and they stammered, not knowing how to explain; however, Mo Na Ye had already figured it out at that point and asked with a stern face, “Did you break the Battle Formation yourselves?”

Only then could Yang Kai pick them off one by one.

The Territory Lord who spoke earlier shamefully admitted, “Yes! It’s just that maintaining the Four Symbols Formation consumes our mental strength, and although there was no problem in the short term, it’s been 10 years now… We find it difficult to maintain the Battle Formation at all times, so…”

In fact, it wasn’t just these four Territory Lords, other Territory Lords who had formed Four Symbols and Five Elements Formations also encountered similar problems. Maintaining the Battle Formation for a long time put a heavy burden on their minds, so sometimes they would break the Battle Formation to disconnect their auras and let themselves recover a little.

How could they have known that Yang Kai would take advantage of this opportunity to attack them? If they hadn’t been on alert and quickly formed the Battle Formation again after Yang Kai appeared, they might have suffered more than just injuries.

The Territory Lord cautiously peered at Mo Na Ye’s expression, thinking that he would be severely reprimanded for their failure; however, all Mo Na Ye did was sigh, “It was my carelessness.”

He thought that their operation against Yang Kai would not take too long, but he never expected that it would take 10 years and still not produce any results. If Yang Kai could injure four Territory Lords in just 10 years, what about another 10 or 100 years? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

It was as the saying went, “One need not fear a thief who always steals, they should fear the thief who constantly thinks of stealing.”

When Mo Na Ye first heard this, he did not understand, but now he finally did.

[Yang Kai, that thief! You are truly my eternal nemesis!]

[That bastard even vowed to destroy 10 High-Rank Black Ink Nests in the No-Return Pass, but all he did was go against his words and injure four Territory Lords. I was a fool to have believed anything he said.]

It appeared that Yang Kai had seen through the arrangements at the No-Return Pass, which was why he had never gone there but instead wreaked havoc out here in the void.

“Send a message to the other Squads and tell all Territory Lords to be careful. Yang Kai could strike at any time,” Mo Na Ye ordered, remembering the lesson from these four Territory Lords as he believed that Yang Kai would strike again.

Then, the four Territory Lords followed Mo Na Ye’s order and took out their miniature Black Ink Nests to spread the word.
