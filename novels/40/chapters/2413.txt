On the small island, Zi Yu was dumbstruck.

After getting locked up here, she followed her Honoured Master’s instructions and used the artifact left behind by the Sect’s Ancestral Founder to contact her. She wanted to summon their Ancestral Founder, who had been missing for three thousand years, to uphold justice for her.

According to what her Honoured Master told her, if there was someone in this world who could save her from the abyss of desperation, it was their Ancestral Founder.

However, their Ancestral Founder had been missing ever since she left the Sect three thousand years ago, and there had been no news of her since then. In these three thousand years, Ice Heart Valley had encountered many disasters, and during one of the disasters, her Honoured Master had used the method left behind by the Ancestral Founder to connect with the artifact and send a distress signal; however, no one replied back then.

Many of the Sect’s higher-ups thought that the Ancestral Founder had died somewhere in the Star Boundary. That was the only explanation as to why she never came back.

Even her Honoured Master was no longer sure if their Ancestral Founder still lived or not; however, this was their only hope.

When Zi Yu used the artifact to send a distress signal, she did so out of desperation and had no real expectations of success.

Never would she have expected that someone would receive the signal and come here. What surprised her even more was that the person who came here was a man!

Wasn’t it the Ancestral Founder who left this artifact here? And, wasn’t she a woman? So, why was the person here a man? Zi Yu couldn’t make sense of the situation.

While she was trying to guess Yang Kai’s identity, the latter spoke, “Sister Zi Yu, can I come closer before speaking? Otherwise, I’m afraid we might alert the people outside.”

Zi Yu tried to calm down and said indifferently, “If you can bear the cold, sure.”

Yang Kai smiled faintly and jumped over towards the lake’s centre.

In the next moment, he was standing on the small island, and a familiar face was reflected in his eyes.

[It really is her!]

Yang Kai was puzzled. He met this girl named Zi Yu a few days ago, when she was being besieged by people from Seeking Passion Sect, but after he helped her, not only was she not grateful, she even became vigilant and directly fled.

And now, for some reason, she was locked up in the Sect’s Restricted Area.

“It’s you!” Zi Yu called out in surprise after seeing Yang Kai. Noticing that her voice was too loud, she hurriedly covered her mouth, her beautiful eyes lightly quivering as she asked, “How can this be?”

She naturally remembered Yang Kai as they had met a few days ago, when he gave her a big helping hand, but what she couldn’t understand was how he reached Ice Heart Valley’s Restricted Area without getting noticed by anyone.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Sister Zi Yu, you can rest assured, I don’t have any malicious intentions towards you,” seeing her vigilant expression, Yang Kai hurried to take a step back, “I’m here because someone asked me to come.”

“Someone asked you to come here? Who?” Zi Yu asked skeptically.

Yang Kai smiled, “Take a look at this.”

He then stretched out his hand and threw Bing Yun’s token to Zi Yu.

Still puzzled, Zi Yu caught the token before glancing up at Yang Kai then down to begin examining the token.

After a short moment, her tender body trembled and her eyes opened wide as she said with an expression of disbelief, “This is… Ancestral Founder’s aura!”

Although she didn’t recognize this token, she could tell that the wisp of aura on it wasn’t fake, and this wisp of aura happened to be the same as the one on the emergency contact artifact the Ancestral Founder had left behind!

She raised her head and looked at Yang Kai in astonishment, saying with both a happy and anxious tone, “Are you saying that the one who sent you here is…”

“Shh!” Yang Kai put his finger over his lips, hinting that she should not speak further.

However, Zi Yu was too happy and clutched the token tightly while almost choking on her sobs, “I knew it. I knew it. Ancestral Founder is alive and well. My Honoured Master can finally rest easy.”

She changed the subject abruptly, starting to talk about her Honoured Master.

At the same time, she took out a Communication Bead and released her Divine Sense, pouring it into the bead to relay some information.

Yang Kai frowned, “What are you doing?”

Zi Yu said, “My Honoured Master has always been worrying about the Ancestral Founder’s safety, if she learns that she’s safe, she’ll certainly be delighted.”

Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat, “It’s better not to tell your Honoured Master about this matter for now.”

“Why?”

Yang Kai said, “Senior Bing Yun can’t come over right now. She’ll come here in a few days, and your Honoured Master will get to meet her at that time.”

Hearing his words, Zi Yu paused, pondering for a moment before nodding, “Forgive me, I was too excited. Right, I still haven’t asked Senior Brother’s name.”

Yang Kai said, “You can just call me Yang Kai.”

“So, it is Senior Brother Yang!” Zi Yu relaxed, putting on a happy face and smiling brightly. This smile of hers almost made the World lose colour and Yang Kai was slightly dazed when he saw it, but he quickly returned to his senses.

Zi Yu noticed his change in expression, praising him inwardly. Very few men could resist her charm, and most of them only had lust in their eyes while looking at her.

Her beauty did daze Yang Kai, but only for a moment. He was obviously a man with great self-control.

“Zi Yu has been rude and failed to thank Senior Brother Yang appropriately for saving her life. I hope Senior Brother Yang does not take offence,” Zi Yu said, somewhat embarrassed. After knowing that it was their Ancestral Founder who had sent Yang Kai here, she found him very likeable and didn’t have any problem calling him ‘Senior Brother’. It felt as if they were really part of the same Sect despite Ice Heart Valley not having any male disciples. Zi Yu never had a Senior or Junior Brother, but Yang Kai gave her the feeling of being trustworthy.

“Don’t worry. I’m sure Sister Zi Yu had her reasons.” Yang Kai smiled.

Zi Yu slightly nodded, then forced a smile, “As Senior Brother Yang can see, I’ve been in some trouble lately.”

“Sister Zi Yu, did something happen to Ice Heart Valley as of late? If you don’t mind, can you tell me about it?” Yang Kai asked. He had come here with two missions. One was to find the disciple who had contacted Bing Yun, and the other was to discover what was going on with Ice Heart Valley.

“Senior Brother Yang, you can directly call me Junior Sister,” Zi Yu said gently. The last time, she saw Yang Kai easily defeating Cao Yang, something that was beyond her capabilities, therefore, even if they had the same cultivation, she felt inferior to him.

“But yes, something has happened. Moreover, this matter is related to me,” Zi Yu continued, a guilty expression appearing on her face. After taking a short moment to arrange her thoughts, she raised her head and said, “Senior Brother Yang, you know of the Seeking Passion Sect, yes?”

Yang Kai nodded. Although he didn’t know much about the scepticallysion Sect, he knew some key information. It was a Sect with considerable influence in the Northern Territory, and they had many strong Masters. To make a comparison, they stood on the same level as the Southern Territory’s Azure Sun Temple.

“Seeking Passion Sect’s core Secret Art is the Seeking Passion Supreme Art,” Zi Yu continued, “This Secret Art is very strange, and it is a big reason as to why Seeking Passion Sect was able to maintain its lofty status in the Northern Territory for so many years. I’ve heard that the creator of this Secret Art was a Great Emperor. That Great Emperor was called ‘Seeking Passion’, and those that cultivate this Secret Art use ‘passion’ as their Dao. The greater the passion, the higher the cultivation speed.”

Yang Kai was astonished, “Does that mean that everyone from the Seeking Passion Sect is a Casanova?”

Zi Yu sneered, “Senior Brother Yang, you’re giving them too much credit by calling them Casanovas.”

Yang Kai frowned, “But didn’t you say that they use ‘passion’ as a path to cultivation? If they aren’t highly skilled in the art of seduction, how can they even cultivate this Seeking Passion Supreme Art?”

Zi Yu nodded, “They indeed take passion as their Dao, and they also need to experience unforgettable love while cultivating; however, once Seeking Passion Sect’s elite disciples can use their ‘Seeking Passion Supreme Art’ at will and start looking for a partner, women have a hard time resisting their charm due to this Secret Art. Even casual exposure over enough time is to make these women fall into the abyss of passion.”

“This Secret Art is so abnormal?” Yang Kai was surprised. These men were using passion as their Dao to cultivate was one thing, but the fact that they could also use their Secret Art to influence the mentality of their partner was beyond his expectations. This was the ultimate technique to pick up women as it seemed that no woman could withstand the charm of those that cultivated the Seeking Passion Supreme Art!

“The Seeking Passion Supreme Art doesn’t only require the user to feel passionate, but their partner as well. If the woman isn’t moved at all, the user will receive a significant backlash, and the greater the difference in passion, the stronger the backlash,” Zi Yu explained with a disgusted expression on her face, “If that Seeking Passion Sect disciple can win over the woman’s heart, then they can live on as lovers and perhaps even have a happy life, but the problem is that very few women can keep pace with someone that has learned this Secret Art. After a few years, the disparity in strength between the two will become so big that the woman will no longer provide benefits to a Seeking Passion Sect disciple in any way. As such, that disciple would have no look for another woman to fall in love with. It’s like a never-ending cycle where the disparity between the two keeps growing bigger and bigger.”

Yang Kai gulped and said with envy, “Does that mean that every Seeking Passion Sect disciple has a dozen or so wives, and these wives love them so much that they can’t bear to leave them?”

Zi Yu looked at Yang Kai and sharply accused, “Senior Brother Yang, why does it look like you’re envious?”

Yang Kai wiped the drool from the corner of his mouth and hurriedly waved his hand, “How could that possibly be!? I was just surprised at how heartless and disgusting this Secret Art is. I absolutely loathe this kind of Secret Art that mocks human decency!”

It was unknown if Zi Yu believed him or not, but she didn’t dwell on the matter further, “All of Seeking Passion Sect’s elite disciples cultivate the Seeking Passion Supreme Art, and they don’t just stop at a dozen wives. Some of them have managed to capture the hearts of hundreds of young women while cultivating. What’s worse is that all those women are dead set on them. I’m starting to wonder if they’re crazy or something!”

Zi Yu clenched her teeth, clearly disappointed by those women.
