When Mo became friends with Cang and the others back then, it was completely sincere with them.

Among the ten, it was most fond of Mu, who was always gentle and amiable. Compared to the others, Mu was also more friendly to Mo.

When the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction started taking effect, Mu suggested planting the restriction inside Mo’s body so that it could internally suppress its Black Ink Strength. That way, they didn’t have to restrict Mo’s freedom. As long as the restriction wasn’t broken, its Black Ink Strength wouldn’t leak out, and Mo wouldn’t have to bear the suffering of being imprisoned. By then, they could bring Mo with them and monitor it at all times.

However, no one could guarantee that the idea was feasible. Everyone would be happy if it worked, but if it didn’t, Mo wouldn’t let them suppress it again when it was aware of their intentions.

In the end, Cang and the others didn’t dare to take the risk.

Mu passed away pretty early on when Mo flared up for the first time after it was suppressed. To appease Mo, she ignored the others’ dissuasion and entered the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction on her own.

No one knew what happened to her while she was inside, but when she returned, she was horribly wounded. Before her death, she blended all her power and her body into the restriction to strengthen it.

That day, Cang and the others were heartbroken while Mo’s wails reverberated across the entire universe.

Among the ten of them, the gentle and compassionate woman was the most talented. It could be said that the others were not comparable to her. She was the one who came up with the idea of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction and Duan personally crafted it while the rest assisted from the side.

Mu was also the most powerful among them. Cang even suspected that she had found the path that led beyond the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

Unfortunately, she passed away when she was still fairly young. Given her aptitude, she could have ascended to a realm that was beyond the Ninth Order.

Cang turned solemn when he heard Mo mention Mu and grimly said, “You’re fully aware of how Mu was killed, Mo.”

A furious Mo roared, “Do you think I killed her? It wasn’t me! I’d never kill her! Why would I do that to her?”

Cang snorted, “She passed away after returning from inside the restriction. Why had she fallen into such a state if not for you?”

“It really wasn’t me!” Mo refuted.

“Enough. Whether or not it was your doing no longer matters.”

Now that 2 million Human Race soldiers had arrived, they had to weaken Mo’s power even if they couldn’t destroy it. Cang couldn’t persevere any longer.

Like a child who had been wrongly accused, Mo cried, “It really wasn’t me…”

Nevertheless, it was a fact that Mu passed away after leaving the restriction. Even after all these years, Mo had never been able to explain why.

Mu was just that strong. Even though the servants that Mo had created were formidable, they couldn’t possibly cause enough injury to her for her to fall. Moreover, Mu was the one who came up with the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. If she wanted to leave it, there was no way Mo could stop her, and there was certainly no reason for her to fight with Mo to the death.

As they recalled the scenes from back then, they realised that Mu’s injuries were not a result of fighting against someone. There was some other reason for them.

At that time, she was critically injured and on her last breath.

Before her death, she passed them a piece of jade and left for the next world without saying anything more.

Now, that jade was in Cang’s hands. He had examined the jade over and over again, but was never able to figure out what it was for. He just felt that the jade had something to do with the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction.

Therefore, he wouldn’t dare to try it out lest the restriction was affected.

The incident in the past remained a mystery. Perhaps Mo knew something about it; however, it might also know nothing.

“Everything is prepared, Senior.”

The Great Battle Heaven Old Ancestor landed beside Cang, causing him to snap back to the present.

Cang looked up and saw over 100 Great Passes hovering in the void. On the Great Passes, the determined Humans were filled with murderous intent. He pulled himself together and nodded gently, “Let’s begin, then.”

The Great Battle Cave Heaven Old Ancestor turned around and nodded at the people in the distance.

“Prepare for war!”

A roar reverberated across the entire void as World Forces started exuding from the Great Passes. The arrays and the artifacts all lit up.

They were ready to strike.

Seeing that, Cang shouted, “Open!”

In the next instant, his figure expanded rapidly. He soon became enormous as a powerful aura exuded from his frail body.

The Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters’ eyes brightened when they felt that aura.

Previously, when they asked Cang what realm he was in, he only told them that he was still in the Ninth Order, just further beyond the Old Ancestors.

The Old Ancestors asked nothing more.

However, at this moment, they could clearly feel that this old man, who had been guarding the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction for millions of years, had an aura that none of them could match.

The entire void seemed to be trembling as his aura spread out.

It was apparent that he wasn’t just further ahead of them in the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm. These Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters couldn’t help but think that Cang might have broken through the Ninth-Order and reached a realm that they were not aware of.

It had come to a point where they had reached the end of their cultivation journey, and they still hadn’t managed to find any new path forward. However, as they observed Cang’s aura now, they realised the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm was not the peak of the Martial Dao, there was still a higher summit to reach. They were just incapable of discovering it.

As Cang’s aura undulated, ripples started spreading across the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction and began gathering at a particular spot.

In front of that spot stood the Human formations. It was also where Mo formed a crack with its strength back then.

As the ripples spread, a gap appeared in the originally flawless restriction. In the beginning, it was just a small gap, but it soon expanded rapidly.

Cang roared and surged his power to control the size of the gap. Soon, the gap became as large as a lake, with space itself seemingly having been torn apart.

An extremely malevolent aura exuded from the opening, and despite having the protection of many Grand Arrays, those on the Great Passes could still clearly feel that chilling aura.

As they stared intently, they could see impossibly thick darkness sweltering in the gap. They could also faintly hear growls coming from within.

Seeing that, the Humans quickly put their guard up.

A long time later, the darkness still never spilled out of the gap, nor did any Black Ink Clansmen appear, but eventually, there came a moment when Mo’s roar sounded, “It really wasn’t me, you old fart! You’re all pompous people who never listen to me explain! Why? It wasn’t my fault! Since you don’t even care to listen to what I have to say, I’ll destroy everything and kill everyone!”

Following Mo’s howl, darkness gushed out of the gap like a flood bursting through a dam.

It wasn’t really darkness though; it was a torrent made from countless Black Ink Clansmen.

“Kill!”

Following the Army Commanders’ order, arrays on the Great Passes thrummed and the powers of the Secret Techniques and artifacts shot forth.

The first batch of the Black Ink Clansmen who stormed out of the gap hadn’t even managed to see what the outside world looked like before they were vaporized.

The place where the attacks from over 100 Great Passes landed instantly turned into a living Hell.

More and more Black Ink Clansmen were destroyed; however, since their first appearance, the Black Ink Clansmen had never stopped flooding out of the darkness.

They stepped on the corpses of their clansmen and fearlessly charged forward. Just a moment later, they were struck by the Secret Techniques and artifacts and killed. Their Black Ink Strength burst forth, and their corpses were then stepped on by the ones behind them.

This stretch of void, which had remained silent for millions of years, suddenly erupted with light and sound.

The Humans never stopped firing at the enemy, while the Black Ink Clansmen marched forward without pause. Regardless of the danger ahead, they didn’t even hesitate.

The gap was soon shrouded with Black Ink Strength. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Above the wall of Great Evolution Pass, Yang Kai was hovering in the void as he stared coldly at the front and remained still.

It wasn’t the right time for him to make a move yet.

This was a war that was unlike anything the Humans had experienced before, a fight that would be remembered by all future generations. If the Humans won, they could ensure some peaceful days for the 3,000 Worlds, but if they lost, the 3,000 Worlds would descend into chaos as Mo had threatened to destroy everything.

Even though there were a lot of soldiers and countless Masters on the Humans’ side, they didn’t dare to make rash moves. Those that were attacking the enemies were the cultivators who were in charge of the arrays on the walls of the Great Passes. The rest were conserving their strength.

It would take a long time before the war ended; therefore, they needed to ration their energy.

Three rotations of soldiers were arranged to control and activate the arrays to ensure that they would be able to fire continuously.

The Artifact Refiners and Array Masters were also on standby to repair the artifacts and arrays at any moment.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai sported a solemn expression.

Although the war had just started and he hadn’t participated in the fight, he could feel immense pressure washing over him from afar.

Even though the Humans managed to destroy these Black Ink Clansmen without getting hurt, the enemies who gushed out of the gap were all very weak.

According to the Black Ink Clan’s own classification, those enemies were just Serfs, even weaker than Low-Rank Clansmen.

As long as there were enough resources and a Black Ink Nest, they could produce an infinite number of such Black Ink Clansmen.

Although Mo appeared infuriated, it didn’t let its fury get the better of it. It knew it had to use these weak soldiers to drain the Humans’ strength first.

In fact, it wasn’t so surprising. The Black Ink Clan and the Human Race had been fighting against each other on the Black Ink Battlefield for countless years, and as the source of the Black Ink Clan, Mo, was able to monitor what was going on in every Theatre. Therefore, it was familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the Human Race.

Its way of dealing with the Humans now was the best solution available.
