“Sister Hua, from now on, you will be the Head Manager of our High Heaven Palace. Above you are the Great Elders, while below you are the disciples at all levels who shall be under your jurisdiction and shall listen to your orders!” Yang Kai patted Hua Qing Si on the shoulder and looked at her solemnly.

Confused, Hua Qing Si blinked her eyes, her long eyelashes fluttering.

“Come, come. There are two hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals, three billion Mid-Rank Source Crystals, ten billion Low-Rank Source Crystals, and various other materials in this ring. Take this first. These cultivation resources are now under your management too.”

Then, he stuffed a Space Ring into Hua Qing Si’s hands.

“Wait!!” Hua Qing Si shouted as she frowned at Yang Kai, “Since when did I become the Head Manager of your High Heaven Palace?”

She bumped into Yang Kai on her way to check on the movement that she sensed from Thousand Leaves Peak. Then, all of a sudden, she had a Space Ring with enormous wealth stuffed into her hands together with a bunch of inexplicable words.

“I already told you, ‘from now on!’” Yang Kai looked at her seriously, with a demeanour of handing over the important task of maintaining the peace of the Sect and the leading of the Sect to glory to her.

“Why should I be a Head Manager?” Hua Qing Si retorted.

Yang Kai replied solemnly, “I’ve considered it carefully before making this decision. No one throughout the whole of High Heaven Palace is more suitable for this position than you. Sister Hua, this Palace Master is depending on you. This is a very important position, please don’t let this Palace Master down.”

“What do you mean by the whole of High Heaven Palace?” Hua Qing Si pursed her lips, “There aren’t even ten people in this Sect in total!”

Apart from the Thousand Leaves Sect disciples who were essentially refugees here, the only real inhabitants of High Heaven Palace now were the three Monster Kings as Honoured Guest Elders, Chi Yue, Ai Ou, Gui Zu, and Gu Cang Yun.

Yang Kai scratched his face awkwardly and continued to persuade, “Everything is difficult at the beginning. There will be many people in the future, so you can try practising your management skills to start…”

“Who can I practice on?” Hua Qing Si looked at him contemptuously.

Yang Kai pointed in the direction of Thousand Leaves Sect, “Aren’t there a few hundred people over there?”

“They don’t belong to High Heaven Palace.”

“That’s true for now, but it won’t necessarily be true in the future,” Yang Kai grinned.

Hua Qing Si swept her eyes up and down him before raising a brow and asking, “Oh, you want to snatch their disciples?”

Yang Kai denied with a straight face, “Nonsense. This Palace Master would never do something so despicable. However, it’s normal that people would strive hard to reach higher heights. If they wanted to stay and become our High Heaven Palace’s disciples, I wouldn’t reject them. Of course, if Sister Hua can manage to keep all of Thousand Leaves Sect here… it would be for the best.”

Hua Qing Si nodded, “What you said is reasonable. Thousand Leaves Sect’s Puppet Dao is truly amazing. It would be a good thing if we could acquire it.”

Yang Kai was delighted, “Isn’t that right? Then this task is in your hands.”

“Fine, I don’t have anything to do lately anyway. I will try, but where should I start?”

Yang Kai pursed his lips, “Didn’t I just give you so many Source Crystals? Just pound them with them! Their Sect was just destroyed and they definitely need many Source Crystals to cultivate. I don’t believe they won’t give in.”

Hua Qing Si glared angrily at him, “Your Source Crystals did not just appear from thin air! How can you give them out for no reason? However, if they make some kind of contribution to High Heaven Palace, perhaps I can reward some Source Crystals to them.”

“Good, good, good!” Yang Kai was overjoyed, because his Sister Hua was already beginning to consider the good of High Heaven Palace just after assuming the position of Head Manager. He indeed did not pick the wrong person! Since she was born in Star Soul Palace, she would certainly be more familiar with the management of a big Sect than the others here. She was the best choice to take charge of the early development of High Heaven Palace.

“Do whatever you feel is best. This Palace Master grants you free reign!” Yang Kai was gratified.

Hua Qing Si snorted, “If I do well in this job, you have to reward me too! If you want a horse to run, you must let it graze well.”

“Yes, yes, yes, you can have any reward you want at that time,” Yang Kai quickly promised.

“Remember what you said,” Hua Qing Si smiled then turned to Thousand Leaves Peak, “Is it Ye Hen who is breaking through to the Emperor Realm?”

“Who else could it be?” Yang Kai looked over in that direction too.

At this moment, World Energy had gathered atop Thousand Leaves Peak and was now crashing down in great streams like an astonishing dance of dragons.

Hua Qing Si asked curiously, “I remember Ye Hen just started to cultivate in retreat not long ago. How did he reach this point so quickly?”

“Maybe he stepped onto his own Dao.” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

“His own Dao…” Hua Qing Si thought deeply before a light flashed across her beautiful eyes, “I’ll go and have a look. Do you want to go too?”

Yang Kai shook his head. He just came back from there and already knew about Ye Hen’s situation, so he did not need to check again. However, it was good for Hua Qing Si to check it out. As High Heaven Palace’s Head Manager, this crucial moment when Ye Hen was breaking through to the Emperor Realm was also the greatest time to win the people’s hearts.

Five Saints Peak, a Main Peak where Chi Yue and the others had settled. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The so-called ‘Five Saints’ referred to their five sworn brothers and sister of different surnames. Although Chai Hu was missing, Gui Zu and the others had not forgotten to include him.

When Yang Kai arrived, the four of them seemed to be cultivating in retreat.

The four of them were just First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators when they were first reunited with Yang Kai in Sky Crane City. After a few years of cultivation in Thousand Leaves Sect, all of them had reached the peak of the First-Order.

After all, the cultivation environment in Thousand Leaves Sect was not bad, but also not excellent.

On the contrary, Five Saints Peak provided them with an amazing cultivation paradise, one even better than Thousand Leaves Peak. The peak was extremely tall and grand, a magnificent mountain in every sense. The four of them were like fishes returning to the sea here, living carefreely as they cultivated.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to alert the four of them as he arrived at the palace at the top of the peak with a flicker.

Although nobody had been cleaning this place all this time, the palace was still spotless because of the maintenance Spirit Arrays.

It did not take long until several figures emerged from the outside.

“Palace Master!” The four cupped their fists.

Although Chi Yue and Ai Ou were technically Yang Kai’s Seniors, since they had joined High Heaven Palace, they naturally had to abide by the rules of High Heaven Palace.

“Have a seat!” Yang Kai gestured as he too sat cross-legged directly on the floor of the palace.

The four exchanged looks, then sat on the ground one after another without much thought about it, forming a small circle.

With a swing of Yang Kai’s hand, four space rings flew towards the four of them.

“There are twenty million High-Rank Source Crystals, one hundred million Mid-Rank Source Crystals, one billion Low-Rank Source Crystals, and some Spirit Pills that I refined in these rings. Use these resources to cultivate for now, and if it’s not enough, find Hua Qing Si. She has some Source Crystals with her.” Yang Kai explained.

Everyone’s eyes lit up and kept the rings with them without hesitation.

They were people who came from the same Star Field as Yang Kai, so there was no need to be polite. However, they were still shocked by Yang Kai’s generous gift. They had been worrying about cultivation resources ever since they arrived in the Star Boundary. Even after taking up residence in Thousand Leaves Sect, their resources were somewhat scarce, but Yang Kai just gave them a massive amount of wealth to spend.

Compared to him, they were poorer than beggars.

Such a tremendous amount of Source Crystals would be sufficient for them to cultivate for several dozen, or even several hundred years. Each of them was exhilarated and sighed that their hard days had finally come to an end.

“You all suffered a lot over the years since you came to Star Boundary with me. Your cultivations have even lagged behind, so quickly use these to improve your strength without worrying about other things. I believe you won’t want to be surpassed by the people from our Star Field who will come here in the future.”

“How is that possible for those little brats?” Ai Ou curled his lip.

He was among the most powerful Masters in their native Star Field, so even if they came here, there was no way for them to cultivate faster than him.

Chi Yue responded with a smile, “Second Brother, don’t be overconfident. Yang Boy cultivated a lot faster than us.”

Ai Ou became embarrassed, “Who can compare with him?”

They came to the Star Boundary together, but Yang Kai was already a First-Order Emperor Realm Master while they were still First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators, an entire Great Realm of difference. But could such a discrepancy be only due to a difference in resources?

“Being anxious won’t help in cultivation,” Gu Cang Yun smiled wryly.

Gui Zu nodded at the side.

Yang Kai pressed on, “En, that’s why I prepared a great blessing for all of you!”

The four of them held the Space Rings between their fingers and asked in confusion, “Isn’t it this?”

Yang Kai grinned before he stretched out his hand and summoned a number of big banners full of Yin Qi into his palm. The Yin Qi of these banners trembled fiercely while emitting cries and howls, making everyone feel uneasy.

Only the ghost fire in Gui Zu’s eyes flared up as he asked in pleasant surprise, “This is…”

“Netherworld Purgatory Banners from the Netherworld Sect in the Eastern Territory!” Yang Kai stated.

The few Netherworld Purgatory Banners in his hand were loot he collected from the people of the Netherworld Sect whom he killed. One of the banners was even an Emperor Artifact, originally belonging to Netherworld Sect’s Elder Hua Fei Chen. The rest were not Emperor Artifacts, but they were at least Dao Source Grade.

Netherworld Sect disciples started to Soul Feed their Netherworld Purgatory Banners when they joined the Sect. Therefore, these things were their Natal Artifacts, their lives tied together.

These things would be useless in the hands of others, but Gui Zu was an exception.

Although Yang Kai had no clue about Gui Zu’s Secret Art, he knew that it was definitely similar to the Secret Arts of the Netherworld Sect. Gui Zu’s original artifact was the Ten Thousand Soul Banner, which was also similar to these Netherworld Purgatory Banners.

Therefore, Yang Kai had been keeping these few Netherworld Purgatory Banners with him all this time, just waiting for the right moment to pass them to Gui Zu to help him to improve his strength.

Trembling, Gui Zu accepted the few Netherworld Purgatory Banners from Yang Kai’s hands. The Ghost Qi in Gui Zu surged on contact as the ghost fire in his eyes brightened significantly. Even though he hadn’t even refined them yet, he instinctively felt that these Netherworld Purgatory Banners would be of great use to him.

“Take these too,” Yang Kai took out a few jade slips and gave them to Gui Zu.

Gui Zu received and scanned them curiously with his Divine Sense, soon shouting in a thrilled voice, “Good, good, good. With these, this Old Master can break through to the Second-Order Dao Source Realm soon!”

The records in those jade slips were nothing else but information related to some Secret Arts and Secret Techniques of the Netherworld Sect, which were notably suitable for Gui Zu. With these records complementing the few Netherworld Purgatory Banners, Gui Zu’s strength could certainly soar in a short time.
