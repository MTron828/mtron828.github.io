“How can that be?” Liu Xian Yun asked, surprised.

“No idea!” Yang Kai was also confused, shaking his head, “Something’s not quite right with this Sealed World!”

He had never encountered World Energy that he could not absorb since he began cultivating. Something strange was mixed into the World Energy inside this Solitary Void Sealed World, and the more it was absorbed, the more damage it did to a cultivator. It would definitely ruin their meridians in the long run, causing them to lose their cultivation.

Fortunately, Yang Kai only cultivated for an hour before he stopped.

“What do we do now?” Liu Xian Yun was completely panicked. If they couldn’t absorb the World Energy here, then the two of them would run out of energy sooner or later. Not to mention finding the exit, they may never even get off the sea and would die of exhaustion in the end.

This situation was just like putting a whole table of delicious seafood in front of a hungry sailor, but it was actually poisonous. If they ate, they would die of poison, but if they didn’t, they would die of hunger...

“No matter, I have a solution,” Yang Kai wasn’t in too much panic and took out the Sealed World Bead, passing it to Liu Xian Yun. “Hold onto this. I’ll go in to recover for a moment.”

Saying so, he had already entered the Sealed World Bead.

Liu Xian Yun didn’t have the time to say anything before Yang Kai disappeared. She just looked at the Sealed World Bead in her hands, dumbfounded. Then, remembering the pavilion and that nice and quiet world, Liu Xian Yun seemed to have realized something and her pretty face could not help but fill with surprise.

A moment later, she quickly, but carefully put away the Sealed World Bead before putting her focus on steering the wooden boat, constantly moving forward while avoiding those waterspouts.

An hour later, Yang Kai reappeared, not looking as weak as he did earlier. He had a rosy complexion now and had clearly recovered his strength.

Liu Xian Yun did not say anything more, simply nodding at him and handing back the Sealed World Bead.

She was able to cultivate the Third-Order Origin King Realm in the Grand Desolation Star Field and had the prestige of being one of the strongest Masters there, so she was obviously a smart person and knew what to ask and what not to ask.

There was no doubt that Yang Kai entrusting the Sealed World Bead to her meant that he trusted her greatly. As for the mysteries of this Sealed World Bead, it was enough that she knew it in her heart.

Day by day, time passed.

Every two or three days, Yang Kai would enter the Sealed World Bead to recover and then come back out to steer the wooden boat.

During this period, Liu Xian Yun had also run out of Source Qi and had entered the Sealed World Bead twice, but she was very sensible and never asked any questions when she went in and out.

A month’s time passed in the blink of an eye, but Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun still never found any trace of land in this vast sea. The sea really seemed to be endless.

No matter how resolute Yang Kai was, he still could not help but feel a little impatient at this moment.

On this day, when Yang Kai returned from the Sealed World Bead, Liu Xian Yun called out to him with pleasant surprise in her voice, “Senior Brother, I think we’ve found something!”

“What is it?” Yang Kai was excited to hear this and quickly asked.

Liu Xian Yun pointed ahead, “Look, the waterspouts are appearing less and less frequently. The further we go, the rarer they become.”

Yang Kai focused his gaze and discovered that it was true. The number of waterspouts on the surface of the sea had decreased, and Yang Kai’s eyes could not help but brighten at this discovery.

Even though there was no sign of land yet, at least some changes could finally be seen in their surroundings.

Previously, Yang Kai was wondering if they were lost or if they were constantly going in circles, but now, it seemed that they were neither. The sea really was just extremely vast.

This discovery brightened up both Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun, and they sped forth on their wooden boat with even greater effort.

As time passed, the waterspouts around them were also growing smaller and smaller. Eventually, they disappeared completely. This gave Yang Kai the firm belief that he was flying in the right direction. If they kept going, then they might end up finding an unexpected harvest. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

After another three days, Yang Kai was in the middle of steering the wooden boat when his face suddenly changed and he focused his gaze as far as he could in a certain direction. In the next moment, he was overjoyed and patted Liu Xian Yun on the shoulder, “Junior Sister, there’s a ship ahead!”

Liu Xian Yun was meditating with closed eyes. She did not dare to cultivate here, so she quickly woke up when Yang Kai called out to her. Standing up, she looked in the direction Yang Kai was pointing and saw that there was in fact a small black dot on the horizon.

That little black dot was, amazingly, a large ship.

Liu Xian Yun could not help but get excited. Looking over at Yang Kai, she could see that he was overjoyed as well.

It had been more than a month since they came to this damned place and they had been wandering the sea this whole time when they finally spotted a ship. The joy that they felt simply could not be described in words.

A boat meant people, and if there were people, it meant they could ask where this place was and where they should head to.

Yang Kai quickly sped up the wooden ship and flew straight towards the large sea ship.

As they got closer and closer, the image of the ship also got clearer and clearer.

It was an impressively large sea ship and even a relatively high-grade artifact to boot. This was a great surprise to Yang Kai as the refinement of such a large artifact ship would inevitably require a lot of energy and finances. Who knows how the cultivators aboard actually managed to achieve it while living in this damned place.

When the wooden bloat flew over, the sentries on the sea ship obviously spotted them as well. Before waiting for Yang Kai to come close, a dozen people scrambled onto the deck, standing there in a disorderly manner. They seemed to be very curious about Yang Kai’s arrival and were constantly pointing and whispering about them.

It didn’t take long before Yang Kai arrived a short distance away from the ship. Looking over, whether it be men or women, he could see that all of them had sturdy auras and were staring at them with some vigilance.

But what surprised Yang Kai even more was the fact that most of these people were actually Dao Source Realm cultivators!

How did they manage to maintain their cultivation in this place? After all, the World Energy here couldn’t be absorbed, so there was no doubt that one’s cultivation would regress if one lived here for a long time.

Even though these dozen people did look a bit short of Source Qi, clearly because they had not been able to cultivate properly, they indeed managed to maintain their cultivations.

The leader of these people was a woman with a voluptuous body, curvy and well-endowed both on her front and her behind; however, her skin was slightly dark, likely due to her being out at sea all year long. This did not take away from her beauty in the slightest though and instead added a wild air to her.

She was standing there like a powerful leopard, looking at the newcomers with sharp eyes.

Yang Kai did not board the ship rashly and instead cupped his fists from nearby, calling out, “Friends, please. I do not know which way you’re heading, but do you mind bringing us along as well?”

The dozen or so people looked indifferent, only their leader raised her head slightly and asked bluntly, “Where are you from?”

Yang Kai pointed in a certain direction and said, “From there. Our ship was destroyed. Only the two of us managed to escape.”

This was, of course, a lie; however, Yang Kai did not want to reveal his background when they had just arrived.

“A shipwreck?” The woman’s face changed slightly. Though, she did not ask too much about it and just sighed lightly. It seemed like getting shipwrecked was common on this sea. Nodding, she said, “The two of you are quite lucky to have survived such a disaster. I can let you on board, but you know the rules, right?”

[Rules...?] Yang Kai’s heart jumped. This was the first group of people they’d encountered since coming here a month ago, so how would they know the rules?

But just as he was about to ask for guidance, the woman frowned and said, “Five thousand Source Crystals per person. Ten thousand for the two of you.”

“Yes yes! Of course!” Yang Kai quickly nodded, thinking that the rules were that they had to pay a boarding fee.

This rule was acceptable, but what surprised Yang Kai the most was the fact that the price of these tickets was way too cheap. It only cost five thousand Source Crystals per person.

As he said that, he touched the Space Ring on his finger, wanting to take out the Source Crystals.

When the woman saw his actions, she couldn’t help but frown and said, “You’re not thinking of giving me the Source Crystals here, right?”

Yang Kai looked at her, bewildered, “Is something the matter?”

Upon hearing this, the woman’s face instantly turned strange. She was eyeing him incessantly, and it wasn’t just her. The other cultivators standing on the deck also had amused looks on their faces.

[What’s going on?] Yang Kai frowned slightly. He was wondering in his heart, [Is there something wrong with giving her the Source Crystals here?]

Just as Yang Kai was feeling suspicious, the woman took out an Access Token. Reaching out and swaying it, an opening immediately split on the ship’s barrier and she said, “Come in first.”

“Many thanks!” Yang Kai held back the doubts in his heart and rushed in with his wooden boat.

With their feet on the deck, both Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun could not help but heave a sigh of relief. The feeling of standing on steady ground was simply wonderful.

“Come with me.” The woman waved her hand and led the way ahead.

Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun exchanged glances with each other before quickly catching up with her.

The cultivators on the deck also took the initiative to open up a path so the two could pass.

After walking for a short while, the woman suddenly asked, “How long have you been shipwrecked on the Solitary Void Sea?”

[So, it turns out this place is the Solitary Void Sea,] Yang Kai noted it silently in his heart. As for the other party’s question, he answered without hesitation, “It happened yesterday. Fortunately, we bumped into you, otherwise the consequences would have been unimaginable. Truly, many thanks to this Young Miss for taking us in.”

His aura was stable at the moment and it obviously seemed as if he did not consume much Source Qi. Telling her that the shipwreck happened yesterday would be the best answer.

“Is that so?” The corners of the woman’s mouth rose slightly, revealing an intriguing smile.

Yang Kai frowned. He thought to himself, [Could it be that this woman realized something? But I shouldn’t have revealed any hint...] Both he and Liu Xian Yun looked at each other, both a little confused.

As they talked, the woman led Yang Kai to a compartment. Opening the door, she went inside.

Yang Kai looked around. Even though the place was not big, the environment was not bad. The nice bit about the compartment was how quiet it was. Also, a Spirit Array seemed to have been set up here, but he had no idea what for.

“Will we be staying here?” Yang Kai asked.

The woman glanced at him and said indifferently, “Not so fast.”

Yang Kai’s face turned dark. [This woman really is strange, if they weren’t going to let them stay, then why bring them here?]
