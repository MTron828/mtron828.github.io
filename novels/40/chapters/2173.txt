Amidst the wind and snow, Yang Kai stood in place and waited for three hours before Liu Yan returned from the icy peak.

Seeing her mysterious look, Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling curious and asked, “What did you go there for?”

Liu Yan didn’t answer directly and instead called out, “Come out, don’t be afraid!”

The place she was looking at was empty, however.

Yang Kai was stunned, but he also knew that Liu Yan wouldn’t tease him pointlessly, so he watched carefully in anticipation.

Unfortunately, nothing happened, causing Liu Yan to helplessly sigh, “Master, please wait a moment, it seems to be a little timid, let me talk to it.”

After that, Liu Yan squatted down in the snow and pushed her Divine Sense, as if she was trying to communicate with someone or something.

After a long time without any response, Liu Yan became a little annoyed and her expression sank as she snapped coldly, “If you don’t come out, I’ll melt you!”

When these words fell, a small mound of snow puffed up, as if something was emerging from below.

Yang Kai couldn’t help staring in surprise.

A moment later, in a puff of flying snow, something suddenly shot out from the ground, turning into a stream of light, and began dancing about mid-air.

Although this thing was fast, Yang Kai could still see it clearly.

It actually turned out to be a palm-sized snowflake!

However, this snowflake was completely different from ordinary snowflakes. It seemed to have a certain spirituality and consciousness and it also gave off a kind of faint flame-like glow that disturbed the surrounding air.

“What is this?” Yang Kai’s eyes almost bulged as he asked in shock.

Liu Yan replied, “I can’t really explain it clearly, but it should be something similar to myself!”

As she spoke, she beckoned lightly to the snowflake, causing it to fly over and float gently in front of her, seemingly not daring to get too close.

Yang Kai looked at this snowflake with interest and soon discovered that there were some traces of facial features at its centre. These traces were blurry and undefined, but they were definitely present.

“An Innate World Spirit Treasure?” Yang Kai muttered in a low voice.

This snowflake was probably a kind of strange living creature that had evolved in the Realm of Winter over countless years. With its unique constitution, it was likely that no one else even knew it existed.

“En,” Liu Yan nodded, “But it is also a kind of ice flame! If it weren’t for that, I wouldn’t have been able to feel its existence.”

Hearing what she said, Yang Kai immediately understood.

Liu Yan herself was an Artifact Spirit who had devoured and refined numerous types of strange flames. This little snowflake seemed to be a type of strange flame itself, so there was a kind of resonance between it and Liu Yan...

However, because of their opposing hot and cold attributes, the little snowflake didn’t dare get too close to Liu Yan and even seemed extremely afraid of her.

“You brought it here... what for?” Yang Kai asked strangely.

Logically speaking, Liu Yan could just swallow this ice flame and be done with it. Although it was clearly an Ice Attribute flame, since its sentience had already formed, it would still have a good effect on Liu Yan’s growth.

However, she didn’t show any intention of swallowing it and instead brought it over to Yang Kai, which meant she didn’t plan on using it to improve her strength.

“It’s very familiar with this place, so it can help us find things!” Liu Yan smiled slightly.

“Oh! Great idea!” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up.

Liu Yan soon frowned, though, and said, “But... its sentience is quite limited and it takes a lot of effort to communicate with it, so I don’t know if it will be much help.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“It’s better than searching aimlessly like before,” Yang Kai grinned, “As for the effect, we’ll just have to try to know.”

Saying so, he turned a soft gaze to the little snowflake and gently asked, “Is there any good thing here? Can you take me to find it?”

The little snowflake seemed to not hear him and just floated quietly mid-air.

Yang Kai wore a slightly embarrassed look as he turned to ask Liu Yan, “Does it not understand?”

Liu Yan smiled lightly and said, “It has never met any other living creature, so how could it understand human words? You can only rely on Divine Sense to communicate with it.”

Saying so, Liu Yan pushed her Divine Sense towards the little snowflake.

The next moment, the other party seemed to understand something and with a flicker, it took off in a certain direction.

Yang Kai and Liu Yan exchanged a glance before they immediately followed.

Soon after, under the guidance of the little snowflake, Yang Kai and Liu Yan came to a mountain valley. The little snowflake stopped at a certain spot and began circling around.

“There should be something good here!” Liu Yan said.

“I’ll take a look.” Yang Kai already began moving, using his Source Qi to dig up the ice and snow.

After a stick of incense’ time, a huge pit appeared in front of Yang Kai and he jumped inside to search.

A moment later, he jumped out with a joyful smile on his face with a kind of jade-like spirit grass in his hand.

“Excellent!” Yang Kai smiled as he looked at the little snowflake approvingly, “This is really much better than blindly searching.”

As if understanding Yang Kai’s praise, the little snowflake flew around Yang Kai a few times quickly before landing on his shoulder, its fuzzy facial features showing a happy expression.

Seeing this situation, Yang Kai immediately understood that the other party’s thinking should be very simple; after all, being born in this Realm of Winter, it had very limited interactions with other creatures. In other words, it was a pure blank slate that had very limited experiences. If this wasn’t the case, how could it possibly be so happy with just a small compliment?

“Work hard, otherwise I’ll melt you!” Liu Yan added a threat at just the right time, her pretty face as cold as ice as she sent out an obvious murderous intent, causing the little snowflake to shiver in fright and hide behind Yang Kai, clinging to him as it only partially exposed itself to stare at Liu Yan timidly.

Yang Kai couldn’t help glancing over at Liu Yan, who spat out her little tongue at him, their eyes meeting as they silently communicated with each other.

After a while, Yang Kai rolled his eyes and said, “Let it help me find the most precious thing here, and if there are any good treasures along the way, inform us about them as well.”

Liu Yan nodded and used her Divine Sense to convey Yang Kai’s meaning.

The little snowflake received this order and rushed out immediately, leading the way.

With this kind of Innate World Spirit Treasure leading the way, Yang Kai really saved a lot of time and obtained many treasures. Now he didn’t need to search this frozen land blindly as in this snowy domain, no precious treasure could escape the detection of the little snowflake. As long as the little snowflake stopped somewhere, Yang Kai knew there was something good buried beneath the snow.

Along the way, Yang Kai added many Ice Attribute spirit grasses and medicines to his Space Ring, most of them Dao Source Grade with a few even reaching the Emperor Grade.

The special environment of the Realm of Winter provided excellent growth conditions for such spirit grasses and medicines, and also kept them concealed all these years until the little snowflake helped Yang Kai find them.

No matter what kind of herb it was that Yang Kai found, it had a medicinal age of at least ten thousand years!

Yang Kai benefited greatly!

And with more and more contact along the way, the little snowflake seemed to have gradually become familiar with Yang Kai and no longer acted as timid as it did in the beginning. It was like a newborn child, full of strong curiosity for creatures like Yang Kai, flying around him from time to time, observing him from every possible angle.

However... because Liu Yan continued to play the menacing character along the way, threatening it from time to time, the little snowflake naturally behaved itself and didn’t dare to approach within ten paces of her.

As a result, Yang Kai and Liu Yan had to separate a certain distance.

Although he had many gains, Yang Kai was a little disappointed that he did not obtain the Tribulation Fruit!

He had actually obtained several things rarer and more precious than the Tribulation Fruit, but he still lacked what he wanted most.

He also knew that this kind of thing couldn’t be rushed and he could only calm himself and continued the search.

A few days later, Yang Kai was greeted by a surprising scene.

Not far in front of him, there was a shimmering lake. This lake was only a couple of kilometres or so in diameter and was surrounded by high mountains, making it an extremely beautiful sight to behold.

What surprised him though was that this lake showed no signs of freezing.

Heavy snow, like goose feathers, still fell from the sky, but they all melted as soon as they touched the surface of the lake, as if the lake had some magical power that ensured it would never freeze over.

The surface of the water was so clear that Yang Kai even saw some strange fish swimming in the water below.

Judging from their big mouths and fangs alone, it seemed these fish weren’t good to provoke.

But once they arrived here, the little snowflake no longer advanced and instead kept flying around Yang Kai, seemingly trying to convey something to him.

After being together for so long, Yang Kai has also become able to interpret the little snowflake’s behaviour, so when he saw this, he asked thoughtfully, “You want to say, the most precious thing here is at the bottom of this lake?”

As soon as Yang Kai spoke these words, the little snowflake floated up and down, as if nodding.

Yang Kai nodded back and declared, “Then I’ll go take a look!”

“Master, be careful!” Liu Yan warned with concern.

Yang Kai nodded before flying up, arriving at the centre of the lake, glancing left and right, then diving into the water.

A cultivator like Yang Kai didn’t have to worry about his clothes getting wet from the lake water, just by pushing his Source Qi slightly, he could protect himself from both the water and the cold.

As the aura of a Dao Source Realm Master spread out, the fish scattered frantically.

Although the fish at the bottom of the lake looked quite terrifying, they didn’t have much real strength, so they didn’t dare to come close.

The little snowflake didn’t follow him, so Yang Kai could only explore on his own to find this so-called ‘most precious treasure’, starting with the centre of the lake before working his way outwards.

On the shore, Liu Yan watched quietly, her beautiful eyes fixed on Yang Kai, ready to support him at the slightest sign of trouble. As for the little snowflake, it floated a dozen meters away from Liu Yan as it too watched Yang Kai, some worry apparent on its fuzzy face as it flitted about uneasily from time to time.
