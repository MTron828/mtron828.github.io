The sky was blue and the earth was vast. Two figures stood mid-air, dazed and unable to respond. Needless to say, these two were none other than Yang Kai and Li Jiao who had experienced all kinds of hardships during their journey to this place. Yang Kai had torn open the space after that ball of light had led them to the exit of the Void Labyrinth, and they arrived in this place. However, what greeted them was so different from what they had imagined that they couldn’t help being stupefied for a while.

“Palace Master Yang, i-is this Dragon Island?” Li Jiao turned to look at Yang Kai with a look of astonishment.

“I don’t know either.” Yang Kai was also at a loss. He had assumed that they would arrive at Dragon Island after exiting the Void Labyrinth; however, at this moment, he was not sure if this place was Dragon Island because this place was not an island at all. It was a Sealed World!

Extending his senses out into the surroundings, he could tell that the World Principles in this Small Sealed World were complete, even more perfect than the Sealed World Bead in his possession. Lifting his head to look at the sky, he was amazed to see that it even had a scorching sun.

If somebody clueless to the situation were to see this place, they would have mistaken it as someplace in Star Boundary. Fortunately, Yang Kai was aware that this was not anywhere within Star Boundary. He had traversed many Small Sealed Worlds before, and even owned one, hence, he was extremely sensitive to these kinds of places.

This was a Small World, a perfect Small World. Furthermore, the World Energy here was impressive. It couldn’t be said to be extremely dense. After all, Star Boundary was vast with countless cultivation paradises, so which large Sect was not located in a beautiful spot that was rich in World Energy? This Small World might contain dense World Energy, but it was not much better than the cultivation paradises in Star Boundary.

The key point was its purity! The World Energy here was extremely pure, several times more so than any other World Energy Yang Kai had ever come into contact with before. A cultivation environment like that was extremely advantageous as the higher the purity of the World Energy, the faster and more easily one could absorb it. What cultivator would not thirst for that?

“We… Didn’t end up in the wrong place, right?” Li Jiao had an expression that indicated he did not know whether to laugh or cry.

“Why do you say that?” Yang Kai turned his head and looked at Li Jiao.

“How does this look like an island?!” Li Jiao was a little disappointed. In his imagination, Dragon Island was above all worldly considerations. It was an island isolated in the middle of the ocean with gigantic Dragons flying about and puffing out smoke. This place was also a paradise of sorts, but it was just too different from what he had imagined.

“Who stipulated that Dragon Island had to be an island?” Yang Kai countered rhetorically.

Li Jiao was stunned by those words before thinking to himself, [Fair enough.]

The name ‘Dragon Island’ had been passed down through the generations, so everyone assumed it was an actual island, but no one had ever entered Dragon Island nor spoken about what the island was like on the inside.

“In my opinion, this is probably Dragon Island,” Yang Kai took a deep breath. The pure World Energy in the air made him relax, physically and mentally. It felt as though even the pores in his body had expanded. Then, he broke into a grin, “It’s not just ‘probably’. This is definitely Dragon Island!”

What other place in this world could be better than the legendary Dragon Island? Yang Kai had been to many other cultivation paradises before, but nowhere else was comparable to this place.

Li Jiao nodded lightly and did not argue with Yang Kai on that point, “So, what should we do now?”

Yang Kai frowned and thought for a while before speaking, “Since we’re already here, we might as well enjoy ourselves. Let’s investigate this place first.”

“Sounds good!” Li Jiao nodded.

Afterwards, the two of them immediately flew off in the same direction. Both of them tried hard to conceal their auras to prevent revealing their whereabouts. Additionally, they neither flew too high nor too fast.

The Small World seemed to be rather large compared to the Revolving World they went to previously and while flying, they passed numerous mountains and rivers. However, they didn’t even see a single member of the Dragon Clan anywhere.

Although the numbers within the Dragon Clan were extremely low, as far as Yang Kai was aware, there should still be some of the Dragon Clan members living on Dragon Island. Thus, it made no sense that they couldn’t find a single trace of the Dragon Clan anywhere.

For that reason, he couldn’t help doubting whether his previous conjecture was wrong. [Could it be that this isn’t Dragon Island? Don’t tell me Li Jiao and I fell into a random Small World by accident. If that’s the case, things will get embarrassing…]

On the other hand, they ran into several Monster Beasts. Some were strong while some were weak. Moreover, many of the stronger Monster Beasts possessed some thin Dragon Clan bloodline. Their auras were terrifying, and they ran wild in the mountains and forests.

The appearance of these Monster Beasts with the Dragon Clan bloodline greatly increased Yang Kai’s confidence; even so, the True Dragon Clan was nowhere to be seen.

Two days later, a huge city suddenly appeared before them. The city was built on a huge plain and occupied almost one-third of the horizon. From a distance, the buildings in the city seemed densely packed with streets of varying sizes crisscrossing between them. Such a huge city could accommodate at least a million people.

Yang Kai and Li Jiao were instantly dumbstruck while at the same time, an inexplicable feeling surged in their hearts.

“Brother Li, is there a city on Dragon Island?”

Li Jiao smiled wryly, “I have never heard of a city on Dragon Island. However, the members of the Dragon Clan are so scarce, so why would they create such a large city?”

Yang Kai agreed with that sentiment. [The Dragon Clan has no reason to create such a large city. So, is this not Dragon Island after all?] At that thought, his expression turned grim. Two days ago, he had confidently declared to Li Jiao that this place was definitely Dragon Island. Who could have known that those words would slap him in the face two days later?

[But, what is this place if it isn’t Dragon Island?] Yang Kai mulled over it for a moment and said, “Let’s go take a look.”

They might as well take a look at the place regardless of where this was. Even so, they did not rush headlong into the city. They did not know where exactly this place was nor who exactly lived in this city. Therefore, they landed about a hundred kilometres away from the city, found a hidden spot to hide, and prepared to observe the situation for a while.

Upon a closer inspection, they saw many people actively going about their day inside the city. Even if the number of people in the city did not amount to a million, there were at least several hundreds of thousands of them here. This discovery made Yang Kai and Li Jiao even more disappointed. [This really isn’t Dragon Island… Otherwise, there wouldn’t be so many people here!]

“Somebody is coming!” Yang Kai shouted suddenly, staring intently at something.

The moment Li Jiao heard that, he hurriedly turned his gaze in that direction and saw several figures rushing in their direction. Soon, those people flew over the two of them, seemingly heading for the city.

After they passed by, Li Jiao muttered, “Those were Humans in the Dao Source Realm.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly at those words. Those were Humans indeed. Moreover, their cultivation was neither high nor low. People like them were everywhere in the outside world; it was nothing special.

Not long after those people left, another group of people flew towards the city. This time around, Yang Kai and Li Jiao discovered a strange phenomenon. The leading figure among this group was a person with a Dragon Clan bloodline.

He was a man with a First-Order Emperor Realm cultivation and had several Dragon Scales on his face. Apart from that, he did not show any other Dragon Clan like characteristics. Even so, this discovery astonished Yang Kai and Li Jiao greatly.

This man’s situation was very similar to Li Jiao’s. He was probably a Dragonborn with an impure bloodline. In fact, the purity of his bloodline was even lower than Li Jiao’s.

Yang Kai frowned slightly, feeling there was something unusual here.

For the next half a day, the two of them did not move from that spot. A figure or two would fly over their heads from time to time, heading straight towards the city.

The more they observed, the larger the shock and doubt in their hearts grew. This couldn’t be helped though as it was frightening just how many Dragonborn were in this place. At least a hundred people flew over their heads during the time they spent observing and a full ten had Dragon Clan bloodlines. That was a ratio of ten to one, which would have been impossible anywhere else in the Star Boundary but Dragon Island.

Dragonborn could be found in the Star Boundary of course, but there were not many of them. However, in this damned place, one out of every ten was a Dragonborn. If Yang Kai had not seen this ratio for himself, he would never have believed it.

The cultivations of these Dragonborn were uneven; some were high and some were low. The lowest was only in the Origin King Realm while the higher ones were in the Emperor Realm. The distinct Dragon Clan characteristics that they displayed varied too. Some had a short Dragon Horn on their heads, some had Dragon Tails behind them, some had nondescript Dragon Claws while most of them had a few Dragon Scales on their bodies. Naturally, the Dragon Clan characteristics that they had were completely incomparable to that of the true members of the Dragon Clan. The Dragon Scales they had were not so much Dragon Scales as they were more like snake scales.

Aside from Humans and Dragonborn, there were members of the Monster Race thrown into the mix too.

“Palace Master Yang, what’s going on? Why are there so many Dragonborn here?” Li Jiao couldn’t remain calm any longer.

“Do I look like I know the answer to your questions?” Yang Kai gave Li Jiao a sideways look.

Li Jiao laughed awkwardly. He had only been asking in passing. It was just that what they had seen over the past half a day was too startling.

“It’ll be easy to get down to the bottom of this matter. We’ll know once we go inside, right?” Yang Kai pointed out while looking in the direction of the city.

Li Jiao was silent for a while, then he nodded in agreement.

After observing for so long, they discovered that the city’s defences were very lax. Nobody would bat an eyelid at them even if they rushed straight into the city. Moreover, there were no gatekeepers asking them questions or collecting any kind of entrance toll. In other words, Yang Kai and Li Jiao could literally just walk in.

Upon discussing their plans, they immediately rushed out from their hiding spot and flew towards the city. They soon closed the distance of one hundred kilometres and imitated how the people from before had acted. Landing some distance away, they walked into the city on foot.

When they arrived at the city gate, Yang Kai looked up and saw three characters drawn across the city gate in a showy fashion. He was stunned by those words. Similarly, Li Jiao also seemed shocked. Those three characters drawn across the city gate in such showy fashion read ‘Half-Dragon City’!

The two looked at each other and saw the surprised look in each other’s eyes. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

A lifelike gigantic Dragon carving sat on the city gates. At first glance, this Dragon seemed to be alive, lunging forward at them with fangs bared. It made Li Jiao pale slightly at the sight and he couldn’t help walking a little faster.

When they entered the city, the two were shocked again. They had long speculated that this city housed a large population, but the size of the population exceeded their expectations. The people coming and going in the city were so numerous that they looked like a school of silver carps moving down a stream. There were shops and stalls in every direction, and they were surrounded by a cacophony of everyday noises like people shouting and bargaining. Moreover, there were beings from the different races, Humans, Monsters and Dragonborn, mixed into the crowd.

Humans numbered the most among them, making up nearly half of the population. Next came the Monster Race that, although lesser in number than the Humans, were not far behind. Last came the Dragonborn who were the rarest.

[What is going on!?] Both Yang Kai and Li Jiao were a little confused.
