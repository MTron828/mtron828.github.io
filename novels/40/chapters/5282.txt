No Human could come out of the combined attacks of three Territory Lords’ Soul Secret Techniques unscathed; moreover, something strange had happened to the Human all of a sudden. His Soul suddenly became extremely weak. In such a state, even one of the Humans’ Old Ancestors could not hope to be able to withstand their combined attacks.

“Those foolish Humans really don’t learn their lessons!” The Territory Lord whose Soul Avatar had morphed into the form of an eyeball coldly snorted. After saying that, he suddenly turned to look at one of his companions in realization, wondering, “What happened to you?”

The companion next to him was the one whose Soul Avatar was in the form of a blob of flowing water. At the moment, a very unusual aura could be felt from the Territory Lord’s Soul Avatar. It was as if he was desperately trying to hold his form but was being met with great resistance. His shape was constantly changing and his aura was fluctuating wildly.

This anomaly soon attracted the attention of the other Territory Lords who turned their attention to him.

It was then the fluid-like Territory Lord finally seemed to be able to gather a shred of his strength and spread out his voice, “Save… Save me!”

As soon as he said that, a violent wave of energy exploded inside of his fluid-like body, causing him to howl miserably in pain, and his shape, which had been unstable to begin with, wavered even more.

The other 5 Territory Lords were shocked and they all gathered together quickly. They were surprised to find that a needle-like object had suddenly appeared inside the fluid Territory Lord’s Soul Avatar. It appeared to be some kind of artifact with something like a Soul inside of it, and it was constantly piercing deeper and deeper into the Territory Lord’s Soul Avatar, shredding everything in its path.

The Territory Lords could see the viciousness of this artifact at a glance. If the needle-like artifact was truly allowed to destroy their companion’s Soul Avatar, then even if his body survived, he would lose his Soul and become a walking corpse.

Not to mention the fact that the long needle was still tearing apart his Soul Avatar, causing him to suffer from unimaginable pain. If he could not stop the encroachment of this artifact, then it would be difficult to say whether he could survive or not.

“A Soul-type artifact!” The ape Territory Lord shouted in a deep voice. He also had some Black Ink Disciple subordinates, so he was naturally no stranger to Soul-type artifacts.

Most of the Open Heaven Realm Humans who came to stir up trouble previously had their own Soul-type artifacts which were indeed powerful when activated, but they were still unable to stop their combined attacks.

However, the Soul-type artifact that they were seeing now seemed different. It was far more malevolent than anything they had ever seen before.

Could this be that Human’s trump card?

They had not even noticed when the Human activated this artifact, but obviously, it must have been when things turned chaotic earlier. And, adding to the artifact’s stealthiness, nobody noticed it.

“Resist it! I’ll help you!” The ape Territory Lord shouted and his Spiritual Energy surged.

Not only him, but the other Territory Lords also did the same so that they could help their companion withstand the encroachment of the long needle.

It was then that a familiar aura appeared in the strange space. It was that Human who was screaming so miserably earlier.

He wasn’t dead!

Not only was he not dead, he actually came back at them.

However, he was in the same condition, as the Territory Lords had guessed. He was heavily injured, and his Soul Avatar was also much dimmer compared to before. Even his aura seemed very unstable, strong at times, but weak at others.

“This reckless fool, I’ll deal with him!” The eyeball Territory Lord bellowed, turned around, and charged at Yang Kai.

At the same time, Yang Kai also charged towards him. Halfway there, Spiritual Energy flashed again and another miserable cry rang out.

“Ahhh…”

If one regarded death as their ultimate home, they would not fear charging ahead even when facing ten thousand enemies!

The eyeball Territory Lord was stunned. This scene… was familiar. Just now, this Human had also rushed at them while screaming, and now he was doing it again?

When he thought about what his companion experienced, he immediately raised his guard. One by one, rays of light condensed within the eyeball, each containing a powerful Soul Attack, which turned into a large net that was thrown over Yang Kai.

Yang Kai did not dodge it as his Soul Avatar’s aura weakened rapidly. Opening his mouth, he simply spat out a stream of light.

Even though the eyeball Territory Lord was extremely wary, he was still unable to defend against this bolt of light. As soon as the ray of light appeared, it broke through his net and shot straight into his Soul Avatar.

In the next instant, the net also enveloped Yang Kai and contracted abruptly. Yang Kai’s body turned into glowing wisps of light that disappeared into thin air.

The eyeball Territory Lord did not feel any joy at having won, however. It just hovered in mid-air as if it had been caught under a binding technique, unable to move.

The other Territory Lords who were helping their companion defend against the needle artifact suddenly felt a wave of unease.

As they watched on, the eyeball swivelled to the side and Divine Sense surged. A voice was transmitted to all directions, “Hel… Help!”

The four unharmed Territory Lords wanted to curse…

At the same time, Ou Yang Lie was looking at Yang Kai in disbelief inside the Black Ink Nest.

Soon after Yang Kai connected to the Black Ink Nest, he discovered that Yang Kai’s Soul had suddenly weakened, which was apparently due to sustaining injuries.

Ou Yang Lie couldn’t help but click his tongue as he had already warned this brat to be careful. He told him early on that there were Territory Lords lying in ambush inside of the strange space, but it seemed now that his words had fallen on deaf ears.

Now things were bad. Even though he had no idea what had happened, Ou Yang Lie was still sure that Yang Kai had been beaten up by the Territory Lords after rushing into that space from the changes in his Soul.

Ou Yang Lie silently prepared some Spirit Pills for Yang Kai to heal his wounds once he withdrew; however, despite receiving such injuries to his Soul, Yang Kai showed no intention of retreating. Immediately after, his Soul, which had already weakened considerably, withered dramatically again.

Ou Yang Lie jumped in shock.

Things were really bad now. Yang Kai’s Soul had already shown signs of weakness from suffering severe injuries, but now that he weakened again, he was likely not far from death.

If it were possible, Ou Yang Lie would have wanted to forcibly pull Yang Kai from that strange space, but even he was powerless to do anything in this situation. He could only hope that Yang Kai escaped sooner rather than later, only then would he be able to ensure his survival.

Ou Yang Lie even had doubts as to whether Yang Kai would be able to return alive or not this time. It would also be difficult for him to suffer no consequences in the future. Even if he did not become completely brain-dead, his cultivation might still regress from the Seventh Order.

Just as he was on edge, Yang Kai suddenly came back to his senses with a jolt.

Ou Yang Lie asked anxiously, “How was it?”

When he heard his voice, Yang Kai turned to look at him out of instinct with a dazed look in his eyes.

Ou Yang Lie knew right away that there was trouble. Yang Kai’s hollow gaze was a clear sign of his Soul falling unstable.

He was done for!

However, before he could speak, Yang Kai suddenly crouched down and held his head, screaming, “Ahhhh….”

The scream was so miserable that it broke the hearts of those who heard it and made them shed tears.

Ou Yang Lie felt goosebumps rising on his skin, not for any other reason than for the fact that Yang Kai’s screams reminded him of his own experiences of when his Soul was injured back when he was young.

It was because he had a similar experience that he knew just how much it hurt.

It was not something that anyone could just endure, regardless of how strong they were. It could be said that there was nobody that could withstand such pain!

For a moment, Ou Yang Lie was at a loss as to what to do.

Yang Kai had already begun rolling on the ground.

Ou Yang Lie stepped forward and tried to restrict Yang Kai’s movements with his World Force, then he stuffed all the Spirit Pills he prepared into Yang Kai’s mouth and helped him swallow them before refining them.

The entire process was a mess. Ou Yang Lie had no idea how he was supposed to report this to the Old Ancestor once they returned. It was fine if it were just an ordinary Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, but this was Yang Kai.

Even though Purifying Light was no longer the only means that the Humans had to resist Black Ink Strength, Yang Kai was still needed to arrange Universe Arrays. If anything were to happen to him, that would be a terrible loss for the Human Race.

However, some results did seem to have been spawned from his efforts. Yang Kai’s screams gradually calmed down, but his body was still curled up and twitching from time to time. His entire body was covered in sweat.

Ou Yang Lie stood up with a grave expression.

There was currently nothing that he could do in this situation but report to the higher-ups and see whether the Old Ancestor had any method of bringing Yang Kai back at the brink of death.

After transmitting a message to the outside, it wasn’t long before Gong Lian entered. When he saw the injured Yang Kai, he asked in surprise, “What happened to Brother Yang?”

Ou Yang Lie quickly said, “He connected to the Black Ink Nest and was ambushed by the Territory Lords, injuring his Soul. Look after him, I’m going to report to the Old Ancestor.”

This was a serious matter, so even Ou Yang Lie did not dare to handle it carelessly. Passing through the Space Array at once, he returned to Great Evolution Pass.

Ou Yang Lie arrived at the Old Ancestor’s residence, but there was no sign of her there. When he finally gave his report, the Old Ancestor only gave him one answer.

[Just wait and see!]

Yang Kai was already in this state, yet they were just going to wait and see?

If anyone else had said this, Ou Yang Lie would have definitely spat on their face, but these words came from the Old Ancestor, so he did not dare to disrespect her. He could only speculate that perhaps things truly were not as bad as he expected.

After returning to the universe fragment where the Black Ink Nest was located and heading into the Black Ink Nest, what he saw was mystifying.

Yang Kai was now seated cross-legged, meditating. Under Ou Yang Lie’s perception, even though Yang Kai’s Soul was incredibly weak, it seemed to have stabilized.

“What’s going on?” Ou Yang Lie asked his Disciple.

Gong Lian was also flabbergasted and shook his head, “I have no idea. Not long after Honoured Master left, Brother Yang suddenly crawled up, and it has been like this since.”

Ou Yang Lie was scratching his head in puzzlement. How could Yang Kai still meditate and recover on his own after his Soul was so injured?

It seemed like things were not as bad as they thought they were. The Old Ancestor must have known something, but since she did not explain, he did not dare to ask.

For now, he would just wait and see just as the Old Ancestor said!

Immediately, Ou Yang Lie had the Black Ink Nest sealed off to prevent anyone from entering; then, every few days, he would personally come over to check on Yang Kai’s condition.

As time passed, Ou Yang Lie’s astonishment deepened.

That was because Yang Kai’s condition would actually improve upon each visit. Even though the recovery speed was not fast, he was indeed getting better.

It was simply unbelievable. Ordinarily, Soul injuries like those sustained by Yang Kai were irreversible. No matter how one tried to fix them, it was still impossible for one to return to their peak after being wounded so grievously. Being able to keep one’s life was already incredible.

However, from the situation now, it seemed like Yang Kai was well on the road to a full recovery.

After a year had passed, when Ou Yang Lie came to check on him again, Yang Kai’s recovery speed increased noticeably. It was because of his visits every few days that he knew better than anyone what the situation of Yang Kai’s recovery was.
