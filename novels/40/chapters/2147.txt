As this huge phantom manifested, it slowly raised its head and glanced up at the surging World Energy that had gathered in the sky.

Suddenly, this female figure opened her mouth and inhaled sharply.

A staggering scene unfolded before Yang Kai’s eyes in the next instant. As this phantom inhaled, all the World Energy which was supposed to fall upon Zhang Ruo Xi as her baptism was sucked into the phantom figure’s mouth and disappeared!

After finishing this, the phantom woman lowered her head, transformed into a stream of light, and sank back into Zhang Ruo Xi’s body, like she had never even existed.

But before this phantom left, Yang Kai faintly felt that she had glanced over at him.

Even if their eyes hadn’t met though, and it only lasted for a moment, Yang Kai was terribly frightened by the humble feeling which overcame him.

“What...” Liu Yan’s voice trembled a little. Although the frightening phantom woman had disappeared, the fear left in her heart did not abate, making her tremble all over.

Yang Kai shook his head dumbly.

*Hong...*

A halo of energy suddenly exploded from Zhang Ruo Xi’s body and rushed out into the surroundings.

After the phantom was retracted into her body, Zhang Ruo Xi actually broke through directly to the Origin Returning Realm without any obstruction, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

Yang Kai was completely dumbfounded.

Whether it was Zhang Ruo Xi who directly condensed her own Shi before her breakthrough, or the appearance of the strange phantom woman, or her sudden breakthrough, everything he just witnessed was far beyond his ability to comprehend.

It was as if he just witnessed a fantastical dream!

At this moment, only one thought lingered in his mind though, [Just what kind of Bloodline Power did Zhang Ruo Xi inherit? Was that massive female phantom a projection of the Zhang Family’s Ancestor?]

“Master, I want to return first,” Liu Yan suddenly said.

Yang Kai glanced at her and found that her condition was a bit unsteady and nodded, bringing her back into the Sealed World Bead.

As for Zhang Ruo Xi, who was now an Origin Returning Realm cultivator, she showed no signs of stopping her cultivation as she continued to madly devour the surrounding World Energy, her delicate body acting like a bottomless pit that was able to absorb an infinite amount of energy.

The Sealed World Bead also continued its absorption of the surrounding World Energy, and soon the Spirit Qi Sea at the bottom of the canyon became thin.

One day later, the canyon which had originally been filled with a fog of World Energy was completely clear. The Spirit Qi Sea had disappeared and the canyon had become the same as the rest of the Four Seasons Realm.

Only now did Zhang Ruo Xi let out a light breath and slowly open her eyes.

She seemed to be ignorant of the changes that had taken place to her and slightly frowned after opening her eyes, spreading her hands out in front of herself as she lightly stretched.

After a while, she recovered and realized that someone was staring at her, so she looked up only to meet Yang Kai’s eyes.

“Sir!” Zhang Ruo Xi stood up and exclaimed softly.

“Congratulations, you have successfully made a breakthrough to the Origin Returning Realm,” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

Zhang Ruo Xi pursed her lips and muttered, “I don’t know what happened, it was like I just fell asleep and suddenly became like this.”

“Fell asleep?” Yang Kai raised his brow, “So, you don’t recall anything about what happened just now?”

Zhang Ruo Xi looked around and asked in amazement, “What happened?”

She turned her head to the side and looked around and quickly discovered two shrivelled corpses, causing her to pale and let out a cry of fright, “Did someone attack us?”

Yang Kai smiled bitterly and shook his head, not knowing how to explain the unusual scenes he had witnessed and instead choosing to say, “It was just a few blind fools who came here courting death.”

But Zhang Ruo Xi reacting like this made him have some guesses.

There were rumours that some powerful Monster Beasts, especially Divine Spirits and their descendants, had incredible strength from birth, and that their strength would grow even if they did not put in much work as long as they had enough accumulation over a long period of time. This was primarily because their Bloodlines would slowly awaken, allowing them to ultimately stand at the top of the world.

Zhang Ruo Xi’s situation must be somewhat similar to those Monster Beasts and Divine Spirits, otherwise, there was no way to explain why her strength improved so dramatically in just two short days without her even noticing how.

Considering all this, Yang Kai asked, “Ruo Xi, did someone explain to you how to break through to the Origin Returning Realm and how to condense your Shi?”

“No,” Zhang Ruo Xi shook her head, “When Ruo Xi was still living at home, Ruo Xi’s strength was still very low and Old Ancestor said that he would explain everything once Ruo Xi became a Third-Order Saint King...”

Yang Kai nodded when he heard these words, remembering that he too had never told Zhang Ruo Xi about these things.

The breakthrough to the Origin Returning Realm wasn’t too critical a junction, so even if no one explained anything, a cultivator would slowly be able to figure things out for themselves.

However, condensing one’s Shi was not something that could be understood or completed in short order, but Zhang Ruo Xi had actually done so in an instant!

In other words, the method to condense her Shi had long ago been rooted in her sub-conscience, probably an inheritance of her Bloodline.

“Sir, is there something wrong with Ruo Xi’s cultivation?” Zhang Ruo Xi asked anxiously.

“There is not,” Yang Kai shook his head quickly to prevent her from misunderstanding. After thinking for a moment, he added, “You’ve just experienced a breakthrough, so what is most important now is to consolidate your cultivation, go back to the Sealed World Bead for now.”

“Yes!” Zhang Ruo Xi nodded meekly and relaxed, allowing Yang Kai to send her back into the Sealed World Bead.

Standing there, Yang Kai was immersed in his thoughts and confusion for a while. He hadn’t asked Zhang Ruo Xi about the situation with the giant female phantom because she probably didn’t know anything about it either.

A few moments later, he turned his head to look to the side where a stream of light was quickly approaching.

Shortly, Hua Qing Si appeared in front of him with a happy disposition, obviously having had a good harvest.

“What happened?” Hua Qing Si asked in shock when she saw the two mummified corpses on the ground.

“Someone came courting death,” Yang Kai curtly replied without explaining much. He did not ask what she had gained; after all, he had already promised that anything she picked up would belong to her. Instead, he simply said, “You can go back first, I still have to rush to the Realm of Winter.”

“Wait a moment!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“What?”

Hua Qing Si smiled and said, “I suddenly remembered something on the way back.”

Yang Kai didn’t reply but motioned with his eyes for her to continue.

“There is a hidden spot in the Two Seasons Mountain Range, are you interested in exploring it?” Hua Qing Si asked with a smile.

“How do you know?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

Hua Qing Si answered, “I am a disciple of Star Soul Palace! If nothing had happened, I would have had one of the forty slots the palace obtained for myself! I made preparations for the Four Seasons Realm a long time ago, so what’s so strange about my knowing a secret or two?”

“The Two Seasons Mountain Range?” Yang Kai showed a contemplative expression.

“Rest assured, although I don’t know what you have to do in the Realm of Winter, you’ll have to cross the mountain range first, so it won’t take much time.”

“Do you have an exact location?” Yang Kai asked.

Hua Qing Si couldn’t help rolling her eyes and retort, “I found out about this hidden location from clues leftover in my Sect’s ancient books. Although I have a map of sorts, the exact directions aren’t very clear. At best I have a rough understanding of where this place might be. If you really want to explore it, you’ll have to find it yourself.”

“So, you don’t even know what’s inside?” Yang Kai asked.

Hua Qing Si showed a stunned expression before she pursed her lips into a grin and said, “It looks like you don’t know much about this Four Seasons Realm!”

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai frowned.

Hua Qing Si chuckled and asked, “You know this is the Four Seasons Realm, but do you know who made it?”

“Do you know?” Yang Kai frowned.

Hua Qing Si proudly said, “If I said I don’t know, what could you do?”

Yang Kai suddenly grinned and said, “Tell me!”

Seeing him jump straight to threatening her, Hua Qing Si couldn’t help pouting as she snorted, “Flowing Time Great Emperor, have you heard of him?”

Yang Kai shook his head.

Hua Qing Si’s expression became haughty as she continued, “Since ancient times, those who have been eligible to be called Great Emperor were all top masters in this world, but even among the top, there are still some who stand out! From all the historical records I have read, there have been several dozen Great Emperors who have fallen in the past, and the Flowing Time Great Emperor is one of them. The Flowing Time Great Emperor cultivated a Divine Ability called the Time Flies Seal. Once this Divine Ability is used, it can cause a thousand years to pass by in a moment, causing anything and anyone caught in it to wither and die!

“How did such a powerful Great Emperor die? No one knows, but there are rumours... This Four Seasons Realm was his secluded realm, and it was constructed by the Flowing Time Great Emperor using his miraculous abilities. There are also rumours that somewhere in the Four Seasons Realm, there is a majestic temple called the Flowing Time Temple, which was left behind by the Flowing Time Great Emperor and was originally his secluded home. There are infinite benefits to be found inside such a secluded home and if one can obtain even just one or two things from it, their future progress will be smooth and unimpeded. Such rumours are widely known among the great forces, but unfortunately, no one has been able to confirm them so far. There are only some vague records that indicate that the secret location I told you about is related to the Flowing Time Temple!”

As she narrated triumphantly, it really aroused Yang Kai’s interest.

“But if you find it too bothersome to search, then just pretend you didn’t hear anything,” Hua Qing Si intentionally teased Yang Kai’s desires.

Yang Kai decisively held out a hand to her.

“What do you want?” Hua Qing Si asked vigilantly.

“Bring out the map!”

Hua Qing Si immediately covered her Space Ring and jumped back a few steps before gritting her teeth and vigilantly glaring, “I warn you, if you dare try to force me, I’ll...”

“What will you do?” Yang Kai approached her with a wicked grin and said, “There’s no one here, so even if you shout your lungs out, no one will come to save you. Besides... all I need is a thought and you would obediently offer that map to me!”

“Shameless! Beast! Don’t come near... come here and I’ll scream... good, good, I’ll just give it to you,” Hua Qing Si took out a piece of animal skin from her Space Ring and threw it to Yang Kai before angrily cursing, “Are you having fun? A big man bullying me, a weak woman, have you no shame?”

Yang Kai ignored her and just looked at the crudely drawn map on the animal skin, finding it just as Hua Qing Si had said, lacking in clues or exact directions.
