“From now on, you will be able to come and go here as you please,” Qiu Ze declared.

Shi Cang Ying was overjoyed at his words. He knew that Qiu Ze was now finally treating him as Thousand Leaves Sect’s Sect Master, under the premise that he bowed down to him. If he dared to have any ideas, however, Shi Cang Ying would definitely die a miserable death.

Qiu Ze’s advancement to the Emperor Realm was not good news for any nearby Sect, but for Shi Cang Ying, the most important thing was to ensure his life first.

The Sect Master of Sky Peak Temple and the others standing behind Qiu Ze had hearts filled with fear. This was the authority an Emperor Realm Master possessed. Just by standing there, his pressure was great enough that the others didn’t even dare to breathe too loudly.

The Sect Masters all felt angry inside. Why was it not them who advanced to the Emperor Realm? It just had to be that old dog Qiu Ze.

At this moment, an old man suddenly rushed over, stopping behind Qiu Ze and cupping his fists, “Palace Master, Ye Hen is unwilling to reveal the way into the mountain valley.”

Before Qiu Ze had even spoken, Ruan Hong Bo from Sky Peak Temple began cursing, “Ye Hen, that old bastard really doesn’t know how to appreciate kindness. Palace Lord Qiu was kind enough not to ask for his life, but he’s still being so stubborn.”

Mu Guan of White Clouds Tower also chimed in, “Indeed. Since Ye Hen refuses the toast, then he must drink the loss. Palace Lord Qiu needn’t be polite with him anymore. If we all act together, I don’t believe we won’t be able to break the Spirit Array of this mountain valley!”

As he spoke, he put on an eager pose to begin.

Qiu Ze blunt rebuked, “Do you know how long Thousand Leaves Sect has inherited these lands? Even some of the top Sects in the Southern Territory have not been around as long as Thousand Leaves Sect. The Spirit Array in this mountain valley was personally set up by Grandmasters over ten thousand years ago. Even this King does not have confidence he can break it, yet the few of you believe you have such capability?”

He had a derisive look on his face, but Mu Guan and the others did not dare retort and could only laugh in embarrassment.

“What do you think, Sect Master Shi?” Qiu Ze turned to Shi Cang Ying and asked.

Shi Cang Ying pondered for a moment before he quickly said, “Ye Hen is a hard-headed man. This Shi has worked with him for many years so this Shi can say that he understands his temperament and character well. Not to mention torturing him, even if you really killed him, he would never reveal the way to break this array!”

“Oh? Sect Master Shi’s opinion of Ye Hen is so high?” Qiu Ze looked a little surprised at Shi Cang Ying.

Shi Cang Ying replied seriously, “He is nothing more than a stubborn old goat. If not for that, my Thousand Leaves Sect would not have been in a constant decline...”

“Enough, this King is not interested in the affairs of your Thousand Leaves Sect, you just need to tell me how to destroy the array,” Qiu Ze interrupted him impatiently.

Shi Cang Ying responded, “Since there is nothing we can do directly with Ye Hen, then we may as well try to find a breakthrough point from the people at his side...” When he spoke up to this point, he put on a sly smile and continued, “Ye Hen has only had his daughter for many years, and their relationship is much better than your average father and daughter.”

Upon hearing this, Qiu Ze turned to look at him, a profound glow in his eyes.

Shi Cang Ying’s heart jumped. He thought he had said something wrong and was covered in cold sweat from the look he was given. Just as he was starting to get uneasy, Qiu Ze suddenly laughed, “Sect Master Shi. I believe you watched Ye Jing Han grow up as well, didn’t you? Do you feel no pity for her at all?”

Shi Cang Ying’s expression turned solemn, “That little girl does not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth. If she dares stand in the way of Palace Lord Qiu’s great unification efforts, she must naturally pay the price. It is precisely because this Shi is her Elder that he wishes for her to mature early. This can also be considered a test of her inner temperament.”

“So to say, you are doing this for her sake?” Qiu Ze’s lips curved up into a derisive smile.

Shi Cang Ying responded resolutely, “This Shi hopes she can understand this Shi’s efforts.”

Ruan Hong Bo and the others standing to the side were all covered in cold sweat as they listened to their conversation, all throwing frequent glances at Shi Cang Ying. It seemed as if they did not realize Shi Cang Ying’s true nature until this moment, and at the same time, felt pity for Ye Hen to have raised such a monster by his side. But on second thought, they and Thousand Leaves Sect were now foes rather than friends. They were simply in no position to sympathize with them, nor did they see a need to.

“Good, this King will leave this matter in your hands. I trust Sect Master Shi won’t disappoint this King!”

“This Shi will give his utmost in this matter!” Shi Cang Ying cupped his fists and answered quickly before turning back and beckoning, “Bring them over!”

In the blink of an eye, Ye Hen and several high-level Sect members who followed him were brought to the entrance to the mountain valley. Naturally, they began hurling insults at Shi Cang Ying as soon as they got here, their eyes bloodshot and wanting nothing more than to bite Shi Cang Ying to death. But Shi Cang Ying was completely unfazed. He stood there calmly as if he didn’t hear anything they said and yelled into the mountain valley, “Martial Niece Ye, open your eyes and take a good look at who I have beside me!”

His voice spread loud and clear in all directions, and apparently reached deep into the mountain valley.

Soon after his words came out, the scenery in the mountain valley suddenly changed. In a blink of an eye, the Illusion Array which had been maintained for ten thousand years was lifted, and the true scenery of the mountain valley was revealed to the crowd.

Looking over, the figures of Ye Jing Han, Chi Yue, and the others could clearly be seen. They stood only several thousand metres away from Shi Cang Ying and them. Then right behind them was an array base platform.

“Hm?” Qiu Ze’s eyes narrowed as he stared at the array base platform for a moment before he exclaimed, “A Space Array?”

Naturally, with his eyesight, he was able to see that the array base platform was that of a Space Array, and a very old one at that. However, what he couldn’t understand was why such a thing would appear in this mountain valley.

[Where does this Space Array connect to?]

Qiu Ze could not help but look towards Shi Cang Ying with suspicion.

Shi Cang Ying also stared in confusion. Even though he knew that the mountain valley was a Restricted Area of Thousand Leaves Sect, one only the Sect Masters were able to step foot inside, he had no idea what was hidden here.

He always thought that this Restricted Area was where the Sect Masters of Thousand Leaves Sect were buried, and that was why no one was allowed to enter, but now it seemed his guesses were wrong.

This Restricted Area seemed to be connected with some other place.

Noticing Qiu Ze’s gaze, Shi Cang Ying laughed embarrassedly, “This Shi is also seeing this for the first time. This Shi had no idea what mysteries were hidden inside.”

Qiu Ze coldly snorted, clearly very displeased with this answer, but he still said without much concern, “That Space Array is likely damaged, otherwise they would have long escaped from here.”

Shi Cang Ying hurriedly said, “Palace Lord Qiu’s vision is truly sharp to have already thought of this!”

While the two were talking, Ye Jing Han had already seen the sight outside of the mountain valley, and Ye Hen who was forced to kneel on the ground. Ye Hen’s body was covered in blood at this moment and his aura had waned to a miserable degree. His cultivation also seemed to be sealed off so he had no power to resist at all.

Ye Hen was old to begin with, so being tortured now just made things worse. The way he was coughing up blood incessantly was unbearable to watch.

“Father!” Ye Jing Han cried out in a trembling voice as tears flowed down her cheeks. Her heart was aching so much she could hardly breathe.

When Hua Qing Si and the others saw this scene, their faces had all become very ugly to look at and they felt a deep sense of pity for this young girl.

After Ye Jing Han shouted, she glared at Shi Cang Ying, “Let my father go!”

Shi Cang Ying smirked, “Martial Niece, you are a big girl now so Martial Uncle will not waste any words with you. I can let your father go, but you should know what you have to do for that to happen.”

Then, speaking up to this point, his face turned grim as he shouted, “Disable the Spirit Array around this mountain valley and Martial Uncle will spare their lives!”

Before Ye Jing Yan could say anything, Ye Hen shouted, “Jing Han, don’t! Never dispel the Spirit Array no matter what...”

Shi Cang Ying’s face sank and he raised his hand and struck Ye Hen’s body with his palm, restricting him completely so that he could not even speak anymore.

When she saw this, Ye Jing Han immediately exclaimed, “Do not hurt my father... Martial Uncle Shi, you are also from Thousand Leaves Sect, you are our Sect’s Vice Sect Master, why must you do such a thing? Has Father ever mistreated you? Let him go, please! I beg of you!”

She begged him with all her heart and soul. It was a completely tragic sight.

But Shi Cang Ying was still unmoved. He just shook his head regretfully, “Martial Uncle hopes he can spare your father’s life too, but my hands are tied. I hope you can understand!”

As he spoke, he slowly walked behind a Second-Order Dao Source Realm Elder. Putting one hand on top of the Elder’s head, he looked at Ye Jing Han and said without hurry, “Watch properly, Martial Niece. For every ten breaths you do not open the Spirit Array... Martial Uncle will kill one person!”

After he said that, he pushed the Source Qi in his palm and the head of the bound Thousand Leaves Sect Elder burst open without even so much as a sound from him, his body falling stiffly to the ground.

Not only did the sudden kill cause Ye Jing Han’s face to pale and her eyes to grow desperate, even Ruan Hong Bo and the others were shocked. After all, the person he killed was an Elder of Thousand Leaves Sect, a fellow disciple he had known for many years whom he had worked with for centuries. But now, his face didn’t even change when he killed him, showing how ruthless and cruel Shi Cang Ying was.

Only Qiu Ze’s face was filled with a satisfied smile.

“Martial Uncle does not have much time, so think carefully,” after killing one person, Shi Cang Ying came behind another Elder and also put his hand similarly on the Elder’s head. Then, without saying a word, he looked quietly up at Ye Jing Han.

Ye Jing Han was biting her red lips so hard that they bled. She looked at Ye Hen, only to see the man constantly shaking his head at her. She knew that her father did not approve of her disabling the Spirit Array.

Ye Jing Han felt tormented. Even though she knew things would never end well if the Spirit Array was dispelled, nor improve her father’s current situation, she could not help feeling guilty when she thought of the Elder who had just been killed.

She couldn’t help but feel that she was the one who caused that Elder’s death.

That Elder was someone who watched her grow up and showed her so much love. He would often bring her out to play while she was little and taught her to cultivate when she was older, but now, he had died right before her eyes. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Yet she could only watch from afar, powerless to help.

Time gradually went by and Shi Cang Ying was about to kill another man. Ye Jing Han instantly became distraught, having no idea what to do.

Right at that moment, a sly smile suddenly rose up Shi Cang Ying’s lips. He moved his hand away from the second Elder and put it on the head of the man next to him instead.

Ye Jing Han’s face paled instantly and her tender body began trembling fiercely.
