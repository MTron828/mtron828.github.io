In the Elder’s tree cave, the Stone Spirit Elder and the Wood Spirit Clan’s Matriarch were overjoyed after having been notified by Xiao Xiao. They secretly thought that they hadn’t racked their brains in vain; they had somehow managed to make Yang Kai agree to their two clans’ request.

The two even proactively came to Xiao Xiao’s tree cave together.

Ruo Xi and Xiao Xiao went outside, leaving Yang Kai and two Clan Heads sitting cross-legged alone.

Elder was chuckling, obviously in a pretty good mood. Mu Na was also overjoyed and couldn’t conceal this truth.

Only Yang Kai had a dark look on his face, looking quite gloomy.

“Elder, let me say this first, I have agreed to help you, but that is all. If things take a turn for the worse, I will take Xiao Xiao away right then and there. As for the rest, you will have to depend on yourselves.”

“But of course!” Elder repeatedly nodded, stroking his stony beard, “If something really can’t be done, I won’t force it either.”

Yang Kai nodded and then asked, “Since that’s the case, I have nothing else to add. So, how are we going to proceed?”

Elder and Mu Na glanced at each other before the former replied, “We will charge straight ahead, sending Shi Jiu into the Blood Gate. That counts as a plan, doesn’t it?”

Yang Kai’s face twitched hard as he angrily scolded, “Plan!? Plan your head! The Blood Gate is now being watched by Four Divine Venerables personally! Eight Great Kings and thirty-two Monster Kings would come rushing at the first sign of trouble. How are you going to charge through?”

Elder looked a little embarrassed as he stated, “Honoured Guest, aren’t you proficient in the Dao of Space? Can’t you just take us there?”

Yang Kai’s pupil shrank and he stared dead straight at him and asked, “Xiao Xiao told you?”

He had never shown any manipulation of Space Principles in front of the Stone Spirit Clan, but since Elder knew about this, obviously he had heard it from Xiao Xiao.

Mu Na explained, “Honoured Guest, please don’t be angry. Our clans don’t have any malicious intentions towards you and we will not divulge your secret. Also, Shi Jiu didn’t disclose this, it was when Shi Jiu found us that Elder learned of it from his memories.”

Yang Kai’s voice became colder as he stated, softly sneering, “What other secrets do the two of you know?”

Elder forced a cough before replying, “We also know that the Honoured Guest has a magical storage artifact that can take us together without anyone noticing our presence.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but roll his eyes as thoughts of silencing these two suddenly flashed across his mind. He finally understood why these two clans were asking for his help. Even before that, they never inquired about his cultivation.

[I have the Sealed World Bead and I am also proficient in the Dao of Space, so I can indeed bring them to the Blood Gate without anyone noticing. That’s an advantage no one else has.]

It’s easier to ask for help from your friends and relatives than to ask a stranger.

Elder continued, “Our plan is like this, our clansmen will first hide in that Storage Artifact, then Honoured Guest will use your Space Divine Ability to lead us to the Blood Gate. After that, it’s our time to work; Honoured Guest, you don’t need to worry about what follows. As long as we can get close to the Blood Gate, we have our own way to send Shi Jiu inside.”

Yang Kai squinted his eyes and asked, “As far as I know, the Blood Gate is one of the two Restricted Areas of the Ancient Lands. Normally, no inhabitant of the Ancient Lands can even get close to it, let alone enter it. Do you have any solution for that?”

Mu Na replied with a smile, “That’s true, generally, but right now, the Blood Gate has changed. The restriction has loosened a lot, so it is not a problem to get close to it. The biggest problem is how to break through the Blood Gate’s seal.”

Elder proudly added, “We have ten Masters of immense strength. If my entire Stone Spirit Clan makes a move together, we can smash through any seal!”

Yang Kai’s face turned ugly as he asked, “Do you want to use brute force?”

Elder asked, raising his brows, “Is there something wrong with that?”

Yang Kai face-palmed before turning to Mu Na and asking, “Matriarch, the Stone Spirit Clan’s intelligence has always been so, so that’s fine, but why are you agreeing with this too?”

Mu Na asked, wryly smiling, “Is there a better way?”

Yang Kai was rendered speechless as he realized that the two tribes had no decent plans at all. They were simply going to use brute force to bend the situation to their will. Forced by the Four Great Divine Venerables, they had no choice but to take such a risk. If Xiao Xiao could really inherit Tai Yue’s power and become an Ancient Divine Spirit, he could naturally shelter the two clans under the noses of the Four Great Divine Venerables.

To put it bluntly, the two clans were at an impasse; it was a do or die situation for them.

After staring blankly for a while, Yang Kai stated, “Perhaps I can attempt to tear open the Blood Gate’s seal. Since the Divine Spirit Palace is sealed inside the Blood Gate, there must be a small world inside. My comprehension of Space Principles might give me the ability to tear open the boundary of that small world.”

When Elder heard this, he immediately spoke, rubbing his hands, “Honoured Guest, if you succeed, that will naturally be best, but if it doesn’t work, we will have to use brute force.”

Elder had always given Yang Kai a sense of wisdom, but now it seemed that a Stone Spirit was still a Stone Spirit. Even if they lived long enough, they would not get any wiser and would always advocate violence to solve their problems. The Wood Spirit Clan must have been having a hard time interacting with them over all the years they lived together.

“When are we leaving?” Yang Kai asked, looking at the two.

“This matter should not be delayed. We have to go sooner rather than later. This Elder is thinking of leaving tomorrow morning,” Elder solemnly said.

Mu Na lightly nodded; obviously, she agreed with this.

Yang Kai sighed helplessly and agreed, “Fine. You two should return and prepare your clansmen, we will depart… Tomorrow morning!”

Elder and Mu Na immediately left, apparently returning to inform their clansmen.

Yang Kai, on the other hand, sat cross-legged inside the tree cave. It could be said that what these two clans were planning to do was extremely risky. To be honest, Yang Kai wasn’t optimistic about their chances as failure seemed to be the far likelier outcome. What he needed to consider now was how to increase the safety margin and chances of success; after all, they were trying to make a move right under the Ancient Lands Four Great Divine Venerables’ noses. Once they alerted the four Divine Venerables, they might move to block their surroundings, and then Yang Kai might not be able to escape safely even with his Space Tearing abilities.

[Maybe… Xie Wu Wei can help.]

All night, Yang Kai was thinking hard.

At dawn, sounds of footsteps came from outside and Yang Kai opened his eyes and scanned with his Divine Sense. Immediately, he sensed that everyone in the Stone Spirit clan had been gathered. And not only the Stone Spirit Clan, but even over a hundred members of the Wood Spirit Clan were joining under Mu Na’s leadership, flying around the Stone Spirit Clan’s heads.

[Now that the arrow was already drawn, I can’t do anything but shoot it.] Yang Kai sighed before he stood up and went forward.

Seeing Yang Kai appear, the two Clan Heads’ faces turned solemn before Elder spoke, “Honoured Guest, we are ready.”

Yang Kai looked at Mu Na and asked, frowning, “Is the Wood Spirit Clan also coming?”

Yesterday, although Mu Na and Elder were discussing matters with him together, he really hadn’t expected the Wood Spirit Clan to come along with full force. This would be an extremely dangerous mission, so what could the Wood Spirit Clan do when they weren’t good at fighting? Once they were swept into the battle, any Monster King could massacre all of them.

Elder said with a smile, “The Wood Spirits coexist with my Stone Spirit Clan; although they will not directly participate in the battle, they will still be of great help. Honoured Guest, you don’t need to worry.”

Yang Kai furrowed his brow but didn’t object either. Instead, he nodded and said, “Since that’s the case, I will trust your decision.”

Yang Kai looked around before doubtfully asking, “Where is Ruo Xi?”

He didn’t see Zhang Ruo Xi anywhere. He had been sitting in the tree cave all day, thinking hard, so he thought she had simply been outside, but only now did he find out that Ruo Xi was missing.

Elder and Mu Na looked at each other, the two clansmen also exchanging looks and asking one another, “Have any of you seen that little girl?”

No one answered. Not to mention the few Stone Spirits, even the hundred Wood Spirits didn’t know where Ruo Xi was.

Yang Kai’s expression changed as he released his Divine Sense like a tide, sweeping the surroundings, scanning over a thousand-kilometre radius, but even then he didn’t find Ruo Xi’s aura.

This shocked and angered him. How could someone alive disappear for no reason?

“Shi Jiu, do you know something?” Elder suddenly asked in a deep voice.

Yang Kai turned his head to look, and saw Xiao Xiao standing there with an uneasy look on his face, constantly scratching his ears and cheek; his eyes erratically moving around.

Yang Kai’s brow twitched as he asked, looking at him, “Xiao Xiao, where did Ruo Xi go!?”

Seeing that he couldn’t hide anymore, Xiao Xiao immediately became dejected and whimpered a few times.

Yang Kai’s countenance drastically changed, raising his head and turning to gaze in the Blood Gate’s direction, grinding his teeth as he scolded, “That girl!”

Mu Na too couldn’t help but cry out in surprise, covering her mouth, “She actually set off to go to the Blood Gate first?”

Yang Kai angrily said, “She must have gone because I prevented her from participating yesterday. When I get my hands on her, I will spank her butt red!”

[This is outrageous! Ruo Xi has always been docile and obedient, so I never dreamed she would dare to sneak away without telling me. She has really gone too far this time!]

Yang Kai raised his hand again and knocked down on Xiao Xiao’s head, angrily scolding, “Since you know, why didn’t you tell me earlier?”

Xiao Xiao clutched his head, whimpering with an aggrieved expression on his face.

“It’s useless to argue about this now. Honoured Guest, it’s best to find her as soon as possible. The Blood Gate is surrounded by many members of the Monster Race. If she falls into their hands, things will be troublesome,” Elder persuaded.

It wasn’t like Yang Kai didn’t know this, so he quickly suppressed the anxiety in his heart and said, “Relax yourselves and don’t resist. Don’t make a fuss about what you see when you go in.”

After saying so, Yang Kai stretched his hand towards the two clans. Immediately, Space Principles surged, and the boundary of the Seal World Bead opened, allowing the two clans to enter the Small Sealed World one after another.

Embodiment, who had already been notified by Yang Kai, sat there with a smile, welcoming the arrival of the clansmen of the two clans.

Elder had said that the Stone Spirit Clan never had more than ten members; any more would die at birth.

[I wonder what expression they will have when they see him?] Yang Kai didn’t bother to pay attention to this, let alone explain to them the circumstances of his Embodiment. After he had collected the two clans into the Sealed World Bead, Yang Kai immediately turned around and rapidly flew towards the Blood Gate.

Along the road, Yang Kai constantly spread his Divine Sense to search, hoping to find Zhang Ruo Xi.

But she had set off a day earlier, so even if she wasn’t moving at full speed, she might have already reached the Blood Gate. Naturally, it was impossible to find tracks on the road.

And this turned out to be the case. At this moment, Zhang Ruo Xi was already within three hundred kilometres of the Blood Gate. She had been cautious along the way, and although luck had played some part in it, she hadn’t encountered too many twists and turns.

But when she arrived here, she didn’t dare to move forward. There were too many Monster Race members in front of her, and they weren’t hiding their presence either. If she dared to move closer, she would definitely be discovered.
