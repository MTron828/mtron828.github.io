Yang Kai turned to Ji Yao and asked, “What happened?”

“Honoured Master, these three people have stopped us for some reason, and they’re blocking the path forward,” Ji Yao answered.

“Honoured Master?” The three people before them all looked utterly astonished to hear this; after all, Yang Kai and Ji Yao looked to be about the same age, yet this man was the icy woman’s Honoured Master?

As the ship was guarded by a protective barrier, even the old man could not check Yang Kai and Ji Yao’s cultivations.

Even so, since the young man was good enough to be someone’s Honoured Master, his cultivation must be quite high. The old man guessed that Yang Kai had to be an Emperor Realm Master at least. After all, the exquisitely built ship was an Emperor Artifact, something that would be impossible for an ordinary Dao Source Realm cultivator to obtain.

At that thought, the old man smiled slightly at Yang Kai and said, “Now then, young man, there’s no need to be nervous. We bear no ill will.”

“Oh, do I appear nervous?” Yang Kai smiled, thinking to himself that the old man had quite the level of confidence. He had gone through the Ancient Wild Lands, and caused quite a stir in front of the Four Great Divine Venerables and thirty-two Monster Kings. He had come face-to-face with more than one Great Emperor before that. In this world, it could be said that few could make Yang Kai nervous anymore.

The old man acted as though he had not heard this comment though and continued, “It’s just that this ship has caught the eye of Young Lady Xue Man, so I would like to negotiate with you regarding it. Could you perhaps be persuaded to part with your ship? I will pay a handsome sum for it.”

After a pause, the old man added, “I forgot to introduce myself. I am Yan Qing of Profound Thunder Pavilion. This is the Pavilion’s Young Master Bai Lu, and this is the daughter of Serenity City’s City Lord, Young Lady Yan Xue Man.”

After the old man made the introduction, he and the two people with him all looked very proud of themselves, as though Profound Thunder Pavilion and Serenity City were great forces to be reckoned with.

Young Pavilion Master Bai Lu smiled courteously, cupping his fists as he asked, “May I know your name, fair Lady?”

He seemed uninterested in Yang Kai and immediately started asking for Ji Yao’s name, clearly smitten with her beauty. Though the City Lord’s Daughter, Yan Xue Man, was quite attractive, her looks still fell far behind Ji Yao’s.

Bai Lu’s question caused him to receive a hard kick from Yan Xue Man beside him. She glared at him and huffed, “Why are you asking her that? Are you interested in her? You bastard! You already have me! Why are you still going after other women!? You want me to beat you up!”

As she spoke, she started pummelling Bai Lu with kicks and punches, but her fists and feet were dainty and light. Not only did she not hurt him at all, but it was more like she was just throwing a coquettish tantrum, causing Bai Lu to laugh. He reached out and pulled her into his arms, looking like he thought of himself as the ultimate winner in life.

Yan Qing did not even glance at the two as he said, “Young Master and Young Lady Xue Man are accustomed to such mischief, please do not mind.”

Ji Yao answered coldly, “Your matters have nothing to do with us. My Honoured Master and I need to be on our way, now make way!”

“Young Lady,” Yan Qing repeated, “This Old Master only wishes to purchase your ship.”

“I already said that I wasn’t selling it!” Ji Yao’s expression grew colder.

Bai Lu smiled pleasantly, “Now, Young Lady, don’t be so cold. As the saying goes, the more friends one has, the more paths open up. It’s only a ship, just name your price and I’ll pay up!”

“Sure!” Yang Kai stood forward, smiling as he spoke to Bai Lu, “I like people like Young Master Bai, who have both wealth and ability. Such people are refined, generous, and high-class! Since Young Master Bai is so ready to make his offer, then we’ll sell this ship. What do you think, Yao’er?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A frown appeared on Ji Yao’s forehead, but she nodded, “If Honoured Master wishes to sell it, then it’s fine.”

“Many thanks to the Young Lady,” said Bai Lu, cupping his fists.

He had only spoken to Ji Yao from start to finish, as though he had not seen Yang Kai at all, but now he turned to look at Yang Kai, “May I know what your asking price is, Your Excellency?”

“One hundred million!” Yang Kai said lightly, “If Young Master Bai can pay a hundred million, then this ship will be yours.”

Bai Lu’s expression did not even change as he nodded lightly, “One hundred million… for a flight type Emperor Artifact, it isn’t costly.”

Not only that, but it was extremely cheap. He thought Yang Kai had the intent of showing goodwill in order to befriend him; after all, not just anybody could become the friend of the Young Pavilion Master of Profound Thunder Pavilion, which was a significant power in the Northern Territory. He smiled slightly, “Old Yan. Pay them!”

“Yes!” Yan Qing nodded, and after some rummaging, tossed a Space Ring to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai caught it, checked it with his Divine Sense, and smiled faintly. As he put the Space Ring away, he said, “Young Master Bai, the amount of Source Crystals doesn’t seem quite right.”

“How so?” Bai Lu frowned, and turned to look at Yan Qing, “Old Yan, did you count carefully?”

“There were exactly one hundred million Source Crystals,” Yan Qing answered, “I could not possibly have miscounted.”

“Indeed, it does have one hundred million Source Crystals…” Yang Kai said, nodding, but then his tone suddenly changed, “But, these are only Low-Rank Source Crystals…”

Yan Qing’s expression changed, “Didn’t you want Low-Rank Source Crystals? Or did you actually mean… Mid-Rank?”

“What!?” Bai Lu was similarly shocked. One hundred million Mid-Rank Source Crystals, that was the same as ten billion Low-Rank Source Crystals! It was an outrageous demand!

“No no no!” Yang Kai waved a finger at them, “Not one hundred million Mid-Rank Source Crystals… what I want is one hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals!”

“You… you’re insane!” Bai Lu’s entire body shook.

One hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals was a sum Bai Lu did not even dare think about. He had no idea how this person could bring up such a preposterous demand.

Though Profound Thunder Pavilion was a first-class Sect, they could never afford so many High-Rank Source Crystals even if they piled together everything they owned. An Emperor Grade ship may be rare, but it could not possibly be worth this much.

A murderous light flashed across Old Yan’s eyes.

Yang Kai smiled, “Young Master Bai, you just said that you would pay any price, but are you now trying to back out? A man’s word should be as firm as metal. It seems like Young Master Bai’s not very trustworthy.”

Beside him, Ji Yao smiled.

She was not very willing when Yang Kai agreed to sell the ship earlier, but she had to obey her Honoured Master. Only now did she realise that Yang Kai had no actual intention of selling her ship, and was simply teasing these people.

[When did Honoured Master gain such a sense of humour…]

In her recollections, her Honoured Master was always cold and calm, only showing warmth when alone with her and her sisters. She had never acted like she was doing right now.

As she thought further, Ji Yao began to feel that something was not quite right, and a frown appeared on her brow as she looked at Yang Kai in extreme confusion.

This sturdy figure seemed rather… different from the one in her memories.

“Little brat, you dare mock me!” Bai Lu flew into a rage.

Yang Kai coldly snorted, “Now, why would you say that, Young Master Bai? You three unreasonably barred the way of my disciple and I and insisted on buying Yao’er’s ship. I am merely letting you have your way out of goodwill. I’ll excuse your lack of gratitude, but why speak to us in such a way? Unless Young Master Bai really thinks he can bully us with impunity?”

Hearing those words, Bai Lu’s heart was filled with fury, and it burnt within him like a volcano.

The other man was clearly playing him for a fool, and yet he still claimed to be in the right. This put Bai Lu in quite a fit of rage and he yelled, “Old Yan, kill this bastard!”

Yan Qing was already in the mood to kill, and he did not hesitate upon hearing Bai Lu’s orders, immediately charging forward.

Bai Lu hurriedly added, “But don’t hurt the girl!”

Even at such a time, he still had Ji Yao’s beauty in mind. Evidently, there were some situations in which women held a unique advantage.

Old Yan came flying at them, Emperor Qi coursing through his body. His First-Order Emperor Realm cultivation was fully unleashed, and he struck down at the ship with his palm.

The ship’s protection broke apart with a boom under such power, not putting up any defence at all.

Yang Kai was stunned and realised that something was wrong. This ship was an Emperor Artifact after all, so its defensive power could not possibly be so weak. He then looked at Ji Yao but saw that she was staring blankly at him, her beautiful eyes full of confusion.

“Oh crap!” Yang Kai was alarmed. He did not know what had gone wrong, but Ji Yao was clearly suffering a relapse.

Ji Yao had been calm and stable all this time as she stayed by his side, so he had not expected a problem to occur at such a time.

It was clear that the ship’s defence was extremely weak because its owner was suffering from turbulent emotions.

“Boy, you dare to mock my pavilion’s Young Master? Today, you die!” Old Yan’s confidence was greatly boosted after breaking apart the ship’s protective barrier and threw another palm strike towards Yang Kai. His palm carried waves of Emperor Qi and Principles, clearly intent on turning Yang Kai into paste.

Yang Kai reached out and pulled the bewildered Ji Yao into his arms, channelling Emperor Qi to shield her as he matched the palm strike, “Scram!”

He was greatly worried that something had suddenly gone wrong with Ji Yao and no longer had any mood to mess with these people. His attack was fuelled by rage and was far beyond what Yan Qing could withstand. Though Yang Kai and Yan Qing were both First-Order Emperor Realm cultivators, killing enemies above his level was commonplace for Yang Kai.

Yan Qing was only an ordinary First-Order Emperor, while Yang Kai would not even fear fighting those in the Third-Order.

*Hong…*

A huge noise was heard along with an explosion of wind.

As their Emperor Qi collided, Yan Qing grunted and seemed as though he had been struck by lightning. His Emperor Qi and Principles were broken apart by an enormous force, as though they had been made from ordinary paper. That gigantic power surged up his arm, exploding it into shreds of flesh that scattered all around.

With a cry, blood sprayed from Yan Qing’s mouth as he was sent flying.

Yang Kai remained in place, unmoving as he protected Ji Yao. He was like a divine being as he stood there, firm as a mountain and still as an ocean.

“This…” Bai Lu watched, astounded as Old Yan was sent flying back with blood spraying into the air. His body suddenly started shaking violently.

Yan Xue Man’s pretty face also turned incredibly pale as her teeth chattered.

The two of them now realised that they had aggravated a powerful foe. They had thought that taking down the young man would be child’s play with an Emperor Realm cultivator like Old Yan protecting them, but instead, things had turned out opposite to their expectations, leaving them at a complete loss about how to react.
