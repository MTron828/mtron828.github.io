The middle-aged man turned his head when he heard this and looked at the beautiful woman kneeling at the side, inquiring, “Junior Sister Hua, tell me. If I went into battle myself, can I kill that brat?”

This beautiful woman was surprisingly Hua Qing Si, who separated from Yang Kai in the Shattered Star Sea. She was only a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator when they parted, but she had gained her own opportunities in the Shattered Star Sea and had broken through to the Emperor Realm.

However, at this moment, she did not have the noble appearance an Emperor Realm Master should have and instead she looked like a captured prisoner. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Hearing the middle-aged man’s question, Hua Qing Si pursed her lips and turned her head aside.

“Junior Sister Hua, you’re being difficult again.” A sneer surfaced on the middle-aged man’s lips as he suddenly formed a seal with his hand.

In the next moment, an ear-splitting scream tore from Hua Qing Si’s throat. She seemed to be suffering the most unbearable torture in the world and her pretty face was instantly distorted from the pain. Droplets of sweat rolled down her forehead, soaking her clothes in an instant.

“Honoured Master!” She forcefully bore the pain as she knelt down and cried at the feet of the old man.

The old man was motionless and did not even look at her, as if he had not heard nor seen anything.

The middle-aged man sneered again, “How dare the Disciple of our Honoured Master try to protect an outsider. If it weren’t for Honoured Master’s great compassion, you would already be dead! Your life was spared to make up for your mistakes, yet you insist on being stubborn. As your Senior Brother, I really can’t stand it and must punish you.”

“Honoured Master…” Hua Qing Si’s voice trembled, her face extremely pale as she gritted her teeth and pleaded, “I’ll tell him that you want that thing back. Please, Honoured Master… Stop and show him mercy. He is not an… unreasonable person, and this disciple is friends with him. I should be able to… Should be able to convince him, Honoured Master… Please give this Disciple a chance.”

“Impudence!” When the middle-aged man saw that she did not ask for mercy for herself but instead for others even under torture, he was furious and formed a new hand seal, causing Hua Qing Si to shriek and curl up in pain.

The old man sighed slightly, a look of helplessness appearing on his face as he spoke, “Girls really do grow up only to side with outsiders.”

With a wave of the old man’s hand, the middle-aged man ceased his actions.

The old man stretched out his hand and lifted Hua Qing Si up, stating, “This Old Master knows that it is thanks to him that you were able to break through to the Emperor Realm, but you must not forget who taught you and who supported you all this time.”

“Yes… Yes, Honoured Master. Disciple will never forget Honoured Master’s nurturing grace.” Hua Qing Si panted as she opened her eyes weakly.

The old man nodded, “It’s good that you understand. If it was something else, this Old Master would have allowed you the freedom to try; after all, you are now an Emperor Realm Master, and as Disciple of this Old Master, this Old Master is proud too, but… this matter is too important. The fewer people who know, the better. This Old Master sent you to inquire about information because he valued you, but you disappointed this Old Master.”

Hua Qing Si’s eyes flashed with guilt.

Although it was out of her control at that time when she had her Soul Brand taken by Yang Kai and was thrown into the Sealed World Bead, she really had failed the mission her Honoured Master had given her. Later, even though Yang Kai returned her freedom, she did not plan on reporting what happened due to the latter’s kindness towards her; she simply could not repay his grace with enmity, so she planned to just conceal her identity and never go back to Star Soul Palace as if the old Hua Qing Si had died.

However, she did not expect her Honoured Master to send her Senior Brother Wu Ming to trace her whereabouts to the Thousand Leaves Sect. Not only did he capture her, he even caused the extermination of the Thousand Leaves Sect.

After that, some kind of Secret Technique was used on her and she did not remember what she had revealed to her Honoured Master, but she knew that the extermination of Thousand Leaves Sect was caused by her presence there, and it was also a means for her Honoured Master to lure out Yang Kai.

Because there were a few people that Yang Kai valued greatly in the Thousand Leaves Sect, as long as they were captured, Yang Kai would definitely show up.

Facts have proved that there was no mistake in this move, and now Yang Kai had indeed appeared in Flowing Shadow City, stepping into a trap.

“How could this Old Master tolerate a little boy stealing his treasure? Qing Si, don’t think about it anymore. After this matter is over, return to Star Soul Palace with this Old Master and enter secluded retreat to reflect on your mistakes.” He waved his hand. Although his tone was flat, there was a faint trace of excitement flashing in those eyes.

A year ago, when Wu Ming brought Hua Qing Si back to Star Soul Palace, he used a Secret Technique to compel Hua Qing Si to reveal a lot of secrets. Not only did he find out who owned the treasure he had lost, but he also learned that the person actually had a storage artifact that actually held an independent world.

It was still alright if that was all it was. Although such a storage artifact was precious and rare, it was just a storage artifact in the end and it would be impossible to use it at will if one did not cultivate the Dao of Space.

The key was that within the storage artifact were many rare and precious objects. What truly attracted him were the two sacred trees, one filled with vitality, and the other that was gold and silver in colour.

As an Elder of Star Soul Palace, this old man had a powerful cultivation at the Third-Order Emperor Realm and had lived a very long time, allowing him to see and learn about many things. By carefully studying the characteristics of the two sacred trees, he was almost certain that one of them was the legendary Immortal Tree.

The Immortal Tree was rumoured to allow one to obtain an immortal and indestructible body if refined, which was a great temptation to any cultivator. He was getting old and thought that he would have no hope of breaking through again in his life, but he did not expect such an opportunity to fall into his lap so suddenly.

If he could obtain the Immortal Tree and refine it, he would very likely become a Great Emperor, and would be able to stand on equal footing with Bright Moon Great Emperor!

As for the gold and silver sacred tree, he had a rough idea but did not dare to be too sure. In any case, these two sacred trees were supreme treasures and anyone who obtained either one would be set for life. It was unimaginable that they were both in the hands of one person.

As long as that boy was killed, those treasures would be his. There would not be anywhere he could not go after he refined the Immortal Tree.

The old man did not disclose such a confidential matter to anyone, even Wu Ming, whom he relied on the most. Wu Ming only thought that his Honoured Master was planning to retrieve some treasure that he lost many years ago and had no idea about his Honoured Master’s other plans. At the same time, he had secretly made up his mind to finish off Hua Qing Si after everything was done so there would be no chance of any of these secrets leaking.

Hua Qing Si’s expression dimmed, knowing that it was useless to continue persuading now.

Wu Ming stood to the side and glanced at Hua Qing Si with a cold sneer, teasing, “Junior Sister Hua, don’t tell me you’ve fallen for that little brat?”

Hua Qing Si raised her head to glare at him, gritting her teeth, “Don’t talk nonsense.”

“Bitch, you dare to talk back!?” Wu Ming’s face twitched as he lifted his hand to form a seal again.

Hua Qing Si was planted with a Heart-Strangling Insect in her body, and her life was his to control, so how could he allow Hua Qing Si to be so impudent in front of him?

“Enough.” The old man raised his hand slightly to stop Wu Ming, “Go to the auction venue and prepare everything. There must be no mistakes.”

Even an old monster like him did not dare to be careless when dealing with a cultivator proficient in the Dao of Space. Even Yin Le Sheng had to set up a large array to isolate the world to fight with Yang Kai, so how could this old man be negligent? A small accident was enough to allow Yang Kai to escape, and although he had held the people Yang Kai cherished hostage, he could not guarantee that Yang Kai would give in obediently.

Wu Ming clenched his hand bitterly as he glared at Hua Qing Si coldly, thinking [I’ll let you rest for a while. When this matter is over, I will treat you well with love after requesting Honoured Master to give you to me.]

After Wu Ming left, the old man comforted Hua Qing Si, “Your Senior Brother has always been short-tempered, don’t blame him.”

Hua Qing Si did not dare to blame him aloud, but her heart was filled with bitterness. Her current situation was nothing like what a Master and Disciple should have, nor did it show any of the comradery a Senior Brother and Junior Sister should have. Her Honoured Master guarded her like she was a thief, and her Senior Brother looked at her with hatred. What was she to do? Where could she go? Even though she had reached the Emperor Realm, she had lost her direction in life.

…..

“Boy, what’s your name?”

Outside the City Lord’s Mansion, someone halted Yang Kai and his party as soon as they walked out.

It was a young woman who stopped them. Her appearance made her look about seventeen or eighteen years old, with a petite stature. She was wearing a clean light blue dress and although she was not tall, she had a pair of grand peaks that threatened to rip the fabric restraining them. The elegant line of her slim waist, and her plump, perky bottom only further emphasized her ample figure.

The young woman had a beautiful face, but she also had a vigorous and heroic air about her.

Standing in front of Yang Kai, she looked up at him with the demeanour of a Senior.

Yang Kai was taken aback, looking left and right before pointing at his nose and asking, “Are you talking to me?”

He was sure he did not know this woman, and he did not notice her when he entered the city just now, so he had no idea what her intentions were in blocking his path.

The young woman’s brow furrowed as she snarled, “Who else could I be talking to?”

“Do we know each other?” Yang Kai looked at her with a puzzled expression.

The young woman apparently didn’t have much patience as she snapped, “Just answer my question, what’s with all that nonsense?”

Yang Kai raised his brow and replied, “Wouldn’t it be shameful for me if I just answered anything you asked?”

This young woman was rather baffling for blocking others for no reason and acting all pretentiously. As such, Yang Kai was unable to produce any favourable impression of her.

Ying Fei grinned and snickered, “Young Master Yang is handsome and exceptionally talented, truly a dragon among men. I’m afraid someone has fallen in love with you at first sight… “

*Chi… *

Before Ying Fei could finish speaking, a delicate pink fist suddenly impacted his cheek. If Ying Fei did not possess exceptional speed, allowing him to barely dodge in time, he would have taken this punch right to his face.

Both Yang Kai’s and Ying Fei’s faces changed drastically after witnessing this punch.

The power behind this blow was terrifying, even distorting space in its wake. On the other hand, this woman clearly had not used much of her strength just now as she looked perfectly relaxed.

Ying Fei’s face darkened as a little horror lingered in his heart.

Although he was a Monster King and had great strength, he knew that if he had received that punch directly, he would have been seriously injured, if not dead.

It was quite hard to imagine that a young woman who looked so dainty had such monstrous strength.

“Nothing but a trivial Monster King. If you dare to mention that word again, I will immediately take your life!” The girl warned Ying Fei, slowly retracting her fist.

Ying Fei was really horrified now as his pair of eagle-like eyes flashed with terrifying light, peering at this young woman as if trying to look into the depths of her Soul.

He had been hiding his aura the whole time he stood next to Yang Kai without revealing the slightest flaw at all. Even an ordinary Third-Order Emperor Realm Master may not be able to sense his strength and identity, but this young woman only needed a glance to know he was a Monster King!

Such sharp vision was nothing short of extraordinary.
