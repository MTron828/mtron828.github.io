*Gu dong…*

The sounds of many Emperor Realm Masters gulping could be heard as each one of them took up a defensive stance. Sorrow suddenly welled up in their hearts, but they simply did not know what else to do.

Gong Yue had just broken the seal containing the Demons Spirits hidden below Spirit Sword Peak, releasing them into the world, and now a man came out and proclaimed himself the feared Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. On this one day, more happened in the Azure Sun Temple than in the past eight hundred years combined.

“Where’s Wen Zi Shan? What have you done with him?” Gao Xue Ting asked in a trembling voice.

Wen Zi Shan should have been helping the Bustling World Great Emperor separate their Souls, but Wu Kuang had come out possessing Duan Hong Chen’s body. Since there was no news about Wen Zi Shan at all, Gao Xue Ting couldn’t help but worry.

“Hmph, who is this Wen Zi Shan you speak of? This King crushed a lot of bugs to death earlier. Who knows if he was one of them.”

Gao Xue Ting’s pretty face paled, and she almost fell limp on the ground.

Wu Kuang scanned the Emperor Realm Masters present with a burning gaze, fingers lifting up while he counted, “One, two, three…”

Yang Kai’s face was cold, “Wu Kuang, what are you doing?”

Wu Kuang laughed, “Not bad! There are nine Emperor Realm insects in total! This King is still weak after just reviving, so you’re just the nutrition I need. Even though none of you are very strong, you’re plump enough.”

The moment those words were spoken, everyone’s face changed dramatically.

All of them had heard of the infamous Heaven Devouring Battle Law and knew what this evil Secret Art was all about. It was a Secret Art that could devour anything, and legends told that the number of Star Fields destroyed by this Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was countless. Back then, all the Cultivation Stars in the lower plane’s Star Boundary that he had visited became desolate Dead Stars, drained of all of their vitality and all life being scoured from their surface.

So, when they heard Wu Kuang say this, they all knew what he intended to do.

They could no longer worry about the escaping Demon Spirits. Each one of the Emperor Realm Masters began circulating their Emperor Qi in preparation to face off against this terrifying foe.

Wu Kuang frowned at that moment, but then suddenly grinned again, “Hahaha, why so nervous? It was just a little joke! This King has just been freed so he is in a good mood, a killing spree would spoil this joyous occasion, so I’ll let you all off this time.”

No one responded. None of them knew what this madman really meant, but they did not dare to speak easily for fear of angering him.

Wu Kuang snickered, seemingly finding no meaning in continuing this conversation either. He then turned his head towards a certain direction and grasped towards the void. His movements were calm and relaxed, but when he opened his palm again a black light was in his grip.

No one knew where he caught this black light from.

“What an interesting little thing.” A Demon Spirit that the Emperor Realm Masters couldn’t even hide in time from was now held in Wu Kuang’s hand as he studied it with interest. The black light actually stayed obediently in place without any intention of corrupting him, just as if it were a dead object, “It’s all thanks to your help that this King was set free. En, so I’ll lend you a hand.”

As soon as he said that, he raised his hand towards a point.

The air trembled as if something had been broken.

Naturally, it was the sound of the Sect Defending Array being shattered. Qiu Ran had just quietly ordered the activation of the Sect Defending Array, and it was actually broken open just like that.

The entire Azure Sun Temple was just like a balloon with a hole in it. All the Demon Spirits trapped inside were able to find an escape route and swiftly fled through it, disappearing from sight.

Yang Kai and the rest could only watch helplessly.

Wu Kuang swept his eyes over them again, smiling, “See you next time. This King will not show mercy again, so be careful. The outside world is very dangerous!”

Cackling, his body transformed into a stream of light before rushing out of the gap in the array.

It wasn’t until he disappeared from everyone’s view that the Emperor Realm Masters could finally breathe. Just for a moment, they were clearly able to perceive Wu Kuang’s murderous intent. Even though they had no idea why Wu Kuang changed his mind at the last moment, they still felt extremely lucky to have retained their lives.

“Quick, to the Restricted Area!” Gao Xue Ting shouted, forcefully composing herself as she flew in that direction.

Qiu Ran and the others were also concerned about Wen Zi Shan’s safety, so they quickly followed her as well.

Yang Kai turned to Chen Wen Hao and Feng Ming, “There’s a demon sealing ground below Spirit Sword Peak. I must trouble the two of you to investigate the area carefully.”

Chen Wen Hao nodded, “Just leave this to Brother Feng and I. You… should also be careful on your side.”

Yang Kai nodded before he quickly followed after Gao Xue Ting and the rest.

There were several Restricted Areas in Azure Sun Temple, but the most important one was the belly of the mountain where the Divine Ascension Mirror sat. The Divine Ascension Mirror was Azure Sun Temple’s greatest secret and even ordinary disciples have no idea it existed.

The last time Yang Kai was able to enter it for training was as a reward from Wen Zi Shan for the Star Seals he brought back from the Four Seasons Realm, so he remembered the location of that place very well.

Chasing the other Elders over, Yang Kai caught up with them in front of the mountain wall.

Gao Xue Ting opened the barrier here and rushed inside.

The group followed the tunnel down from the side of the mountain and quickly arrived at its base.

When they saw the scene there, their hearts all sank. The scene that met their eyes was that of a middle-aged woman leaning against the cave wall, mouth dripping with blood and her face as pale as a sheet of paper. Clearly, she had been badly injured.

The Divine Ascension Mirror was placed on a stone platform a short distance away, but it was a little different from when Yang Kai first saw it. It was not as smooth as before, and there was even a trace of black Qi lingering above its surface.

“Grandma…” Gao Xue Ting rushed forward and crouched down next to the middle-aged woman, asking nervously, “Are you alright?”

The middle-aged woman tried to smile, but the smile on her face looked even worse than if she was crying, “I’m not dead yet. Quickly, go and see how the Temple Master… Cough cough…”

Her wounds were apparently even worse than they appeared and were clearly inflicted by someone extremely powerful. She spat out a mouthful of blood after only saying a few words to Gao Xue Ting and her aura became extremely feeble.

But Gao Xue Ting had even more important things to worry about at the moment. She was concerned about Wen Zi Shan’s safety. As soon as she heard the middle-aged woman’s words, she immediately began searching for Wen Zi Shan’s body.

Qiu Ran went forward and took out a few Spirit Pills for the middle-aged woman to take.

Looking at the middle-aged woman’s face, she felt vaguely familiar to Yang Kai and he asked hesitantly, “Grandma You?”

The woman raised her eyes to look at him, “Oh, that little brat from back then has now become an Elder! You lot really grow up fast.”

“You really are Grandma You.” Yang Kai was shocked, “Grandma has also changed a lot.”

He had no idea what Grandma You’s real name was, only that she watched over the Divine Ascension Mirror. He remembered the last time he came here with Xia Sheng, Grandma You had the appearance of a mad old granny with a hoarse and unpleasant voice. When he was training in the Divine Ascension Mirror, she had even sent people to hunt him down.

Grandma You was the master of a great force called the Divine Ascension Country inside the Divine Ascension Mirror World where her subordinates were as plentiful as the clouds. During that time, Yang Kai narrowly escaped death several times.

After exiting the Divine Ascension World, he heard that Grandma You was imprisoned by Wen Zi Shan, after which he did not hear any news about her at all. Now, it seems that Wen Zi Shan had completely turned her to his side and left the important task of guarding the Divine Ascension Mirror in her hands.

This time, Grandma You was clearly injured by Wu Kuang during his escape.

Suddenly, they heard Gao Xue Ting’s call in the distance.

They were all surprised and quickly headed that way, only to see Wen Zi Shan’s body completely intact inside the isolated stone room, but he was sweating a puddle for some reason, as if he had been attacked.

“Grandma, the Temple Master is alive, but he seems to be trapped in the Divine Ascension Mirror. Is there anything you can do?”

Yang Kai helped Grandma You over. One of them was injured and the other’s strength was greatly depleted, so both their complexions were terrible.

Grandma You took a look at Wen Zi Shan’s condition before looking at the changed Divine Ascension Mirror, sighing, “He’s not trapped, he’s just not coming out. I’m afraid some kind of accident must have happened inside the Divine Ascension World. What happened out there?”

There was no time to explain everything, so Yang Kai simply used his Divine Sense to transmit everything he knew into Grandma You’s mind directly.

She was silent for a moment, reviewing the information in this Divine Sense package, but soon a look of astonishment filled her face, “Sealed Demons? Demon Spirits escaping? Seems like that thing that rushed into the Divine Ascension Mirror before was a Demon Spirit…”

Gao Xue Ting was shocked, “A Demon Spirit came in here?”

Grandma You nodded, “Yes. It rushed into the Divine Ascension Mirror. Then, that Sir… He suddenly woke up, injured me, and left this place.”

Yang Kai quickly said, “That man was not Senior Hong Chen, he was the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor!”

Grandma You’s eyes narrowed at his words, “So that’s how it is. I was just thinking that that Senior wouldn’t have struck me for no reason.”

“Demon Spirits can actually invade the Divine Ascension Mirror?” Qiu Ran’s face was extremely grim as he stared fixedly at the Divine Ascension Mirror. In that short moment, the black light on the mirror grew denser, and the darkness was clearly emitting the aura of a Demon Spirit.

Yang Kai said, “The world inside the Divine Ascension Mirror is a world of Souls, and the aim for the Demon Spirit’s corruption is precisely the Soul. The Divine Ascension Mirror World is becoming nourishment for its growth.”

“En, what you say is reasonable. We must find a way to stop it. We don’t even know how Temple Master is doing inside.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I’ll go in and take a look,” Yang Kai volunteered.

“I’ll go with you!” Gao Xue Ting quickly declared. Even though Wen Zi Shan’s physical body was unharmed, Gao Xue Ting couldn’t rest easy until she saw his Soul.

Yang Kai nodded and said to the others, “I will have to trouble Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters to stand guard here!”

Chen Qian replied, “Junior Brother Yang, your complexion looks terrible. Why don’t I go with Senior Sister Gao instead?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “I can withstand the corruption of the Demon Spirit. I’ll be fine.”

Since he insisted, Chen Qian couldn’t say anything else but urge him to be careful.

Time was tight, so Yang Kai and Gao Xue Ting each found a stone room and went inside, sitting down cross-legged. Once the stone rooms were closed, Grandma You pushed herself to open the channel to the Divine Ascension Mirror World.

Two streams of profound light then came out of the Divine Ascension Mirror, pouring into the sealed stone rooms. Yang Kai and Gao Xue Ting’s bodies shook at the same time, and the strange feeling of their Souls separating from their bodies washed over them.

It was not the first time they had entered the Divine Ascension Mirror World, so they did not resist and allowed the force to pull their Souls away.
