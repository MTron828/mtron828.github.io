In the Star Field, each Cultivation Star had its own World Principles, so there were inevitably differences between them.

Whether it was in terms of World Energy or materials produced, or the number of cultivators living on it and the heights they could reach, there was a huge contrast between different Cultivation Stars.

For example, Tong Xuan Realm’s World Energy was extremely thin, so cultivators were limited to reaching the Saint Realm.

On some Cultivation Stars, the limit was the Saint King Realm, Origin Returning Realm...

Although Shadowed Star had rich World Energy, enough to support cultivators reaching the Origin King Realm, because of the World Principle suppression, it was impossible for cultivators to spy on the mysteries of the Origin King Realm.

Among the many Cultivation Stars, the most bountiful ones would be taken as Home Stars of great forces.

For example, Water Moon Star of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, Sword Star of Sword Union, Purple Star of Purple Star...

These Home Stars surpassed other Cultivation Stars in almost all aspects.

Azure Tree Star could only be regarded as an ordinary Cultivation Star with World Energy on par with Shadowed Star’s but with less than half the area.

In front of the Azure Tree Palace, Gu Jian Xin’s Starship descended slowly towards a square where a group of Sword Union cultivators were waiting to receive him.

The leader of this group was a beautiful woman with a stunning face and graceful figure. She was wearing a long black dress and had such abundant peaks that they nearly burst from their restraints. Her waist was slim while her legs were long and slender. On her face, she wore a warm smile that paired perfectly with her bright eyes while a mature aura lingered about her.

As soon as Gu Jian Xin disembarked from the Starship, he greeted this woman enthusiastically, “Aunt Lan, it’s been a long time.”

The beautiful woman called Aunt Lan smiled and said, “Greetings, Young Union Master. Subordinate has been anticipating your arrival.”

Saying so, she gave an elegant salute while the cultivators behind her also bowed in greeting.

“There are no outsiders here, so why must Aunt Lan act so politely?” Gu Jian Xin smiled and spoke. It was obvious that he had a good relationship with this beautiful woman.

“Courtesy cannot be abandoned!” Aunt Lan smiled sweetly before her pair of beautiful eyes swept the figures behind Gu Jian Xin, greeting Qin Wu Hui with a gentle nod then fixing on Yang Kai for a moment, a hint of suspicion flashing across her face.

She was naturally familiar with all of Gu Jian Xin’s important subordinates, but Yang Kai was a new face, which she found strange. Using her Divine Sense, she swept Yang Kai and discovered that he was actually a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, confusing her slightly more.

“It’s windy outside, let’s go inside before we talk further,” Gu Jian Xin did not immediately introduce Yang Kai to this beautiful woman and instead made such a proposal.

A gleam flitted across Aunt Lan’s eyes before she smiled and nodded, “Alright. This way, Young Union Master.”

Saying so, she led the way.

Azure Tree Palace was a symbolic building of Azure Tree Star, the headquarters established by Sword Union on Azure Tree Star to manage Azure Tree Star. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yang Kai followed quietly while observing this beautiful woman named Aunt Lan.

Although he did not release his Divine Sense to investigate carefully, judging from the aura he felt from this beautiful woman, he was certain that she was an Origin King!

Thinking about it though, this was appropriate. Azure Tree Star was a critical Cultivation Star to Sword Union, so it was only natural that an Origin King Realm would be stationed here to preside over it. This beautiful woman named Aunt Lan should be a First-Order Origin King cultivator, because her aura had similar power to Li Ming Hai’s while it a far cry from Luo Hai’s.

The Azure Tree Palace occupied a wide area and after entering it and dispersing the miscellaneous people, Gu Jian Xin finally made introductions.

Through Gu Jian Xin’s introduction, Yang Kai learned that this beautiful woman was named Luo Lan, and she was indeed a First-Order Origin King as he suspected.

“Aunt Lan is the Star Master of Azure Tree Star and is responsible for all of Sword Union’s matters here!” Gu Jian Xin said.

“Star Master?” Yang Kai’s face changed slightly.

“Haha, it’s not what Brother Yang thinks,” Gu Jian Xin seemed to already know what Yang Kai was reacting to and explained with a smile, “This Star Master is not the kind of Star Master you imagine, it’s just a title.”

“So, it’s just a title,” Yang Kai felt relieved; after all, from what he knew, essentially all Star Masters were Third-Order Origin Kings, as only they seemed capable of refining a Star Source somewhat safely.

Luo Hai becoming Star Master of Green Mountains Star was entirely thanks to luck, and Yang Yan was the one who helped Yang Kai become Star Master of Shadowed Star.

Luo Lan was just a First-Order Origin King, so if she had managed to become a genuine Star Master, it could only be said that she obtained the greatest of opportunities!

However, if it was just a title given to her, it was not such a big deal. Any Origin King sent by Sword Union to oversee Azure Tree Star would receive the title of Star Master.

This Star Master was nothing more than a status indicator and did not come with the conveniences and advantages a true Star Master should have.

“Little brother seems quite surprised, could it be you’ve met a Star Master before?” Luo Lan was a woman with keen intuition and immediately inferred something from the changes in Yang Kai’s expression.

“En... I had the honour of meeting Sir Luo Hai on Green Mountains Star a few years ago,” Yang Kai casually explained.

“Sir Luo Hai...” Luo Lan murmured, “A few years ago? It seems that this brother had participated in the Blood Prison Trial.”

“En.”

“Brother Yang also participated in the Blood Prison Trial?” Gu Jian Xin was shocked as he looked at Yang Kai in amazement.

It seemed that Yang Kai having his current achievements was not simply a matter of luck. Gu Jian Xin learned from Yang Kai that he had explored the Emperor Garden, and now it seems he also underwent the Blood Prison Trial.

Surviving and returning from the two fierce lands one after another with just luck was not enough. It took true ability.

“Impressive!” Gu Jian Xin expressed his sincere admiration, cupping his fists in respect.

“Haha,” Yang Kai chuckled slightly awkwardly.

“Unfortunately, it seems that less than two years after the Blood Prison Trial, Luo Hai was killed. This incident shocked the entire Star Field,” Luo Lan muttered quietly.

“This Young Master also heard about that incident. Unexpectedly, someone like Luo Hai could be killed; who could have been responsible??

Yang Kai remained silent, his expression calm.

“By the way, Aunt Lan, I was ambushed by Li Ming Hai on my way here this time,” Gu Jian Xin changed the subject abruptly.

“What?” Luo Lan’s beautiful face paled, “Were you hurt?”

“My injuries have already healed. It was all thanks to Brother Yang’s help though, otherwise, I’m afraid I would have met disaster.”

“Him?” Luo Lan glanced at Yang Kai suspiciously. Although she was not sure what happened, since Gu Jian Xin said that Yang Kai helped him escape danger, she naturally would not question him and said with a serious expression, “Many thanks for offering your aid, little brother. This Queen will certainly repay you for your efforts.”

“Senior is too polite, Brother Gu and I are like old friends. It was just some trivial assistance, nothing worth mentioning,” Yang Kai said modestly.

“Trivial...” Luo Lan’s expression became extremely weird.

Being ambushed by an Origin King was no trivial matter, and she could almost imagine the great risks involved. If one thing had gone wrong, Gu Jian Xin would likely not be standing in front of her right now, already buried in a remote corner of the Star Field.

“Where is that bastard Li Ming Hai now?” Luo Lan turned her gaze to Gu Jian Xin again as a cold murderous intent flashed across her beautiful eyes, “Daring to do such a thing, there will be no place for him in the Star Field again!”

“He’s dead!” Gu Jian Xin quickly said.

Luo Lan’s jaw dropped and only after a short silence did she ask, “How did he die?”

Gu Jian Xin only glanced over at Yang Kai as a response.

Luo Lan once again turned a suspicious gaze towards him.

Yang Kai smiled harmlessly and said, “I only gave him a sneak attack while he was concentrated on fighting Brother Gu.”

Luo Lan was again a little speechless but soon smiled and said, “Little brother conceals himself quite well.”

“He simply let success get to his head at the time,” Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders.

Seeing his casual expression, Luo Lan immediately knew that Yang Kai did not want to talk about this topic anymore, so she smartly advanced the conversation, “Since even Li Ming Hai died, the situation can be considered closed; however, Young Master being able to escape this time was only thanks to a fortunate encounter with a noble person who provided assistance. You cannot act so recklessly in the future.”

“I know,” Gu Jian Xin nodded solemnly, “Oh yeah, Aunt Lan, I brought Brother Yang here this time mainly to consult with you about something.”

“Oh, what?”

“Brother Yang wants to build a palace on Azure Tree Star and needs a plot of land about a hundred thousand kilometres across, does Aunt Lan have any appropriate locations?”

“A hundred thousand kilometres...” Luo Lan pondered for a moment before saying, “There are many options, but I do not know what kind of location little brother would prefer, so why don’t we discuss this matter while consulting Azure Tree Star’s map tomorrow?”

“Sound good. I shall trouble you, Senior.”

“Little brother need not be so polite. You saved Young Master’s life, so a hundred-thousand-kilometre territory is nothing to Sword Union.”

“Junior will take his leave first then. I look forward to meeting you again tomorrow, Senior,” Yang Kai knew that Gu Jian Xin brought him over to meet Luo Lan and discuss his request for a piece of land, but now that introductions were finished these two certainly had other confidential matters to discuss which were not appropriate for him to overhear.

“I’ll see you out,” Gu Jian Xin gestured before leading Yang Kai out.

Outside, a maidservant was assigned to lead Yang Kai to a guest room in the Azure Tree Palace to rest.

After Yang Kai left, Luo Lan released her Divine Sense and opened the many barriers around the room to ensure no one could spy on this place before asking solemnly, “Young Master, that Yang Kai... is he credible?”

“En, according to my observations along the way, he has nothing to do with Sword Union and him appearing where Li Ming Hai was lying in ambush for me was simply a coincidence. It was Li Ming Hai who launched a sneak attack on him first.”

“He managed to survive a sneak attack from Li Ming Hai?” Luo Lan’s expression changed slightly.

“I don’t know how he managed that,” Gu Jian Xin slowly shook his head, “However, there is no doubt about his strength. What he said before was simply giving me face. Li Ming Hai dying was almost entirely thanks to him, and although part of the reason was him successfully launching a sneak attack.... Aunt Lan, you’ve lived many years, but have you ever heard of an Origin Realm cultivator killing an Origin King before?”
