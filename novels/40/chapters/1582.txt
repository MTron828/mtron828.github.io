What was most terrifying about Yang Kai, however, was as the battle continued, his momentum only grew stronger and stronger along with the power behind each of his fists. At this point, in the heat of the battle, Xue Lian felt as if he was losing the initiative.

Initially, their strengths were even, but after engaging in a fierce battle for a cup of tea worth of time, Xue Lian was beginning to feel somewhat suppressed.

[What was happening here? Could it be that this human had been holding back his full strength?]

Xue Lian’s expression became more and more solemn as his face twisted in rage.

He was a Heaven-sent genius, a dazzling, rising star on Monster Emperor Star! He did not fear facing strong enemies, instead his blood drove him to fight even more fiercely. Only by killing powerful masters could he prove his own strength!

He finally became interested in Yang Kai!

“Yu Xiong, what happened?” A few thousand metres away from the battlefield, on the roof of the palace, Shan Qing Luo suddenly appeared, her brow furrowed deeply as she asked anxiously while looking at the battle down below.

With such a loud disturbance, how could she have not noticed? Realizing that the fluctuations of a battle were emanating from Xia Ning Chang’s palace, she immediately flew over, and the scene she was greeted with was Yang Kai and Xue Lian engaging in a bloody struggle.

“Why is Yang Kai fighting Xue Lian? Didn’t Xue Lian just arrive a few days ago?” Shan Qing Luo asked suspiciously. If Yang Kai were fighting Mi Tian, ​​she could still understand; after all, there was already a grudge between the two of them. Yang Kai had killed Mi Tian’s two Ninth-Order Monster Beasts, and with Mi Tian’s personality, how could he simply let such an insult pass?

But Yang Kai and Xue Lian had clearly never met before and there was no deep hatred between them, so how did they suddenly end up in a life or death battle?

“I don’t know,” Yu Xiong shrank his head and waved his hand quickly, indicating that this matter had nothing to do with him, but his shifting eyes were not missed by Shan Qing Luo.

“You really don’t know anything?” Shan Qing Luo squinted at Yu Xiong, a cold light flashing across her eyes.

“En, en...I really don’t know...”

“I’ll ask you one last time, what’s this all about!” Shan Qing Luo grit her teeth and shouted.

Yu Xiong’s face turned bitter as he looked at Shan Qing Luo mournfully, a sad expression on his face as he kept his mouth shut.

“It really is your fault!” Shan Qing Luo was furious, her chest heaving up and down. Xue Lian was no ordinary Monster Race master, and whether Yang Kai won or lost against him, the end result would be bad.

After realizing that all of this was planned out by Yu Xiong, Shan Qing Luo could not wait to dismember this cheap older brother of hers to vent her anger.

“I really didn’t do anything...” Yu Xiong scratched his head awkwardly, “Xue Lian came to the palace three days ago and I was just bragging about the Alchemy skills of Grandmaster Xia in front of him and Mi Tian. It just happened to be that Xue Lian wanted a certain pill refined, so...”

Shan Qing Luo did not say a word and just grit her teeth as he glared at Yu Xiong.

“It’s not Big Brother’s fault! Big Brother originally wanted to push Mi Tian to take action, but that hateful guy was too cunning and somehow manipulated Xue Lian into being the one to attack. En, if we really want to get to the bottom of this, it’s little sister’s fault.”

“My fault?” Shan Qing Luo screamed, her anger growing even more intense.

Yu Xiong felt like he was sitting on pins and needles as he anxious said, “You said that big brother couldn’t take action personally, but figuring out this little brat’s depths was a order from Adoptive Mother, so Big Brother spend three days and three nights wracking his brain before finally coming up with this plan! If you had just let Big Brother take care of this himself, I would definitely hold back to not hurt him; after all, nominally, he’s my brother-in-law, hahahaha!”

“So this is all my fault?” Shan Qing Luo flashed a smile that was in no way a smile.

“No no, it’s all Big Brother’s fault,” Yu Xiong readily admitted his mistake. He knew that if he pushed his luck any further, he would not have a good end, so he simply decided to play hoodlum while asking for his little sister’s forgiveness.

“If anything happens to my man, you’re dead!” Shan Qing Luo ground her teeth as she shouted.

“No need to be so anxious, Lady Qing Luo!” At that moment, a voice suddenly called out from the side.

Both Shan Qing Luo and Yu Xiong were shocked and quickly turned their heads to look at the source of the sound only to discover that at some point Ba He had arrived beside them.

As expected from the strongest master below the Origin King Realm on Monster Emperor Star! It seemed that after concealing himself for two hundred years, not only had his cultivation not regressed, but it had instead grown stronger!

Yu Xiong and Shan Qing Luo were both in awe and hurriedly saluted.

“Senior, what you said just now... Are you optimistic about Yang Kai’s chances?” Shan Qing Luo stared at Ba He with her beautiful eyes and asked with an excited expression.

Although she too had reached the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, which was the same as Ba He, when it came to vision and insight, she had no way to compare with the other party, so Ba He’s assurances just now had allowed her to calm down significantly.

Ba He chuckled and shook his head, “I didn’t say that, but... he’s not someone easy to deal with. Xue Lian probably has no way to defeat him. En, in his current state that is!”

After saying so, Ba He let out a sigh, “Truly incredible, the present younger generation is really amazing. This boy is only a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator but he is actually able to fight Xue Lian to a draw. When he breaks through to the Third-Order, Xue Lian will certainly not be his opponent!”

Shan Qing Luo immediately beamed as she felt a deep sense of pride.

This was the man she had chosen! He was truly extraordinary!

Back then in the Central Capital, even with his weak cultivation, he had managed to kick up a storm. At that time, he often created miracles, and after several dozen years had passed, it seemed he had only grown more amazing!

Xue Lian was no ordinary Monster Race master. He had a powerful record and was a top-notch presence in the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm.

Shan Qing Luo’s beautiful eyes flashed brilliantly as her heart filled with pride, as if there was nothing Yang Kai could not do.

“Senior, did you just say that Xue Lian can’t defeat him in his current state?” Yu Xiong however paid more attention to the other meaning behind Ba He’s words.

“En, Xue Lian hasn’t used his full strength yet as he hasn’t stimulated the power of his Blood Flood Dragon lineage,” Ba He explained with a smile.

Hearing what he said, Shan Qing Luo could not stop her pretty face from darkening again, suddenly realizing this problem.

Yu Xiong glanced over at Shan Qing Luo cautiously before asking, “Then Senior, if Xue Lian goes all out, can my brother-in-law resist him?”

“I don’t know,” Ba He smiled faintly, “I don’t know the details of this boy. If this is the extent of his abilities, then he should be unable to stop Xue Lian, but if he has other cards to play then the end results of this battle will be difficult to determine. En, in my opinion though, in terms of pure physical strength, Xue Lian should be able to emerge victorious.”

“En, Junior agrees,” Yu Xiong nodded in agreement.

However, a human who was a Minor Realm lower in cultivation being able to compete with Xue Lian like this was more than enough to be proud of.

The assignment Yu Xiong and Shan Qing Luo’s adoptive mother had given him could be completed perfectly like this. After such a performance, Chi Yue should have no problem accepting Yang Kai. However, this little brat having other women was something their adoptive mother would absolutely not allow; how could his little sister possibly share her man with other women?

“Little Sister, rest assured. If things get dangerous, Big Brother will intervene to separate them,” Yu Xiong said comfortingly.

Shan Qing Luo just shot him a vicious look, however, causing Yu Xiong to laugh dryly.

“Hm, golden blood?” Ba He suddenly cried out in surprise as he stared at Yang Kai fixedly, a look of shock flashing across his face.

He discovered that the blood flowing from Yang Kai’s wounds was a pale gold in colour...

This was not a colour of blood a human should have. Did that mean he carried some kind of incredible bloodline that allowed him to compete with Xue Lian in physical strength?

But... what kind of bloodline could produce golden blood?

This blood that exuded a pale golden shimmer seemed to contain a potent vitality that would rapidly heal any wound on Yang Kai’s body, restoring his cracked skin and bruised physique in the blink of an eye.

[How could he have such powerful restorative ability?] Ba He was dumbfounded and involuntarily leaned forward a little, as if waiting to see the situation more clearly.

A few thousand metres away, the bloody battle continued.

Yang Kai and Xue Lian were both covered in light gold and red blood as they continued to entangle with one another.

*Hong Hong Hong...*

An intensive thundering suddenly erupted from the spot where the two were fighting and after a shockwave spread out, Yang Kai and Xue Lian separated.

The eyes of these two remained as sharp as ever, neither caring about their injuries as they stared at one another coldly.

“Human, you’re extraordinary, I take back my boasts from before, you’re a good opponent!” Xue Lian took a deep breath and shouted in a deep voice.

“Indeed!” Yang Kai grinned, “You on the other hand don’t seem to be worth much.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Xue Lian laughed, “You’re arrogant enough, I’ll give you that. This Young Lord hasn’t met a human like you for a long time. The last human who dared talk to me like this was torn limb from limb by me. I hope you can hold on a bit longer than he did so we can have some more fun!”

As his words fell, Xue Lian’s exposed skin suddenly oozed drops of red blood, and as soon as these droplets appeared, they exploded into a blood mist which quickly enveloped Xue Lian.

Xue Lian’s aura, which was already incredibly violent, suddenly surged upwards.

In an instant, Xue Lian turned into a blood man, his entire body dyed red, giving him an incredibly terrifying appearance.

The blood mist swirled around him before suddenly condensing into scales which covered his skin.

At the same time, on Xue Lian’s forehead, two majestic crimson horns sprouted.

“Flood Dragon Transformation!” Ba He muttered in a low voice, his expression growing serious.

Shan Qing Luo’s expression also became tense while Yu Xiong’s grew solemn.

Xue Lian was the son of the Blood Flood Dragon Tribal Lord and possessed the bloodline of the Blood Flood Dragon, the most powerful Monster Race lineage on Monster Emperor Star, a fact that was acknowledged by all Monster Race cultivators.

After displaying his Flood Dragon Transformation, Xue Lian’s strength increased by about thirty percent; it was a core Secret Technique of the Blood Flood Dragon clan.

This kind of Secret Technique was one many powerful Monster Race masters possessed, but the increase in strength it could grant when used heavily depended on one’s bloodline.

The current Xue Lian’s momentum was completely different compared to just a moment ago. As a fierce and invisible aura spread outwards from him, it caused the world itself to tremble.

The blood all over his body seemed to be boiling and burning as a bright red aura enveloped him. The remaining red mist twisted and changed its form, rising into the sky like a flame, making him look like a burning fireball.

Xue Lian was going all out!
