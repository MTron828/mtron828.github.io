“Don’t be fooled, Zi Yu’s Primordial Yin is still there. She’s still pure!” Yao Zhuo gently whispered in Feng Xi’s ear.

Hearing his words, a strange light flashed in Feng Xi’s eyes as he swept Zi Yu from head to toe, confirming that Yao Zhuo was telling the truth. Her Primordial Yin was still there, so she had to be a virgin; however, he was unable to get over these negative emotions as Zi Yu was still holding Yang Kai’s hand!

The scene unfolding before his eyes was enough to humiliate any man, let alone Seeking Passion Sect’s Young Sect Master!

The woman that he had taken a fancy to was being so intimate with another man. This was no longer Feng Xi’s personal problem. If word of this were to get out, his Sect’s reputation would take a huge hit.

“Boy, who are you? You unexpectedly dare to mess with my Seeking Passion Sect! Aren’t you afraid of dying?” Yao Zhuo coldly glared at Yang Kai, his murderous intent seeping out. He knew that today’s matter had to be processed well, otherwise not only would it damage the Sect’s face, it would leave Feng Xi with a heart demon. The best method to solve this situation was to let Feng Xi kill Yang Kai personally. Still, they were in Ice Heart Valley, and it was inappropriate to take action before getting a better understanding of the situation.

The group of Emperor Realm Masters from Ice Heart Valley looked at Yang Kai with curiosity, wondering about his identity. This man had suddenly appeared in Ice Heart Valley and was now so intimate with Zi Yu. Even Zi Yu’s Honoured Master, An Ruo Yun, wasn’t clear about the situation.

She’d never heard Zi Yu mention this man.

“I came here to take Junior Sister Yu away. What does this have to do with being enemies with your Seeking Passion Sect? Senior, aren’t your words too biased? You’re supposed to be impartial!” Yang Kai snorted and continued, “Moreover, this is Ice Heart Valley. How is this matter related to your Seeking Passion Sect?”

“How dare you call her Junior Sister Yu!” Feng Xi was furious.

Yang Kai’s eyes stopped for a moment before he said coldly, “It’s none of your business what I call her. Why are you barking so loudly?”

The flames of anger in Feng Xi’s belly were about to burn his whole body. He looked at Yao Zhuo and boldly declared, “Martial Uncle, I want him dead!”

In his whole life, he’d never felt so humiliated. The woman he liked was grasping another man’s hand on her own initiative, and that man was so arrogant. If he didn’t kill him, how could he get rid of the hatred in his heart?

Yang Kai sneered, “You want to kill me? There were many like you in the past, but they’re all dead now!”

“This brat is certainly arrogant enough!” Yao Zhuo’s face darkened, fire almost spewing out from his eyes as he sent out his Emperor Pressure to suppress Yang Kai.

The Emperor Realm Masters from Ice Heart Valley were also surprised. Yang Kai was just a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, but he dared to be so bold in front of them. It was unknown if he cultivated until becoming crazy, or if he was someone who didn’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth.

Yang Kai stood in place and groaned lightly, seemingly short of breath due to Yao Zhuo’s aura. He inhaled through his nose and began speaking politely, “Forgive me. I’m young and ignorant, and not too skilled in the art of conversation.”

Hearing his words, all the women frowned. It seemed that Yang Kai wasn’t that fearless in the end. When they saw him being so arrogant before, they thought that he was someone with an unyielding spirit, but after Yao Zhuo threatened him, he immediately piped down. He didn’t sound like someone you could trust. If he hadn’t changed his stance, they might have looked at him with respect, but seeing him compromise so quickly, they all assumed he was the type that bullied the weak and feared the strong.

Some among them sighed faintly, feeling sorry for Zi Yu.

Perhaps she was blinded by love and failed to see his true colours, because compared to Feng Xi, this young man was nothing. At the very least, Feng Xi was Seeking Passion Sect’s Young Sect Master, and his status was something ordinary people couldn’t hope to match. Even if Zi Yu could no longer advance on the path of cultivation after marrying him, she wouldn’t suffer any hardships. Who knew, perhaps she’d even find happiness in the future.

But if she got together with someone like Yang Kai, her future looked bleak…

Yang Kai calmly looked at Yao Zhuo and Feng Xi before smiling strangely and continuing, “My words aren’t always pleasant to the ear. If I have offended you just now… You dogs are free to come here and bite me!”

The whole audience was stunned.

Everyone from Ice Heart Valley opened their eyes wide, staring at Yang Kai in disbelief. They couldn’t believe their ears. In the meantime, Yao Zhuo and Feng Xi’s faces went black as they were absolutely furious.

Yao Zhuo turned to Sun Yun Xiu, “Great Elder, is it a problem if Xi’er kills him?”

He didn’t ask Valley Master An Ruo Yun, but asked Sun Yun Xiu directly, as he knew of An Ruo Yun’s weak personality, and knew it was useless to seek her approval.

The reason he wanted Feng Xi to take action personally was for the latter’s sake. Seeing Yang Kai and Zi Yu like this, a heart demon had already started to form in Feng Xi. Only by killing Yang Kai with his hands could he get rid of this heart demon and prevent it from affecting his cultivation in the future. As the name suggested, Seeking Passion Sect’s Seeking Passion Supreme Art revolved around passion. While cultivating, one had to bring out their real feelings to move their partner’s heart.

Hearing Yao Zhuo’s words, Sun Yun Xiu’s face darkened and she coldly snorted, “We are in Ice Heart Valley right now, and we will decide who lives and who dies. There is no need for the Vice Sect Master and Young Sect Master of Seeking Passion Sect to take action!”

Her cold words surprised Yang Kai.

He thought that Sun Yun Xiu was someone who leaned toward Seeking Passion Sect, and had agreed to marry Zi Yu off for benefits. Generally speaking, this type of person would try to please the Seeking Passion Sect at every turn; however, Sun Yun Xiu didn’t give Yao Zhuo any face and rejected him immediately. So, what was going on?

But even if Sun Yun Xiu didn’t give Yao Zhuo any face, she didn’t have a favourable impression of Yang Kai as this whole mess was his fault. When she turned to look at him, her face was filled with murderous intent.

She was about to say something when An Ruo Yun interjected, “Young man… Just now, you said that someone asked you to take Zi Yu away. On whose request are you acting?”

There was no deep meaning behind her words. She asked this question because she knew her Second Junior Sister’s personality. If she didn’t say something to carry the conversation forward, Sun Yun Xiu would definitely attack Yang Kai.

Given her strength as a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master, Yang Kai would have no ability to defend himself if Sun Yun Xiu decided to attack him.

Whether Yang Kai was here on someone’s order or because he loved Zi Yu and wanted to elope with her, An Ruo Yun hoped to see him succeed. Zi Yu was her precious disciple, and she had taken care of her since she was a child. If not because she was forced to, how could she agree to this marriage? She even went as far as to secretly help Zi Yu escape. Unfortunately, fate was not on her side, and Zi Yu was caught and brought back here.

Yang Kai respected An Ruo Yun as she was Zi Yu’s Master and Ice Heart Valley’s Valley Master, but due to her extremely gentle disposition, she wasn’t suitable to lead the Sect.

A real leader had to be impartial, iron-willed, and decisive, yet An Ruo Yun possessed none of these attributes. Perhaps this was one of the reasons Ice Heart Valley was bullied by the Seeking Passion Sect and was unable to fight back.

Yang Kai cupped his fists, “Senior An, Junior is here on Senior Bing Yun’s orders. I was entrusted by her to take Junior Sister Yu away from this place.”

“Boy, what did you just say?!”

All the Emperor Realm Masters from Ice Heart Valley went into an uproar, calling out in alarm one after another. Several pairs of beautiful eyes locked onto Yang Kai’s body, trembling slightly. Sun Yun Xiu’s body darted forward, appearing in front of Yang Kai in an instant as she grabbed his shoulders, shouting through gritted teeth, “Boy… repeat what you just said!”

“You’re hurting me!” Yang Kai glanced at his shoulder and said coldly, his face indifferent, not seeming to be in any kind of pain.

Sun Yun Xiu was enraged and was about to blow her top, but she then thought of something and suppressed her anger. Taking a deep breath and letting go of Yang Kai, she took a step back on her own initiative and simply stared at him with both expectation and anxiety.

The other Emperor Realm Masters were the same.

Yang Kai looked around and said loudly, “I came here on Senior Bing Yun’s orders. She asked me to take Junior Sister Yu away.”

“Master…” An Ruo Yun was finally able to confirm that she wasn’t hearing things. Just now, Yang Kai did really say the name ‘Bing Yun’. This name had lingered in her mind for the past three thousand years, along with the memories of her Master leading her on the path of cultivation step by step. Back then, she was free from worries and could find shade under the big tree that was her Master’s back. She only had to cultivate and worry about nothing else.

As time passed, the scenery remained unchanged, but the same was not true for the people. Ice Heart Valley was still Ice Heart Valley, but her Master was no longer there.

People in the outside world had started to suspect that her Master had died. Even many disciples in the Sect had tacitly accepted this fact.

But now, she finally heard some news about her Master from Yang Kai. An Ruo Yun felt as if the blood in her chest was rushing to her head as she asked weakly, “Master… how is she?”

Her beautiful eyes looked at Yang Kai with expectation, eagerly waiting for his answer.

Yang Kai sneered, “Senior Bing Yun discovered that you were pushing your best disciple into a pit of fire, so her mood is anything but good at the moment!”

Hearing this, all the women were dejected, guilt filling their faces. They didn’t dare to look Yang Kai in the eyes anymore.

“Impossible! Impossible!” Sun Yun Xiu started shouting as if she’d gone mad. Her eyes turned red as she glared at Yang Kai, stepping forward again and roaring, “If Master was really here, why didn’t she come here personally? Why did she send a man to Ice Heart Valley? If you’re lying, this Queen will kill you!”

“Second Martial Aunt, he’s telling the truth. Senior Brother Yang was really sent here by Ancestral Founder.” Seeing the murderous intent on Sun Yun Xiu’s face, Zi Yu hurried to stand in front of Yang Kai.

This scene left Feng Xi even more heartbroken.
