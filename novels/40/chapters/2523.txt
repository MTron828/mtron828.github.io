“Forty-sixty, no more than that.” Ju Tian Qing offered with a cold face, “Although this Ju can most likely break through to the Second-Order Emperor Realm after this, there are so many spirit grasses and elixirs here and it’s just a matter of time before Brother Zu breaks through too. You’ll not lose out in this arrangement!”

After pondering for a while, Zu Hong nodded as a trace of determination flashed in his eyes, “Good, we will do as Brother Ju proposed.”

Zu Hong knew that Ju Tian Qing definitely had the advantage in the forty-sixty terms, but Ju Tian Qing was an Elder of Brahma Holy Land after all. Once Ju Tian Qing had broken through, he would grow a lot more powerful. Doing him a favour now meant Zu Hong would be on better terms with him in the future.

Gao Xue Ting could not help trembling in anger as she heard these two bargaining over her like some marketplace commodity; however, she could do nothing even if she was enraged as she did not even have the power to protect herself.

“Forty-sixty? I’m afraid that’s not acceptable.”

A sudden voice interrupted both Zu Hong and Ju Tian Qing, causing them to jump as they turned to look at the source of the sound in horror. Zu Hong, who was in the process of recovering, stood up abruptly and the radiance of the Emperor Artifact Ten Thousand Beast Seal shone lightly beside him, releasing a vicious aura.

This was a Small Sealed World hidden in The Void. If the restriction was not opened by the two halves of the animal skin, no one could enter. They could come in only because the two pieces of animal skin had opened a Void Corridor for them to pass through.

Nevertheless, another visitor had suddenly appeared.

Even Zu Hong and Ju Tian Qing, who were Emperor Realm Masters, could not help feeling a chill running down their spines.

[Is it a ghost?] The two of them murmured in their hearts.

After hearing this voice though, Gao Xue Ting, who had been in despair, shook as her dull eyes beamed with hope again, focusing in the direction of the voice. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

A young man appeared about a few dozen meters away from the trio, smiling lightly. No one realized his presence before he spoke, as if he really was a ghost.

“Who are you!?” Zu Hong shouted.

Ju Tian Qing furrowed his brow as he released his Divine Sense to scan Yang Kai, soon figuring out that he was just a First-Order Emperor Realm Master like them, allowing him to slightly relax.

No matter how this person came in, or what his purpose was, as long as his cultivation was the same or below him, Ju Tian Qing was not afraid.

“City Lord Zu, Elder Ju,” Yang Kai cupped his fist and smiled at them, like he knew them for a long time, “Long time no see.”

Zu Hong was flabbergasted, examining Yang Kai seriously once again to confirm he did not know him, soon asking again, “Who are you?”

Yang Kai smiled faintly, “My trivial name is not worth mentioning.”

Zu Hong was steaming in rage, but he knew that there was no use asking again since this person did not want to reveal his name. Calming down, his expression turned serious as he asked, “How did you get in?”

Previously, when Ju Tian Qing and Gao Xue Ting worked together to enter, Ju Tian Qing had quietly left a secret way in for Zu Hong, and that was the reason why he could enter this place; however, he did not understand how Yang Kai could get in here.

[Did he use the secret entrance too?]

[It can’t be. Only Ju Tian Qing and I know how to enter using that method. Others can’t know of it. There are supposed to be a few Legacy Disciples of Ju Tian Qing guarding outside.]

[If this guy can appear here in silence, perhaps the people outside are already dead.]

Considering all this, Zu Hong panicked and he secretly glanced at Ju Tian Qing, only to find that his expression was indifferent, as if he did not care about the safety of his disciples at all.

“Looks like this friend has outstanding ability to be able to find us here. This King is impressed!” Ju Tian Qing stared at Yang Kai coldly. Even though his words said so, his face did not show the slightest bit of admiration. “Friend remarked that there is something wrong with the forty-sixty arrangement, may I know if you have any other brilliant ideas?” He came straight to the point.

Yang Kai replied lazily, “I wouldn’t call it a brilliant idea, it’s just a small proposal from me.”

“I would like to hear about it,” Ju Tian Qing’s face darkened.

“I’ll take everything here, and you two scram back to wherever you come from. What do you think?” Yang Kai beamed at them.

“Impudence!” Zu Hong was maddened. He initially thought that this young man probably just wanted a share of the harvest. If it was just that, Zu Hong would grant his wish for now as it was always not too late to get revenge later. However, he did not expect that this young man would be so greedy, intending to take everything for himself.

Then what was the purpose of him following Ju Tian Qing all the way here, and even offending an Azure Sun Temple Elder? He could never accept this proposal. Everyone was a First-Order Emperor, so he was not afraid of fighting against Yang Kai. Moreover, he had Ju Tian Qing with him, while Yang Kai was alone.

Ju Tian Qing was infuriated too and snorted coldly, “Friend, you sure have a big appetite. You should mind your table manners.”

Yang Kai’s face darkened and a cold brilliance shone in his eyes as he spoke, “Old dog, mind your words. If you offend this Young Master, don’t blame me for disrespecting you elders.”

“Very good!” Ju Tian Qing laughed in anger, “This King really wants to see how capable you are for having the guts to boast so shamelessly.”

“Stop putting up a front,” Yang Kai burst into laughter, and looked at him contemptuously, “Elder Ju, don’t tell me you don’t know this Young Master. Even your disciples were able to recognize this Young Master at a glance, while you, as an Elder of Brahma Holy Land, are still trying to pretend this is the first time you’ve seen my face? Tsk tsk, what are you plotting?”

“Huh? Brother Ju, do you know this little brat?” Zu Hong looked at Ju Tian Qing in surprise.

Ju Tian Qing’s face turned ugly after being exposed by Yang Kai, and he replied in a deep voice, “I do. This little brat is named Yang Kai, and he is the murderer of Zhang Hao and Zhang Xian in the Shattered Star Sea. He is an enemy of my Brahma Holy Land. It is impossible for us to coexist beneath the same sky!”

“What? Both Zhang Hao and Zhang Xian Holy Sons died at his hand?” Zu Hong was appalled.

Besides the news about the closing of the Shattered Star Sea for no reason, Zu Hong was also informed that Brahma Holy Land had suffered a huge loss this time. The death of two Holy Sons alone was enough to damage the foundation of Brahma Holy Land as they were both talented rising stars who could only be found once in a hundred years. Both of these Holy Songs were highly valued by the Elders of Brahman Holy Land and were considered its future pillars.

No one could have guessed their trip to the Shattered Star Sea would be their last.

Only at this moment did Zhu Hong learn that the two Holy Sons died at Yang Kai’s hands.

But soon, realization dawned on Zu Hong, and he questioned with a puzzled look, “Since this little brat just came out of the Shattered Star Sea, doesn’t that mean that he has just broken through to the Emperor Realm?”

“Yes, that should be the case,” Ju Tian Qing nodded lightly.

Zu Hong snorted as he turned a disdainful look towards Yang Kai, “Little brat, your courage is admirable. How dare you bark in front of this City Lord and Elder Ju when you only just reached the Emperor Realm? I pity… your limited intelligence.”

One should be focused on consolidating their foundation after breaking through to a new Great Realm, as, if it was unstable, there was a risk of one’s cultivation regressing. Zu Hong wondered why Yang Kai was still running around at this time instead of solidifying his new Emperor Realm cultivation in retreat and questioned how his Sect Elders had been teaching him.

In an instant, Yang Kai turned into an arrogant and ignorant kid in Zu Hong’s eyes, and he replaced his bewildered face with one of contempt.

Yang Kai turned a deaf ear to his words and looked at Elder Ju as he continued, “Elder Ju, I want to clarify something with you.”

“What?” Ju Tian Qing’s face was cold.

Yang Kai continued with a smile, “I don’t mind if you say that Zhang Hao died in my hands, because I really killed him, but Zhang Xian’s death is none of my business. Besides… before Zhang Xian died, he was the one who begged me to kill Zhang Hao to avenge him. Ahhh seriously, I don’t know what kind of conflict there was between your Sect’s two Holy Sons that they would wish earnestly for each other’s deaths even as they died. You know, I’m a soft-hearted person, so I felt obliged to fulfil the last wishes of those whom I meet, so I killed Zhang Hao for Zhang Xian in order to allow him to die in peace.”

“Utter nonsense!” Ju Tian Qing was furious, “Zhang Hao and Zhang Xian were very close to each other. Although they are not direct brothers, their bonds were even stronger than that. Zhang Xian would never let you kill Zhang Hao!”

Yang Kai snorted coldly, “It’s up to you to believe it or not.”

Ju Tian Qing took a deep breath to calm down his anger before pressing on in a cold voice, “Since you have entered here, this King’s useless disciples outside…”

“I don’t know. Probably dead.” Yang Kai grinned.

He was confident in Zhang Ruo Xi’s strength. Even if she could not win against them, she would still not be hurt with the Pink Clouds Phoenix Robe that she possessed, and if the terrifying power hidden in her bloodline was forced out, the few disciples of Ju Tian Qing would be in trouble.

In short, the disciples of Ju Tian Qing were heading for a disaster.

“Good! The two Holy Sons died at your hands, and this King’s disciples died at your hands too. Now that you have brought yourself here, then don’t you think about leaving alive!”

Ju Tian Qing was infuriated and his whole body exuded a rich murderous intent. As soon as he pushed his Emperor Qi, a dense Emperor Intent burst out like an explosion, causing the World Principles in this Small Sealed World to shake. He slightly shook the blade in his hand and slashed towards Yang Kai.

Witnessing such a hot exchange of words between Yang Kai and Ju Tian Qing, Zu Hong knew that it was inevitable to have a battle, but with both him and Ju Tian Qing cooperating, he did not put Yang Kai in his eyes at all.

Furthermore, why should he be afraid of a young man who has just broken through to the Emperor Realm?

During this recent period, many rising stars had gained opportunities in the Shattered Star Sea and broken through their shackles to become Emperor Realm Masters.

But how could these newly promoted Emperors compare with veteran Masters like him? Maybe they would stand a chance if they cultivated for another thirty to fifty years.

Pushing his Emperor Qi madly, roars came out of Zu Hong’s Ten Thousand Beasts Seal, causing the Small Sealed World to shake. Then, the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal released several beams of light, which turned into different Monster Beasts in mid-air.

All those Monster Beasts had a dense aura, and they were at least in the early stage of the Eleventh-Order.

With Zu Hong’s overflowing Emperor Qi, these Monster Beasts charged out endlessly from the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal and stampeded towards Yang Kai.
