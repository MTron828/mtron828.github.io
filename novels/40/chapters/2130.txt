“No need!” Yang Kai pouted.

Wen Zi Shan did not get angry but smiled. He thought for a while then said, “Then... do you want this King to help you in refining this Emperor Artifact? I noticed that you have low compatibility with this Emperor Artifact, you can’t even unleash a small portion of its power. You don’t have much time left, if you accept the help from this King, you can be assured that you can unleash ten percent of its power in the Four Seasons Realm and be invincible in the Sealed World. Interested?”

Wen Zi Shan seemed to be sincere in offering Yang Kai help.

However, Yang Kai shook his head and teased, “Temple Master Wen, are you that desperate for me to make a request?”

The corner of Wen Zi Shan’s mouth twitched after hearing this, and he whispered, “Damn it... he saw through me!”

Yang Kai burst into laughter, “This little brat will cautiously think of a request. When the time comes, I will come and ask from Temple Master Wen!”

He understood that Wen Zi Shan was a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master and also an Azure Sun Temple’s Temple Master. Even though this person seemed to be unreliable sometimes, Masters like him always kept their promises.

Wen Zi Shan had promised him he would fulfil a request that was not too excessive if he beat Xue Yi.

Yang Kai could not think of any favour that he wanted at that time, so it was better for him to keep his chip now. Maybe he would need some great help at a certain critical moment in the future.

“This little brat is too cunning!” Wen Zi Shan bitterly said. Soon after, his face turned indifferent and shrugged, “Fine, you deserve to make the call. Come and gather at Fallen Flower Peak in seven days. There will be someone guiding your departure at that time.”

“Yes!” Yang Kai nodded, cupped his fist and bowed, “Goodbye, Temple Master Wen!”

Wen Zi Shan smiled faintly. His body started to fade gradually and completely disappeared a few breaths later.

After his departure, Yang Kai frowned and glanced at the void on the other side with a bewildered expression.

He had felt that some people were hiding there, but he could not find them. However, if they were Emperor Realms, everything would make sense.

Since they did not take the initiative to reveal themselves, they were probably just here to watch the show and Yang Kai certainly would not try to cause himself any troubles. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He turned towards the ruined temple and left.

“This little brat seems to have noticed us!” Chen Qian was surprised, staring at Yang Kai’s back and spoke softly.

“I think he is just suspicious of us,” Gao Xue Ting said. “But even so, his senses are extraordinarily keen, this person is very interesting!”

“Sister Gao, do you think he was from... there?”

Gao Xue Ting turned and took a glance at her.

Chen Qian said, “If he wasn’t from there, how could he have such strength? What’s more, he has an Emperor Artifact with him! He is only just a First-Order Dao Source Realm!”

Gao Xue Ting shook his head, “If he really came from there, we would know. Still... the rising stars of this generation are really coming out more and more!”

Chen Qian nodded after hearing this, “Yeah... Princess Lan perfectly inherited the Bright Moon Ethereal Body of the Bright Moon Great Emperor and I heard that she was promoted to Dao Source Realm one year ago. She will definitely go to Four Seasons Realm this time. As for Heavenly Martial Holy Land, they seem to have someone who possesses a Yin-Yang Dual Body there. The Zhuang Bu Fan from Orthodoxy Temple doesn’t have a special physique, but he is bright and talented. Since the beginning of his cultivation, he has been challenging the stronger cultivators like they were a piece of cake and made a big name for himself at his young age. Right now, he is already a Third-Order Dao Source Realm. Although the two major chambers of commerce are mainly businessmen, they have recruited many talented people in recent years... I suddenly feel like this Southern Territory already belongs to them. Damn, I’m old...”

Gao Xue Ting was quiet. Obviously, she felt the same.

...

Yang Kai returned to his room and stepped up his efforts in refining the Emperor Artifact.

Wen Zi Shan had made it clear: After seven days, he would have to proceed to gather at Fallen Flower Peak, and there was not much time left for him.

While comprehending the knowledge and experiences that passed down by the ancestor of Qin’s Family, he was also strengthening his connection between Myriads Sword at the same time.

Wen Zi Shan was right about him not being able to unleash even a small portion of Myriads Sword’s power yet. He could severely injure Xue Yi with one move mostly due to his own strength, and only used a tiny bit of power from the Emperor Artifact.

Time flew and a few days passed.

On this day, Yang Kai was cultivating in isolation.

All of a sudden, his expression changed and he opened his eyes.

An unusual tidal force surged between the Heavens and Earth. This force was extremely mighty and mysterious, it was unpredictable.

When he listened attentively, there was a vague noise coming out of it.

Yang Kai looked solemn. He went outside of the temple with a sway of his body.

The sky was dim and the earth was hazy. There was a tremendous shadow covering the sky, and it seemed like a huge monster was flying over from above.

Yang Kai gazed with his head up and was stunned by it right on the spot.

It was a gigantic white bird flying in the sky. The white bird looked very normal, like a pigeon being magnified many times, but the pressure that came out from its body was as high as a mountain.

“What is this? A Divine Spirit?” Yang Kai was surprised and puzzled.

Looking at the flying direction of the giant pigeon, it seemed to be flying towards the Main Peak of the Azure Sun Mountain Range.

*Xiu xiu xiu...*

Many figures emerged from all directions. Apparently, they were all alarmed by this.

While on top of the Main Peak, Wen Zi Shan appeared strangely in a flash. He stared at the giant pigeon, and his usual playful face had turned serious.

After a short while, the giant pigeon flew above Wen Zi Shan.

In a flash of brilliance, the giant pigeon turned instantly into a normal-sized pigeon. The astonishing pressure and force also disappeared.

The white pigeon did not stop and sped straight at Wen Zi Shan. Wen Zi Shan did not block or dodge it, and he just stood still in place.

When the white pigeon was only about ten feet away from Wen Zi Shan, it immediately exploded into fluorescent snow. The fluorescent snow wrapped Wen Zi Shan’s whole body and immersed into his skin, then gradually disappeared.

*Whoosh whoosh whoosh...*

The crowd who followed the white pigeon closely emerged beside Wen Zi Shan one after another. They were the Emperor Realm Masters of Azure Sun Temple.

Qiu Ran frowned and stared silently at the change of Wen Zi Shan’s expression.

Chen Qian and Gao Xue Ting were standing side by side. They both seemed to know about something and quietly waited.

Among them, a middle-aged man beside Gao Xue Ting, whispered to her with a frowning face, “Elder Gao, about that thing just now... was it a messenger from that Sir?”

Gao Xue Ting nodded, “It should be, but I have only heard about it, I have never really seen it with my own eyes.”

The middle-aged man was astonished, “I can’t believe that Sir actually sent a message, does it mean that something big is about to happen?”

The crowd stayed in silence, feeling apprehensive. Everyone here was in the Emperor Realm, they would not be worried and anxious if it was just a casual matter. However, the situation changed, a messenger from that Sir had appeared in Azure Sun Temple, that Sir would never make a scene like this, if it was not for something big.

And now, Wen Zi Shan, who received the message, was the only one who learnt about the matter.

Therefore, all of them looked at Wen Zi Shan, in hope of knowing what happened.

But they could not figure out any clues from the change of Wen Zi Shan’s expression, which made them feel nervous and helpless.

After a long while, Wen Zi Shan gave out a soft breath and spoke lightly, “Who would have thought of such a thing!?”

“Sir Temple Master!” Qiu Ran was the first one who stepped forward and broke the silence of the crowd. Just when he was about to ask about it, Wen Zi Shan interrupted him and explained, “A message from Sir Heaven’s Revelations regarding the Four Seasons Realm. This time, things have changed!”

“Heaven’s Revelations Great Emperor!” the middle-aged man who spoke previously, shouted in excitement, “Is this truly from Heaven’s Revelation Great Emperor!?”

Among the Ten Great Emperors, except for a few who built the great forces of Sects and seated in the headquarters, the rest were like a hidden dragon who showed their tail but never their face. For instance, Bustling World Great Emperor, he incarnated into various forms and fooled around the world. Perhaps, a pitiful beggar who was seen along the street in the cold weather, was actually a disguised Bustling World Great Emperor.

If someone was being kind enough to give him a hand, he or she would receive a great blessing from him in return.

Heaven’s Revelation Great Emperor was equally unpredictable.

Since he was titled the name of Heaven’s Revelations, he had the ability that none of the Great Emperors could possess. Heaven’s Revelations Great Emperor had the ability to see through time, he could see the past and foresee the future! It was the most mysterious Divine Ability of all Great Emperors.

Although most of the people knew that he lived in the Valley of Heaven’s Secret, no one knew where this place was, not even a clue of which part of the Star Boundary it was at!

“Four Seasons Realm... Why would it bother Sir Heaven’s Revelations to take action?” Qiu Ran was bewildered.

Four Seasons Realm, this particular Sealed World was relatively renowned in Southern Territory, but it did not involve the entire Star Field. According to the character of Heaven’s Revelations Great Emperor, he would not bother to lay his hand on matters in such a middle class Sealed World.

“That’s why I said, the situation changed!” Wen Zi Shan said with a frowny face, “Four Seasons Realm this time... has a connection with the Shattered Star Sea!”

“What?” Qiu Ran exclaimed.

“Shattered Star Sea?” the pretty face of Gao Xue Ting slightly changed.

Shattered Star Sea was a place kept secret, only a few people, including masters of Emperor Realm knew exactly where it was. Shattered Star Sea can be found in The Void Crack of the Star Boundary, but it did not have a fixed location.

And Shattered Star Sea was the place where the well-known Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was buried.

It could even be said that Shattered Star Sea was born due to the death of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor.

Rumor had it that the Shattered Star Sea possessed the mystery of becoming a Great Emperor, also the secrets and power of the Divine Ability of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor.

Such a place was astonishingly attractive to the Emperor Realm experts.

Unfortunately, the cultivators with the level of Emperor Realm could never enter Shattered Star Sea. It seemed that the masters of the Emperor Realm were being repelled by the Power of Law, while only the cultivators with the level of the Dao Source Realm were able to enter.

Every time the Shattered Star Sea opened, the entire Star Boundary would become excited.

All of the huge Sects would send their disciples into it, attempting to search for the mystery and legacy of the Great Emperor, desiring to accomplish an achievement that could be written in history.

Shattered Star Sea, a place much more earthshaking than the Four Seasons Realm!
