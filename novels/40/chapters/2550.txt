“Young Lady Lin’er, please assist us!” Hua Fei Chen, seeing that the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array was on the verge of collapsing, unable to contain Yang Kai anymore, quickly shouted to the red-robed girl.

The girl named Lin’er rebuked, pouting, “What trash Spirit Array is this? More than twenty people can’t trap one guy, and you still aren’t embarrassed to call this waste powerful!? When this Young Lady asked you whether you needed help, you guys refused, and now you are begging me?”

Hua Fei Chen nearly spurted blood after hearing this. In his heart, he thought, [It’s not the Spirit Array’s fault, rather the enemy is too strong! Those who laid down the Array aren’t strong enough to maintain it!]

The stronger the people arranging the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array were, the more power the Netherworld Purgatory Banners could exert, and the stronger the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array would be. Otherwise, how could it become the Sect Defending Array of Netherworld Sect?

Yin Le Sheng and Hua Fei Chen had thought that this plan was foolproof. After all, Yang Kai had at best just broken through to the Emperor Realm, so how strong could he be? As long as they sealed the space around him, he would be at their mercy.

But the facts were completely different from their estimation. Yang Kai’s strength couldn’t be inferred by common sense at all.

“Young Lady Lin’er, there is no need for sly criticism.” Anxious, Hua Fei Chen’s forehead became drenched in cold sweat as he stated, “If Yang Kai escapes, I’m afraid Young Lady Lin’er’s goal would also fail.”

The girl named Lin’er suddenly came to her senses as she responded, “I guess you’re right! Then, I will help you this time.”

Saying so, a crystal clear jade bowl appeared in her hand. The jade bowl wasn’t that big, easily held in her slender white hand. Also, it was glowing and there was a picture of a cinnamon flower on it. It was unknown who had carved this flower, but it was vivid and lifelike, even shaking slightly as if it was blowing in the breeze.

The girl named Lin’er shouted, raising her hand as the jade bowl shot out of her hand, “Go!”

The jade bowl suddenly flew above the black ball, leaving a white trail of light. The next moment, it started growing bigger, turning into a semi-circular white screen in the blink of an eye. Next, it fell down upside down, completely covering that black ball.

Not only that, the illusory image of the cinnamon flower in the jade bowl became tangible, taking root in the ground, becoming a towering old tree. Immediately, a wonderful fragrance slowly began to permeate into the surroundings.

*Hong…*

Right then, Yang Kai struck again.

The black ball suddenly swelled again, but the jade-bowl-transformed white light screen blocked its expansion. This time, the black ball was suppressed, unable to swell noticeably.

The twenty or so Netherworld Sect disciples, whose faces were pale, thinking that the Array would definitely break this time and they would have to bear the backlash, were all pleasantly surprised after seeing the Array completely safe and sound under the protection of the light screen. Immediately after, they pushed their Source Qi even harder, increasing the might of the Array.

A covetous look appeared in Hua Fei Chen’s eyes as he blurted, gulping, “Is that the Taiyi Cinnamon Bowl?”

This Emperor Artifact was famous. Only a few masters of Eastern Territory hadn’t heard of it, but even fewer than a few people had ever laid their eyes on it. Hua Fei Chen was also seeing for the first time. With his experience and knowledge, he naturally knew the terrifying might of this Emperor Artifact.

“So what if it is? You want it?” The girl named Lin’er turned her head, staring at him coldly.

Hua Fei Chen was terrified and hurriedly replied, “I dare not! I dare not! It’s just that Young Lady Lin’er has opened this Old Master’s eyes today. This trip has become really worthwhile.”

“Enough with all this nonsense, quickly get on with it, I can’t keep this up for too long,” the girl named Lin’er’s face had gone red as her Source Qi kept pouring out like a flood. She could easily tell that the consumption of summoning the Emperor Artifact was pretty big and she wouldn’t be able to maintain it for a long time.

Hua Fei Chen immediately regained his wits and solemnly responded, “I request Young Lady Lin’er to cooperate for a bit.”

While speaking, he motioned to Yin Le Sheng as the two tacitly came to an understanding. Their figures flickered as they jumped straight towards the black ball.

The girl named Lin’er formed a few hand seals and opened a slight gap on the white light screen when the two approached it, letting them pass through.

The twenty-some Netherworld Sect disciples naturally did the same, allowing Hua Fei Chen and Yin Le Sheng to rush into the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array.

Inside the Array, Yang Kai let out a soft exclamation with an extremely weird look on his face.

He was almost about to destroy this Array, but somehow some strong and sturdy force had stabilized it all of a sudden.

Not only that, but even the surrounding space had been more tightly sealed. Even he felt like he was being suppressed now.

Inside this ghastly Array, Yang Kai felt that he was surrounded by dark fog and he was unable to spread his Divine Sense very far. So naturally, he was oblivious to the fact that the girl named Lin’er was using a mighty Emperor Artifact to create difficulties for him.

He simply thought that he had underestimated the might of the Spirit Array.

*Chi chi chi chi…*

Swishing sounds kept coming from all around as the abominable Yin Souls swam around Yang Kai, attacking him whenever they found an opportunity.

The Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array was arranged with Netherworld Purgatory Banners as its foundation. The black fog that was capable of sealing space was also coming from the Netherworld Purgatory Banners, and thanks to the Array, the might of the Netherworld Purgatory Banners was enhanced.

Inside the Array, it was like fighting more than twenty Netherworld Sect disciples; it wasn’t as simple as one plus one at all.

The Yin Souls seemed to have been greatly strengthened in this strange environment, and although Yang Kai tried his best to shake them off, he wasn’t able to kill more than a few as he was focused on breaking the Array before, which led to his current predicament.

At this moment, he finally noticed the strangeness of this Spirit Array.

Entrapped in this place, Yang Kai discovered that his vitality was withering away bit by bit, and the black Qi around him was extremely corrosive; it was eroding his physique and Emperor Qi.

*Wu Wu Wu…*

Hair-raising ghost cries rang out to no end, and one after another, Yin Souls hidden in the black fog attacked him from every direction.

Yang Kai flicked his fingers, firing off Moon Blades in every direction.

Although this space was isolated, stopping him from teleporting out of the range of the Array, nothing was stopping him from using the Space Principles inside the black ball.

Yang Kai’s Moon Blades were terrifying, and the Yin Souls were torn to ashes by them on contact.

Right then, Yang Kai suddenly had a bad premonition. Prompted by instinct, he swung his hand to palm the space behind him.

But this backhand struck nothing but the air. Instead, he was ruthlessly struck on the shoulder, which caused him to stagger back, sending his blood and Qi circulation into turmoil.

Fortunately, his body was strong, otherwise, this strike would have been enough to break his arm.

“Yang Kai, I am the Master in this Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array. If I want you to survive, you will survive, and if I want you to die, you will die. You will have no chance of living past today!” Yin Le Sheng’s voice suddenly came from every direction, drifting from place to place, making it impossible to tell where he was hiding.

Yang Kai tightly furrowed his brow, faintly feeling that things were a little troublesome.

Yin Le Sheng and Hua Fei Chen were both members of the Netherworld Sect and were like fish in the water within this array, whereas Yang Kai’s hands and feet were tied, making him unable to display his full strength.

And with the array devouring his vitality and countless Yin Souls attacking him, if Yang Kai didn’t find a way out soon, he wouldn’t be able to escape and would definitely die here.

Yang Kai’s thoughts turned rapidly, but before he could regain his footing, he felt a chill strike his neck.

Shocked, he promptly summoned the Myriads Sword and struck toward that oncoming chill.

A crisp clang rang as sparks flew about.

A cry of surprise immediately followed, which seemed to be Hua Fei Chen’s voice.

Obviously, he hadn’t expected Yang Kai to detect his sneak attack in such a desperate situation, rendering his strike useless.

The Myriads Sword in Yang Kai’s hand formed a curtain of Sword Qi as he looked around, and although he couldn’t see anything clearly, Yang Kai still pursed his lips into a smile and stated, “Yin Le Sheng, I thought that you would conduct yourself well after I let you go once in the Shattered Star Sea, I never thought that you would run to the Ancient Lands just to kill me. Since you wish so much to die, then it wouldn’t be right if this Young Master wouldn’t fulfill your wish.”

Yin Le Sheng blew his top and immediately lashed out, “You are still being so stubborn moments before death. I want to see what you will do now.”

Yang Kai laughed and stated, “Just wait and watch. But don’t cry later!”

Yin Le Sheng was completely furious and still wanted to retort, but Hua Fei Chen interrupted him, “Martial Nephew Yin, don’t listen to him, he is trying to find your location!”

Yin Le Sheng felt that Hua Fei Chen was right. Yang Kai was clearly at the end of his rope, so he was constantly provoking him to make him talk so that he could find his position.

[I should keep my mouth shut for now.]

Yang Kai, on the other hand, lightly sneered before speaking, “Do you think that this Young Master can’t do anything to you because of this weak Spirit Array? You will be kneeling and begging for mercy in just fifteen minutes.”

“Shameless boasting!” Yin Le Sheng was really furious and couldn’t help but shout back.

Hua Fei Chen was also shivering with anger. He had never seen such an ignorant Junior who didn’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth. Clearly, death was knocking on his door but he was still boasting. Where was he getting all this confidence from? Hua Fei Chen secretly decided that he would torture Yang Kai well after capturing him.

After a few more rounds of bickering, no more words could be heard inside the black ball, just constant swishing sounds.

The red-robed girl and Old Fu, who were standing outside, also understood that Yang Kai must be having a hard time even though they had no idea what was going on inside.

Because every once in a while, they could hear Yang Kai’s groans. Obviously, he was attacked by Hua Fei Chen and Yin Le Sheng.

The girl named Lin’er tried her best to rouse the might of the Taiyi Cinnamon Bowl, and although this was taking a toll on her, her face was filled with excitement. Just like Hua Fei Chen, she was looking forward to torturing Yang Kai.

As long as she could take down Yang Kai, she would be able to vent all her frustrations; no matter what price she had to pay, it would be well worth it.

*Peng Peng Peng…* Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Sounds of clashing swords could be heard coming from inside the black ball every now and then; however, it was quite obvious that Yang Kai was at a complete disadvantage. He was passively taking a beating, and if not for his proficiency in the Dao of Space, allowing him to notice subtle fluctuations around him and dodge incoming attacks, he would have died many times over by now.

Even so, he was in a tight corner at this moment. His body was riddled with multiple wounds, and although there weren’t any serious injuries, the number of injuries was slowly increasing.

“You are still not dead!” Yin Le Sheng was shocked and furious. Just like him, Yang Kai had just broken through to the Emperor Realm, but he was showing far greater strength than Yin Le Sheng, which was very hard to accept.

But all that should be over soon as Yang Kai’s vitality was constantly being drained by the Array and the surrounding Yin Qi invading his body as well as the accumulated injuries. Soon, Yang Kai would no longer have any strength left to resist, and when that happened, he would be a fish on the chopping block.
