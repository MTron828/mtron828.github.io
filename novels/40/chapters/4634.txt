Every ten days to half a month there would be an Ore Star, which was originally from the Black Territory’s Inner Region, that was moved to the periphery. In just one year, the originally empty periphery was now filled with more than thirty Ore Stars of different sizes.

This kind of amount was just a drop in the ocean compared to the reserves in the entire Black Territory.

However, no one would underestimate the resources these over thirty Ore Stars could produce. They were initially in the depths of the Black Prison, so it was extremely difficult to mine them as even Sixth-Order ore slaves were unable to reach that location safely.

Nevertheless, Yang Kai used a stunning move to transfer them to a safe area such as the periphery.

When Yang Kai previously brought back an Ore Star that was half the usual size, it allowed the ore slaves in the Black Territory to keep on mining for a few years. Now that there were more than thirty Ore Stars, it was enough for them to mine these Stars for 100 years.

If the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors hadn’t shown signs of breaking, Yang Kai would’ve brought even more Ore Stars over.

However, over the past year, the hastily made Void Yin-Yang Mirrors had to bear the pressure of moving many gigantic Ore Stars. Cracks of different sizes started appearing on the sixteen Array Boards, and if this went on, they might come apart at any moment.

These things were extremely costly as each of them was worth 3 billion Open Heaven Pills. Yang Kai did not have the heart to see them break.

Though he still wasn’t satisfied with his current haul, he could only leave the Black Territory’s Inner Region.

Upon his return, he saw the huge Ore Stars hovering in the periphery. When he realised that several hundred Open Heaven Realm ore slaves were already working on the first Ore Star he had brought back, he was pleased.

“The Ore Stars you’ve sent back are rich in resources. So far, we’ve found more than thirty Sixth-Order materials. There are even two Sixth-Order Yang Element materials and three Yin Element materials. Additionally, there are several thousand materials that are below the Sixth-Order,” Luan Bai Feng reported while accompanying Yang Kai to have a look at the first Ore Star.

Yang Kai nodded, “All the effort was worth it.”

Luan Bai Feng replied with a smile, “Despite that, it’ll take another twenty years before we can cover the cost of refining the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors.”

“It’s fine as long as we can earn it back.”

As they moved forward, the ore slaves respectfully saluted Yang Kai and Luan Bai Feng.

Half a day later, Yang Kai stopped in his tracks and said, “I’ll leave this place to you. Just remember to send the extracted materials to Void Land every two to three years.”

“Got it,” Luan Bai Feng replied, then shot him a glance, “Where are you going?”

After giving it a thought, Yang Kai decided not to hide it from her, “I’ll ask a senior expert to make something for me, then I’ll go to the Shattered Heaven. If anyone from Void Land asks about it, you can just tell them the truth.”

“The Shattered Heaven is not a kind place. Don’t get killed over there and drag me into it.” Luan Bai Feng frowned.

Yang Kai smiled and took a step forward as his figure rapidly faded.

There were countless Great Territories in the 3,000 Worlds. Every Great Territory was named after the most powerful great force in that place, other than some remote Great Territories which only had generic identifiers, there was no exception.

However, every great force would rise and fall, just like how a person would get sick and die of old age. A Great Territory could be named after a great force because it was the most powerful, but when this great force was destroyed and replaced, the Great Territory would be given a different name.

When Void Land replaced Seven Wonders Land in the past, Seven Wonders Territory became Void Territory.

Therefore, the name in the latest Universe Charts would be changed, while the owners of the older Universe Charts could get them updated or just manually change it.

With that said, there was actually one exception.

In Great Evolution Territory, the most powerful great force was supposedly Heavenly Martial Hall. This great force was much stronger than the original Seven Wonders Land because there was a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master assuming command of it.

Supposedly, the Great Territory where Heavenly Martial Hall was located should be named Heavenly Martial Territory; however, since time immemorial, the name of this Great Territory had never been changed in the Universe Charts. It had always been Great Evolution Territory!

Those from Heavenly Martial Hall were certainly displeased with this. By naming the Great Territory after their own Sect, it would be a great way for them to popularise themselves. The 3,000 Worlds was vast, and even though Heavenly Martial Hall wasn’t weak, it still wasn’t comparable to the real behemoths. Although they had a golden opportunity to make a name for themselves, their wish had never been granted, which was why they were disgruntled.

Therefore, the cultivators of Heavenly Martial Hall repeatedly visited Four Seas Union and argued with them in the hope that they could change Great Evolution Territory to Heavenly Martial Territory when making the Universe Charts.

All the Universe Charts in the 3,000 Worlds were made by Four Seas Union, which was backed by one of the 36 Cave Heavens. Their shops could be found in all the major Star Cities, including Void Star City and the newly built High Heaven Star City.

After all, it was extremely inconvenient to move around the 3,000 Worlds without a Universe Chart; therefore, as long as a cultivator had the money, they would buy a Universe Chart. Four Seas Union had made a fortune through this business.

It wasn’t hard to enter Four Seas Union, it was a business entity after all. Those from Heavenly Martial Hall had visited the Four Seas Union countless times, but the name Great Evolution Territory always remained in the new Universe Charts. There had never been a change.

This made the people from Heavenly Martial Hall feel vexed; however, they were weaker than the other party, so there was nothing they could do.

There was one thing they didn’t understand, though. There was no great force in Great Evolution Territory that had anything to do with the title ‘Great Evolution’ now, so why was it so hard for them to change the name?

Several hundred years ago, Heavenly Martial Hall had almost changed its name to Great Evolution Sect in order to take advantage of the name Great Evolution Territory. However, they hadn’t forgotten the hard work their Ancestors had put in to build their Sect, so they ultimately decided against this name change.

Nevertheless, they creatively created a Heavenly Martial Hall Great Evolution Branch as a silent protest against the Four Seas Union.

Although the Great Evolution Branch had been founded, it was basically half-abandoned. Those from Heavenly Martial Hall had spent a large amount of manpower and resources on this project, but they had only managed to nurture several Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. The Elders, who initially had high hopes for the Great Evolution Branch, gradually lost interest.

As Yang Kai went through the route in his mind, he went from the Black Territory to the Great Evolution Territory and arrived at a particular spot in the void.

He had been to this place once before, but it was the Proprietress who brought him here. Even though he was on his own this time, he hadn’t lost his way.

After straightening his face, he cupped his fist and shouted, “Void Land Yang Kai greets Senior Ma Fan. Please forgive me for disturbing you.”

No one replied to him from the void while he waited patiently.

After he waited for one hour, two hours, and then the entire day, there was still no one who responded to him.

Yang Kai put on a helpless smile. Even though he had witnessed Senior Ma Fan’s bad temper when he tagged along with the Proprietress previously, and he had a feeling that he’d be turned down this time, he still felt frustrated when it really happened. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Since he had already expected it, he didn’t say anything and simply sat down with his legs crossed.

He believed that Senior Ma Fan would be moved by his sincerity. Regardless, he had to see this Artifact Refining Grandmaster.

In fact, he was jealous of the Heavenly Sword Union for possessing the Heavenly Sword Palace. Not only could it attack and defend, but it could also serve as a flight type artifact. It was like a moving palace.

If he hadn’t made use of the Star Boundary’s World Force and temporarily advanced to Seventh-Order, and with over 1,000 Open Heaven Realm Masters who maintained a large-scale barrage of attacks on the Heavenly Sword Palace, they couldn’t have stopped this moving fortress from moving forward. Had Heavenly Sword Palace reached the Star Boundary, the situation would’ve been flipped around, and Zuo Quan Hui would have won.

Fortunately, the Heavenly Sword Palace exploded less than five million kilometres away from the Star Boundary following a long and bloody battle. It could be said that Zuo Quan Hui was just one step away from success.

At that time, Yang Kai swore that if there was a chance in the future, he would also build a similar palace artifact for Void Land, that way, when they were faced with something like the Heavenly Sword Palace again, they could defend themselves at the very least.

When he was having a negotiation with the Cave Heavens and Paradises previously, he looked for some of the High-Rank Masters in private and asked them if their Sects’ Artifact Refining Grandmasters could help Void Land build such a palace artifact.

Certainly, Void Land could provide the materials and offer an appropriate remuneration. Yang Kai even offered to exempt those who helped him from paying the Sixth-Order materials required to take disciples from the Star Boundary.

However, all of them had turned him down.

Hong Xiang Ling from Azure Void Cave Heaven, who wanted to get his Disciple married to Yang Kai, was kind enough to offer an explanation. He said that it would take too much time and energy to refine such a thing, and although the Cave Heavens and Paradises were capable of doing it, they would only do so for their own Sects. They couldn’t even meet their own demands for such artifacts, so they wouldn’t offer help to someone else. It was pointless for Yang Kai to ask regardless of what payment he promised.

Yang Kai then asked Xu Ling Gong about it, and the latter gave him a similar explanation.

In that case, he could only give up on seeking help from the Cave Heavens and Paradises. Instead, he had his eyes on Grandmaster Ma Fan.

Yang Kai still had some vivid memories of this Artifact Refining Grandmaster. In the past, in order to arrange the Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array, they needed some items to be served as Array Cores. The Proprietress brought him to this place and pleaded with this Artifact Refining Grandmaster. As a result, the Heavenly Executioner’s Sword and the Heavenly Net Umbrella that had been placed in the Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array were made by Grandmaster Ma Fan.

The Proprietress had said that Grandmaster Ma Fan came from one of the ancient Paradises; however, his Sect no longer existed. He was the only one who was still alive as he led a reclusive life in its expansive ruins.

At that time, Yang Kai was a mere Emperor Realm Junior who had just arrived at the 3,000 Worlds, so he knew little about the Outer Universe. He was shocked that one of the Paradises had fallen in the past. As he recalled it now, he came to realise many things that he hadn’t back then.

There was no doubt that Grandmaster Ma Fan’s mastery of Artifact Refining was unrivalled. With the help of the Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array, Yang Kai activated the power of Heavenly Executioner’s Sword and defeated the Union Master of Heavenly Sword Union Kong Feng despite being an Emperor Realm Junior at that time, which went to show that the Heavenly Executioner’s Sword was truly incredible.

Since none of the Cave Heavens and Paradises were willing to help, Yang Kai could only hope that Grandmaster Ma Fan would refine a palace artifact for him.

However, Grandmaster Ma Fan wouldn’t respond to him. Since Yang Kai had made up his mind, he naturally wasn’t in a rush. As he was seated in the void, he fished out one of the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors that was slightly damaged.

This thing was as large as a house. It wasn’t that Yang Kai didn’t want to make it smaller and more convenient, but rather that he couldn’t. He and Luan Bai Feng knew little about Artifact Refining, while only several Fifth-Order Masters had some skill in it. They had already done their best to refine the current Void Yin-Yang Mirrors.

Fortunately, the most important thing was the Space Array, not the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors themselves; otherwise, they couldn’t have succeeded in moving the Ore Stars in Black Territory.
