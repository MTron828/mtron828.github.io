Li Jiao escaped from a brush with death in the Frozen Earth back then, so he naturally paid more attention to it afterwards. Only, there was simply too little information about the Frozen Earth. Even though he had the heart to collect information, there wasn’t much for him to discover.

He knew that there was a type of Heavenly Manifestation called the Frozen Tide in the Frozen Earth, and knew that no one could survive it; however, how the Frozen Tide was formed, how one should avoid it, or what it looked like, he wasn’t sure.

It wasn’t until he saw it with his own eyes at this moment that he was immediately sure that this had to be the Frozen Tide.

The trio had their speed greatly hampered in this environment, so even though they exerted all their strength, they could not escape the Frozen Tide’s approach. Watching it get closer and closer, both Yang Kai and Zhu Lie’s expressions did not look too good.

In front of a life or death crisis, no one could remain calm.

Yang Kai tried to use his Space Principles, but found it incredibly difficult. The coldness in the Frozen Earth seemed able to freeze even space itself, forcing him to set aside any idea of escaping with instantaneous movement.

As the Frozen Tide grew closer and closer to the three, the bone-chilling cold seemed to hit their back like a huge hammer, causing them to not be able to stop from shivering all over.

Li Jiao’s face suddenly turned fierce as he roared, “If this Li dies here because of you, then I won’t forgive you even if I become a ghost!”

The days of grievance and anger gathering in him finally burst out at this moment. They were going to die anyway, so why should he still have so many scruples? “Yang Kai, aren’t you supposed to be powerful? You even have Monster Kings and Divine Spirits serving you! Find a way to do something about this situation!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Seeing Yang Kai remain silent, Li Jiao went on angrily, “You’re nothing more than a fox borrowing a tiger’s prestige! Do you think this Li is really afraid of you? If not for Grandmaster Ji Ying’s sake, this Li would have led his men over to flatten your High Heaven Palace long ago! This Li will give you a life worse than death! A trivial First-Order Emperor Realm cultivator dares to act arrogant in front of this Li? Ridiculous!”

Seemingly not satisfied with his scolding, he turned to Zhu Lie next and continued, “Dragon? So what if you’re from the Dragon Clan!? Do you think you can look down on all others just because you were born lucky? This King’s bloodline may not be pure, but so what!? This King was birthed and raised by his parents! This King cultivated to the Third-Order Emperor Realm with his own efforts! If you didn’t have your Dragon Clan bloodline, then you probably wouldn’t even be able to reach this King’s height! All day long, you go around putting on airs; I don’t even know who you’re showing off to! If you have the skill, then don’t use bloodline suppression and face this King head on! This Li will definitely show you this King’s power. Damn, damn… How did this Li get caught up in your mess? Two stars of calamity… I’d known that following you to the Frozen Earth wouldn’t end in anything good… I should have left early on. This is all your fault! This Li had already brought you where you needed to go, so why drag this Li along afterwards? You really think this Li is so easy to bully? Just you wait! If we get out of this alive, this Li will definitely lead his Sect to attack High Heaven Palace and Dragon Island. There will be blood…”

He was ranting on and on as if he had lost his mind, becoming somewhat hysterical, but no matter how he vented his anger, neither Yang Kai nor Zhu Lie paid him any attention.

The two men exchanged glances suddenly, and Zhu Lie said, “If you have any trump cards, better bring them out now! Any later and it’ll really be too late.”

Yang Kai curled his lip, “You Dragon Clansmen have so many Secret Techniques, why are you looking at me? I’m just a First-Order Emperor, what sort of trump card would I have?”

Zhu Lie gave him a deep look and sighed, “Fine. Since you don’t feel like showing your cards, I won’t force you. I’ll do it.”

Li Jiao’s cursing stopped abruptly as if a large invisible hand was pinching his lips closed. Looking at Yang Kai, then at Zhu Lie, he asked carefully with a smiling face, “Sir, do you have a way to get out of this crisis?”

Zhu Lie answered coldly, “I can give it a try.”

Li Jiao urged him with immediacy, “Then what are you waiting for? Quickly!”

While flying, Yang Kai smirked at him.

Li Jiao couldn’t help his frozen white face from flushing with embarrassment, “Sir must take me as well. Just now… I don’t know what possessed me. It was surely a bout of madness. Those definitely aren’t my true thoughts, so please don’t take it personally, Sir!”

He just wanted to slap himself for letting his tongue slip. He didn’t expect to get himself into such big trouble, and he didn’t even know whether this Dragon was willing to help him out now.

But his worries were superfluous. When the dragon roar came out, the figure of a vibrant red Great Dragon appeared above Zhu Lie’s head. The Great Dragon circled around and wrapped around the three of them at once.

They seemed to be isolated from the bitter cold, giving them a sense of security.

Letting out a cry, signs of Dragon Transformation appeared on the surface of Zhu Lie’s body. Then, he turned straight around and actually began rushing in the direction of the Frozen Tide.

Li Jiao was so frightened that his Soul almost left his body and he screamed out loud. Still, he didn’t dare to move away from the Red Dragon’s protection and could only watch himself getting closer and closer to the Frozen Tide.

Yang Kai was also slightly surprised by this, but he quickly understood Zhu Lie’s plan.

It was simply impossible for them to escape from the Frozen Tide’s advance with their current speed, so rather than let it catch up to them and struggle through it, they might as well turn back and face it. With the three of them, they may be able to break through it with their strength.

This was not the best idea, but it was worth a try. Perhaps they might actually get out of this crisis this way.

The cold wind howled, and the Frozen Tide grew closer and closer to the trio. Li Jiao’s face was already shocked to a ghastly colour, and if not for his firm mental temperament, he would probably have fainted then and there.

A dozen breaths later, the three of them finally collided with the Frozen Tide head-on and were enveloped by the pitch-black mass.

Zhu Lie’s face changed dramatically as he discovered that something was wrong at that moment.

Unlike what he expected, this Frozen Tide did not seem to be some natural disaster caused by the convergence of World Energy. Rather, the feeling it gave him was of an indescribable existence, causing him to be unable to use any of the methods he had prepared, swallowing him up directly and whisking him away.

Yang Kai was also taken aback as he muttered, “Space Principles?”

He would never have thought that the Heavenly Manifestation, the Frozen Tide, that existed on the Frozen Earth, actually contained extremely rich Space Principles. The instant they were enveloped by the Frozen Tide, the space around them fluctuated chaotically, and it actually gave them a feeling that they were being teleported. Moreover, this feeling was even more violent than cross-territory teleportation. It felt like they were being completely torn into a fine powder as they were thrown through the Void.

Almost instinctively, Yang Kai pushed his own Space Principles.

In the next moment, Yang Kai became dazed and he could no longer sense Zhu Lie and Li Jiao’s presence, having no idea where the two of them had gone. Yang Kai just felt himself falling endlessly, and that dizzy feeling was growing stronger and stronger. Only by circulating his Space Principles was he able to feel a little better.

It was not known how much time passed when that dizziness finally disappeared all of a sudden. Yang Kai fell heavily onto solid ground, then he bounced up and rolled a few times before he came to a stop.

All the bones in his body felt like they had been broken and he was hit by a feeling of nausea that he had never experienced before, causing him to gag a few times.

The surrounding area was quiet and still snow-capped as usual, but Li Jiao and Zhu Lie were nowhere to be seen.

Slowly getting up, Yang Kai’s expression gradually became grave.

Even though the surrounding scenery did not look much different from earlier, the coldness that penetrated deep into his Soul was no longer present. He could keenly sense the differences in this place. It felt like a completely new world, a world that did not exist in the same plane as the Frozen Earth.

Yang Kai tried to examine the World Principles around him next, and after a few moments, his suspicions were confirmed.

This was indeed another world. Though the World Principles here were complete, they were also somewhat confused, very different from the Star Boundary’s World Principles. In other words, he was not currently in the Star Boundary.

Yang Kai thought back to what happened earlier and was able to muster a faint guess, but he wasn’t too sure.

The only thing he could be sure of was the fact that the place that he arrived at was greatly related to the Frozen Tide. Perhaps the Frozen Tide was the entrance to this world, and its Heaven-destroying and Earth-shattering might was merely a mirage.

Suddenly, a red light appeared in the corner of his eye. Turning his head over, Yang Kai saw the dragon blood coral he was holding in his hand glowing a hundred times brighter than before.

The dense light coming from the crown of the coral had coalesced into a thick red band that was drifting in a certain direction, guiding Yang Kai.

“Zhu Qing!” Yang Kai raised his brows and shouted, immediately understanding why these changes happened to the dragon blood coral.

This was something Zhu Lie had created using his Dragon Blood in conjunction with a Dragon Clan Secret Technique, and its main purpose was to find Zhu Qing’s whereabouts. When they were searching for her in the Frozen Earth, it did in fact guide their way.

But its light was nowhere near as strong as now.

Zhu Qing was here! And she was probably not far from him.

When the Frozen Tide washed over him, it clearly swept across a wide area, and he was brought to this world by that Frozen Tide. If Zhu Qing was also swallowed up by the Frozen Tide, she would also appear in this world, which was why these changes happened to the dragon blood coral.

At this thought, Yang Kai hurriedly pulled himself together, picked up the dragon blood coral, and rushed in the direction it led.

In the vast snowy mountains, Yang Kai walked alone.

Sure enough, an hour later, Yang Kai discovered that familiar figure less than three hundred kilometres away from where he emerged.

Blood red long hair like flames, a small and delicate body, lying on her side on the snow, her life or death uncertain.

Yang Kai hurriedly ran over to pick up this figure, and brushing her hair from her face, sure enough, it was Zhu Qing. Letting out a soft sigh of relief, even though he had no idea where they were at right now, Yang Kai was finally relieved to have some good news.

Zhu Qing was found, and as for Zhu Lie and Li Jiao, Yang Kai guessed that they probably weren’t in any danger either. That Frozen Tide was indeed quite frightening in appearance, but it didn’t seem to bring much harm.

The reason they were split up was completely because he instinctively used his Space Principles the moment they were enveloped by the Frozen Tide.

However, Zhu Qing’s condition didn’t seem right. She was a Dragon after all, and one on par or even stronger than a Third-Order Emperor. There was no reason for her to be unconscious on the ground. Perhaps it had something to do with being swallowed up by the Frozen Tide just now; after all, even Yang Kai, who was proficient in the Dao of Space, felt nauseous for a long time after being swallowed up.

But that was clearly not the main reason.

Her body felt as cold as a block of ice, and even her vitality felt extremely weak.
