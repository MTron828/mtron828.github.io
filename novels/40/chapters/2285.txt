Zhou Fu quickly went to handle matters related to the Facetless Profound Grass.

Actually, Yang Kai could have handled this and purchased them by himself, but he would have wasted a lot of time and energy on it; on the other hand, Zhou Fu was in touch with the shopkeepers of the other stores in Maplewood City and he could quickly get any materials from them, making him more efficient than Yang Kai.

After Zhou Fu left, the two men with dishevelled hair looked at Yang Kai excitedly, “Grandmaster Yang, do you need Facetless Profound Grass to refine pills?”

Yang Kai smiled, “You could say so. Friends, it looks like you are also Alchemists, aren’t you?”

“Indeed! We’re very honoured to undertake the same craft as Grandmaster Yang,” one of them replied with a fawning smile.

As for the other person, “Grandmaster Yang, we’ve looked up to you for so long, yet never had the chance to meet you and didn’t expect that we’d be fortunate to run into you today.”

The two Alchemists were both slick-tongued and they spoke one after the other with a respectful and humble look plastered on their faces. It was almost like they were worshipping Yang Kai!

Ye Jing Han observed this in shock. She felt like her worldview had been toppled and she almost couldn’t believe what she had just seen.

As far as she knew, Alchemists were arrogant and prideful people and she never got to see them praising and flattering someone.

But, as she gave more thought to this, she realized that Alchemists only gave respect to better Alchemists. Yang Kai had refined the Extraordinary Treasure Pill, so it wasn’t strange for two Origin King Grade Alchemists to treat him so respectfully.

Even at this moment, the two Alchemists were still showering Yang Kai with flattery and praising him to the highest Heavens.

Yang Kai let out a hollow cough, “Friends, don’t you have any questions for me? I have some free time now...”

Upon hearing this, the two Alchemists exchanged a glance and they could both see the excitement apparent in each other’s eyes. One of them then took the initiative to speak up, “Grandmaster Yang, you are indeed sharp and insightful! We have heard that the Source Condensing Pills refined by Grandmaster Yang when he worked at Spirit Pill Plaza were quite popular. But, since we took over, we noticed that our Source Condensing Pills lacked something and many customers were dissatisfied with that, which is why the number of our store’s customers has gone down lately.”

“We just want... Want to... Grandmaster Yang, if you have some free time, can you please share your insights into the Alchemic Dao with us?”

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai asked, “Does Spirit Pill Plaza still use the improved recipe for Source Condensing Pills? The one improved by Grandmaster Huang Fu?”

“That’s right, Grandmaster Huang Fu is an Emperor Grade Alchemist, and he is the foundation of our Violet Source Chamber of Commerce’s Alchemists.”

“Since you are still using Grandmaster Huang Fu’s recipe, then there is no issue with the ingredients or process, so the problem must be in your refining methods. It won’t be useful to just explain it to you in words... Why don’t you refine a batch of Source Condensing Pills while I observe?” Yang Kai proposed.

Upon hearing this, the two Alchemists became fired up. They had both realized that Yang Kai was planning to give them practical guidance, a rare opportunity far from the reach of most people, so how could they refuse his request? They both shouted at the same time, “We will obey Grandmaster’s instructions! Grandmaster, please come this way.”

Yang Kai nodded and stood up, allowing the two Alchemists to guide him to the underground Pill Room. Ye Jing Han also followed them closely out of curiosity.

She was a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, but she had never observed someone refine pills up close before so she was quite interested in this.

After a short while, the small group reached the blazing hot underground Pill Room. There was a Spirit Array here for drawing out Earth Fire used in Alchemy, and Yang Kai was quite familiar with it because he had worked here for a few months.

The two Alchemists took out a batch of materials and started refining pills, while Yang Kai stood in front of them and observed carefully.

It wasn’t difficult for him to guide two High-Rank Origin King Grade Alchemists with his current attainments in Alchemy. Refining technique, Spirit Array portrayal, heat control, each aspect could influence the quality of Spirit Pills.

During the process, Yang Kai offered suggestions frequently and the two Alchemists accepted his advice humbly.

In the twinkling of an eye, half a day elapsed. The Alchemists opened their furnaces and they had both refined five or six pills of decent quality. They were quite delighted by the results and were very grateful to Yang Kai.

At this moment, Zhou Fu passed a message to Yang Kai, telling him that he had acquired the Facetless Profound Grass.

Yang Kai excused himself, leaving the two Alchemists to digest the gains from this brief instructional session, and returned to the plaza’s backroom.

Upon seeing Yang Kai, Zhou Fu, who had been waiting, quickly took out a Space Ring, “I have fulfilled your task. This ring has 2,000 stalks of Facetless Profound Grass. Please accept it!”

Yang Kai raised his brows and nodded, “Shopkeeper Zhou, you work quite fast.”

2,000 stalks of Facetless Profound Grass would sustain his needs for a long time, and Zhou Fu had used only half a day to collect them. He obviously put a lot of effort into this. If Yang Kai had done it by himself, he wouldn’t have been able to purchase so much in half a day.

“About the price...” Yang Kai took the Space Ring then raised his head to ask.

Zhou Fu hurriedly replied, “The Facetless Profound Grass isn’t worth much, just take it as a token of my regards for you. Please don’t reject it!”

Yang Kai said with a smile, “You don’t have to do so, you deserve proper remuneration.”

Saying so, Yang Kai suddenly waved his hand and a small mountain of Source Crystals appeared on a nearby table.

Yang Kai didn’t wait for the response from Zhou Fu before his body flickered and disappeared from the room. Even Ye Jing Han had disappeared along with him.

But, his voice still reverberated in Zhou Fu’s ears, “Whenever Shopkeeper Kang returns to Maplewood City, please notify me. When we meet again, we’ll have to drink to celebrate.”

Zhou Fu stared in a daze at the Source Crystals on the table and let out a bitter laugh.

.....

In one of the city’s streets, Yang Kai and Ye Jing Han suddenly appeared.

When Ye Jing Han re-appeared, she stumbled on the ground and almost fell. Her face was quite pale as she looked aghast at Yang Kai and asked, “Young Master Yang, is this your... teleportation ability?”

“Are you alright?” Yang Kai didn’t reply to her question and instead inquired about her well-being. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“It is my first time experiencing such a teleportation and I could clearly feel the chaotic flow of the Void around me. I still feel some lingering fear,” Ye Jing Han said.

Yang Kai said with a smile, “Then you’re still fine.”

Saying so, he took out a communication artifact and started sending his Divine Sense into it.

“Young Master Yang, who are you speaking to?” Ye Jing Han asked.

“Oh, I was planning to set out now so I need to leave a message for Patriarch Qin.”

“You don’t want to bid farewell to him in person?” Ye Jing Han looked strangely at him.

“There’s no need. In any case, I will return here in the future and Patriarch Qin is quite busy right now. Didn’t you tell me that the Patriarchs of Maplewood City’s families had all followed City Lord Duan to manage the Spirit Lake Palace?”

Ye Jing Han said, “If it’s only about Patriarch Qin, then I suppose that’s fine, but what about Young Lady Qin...”

“What’s about her?” Yang Kai turned his head and cast a glance at her, saying, “When I exited my retreat, I checked her aura stealthily and she seemed fine. Her state is already stable and her vitality is quite abundant.”

Ye Jing Han pursed her lips and smiled, “Young Master Yang, while you were in seclusion, Young Lady Qin came to your room daily and waited for no less than two hours each time. She probably has something she wishes to tell you, so why not give her a chance?”

Yang Kai cast a glance at her and his mouth twitched slightly, “Are all women so gossipy?”

As his voice fell, he used the communication artifact to leave a message for Qin Zhao Yang, telling him he would be leaving Maplewood City for a while and would come back again if there was a chance.

The Myriads Sword of the Qin Family was still in his hands, but he already had an agreement with Qin Zhao Yang about it. Once Qin Yu reached the Emperor Realm, he would return the Myriads Sword to the Qin Family. He couldn’t break his relationship with the Qin Family due to this, but he didn’t know when Qin Yu would reach the Emperor Realm, or whether she ever would.

Soon after, he took out the Identity Token of Azure Sun Temple to inform Gao Xue Ting that he would shortly leave. This token wasn’t just proof of his status and identity, it also served as a communication artifact. As long as there was another member of Azure Sun Temple in the vicinity, he could communicate with them through this token.

“That’s...” Ye Jing Han’s pretty eyes stared at the golden token with a pensive look, but when she saw the ‘Azure Sun’ characters carved on it, her body shivered and she cried out in alarm, “An Azure Sun Golden Token!”

Yang Kai looked in surprise at her, wondering why she had such a strong reaction.

“Young Master Yang, it turns out you’re a Core Disciple of Azure Sun Temple! Please forgive me for my previous disrespect...” Ye Jing Han laughed bitterly while an envious look surfaced on her face.

“A Core Disciple?” Yang Kai raised his brows, “How do you know that?”

Ye Jing Han looked strangely at Yang Kai and said, “Young Master Yang, you’re a member of Azure Sun Temple, so how come you don’t know how they classify their disciples?”

The corners of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched and he could only say awkwardly, “I’m only an in-name disciple of Azure Sun Temple, not a real disciple.”

“Then this golden token...” Ye Jing Han’s forehead filled with cold sweat as she felt her head spinning, her whole body shivering greatly. She couldn’t help but wonder whether Yang Kai had stolen this token from someone. If he had done so, then she would incur a disaster for Thousand Leaves Sect by inviting this man into it.

“Elder Gao forced it onto me,” Yang Kai said resentfully.

“She forced it... onto you...” Ye Jing Han almost fainted. Numerous talented youths of the Southern Territory fought with their lives on the line just to obtain the most common Identity Token from Azure Sun Temple, while a Core Disciples token had been ‘forced’ into Yang Kai’s hands by Elder Gao, as if he had accepted it only reluctantly.

Ye Jing Han suddenly felt quite unwell, while she got a dizzy spell and her vision turned blurry. She couldn’t help but wonder whether it was due to the previous teleportation or something else.

“Huh? Why is your face so pale? Did you eat something bad this morning?” Yang Kai cast a glance at her and spoke.

“Young Master Yang...” Ye Jing Han looked entreatingly at Yang Kai, “Please don’t make such terrible jokes, I’m quite excitable, so please stop trying to scare me.”

“What are you talking about?”

“Young Master Yang, don’t you know what this Azure Sun Golden Token represents?”

Yang Kai said sternly, “I only received it a month ago and have been in seclusion since then. What’s so special about this token?”

Ye Jing Han took a deep breath, causing her tall peaks to heave up and down heavily, like they were about to break through her dress.

Upon seeing this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but cast some frequent glances just below her neck.

After Ye Jing Han calmed herself, she explained, “The Identity Tokens of Azure Sun Temple’s disciples are all made of the same materials, but they are divided into three grades, bronze, silver, and gold. In the Temple, only a few top disciples of the Inner Sect possess an Azure Sun Golden Token, and with it, they are able to command all disciples with lower grade tokens. A person with a golden token has status equal to an ordinary Elder and they can even mobilize the personnel of the various industries of Azure Sun Temple across the entire Southern Territory. Whether it is requesting support, issuing commands, or borrowing resources, this token grants such authority. It is incredibly precious!”
