Chapter 1465, What Should And Should Not Be Said

Although, Yang Kai wasn’t afraid of any Origin Returning Realm master with his current combat power, if Demon Blood Temple’s beautiful Temple Master were to put her all into fleeing, he wouldn’t have had any way to kill her unless he sealed up all her escape routes in advance.

Fortunately, her plan had failed.

A moment later, the Stone Puppet jumped up, ran over to Yang Kai, and handed him a Space Ring. Obviously, this ring belonged to Demon Blood Temple’s Temple Master. Yang Kai took it, swept it with his Divine Sense briefly, then nodded with satisfaction before storing it away.

As the Master of a great force, this beautiful woman was naturally quite wealthy. Unfortunately, Yang Kai didn’t have time to perform a thorough count of the ring’s content right now, so he could only set it aside and wait until after he left the Emperor Garden to inspect it. Looking around though, Yang Kai couldn’t find Jin Shi’s Space Ring, so he figured it had been banished to The Void by accident, making it impossible to recover.

This was not too big a loss however, it was enough to simply win this battle. At the very least, Yang Kai’s original objective here had been achieved.

Waving his hand, Yang Kai took the Stone Puppet back into his Black Book Space before saying lightly, “Let’s go.”

“Ah, en,” Bi Luo seemed a little distracted and simply nodded before following after Yang Kai as they moved towards the end of the ice road, a strange expression filling her face the whole way forward.

She felt that her previous thoughts were too mistaken!

When she met Yang Kai earlier and noticed that his cultivation was the same as her own, Bi Luo subconsciously felt that Yang Kai wasn’t quite qualified to receive her Mistress’ affection and even felt a sense of indignation that Yang Kai hadn’t worked hard enough to close the gap between them these past few years, instead allowing it to expand. However, after witnessing this battle, she realized that although Yang Kai’s cultivation realm was two Minor Realms lower than her Mistress’, he was probably comparable to her in terms of true combat strength. In fact, if it had been her Mistress here instead, she may not have been able to handle this situation as cleanly as Yang Kai had.

Unfortunately, Yang Kai used too many external forces, and although this could also be considered part of his strength, it was still a bit unsatisfactory in Bi Luo’s opinion. One’s own strength was fundamental; after all, external forces could not continue to support a person in the long-term.

No one is perfect, however. Even the most beautiful jade had flaws, so even though this smelly man still had some gaps with his Mistress, they weren’t too big and he was barely qualified.

Thinking so, Bi Luo’s mood inexplicably became better.

With the dangers of this ice road completely eliminated, the two naturally didn’t face any obstacles as they moved forward. Soon, Yang Kai brought Bi Luo to a familiar large hall at the end of the ice road.

However, he didn’t continue immediately and instead turned his gaze back with a slight frown.

A short time later, two figures emerged from the ice road, the two women from Ice Heart Valley.

After leaving the ice road and seeing Yang Kai waiting here, the two women were slightly stunned and a look of vigilance appeared on their faces. The older of the two women stepped forward at that moment and politely asked, “Might I ask for Little Brother’s honoured name? This Mistress is Scarlet Wave Star’s Ice Heart Valley’s Tan Ting He and would like to offer her sincere thanks for little brother’s life-saving grace.”

Yang Kai observed them lightly for a moment before casually replying, “If you chased after me simply to offer your thanks, it was unnecessary. I had a grudge with those two people from long before, killing them had nothing to do with you.”

Tan Ting He smiled bitterly and said, “Although that may be the case, it was clear at a glance that those two weren’t anything good. If Little Brother had not killed them, this Mistress and her Junior Sister would probably have met a miserable end, so no matter the circumstances, I ask Little Brother to please accept this Mistress and her Junior Sister’s thanks.”

Saying so, she unexpectedly bowed her head together with the other elegant woman.

Yang Kai’s expression remained indifferent and he didn’t bother trying to stop them. Although he didn’t have any intention of saving them, his actions ultimately ended up having that effect. If Yang Kai hadn’t intervened when he did, given Jin Shi’s personality and behaviour, these two women would have lost more than just their lives.

Them bowing in thanks was also reasonable.

After they expressed their gratitude and didn’t see Yang Kai respond, however, the two women’s expressions became somewhat awkward as they exchanged glances with one another, seemingly wanting to say something but hesitating to do so.

“Is there anything else?” Yang Kai frowned, showing a little displeasure. Given this pair’s situation, it would be best for them to find a hidden place to meditate and recover, so why were they insisting on pestering him?

Could it be possible that after seeing his strength they wanted to join forces? Or perhaps they wanted to rely on him to protect their safety? Yang Kai had such guesses, but if this was the case, these two were bound to be disappointed.

Although these two were quite beautiful, Yang Kai wasn’t interested in offering kindness to strangers. Bi Luo alone was enough of a burden for Yang Kai so he had no plans on ​​taking care of two more wounded women.

“It’s like this,” Tan Ting He brushed her hair behind her ear and looked directly into Yang Kai’s eyes as she asked, “May I ask Little Brother if the thing which swallowed that World Spirit just now was the legendary Ice Phoenix Ancient Divine Spirit?”

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed as a cold glint flashed across his eyes, his expression noticeably darkening.

Aware of his displeasure, Tan Ting He quickly waved her hand and continued, “Please don’t misunderstand Little Brother, my Junior Sister and I have no hostile intentions towards you nor are we in any condition to fight right now, we simply wanted to ask you some questions.”

“So, what if it is?” Yang Kai coldly snorted. Could these two women really be so lacking in propriety? Did they not understand what should and should not be said? If he was a more ill-tempered person, Yang Kai might have killed her for even asking such a question.

Hearing his answer, Tan Ting He smiled happily and asked anxiously, “If it truly is an Ice Phoenix... Would little brother be willing to sell it to my Ice Heart Valley? We can meet any requirement you might have!”

“Sell?” Yang Kai was stunned to hear this but instead of getting angry he just smiled mockingly, “Are you sleep-talking? Even asking such a thing?”

Even Bi Luo, who was an outsider to this situation, looked at Tan Ting He sarcastically.

This proposal was the funniest joke she had ever heard. What kind of noble existence was an Ice Phoenix? Yang Kai being able to obtain a wisp of its Remnant Soul was nothing less than a Heaven defying opportunity, how could he possibly just sell it?

Facing Yang Kai’s disdainful words, Tan Ting He wasn’t discouraged, however, and instead continued her appeal, “I won’t hide anything from little brother, my Ice Heart Valley exclusively cultivates Ice Attribute Secret Arts, and the Ice Phoenix is the Divine Symbol which all our disciples worship. Therefore, that Remnant Soul is of unimaginable value to my Ice Heart Valley.”

“So what?” Yang Kai began to become impatient.

“If this Mistress’ perception was not mistaken, Little Brother should not cultivate an Ice Attribute Secret Art! So while an Ice Phoenix is indeed incredibly rare and valuable, it should not be very useful to you. Since you cannot realize its full potential, if you can instead agree to sell it, I can promise you here, on behalf of my Sect, that any condition you raise we can fulfil!” Tan Ting He spoke quickly about her intentions while the other Ice Heart Valley woman nodded beside her.

If Yang Kai agreed to this deal, Ice Heart Valley would be willing to pay any price to complete it, which was why they dared make such a declaration without first consulting with the Elders of the Sect. These two firmly believed that if the Elders were to learn about this, they would only rejoice, not complain.

“What you said just now I’ll pretend I never heard, but if you dare speak one more word, I’ll make sure both of you remain inside the Emperor Garden forever!” Yang Kai gave them a cold look and threatened with no trace of politeness before pulling Bi Luo and walking off.

“Little brother, please consider my offer carefully, if you ever change your mind, come to Scarlet Wave Star’s Ice Heart Valley!” Tan Ting He didn’t seem to want to give up and shouted at his back.

As soon as her voice sounded though, a golden light flashed towards her, changing halfway from a piercing stab to a whip-like sweep, knocking Tan Ting He several dozen metres through the air before she pounded heavily onto the ground.

By the time she looked up, Yang Kai and Bi Luo had disappeared.

“Senior Sister!” The other Ice Heart Valley woman was shocked and hurriedly ran over to help Tan Ting He. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I’m fine,” Tan Ting He shook her head slowly, a trace of unwillingness appearing on her face, wanting to chase after Yang Kai, but remembering the strength of the blow she just suffered, not daring to act rashly.

She understood that her words had really aroused Yang Kai’s murderous intent and she had only been spared because the other party wasn’t innately malicious.

It would be unwise to anger such an opponent at this moment as doing so would be no different from courting death.

However, watching a young man who did not even cultivate an Ice Attribute Secret Art carry an Ice Phoenix Remnant Soul in his body made her extremely reluctant. If that Remnant Soul could be won by her Ice Heart Valley, it could surely play an incredible role.

“Why is that man acting so unreasonably?” The younger woman pouted indignantly.

“It’s us who were not acting appropriately,” Tan Ting He smiled bitterly.

“But Senior Sister, are we just going to watch such a big opportunity slip away from us?” The other woman had obviously not lost heart.

“What else can we do? Now we can only hope he someday changes his mind. In any case, I’ve told him what Cultivation Star Ice Heart Valley is based on, so if there comes a day when he is willing to exchange it, he can find his way to the Sect,” Tan Ting He shook her head, “Forget it, this matter will end here for now, Junior Sister. Let’s find a place to recover first.”

“Yeah.”

On the other side, Yang Kai and Bi Luo had left the hall. Although Tan Ting He’s proposal had been rejected by him, and he had even given her a small lesson, Yang Kai’s mood was still quite gloomy.

This could not be helped, as this Ice Phoenix Remnant Soul was not his but Su Yan’s! It was an invaluable part of Su Yan’s inheritance yet now some outsider wanted Yang Kai to sell it to them, the very notion of it filled him with annoyance and anger.

If not for him having no enmity or hatred with those two women, Yang Kai would not have hesitated to kill them the moment they made such a ridiculous proposal.

Along the way, Bi Luo remained silent and obedient. She also understood that her being able to walk safely through this crisis-ridden Emperor Garden was completely because of Yang Kai, so she didn’t dare to disturb him.

Soon, the two arrived in front of a maze, at which point Yang Kai’s brow furrowed as he sank into contemplation.

He had been to this place once before.

When he and Fei Zhi Tu’s group had come here that day, they had wandered about inside this maze for a while and gotten lost many times, but thanks to Lian Guang’s mouse puppets, finding their way out of the maze hadn’t been too much trouble.

Now that there were no puppets to use however, Yang Kai could only rely on his memory.

Fortunately, he was barely able to remember the route they walked that day, so even if he was somewhat uncertain, he figured he would be able to recall what choices to make as he progressed through the maze.
