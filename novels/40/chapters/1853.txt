Both the old and young man stared at Yang Kai’s fading back, remaining silent for quite some time. The old man wore a solemn expression, but the young man seemed to be quite interested in Yang Kai, even showing a faint smile on his lips.

After Yang Kai’s back disappeared from his vision, the young man smiled slightly, “Interesting!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Rude boy!” The old man coldly snorted.

“Why does Old Ji say that?” The young man looked at the old man in surprise.

Ji Jun snorted, “That boy discovered that this old master and Second Young Master were sitting here, and also seemed to realize that the change in Qu Zheng’s attitude had something to do with us, but rather than thank us he simply chose to leave. How is that not rude?”

The young man was slightly surprised, “That person was even able to sense where Old Ji was hiding?”

Ji Jun nodded, “Second Young Master may not have seen it clearly, but that man glanced towards us directly before he left. Obviously, he found us long ago.”

The young man raised his brows, “Old Ji is a master at the peak of the First-Order Origin King Realm. Without a Divine Sense equivalent to a Second-Order Origin King’s, it should be impossible to find Old Ji. Doesn’t that mean this person really has a Second-Order cultivation?”

Ji Jun frowned slightly and pondered for a moment before saying, “This old master didn’t dare to probe too much, so he is unable to judge the cultivation of this person exactly. Although Lu Tian Feng had direct contact with him, according to him, he also could not see through the other party’s strength... so it seems that even if this person isn’t as strong as this old master, he may not be far off. As for whether he is a Second-Order or not, that remains to be verified.”

The young man grinned, “Good, good! It seems he dares act so arrogant because he has the strength to back it up; en, very much to this Young Lord’s liking.”

“Second Young Master...” Ji Jun looked at the young man hesitantly, “Do you want to recruit this person?”

The young man nodded, “Yes, the waters in Purple Star City have become turbulent for some time now. The faction headed by Great Elder is actively acting and has already touched many things it shouldn’t. If this Young Lord does not act decisively, then Purple Star’s surname will surely change.”

Ji Jun’s face changed slightly as he coldly snorted, “Great Elder’s faction must be seeking death if that’s really the case. After Master returns, they will all definitely be held accountable. However, Second Young Master, you... you have been keeping a low profile for so many years, so why are you anxious this time? Master and Young Master have been missing for almost two years, but after the Master left two years ago, he said that he and the Young Lord would be going out to take care of some important matters. They may return any time now. If Master returns and finds Second Young Master has... Second Young Master should understand. With Master’s ability, there are not many people in the Star Field who can threaten him, and fewer who can kill him. He will return sooner or later.”

A faint worry flashed across the young man’s eyes, but it disappeared just as quickly as he chuckled and said, “What Old Ji said is true, but it is not that this Young Lord is anxious, it’s just... time will not wait for me. What’s more, I am not doing this for my sake, but for the Zi Family. Even if Father comes back, he won’t blame me for my actions.”

“I hope so,” Ji Jun nodded worriedly, seeing the young man in front of him insist on this, ceasing his admonishing.

“Old Ji, from your perspective, do you think I can win this person over?” The young man stared in the direction Yang Kai was leaving and asked.

“Everyone has a price, it only depends on whether Second Young Master can afford it.”

“En, what Old Ji said is true,” The young man smiled lightly. “In that case, we need to find out this man’s wants. Heh, Purple Star’s Third Venerable... This is a force that cannot be underestimated. At this point, he must not be allowed to slip away from this Young Lord’s palm!”

As he spoke, he clenched his fist, as if to clench the entire world, his purple hair flying out behind him...

When Yang Kai and Hua You Meng returned to Five Paths Chamber of Commerce, he could not help frowning as he narrowed his eyes towards the inside.

He discovered that there was an Origin King in the chamber of commerce, sitting in the backyard at this moment. Yang Kai did not know what this person was here for, only that the aura wasn’t familiar, so it definitely wasn’t Lu Tian Feng.

At that point in time, Gao Hong hurriedly came out from the chamber of commerce to greet them with an anxious look on her face.

“Sister Hong, what happened?” Hua You Meng looked at Gao Hong suspiciously.

Gao Hong glanced at Yang Kai and said softly, “Eighth Elder is waiting in the back... for Sir!”

“Eighth Elder?” Hua You Meng’s mind went dizzy as she almost fell over, her beautiful eyes glancing over at Yang Kai with a complicated look in them, feeling quite uneasy.

Since Yang Kai appeared in their Five Paths Chamber of Commerce, these great Sirs, who Hua You Meng only knew of before by reputation, were visiting her small shop one after another, causing her to feel like she was caught in some kind of strange, fantastical dream.

It was almost like the small Five Paths Chamber of Commerce had become a giant invisible vortex that was drawing in these powerful masters one by one.

What worried Hua You Meng was that any one of these Sirs could grind the chamber of commerce into dust with a single finger. Worse yet, it was actually Eighth Elder, the ancestor of Jiang Chao from before, who had come here. Could it be that the Eighth Elder’s sudden visit was related to what happened just now?

Hua You Meng panicked suddenly and could only turn to Yang Kai pleadingly, “Sir.”

Yang Kai just frowned slightly before saying, “I’ll go take a look.”

Although he had already expected to be embroiled in countless troubles once he took out the Venerable Token, he hadn’t expected trouble to find him so quickly.

Yang Kai had never met Purple Star’s Eighth Elder, but the latter was no doubt an Origin King Realm master. Yang Kai also did not know what purpose the other party had in coming here, but he was at least certain it had nothing to do with Jiang Chao; after all, the timing was too tight. This Eighth Elder could not possibly have taken action so quickly for such a minor matter.

It seemed this Eighth Elder had some other business with him.

In the backyard, a white-faced old man was waiting gloomily, an extremely impatient look on his face. It was none other than Purple Star’s Eighth Elder, Jiang Chang Feng. To the side, Xia Jing Wu, Yao Qing, Hai Tang, and several others were standing nervously, stiff smiles pasted on their faces as none of them dared to even breathe loudly.

How were they even supposed to handle a Sir of this status? Although many came and went in Purple Star City, the overwhelming majority were Origin Returning Realm masters or Saint Kings. In fact, before recently, none of them had even spoken to an Origin King before.

The encounter with Lu Tian Feng last night was the first time any of them had been close to such a master.

But today, an Elder with even higher status than Lu Tian Feng had appeared! What’s more, this Eighth Elder didn’t seem to be in a very good mood. An oppressive aura radiated from his body, causing Xia Jing Wu and the others’ blood to roil. It was only with some difficulty that all of them managed to suppress the rioting of their vitality, so they didn’t cough up blood.

“You call this tea?” Jiang Chang Feng impatiently took a sip from the teacup on the table before furiously throwing it onto the ground and shouting, “You’re quite bold! This Elder came here in person, yet you dare use such poor quality tea to entertain him? Could it be that you don’t put this Elder in your eyes?!”

Xia Jing Wu shivered with fright as he was forced to the ground by the other party’s coercion and tremblingly said, “Eighth Elder, please understand, that was not our intention. This Distant Mountain Fog Tea is the best our Five Paths Chamber of Commerce has to offer.”

“This is your best tea? It’s nothing but garbage!” Jiang Chang Feng coldly snorted, his expression extremely displeased.

Xia Jing Wu smiled bitterly just thinking of the other party’s strength and status. How could the tea their small chamber of commerce possibly compare to the tea this Eighth Elder drank on a day to day basis?

This Distant Mountain Fog Tea was a rare and expensive brew for Five Paths Chamber of Commerce, but it was directly rated as trash by Eighth Elder.

Hai Tang and Yao Qing looked at the tea splashed on the floor and distressed expressions flashed across their faces. They were quite reluctant to drink this tea themselves and reserved it only for entertaining honored guests.

“Sir, please calm yourself. If this tea does not suit Sir’s taste, shall this old man go out and buy some better tea?” Xia Jing Wu accompanied him carefully.

“Hmph, there’s no need,” Jiang Chang Feng said gloomily, “This Elder didn’t come here to drink tea. Where is the one I’m looking for? Why is he still not here?”

“This...” Xia Jing Wu turned his head and looked out the door, but not seeing any approaching figures, a cold sweat broke out on his forehead, “Reporting to Eighth Elder, that Sir went out with our President early in the morning and I don’t know where they went.”

“Then why aren’t you out looking for him?” Jiang Chang Feng was in an irritable mood and as he asked, he exerted an even stronger pressure onto Xia Jing Wu and the others and shouted, “I’ll give you a stick of incense worth of time, if you can’t find him by then...”

“You’ll do what?” Before Jiang Chang Feng’s words were finished, a different voice sounded from the chamber of commerce. As soon as this voice spoke, a person suddenly appeared from the building and quickly stood in front of Xia Jing Wu and the others, lifted his hand, and gently scattered the pressure weighing on them.

“Sir!” Xia Jing Wu and the others stared at Yang Kai’s back joyfully, “You’ve returned.”

Yao Qing and Hai Tang also looked at Yang Kai with grateful expressions. Although they were not familiar with Yang Kai, him appearing at this moment and helping them earned their gratitude.

As an Origin King himself, Yang Kai faced this Eighth Elder without any fear.

Yang Kai swept his eyes back and frowned when he saw Xia Jing Wu and the others’ condition, a trace of anger flashing across his face as he stretched out his hand to pull them up one by one before saying, “You can leave now.”

“Yes!” Xia Jing Wu and others did not raise any objections hearing these words and quickly ran out, panting heavily after they reached the interior of the shop, their faces pale.

In the backyard, Yang Kai turned his head to look at Jiang Chang Feng coldly before sneering, “Your Excellency certainly has an imposing air!”

Jiang Chang Feng frowned as he looked at Yang Kai, releasing his Divine Sense blatantly to probe him, seemingly wanting to spy on Yang Kai’s cultivation, but in the next moment, he realized that he could not see through the other party’s background.

Just when Jiang Chang Feng wanted to take his Divine Sense back, a look of amazement appeared on his face, because the other party’s body seemed to have turned into a whirlpool that drew in his Divine Sense continuously.

Jiang Chang Feng was shocked and desperately urged his Divine Sense to break free.

At that exact moment, the whirlpool that was holding his Divine Sense disappeared strangely.

Jiang Chang Feng couldn’t stop his actions in time, so his Divine Sense was drawn back forcefully, causing a powerful gust of wind while also rocking his Knowledge Sea.

With a muffled snort, Jiang Chang Feng stumbled back a few steps, his face turning pale as if he had suffered some small injuries.

There was a sneer at the corner of Yang Kai’s mouth as he looked at him mockingly.

This grin made Jiang Chang Feng a little bit embarrassed as he realized he had kicked an iron plate. More-so irritated though, he shot back, “Friend, what is your intention here?”

“What do you think my intention is?” Yang Kai coldly snorted.
