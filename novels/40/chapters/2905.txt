Lan Xun answered, “There seems to be something wrong with the fourth layer of the pagoda. Many Small Worlds were shattered, which caused some impact on the structure of the pagoda itself. Uncle Xiao and the others have been doing everything they can to stabilize the pagoda until everyone exits. Otherwise, once the space collapses, the people inside will be trapped.”

A drop of cold sweat silently trickled down Yang Kai’s back as he asked in as calm a voice as possible, “How could a treasure like the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda have such a problem?”

Lan Xun looked in the direction of the pagoda, and shook her head, “I don’t know either. I’ve never encountered such a thing before.”

Yang Kai laughed awkwardly, “Then I must have bad luck to encounter such a problem my first time coming here.”

He dared not say too much. Fortunately, his current state was quite weak, so even if his expression was a bit difficult, he would not attract too much attention.

Given that the problem of the fourth layer of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda was due to the shattering of Small Worlds, Yang Kai knew that it must have something to do with him. He had collected a tremendous amount of World Principles into his Sealed World Beads on the fourth layer, destroying those shattered worlds, an outcome that he had never expected.

Fortunately, the consequences did not seem to be irreparable or too serious.

As they were talking, two figures flashed in front of the pagoda’s entrance. It was Xiao Chen and Lei Ting, who came out together. They also entered the fifth layer of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, but they had their own opportunities. By the look of their faces, one could guess who had gained and who had suffered a loss.

Xiao Chen looked gleeful and was full of self-confidence, obviously having benefited greatly from the fifth layer.

Lei Ting’s face on the other hand was gloomy and his aura was weak. His injuries looked more serious than Yang Kai’s, so perhaps he had suffered some setbacks.

Nevertheless, both setbacks and benefits were parts of the growth that cultivators must experience. With perseverance, one could turn setbacks into valuable experience, as well as a driving force to progress further on the path of cultivation.

Xiao Chen and Lei Ting were the last to come out, so after the two appeared, Xiao Yu Yang bellowed, “Everyone, leave here now.”

The Star Soul Palace disciples received the order, saluted the four Elders, and dispersed.

Yang Kai and Lan Xun also left together.

Not far away, Yang Kai suddenly felt an extremely strong power fluctuation coming out of the Void. When he turned around, he saw a moonlight-like radiance coming out from somewhere in Star Soul Palace, striking right at the middle of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda.

This radiance was not an attack, but rather some kind of miraculous technique. After the light arrived, Xiao Yu Yang and the others turned solemn, quickly weaving all kinds of hand seals while stabilizing the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda.

Yang Kai’s face turned solemn. He knew that the moonlight-like radiance was the Great Emperor taking action.

In the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld, he also faced and fought with someone who was on par with a Great Emperor, so he was naturally familiar with this level of strength.

Demon Saint Mo Duo was comparable to the existence of a Great Emperor, and Yang Kai had a life or death battle against him. Back then, during the fight between Heaven Devouring Great Emperor and Bustling World Great Emperor in the Shattered Star Sea, Yang Kai was lucky enough to encounter it and play some small role at its conclusion, but saying he actually fought would be an exaggeration. Furthermore, the two Great Emperors could not unleash their full strength at that time.

But the experience in the dreamworld was different. Even if it was all an illusion, it had a basis in reality. In other words, the power released by Mo Duo was the true strength of a Great Emperor.

Yang Kai had used all his means without any reservation, yet he was still no match for him. If Mo Duo had not underestimated Yang Kai so greatly in the early stages of the fight, and allowed him to perform so many Secret Techniques, and if his focus had not been on stopping the Evergreen Divine Tree in the later stage, Yang Kai’s odds of surviving would have absolutely been less than thirty percent, while winning was simply impossible.

Even so, Yang Kai could not hold him back, and in the end, he had to rely on some deception and tricks to drag him into resisting Great Demon God’s cross-world attack.

This was an extremely valuable memory and experience. As long as Yang Kai could absorb the experience of that battle, he believed his strength would improve notably.

At this moment, the Great Emperor’s technique was so mysterious that Yang Kai could not even compare it with Mo Duo’s, because he could feel that the Bright Moon Great Emperor was definitely stronger than Mo Duo.

Lan Xun also stopped her feet and turned around to look at the moonlight-like radiance, pursing her lips with bitterness because she had not seen her father in a long time.

“Junior Sister Lan.” Yang Kai suddenly called out, “It’s time for me to leave.”

He destroyed many small worlds on the fourth layer of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, and Xiao Yu Yang and the other Elders surely suspected him. When Yang Kai came out just now, the few Third-Order Emperor Realm Elders had all been observing him; however, as long as Yang Kai did not admit to anything, they could not blame him, so they could only let him leave.

Nevertheless, the butterfly hairpin in his possession was the key to the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld, a Sealed World that technically belonged to Star Soul Palace. To put it nicely, it was Yang Kai’s opportunity, but to put it bluntly, he was stealing.

Yang Kai naturally did not want to stay longer and draw unwanted attention from Star Soul Palace after stealing from them, not to mention that he still had something else to do.

Lan Xun looked at Yang Kai in surprise and asked, “Is Senior Brother Yang leaving now?”

“En, I have a prior appointment to keep.”

“But Senior Brother Yang, you seem to be hurt. Are you sure you don’t want to rest here for a day or two before you leave?” Lan Xun asked with concern.

Yang Kai smiled and shook his head, “No, I’m fine. My injuries only need some time to heal.”

There was no trauma in his body, and the injury to his Soul could not be recovered with rest alone. Fortunately, he had the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus, so all he needed was time.

“I see…” Lan Xun did not try to convince him further as she saw that he had made up his mind to leave, so she just smiled happily and said, “In that case, Junior Sister won’t keep Senior Brother Yang any further. Senior Brother Yang, be safe.”

Yang Kai replied, “About the Elders…”

Lan Xun smiled, “I will inform them when they are finished.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Many thanks,” Yang Kai cupped his fist, then turned around and flew out of Star Soul Palace.

Lan Xun stood in place, only leaving after watching his back disappear out of her vision. Not far away, Xiao Chen, who had been secretly observing them, was slightly relieved.

After leaving Star Soul Palace, Yang Kai checked his directions before flying straight towards the location of Thousand Leaves Sect.

His Soul was still injured, so he did not fly quickly. On his way, he recalled all the scenes of his battle with Mo Duo and studied them intently, trying to think of what different approaches he could have taken. He gained a lot through this trip into the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld, with the fight against Mo Duo being just one of his gains. He had actually gained so much he hadn’t had time to digest everything yet; as such, he needed to spend some time sorting out the memories in his mind.

Suddenly, Yang Kai noticed something and stopped in his tracks to stare ahead.

A man stood mid-air before him, a young and handsome man who seemed no older than twenty. He carried one hand behind his back and put the other hand naturally on his abdomen, behaviour more appropriate for an old man that did not match his appearance at all.

Yang Kai put on a serious expression, because he found that this ‘young man’s’ aura was unreadable. He could not sense anything about this person and even his eyes felt like they couldn’t clearly see his real appearance. Even though his Soul was injured now, any ordinary Emperor Realm Masters would not be able to conceal themselves before him like this since his Soul was far more powerful than his Realm would suggest.

However, just now, Yang Kai had not noticed anything at all. It was as if this man had suddenly appeared in front of him without any prior signs.

There were only two possibilities, either the other party’s cultivation was much higher than his own, or he was using some kind of special artifact.

Yang Kai looked at the other party, who was also looking at him, with an unfathomable smile on his face.

Yang Kai did not feel good about this smile and frowned and asked, “What’s the matter, Friend?”

The man simply opened his mouth and spat out a word that frightened Yang Kai to the core, “Bind!”

Ten thousand Principles seemed to obey this one word.

Yang Kai’s body suddenly stiffened as he inexplicably felt that the surrounding space solidified around him like a thick rope, tying him up tightly. At this moment, he was petrified to a point that even making a small movement with his finger had become extremely difficult for him.

Yang Kai was aghast as he had not felt any trace of his opponent using a Secret Technique or Divine Ability. All of this seemed to simply be a manifestation of his will through his words.

This was unachievable by any Third-Order Emperor Realm Master. In fact, there was only one kind of Master in this world who could do this.

Given that this place was near Star Soul Palace, the identity of this ‘young man’ became obvious.

“You…” Yang Kai was shocked and angry at the same time. He did not expect that such a supreme Master would stop and attack him here. What did this mean? If he wanted to make a move, he had a lot of opportunities when Yang Kai was still in the Star Soul Palace earlier, so why intercept him outside?

Furthermore, as someone with such status, what could he gain from acting stealthily? Yang Kai did not understand, and he did not have time to think about it.

As soon as he spoke, with a flash before his eyes, the ‘young man’ who was a thousand metres away a moment ago appeared right in front of him like a ghost, scaring the wits out of Yang Kai.

He finally experienced the feeling of those enemies who were caught off guard by him using his Space Techniques.

The two were now face to face, but the ‘young man’ did not do anything, simply continuing to quietly observe Yang Kai with a calm and relaxed smile.

Looking into the man’s eyes, Yang Kai felt like he could see two full moons blooming with astonishing light. Under the shadow of this light, everything about Yang Kai seemed to be revealed, all his secrets open and exposed without any way to hide from this man’s eyes.

Yang Kai was infuriated. Although he knew who the opponent was, he still did not allow anyone to pry on his secrets. He was immobilized, and could not think as quickly as he normally would, but Yang Kai still managed to mount a forceful resistance.

He madly surged his Spiritual Energy, and the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus in his Knowledge Sea suddenly started to rotate wildly, like a spinning top, rotating faster and faster.

A seven coloured glow exploded and filled his entire Knowledge Sea.

A shower of moonlight descended upon Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea from above, and initially, everything that was shone upon by the moonlight was revealed, but at this moment, the seven coloured glow actually swept out and dispersed that moonlight.

The ‘young man’ let out a light sound of surprise as he obviously did not expect Yang Kai to still have the power to fight back against his investigation.
