The three Managers of the Fierce Gale Pirates all had their own unique skills. The Head Manager Sheng Yao needed no introduction. As someone in the Second-Order Origin King Realm, he could easily be ranked as one of the most powerful Masters in the entire Star Field.

The Second Manager Ma Chao Qun was a fair-skinned and naive-looking fatty, but the fat on his body wasn’t just a result of his overeating habit; it was also his life-saving card. With incredible defensive capabilities, his excess flesh was an incredibly sturdy shield. With the help of his fat, he was able to temporarily stand against a Master who was one Minor Realm higher than him.

Nevertheless, he could only parry a few moves, as his fat couldn’t make up the entire difference in cultivation.

As for the Third Manager Ge Ming, he was a short but sturdy man whose speciality was assassination. He was an elusive man, as no one could possibly find out his exact location.

An enemy lurking in the dark was the most horrifying. It was said that it was easy to dodge a spear out in the light, but it was hard to avoid an arrow in the dark. The person who mounted a sneak attack on Lu Huai Shuang was undoubtedly the Fierce Gale Pirates Third Manager, Ge Ming.

Lu Huai Shuang’s speculation earlier was right, that the Fierce Gale Pirates would go all out whenever they made a move. Ma Chao Qun was lying when he said that his Big Brother and Third Brother were attending to other matters.

With his exceptional Concealment Technique, Ge Ming was able to approach Lu Huai Shuang unnoticed, and just when her focus was completely on Ma Chao Qun and He Wu Zui, he struck.

He was also a First-Order Origin King Realm, and gained a big advantage by executing a sneak attack, so he was confident that his strike would severely injure Lu Huai Shuang, if not kill her. She was the leader of the Lu Family, and as long as they could kill or immobilize this woman, the others from the Lu Family would be easy to deal with.

Everything went according to plan, but the accident that happened all of a sudden terrified Ge Ming.

In the blink of an eye, a young man in tattered clothes was standing in front of Lu Huai Shuang as he stared calmly at Ge Ming. Although there was no emotion behind the young man’s gaze, Ge Ming subconsciously felt lowly before him, as though this young man was a towering mountain that stretched up into the Heavens. He tilted his head back, but still couldn’t see the top of the mountain. Even the clouds partway up the mountain appeared blurred.

[Who is this man!?] He had noticed this ‘corpse’ when he was approaching Lu Huai Shuang secretly, but as he was lying at her feet without showing any sign of vitality, Ge Ming assumed he was dead and didn’t bother with him. However, how did a dead man get to his feet all of a sudden? Moreover, how did his vitality surge so tremendously in that instant!?

Ge Ming’s panic was only temporary, however. Since he was able to reach the Origin King Realm, there was no doubt that his mental fortitude was outstanding, so after hesitating for a moment between retreating and advancing, he steeled himself. As a cold glint flashed across his slender dagger, he charged forward at an even greater speed.

[I don’t care who you are, but with such a short distance between us, I’ll still be able to stab you first even if you’re a Third-Order Origin King!]

“Get back!” Lu Huai Shuang finally came to her senses at that moment. Ge Ming was advancing instead of retreating with a ferocious gaze, but this young man didn’t react to it at all, so she couldn’t help but call out to him as she reached out her hand and grabbed his shoulder in an attempt to pull him back.

However, what shocked her was that this young man still gave no reaction at all, as if roots had grown from his feet. Not only could she not pull him back, but she was also forced to stagger forward and almost crash into his back from the recoil.

Just then, a clanging sound could be heard. The ferocious expression on Ge Ming’s face froze, then it was replaced by extreme fear. When he raised his head to look at the young man, his eyes seemed to be trembling uncontrollably.

Before he made a move, he had imagined many possible outcomes in his mind, the most likely being him killing this reckless boy with one strike. Perhaps his strike would only wound him though, or even less likely this young man would somehow parry his thrust…

However, Ge Ming had never expected that the sight before his eyes would be the outcome instead. This young man remained unmoving and simply allowed him to stab his dagger into his chest. Nevertheless, his weapon couldn’t penetrate the young man’s body, and there didn’t seem to be any wound on the young man’s skin. Instead, the glow on his slender dagger faded greatly and he almost dropped his weapon due to a sharp pain coming from his hand.

The slender dagger was an Origin King Grade Artifact which was extremely sharp and could even penetrate fine metal armour easily, let alone a Human’s body.

Ge Ming couldn’t even sense any energy fluctuation from the young man. In other words, this strange-looking young man had managed to withstand his attack with nothing more than his physique completely unharmed.

[Is he really Human?]

Ge Ming was an assassin who excelled at ending a person’s life with one decisive strike, but he was also extremely sensitive to danger. Therefore, when he realized that his assault couldn’t harm the young man, he immediately decided to run. His thin figure became blurred, as though he would vanish into thin air soon.

He had to flee, for the young man’s presence had defied his understanding of the world. The voice in his heart screamed that he had to escape now or he would die!

Just then, the young man raised his hand in a slow and stiff manner, then he nonchalantly grabbed the air, upon which Ge Ming, who was about to vanish from sight, seemed to have his neck clenched, his half-transparent figure solidifying in an instant.

For some unfathomable reason, his Concealment Technique was dispersed, and at that instant, he felt his Soul leaving his body. The seemingly casual grip around his neck seemed capable of snapping him in half at will, and no matter how hard he tried to struggle, all his attempts were utterly futile.

The young man raised his arm lightly and lifted Ge Ming off his feet, a sight that terrified all present. Ge Ming was an Origin King, but now, he had been captured by an unknown young man with complete ease and hoisted up like a powerless chicken.

“Third Brother!” The smile on Ma Chao Qun’s face was long gone as his chubby face appeared extremely solemn.

He Wu Zui’s expression also appeared grim as he silently summoned his artifact, his gaze darting around as though he was looking for an escape route.

Right in front of everyone’s eyes, the young man sized up Ge Ming for a moment before he frowned, knitting his brow as he muttered, “So weak…”

He hadn’t fought with someone in the Origin King Realm in ages. Over the years, the opponents he had come across were all Masters with more powerful cultivations than his own, which was why he was no longer used to dealing with someone so much weaker than himself and at that instant, he reminisced about his previous battles with a conflicted feeling.

[I was one of these weak cultivators in the past as well…]

“May I ask for Your Excellency’s honoured name?” Ma Chao Qun asked in a grim voice as he tried to recall the faces and figures of the true Overlords of the Star Field, but none of them resembled the young man before his eyes. He had never heard about a young man like him, who had such extraordinary power. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Trash like you have no right to know my name,” the young man snorted.

His manner of speaking was extremely haughty, but no one found it to be awkward, for he had the power to match his overbearing behaviour. If anyone else spoke in the way he did, that person would have been laughed at.

Ma Chao Qun wouldn’t even dare to blow his top as he gulped and cupped his fists, “Please forgive us for offending you, Your Excellency, and show mercy for my Third Brother. If you could find it in your heart to release him, we will take our leave now and never show ourselves before you again.”

Although he appeared humble and polite, he was viciously cursing He Wu Zui in his heart. [Fourth Brother is such a fool! He didn’t even realize that the Lu Family had gotten the support of such a Master! We came all the way here just to be humiliated! Now, we don’t even know if this young man will let us off. If we manage to escape today, we’ll definitely make a clean break with Fourth Brother! If we stay with him any longer, we’ll lose our lives sooner or later!]

“Do you think you can come and go as you please? Do you think I’ll let you off so easily?” The young man sneered.

Although he was in a special state earlier, it didn’t mean he wasn’t aware of what was going on. Upon hearing their conversation, he had figured out what happened with these people and even though he didn’t consider himself to be a righteous person, he wouldn’t mind lending a hand when someone was in trouble.

Ma Chao Qun lamented in his heart, but he could only speak respectfully, “We acknowledge that the punishment is deserved, so please inform us of what Your Excellency wants from us.”

He couldn’t even figure out how powerful this young man’s cultivation was, so he wasn’t confident of going against him. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have appeared so meek. After all, he was someone with power and status.

The young man frowned as he despised this fatty for his readiness to yield, his killing intent fading greatly.

*Hong Long Long…*

Just then, a rumbling sounded across the sky and at the same time, the aura of the entire world seemed to have turned dangerous. At the same time, high up in the sky, lightning arcs began to crackle.

Everyone’s expression changed greatly as they looked up at the sky, only to see a dark swirl in the clouds. There seemed to be a Thunder Dragon swimming through this black vortex, one that emitted a Heaven-destroying and Earth-shattering power.

“What’s wrong with you!? I’ve already hidden so well!” The young man gazed up at the sky and cursed out loud.

Lu Huai Shuang frowned and stared at the young man’s figure with a weird expression wondering if he was cursing the Heavens.

All of a sudden, she felt sympathetic towards this young man. His cultivation appeared extremely powerful, and his actions just now showed he was a brave and heroic character. Upon a closer look, she realized that he was good-looking as well. Unfortunately, he seemed to be suffering from some kind of mental illness. If not, why would he be cursing the Heavens?

[Perhaps even the Heavens are jealous of such a talented man?] Lu Huai Shuang suddenly had this thought in her mind.

While she was still lost in contemplation, a booming sound was suddenly heard, which caused all of their eardrums to tremble. As though it was responding to the young man’s curse, a large beam of lightning shot out of the vortex towards the young man, one that seemed to tear about the world wherever it travelled.

All who witnessed this had goosebumps all over their bodies. Lu Huai Shuang, who was closest to the young man, turned ashen in an instant. It couldn’t be helped, as the lightning had a specific target, and it was going to strike the young man accurately.

[He is going to be struck by Heavenly Lightning! How wicked must he be that even the Heavens cannot allow him to live anymore!?]

“Run!” The young man suddenly turned around and grabbed Lu Huai Shuang’s collars before hurling her away.

Lu Huai Shuang hadn’t even realized what was going on before she was sent flying away like an arrow. As she flew backwards, she saw the giant lightning bolt strike the young man. In an instant, his black hair stood on end, upon which a 1,000-metre radius around him turned into a sea of lightning.

Those cultivators who didn’t escape in time were charred to death instantly without even a chance to scream. A burnt smell then filled the air, as though someone was having a barbeque. When the others caught a whiff of that smell, many felt the urge to start retching.

The lightning kept striking the young man for quite some time. During this period of time, beams of lightning came pouring down on that young man from the dark vortex, causing him to convulse uncontrollably, as though he was suffering from a foul plague. All of them could see that he must be in excruciating pain.
