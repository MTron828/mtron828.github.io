After finishing several bottles of wine, the woman belched loudly with a contented expression on her face. She wiped away the remains of the wine from the corner of her lips before exhaling a long breath and standing up, raising her hands and cheering, “I feel alive again!”

Her anaemic complexion from before had vanished without a trace, and her face became flushed instead. There were two more bottles of wine, but she didn’t drink them, instead lovingly storing them into her own Space Ring before lifting her head and asking, “Da Jun, are you here to save me?”

Nanmen Da Jun sneered coldly, “What do you think?”

“So, when are we getting married?” She asked.

“Scram!”

The woman curled her lips, muttering something under her breath. From the way her lips moved, it seemed like she was cursing somebody. In the next moment, she glanced at Yang Kai and smilingly asked Nanmen Da Jun, “Who is this Little Brother? He has a good figure. Is he rich? Did he bring me some good wine?”

“Cease your impudence!” Nanmen Da Jun coldly snorted, “This is the Palace Master of High Heaven Palace! You foolish woman; quickly come and give your greetings!”

“High Heaven Palace?” She tilted her head to the side and pondered for a moment before smiling carefreely, “Never heard of it before. Where did it pop out from?”

Nanmen Da Jun quickly snapped, “It doesn’t matter even if you’ve never heard of it before! The important point is that I am now the Chief Array Master of High Heaven Palace!”

The cheeky smile on the woman’s face stiffened instantly as she turned to look at him in astonishment, then glanced at Yang Kai. After that, she stepped forward and placed her hand on Nanmen Da Jun’s forehead.

“What are you doing?!” He took a step back warily.

“Have you finally gone crazy?” She asked curiously.

“You’re the one who’s gone crazy!” He shouted furiously, “Your entire family is crazy!”

A peel of laughter left the woman’s lips before she twirled around and landed on the smooth rock from before as she condescendingly said, “Why would you join a Sect if you hadn’t gone crazy? I recall that you have always sneered at those Sects, be they large or small.”

“Naturally, I have my own reasons for joining High Heaven Palace.” Nanmen Da Jun groaned.

The woman’s expression changed abruptly as she had known Nanmen Da Jun for many years now. They had met each other when they were still young and weak; then, over the years, they had worked together on many occasions and slowly grown stronger together. It could be said that she understood him completely; therefore, she knew what his attitude was like toward those Sects that were trying to recruit him. If he had any intention to join a Sect, he would be free to choose from almost all the Sects in the Star Boundary, be they the smallest and weakest, or the most powerful. Even Great Emperor Sects would welcome him if he showed interest in joining them. The last time she met him, he had still been working alone; yet now, she suddenly discovered that he had joined a Sect called High Heaven Palace. That was enough to shock her to the extreme.

[The Palace Master of High Heaven Palace? He only has a First-Order Emperor Realm cultivation, so how powerful could the Sect he founded be? What does it have that can attract somebody like Da Jun to join it?] The woman tilted her head to the side and studied Yang Kai carefully, as if she was trying to stare a hole into him.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai stared back at her with a smile; however, his heart was full of sorrow and remorse as he thought to himself, [Should I just go back and forget about this? Even if I recruit such an Emperor Artifact Refiner into High Heaven Palace, it might not necessarily be a good thing.]

A long while later, the woman made a fist with one hand and hammered it into her other palm with a look of epiphany. Then, she glanced at Nanmen Da Jun in surprise and said, “Da Jun, we have known each other for so many years, but it’s only now that I discovered that you don’t love women! No wonder you refused to marry me all these years!”

“Y-Y-You—” Nanmen Da Jun was so furious that steam was practically rising from his head. He pointed at her and stuttered, “You foolish woman!” Turning his head to look at Yang Kai, who had a sullen expression as well, he anxiously said, “Palace Master, this woman is a lunatic! Please ignore what she says!”

“Just who are you calling a ‘lunatic’?” She glared.

On the other hand, Yang Kai stepped forward and lightly said, “Da Jun said there was an outstanding Emperor Artifact Refiner here, so I came with great sincerity and expectations, but now, it seems… Tsk.”

“What do you mean by ‘Tsk’?” The woman suddenly became disgruntled, flying over to him in a flash, widening her almond eyes as she reached out, grabbed him by the collar, and angrily snarled, “You better explain yourself well, otherwise you will suffer the consequences!”

“Let go!” Nanmen Da Jun was startled and hurriedly shouted. Of course, he was not worried about Yang Kai, but was instead concerned Yang Kai might get angry. His ‘friend’ would definitely suffer at Yang Kai’s hands if a fight broke out. They might both be First-Order Emperors, but she definitely wasn’t his opponent.

However, Yang Kai simply raised his hand to stop Nanmen Da Jun before he glanced back at the woman with contempt and sneered, “Since you are a Grandmaster, you should carry the dignity of a Grandmaster. Unfortunately, I can’t find a single shred of the poise that a Grandmaster would possess. You give off the impression of a countryside bumpkin instead. To be honest, I am very disappointed.”

She released her hold on his collar and laughed mockingly, “What a joke! Are you saying that all the so-called Grandmasters should be polite and sanctimonious? Sorry, I was born like this.”

Yang Kai smiled back lightly and quipped, “So, you consider yourself a Grandmaster?”

She coldly snorted, “I don’t dare to say that about anything else, but nobody is better than me in this world when it comes to Artifact Refining.”

“What arrogance. Be careful not to bite your tongue.”

She smiled deviously in response, confidence overflowing from her words.

“Anybody can talk big, but I wonder if you can actually prove it.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You want me to prove myself?” She glared at Yang Kai, seeing his look of provocation, before instantly becoming incensed, “Good, good, good. Elder Sister here will make you understand how great she is!”

Stretching her hand out, she said to Nanmen Da Jun, “Give me some materials!”

Nanmen Da Jun glanced at Yang Kai questioningly. He understood what Yang Kai was aiming for by now, a test of her Artifact Refining abilities.

It wasn’t as if this woman had not seen through Yang Kai’s intentions either, but that didn’t decrease the frustration she felt for having her qualifications questioned. Therefore, she went along with this farce despite knowing that Yang Kai was simply using his words to provoke her.

Seeing Yang Kai nodding in agreement, to which Nanmen Da Jun asked, “What materials do you want?”

“Anything would do!”

Only then did Nanmen Da Jun start rummaging in his Space Ring. During his time as the Chief Array Master of High Heaven Palace, he had been busy with arranging Spirit Arrays which required large amounts of materials, so he had quite a lot of them in his ring. He soon found a piece of ore about the size of a melon and threw it to the woman.

Yang Kai took a look and recognized the Scarlet Feather Stone at a glance. It was an ore known for its toughness and if it could be smelted with other materials while refining an artifact, the durability of that artifact would be improved. However, it was precisely because of that attribute that the Scarlet Feather Stone could only be used as an auxiliary material, not a primary one. Despite that, Nanmen Da Jun chose that piece of ore without any other materials. It was obvious that he intended to let the woman show off her abilities.

“Open your eyes wide and watch carefully, Little Brother. Don’t even blink or you might miss Elder Sister’s amazing display!” She accepted the Scarlet Feather Stone and smiled at Yang Kai frostily. Her fingers then began to dance agilely as the melon-sized piece of Scarlet Feather Stone started to spin and whirl in her hands. She was in no hurry to finish the refining process and instead lifted the bottle of wine in her hands and took a large gulp. Putting the bottle away, she opened her mouth wide and sprayed out a fine mist of wine.

*Hu…*

Following that sound, a ball of fire burst forth and the temperature in the cave rose exponentially. The fireball did not burn with a normal colour and seemed to be giving off a faint white light instead, probably a type of Heavenly Flame.

Yang Kai’s eyes brightened at the sight. Be it an Artifact Refiner or an Alchemist, their requirements for the fire they used was very high. Having an excellent flame could improve the efficiency and quality of Alchemy and Artifact Refining.

The moment this woman started working, Yang Kai could tell that she was truly very capable. She didn’t even take out her Artifact Refining Furnace, clearly intending to refine this ore on the spot. This refining method required great skill from the Artifact Refiner, and amateurs couldn’t pull it off. What surprised Yang Kai even more though was her mastery of her flames. It was so perfect that it was to the extent of being divine. That mouthful of spirit wine flames that she sprayed out enveloped the Scarlet Feather Stone perfectly, not having the slightest bit of waste.

Under the high temperature, the Scarlet Feather Stone melted quickly. She then held out her beautiful jade-white hand as her fingers moved dexterously to remove the impurities from the ore, drop by drop. At the same time, the Scarlet Feather Stone became smaller and smaller.

Just as condensing medicinal liquid was the first step in Alchemy, removing impurities from ore was the first in Artifact Refining. That was the most basic step, as well as the step that most directly displayed an Alchemist or Artifact Refiner’s skills as everything that followed in the refinement process would depend on how well this first step was executed.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and carefully inspected the state of the Scarlet Feather Stone and the result was quite amazing. After a quarter of an hour, this woman managed to remove all the impurities in the Scarlet Feather Stone without leaving the slightest trace behind. She had achieved perfection in this step! That alone was enough to warrant her status as a Grandmaster.

Yang Kai was thoroughly impressed and the prejudice he felt against her because of her previous slovenly behaviour lessened slightly. As long as she was capable, some lifestyle issues were not completely unacceptable.

Another quarter of an hour later, the Scarlet Feather Stone had transformed into a ball of pure liquid metal about the size of a fist. The woman lifted her head and glanced at him triumphantly, “Little Brother, it’s not too late for you to beg for mercy right now. As long as you can give me several million Source Crystals, I will forgive you for your previous rudeness.”

“Ha!” Yang Kai sneered openly.

“I guess you won’t regret it until you see your coffin! I hate stubborn men like you the most!” She gritted her teeth. Even though she turned her attention away to speak with him, her hand movements did not pause in the slightest. She held the liquid mineral in her small hands as her hands formed various intricate seals one after the other. This led to the liquid metal to burn even hotter while her white flames flickered and fluctuated, obviously varying the temperature at specific positions and points.

The liquid metal was slowly stretched out and gradually took on the shape of a sword. The entire process was visible to the naked eye, and with the passing of time, the appearance of the sword became more and more distinct. The edges of the sword gleamed with a sharp and cold light while intricate designs appeared on its hilt.

Although the refining process looked boring and lacked any particularly thrilling scenes, both Yang Kai and Nanmen Da Jun couldn’t take their eyes off it as they watched intently.

About an hour later, the woman suddenly grabbed a bottle of wine again, and while spraying out a mouthful, the flames were extinguished. This was followed by the sound of something sizzling as a light burst from the sword.

“Done!” The woman casually tossed the sword into the air, allowing it to fall straight down and stab into the ground. The sword proceeded to bury itself into the ground up to its hilt.
