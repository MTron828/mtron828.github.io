“Three thousand people? Shaman Niu, as a Low-Rank Shaman Grandmaster, how can you manage so many people? Your stomach might explode because of your big appetite.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

At the same time, a burly figure fell from the sky and landed beside the mountain of weapons with a bang. The huge impact caused the ground to tremble, sending dust flying, and the whole mountain of weapons clunked noisily.

Yang Kai glanced at the bundle of black hair on the man’s chest, and responded with his brow raised, “Shaman Tu? What can I do for you?”

Shaman Tu laughed, “I’m just worried for you because you’re young and weak.”

“Many thanks for your concern, but you don’t need to worry for me.”

Shaman Tu shook his head, “How can you say that? We are all Shaman Grandmasters of the South Barbarian Clan and we should all help each other. Well, how about this? This Shaman is a little stronger than you, so I should take up more responsibility. You can recruit another thousand people, and I will take care of the remaining thousand for you. In exchange for this Shaman’s kindness… Just give this Shaman the extra weapons.”

After saying so, without giving Yang Kai a chance to respond, he reached out his hand directly towards the mountain of weapons.

“Stop!” Ah Hu was furious. These weapons were purchased at a huge price by Ah Niu. Although he had no clue how Ah Niu obtained so many Monster Cores that could be used for trading, he could not stand idly by and watch someone steal Ah Niu’s property.

[What a rotten Shaman Grandmaster. Whoever dares to rob our belongings is our enemy!]

While shouting angrily, Ah Hu swung his axe at Shaman Tu.

“Scram!” Shaman Tu roared without even turning his head around, immediately creating a visible wave made of compressed air around him. This wind wave obviously contained a massive amount of power because Ah Hu was sent flying into the sky like a paper kite as soon as he collided with it, crashing to the ground a moment later.

At the same time, Shaman Tu grabbed a fine steel spear with his hand. With a slight grasping force, the whole mountain of weapons trembled, and almost half of the weapons flew in the air. It was obvious that he was taking the weapons back to his Barbarian Warriors.

Seeing this, everyone in Shaman Tu’s group was overjoyed and anticipated the arrival of these weapons.

But just then, a figure suddenly appeared on top of the mountain of weapons out of thin air. It was not clear what he did, but the thousands of flying weapons dropped back onto the ground, as if pressed down by a mountain, and collided with each other in a loud clunk.

Mid-air, Yang Kai looked down at Shaman Tu with a teasing face, “Are you trying to rob me?”

Shaman Tu’s face turned red, “How is this robbing? Didn’t you hear me clearly? I already said that everyone here is from the South Barbarian Clan. This Shaman just wants to share your burdens. This Shaman is fine with your lack of gratitude, but Shaman Niu, how dare you spoil this Shaman’s reputation instead?” He justified himself.

Yang Kai sneered, “I didn’t allow you to share my burden.”

Shaman Tu shook his head, “It doesn’t matter whether you allow it or not. This Shaman is always happy to help others, so move away now. Don’t be someone who doesn’t know how to appreciate kindness!”

Yang Kai was amazed, “Shaman Tu, have you no shame? How can you tell such obvious lies with your eyes wide open? Don’t you feel ashamed?”

Sure enough, Shaman Tu blushed in shame, but he continued to stand firm, “Good, good, good, you’re an arrogant little thing, aren’t you. As a High-Rank Shaman Grandmaster, I have the responsibility and obligation to teach you to recognize reality!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his hand and moved his lips in an incantation, and his Shaman Strength fluctuated. Two visible chains of Shaman Strength wrapped themselves around Yang Kai, binding him tightly, seemingly catching him off guard.

Shaman Tu could not help laughing and lectured, “Remember, if you recognize reality now, you will only be a bit embarrassed, but if you can’t see reality on the battlefield, you will lose your life. You don’t need to thank me for this lesson, it is this Shaman’s responsibility to educate his Juniors.” When he spoke, he tightened his grip on his hand in an attempt to drag Yang Kai down from the air.

But his face changed in the next moment as, despite his action, Yang Kai remained hovering over the mountain of weapons motionlessly, as if he was nailed there by some invisible force. Instead, Yang Kai just looked back at him with a grin.

Shaman Tu felt a slight palpitation in his heart and instinctively thought [Impossible!] His opponent was just Low-Rank Shaman Grandmaster, who was two Minor Realms lower than him. Furthermore, Yang Kai was already bound by his spell, so how could his power be resisted?

Shaman Tu could not believe it and immediately tried again, but to his utter shock, he found that it was still ineffective.

It did not seem like he bound a Low-Rank Shaman Grandmaster, but a true mountain instead. His efforts were fruitless, and his face flushed in fury.

Many onlookers were dazed too. They did not understand what happened to Shaman Tu, while some Shaman Grandmasters kept sending him eye signals to end this farce quickly.

Previously, they were those Shaman Grandmasters who gathered to discuss possible countermeasures and they thought that the best way was to create a situation to humiliate Shaman Niu. It was true Shaman Niu brought thousands of weapons here, which attracted the attention of many powerful Barbarian Warriors, arousing their interest in taking refuge with him.

But this interest was only based on these weapons. The clansmen would probably change their mind about joining Shaman Niu if they witnessed his vulnerability through humiliation.

Weapons were indeed tempting, but a weak Shaman Grandmaster was not worthy to be depended on since that would be risking their lives.

Everyone knew the Barbarian Race was about to face a bloody life and death war, so having a powerful Shaman Grandmaster as a leader gave them more security than possessing those weapons.

That was why Shaman Tu jumped out to cause trouble and deliberately fought against Yang Kai. According to their previous plan, as long as they could crush Shaman Niu and humiliate him in front of everyone, he would lose his advantage.

However, the situation now was somewhat different from what they discussed before.

[Shaman Niu has already been successfully entrapped by you, Shaman Tu. So, what are you still waiting for?]

Instantaneously, another High-Rank Shaman Grandmaster flew down and also raised his hand to throw a chain-like Shamanic Spell to bind Yang Kai, shouting harshly, “Shaman Niu, Shaman Tu was too kind-hearted to simply let you bow out in front of everyone, but this Shaman is not as kind as him. Get down now!”

His hand tightened, but instead of Yang Kai, his body faltered and he almost fell to the ground.

The High-Rank Shaman Grandmaster’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets as, at this moment, he realized that it was not Shaman Tu’s intention to be merciful, but that he was really powerless to do anything.

[What happened?]

He looked up bewilderedly and saw that Yang Kai was grabbing their Shamanic Spell Chains with his hands, grinning as he spoke, “The scenery is splendorous up here. This Shaman doesn’t feel like getting down now. How about you come up instead!?”

He abruptly yanked on the chains in his hands and following two pitiful shouts, countless pairs of stunned eyes watched as Shaman Tu and the other Shaman Grandmaster were lifted off the ground and pulled towards Yang Kai involuntarily.

Their limbs flailed helplessly mid-air, and they only managed to stabilize themselves after some effort.

But soon, their hearts sank again.

Because they saw that Shaman Niu looked at them with a sinister smile, palming his fists with clear ill-intention.

Both of them forcibly took a breath and pushed their Shaman Strength together to condense Shield Spells before their bodies.

Just as the radiance of their Shield Spells lit up though, Yang Kai swung his fists at them.

The two punches flew at them like the wind.

*Kacha…*

Following a crisp sound, the Shield Spells protecting the two High-Rank Shaman Grandmasters shattered, unable to resist Yang Kai’s seemingly effortless punches for even a moment.

The two Shaman Grandmasters grunted and flew out like rag sacks, plummeting to the ground heavily with their faces stained with blood.

The whole world fell silent at that moment as everyone looked at Yang Kai in shock like they had encountered a ghost, especially the other Shaman Grandmasters. The corners of their mouths twitched, and their faces spasmed. They could not believe what they had just seen.

It was natural for the Barbarian Warriors to be puzzled because they had not cultivated Shaman Strength before and had no clue about the huge gap between a Low-Rank Shaman Grandmaster and a High-Rank Shaman Grandmaster. Nevertheless, the Shaman Grandmasters present definitely knew about it.

Under normal circumstances, a High-Rank Shaman Grandmaster could crush a Low-Rank Shaman Grandmaster easily as the gap of two Minor Realms was not there for nothing.

But the scene that happened in front of them was so surreal that they could not find a suitable reason to explain it.

The Shield Spells cast by the two Shaman Grandmasters were effortlessly broken by Shaman Niu. If the Shield Spell they used was this weak, why would they work so hard to cultivate it?

The fact was that the Shield Spells weren’t weak, but Shaman Niu was just too terrifyingly strong.

Goosebumps raised all over the Shaman Grandmasters. Previously, they felt a little bitter about him gaining the upper hand in attracting people by bringing in thousands of weapons. Furthermore, some of them were even ready to find trouble with him just like Shaman Tu did, and were waiting for an opportunity to snatch some weapons from him. But now, who would dare to have such thoughts?

If the two High-Rank Shaman Grandmasters were no match for him even when they joined hands, who else could be his opponent?

On the other side, the two Shaman Grandmasters who got beaten up were also lost in confusion.

Shaman Tu took a huge effort to get himself up from the ground, shaking his head to try to clear it. He looked blankly at the eyes of the clansmen around him, and his face changed from pale to red. He immediately became infuriated out of shame and reprimanded, “How dare you launch a sneak attack against me!”

He did not want to admit that he was no match for Yang Kai and felt that the defeat just now was due to a moment of neglect because he did not expect Yang Kai to really attack him. He believed that he would not be embarrassed in front of everyone if he was prepared.

The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. The reason he stepped out to teach Yang Kai a lesson was to take the opportunity to suppress him and raise his own prestige. But he did not expect to go for wool and come home shorn. Not only did his scheme not go as he planned, it completely backfired and he made a fool of himself instead. There was no way for him to give up in this situation because, if he retreated like this, his prestige would plunge and he wouldn’t be able to recruit any more people.

“Surround him for me!” Shaman Tu roared.

When the words fell, nearly two thousand Barbarians rushed out and scattered around, surrounding Yang Kai and the thousand under his lead.

Seeing this, the other Shaman Grandmaster waved his hand silently, and his thousand and a half men also gathered.

For a moment, roughly four thousand people moved at Shaman Tu’s command. Ah Hu and the others tensed up their muscles and held their weapons closely in their hands one after another.

Other uninvolved Barbarians saw this and immediately understood that the issue would not be solved easily this time, quickly stepping aside to make room for the two opposing sides.
