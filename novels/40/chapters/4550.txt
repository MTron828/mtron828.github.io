Heavenly Moon Palace was Zhu Jiu Yin’s place of residence, the woman who was previously Yang Kai’s Protector. They had negotiated a deal with each other when Yang Kai brought her out of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary; however, on his last trip to Shadowless Cave Heaven, Zhu Jiu Yin had agreed to escort him, which was outside the scope of their original agreement, which Yang Kai managed to get her to do on the condition that her identity as a Protector would be lifted.

In other words, Zhu Jiu Yin was now free and no longer bound by her Source Oath, so Yang Kai’s life or death no longer had anything to do with her.

!!

If not to take care of and instruct Shan Qing Luo, someone who shared the same bloodline as her, it was hard to say whether Zhu Jiu Yin would still be in Void Land now.

This woman was not easy to talk to. It took a lot of cajoling to even persuade her to do anything in the past when she was still his Protector, so it may not even work at all now.

When Yang Kai heard about the incident at Three Brilliances World, he guessed that it was Zuo Quan Hui’s doing. When he rushed to Three Brilliances World to support them, he had also specially asked Bian Yu Qing to notify Zhu Jiu Yin so he could borrow her strength.

However, from beginning to end, the woman never showed up. It was obvious that she had no intention of intervening in this matter.

This time, it would probably be fruitless even if he begged her for help.

Since he was already here though, he might as well try.

With his mind made up, Yang Kai cupped his fist and shouted, “Greetings, Senior, Junior Yang Kai requests an audience!”

To his surprise, the doors of Heavenly Moon Palace opened immediately after he spoke. Yang Kai raised a brow, wondering when Zhu Jiu Yin had become so hospitable, until a spider thread suddenly shot out from within and wrapped him up.

Shocked, Yang Kai tried to escape, but he was exhausted from the fight with Zuo Quan Hui and was unable to recover much in such a short amount of time. Being taken off guard, he was caught by the spider web and dragged into Heavenly Moon Palace.

Then, the door closed with a thud!

Soon, there was a series of bangs coming from the inside.

A few moments later, the door opened again, and Yang Kai was thrown out like a ragged sack. After rolling a few times, he stood up in a miserable state with his face bruised and swollen. There were even large black marks around his eyes, naturally a result of Zhu Jiu Yin’s fist.

Yang Kai’s lungs were about to explode from anger; still, he cautiously distanced himself from Heavenly Moon Palace’s entrance before gritting his teeth and roaring, “Crazy woman! Why can’t you use your words instead of your fists!?”

Even though the injuries were not serious, it was still a little embarrassing for Yang Kai. He was Void Land’s Lord, after all, so it was a big loss to his face to be seen by the many disciples walking past this scene.

“This Queen will do whatever she wants! If you have the ability, then fight back!” Zhu Jiu Yin’s voice rang out in Yang Kai’s ears.

Yang Kai was indignant, “Senior is a venerable Divine Spirit, this Junior knows he is not Senior’s opponent; however, this Junior has shown great respect to Senior, and the daily offerings have also never been lacking! If there is anything that this Junior has done wrong, Senior can just inform me of it. Why raise your hand against me directly?”

“You wish to reason with this Queen? Fine, this Queen will reason with you!” Zhu Jiu Yin coldly snorted, “Let me ask you. Are you enjoying yourself as Yin-Yang Cave Heaven’s son-in-law?”

Yang Kai’s momentum withered instantly, and his brow twitched, “Senior found out?”

He cursed in his heart, wondering which bastard spread the word around. Zhu Jiu Yin lived deep within Heavenly Moon Palace and essentially never left, so who could have told her about it? But after some careful thought, Zhu Jiu Yin was still a Divine Spirit, so if she wished to seek out information, then nobody in Void Land could hide anything from her.

“What are you feeling guilty for?” Zhu Jiu Yin snickered.

Yang Kai cupped his fist and cleared his throat, “Senior must be joking, there really is a misunderstanding behind this matter. It was not this Junior’s intention!”

“I don’t care whether it was your intention or not, it happened and that’s a fact!”

Yang Kai blinked, “But, what does this have to do with Senior?”

Zhu Jiu Yin coldly snorted, “Luo’er is so devoted to you, and yet now that she’s in retreat to cultivate in seclusion, you’re out picking flowers and trampling the grass. It is difficult for her to do anything about it, but as her Honoured Master, what problem is there for me to teach you a lesson in her place?”

Yang Kai was speechless. If Luo’er found out about his most recent escapade, the most likely course of action she would take would be to find a way to drain him dry, in various ways. There was no way she would casually raise her hand at him like this insane woman.

As such, Yang Kai brushed her off surreptitiously, “Senior is mighty, whatever Senior says is right; however, there is another matter which this Junior requires Senior’s help with right now.”

Zhu Jiu Yin did not even wait to hear what it was before stopping him, “Don’t even think about it, you brat! This is a problem that you brought upon yourself, so you deal with it yourself; otherwise… If Luo’er were to find out that I, as her Honoured Master, stepped out to do your dirty work for you for the problems that you yourself caused, then would she not blame me for it?”

“Don’t be like that, Senior. Zuo Quan Hui is a Seventh-Order Master. Other than you, no one in my Void Land can best him. This time, we were fortunate enough to be able to force him back, but what about next time?”

“I’ll teach you a method!” Zhu Jiu Yin declared.

Raising his brows, Yang Kai said respectfully, “Please teach me, Senior!”

“Next time you meet Zuo Quan Hui, wash your neck and stick it out… then let him cut your head off!”

Yang Kai’s face darkened in an instant. He was naive to even have hoped to gain Zhu Jiu Yin’s help…

“If you die, then Luo’er will not be tied down by you anymore. Where else can she not go in this vast world with this Queen bringing her along? It would be much better than following a fickle man like you, only to be abandoned sooner or later.”

Yang Kai turned with a flick of his sleeve, “Good, if you won’t help, then so be it! Why slander others in such a malicious manner? Why purposefully be so infuriating!? If I had known that it would be so, then I would never have brought you out of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary and would have let you stay there until you died of old age!”

There was a bang, and the tightly shut doors of Heavenly Moon Palace flung open as Zhu Jiu Yin appeared and beckoned, “Here, come inside! Let me show you something nice!”

Space Principles surged and Yang Kai hurriedly fled.

Three days later, Void Land’s Main Conference Hall.

Yang Kai sat in the head seat, with many Sixth-Order and Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters sitting below. The group of people glanced up at Yang Kai from time to time. Old Bai, Chef, and the others were all trying their best to stifle their laughter, but their shoulders were still shaking uncontrollably.

Yue He, on the other hand, had a heartbroken expression.

Yang Kai glanced around at the crowd and said in a tone that was half exhausted, half aggrieved, “If you want to laugh, then go ahead and laugh, why hold it in? Don’t choke yourselves.”

Old Bai and the others finally could no longer hold back and broke out laughing.

Hui Gu said with concern, “Sir, have your injuries not healed? Zuo Quan Hui’s methods are truly despicable. How could…” Before he could finish his sentence, Zhou Ya next to him tugged on his sleeve.

Hui Gu was puzzled. He had been focusing on healing these past few days and had no idea what happened outside. He just knew that Yang Kai came out today and was now sitting with two big, black eyes, making him look both miserable and a little bit funny.

Yang Kai cleared his throat helplessly, “Are you done laughing yet? Let’s get to business!”

Meanwhile, he cursed in his heart. It wasn’t enough that that damned Zhu Jiu Yin kicked and punched him that day, but she even went so far as to use her Source Strength to punch his eyes, leaving black bruises that even a few days later refused to disappear. He had no idea how long it would even take for him to recover.

After hiding for a few days, trying to resolve the situation, Yang Kai realized this wasn’t a problem he could solve in short order, so he decided to just let things be and came out to meet everyone in this state.

Seeing that Yang Kai was starting to get angry out of shame, Old Bai and the others finally restrained their laughter and sat upright.

“Are your injuries healed?” Yang Kai asked.

Hua Yong rose, “Many thanks for Sir’s concern. Our injuries were not severe, so we are all fine after recuperating for a few days.”

Yang Kai nodded, “You should still pay attention to the Madame’s health; after all, she has borne a child just recently. Go and see Second Manager when you return later and get some nutritional tonics to help aid in her recuperation.”

...

After many years of gestation, Shu Mu Dan was finally able to give birth to a son just half a year ago. Yang Kai had also gone to visit him, and the child was indeed born with great talent and exceptional aptitude. Shu Mu Dan was in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm after all, so the child she had been carrying for many years was not one that ordinary people could compare with.

“Many thanks, Sir!” Hua Yong hurriedly responded.

Yang Kai nodded and went on, “Guo Zi Yan has brought news that someone has spotted five people leaving Void Territory, each one with powerful cultivation. There were four men and one woman, so it had to be Zuo Quan Hui and his group.”

Everyone breathed sighs of relief. Even though there was no way that Zuo Quan Hui would linger in Void Territory for long after eating such a heavy loss, it was hard for anyone to say what he would do for sure. It was only now that they finally had a solid confirmation.

If a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master like Zuo Quan Hui truly did stay in Void Territory and continued committing atrocities throughout the land, then Void Territory would have no good way of dealing with him. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“There is the matter of Three Brilliances World next. Second Manager, what is the situation there right now?” Yang Kai turned to Bian Yu Qing.

Bian Yu Qing responded, “Three Brilliances World has suffered a lot of damage. It is, after all, only a Universe World. With the wanton destruction of a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, nearly 20% of the landscape was destroyed, which has caused unrest across the entire Three Brilliances World. Many have died in the disaster. I have already dispatched people to Three Brilliances World to assist World Lord Peng in accommodating the refugees and calming the masses; however, this matter will not be resolved in a short time. If Three Brilliances World wants to restore its strength and vitality, then it would take at least hundreds or even thousands of years. As for the damaged landmass, there is a good chance it will never return to normal.”

Yang Kai said, “Whether the land can be restored or not is a secondary matter. The most important thing is the people. Do your best to fulfill any needs that Three Brilliances World may have.”

“Yes!” After a moment’s hesitation, Bian Yu Qing added, “Sect Master, we should take what happened at Three Brilliances World as a precaution. Should we send people to guard the other Universe Worlds, too?”

Yang Kai shook his head slowly, “There are more than a dozen Universe Worlds in Void Territory. It would take too much manpower to guard them all. Moreover, who can we even send to guard them in our current situation? Zuo Quan Hui’s strength is in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, it would be difficult for anyone present to put up a struggle against him, so it’s useless to go. What’s more… Zuo Quan Hui is still from Thousand Cranes Paradise. He has his own scruples about committing such treachery in Universe Worlds. Otherwise, he would not have used Huang Quan’s hand to wreak havoc on Three Brilliances World in his place. Huang Quan’s reputation is already nefarious, and it’s not as if he hasn’t done similar things before, so it wouldn’t hurt him to do it again. Comparatively speaking, Zuo Quan Hui more or less cares about his own reputation still. For that reason, I think it’s unlikely that he will use a similar method again!”

Everyone nodded lightly at his words as Yue He commented, “If he really did do so, then Thousand Cranes Paradise will definitely suffer criticism and be forced to intervene. Even though rumours say that he and his lineage have all defected from Thousand Cranes Paradise, anyone who is not a fool will know that this is merely a cover. His actions were more or less still tied to Thousand Cranes Paradise’s face, and something as low as raising one’s hand against mortals is something they cannot afford to accept.”
