Just as Yang Kai was feeling deep regret over this Heaven Devouring Battle Law, he had a sudden flash of inspiration and an exciting thought came to him.

The Heaven Devouring Battle Law was able to swallow anything with energy in it and refine it for one’s own use.

The Stone Puppet Clan’s innate Divine Ability allowed its clansmen to devour and refine various ores, remove the waste, and use the essence to strengthen themselves.

The two were surprisingly similar...

Moreover, Stone Puppets had incredibly intrepid physiques which in terms of adaptability and endurance were all but peerless! For instance, Xiao Xiao was even able to swallow and refine the Sun’s True Essence.

What would happen if a Stone Puppet were to cultivate the Heaven Devouring Battle Law?

Generally speaking, the Stone Puppet clan could not cultivate any Secret Arts because, although they were innately powerful, their sentience was too low, and they couldn’t comprehend the mysteries of a Secret Art, let alone cultivate one.

The Heavens were fair in all things, giving the Stone Puppet Clan powerful physical bodies and great destructive power, but lowering their sentience proportionally.

If the Stone Puppet Clan were also highly intelligent, surely they would be a race comparable to the Ancient Divine Spirits, an extremely terrifying thought.

But... Yang Kai had his Embodiment!

The Embodiment was originally transformed from the Golden Stone Puppet and had already integrated the entire floating continent. It was the physical host of Yang Kai’s Soul Clone, equivalent to Yang Kai’s second body!

The Stone Puppet Clan could not cultivate Secret Arts, but that did not mean Yang Kai’s Embodiment couldn’t. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Thinking about it, Yang Kai’s blood began to boil as he suddenly discovered that, with regards to the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, his Embodiment had a unique advantage and ability to cultivate it.

Hurriedly pushing his Divine Sense, Yang Kai took back his Soul Clone which was currently residing in his Embodiment and poured the Heaven Devouring Battle Law and all his current insights into it.

His Soul Clone flew out once again and poured into the mountain-like Embodiment.

Immediately afterwards, the Embodiment assumed a solemn posture and began to cultivate the Heaven Devouring Battle Law with a serious look on its face.

Initially, there were no changes, but as time passed, a cracking sound rang out from the Embodiment’s massive body, causing Yang Kai to be slightly surprised. He thought something had gone wrong, but after carefully perceiving the situation of his Soul Clone, he discovered that this was not the case.

The cracking sounds continued and grew louder until a large swath of rocks fell from his Embodiment at a certain point. When these rocks hit the ground, they instantly turned to dust and scattered about.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up and he could not help grinning.

The Heaven Devouring Battle Law was truly extraordinary, and this supreme Secret Art seemed tailor-made for the Stone Puppet Clan!

What had fallen from his Embodiment just now were impurities and waste that served no purpose. The Embodiment had originally integrated the entire floating continent, and it had been using the innate Divine Ability of the Stone Puppet Clan to refine its mass over the past few years. Unfortunately, the progress was extremely slow, leaving it with a massive body that was quite inconvenient to move around.

Yang Kai had engaged in many battles since he obtained the Embodiment but rarely brought it out to help him for precisely this reason.

Its body was simply too big, and trying to bring it out of the Sealed World Bead required a massive amount of his Spiritual Energy, so how could Yang Kai be willing to do so unless it was his last resort?

According to the previous rate of progress, Yang Kai had estimated it would be at least ten or twenty years before the Embodiment gradually shrunk to only a hundred meters or so in height. Only then could it be used at will.

But by that time, Yang Kai’s strength would certainly be far greater than the Embodiment’s strength now, so how much help could his Embodiment, which was currently comparable to a Third-Order Origin King, provide?

In fact, Yang Kai had been having a headache about what to do with his Embodiment, but since he had no good solutions to the problem, he could only put off dealing with it.

But now, with the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, it seemed all his problems were solved.

The Heaven Devouring Battle Law, combined with the innate Divine Ability of the Stone Puppet Clan, allowed his Embodiment to refine the remaining impurities in its body at a much more rapid pace. Countless discarded impurities fell from the Embodiment, leaving behind only the pure essence. It was as if the Embodiment was shedding its skin and being reborn.

Perhaps it would not be long before his Embodiment could become another big helper to him.

But that was not the end of it!

What excited Yang Kai the most was that, now that his Embodiment had a compatible Secret Art, it could cultivate and become stronger. The Stone Puppet Clan could not cultivate and could only improve its strength by devouring rare ores.

Xiao Xiao had grown up in this manner.

Now though, Yang Kai’s Embodiment not only had the innate Divine Ability of the Stone Puppet Clan, but it also had the assistance of the Heaven Devouring Battle Law. With these two factors combined, as long as Yang Kai could supply it with enough materials, his Embodiment would be able to rapidly improve its strength in a very short time.

*Xixilili...*

Where the Embodiment sat, it was like a meteor shower, with countless bits of impurities falling off it, quickly creating a thick layer of dust around it.

With his Soul Clone presiding over his Embodiment’s cultivation, Yang Kai did not need to pay it any attention at all.

And so, Yang Kai quickly set about cultivating, focusing on transforming his Saint Qi into Source Qi.

He had used up all the starlight in his body, so if he wanted to promote the conversion speed of his Saint Qi, Yang Kai could only use Source Condensing Pills.

Although the effect was slower than using the starlight, the Source Condensing Pills refined by Yang Kai were of excellent quality, so the results were still quite good. What’s more, he consumed Source Condensing Pills far faster than normal Origin Kings for some reason.

An ordinary Third-Order Origin King would need about three days to refine the medicinal efficacies in a Source Condensing Pill.

But Yang Kai was able to do this in just one day.

After some thought, Yang Kai figured that it was because he was a Star Master. Star Masters were able to absorb starlight from the Starlight Corridor, and convert their Saint Qi into Source Qi far faster than ordinary Origin Kings, so Yang Kai assumed the same was true for Source Condensing Pills.

However, this was not a bad thing. Right now, he did not need to worry about Source Condensing Pills and could simply refine more if he ran out. His priority was to fully transform his Saint Qi as soon as possible, improving his combat effectiveness and bringing him one step closer to breaking through to the Dao Source Realm.

Time flew by and soon, seven days had passed.

Yang Kai left the Sealed World Bead.

After scanning around with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai immediately noticed that someone had entered the detection array around his secluded home. When he went to check who it was, Yang Kai could not help raising his brow. Taking out his Identity Token, he deactivated all the Isolation Arrays and barriers.

Outside his secluded home, a man dressed as a shop-hand was standing there with an anxious look on his face, holding a communication artifact in his hand, seemingly sending constant messages with someone else. Suddenly, Yang Kai’s voice rang out, “Come in.”

The shop hand was stunned for a moment but immediately flashed an overjoyed smile as he hurriedly opened the door and entered.

“Greetings, Alchemist Yang!” The shop-hand hurriedly saluted.

“En, Shopkeeper Kang asked you to come see me? Is something wrong?” Yang Kai asked lightly.

This shop-hand was an employee at Spirit Pill Plaza, so Yang Kai naturally recognized him.

“Yes, Shopkeeper said that he would like to request Alchemist Yang’s presence at the pill shop in order to discuss a certain matter.”

“Shopkeeper Kang is already back?”

Kang Si Ran had been invited by the City Lord’s Mansion on its investigation of Clear Jade Mountain where the Luan Feng had appeared. Yang Kai knew about this, but with the World Extinguishing Black Flames still covering that region, there really wasn’t anything to be discovered other than ashes.

Calculating the time, it actually made sense that the investigation team had returned.

“Shopkeeper returned yesterday and immediately tried to contact Alchemist Yang but was unable to reach your esteemed self. Please accompany this humble one back to the pill shop to speak with Shopkeeper. Shopkeeper has urged this humble one several times already, so the matter is certainly important.” The shop hand smiled and said in an accommodating manner.

“Sure,” Yang Kai nodded.

Although he did not know why Kang Si Ran was so eager to find him, he knew something big must have happened. Otherwise, Kang Si Ran would not have had a shop-hand camp out outside his secluded home.

With no need to pack or arrange anything, Yang Kai immediately left the secluded home and rushed over to Spirit Pill Plaza with the shop-hand.

Not long after entering the pill shop, Kang Si Ran immediately pulled Yang Kai into a back room.

Seeing him put such an emphasis on secrecy, Yang Kai could not help asking, “Has something happened, Shopkeeper Kang?”

Kang Si Ran chuckled and replied, “Alchemist Yang, something good has happened.”

“And what is this good thing?”

“Sir Star Envoy has delivered us an opportunity!”

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai frowned as Kang Si Ran was still being vague in his explanation.

“The situation is this,” Kang Si Ran poured a cup of tea for Yang Kai as he explained, “In three days, Sir Star Envoy will open the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda here in Maplewood City!”

“Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda?” Yang Kai was now even more confused, “What is that?”

Kang Si Ran’s jaw dropped slightly, seemingly quite surprised that Yang Kai hadn’t even heard of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, but when he remembered Yang Kai’s completely ignorant performance from before, he quickly adapted and explained, “It is this Kang’s fault for not being clear, please don’t take offence, Alchemist Yang.”

Yang Kai’s expression was a bit embarrassed as he knew Kang Si Ran was just trying to give him face, but he quickly composed himself and listened attentively.

“The Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda is an Emperor Artifact!”

“An Emperor Artifact?” Yang Kai’s interest was piqued.

“Indeed, and a very high-level existence among Emperor Artifacts at that!” Kang Si Ran smiled slightly, seemingly satisfied with Yang Kai’s look, “What’s more... The Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda is a very special type of Emperor Artifact. It does not have any offensive or defensive ability at all.”

“No offensive or defensive ability? Then what is it for? Is it used for cultivation?” Although Yang Kai was ignorant and uninformed about the goings-on of the Star Boundary, he still had common sense. The most common functions of artifacts were to attack or defend, but since this Emperor Artifact was not used for either of those, its only use could be for cultivation.

“In a certain sense,” Kang Si Ran chuckled and said. “The Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda is used to provide life experience, a training ground exclusively for Star Soul Palace’s disciples.”

“So what Shopkeeper Kang means is... This Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda is a Small Sealed World?” Yang Kai immediately thought of a possibility.

Kang Si Ran looked at Yang Kai in surprise and said with obvious admiration, “Alchemist Yang is truly sharp. En, the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda is indeed a self-contained world, a very profound and mysterious one at that.”
