“Sir, it’s Sir Niu’s men!” A Monster Race member suddenly approached Yang You Wei and shouted.

Yang You Wei’s countenance changed after hearing this and quickly rose into the air to get a better look. After seeing the appearance of a behemoth figure approaching, he couldn’t help but shout, “Niu Quan!”

He had mentioned Niu Quan before, and although Yang Kai didn’t get into the details, he knew that Niu Quan was a Monster General, someone on the same level of strength and status as Yang You Wei, but he didn’t expect to meet him here today.

Yang Kai was considering whether he should ask Yang You Wei to cooperate with him to silence the witness, so as to prevent other irrelevant Monster Race members from knowing about Yang You Wei cooperating with him, which might lead to some accident. But he hadn’t expected Yang You Wei to actually fly straight ahead and shout loudly, hovering in the air, “Old Niu, what are you doing?”

He didn’t get any response.

Yang You Wei’s face changed again as he anxiously asked, “Old Niu, it’s Old Yang, wake up and look at me!”

The Monster Race members who were flying along with Niu Quan recognized Yang You Wei. Some of the Monster Race members broke down in tears as they requested, “Sir Yang, please do something and save our Sir. We don’t know what happened with Sir today, he suddenly revealed his true form and started running straight in this direction. We couldn’t stop him. He is also not responding to our shouts!”

Hearing this, Yang You Wei’s conjecture was immediately confirmed. He glanced at the place where the invisible tomb entrance was as a trace of sadness appeared on his face. He heaved a heavy sigh before waving his hand and flying back to Yang Kai’s side.

*Hong long long…*

The towering trees snapped as the behemoth figure finally rushed out of the woods. Yang Kai focused his gaze and found an enormous ox-shaped Monster Beast suddenly entering his vision. Its entire body was glowing green and its skin was filled with deep cracks. The criss-cross patterns were obviously the marks left by the passage of time. Each of its hooves were the size of a house and every time they fell, the ground and mountains quaked.

There were two sickle-like curved horns on either side of the Monster Beast’s head, but one of them was cut off; who knows by what or whom, but the broken horn did not make this ox look weaker, instead just giving him a ferocious air.

[This should be the Monster General named Niu Quan!] Yang Kai made an educated guess in his heart, but he couldn’t come up with the reason why this Monster General would show his real body here. Although the strength of a Monster Race member would increase after they took on their real form, that form wasn’t ever as agile or flexible as a human form, so most Monster Race Masters would not reveal their original forms unless it was a last resort.

“What happened?” Yang Kai looked at Yang You Wei.

“His pre-destined time has come. He is about to enter the tomb.” Yang You Wei suddenly heaved a sigh, his tone carrying a bit of sadness. He had known that Niu Quan would not live for much longer, but he hadn’t expected this day to come so suddenly.

Yang Kai looked at Niu Quan and then he looked in the supposed direction of the tomb entrance that the Monster Race members had pointed out before. Then he suddenly came to realize, “Can he feel the call of the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb?”

Yang You Wei agreed with a nod, “All inhabitants of the Ancient Lands can feel the location of the Ten Thousand Spirits Tombs when their time of death arrives and will involuntarily try to enter it. Old Niu… Haaa…” He heaved a heavy sigh and was unable to speak any further.

“I see…” Yang Kai raised his brow.

He didn’t have any friendship with Niu Quan and he wasn’t sure about whether the Ten Thousand Spirits Tombs was real or not, but now, there was actually a way to verify everything, so Yang Kai didn’t hold any sadness. On the contrary, he was watching the situation with interest, thinking these next few moments would broaden his horizons.

Niu Quan’s subordinates were still calling out to him; however, after assuming his real form, it seemed that he couldn’t hear anything anymore and only knew how to charge towards the location of the tomb entrance, step by step.

After a while, all the Monster Race members following Niu Quan came to know about the truth of the matter from Yang You Wei’s subordinates. After they came to know that their Sir was about to enter the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb, they were extremely saddened and started weeping loudly.

In front of everyone’s eyes, Niu Quan walked into the mountain valley and suddenly stopped. He raised his head and mooed loudly before plunging forward.

Yang Kai’s eyes widened in an instant.

Because a dark grey gate of light suddenly appeared out of thin air. This gate of light was tens of meters tall and had been invisible before now. Had Niu Quan’s entrance not caused a ripple, others might not have been able to see it.

As Yang You Wei had said before, only the residents of the Ancient Lands, who were close to their pre-destined time of death, could see the tomb entrance.

Niu Quan passed through the entrance, creating ripples as he did so, and his enormous body quickly disappeared. At the same time, the tomb entrance concealed itself again.

The Monster Race members, who had followed Niu Quan here, cried and wailed.

Yang You Wei also sighed as an unpleasant look appeared on his face.

“There really is a tomb entrance!” After witnessing it with his own eyes, Yang Kai knew that Yang You Wei and the others weren’t trying to deceive him. It also confirmed that the Third Disciple had really entered the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb.

[What should I do now?] Yang Kai was having a terrible headache. He didn’t know what dangers were inside this strange tomb, or if he could leave if he entered it. If the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb was really a place where one could only go in, but could never come out, wouldn’t it mean that he would be seeking his own death if he charged in recklessly? Although he was proficient in the Dao of Space, he dared not act rashly.

But Ruo Xi could actually see the tomb entrance, which made things all the stranger here.

Considering all this, Yang Kai turned his head and looked at Zhang Ruo Xi, receiving a great shock as he did because Zhang Ruo Xi had arrived at the front of the tomb entrance at some point. She had her hand stretched out, reaching it towards the invisible entrance, her pair of pretty eyes flickering with a strange glow as she stared blankly forward.

“Ruo Xi, what are you doing!?” Yang Kai shouted aloud. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Zhang Ruo Xi’s tender body trembled and she suddenly regained her senses. When she realized that she had unknowingly come to the tomb entrance, her beautiful face turned pale and she immediately tried to withdraw.

But right then, the hidden tomb entrance manifested again and this time, it revealed itself in its entirety.

In the vast mountain valley, an enormous dark-grey door of light flashed a gloomy light that bathed the surrounding space in dark light.

All the Monster Race members illuminated by this light were horrified as they found themselves suddenly unable to move. A terrified look appeared on everyone’s face as they shouted and clamoured madly.

Yang Kai’s eyes also bulged to the point that they were almost ready to pop out. Illuminated by that dark-grey light, he couldn’t take even a step at all, and no matter how much he prompted the Space Principles, he was unable to teleport away.

All the surviving humans and Monster Race in the mountain valley seemed to have a petrification technique cast upon them.

“Sir, I…” Zhang Ruo Xi was on the verge of crying. She too had no idea what she was doing, and when she took a sidelong glance at Yang Kai, she found that even Yang Kai was struggling to save himself and couldn’t protect her. Her heart immediately sank.

This happened so quickly that no one could react.

Yang Kai struggled for a while, but upon determining he couldn’t free himself at all, he grit his teeth and tried to summon the Mountains and Rivers Bell, but right then, the tomb entrance flashed once more and hid itself again.

And along with its disappearance, all the living creatures inside the mountain valley had disappeared as well.

In an ashen-grey world with no Sun, Moon, or Stars, no flowers or trees, there was only deathly silence, just like a cemetery…

Yang Kai and Zhang Ruo Xi appeared together with Monster Race members and the mysterious power binding them suddenly disappeared.

Yang Kai teleported to Zhang Ruo Xi’s side the next instant, pushing his Emperor Qi to envelop her while vigilantly looking around.

But what he saw next put him in a daze.

Everyone seemed to be standing on a bone mountain. There were only white bones as far as they could see; skeletons of all shapes and sizes were scattered on the ground. The small ones were almost of negligible size, but the big ones were utterly enormous. The true body of Niu Quan was simply not worth mentioning next to some of these giants.

These white bones were left by the Monster Beasts that had died here over the many years.

“Moo…”

A beast’s roar resounded from nearby, and as Yang Kai turned to look, his pupils immediately shrank and he shouted, “Niu Quan!”

Niu Quan, whom he had seen in the mountain valley before, was also here, but at this moment, thick Death Qi lingered around him. He was lying quietly on a part of bone mountain, motionless. He had reached the end of his lifespan and appeared to be waiting for his death.

Glowing specks of light were flying out from his body, like dancing sprites, adding a touch of life to this dark-grey monotonous world. The specks of light seemed to be drawn by something as they flew towards the depths of this place.

And with the disappearance of the specks of light, Niu Quan’s vitality was also declining.

“So, this is the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb!” Yang Kai’s face turned darker.

If he had made some guesses before, then after seeing Niu Quan, he already had a clear idea what kind of place it was.

Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb!

It was the tomb for the entire Ancient Lands, a place where one could only go in but could never come out. Even the strongest Monster King could forget about leaving after entering this place.

[How did I enter this damned place?] Before, Yang Kai was still hesitating whether to come in and explore to find traces of the Third Disciple, but now, since he had come in, albeit not by his own choice, he basically didn’t have the chance to hesitate anymore.

“I’m sorry, Sir. I also don’t know what happened to me just now!” Zhang Ruo Xi was about to cry. She also knew that she had made a big mistake, but it was indeed involuntary; her body simply wasn’t under her control at that moment.

After entering the Ancient Wild Lands, she found that there was something wrong with her, but she had never expected to charge into a disaster like this.

Yang Kai glanced at her and patted her head, not saying anything.

It was too late to say anything anyway, and now that they were forced in, what would be the point of scolding Zhang Ruo Xi? It didn’t go unnoticed by Yang Kai that Zhang Ruo Xi’s actions were unintentional. The most important thing now was to leave this damned place.

He turned his head to look for Yang You Wei.

After all, Yang You Wei was a member of Monster Race, born and bred in this land, so his understanding of the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb should naturally be better than Yang Kai’s. If there was a way out, he must know about it.

But after a glance, Yang Kai’s face started twitching because he realized that Yang You Wei would not be able to help him at all because, at this moment, Yang You Wei and the crowd of Monster Race were also stupidly standing on their spots, shrouded by a dark-grey aura while specks of light were escaping out of their bodies bit by bit.
