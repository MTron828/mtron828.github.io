Originally, Yin Le Sheng thought that a treacherous person like Yang Kai would definitely not agree to his challenge. At that time, he could only severely humiliate Yang Kai, and speak all kinds of slander, but contrary to his expectation, Yang Kai had actually accepted!

He was ecstatic.

He might not be confident about being Yang Kai’s opponent head-on, but he had an ace up his sleeve, and once he resorted to it, Yang Kai would definitely die.

Yin Le Sheng secretly decided in his mind that as soon as the fight with Yang Kai began, he would directly use his trump card, not giving Yang Kai any chance to resist.

Just as his imagination was running wild, Yang Kai suddenly pointed at the several dozen cultivators beside him and stated, “Since Brother Yin likes to fight solo, then you can fight with these friends. I believe they will definitely accompany you. Have fun!”

Yin Le Sheng was dumbstruck after hearing this.

The several dozen cultivators were also taken aback.

Lan He too was similarly rooted on her spot, in a daze.

Zhang Hao’s face turned cold as he grimly rebuked, “Yang Kai, don’t go too far! We have handed you our Space Rings, what else do you want?”

“That’s right! You should resolve your grievance with Yin Le Sheng yourself, why drag us into your fight?” Zhang Xian too shouted before stating in a firm voice, “We will never help you.”

“Yeah, yeah, don’t treat us as fools!”

The group of cultivators immediately started clamouring, criticizing Yang Kai.

Yin Le Sheng sneered, “Brother Yang, if you don’t have the guts to fight me, no one will laugh at you, why bother beating around the bush?”

Yang Kai meaningfully grinned and justified himself, “Brother Yin is the Legacy Disciple of the Eastern Territory’s Netherworld Sect’s Sect Master, whereas I, Yang Kai, am a lone man with no support. Of course I don’t have the guts to fight with you. If I accidentally killed you, wouldn’t I be inviting a disaster?”

“If you don’t have the guts to fight with Yin Le Sheng, why should we? We won’t!”

“That’s right, we won’t! If you want to beat him, do it yourself!”

“You are really treating us like idiots. This brat is simply insatiable! How ridiculous!”

Everyone was extremely dissatisfied with Yang Kai because they were forced to hand over their Space Rings, and now, this brat actually wanted to make them deal with Yin Le Sheng as well! Why should they? Each and every one of them started shouting in indignation.

Lan He looked worriedly at Yang Kai, afraid that he would make things go out of hand. He was already threatening everyone with the Mountains and Rivers Bell, and it was nothing short of a miracle that he had obtained so many Space Rings. If he did something even more excessive, it might bring some unnecessary trouble.

She furtively winked at Yang Kai, signalling him to not be too greedy, lest it was too late.

Yang Kai ignored her, unfortunately, and stated with a cold look on his face, “You probably didn’t hear what I said at the beginning, did you?”

“What did you say!?”

“Boy, just speak, what do you want to do!?”

Yang Kai stated with a snort, “This Young Master said that whoever dares to not hand over their Space Rings, this Young Master will make him die!”

“Yes, you did say that! But I’ve already handed over my Space Ring, what do you want now?”

Yang Kai said, “Now Yin Le Sheng is unwilling to cooperate, so this Young Master wants him dead, do you have any objections?”

Zhang Hao answered, “Of course not! You and Brother Yin can resolve your grievances by yourselves, without involving us.”

“Good!” Yang Kai grinned before shouting, “This Young Master will now use this Mountains and Rivers Bell to beat this bastard Yin Le Sheng to death! If you still want to survive, quickly leave this place. This Young Master will not stop you!”

“What!?”

“Again!?”

“No, Brother Yang, calm down!”

Once Yang Kai said this, everyone turned pale in shock.

Yang Kai sneered and stated, “Since you have handed your Space Rings over, this Young Master means what he says and will spare your lives. Now, this Young Master only wants to deal with Yin Le Sheng. If you don’t want to die, quickly leave!”

Zhang Hao angrily shouted, “The Natural Array here is too complex! If we could leave, how could we be threatened by you? Yang Kai, aren’t you talking nonsense!?”

Zhang Xian also shouted, “You should exercise moderation. You can’t be shameless to this level!”

Yang Kai remained unaffected by all this and calmly stated, “None of my business! If you don’t have the ability to leave, if you are shaken to death by the Mountains and Rivers Bell, then you can only blame your bad luck, it has nothing to do with this Young Master!” He then switched the topic and angrily shouted at Yin Le Sheng, “Surnamed Yin, next year today will be the anniversary of your death. You can be on your way to Hell!”

While speaking, he swung the Myriads Sword fiercely toward the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

Lan He’s eyes widened in shock as she hastily circulated her Source Qi to defend herself.

The crowd of cultivators also panicked and hurriedly shouted, one after another.

“Stop, stop!”

“Damn it! Quickly stop! We can talk it out! At worst, we will help you persuade Yin Le Sheng!”

“Yes, yes, we can talk with Yin Le Sheng and ask him to hand over his Space Ring!”

In this havoc, Yang Kai’s Myriads Sword stopped less than a finger’s width away from the Mountains and Rivers Bell before he looked at the crowd and asked, “You are going to talk with Yin Le Sheng?”

Everyone was drenched in cold sweat as they repeatedly nodded after hearing this.

Yang Kai looked embarrassed as he stated, “This surnamed Yin is very arrogant, he won’t give in easily. If you just talk it out… I’m afraid it will be useless!”

“Brother Yang may rest assured, if Brother Yin remains untactful, we will use harder methods to speak with him,” Someone stated with a ferocious look on his face.

Yang Kai stated, “Hmm, no! You have already handed your Space Rings over, logically speaking, the next thing has nothing to do with you. How can I drag you all into my grievance with Yin Le Sheng?”

Everyone’s face turned black as if they stared at this hypocritical act. They were all cursing Yang Kai their hearts furiously, but no one dared to speak their thoughts aloud.

“Brother Yang, don’t mind it! Brother Yin is the one being untactful, so he should be taught a lesson. Only when the youngsters encounter some hardships will they understand how high the Heavens are and how deep the Earth goes!”

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up after hearing this as he said, “If you insist, this Yang will have to trouble you all regarding this matter. Just know, I didn’t force you.”

“Hehe, we are doing this voluntarily.”

Having finished speaking, the several dozen cultivators turned their heads and glared at Yin Le Sheng.

Yin Le Sheng’s face turned black like the bottom of a pot while the two Netherworld Sect disciples next to him had also turned pale and become dumbstruck.

Somehow, he and his team were now standing on the opposite side of everyone. They were simply caught unprepared.

“Yin Le Sheng, be tactful and quickly hand over your Space Ring, otherwise everyone will die here!”

“Yes, if you don’t cooperate, then don’t blame us for being impolite.”

“Hand it over now!”

Everyone seemed to have been implicated because of Yin Le Sheng’s lack of cooperation, or perhaps because they were unlucky and they wanted others to be part of their misfortune too. Therefore, their attitude towards Yin Le Sheng was far from good.

Yin Le Sheng was burning with fury and he asked with a sullen face, “You are the elite disciples of top Sects, the pride of your various forces, yet you’ve given up all your self-respect and allowed yourselves to be driven by one person’s threats? Aren’t you afraid that you will become a laughing-stock if the word gets out?”

Many people’s faces darkened after hearing this, looking embarrassed.

Yang Kai smiled and stated, “Yin Le Sheng is asking you to silence the witnesses so that no one will tell anyone about today’s matter.”

Everyone’s eyes lit up after hearing this. They secretly felt that it was a good idea. A fierce gleam even flashed past in a few people’s eyes.

Yin Le Sheng’s face darkened as he lashed out, “Yang Kai, you are such a despicable person. This Yin really misunderstood you.”

Yang Kai rebuked with a snort, “Back then, when you intercepted and tried to kill me in the Starlight Corridor, you should have thought of the consequences!”

Yin Le Sheng, gritting his teeth, warned, “Don’t force me. If I am backed into a corner, you won’t have a good end.”

Yang Kai jumped back and said, staring at him with widened eyes, “Aiya, I’m so sacred!” He then turned his head and said, looking at the several dozen cultivators, “This guy dares to threaten you, I don’t know whether you can stand it or not, but anyway, I can’t stand it. If I were you, I would rush to him and tear him to pieces!”

Even though they knew Yang Kai was adding fuel to the fire and driving a wedge, everyone was still a little unhappy with Yin Le Sheng’s words as they were simply too much.

Zhang Hao pondered for a while and stated, “Brother Yin, a wise man, submits to the circumstances. I know you have the means and the cards, but do you really think you can be an enemy of so many of us?”

“Zhang Hao, you are forcing me too?!” Yin Le Sheng’s eyes were shooting flames of fury and his voice was cold as ice.

Both of them were disciples of Sects of the Eastern Territory and had known each other for a long time. There might not be a friendship between them, but they all belonged to the Eastern Territory. It was fine for the others to compel him, but the fact that Zhang Hao too was acting so made Yin Le Sheng extremely angry.

Zhang Hao stated in a heavy voice, “Brother Yin, it’s not too late for a gentleman to take his revenge within ten years. This is the Shattered Star Sea, there will be plenty of opportunities.”

He didn’t transmit his voice but said it in an open and aboveboard manner in front of Yang Kai. Apparently, he too was holding a grudge, and wanted to find a chance to take revenge.

Yang Kai disdainfully spat, looking completely indifferent to this.

Yin Le Sheng, maintaining a straight face, pondered for a while before agreeing with a nod, “Alright, this Yin will remember this. Yang Kai, I will make you pay for it a hundred times over in the future!”

Yang Kai chuckled and stated, “Brother Yin, you’re a fish on a chopping board, and I am the knife, is it okay to say such inflammatory words?”

Yin Le Sheng glared at Yang Kai without speaking another word.

Yang Kai snorted and requested, “Sister Lan He, collect their Space Rings.”

Lan He nodded before walking up to Yin Le Sheng and stretching her hand out.

Yin Le Sheng warned, “Heavenly Wolf Valley, this Yin will remember you and will definitely visit you in the future!”

Lan He’s face slightly changed; however, at this moment she knew that anything she said would be useless, so she simply took the Space Rings of the three Netherworld Sect disciples, turned around, and left.

After a while, she came to Yang Kai and said, “There are a total of forty-six Space Rings here, Brother Yang, you can count them.”

Yang Kai cheerfully took it and offered, “Sister Lan He, you should also pick one.”

Lan He refused, shaking her head, “I don’t need it. I didn’t do anything!”

Just as Yang Kai was about to say something, his face suddenly changed as fierce Source Qi fluctuations spread from him.

Lan He was also shocked, having no idea what just happened to Yang Kai, but when she quickly scanned him, she noticed a wisp of black Qi around his wrist. This black Qi looked like a snake and was now travelling up Yang Kai’s arm. Wherever it passed, Yang Kai’s body rotted, revealing his bones, while the places corroded by the black Qi made sizzling noises, causing the listeners’ skin to crawl.

A rancid smell instantly filled the void.

“Asura Earth Demon!” Lan He couldn’t help but cry out in shock.
