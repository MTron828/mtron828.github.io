Gu Hong chased Le Dong Zheng all the way over without rest, and was so tired he was gasping for breath.

He only had a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation, which was vastly inferior to Le Dong Zheng’s own cultivation, so his speed was naturally worse. If Gu Hong had not known which passage Yang Kai was coming out of, then he likely wouldn’t have known where to find them.

After arriving at the scene, Gu Hong immediately found a bush to hide in and concealed his aura before looking around.

He didn’t hear any fighting nor feel any energy fluctuations though, so could it be that Le Dong Zheng had already dealt with that little brat?

But that shouldn’t be the case. He was right on their tail, so even if Le Dong Zheng was strong, that boy was still an Emperor Realm Master and should at least be able to hold on for a while.

Unless the battlefield shifted.

Gu Hong felt that the possibility of that was quite high. Perhaps their strength was almost the same with each other and they were still locked in a desperate struggle, but he had no idea where they were fighting now. It would be best if they were both in a lose-lose situation, then he would be able to pick them both off for a tidy profit. If the chance arose, Gu Hong didn’t mind double crossing Le Dong Zheng and tossing him into the same pot as Yang Kai.

While Gu Hong was fantasizing about such possibilities, a faint smell of blood suddenly wafted over in the wind.

When he smelled it, Gu Hong’s face changed.

When he looked over, he could see what seemed to be a man lying a thousand metres away from him, under the moonlight.

“This…” Gu Hong’s expression froze as he focused his sight.

The man lying on the ground had his face slightly tilted to the side, which just happened to be in his direction, allowing him to see his expression clearly.

“Le Dong Zheng!” Gu Hong jumped in fright while at the same time a chill ran down his spine.

Broken Mountain Sect’s Sect Master, who had left Violet Source Chamber of Commerce’s auction house just before him, was currently lying there, motionless and covered in blood. Gu Hong had no idea whether Le Dong Zheng was dead or alive, but there was a big chance that he may be dead, because Gu Hong was unable to detect any vitality from this figure.

The blood in Gu Hong’s body almost froze as he stood stiff for a long time, not daring to move.

Le Dong Zheng was a veteran First-Order Emperor, and there were many rumours that he could break through to the Second-Order at any moment, so how could a Master of this calibre actually fall to such a state? Who had done this?

Even though he was clearly alive and well just a moment ago, intent on seeking revenge on that little brat from Room A3, how did he end up here like a dead fish? DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Gu Hong did not dare to move for a long time, for fear that a strong enemy may be lying in wait nearby. He was worried that he would only lure disaster upon himself if he were to move recklessly.

Only after waiting for a full hour and seeing no changes did Gu Hong find the courage to stand up and approach Le Dong Zheng vigilantly.

In just a moment, he arrived before Le Dong Zheng. Looking at how tragically he died, Gu Hong was astonished.

One move!

Le Dong Zheng had been killed in one move. There was a clear palm print on his chest, which had completely collapsed, and there were still traces of blood around his mouth and nose which had not dried completely. His wide eyes were filled with a look of disbelief, as if he had seen something unbelievable before he died.

*Gudong…*

Gu Hong gulped. For a Master like Le Dong Zheng who was such a towering existence in his eyes to be killed off in one move, how powerful would his killer have to be?

Whether it was that boy from Room A3 who was responsible for his death or not, there could be no doubt he was involved in this matter somehow. There was no way Gu Hong could stay in Maplewood City any longer. If that little brat were to find out that he was the one who revealed his location, then his own fate would not be any better.

Shivering, Gu Hong glanced at Le Dong Zheng’s hand and did not find any trace of his Space Ring. Clearly, it was taken away by the killer.

He didn’t dare to stay any longer, pushing his Source Qi to quickly flee from this place.

The speed of over a hundred people travelling was much slower than Yang Kai had expected, and there was a need to stop regularly. Only after ten days did they barely cover half of the distance.

Fortunately, they didn’t encounter any dangers. If this was any other time, then it would be easy for a group like them to be targeted by some unsavoury cultivators while wandering the Star Boundary, but with Yang Kai watching over them, anyone daring enough to trouble them would just die miserably.

Whether it be the Zhang Family or the Qin Family, they were a little sad to be leaving the place they had been living in for generations so abruptly, and the feeling was only magnified for the older members.

The young people, on the other hand, were filled with curiosity and anticipation about the outside world, especially Zhang Ruo Yu. She would constantly ask Yang Kai questions when there was time. Any strange fact she could learn was enough to keep her amused for a long time.

This girl’s personality was very different from Ruo Xi’s. She was lively and active, as if she had an endless supply of energy. Even her barrage of questions seemed to go on forever.

Yang Kai did not show any impatience with her behaviour though. He had to introduce the Northern Territory and the situation in his own Sect to the two families to begin with, so he would answer any questions Zhang Ruo Yu had for him, gradually filling the hundreds of people with longing for the Northern Territory and High Heaven Palace.

After more than twenty days of walking, the group finally arrived at the former Thousand Leaves Sect.

Bringing the two families into Emperor Heaven Valley, Yang Kai activated the Space Array and divided the group into several batches, teleporting them to High Heaven Palace.

Yang Kai brought up the rear, and as soon as he arrived with the last dozen people in High Heaven Palace, Hua Qing Si immediately came up to greet him, “Palace Master!”

When the first batch of cultivators was teleported over, the two Thousand Leaves Sect disciples who were on guard immediately transmitted a message to Head Manager Hua Qing Si. Hua Qing Si had no idea what was going on either, so she rushed over to investigate.

After some inquiries, she found out that it was Yang Kai who arranged for them to come here, so she naturally did not dare to be rude to them.

Yang Kai nodded and looked at the two families, smiling.

At this moment, each and every one of them had an amazed look on their face, and their eyes were filled with joy and surprise. Zhang Ruo Yu had even opened her arms wide, her face filled with joy as if she wanted to embrace this world.

High Heaven Palace was built on the foundation of the original Seeking Passion Sect, a paradise covered in spiritual mountains and great rivers. The World Energy here was so dense that it was not something that Maplewood City could compare to. All of them felt as if they’d been reborn to suddenly come to such a wonderland. If they were not actively restraining themselves, some of them would even be cheering and crying in happiness at this moment.

“Zhu Qing didn’t come back yet, did she?” Yang Kai asked Hua Qing Si in a quiet voice as he scanned the area warily.

“No,” Hua Qing Si shook her head.

“Good,” Yang Kai let out a sigh of relief even though he knew it was impossible for Zhu Qing to return so quickly. She was going to a famous Forbidden Zone, the Frozen Earth, and had to track down the Source left behind by her clansmen after their death, not an easy task. Still, it was best to be careful. If Zhu Qing really did return, then she would probably stick to him like a leech again, impossible to get rid of.

“Palace Master, what arrangements should be made for these two families?” Hua Qing Si asked.

Yang Kai responded, “Why are you asking me, aren’t you the Head Manager? Just settle them down wherever suitable, no need for preferential treatment or whatnot. Pick out some cultivators with good aptitude as well so they can become the first batch of disciples of High Heaven Palace, then focus on training them for a little.”

“Understood,” Hua Qing Si nodded.

After hearing what Yang Kai had to say, she knew what to do.

“You go make the arrangements, I still have something to talk to you about later.” Yang Kai waved his hand.

“Yes!” Hua Qing Si answered. Then, she flew into the sky and shouted, “Everyone, since you have entered our High Heaven Palace, you are all now one of us! Come with me.”

She was still an Emperor Realm Master after all, so as soon as she spoke, the two families immediately became serious and followed her.

In the blink of an eye, more than a hundred people left the plaza.

Body shifting, Yang Kai arrived at his own chambers.

Half a day later, Hua Qing Si came to report the situation to him. The two families were arranged to stay on a mountain peak with a decent World Energy density. There were ready-made buildings there that were enough for them to settle into. Hua Qing Si had also left them some cultivation materials, and told them that their cultivation situation would be checked on in a year. After that, they would be given different statuses depending on their progress.

There was nothing to criticize about her arrangements and Yang Kai believed that the two families would have nothing to complain about. The two families were barely eking out a living in Maplewood City and were constantly on edge against outside threats. Now, not only had High Heaven Palace provided them with a safe and secure place to live, they were even provided with an outstanding cultivation environment and resources, so they were naturally happy and excited.

“Palace Master, you said you had something to speak to me about earlier. What is it?” Hua Qing Si asked after she finished reporting on the situation of the two families.

“En, it’s like this. When I went to the Southern Territory, I made a deal with the Violet Source Chamber of Commerce,” Yang Kai briefly explained the details to her.

Hua Qing Si urged him on, “And?”

Yang Kai continued, “And then I suddenly wondered whether our High Heaven Palace could achieve a long-term business relationship with the Violet Source Chamber of Commerce. We’re in the Northern Territory, while they’re in the Southern Territory. The products of both regions are different. Some things may be cheap and abundant in the Northern Territory, but once you arrive in the Southern Territory, it becomes expensive and rare. The same is also true the other way around.”

“So, we buy low, sell high!” Hua Qing Si understood instantly.

Many merchants did the same in the Star Boundary, but they had to trek through countless mountains and across countless rivers, passing through many dangerous obstacles in order to move between the two territories. The slightest mistake could cost them all their wealth, or even their lives.

But it was different for High Heaven Palace. With the Cross-Territory Space Array, they could casually move between two territories. With this natural advantage, they were sure to make money with this deal.

Hua Qing Si smiled, “Even if Palace Master didn’t mention it, I’ve also thought of this point before.”

“Oh? Then, if you have any thoughts, let’s hear them,” Yang Kai looked at her with interest.

Hua Qing Si said solemnly, “It is a very good idea, and will definitely be profitable, but there is one difficulty that I’m not sure Palace Master has considered.”

“Please explain,” Yang Kai accepted advice with an open mind.

“Whether there is enough manpower or not is a problem. As Palace Master knows, our High Heaven Palace does not have many proper disciples. If we were truly to do this, then we would definitely require a large amount of manpower, but compared to this, sourcing materials is an even bigger problem. Unless…”

“Unless what?”

Hua Qing Si smiled, “Unless Palace Master can find someone to help gather supplies for us.”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, “Like Fire Dragon Palace and the Full Sky Sect, for example! Sister Hua, you’re quite wicked!”

Hua Qing Si pouted, “They owe us so many Source Crystals anyway. It’s gracious of us to even let them pay for it in materials.”

“That’s not a bad idea,” Yang Kai smiled and nodded, “By the way, why don’t we ask Ice Heart Valley as well? Unlike us, Ice Heart Valley has deep and vast roots, so it should be easy for them to gather resources in the Northern Territory.”

“Good!”
