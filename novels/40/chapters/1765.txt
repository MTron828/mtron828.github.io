Chapter 1765, You Know How To Feel Shy? 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Yang Kai held a deep animosity towards Xu Wei for trying to use him as bait to escape, so he certainly was not going to let him just go. Taking advantage of Xu Wei’s overconfidence, the moment he relaxed, Yang Kai used his Blossoming Lotus Secret Technique.

This was not the end though, as Yang Kai flicked his wrist and summoned out his Verdant Dragon Bone Sword. Together with a loud dragon roar, a giant dark green dragon appeared and pounced towards Xu Wei while spitting out a stream of extremely toxic and corrosive poison.

Xu Wei’s grin instantly stiffened on his face and his eyes shrank.

He never expected Yang Kai to launch such a fierce attack towards him, a genuine Origin King.

The next instant, Xu Wei noticed a stream of pure Spiritual Energy bombard his Knowledge Sea’s defences, and despite the difference in cultivation, the barrier around Xu Wei’s Knowledge Sea was instantly cracked open, a strange rotating lotus bud appeared inside it, and immediately began to bloom.

Instantly, Xu Wei’s head felt like it was being split apart and he could not help screaming as he hurriedly tried to stabilize his Soul by focusing the power of Knowledge Sea to suppress and expel this strange lotus flower.

Fortunately for him, his cultivation was not weak, and although he was caught completely off guard by Yang Kai and suffered an initial blow, once he mobilized the power of his Knowledge Sea, the slowly blooming lotus was quickly suppressed.

However, if he wanted to destroy or expel it, Xu Wei knew he would need to expend considerable effort.

Yet Xu Wei could not focus solely on the anomaly in his Knowledge Sea because the giant dark green dragon was about to crash into him, its giant maw wide open, ready to tear him apart. In front of the giant dragon, he seemed as small as an ant.

Seeing that the dragon was about to swallow him whole, Xu Wei grit his teeth and the crimson light surrounding his body glowed even brighter, allowing his speed to jump once more so he could dodge the dragon’s dangerous blow.

When he appeared again, he was already ten kilometres away, but his face was slightly pale, and his breathing was ragged.

First, he had been forced to flee with Kong Fa for a long time, then he fought with countless Illusionary Void Butterflies. After that, he used a Secret Technique that caused great consumption twice and suffered an attack from Yang Kai’s Blossoming Lotus Secret Technique...

Even if Xu Wei was an Origin King, such intense consumption had pushed his limits.

Turning back, he glared at Yang Kai and Xue Yue, who were now engulfed by the Illusionary Void Butterflies, and roared, “Boy, you’d best pray you die here. Otherwise, this King will make you regret being born in this world!”

As an Origin King Realm, being sneak attacked by a junior at the Origin Realm was a great shame. Fortunately, no one was here to witness the scene, so he was able to preserve his face. After leaving this threat though, Xu Wei immediately escaped.

Xu Wei did not think Yang Kai and Xue Yue would be able to survive against so many Illusionary Void Butterflies!

Even if it was him, under the current circumstances, he was not sure he would be able to escape with his life; if this wasn’t the case, he wouldn’t have made such an effort to entrap these two juniors.

“Hmph!” Yang Kai coldly snorted before coming to a stop and not moving.

Being delayed by Xu Wei, he and Xue Yue now had no chance of escape.

The number of Illusionary Void Butterflies surrounding them was twice as large as before; after all, once Xu Wei had disappeared, the Illusionary Void Butterflies which were attacking him had changed targets.

The twenty Blood Beasts were released by Yang Kai once again to form a shield for him and Xue Yue while also attracting the attention of the Illusionary Void Butterflies. The giant dark green dragon also joined this lineup.

On the other hand, Xue Yue, who stood beside Yang Kai, wore a solemn expression on her face as sweat dripped down her forehead. Constantly using her Origin King grade artifact consumed a great deal of her Saint Qi, but she had no intention of simply giving up, popping pills into her mouth to restore herself as she continued to kill the enemy.

Even her Xie Zhi Symbiotic Monster Spirit was summoned.

This Symbiotic Monster Spirit was extremely powerful, not inferior to Xue Yue herself. In the Emperor Garden many years ago, Xue Yue had once used this Symbiotic Monster Spirit to compete with Shan Qing Luo’s Heavenly Moon Demon Spider evenly, so its strength was unquestionable.

Even so, this was undoubtedly a losing battle. The Blood Beasts continued to grow dimmer and were seemingly at risk of collapsing at any time, forcing Yang Kai to contract the defense circles repeatedly.

“Why aren’t you worried?” Xue Yue suddenly turned her head to look at Yang Kai and asked with an anxious expression while continuing to move her hands to launch powerful Secret Techniques to kill the Illusionary Void Butterflies in order to relieve pressure on the Blood Beasts.

It was not until this point that she noticed that Yang Kai still had a calm and relaxed expression, completely unlike what one should look like when facing a dead end.

“Why should I be worried?” Yang Kai chuckled while asking rhetorically, controlling his Golden Blood Threads to harvest the lives of numerous Illusionary Void Butterflies at once.

“Aren’t you afraid of death?” Xue Yue seemed to be affected by his demeanor and also became somewhat calmer.

“Nonsense!” Yang Kai spat disdainfully, “Who isn’t afraid of death? But... there’s a saying that dying on a bed of flowers is the best way to go!”

Xue Yue was taken aback for a moment before she glared at Yang Kai and spat, “Even now, you have the mood to joke?”

Yang Kai laughed dryly but did not respond.

Although their current situation appeared extremely dangerous, it was actually quite simple for him to resolve. He had at least two ways to get escape from these Illusionary Void Butterflies.

The easiest was to enter the Sealed World Bead together with Xue Yue. Once the two of them disappeared, the Illusionary Void Butterflies would simply leave.

Alternatively, he could simply tear space and escape!

Although space here was somewhat chaotic and interfered with Yang Kai’s use of Space Force, it would not be a problem to cross one or two hundred kilometres.

Both methods were highly effective, and Yang Kai had full confidence he could succeed.

However, in both cases, he would expose some of his own cards, especially the Sealed World Bead, which was a whole independent world. This kind of treasure was too incredible, and Yang Kai did not dare to expose it in front of Xue Yue.

After all, she was the Young Master of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, and their relationship was not close enough for Yang Kai to be sharing such secrets with her.

As such, he was debating how to suffer the least losses before acting.

“Yang Kai...” Xue Yue suddenly called out to him again.

“What?” Yang Kai turned his head and looked at her, feeling that the tone of her voice seemed somewhat strange at the moment.

“Have you always hated me?” Xue Yue asked, her gaze darting back and forth, seemingly afraid to meet eyes with Yang Kai.

“Why would I hate you?” Yang Kai was stunned.

“Because I sent people to chase after and kill you... Also, I said some harsh words to you and tried to suppress you!” Xue Yue said softly.

“Haha!” Yang Kai laughed loudly.

“What are you laughing at?” Xue Yue frowned and stared at Yang Kai with displeasure. She wanted to have a serious talk with Yang Kai, but the other party acted so crass, causing her to feel like she was being mocked.

Yang Kai looked at her jokingly, grinned, and said, “The Young Master of the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce is so sentimental. Women will be women in the end!”

This sentence seemed to have hit a nerve as Xue Yue ground her teeth and screamed, “So what if I’m a woman? I was born a woman and never wanted to be a man! It has always been like this! After so many years, who even considers what I want or how I feel?”

As she screamed, she grabbed something on her chest and ripped it off.

In a brilliant flash of light, the Xue Yue standing in front of Yang Kai instantly changed appearance.

Now, she no longer looked like an extraordinarily brave and heroic man and had instead become a woman with world-destroying beauty. Long hair cascaded down her back and two great peaks towered beneath her robes. Her crystal-like eyes glared towards Yang Kai furiously as she ground her teeth in frustration.

Coupled with the male robes she wore, Xue Yue now gave off a completely different kind of temptation.

Yang Kai gawked for a moment before scratching his nose in amazement, “I was only making a casual remark, why did you have such an intense reaction?”

Xue Yue simply continued to glare, the light of love and hate that had become somewhat familiar to Yang Kai flashing across her eyes.

“Ha...” Yang Kai looked helpless, “Is it okay for you to be like this? If anyone saw you, it would not be good for your Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce. If someone learned about your Special Constitution, they might try to abduct you.”

Xue Yue’s Special Constitution had great temptation, even to Origin Kings. The Dragon Marrow Phoenix Body was something that many could only dream of, and any man who was able to claim Xue Yue’s Primordial Yin would obtain a massive boost in strength without any hidden dangers.

Xue Yue’s Primordial Yin could be said to be the greatest cultivation treasure and had an unimaginable temptation to those Origin Kings who had been unable to increase their strength despite countless years of self-torture.

Even if she had the identity of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce’s Young Master, there would always be some people who would be willing to take risks to obtain her.

There was never a lack of crazed people in this world.

Xue Yue sneered as she brushed her hair back behind her ear amorously, squinted at Yang Kai, and said leisurely, “Who else is here besides you and me? Besides, you already know I am a woman and you have known about my Special Constitution for a long time, yet you’ve never tried to make a move based on it! What’s wrong? Is this Young Master... Young Lady, not attractive to you at all?”

“What are you talking about?” Yang Kai’s expression suddenly became unnatural. Although he was well versed in the affairs between men and women, he still felt that certain women were impossible to understand.

In such a place and in such an environment, Xue Yue was even asking him if he thought she wasn’t attractive, a question he simply didn’t know how to answer.

“A shameless man like you actually knows how to feel shy?” Xue Yue also blushed but continued taunting Yang Kai none-the-less, “I really didn’t know that you had such thin face. When we were on that Dead Star, didn’t you simply know no shame?”

“That was an accident alright?” Yang Kai glared at her, “That happened so many years ago, why bring it up now? Didn’t we agree we should just forget about it altogether?”

“Who agreed to it? I’ll never be able to forget!” Xue Yue’s chest heaved as a wave of anger overcame her and she recklessly killed a big swath of Illusionary Void Butterflies on the spot.

“Fine, what do you want then?” Yang Kai looked down at her frustratedly, “Stop acting so confusing and just make it clear.”

“What do I want?!” Xue Yue ground her teeth and shouted, “What do you think I want!? What can I even do!?”

In a near hysteria, she screamed three times in succession, as if trying to release all the grievances in her heart at once.
