After all that he had experienced during his cultivating journey, Yang Kai could be considered to be a very knowledgeable person, and yet he was still stunned by the abundant treasures he found here in Seeking Passion Sect.

It was such a windfall to have gained such a large amount of wealth suddenly.

“There’s more over there!” Ji Yao pointed.

Everyone looked in the direction she pointed and saw that in the deepest part of the cave, were three stone platforms. On each platform was placed a box that was shrouded by a light curtain.

Seeing that they were preserved so carefully, it was obvious that the objects inside these boxes must be absolutely extraordinary.

Yang Kai walked over enthusiastically, took out the token that opened the storehouse before, and waved it over one of the stone platforms. The mysterious light flashed, and the restriction opened up in response.

Yang Kai picked up the long box placed on the stone platform.

“Let’s have a look at what precious treasure it is.” The three Monster Kings gathered next to him, all looking at it with relish. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Everyone had curiosity, and Monster Kings were no exception.

As Yang Kai weighed the long box in his hand though, confusion surfaced on his face, “It seems to be empty.”

“It can’t be.” Ying Fei looked stunned while Xie Wu Wei and Xi Lei were also unwilling to believe it, but they also knew that Yang Kai had no reason to lie to them.

In front of everyone’s eyes, Yang Kai opened the long box in his hand, and as expected, there was nothing in it.

“What’s the point of putting an empty box here with such grandeur?” Ying Fei scoffed angrily, rather disappointed.

Yang Kai looked at the length of the empty box for a moment before his brow twitched suddenly. He then took something out of his Space Ring and placed it into the box, something that fit quite snugly.

“Is this… The Emperor Artifact Feng Xuan used before?” Xie Wu Wei raised his brow, recognizing the Emperor Artifact that Yang Kai had taken out.

Yang Kai nodded, “The Wind and Thunder Divine Spear is said to be a relic of the Seeking Passion Great Emperor!”

“So that’s it. That Wind and Thunder Divine Spear was originally kept here and Feng Xuan only took it out when necessary.” Xie Wu Wei looked astonished.

“That should be it. After all, it’s the legacy of his ancestors. Even if Feng Xuan is the Sect Master of the Seeking Passion Sect, he can’t carry this Emperor Artifact with him at all times.” Yang Kai nodded and put away the box.

It was certain that the object originally placed in this empty box was the Wind and Thunder Divine Spear. As for the remaining two boxes, since they were also placed here with the same importance, they were definitely not less valuable than the Wind and Thunder Divine Spear.

Curious to know what treasures were contained inside the two other boxes, Yang Kai did not hesitate. He removed the restrictions for the two stone platforms directly, picked up a box, and opened the lid.

Ying Fei’s quick hands picked up the last box and began inspecting.

“Huh…” Yang Kai raised his brow as his eyes gleamed, “This is…”

As soon as the box in his hand opened, an extremely pure World Energy rippled through the air, causing the Emperor Qi in his body to resonate with it. It seemed that this pure energy would greatly benefit his cultivation.

“Source Crystals!” Xie Wu Wei interjected, but soon his face changed slightly, “Peak-Rank Source Crystals!”

“Peak Rank Source Crystals?” Xi Lei also stared at the box in Yang Kai’s hand. Even Ji Yao, who was impervious to all the previous treasures, could not help stealing a glance at it.

“To think these are Peak-Rank Source Crystals!” Yang Kai grinned and stretched out his hand to take out a piece of Source Crystal. It was about the size of a thumb, and completely pure and clear.

These Source Crystals were a size smaller than regular High-Rank Source Crystals, but the World Energy stored in them vastly exceeded that of High-Rank Source Crystals.

In the Star Boundary, once a cultivator had cultivated to the Emperor Realm, Low-Rank Source Crystals and even Mid-Rank Source Crystals were of little use to them. Generally, Emperors needed to use High-Rank Source Crystals to cultivate. Even the transaction of some valuable items was done exclusively using High-Rank Source Crystals.

However, above High-Rank Source Crystals was an even better version called Peak Rank Source Crystals.

Compared to High-Rank Source Crystals, Peak Rank Source Crystals were like phoenix feathers or kirin’s horns, one in a billion in terms of rarity.

It was rare to even find one or two pieces in an entire top-grade Source Crystal Lode. Every Peak Rank Source Crystal seemed to be exclusively formed by the hand of the Heavens themselves.

According to rumours, there were many uses for Peak Rank Source Crystals, but the biggest use was for cultivators to break through bottlenecks. If any cultivator encountered a bottleneck in their cultivation, a single Peak Rank Source Crystal used as an auxiliary would be the best external aid, and would not cause any hidden dangers like pills.

In the Star Boundary, countless Emperors Realm Masters cultivated for thousands of years but remained stuck at their bottleneck, unable to make progress. These cultivators would always try searching for the legendary Peak Rank Source Crystals as they represented hope to make further progress.

However, how difficult was it to find a Peak Rank Source Crystal? The efforts of these cultivators who were pursuing these Source Crystals painstakingly were almost always destined to be in vain.

Yet here, in the storehouse of Seeking Passion Sect, was a box of Peak Rank Source Crystals, and there were as many as seven of them neatly placed inside the box.

“Such a treasure! It’s just a pity…” Xi Lei shook his head while admiring.

The other two Monster Kings’ brows twitched upon hearing this and repeated, “A pity indeed.”

Although Peak Rank Source Crystals were useful for breakthroughs for cultivators, the three of them had already reached the peak of their potential as Monster Kings. In other words, these Peak Rank Source Crystals couldn’t provide any aid to them, despite their rarity.

The only way for them to surpass their current level was to pin their hopes on obtaining a Divine Spirit Source, enabling them to awaken the bloodlines of their distant ancestors.

If it were not for this reason, how could they be so willing to be ordered around by Yang Kai with their level of strength?

Yang Kai also understood why it was a pity for them, but he did not comment, simply putting the box away and turning to Ying Fei, “What’s inside your box?”

Ying Fei answered with a sullen face, “A Secret Art!”

After speaking, he handed the box to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai took it, swept his eyes across the box, and his complexion instantly became pensive before he exclaimed in a low voice, “The Seeking Passion Supreme Art!”

This was the true foundation of the Seeking Passion Sect, and it was also the Seeking Passion Great Emperor’s greatest accomplishment. To cultivate this Secret Art, the deeper the passion was invested in it, the faster one would cultivate while the target of that passion would be met with a miserable fate.

This was because once under the influence of the Seeking Passion Supreme Art, the person who was sowed with passion would never be able to extricate themselves from it. Not only would she be unable to advance her cultivation, but she would also be under complete control of the Seeking Passion Supreme Art cultivator.

Feng Xi fell in love with Zi Yu of Ice Heart Valley, and although his love was true, his primary intent for Zi Yu was to make her fall in love with him so he could use her for the sake of his cultivation. If he succeeded in marrying her, Zi Yu would end up no better than Feng Xi’s personal servant and would never be able to touch the mysteries of the Emperor Realm for the rest of her life.

This Seeking Passion Supreme Art was both righteous and evil. Although it was an extraordinary skill, Yang Kai looked at it scornfully.

He always felt that this Secret Art relied too much on external forces and hindered one from seeking the true peak of the Martial Dao. He even wondered how the Seeking Passion Great Emperor was able to achieve such a supreme position using such a flawed Secret Art.

He put this box away casually then turned around to address everyone, “Look around and see if there is anything you want. If there is, just take it.”

The three Monster Kings exchanged excited looks before grinning, cupping their fists as they chanted in unison, “Then, we will not be shy.”

There was no reason to go back empty-handed when they were in a place filled with treasures. There were many treasures here that even roused the excitement of the three Monster Kings.

The three of them dispersed quickly, obviously each having a goal in mind.

Yang Kai gave Ji Yao the same permission, “You may also go look around.”

Ji Yao shook her head and said, “No need. It’s all your credit that Ice Heart Valley was able to overcome this crisis, so I cannot take anything more.”

“As you wish!” Yang Kai knew that with her temper, it was useless to try to persuade her once she had made up her mind. He was smart enough to not waste his efforts and instead began wandering around the storehouse, waving his hands as he sent the tens of thousands of years’ worth of accumulation of Seeking Passion Sect into his Sealed World Bead.

After a while, the Treasury’s contents were reduced by more than half.

At the same time, the three Monster Kings had also returned one after another.

Yang Kai glanced at them and saw that they did not take many things; each took some jade bottles filled with pills as well as one Emperor Artifact per person.

The Monster Race could not practice Alchemy, so although the Ancient Wild Lands was rich in Spirit Herbs, these precious resources couldn’t be put to good use. All herbs and spirit fruits were basically swallowed directly, greatly wasting their medicinal efficacies.

Now that there were so many pills here, the three Monster Kings naturally had to take some; after all, one can never be too prepared.

As for the Emperor Artifacts, it was natural for them to take one each. They were grinning ear to ear, each holding their chosen weapon in hand.

“Is that enough?” Yang Kai asked with a smile, “There are a lot of good things here.”

“Enough, enough!” Ying Fei nodded repeatedly, “Although there are a lot of good things, there are not many useful things for us. These are enough.”

Xie Wu Wei and Xi Lei also nodded in agreement.

Yang Kai did not say anymore and just continued to collect things.

After a full stick of incense, the huge underground cave was empty as the massive amount of wealth and treasure had all been moved into the Sealed World Bead by Yang Kai.

With these things acting as a base asset, if Yang Kai really wanted to start a Sect in the future, resources would definitely not be a problem.

“I suddenly thought of something,” Ji Yao frowned slightly. “It was probably thanks to those Peak-Rank Sources Crystals that Yao Zhuo broke through to the Third-Order Emperor Realm.”

Yang Kai nodded in agreement, “That makes sense!”

Yao Zhuo used to be a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master, but all of a sudden he achieved a breakthrough. If there was a reason for this other than some sudden enlightenment and opportunity, the Peak Rank Source Crystals were the most likely it.

Ji Yao chuckled lightly, “It’s pointless to ponder over this now. He’s already dead anyway.”

“En, let’s go.” Yang Kai beckoned and took the lead to return along the same path they came.

After leaving the Treasury, the cliff closed again and Yang Kai took out the token to restore the restriction.

Turning his head and looking around, Yang Kai stated, “I want to arrange a Space Array here, find something to amuse yourselves with around here.”

The three Monster Kings nodded their heads and spread out.

Ji Yao questioned, “Are you connecting Ice Heart Valley to Seeking Passion Sect?”

Yang Kai nodded and explained, “En, if there’s a direct connection, it will be convenient to come and go in the future.”

Since he had plans to set down roots here, Yang Kai would naturally be visiting Ice Heart Valley far more frequently in the future. There was already a Space Array arranged in Ice Heart Valley by him, which also connected with the Ancient Lands. Therefore, Yang Kai could directly connect to those two places if he arranged another Space Array here.

In the past, Yang Kai had never had a place of his own in the Star Boundary, and he never gave it much thought either, but now that he had such plans, this arrangement was indispensable.
