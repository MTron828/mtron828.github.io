Several figures stopped in the void. Yang Kai looked left and right for a bit before he asked, “Is this the place?”

The middle-aged man in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm nodded, “Yes!”

“Announce our arrival.” Yang Kai gestured.

A trace of struggle crossed the middle-aged man’s face, but he called out loudly nonetheless, “Divine Monarch, Yang Kai is here! Please open the portal, Divine Monarch!”

The void remained silent, and there was no reaction.

He shouted once more, but there was no movement.

Yang Kai turned to look at the middle-aged man and narrowed his eyes slightly, turning the middle-aged man as pale as a death sentence prisoner. His voice trembled as he shouted again, “Please open the portal, Divine Monarch!”

“Are you sure this is the place?” Yang Kai asked impatiently.

The middle-aged man nodded nervously, “It’s right here.”

Yang Kai frowned slightly. He did not understand the reason for the middle-aged man’s reaction.

In any case, if Bright Sun Divine Monarch was really hiding here but refused to reveal himself, then it could only mean that he was afraid of Hong Hu. He probably never imagined that the Phoenix Clan would show up. Even if he was in the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm, he was bound to suffer a loss against a Master like Hong Hu.

Space Principles began fluctuating with a single thought from Yang Kai. Like a pebble thrown into a calm lake, a circle of ripples spread out into the surroundings with him as the centre. Consequently, the Void became distorted everywhere the ripples passed.

Beside him, Hong Hu watched with bright eyes. She raised her hand slightly to feel the mysteries of Space Principles. It was her first time seeing such a strange power, so she couldn’t help being curious.

At the beginning, nothing much changed, but as time passed, the Space Principles that spread out like ripples on the surface of the water began to show a weak fluctuation. It was as though the swift river current had encountered a large boulder.

Yang Kai’s gaze shifted in a certain direction. At the same time, he urged the Space Principles more and more fiercely. The weak fluctuations gradually became more and more obvious as a result.

About an incense stick later, even Hong Hu and the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters who did not understand anything about the Dao of Space could detect the anomaly.

Under the agitation of Space Principles, it soon became clear that there was a large space at that spot in the Void which was different from its surroundings. That location was none other than the entrance connecting the Universe Cave Heaven where Bright Sun Divine Monarch lived to the outside world!

Yang Kai was just about to increase his efforts to forcibly break open the entrance when space distorted and opened to reveal a portal. Immediately after that, Cheng Yang’s figure stepped out from within and he loudly said, “I was not aware of your arrival, Lady Hong Hu. Please forgive this Cheng for my lack of hospitality!” After saying that, he turned to look at his two subordinates. His voice became cold and ruthless, “Incompetent good-for-nothings! What’s the use of having you!?”

The expressions of those two changed greatly when they heard those words, and they immediately begged for mercy. Nonetheless, Cheng Yang ignored their pleading and raised his hand. When he slammed his palm down, the power of an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master flooded out and a mighty World Force filled the void.

With the power of a single palm strike, the heads of the two Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were crushed on the spot. Their headless corpses swayed slightly, then their Small Universes collapsed and their World Force dissipated!

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes slightly.

Hong Hu coldly snorted, “How impressive, Divine Monarch!”

Cheng Yang had decisively killed two of his subordinates in front of her without any hesitation. It was clearly a demonstration of his strength! Although she lived in the Ancestral Land for a long time and this was her first trip to the outside world, even she knew that a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was not just some useless cabbage to discard at will.

A Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master had more than enough strength to stand on their own in the 3,000 Worlds. As long as the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters of the various Cave Heavens and Paradises did not step forward, Sixth-Order Masters could be said to be the strongest!

“Lady Hong Hu, please calm your anger. Cheng Yang’s actions are not what you think. You’ve lived in the Divine Spirit’s Ancestral Land for a long time, so you’re not familiar with the situation in the Shattered Heaven.”

Yang Kai’s eyes flashed slightly as he vaguely realised something and came over to Hong Hu’s side to explain in a low voice, “To the Masters hiding in the Shattered Heaven, their hideouts are their strongest and final layer of defense. Therefore, the location of their hideouts must never be exposed to outsiders, as it will only bring endless troubles to them otherwise.”

It would have been bad enough if those two Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters had brought Yang Kai to this place; however, they even brought Hong Hu along with them. Unable to silence the witnesses, Cheng Yang could only vent his anger on his subordinates in a fit of rage.

If they could bring Yang Kai and Hong Hu here, then wouldn’t they bring his enemies home if they were captured by them in the Shattered Heaven, or worse, the Masters of the Cave Heavens and Paradises in the future? Where would Bright Sun Divine Monarch hide then?

Having said that, Yang Kai was the only person in the world who could easily force open the portal of a Universe Cave Heaven thanks to his proficiency in the Dao of Space. Even if an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master from the Cave Heavens or Paradises were to show up here, they would not have such an easy time despite knowing the location.

Cheng Yang had remained hidden and refused to come out earlier due to his fear of Hong Hu. It was not until he saw that his hideout was about to be forcibly opened that he had no choice but to reveal himself.

“Those who come from afar are guests! Lady Hong Hu, this way please!” Cheng Yang gestured forward.

Hong Hu nodded faintly and stepped inside. Yang Kai shot a look at Qin Fen and quickly followed after Hong Hu.

Upon entering the portal, Cheng Yang immediately took the lead while Yang Kai looked around and raised his brow at the sight, “Divine Monarch, is this place a Universe Cave Heaven?”

“Indeed!” Cheng Yang nodded, “This Universe Cave Heaven was left behind by an unknown Senior. When this Monarch first arrived at the Shattered Heaven, I once fought a battle here and accidentally discovered traces of this Universe Cave Heaven during that fight. However, it took me 300 years just to find the portal and another 100 to get inside.”

After saying that, he gave Yang Kai a meaningful look, “I’ve long heard about the extraordinariness of the Dao of Space, but I’ve never had the honour to witness its greatness before. Having seen it today, this Monarch is truly amazed!”

He had spent hundreds of years just to open the Universe Cave Heaven’s portal and occupy this place. Meanwhile, Yang Kai had only spent an incense to nearly forcibly open the portal.

The contrast nearly made Cheng Yang spit blood in distress. Nevertheless, he knew that there was nothing to envy. The Dao of Space was not something just anybody could cultivate.

Yang Kai smiled, “Many thanks for your high praise, Divine Monarch. I simply specialise in my own field.”

Cheng Yang raised his brow and commented, “You are too humble, Little Brother. Perhaps we can work together on a certain project.”

Yang Kai was astonished, “Cooperate on what?”

Cheng Yang continued, “The Shattered Heaven is vast and boundless, and there are many opportunities coexisting with various risks. Universe Cave Heavens and Universe Paradises are abundant here. Unfortunately, not many of them have been discovered and explored because we do not have the knowledge or ability to do so. Most of them remain hidden in the Void; however, this Monarch knows of no less than five locations where there’s a high possibility that Universe Cave Heavens or Universe Paradises exists. It’s a pity, but I am unable to confirm my suspicions. If you cooperate with this Monarch and join forces to explore these five areas, then there is no need to worry about not finding anything good. As far as I know, the World Spring in your possession was found in one of these Universe Cave Heavens, right?”

Yang Kai was indeed tempted by those words. If what Cheng Yang said was true, it might be a good idea to work together in this matter. Be that as it may, it was not good to reveal how keen he was about the idea lest he was bullied by Cheng Yang as a result.

Even though he was tempted, Yang Kai responded calmly, “That may be so. Unfortunately, I don’t have much time. I will be truthful with you, Divine Monarch. I’ve been away from home for quite a while, and my heart yearns to return. If I had not met your subordinates along the way and learned that Xia Lin Lang was staying at your place as a guest, I would have left the Shattered Heaven by now.”

Cheng Yang chuckled, “It turns out that you are quite a family man, Little Brother Yang.”

Their conversation afterward was not worth mentioning. While the two of them were talking, Hong Hu followed along silently. She showed no intention of expressing her opinion on anything.

Not long afterward, the four of them arrived and landed on a certain Spirit Peak. Several figures immediately rushed out of the palace. It was Xia Lin Lang and her subordinates. They were startled and looked worried upon seeing Qin Fen and Yang Kai arriving together. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

However, Xia Lin Lang immediately felt relieved when she recognised Hong Hu. She had been a guest at Four Phoenix Pavilion during her time in the Ancestral Land, so she knew Hong Hu’s identity. Hurriedly stepping forward, she gave an elegant bow, “Greetings, Lady Hong Hu.”

Hong Hu nodded lightly, “No need to be so polite.”

They did not know each other well, and could even be said that they were mere passing acquaintances, so there was nothing much to say between them.

Xia Lin Lang seemed a little confused by the situation at hand, so she glanced at Yang Kai inquiringly. Yang Kai smiled and said, “I met Brother Qin by chance when I came out of the Ancestral Land. After hearing that you are staying with the Divine Monarch as a guest, I decided to come and pay you a visit.”

She immediately understood the situation and nodded, “Knowing that my residence has been destroyed, the Divine Monarch kindly invited me to stay for a while. The Divine Monarch is so hospitable that I couldn’t refuse. I’m afraid I’ve caused trouble for the Divine Monarch.”

Cheng Yang smiled and waved his hand dismissively, “If you’re willing, you can stay here as long as you want.”

He seemed extremely friendly and hospitable, and if someone who did not know the truth were to witness this scene, they would probably believe that Xia Lin Lang had really been invited to stay here as a guest.

“It’s inappropriate to bother you for too long, Divine Monarch.” While speaking, she glanced at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded, “I also have important matters at hand, so I can’t stay for long.”

Cheng Yang quickly said, “You’ve come from so far away, please allow this Monarch to show you some hospitality. To be honest with you, this Monarch rarely has people coming to visit as guests. I’ve already instructed my people to prepare a banquet. It won’t be too late to leave after.”

Yang Kai turned his head to look at Hong Hu, who nodded lightly in response.

Cheng Yang was an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, and although he was forced to buckle to the pressure and could not do anything to them, it was still better to show him some respect.

Only then did Yang Kai nod in agreement, “Since you’ve already said so much, Divine Monarch, it would be impolite for us to refuse!”

Cheng Yang laughed heartily, “As it should be! Please come this way!”

He led the crowd to a Grand Hall located on another Spirit Peak where sure enough, a banquet had been prepared. When they all took their seats, an endless number of delicacies were served to the table. There were also beautiful young women singing and dancing below them to enhance the atmosphere.

Yang Kai and Cheng Yang were like old friends who had not seen each other in a long time, drinking and toasting with each other frequently.

Hong Hu was not interested in alcohol, singing, or dancing. On the contrary, she fell in love with the beautiful and delicious fruits placed in front of her which she ate in small bites.

Meanwhile, Xia Lin Lang and the others had complicated expressions on their faces. Just yesterday, they were prisoners. They never imagined that they would become guests of honour in the blink of an eye. Their statuses had changed so quickly that they felt extremely uncomfortable. It gave them the feeling of being in a dream.

After several rounds of drinks, Cheng Yang was flushed red due to alcohol and raised his glass and said, “Little Brother Yang, if I have to say it myself, we have a friendship born from fighting each other! This Monarch rarely admires anybody, but I truly admire you! You are the first Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master to escape from this Monarch!”
