Outside the palace, above a certain empty plain, Gao Xue Ting faced off against the Third-Order Emperor Realm Grandma You with just her First-Order Emperor Realm cultivation, yet she showed no fear.

Brushing her hair back behind her ear, Gao Xue Ting spoke calmly, “Grandma, how about we end matters here?”

Grandma You was slightly taken aback by her words, but she soon burst out laughing and shouted, “Little girl, who do you think you’re talking to?”

“You, of course, Grandma,” Gao Xue Ting remained as indifferent as before, “If you promise to end matters here, then the Temple Master may show some leniency and not give you any trouble, but if you insist on continuing this... Grandma, you and I have known each other for hundreds of years, and even if you never officially joined the temple, you still showed some affection towards us, so I do not wish to use ruthless measures.”

“Are you threatening me?” Grandma You’s face turned fierce and her voice became sharp.

Gao Xue Ting shook her head, “Grandma is my Senior, Xue Ting does not dare to threaten you, but Xue Ting has received orders from the Temple Master to bring these disciples into the Divine Ascension Mirror to train, so she must keep them safe. I will allow no one to hurt them, not even you... Grandma!”

“Hehehe...” Grandma You began to laugh, “Little girl, your strength isn’t much but your words certainly are big! What do you think you can do to this Queen with your puny abilities? If not for how well-behaved you’d been all these years, you think this Queen would even bother talking to you like this?”

“Grandma, do you still remember when Xue Ting would secretly bring you food when Xue Ting was small?” Gao Xue Ting suddenly brought up the past.

Grandma You’s face turned cold and she said in a cold voice, “What are you bringing that up for?”

A hint of nostalgia could not help but flash past her eyes, and her fierce expression softened slightly for a moment.

“Xue Ting sincerely hopes that Grandma can stop things here!” Gao Xue Ting sighed.

“Impossible!” The coldness reappeared in Grandma You’s eyes and she yelled, “This Queen has waited so many years and finally found a trace of hope. You want this Queen to give up with just a few words? That’s foolish nonsense!”

Gao Xue Ting frowned, “I don’t know what you’re waiting for, or what you’re hoping for, Grandma, but... Must you do this? It’s been eight hundred years, and even though you never did so formally, Gao Xue Ting has long taken you as a member of the temple, and also Xue Ting’s Senior. Xue Ting really... does not want to raise her hand against you!”

“Enough nonsense!” Grandma You’s patience had also run out and she raised her voice, “You either stand aside now, or this Queen will kill you right here and now. It’s your choice.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s face could not help but tense up. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Even though Gao Xue Ting was also considered a Master, he knew she was not the opponent to someone at Grandma You’s level. If he ended up dragging Gao Xue Ting into danger, it would definitely wrack him with guilt.

“Haa...” Gao Xue Ting suddenly sighed deeply and looked at Grandma You, saying, “Grandma, the Temple Master knew all along you were harbouring a grudge against him because of that battle back then. Even so, he still had me lead the team into this Divine Ascension Mirror at ease, not worried that you would bring them any harm at all. Why do you think that is?”

At these words, Grandma You’s face changed slightly and she thought about it with a frown.

Gao Xue Ting continued, “Over the years, many disciples who entered the Divine Ascension Mirror to train were killed by you, yet the Temple Master never held you responsible and instead accepted it naturally as a kind of tempering test for the disciples. One part of this is because you did not act personally. Even if you sent your subordinates out for them, you would only send cultivators at similar strengths to them, which can indeed be considered a type of test. Secondly, the Temple Master felt that he owed you; after all, you were the one who discovered the Divine Ascension Mirror. Even though he did take it by force, he did treat it as the most precious capital of the temple, repeatedly allowing his disciples to enter this place and train.”

“Wen Zi Shan feels that he owes this Queen?” Grandma You suddenly sneered. “He really feels that way despite having fed his conscience to the dogs? That’s simply laughable!”

Gao Xue Ting said, unmoved, “That is why the Temple Master has instructed us not to use this last resort unless there is no other choice! Because he sincerely hoped that you would guard the Divine Ascension Mirror.”

“What last resort?” Grandma You’s face suddenly tensed up as she stared at Gao Xue Ting with glaring eyes.

But Gao Xue Ting did not answer her, instead just forming a series of seals with her hands and saying, “Rest assured, Grandma. I have already informed the Temple Master of this matter through a Secret Technique. He should be waiting in the stone cavern at this moment. You can speak with him in detail when your Soul returns.”

With that, she pushed her palms forward and a light circle blossomed from them, gently shooting out straight towards Grandma You.

This light was clearly not some kind of attack and carried no threat with it, but Grandma You’s face changed drastically the instant she saw it and she shrieked in terror, “No!”

As she screamed, she even turned around and ran, trying to flee.

But though she may be fast, the circle of light was even faster, and in an instant, it hit her and melted into her Soul.

The next moment, an inexplicable force rose up, and a strange vortex appeared above Grandma You’s head, emitting a strong suction force as it sucked her away.

Naturally, Grandma You wasn’t going to just stand there and take this, so in a fury, she let out a hysterical roar and released a surge of pure Spiritual Energy that shot towards Gao Xue Ting.

Gao Xue Ting’s face changed.

Grandma You’s desperate attack was clearly made with her full strength and not something she could take on with her power. She could only try to dodge it.

But just as she was about to move, a figure suddenly appeared in mid-air before her. It was an old man with an immortal temperament and an all-white beard. His entire being was inconspicuous, and if he did not take the initiative to show himself, no one present would have noticed him.

As soon as the old man appeared, he lightly waved his sleeve.

A soft power spread out, neutralizing the impact of Grandma You with ease.

“You...” Grandma You’s eyes widened as she stared at the old man with a look of disbelief, as if she had seen a ghost.

But right at that moment, she could no longer resist the power from the vortex above her and her body was sucked into it amidst her unresigned roars. Immediately after, the vortex disappeared without a trace along with Grandma You’s figure.

As Yang Kai watched this scene, thoughts were churning deep in his mind.

Wen Zi Shan must have left some kind of seal on Grandma You’s body and had taught Gao Xue Ting how to activate it.

Once this Seal was activated, Grandma You’s physical body would draw her Soul Back.

And that is what led to this scene. After being hit by the Secret Technique, the Third-Order Emperor Realm Grandma You was simply unable to remain in the Divine Ascension World.

Even though this was only Yang Kai’s guess, it couldn’t be far off; after all, the physical body and the Soul are inextricably linked. The only thing that could draw Grandma You’s Soul out of this world so forcefully would be her true body.

While Yang Kai was speculating, Gao Xue Ting was staring at the old man who suddenly appeared before her with a look of suspicion on her face.

She released her Divine Sense to probe this old man, but when it came in contact with him, she was shocked to find that as far as she could tell, he didn’t exist! In other words, her Divine Sense was unable to detect any traces of him.

This discovery caused Gao Xue Ting’s face to turn serious in an instant.

Even against Masters like Grandma You and Wen Zi Shan, she would be able to detect a trace of her opponent’s presence with her Divine Sense, so the situation here with this old man was a first for her.

There was only one explanation for this strange phenomenon... the cultivation of this old man must be even higher than Grandma You and Wen Zi Shan’s!

Since those two were already Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters, the only existence which was higher than them had a special name in both worlds, Great Emperor!

There was actually a Great Emperor within the world of the Divine Ascension Mirror!

Wen Zi Shan had never told her such a thing, so perhaps even he was unaware of this fact.

Gao Xue Ting stood in awe and quickly bowed, “Junior Gao Xue Ting greets Senior!”

“En!” The old man nodded lightly.

“Senior... Are you perhaps partners with Grandma?” Gao Xue Ting asked.

Yang Kai looked at Gao Xue Ting with a bewildered face and suddenly realized that the icy cold Elder Gao actually had such a cute side to her too.

If he was with Grandma You, then he wouldn’t have needed to help her just now. He would have subdued her a long time ago. Why would he give her the chance to perform the Secret Technique?

“No,” the old man shook his head slowly.

“Junior offers her sincere thanks for Senior’s life-saving grace. I just don’t know if Senior...” Gao Xue Ting asked tentatively. Even though she did not feel the slightest hostility from this old man, his astonishing cultivation made it so she did not dare to show the least bit of carelessness, lest she accidentally anger or upset him.

If she did, then even Wen Zi Shan would not be able to save her.

“This old master came here...” As the old man spoke, he turned his gaze towards Yang Kai and said solemnly, “For him!”

“For me?” Yang Kai had a stunned look on his face.

Gao Xue Ting was also slightly taken aback, turning unconsciously towards Yang Kai, wondering what was so special about him that a Great Emperor had personally come to find him.

As far as she knew, Yang Kai was entering the Divine Ascension Mirror for the first time and did not even know about its existence before then. So, it was unlikely that these two had met each other before.

After settling her thoughts, Gao Xue Ting asked, “May I ask Senior what he needs from him?”

The old man smiled amiably and said, “Rest assured, this old master will not trouble him in any way. I simply need a few days of his time to help this old master with a certain matter. I will send him out from here after it is done.”

Gao Xue Ting raised her brows in surprise, “Out from here... Senior, what do you know?”

Clearly, the fact that the old man mentioned getting out from this place revealed some extraordinary information.

The old man smiled and said, “This old master can take a slight peep at the outside world, so I also know about you and the other outlanders!”

Yang Kai was shocked at his words!

Yi Quan knew about the Divine Ascension World because of Wen Zi Shan’s drunken ramblings; however, this old man was able to spy on the outside world with his own ability.

That confirmed that the strength of this old man had already reached the Great Emperor Realm. It was only with this kind of strength that one’s Divine Sense would be able to break free of the bonds of the world and see beyond its borders.
