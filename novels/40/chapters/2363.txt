On the island, Yao Chang Jun’s body suddenly disappeared. When he reappeared, he was already in front of Yang Kai who was thrown backwards from the hit, sticking to him like maggots on rotting bones.

He coldly snorted and grabbed at Yang Kai without much care, “If you had cooperated with this Old Master earlier, then this Old Master might still have let you live!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

His words implied that it was already too late for Yang Kai to beg for mercy.

After the sneak attack he suffered from Yang Kai, Yao Chang Jun had borne a grudge against him and regarded it as a great shame. How could he let Yang Kai off so easily now?

“Bullies are destined to have a terrible end. You’ve forced my hand!” Yang Kai shouted through gritted teeth. He didn’t dodge Yao Chang Jun’s grab and instead formed an extremely strange seal with his hands.

As soon as he completed this seal, the trepidation that Yao Chang Jun was feeling before suddenly reappeared. Alarmed, his face suddenly changed and he didn’t dare to have the slightest hesitation, accelerating the movements of his hands as he grabbed towards Yang Kai’s shoulder.

Right at that moment, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly turned calm. Eyes cold, he shouted, “Seal of Darkness, unlock!”

“Seal of Darkness? What the hell is that?” Yao Chang Jun was bewildered. He couldn’t understand what Yang Kai was saying at all, but in the next instant, his face changed dramatically as if he had been struck by lightning, his eyes widening as if he had just seen a ghost in broad daylight while crying out strangely and backing away.

*Hong...*

A loud noise erupted as an indescribable aura suddenly burst out from Yang Kai’s dantian. This aura was filled with an extremely dark and malevolent feeling, as if the most brutal and fierce negative aura had been gathered into one place. It was so strong that Yao Chang Jun couldn’t help but feel lost, body trembling all over.

The dark aura was diffusing like a solid substance, instantly enveloping Yang Kai, and seemed to possess a life of its own, flowing around incessantly. A mysterious and profound set of patterns began appearing on Yang Kai’s skin.

Yang Kai’s aura was steadily climbing up.

Heaven and Earth trembled, the world collapsed, and the universe turned upside down. A power that seemed to be able to destroy the Heavens and shatter the Earth burst out in all directions.

In just a few moments, Yang Kai disappeared, leaving behind only a dark figure in his place. The darkness seemed to swallow everything, even light. Only a pair of crimson eyes were visible, filled with bloody killing intent.

“De-Demon Qi!” Yao Chang Jun’s teeth were chattering and he almost bit his own tongue. He stared in disbelief at the sight before him. With his knowledge and experience, he could naturally see at a glance that the aura lingering around Yang Kai was Demon Qi, and not just any Demon Qi at that, but the purest, Ancient Demon Qi!

“How can this be?” Yao Chang Jun could not believe his eyes. To think that he would be able to set his eyes on Ancient Demon Qi in his lifetime, and it even came from a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Junior.

Ancient Demon Qi had the special properties of being extremely corrosive and infectious. If a Third-Order Emperor Realm cultivator like him were to be enveloped by this Ancient Demon Qi, he would definitely lose his mind in a short time and become a demon.

How could Yang Kai keep his sanity in such a state? How was he able to store such a terrifying Demon Qi inside his own body?

Remembering Yang Kai’s words from just now, Yao Chang Jun suddenly realized that this little brat had used some unknown means to seal this Demon Qi into his own body, and he would be able to unseal it when he needed to use it against his enemies.

But it would be much more difficult to seal the Demon Qi again. Wasn’t he afraid that the Demon Qi would devour his consciousness and turn him into a demon? No wonder this little brat was repeatedly telling him not to force his hand. It turned out he really did have the means to fight with him. Even though it felt like Yang Kai was playing tricks on him before, it now seemed he did have the liberty to talk big like that.

Yao Chang Jun felt extremely chagrined. If he had known this would happen, then he would not have used such aggressive words against Yang Kai. Right now, with the Demon Qi wrapped around this boy’s body, it was impossible to tell if the little brat still retained his sanity. The surging demonic energy and the frightening pressure wasn’t something Yao Chang Jun felt like fighting at all.

After carefully observing Yang Kai’s eyes, he realized that though they were red and bloodthirsty, there didn’t seem to be any sort of a struggle. Yao Chang Jun quickly said, “Little brother, wait! This Old Master has something to say!”

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai glanced at him indifferently, “Anything you say is just a fart to me!”

Yao Chang Jun was furious!

If Yang Kai dared talk to him like this before, then he would have slapped him across the face, but now, Yang Kai had the liberty to speak disrespectfully to him.

There was a deep bitterness in Yao Chang Jun’s heart as he realized the source of his previous unease.

“It seems to have grown stronger...” Yang Kai clenched both his fists tightly, vaguely sensing his current situation. However, this increase in strength didn’t make him happy, but worried instead. That was because after unlocking the gold and silver seal of the Firmament Tree and releasing the Ancient Demon’s Demon Qi, Yang Kai could feel the demonic influence was even more potent than last time.

This was not because of his own strength was improving, but rather because his body had become more compatible with this Demon Qi.

Last time, he was only a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, and after transforming, Yang Kai had fought a big battle with three First-Order Emperor Realm Masters, managing to escape safely in the end. This time though, Yang Kai felt even stronger after the demonic transformation.

This worried Yang Kai a little, because the greater the increase in strength after the demonization, the more difficult it would be to seal this Demon Qi up again. If it couldn’t be sealed completely, then Yang Kai really would be reduced to a Demon, losing his consciousness, damning himself for all eternity.

Yao Chang Jun had no idea that Yang Kai was worried about this, however, and when he heard him say that the Demon Qi had grown stronger, he even thought that the little brat was showing off and immediately got angry, “Boy, grievances should be resolved rather than settled. Both you and I are in trouble here so why fight and kill each other? Isn’t it better to find a way out together? What’s more, your current state is strong, but you may not necessarily be able to kill this Old Master. This Old Master isn’t made of clay after all.”

Yang Kai looked at him with cold eyes and snorted, “If you were able to exert the true power of a Third-Order Emperor, this Young Master would indeed be unable to kill you, but with the handicap of your damaged Soul, you still dare to flap your tongue in front of me?”

“Han... Handicap?” Yao Chang Jun’s eyes were almost bulging out of his face. He was extremely angry and ashamed. Nobody had ever dared speak to him like that.

Yang Kai said, “This Young Master doesn’t have much time, so I’ll end your life in three moves!”

“Preposterous! This Old Master wants to see you try!” Yao Chang Jun was shaking from anger. He felt that he had been looked down upon and a surge of pride rose up in his heart. He thought to himself that he definitely had to teach this little brat a lesson and show him that even an old dog had sharp teeth left to bite.

As soon as he finished that thought, Yang Kai suddenly narrowed his eyes and recited under his breath, “Black Eye Purgatory, Infinite Darkness!”

As soon as those words came out, the entire world suddenly turned incomparably dark. Not a single shred of light could be seen. No matter where Yao Chang Jun turned, he was unable to see anything, as if he were blind. Not only was he blind, but even the keen perception he had as a Third-Order Emperor was being suppressed to the limit.

It was impossible for him to have gone blind without a reason, nor was it possible for the world to suddenly turn dark. The only explanation would be that Yang Kai had just performed some sort of Heaven-defying technique.

Recalling the strange black glow coming from Yang Kai’s right eye just now, Yao Chang Jun cried out, “Pupil Technique!”

As soon as he said that, he was drenched in a cold sweat. That was because he realized that his voice was not being projected at all. The world he was in seemed to have deprived him of all his senses. He was unable to speak or see, shooting a sense of fear into him as if he were falling into an endless abyss.

The only thing he could vaguely sense was something floating above his head. When he looked up in alarm, though, and saw what it was, Yao Chang Jun froze.

There, in the dark and boundless sky, a huge eye had stretched across the void, staring coldly and emotionlessly at him.

That eye was like the eye of Heaven. Yao Chang Jun felt insignificant under the gaze of that enormous eye and his heart sank. He felt like all those countless years of hard work cultivating were for nought, and he was nothing more than a pile of withering bones in the end before this eye.

When those thoughts surfaced, Yao Chang Jun’s aura began to drop as an indescribable Death Qi haunted his person.

At that moment, a stream of light suddenly shot out from the huge eye, forming the shape of a long sabre.

Emperor Artifact, Soul Splitting Sabre!

After being refined by Yang Kai, he could control the Soul Splitting Sabre at will now. Even though Yang Kai couldn’t bring out the full might of the Soul Splitting Sabre with his normal cultivation, in his demonized state, he was no less powerful than a Third-Order Emperor, so the Soul Splitting Sabre’s current power was astonishing.

Moreover, in order to finish off Yao Chang Jun quickly, Yang Kai had even used the Secret Technique, Heaven Severing Slash.

The Heaven Severing Slash was a Soul Secret Technique that he learned from Tian Yan in the Divine Ascension Mirror World. During ordinary days, Yang Kai would nourish and refine the Soul Splitting Sabre with his Spiritual Energy, saving up strength in it so that when he faced an enemy, the first strike of the Soul Splitting Sabre, the Heaven Severing Slash, would be extremely powerful.

But that was only limited to the first strike.

A Soul Emperor Artifact used together with a Soul Secret Technique. Even if Yao Chang Jun was uninjured, he may still not be able to take it, let alone when his Soul was already wounded.

The blade slashed down viciously into Yao Chang Jun’s Knowledge Sea, tearing a huge hole into it as if it were crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood.

Yao Chang Jun’s Knowledge Sea was already very badly damaged to begin with, so now that Yang Kai struck it so ferociously, it caused this Third-Order Emperor’s Knowledge Sea to all but collapse.

An intense pain came over Yao Chang Jun, causing him to wake up from his despair. He cried out in pain and a Five-Coloured Spear suddenly appeared in his hands, shining brightly and emitting the energy fluctuations of an Emperor Artifact with terrifying power.

It wasn’t surprising for Yao Chang Jun to have an Emperor Artifact as a Third-Order Emperor. It would actually be strange if he didn’t possess such a weapon.

As he cried out in pain, Yao Chang Jun poured his Emperor Qi madly into the Five-Coloured Spear. The spear buzzed and suddenly trembled in his hand before disappearing without a trace.

In the next moment, the giant eye in the sky was pierced through by the spear. At once, the darkness sealing off Heaven and Earth was shattered.

Like the last struggle of a trapped beast, Yao Chang Jun burst out with terrifying power and broke the Secret Technique of the dark world. This Secret Technique was unique to the Ancient Demon Race and not something Yang Kai could obtain through cultivation. He could only perform it while in his demonized form.

A rift was torn through the sky by the Five-Coloured Spear that stayed open for a long time.

“Little brat, you dare to hurt me? This Old Master will kill you!” Yao Chang Jun howled in rage, but as his Knowledge Sea was about to collapse, his entire body was trembling constantly, his face twitching as his Emperor Qi became extremely unstable.
