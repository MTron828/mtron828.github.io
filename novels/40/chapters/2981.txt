Zhu Lie rebuffed with a look of contempt, “What a load of crap! How come this Dragon has never heard of it? I may not know about his abilities but how dare he confer himself as a God? How shameless of him!”

The moment these comments left his mouth, he had poked a hornet’s nest. All the Demon Kings angrily glared at Zhu Lie; obviously, they had been extremely furious at his blatant disrespect of Great Demon God.

Even the Charm Demon, who had been acting sheepishly and cautiously, turned serious and stated, grinding her teeth, “Sir, please choose your words carefully!”

Zhu Lie glanced at her and indifferently stated, “This Dragon has always spoken his mind, why would I need to choose my words!?”

His indifferent gaze immediately brought the Charm Demon to her senses and her face turned incomparably pale. She was at a loss; she regretted her impulsiveness and lightly bit her lips, not daring to speak another word.

Another Demon King stepped up at that time and stated in a heavy voice, “Your Excellency’s cultivation is high and you have fearsome methods in your arsenal. We are indeed not your opponent, but if Your Excellency deliberately humiliates us, then we will fight. We are not afraid of dying. Great Demon God is inviolable.”

Just as he proclaimed this, all the Demon Kings stepped forward in unison. Each and every one of them had a cold look on their faces, giving the impression that they were prepared to battle Zhu Lie at a moment’s notice.

The Charm Demon hesitated for a moment before she too took a step forward despite turning even paler. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Oh?” Zhu Lie’s mouth curled into a cold smile, “Do you think that you trash can fight against this Dragon?”

Slight traces of murderous intent slowly started to leak from Zhu Lie as his Dragon Essence surged. He might need to sweat a little to kill all these Demon Kings, but he could definitely do it. Not just anyone could take on the anger of an Eighth-Order Red Dragon. Even a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master might have a hard time dealing with a furious Great Dragon.

The fate of the best Demon King of Demon Fury City was a prime example.

Zhu Lie didn’t place any importance on these Demon Kings; he didn’t need to talk to them on an equal footing. As far as he was concerned, Demon Fury City was just a slightly bigger ant hill, one he could walk past if he was in a good mood, or kicked away if he was in a bad one. And now, when these ants actually started defying him on their own, only blood and death could calm his fury.

His murderous intent swept around like a tide, creating a tense atmosphere; everyone was ready to confront each other.

“The Great Demon God… is truly strong!” Yang Kai stated in a light but reverberating voice.

Zhu Lie looked at him, furrowing his brow. He was wondering why Yang Kai suddenly said this. Speaking of which, although he looked at Yang Kai with undisguised displeasure, he also felt that he couldn’t beat Yang Kai because of the bloodline suppression. He had no choice but to admit that Yang Kai indeed had some ability.

With just a First-Order Emperor Realm cultivation, he could display strength no worse than a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master. Not many people in the entire Star Boundary possessed such a robust foundation.

So, Zhu Lie still paid a little attention to his words.

Many Demon Kings were also taken aback and their gazes and expressions when looking at Yang Kai grew softer. Everyone thought that this Human was a hundred times more pleasing to the eyes than the red-haired young man.

Yang Kai smiled at Zhu Lie, “There are many powerful heroes in this vast universe. Although the Divine Spirits stood at the apex of this myriad worlds, there is always something or someone that exists beyond your imagination. And all we can do is strive to catch up; catch up to them, surpass them, and become the ones they must strive to catch up to someday.”

Zhu Lie was startled and snarled, “Are you teaching me?”

Although he admitted that Yang Kai’s words were reasonable, the arrogance rooted in his bones made it impossible for him to agree with him. In the eyes of the Dragon Clan, they were the strongest, standing high above everyone and everything. All creatures could only look up to them, so the way Yang Kai spoke as if that was untrue displeased him even more so.

“Boy, you are quite arrogant!” Yang Kai chuckled before turning his gaze away from the furious Zhu Lie and to the Charm Demon, “I called you over for just one thing.”

“I wonder what Sir wants to know?” The Charm Demon asked in a seductive voice.

Just now, Yang Kai’s act of rectifying the Great Demon God’s name had made a good impression on her. She was no longer as fearful as before, and the same was true for the other Demon Kings.

“Tell me about the Abyssal Returner,” Yang Kai indifferently asked.

“What!?”

“Abyssal… Returner!”

“The Beast of Destruction!”

“How did you come to know about the Abyssal Returner?”

The faces of the Demon Kings changed as they broke into an uproar as if they had heard something terrifying. Yang Kai immediately let out a cold snort, which instantly shut them up. Nevertheless, they kept exchanging glances with each other, seemingly shocked in their hearts.

The Charm Demon nervously gulped and asked, “Sir, I wonder why are you asking about this?”

“What do you mean why? I’m raising an Abyssal Returner, so I wanted to know about it. Isn’t the Abyssal Returner an Exotic Beast of the Demon Realm? Naturally, I would come to you to inquire about it.”

“R-R-Raising an A-A-Abyssal Returner?” The Charm Demon’s face lost all its colour as she somehow forced a smile and continued, “Sir, you must be joking, right? How could you be raising that Exotic Beast?”

A shadow of a smile slowly seemed to have appeared on the faces of some of the Demon Kings. Obviously, they didn’t believe Yang Kai one bit. They felt that he was just shamelessly boasting; after all, it was too unbelievable. How could an Abyssal Returner that was born to destroy the world be raised by a Human? If that was really the case, he would have long been devoured by it. How could he be standing here, chatting casually?

“You think I’m joking?” Yang Kai looked at the Charm Demon with a serious look on his face.

The Charm Demon withdrew her smile and slowly shook her head.

“Then don’t ask such naive questions.”

The Charm Demon gave a light cough as she secretly thought in her heart, [This guy must have mistaken some strange Monster Beast for an Abyssal Returner.] But seeing the serious look on his face, she didn’t dare to raise such a point. Instead, all she could do was go along with him and reply, “Sir, what do you want to ask?”

“Tell me whatever you know!” Yang Kai rested his one hand on the stone table while pointing at the Demon Kings with another before speaking to the Charm Demon, “Starting from you, everyone will tell me one thing about the Abyssal Returner, and if anyone doesn’t give me something or his answer dissatisfies me, there will be consequences.”

The Charm Demon jumped back in fright, “Sir, what are the consequences?”

Yang Kai replied, “I haven’t thought about them but it would certainly not be good.” A slightly cold smile emerged on his lips as a sliver of murderous intent timely reared its head before receding, terrifying the Demon Kings. They knew that Yang Kai was being serious. He indeed wanted to know about the Abyssal Returner.

They really couldn’t fathom why though as although the Abyssal Returner had quite the notoriety, it had long been destroyed. Furthermore, the Abyssal Returner was an Exotic Beast of the Demon Realm, so why was a Human trying to learn about it? None of them dared to ask any question though and turned their gazes to the Charm Demon.

The Charm Demon felt a bitter taste in her mouth, but she had no choice but to go along Yang Kai’s whims. So, she thought for a while before replying, “The Abyssal Returner is also known as Beast of Destruction. It is a legendary creature in our Demon Realm, and not in a good way. The reason why it has such a title is because it represents destruction itself. Wherever it goes, nothing but an empty abyss and destruction remains.”

After speaking, she vigilantly looked at Yang Kai, who lightly furrowed his brow. Although he was a little dissatisfied with such general information, he didn’t care about it too much and just waved his hand, indicating a pass.

The Charm Demon breathed a sigh of relief before turning her head towards another Demon King.

Obviously, this Demon King had already thought about it and immediately started speaking, “Legend has it that the Abyssal Returner was born from the primordial chaos itself. Although it has a body of flesh and blood, it has no source or root. No one knows how it was truly born, but it seemed to have existed since the Demon Realm was formed.”

Yang Kai gently nodded.

The speaking Demon King took the hint and looked to another Demon King.

The third Demon King added, “I only know that there seems to be a strange space inside the Abyssal Returner that can swallow and contain anything and everything.”

“Because the Abyssal Returner was an Exotic Beast of the Demon Realm, it was particularly attracted to Demon Qi. It seems to grow stronger by devouring Demon Qi.”

“Yes, rumour has it that the Abyssal Returner wasn’t very strong when it was born. Although it showed peculiar abilities, our Demon Race didn’t pay that much importance to it until it slowly matured, whereupon it finally attracted the attention of the Masters of the Demon Realm. But unfortunately, it was too late by then.”

“Back then, the Abyssal Returner ran rampant. It devoured countless Demons and razed countless cities to the ground. Even Demon Saints were swallowed by it. Finally, my Demon Race stood united to resist it and finally killed it after paying a very heavy price.”

“The Abyssal Returner was so tenacious that it is said it did not actually die and instead retreated into the chaos after faking its death, waiting for the day it would stage a comeback.”

“…”

One after another, pieces of information about the Abyssal Returner left the mouths of the Demon Kings. Although they had been trapped in the Revolving World for hundreds of thousands of years, some of the information about the Demon Realm was still passed down from generation to generation. As for the Abyssal Returner, it was known as the Beast of Destruction and was a legend unto itself, so even if most of the facts had been distorted by time and rumours, they were all extremely good pieces of information.

Some Demon Kings knew nothing about the Abyssal Returner, or the things they knew had already been spoken by others, but other Demon Kings would secretly relay some information to them, which would allow them to pass Yang Kai’s test.

After two or three rounds, the Demon Kings couldn’t think of anything more no matter how much they racked their brains, but seeing that Yang Kai had no intention of stopping, they couldn’t help but feel a little bitter. They now thought that Yang Kai was deliberately making things difficult for them; why else would he ask about the Abyssal Returner and nothing else?

After another Demon King gave what information he knew, the next one wiped the cold sweat from his forehead. He thought hard for a very long time but couldn’t think of anything.

Yang Kai raised his head and asked, “Nothing else?”

The Demon King bitterly shook his head.

The Charm Demon hurriedly intervened, “Sir, we have told you everything we know. We have not concealed anything.”

“En, I know.” Yang Kai nodded, “I believe what you said just now is true, but there is one point that interests me in particular.”

“I don’t know what Sir is referring to?”

“Can the Abyssal Returner become stronger if it devours all of you?”

“U… us?” The Charm Demon nervously gulped, her lips quivering before she haltingly replied, “Possibly…”

“I wonder …” Yang Kai smilingly looked at her, “If it swallowed all of you Demon Kings, its speed of growth should be very quick, right?”

“Aha… ha… probably,” the Charm Demon forced out a laugh. Although she didn’t think that an Abyssal Returner would really appear to swallow them, it still sent chills down her back to talk about this. She felt as if a bloody mouth was biting toward her and would swallow her down at any moment.
