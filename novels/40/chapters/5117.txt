Having prompted Yang Kai, her small body staggered forward.

Yang Kai immediately reached out to support her.

“I’m a bit tired…” The little girl rubbed her eyes with her white, small and chubby baby hand, yawning, “Hurry back to the Pass, and be careful on the way.”

Saying so, she closed her eyes.

Yang Kai called out to her twice but didn’t receive any response. After he carefully examined the little girl in front of him, he found that she had really fallen asleep.

He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He was left with no choice but to pick up the little girl by the waist and make a beeline towards Yin-Yang Pass.

He might not have played a big role in the last battle, but he was still injured by Mie Qiong while he was holding him back. However, this kind of injury wasn’t a big problem for Yang Kai; even if he didn’t take rest, he could still recover.

He looked down at the little girl in his arms, who was curled up and sound asleep, and couldn’t help noticing her extremely pale complexion.

No one would have ever thought that such a small girl would be able to kill three Territory Lords in an instant. Her tiny body actually carried within it the apex strength of the Human Race.

When Yang Kai first met her, he had only felt the aura of an Origin King Realm cultivator from her. At that time, he could not help but wonder how such a little girl could exist in Yin-Yang Pass. She had lied to him at the time, claiming to have been born in Yin-Yang Pass, and Yang Kai believed her.

But at this moment, Yang Kai could not even feel the slightest trace of a cultivator’s aura from her. She was like an ordinary mortal now.

Yang Kai had never encountered such a situation before but he suspected that it had something to do with the Old Ancestor’s Secret Art. Perhaps when she was seriously injured, she would return to her youth to recover.

He tried to place the little girl in his arms into his Small Universe, but he found that he was unable to do so. Even if the Old Ancestor was showing no signs of cultivation right now, her Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm foundation was still present, so his Small Universe was unable to contain her.

Since he couldn’t put her in his Small Universe, he could only remain on guard and try to avoid any conflicts with the Black Ink Clan along the way as he physically carried her.

Furthermore, Yang Kai did not dare to use Instantaneous Movement unless absolutely necessary. Firstly, it would consume too much of his energy. It would have been extremely convenient for him to use Instantaneous Movement if he was alone, but bringing someone along with him would increase his consumption several times over. Secondly, the Old Ancestor’s condition really was not good and Yang Kai had no idea if Instantaneous Movement would negatively affect her.

Fortunately, Yang Kai’s cultivation was not low and his speed was not slow. Even if he flew all the way back to Yin-Yang Pass, it would only take him a month or two. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Along the way, Yang Kai avoided the scattered Black Ink Clansmen and the journey remained uneventful for the time being.

Three days later, Yang Kai suddenly felt the small figure in his arms move.

Looking down, he saw the Old Ancestor rubbing her eyes and slowly waking up.

Yang Kai was overjoyed, “Old Ancestor, you’re awake?”

The Old Ancestor’s complexion was still pale, but it had improved compared to before, albeit only slightly.

The Old Ancestor let out a muffled groan as she shifted into a more comfortable position in Yang Kai’s embrace. Having done so, she indifferently asked, “Where are we?”

Yang Kai replied, “We’re still in the Black Ink Clan’s territory, about a month away from the Yin-Yang Pass.”

“So slow,” The Old Ancestor looked displeased.

Yang Kai suddenly felt a bit awkward, “Why don’t you sleep a little longer? Perhaps we’ll arrive the next time you wake up.”

The Old Ancestor deliberately widened her eyes, shaking her head, “I’m not tired, I’m not sleeping.”

Perhaps it was because it was uncomfortable in Yang Kai’s arms, her small body adjusted and changed to other positions a few times, but she was still not satisfied. Finally, she grabbed Yang Kai’s arm, flipped her body over, and straddled his neck, finally stopping.

Yang Kai suddenly felt uncomfortable.

It wouldn’t matter if a real seven- or eight-year-old little girl was riding on his shoulders, but the issue was that she wasn’t a little girl, she was the Old Ancestor of Yin-Yang Pass!

The high and mighty Old Ancestor was riding on his shoulders like this, putting him in an awkward position. It would be quite embarrassing if someone from Yin-Yang Pass saw this.

The Old Ancestor, on the other hand, seemed quite happy. Her two little legs dangling over Yang Kai’s chest rocked back and forth as she looked around with interest, as if she was enjoying the picturesque scenery.

However, there was naturally no picturesque scenery in the Black Ink Clan’s hinterland, so after staring for a while, the Old Ancestor grew bored and patted Yang Kai’s head, “I’m hungry!”

“Ah?” Yang Kai thought he misheard her.

“I’m hungry!” The little girl bent over and shouted in Yang Kai’s ear, “I want to eat some hot steamed stuffed buns!”

Yang Kai’s eyes widened in shock, “Where would I get steamed stuffed buns here?”

There were naturally no shops in this vast void. Yang Kai had a nagging feeling that the Old Ancestor’s temperament had greatly changed after turning into a kid.

“I don’t care, I want to eat steamed stuffed buns, right now, right this instant!” The little girl kept shouting, throwing a tantrum like a real child.

Yang Kai was just about to refuse her and say that he couldn’t do anything, but he suddenly remembered that while other Open Heaven Realm cultivators might not be able to accommodate this request, he was raising a large number of Humans in his Small Universe. He could get whatever he wanted from them!

Using his Divine Sense, he immediately found a steamed stuffed bun shop in a bustling city in his Small Universe.

The next moment, a tray of steamed stuffed buns appeared with a flip of his hand before he handed it to her, “Take it.”

The little girl immediately smiled happily. She grabbed a steamed stuffed bun and took a bite, but the next moment, she suddenly spat it out as a furrow appeared on her brow, “Yuck, this tastes like poop, I want to eat delicious steamed stuffed buns!”

Yang Kai immediately had a huge headache. He suddenly understood why those Seventh and Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in Yin-Yang Pass didn’t have the demeanour of Masters in the marketplace, and why each and every one of them was extremely unscrupulous with their business dealings.

The people of Yin-Yang Pass had to work hard in order to serve an Old Ancestor like her.

…..

Yang Kai’s Small Universe, inside the Main Conference Hall of Seven Stars Sect…

A meeting of the higher-ups was taking place.

Since the last time Yang Kai had borrowed the strength of the Emperor Realm Masters of Seven Stars Sect to kill Zhu Feng, they had gained some understanding of what was above the Emperor Realm.

Yang Kai also taught them the method to condense their Dao Seals and gave them some resources to cultivate with.

Recently, the higher-ups of the Seven Stars Sect had been working hard to break through to the Open Heaven Realm, but their aptitudes came up short. Even if they managed to break through to the Open Heaven Realm in the future, their Order would be extremely limited. They wouldn’t be of much help in the Black Ink Battlefield.

Only Miao Fei Ping had a chance of reaching the Sixth Order.

At this moment, the Emperor Realm Masters were discussing their own cultivation insights with the Sect Master, Shang Guan Ji, as the leader. Although Yang Kai had taught them the method to condense their Dao Seal, they naturally had many questions as they had never come into contact with such things before. They wanted to ask Yang Kai for some advice, but their Ancestor, Yang Kai, had always remained elusive. They were unable to find him, so left with no options, they could only try to learn by discussing with each other.

Just as everyone in the hall was locked in a heated discussion though, Shang Guan Ji suddenly jolted as he stood up straight as an attentive look appeared on his face, apparently listening to something.

His strange actions puzzled many of the higher-ups and they all focused their attention on him.

After a short while, Shang Guan Ji bowed and solemnly stated, “This Junior will obey!”

As soon as he said this, all of the Emperor Realm Masters present became excited. Elder Guan Qian Xing even asking, “Sect Master, does the Ancestor have any instructions?”

In the entire Void World, the only person who could make Shang Guan Ji act so respectfully was the Ancestor.

As he had expected, Shang Guan Ji solemnly nodded his affirmation, “Just now, the Ancestor issued a decree for my Seven Stars Sect to carry out!”

Guan Qian Xing and the others stood up together, perking up their ears!

Shang Guan Ji swept his eyes over the crowd and sonorously declared, “The Ancestor wants to eat steamed stuffed buns!”

Everyone was dumbstruck.

Guan Qian Xing thought he had heard wrong and skeptically asked, “Sect Master, what does the Ancestor want to do?”

Shang Guan Ji stared at him with a serious look on his face, reiterating, “The Ancestor wants to eat steamed stuffed buns, delicious steamed stuffed buns!”

Seven Stars Sect’s gears suddenly started fiercely turning as the Emperor Realm Masters flew about. The disciples below didn’t know what was happening and thought that something big had happened, but soon they found out that one of the Seven Stars Sect’s precious Spirit Beasts had been killed by Elder Guan Qian Xing.

The disciples were all shocked. It had to be known that Elder Guan Qian Xing had spent a great deal of effort to capture this Spirit Beast in the past. It was quite strong and intelligent. Coupled with its beautiful appearance, many of the disciples were quite fond of it. Although it had a bad temper and would occasionally injure others, when this Spirit Beast was killed, many of the female disciples broke into tears. They felt that Elder Guan Qian Xing was simply inhumane, [How could he kill such a beautiful Spirit Beast!? Rather than calling him Guan Qian Xing, we should just call him Butcher Guan…]

The disciples didn’t know why the Spirit Beast was killed, but the Elders did.

The Ancestor wanted to eat steamed stuffed buns, delicious steamed stuffed buns!

They didn’t know what kind of steamed stuffed buns the Ancestor would find delicious, so they could only try their best by using the top materials they could find.

The entire Seven Stars Sect had been mobilized, especially the disciples who were proficient in cooking.

In less than two hours, all kinds of steamed stuffed buns were served.

As soon as the steamer was opened, a basket of steamed stuffed buns strangely disappeared.

In the void, a profusely sweating Yang Kai handed the freshly baked steamed stuffed buns to the Old Ancestor, “Try this.”

The Old Ancestor took it and sniffed before gingerly taking a bite, “It’s acceptable.”

Yang Kai let out a long sigh.

The one hour before the steamed stuffed buns were prepared was definitely the most torturous hour of his life. He wouldn’t feel so tired even if he had to fight a Territory Lord one-on-one.

The tantrum-throwing Old Ancestor was simply a nightmare to deal with.

Fortunately, she had finally calmed down.

Sitting on his shoulders, the Old Ancestor was happily eating. She picked up a steamed stuffed bun and pushed it to Yang Kai’s mouth, “You eat one too.”

Yang Kai said, “I don’t need it…”

“Eat!” The Old Ancestor simply stuffed it into his mouth after throwing a word.

Yang Kai swallowed back his protests and obediently ate the bun.

The few steamed stuffed buns were quickly consumed as the two ate them one after another.

The Old Ancestor licked her little hand and casually muttered, “I also want to eat candied fruits!”

Yang Kai immediately felt as if he had been struck by lightning as a troubled look took over his face, “Old Ancestor, please wait a moment.”

In Seven Stars Sect, Shang Guan Ji stood up straight for a moment before suddenly turning to the Elders who were staring at him and speaking, “The Ancestor wants to eat candied fruits!”
