Inside the Qin Family Residence, Qin Zhao Yang rushed nervously to the back courtyard and his face turned solemn upon seeing the scene inside.

He saw a crowd gathered. Some were Eight Paths Sect disciples who were living in the Qin Residence, while the rest were the guards and servants of the Qin Family.

Although the people from Eight Paths Sect weren’t many, all of them had Dao Source Realm cultivations. On the other hand, the Qin Family guards, who were surrounding them, were actually just Origin Kings or even Origin Returning Realm cultivators.

Despite their inferior number, the Eight Paths Sect still held the absolute advantage in terms of strength.

A sense of heaviness could be felt within the atmosphere, and the air was vaguely filled with a trace of blood.

Qin Zhao Yang’s heavy and rapid steps alarmed everyone. The crowd of guards turned around and got excited when they saw him, “Old Ancestor!”

On the contrary, the faces of the Eight Paths Sect disciples, who were being surrounded in the centre, turned ugly.

Qin Zhao Yang gently nodded and walked straight ahead.

The crowd instantly made way, allowing him to walk unimpeded.

When Qin Zhao Yang reached the center and saw what was on the ground, his eyes narrowed and anger welled up inside him.

A female corpse, one that had died in a horrible manner, lay on the ground covered in blood. With just a glance, Qin Zhao Yang could recognize that she was a maidservant of the Qin Family. He did not expect that this maidservant who had served him a cup of tea just a few days ago, would now lie dead in front of him today. Her lifeless eyes were staring at him horrendously, as if crying out for justice.

He observed the corpse and soon determined that her chest had been crushed by a great impact, causing it to cave in. There were even pieces of her internal organs vomited out of the corner of her mouth.

Qin Zhao Yang’s emotions became worked up as he stared at this miserable scene, and the Source Qi in his body began to faintly tremble.

The disciples of Eight Paths Sect kept looking awkwardly at each other, but there was one particular young man, who had fair skin and a handsome appearance, who was the target of the most gazes.

“Who did this?” Qin Zhao Yang took a deep breath and broke the long period of silence. His tone seemed to be calm, but his slightly trembling voice revealed his inner unrest.

While speaking, he lifted his head and swept across the people of Eight Paths Sect with his eyes.

They did not dare to meet eyes with him and all moved their gazes aside.

“Anyone who knows, step out and speak. Don’t be afraid!” Qin Zhao Yang bellowed, looking at the guards and maidservants of his family.

One of the maidservants stepped out, biting her lips, her face pale, eyes swollen, as if she had not gotten over from the shocking scene. Suppressing her tears at this moment, she knelt down in front of Qin Zhao Yang with a puff, “Old Ancestor, Xiao Huan cannot rest in peace like this, please avenge her!”

“Stand up, tell me what happened.” Qin Zhao bent over and gave the maidservant a hand.

After the maidservant got up, she lifted her head and glanced at one of the disciples of Eight Paths Sect. Seeing that this man was also staring at her fiercely, her face turned pale in fright and she couldn’t help letting out a scream.

Qin Zhao Yang noticed this of course and laid his hand on the maidservant’s shoulder, infusing a stream of pure Source Qi into her in order to calm her fears before speaking softly, “With this Old Ancestor here, no one can touch you. Just speak the truth.”

“Yes!” The maidservant gently nodded and started to speak, “By the order of Old Ancestor, Xiao Huan and this servant have been taking care of all the Sir’s daily needs here with all our heart and dared not to slack even in the slightest. Today, we came here to bring refreshments to a certain Sir, but when we put down the platter and were about to leave, then... then...”

When she reached that part, she seemed to have recalled an unwanted memory and her tender body began to tremble, making it impossible for her to continue.

Qin Zhao Yang waited patiently for her as he continued using his Source Qi to support her.

After a while, the maidservant gradually calmed down and continued, “Then that Sir started to express his wicked intention, trying to force Xiao Huan and this servant to stay to serve him. We refused to do so and politely asked him to excuse us in every possible way. Then, all of a sudden, Xiao Huan let out a scream and was thrown across the courtyard. When this servant rushed to check on her, she was already... already...”

Qin Zhao Yang exerted a slight force with his hand and the maidservant passed out instantly. He then ordered a guard beside him, “Help her out and give her some rest.”

“Yes!” The guard carried the maidservant and rushed out of the courtyard.

Qin Zhao Yang turned to look at one of the rooms in the courtyard and saw the door of the room was broken, which was obviously caused by an impact. In combination with the maidservant’s statement, he deduced that the broken door must be the result of the other maidservant, Xiao Huan, being knocked out of the room.

“Who lives here?” Qin Zhao Yang pointed his finger to that room and cast a deadly serious gaze towards the Eight Paths Sect group.

Most of them looked away, with their eyes blinking, as if they knew the reason and felt embarrassed about it.

But a particular man, who seemed to become angry out of shame, raised his head proudly and yelled, “It was this Young Master, so what?”

As soon as he spoke, all of the Qin Family guards turned their gaze towards this man, as did Qin Zhao Yang.

This man was the previously mentioned disciple with fair skin and handsome appearance, a disciple of Eight Paths Sect.

Even under the watchful eyes of the crowd, this man showed not the slightest remorse and instead sneered, “What do you want to do? Before you act, you’d best weigh your own capabilities first!”

Pushing his Source Qi, he released a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation.

Qin Zhao Yang was forced to fall a few steps back and the guards were even worse off, all of them seemingly feeling like they were being crushed by a mountain, showing painful expressions on their faces as their bones cracked.

Although Qin Zhao Yang was suppressed by the opponent’s presence, he did not flinch at all. Instead, he circulated his own strength rapidly to forcefully regain his footing and questioned in a deep voice, “What are friend’s intentions here? Are you planning to destroy my Qin Family?”

“Of course that is not my meaning, don’t make baseless accusations!” The fair-skinned man shouted.

“Did you kill Xiao Huan?” Qin Zhao Yang asked with his teeth gritted.

The face of the white-skinned man suddenly became a bit awkward as he muttered, “It wasn’t intentional... she suddenly bit me and I... accidentally acted and wound up killing her. But look here, look at this wound! Just imagine how hard she must have bitten me!”

He rolled up his sleeves and there was indeed a fresh row of teeth marks on his skin.

“You killed her just because of this?” Qin Zhao Yang hastily took a few steps forward, his clothes flapping along with his movement.

Even though the fair-skinned man’s cultivation was higher than Qin Zhao Yang’s, seeing the old man charging at him like a mad bull, he actually felt slightly intimidated and kept retreating, continuing to give excuses, “I already said I didn’t mean it, what else do you want from me? You are a cultivator too, surely you should know that little accidents like this happen sometimes.”

“Indeed, this old master is a proud cultivator, but this old master has never used his strength to attack an ordinary mortal who possesses no cultivation at all, much less accidentally killed such a person!” Qin Zhao Yang was infuriated.

“Stubborn old dog...” The white-skinned man became angry as well as snapped, “Seems I can’t reason with you.”

“Hahaha...” A sound of laughter suddenly interfered with the scene as a middle-aged man stepped forward and cupped his fist towards Qin Zhao Yang, “Patriarch Qin, can we discuss this somewhere else?”

“If you have anything to say, say it here,” Qin Zhao Yang coldly rejected.

The middle-aged man showed a smile of embarrassment on his face as he stared at Qin Zhao Yang, but deep down inside he was secretly cursing him for not knowing how to appreciate kindness.

He knew that he had to be careful with Qin Zhao Yang now though, so after pondering for a while, he continued, “Patriarch Qin, it was indeed my Junior Brother Lin Yun’s fault for accidentally killing the maidservant of your noble family, and he is extremely regretful about what has happened, so Patriarch Qin, please have mercy on him and let these small matters be made small, shall we?”

“Extremely regretful?” Qin Zhao Yang squinted at the man named Lin Yun and sneered, “Has this old master gone blind perhaps? How come this old master cannot see the slightest regret from him at all?”

The middle-aged man instantly cast his eyes towards Lin Yun. Lin Yun muttered a few words in dissatisfaction, but still reluctantly lowered his head, looking demoralized.

“Patriarch Qin, the dead cannot be restored to life, so you cannot be thinking of asking my Junior Brother Lin Yun to pay for this with his life, right?” The middle-aged man smiled.

“I dare him!” Lin Yun suddenly lifted his head again and snapped.

“You shut up!” The middle-aged man glared at Lin Yun furiously, this time forcing Lin Yun to behave slightly.

The middle-aged man looked back at Qin Zhao Yang, and whispered, “Patriarch Qin, I will tell you the truth. My Junior Brother Lin is usually not an arrogant or domineering person, he is just a bit obsessed with women, which I am sad to say has led to this unfortunate accident. These days, while staying here, he has been behaving himself well, but all of a sudden he seems to have lost his self-control. I am truly speechless about this. The Vice Sect Master has been spoiling him in the Sect, but honestly, even we could not tolerate his temper sometimes. Patriarch Qin, please do not pay his indiscretion any mind.”

“Vice Sect Master?” Qin Zhao Yang narrowed his eyes.

“En, Vice Sect Master Lin Rui is his uncle,” the middle-aged man explained with a faint smile.

Qin Zhao Yang understood his intention.

Lin Yun had someone backing him. However, even if he did not, no one in the Qin Family could do anything to him with his Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation.

Now that it was apparent that this Lin Yun had such a strong backer, Qin Zhao Yang understood that it would be impossible to have the former pay for his crime with his life.

The Qin Family could not risk provoking Eight Paths Sect as even though they were not a big Sect, they were still a hundred times stronger than the Qin Family.

Thinking so, Qin Zhao Yang could not help feeling downhearted and lost.

A maidservant from his family was beaten to death in his own home, but even as the Old Ancestor, he was unable to do anything to punish the murderer. This feeling of helplessness troubled his heart.

“Why bother with so much nonsense?” Lin Yun seemed to become impatient and shouted, “Wasn’t it just a maidservant? Can’t we just settle this matter with some compensation? Is a hundred thousand Source Crystals good enough for you? No? Then how about two hundred thousand! For a small family like yours, two hundred thousand Source Crystals is a huge sum of money, enough to spend for several years! Accept my offer or face the consequences!”

There was not even a slight trace of regret on his contemptuous face, as if the maidservant on the ground wasn’t even killed by him.

Hearing this, the middle-aged man did not make any attempt to stop him. Obviously, he had the same thought. It would be best if they could settle the issue like this. If not, he would not mind shedding all the pretence of cordiality and using threats to ensure this matter did not spread out later.

On the opposite side, Qin Zhao Yang, who looked lost earlier, immediately became enraged.

The middle-aged man hurriedly cut in, “Don’t lose your temper, Patriarch Qin. Although my Junior Brother Lin Yun’s words are a bit crass, they are not unreasonable.”
