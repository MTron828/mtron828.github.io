Zi Long really could not stand seeing Yang Kai’s shameless antics anymore, so he decisively closed his eyes to not allow the scenes taking place less than a thousand meters away to disturb his mind.

However, Yang Kai had no intention of letting things end here.

His voice continued to flow into Zi Long’s ears, “Oh, why is this Enlightenment Flower not as big as the first two? The petals are a little thin and wilted as well. It must have been malnourished. The medicinal efficacies of this one are definitely not as good, but... well, it’s better than nothing. I might as well collect it.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Zi Long’s body shook slightly as his Saint Qi almost burst out involuntarily.

On the other side, Xu Wei’s forehead was also covered with bulging veins, an obvious sign of how irritated he was by Yang Kai.

But instead of closing his eyes like Zi Long, he stared stubbornly at Yang Kai’s movements, praying that Yang Kai would at least leave some soup for him to drink after Yang Kai ate this large piece of meat.

It was not long though until he noticed something wrong.

This little brat was simply too vicious. When collecting the Enlightenment Flowers, he was pulling them out roots and all, leaving nothing behind.

Xu Wei sighed in exasperation, knowing that no part of these five Enlightenment Flowers were destined to belong to him. Taking a hard breath, he followed Zi Long’s lead and closed his eyes.

“Ah!” Yang Kai suddenly cried out, as if he had discovered something astonishing, his voice filled with surprise and excitement.

Xu Wei, who had just closed his eyes, opened them again as he stared over towards Yang Kai, trying to figure out what had just happened.

Even Zi Long could not hold back his curiosity and opened his eyes slightly...

But the sight that greeted them was just Yang Kai laughing happily as he put the third Enlightenment Flower into a jade box as he muttered to himself, “That was close, I almost put it into the wrong box and wasted its medicinal efficacies.”

Xu Wei opened his mouth as if he wanted to scream, but he somehow held his tongue in the end and just cast his cold glare to the side.

Next, the fourth flower, then the fifth flower...

Yang Kai acted like a complete countryside hick who had never seen the world before, shouting and cheering about every little detail as he picked the Enlightenment Flowers one by one. The elaborate praises and long, drawn-out descriptions sounded like the most grating screeches in Xu Wei and Zi Long’s ears.

Those words were like sharp sticks poking their hearts, making both of them feel incredibly uncomfortable.

After Yang Kai finished collecting all five Enlightenment Flowers, Xu Wei and Zi Long actually couldn’t help letting out sighs of relief, inexplicably feeling like some kind of torture had finally ended...

At that moment, it seemed like the world itself had become a lot brighter.

“A good harvest indeed!” Yang Kai patted his Space Ring and smiled.

Xu Wei grinned wickedly hearing this and quipped, “You should wait until you carry those things off before celebrating.”

Although he knew Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space and could even teleport a thousand meters in an instant, Yang Kai was still just an Origin Realm cultivator. He and Zi Long were both Origin Kings, so there was a massive gap in strength between them. Xu Wei would not let Yang Kai leave here easily, and he was certain Zi Long wouldn’t either.

When the Seven Coloured Radiant Light dissipated, both he and Zi Long would immediately attack Yang Kai!

Only at that time could it really be determined who the Enlightenment Flowers would belong to.

Right now... This little brat was only holding onto them, he did not own them yet.

“Carry them off? Just wait and see,” Yang Kai replied lightly, not showing the slightest worry about the coming crisis. Immediately, he straightened himself up and turned his attention to a spot not far away and declared loudly, “En, those Seeking Heart Lotuses are also good things, I can’t just ignore them.”

Yang Kai did not know what was special about this particular area to not only have so many Void Cracks but also to nurture so many rare and precious herbs.

When the three parties entered a stalemate just now, all of them had already noticed this peculiarity and taken note of the Seeking Heart Lotuses and Heavenly Infant Grass which also grew here in addition to the Enlightenment Flowers.

Seeking Heart Lotuses could be used to steady the mental state of a cultivator and hone their state of mind, while the Heavenly Infant Grass was one of the main ingredients in the Origin King Pill. Taking an Origin King Pill could increase the chance of one successfully breaking through to the Origin King Realm. It was an incredibly valuable pill.

However, among these three precious herbs, the Enlightenment Flowers were undoubtedly the most valuable, so everyone’s attention had been focused on them before and not much focus had been placed on the Seeking Heart Lotuses and Heavenly Infant Grass.

But now that the Enlightenment Flowers had entered Yang Kai’s pocket, the targets of everyone’s attention naturally shifted.

Fortunately, the Seeking Heart Lotuses, like the Enlightenment Flowers, were growing behind a certain Void Crack, so it was not currently covered by the Seven Coloured Radiant Light. Only the Heavenly Infant Grass was now submerged in the seven coloured tide.

When Yang Kai spoke these words, Xu Wei’s heart could not help clenching.

It seemed the Seeking Heart Lotuses would not be able to escape this little brat’s poisonous hands! Realizing this, Xu Wei’s face went dark.

The situation played out exactly as Xu Wei feared. After Yang Kai finished speaking, he pushed his Space Force and directly arrived at the spot where the Seeking Heart Lotuses were growing.

Just like when he appeared next to the Enlightenment Flowers, Yang Kai leapt over the barrier of space, moving a few dozen meters in an instant.

Zi Long has been staring at Yang Kai, seemingly wanting to discover some clues about how he was moving, but he quickly gave up as he realized the Dao of Space was simply too elusive for him, making it impossible for him to tell how Yang Kai moved.

Zi Long only felt a strange force enveloping Yang Kai before the latter disappeared. By the time Yang Kai reappeared, that strange force had disappeared.

[Has Space Force always been this unfathomable?] Zi Long frowned deeply as a feeling of weakness gripped his heart.

However, his determination to kill Yang Kai was stronger than ever. Without even mentioning the fact that he would be a heart demon for Zi Long’s son as long as this boy lived, just this brief interaction had forged a deep grudge between them. If this boy really grew up and broke through to the Origin King Realm, he would certainly pose a great risk to Purple Star.

An Origin King who was proficient in Space Force, how terrible would that be? Zi Long could not even imagine it.

This danger had to be nipped in the bud!

“Hello.”

While Zi Long was lost in thought, Yang Kai actually called out to taunt him and Zi Dong with a grin.

The Seeking Heart Lotuses were only forty meters away from where Zi Long and Zi Dong were standing, so Yang Kai was relatively close at the moment.

“Boy, act rampantly all you’d like for now. This Young Master will definitely torture you brutally in a moment,” Zi Dong glared at Yang Kai and ground his teeth.

After being humiliated so many times by Yang Kai, he seemed to completely lose his ability to think and could only keep mouthing off, putting his own powerlessness on display.

“Haha!” After Yang Kai let out a burst of grating laughter, he ignored Zi Dong entirely and squatted down to carefully collect the Seeking Heart Lotuses.

What made Zi Long and Xu Wei breathe a sigh of relief secretly at the same time though was that Yang Kai did not continue his harassment this time and simply completed the harvesting process in silence.

It seemed that as time passed, this little brat was gradually beginning to feel uneasy! This was the assumption these two made.

Shortly after, the few Seeking Heart Lotuses were properly preserved by Yang Kai and stored in his Space Ring.

“Haha, giving up on the Heavenly Infant Grass, Kid?” Xu Wei stood in the distance and laughed. He had been irritated by Yang Kai just now and finally found a way to hit back, so he was not going to pass up the opportunity. Staring at Yang Kai triumphantly, he mocked, “Is that all there is to your skill, boy? If you have the ability, why not pick those Heavenly Infant Grass as well?”

Whether it was the Enlightenment Flowers or the Seeking Heart Lotuses, both were growing in spots that weren’t covered by the Seven Coloured Radiant Light, so Yang Kai was able to use his Space Secret Technique to easily collect them.

But the Heavenly Infant Grasses were different and were currently completely shrouded in Seven Coloured Radiant Light. Even if Yang Kai had astonishing talent, he should not be able to collect these spirit grasses.

Xu Wei’s provocation was obviously just trying to annoy Yang Kai as a way of soothing his own hatred.

Zi Long smiled faintly and joined in, “Why must Brother Xu embarrass this boy now? How could he possibly achieve such a feat?”

“If he can do it, this Young Master will immediately waste his meridians!” Zi Dong was even more arrogant and boldly declared.

Hearing what he said, Zi Long could not help frowning. He secretly felt that his idiot son was looking for trouble for no reason. Mocking and ridiculing Yang Kai was one thing, but going so far as to say he’d waste his own meridians just to make a point was highly improper.

Such words should never be spoken so casually.

But... Zi Long did not reprimand him, because Yang Kai was truly incapable of collecting the Heavenly Infant Grass, in his opinion.

All three of them taunting like this only showed how eager they were to see Yang Kai’s frustrated face.

Yang Kai, however, just stood in place and glanced between Xu Wei, Zi Long, and Zi Dong before chuckling, “It looks like you all haven’t learned your lesson yet. Seems like I’ve been too soft-hearted.”

When collecting the Seeking Heart Lotuses just now, Yang Kai did not bother provoking them anymore mainly because he didn’t feel interested in doing so anymore. After repeating the same thing once or twice, it lost its appeal and became boring, but Yang Kai had not expected that these three would actually try to provoke him again.

Since that was the case, Yang Kai coldly snorted and decided they needed to pay the price.

“Say whatever you’d like, Brat. It won’t change the fact that you can’t collect those Heavenly Infant Grasses,” Xu Wei shouted.

“And if I can collect them?” Yang Kai looked at him coldly.

Xu Wei was startled, but quickly laughed even louder, “Such craziness! Go on then, show this old master how you plan to pick them.”

Yang Kai spat disdainfully and shook his head, “Old dog, if you want this Young Master to collect those Heavenly Infant Grasses, you’ll have to pay an appropriate price. After all, entering this Seven Coloured Radiant Light isn’t something that can be done for free.”

Xu Wei snickered and declared, “If you can really take them away, this old master will call you grandpa!”

Yang Kai was stunned, never having expected Xu Wei to go to such an extent just to provoke him. Apparently, this old dog hated him to the bone and whole-heartedly wished for him to rush into the Seven Coloured Radiant Light to seek death.

Recovering quickly, Yang Kai chuckled as he looked at Xu Wei, “You said it yourself.”

“So what if this old master said it?” Xu Wei snorted defiantly.
