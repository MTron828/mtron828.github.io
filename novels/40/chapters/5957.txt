Although this Black Ink Cult member wasn’t a Chapter Master, he was in the Third-Order Immortal Ascension Boundary; therefore, he was just as powerful as one.

With such power, he was confident to cultivate in a spot that was hard for others to reach.

If he was successful this time, he would challenge a Chapter Master and defeat them so that he could take their place.

Much to his surprise, someone had gone further down into the Black Ink Abyss, and had somehow provoked many Apostles.

When the Immortal Ascension Boundary Master saw the Apostles’ bulky and hideous figures and felt their terrifying auras, he was initially horrified, but he soon became excited.

He was horrified because so many Apostles had emerged at the same time and it was a mystery as to what had happened in the depths of the Black Ink Abyss. On the other hand, he was excited because there was a higher Realm above the Immortal Ascension Boundary. The Apostles had apparently reached that Realm!

It was a goal he couldn’t achieve despite all his hard work, and it was also a secret that all the Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary Masters in the Primordial World had been pursuing.

While he was lost in his thoughts, a shocking scene came into his sight.

At that moment, an immense power seemed to have descended upon this place. Faced with this power, even a Third-Order Immortal Ascension Boundary Master felt as insignificant as an ant.

It was the power of the World!

Everyone present felt the anomaly immediately.

Invisible World Principles started gathering and becoming a mess before they turned into a storm that could destroy everything.

The storm surrounded the Apostles as a destructive aura permeated the air.

The Apostles looked up and growled. Although they were in a Realm above the Immortal Ascension Boundary, they were still unable to resist such destructive force.

Popping sounds were heard as the sarcomas on the Apostles’ figures exploded. As thick Black Ink Strength and blood spread, the entire place stank horribly.

Unable to withstand the destructive storm any longer, an Apostle exploded into a blood mist with a loud boom.

As if a spark setting off a firestorm, more Apostles began experiencing the same fate.

The Apostles that came from the depths of the Black Ink Abyss seemed to have passed an invisible boundary. On one side of the boundary, it was life, and on the other side, it was death.

The remaining Apostles finally detected the danger ahead. Although they had lost their sanity, they still had their instincts. Like a group of wild beasts, they made the wisest decision when their lives were at stake, they stopped in their tracks. Instead of chasing after Yang Kai, they slowly returned to the darkness as their growls gradually faded.

Yang Kai hovered in mid-air and looked down in contemplation.

It seemed that things were just as he had expected.

He didn’t conceal his figure using Thunder Shadow’s Innate Divine Ability earlier because he wanted to verify his speculation. In order to do so, he lured the Apostles to leave the Black Ink Abyss.

[This is going to be troublesome…]

He secretly clicked his tongue. Initially, Yang Kai thought that if he wanted to refine the Profound Source Gate, he just had to deal with the Black Ink Cult. Now, it seemed that he had to clear out these Apostles as well.

However, the Apostles were all in the Transcendent Realm. Since he was only at the peak of the Immortal Ascension Boundary, he wasn’t a match for a swarm of them.

Therefore, he had to come up with a solution.

All of a sudden, a series of growls and pops were heard coming from somewhere.

Yang Kai turned around and saw a figure in front of a stone room. A man in the Third-Order Immortal Ascension Boundary had come out to find out what was going on.

Just now, Yang Kai already detected his presence, but he didn’t pay attention to him.

Upon closer inspection, he realised that the person was no longer able to resist the Black Ink Strength exuded from the Apostles earlier.

This person was trying to break through his limits by cultivating in such a spot, and if there had been no external harassment, he could’ve kept his sanity; however, many Apostles were killed just now, and the Black Ink Strength billowing from their corpses was too intense. Therefore, it immediately exceeded the limit that this person could bear.

Yang Kai watched as the man was engulfed in thick Black Ink Strength, and the aura exuded from him turned wicked. Nonetheless, his aura was rising sharply, as though he was about to break through the Immortal Ascension Boundary. Of course, it was difficult for him to achieve his goal due to the suppression of the World’s Will.

All of a sudden, the man looked down at the Black Ink Abyss’ depths with a fervent gaze and muttered, “I see. This is the power that transcends the Immortal Ascension Boundary!”

Saying so, he moved downwards without hesitation, sporting an elated expression as though something was calling out to him.

However, the moment he moved, Yang Kai blocked his way and landed a palm on his forehead. The person’s head shattered upon impact before he could even grunt in pain.

Knowing that this man would turn into another Apostle after falling into the Black Ink Abyss, Yang Kai naturally wouldn’t stand by and do nothing. By destroying him now, he would have one less opponent in the future.

Then, Yang Kai took another look at the depths of the Black Ink Abyss before shooting upwards.

To save himself some trouble, he concealed his figure and aura this time so that no one would notice him.

The anomaly in the Black Ink Abyss’ depths had alerted many Black Ink Cultists, but they could only hear some growls and howling, so they didn’t know what happened.

As the news spread, many Black Ink Cultists soon gathered together; nevertheless, given the fact that they were unable to reach the deepest part of the abyss, they couldn’t gather any useful information.

What surprised Yang Kai was that Xue Ji was still waiting for him.

He secretly spoke to Xue Ji and told her to go somewhere quiet before giving her some orders.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Xue Ji nodded repeatedly, “I understand, Master. However, please give me a Faith Token. Otherwise, given my identity, I won’t be able to gain that person’s trust.”

“Sure,” Yang Kai fished out a jade slip and left his Imprint inside. After writing a short message as well, he passed it to Xue Ji, “Go on.”

She then turned around and left.

After she was gone, Yang Kai shot into the sky and turned into a ray of light before moving in a particular direction.

The Light Spirit Religion had gone all out in their march towards the Black Ink Abyss, taking four different routes to ensure they succeeded. Initially, they could easily defeat their enemies, but as the Black Ink Cult recovered from their initial shock, it became harder and harder for them to move forward.

On balance, those from the Light Spirit Religion were still at an advantage.

The Holy Son’s performance was especially stunning. Although he was only in his early twenties, he was already at the peak of the Immortal Ascension Boundary. When the Light Spirit Religion’s forces were trying to conquer a city the other day, the Holy Son dealt with five Immortal Ascension Boundary Masters from the Black Ink Cult on his own without being at a disadvantage. He even managed to kill one of his opponents, which significantly boosted the Spirit Religion’s morale.

Due to the Light Spirit Religion launching a war all of a sudden, the entire Primordial World descended into chaos; however, they had the people’s support. The commoners had been oppressed by the Black Ink Cult for years, so they hoped the Spirit Religion would save them.

In an abandoned village outside North River City, a figure suddenly appeared under the night sky.

The figure was a woman, and as she looked around, she demanded coldly, “Reveal yourself!”

“I’m not even hiding. Why are you so furious, Big Sister?” A woman was heard laughing as she emerged from the darkness. She was none other than Xue Ji.

The person who called out to her was the Fire Order Lord from the Light Spirit Religion, Li Fei Yu.

An Order Lord from Light Spirit Religion and a Chapter Master from the Black Ink Cult had met up in an abandoned village under the night sky. Anyone would’ve assumed that something fishy was going on between them.

Hearing the woman’s mockery, Li Fei Yu lifted her blemish-free chin, “Are you sure you’re supposed to call me Big Sister? How old are you?”

Xue Ji covered her mouth and chuckled, “I’ve asked around. You’re three months older than me, Big Sister Li.”

Li Fei Yu snorted, “Stop acting like we’re friends. Why did you want to see me?”

They briefly exchanged moves in the morning, and it was at that moment that Xue Ji secretly asked Li Fei Yu to meet her tonight.

Getting down to business, Xue Ji sported a serious expression and replied, “I was instructed to come here.”

Li Fei Yu squinted her eyes, “Instructed by who?”

Xue Ji said, “Why are you asking this question when you’re well aware of who I serve, Big Sister Li? That person told me to get into contact with you.”

After a moment of silence, Li Fei Yu shook her head, “I don’t believe your words. You have to show me some proof.”

“That’s why I’ve brought a Faith Token with me,” Xue Ji smiled and flicked a jade slip at the woman.

Li Fei Yu took it and read it with her Divine Sense. After that, she looked at Xue Ji with a conflicted gaze.

Although she already knew some important information and formed some speculations, she still found it hard to believe when she saw everything for herself.

Was the Night Chapter Master from the Black Ink Cult so easily subdued?

“I told you I serve that person,” Xue Ji said.

Li Fei Yu kept the jade slip, “There’s nothing wrong with the jade slip. Although that guy trusts you, it doesn’t mean I’ll do the same; after all, men can be easily deceived sometimes.”

Xue Ji pouted aggrievedly, “You’re misunderstanding everything, Big Sister. I’m truly loyal to him.”

Li Fei Yu scoffed, “Show me something useful, then. Talk is cheap.”

Xue Ji let out a sigh, “I knew it wouldn’t be easy to gain your trust. Fortunately, I’ve also brought a gift with me.”

Saying so, she clapped her hands, after which a figure emerged from the darkness behind her. Li Fei Yu secretly put up her guard.

However, the person only walked up to Xue Ji and passed a package to her respectfully before leaving the place.

A metallic tang permeated the air immediately after.

Li Fei Yu looked at the blood-soaked package and narrowed her eyes.

Xue Ji tossed the package to the woman and said with a smile, “Let’s see if you’ll like this gift, Big Sister Li.”

Li Fei Yu let the ‘gift’ fall to the ground instead of catching it; then, she summoned a sword and opened the package.

Soon, a hideous-looking head came into her sight.

At that instant, she said in shock, “This…”

Xue Ji licked her lip and replied, “I just killed him, so the head is still warm. You can touch it if you like, Big Sister Li.”

[What is wrong with her?!]

Li Fei Yu felt her stomach churning. She didn’t expect the Night Chapter Master to be willing to do such a thing for that person.

The head belonged to the City Lord of North River City who was in the Third-Order Immortal Ascension Boundary.

It was rumoured that he had tried competing to become one of the Eight Chapter Masters in the past, but he was defeated in the end. However, since he had the right to compete for such a position, there was no doubt he was one of the most powerful cultivators in this World.

Therefore, it was a surprise that his head now lay before her.
