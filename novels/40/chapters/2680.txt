Since the unknown enemy had taken Ying Fei’s presence into account, his plan must be well-thought-out; however, no matter how many things this mastermind had taken into account, he would not be aware of the existence of Xi Lei and Xie Wu Wei.

Yang Kai just needed to set up a Space Array and summon the two Monster Kings from the Northern Territory. All schemes and tricks would be in vain in the face of absolute strength.

Moreover, Yang Kai was completely capable of doing this. Now that there was still some time before the auction, Yang Kai could arrange a Space Array in a discrete location and bring the two Monsters Kings over here without anyone knowing.

After some deep thought though, Yang Kai slowly shook his head, “No need.”

First, he did not have many Space Spirit Crystals and Space Spirit Jades on hand, so he did not want to waste them. Second, if he really summoned two Monster Kings over, it might alarm the enemy; after all, they entered Flowing Shadow City in a group of four, so if their group suddenly increased by two, everyone would find it suspicious.

Yang Kai actually considered hiding Xi Lei and Xie Wu Wei inside his Sealed World Bead, but it was better not to reveal its existence to too many people.

Since Yang Kai had decided, Ying Fei did not try to persuade him of anything. He just secretly made up his mind to keep Yang Kai safe no matter what happened.

“Come, follow me for a walk!” Yang Kai dropped a few Source Crystals to pay for the food and drinks, then walked out of the inn with Ying Fei.

Before coming to Flowing Shadow City, Yang Kai already vaguely felt that the auction was a conspiracy. It seemed that someone had deliberately set a trap and was waiting for their target to take the bait.

After he reached Flowing Shadow City and met the Sect Master of Flowing Shadow Sword Sect, Yang Kai felt more certain that his guess was likely true.

And now, he abruptly received an invitation to the auction, which made him wonder whether he was the target of this conspiracy since the beginning.

Yang Kai didn’t understand why this was happening, but he didn’t plan on simply following the other party’s script.

Since the auction would be held in Flowing Shadow City, it was reasonable that the items to be auctioned would be in Flowing Shadow City. Therefore, he wanted to check if Ai Ou and the rest were here. If so, he could just snatch them back directly.

While walking around, Yang Kai released his powerful Divine Sense to cover the surroundings like a tide while keeping as low a profile as possible.

He was very familiar with the aura of Ai Ou and the others, so he would certainly notice them if they were really in Flowing Shadow City.

But after half a day, Yang Kai could only sigh. Sure enough, the enemy was not foolish enough to keep his bargaining chips out in the open.

Yang Kai brought Ying Fei back to Warm and Inviting Inn.

The attendant of the inn came up to Yang Kai and informed, “Sir, a guest is waiting for you.”

“Who?” Yang Kai was surprised.

He did not know anyone in this Flowing Shadow City, so he was completely confused.

“It’s a woman.” The attendant showed a smug face, “She is now waiting in front of your room.”

Yang Kai furrowed his brow and released his Divine Sense to check, immediately discovering who was waiting for him. He murmured to himself as he could not help feeling a bit shocked, “How could it be her?”

Without a doubt, Ying Fei realized too and whispered, “Young Master Yang, be careful. This woman is not easy to deal with.”

“En, I know,” Yang Kai nodded. He had no clue about her background before, but after learning her origin and identity, Yang Kai did not dare to underestimate her anymore.

After tipping the attendant with some Source Crystals, Yang Kai strode upstairs.

A petite and exquisite young woman was pacing back and forth outside a room, mumbling to herself incessantly with an impatient expression. It seemed that she was a bit distracted and did not even realize that the Divine Senses of Yang Kai and Ying Fei had scanned her just now.

It was not until the sound of footsteps came from nearby that the woman suddenly stopped and looked up.

At first glance, a face captured her eyes, one so hateful that all she wanted to do was smash it in with her fist.

“Qing’er, are you here to find me?” Yang Kai looked at Zhu Qing with a grin and walked towards her step by step.

Zhu Qing’s face darkened as she asked in a frigid tone, “What did you just call me?”

[Impudence! How dare a trivial Human address me so informally!]

Ying Fei was speechless too, secretly admiring Yang Kai’s courage to provoke her even after knowing she was from the Dragon Clan. Still, he silently circulated his Monster Qi and prepared to fight at any moment. Although he did not want to make enemies with a member of the Dragon Clan, Yang Kai’s safety was his top priority now.

“Why so cold? I prefer how you looked before,” Yang Kai stood in front of her and looked at her with a smirk, his eyes sweeping across the bulge of her dress.

Being scanned by his obscene gaze, Zhu Qing could not help shivering. The feeling of being taken advantage of before struck her again. She was embarrassed and annoyed, immediately raising her fist to strike at Yang Kai’s face fiercely.

However, she instantly regretted her actions. Her Elder had ordered her to build a good relationship with Yang Kai, and then invite him to visit the island. Was not the reason for this trip here to put an end to their war and make peace? How could she forget her purpose so easily and act so recklessly?

She rapidly withdrew seventy percent of her strength.

Her fist was caught by a big hand, one that immediately began caressing her smooth fingers gently.

A strange tingle crawled across her body as Zhu Qing yelled with her face flushed red, “Let go!”

[I shouldn’t have held back my strength. I should have just smashed this hateful face with that punch just now!] While grumbling to herself, she swung another small fist towards Yang Kai, as if she wanted to fight him to the death.

“Good, good, good, I’ll let go. Don’t be so sensitive,” Yang Kai said despite continuing to rub her hand a bit longer, seemingly reluctant to let go.

Zhu Qing quickly jumped back to keep some distance from Yang Kai, her twin peaks bouncing noticeably as she landed. She furiously shook her little hand that was touched by Yang Kai, like she was trying to shake off something unclean.

Ying Fei, standing to the side, was drenched in cold sweat by now. He almost made a move when Zhu Qing attacked, but fortunately, he realized that Zhu Qing had withdrawn some of her strength at the last moment. Nevertheless, he was confused at Zhu Qing’s actions.

[What is she… doing?]

[Did she really fall in love with Young Master Yang? Otherwise, why did she withdraw her strength even when she was so angry? By the looks of it, she doesn’t seem to like Young Master Yang. In fact, from her attitude it’s like she can’t wait to kill him.]

Ying Fei was bewildered.

On the other hand, Yang Kai was snickering, his laugh sounding creepy and lewd. He took out the room token to unlock it before pushing open the door and leaning against the frame, “Let’s talk inside if you have anything to say.”

He had no clue why Zhu Qing came to him, but since she was here, it must be something important. Yang Kai was not afraid that she would get cold feet, for she was a proud Dragon after all.

A pair of beautiful eyes glared at Yang Kai with hatred, their piercing gaze seemingly wanting to slice Yang Kai a thousand times over, but she remained frozen on the spot.

Yang Kai continued to smile from ear to ear without urging her.

The scornful smile undoubtedly provoked Zhu Qing’s pride and soon she grit her teeth and swiftly entered the room.

“Bold indeed!” Yang Kai grinned, thinking that since she had thrown herself into his arms, she could not blame him if he did anything to her.

Yang Kai turned around and wanted to close the door.

Ying Fei blocked it from closing though as he seemed to want to follow inside, “Young Master Yang, I…” He stared at Yang Kai with his eyes widened.

“Get… out!” Yang Kai curled his lips then slammed the door, almost flattening Ying Fei’s nose.

“Young Master Yang, you…” Ying Fei was deeply worried and yelled, “Indulging in your lust is equivalent to hanging a knife upon your head! Young Master Yang, don’t become beguiled by beauty!”

There was no response from the room, making Ying Fei feel like a cat on a hot tin roof. Du Xian heard their movements from outside and poked his head out of his room, asking, “Sir, what happened?”

“Nothing!” Ying Fei replied angrily. He was anxious, but he did not dare to break in.

But on second thought, since Yang Kai could subdue Zhu Qing last time, logically, he would not be in big danger this time. Furthermore, Zhu Qing did not release any murderous intent from the beginning, making Ying Fei feel like he was just being paranoid.

Inside the room, Yang Kai turned around and hugged Zhu Qing’s waist. He leaned his head on her shoulder, gently sniffing her intoxicating fragrance as he nuzzled her white neck and whispered, “Qing’er, did you miss me so soon?”

Zhu Qing’s whole body stiffened in an instant. She did not expect Yang Kai to be bold enough to take advantage of her as soon as they were alone, leaving her no time to react. Infuriated, she snapped, “Take your dirty hands off of me!”

Yang Kai ignored her and instead gently bit Zhu Qing’s earlobe.

The heart inside her tender body jumped, followed by a reverse headbutt.

Yang Kai fell to the ground with a bang, stars floating in front of his eyes as two streams of Golden Blood flowed out of his nostrils.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Zhu Qing immediately leapt away and stood at the corner of the room. She glared at him with her teeth gritted, rebuking, “Please show some propriety!”

Yang Kai stretched out his arm and wiped the blood off his face. The pain that he felt actually calmed down his agitated mood a little. He looked at Zhu Qing, and sneered, “I can’t believe that someone from the noble Dragon Clan would actually cultivate a Charm Technique!”

Zhu Qing frowned, “What are you talking about? Since when did I cultivate a Charm Technique?”

Yang Kai snorted, “If you didn’t use some kind of Beguiling Technique on me, why would this Young Master be unable to control himself as soon as he sees you?”

“You were simply born obscene. Can you blame me for that?” Zhu Qing felt deeply wronged by his accusation. [Can a dog eat shit then blame that shit for tempting it because it smelt too good? Nonsense! Wait, how can I think like this? Isn’t this reference just degrading myself!?]

“Bullshit!” Yang Kai curled his lips, “Although this Young Master is not a gentleman, he is still able to remain perfectly calm even if a woman sits on his lap of her own free will. Since when am I obscene?”

Zhu Qing sneered, “Your actions are frivolous and dissolute, what could you be if not obscene?”

Yang Kai stared at her for a while, then he waved his hand, “Forget it, good men don’t argue with women.”

He took a deep breath and silently circulated his Secret Art to suppress the fires in his heart, then he looked up and questioned, “So, why did you find me? Don’t tell me you fell in love with me at first sight! Although I’m also a responsible man, I won’t force it if you don’t want to.”

Zhu Qing snickered, “Are you always this full of yourself?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Yang Kai answered unmindfully, “I wonder who it was that embraced this Young Master so tight last time. Her strength was so strong that the nail marks she left on this Young Master’s back are still here. Oh right, that’s because she is a true dragoness… “

“Shut your mouth!” Zhu Qing could not help becoming angry out of shame. She stomped her foot fiercely, causing the whole inn to shake as if it was about to collapse from her brute strength.

The previous incident was simply the biggest humiliation of her life, and Yang Kai just could not stop touching the trigger.

After taking a deep breath, Zhu Qing chanted to herself, [Don’t be mad, don’t be mad. Focus on the bigger picture, for my clan, my sacrifice is nothing worth mentioning…]

It took her a while to finally calm down and look at Yang Kai, “So, now you know that I am from the Dragon Clan?”

Yang Kai looked at her with a calm smile, but there was actually a great storm whirling around inside his head. Previously, when he discussed this with Ying Fei, even though they guessed that Zhu Qing might be from the Dragon Clan, it was still just a guess.
