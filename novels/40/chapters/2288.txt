Meanwhile, the other three Blood Dagger Masters were still weaving their own hand seals with solemn looks on their faces.

*Weng...*

A faint yet strange noise suddenly echoed out, while the Source Qi of those people surged and a faint halo emerged around them.

Yang Kai’s expression changed. He suddenly discovered that the forces of those four cultivators resonated and connected tightly.

“Motionless... As Mountains...” The Mountain-titled cultivator who hadn’t uttered a word until now suddenly shouted with his face flushed. He patted the void below him with both his hands, letting out a loud slapping noise, followed shortly by a mountain phantom that appeared behind him for a brief moment before it disappeared into his body.

Formless ripples started spreading around the man and they turned into a peculiar power that sealed this region. Sitting cross-legged mid-air, the Mountain man closed his eyes like a monk in meditation, becoming deaf and blind to the outside world.

*Hong...*

In the face of Yang Kai’s Myriads Sword strike, the Wind-titled cultivator curled up the corners of his mouth and revealed a mocking smile.

*Pa...*

The sword strike stopped before the Wind-titled cultivator, but its sharp Sword Qi cut off his black bangs and left a bloody streak on his forehead, yet it still couldn’t take his life with one strike as Yang Kai intended.

The Myriads Sword was blocked by a formless barrier!

“What the hell is this?” Yang Kai’s pupils contracted as he stared in disbelief at the Wind-titled cultivator. He noticed clearly that the opponent didn’t even try to defend against his assault, yet his deadly strike was still obstructed.

The Wind-titled cultivator didn’t wait for Yang Kai to get over his shock before pointing his finger at his chest. A whirlwind containing indomitable power was formed at the tip of his finger.

Yang Kai could only place his sword in front of him in a fluster to defend against this assault, allowing the finger strike to fall upon the Myriads Sword’s blade.

The next moment, Yang Kai’s expression changed. He could feel that tremendous power was contained in this strike, as if a great mountain had slammed into him. He was sent flying away, the Source Qi flow within his body becoming disturbed.

A scarlet figure closed in on him silently. The Fire-titled cultivator attacked with his dagger in hand, bringing with him clouds of flames that swept towards Yang Kai.

“Young Master Yang, be careful!” Ye Jing Han’s pretty face turned pale and she cried out in alarm.

*Swoosh!*

The clouds of fire were assisted by a gust of wind. These two powers of different attributes overlapped and fused perfectly. In an instant, the whole sky was dyed in blazing scarlet colour.

Yang Kai could clearly feel the ferocious power contained in this move and his face fell. Just as he planned to teleport away, a sudden crackling noise echoed out, followed closely by the Thunder-titled cultivator who had appeared behind him and thrust his palm at his back.

The palm strike fell upon him directly before Yang Kai had a chance to dodge it. In an instant, arcs of lightning started dancing around him, while Yang Kai who had been obstructed by the lightning quickly got engulfed by the clouds of fire. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The Wind, Thunder, and Fire-titled cultivators cooperated skilfully and their timing was perfect. It was as if he was facing Soul Clones of the same person, rather than three different people. They had cornered Yang Kai with only a few moves.

Upon seeing this, Ye Jing Han’s face turned deathly pale, while her eyes shivered. She observed the raging clouds of fire in silence and asked herself inwardly, [Did he die? Did he die just like that?]

She couldn’t deny that Yang Kai was the strongest Dao Source Realm cultivator she had ever seen. He was prideful and arrogant, with an unyielding nature, but he also had many strange methods she could not begin to comprehend. She had always yearned to make some great achievements in the future like Yang Kai, yet such a great person was suddenly killed before her eyes.

He died so easily, to the point she couldn’t even believe it.

*Shua shua shua...*

The bodies of the Wind, Thunder, and Fire-titled cultivators suddenly flickered and they stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the air. They were coldly observing the region below them.

“Did our superiors make a big fuss over nothing? This boy doesn’t amount to much,” The Fire-titled cultivator snorted coldly and said disdainfully.

The Wind-titled cultivator was still observing the clouds of fire with furrowed brows, yet upon hearing the words of the Fire-titled cultivator, he couldn’t help but reprimand angrily, “You attacked him too viciously. Our superiors asked us to bring him back alive! They don’t want a corpse. If he really died, then how are we going to report this?”

The expression of the Fire-titled cultivator changed, as if he just realized that this was anything but good news for them; however, he still said obstinately, “I didn’t know that he was so frail, he couldn’t even take a single move... What should we do now?”

The Wind-titled cultivator snorted coldly, “You should solve the trouble you have made by yourself. Once we get back, I’ll report everything to them truthfully.”

The Thunder-titled cultivator furrowed, “Don’t make a fuss here, we aren’t even sure if he is dead. That brat is quite tough and he probably just suffered heavy injuries. Fire, go down and have a look at him.”

Upon hearing this, the Fire-titled cultivator got irritated, but he still rushed into the clouds of fire to inspect them.

The Wind and Thunder-titled cultivators waited nervously. They were all afraid that Yang Kai had really died; after all, their superiors asked them to bring him back alive, so if they killed him by mistake, it could very well be their final days in Blood Dagger. They all couldn’t withstand the punishment Blood Dagger would mete out.

The clouds of fire were still burning like before, as if they would continue burning until the end of the world, but the inner region was quite serene and the Fire-titled cultivator didn’t make a sound after he entered.

The Thunder and Wind-titled cultivators exchanged a glance, both realizing something was amiss.

At this moment, an incident suddenly occurred. A muffled groan transmitted from the clouds of fire. Shortly after, the Fire-titled cultivator flew out of the clouds, coughing up mouthfuls of blood mid-air.

“What?” The faces of the Thunder and Wind-titled cultivators darkened.

*Shua shua shua...*

A peculiar noise transmitted from the clouds of fire, as if Sword Qi and Sword Intent were running amok there. Shortly after, the raging flames suddenly got scattered and were replaced by a single figure shrouded by a multi-coloured radiance.

“Young Master Yang!”

Upon seeing the silhouette shrouded by seven-coloured light, Ye Jing Han wept in delight.

“That’s impossible!”

Upon seeing Yang Kai’s current state, the Thunder and Wind-titled cultivators cried out in alarm. They had noticed that even though it looked like Yang Kai was quite dishevelled, he didn’t sustain any injuries.

Moreover, the multi-coloured radiance emanating from him contained some great and mysterious power. They could clearly feel the power of the Five Elements around Yang Kai at this moment, causing his aura to rise sharply. The Five Elements coexisted in a single person body, supporting and nourishing each other in a virtuous cycle.

“Be careful, this brat isn’t easy to deal with,” The Fire-titled cultivator suddenly returned to his companions and wiped the blood at the corners of his mouth before turning an eager look towards Yang Kai.

“We don’t need your warning,” The Thunder and Wind-titled cultivators glared at the Fire-titled cultivator.

“Friends, many thanks for your concern,” Yang Kai swung the Myriads Sword and erased the Five Element Sword Qi around him as he revealed a grin. “I took a good rest and managed to learn the essence of your Formation Technique. Mountain, Thunder, Fire, and Wind. Your attributes resonate and fuse together, allowing you to enhance one another’s abilities.”

Saying so, Yang Kai cast a glance at the Mountain-titled cultivator sitting in the void who had turned a deaf ear to everything and said with an appreciative look on his face, “The Mountain man is in charge of sealing this region and protecting you, isn’t he? It’s no wonder my teleportation didn’t work a while ago. If I didn’t have a tough body, then I would have sustained some injuries already. The one who invented this Formation Technique is a true genius.”

The expression of the Wind-titled cultivator changed, “And you discovered all of that in such a short time?”

“That’s not quite right,” Yang Kai patted his clothes. “I also took some time to change into a new set of clean clothes. Do they look good on me?”

The Wind-titled cultivator’s expression turned unsightly as he suddenly noticed that Yang Kai had really changed into a new set of clothes and wasn’t just joking.

The Thunder-titled cultivator said with a gloomy look plastered on his face, “It looks like our superiors have their own reasons for sending all of us after him. This boy cannot be assessed with common sense.”

“No matter how strong he is, he’s only a Second-Order Dao Source Realm boy. If we join hands, we can contend even against an Emperor Realm Master, so we don’t have to fear him,” The Fire-titled cultivator flew into a rage out of shame.

Upon hearing this, Ye Jing Han, who had just calmed down, got nervous again.

If these four cultivators could really contend against an Emperor Realm Master, then Yang Kai had no chance of success. No matter how strong Yang Kai was, he was only a powerful Dao Source Realm cultivator and he couldn’t defeat an Emperor.

After the three chatted for a while, they suddenly quieted down and looked at Yang Kai with a grave gaze.

On the other side, Yang Kai only smiled in response, as carefree as ever.

An austere air filled the region.

Ye Jing Han suddenly shivered as if she had just fallen into a blizzard, feeling the tangible murderous intent pervading the air and assailing her skin, making her feel quite uncomfortable.

She was aware that she couldn’t provide any help to Yang Kai in a fight of this calibre, so she just hid far away to not cause more trouble to him.

Soon, their murderous intent suddenly collided in the air and burst out. The ambience changed and the Fire-titled cultivator shouted, “Charge!”

Following his shout, the Thunder-titled cultivator, who was the swiftest, suddenly appeared in front of Yang Kai and raised his hand, which had been shrouded by Lightning to swat at him, while a sizzling noise ringing out loudly

Yang Kai’s pupils contracted, but he still just coldly snorted, “Three Thousand Sword Dao, Seal!”

As he made a move, Sword Light sliced the void open and spread to the surroundings to assail the Thunder-titled cultivator.

The Thunder-titled cultivator was still unfazed and he just raised the corners of his mouth in response. His body suddenly turned fuzzy and he disappeared from his former location, shortly replaced by the Fire-titled cultivator, who was dozens of meters away.

“Location swapping?” Yang Kai’s expression changed.

The Fire-titled cultivator thrust his blade at him, followed closely by a cloud of fire, “Raging Flames Burn The Plains!”

*Hong hong hong...*

As the Sword Qi and flames collided, an intense explosion echoed out, while the World Energy in the region was stirred up chaotically. Space trembled as shockwaves spread far and wide.

“Thunderstorm!” The Thunder-titled cultivator appeared on the left side of Yang Kai at some unknown time and thrust his palm at him, while several thick arcs of lightning suddenly appeared atop Yang Kai’s head and descended upon him.
