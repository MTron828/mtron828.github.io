It was the truth though. In Eight Paths Sect, everyone, including the Sect Master and Vice Sect Master, was afraid of Luo Yuan. The Sect Master had once said that Luo Yuan was a one-in-a-billion genius and that one day he would gain fame and reputation across the Star Field, rising above all others, so everyone in the Sect had never said no to any of his requests, big or small. The hope of bringing glory to the Sect was all pinned on Luo Yuan.

Luo Yuan’s words were equivalent to the words of the Sect Master. He occupied the best cave mansion in the Sect and was given nearly half of the cultivating resources available. When he was cultivating, no one dared to interfere, unless they wanted to die.

This was also the biggest reason why the disciples of Eight Paths Sect did not want to magnify the issue before – they did not want to disturb Luo Yuan!

Who knew that he was still alarmed in the end.

The disciples of Eight Paths Sect were both terrified and delighted – terrified that Luo Yuan might punish them for putting him in a bad mood, while on the other hand, delighted that a strong backup had come to rescue them out of trouble.

“Ah... It’s you!” At that moment, the round-faced woman who had been standing behind Luo Yuan came back to her senses and broke her obsessive gaze away from Luo Yuan. She looked around with a frown and cried out when her eyes met Yang Kai, “You are that... that...”

She could not remember Yang Kai’s name.

Yang Kai smiled slightly, “Yang Kai!”

“Yes, yes, you are the one who exchanged an Extraordinary Treasure Pill with me in the Four Seasons Realm. Why are you here?” The round-faced woman recalled her last encounter with Yang Kai.

“Why can’t I be here?” Yang Kai was amused.

The round-faced woman tilted her head and thought, silently agreeing that the question she asked was a bit nonsensical. She then smiled at him and did not speak again.

Luo Yuan’s gaze was locked on Yang Kai, a boundless fighting intent suddenly flashing across his eyes that were originally as quiet and still as water.

Yang Kai grinned, “How long have you been here?”

Luo Yuan said lightly, “Not too long!” After a pause, he added, “I was alerted when you summoned that artifact in your hand, then I came and saw that you wanted to kill a disciple from my Sect.”

He carried an indifferent tone as he spoke, but the annoyance and coldness were clear in his words.

No matter what, he was still a disciple of Eight Paths Sect so he could not just sit back and watch a fellow disciple get killed.

The middle-aged man was overjoyed and shouted hurriedly, “Junior Brother Luo, this person who thinks he’s unbeatable is disrespecting our Sect. Not only did he attack Junior Brother Lin Yun, but he also wounded me. Junior Brother Luo, please seek justice for us!”

He changed his previous yes-man attitude towards Yang Kai and became extremely arrogant, feeling secure and confident now that he had a backer here.

“Really?” Luo Yuan frowned and looked at Yang Kai coldly.

Yang Kai smiled, “En, I knocked out the one lying there, and I hurt the one who spoke earlier.”

“How bold of you!” Luo Yuan raised the corners of his mouth, “This is what men should be like, I admire you!”

“Is Brother Luo going to stand up for them?” Yang Kai looked at him with a smile.

“There’s a Secret Technique that I have been cultivating recently, but I seem to have reached a bottleneck, and closed-door meditation has been fruitless to break through it...” Luo Yuan suddenly talked about an irrelevant topic, but the scorching intent in his eyes intensified as he spoke. The Source Qi in his body trembled as he shouted in a low voice, “I was still worried that I could not find a worthy opponent here in this pathetic countryside, but it’s perfect now that Brother Yang is here!”

“Do you want to use me to break through the bottleneck of your Secret Technique?” Yang Kai looked at him oddly.

“Indeed!”

“Why should I help you?” Yang Kai quipped, “I won’t do anything that doesn’t get me anything!”

“You have no choice,” Luo Yuan snorted coldly as he stepped forward and approached Yang Kai, his aura strengthening with each stride.

From the posture he assumed, regardless of whether Yang Kai agreed or not, he was going to make a move.

Yang Kai frowned.

Luo Yuan was no ordinary cultivator, not to mention that he was already a Third-Order Dao Source Realm. His extraordinary combat power alone should not be underestimated.

If it was not necessary, Yang Kai would rather not get into a fight with him. They were still in the Qin Residence and fighting a battle here would definitely flatten at least a third of this place while also likely wounding the already weak Qin Yu and the others.

Yang Kai was not as unscrupulous as Luo Yuan and would not act without giving any consideration to others.

“Stop!” At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly yelled.

Luo Yuan paused, a look of displeasure flashed across his face as he shouted in a low voice, “Who are you?”

There was a murderous intent on his face as he looked extremely unhappy being interrupted by Qin Yu. If he was not actively suppressing himself, he likely would have killed her already.

Qin Yu said, “Qin Family Qin Yu!”

Luo Yuan retracted his murderous intent upon hearing this and muttered “So you are the owner of this place, huh?”

A frown appeared on his face as he fell silent for a time before asking, “What is it you want to say?”

His murderous look before had subsided and it was replaced with a cold but still polite posture, surprising Yang Kai greatly.

“I would never presume to tell you what to do. You are strong after all and the Qin Family is weak,” Qin Yu said sarcastically. “It’s just that a disciple of your Eight Paths Sect killed a servant from our family, so shouldn’t Your Excellency give us an explanation first?”

“Killed a servant from your family?” Luo Yuan’s face became cold, “Such a thing happened?”

“The body is still here, can you not see it?” Qin Yu ground her teeth.

Luo Yuan turned his gaze to the female corpse in the courtyard and frowned before he gazed towards the middle-aged man and asked, “What happened?”

The middle-aged man was flustered and did not know how to answer. He stammered and was unable to say anything.

“I will count to three. If you have not answered by then, you know the consequences!” Luo Yuan’s expression became colder, “One... “

The middle-aged man suddenly shuddered and began rapidly explaining what had happened without leaving out any details or adding any inflammatory remarks.

After hearing what had happened, Luo Yuan thoughtfully said, “So, Brother Yang made a move because of this?”

“Ye... yes...” The middle-aged man glanced at Yang Kai and nodded in agreement, not daring to falsely accuse Yang Kai.

“I understand now!” Luo Yuan nodded before his figure flickered and he shot into a nearby ruined room. When he emerged once more, he was carrying the fainted Lin Yun in his hand.

Yang Kai looked at him with interest, uncertain how Luo Yuan would deal with Lin Yun and what kind of explanation he would give the Qin Family.

“You’re the Young Lady of the Qin Family, right?” Luo Yuan looked at Qin Yu and said lightly, “Since he was the murderer, watch carefully!”

Luo Yuan then madly poured his Source Qi in the hand holding Lin Yun’s neck.

In an instant, Lin Yun swelled up and his skin turned blood red.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed, secretly amazed.

The faces of the disciples from the Eight Paths Sect filled with shock as the middle-aged man cried out, “Junior Brother Luo, don’t!”

Lin Yun woke up from his unconsciousness in severe pain at that moment, but he was still a little dazed and had no clue what was happening. The sight which greeted him, however, was Luo Yuan’s face so Lin Yun couldn’t help calling out in shock, “Luo... Senior Brother Luo!”

“En,” Luo Yuan nodded casually before increasing the strength of his grip as he poured more Source Qi into him.

“Ah...” Lin Yun screamed, realizing that something was wrong, “Don’t... don’t... “

*Peng... *

With a loud explosion, Lin Yun popped in Luo Yuan’s hands and turned into a blood mist that scattered across the sky. However, even though Luo Yuan stood right next to him, he remained completely spotless.

Silence filled the courtyard.

The entire Qin Family stood frozen in place while the disciples from Eight Paths Sect looked at each other in shock, none of them daring to take a breath.

No one expected that Luo Yuan would kill Lin Yun just like that!

Weren’t they fellow brothers from the same Sect? Wasn’t Lin Yun the nephew of Eight Paths Sect’s Vice Sect Master?

Everyone was flabbergasted by the cruel and cold-blooded brutality of Luo Yuan.

“Are you satisfied with this explanation, Young Lady Qin?” Luo Yuan looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu gritted her teeth “Satisfied!”

The murderer had died in front of her eyes, what else could she say? A life for a life, Luo Yuan actually fulfilled this condition, so there was nothing left for her to complain about.

“Good!” Luo Yuan nodded lightly, disregarding what other people thought as he turned back to Yang Kai, “Brother Yang, let’s begin!”

Yang Kai was flummoxed, “Begin? Begin what? Can you not control yourself a bit more? Do you just want to fight and kill all day?”

Qin Zhao Yang thought that Yang Kai was afraid of Luo Yuan, so he hurriedly stepped up, “Little Brother Luo, since we have settled the matter and the murderer had paid the price, let’s sit down and have a good chat, this Old Master will offer his best hospitality.”

Luo Yuan ignored him and continued to focus his attention on Yang Kai, “Brother Yang, you are disappointing... What happened to your domineering madness in the Four Seasons Realm? How can you reach the peak of the Martial Dao if you shy away from challenges?”

“The peak of the Martial Dao?” Yang Kai curled his lips fiercely, “I am only a First-Order Dao Source Realm now, isn’t it too early to start thinking about such things?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“A successful person is always farsighted!” Luo Yuan said, “Brother Yang, you shouldn’t be so short-sighted.”

Yang Kai said seriously, “Wrong, wrong, it’s all wrong!”

Luo Yuan asked unexpectedly, “What’s wrong?”

Yang Kai replied, “I think it’s only right to be realistic, to take one step forward at a time instead of reaching out for something that is beyond one’s grasp.”

Luo Yuan frowned, “If one has no ambitious goals, how can they move forward?”

He looked like he was preparing to debate with Yang Kai to get his way, so Yang Kai responded impatiently, “Let’s just agree to disagree and mind our own business.”

“I want to fight Brother Yang now!”

“You’re still not giving up...” Yang Kai stood forward immediately and snapped, “What’s the point of fighting against me? With the abilities I possess, you can’t even touch a single hair on my head!”

“Uh...” Luo Yuan was taken aback and suddenly recalled that Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space. Back in the Four Seasons Realm, Yang Kai had been able to utterly ignore all of the powerful Masters targeting him precisely because no one below the Emperor Realm could stop him from coming or going as he pleased.

Luo Yuan really may not be able to even touch a hair on Yang Kai...

“Don’t run...” Luo Yuan thought for a while and proposed, “Let’s have a passionate, bloody fight like real men.”

Everyone looked anxious.

Yang Kai looked at him disrespectfully and sneered, “Have you gone stupid from cultivating too hard? Why shouldn’t I use all of my abilities in a fight?”
