Chapter 1675, Shadowed Star’s Tribulation

When the Ancient Yang Sect was destroyed, nearly all of its members were killed, but some of them came back to life for an unknown reason, becoming animated corpses that could not only walk and fight but even cultivate and grow stronger.

On Shadowed Star, the younger generation may have been ignorant of the situation in the Grand Burial Valley, but Qian Tong wasn’t.

Yang Kai also knew about this as he and Yang Yan had gone to explore the Grand Burial Valley. During that expedition, Yang Kai acquired the Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art as well as the Sun’s True Essence and Ten Thousand Year Ice Jade Pedestal.

At that time, he also encountered several powerful Corpse Generals, and if not for his comprehension of the Dao of Space, he would not have been able to escape.

As soon as he fought against Fang Feng Qi, Yang Kai guessed that he was related to Grand Burial Valley, and Qian Tong’s question confirmed his speculations.

“Old dog, your eyes aren’t bad. This King is indeed from Grand Burial Valley. We are a noble family of corpses who dominate above all living things!” Fang Feng Qi didn’t show any fear as he announced proudly.

The Corpse Spirit Race! This was what the special creatures who comprised Corpse Spirit Religion called themselves, a piece of information Qian Tong had learned already from Fei Zhi Tu.

“You? Dominate above all living things?” Qian Tong’s expression remained indifferent, “You’re just a bunch of failures who should have remained dead, you have no such qualifications.”

“Heh heh,” Fang Feng Qi snickered, “Whether we are qualified or not is not up to you to decide. You will come to know just how ignorant you are soon! Old Dog, don’t waste your time, this King won’t tell you anything.”

“Really?” Qian Tong sneered, “Even if this old master destroys your Corpse Core, you won’t cooperate?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The Corpse Core was the Corpse Qi-filled bead hidden in the lower abdomen of members of the Corpse Spirit Race like Fang Feng Qi. For the Corpse Spirit Race, this core was no different from a Monster Core of a Monster Beast. All of the strength a member of Corpse Spirit Race possessed was stored inside their Corpse Core.

Fei Zhi Tu had fought several members of the Corpse Spirit Race, so he knew this information.

Fang Feng Qi’s face changed slightly as he snapped, “Old Thing, you dare to threaten this King!?”

“Whether it’s a threat or not, you’ll know if you try,” Qian Tong said aggressively.

Fang Feng Qi seemed to understand Qian Tong’s decisiveness and his face became cold as he shouted, “Old Dog, you’ll never make this King talk! You’ve brought this upon yourself!”

As soon as he said so, a terrifying energy fluctuation erupted from his abdomen and a cracking sound rang out, as if something had just broken.

“Not good!” Fei Zhi Tu’s face changed drastically.

Everyone else also realized what was happening and Yang Kai hurriedly pushed his Saint Qi to protect Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang while Qian Tong waved his hand and protected Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er.

“One day soon, my Corpse Spirit Religion will unify Shadowed Star, and all of you will die, hahahaha!” Fang Feng Qi let out a peal of mad laughter before his body exploded with a loud crash.

A thick green cloud of Corpse Qi centred on Fang Feng Qi’s former position spread out. Wherever this Corpse Qi passed, the ground melted, and walls crumbled. In the blink of an eye, the entire City Lord’s Mansion shook violently and almost collapsed.

At the last moment, if it were not for Qian Tong using his Origin King Realm cultivation to support it, the City Lord’s Mansion would definitely have been destroyed.

This was not surprising though; the power of the self-destruction of a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master was not to be underestimated.

The only reason for keeping Fang Feng Qi alive was to extract some useful information from him about Corpse Spirit Religion, but instead of being useful, this only led to trouble, causing Qian Tong’s expression to turn ugly.

If all members of the Corpse Spirit Religion were so ruthless and decisive, dealing with them would surely be difficult.

Outside the hall, an Origin Returning Realm master hurriedly walked in and swept his eyes around, a look of shock filling his face as he was uncertain what had happened.

“What is it?” Qian Tong asked in a deep voice.

The man quickly cupped his fists and replied, “Great Elder, all Corpse Spirit Religion disciples hidden in Heavenly Fate City have been exterminated!”

“Good! Were there any casualties?”

“With the help of the Elders from High Heaven Sect, only a dozen people were killed or injured!”

“En, give all of them lavish funerals!”

“Yes!”

In Shadow Moon Hall, although many coveted life and feared death, choosing to submit to Corpse Spirit Religion, there were also many who stood firm and resisted. The latter had been imprisoned without exception and were rescued two days ago, now joined Qian Tong in his efforts.

In Heavenly Fate City, Fang Feng Qi was not the only Corpse Spirit Race member. Yang Kai, Wei Gu Chang, and the others encountered several others when they invaded the City Lord’s Mansion, all of which they promptly killed.

There were also many hiding in Heavenly Fate City, but they had been cleaned up over the past two days.

It could be said that only now had Heavenly Fate City been completely liberated and its internal worries eliminated.

Yang Xiu Zhu and the others soon walked in from outside as well.

“Everyone has worked hard!” Qian Tong quickly got up and cupped his fists gratefully.

Yang Xiu Zhu waved his hand, his expression still somewhat grim, “Dealing with some miscellaneous pawns was no trouble at all, but if Heavenly Fate City is like this, I really don’t know what the rest of Shadowed Star is like.”

Fei Zhi Tu sighed, “Over the past two years, Corpse Spirit Religion has developed extremely quickly. They seem to have a Secret Technique that can turn living people into members of their Corpse Spirit Race and force them to bend to the religion’s will. Corpse Spirit Religion only appeared two years ago, and at that time they only numbered a few thousand, but now they have swelled tens of thousands. Many of these masters were originally Origin Returning Realm masters from various major Sects and families, so they cannot be underestimated!”

Fang Feng Qi also planned to turn Fei Zhi Tu into a member of the Corpse Spirit Race, which was why he had not crippled his cultivation or destroyed his meridians.

As long as the meridians weren’t destroyed, even if Fei Zhi Tu were beheaded, Fang Feng Qi had a way to turn his corpse into a Corpse Spirit which had similar combat prowess to when he was alive.

“This is a grave tribulation for Shadowed Star!” Qian Tong sighed heavily. After going out for eight years, his return home had turned out like this, wiping away all the joy he felt from breaking through to the Origin King Realm and replacing it with deep sadness and concern.

“Everyone, I want to return to Clear Sky Sect,” To the side, Mo Yu suddenly spoke.

He had also been helping in Heavenly Fate City these past two days, but now that the situation had stabilized, he naturally wanted to head home.

“Brother Mo...” Qian Tong opened his mouth, naturally understanding how he felt.

They did not know the exact situation of Clear Sky Sect, but at least half of the great forces on Shadowed Star had already been wrapped up in this turmoil. Clear Sky Sect was one of the first-class forces on Shadowed Star, so it would obviously be a target for Corpse Spirit Religion, meaning its prospects weren’t promising.

Mo Yu wanting to return to Clear Sky Sect was only natural; after all, he was Clear Sky Sect’s Great Elder.

However, allowing him to return alone at this time was not something the rest of those gathered here felt comfortable with.

If possible, Qian Tong wanted to accompany him, but although Heavenly Fate City had been cleaned up already, the problem of Shadow Moon Hall’s headquarters was yet to be resolved.

With Shadow Moon Hall’s headquarters still in dire straits, it was of utmost importance that Qian Tong remain here to handle matters personally, rescuing those who were unwilling to submit to Corpse Spirit Religion while purging the traitors and heretics who betrayed and murdered them.

“This Mo is not an ordinary Third-Order Origin Returning Realm now. None of you need to worry, I will be careful,” Mo Yu smiled lightly.

Seeing that he had made up his mind, Qian Tong could not say anything more, instead just nodding, “In that case, I wish Brother Mo a safe journey.”

“Rest assured, on today’s Shadowed Star, there are few worthy to be my opponent,” Mo Yu nodded.

The former Mo Yu was one of Shadowed Star’s top Origin Returning Realm masters, and after experiencing the Blood Prison Trial, his overall combat power has increased significantly, even though he failed to break through to the Origin King Realm as Qian Tong did.

Even if the Corpse Spirit Religion had many powerful masters, as long as they did not really possess an Origin King, there was no one Mo Yu needed to truly fear.

“Senior Mo, how about delaying for one day so I can accompany you,” Yang Kai suddenly proposed.

“Yang Kai, do you want to return to High Heaven Sect?” Qian Tong asked.

“En, although there’s no need to worry about High Heaven Sect being breached, I am still worried about what happened to Elder Ye as well as the others. Senior Mo’s Clear Sky Sect happens to be on the way, so we might as well travel together.”

“Very well!”

Although he did not understand why Yang Kai wanted him to wait for a day, Mo Yu still agreed.

After everything was decided, Yang Kai immediately went to the location of Heavenly Fate City’s Space Array.

When Corpse Spirit Religion seized control of Heavenly Fate City, the Space Array was destroyed by Fei Zhi Tu, so now Yang Kai wanted to try and see if it could be repaired.

If possible, it would save them a good deal of travel time.

After all, it was not a short journey to High Heaven Sect!

Yang Kai had used Heavenly Fate City’s Space Array more than once, so he knew where it was located. Soon, he rushed over to the palace with Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang, the two women standing guard to prevent any accidents as Yang Kai walked over to the Space Array and began carefully studying it.

Being proficient in the Dao of Space did not mean he could arrange a Space Array, as this required a great deal of knowledge about Spirit Arrays. Yang Kai had never arranged a Space Array before, but he had seen Yang Yan arrange one, so he had some confidence.

Yang Kai spent the next two hours examining the Space Array, constantly using his Divine Sense to scan its internal structure and identify what was damaged.

Two hours later, Yang Kai flashed a happy smile.

Fortunately, although this Space Array was indeed destroyed, the damage done to it was not serious. There were still traces of various patterns and structures, so if he simply patched them up, Yang Kai was certain he could restore it to working order.

After carefully sorting out his thoughts, Yang Kai leapt up onto the Space Array.

Taking out all kinds of rare ores from his Space Ring, Yang Kai began smelting them with his Conflagrated Knowledge Sea before patching the destroyed parts of the Space Array.

As this was his first attempt at such work, Yang Kai was not extremely deft and made obvious mistakes several times, frustrating him somewhat.

However, as time passed, he became more and more familiar with the work.

Moreover, repairing this Space Array seemed to deepen his own comprehension of the Dao of Space.

This unexpected gain greatly satisfied Yang Kai.

It seemed he had found another way to cultivate the Dao of Space.

The Dao of Space had always been difficult to cultivate. Recently, Yang Kai had been cultivating by absorbing the energy of Space Spirit Crystals, but he had already used up his entire supply of Space Spirit Crystals, so now his primary way of cultivating Space Force was to expand the Sealed World Bead.

Now, he learned that arranging and fixing Space Arrays was also a viable cultivation method.
