Zhang Ruo Xi was stunned for a while before realizing that the old swindler was calling her. She could not help feeling a little timid in front of everyone’s eyes and her face was getting paler while the fluctuation in her aura also became more violent as time passed.

She turned to look at Yang Kai with an inquiring gaze.

Yang Kai asked in a deep voice, “Old man, are you joking with me?”

The old swindler replied solemnly, “Why would this Old Master make a joke like this?”

“Then you better explain to me clearly how Ruo Xi can help you seal the Divine Spirit’s Soul!”

It was not only Yang Kai who held doubt, everyone was the same. Zhang Ruo Xi did not seem capable with her Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation. There were so many Emperor Realm Masters present here, so why would the old swindler ask her instead of them for help?

But the old swindler shook his head and replied, “I can’t tell you. If you believe in this Old Master, allow her to come over; if not, this Old Master can no longer help.”

Yang Kai fumed, “How can I believe you if you don’t tell me!?”

The old man spread his hands, “Then we have no choice. Just wait until her seal is completely released and maybe the Divine Spirit’s Soul would go back to sleep again after turning this Shattered Star Sea into a bloodbath. Good luck, everyone.”

Yang Kai’s face turned ugly. This old man was deliberately making things look unnecessarily mysterious, but he could not do anything about it, which really annoyed him.

At this moment, Zhang Ruo Xi suddenly spoke up, “Sir, I would like to give it a try. If I can, I want to help stabilize Little Sister Xiao Qi’s condition!”

“You should look at your own condition first…” Yang Kai frowned.

He did not understand what was wrong with Zhang Ruo Xi, but he felt uncomfortable with the strange aura surrounding her body. Although her condition was not as serious as Mo Xiao Qi’s, Yang Kai was still worried about her.

“I’m fine,” Zhang Ruo Xi bit her red lips, “Sir, please let me try.”

“If you hesitate any more, nothing can be done when her seal is completely released. And… I don’t mind telling you this, the conditions of these two little girls were ultimately triggered due to a chain reaction; if the seal is stopped, her problem would also be solved too.”

Yang Kai was puzzled, but he could not help believing the old swindler as he looked and spoke with such sincerity. He asked in a deep voice, “Does your plan include hurting Ruo Xi?”

“It’s not life-threatening. This Old Master just needs a drop of her Blood Essence!”

“Blood Essence…” Yang Kai looked startled, and started to believe that the old swindler was not just blabbering, because Zhang Ruo Xi had a peculiar Bloodline Power in her body that, up until now Yang Kai still had not fully understood. The old swindler obviously knew that Zhang Ruo Xi’s bloodline was extraordinary since he requested her Blood Essence. Therefore, he must have understood that the secret of her bloodline could assist him in sealing the Divine Spirit’s Soul.

But how did he notice?

“Good!” Yang Kai agreed and brought Zhang Ruo Xi over with him.

The two of them arrived in front of the old swindler in no time.

The old man faintly smiled at Zhang Ruo Xi and comforted her in a gentle voice, “Relax, young lady, this won’t hurt a bit.”

Zhang Ruo Xi nodded lightly, took a deep breath, and prepared herself.

Just before he started though, the old man suddenly glanced over Zhang Ruo Xi and questioned in surprise, “Your clothes… look quite good. Where did you get them from?”

Yang Kai was secretly taken aback by his question.

Because under Zhang Ruo Xi’s robes was the Pink Clouds Phoenix Robe defensive Emperor Artifact!

The value of this Emperor Artifact was exceptionally high, and its defensive capability was extraordinary. Zhang Ruo Xi had been wearing it ever since she got it.

When the old man praised her clothing, he was certainly not referring to the dress she was wearing, but rather the Pink Clouds Phoenix Robe hidden inside.

[What’s wrong with this old man? He could even notice this too?] Yang Kai could not help becoming alert.

On the contrary, Zhang Ruo Xi did not take precautions against the old man and answered softly, “A friend of mine gave it to me.”

“Friend… eh?” The corner of the old man’s mouth twitched before he let out a light laugh, “If you see your friend again next time, send this Old Master’s regards to him. Tell him that this Old Master misses him very much!”

Zhang Ruo Xi asked in astonishment, “Senior knows him?”

“It’s been a long time since we last met,” the old man replied kindly.

The two of them exchanged a few words peacefully, but on the other side, Yang Kai felt a storm of fright in his heart. His eyes went round, as if he was looking at a ghost in broad daylight.

He knew that this old man was definitely not the chatty type contrary to what his appearance would suggest. Rather, he was utterly mysterious and unfathomable.

Zhang Ruo Xi obtained the Pink Clouds Phoenix Robe from the Four Seasons Realm, and according to her, this Emperor Artifact was given to her by an Ancient Divine Spirit, Qiong Qi!

Qiong Qi seemed to be the mount of the Flowing Time Great Emperor. After the fall of the Flowing Time Great Emperor, Qiong Qi had remained in a deep sleep inside the Four Seasons Realm, until the appearance of the Flowing Time Temple. After that, Qiong Qi left the Four Seasons Realm and went missing.

Qiong Qi was an Ominous Ancient Beast, and slaughter was a part of his nature. During the time when he came out of the Four Seasons Realm, Gao Xue Ting and the other Emperors who were guarding the exit were all taken aback. Fortunately, Qiong Qi was not set on causing trouble and was diverted away by the Bright Moon Great Emperor, otherwise Gao Xue Ting and the others would have unquestionably died.

But now, this old man was actually implying that he knew Qiong Qi.

[Who the hell is this old man!?] Yang Kai already felt that he was strange before, but now, he was even more undecipherable than mist.

[Why does such a hidden Master only have a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation?]

“Senior, how should I address you?” Zhang Ruo Xi and the old man seemed to be having a friendly chat, allowing her anxiety and tension to gradually relax.

Yang Kai hurriedly perked up his ear to listen.

The old man opened his mouth and uttered a few words.

Yang Kai looked at them with a blank face, because he could not hear what the old man said at all.

Zhang Ruo Xi dipped her head, “Junior understands. If I ever meet my friend again, I will send Senior’s regards. However, I don’t know where he is now, as he went missing after giving me this gift.”

While speaking, Zhang Ruo Xi suddenly shook slightly and almost collapsed.

Luckily, Yang Kai caught her with his quick reflexes.

“Alright, the Blood Essence has been collected, you can rest for a while,” the old man smiled.

Only at that moment did Yang Kai notice that there was a drop of red blood floating above the old man’s finger. The blood was like a living being, dancing on his fingertips, appearing exceedingly unstable and releasing an indescribable aura.

Yang Kai had no idea when the old swindler had collected the Blood Essence.

The reason why Zhang Ruo Xi shook all of a sudden was certainly because a drop of her Blood Essence was extracted. However, this was not a big deal and she would recover after a good period of rest.

After obtaining the drop of Blood Essence, the expression of the old man instantly turned extremely solemn. The Source Qi inside his body fluctuated as he wrapped it around the drop of blood before using lightning-quick movements to bring his finger towards Mo Xiao Qi’s forehead.

*Chi… *

The Heavenly Illusion Butterfly’s Soul became dreadfully restless all of a sudden, as if it had met its natural enemy, constantly flapping its wings and emitting illusionary waves.

Yang Kai had suffered a huge loss before and fully acknowledged the power of this illusion technique. He was about to retreat in a hurry, when he realized that the wave of illusions was completely suppressed after encountering Zhang Ruo Xi’s Blood Essence, not even able to form a tiny ripple.

Without any obstacles, the old man tapped the Blood Essence on Mo Xiao Qi’s forehead.

The Blood Essence burst at once, forming a red mark on Mo Xiao Qi’s forehead, then seeping into her body.

As the Blood Essence disappeared, the chaotic aura coming from Mo Xiao Qi’s body rapidly stabilized and the Heavenly Illusion Butterfly was gradually sucked by an inexplicable force of attraction into her body, returning to a butterfly mark again on her cheek.

After a soft moan, Mo Xiao Qi fell down limply, her eyes closed.

Yang Kai hurriedly stretched out his other hand and held her. He looked at her and saw that she was breathing normally, probably just passed out but otherwise fine.

A Heaven-shaking crisis that came inexplicably was also solved inexplicably. Everyone was terrified by the incident for quite a while, and only when it was finally settled did many realize that their backs were drenched with cold sweat.

“Sir, I feel so sleepy!” Zhang Ruo Xi cried out, following in Mo Xiao Qi’s footsteps as she passed out.

“Not bad, little brat, holding two beauties left and right. This Old Master is jealous,” the old man teased Yang Kai with a grin.

Yang Kai was speechless and replied, “Is it really okay for an old man to not behave with some dignity?”

“This Old Master was also once young, so it’s not a big deal,” the old man winked at Yang Kai as he responded, revealing a playful look.

Yang Kai remarked, “Old man, I’m not going to lie to you. Previously, I misunderstood you and thought you were a swindler. Only now do I know that you were hiding your light under a bushel.”

“Haha!” The old man laughed, “This Old Master is just a little better at deception than others. It’s not worth mentioning.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Old man, since you knew that Ruo Xi’s Blood Essence was able to suppress the Divine Spirit’s Soul, you must have known what kind of bloodline she has. Can you tell me?”

As soon as this question was asked, the old man’s expression immediately turned serious. He paused for a moment before answering solemnly, “I can’t tell you, but you will understand when she becomes stronger in the future. However, this Old Master does have some advice for you.”

“What?”

“Lead her onto the righteous path, for if she were to fall to the wicked path, the entire Star Boundary will suffer!” The old man advised solemnly. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yang Kai squinted his eyes, “It’s that serious?”

The old man looked at the sleeping Zhang Ruo Xi, his eyes flashing a profound light as he continued, “When she grows to her peak, the power that she will wield will be even more horrifying than Wu Kuang’s!”

“Wu Kuang? Who is Wu Kuang?” Yang Kai asked with a frown.

The old man disclosed in a deep voice word by word, “Heaven… Devouring… Great… Emperor!”

*Gudong *

Yang Kai could not help gulping in fear, but he still pressed on, “Old man, you actually know the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s taboo name?”

If it were not for this old man, Yang Kai would not have known the real name of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. The two words ‘Heaven Devouring’ were just his title, not his name. Wu Meng Chuan claimed himself to be the descendant of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, so Yang Kai could have guessed that the surname of Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was ‘Wu’.

But he did not expect that he would actually learn the real name of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor from this old man.

How did he know?

Suffering from morbid curiosity, Yang Kai could not help asking, “Old man, who the hell are you!?”
