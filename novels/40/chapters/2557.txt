A ferocious look appeared on Yang Kai’s face. He would really do it. He wasn’t just making an idle threat.

“Despicable!” Lin’er’s face turned pale. [This bastard still wants to kill me! He has been harbouring impure motives from the start. You better not fall into this Young Lady’s hand, otherwise, I will definitely take good care of you!]

“Sir, if you don’t believe me, you are welcome to give it a try!” Yang Kai waved the Myriads Sword, taking a posture that he was ready to die along with the enemy.

Old Fu maintained the same stoic look as he rebuked in a low voice, “You fought shoulder to shoulder with the Bustling World Great Emperor? Brat, haven’t you gone overboard with your bragging? Aren’t you afraid of getting exposed?”

Yang Kai replied, “This Junior only states facts, he never brags.”

“Is that so…” Old Fu meaningfully laughed before he paused and stated, “Wait a moment!”

“Wait for what?” Yang Kai stared at him in amazement, his brow slightly furrowing. He had no idea what the opposite party was planning on doing now, but he knew that he was clearly not the opposite party’s opponent; therefore, he didn’t dare to take things lightly.

The opposite party couldn’t be compared with the likes of Feng Xuan. Even though it was just a Soul Manifestation here, Yang Kai didn’t have much confidence in being his enemy; however, he still had some confidence in escaping. If it weren’t for this, how could he dare to stay here and confidently talk with the opposite party, maintaining a straight face?

Meanwhile, Old Fu’s gaze lowered a little as he stood completely still. Yang Kai immediately became suspicious. But he still didn’t dare to make a rash move, lest he provoked the other party’s anger.

…

Somewhere among a towering, snow-capped mountain range, buildings of all shapes and sizes stood erect. From time to time, cultivators would fly over from the sky. The buildings below were filled with people, painting an extremely lively picture.

Senior Brothers of the same Sect were exchanging pointers with each other or playing games of chess. Teams of maids passed by, moving in a hurry without speaking or smiling.

Plum blossoms were blooming everywhere as their sweet fragrance lingered in the air. Many tamed, rare, and exotic animals were roaming in the mountains and forests, where rays of morning sunlight were shining through the clouds and the leaves of trees.

The beautiful sights painted the picture of a paradise on earth that was extremely rich in World Energy.

This was the hegemon Sect of the Eastern Territory, Serene Soul Palace.

Those who had never been to Serene Soul Palace couldn’t even imagine this scenery inside this Sect. Its name containing ‘Soul’ alone gave the impression of a mysterious and ethereal place. There was a vast difference between imagination and reality.

On the highest mountain covered in snow, there was a palace that stood on a vast piece of land. The palace was cold and deserted, seemingly not having been inhabited by anyone for a long time.

Also, not a single person could be seen within a hundred kilometres of this mountain. Not even the birds and beasts wandering in the mountains dared to approach this place.

It couldn’t be helped as this was the Restricted Area of Serene Soul Palace, where the Serene Soul Great Emperor cultivated in secluded retreat.

Serene Soul was one of the Ten Great Emperors and stood at the apex of the Star Boundary. It was quite common for his retreats to last several dozen years to over a century. Unless one was summoned, no one dared to disturb him at all. Even his children needed to ask for his permission before they could set foot here.

Even the Young Palace Master of Serene Soul Palace, Yao Si, hadn’t seen his father for three years. He only knew that his father was comprehending some Secret Technique and could not be disturbed.

At this moment, under the swaying lights inside the palace, two figures were sitting cross-legged opposite each other.

One was a person with black hair and wearing a black robe. He had an indifferent look on his face, but there was a natural aura of majesty and superiority to him, giving a daunting impression. He was none other than the Serene Soul Palace’s Master, one of the Ten Great Emperors, Serene Soul Great Emperor himself.

And the other person sitting opposite him was an elderly man. This elderly man seemingly didn’t know how to sit or stand properly and was literally just slumped on the ground, looking left and right with a bored look on his face, as if he wanted to see what this damned place had to offer. Apparently, he was preparing to take advantage of the moment the Serene Soul Great Emperor wasn’t paying attention.

His appearance, the sneaky look on his face, perfectly matched his movements.

If Yao Si saw this scene, he would be completely surprised.

Because only his father and a few of his most trusted confidants had ever set foot in this place; no outsider had ever entered it, but at this moment, an elderly man of unknown origins was sitting face to face with his father, and his great Father was completely unguarded against him…

If Yang Kai saw this scene, he too would be greatly shocked.

Because this elderly man wasn’t a stranger, he was none other than Duan Hong Chen, who had just parted ways with him in the Purple Mountain Range.

Who knew why Duan Hong Chen had come here and went directly to the Serene Soul Great Emperor.

Only the crackling sound coming from the wicks of the lamps could be heard in the silent palace. Right then, the Serene Soul Great Emperor slowly opened his eyes, scaring Duan Hong Chen, who immediately straightened his back and eagerly asked, “Are you done?”

“Not yet,” the Serene Soul Great Emperor shook his head.

Duan Hong Chen was at a loss and asked in amazement, “Why did you open your eyes when you aren’t done yet? Hurry up and finish whatever it is quickly, this Old Master still has other things which require your help.”

He showed not the slightest politeness, as if he was very familiar with the Serene Soul Great Emperor.

The Serene Soul Great Emperor smiled and stated, “Your business isn’t that pressing, but I have something to ask you.”

Duan Hong Chen curiously asked, “Ask me? What do you need to ask me about?”

The Serene Soul Great Emperor replied, laughing, “There is a little brat who doesn’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth and says that he fought shoulder to shoulder with you, is it true or false?”

Yang Kai had just boasted so shamelessly, so the Serene Soul Great Emperor had come back to ask Duan Hong Chen right away. Who knows how Yang Kai would feel if he came to know about this strange coincidence.

Duan Hong Chen sneered before replying, “What nonsense is that? Would you believe anything anyone says? When has this Old Master fought side by side with others? Whoever it is must have tried to scare you using the Old Master’s name. Send him away right away, this Old Master’s business is more pressing.”

Serene Soul agreed with a nod, “I also thought so…”

He also felt that Yang Kai was just uttering nonsense; after all, who was Duan Hong Chen? Even if he cut his own cultivation and his strength had sharply dropped, he didn’t need to team up with others to fight his enemies, and since Duan Hong Chen happened to be in his Serene Soul Palace, it didn’t cost him much to casually ask him.

“Wait!” Duan Hong Chen suddenly shouted, a strange look appearing on his face as he asked further, “What does this brat look like?”

He suddenly remembered that there was indeed a guy who had fought alongside him just recently.

The Serene Soul Great Emperor didn’t reply in words and instead waved his hand, causing the space between the two to ripple. A clear picture immediately entered Duan Hong Chen’s eyes. It was the scene of Yang Kai standing at the entrance of the Ancient Lands Passageway with the Myriads Sword, surrounded by corpses everywhere.

The corners of Duan Hong Chen’s lips twitched after just a glance before speaking, “Why is it this brat…”

The Serene Soul Great Emperor was stunned and immediately asked, “Do you know him?”

Duan Hong Chen’s face suddenly grimaced as he began grinding his teeth, “This King will recognize that brat even if he is reduced to ashes! Quickly kill him! If you help this King vent his anger, this King will definitely owe you one!”

The Serene Soul Great Emperor heaved a sigh before responding, “Heaven Devourer, if you come out and talk nonsense again, this King will not be polite to you. This King’s Serene Soul Finger isn’t something to be trifled with.”

He could easily tell at a glance that it wasn’t Duan Hong Chen speaking, but the Heavenly Devouring Great Emperor, Wu Kuang, who was sharing bodies with Duan Hong Chen. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Duan Hong Chen gave a weird smile, retorting, “Oh! How gutsy of you! You actually dare to use this kind of tone with this King! I didn’t see you having such guts back then.”

The Serene Soul Great Emperor repeated with a smile, “This King’s Serene Soul Finger isn’t to be trifled with…”

He kept silent about what happened back then. Apparently, he had suffered a huge loss at the hands of Heaven Devourer.

Duan Hong Chen’s face turned gloomy as he retorted, “Can’t you change the line you keep using? Is it that interesting to threaten this King with the same line, over and over again?”

The Serene Soul Great Emperor remained unaffected and kept smiling, “This King’s Serene Soul Finger…”

“You are sick!”

The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor didn’t have a good temperament to begin with, so at this moment, he couldn’t help but lash out.

At that moment, Duan Hong Chen’s suddenly jolted before the vicious look on his face suddenly disappeared, replaced by an angry look.

If somebody was speaking but someone took over his body suddenly, anyone would be annoyed, but Heaven Devourer and he couldn’t do anything to each other right now.

“Do you really know this brat?” Serene Soul asked after seeing that Heaven Devourer was suppressed.

“Yes…” Duan Hong Chen smacked his lips and said, “He is that boy I just told you about.”

Serene Soul raised his brow and asked, “Did both of you attack Heaven Devourer together, and ruin Heaven Devourer’s plans?”

“That’s right! But it’s more complicated than you think. I can’t explain it to you in just a few words. In any case, you have seen the final result,” Duan Hong Chen helplessly replied.

The Serene Soul Great Emperor slightly nodded before confirming, “So to say, he really isn’t just idly boasting, right?”

“What do you want to do to him?” Duan Hong Chen worriedly glanced at Yang Kai in the light screen before him.

He knew that the Serene Soul Great Emperor had used a Soul Descent somewhere. Apparently, his spoiled daughter had encountered some danger. The Soul Descent of a Great Emperor wasn’t a joke. It was like some treasured sword that couldn’t be drawn from the sheath, but once it was drawn, it needed to drink blood.

If the Great Emperor returned without killing someone after using Soul Descent, it would damage his reputation.

[It’s fine if it’s someone else, but if it’s Yang Kai…] Duan Hong Chen really didn’t want him to die at the hands of the Serene Soul Great Emperor; after all, he had indeed helped him a lot in the Shattered Star Sea.

Serene Soul asked, glancing at him, “Do you want me to let him go?”

Both of them were old monsters who had lived and cultivated for countless millennia, so Serene Soul could easily tell what was going through Duan Hong Chen’s mind even without any tell-tale signs and thought, [This is perfect. I can make this old thing owe me one.]

Serene Soul secretly made up his mind.

“I have nothing to do with him. Whether he lives or dies has nothing to do with me. You can do what you want. You don’t need to ask me,” Duan Hong Chen flicked his sleeve, wearing a disinterested look as though such matters were of no concern to him.

If Serene Soul could guess what was on his mind, why couldn’t he guess what Serene Soul’s plan was? He already owed him one, so if he owed him another, he might have to serve Serene Soul for a lifetime. This was a huge loss to him. He wouldn’t do it!

“Alright then, this King will kill him!” Serene Soul nodded, “Although it would be wilful, I can’t let anyone bully my daughter.”

“Heh,” Duan Hong Chen slyly laughed and stated. “If you want your daughter to die along with him, you are welcome to make a move.”

Serene Soul’s face sank as he snarled, “Duan Hong Chen, aren’t you looking down on this King too much? Although just a wisp of this King’s Soul has manifested on the other side, it will only take a wave of my hand to kill a First-Order Emperor.”

Duan Hong Chen explained, shaking his head, “If it was a normal First-Order Emperor, he would naturally not be your opponent. But this kid… Haa… Isn’t that simple. If you want to take him down, you might have to sweat a little.”
