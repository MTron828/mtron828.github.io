If Ji Lao San took on Human Form, he would appear as a youth who looked about the same age as Yang Kai, but in reality, he was many times older than Yang Kai.

Dragons were strong and had long lifespans; however, they grew extremely slowly. After nearly 10,000 years, Ji Lao San finally shed his former body and was reborn, breaking through his Bloodline shackles and advancing to become an Ancient Dragon.

The excitement was overwhelming, and he continued to roar in celebration.

Amid the Dragon Roars, Ji Lao San’s nearly 50,000 metre long Dragon Body finally achieved a breakthrough.

His Dragon Vein was enhanced as his Dragon Form continued to extend.

500 metres, 1,000 metres, 2,000 metres, finally the increase slowed to a stop at nearly 3,000 metres.

Each breakthrough a Dragon accomplished was accompanied by a leap in strength. Although when compared to before entering the Dragon Pool, he had only grown around 3,000 metres, Ji Lao San’s strength now was leaps and bounds greater than before. Now, he would be able to fight and defeat three of his previous selves from before he entered the Pool!

If he encountered that Human’s Dragon Pressure again, he was confident that he would be able to block it without any difficulty.

The other party might have obtained a Divine Dragon Source, but he was only a Grand Dragon, how much of the Source’s strength could he utilize?

After advancing to become an Ancient Dragon, Ji Lao San’s immediate desire was to seek revenge and regain his dignity.

Of course, it was impossible for him to kill Yang Kai as the Humans had some agreement with the Dragon Clan. He would be in big trouble for killing the Human, but certainly, a beating was acceptable. Fights in the Dragon Pool were a common affair and would not draw any attention from the Elders.

Therefore, after his breakthrough, Ji Lao San immediately dove down towards the depths of the Dragon Pool.

“Where is Third Uncle going?” Zhu Wu You asked when he sensed that Ji Lao San’s aura was getting further and further away.

A Grand Dragon next to him thought, “He must have gone to pick a fight with that Human.”

Of course, that was only to be expected when he was so agitated and impatient when he left.

Zhu Wu You froze and asked, “Hey, how come I haven’t seen that Human as we descended all the way here?”

Big Brother Ji looked at him scornfully and said, “Are you stupid? Since you did not see him, he must be deeper down; otherwise, why would Third Uncle swim deeper in anger?”

Zhu Wu You remarked in disbelief, “Does that mean that Human is so powerful he could dive deeper than Third Uncle?”

Among these current Dragons in the Dragon Pool, Ji Lao San was the strongest with the purest Bloodline. Thus, his territory was the deepest in the Dragon Pool compared to the other Dragon Clan members who entered this time. How could that Human have gone so much deeper than Ji Lao San? Was his Bloodline and Source so much more powerful?

Zhu Wu You’s casual remark caused the Grand Dragons to look at each other and begin to wonder what was going on.

“Let’s follow,” said a Grand Dragon before he immediately swam down after Ji Lao San.

Even if they were not going down for the spectacle, the Dragon Pool power at this level had been depleted and they had to go deeper for their respective needs. Since they had to go deeper anyway, they might as well tag along to see how Ji Lao San dealt with that Human. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

All the Young Dragons and the Grand Dragons had naturally encountered Yang Kai when he was diving deeper into the Dragon Pool and had lost to him. Thus, they felt humiliated and were eager to see him being taught a lesson by Ji Lao San.

They wanted that Human to know that the Dragon Clan was not to be messed with. The only reason why they were not his match was because they were not strong enough.

Along the way down, the Grand Dragons slowly began to have an ominous feeling.

This couldn’t be helped, as it was getting too deep.

The position where Ji Lao San was before should be the limit of his tolerance, but now, they had dived 2 million metres down and still they did not see the Human. They even began to suspect that the Human had been overconfident, dove too deep, and been crushed by the pressure of the Dragon Pool.

But then, why had they not seen any signs of his remains?

If he was not crushed, that would be even more terrifying.

The Grand Dragons were also aware of this and the atmosphere suddenly became a lot more serious. Although the three Young Dragon did not give it much thought, they could sense how solemn the situation was getting. Even the normally talkative Zhu Wu You kept quiet along the way.

Hundreds of thousands of metres further down, the lead Grand Dragon’s eyes suddenly lit up as he exclaimed, “Third Brother!”

All the Dragons fixated their eyes on Ji Lao San, who was one step ahead of them. Now, he had stopped to one side and did not descend any further. None of them knew what he was doing.

Soon, all the Dragons arrived at Ji Lao San’s position and the lead Grand Dragon said, “Congratulations on your advancement, Third Brother. The Dragon Clan now has one more Ancient Dragon.”

The other Grand Dragons also congratulated Ji Lao San.

Among the three Young Dragons, Zhu Wu You went all out to flatter Ji Lao San. He praised him as the unrivaled Dragon in the world and the number one Dragon in history!

It was an exaggeration for him to be deemed as the number one Dragon; however, at only 10,000 years old, to have become an Ancient Dragon, Ji Lao San was definitely extremely talented even among the Dragon Clan.

Many older Dragons were not as talented and would go through their entire life as Grand Dragons, were never able to take the final step to breakthrough.

On average, the Grand Dragons who had the ability to take this step were around 20,000 years old. This alone indicated how gifted Ji Lao San was.

However, what was strange to all the Dragons was that Ji Lao San did not react to their well wishes at all. In fact, he appeared quite sullen, puzzled, and in disbelief as he continued to look straight down.

The Dragons looked in the direction of where he was staring, but could not see anything.

“Third Brother, what happened? Aren’t you happy that you’ve become an Ancient Dragon?” A Grand Dragon, who had spoken earlier, asked in bewilderment.

If he became an Ancient Dragon, he would be so overjoyed that he could not sleep. Ji Lao San, on the other hand, looked bitter and dejected, which was really quite puzzling.

Zhu Wu You also asked, “Where is that Human? Has Third Uncle already killed him?”

That Human was too arrogant. When they entered the Dragon Pool earlier, he was slapped aside by that Human. Unfortunately for Zhu Wu You, he was not strong enough to beat that Human; otherwise, he would have fought with him to the end.

It would be fine if he was beaten by his own Dragon Clan Seniors, but how dare a mere Human beat him?

Since Zhu Wu You was incapable of taking revenge on his own, he could only count on Ji Lao San.

When he said this, a Grand Dragon asked, “Yes, where is that Human? Why is he nowhere to be seen?”

Ji Lao San, who had not moved, sighed unnoticeably before motioning slightly with his head, indicating the Human was below.

The expression of the Grand Dragon, who asked the question, changed as he remarked in disbelief, “He’s down below?”

Ji Lao San was about to nod, when he suddenly frowned and shouted, “Brace yourselves!”

As he said that, he used his Dragon Force to bring the three Young Dragons into his protection.

The other nine Grand Dragons were bewildered and couldn’t help wondering, [Brace ourselves? For what?]

They soon knew the answer. Deep in the Dragon Pool, a strange sound like that of a heartbeat pulsed. It was extremely faint, but at the same time, all the Dragons felt their Bloodlines resonate with it. The unusual feeling caused the Dragons to become very anxious and they began to surge their Dragon Pressure.

This was only the beginning though. Following the initial pulse, a powerful Dragon Pressure suddenly erupted and enveloped all the Dragons, immediately causing them to feel a sense of intense dread. They felt helpless, like children facing a fully grown man. Their throbbing Bloodlines were instantly suppressed as they looked at each other in panic.

Not only the Grand Dragons, but even Ji Lao San, who had just become an Ancient Dragon, felt suffocated.

Only then did the Dragons understand why Ji Lao San had brought the three Young Dragons under his protection. If he had not done so, the Dragon Pressure would have been too much for them and they likely would have been instantly crushed.

Luckily, this intense pressure disappeared as quickly as it came.

A Grand Dragon wondered aloud, “Was that from ‘that’ Senior?”

That feeling felt familiar to him, as he had once angered one of the clan’s Ancient Dragon Elders. When that Elder became angry, he unleashed a type of Dragon Pressure that felt similar to what they had just experienced.

Although he did not specify exactly who he was talking about, Ji Lao San was aware of the situation in the Dragon Pool and naturally understood who he meant.

Still, he slowly shook his head and said, “No.”

“No?” Everyone gasped.

The Grand Dragon was asked in surprise, “Who then?”

From their position, the Grand Dragons could not see the situation below, but Ji Lao San, who had become an Ancient Dragon, was clearly able to sense something; otherwise, he would not have stopped here. Before the strange pressure swept over them, Ji Lao San had reacted in advance, which meant that he could see the situation at a much deeper depth than them.

Ji Lao San did not answer, though he appeared to be very reluctant and in utter disbelief.

Another Grand Dragon hazarded a guess, “Third Brother, if it is not from that Senior, don’t tell me it was from that Human?”

Even he felt foolish for asking such a question. How was that even possible? The Dragon Pressure they felt was extremely pure, and they had all seen that Human in his Grand Dragon From as he descended through the Dragon Pool.

Although the Dragon Pressure he showed was indeed potent, if they closely scrutinized it, that Human’s Dragon Pressure was still impure. It must have something to do with him being a Human.

Although he had refined and merged with a Dragon Source and had a Dragon Clan Bloodline, fundamentally, he was still Human.

So, it was impossible that a Human caused such a commotion.

But unexpectedly, Ji Lao San muttered, “It was him.”

All the Dragons were shocked.

“How can that be?” They exclaimed in total disbelief.

Ji Lao San laughed bitterly. If they asked him, who was he supposed to ask?

Who could tell him what had happened? He should be full of joy when he advanced to become an Ancient Dragon. He then dove deeper into the Dragon Pool to look for the Human to restore his dignity. How could he have anticipated encountering such a situation. It was totally inexplicable.

The Dragon Scales on the Human had completely shed, and his Dragon Body was covered in a layer of fresh red blood that continued to ooze out, encompassing him entirely.

The Dragons next to him were not strong enough to see the situation below, but Ji Lao San was able to see some of it.

That was not a Human figure in the Dragon Pool below, it was a huge blood cocoon with a Human that had transformed into a pure-blood Dragon.

When they first came to this depth, there was still some Dragon Pool power around; however, that power was now madly flowing into the blood cocoon and disappearing. Now, the Dragon Pool power where they were had also been depleted.

However, that Human was now at the critical juncture just like he was previously. He had accumulated enough power and it was no longer a big deal if there was insufficient Dragon Pool power in the surrounding waters.

Furthermore, this blood cocoon… was about 50,000 metres long.

This was what made it so difficult for Ji Lao San to accept.

When he entered the Dragon Pool, he was just a step away from becoming an Ancient Dragon, yet he spent half a year to break through after much effort.

What about that Human?

When he entered the Dragon Pool, he was only 35,000 metres.

Half a year later, he was now 50,000 metres?

That was an increase of 15,000 metres!

Since ancient times, no Dragon who entered the Dragon Pool to cultivate had ever seen such a terrifying increase in size. 15,000 metres! How many years of cultivation was required to achieve that?

At first, Ji Lao San also thought that the Dragon Pool’s change had something to do with the Senior below. Now, it seemed that was not the case. Rather, it must be caused by this Human; otherwise, how could he have grown by so much in such a short time?

The more Ji Lao San thought about it, the harder it was for him to accept.
