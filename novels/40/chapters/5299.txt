The serious attitude of her companion made the colourful-robed young woman ponder.

As he pointed out, the fact that the Humans dared to send this young man over indicated that they had faith in his abilities and that he would encounter challenges once he reached the No-Return Pass. This Human from the Black Ink Battlefield was most likely one that should not be underestimated.

As she rolled her eyes, the colourful-robed young woman asked, “Shall we make a bet then?”

The days were incredibly monotonous for those who lived at the No-Return Pass. This was the final line of defence, and the hundred-plus Great Passes surrounding it were enough to intercept the Black Ink Clan Army.

When Great Evolution Pass was taken over 30,000 years ago, there were daring Black Ink Clansmen that came from Great Evolution Theatre to try and break through the No-Return Pass, but after experiencing the might of the Dragon and Phoenix Clans, no Black Ink Clansman dared to approach it anymore.

The Dragon and Phoenix Clans, being the two most powerful of the Divine Spirits, were naturally bored as they remained at the No-Return Pass. However, they were bound by the oath their ancestors took and were unable to freely roam about.

It was unusual for there to be such a show like today, so people naturally wanted to participate. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“What are we betting on?” The young man replied casually.

“Let’s bet on the visitor and Ji Lao San; who will win and who will lose,” the colourfully robed young woman replied.

“The prize?”

The woman placed one finger on her crimson lips, went silent for a moment, then snapped her finger, “Whoever loses will give the Human a tail feather!”

The young man glanced at her speechlessly. This way, the Human would receive the reward no matter the result.

The girl didn’t give him a chance to respond before saying, “I bet this Human will lose!”

As soon as she spoke those words though, her jaw dropped as an expression of utter disbelief appeared on her face.

She already acknowledged that if the Humans dared to send this youth alone to the No-Return Pass, there had to be something about him that made him special. Nonetheless, Ji Lao San wasn’t weak. He might not be able to do much harm to this Human, but even so, she did not believe he would really lose. It should at worst end in a tie.

Right after she had spoken though, the visitor had somehow grabbed Ji Lao San by his neck, as if it was as easy as grabbing a chicken, and strolled over from the void.

Their figures had appeared right in front of the pair after just a few steps, leaving behind a trail of afterimages in the distance.

“Space Principles!” The young woman with the colourful robe’s eyes were filled with astonishment. With her ability, it was normal for her to notice that this Human had cultivated the Dao of Space, and to an exceedingly high level of mastery at that. Even she would most likely have to acknowledge his superiority.

She had met several exceptional Humans who cultivated the Dao of Space during her long lifespan, but even so, none had reached such mastery over it.

Yang Kai had long been aware that a man and a woman atop the Parasol Tree were watching him, and that numerous Divine Senses in the No-Return Pass were also observing him.

Counting the actions of the man who blocked him, Yang Kai had no idea what the No-Return Pass had been expecting of him. The blocker’s acts might have been due to something personal, but that didn’t preclude the possibility of him being instigated by the higher-ups of the Dragon Clan.

[Are they trying to test me?]

Yang Kai wasn’t sure why the No-Return Pass held such an attitude, but he could also be considered as half a Divine Spirit; thus, he understood that he couldn’t be too modest while dealing with other Divine Spirits.

Due to the extreme arrogance of the Divine Spirits, only those who were more arrogant could speak to them on an equal footing.

As a result, when confronted with the blocker’s attack, Yang Kai retaliated without holding back.

Still, he just didn’t expect this Grand Dragon to be like an embroidered pillow, pretty to look at but overall useless in the end. Yang Kai hadn’t even used any strength yet, but the opposite party couldn’t resist; thus, currently, he was like a stray cat being dragged around by Yang Kai.

This was the simplest conclusion to a battle he had faced since entering the Black Ink Battlefield. Even the Feudal Lords understood how to fight back, but this Grand Dragon had no power to resist him at all.

Yang Kai raised his head and smirked, “Hello, pretty young lady.”

The colourful-robed young woman’s face twitched and she replied, “You have a sweet tongue.”

Yang Kai then passed what he was grabbing on to her, asking, “Does he belong to you?”

She smoothed her hair and shook her head, “He’s someone else’s.”

“Oh,” Yang Kai simply said, recognising that the female in front of him should be from the Phoenix Clan, which was not surprising given that she was perched on the Parasol Tree.

Ji Lao San on the other hand, who was grabbed by Yang Kai, was exceedingly embarrassed and enraged. He had never experienced such humiliation and disgrace in the tens of thousands of years of his life. Worse yet, all the Divine Senses in the No-Return Pass lingered on him, exposing his embarrassment to everyone.

He had shamed the other Dragons as well. How was he going to face his peers and the Phoenix Clan in the future?

“Let go of me!” He struggled hard and his cheeks flushed. He couldn’t figure out how he was instantly seized without even delivering an attack to his opponent.

In his eyes, the other party was nothing more than a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Human.

Although a Grand Dragon was technically equivalent to a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Master, if a battle took place between them, the Grand Dragon always had the upper hand.

No Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master could compete with a fully grown Grand Dragon, which was the Dragon Clan’s advantage as the head of the Divine Spirits.

This Seventh-Order Human, on the other hand, simply lifted his hand and easily captured him.

Ji Lao San felt like he was in a bad dream when he recalled what had happened just now. When he came into contact with his opponent, his strength was immediately restrained, making it nearly impossible for him to access the power of his Dragon Vein. This was the reason for his humiliation.

“Quit squirming!” Sensing the Grand Dragon’s struggle, Yang Kai forcefully shook his arm.

That caused Ji Lao San to feel dizzy for a moment, but this only made him feel more embarrassed and irritated. Such humiliation was worse than death for an arrogant Grand Dragon.

Dragon Force erupted all over his body, and even the forceful suppression couldn’t stop it.

When Yang Kai noticed something was wrong, he scowled and lifted his hand, throwing Ji Lao San away. Then, he said, “You and I don’t know each other. Why did you attack me?”

Ji Lao San’s Dragon Force was out because he unleashed his own Dragon Bead. This was a move that was equivalent to risking his life. Still, Yang Kai had felt he could merely resist the power of this Dragon Bead. In fact, if he hadn’t released him, even if Ji Lao San could escape, his Dragon Bead was certain to break, severely damaging the latter’s foundation.

Yang Kai had a Dragon Bead too, so he could identify what just happened and what would happen if he took certain moves.

It was not prudent to half-cripple a Grand Dragon before he even entered the No-Return Pass, so he chose to let Ji Lao San go.

It was necessary to demonstrate one’s strength when in front of those from the Dragon Clan; nonetheless, it was equally important to do so in moderation.

When a high-pitched Dragon Roar erupted, Ji Lao San suddenly transformed into a Grand Dragon close to 50,000 metres long. The Grand Dragon’s head was held high, and his Dragon Eyes glared at Yang Kai as if staring at an ant on the ground. His whole body was full of thick Dragon Scales, as he was clearly inflamed with rage.

Yang Kai was as small as dust in the face of this Grand Dragon.

“Trivial Human, you dare!” The Grand Dragon roared violently, and the void around him shook. With a disgruntled expression, the colourful-robed young woman on the Parasol Tree lifted her hands to cover her ears.

“How dare you humiliate me like this! You must pay the price with your life in the name of the Dragon Clan!” When Ji Lao San finished speaking, he opened his lips and spat forth his Dragon Breath, enveloping the ant in front of him.

Dragon Breath was the most common attack method of the Dragon Clan. Though common, it was extremely strong, especially when delivered by a Grand Dragon. Even a Feudal Lord would vaporize if hit by such a blast. What’s more, Time Principles were woven into this Dragon Breath, so along with terrifying destructive force, it also seemed like the withering of 1,000 years was carried along with this Secret Technique.

No Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master could survive an attack like this.

After Ji Lao San’s rage had subsided a little, his Dragon Eyes suddenly widened as if he was struck by lightning.

Against the force of his Dragon Breath, there was a figure that was moving upstream. That figure didn’t seem hurried, in fact, it seemed like it was taking a stroll in a garden. Arriving slowly at Ji Lao San’s massive Dragon Head, he put out his hand to tenderly tap it while saying, “Anger will only bring harm to the body, you should calm down!”

With one tap, the majestic and massive Ji Lao San felt his Dragon Vein shiver violently. Being unable to sustain his Dragon Form, his body shrank rapidly and returned back to his Human Form.

Yang Kai once grabbed him by the scruff of his neck, and said while facing the No-Return Pass, “Great Evolution Pass’ Yang Kai has come to the No-Return Pass under the command of the Old Ancestor. Is there anyone here?”

Noise broke out as the No-Return Pass’ gate, which was originally closed, opened.

Yang Kai bowed from a distance before entering, dragging Ji Lao San along with him.

As he entered the Inner Sanctum, figures on both sides stared at him. The young man and woman Yang Kai saw on the Parasol Tree earlier were also present.

Those stares were a mix of scrutiny and curiosity.

Being able to stand here indicated that these people were either Dragons or Phoenixes, and they had long known that there would be a Human with a Dragon Source coming to the No-Return Pass. However, both Clans did not know much about him. They had been defending the No-Return Pass, so all the information from the outside world reached them from word of mouth. Rumours from the 3,000 Worlds or the Black Ink Battlefield.

The Phoenix Clan was relatively carefree compared to the Dragon Clan; after all, this wasn’t their Clan’s business. In fact, they’d all come here to watch the drama play out.

The Dragon Clan was different, however. They didn’t stop Ji Lao San from picking a fight and causing havoc. It was probably because they desired to test this visitor’s skill; after all, a visitor from the Human Race only brought disadvantages to the Dragon Clan.

Rather than testing him though, what made the Dragon Clan speechless was that they didn’t witness how the Human fought against Ji Lao San at all.

Ji Lao San seemed to lose all strength to resist after this Human simply waved his hand.

Since when did the Dragon Clan become so weak? If that was the case, how did the Dragon Clan establish such a domineering reputation?

Apart from being perplexed, what happened to Ji Lao San surprised the whole Dragon Clan.

If they did not have the answer to this question, the Dragon Clan would be unable to sleep comfortably in the future.

Yang Kai couldn’t resist smiling and nodding at the people on both sides, regardless of how powerful or old they were, as if they were all here to greet him.

Though, that was far from the case.

After walking a short distance, another figure blocked his path. It was a woman, who looked at Yang Kai with fiery eyes and Dragon Pressure radiating from her body.

She was also from the Dragon Clan, and a Grand Dragon at that!
