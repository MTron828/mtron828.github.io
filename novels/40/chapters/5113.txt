Unfortunately, Hei Yuan wasn’t here.

Hei Yuan’s Soul had been damaged, so if Yang Kai could find him here, he had the confidence to kill him; however, the void was expansive, so Yang Kai wasn’t even sure where to start looking for him.

Nevertheless, there was nothing he could do at this point.

It was time he returned to Yin-Yang Pass. The Black Ink Clan’s Army was currently besieging the Great Pass, but Yang Kai had no idea about the specifics over there.

Since he had made up his mind, he headed straight towards Yin-Yang Pass. As Space Principles flared, his figure flickered. There weren’t any obstacles along the way. Perhaps the Black Ink Clansmen were too terrified of him now, so they wouldn’t dare to wander about.

Half a day later, just as he was about to leave Hei Yuan’s territory and enter another Territory Lord’s domain, the compass in his hand shook a little all of a sudden.

Although he didn’t find Hei Yuan in his home territory, Yang Kai still held out hope. Perhaps he might find a trace that would lead him to Hei Yuan on his way back, so he kept the compass made by Wang Si Bo on his person the whole time.

Hence, he was pleasantly surprised that it finally reacted.

The vibration was weak; however, Yang Kai was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, and he had been hoping to find Hei Yuan, so he had been paying close attention to the compass. Therefore, the moment the compass vibrated, he immediately noticed it.

Yang Kai abruptly stopped in his tracks and looked down, only to see that the pointer was slightly swaying as it pointed in a particular direction.

His eyes brightened. Since the compass was reacting, it suggested that it had detected the arm ring’s presence. Hei Yuan was always wearing the arm ring on his right arm, so wherever it was, Hei Yuan should be hiding there.

The reason the pointer was swaying was that Hei Yuan was still far away. It was barely within the range where the compass could detect the arm ring, so it could only roughly point out a direction.

That was enough though.

Yang Kai was ecstatic. He initially thought that he would miss the chance to kill Hei Yuan, so he was surprised at the turn of events.

He immediately concealed his aura and charged in the direction that the compass had pointed.

There was no doubt that Hei Yuan was recuperating. Although his Soul had been injured, he was still a Territory Lord; therefore, it wouldn’t be easy to take him down. Yang Kai reckoned that his best hope was to launch a sneak attack on him.

As he got closer, the pointer gradually stabilised and eventually stopped swaying.

Half a day later, Yang Kai hid inside a Black Ink Cloud and silently examined the universe fragment in front of him.

The universe fragment was pretty huge as it was left behind from a shattered Universe World. Such universe fragments were innumerable on the Black Ink Battlefield, especially inside the Black Ink Clan’s territory. Many Feudal Lords and Territory Lords built their bases on such universe fragments.

Hei Yuan’s home territory was also built on a universe fragment.

As Yang Kai observed this place, he realised that there were no Black Ink Clansmen moving around on the universe fragment. Hei Yuan was nowhere in sight, nor could he detect his aura.

However, the compass was pointing in this direction. In other words, Hei Yuan must be hiding in this universe fragment.

After observing for a bit, he still couldn’t find Hei Yuan. Yang Kai frowned and dashed out of the Black Ink Cloud before charging towards the universe fragment.

Since he had no idea where Hei Yuan was, he could only search for him.

He did his best to conceal himself as he moved around the universe fragment like a ghost. Initially, Yang Kai was worried that his whereabouts would be exposed; after all, regardless of how well he could conceal his aura, Hei Yuan might detect his presence in such close proximity. However, after he searched around most of the universe fragment, there was still no reaction from Hei Yuan.

It was only then that Yang Kai set his mind at ease. It seemed that Hei Yuan was indeed badly injured. When a Black Ink Clansman was horribly injured, the best way to recuperate was to enter an unconscious state. In other words, Hei Yuan was probably hibernating somewhere on this universe fragment.

That would allow Yang Kai to make a move with ease.

However, after inspecting most of the places on the universe fragment, he still couldn’t find Hei Yuan. Fortunately, there came a moment when a hint of Black Ink Strength caught his attention.

In the Black Ink Clan’s territory, Black Ink Strength was practically omnipresent. Some of it had even formed into Black Ink Clouds; therefore, Yang Kai didn’t pay attention to this wisp of Black Ink Strength initially.

It wasn’t until he realised there was something off about this particular patch of Black Ink Strength that he decided to examine it.

A moment later, he noticed that the source of the Black Ink Strength was inside the universe fragment; in other words, Hei Yuan was hiding within the universe fragment.

It was no wonder that Yang Kai was unable to find him even after such a long time.

With that thought in mind, he traced the Black Ink Strength and soon found a cave that led to the depths of the universe fragment.

As he held his breath, Yang Kai snuck into the cave and descended for quite some time. The deeper he went, the thicker the Black Ink Strength was. This led him to believe that his judgment was right.

There came a moment when he saw light at the other end of the cave.

There was a huge empty space in the centre of the universe fragment, and as he looked up, Yang Kai couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

That was because there was a several-dozen-metre tall Black Ink Nest in the centre of this universe fragment. Just like the other Black Ink Nests that Yang Kai had seen before, this one looked like a dark flower bud and as it breathed, the entire Black Ink Nest pulsated like a heart.

He was surprised that there was a Black Ink Nest in this place.

One had to know that he had destroyed Hei Yuan’s Black Ink Nest, so supposedly, all the sub-nests bred from it should have withered by now. Why was there still a Black Ink Nest here?

The only possibility was that this Black Ink Nest wasn’t a sub-nest of Hei Yuan’s Black Ink Nest, nor was it a sub-nest of any of the Mid-Rank Black Ink Nests Yang Kai had destroyed.

This might even be another Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest; otherwise, it couldn’t possibly have survived.

However, its scale wasn’t even comparable to the Low-Rank Black Ink Nests. Hei Yuan must have hatched it in a hurry to help him recuperate, so he didn’t have time to grow it yet.

As Yang Kai looked down at the compass, the pointer was pointing at the Black Ink Nest.

[Found you!] Yang Kai stored the compass and examined the Black Ink Nest in front of him.

The entire Black Ink Nest had been sealed up, so it was impossible for him to sneak inside without alerting Hei Yuan.

Nevertheless, Hei Yuan still didn’t react even though Yang Kai was in such close proximity. It seemed that he was really in a state of deep sleep.

Yang Kai took a deep breath and reached out his hand, summoning the Azure Dragon Spear into his grip. The next instant, he madly pushed the power of his Small Universe.

As a Golden Crow cawed, a Great Sun leapt up from behind Yang Kai. Fixing the Great Sun at the tip of his spear, he hurled it towards the Black Ink Nest. At the same time, Space Principles flared, turning the local space viscous, giving Hei Yuan no chance to flee.

Under the Great Sun, the several-dozen-metre tall Black Ink Nest was blown away. Right then, a roar with a hint of fury reverberated across the space. The next instant, a golden light dazzled Yang Kai’s eyes as a ring-shaped light shield appeared and blocked his attack. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

It was the arm ring refined by Wang Si Bo!

Yang Kai long ago realised that the arm ring was a defensive artifact that Hei Yuan wore on his right arm. Although he had been sound asleep, he, as a Territory Lord, still instinctively reacted to the danger the moment Yang Kai launched the attack and the arm ring’s shield was instantly activated.

Wang Si Bo was an Artifact Refining Grandmaster, so the defensive artifact with his unique mark that he had personally refined certainly wouldn’t be weak when it came to its defence.

However, it wasn’t enough to withstand Yang Kai’s attack either; after all, he was significantly more powerful than an average Seventh-Order Master. Furthermore, Golden Crow Casts the Sun was a Divine Manifestation, so ordinary Secret Techniques were not comparable to it.

Under the Great Sun, the golden defence shattered and Yang Kai directly thrust his Azure Dragon Spear towards Hei Yuan’s chest.

It was expected that Hei Yuan was in a terrible mood as he was faced with such an attack right after he awakened. As his power burst forth, he forcefully threw out his fist.

In an instant, the ground cracked and rocks flew around.

The universe fragment, which had been drifting around the void in silence over countless years, was subject to a violent clash, and in the next instant, it exploded into pieces.

Two figures shot out of it. While in mid-air, Yang Kai sprayed out a mouthful of blood, his face as pale as a sheet.

He almost couldn’t bear Hei Yuan’s all-out attack. Some of his ribs were broken and his five viscera and six organs were throbbing. Just like what Wang Si Bo had said, even though Hei Yuan had been weakened, he was still a Territory Lord.

Yang Kai stabilised himself and lifted his gaze, only to see that Hei Yuan was looking furious. There was a hint of puzzlement behind his eyes, as it was apparent that he hadn’t figured out what was going on yet.

The arm ring on his right arm had turned dim with cracks all over it. Most of its spirituality had been lost.

It was only thanks to this arm ring that blocked Yang Kai’s Golden Crow Casts the Sun at the critical moment that his life was saved; otherwise, he could’ve been killed by Yang Kai in that sneak attack.

Even so, blood was still streaming from his chest at this moment as the blow had still hurt him.

A short while later, Hei Yuan figured out what was going on. As he looked up and made out the person who launched a sneak attack on him, he said through clenched teeth, “It’s you!”

Yang Kai spat out the blood in his mouth and sneered, “You’re pretty lucky.”

It was thanks to the arm ring that Wang Si Bo had made for Hei Yuan that Yang Kai could find Hei Yuan. Nevertheless, it was also because of the arm ring that his strike was rendered ineffective. His success and failure were all because of Wang Si Bo.

With that said, he had found Hei Yuan at the very least, and the battle had just started.

“How did you know that I was here?” Hei Yuan was both surprised and shocked as he couldn’t figure it out. The void was vast, and he was hiding inside an empty universe fragment to recuperate. How did Yang Kai discover him?

One had to know that he randomly chose this place to settle down for the time being. No one else was aware of his whereabouts.

Despite that, Yang Kai had still accurately located him and launched a sneak attack on him, which was inconceivable.

“Is it hard to find you?” Yang Kai sneered as he wielded his spear, “I can smell the stench coming from your body even if we’re billions of kilometres apart. So, don’t even think about hiding from me. Wherever you are, I can find you and kill you.”
