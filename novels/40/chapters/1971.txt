Secret Technique, Exile!

Yang Kai knew that if he didn’t use his best cards, he would have no chance to survive this, so he no longer had the luxury of concealing his strength and quickly displayed his Space Force.

In front of him, a black void suddenly opened, like the great maw of an ancient beast, and greedily swallowed up the weakened black flames, exiling it to the endless Void.

Fortunately, the violent and chaotic eruption of power allowed Yang Kai to partially conceal his Secret Technique, making it impossible for the others to completely see through him and instead assume that the explosive collision of their combined might have caused space to collapse momentarily.

At the very least, when Xu Qing and Yu Ruo Mei saw his Exile Secret Technique with their own eyes, they did not immediately associate it with Yang Kai and instead just trembled in shock from the violent explosion.

On the other hand, Mo Xiao Qi, who had been concentrating on preparing her own Secret Technique to activate her artifact, had her eyes light up as she directed a surprised look at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was ignorant of all this, as he was now riding a tiger and had no attention to spare.

If he did not escape now, the Firebird would definitely attack him first, but if he dodged, Mo Xiao Qi would be in danger. This made him curse Mo Xiao Qi mercilessly in his heart while he stood fast, literally acting as a human shield for her.

The successfully combined resistance of Yang Kai, Xu Qing, and Yu Ruo Mei obviously made the Firebird aware that it had encountered a difficult opponent this time. Its red eyes flashed with anger as it spread its wings and sent out a barrage of black fireballs towards the trio obstructing it.

Xu Qing and Yu Ruo Mei both let out shouts as they quickly used their Movement Skills to dodge; unfortunately, the number of fireballs was so great that they were quickly forced to summon their own defensive artifacts in order to gain some sense of security.

Yang Kai’s face also went as black as the bottom of a pot. Xu Qing and Yu Ruo Mei were free to move, but he could only stand in place, so with no other choice, he summoned his Golden Blood Threads to intercept the incoming fireballs.

Although the effect was good, Yang Kai felt a deep sense of bitterness as many of his Golden Blood Threads were damaged or destroyed in the process.

His Golden Blood Threads were all condensed from his own Pure Golden Blood, so each was extremely precious. Having suffered such a huge loss this time, Yang Kai felt like shedding tears of blood.

“Ah, my Cloud Mirror!” Xu Qing’s cried rang out suddenly. Yang Kai took a moment to glance over and saw a mirror-like artifact in Xu Qing’s hand get wrapped in black flames and begin to melt. Flustered but with no other choice, Xu Qing could do nothing but toss away his artifact, lest he be contaminated with the black flames as well.

From the aura fluctuations this mirror gave off, it was obviously an Origin King Grade Mid-Rank artifact!

It seemed Yang Kai was not the only one to suffer heavy losses! While his Golden Blood Threads were damaged, he could still use his Golden Blood to repair it or condense new ones, but Xu Qing’s Origin King Grade artifact being burned down meant it was gone for good.

Seeing this, Yang Kai’s mood suddenly improved a lot.

Not only did Xu Qing lose his Cloud Mirror, the Origin King Grade hairpin artifact Yu Ruo Mei was using was also quickly destroyed by the black flames. The two of them had lost a great deal of wealth at this moment and were feeling a little distraught. Glaring at the Firebird, thick anger and hatred filled their eyes, but frightened by the ferocity of the Firebird, neither of them dared to step forward to challenge it and could only dodge in embarrassment.

*Li...*

The Firebird suddenly cried out, its voice filled with a mix of rage and anger, echoing through the sky.

The moment this voice sounded; everyone’s complexion changed drastically.

Because this cry was very likely going to attract the attention of others. If all the cultivators who had entered the depths of Clear Jade Mountain were brought here, all the efforts their group of four had put in would be taken advantage of by others.

In that brief moment, when Yang Kai lost concentration, a black fireball suddenly arrived right in front of him. Yang Kai’s face sank as he was about to use Exile again, but what he did not expect was that the fireball actually exploded right in front of him, sending out a rain of tiny black fire droplets towards him.

Yang Kai’s eyes shrank suddenly and without any time to hesitate, he directly displayed another of his most powerful Secret Techniques.

Dragon Transformation!

Together with a thunderous dragon roar, a huge illusory dragon head flashed above Yang Kai’s head. At that moment, powerful Dragon Pressure filled the air, causing the Firebird on the opposite side to become dumbfounded as a trace of fear spread across its scarlet eyes.

Pieces of dragon scales emerged and wrapped up most of Yang Kai’s body. Even the True Dragon Scale appeared on Yang Kai’s chest, covering his vital organs.

*Hong Hong Hong...*

A series of bangs rang out as countless black fireballs hit Yang Kai’s body, causing him to spray a mouthful of blood from his mouth. The black flames peppered his physique, burning madly as it quickly began to melt through his protective dragon scales, as if they were snowflakes under the scorching sun.

Yang Kai’s face became incredibly solemn as he desperately urged the power of his Golden Divine Dragon Source to prevent the black flames from spreading.

However, his appearance looked very miserable as his aura dropped noticeably.

“Sister Xiao Qi, I’m at my limit!” Yang Kai said in a fluster as he prepared to abandon his position. He had done his best, and if he remained any longer, his situation would become worrying. He had stood fast to defend Mo Xiao Qi even to the point where his life was in danger, he felt he had done enough.

“I’m ready!” Mo Xiao Qi answered back as she pushed her palms forward. In that instant, the sound of a tsunami burst out from the blue water ball in front of her, giving the illusion that one was standing before a vast ocean that was about to come crashing down on them.

The water sphere burst into innumerable pieces in the next instant, becoming a cloud of mist that rushed forward as if it had come alive.

The mist washed over Yang Kai’s body, extinguishing the burning black flames that had given him so much trouble.

Immediately after, the mist arrived at the Firebird and directly wrapped it up, transforming back into a blue water sphere again.

However, this time, the water sphere was many times larger than before, and no matter how the Firebird struggled inside, it was unable to escape.

Having finished all this, Mo Xiao Qi also seemed to be quite drained, her delicate face somewhat pale as her well-rounded peaks heaved slightly. Using this artifact put a huge strain on her.

Although the price was not small, the result was gratifying.

“Hee hee, I finally caught you, little thing. Let’s see how you try to run away now,” Mo Xiao Qi straightened herself up and smiled as she looked ahead.

Yang Kai’s face suddenly sank as he shouted, “Watch out!”

As he shouted, he quickly flickered away from where he stood just as another figure appeared behind him and sent out a Secret Technique that shattered Yang Kai’s afterimage.

The figure which just appeared frowned deeply, as if he hadn’t expected Yang Kai to see through his sneak attack.

Who else could it be but Xu Qing?

At the same time, the figure of Yu Ruo Mei mysteriously appeared behind Mo Xiao Qi as a violent power burst from her slender palm. A cruel and greedy smile flashed across her coquettish face as she palmed directly towards Mo Xiao Qi’s exposed back.

Mo Xiao Qi let out a horrible cry as she spat out a mouthful of blood as she was sent flying forward, her beautiful eyes flashing a look of utter shock and disbelief.

“Ahh!” Mo Xiao Qi’s screams and Yu Ruo Mei’s screams sounded simultaneously.

Although her sneak attack had hit its mark, Yu Ruo Mei felt like she had been hit equally hard somehow and was also sent flying backwards, her pretty face turning pale as she felt the ache from her palm. Upon landing, she lifted her hand up and cried out in surprise, “How can this be? What is this?”

A strange mark had appeared on her palm at some point. This mark looked like an extremely menacing face and contained a terrifying power that caused her to feel like she was hearing endless wailing screams in her ears.

The eyes of the strange face suddenly glowed a gloomy light, and in the next moment, Yu Ruo Mei felt like she saw a mighty existence staring down at her indifferently.

After falling silent, she shuddered before collapsing to the ground.

“Ruo Mei, what happened?” On the other side, Xu Qing, whose attack had failed, saw Yu Ruo Mei fall to the ground and could not help calling out.

Yu Ruo Mei’s expression was blank as she lay on the ground sluggishly. If someone used their Divine Sense to invade her Knowledge Sea at this moment, they would see a phantom there that greatly resembled the mark on her palm madly devouring her Spiritual Energy and as her Soul was being drained, the light from her eyes also began to dim.

On the other side, Mo Xiao Qi stood up while coughing lightly. Judging from her state, although she had suffered a sneak attack, it was obviously not a big problem. Turning her head and looking at Yu Ruo Mei blankly, she asked in a completely confused and disbelieving tone, “Why did you suddenly attack me?”

The look of distress from being betrayed was so authentic it really did not seem like she was acting.

It was like she really had been attacked from behind by her most trusted of companions. If it was not for the powerful protective Artifact Armour she was wearing, she would likely be dead right now.

“You really are a stupid woman,” Yang Kai looked at her like she was an idiot.

Mo Xiao Qi turned her head to look at Yang Kai, her big eyes turning watery as she asked him, “How am I stupid?”

Yang Kai could not help rubbing his forehead with his palm, really not knowing how to explain it to her.

“What did you do to her?” Xu Qing was unable to get a response from Yu Ruo Mei no matter how he called out so he could only turn to ask Mo Xiao Qi.

Mo Xiao Qi’s tender body trembled as a look of fear appeared on her face, waving her hands in a flustered manner as she said, “I didn’t do anything to her... The Artifact Armour I’m wearing automatically applies a Wicked Ghost Seal to anyone who attacks me, so she... she...”

Yang Kai was stunned once again!

Did this woman really just reveal the secrets behind her defences?

At this point, he was finally able to determine that this girl named Mo Xiao Qi was not some kind of old witch who was playing innocent in order to deceive them, but rather a real innocent naïve little girl!

Could she really be only as old as she looked on the surface?

Yang Kai was taken aback as this thought emerged in his heart. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

If that was so, it was truly terrifying.

“Wicked Ghost Seal?” Xu Qing frowned. Obviously, he had never heard of this Secret Technique, but soon, he shook his head lightly and declared, “It matters not! Now there is one fewer person to split the spoils between. Good, this Xu can reap all the benefits for himself!”

No longer paying any attention to whether Yu Ruo Mei lived or died, he instead began to laugh wickedly.

Yang Kai sneered as he called out sarcastically, “Brother Xu, where is all your confidence coming from? Are you not able to see the situation clearly? There’s two of us but only one of you here.”
