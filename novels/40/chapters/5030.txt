Bai Yi was shocked, “I can’t believe that a World Tree’s clone has such amazing effects.”

“En,” Yang Kai let out a sigh, “When I planted the root back then, I just wanted to save my homeland from falling apart. I didn’t have any clue about the benefits it would bring, and that almost caused a crisis sometime later.”

The World Tree’s clone was immensely beneficial to the Star Boundary as all the living creatures there benefited from its presence; therefore, there were a lot of talented people who appeared in the Star Boundary over the years. Previously rare, Heaven-defying geniuses were now everywhere in the Star Boundary.

Since a clone was already so useful to a Universe World, what would happen if a cultivator planted one in their Small Universe? Fundamentally, a cultivator’s Small Universe could be considered a Universe World as well.

Many people had speculated that one would benefit greatly if he could do so.

The envoys from the Cave Heavens and Paradises who were stationed in the Star Boundary had tried to obtain roots from the World Tree’s clone and plant them inside their Small Universes.

Without fail though, none of these roots survived.

Therefore, the foreign affairs envoys speculated that only a root obtained from the Mother tree could be turned into a clone while the root hairs acquired from a clone could not survive.

Since the World Tree’s clone before their eyes was fully grown, it suggested that the Sealed World’s owner had previously obtained a root from the real World Tree, just like what Yang Kai had done. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, while Yang Kai planted the root in the Star Boundary, this person planted it in their Small Universe.

Bai Yi looked up and muttered, “If this is the World Tree’s clone, could the fruits on its branches be World Fruits?”

It wasn’t certain how long this World Tree’s clone had lived, but it was full of fragrant Spirit Fruits. They could see that there were countless Spirit Fruits hanging on the branches.

It was just like what Yang Kai saw when he came across the real World Tree in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary.

The question of whether a World Tree’s clone could bear World Fruits had been troubling the Open Heaven Realm Masters of the Cave Heavens and Paradises. Many speculated that it could bear fruits, but they were not certain when it would happen.

Yang Kai had also been looking forward to the day when the World Tree in the Star Boundary would bear fruits; however, it had only been a short time since the World Tree was planted, so it hadn’t shown any signs of bearing fruits.

The one in the Sealed World had verified their speculations.

The clone could also bear World Fruits; a lot of them in fact.

“Yes, they’re World Fruits,” Yang Kai nodded, “But… they’re slightly different from real World Fruits.”

Bai Yi asked curiously, “What’s the difference?”

Yang Kai shook his head as he couldn’t really tell; however, he could see that the World Fruits hanging on this fruit tree were indeed different from the ones he saw in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. The most glaring difference was that the World Fruits here were much smaller.

“This discovery is very important. Junior Sister, you stay here while I inform Division Commander Cha about it so that he can send more people to this place,” Yang Kai said.

“Understood,” Bai Yi nodded.

It was then that Yang Kai pushed his Space Principles and disappeared from the spot.

The next instant, he appeared before the Sealed World’s portal and dashed out of it.

Meanwhile, Cha Hu was standing on the deck of Dawning Light monitoring the surroundings to prevent any Black Ink Clansmen from attacking them. Fortunately, the Black Ink Clan seemed to have given up on this area after the last great battle here. Not even a single Black Ink Clansman had been spotted in this area for some time now.

The moment Yang Kai appeared, Cha Hu turned to look at him.

As the younger man got closer, Cha Hu asked with a frown, “What’s wrong?”

Seeing that Yang Kai had returned alone while Bai Yi was nowhere in sight, he thought that they had encountered some danger in the Sealed World.

“Sir,” Yang Kai cupped his fist, “Junior Sister Bai and I have discovered something critical in the Sealed World we were exploring,” He then recounted what he had seen.

Upon hearing that, Cha Hu became excited, “Are you sure it’s a World Tree’s clone?”

Yang Kai replied, “There’s one in my homeland, so I can recognise it. Additionally, there are a lot of rare Spirit Herbs in the medicine garden. I can’t even recognise some of them, so I don’t dare to rashly harvest them. You’ll have to head over and make a decision, Sir.”

Cha Hu nodded, “In that case, I definitely have to take a look.”

After that, he told two Squads who had just returned to follow him. There were a lot of herbs and a World Tree in an ancient medicine garden, so they would need a lot of time and manpower to harvest them. It was definitely better to bring more people with him.

They soon passed through the portal and streamed into the Sealed World.

Since there wasn’t a need to explore anything, they headed straight to the medicine garden, and an incense stick later they arrived.

Bai Yi stepped forward to salute him but Cha Hu waved his hand to stop her before his gaze fixed on the World Tree’s clone.

The members of the two Squads exclaimed as well. Although they had respectively explored a Sealed World each and acquired some treasures, they had never seen anything as magnificent as this.

The medicine garden was covered in Spirit Medicines, some they could identify, and some they could not, and in the middle of the garden stood a World Tree clone that was full of World Fruits.

They had all heard about the World Tree before, but none of them had ever seen it. All of them grew curious as they examined the World Fruits. This couldn’t be helped, as it was said that World Fruits could allow an Open Heaven Realm Master to directly ascend to the next Order and increase the natural limits of their aptitude.

It was expected that they drooled over such treasures. If an Open Heaven Realm Master, whose upper limit was the Seventh Order, could consume a High-Rank World Fruit, he would instantly make it to the Eighth Order. On the Black Ink Battlefield, an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master would be a Division Commander.

It had to be noted that there were over 20,000 soldiers in Blue Sky Pass, but there were only a few dozen Eighth-Order Division Commanders, and each one was immensely important to the Human race as a whole.

If an Open Heaven Realm Master, whose limit was the Eighth Order, could consume a High-Rank World fruit, they would become an Old Ancestor, a powerhouse that could tilt the entire direction of the war against the Black Ink Clans.

Even a powerful Master like Cha Hu felt his emotions undulating.

However, he soon pulled himself together and ordered the two Squads to begin harvesting the herbs in the medicine garden. They were ordered not to touch the ones they couldn’t recognise as he would find a way to deal with them later.

On the other hand, he led Yang Kai to approach the World Tree’s clone.

A moment later, he said, “I remember that when you arrived at Blue Sky Pass for the first time, you said that you had seen the World Tree in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary and even obtained some World Fruits.”

Yang Kai had indeed told the Eighth-Order Masters about his past experiences, so this wasn’t really a secret among the Army and Division Commanders in the Inner Sanctum.

“Indeed,” Yang Kai nodded, “Back then, I directly ascended to the Fifth Order, then made it to the Sixth Order after consuming a Mid-Rank World Fruit.”

Cha Hu asked, “Since you think this is a World Tree, could the fruits on the tree be World Fruits as well?”

Yang Kai nodded again, “There’s no doubt about it. However, this is not the Mother Tree; it’s just a clone. Although the fruits on this tree are indeed World Fruits, they’re different from the ones I’ve acquired.”

“How are they different?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “I can’t really tell, but I do have some Low-Rank World Fruits with me. Please take a look, Sir.”

Upon finishing his words, Yang Kai fished out a Low-Rank World Fruit and passed it to Cha Hu.

When he was in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary back then, he acquired 3 Mid-Rank and 13 Low-Rank World Fruits. He passed Lu Xue and Yue He a Mid-Rank World Fruit each, and he consumed the remaining one. It could be said that they had been put to good use.

On the other hand, he had given Guo Zi Yan a Low-Rank World Fruit so that the latter could ascend from the Second-Order to the Third-Order Open Heaven Realm directly. He didn’t give out any of the other Low-Rank Word Fruits as they were not really valuable.

That said, Yang Kai had consumed some Low-Rank World Fruits while fighting his enemies before. Although they were useless for raising his Order, they could replenish a large amount of a cultivator’s World Force in short order with no side effects. They were vastly superior to any kind of restorative Spirit Pill in that regard.

Yang Kai still had some Low-Rank World Fruits on him.

After taking the Low-Rank World Fruit, Cha Hu examined it and looked up at the fruits on the tree; then, he furrowed his brows.

The ones on the tree were indeed different as they were much smaller than the World Fruit passed to him by Yang Kai.

“So, do you think the fruits on this tree have the amazing effects that we’ve heard from the rumours?” Cha Hu suddenly asked.

After giving it a thought, Yang Kai shook his head, “I wouldn’t dare to make a speculation. After all, I haven’t consumed one before. Regardless, this is a clone, so the fruits are definitely not comparable to the ones hanging on the Mother Tree.”

Cha Hu nodded gently and passed the Low-Rank World Fruit back to Yang Kai, “Regardless, the fruits must be extremely valuable. We should pick them first and then let the people back in the Inner Sanctum study them.”

He then turned to Yang Kai and asked, “Is there anything I have to take note of when picking these fruits?”

After pondering on it for a moment, Yang Kai replied, “Back then, every time I picked a World Fruit in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, I had to go through a kind of reincarnation. In essence, each fruit contained an entire World with its own Principles; however, that was the case for the Mother tree, I’m not sure if it’s the same for this clone.”

Cha Hu chuckled, “Interesting. Well, we’ll know once we try.”

“Yes,” Yang Kai replied.

They then started picking the fruits.

Yang Kai was initially wary that he would have to go through a reincarnation again just like what happened in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary; however, when he picked the World Fruit nearest to him, he only fell into a dazed state while a mysterious World Force clashed with his Soul in an attempt to pull him in. He only resisted for a bit and became safe; he didn’t really fall into that World.

It seemed that the fruits on the clone tree had also inherited the characteristics of the fruits on the Mother tree, but they were not nearly as profound or abstruse as the ones on the latter.

Perhaps it also had something to do with the fact that Yang Kai had become stronger as well. In the past, he was only an Emperor Realm Master who had just condensed his Dao Seal when he was in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. Now, he was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

When he turned to look at Cha Hu, he realised that the latter wasn’t affected at all. The fruits just instantly disappeared from the tree wherever the older man went.

Yang Kai quickly pulled himself together and continued picking the fruits.

There were more than 1,000 fruits on the tree, but they were soon fully picked. Yang Kai didn’t intend to keep any of them and just passed all the fruits he had picked to Cha Hu.
