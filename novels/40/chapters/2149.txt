“Does this Sister know me?” Yang Kai wondered as he glanced towards the young woman from Star Soul Palace.

Of the two voices that had called out just now, one of them was Xiao Bai Yi, while the other was actually this woman.

[Why would she shout something like that if she did not know me?]

But what Yang Kai didn’t expect was that the female disciple just smiled slightly, shook her head, and said, “I mistook you for someone else.”

Lan Xun said this because although she remembered Yang Kai’s appearance, he naturally would not recognize her.

That time in the third layer of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, Lan Xun was using her False Face Bead to change her appearance, so what Yang Kai had seen was not her true appearance.

“Uh...” Yang Kai was speechless, but quickly composed himself and turned to Xiao Bai Yi, “Xiao Bai, you’re here as well, huh? The world is really too small!”

Blue veins bulged on Xiao Bai Yi’s forehead as he snapped, “Do you want to die?”

Murong Xiao Xiao pursed her lips, smiled, and slightly nodded at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai said, “Why are you acting so indifferently? It’s rare for everyone to meet here. Ah, it must be destiny!”

Xiao Bai Yi coldly snorted, “Who wants to share destiny with you? But it is unexpected and somewhat impressive that you could escape the pursuit of the Flame Beast.”

Although he had given a compliment, it was filled with ridicule and sarcasm.

At that time, the Flame Beast from the Realm of Summer had been hopping mad, and despite there being so many people fleeing from it, it had chosen to focus on Yang Kai, so many had thought Yang Kai was doomed to die; even Xiao Bai Yi thought so.

After all, even Wu Chang had been forced to flee from this Monster Beast, so how could Yang Kai, a First-Order Dao Source Realm, survive?

But now, Yang Kai appeared unscathed in the Two Seasons Mountain Range, a true surprise.

Hearing the words ‘Flame Beast’, the expressions of the man and a woman from Star Soul Palace also changed slightly. Obviously, from their Sect’s records, they knew about the existence of this Monster Beast which was comparable to an Emperor Realm cultivator.

Wu Chang also raised his brows, revealing a look of surprise.

He couldn’t understand how such a weak cultivator could escape from the pursuit of the Flame Beast! During the previous incident, if the group from Azure Sun Temple had not attracted the Flame Beast’s attention, he would have been in big trouble.

“It’s nothing much!” Yang Kai put on a humble look, “Fleeing just happens to be my strong point!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

When he spoke these words, rather than looking ashamed, he instead appeared rather proud of himself, causing Xiao Bai Yi to stare at him for some time.

“Enough nonsense,” At that moment, the unknown young man wearing dark robes from an unknown Sect interrupted with a shout before coldly shouted at Yang Kai, “Hand over that Star Seal or die!”

From his tone, he ‘kindly’ wanted to let Yang Kai leave as long as Yang Kai cooperated. Facing such an arrogant and domineering request, which was made so naturally, Yang Kai couldn’t help turning and staring.

The other party just stared back at him coldly, without the slightest intention of avoiding his gaze.

The pair from Star Soul Palace didn’t interfere, and although the handsome man frowned somewhat unhappily, the young woman’s beautiful eyes lit up with interest, as if waiting to watch a good show.

“Although it’s a bit late now, I still want to ask... how should I address Your Excellency?” Yang Kai looked at the youth with a smile, not showing any anger on the surface.

While speaking, he had already sent a message into the Small Sealed World to ask Hua Qing Si to help him identify the man and woman from Star Soul Palace. After all, Star Soul Palace was her Sect, so she should recognize these two people.

The dark-clothed youth coldly snorted and replied, “Eight Paths Sect, Luo Yuan!”

“So, it was Brother Luo, I’ve long heard of and admired you. It seems I’ve been quite disrespectful!” Yang Kai put on a look of surprise, as if he had really heard of him before when in fact, he hadn’t even heard of Eight Paths Sect.

The contempt and disdain on Xiao Bai Yi’s face grew markedly as he snorted, “Fortunately you’re not one of my Azure Sun Temple’s disciples, otherwise I would have already taken action to clean up the Sect!”

“Hehe...” Yang Kai laughed before his expression suddenly twitched slightly.

At that moment, he obtained an answer from Hua Qing Si from his Embodiment. Unexpectedly, this pair from Star Soul Palace had incredible backgrounds.

That man was the son of Xiao Yu Yang, Xiao Chen!

Xiao Yu Yang had a powerful Second-Order Emperor Realm cultivation and held the post of a Star Soul Palace Silver Star Envoy, making him famous across the entire Southern Territory. It could be said that a tiger father begets no dogs. Xiao Yu Yang was powerful and respected, so his son naturally was not mediocre. He, Wu Chang, Xia Sheng, Zhuang Bu Fan, and a few others were considered the top rising stars of the Southern Territory.

Xiao Chen’s background was powerful and impressive, but the young woman’s background was far scarier.

She was actually the one and only gem of the Bright Moon Great Emperor, Princess Lan Xun!

She was the most sought after woman for young bachelors in the entire Southern Territory, possibly even the entire Star Boundary. If such a woman were to marry into one’s house, that house would undoubtedly prosper for a thousand years!

With the Bright Moon Great Emperor as a father-in-law, a man could walk sideways across the entire Star Boundary. Who would dare to despise or provoke such an existence?

But... Although Princess Lan Xun’s status was unrivalled, she rarely appeared outside, hence ordinary cultivators would never get a chance to see her. Yang Kai hadn’t expected that with her identity and status, Lan Xun would come to the Four Seasons Realm for life experience, much less with a cultivation only equal to his own.

[Is the Bright Moon Great Emperor not afraid of what might happen to his precious daughter in the Four Seasons Realm?]

Thinking up to here, Yang Kai glanced at Xiao Chen again. With this flower protector present, any danger would have to get past him first before it touched Lan Xun.

These thoughts flashed across Yang Kai’s mind and while everyone caught his expression change slightly, none of them knew what he was thinking about. They only thought that he was frightened by Xiao Bai Yi’s words, causing them to further despise him.

Yang Kai lowered his gaze to the diamond-shaped brand on the back of his hand and muttered to himself, “So this thing really is a Star Seal...”

Just now, he had some faint speculations that this thing was an entry pass to the Shattered Star Sea, but Wu Chang and the others had appeared before he could sort out his thoughts or verify it in any way.

Fortunately, Luo Yuan’s words confirmed his guess for him.

The Star Seal had actually appeared on the forehead of a Monster Beast, so after it was killed by Yang Kai, it had been transferred to his hand and in such an obvious position... It was unlikely that Yang Kai could avoid trouble in this situation.

Adjusting himself, he suddenly called out to Wu Chang, “Brother Wu Chang, you and the others are future leaders of the Southern Territory, are you really going to let some unknown little man from a small Sect act so arrogant and presumptuous in front of you? If word of this were to spread out, what face would Brother Wu Chang have left?”

Wu Chang looked at Yang Kai indifferently and remained unmoved. Although he had a short temper and a violent personality, he had cultivated to the Third-Order Dao Source Realm so he was no fool. How could he not see that Yang Kai was trying to sow discord to alleviate his own situation?

Wu Chang just coldly snorted and replied, “Although I don’t like this guy’s arrogance, I agree with his sentiment! Hand over the Star Seal, otherwise... I’ll take it myself.”

Yang Kai heard this, scratched his head involuntarily and said, “So, what the two of you are saying is that... you are going to rob me?”

At this point, he looked over at Lan Xun and Xiao Chen, and asked, “Is your Star Soul Palace also going to participate in this affair?”

Lan Xun smiled slightly and said, “I’m afraid I can’t do anything to help you, but I can at least guarantee that I won’t rob you!”

Xiao Chen didn’t speak and just coldly snorted. The contempt in his eyes grew even stronger as he couldn’t understand why Princess Lan Xun seemed to care about this unknown man. Moreover, the words that Yang Kai spoke just now made him aware of some problems as well.

With Lan Xun making her position clear, Yang Kai could only sigh helplessly and say, “If it were possible, I would be happy to hand over this Star Seal, but... I don’t know how to get it off the back of my hand. Do you two have any suggestions?”

“It’s simple!” Wu Chang answered immediately in a calm tone, “Cut off your hand.”

“Good!” Luo Yuan nodded, “Your hand or your life? Choose!”

Yang Kai paled in fright as he shouted, “I... I want both! Is there any other way that’s... safer?”

Luo Yuan coldly snorted, “How could there be such a cheap bargain in this world? It seems that you don’t want either. Good, then I’ll make the decision for you!”

Saying so, he pushed his Source Qi, took a step forward, and rapidly closed in on Yang Kay. A golden light condensed on his palm as he slammed it towards Yang Kai’s chest.

As soon as Luo Yan made a move, Wu Chang also moved. Now that the Star Seal was on the back of Yang Kai’s hand, whoever killed him first would obtain it.

With Wu Chang’s arrogant and proud temperament, how could he tolerate Luo Yuan seizing the advantage?

So, he suddenly appeared behind Yang Kai, his hand turning pure white and exuding an extreme chill as he punched towards Yang Kai’s back.

The two Third-Order Dao Source Realm masters were merciless in their attacks, both wanting to swiftly kill their prey, not even caring about how they appeared in front of the others present.

After all, the Star Seal would transfer to whoever killed the current carrier, so they needed to act fast.

“Junior Brother Yang!” Murong Xiao Xiao’s pretty face paled as she exclaimed, “Quickly run!”

Xiao Bai Yi also frowned. He hadn’t expected Wu Chang and Luo Yuan to act so decisively and ruthlessly, attacking with full intent to kill.

Although he didn’t like Yang Kai, and he even said that he would teach him a lesson in the Four Seasons Realm, it was still true that Yang Kai had entered the Four Seasons Realm together with Azure Sun Temple. Since he had occupied one of Azure Sun Temple’s entry quotas, any extra Star Seals Yang Kai obtained would be handed over to the temple.

If for no other reason than this, Xiao Bai Yi couldn’t sit back and watch Yang Kai be killed in front of him! Otherwise, once an investigation occurred, he wouldn’t be able to feign ignorance or remain uninvolved. Although Yang Kai’s death was of no importance to him, whether he lived or died would affect the Sect’s interests.

Unfortunately... by the time Xiao Bai Yi reacted, it was too late to intervene!

On the other hand, Lan Xun’s pretty face also changed slightly, showing a slightly disappointed look. In her opinion, Yang Kai would definitely die, and she couldn’t save him, otherwise, she would be deeply offending Wu Chang.

“Overconfidence!” Xiao Chen just let out a cold snort as he watched from the side.

*Hong...*

With a loud bang, Wu Chang and Luo Yuan, who had sandwiched Yang Kai with their attacks from the front and back, both showed stunned expressions. The two felt a huge impact force at the same time and were both involuntarily forced back a couple dozen metres before they managed to stabilize themselves.
