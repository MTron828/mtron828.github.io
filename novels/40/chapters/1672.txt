The child who was brought up was only two or three years old and still had his baby fat, making him look quite cute.

However, being treated so roughly, the child was naturally crying and kicking violently.

Among the crowd of onlookers below, a man who looked about thirty years old who, after hearing the child’s cry shook noticeably and he called out in a sad and shill voice, “My Son!”

A few days ago, his son had disappeared from home inexplicably and the man had no idea who had abducted his child.

Only now, did he realize that the one who had abducted his child was none other than Shadow Moon Hall.

Did that mean the rumours were true?

During this period, many children under the age of five, as well as many young beautiful girls had disappeared strangely from Heavenly Fate City. All of their families had searched frantically, but none had ever found anything. In private, everyone speculated that Shadow Moon Hall was behind this; after all, the only ones capable of committing such brazen acts and remaining anonymous was Shadow Moon Hall.

But guesses, in the end, were just guesses, and there was nothing they could do without any evidence, not to mention that the current Shadow Moon Hall was no longer the same as before. No one dared question Shadow Moon Hall and could only choke down their frustrations and suspicions while weeping silently.

Now, his child had suddenly appeared in front of him, so the middle-aged man was naturally quite excited and hurried forward.

His cultivation was not very high, only Third-Order Transcendent, not even reaching the Saint Realm.

Ordinarily, he would never dare act presumptuously in front of masters from Shadow Moon Hall but seeing the child he had lost appear before him, he could not be bothered with such considerations.

Leaping out from the crowd, he flew directly towards the high platform.

“Impudence!” A loud shout rang out and a stream of light flashed. The middle-aged man let out a scream mid-air as a bloody hole appeared in his chest. A moment later, a fresh corpse hit the ground below.

There was an immediate uproar as the crowd of onlookers stared, trembling in fear and horror.

“Daring to act presumptuously in front of Senior Fang, he deserved death! If there is another offender, one hundred will pay the same price!” The cultivator who acted just now shouted.

The residents of Heavenly Fate City wore expressions of grief and anger, but none dared raise their voices.

At this time, the three-year-old child had been brought before the boy surnamed Fang.

The teenage looking youth looked the child up and down with satisfaction before waving his hand gently.

Immediately, a glamorously dressed young woman wearing heavy makeup came out from behind him, her waist twisting like a water snake and a cold but coquettish smile adorning her lips.

“What are you trying to do?” Fei Zhi Tu suddenly asked.

Standing atop the high platform, although he could not use his strength, he still glared sharply at the boy.

The teenager grinned but did not answer, apparently thinking that a prisoner like Fei Zhi Tu was not qualified to talk to him.

Instead, a high-level traitor from Shadow Moon Hall grinned meaningfully and snickered, “Senior Brother Fei, you’d best hold your tongue. Just quietly enjoy the last moments of your life.”

After delivering this snide comment, the man stopped paying attention to Fei Zhi Tu.

The young woman came up to the child, stretched out her hand to grab his delicate little wrist, then stretched out her scarlet tongue and licked her lips seductively. Lightly opening her mouth, she then spoke, “En, this blood sacrifice is quite tender, it will definitely satisfy Senior’s taste.”

“Do it,” The boy surnamed Fang ordered faintly.

The young woman bowed lightly before flicking her wrist to summon a cold looking dagger into her hand. Gently, she then cut the child’s wrist, drawing fresh blood out from the wound.

In the young woman’s other hand, a glass cup appeared that she put under the child’s wrist to catch the flowing blood.

*Dida... dida...*

The sound of dripping blood and the sorrowful cries of the young child pierced everyone’s heart, and the crowd was instantly filled with righteous indignation, their eyes nearly spitting fire.

“You depraved monsters! You will die like dogs!” Fei Zhi Tu roared, struggling against his shackles as he tried to rush over and save the child, but before he could even take a step, he was knocked to the ground by a cultivator on the high platform and stomped on several times.

The young man surnamed Fang glanced over at Fei Zhi Tu coldly and said with a grin, “You’re just a defeated dog, what right do you have to speak to me? However, you can rest assured, this is just the beginning for you. After cutting off your head, this King will bestow you a new life!”

What he said seemed contradictory, and many in the crowd did not understand, but to Fei Zhi Tu these words were akin to the whispers of hell. From the ground where he was still being beaten, he shouted, “Fang Feng Qi, even if I die, I won’t let you off!”

The teenager simply sneered back, “When you become a member of my Corpse Spirit Race, you won’t think so; in fact, you will also come to know the joys of such blood meals!”

While talking, he took the glass full of blood from the young woman’s hand, put it under his nose, sniffed it lightly, then with an intoxicated look on his face, immediately raised his hand and drank the hot liquid down.

The onlookers were all shocked.

Countless pairs of eyes stared blankly as traces of blood leaked from the corner of Fang Feng Qi’s mouth. It was like all of them had been struck by lightning, their bodies freezing in place.

[He... drank blood? What is this Corpse Spirit Race he spoke of?]

The scene before them was beyond their realm of understanding, and at this moment, Fang Feng Qi was undoubtedly the incarnation of evil in their eyes, a frightful existence that many lost the courage to look towards.

Fei Zhi Tu struggled even harder as his eyes flashed with indescribable hatred, staring at Fang Feng Qi as if he wanted to tear him into ten thousand pieces.

“An excellent flavour!” Fang Feng Qi wiped the blood from his lips before stretching out his hand. In the next instant, the coquettish young woman knelt in front of him and stretched out her scarlet tongue to lick his fingers clean.

A seductive moan leaked from her lips as she performed this act.

As for the child whose blood had been drawn, he now looked languid, without the strength to even cry anymore, his face deathly pale. Immediately, the Saint King Realm cultivator who had brought him took him away.

Although this child was in no immediate danger of dying, after suffering such trauma at the mere age of three, a deep wound would be inflicted on his soul, one he would perhaps never be able to recover from.

“Good, the hour has come. Fei Zhi Tu, your new life awaits. This is a special gift to you from the Religion Master, you should be grateful!” Fang Feng Qi stood up and announced.

After drinking the glass of blood, his originally pale face showed an abnormal blush and his aura burgeoned unnaturally.

Fei Zhi Tu let out a wild laugh hearing this, “I, Fei Zhi Tu, swear here that even if I become an evil spirit in the future, I will kill all of you animals! Mark my words!”

As he said so, his gaze swept over the traitors from Shadow Moon Hall one by one with a vengeful expression.

“Well said!” An angry voice suddenly boomed, disrupting the desolate atmosphere of the square.

“Who!?” Fang Feng Qi’s expression changed drastically as he hastily looked towards the sky.

His instincts were warning him that this intruder’s strength was extremely high. What’s more, this newcomer had managed to approach so close without him noticing. Fang Feng Qi’s strength was already on par with a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters, so only someone at the very peak of the Third-Order Origin Realm could deceive his senses.

“That’s...” Fei Zhi Tu froze for a moment before a fierce grin formed on his face.

He was certain the one who spoke just now was Qian Tong!

Up in the sky, with a flicker, Qian Tong appeared.

“Great Elder!” The Shadow Moon Hall traitors shouted with horror on their faces.

“Hmph, you dare call me Great Elder still?” Qian Tong faintly swept his eyes across all these traitors, making them feel as if a great mountain was pressing down on them, nearly making it impossible for them to breathe.

Two streams of light quickly arrived after; naturally, it was Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er.

When they saw the terrible state Fei Zhi Tu was in, they immediately shouted, “Martial Uncle Fei!”

“Chang’er, Xuan’er!” Fei Zhi Tu looked at the two rising stars of Shadow Moon Halls and exclaimed. During this time, he had not been able to contact Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er, so he had no idea what their situation was. Now that he saw they were unscathed, he felt a weight lift from his heart.

“Go and rescue your Martial Uncle Fei,” Qian Tong ordered.

“Yes!” Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er flew down to the high platform without hesitation.

The cultivator who was in charge of guarding Fei Zhi Tu was a bit at a loss for a moment, not knowing how he was supposed to react. While he was hesitating, Wei Gu Chang kicked him flying, “Scram!”

“Bold! Wei Gu Chang, how dare you act with such impudence in front of Senior Fang!” Immediately, someone scolded him loudly.

Wei Gu Chang simply sneered while guarding Dong Xuan’er, who was freeing Fei Zhi Tu from his shackles, snapping back at the man who called out, “Yuan Qi, I, Wei Gu Chang always respected you, but all of that was in vain as you turned out to be nothing but a coward who covets life while fearing death! Not only did you degenerate into a dog for our hated enemies, you even betrayed and entrapped Martial Uncle Fei! Since I met you today, I will be sending you to your grave!”

The cultivator named Yuan Qi turned bright red after hearing Wei Gu Chang pronouncements as he snapped back, “What do you count for? You’d best keep such nonsense to yourself.”

Wei Gu Chang seemed to want to say something back, but Qian Tong indifferently cut in, “Don’t bother with them, there’s no need to speak with dead men.”

Wei Gu Chang thought about it seriously before nodding, “Great Elder is correct.”

Yuan Qi was annoyed and wanted to retort when something in Qian Tong’s hand suddenly caught his eye. After looking at it carefully, his expression changed drastically, “Hall Master?”

He hadn’t realized until this time that the thing Qian Tong was holding was actually Xie Chen!

Or rather, it was Xie Chen without any arms or legs!

What’s more, Xie Chen was clearly still alive, his expression filled with pain, as if he was being eaten alive by thousands of ants, a tragic sight to behold.

Hearing what he said, the others also finally reacted. Upon seeing Xie Chen’s miserable state, as if catching a glimpse of their own future, each of them couldn’t help feeling a chill and quietly moving closer to Fang Feng Qi, as if seeking some sense of security.

Qian Tong casually threw what remained of Xie Chen onto the high platform before commanding lightly, “This old master does not want to stain his hands with too much blood of his former comrades. I give you one chance, commit suicide and spare yourself some suffering!”

Everyone trembled.

“Old Ghost Qian, why are you blabbering on and on? We need to leave here quickly!” Fei Zhi Tu shouted nervously.

Qian Tong was truly strong, but there were too many enemies here, so he wasn’t confident Qian Tong could handle them all. If Qian Tong also fell here, it would be a real tragedy.
