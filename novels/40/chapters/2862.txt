“What the hell did you do to me?” Sha Ya asked, gritting her teeth, panting slightly, feeling as if she was shrouded with despair.

She had been trying to escape for several hours now, but sadly, Sha Ya found that no matter how hard she tried, she could not leave a several-dozen-kilometre radius. It was as if she was constantly running around in a big circle, and would always inexplicably run into this Shaman Niu again and again.

A powerful Soul was innate to her Charm Demon Clan, so she initially thought that she was under a Shamanic Spell and was experiencing an illusion, but after repeated inspections, she found that it was not the case.

This was not an illusion, and she didn’t feel any kind of abnormality in her surroundings, but she always returned to her starting point.

This inexplicable encounter terrified her just as much as the inexplicable power Shaman Niu had shown before.

Her eyes dimmed, as if it was covered by hopeless darkness.

Frightened, she gave up the idea of running away, because several hours of effort made her understand that she simply could not!

“I told you before, I control this world. If I want you to live, you live, and if I want you to die, you die.” When the words fell, Yang Kai took a small step forward.

Sha Ya felt like that foot was stepping on her heart and opened her mouth to spit out a mouthful of blood.

Hovering in mid-air, Yang Kai walked towards her one step at a time. His expression was vague without the slightest emotion, and with each step, the aura around Sha Ya’s body weakened further, causing blood to spurt wildly from her mouth.

It seemed that the whole world was against Sha Ya, rejecting her existence, and vowed to not stop until she was crushed into dust.

At the brink of death, Sha Ya made the wisest choice she could. She suddenly fell on one knee, her expression extremely pious, and pleaded, “Sir, please spare my life. Sha Ya is willing to pledge her life to you!”

She was a smart person, so it was not difficult to guess Shaman Niu’s intentions here. Since this Shaman Niu did not covet her beautiful body and was also not in a hurry to kill her, then there was only one explanation for his actions, he wanted to subdue her!

Therefore, Sha Ya lowered her head immediately when she knew that she could not escape and could no longer resist. She did not have any unyielding pride; rather, she would do anything to survive. This was the instinct of all beings.

Yang Kai stopped his pace, and smiled slightly, “Good!”

Only then did Sha Ya felt that the ubiquitous pressure around her suddenly ease. Letting out a sigh of relief, she raised her head slightly to look at Yang Kai with a face so beautiful that it was sufficient to drive any living man insane, she asked pitifully, “What does Sir need of me to prove myself?”

Just how she wanted Yang Kai to show his sincerity when he surrendered to her before, now that she chose to abandon her dignity, she should naturally prove her loyalty. No one would be foolish enough to believe empty words.

“Open your Knowledge Sea!” Yang Kai ordered.

“…Yes,” Sha Ya hesitated for a moment, but in the end, she still lowered the defences of her Knowledge Sea. All her secrets instantly became undefended and were available for Yang Kai’s access at will.

Of course, if he had really done this, it may have caused Sha Ya irreparable trauma as one careless mistake would be enough to turn her insane.

Yang Kai, however, did not spy on those secrets and instead pushed his Divine Sense to leave a Soul Imprint in Sha Ya’s Knowledge Sea.

Sha Ya’s tender body trembled as she felt an invisible link connecting her to this Shaman Niu. It seemed that there was a rope tethering her to Shaman Niu’s hand.

Inexplicably, she felt close to Shaman Niu, and he no longer appeared as horrible as he did before. Sha Ya knew how such Soul Secret Techniques worked of course, and her heart sank in the next moment when she quietly checked the strength of this Soul Imprint.

She thought that with her own powerful Soul, even if the other party had left a mark in her Knowledge Sea, she would still be able to find the opportunity to erase it and free herself; after all, Yang Kai was just an existence equivalent to a Demon Great General.

But Sha Ya found that the Soul Imprint was as firm as a mountain, and would not budge at all, which extinguished any hope she previously had.

“You should know that I can sense every malicious thought you have,” Yang Kai looked at her with a smile.

Sha Ya’s face flushed slightly and she raised her eyes tenderly and said, “Sir, I was wrong, and I will never dare to do it again. From now on, Sha Ya will belong to Sir. Sha Ya only hopes that Sir… will show her mercy.”

Her infinite femininity and charming appearance dimmed the entire world’s brilliance.

Yang Kai raised his hand, and Sha Ya’s complexion changed wildly as a piercing pain shot through her chest. She looked down to find a thumb-sized hole that went through her chest and out her back, spurting blood wildly.

Sha Ya’s face suddenly paled.

“The next time you dare to use a Charm Technique on me, this hole will open in your head,” Yang Kai said coldly and ruthlessly.

“Yes!” Sha Ya replied with a solemn expression.

Although even opening a hole in her head was not fatal for her, it would not be a good experience, so she immediately became obedient.

Yang Kai tilted his head at her and frowned, “You said that as long as the Demon Heart remains, the Demon Race will not die… Since the Demon Heart is your foundation, why didn’t you die after I’ve destroyed it twice?”

In the previous battle, Yang Kai had ambushed her from behind and pierced through Sha Ya’s Demon Heart with his Myriads Sword, and just now, he had also pierced her Demon Heart with a flick of his finger. But other than looking a little weakened by his attack, Sha Ya was not in any life-threatening danger.

Sha Ya replied, “I have two Demon Hearts, and if either one exists, I will not die.”

Yang Kai raised his brow, “Is it the same for other Demon Race Masters?”

Sha Ya answered obediently, “Most of them have multiple Demon Hearts, only a few have just one. If Sir wants to kill any existence at the Demon King Realm or above, you must ensure that all their Demon Hearts are destroyed.”

She had just surrendered and was eager to prove herself, so she hid nothing regarding this piece of information.

“En,” Yang Kai nodded and raised his hand again. Sha Ya’s expression changed like a conditional reflex, thinking that she must have accidentally angered Yang Kai again, but soon realized that she was wrong. A delicate jade bottle suddenly floated towards her and fell to the ground lightly.

Sha Ya raised her head and looked at Yang Kai suspiciously.

“Take the pill inside, I have something to ask you later.”

Sha Ya picked up the jade bottle, opened the cap, and poured out the contents. A plump, sparkling, crystal clear Spirit Pill rolled into her palm, accompanied by a rich and potent fragrance. A desire to consume it was immediately born in her heart.

She did not hesitate and swallowed the Spirit Pill.

Sha Ya immediately sat cross-legged in shock and adjusted her breathing silently.

In less than a stick of incense worth of time, the injuries on her body had completely recovered. Even the hidden wounds and weakened aura she had suffered from before were greatly healed, and she had become completely rejuvenated.

The vitality of the Demon Race was indeed strong, especially for Sha Ya, who was a Demon King, but her quick recovery this time was mainly due to that mysterious pill. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

[Could this foreign race refine such a thing? According to Sir Shaman Niu, it’s called a pill…]

Sha Ya frowned as her understanding of the Barbarian’s medicines only indicated that they were capable of making some herb mixtures that look like paste, never having heard of these Spirit Pills that exuded such fragrance before.

It was undeniable that the effects of this pill were extremely powerful. If the foreign race could make such pills casually, their injured clansmen would always be able to recover rapidly.

This was bad news for the Demon Race.

But after a moment of pondering, Sha Ya smiled wryly and thought, [What’s the point of thinking about this? Now that I am a prisoner, my fate is completely at the mercy of Sir Shaman Niu. It is completely meaningless to think about these things.]

[I really became someone else’s slave!]

Sha Ya let out a small sigh, composed her thoughts, and walked towards Yang Kai obediently. She came in front of him and reported, “Sir, I’ve recovered now.”

Yang Kai turned around to look at her, and began his interrogation, “Where did you come from?”

“The Demon Realm!”

“The Demon Realm?” Yang Kai frowned.

Sha Ya smiled slightly, “There are many worlds out there, and Sir’s world is not the only one. The Demon Realm comes from a world equal to yours.”

Yang Kai gasped slightly, “You mean, there are more of such worlds?”

Sha Ya nodded, “Of course. Although I haven’t been to any other places, according to the information left by my ancestors, there are indeed many worlds in this endless universe. It’s just that there are walls between the worlds and it is not easy to perceive the presence of other worlds, except for those that have reached the pinnacle of power and can faintly sense such things.”

“Then how did the Demon Race discover those worlds, and how did you enter them?”

“The strength of the walls between different worlds varies, with some being so weak they barely even exist. As long as you can find an entrance, you can enter and exit another world at will. On the other hand, the walls of some worlds are extremely strong, and only by paying an incredible price can one cross them. En, Sir, the World Barrier between this world and the Demon Realm is actually quite firm, so Sir Demon God had to personally take action to break through it.”

“Demon God!” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed.

He had heard Sha Ya mention these two words before, but Yang Kai always thought that this so-called Demon God was an existence like the Shaman Gods and Barbarian Gods, a symbolic or spiritual pillar.

But upon listening to Sha Ya’s information, it appeared this so-called Demon God actually existed, and he had even acted to break the walls between the two worlds.

This piece of information gave Yang Kai shivers as he wondered just how much power was needed to achieve such a feat. Even the famous Ten Great Emperors of the Star Boundary might not have such ability.

Sha Ya explained solemnly, “In the Demon Realm, only the strongest existence is qualified to become the Demon God.”

“There are more than one of them?” Yang Kai’s brow twitched furiously.

“Of course,” Sha Ya looked at him strangely, baffled at why he would ask such a question.
