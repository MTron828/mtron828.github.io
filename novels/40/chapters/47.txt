Chapter 48 - Prominent Power

Cheng Shao Feng and Nu Tao had already stated their purpose in coming here, causing Kai Yang to be startled. He never thought that these two people would be so ruthless and heartless; they actually wanted to kill him over a single dispute.

As he vigilantly watched the pair, Hu Mei Er secretly whispered in Kai Yang’s ear: “Kai Yang, if you don’t want to die, then obey my words. Half a month ago, that Nu Tao advanced to the initial element fifth stage, and is not comparable to Cheng Shao Feng. Not to mention there are two people, you definitely aren’t their match.”

“You have a method to deal with them?” Kai Yang asked unconvinced.

“I can’t deal with them, but they definitely won’t have the guts to kill me. As long as you agree to my condition, I can promise you that you won’t die.”

Hu Mei Er’s status was clearly displayed, so if she really wanted to protect Kai Yang, Cheng Shao Feng and Nu Tao wouldn’t be able to ignore her and not give her face thus at most they would beat up Kai Yang to vent their anger.

“No need.” Kai Yang slowly shook his head.

“You are that unwilling, to the point you would rather die?” Hu Mei Er looked at Kai Yang like she was looking at a retard, disbelief in her eyes.

“I’m sorry to say, I am slightly mysophobic. What’s more, who will die or live will only be determined once fists are exchanged.” Kai Yang calmly looked over the two people opposite him.

Receiving this answer, Hu Mei Er’s face changed irregularly. After a while, she sneered out coldly, biting down with her ivory teeth, bitterly saying: “Since you’ve chosen this way, then follow it through to the end!”

After this was said, she retreated about ten feet back and crossed her arms to watch.

Cheng Shao Feng laughed out loudly: “Elder sister Hu Er is really obedient. I just knew that elder sister Hu Er wouldn’t cause us any inconvenience.”

Hu Mei Er squeezed out an extremely ugly face, and no one knew what she was thinking in her heart.

Nu Tao he he strangely laughed, and sized up Kai Yang from head to toe. Nu Tao cracked his knuckles and slowly shook his head: “You are called Kai Yang right? When you reach the netherworld you must not blame me, for you should blame yourself for meddling in others’ business. Would you like to end it yourself, or shall I do it for you?”

This question was extremely savage, but Kai Yang just smiled: “If you want my life, then use your ability to come and take it!”

As he said this, he secretly started to activate the True Yang Tactics. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Just as the True Yang Tactics were about to activate, Kai Yang already felt a violent feeling from his chest as well as blistering hot energy getting sucked in via his acupuncture points. Within this blistering hot energy was large amounts of Yang qi. In that moment, Kai Yang’s meridians were painfully hot, it was so hot smoke started to emit from his chest, roasting the skin until it turned black.

Kai Yang was greatly alarmed, and before he could respond, his meridians which were experiencing searing pain adapted and the large amount of Yang qi continued flowing into his meridians.

It took literally the blink of an eye, his meridians became packed to the brim with Yang World Qi, swelling non-stop.

Drip drip.......it was like movement from the depths of his soul, and within his dantian there unexpectedly was one more Yang Liquid drop.

A short while later, another drip sound was heard.

In the span of three breaths, two drops of Yang Liquid were formed. Just what was the matter with that third drop, for as soon as it condensed, it disappeared.

Only after that moment did the violent surge of Yang qi stop.

Bright Yang Stone! Thinking about it, Kai Yang took out that Bright Yang Stone which had cost him the bottle of small returning pellets. But how could this stone, which was previously filled to the brim with Yang energy manage to retain its former glory? Inside, not even a trickle of energy remained; it had actually been fully absorbed by him in that short period of time.

In the end, it only condensed two drops of Yang Liquid! It was only that one of these drops had disappeared, confusing Kai Yang. Including the original drop within his dantian, there were only two drops.

This absorption rate......isn’t it a bit too fast? It was basically force feeding, not even allowing him to have any reaction.

Kai Yang’s transformation was seen by Cheng Shao Feng and Nu Tao. Kai Yang’s change within his chest area caused them to become at a bit of a loss, but with Nu Tao’s battle experience, he immediately waved his hand and said: “Junior brother Cheng, follow me and advance. I’m afraid things have changed.”

“Okay.” The earlier Kai Yang died the better was how Cheng Shao Feng felt. With no hesitation, he carried his long sabre and rushed forward, his face a cruel mask.

Two people, side by side, they were like a storm and in the blink of an eye, they arrived in front of Kai Yang.

Nu Tao’s strength really was higher by a level, so his speed was also faster. His fist flew forward covered in World Qi, suddenly charging straight for Kai Yang’s face

Initial element fifth stage, they would have already amassed quite a decent amount of World Qi, a martial practitioner’s battle prowess could not be underestimated.

The fist that Nu Tao threw out caused a faint whistling sound, clearly displaying the fact that he was using some sort of martial skill.

Kai Yang didn’t dodge and also threw out a fist.

“Peng” it sounded out and Kai Yang’s wrist bone rang from the impact, while his fist felt like it was cut up by hundreds of razors. In a second, numerous cuts appeared, and he couldn’t help but retreat a few steps.

Though Nu Tao cried out oddly, for he felt that he had struck a blazing hot piece of iron. His skin and flesh were all burned painfully and he screamed out: “Such hot World Qi!”

With his initial element fifth stage strength, he was unable to defend against a martial practitioner who was at the tempered body stage’s attack. This was really a bit strange.

When these two people traded fists, each one had retreated a few steps.

Holding his sabre, Cheng Shao Feng joined the fray, his desire for vengeance raging, as he thrust towards Kai Yang, determined to cut him down then and there.

After experiencing Nu Tao’s attack, all of Kai Yang’s blood had started to boil and from his bones, a warm feeling started to seep out; it felt like he had an inexhaustible supply of power. As his eyes slowly turned red, his original gentle looking face became malevolent and berzerk.

Facing Cheng Shao Feng’s sabre, Kai Yang used one hand to catch it.

Cheng Shao Feng sneered: “I have already learnt from last time. Do you really think that this young master would really trip over in the same place twice?”

As he said this, he swept his sabre to cut off Kai Yang’s fingers. Kai Yang’s reaction wasn’t slow. Sensing that the opponent’s blade was changing directions he changed his hand into a grabbing hold.

“Pu”, the long sabre still managed to chop off one of Kai Yang’s fingers, causing Cheng Shao Feng’s face to blossom in elation. Hu Mei Er covered her mouth, extremely disturbed, but when she remembered Kai Yang’s attitude to her, she thought that he should be hacked into pieces.

“How could this be?” Cheng Shao Feng cried out in fear, for he realised that he hadn’t actually severed Kai Yang’s fingers. Although it wasn’t a immortal weapon it was still a sharp weapon, could a tempered body stage martial practitioner’s body be this strong? Even if it were someone at the initial element stage, their fingers would be severed.

Kai Yang laughed maliciously, revealing his row of eerily white teeth and looked at him with his blood coloured eyes. Cheng Shao Feng was feeling somewhat panicky now, so while he hurriedly retreated, he also shouted out loudly: “Senior brother Nu, save me!”

Before the words had left his mouth, Kai Yang had already pursued him and a drop of Yang Liquid within his dantian started to move through his will, into his fingertips.

Pointing out, he went straight for the middle of Cheng Shao Feng’s head.

Cheng Shao Feng opened his mouth widely and ceased to breathe, falling to the ground. On his forehead there was a hole about the size of a chopstick penetrating through his skull. The hole was very smooth and slick, in fact not even a drop of blood flowed out. Eyes wide open, his dying expression was one without any trace of his previous grievance.

“Ah!” Two cries of alarm simultaneously rang out. They originated from Nu Tao and Hu Mei Er who had witnessed the startling scene.

What started me was when I first started to help edit the chapters, then with a help of some online chinese-english, I realised I could translate them. I mean, I can speak and listen to it, it was just that I never really learnt how to read and write, but if I’m given the pinyin I can understand it perfectly. Hehe. And what is the best What is the best wuxia/xianxia novel you read so far? Hmmm, that’s a hard question because it was previously CD, but that ending...........Though if I were to pick, it would be MP, jks. It’s actually TDG, as much how bastard-y Ne Li is right now, the concepts are very interesting and exciting. Though my favourite character would definitely be Duan Jian, liked the guy from the moment he appeared. And my facebook? Here.....
