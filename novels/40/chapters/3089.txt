“Sir, do you want to head to the Ancestral Domain?” He Yun Xiang asked.

“Yes. Do you know how I can get there?” Yang Kai looked hopefully at them.

With a helpless smile, Lu Huai Shuang replied, “Although the Lu Family is the top force on Morning Sun Star, my family is still quite small when compared to the hegemony of the Star Field, so I know little about the Ancestral Domain.” She felt upset. If she could help Yang Kai with this matter, then the Lu Family would be rewarded handsomely. However, she was unable to seize this opportunity.

He Yun Xiang darted her gaze around for a moment before she uttered, “I don’t know how to get there either, but I do know of someone who might.”

“Who?” Yang Kai’s expression changed.

Understanding what she meant, Lu Huai Shuang turned to look at her and said, “Head Manager, you mean the Yan Family?”

He Yun Xiang replied with a smile, “500 years ago, the Old Ancestor of the Yan Family left Taiyi Star and headed for the Ancestral Domain, which caused an uproar at that time. No one knows whether the Yan Family’s Old Ancestor successfully entered the Ancestral Domain; however, those from the Yan Family are the most familiar with such matters in Unending Star Field. If Sir wants to travel to the Ancestral Domain, you should start with them.”

“The Yan Family…” A sense of wariness flashed across Lu Huai Shuang’s gaze as she warned, “They’re not easy to deal with.”

“What’s their background?” Yang Kai asked.

The ladies knew that he wasn’t from Unending Star Field, so he wasn’t familiar with the local great forces; therefore, they explained it to him patiently.

In Unending Star Field, the Yan Family had raised countless powerful Masters. The Yan Family not only ruled over Taiyi Star, but they also controlled five other Cultivation Stars which were at least on par with Morning Sun Star. Meanwhile, Taiyi Star was far superior to Morning Sun Star.

If Cultivation Stars were graded, Morning Sun Star was only at the Mid-Rank, while Taiyi Star would be Peak-Rank. Be it the abundance of World Energy, or the production of resources, Morning Sun Star was vastly inferior.

Hence, the Yan Family’s foundation was solid and their resources plentiful.

In Unending Star Field, the Yan Family stood at the apex. They had somewhere between three to five Third-Order Origin Kings while their current Patriarch, Yan Luo, was touted as the strongest in this Star Field.

Star Pirates like the Fierce Gale Pirates were a band of lawless robbers who committed all sorts of evil atrocities; however, if they ever came across a Yan Family’s Starship while travelling across the Star Field, they wouldn’t dare to make a move on them.

Upon hearing their explanation, Yang Kai had a basic understanding of the Yan Family, and he felt satisfied. Since that was the case, he could start with the Yan Family and learn from them how he could head to the Ancestral Domain.

When the ladies saw how calm Yang Kai appeared to be, and that he was unfazed upon learning that the Yan Family was a superpower, they increasingly found him to be inscrutable.

He Yun Xiang was especially elated and thought that it was really worth it for her to sacrifice her dignity to grab hold of the thigh of a giant like him. If she could follow him to the Ancestral Domain, becoming his servant was a trivial price to pay.

With her gaze brightening up, she covered her mouth and laughed charmingly, “What a coincidence. Little Sister Shuang, isn’t Taiyi Star where you’re heading?”

Yang Kai asked, “You’re going there?”

After a nod, Lu Huai Shuang replied, “We were heading to Taiyi Star to trade for some goods. If Senior doesn’t mind, why not accompany us?” Morning Sun Star was very far from Taiyi Star, so even using an Origin King Grade Starship, it would still take them three months to cross that distance. Moreover, the products both Stars produced were very different. Every three to five years, the Lu Family’s people would take Morning Sun Star’s local products to other Cultivation Stars to trade. Their destination this time was Taiyi Star.

“Good.” Naturally, Yang Kai wouldn’t reject her. Although he was an Emperor Realm Master, everything was inconvenient for him in this Lower Star Field, as he had to actively suppress his strength and aura. If he tried to use his true power, he would trigger a rejection reaction from the Heavenly Way.

Since they were heading to the same destination, he wouldn’t mind a free ride. After confirming his next course of action, Yang Kai went on to ask about other matters regarding Unending Star Field. The ladies explained everything to him in a passionate and honest manner. He Yun Xiang didn’t even hide her intentions of wanting to enter his service.

Four hours later. Yang Kai told them that he was tired. Lu Huai Shuang tactfully rose from the chair and bid him farewell. Before she left, she asked him hesitantly how he wanted to handle the He Family’s Origin King Grade Starship.

Yang Kai waved his hand and uttered, “You can have it.”

Naturally, he wasn’t interested in an Origin King Grade Starship.

He Yun Xiang arched her brow and thought that he was indeed generous, as he gave the Origin King Grade Starship away without blinking an eye. However, upon some deliberation, she realized that given his power and status, he certainly saw things differently from her. The treasures in her eyes might just be a bunch of trash to him.

Lu Huai Shuang thanked him repeatedly and said that she would give him Crystal Stones of equal value in exchange for the Starship. Upon his rejection, she left the room.

It wasn’t that Yang Kai was pretending to be generous, but these Crystal Stones from the Lower Star Field were completely useless to him. On the contrary, if he took out even one of the many High-Rank Source Crystals in his Space Ring, it would trigger a reign of terror across this Star Field.

Before Lu Huai Shuang left, she shot a meaningful glance at He Yun Xiang, who pretended not to see it and stayed behind, unashamedly.

After the door was closed, only one man and one woman were left in the room.

“Sir, do you have any other needs? Whatever you ask, I’ll do it for you.” Although the room wasn’t particularly hot, He Yun Xiang’s face was flushed pink. Her eyes were watery, and she gently pressed her lips together whenever she spoke. Any man who saw her in such a state would be enchanted and agree to do anything for her. Judging from her suggestive words, there was no doubt about what her intentions were.

Faced with the young man before her eyes, she could only utilize her beauty to seduce him. Fortunately, she happened to be confident of her allure.

Yang Kai was a young and energetic man, and there was a beautiful woman who was trying to seduce him in such a relaxing environment, so he was tempted, but he had been cultivating for a long time now so he wasn’t lacking in self-control. His vision had also been broadened after venturing in the outside world for years. Moreover, he had met countless Heaven defying beauties in the past, so he wouldn’t be seduced by He Yun Xiang easily.

Staring at her, he asked with a meaningful smile, “Is it worth it?”

“What do you mean?”

“You still have your Primordial Yin, right?”

In an instant, He Yun Xiang’s face went from pink to red. She was pretending to be shy just now, but at this moment, she was truly embarrassed. Lowering her head, she bit her red lips lightly, and when she raised her head again, she replied steadfastly, “As long as you can lead me to a higher Martial Dao, then it’s worth it.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “I don’t make such deals.”

Since her intention had been seen through, He Yun Xiang stopped hiding anything and said calmly, “It is a woman’s greatest wish to find a reliable man. Throughout the entire Unending Star Field, the man I’ll be interested in hasn’t been born yet.” Her watery gaze reflected the figure of the young man before her. She wasn’t just interested in him; she was mesmerized by his power.

It wasn’t love at first sight. In fact, she wasn’t in love with him at all; however, she knew that if she wanted to look for a man whom she could rely on forever, the one before her eyes was undoubtedly the best choice.

The chance was right before her eyes, and if she didn’t grab onto it hard enough, it would soon slip through her fingers. She didn’t want to reminisce about the past in her old age and regret her hesitation on this day.

“How are you so sure that I can bring you to greater heights?”

He Yun Xiang tucked her hair behind her ear and replied with a smile, “I don’t know what power you possess, but I’ve always trusted my instincts.”

“You’re quite confident. I’m going to visit the Yan Family now, do you understand what that means?”

“I do.” He Yun Xiang gazed curiously at him, wondering why he mentioned this all of a sudden.

“I’m going there to find out how to enter the Ancestral Domain from them. How do you think they’ll treat me?”

He Yun Xiang was startled for a moment, as she had never thought about it before. However, upon pondering the question, she immediately thought of many things.

The way to get to the Ancestral Domain had always been a top-level secret. Although it was rumoured that, in Unending Star Field, numerous Masters from different ages had successfully entered the Ancestral Domain, the general public didn’t know where the entrance was or how to get there. This secret had always been kept by only the most powerful great forces.

Since it was a top secret, they certainly wouldn’t reveal it easily. Yang Kai’s journey this time wouldn’t be smooth sailing and he would probably find himself in conflict with the Yan Family.

Taiyi Star was the Yan Family’s headquarters as well as the place where all their top Masters gathered. Anyone would be put in a disadvantageous position if they were to fall into a conflict with them there.

The young man before her eyes was unbelievably powerful, so she didn’t doubt he could escape unscathed even if he couldn’t beat the Yan Family; however, she was just a Second-Order Origin King. If she was regarded as accompanying him, she would be targeted by the Yan Family. By then, she wouldn’t have a chance to flee. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

She was an intelligent person, so she realized many things after giving them a thought. Hence, her steadfastness was soon replaced by hesitation. Initially, she thought that she would have a lot to gain by siding with Yang Kai; however, now, it seemed that she was too naive.

“You may go,” Yang Kai waved his hand.

He Yun Xiang remained unmoving though. She was silent for a short time before she suddenly gritted her teeth and, just like what she had done when they first met, she lowered her head deeply and spoke, “Sir, please allow me to follow you. I’m willing to do anything for you.”

Yang Kai was stunned, “I thought you understood already.” The hesitation on her face just now was real, so how did she change her mind in the blink of an eye? Yang Kai wondered if all women would change their minds so quickly, or perhaps he was just too simple-minded.

He Yun Xiang lowered her head as her fair bosom was exposed, but she didn’t do this intentionally. It was just that her peaks were easily revealed in her current dress and posture. In a determined manner, she uttered, “We all will come across a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity at some point in our lives, but it will only be considered an opportunity if we can seize it.”

“It might turn out to be a poisonous dagger.”

“Sir, I’m sure you’ve made bets many times before in your life. So, please give me a chance to make a bet this time.”

“You’ll regret it.”

“We all have to choose our own path. Since I’ve made the decision, I will never regret it.”

Yang Kai stared fixedly at her, while she remained unmoving.

Just like what she had said, as cultivators, every decision they made was akin to making a bet when they were faced with an opportunity. Some people won the bet and reached the peaks; however, those who lost the bet would fall into oblivion.

He Yun Xiang became who she was by making the right bets on her way up. One couldn’t cultivate if one didn’t dare to gamble. Although she was a woman, she had spent most of her life among a gang of rough and vulgar men. So, she wasn’t as sentimental as other women. Instead, she had the steadfast temperament of a seasoned warrior.

She wanted to venture a bet, which was to ride on the waves and surge to greater heights.
