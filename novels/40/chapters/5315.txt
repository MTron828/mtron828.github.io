When Fu Qian was at a loss, he suddenly caught a glimpse of Zhu Wu You’s eyes wandering around, looking down into the depths every now and then.

Fu Qian was shocked and asked, “Zhu Wu You, what do you intend to do?”

Zhu Wu You glanced at him and said with a snort, “You clearly know the answer to that.”

Fu Qian frowned and then whispered, “Big Brother Ji is not to be messed with.”

There were a total of three Young Dragons in this generation of Dragon Clan. The Ji family Young Dragon was the oldest and had the longest dragon body, so he was the strongest.

Only the two of them addressed him as Big Brother Ji, so it did not mean that he was the strongest within the Ji Family. For instance, Ji Lao San was about to break through to become an Ancient Dragon. They grew up in a different era, so each generation of the Dragon Clan addressed each other differently.

Big Brother Ji was a Young Dragon who had already exceeded the 9,000 metres mark, unlike the two of them who were still some ways away from their breakthrough.

When they entered the Dragon Pool this time, neither Zhu Wu You nor Fu Qian had the intention to compete with Big Brother Ji. They knew that they were not his match and could not compete for his territory.

However, now they might not have a choice but to fight. If they did not compete for a better territory with stronger Dragon Pool power, how could they train and improve their strength?

Thus, one look at Zhu Wu You’s wandering eyes and Fu Qian knew what he was thinking.

Zhu Wu You followed up, “I know that Big Brother Ji’s is more than 9,000 metres and just one step away from becoming a Grand Dragon, but although neither of us are his match and even if we join forces we probably won’t win, how can we not try to fight for his territory under the current circumstances?”

Fu Qian could not help but shrug and asked, “Aren’t you afraid that Big Brother Ji will beat you to death?”

Zhu Wu You replied, “Needless to say, I am expecting serious injuries. As long as the fight does not kill me though, I will be able to carve out some space to gain some benefits.”

This was what he did previously, while fighting with Fu Qian, as he was refining and devouring the Dragon Pool power around them the whole time. Although he was injured and scarred during the half a month of fighting, he managed to refine a lot of Dragon Pool power which was then used to refine his Dragon Vein.

Zhu Wu You knew he really was not Big Brother Ji’s match, so his intention was not to drive the latter away. As he said, as long as Big Brother Ji did not kill him, he could always reap some benefits.

It was better than waiting up here with nothing to gain.

With his mind made up, Zhu Wu You swooped down with a shake of his tail.

“You’re really going?” Fu Qian was shocked that Zhu Wu You was acting so bold.

Zhu Wu You coldly snorted and said, “To the brave go the spoils. Stay up there if you’re too scared!”

Fu Qian hesitated and remained where he was, but a short while later, he gritted his teeth and chased after Zhu Wu You. As Zhu Wu You said, the power of the Dragon Pool in his territory was already very thin; thus, there was no point in staying here. He had to go to compete for a better territory. Perhaps he could even take advantage of this Dragon Pool contest to advance to become a Grand Dragon.

Moments later, Big Brother Ji roared angrily, “You gave you the guts to come down here!? You court death!”

Dragon Pressure pulsed through the area as Dragon Force stirred.

Zhu Wu You and Fu Qian joined forces to battle Big Brother Ji. It was two against one, but they were still no match for the latter and were beaten to a pulp. However, the two Dragons were determined not to retreat and as they were being beaten, they continued frantically devouring and refining the power of the Dragon Pool around them.

Big Brother Ji was furious and his attacks became increasingly ruthless.

After about half a month of fighting, the three Young Dragons were now locked in a three-way standoff, each of them looking at the others from a short distance. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Big Brother Ji was apoplectic and his eyes were shooting daggers. He was ready to devour and rip apart the both of them.

Zhu Wu You grinned and tried to appease him, “Big Brother Ji, please don’t be angry. I did not want to come here, but Fu Qian enticed me to come down with him to nibble some of the Dragon Power here. I could not resist the temptation and followed along with him. Now that you’ve beaten me until I can hardly open my eyes, I hope that you’re done venting your anger.”

Fu Qian was stunned and turned his head to look at Zhu Wu You as he said angrily, “What are you talking about? You were the one who…”

Zhu Wu You snorted as he snapped back, “What? Didn’t I say that Big Brother Ji is not to be messed with? Yet you want to come to disturb him. Look at how messed up you are now. If you go out of the Dragon Pool, even your parents won’t be able to recognize you.”

“You… I…” Fu Qian was dumbfounded.

“Well, let’s not talk about the past since what was done cannot be undone. Now that the power of the Dragon Pool in Big Brother Ji’s territory is almost depleted, we have no reason to fight any more,” Zhu Wu You shouted coldly.

Fu Qian’s eyes rolled scornfully and was dumbfounded. Previously, he had the impression that Zhu Wu You was despicable, but now he knew that he was also shameless.

Zhu Wu You turned his head to look at Big Brother Ji and asked, “Now what do we do? Do we wait for the Dragon Pool to open again and go back in disgrace?”

Big Brother Ji was furious and did not know how to vent his anger. If possible, he really wanted to hammer these two to death; however, as Zhu Wu You said, now that his Dragon Pool power was almost depleted, there was no point in fighting any longer.

The current Dragon Pool session was an opportunity. With his more than 9,000 metres long Dragon Form, he could easily be promoted to become a Grand Dragon; however, he still had a way to go until he broke through. It was not that easy to advance without the help of sufficient Dragon Pool power.

It would be embarrassing if he did not advance to become a Grand Dragon when the Dragon Pool reopened.

He was the only Young Dragon who was expected to advance, unlike Zhu Wu You and Fu Qian.

“What are you trying to say?” Big Brother Ji snarled through gritted teeth and restrained his anger.

Zhu Wu You scoffed and said, “Since we’re in this situation, as the Humans say, in for a penny, in for a pound!” Zhu Wu You’s eyes then glanced downward.

Fu Qian went pale as he stuttered, “Y-Y-You…”

Previously, when Zhu Wu You proposed stealing some of Big Brother Ji’s Dragon Pool power, Fu Qian already felt that he was too outrageous. Now it was even more excessive that he was considering competing with the Grand Dragons below.

Those were Grand Dragons!

How could they even hold back their wrath when three Young Dragons intruded into their territory?

“Shut up!” Zhu Wu You shouted with utter contempt, “What a coward!”

Fu Qian almost choked to death.

When Big Brother Ji did not say a word, Zhu Wu You was disappointed and sighed as he lamented, “For generations, our Dragon Clan has constantly guarded the No-Return Pass. It sounds honorable, but at some point it seems we lost our courage. Now, we dare not even compete in a fight. Sigh, I guess I will just go back to my own territory and have a good sleep and wait for the Dragon Pool to open again. I am the weakest among us, so it’s fine for me not to become a Grand Dragon this time. But, Big Brother Ji, if you are not going to become a Grand Dragon this time, then I’m afraid you’ll ultimately be punished.”

Big Brother Ji muttered, “Stop taunting me.”

Zhu Wu You chuckled, “How dare I? Big Brother Ji is the leading figure of our generation. Fu Qian and I have always taken you as a role model, right?”

Fu Qian was confused for a moment.

Zhu Wu You cursed in his heart, this moron was truly incompetent when it came to using his head.

Zhu Wu You brushed Fu Qian aside and said, “There is not much time left in this opening of the Dragon Pool. Our advancement has been very slow. If we don’t think of a way forward, we will stagnate as we are. I don’t know about you guys, but I refuse to accept this situation. Big Brother Ji, as long as you say the word, I, Zhu Wu You, will fight with you. At the very least, I’ll lead the charge against the Grand Dragon below!”

In any case, they were all going to become punching bags, so it really made no difference who was beaten up first and who was last. At least, if they went together, they could share the beatings. Going alone would be disastrous. Regardless, he had to drag Big Brother Ji and Fu Qian along. When the Grand Dragon below wanted to punish them, as the weakest Dragon Clansmen among them, his share of responsibility should be limited.

“You’re willing to take the first blow?” Big Brother Ji looked at Zhu Wu You in surprise.

Zhu Wu You appeared like he was suicidal and yelled confidently, “I’ll take the opening blow!”

On seeing that he was so determined, Big Brother Ji nodded satisfactorily and said, “Good, let’s head down then!”

Fu Qian suddenly came to his senses and shouted, “Wait! Setting aside the fact that there are Grand Dragons down there, the three of us are only Young Dragons. We may not be able to withstand the pressure below!”

Zhu Wu You looked at him with frustration and yelled, “Are you stupid? The Dragon Pool power above us is so weak, so how dense can it be below? Yes, in the past, we could not handle the intensity at those depths, but now it is different.”

Fu Qian thought about it and admitted, “You have a point.”

Zhu Wu You braced up and said, “Then let’s do it?”

Big Brother Ji and Fu Qian looked at each other and both nodded their heads.

“Let’s go!” Zhu Wu You did not hesitate, and with a flip of his Dragon Tail, he swam deeper down.

A short while later, a Grand Dragon roared, “Three little brats! You’ve got some nerve coming down here!”

Zhu Wu You immediately screamed and shirked the responsibility, “Big Brother Ji brought us here, Third Uncle! Don’t hit my eyes, I can’t see…”

Big Brother Ji was immediately offered up as a sacrifice.

…..

These three Young Dragons had very little experience with the Dragon Pool, so although they could clearly sense the reduction of the Dragon Pool power, they all thought that it was due to the lack of power stored in Dragon Pool itself.

It was different for the Grand Dragons. Some of them had come to Dragon Pool multiple times, and although there was always some difference in the stored power in the past, the difference was usually not significant.

This time was different.

The power in the Dragon Pool was decreasing at a terrifying rate, and a few Grand Dragons with great strength could even clearly perceive that there was an invisible force deep below that was pulling in and devouring the mysterious power.

The Dragon Pool power was weakening at an incredible rate from top to bottom.

As a result, the Dragon Pool power at the respective Dragon Clan members’ territories was rapidly depleting.

When the Dragon Pool power weakened, the Dragons could not get the necessary benefits and could only dive deeper down to fight for and snatch new territories.

Initially, Zhu Wu You went to grab Fu Qian’s territory. Then the two Young Dragons joined forces to grab Big Brother Ji’s territory. Now the three Young Dragons came to challenge a Grand Dragon for his territory.

Now, three months later, the team has expanded to two Grand Dragons and three Young Dragons.

Zhu Wu You was now very happy. At this point, he would no longer be beaten up when they challenged another Grand Dragon for space in their territory. While the Seniors fought, he only needed to observe from far away and take the opportunity to refine the Dragon Pool power.

Indeed, the further they went down, the stronger the Dragon Pool power became, but unfortunately it did not last long before it ran out.

Since ancient times, no Young Dragon had ever descended more than 100,000 metres into the Dragon Pool; however, this time, these three Young Dragons vastly exceeded this feat.

In a span of just three months, Zhu Wu You and Fu Qian’s Dragon Forms had increased several hundred metres in length, and Big Brother Ji was about to break through to become a Grand Dragon.

They were only Young Dragons with huge room for improvement, so although they were only following behind their Seniors, their growth was very obvious.

Zhu Wu You silently pondered. With such a rate of improvement, he now stood a good chance of becoming a Grand Dragon during this Dragon Pool cultivation session.

Looking at the Seniors who were now fighting, Zhu Wu You grinned sinisterly. [Fight, keep fighting! Fight so that we, the Young Dragons, can continue to reap the benefits!]
