Under normal circumstances, even a fight between High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters might not be able to break through a Territory Barrier, but Yang Kai happened to be proficient in the Dao of Space. Along with the previous explosion of the Heavenly Sword Palace and various chances and coincidences, Zuo Quan Hui was able to borrow his strength to open a passageway between the two Great Territories, which ultimately gave him a chance to escape.

Otherwise, it would be impossible for Zuo Quan Hui to escape from Yang Kai’s grasp even if he was an experienced Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. If Yang Kai could pin him down until Void Land’s Sixth-Order Masters had taken care of all their opponents, Zuo Quan Hui would not be able to resist once they had also joined and besieged him.

Unfortunately, Yang Kai had missed such a great opportunity. Who knows whether the old dog’s time had not arrived or the Heavens just did not want to side with Yang Kai.

“I have no idea which Great Territory is on the other side!” Qing Kui frowned.

“I’ll go in and take a look!” Yang Kai stated as he took a step forward.

“Allow me!” Hui Gu arrived in front of Yang Kai in a flash and rushed towards the Territory Gate without giving the latter a chance to say anything. After having personally killed Huang Quan and obtaining his revenge, Hui Gu had no regrets in this life. No one knew if there would be an ambush waiting for them on the other side of the Territory Gate or not, so the first one to rush in would be at a disadvantage. Yang Kai hadn’t fully recovered yet, so it wasn’t appropriate for him to lead the way.

From this point alone, one could see the difference between Hui Gu and Mao Zhe’s group. Both of them had left their names on the Loyalty List, but Hui Gu was far more loyal.

Yang Kai could not let him enter the Territory Gate alone though. Although this Territory Gate had been formed by his piercing through the Territory Barrier, it had just been formed and wasn’t stable yet. With his proficiency in the Dao of Space, Yang Kai didn’t need to fear the Void Turbulence. Hui Gu, on the other hand, was different; he might even lose his way in the Void if he was unlucky.

Yang Kai followed behind Hui Gu like a shadow while the others quickly chased after them.

The Territory Gate really was very unstable; it gave everyone a feeling of distortion as everyone passed through it. The Void Turbulence around them churned wildly with the air of chaos and nihility, causing everyone’s heart to clench.

Fortunately, everything went smoothly, and in the blink of an eye, all of them passed through the Territory Gate and arrived at the Great Territory on the other side.

Everyone immediately circulated their World Force as they secretly raised their guards.

But much to their surprise, there was no ambush waiting for them. Zuo Quan Hui probably didn’t have the courage to remain here and wait for Void Land to pursue him. He had lost more than half of his Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm subordinates in the previous battle, and all those below the Sixth-Order had been killed or captured. If he remained here, he would just be waiting for his death. He might as well escape as soon as possible and find a place to recuperate, then look for an opportunity to make a comeback.

When everyone came to their senses, all they saw dazzling nebulas and stars all around them. It was quite a beautiful sight.

Everyone was stunned by this gorgeous and stunning scene; even Yang Kai raised his brow slightly. Although he had seen many Great Territories, a beautiful Great Territory like this was still extremely rare.

No Great Territory could compare to this place.

There were many stars in the sky, indicating that there were many Universe Worlds in this Great Territory. There was also a Sun Star just a few million kilometres away, shining brightly while the occasional golden flare would arc up around it.

Yang Kai turned his head and looked around, silently investigating.

To his side, Qing Kui took out his Universe Chart and checked his location, trying to determine their position. A moment later, his eyes went wide in shock.

Su Ying Xue, who was standing next to him, curiously turned around and asked, “What’s wrong?”

Qing Kui raised his eyes and stared at her in a daze, muttering, “This Great Territory is not marked on the Universe Chart!”

Su Ying Xue was stunned for a moment before asking in astonishment, “Really?”

Yue He, Hui Gu, and the others also turned to look at him, their eyes filled with shock.

“What do you mean?” Duan Hong Chen didn’t understand, and the other Great Emperors also wore similar expressions; they could not understand why the others were so shocked.

Although the various Great Emperors of the Star Boundary had been brought to Void Land by Yang Kai many years ago, they had been cultivating in seclusion almost the entire time and had only recently advanced to the Sixth-Order. They didn’t know much about the Outer Universe, so naturally, they didn’t know what a Great Territory that was not marked on the map represented. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Even Yang Kai didn’t dare to be certain and could only make some speculations.

Yue He and the others also took out their Universe Charts and checked to confirm it themselves. They discovered that Qing Kui was not lying to them, this Great Territory was not marked on the Universe Chart. Which also meant that they were unable to determine their current location on the Universe Chart.

It had to be known that even the Great Territory where the Star Boundary was located was marked on the Universe Chart. However, it was given a generic identification code as it was too remote and desolate, showing just how comprehensive the Universe Chart was.

The Universe Chart contained all of the Great Territories that had been discovered and explored, not a single one was left out.

But now, the Great Territory they were in was not marked on the Universe Chart, which left only one possibility.

“This is a Great Territory that has not yet been discovered!” Qing Kui excitedly stated.

Bustling World Great Emperor and the others were stunned for a moment before understanding the meaning behind Qing Kui’s words, “A new Great Territory?”

Qing Kui repeatedly nodded, “En, a new Great Territory!”

A new Great Territory meant unimaginable resources and wealth that could be obtained. Presumably, if news of this new Great Territory were to spread, it would definitely cause a huge uproar!

“How could there be a new Great Territory?” Martial Beast Great Emperor furrowed his brow. He had just heard from Qing Kui that in ancient times, every Great Territory existed on its own, and everyone thought that the Great Territory they were in was the entire world. It was only after the Great Experts of ancient times created many Territory Gates, connecting many Great Territories, that the current 3,000 Worlds was formed.

But after so many years of exploration, all of the Great Territories had been discovered. There should not be any new Great Territories.

Qing Kui replied, shaking his head, “I don’t know, perhaps some ancient Great Expert did not mark it when they were developing the Territory Gates, or perhaps it’s a Newborn Great Territory.”

Suddenly, Yang Kai, who had remained silent until now, finally spoke, “This Great Territory is very young!”

Using the word ‘young’ to describe a Great Territory was undoubtedly strange, but everyone immediately understood what Yang Kai meant.

The mysteries of a Universe World’s life and death were difficult to comprehend even for those with extraordinary cultivation at the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. The annihilation and rebirth of a Great Territory was even more out of their reach and definitely not something they could comprehend with their current cultivation.

No one knew when this Great Territory was born, but Yang Kai could sense the young and tender age of the nearby Sun Star.

Just like how he felt that the Sun in the Black Territory was getting old thanks to his Golden Crow’s True Fire having a special connection with Sun Stars.

In contrast to the sun of the Black Territory which was like an old man with one foot in the grave, the Sun Star in front of him was a newborn baby.

[I must lay full claim to this place!]

If it were any other time, such a great discovery would have made all of them ecstatic; however, everyone was chasing after Zuo Quan Hui now and their futures would be fraught with worries and dangers if they couldn’t find him.

Yang Kai was originally a bit worried that Zuo Quan Hui would escape completely; after all, he was already two hours behind him. Two hours for a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was plenty of time to do many things and travel a great deal of distance.

However, since they had confirmed that this was a new Great Territory, there was no need to worry about that.

Zuo Quan Hui had borrowed Yang Kai’s strength to break through the Territory Barrier and escape to this place. Before, it seemed like he had managed to find a slim chance of survival by some stroke of luck, but by the looks of it, it was a stroke of bad luck and he had fallen into a hopeless situation.

There was only one Territory Gate, so Zuo Quan Hui had nowhere to run. He was like a turtle hiding in his own shell!

“Let’s leave the matter of this new Great Territory for later, pursuing Zuo Quan Hui comes first!” Yang Kai shouted as he headed in a certain direction without giving anyone an explanation, following some traces which were left behind. Everyone quickly restrained their excitement and followed closely behind him.

Along the way, they all did their best to recover their strength and energy.

Yang Kai was not using Space Principles. First of all, doing so would consume a lot of his strength and he was trying to conserve every bit of his energy now to increase his chances of winning against Zuo Quan Hui. Second of all, it would be inconvenient for him to track the traces left behind while using Instantaneous Movement.

Luan Bai Feng was right behind Yang Kai, so she was both shocked and impressed.

If she had just made a guess when she saw Yang Kai let that Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Myriad Demons Heaven disciple go, she was dead certain now.

[The man who had broken through to the Sixth-Order from the Fifth-Order must be Yang Kai’s spy!]

[But how is that possible? That guy was obviously a Myriad Demons Heaven’s disciple, so when did Yang Kai get involved with him?]

She vaguely remembered that when she was in Heavenly Sword Palace, Pei Wen Xuan had addressed that guy as Junior Brother Mo Sheng!

There were almost undetectable traces of Demon Qi left in the void, so it was obvious that this guy named Mo Sheng had deliberately left a trail for Yang Kai to follow. If not for this, Yang Kai might not have been able to find Zuo Quan Hui in this vast void no matter how much he wanted to find the latter.

Luan Bai Feng couldn’t help but admire him! The more she looked at Yang Kai, the more she felt that this guy was even more scheming than Zuo Quan Hui. [What kind of sly and scheming mind is hidden behind this young man’s face? It’s one thing to send me into Heavenly Sword Union, but to think he can even put his nose into Myriad Demons Heaven is another thing altogether. It’s Myriad Demons Heaven! One of the famous 36 Cave Heavens!]

“What is it?” Yang Kai turned his head to look, sensing Luan Bai Feng’s strange gaze.

Luan Bai Feng shook her head and failed to hold her laughter, “This Mistress is thinking that her losing to you back then was not undeserved, Sir!”

Yang Kai snorted lightly, “If you have something to say, just say it!”

Luan Bai Feng slowly shook her head, not saying anything.

Yang Kai looked at her with a perplexed look on his face. After seeing that she really had nothing to say, he couldn’t be bothered with her and focused on chasing after the enemy.

Although Zuo Quan Hui only had a head start of two hours, a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was not slow. It was not easy to catch up to him. Fortunately, Yang Kai and the others also needed to recover, so they were not in a rush.

After five days, a rich Universe World aura blew on their faces as a Star appeared in front of them.

It was an azure world and should have been peaceful and tranquil, but looking at it from the void, they could clearly see that the weather on the surface of the Universe World was rapidly degrading, thunderstorms could be seen everywhere!

“Over there!” Yang Kai stopped in his tracks as he looked towards that Universe World, narrowing his eyes.

Wu Kuang’s trail pointed directly towards the Universe World in front of him.

Qing Kui frowned for a moment before his expression suddenly changed, “Damn it, Zuo Quan Hui is trying to refine the World Force of that Universe World to recover!”

Su Ying Xue’s pretty face sank, “To think that someone from Thousand Crane Paradise would actually use such despicable methods!”
