“All… All of it?” Kang Si Ran was shocked. That was thirty million Mid-Rank Source Crystals worth, not thirty million Low-Rank Source Crystals. Even if it was exchanged for High-Rank Source Crystals, it would still be worth 300,000 pieces.

“All of it!” Yang Kai nodded sincerely.

Kang Si Ran immediately realized that this may be the biggest deal he had ever made. With this, even if he was transferred, he wouldn’t be transferred to the middle of nowhere.

Before his pleasant surprise could fade though, Yang Kai continued, “In addition, I also wish to entrust Brother Kang to continue acquiring Space Spirit Crystals and Space Spirit Jade for me. I’ll take as much as you can gather.”

Kang Si Ran drew a breath of cold air.

Space Spirit Crystal and Space Spirit Jade were the basic materials used to refine Space Rings, but they were not considered very valuable items in the Star Boundary. Many cultivators kept a dozen or more Space Rings on them at all times, but this couldn’t be helped as it was far easier to toss over a Space Ring directly during a trade.

As such, demand for these two materials wasn’t too big or too small. Since Yang Kai decided to take all the thirty million Mid-Rank Source Crystals worth of their stock in one breath, and even wanted to continue gathering more, just how many Space Rings was he intending to refine?

Kang Si Ran calmed himself down before answering, “This branch only has thirty million Mid-Rank Source Crystals worth, but we should have more in stock at headquarters. We can also send more over from the other branches. Brother Yang, are you sure you want all of them? It’s not going to be a small amount of money.”

If each branch had thirty million Mid-Rank Source Crystals worth of materials, then ten branches would be three hundred million, and a hundred would become three billion. Violet Source Chamber of Commerce has hundreds of branches in the Southern Territory, so if he really intended to take everything, then it would definitely cost upwards of tens of millions of High-Rank Source Crystals.

Tens of millions of High-Rank Source Crystals! This was definitely going to be a gigantic deal.

If this deal was successful, then this merit alone would be enough for Kang Si Ran to be promoted to a Branch President! Only his cultivation was a little poor and was not enough to convince the public. After all, the chamber of commerce had its rules. Only Emperor Realm Masters could assume the role of Branch President.

If someone else had come to Kang Si Ran with a deal like this, then he wouldn’t have tried to persuade them against it and would just agree to it, but the one bringing in this business was Yang Kai, so how could Kang Si Ran not be concerned for his sake?

Worried that Yang Kai didn’t know the weight of the numbers, Kang Si Ran even made a point to highlight the figures for him.

“I’m sure,” Yang Kai smiled, “Unless Brother Kang is unable to facilitate such a deal?”

Kang Si Ran was frank, “For a deal of this size, a small Manager like me really can’t make the final decision.”

Yang Kai was just casually making a joke, but he didn’t expect it to be true and he couldn’t help but be surprised.

Kang Si Ran said, “Brother Yang, if you’re really interested in this deal, then this Kang will go and ask the President to come and talk to you personally.”

Yang Kai responded, “Good!”

“Please wait a moment,” After saying that, Kang Si Ran immediately headed out of the room.

Outside the door, Gu Hong smiled when he saw Kang Si Ran walk out, “Manager Kang, how is the discussion going? Do you need this Gu’s help?”

Kang Si Ran grunted, “I won’t trouble you, Manager Gu.”

Gu Hong sneered lightly and flicked his sleeve, “Can’t appreciate kindness.” He had to maintain the image of the chamber of commerce in front of Yang Kai and naturally couldn’t be impolite, but there was no need for him to be patient with Kang Si Ran.

Seeing Kang Si Ran head straight upstairs though, Gu Hong frowned.

It was almost as if Kang Si Ran was intending to go see the Branch President. Could it be that the business was big enough that even a Manager was unable to make the call? Gu Hong suddenly panicked. If that were the case, then Kang Si Ran would receive a huge merit from this transaction, and might even be able to secure his position in the branch.

Worry began to show on Gu Hong’s face.

A short time from now, someone with a strong background would be transferred from the headquarters in order to take on the Manager position, but the number of Managers in each branch was set, so if someone came down from above, then one of the current Managers here would have to give up their position.

Originally, according to performance and cultivation, the person who would have to give up his position was definitely Kang Si Ran, but if he managed to secure his position with a big deal, it may become Gu Hong’s turn to be transferred.

Regardless of who it was, someone had to go.

Maplewood City was a good place with many cultivators and plenty of business opportunities, so how could Gu Hong bear to leave? A year of hard work here was worth two or three years of hard work in other branches, which was why he was constantly making things hard for Kang Si Ran and snatching away his business. Everything was in order to cut off all hope of Kang Si Ran staying here and forcing him to be transferred away. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

But now, he could possibly lose everything! This made Gu Hong both shocked and angry.

While his thoughts were in turmoil, he saw the President walking down with Kang Si Ran as he had expected. Gu Hong’s face sank as he realized this business was truly large enough to move even the President himself. Just how big a deal could this be?

Gu Hong felt disgruntled as he wondered how Kang Si Ran could have such good luck.

In front of the private room, Kang Si Ran knocked gently on the door and only opened it after receiving Yang Kai’s response. He then stood aside and said respectfully, “President, please!”

A short, elderly man stepped in and looked at Yang Kai with a sharp gaze.

Yang Kai raised his brows and got up, cupping his fists, “Greetings, President Luo!”

The Branch President in charge here in Maplewood City actually turned out to be Violet Source Chamber of Commerce’s Vice President Lou Chi! It could be seen from this how important the Violet Source Chamber of Commerce regarded Maplewood City.

Yang Kai had seen this man before in his early years, and naturally wouldn’t have forgotten him so quickly.

“You know this Old Master?” Lou Chi was a bit surprised. Even though he was the Vice President of Violet Source Chamber of Commerce, and also the Branch President of Maplewood City, he usually kept to himself, so barely anyone saw him nowadays. As such, he was naturally surprised that Yang Kai was able to recognize him at first glance. But upon closer inspection, Yang Kai seemed vaguely familiar, as if he’d met him somewhere before.

Lou Chi was even more surprised when he released his Divine Sense as he discovered that the cultivation of this young man in front of him was actually no worse than his. They were both First-Order Emperors.

When he heard Kang Si Ran’s report that a friend of his had come to discuss a large deal, Lou Chi didn’t think much about it; after all, what sort of friend could a man with Kang Si Ran’s cultivation have?

But now he realized that he was wrong. This young man was an Emperor Realm Master!

Immediately putting away his contempt, Luo Chi smiled, “This Old Master seems to have met this little friend somewhere!”

Yang Kai smiled back, “This Junior was there when Star Soul Palace’s Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda was opened in Maplewood City. I was also there when the Four Seasons Realm opened.”

Lou Chi thought for a moment before his eyes lit flashed, “You are…”

“Yang Kai!”

Lou Chi’s face sank as he shouted, “Your courage isn’t small! How dare you show yourself so openly!”

His attitude changed so quickly that Kang Si Ran was taken aback. He had no idea what Yang Kai had done to offend Lou Chi.

Yang Kai was also stunned, but quickly, he understood Luo Chi’s reaction. It must have something to do with Star Soul Palace. There were certain things that Kang Si Ran may not be able to come across, but Lou Chi certainly wasn’t uninformed.

Smiling, Yang Kai commented, “If my conscience is clear, why wouldn’t I dare to show myself?”

Lou Chi eyed him, “Indeed, you have the courage, but I’m not sure how your fate will be.”

Yang Kai said, “President Luo, are you interested in discussing business, or are we going to leave things at this? If you’re not interested, I can look for Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce. I assume that they would be very interested in this deal.”

“Of course we can discuss business! Why wouldn’t we be able to?” Lou Chi grunted. Yang Kai had deliberately used the old rival of Violet Source Chamber of Commerce to provoke him. It was clearly bait, but business was still business, and Lou Chi wouldn’t let any opportunity slip past him.

With a gesture from Yang Kai, Lou Chi sat down, “Little friend, please sit as well!”

Yang Kai glanced at Kang Si Ran who was standing beside Lou Chi.

Lou Chi instantly saw this and motioned, “Manager Kang, please sit as well.”

At that same time, he was thinking to himself, [Does this Yang Kai think so highly of Kang Si Ran? The two of them seem to share a good relationship.]

Kang Si Ran was a little intimidated, but since Lou Chi had spoken, he could only sit with them, looking slightly cautious.

Lou Chi cut straight to the point, “I heard Manager Kang say that the business that this little friend wants to talk about is worth tens of millions of High-Rank Source Crystals?”

“Exactly so! I just don’t know if President Luo can swallow such a meal or not,” Yang Kai nodded.

Lou Chi laughed, “There is no business that my Violet Source Chamber of Commerce can’t handle! But may I ask what little friend needs so many Space Spirit Crystals and Space Spirit Jade for?”

Yang Kai smiled, “That is not President Luo’s concern, is it?”

Lou Chi was stunned, but then he smiled, “It was this Old Master who asked too much.” After a brief silence, he went on, “The amount of goods needed by little friend is too high. It is not that this Old Master doesn’t trust little friend, but shouldn’t little friend also show some sincerity?”

As soon as he said that, Yang Kai tossed a Space Ring over to him, “Here is the deposit. President Luo, please see if it’s to your satisfaction.”

Lou Chi took it and swept the contents with his Divine Sense. Immediately, he could see High-Rank Source Crystals piled up like a mountain, at least ten million pieces.

He instantly became serious as he realized that Yang Kai really did have the capital for this transaction and nodded, “Good, little friend is a man of integrity, so this Old Master will be direct as well. Within two months, this Old Master can transfer forty million High-Rank Source Crystals worth of materials for you. At that time, this Old Master also hopes that little friend can bring enough Source Crystals to my chamber of commerce for the exchange.”

“Of course!” Yang Kai nodded, “But I have one condition.”

Lou Chi urged, “Please!”

Yang Kai looked at Kang Si Ran, “I will only hand this matter over to Manager Kang. No one else.”

Lou Chi frowned, “Why is that so? Is it because little friend does not trust my Violet Source Chamber of Commerce?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “How could I not trust your noble chamber’s name? It’s just that I have a close relationship with Manager Kang, so I feel more comfortable dealing with him.”

Lou Chi couldn’t help but look a little troubled. The reason for that was because Kang Si Ran was definitely going to be transferred in two months. When that time came, how was he going to deal with Yang Kai if he wasn’t even in Maplewood City? But this business could bring huge profits to the chamber of commerce, so Lou Chi couldn’t help but consider it carefully.

Realizing the situation, Luo Chi looked up and asked, “Does little friend perhaps intend to help Manager Kang by doing this?”

He could vaguely guess that Yang Kai intended to keep Kang Si Ran in the affluent Maplewood City, so he shook his head, “Little friend’s proposal is meaningless. Even though little friend may help Manager Kang stay in Maplewood City for two more months, he will still have to be transferred after the materials are delivered.”

Yang Kai frowned, “President Luo really can’t do anything about it?”

Lou Chi explained, “This was a decision made by the headquarters. This Old Master is powerless to interfere.”

Kang Si Ran was already extremely grateful just for this gesture and was just about to speak when Yang Kai stopped him with a raised hand, “What if I say that there is more business I can do with Manager Kang? A long term cooperation!”

Luo Chi narrowed his eyes, “That will depend on what kind of business it is.”

Yang Kai casually brushed his hand on the table and a bright, round, and full longan-sized Monster Beast Core immediately appeared, one that pulsed with rich Monster Qi.
