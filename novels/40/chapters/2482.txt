“Take a look at this. I took it from Wu Meng Chuan. He tried to destroy it before he died. I’m not sure if there’re any secrets hidden inside.” The Embodiment tossed something to Yang Kai right before he entered the Sealed World Bead.

Yang Kai took a closer look at the object in his hand. It was a jade slip. At a glance, it appeared to have been worn through the years and seemed to have been passed down for a number of generations.

Moreover, many seals were placed on this jade slip. Yang Kai tried to crack them, but didn’t have any success.

The techniques employed in these seals were extremely old and complicated. Yang Kai studied it for a while, but did not learn anything.

According to the Embodiment, he had taken the jade slip from Wu Meng Chuan, who tried to destroy it just before he died. It seemed that the jade slip had a lot of history and secrets that needed to be kept hidden and Wu Meng Chuan did not want Yang Kai to uncover them.

But what secrets were so valuable that Wu Meng Chuan felt the need to destroy them before he died so no one could ever discover them?

Wu Meng Chuan was the descendant of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, and this Shattered Star Sea happened to be the burial place of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. Yang Kai had a deduction that this jade slip was related to Heaven Devouring Great Emperor.

He kept the jade slip solemnly and left the Shattered Star.

After his death, Yang Kai obtained Wu Meng Chuan’s seven-pointed Star Seal, as well as his Space Ring. However, there was nothing valuable in this Space Ring. The Blood Spirit Bottle, the only inheritance the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor had passed down to Wu Meng Chuan, was indeed a priceless treasure, but unfortunately, it was destroyed by the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

Yang Kai’s Star Seal still showed no signs of upgrading even after devouring Wu Meng Chuan’s seven-pointed Star Seal.

It was rumoured that if one could obtain the highest nine-pointed Star Seal, the inheritance of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor could be found.

Yang Kai guessed that this was most likely not true considering how many people would need to be killed to upgrade a Star Seal to the peak nine-points, and the fact that not everyone was compatible with the inheritance of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. After all, Yang Kai had already experienced the power and horrors of the Heaven Devouring Battle Law and even if someone obtained it here, it may not be a blessing but rather a curse.

Therefore, Yang Kai was not too concerned about this matter from the beginning, and he assumed that no one could ever reach the highest tier of Star Seal.

Yang Kai returned to the Source Sea after a day.

Yang Kai only left the Source Sea because he was too eager to inquire about information regarding the Heaven Devouring Battle Law from Wu Meng Chuan, but now that the Embodiment had broken through his bottleneck, he naturally returned.

There was still a lot of Source Strength in the Source Sea that he had not absorbed and refined, so how could Yang Kai just miss out on such a good opportunity?

When Yang Kai arrived at the Source Sea, he discovered that it was vastly different from before.

He looked around and found that the size of the Source Sea had been greatly reduced while the number of cultivators present had multiplied. Yang Kai wondered what happened in the Source Sea this past month since he left.

Above the Source Sea, an endless number of battles of various sizes were taking place. Countless cultivators gathered and fought, with many dying and falling into the Source Sea, leaving behind no trace of their existence.

Compared to before, there were obviously many more clashes.

Yang Kai could not help frowning at the multitude of people who came to the Source Sea. Obviously, someone had spread the information that led to many cultivators gathering here in flocks.

This also proved that the Source Sea was indeed very beneficial to cultivators.

However, where there were many people, there would naturally be more disputes. In such a chaotic situation, it would be difficult to absorb and refine Source Strength in peace.

Yang Kai realized the situation was worse than what he had seen from afar when he flew closer.

Not only were there more battles between cultivators, the entire Source Sea was also exuding a very strange aura at this moment. Yang Kai could clearly sense that the Source Sea was slowly flowing towards a certain direction in a manner even more turbulent than the one he caused previously.

Did someone else possess a treasure similar to the Sealed World Bead? Otherwise, what could have caused the Source Sea to have such a phenomenon?

Yang Kai became extremely wary.

But he did not plan to linger outside for long. For now, his plan was to dive into the depths to investigate as he did last time. The Source Strength in the inner region was richer and purer, so absorbing and refining there for a day was comparable to a month on the outside.

Suddenly, Yang Kai felt something and instinctively looked in one direction.

A pair of bright eyes were staring at him from that direction.

The two pairs of eyes met each other and Yang Kai’s expression immediately brightened and he turned and dashed over.

Because the person looking at him was actually Liu Yan!

A year after entering the Shattered Star Sea, Yang Kai separated from Liu Yan and the others, even Sister Hua ventured out to seek for her own opportunities. Yang Kai had been alone since then and could not help feeling a bit lonesome from time to time.

He did not expect to meet again in the Source Sea at this moment.

Although it was a coincidence, it was also inevitable.

At this moment, the Source Sea had likely gathered seventy to eighty percent of the remaining cultivators in the entire Shattered Star Sea. Liu Yan and the others must have also heard the news of the Source Sea and joined the crowd.

The little girl from the Zhang Family stood gracefully beside Liu Yan with a healthy glow to her face.

Liu Yan nudged Zhang Ruo Xi quietly and whispered something as Yang Kai flew over. The next moment, Zhang Ruo Xi turned her head to look at Yang Kai and her eyes lit up.

She immediately shouted when Yang Kai stopped in front of them, “Sir!”

Perhaps because of meeting Yang Kai again, Zhang Ruo Xi’s little face flushed pink and her eyes smiled cheerfully, looking extremely happy.

Yang Kai smiled lightly and was about to speak when he suddenly gaped at Zhang Ruo Xi, scanning her up and down.

The little girl was flustered by Yang Kai’s ogle.

“Third-Order Dao Source Realm!” Yang Kai gasped, hardly believing his eyes. Zhang Ruo Xi had broken through from the First-Order Dao Source Realm to Third-Order Dao Source Realm in less than two years! To have such cultivation speed in an environment where World Energy was thin, such as the Shattered Star Sea, Yang Kai was astonished.

Yang Kai was already aware that Zhang Ruo Xi possessed a very special bloodline that very likely contained a shocking secret. As long as she had the resources, her cultivation speed would be unbelievably fast; however, he still looked at her in a completely different light from before.

On the contrary, Liu Yan did not seem to have much growth in strength. She was still a Third-Order Dao Source Realm, but her aura was undoubtedly more solid and pure.

They seemed to be holding up very well even without Yang Kai’s care during this period of time.

“I could only reach the Third-Order Dao Source Realm because Big Sister Liu Yan gave me all her cultivation resources!” Zhang Ruo Xi explained quietly, “It was all thanks to Big Sister Liu Yan!”

Liu Yan smiled softly but did not speak.

Yang Kai nodded in acknowledgement, “That would also require you to have the necessary talent.”

Without shocking aptitude, there was no way to reach such a height in such a short period of time, even with unlimited resources.

Yang Kai suddenly felt some anticipation thinking about the achievements this little girl from the Zhang Family would have in the future.

“Master, have you seen Sister Hua during this time?” Liu Yan asked abruptly. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Yang Kai shook his head, “I haven’t.”

Zhang Ruo Xi pressed on worriedly, “I don’t know how Sister Hua has been during this time.”

The three girls were often together in the Sealed World Bead, and had developed deep affection for one another. It was only natural for them to worry now that they had reunited with Yang Kai, but Hua Qing Si was still nowhere to be seen.

In less than two years without Yang Kai, Liu Yan and Zhang Ruo Xi had encountered countless distasteful scenes. They had relied on Liu Yan’s White Tiger Heaven Grade puppet countless times to escape from those troubles. At the same time, their innocence was worn away, especially Zhang Ruo Xi’s. She now gave off a faint sense of maturity.

“Don’t worry too much about Sister Hua,” although Yang Kai was worried too, he could only console them, “Sister Hua is different from you. She is experienced and a disciple of Star Soul Palace, she also has the Five-Coloured Spear. Most people are not her opponents.”

“But there are many people in the Shattered Star Sea who have broken through to the Emperor Realm,” Zhang Ruo Xi whispered.

“Yes, there are some, but not many. Sister Hua is not so unlucky. Moreover, the ones who broke through to the Emperor Realm are all elite disciples of top Sects who won’t bully others for no reason,” Yang Kai comforted them for a while before smartly changing topics, “What are you doing here? It’s very dangerous here. You should find a place to refine and absorb Source Strength instead of standing around!”

“Little Sister Xiao Qi is here!” Liu Yan expressed.

“Who?”

Liu Yan pointed in a certain direction.

Yang Kai’s eyes followed the direction and his eyes widened as he exclaimed, “Mo Xiao Qi!”

Over there, a woman involved in an intense battle was none other than Mo Xiao Qi! The butterfly-shaped birthmark on her face was still as vivid as when Yang Kai had first met her, so it was easy to recognize her.

Yang Kai only made two friends when he first arrived in Maplewood City. One was Spirit Pill Plaza’s shopkeeper Kang Si Ran, and the other was this mischievous little girl, Mo Xiao Qi.

It was a pity when Kang Si Ran was transferred away by Violet Source Chamber of Commerce after he broke through to the Dao Source Realm, while Mo Xiao Qi had disappeared without a trace, leaving only the inexplicable message that, ‘Aunty Feng caught me, I need to leave first!’

Yang Kai had met the so-called Aunty Feng.

She had smashed Yang Kai’s wooden ship Artifact to pieces without hurting him with a single palm and her powerful Third-Order Emperor Realm cultivation.

The boat he was currently using was given as compensation by Aunty Feng.

That was also the first time Yang Kai had seen the power of a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master. Facing such a Master, Yang Kai felt a deep sense of powerlessness. Fortunately, Aunty Feng had no malice against him, otherwise, Yang Kai would already be dead.

Regarding the origins of Mo Xiao Qi, Yang Kai was clueless about it at the time and only knew that her background was extraordinary. However, Yang Kai also had a rough idea of her true identity after having travelled the Star Boundary over the years and gradually becoming more informed.

She was the daughter of Eastern Territory Spirit Beast Island’s Master, Martial Beast Great Emperor!

There were two mysterious islands in the Eastern Territory, one was Spirit Beast Island, the retreat of one of the Ten Great Emperors, the Martial Beast Great Emperor. Although it was not a Sect per se, it was famous throughout the Star Boundary, a place that no one did not know.

The second one was the legendary Dragon Island! It was rumoured that many True Dragons were living on that island, but almost no one knew where it was located, or even if it really existed.

Nonetheless, the name of Dragon Island left a deep impression on any who heard it.
