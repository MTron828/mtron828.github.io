[Wait… An iron wok?] Li Jiao’s eyes narrowed as he suddenly recalled a dusty memory in a corner of his mind and brought it to the surface again, and the next thought that popped into his mind terrified him out of his wits.

“That treasure…” Hua Xing clearly recognized the origin of that iron wok too and a horrified expression flashed across his face, “Don’t tell me it’s…”

Before he could finish his sentence, he felt a sharp pain shooting up his arm. Li Jiao had taken the opportunity to launch a sneak attack on him while he was distracted, and one of his arms exploded into dust as a result.

“Old Dog Li, how dare you deceive me!?” He roared in grief and rage. He hastily retreated and put some distance between him and Li Jiao as blood gushed out from the wound like a fountain.

Li Jiao followed close behind, completely unrelenting in his attacks as he shouted, “One may eat as much rice as they like, but they cannot spit out words carelessly! When have I ever deceived you?!”

“Who was the one to tell me that these two have nothing to do with any of the Great Emperors?!” Hua Xing’s expression was so distorted that it was hideous to see. He was both furious and extremely anxious. [If I had known that the little girl is related to a Great Emperor, I wouldn’t have dared to make her my enemy!]

Li Jiao sweated as he mumbled, “If I said I didn’t know either, would you believe me?”

That was the honest truth as he knew about Yang Kai’s situation, which had nothing to do with the Great Emperors. Therefore, he assumed that the little girl did not come from any special background either; however, he realized his mistake upon seeing that mysterious iron wok that could even absorb a descendent of the Divine Spirit in an instant.

That little girl wasn’t just related to a Great Emperor, she was clearly very closely related to them! Moreover, that Great Emperor in particular was the most battle-crazy and brutal among the Ten Great Emperors. Even the other Great Emperors could not afford to provoke that person easily.

Hua Xing thought to himself. [That little girl is definitely related to him! We should have never provoked her!]

“As if I’ll believe you!” Hua Xing roared furiously. His entire being was akin to a volcano that was about to erupt. His vitality attacked his heart, and his defence was full of holes. He was beaten up by Li Jiao so badly that he could not fight back.

Originally, he could have dealt with Li Jiao to a certain extent; however, he had long lost his composure after everything that happened. Combined with the loss of his arm, the gap between them immediately became apparent.

He received another blow and flew backwards from the force, bleeding non-stop. Before he could stabilize his body though, a monstrous figure suddenly descended from the sky, its humongous shadow looming over him.

Shocked, Hua Xing raised his head to look and saw Yang Kai slamming a fist down at him with a ferocious expression. He did not dare to let his guard down and hastily defended against the attack. Nevertheless, all defences were like paper in front of that punch.

The violent force smashed him down into the ground. He fell against the ground so hard that it created a deep hole in the ground. Meanwhile, Yang Kai landed next to him in pursuit and stepped on him, causing him to be unable to move. Hua Xing’s eyes were filled with fear and panic as he shouted, “Please spare me!”

Yang Kai glanced down at him from above and said lightly, “Your life is not in my hands.” He lifted his head to look at Lin Yun’er and asked, “How should I deal with this person?”

Lin Yun’er replied, “Master says that trouble needs to be removed from the roots up…”

Before she could finish her sentence, the strength within Yang Kai’s legs surged and he stomped down.

Hua Xing died!

On the other hand, Li Jiao broke out in cold sweat. [Hua Xing was a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master! Moreover, he was the leader of a top Sect! I can’t believe Palace Master Yang killed him just like that! There was no room for negotiations whatsoever! Isn’t Palace Master Yang a little too crazy?! No; thinking about it, it’s not the first time he did this either. He annihilated the entire Seeking Passion Sect back in the Northern Territory too. What was Hua Xing in comparison?]

Turning his head, he glanced at Wind and Cloud Pavilion, which was currently in chaos and sighed, knowing that this great Sect was completely done for. The inheritance of such a large Sect that had lasted for over ten thousand years ended in a single day. From the Pavilion Master at the top down to the elites of the Sect beneath him… Not a single one of them was spared; all of them died.

[What a headache…] Back in the Northern Territory, Yang Kai had turned the entire place upside down. Li Jiao couldn’t believe that Yang Kai didn’t even bother holding back at all even after coming to the Western Territory.

Even so, Li Jiao looked at the girl standing next to Yang Kai and knew that nothing would happen to Yang Kai regardless of what crazy things he did. However, that girl was different. That girl though… wasn’t someone simple either… T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

After a series of cracklings, Yang Kai returned to his original form. Fortunately, the Great Soaring Black Dragon Armor was very flexible or he would have been naked again.

“Wang wang wang!”

The black puppy ran over leisurely. It had gone into hiding during that earth-shaking battle just now and disappeared off somewhere, but now that the dust had settled, it immediately reappeared again. Its innate ability to seek fortune and avoid disaster was first-class.

Yang Kai glanced at it sullenly and decidedly ignored it. He was covered in numerous wounds inflicted by the Yin Yang Five Elements Everchanging Profound Sword Formation just now, some so deep that even his bones were visible. Even so, he ignored his wounds, took out a new set of clothes, and put them on. Glancing sideways at Li Jiao, he said, “Please take care of that little girl and clean up the rest of the battlefield while you’re at it. I’ll be right back.”

Li Jiao hurriedly replied, “Palace Master Yang, please rest assured. I will fight to the death to protect that girl’s safety.”

Yang Kai nodded and disappeared in the blink of an eye.

Meanwhile, Wind and Cloud Pavilion was a chaotic mess. Countless disciples were trying to escape. The Pavilion Master had died! The Great Elder was dead! All the Elders in the Sect died! Even the elites in the Third-Order Dao Source Realm were dead!

Wind and Cloud Pavilion was doomed to perish. None of them were fools. Several plague-like disasters had attacked the Sect, and if they did not escape now, they would be killed as well!

Despite being a large Sect with thousands of disciples within it, it took less than a quarter of an hour for all the surviving members to flee, every one of them flying off into the sky without looking back at all.

Yang Kai searched for some time before he managed to locate the Treasury of Wind and Cloud Pavilion. Such a large Sect would surely have had some valuable treasures in its stores; therefore, he could not miss out on it. Even though he was extremely wealthy now, it was not enough to finance the expenditures of an entire Sect eternally so he wanted to obtain more cultivation resources so that he could splurge on his family and friends when they arrived from Shadowed Star. After all, they were not few in numbers.

After busying himself for half a day, Yang Kai returned with a good haul. The valuables stored within the storehouse of a top Sect such as Wind and Cloud Pavilion was extremely impressive, no less than what Seeking Passion Sect had once held. Just the High-Rank Source Crystals alone numbered close to a billion, not to mention the countless cultivation resources.

[These treasures will be indispensable to High Heaven Palace.] Yang Kai wandered around Wind and Cloud Pavilion again and collected everything that was of value. It wasn’t until evening rolled around that he returned.

Lin Yun’er and Li Jiao had moved to a nearby mountain peak and when Yang Kai came over, he was immediately greeted by a tantalizing scent. It seemed to be the smell of meat, moreover, meat packed full of energy. The smell entered his nose and greatly stimulated his appetite, even managing to make him feel genuine hunger. Could it be that Lin Yun’er, that little glutton, was cooking something?

“What are you doing?” Yang Kai asked curiously as he walked over, but after a glance, he was dumbfounded.

Lin Yun’er had built a fire on the top of this mountain peak and was using that shabby iron wok to cook over the heat. A gurgling sound was coming from the iron wok as if something was being boiled in it and sure enough; that tantalizing smell came from that iron wok.

Yang Kai felt cold sweat beading on his forehead. Was she really cooking? Moreover, with that iron wok? But inside that was…

Yang Ka couldn’t help feeling a little dizzy at the thought.

“Palace Master Yang, you’re back!” Li Jiao greeted him eagerly as he handed the Space Ring in his hand over, “These are the spoils I gathered from the battlefield earlier. Please check through them, Palace Master Yang.”

Be it Hua Xing or the Elders of Wind and Cloud Pavilion, their Space Rings would surely contain a plethora of valuable treasures. Hua Xing, in particular, as the Pavilion Master of Wind and Cloud Pavilion would have many good things in his Space Ring. Not to mention, there were hundreds of elites in the Third-Order Dao Source Realm. It was a tremendous harvest.

Li Jiao had collected all of them but did not dare to keep them for himself; quickly handing all of them over to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai accepted the Space Ring casually and didn’t even bother to check the inventory nor look inside the ring. He simply stared at Lin Yun’er, who was crouching in front of the iron wok, the corners of his mouth twitching as he asked, “What’s going on?”

At the moment, Lin Yun’er was staring at the iron wok with gleaming eyes and the corners of her mouth were moist; she was clearly on the verge of drooling. When she noticed that Yang Kai had returned, she greeted him absent-mindedly before gulping her saliva and focusing all her energy back on the iron wok in front of her.

“This… young lady is cooking something to eat,” Li Jiao coughed awkwardly and replied.

“Cooking something to eat… With what?” Yang Kai asked casually. However, his expression quickly darkened as he looked over at Li Jiao and asked, “It can’t be…”

Li Jiao nodded grimly.

Yang Kai was shocked, “Is even that okay?!”

Li Jiao hesitated, “Palace Master Yang, could it be that you don’t know the origin of this strange treasure?”

“Do you?”

He replied, “I’ve heard of it. If I’m not mistaken, this wok is known as Unlimited Return.”

“Unlimited Return…” Yang Kai frowned. It was a name he had never heard of before. Still, there was only one thing he was concerned about right now. He walked over and softly called out, “Yun’er.”

Lin Yun’er responded without even raising her head, “It’s almost done, Uncle Yang. Just wait a little longer.”

Wiping at the cold sweat on his forehead, he asked, “Did you really cook that Qilin descendant?”

“En! That’s a descendent of a Divine Spirit. I’ve never eaten one before. I’m sure it’ll be delicious.”

Li Jiao shivered after hearing those words. He was also a descendant of a Divine Spirit and a Dragonborn. [I hope I don’t end up getting boiled in a pot by this girl one day…]

For an instant, he looked at her with shock and awe as if he was looking at his natural-born enemy.

[As expected, I won’t be able to have a good life with Palace Master Yang around. Forget about the Dragon Clan; the worst that could happen is my power being suppressed, but this little girl is even more terrifying! I can’t believe she used the iron wok, Unlimited Return, to capture a descendent of a Divine Spirit and immediately cooked it up…]

Li Jiao felt as if his heart was at its limits. [If I stay around Yang Kai for any longer, I will die of fright, sooner or later. If I value my life, I should stay away from him…]

Yang Kai’s expression turned green, “Yun’er, you have to think this through properly. You can’t just eat things randomly. This guy devoured many Wind and Cloud Pavilion’s disciples earlier.” At this point, his complexion paled slightly.

If it was just a descendent of a Divine Spirit, it wouldn’t have mattered if it was cooked up as food. Besides, it smelled so delicious so its taste was surely even better. The point was that he had personally witnessed it eating many of Wind and Cloud Pavilion’s disciples just now.

[At this moment, all those people are inside this pot too.] When he thought of that, he no longer had any interest in eating. In fact, it would be a miracle not to throw it all up.

Lin Yun’er smiled, however, and waved her hand dismissively, “Don’t worry, Uncle Yang. I cleaned and prepared everything properly first.”

Yang Kai was surprised. He turned to look at Li Jiao.

In response, Li Jiao nodded, “She has indeed cleaned it. I’ve also stored all the sword artifacts that she absorbed previously in one of the Space Rings.”

[It looks like Lin Yun’er really did process it to be eaten while I was gone.]
