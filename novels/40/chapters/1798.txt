“The Divine Bird...” Xu Wei looked confused, unable to understand why the Divine Bird was currently fleeing like a stray dog.

“It looks like it’s having a breakthrough,” Zi Long pondered out loud.

It was not that Zi Long wasn’t knowledgeable enough, it was simply that matters relating to World Principles and Principal Strength were beyond his realm of comprehension.

“Look over there!” Zi Dong suddenly shouted, as if he had discovered something astonishing and pointed in a certain direction. “It’s definitely that little bastard! He’s not dead!”

A few thousand kilometres away, a dazzling light flickered and although it was too far away for Zi Dong to clearly see Yang Kai’s face, he was certain it was him.

After all, at this time, who else could it be besides Yang Kai?

“It’s good he hasn’t died yet!” Zi Long’s eyes flashed, “It seems the heavens are helping me.”

He was quite worried that Yang Kai would be killed by the Divine Bird and the Immortal Tree would be snatched back, but now that he saw Yang Kai was safe and sound, his mood lifted.

As long as the Immortal Tree was still in Yang Kai’s hands, he still had a chance to obtain it!

Without hesitation, Zi Long wrapped Zi Dong in his Saint Qi and hurriedly chased after Yang Kai’s trail.

Not far behind Zi Long’s trio, Ni Guang, Gui Zu and a few others also encountered the Divine Bird that was rushing back to its nest and had to deal with beams of Seven Coloured Radiant Light themselves.

“If the Divine Bird is returning to its nest... then Yang Kai...” After Xue Yue managed to stabilize her footing, her face could not help turning white as she thought of a possibility that she couldn’t accept, her body trembling violently.

In the end, she was still a woman. Many years ago, on that Dead Star, her entire body had been touched by Yang Kai and although she had deeply hated him at the time, it was still the first time a man had ever touched her intimately, so his image was firmly ingrained in her heart. Later, when she was poisoned by the Profound Yin Sunflower Water and her life was hanging by a thread, it was Yang Kai who refined the pill that saved her life.

At that time, she had wanted to win over Yang Kai and keep him by her side, but he had rejected her, saddening and frustrating Xue Yue greatly.

So, over the years, Xue Yue had been brooding over Yang Kai... never once forgetting him.

However, she still had her pride and with her usual manner of conduct, it was simply impossible for her to approach Yang Kai like a normal woman or say the things she felt were shameful. As the next successor of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, she needed to place the chamber of commerce’s prosperity above all else. As for her own happiness and desires, they were nothing but illusions, the moon reflecting in the water.

In the Emperor Garden, Xue Yue was extremely happy to meet Yang Kai for a second time and wanted to have a good talk with him, but when she saw Yang Kai acting so intimately with that enchantress Shan Qing Luo, she lost her temper.

Their reunion did not end well by any measure.

Xue Yue regretted what happened after that for a long time and blamed herself for being impulsive. She secretly made up her mind that, she would be sure to speak to Yang Kai clearly if she had another chance to see him.

But she also knew that the Star Field was incredibly vast, so it was almost impossible for two unrelated people to encounter each other over and over again.

What stunned her was that another reunion really came.

Outside the entrance to the Severed World, Xue Yue could not believe her eyes when he saw Yang Kai arrive.

She wasn’t a naïve little girl who believed in superstitions and had always baulked at the very idea of fate, but she began to believe in it slightly after seeing Yang Kai again.

In the Severed World, facing a life or death crisis, Xue Yue finally put aside everything and forced Yang Kai to take a stand using a reckless and shameless method which ultimately resulted in her achieving her wish.

As she said at the time, her request was not complicated, as long as there was a man in this world who would treat her as a woman, allowing her to experience all the joys of being a woman, she would be satisfied.

But now... that person might very well be dead! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Xue Yue could not accept it and felt as if she had been struck by lightning, standing dumbfounded in place, her pretty face pale and bloodless.

“Yang Boy isn’t dead!” Gui Zu stared forward and said confidently, “Zi Long is still pursuing someone, so he must have found Yang Boy’s trail. We need to chase after them as well, he won’t be able to resist Zi Long if he gets caught!”

Hearing what he said, Xue Yue’s tender body shook, and she turned to look at Ni Guang and cried out, “Uncle Ni!”

Ni Guang remained silent as his Saint Qi enveloped Xue Yue and he flew off together with Gui Zu.

After flying for a while, Ni Guang suddenly said, “Third Young Master, you can be friends with that boy Yang Kai, but don’t get too close. You should know what kind of mission you bear.”

He obviously saw the issue. Whether it was Xue Yue’s performance in the Severed World before or her current behaviour, Ni Guang was able to tell just how much weight Yang Kai held in Xue Yue’s heart.

Xue Yue’s face turned stiff when she heard this, but she soon nodded almost imperceptibly, “I know, Uncle Ni.”

But Gui Zu cut in at that moment with a burst of wicked laughter, “Young love between a man and woman is only natural, what does it have to do with whatever mission she carries? Hahaha, the way you Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce people handle things is quite pitiable.”

Ni Guang’s face changed drastically as he turned his head to stare at Gui Zu in amazement.

“What are you staring at? This old master knows very well this little girl is a woman! I believe you also know,” Gui Zu coldly snorted. “Trying to act all mysterious.”

Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce daring to allow Ni Guang to take Xue Yue out alone for life experience in such a dangerous place was an obvious indicator of his trustworthiness. Moreover, Ni Guang had a Second-Order Origin King cultivation and was absolutely qualified to have access to the top secrets of the chamber of commerce.

As such, Gui Zu was not worried he had let any secrets slip.

In fact, just as Gui Zu expected, only a few throughout Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce knew that Xue Yue was a woman, and Ni Guang was among them.

Ni Guang and President Ai Ou were life and death friends that had known each other since they were young. Over the years, they both made great contributions to the development of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, and it could be said that Ni Guang ranked second only to Ai Ou himself and the Supreme Elders who no longer concerned themselves with worldly affairs.

“How did you learn about this?” Ni Guang was shocked and asked.

“What’s so hard to figure out?” Gui Zu sneered, “This old master not only knows that she’s a woman but also that her physique is unusual. Although I do not know which Special Constitution she possesses, it’s obviously the reason you’ve all gone so far to hide her true gender. En, let this old master guess, a Special Constitution that requires one to conceal their gender, there’s only the rumoured Wonderful Furnace Divine Body and Dragon Marrow Phoenix Body. Looking at this little girl’s appearance, she appears more valiant and heroic than seductive, so she should not be a Wonderful Furnace Divine Body. So, it’s the Dragon Marrow Phoenix Body then? Tsk... this kind of physique is one not seen in ten thousand years.”

Ni Guang was really horrified this time as he glowered at Gui Zu. He had never expected that this old ghost’s eyes were so sharp, only needing a few clues to pinpoint Xue Yue’s Special Constitution.

Xue Yue was also shocked as she looked at Gui Zu in surprise.

She did not believe that Yang Kai told Gui Zu about this as he wasn’t someone with loose lips.

“You...” Ni Guang opened his mouth.

“Relax!” Gui Zu smiled and patted Ni Guang’s shoulder heartily, acting extremely friendly.

Ni Guang was a little wary at first, but soon realized that Gui Zu had no malicious intent, so he simply allowed him to pat his shoulder.

“This old master won’t do anything to this little girl, after all, she is my Sect Master’s woman. Jie Jie Jie Jie... seems like we will all be one big family after this. En, but Sect Master is really blessed, all these two need to do is combine their yin and yang and his strength will increase greatly once more,” Gui Zu laughed wickedly.

“Senior!” Xue Yue was so ashamed her face flushed, and she glared at Gui Zu angrily, blaming him for being so unreserved and disrespectful.

Ni Guang’s head was muddled for a moment as he simply could not keep up with Gui Zu’s pace and instead turned to Xue Yue for answers.

Yet Xue Yue just lowered her head, not daring to say anything.

“Haa...” Ni Guang sighed deeply, “Yue’er, this matter... don’t let your father know about it or he’ll definitely explode. Your Uncle Ni has neither a wife nor children, so you are like a daughter to me. This matter... I’ll find a chance to talk to your father and see what position he takes.”

“Thank you, Uncle Ni!” Xue Yue bit her red lips lightly and whispered.

“Don’t thank me yet, you also know what your father’s temper is like. This will be... difficult,” Ni Guang sighed again before glaring at Gui Zu, “You shameless old bastard, aren’t you embarrassed saying such things in front of a Junior?”

“Heh heh!” Gui Zu smiled weirdly and snorted indifferently.

“But...” Ni Guang looked solemn towards Gui Zu, “You just called that boy your Sect Master, so you two belong to the same Sect? What Sect is that? Why have I never heard of you before?”

Obviously, in Ni Guang’s opinion, a powerful cultivator like Gui Zu could not be unknown, nor could the Sect he belonged to.

But he had never met Gui Zu before, or even heard of him for that matter.

“This old master and Yang Boy do indeed belong to the same Sect, but... it was in the Severed World that this old master decided to join. So, this old master hasn’t actually seen the Sect before.”

Ni Guang stared at Gui Zu in disbelief as he asked in amazement, “You just decided to join? What does that boy’s Sect have that could attract a character like you?”

There must be something extraordinary about Yang Kai’s Sect, otherwise, how could it have won over a Second-Order Origin King? Ni Guang was now very curious what exactly Yang Kai’s Sect possessed that was of such interest to Gui Zu.

“Heh heh!” Gui Zu just grinned and held his tongue, acting mysterious.

[Hmph, if this old master told you there were three Origin King Grade Alchemists in the Sect, wouldn’t your heart stop? This isn’t something this old master will show off easily.]

“Never mind,” Ni Guang waved his hand with disinterest, “If you do not want to explain, that’s fine, but since you belong to it now, that boy’s Sect is certainly not to be looked down on. En, that boy’s aptitude and character are also commendable. It seems Yue’er’s vision isn’t bad. He might be a decent match for her.”

Xue Yue smiled sweetly hearing Ni Guang complimenting Yang Kai, seemingly happier than if that praise had been directed at her.

Ni Guang saw this and could not help sighing once more. Yue’er was normally so shrewd and sharp, so how could she suddenly act like an ordinary love-struck woman?
