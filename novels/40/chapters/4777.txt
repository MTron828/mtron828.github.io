“Let’s sit down and talk.” As the owner of this place, Gu Ling’er beckoned to the others.

Everybody sat down around a stone table. There were spirit fruits and wine laid out on the table so that anybody could help themselves to the refreshments.

Yang Kai originally thought that the Black Ink Disciples would surely discuss various shady topics when they gathered together, but reality could not be further from the truth. Similar to the banquets that he attended recently, these people gathered together to discuss various topics regarding their cultivation and other common anecdotes. It was an extremely harmonious scene.

He couldn’t help feeling strange at the sight. Looking at such a scene, if he had not known that these people were Black Ink Disciples, he would not have suspected them of anything even if he came across this scene. They were no different from ordinary people in any aspect.

Zong Yu Quan and Chang An Yi were arguing over the methods of activating one of the Secret Techniques in Lang Ya Paradise. Both of them were fervently expressing their opinions.

All of a sudden, Gu Ling’er approached Yang Kai and whispered quietly, “Junior Brother Yang, it has not been long since you became a Black Ink Disciple. Have you had any trouble adjusting?”

She was sitting next to Yang Kai, and now that she took the initiative to lean over, the air was suddenly filled with the scent of orchids. Her attitude was incredibly intimate.

Gong Wen Shan and Liang Qiu Hong looked in this direction, then they both smiled slightly. They realised that Yang Kai’s performance during the training must have caught Gu Ling’er’s attention. It was obvious that she was planning to snatch Yang Kai from Gu Pan.

Even after so many years, Gu Ling’er had yet to choose her Dao Partner. The first reason was that she had extremely high standards. Very few Open Heaven Realm Masters in the same Order could catch her attention. The other reason was her identity as a Black Ink Disciple. If she were to enter a long-term relationship with somebody else, there was a high possibility that her identity would be exposed.

Yang Kai was different, however. His strength could practically be said to be the best among all Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. Moreover, he was a Black Ink Disciple himself, so there was nothing for her to worry about.

The path of cultivation could be extremely dull and dreary. In addition, Open Heaven Realm Masters generally had exceptionally long lifespans. It was a good thing to have the company of an excellent person.

Yang Kai naturally inhaled Gu Ling’er’s fragrance, but his attitude remained calm. He nodded in response to the question, “There is something I wanted to ask.”

Even Chang An Yi and Zong Yu Quan, who had been arguing fiercely, stopped speaking and turned to look at him.

Gu Ling’er smiled sweetly, “Please feel free to speak, Junior Brother Yang. We are all Black Ink Disciples. You can consider us family now, so there’s no need to hide anything.”

Yang Kai asked, “As Black Ink Disciples, our Small Universe has been enlightened by the Black Ink. But, will there be any effects on our cultivation in the future?”

They exchanged a glance with each other, and Zong Yu Quan laughed, “So that’s what you’re worried about, Junior Brother Yang! Hmm… If you’re talking about effects, then there are definitely some. But… they are good effects!”

“Oh?” Yang Kai was surprised, “Please enlighten me, Senior Brother Zong!”

Zong Yu Quan replied solemnly, “The Black Ink Strength is mysterious and unparalleled in this world. The biggest advantage we experience is in terms of our advancement. Senior Brother Le Mang received insight recently and will soon advance into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm. You probably saw that too, Junior Brother Yang.”

Yang Kai nodded.

Zong Yu Quan continued, “However, even if Senior Brother Le Mang comprehends the opportunity to advance into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, it will not be easy for him to succeed in his breakthrough. Advancing from the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm will require overcoming a steep threshold. If you succeed in overcoming this challenge, then your horizons will be widened infinitely. On the other hand, if you fail, the best outcome is that you will be stuck in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm forever. If your luck is poor, then there’s a possibility that your Small Universe will become unstable and your cultivation will regress. In the worst case, you might even lose your life. Conversely, Black Ink Disciples like us have no need to worry about such matters. Our Small Universe is protected by the Black Ink Strength, so there won’t be any problems for us when we advance into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm.”

Yang Kai was absolutely amazed, “The Black Ink Strength is so amazing!”

If that was the case, then the Black Ink Strength truly had astonishing properties.

Gu Ling’er smiled and followed up, “That’s just one aspect. The biggest benefit that we enjoy as Black Ink Disciples is that we have broken free from the limitations of the Open Heaven Realm!”

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai asked humbly. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Zong Yu Quan explained, “I heard that you only broke through to the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm when you initially advanced. Is that true, Junior Brother Yang?”

Yang Kai nodded.

Zong Yu Quan gestured around him with his finger, “I’ll be straight with you, Junior Brother. The same was true for us. Logically speaking, the limit of those who advance into the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm is the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, no matter how abundant one’s cultivation resources are. However, that is only true for other Open Heaven Realm Masters. For Black Ink Disciples like us… heh…”

Yang Kai suddenly revealed a look of excitement. Even his breathing became a little disordered, “Senior Brother Zong, are you implying that Black Ink Disciples like us are not bound by such limitations?”

Zong Yu Quan nodded lightly, “That’s right. As long as we work hard in our cultivation and as long as we do not lose our lives during the journey, we can even reach the Supreme Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm!”

“Is that true!?” Yang Kai hastily asked. His animated expression was mixed with disbelief and a degree of worry.

Zong Yu Quan nodded sincerely, “It’s true!”

“Have you ever met such a Master, Senior Brother Zong?”

Zong Yu Quan laughed in embarrassment, “Of course not. Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters are not people we minor characters can meet whenever we want. Nevertheless, this is the truth.”

He could not produce any evidence, but he was absolutely convinced of this matter.

Yang Kai understood that this information was probably told to them by a Black Ink Disciple in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm like Shi Zheng. Be that as it may, he could not determine the truth of the matter. If this was the truth though, then the Black Ink Strength was far too tempting. For an Open Heaven Realm Master, one of their greatest concerns was their innate limitations.

The World Fruit was capable of breaking this limitation to an extent, but it could only be used once. What’s more, how precious were World Fruits? How could ordinary people ever get their hands on one?

On the other hand, if the Black Ink Strength surpassed or even ignored this limitation, then Yang Kai could not imagine what would happen in the future. Would people proactively seek out the Black Ink Strength simply for the sake of making further progress in their cultivation? There was no doubt they would! Who would not wish to become stronger? Who would not wish to stand at the top in the future so that they would never have to be at the mercy of others again?

Yang Kai suddenly recalled something. All the Elders in the Cave Heavens and Paradises were aware of the Black Ink Clan, and the Core Disciples would also be informed by their Honoured Masters after they advanced into the Open Heaven Realm. Aside from them, most others, even the ordinary disciples in the Cave Heavens and Paradises, had never even heard of such matters before.

Since ancient times, the Cave Heavens and Paradises had censored all information regarding the Black Ink Clan. This information was only limited to circulation among the Elders. Consequently, even the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters in the Shattered Heaven were unaware of the reason why they were being targeted by the Cave Heavens and Paradises.

In the past, Yang Kai had not understood the reason for this behaviour either. If the Black Ink Strength was really as corrosive and invasive as he imagined, then logically it would be better for everybody to know about the dangers so that they could take the appropriate precautions.

However, if the Black Ink Strength could also break the limitations of the Open Heaven Realm, then Yang Kai could understand why the Cave Heavens and Paradises had concealed all information regarding the Black Ink Clan! They were afraid that people might not be able to resist the allure of the Black Ink Strength… These were the preventive measures taken by the Cave Heavens and Paradises.

With such considerations in mind, Yang Kai was slightly more convinced that the Black Ink Strength could actually break the limitations of the Open Heaven Realm.

“But… how could this be?” Yang Kai remained puzzled.

“How could people like us possibly understand the Black Ink Strength?” Zong Yu Quan sounded inscrutable. It was most likely that he himself didn’t understand it either.

Yang Kai lowered his head, his black hair casting a dark shadow over his forehead. At the same time, soft laughter suddenly came out from his mouth.

Gu Ling’er exclaimed in astonishment, “What’s wrong, Junior Brother Yang?”

“Hahahahaha!” He suddenly threw his head back and laughed maniacally with a wild expression on his face, “The Heavens have taken pity on me!”

The others exchanged puzzled glances with each other, not understanding why Yang Kai was going crazy.

Fortunately, Gu Ling’er was as intelligent as she was beautiful. After pondering for a while, she explained, “In the past, Junior Brother Yang used to have the ability to advance directly into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm. Unfortunately, several Cave Heavens and Paradises spearheaded by Myriad Demons Cave Heaven were afraid of his potential and greatly suppressed him as a result. I heard that Junior Brother Yang was forced to advance into the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm in the Shattered Heaven under helpless circumstances.”

Roughly 100 years ago, there was a huge uproar over Yang Kai; therefore, many disciples of the Cave Heavens and Paradises had heard about what happened.

Gu Ling’er had inquired about Yang Kai’s, so it was only natural that she had some understanding on the matter. Besides, the fact that Yang Kai had advanced into the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm outside Shadowless Cave Heaven in the Shattered Heaven was not a secret. Many people had witnessed the incident at the time.

Upon hearing her explanation, everybody immediately understood the situation.

Yang Kai originally had the ability to advance directly into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, but he was ultimately forced to advance into the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm. It was a difference of two whole Orders, which was undoubtedly an unbridgeable gap! What’s more, the limitation of the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm was the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm while the limitation of the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm was only the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm.

It was no surprise for Yang Kai to be filled with frustration and rage for all these years. His bright future had been destroyed just like that. Anybody would have a difficult time accepting such a situation.

After learning that the Black Ink Strength could break the shackles of this limitation, it was only natural for him to feel as though he could finally see light in the vast darkness.

Therefore, they more or less understood the reason for his strange reaction.

Zong Yu Quan patted Yang Kai on the shoulder and said earnestly, “You have a long journey ahead of you, Junior Brother Yang. Let us take things slowly. The Black Ink Disciples will surely stand at the top of the 3,000 Worlds one day, and all the others will be dogs beneath our feet!”

Yang Kai gritted his teeth and nodded, “When that time comes, I will definitely raze those Cave Heavens and Paradises to the ground, starting with Myriad Demons Heaven! Only then will I be able to quell the hatred burning in my heart!”

Zong Yu Quan’s mouth fell open in surprise, “You really are ambitious, Junior Brother!”

Yang Kai asked, “Will it be alright for me to do so though? Will it ruin the plans of the higher-ups?”

He pointed to the sky while speaking.

Zong Yu Quan was not in the position to answer that question; after all, he had no clue what the higher-ups were planning.

At that moment, a voice sounded without warning, “If that time comes, this King will accompany you!”

Everybody hurriedly stood up. Likewise, Yang Kai also stood up and looked in the direction where the voice was coming from.

“Greetings, Martial Uncle Yuan!” The others called out in greeting.

“Greetings, Senior Yuan!” Yang Kai cupped his fist with a calm expression.

Yuan Du! One of the three Vice Sect Masters in Lang Ya Paradise! When Yang Kai first arrived at Lang Ya Paradise, Gu Pan had brought him to meet Li Yuan Wang. It was during that particular time that he encountered this person along the way.

Gu Pan had mentioned that Vice Sect Master Yuan Du was extremely fond of receiving flattery from others. At the time, Yang Kai thought that this senior expert in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm had been very friendly. He never imagined that Yuan Du would also be a Black Ink Disciple!

At this moment, Yuan Du had a gentle smile on his face as usual. He was looking at Yang Kai with an approving look, almost like how an Elder would look at the Juniors in the Sect.

Be that as it may, Yang Kai felt a chill running down his back! Even though he had speculated that there were other Black Ink Disciples among the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in Lang Ya Paradise, this person was actually one of the three Vice Sect Masters!

[Just what has Lang Ya Paradise been doing!? I can’t believe that one of their pillars has been corrupted by the Black Ink Strength!]

Upon further consideration though, he recalled the name list that Li Yuan Wang had previously given him. The list had the names of all the Open Heaven Realm Masters who were on friendly terms with Shi Zheng and Zong Yu Quan, and Yuan Du had been listed among them!
