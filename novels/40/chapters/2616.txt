Zhou Yong was certain that if he just showed his resolve, then the Sect Master was sure to agree with him; after all, he had toiled for the Sect for so many years, and all that hard work had to count for something. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Great Elder Zhou, was it?” Yang Kai spoke up with a light laugh, looking towards him with great amusement, “Why don’t you tell Sect Master Fu just why your grandson was killed?”

Fu Bo jolted and realized that he was right. Zhou Yong was quick to accuse someone who had strength equal to a Great Emperor of murdering his grandson, but why would someone with such lofty status randomly decide to attack a First-Order Dao Source Realm Junior? Under normal circumstances, she wouldn’t even spare such a person a glance, much less attack him.

Zhou Yong snorted coldly, “No matter what wrong Ji’er may have committed, you still shouldn’t have killed him!”

Yang Kai was stunned speechless. After a long pause he finally gave an approving nod and declared, “The Great Elder is bold indeed!”

Zhou Yong continued angrily, “Ji’er is my grandson, and any small mistakes he makes is understandable. And yet you people cruelly used lethal force against him! I have come here today because I must take your lives as revenge for my Ji’er!”

“Small mistake!?” Yang Kai couldn’t help but laugh as he turned to Fu Bo, “Sect Master Fu, Zhou Ji was blinded by lust for Lady Feng you see by my side. Without any care for anything at all, he tried to abduct her and force her to warm his bed. What do you think of that, Sect Master Fu?”

“Abduct!? Warm his bed?!” Fu Bo was horrified and cold sweat began pouring down like buckets from his entire figure. The whole world around him seemed to be spinning and he felt certain that there was no hope left.

Even Fu Bo had to be on his best behaviour in front of Lady Feng, but Zhou Ji had the guts to try and abduct her? Not only that, he wanted her to serve him in his bed? He was simply courting death!

Only at this moment did he finally understand why someone like her would attack a First-Order Dao Source Ream cultivator.

But according to what he knew of Zhou Ji, that good-for-nothing really was capable of doing such a thing.

Yang Kai smiled as he looked at Zhou Yong, “Today, I have witnessed the grand posture of the Great Elder. It has been quite eye-opening to see how someone from a top Sect has a completely different tone from the rest! You are quite right… if your grandson was still alive, and had your personal tutelage, then he would certainly achieve greatness some day! After all, the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree!”

“Anything you say now is useless!” Zhong Yong stared coldly at Yang Kai, his eyes full of murderous intent, “Only by taking your lives can I quell the rage in my heart!”

He turned to look at Fu Bo, and quickly repeated, “Please accede to my wishes, Sect Master!”

Fu Bo’s face was as black as the abyss as he silently cursed the Great Elder for being so blind. He was just about to secretly convey to him just how powerful Luan Feng was, when Yang Kai suddenly spoke, “Sect Master Fu, since this Great Elder is willing to leave your noble Sect in order to kill us, why don’t you give him what he wants? If you keep trying to stop him, then it may upset all parties involved.”

Upon hearing this, Fu Bo perfectly understood what Yang Kai meant. He sighed deeply and closed his eyes, making it clear that he was not getting involved.

“Many thanks, Sect Master!” Zhou Yong spun around, ecstatic. Emperor Qi surged up within his body and he launched a heavy palm strike towards Yang Kai’s group.

It seemed from his manner that he wanted to kill them all in one blow.

“A mere firefly dares to challenge the light of the moon?” Luan Feng snorted coldly. She barely seemed to move before she suddenly appeared in front of Yang Kai and raised her hand, sending out a burst of pitch-black flames towards Zhou Yong.

The black flames gave off an aura capable of eliminating all of existence.

The power behind Zhou Yong’s palm strike completely collapsed as he shuddered, his stance falling apart as he panicked.

“What!?” Zhou Yong’s whole expression changed as his eyes were instantly filled with horror. He screamed as the deathly aura surged towards him, “Sect Master, save me!”

He finally realised that he had kicked an unbendable iron plate. This elegant and beautiful woman was so far above him in power that he was entirely outmatched.

Fu Bo’s tightly-shut eyes opened immediately, but before he could say anything, Yang Kai coldly spoke, “Sect Master Fu, you’d best not get involved, lest you be burnt!”

Fu Bo’s heart jumped as he swallowed back the words he had been about to say.

“Ahh!” A horrible scream was heard as the World Extinguishing Black Flames turned Zhou Yong into a black fireball and started to incinerate him.

Just like Wu Yuan Zheng before his death, the more Zhou Yong tried to channel his Emperor Qi to defend himself, the more furiously the flames on his body burned. It was as though all his Emperor Qi had turned into fuel.

“Sect Master…” Zhou Yong was still screaming piteously, begging for help in the most miserable of voices.

Even though Fu Bo pitied him, he didn’t dare to intercede. All he could do was gloomily look on.

After a whole ten breaths had passed, Zhou Yong was reduced to a pile of ash. With a careless wave of her hand, Luan Feng called back her World Extinguishing Black Flames that had still not diminished in strength.

The Great Elder of the Netherworld Sect was now dead.

Luan Feng still seemed to hold some lingering anger after giving vent to her feelings and she cast a glare at Yang Kai, “I do apologize, Young Master Yang. I once again forgot about his Space Ring.”

She had clearly not forgotten, but had done it on purpose. She knew that even if she killed Zhou Yong, it was impossible for his Space Ring to fall into her hands, so she decided to simply burn everything down instead.

After all, Yang Kai was greatly responsible for what happened today. Luan Feng was clearly still annoyed at Yang Kai for ducking aside earlier when that good-for-nothing grabbed at her, leading to her instinctually killing him.

If Yang Kai hadn’t dodged to the side, then perhaps they wouldn’t have so much trouble now.

Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat on his forehead and said awkwardly, “It’s no issue, no issue at all!”

Luan Feng’s anger was greatly reduced after seeing Yang Kai’s manner. On second thought, she really shouldn’t be giving attitude to the man who had the protection of that Heaven’s Order descendant. Now that Luan Feng saw that he wasn’t at all annoyed by her actions, she felt that he was actually not that bad after all.

Yang Kai turned to Fu Bo next, “Sect Master Fu, Lady Feng has killed your noble Sect’s Great Elder. I hope you have no problem with that?”

No problem with it? He had one hell of a problem! He was the only one left amongst the Sect’s three Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters! How could he have no problem with that? But even so, what could he do about it?

Fu Bo had seen Luan Feng’s attack with his own eyes and recognized the origin of those pitch-black flames. Coupled with Yang Kai addressing her as Lady Feng repeatedly, he had a pretty good idea of who she was.

Divine Spirit Luan Feng! One of the Four Great Divine Venerables of the Ancient Wild Lands. Her subordinates included eight Monster Kings, none of whom were weaker than him.

Though not a Great Emperor, she could be compared to one. Either way, he couldn’t afford to offend her. If he did enrage her, she could easily send a few Monster Kings over and exterminate the Netherworld Sect without breaking a sweat.

Fu Bo forced a smile despite the bitterness in his heart, “Zhou Yong had already left my Sect, so he doesn’t count as one of our members. Whether he lived or died after that has nothing to do with us!”

While he said all this, Fu Bo was filled with curiosity. How could Divine Spirit Luan Feng be willing to follow a human Junior? She even seemed like she was being ordered around by him.

Just what kind of background did this Yang Kai have?

Yang Kai gave Fu Bo a meaningful look and smiled, “Sect Master Fu is a flexible man of great understanding. In that case, let us resume the earlier discussion of compensation.”

“There’s no need,” Fu Bo smiled bitterly, “I will definitely ensure that Your Excellency is satisfied.”

He had wanted to bargain earlier when Yang Kai demanded the lion’s share of goods, but now, all he wanted was to quickly send these three calamity-bringers on their way. After a disciple of his own Sect had lusted after Luan Feng and even tried to abduct her, it was already a blessing that she hadn’t burnt everyone in his Sect to ashes. He did not dare to argue anymore.

Saying so, Fu Bo retrieved a communication artifact from his Space Ring and channelled his Divine Sense into it. He was evidently conversing with someone.

After he put the artifact away, Fu Bo forced a smile and said, “Please wait for a moment.”

“Good,” Yang Kai nodded, then suddenly turned serious, “Sect Master Fu, I’ve actually come to the Netherworld Sect for two matters. The first matter has been dealt with now, but I still need to talk to you about the second.”

Fu Bo’s heart jumped. He was extremely nervous, not knowing what other nasty surprises Yang Kai had for him, “May I know what else Your Excellency would like from me?” he asked carefully.

Yang Kai smiled, “Don’t be so tense, Sect Master Fu. This second matter is just a trivial favour. I’d like to borrow the Space Array of your noble Sect.”

“Borrow our Space Array?” Relief washed over Fu Bo, and he felt like he had just been brought out of Hell straight into Heaven, “No problem, no problem at all.”

He had just been on tenterhooks over what the second matter would be, but it turned out to be a simple request to borrow their Space Array.

“Where would Your Excellency like to go?” Fu Bo asked tentatively.

“To the Northern Territory!” said Yang Kai.

“The Northern Territory is quite far …” Fu Bo frowned a little, “Though our Sect’s Space Array is quite powerful, it still isn’t able to transport you to the Northern Territory directly. If you wish to go there, you’ll have to use a Cross-Territory Space Array. As far as I know, only Serene Soul Palace has such a Space Array in the Eastern Territory, a relic from the ancient past.”

“Serene Soul Palace has a Cross-Territory Space Array?” Yang Kai raised his brow, evidently surprised.

“I have only heard rumours of it, but not seen it myself.”

Yang Kai nodded.

Though Fu Bo had only heard about it, even if Serene Soul Palace really did have a Cross-Territory Space Array, it would be impossible for Yang Kai to borrow it. That place was overseen by the Serene Soul Great Emperor, and people could not simply go there and do as they pleased.

In addition, Yang Kai had clashed with the Serene Soul Great Emperor’s daughter Yao Lin. The Serene Soul Great Emperor had even been forced to appear to resolve the situation via a Soul Descend, but who knew what would happen if Yang Kai went right up to their front door.

“Since I can’t cross territories, then help me get to the place closest to the Northern Territory,” said Yang Kai.

“Of course. I will personally arrange this for Your Excellency in a moment,” Fu Bo quickly promised.

“Young Master Yang wishes to go to the Northern Territory?” Luan Feng finally asked, after listening to them for a while.

“En,” Yang Kai nodded and cast a glance at Ji Yao.

Ji Yao’s current condition was unstable, and while she was still well behaved because she thought he was Senior Bing Yun, who knew when her consciousness would become confused once more?

The reason he wanted to go to the Northern Territory was that he wished to send Ji Yao back to Ice Heart Valley. With Bing Yun personally looking after Ji Yao, perhaps she could finally recover.

As this was an urgent matter, Yang Kai had to deal with it first.
