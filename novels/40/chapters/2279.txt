“I happened to pass by during the incident and unexpectedly witnessed everything. At that time, I was only a Third-Order Origin King, so I could only watch the battle from afar,” Yang Kai said.

“What? You were only a Third-Order Origin King at the time?” Gao Shan and Liu Shui were taken aback by what they had just heard and they couldn’t help but shout in alarm, as if they had just realized something incredulous.

If what Yang Kai had said was true and he was only a Third-Order Origin King two years ago, then he would have broken through two Minor Realms, even crossing a Great Realm, to arrive at his current Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation in that short span of time. This rate of advancement was too terrifying!

If he continued advancing at the same pace, then wouldn’t he be a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivator next year, then an Emperor Realm Master the year after that?

It wasn’t so easy for a Dao Source Realm Cultivator to break through to the Emperor Realm. But, if Yang Kai was given twenty years, then he would be able to achieve it, would he not? Moreover, Gao Shan and Liu Shui had heard that Yang Kai consumed an Extraordinary Treasure Pill in the Four Seasons Realm, so he had a higher chance to reach the Emperor Realm than an average person.

They had spent most of their lives in cultivation, yet they still couldn’t even touch upon the Emperor Realm, while a young boy had a great chance to reach it. Upon thinking of this, they both felt quite upset and complex in their hearts.

“That is why...” Yang Kai spread his arms, “The death of Ning Yuan Cheng has nothing to do with me.”

Ning Yuan Shu furrowed his brow, not sure whether he should trust Yang Kai. He fell silent for a moment before asking, “What about my brother’s possessions? I heard that you once used our Flying Saint Palace’s flying ship artifact. Where is that artifact and where is the Fire Attribute Artifact Spirit that was bought by my brother at the auction?”

“Young Palace Master, I can’t understand what you’re saying,” Yang Kai looked at Ning Yuan Shu curiously.

“Stop playing dumb!” Ning Yuan Shu flew into a rage, “My brother has already died, and his possessions belong to our Flying Saint Palace, I have the right to retrieve them.”

Yang Kai scratched his face and said, “Do you have to insist? Your Flying Saint Palace is a great force, so one or two flying artifacts should be nothing in your eyes.”

“Since it’s nothing, then give it back to me,” Ning Yuan Shu shouted.

“Ha...” Yang Kai sighed and said, “Fine, I have to tell you that your ship artifact has already been... destroyed.”

“Destroy... Destroyed?” Ning Yuan Shu’s eyes widened up and he said in surprise, “That’s impossible, that was a Dao Source Grade Artifact, and it is able to withstand the attacks of all cultivators below the Emperor Realm. It couldn’t be destroyed so easily! Even my Flying Saint Palace only has a few ships at such a high grade.”

Yang Kai said solemnly, “It has been destroyed by an Emperor Realm Master.”

The Ship Artifact had really been destroyed, and it was destroyed with a single strike from Aunt Feng who had taken Mo Xiao Qi away. Aunt Feng was a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, so it had been easy for her to destroy the ship. As compensation, she did give Yang Kai a Wooden Boat Artifact though. The boat wasn’t as large as the ship, but it was simple, light and more convenient.

Upon hearing this, the corners of Ning Yuan Shu’s mouth twitched, “Who did you provoke?”

Gao Shao said in surprise, “You angered an Emperor Realm Master and are still alive?”

The members of Flying Saint Palace looked at Yang Kai in surprise. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“I didn’t really exchange blows with her,” Yang Kai’s face flushed, “I was hit suddenly by her, but fortunately that Senior didn’t seem interested in my life,” as he spoke, he added. “Besides, after Ning Yuan Cheng’s death, that ship became ownerless and naturally should belong to whoever picked it up. Since I found it, it’s mine, why grumble about it now?”

“Fine, I’ll grant you that!” Ning Yuan Shu shouted, “The ship has been destroyed, but what’s about the Fire Attribute Artifact Spirit? It’s said that the Artifact Spirit had already gained a high degree of sentience.”

Yang Kai sneered and said, “Didn’t you answer that question yourself? The Artifact Spirit already gained sentience, so it escaped the first chance it got.”

“Escaped?”

“Didn’t you just see a powerful Artifact Spirit that had gained sentience?” Yang Kai sneered, referring to the Artifact Spirit of the Demonic War Hammer.

Upon hearing this, Ning Yuan Shu’s expression turned aghast as he obviously recalled the violent encounter just now.

“Then doesn’t this mean... there is nothing left?” Gao Shan furrowed his brows.

“What else would be left? Didn’t I already explain everything to you?” Yang Kai chuckled, “As for the other Master who came from Flying Saint Palace, Fu Si Tong... That man was indeed quite strong, so even if I say that I killed him, you wouldn’t believe me.”

“That’s a matter of course, you wouldn’t be able to do so,” Ning Yuan Shu sneered and mocked. “City Lord Duan already said that Elder Fu died after he was corrupted by the Ancient Demon Qi.”

“That’s right,” Yang Kai clapped and said with a smile. “Then we have already resolved our misunderstanding, so don’t keep bothering me in the future or accusing me of murdering a member of the Flying Saint Palace. Young Palace Master, you seem like a reasonable fellow, so let us retain a good relationship between us so we can still be friends when we next meet.”

Upon hearing the word ‘friends’, Ning Yuan Shu couldn’t help but gaze around in fear that the Demonic War Hammer would suddenly appear.

“You don’t have the final say in this,” Gao Shan shook his head slowly.

“Then, it’s you who has the final say?” Yang Kai’s expression turned cold.

“No,” Liu Shan replied.

“Then who has the final say?” Yang Kai’s expression had already turned gloomy.

Gao Shan said, “If you’re not guilty, then why don’t you take a trip with us to Flying Saint Palace and explain everything to the Palace Master. It will be up to him to make the final judgment.”

“That’s right,” Liu Shan nodded and said, “You must come back with us to the Sect.”

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai laughed in response and looked meaningfully at Gao Shan, saying, “Protectors, it looks like you have misunderstood something.”

“What?”

“I provided you with an explanation not because I’m afraid of you, but rather because I don’t want to incur trouble for no reason. It’s up to you whether you want to believe me or not; however, if you keep bothering me for no reason, then... heh,” Yang Kai still wore a smile across his face, but his gaze had already turned cold.

Gao Shan and Liu Shan suddenly shivered for no reason and their pupils couldn’t help but contract, feeling like great danger was looming over them!

As they mulled this over, they suddenly recalled that Yang Kai had a good relationship with Elder Gao Xue Ting, and she had even told him to visit her room tonight in front of so many people. They didn’t dare to make a move against Yang Kai due to this. If they incurred Gao Xue Ting’s wrath, then they would all lose their lives.

Even if the Palace Master arrived personally, he still wouldn’t dare to make a move against Yang Kai unless he planned to kidnap him stealthily.

After Gao Shan and Liu Shi came to this conclusion, they realized that this affair was more thorny than they thought.

Gao Shan said, “Young Master Yang, if you don’t want to go with us to the Sect, that is fine, but you have to write a letter for us to take back to the Palace Master. If we don’t do at least that much, then the Palace Master may accuse us of neglecting our duties. We would have wasted time in Maplewood City without accomplishing anything.”

“That’s none of my business,” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

“Please, Young Master Yang, let’s have a proper discussion about this,” Gao Shan entreated shamelessly.

“Get... lost!” As Yang Kai spoke, he placed the Myriads Sword in front of him and said viciously, “I’ll repeat it for the last time. If you keep bothering me so stubbornly, then don’t blame me for taking your lives.”

As his voice fell, he pushed his Source Qi wildly while also sending out his Divine Sense to envelop Gao Shan and Liu Shui.

The expressions of Gao Shan and Liu Shan turned aghast as they suddenly felt the silhouette of this young man before them turn large and lofty. His aura wasn’t any different than a mountain weighing on their chests and they almost couldn’t breathe properly.

It was only at this moment that they suddenly realized that Yang Kai’s power was likely... No less than Luo Yuan’s.

This short moment felt like years, and by the time the two old men came back to their senses, Yang Kai had already disappeared. They both couldn’t help but exchange a glance and they could clearly see the shock in each other’s eyes.

“That man... we mustn’t provoke him again...” Gao Shan said in a deep voice with his fright still apparent on his face. His instincts told him clearly that if he provoked Yang Kai again, then he would likely lose his life.

“You’re right!” Liu Shan wiped off the cold sweat on his forehead and nodded.

“Then, did I get beaten by him for nothing?” Ning Yuan Shu pointed at his cheeks with an aggrieved look and said, “He insulted and shamed me, and he... killed Zhuang Pan. Does our Flying Saint Palace have to bear this in silence? If we do so, I won’t have the face to stay in the Southern Territory!”

Gao Shan cast a glance at him then sighed, “Zhuang Pan is a despicable coward whose death isn’t worth pitying. As for you, just take it as a mosquito’s bite.”

Upon hearing this, the corners of Ning Yuan Shu’s mouth twitched. The two old men had already expressed their standpoints, and he couldn’t take revenge by himself even if he wanted to, so he could only bear this in silence.

...

Inside the Qin Family Residence.

Yang Kai, Qin Zhao Yang, and their companions had already arrived back home.

Yang Kai had no place to go back to in Maplewood City. In the past, he still had a rented secluded home, but once his rent expired, he didn’t bother renewing it. Fortunately, the Qin Family didn’t treat him as a stranger and offered him accommodations.

The members of Eight Paths Sect had also returned, and they had all gone back to their courtyard under the lead of Luo Yuan and the round-faced woman.

But, Yang Kai noticed that Luo Yuan was now gazing at him with a dangerous glint in his eyes. He probably wanted to have a fight against him and he almost got a headache thinking about this.

“Little Brother Yang, I have asked the servants to prepare this courtyard specifically for you, it is one of my Qin Family’s best. You can rest here,” Qin Zhao Yang brought him into a courtyard and spoke.

“Patriarch Qin, thank you for your trouble,” Yang Kai said.

“You’re welcome, if you need anything, just call the servants and ask them,” Qin Zhao Yang laughed and said, “En, I won’t stay here and disturb your rest. I need to go back and check on Yu’er’s condition.”

“En.”

After Qin Zhao Yang left, Yang Kai walked into the courtyard with Zhang Ruo Xi and observed it. This courtyard wasn’t big, but it was peaceful, refined, and clean. It also had abundant World Energy which made Yang Kai satisfied.

After he observed the courtyard for a while, he asked Zhang Ruo Xi to take a room for herself before he turned his head to look at Ye Jing Han, who had followed him in silence like a shadow the whole time. He couldn’t help letting out a long sigh upon gazing at her.

Seeing this, Ye Jing Han bit her rosy lips and revealed a faint smile.

“Stop it, don’t smile like that! It’s uglier than if you just cried instead,” Yang Kai said with an annoyed look on his face.

Upon hearing this, Ye Jing Han’s body shivered as she turned deathly pale, her eyes becoming slightly red.
