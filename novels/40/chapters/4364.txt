It was then Yang Kai picked up the jade slip and infused his Divine Sense into it. With a frown, he gazed at Ti Zheng and asked, “How would I know if you’re telling the truth?”

“It’s up to you whether you want to believe me.” Ti Zheng grinned and rose from the chair, then cupped his fist to Zhu Jiu Yin, “I’m sorry for disturbing you, Senior Sister Zhu.”

Following that, he turned around and nonchalantly left.

After he was gone, Bai Qi asked anxiously, “Where’s Proprietress now?”

Yang Kai replied, “Have a look.” Then, he passed the jade slip to him.

After scanning the jade slip, Bai Qi furrowed his brow, “Shadowless Cave Heaven?”

The jade slip indeed contained the Proprietress’ whereabouts, but it was actually a Universe Cave Heaven called Shadowless Cave Heaven, which was just as powerful as Blood Monster Cave Heaven. Both of them were Universe Cave Heavens left behind by Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters after they passed away.

“Old Bai, do you think we can believe the information in this jade slip?” Yang Kai asked.

Bai Qi replied, “It’s likely to be true. The location marked in this jade slip was where Proprietress and the others disappeared back then. It explains why they went missing if they really fell into a Universe Cave Heaven. However… I’ve never heard of Shadowless Cave Heaven before.”

Yue He said, “It’s rumoured that many High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters lost their lives in the Shattered Heaven. After they died, they left behind many Universe Cave Heavens and Universe Paradises. So, it’s expected that you’ve never heard of it, but…”

“But what?” Yang Kai turned to look at her.

“Universe Cave Heavens and Universe Paradises are usually sealed off from the outside world. No one can find entrances unless they’re extremely lucky. Since those people could make Big Sister Lan fall into this Shadowless Cave Heaven, it probably means that they already have control over its entrance.”

As Yang Kai suddenly thought of something and narrowed his eyes as he asked, “Old Bai, you said that the reason Proprietress came to the Shattered Heaven was that she was looking for a High-Rank Yin Element treasure for me. How did you all get wind of it? Did you find out about it yourselves?”

Bai Qi replied, “It was Proprietress who somehow got word of it. Do you think someone deliberately leaked news of a High-Rank Yin Element treasure to lure Proprietress into the trap that sent her into the Shadowless Cave Heaven?”

Yang Kai snorted, “I don’t think it was a coincidence. It seems that they’ve really discovered a portal into the Shadowless Cave Heaven. At the very least, they know how to enter it.”

The heritages of the Cave Heavens and Paradises were all extremely rich, so it wasn’t odd that they could control the entrance to the Shadowless Cave Heaven, and it also wasn’t difficult for them to use it to trap the Proprietress and lure Yang Kai to the Shattered Heaven.

“In that case, are you still going?” Zhu Jiu Yin shot Yang Kai with a dispassionate glance, “The reason they generously told you the location must be that they’ve set up a trap. Even if this Queen goes with you, I can’t necessarily ensure your safety. You’ll probably lose your life there.”

Yang Kai pursed his lips and said, “I was ready for that before I came here. There’s no turning back now. Regardless of how dangerous the road ahead of us is, I have to move forward.”

Zhu Jiu Yin stared intently at him and said calmly, “Don’t worry. If you lose your life there, I’ll at least bury your corpse.”

An offended Yue He glared at her.

“Let’s go. I’m eager to find out what kind of an amazing trap they’ve set up for me.” Yang Kai rose from his seat without hesitation.

After shuffling out of the restaurant, they headed for the Star City’s exit. Yang Kai sported a solemn expression as he was worried about the Proprietress. Countless ideas flashed through his mind as he pondered on the circumstances that he might come across, but a moment later, he realised that someone was staring at him.

As their eyes met, Yang Kai became startled for a moment.

There was a middle-aged man across the street who had a look of disbelief on his face. It seemed that he hadn’t expected to bump into Yang Kai in this place. Following that, a sense of resentment rose within this man and his eyes seemed able to spurt endless wrath and hatred. His expression suggested that he was eager to skin Yang Kai alive and drink his blood.

However, as soon as he noticed the people around Yang Kai, he knitted his brow. Even though the auras of Zhu Jiu Yin and the others were concealed, it was apparent to this man that it would be difficult to deal with them. Given his power now, he was unable to kill Yang Kai to get his revenge.

As he darted his gaze around, he shot towards the Star City’s exit.

“Follow him!” Yang Kai yelled and chased after the man. Despite the fact that Zhu Jiu Yin and the others had no idea what was going on, they still promptly followed Yang Kai.

After leaving the Star City, they looked up and saw a ray of light shooting towards the depths of the void. Qu Hua Shang quickly summoned her flight type artifact, after which they boarded and raced after him.

A puzzled Zhu Jiu Yin asked, “Brat, who is that guy?”

“Give me a moment to think!” Yang Kai frowned without answering her question. Innumerable memories flashed across his mind, and just a moment later, he seemed to have figured out something, “I got it!”

An impatient Zhu Jiu Yin asked, “What do you mean?”

Yang Kai grinned, “We might be able to recruit some helpers.”

Bai Qi asked curiously, “Helpers?”

All of them looked at him in puzzlement as they didn’t understand why he was chasing after someone unrelated to the matter instead of heading straight to the Proprietress’ location.

After letting out a breath, Yang Kai gazed at Qu Hua Shang and asked, “Do you remember Abundance City, Senior Sister Qu?”

Qu Hua Shang replied with a smile, “Of course I do. We were even held captive together there. Aren’t those people living in Void Land now?”

She had frequently visited Void Land over the years, so she had seen Mo Mei and the others a number of times. When she and Yang Kai were held captive in Abundance City, they had met Mo Mei and the other inhabitants of the city and found out about their situations.

“The ancestors of Abundance City were implanted with a Blood Principle Restriction by Blood Monster Divine Monarch, so their descendants had to live in Blood Monster Cave Heaven for their entire lives. Without the nourishment from the Cave Heaven’s aura, they would immediately lose their lives. Back then, I joined forces with Black Crow Divine Monarch and obtained a Secret Technique that could resolve the Blood Principle Restriction. After the collapse of Blood Monster Cave Heaven, I managed to return to Abundance City in time and brought Mo Mei and the others out, eventually bringing them to settle in Void Land. However, when we were still captives, there was an Elder from Abundance City who tried to kill me. Do you remember that, Senior Sister Qu?”

After giving it a thought, Qu Hua Shang nodded, “En, he was named Tan Luo Xing, right? It’s no wonder I found that man familiar just now.”

When Tan Luo Xing saw the Wooden Token given to Yang Kai by the Proprietress in the past, he attempted to kill him outright. However, Tan Luo Xing failed miserably and soon after forcefully opened the city’s Defensive Grand Array and fled as he was worried that he would get punished. After that, Golden Gorilla King stormed into Abundance City and made a scene.

The person Yang Kai came across just now was Tan Luo Xing who had fled from Abundance City.

After finishing her words, Qu Hua Shang asked in perplexment, “There’s something I don’t understand, Junior Brother Yang. Tan Luo Xing fled pretty early on, so he supposedly shouldn’t have survived. After the Blood Monster Cave Heaven collapsed, all the cultivators in that place must have passed away except for the ones from Abundance City that you managed to save.”

Yang Kai said with a smile, “The only possibility is that his Blood Principle Restriction was also removed.”

“But who could have helped…” Before Qu Hua Shang finished her words, her gaze brightened as she figured everything out.

Yang Kai went on to say, “That’s right. There’s one more person who can resolve the Blood Principle Restriction other than me…”

Qu Hua Shang completed his sentence, “Black Crow Divine Monarch!”

Yang Kai chuckled, “He’s really something. He had killed many disciples from the Cave-Heavens and Paradises in Blood Monster Cave Heaven. After the collapse of Blood Monster Cave Heaven, all of the Cave Heavens and Paradises got wind of Black Crow Divine Monarch and began hunting him down. Initially, I thought that he must have lost his life in the Blood Monster Territory. Now, it seems that not only is he still alive and kicking, but he’s also come to the Shattered Heaven.”

After a moment of deliberation, Yang Kai nodded, “I’m sure he’s in the Shattered Heaven now. His life must be worse than mine since he’s being actively hunted down by the Cave Heavens and Paradises. There’s nowhere in the 3,000 Worlds that he can go except for the Shattered Heaven where there’s nothing but chaos…” He tutted, “Did you notice, Senior Sister Qu? Tan Luo Xing is also an Open Heaven Realm Master now.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qu Hua Shang nodded, “En, Fifth-Order.”

Yang Kai went on to say, “There was no way Black Crow Divine Monarch would help Tan Luo Xing resolve his Blood Principle Restriction out of kindness. He was aware that he was on his own, so he had to recruit some subordinates. As a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, Tan Luo Xing is powerful enough to be used as a pawn. Moreover, in the Blood Monster Cave Heaven, Abundance City alone was able to produce so many Open Heaven Realm Masters. What about other cities? If my speculation is right, Black Crow Divine Monarch must have amassed a lot of helpers who are in the Fifth-Order and Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm.”

...

After all, Black Crow Divine Monarch was a former High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master, reborn after seizing someone else’s body. Since Black Crowd Divine Monarch possessed the necessary Secret Technique to resolve the Blood Principle Restriction, it would be easy for him to enslave some people when the Blood Monster Cave Heaven began to collapse.

Since Yang Kai was able to save the people from Abundance City at that time, Black Crow Divine Monarch could naturally do something similar. The fact that Tan Luo Xing was still alive was the best proof.

[Moreover…]

Yue He said, “Tan Luo Xing seems to be luring us somewhere, Young Master.”

Yang Kai said, “He’s completely resentful of me. After his failed attempt to kill me back then, he was forced to flee Abundance City and became homeless. When he saw me in the Star City just now, he wouldn’t dare to make a move as all of you were around me. However, if he can lure us to the place where his companions gather together, he can join forces with them and get his revenge.”

Qu Hua Shang remarked, “That must be the place where Black Crow Divine Monarch resides.”

Yang Kai nodded, “You’re right. He’s trying to make use of Black Crow Divine Monarch’s power to deal with us.”

Even though there were only a small number of people with Yang Kai, they were obviously all powerful Masters. Since Tan Luo Xing had the guts to lure them to that place, it meant that Black Crow Divine Monarch must have amassed a lot of subordinates, and he believed that the Divine Monarch was able to deal with Yang Kai and the others; otherwise, he wouldn’t have made such a decision.

Zhu Jiu Yin warned him by saying, “Are you trying to make use of that Black Crow Divine Monarch’s power? Be careful, as you might go for wool and come back shorn.”

Qu Hua Shang said, “You should really think twice about it, Junior Brother. I remember that you made Black Crow Divine Monarch suffer a huge loss in the Blood Monster Cave Heaven, so he also abhors you.”
