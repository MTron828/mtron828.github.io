Yang Kai’s entire body turned stiff, not daring to move a muscle. A drop of cold sweat rolled down his forehead as he replied with a serious expression, “This Disciple was just about to say that he… accepts this request.”

“En, a promising young man!” A smile curled up from the corner of Gao Xue Ting’s mouth as she sheathed her sword.

Only after all of these antics had finished did Vice Temple Master Qiu Ran and the various other Elders present step forward with grins on their faces, cupping their fists as they proceeded to greet the future Elder Yang.

With a beaming smile, Wen Zi Shan said, “Good, good. Our temple has a new Elder! That’s something worthy to be celebrated! This Temple Master has made the decision to organize a Grand Canonization Ceremony to commence in five days. We will quickly make an announcement to the world.”

A tremor shook through Yang Kai’s body as he hastily interjected, “There’s really no need for this, Temple Master. As of now, this Disciple…”

Before he could finish his sentence, a grinning Wen Zi Shan had already patted his shoulders, “There’s no need to say anymore. I know.”

Yang Kai opened his mouth, though all of the words he was about to say turned into a sigh. He had killed Tan Jun Hao and Wu Ming, and although there was a justifiable reason behind his actions, he had gone against a mighty power which was Star Soul Palace. Once he became an Elder of Azure Sun Temple, it would surely bring them trouble.

It was alright for him to hide and evade this matter, but why would Wen Zi Shan want to organize a Grand Canonization Ceremony about his appointment to the position of Elder? Wasn’t this a clear indication of wanting to redirect fire towards the temple? Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Yang Kai felt touched, and uneasy at the same time. If he really brought a disaster to the temple, he would feel horrible. Nevertheless, despite clearly knowing the repercussions of his actions, Wen Zi Shan obviously wanted to use the might of the temple to protect Yang Kai.

Gao Xue Ting chimed in from the side, “Once any of the temple’s Disciples is promoted to the Emperor Realm, they will become an Elder of the sect, and thereby obtain the authority of an Elder. That was the case with Xia Sheng, so there’s no need to feel any burden over it.”

Yang Kai scratched his head and replied, “There’s a matter that I’ve to inform all of you. Recently, this Disciple founded a Sect of his own…”

“Huh?” Wen Zi Shan exchanged glances with Gao Xue Ting, both of them noticing the look of surprise within each other’s eyes. The various Elders present also gawked in response.

“As of now, this Disciple can technically be considered a Sect Master; therefore, I’m afraid that there will be some conflict with me becoming an Elder of the temple.”

Wen Zi Shan nodded his head in agreement, though Gao Xue Ting had a look of suspicion on her face as she asked, “You’re not lying to us, right? Just to avoid taking up this Elder position?”

Yang Kai hastily replied, “How would I dare to do so? This is really the truth.”

Gao Xue Ting frowned, “Although you’re an Emperor now, and possess the qualifications to establish a Sect, you’re still quite young. Diving into such matters will not be beneficial to your future. As of now, your main priority should be to increase your cultivation.”

“Many thanks, Elder Gao, for your concern. This Disciple also understands my priorities; however, there is a reason behind the need for this Disciple to establish an independent Sect,” Yang Kai replied while nodding his head.

Gao Xue Ting sighed, “Since you’ve already founded your Sect, you can’t dissolve it. How about this? Let your sect ally with the temple. If there’s anything you need help with, the temple will be able to extend a helping hand. In fact, the temple can send some people over to help you and relieve your burden in some of the routine affairs.”

Yang Kai smiled faintly, “There are already people assigned to take care of Sect matters, so there’s no need for me to worry about them.”

“That’s good. You’re a smart person, so you should know that one’s own strength is the foundation of everything,” Gao Xue Ting turned silent for an instant, before continuing, “However, since you’re now a Sect Master, it is indeed not as suitable for you to become an Elder of the temple. How about this? We shall confer you the title of High-Rank Guest Elder. What do you think of that, Temple Master?”

Wen Zhi Shan smiled, “Whatever you say, Little Xue Ting.”

Although a High-Rank Guest Elder was also an Elder position, there was much more freedom in that role, including freedom of movement. It was somewhat similar to Yang Kai’s previous position as an in-name disciple, just higher in rank.

“That’s right. What’s the name of your Sect, and where is it located?” Gao Xue Ting asked.

Qiu Ran, Cheng Qian and the others looked over towards Yang Kai with curious looks on their faces.

“High Heaven Palace, and it is situated in the Northern Territory,” Yang Kai replied with a grin.

“The Northern Territory, so far away…” Gao Xue Ting frowned. Azure Sun Temple was located in the Southern Territory, meaning that there was a distance of over a billion kilometres between them and High Heaven Palace. This meant that even an alliance would not be of much use as Azure Sun Temple was too far to provide any aid should anything serious happen to High Heaven Palace.

“How’s the strength of your Sect, and how many disciples do you have?”

An embarrassed look appeared on Yang Kai’s face as he looked at Gao Xue Ting, before speaking out in a meek tone, “Does Elder Gao want to hear the truth… or…?”

“I’d like to see if you dare say anything false!” Gao Xue Ting’s beautiful eyes shot a glare back at him.

The corners of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched, before replying, “We don’t have many disciples as of now, only about a hundred so far.”

“A hundred people…” Gao Xue Ting nodded lightly. It was not an indication of her looking down on Yang Kai’s Sect, as after all, having just broken through to the Emperor Realm, the Sect Yang Kai established would definitely be a small one at best. Being able to gather over a hundred disciples was already extremely good. A Sect was somewhat similar to a rolling snowball, where it would take a lot of time to become big and strong.

“As for strength… the cultivations of the disciples are quite varied. For Emperors… there are six excluding me.”

“What?” The various Elders present gasped in shock.

“There are six others? Doesn’t that mean that there are seven Emperors in total?”

“Are you sure that there’s only over a hundred people in your Sect?”

Some of the Elders were immediately unable to remain calm, with even Wen Zi Shan’s eyes snapping wide in response.

A Sect with only a few more than a hundred people actually had seven Emperor Realm Masters among its ranks? What kind of Sect was this? Wasn’t that a bit too terrifying? Even with its ten thousand or so disciples, Azure Sun Temple only had about a dozen Emperors among its ranks.

Gao Xue Ting was filled with shock, as she had originally assumed that Yang Kai’s newly established Sect would be small and weak at best. However, from the looks of it, his Sect already appeared to be somewhat extraordinary.

“Of those six… what are their cultivation realms?”

Yang Kai scratched his head and replied, “There’s a First-Order Emperor Realm Head Manager that helps me handle the Sect’s affairs. There’s also a First-Order Emperor Array Master, a Second-Order Emperor Realm Emperor Alchemist…”

Sii…

A wave of successive hisses rang out, as everyone present on Myriad Saints Peak shot a look at Yang Kai as though they had just seen a ghost.

A small Sect with only around a hundred disciples being overseen by seven Emperors was more than enough to shock the hearts of people; however, after hearing Yang Kai say that there was actually an Emperor Array Master and an Emperor Alchemist among them…

How was that possible? Even Azure Sun Temple did not have their own Emperor Array Master and Emperor Alchemist! Only those Great Emperor Sects were capable of matching the lineup of a Sect like that.

“What about the other three?” Gao Xue Ting continued probing, though shock had already filled her eyes.

Yang Kai lowered his head and replied in a somewhat apologetic tone, “The other three… are Monster Kings.”

Dumbstruck looks immediately appeared on everyone’s faces.

Monster Kings… furthermore, three of them!

Only members of the Monster Race with strength capable of rivalling that of Third-Order Emperors possessed the qualifications to be hailed as Monster Kings. In other words, the might of any Monster King was not one bit inferior to that of Azure Sun Temple’s Temple Master, Wen Zi Shan.

It was precisely due to Wen Zi Shan’s presence that Azure Sun Temple was capable of being ranked as a top Sect in the Southern Territory, rivalling Orthodoxy Temple and Heavenly Martial Holy Land, as both of them were led by Third-Order Emperors as well.

Yet, there were three such existences in High Heaven Palace which was established by Yang Kai not long ago.

Other than the lack of a Great Emperor to assume command and a slightly inferior number of Emperors, how was this Sect inferior to any of the Great Emperor Sects? If such a Sect was to develop and grow stronger, its power and influence might eclipse all of the other great forces within the Star Boundary, with the exception of those Great Emperor Sects.

Finally recovering from her shock, Gao Xue Ting suddenly spoke out in a solemn tone, “You have to be vigilant when dealing with races other than our own. Yang Kai, how are you able to control those three Monster Kings? How are they willing to listen to your commands?”

Wen Zi Shan chimed in with a serious look on his face, “That’s right, you have to be careful about this.”

Yang Kai nodded his head and replied, “Disciple naturally understands this.”

“You’re not a reckless person, so as you have already made this decision, there is no need for us to discuss it further.” Wen Zi Shan gave a gentle nod, before giving a sudden grin, “However, from the looks of it, your High Heaven Palace does actually possess the qualifications to form an alliance with our temple. The only issue would be the long distance separating us. Such a pity, such a pity. That’s right, since your High Heavens Palace has such a strong background, you must have chosen a good place to establish your foundation. The speed of development of a Sect is tied tightly with its location, so make sure to not make an impulsive decision when doing so.”

“Disciple actually occupied other people’s territory when founding his Sect, so there isn’t much to worry about this matter,” Yang Kai replied with a meaningful smile.

“Oh?” Wen Zi Shan raised his brow in response and asked, “Which Sect did you steal from? Although this Sect Master doesn’t know much about the Sects in the Northern Territory, I’ve heard of a few.”

“Seeking Passion Sect!”

Wen Zi Shan’s expression instantly turned into one that was a sight to behold as he gawked blankly at Yang Kai. This was accompanied by the slack jaws present on many of the Elders’ faces.

All of them naturally knew about Seeking Passion Sect, as it was one of the top Sects of the Northern Territory. In terms of status, it was on the same level as their Azure Sun Temple within the Southern Territory.

Yang Kai had actually snatched away the domain of Seeking Passion Sect and established his own Sect there! In other words, Seeking Passion Sect had definitely been wiped out.

Nevertheless, looking from another perspective, with the strength of force behind Yang Kai, it was not impossible for High Heaven Palace to wipe out the Seeking Passion Sect.

“Not bad, not bad, the Seeking Passion Sect’s domain definitely won’t be lacking…” Cold sweat formed on Wen Zi Shan’s forehead as he discovered that he had greatly underestimated Yang Kai. In the past, he had only assumed that the latter was brimming with potential and therefore used various methods to get Yang Kai to join Azure Sun Temple, leading to the latter’s status as an in-name disciple.

However, after just a few years of separation, this in-name disciple had actually managed to accomplish such a world-shaking matter. If not for the exceedingly far distance between the two territories, news of this matter might have already propagated across the Southern Territory, shocking the entire Star Boundary.

“Okay, enough casual talk. The Grand Canonization Ceremony will be held in five days, so there are still many things to do.” Gao Xue Ting changed the topic.

She did not dare to continue asking, as she was afraid she might hear even more shocking news if she did so.

Right at this moment, a frown suddenly appeared on Gao Xue Ting’s forehead. Retrieving her communication artifact out, she sent her Divine Sense into it, before raising her head to say, “Temple Master, Xiao Yu Yang is here.”

Wen Zi Shan’s eyes narrowed, “He’s quite quick!”

Yang Kai coughed and spoke up at this moment, “I actually bumped into him along the way here, though I shook him off. He might be here from chasing after me.”

Wen Zi Shan nodded his head and said, “I understand. Little Xue Ting, bring him away for a while.”

“En,” Gao Xue Ting nodded, before ordering Yang Kai. “Follow me.”

Yang Kai cupped his hands towards the other Elders present before flying away with Gao Xue Ting.

Although he was not afraid of Xiao Yu Yang, it definitely wouldn’t do any good if he were to meet with the latter. Therefore, Yang Kai decided to simply disappear for a while. Nevertheless, Yang Kai felt somewhat apologetic dragging Azure Sun Temple into this mess.

After a short while, Gao Xue Ting brought Yang Kai to her Purple Bamboo Peak. A vast forest of purple bamboo stretched across this peak, shaking lightly in the wind.

Present on the large and majestic Purple Bamboo Peak was a lone structure, appearing exceedingly desolate within this environment. This seemed to coincide with Gao Xue Ting’s stoic character.
