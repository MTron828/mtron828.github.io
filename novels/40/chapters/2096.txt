“How is this possible?” Everyone’s eyes snapped wide open, their jaws dropping down, not closing even after a very long time.

Something like regrowing limbs was the stuff of legends. Only a few precious spirit medicines that were virtually extinct in this world were capable of allowing one to achieve such a heaven-defying effect. It was even impossible for cultivators of the Emperor Realm to rely on their own strength to achieve a feat like regrowing their limbs.

However, such a spectacle had just happened right before everyone’s eyes.

And the person who managed to do so was just a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator.

Who wouldn’t be astonished?

The demonic creatures they had encountered previously were not very powerful, with all of them possessing cultivations below the Dao Source Realm. They were utterly no match for anyone in the group, exploding apart after a single attack. Therefore, no one had discovered this terrifying effect the endless Demon Qi had on demonic creatures.

However, with the aid of the Demon Qi, this demonised City Lord Cheng was actually able to regrow his severed limb in such an extremely short period of time. Everyone was shocked, all while quietly feeling that the situation had become somewhat thorny.

“Looks like we have to strike their vital points, or smash them into bits.” Duan Yuan Shan quickly said.

“This king wants to see how many times you can evade!” The failure of the middle-aged man’s attack caused him to become angry out of shame. With a twist of his wrist, the short spear appeared once again in his hand before he started to send in Source Qi as though his life depended on it.

The short spear shook slightly before two spears appeared, then four, then eight...

Each of the short spears appeared identical to each other, as though all of them were Mid-rank Dao Source Grade artifacts. It was unknown whether this was his own Divine Ability or the special ability of that artifact.

“Go!” With a roar, the eight short spears trembled slightly, before they suddenly disappeared before everyone’s eyes.

In the next instant, the figures of the two Forest City City Lords swayed violently. Right at the same moment, another figure came lunging over from the side. With his hands clasped together to form a seal, Demon Qi erupted forth, causing a mysterious energy to condense in the sky, before descending and enveloping the area in front of it.

*Whoosh whoosh whoosh...*

Sounds of objects breaking through the air broke the silence, while large patches of blood mist erupted around the bodies of the two City Lords, creating an exceedingly miserable sight.

When the eight short spears that disappeared earlier re-appeared in the middle-aged man’s hand, an even more gloomy expression replaced the already gloomy expression he had on his face.

Severe injuries were present on the two Forest City City Lords. One of them had been struck in the chest, leaving a gaping fist-size hole that was so deep that one could almost see right through him, and could even faintly make out the organs squirming within his body.

The other person had lost both of his feet, causing him to fall down to the ground, though he continued to struggle in an attempt to stand up.

Nevertheless, despite the terrifying injuries sustained, the attacks did not lead to any of their deaths. As Demon Qi started to churn, the spectacle identical to the limb regrowth scene appeared once again.

Not long after, two completely uninjured Forest City City Lords appeared before everyone.

At this moment, other than the two, there was an existence that appeared to be an old man beside them.

“Jiang Tai Sheng!” Duan Yuan Shan snorted coldly, showing his bitter hate towards the perpetrator of Maplewood City’s crisis.

Clearly, this demon was the Jiang Family’s old ancestor, Jiang Tai Sheng. Not only did he appear somewhat different from how he looked since Yang Kai had last seen him, he had now turned into a demon-like existence, with the aura he radiated being much stronger than before.

It was precisely due to him taking action to help the two Forest City City Lords to block quite a few of the attacks that allowed the two to survive. If not, with the capabilities of the middle-aged man, he would have been able to kill one of them at the very least.

“You few pieces of trash, you’ve succeeded in angering me! I’ll make sure you all pay the price for that!” Anger seemed to have overwhelmed the middle-aged man as he roared out. In the next instant, he suddenly mustered all of the Source Qi in his body, and with the twist of his palm, a Secret Technique in the shape of a fireball formed above his hand. As he poured more and more Source Qi in, the temperature of the fireball skyrocketed, alongside its brilliance.

“No!” Duan Yuan Shan immediately lost his voice upon seeing this.

Maintaining the Spirit Array as well as fighting had already greatly exhausted everyone’s energies. The earlier attack launched by the middle-aged man had more or less drained him dry. At this moment, how could Duan Yuan Shan allow the latter to unleash a Secret Technique with even greater energy consumption?

If he was by himself, there was no issue with him displaying that Secret Technique at all. However, at this moment, all seven people’s Source Qi were fused as one. Therefore, the energy used in that Secret Technique was provided by all seven people. This was far less safe and energy-efficient than relying on the Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array.

“He’s gone mad. He can’t listen to reason,” Hua Qing Si’s expression changed slightly, before she gave a shout. “If you all don’t want the Spirit Array to collapse, hurry up and use your Blood Burning Source Restoring Pill!”

After saying those words, she immediately retrieved the Spirit Pill Yang Kai had given to her and shoved it straight down her throat.

Seeing this, everyone else did not hesitate anymore and proceeded to consume their Spirit Pills.

This was the first time that Yang Kai had consumed this type of Spirit Pill. As it entered his stomach, he felt a fiery sensation blossoming from there. At the same time, a portion of his precious Blood Essence suddenly burst into flames, catalyzed by the medicine into pure Source Qi that gushed into his empty meridians.

He could not help feeling surprised by this, as he realized that this Spirit Pill was indeed a very good thing.

There were quite a few Source Qi replenishing Spirit Pills present in the Star Boundary. However, none of them could compete with the Blood Burning Source Restoring Pill in terms of efficacy and speed.

The only side effect was the consumption of a portion of the user’s Blood Essence. This wasn’t really a serious problem, but neither was it a minor issue; generally speaking, the consumption of one’s Blood Essence would result in them becoming weaker.

At this instant, the seemingly berserk middle-aged man made a malevolent sneer, while the fireball in his hand had grown to be as dazzling as a miniature sun, with its scorching temperature causing extreme discomfort for everyone present.

Nevertheless, all of the Demon Qi that came close to it were burnt cleanly into nothingness, which was an unexpected surprise.

“Die, you trash!” Raising his hand, the middle-aged man tossed the miniature sun-like fireball forward.

Sensing the terrifying might contained within that fireball, the faces of Duan Yuan Shan and the others turned pale. Without any hesitation, he raised his hand to form a seal and shouted out fiercely, “Defend!”

Being led along, everyone else hastily cooperated with him.

The size of the Black Tortoise projection shrunk by quite a bit, while a tortoise shell-like projection with complicated patterns and motley drawings appeared in the air. In an instant, the Black Tortoise Projection appeared to turn corporeal, causing everyone within it to feel a sense of security enveloping them.

Before them, Jiang Tai Sheng and the other demons let off roars while radiating feelings of unease, as though they were aware that they were in big trouble. In the next instant, all of them opened their mouths wide and devoured all of the Demon Qi in their surroundings.

In a blink of an eye, the Demon Qi around them grew much denser than before.

As the small sun descended, it landed right into the middle of the 3 demons.

Dazzling brilliance blossomed, causing everyone to shut their eyes, leaving them unable to see the situation before them.

*Hong.*

An earth-shattering explosion rumbled out.

The heavens and earth became devoid of light, as sand and rocks flew in the air, berserk winds howled and the earth rumbled and cried.

The originally collapsed mine shaft was now destroyed into nothingness.

“Hahahaha! Let’s see if you all are dead or not!” As he roared with laughter, the middle-aged man retrieved a Blood Burning Source Restoring Pill, shoved it into his mouth and chewed on it, his expression so malevolent that one would assume that he had fully lost it.

As the light gradually disappeared, a giant hole spanning several dozen meters wide was present in the ground before them, surrounded by flames that were still burning strong.

They were able to faintly make out three figures within the giant hole.

The middle-aged man’s mad laughter came to an abrupt halt as he looked incredulously before him, a look of disbelief blanketing his face.

With the giant hole, all of the Demon Qi had already been purged clean, allowing everyone to have a clear view of what was inside.

Despite being in an incomparably miserable state, with no uninjured parts on their bodies, the 3 demons that should have been obliterated into nothingness did not perish.

On the contrary, they still continued to suck in the Demon Qi in their surroundings in a bid to repair their bodies.

Nevertheless, flames burnt on their bodies, causing the Demon Qi gushing towards them to be burnt by the scorching heat into black smoke.

“They’re unable to regrow their limbs! What are you all waiting for?” Seeing this sight, Duan Yuan Shan exclaimed in a pleasantly surprised voice. Taking the lead, he summoned his personal artifact, and disregarding the consumption of Source Qi, started to unleash a fierce attack on the demons.

Seeing this, the other people didn’t hesitate anymore as they unleashed Secret Techniques or summoned the might of their artifacts.

Within the giant pit, Jiang Tai Sheng and the other two demons let off loud roars and lunged out. Continuing to let the flames on their bodies burn on, they evaded the incoming Secret Techniques and artifact attacks as they rapidly closed in on the group, their jet-black eyes filled with gleams of madness.

“Are they trying to perish together with us? Hurry up and obstruct them!” Hua Qing Si’s pretty face changed, and with a twirl of her tender body, she shouted out, “Butterfly Dance!”

In an instant, she appeared to have metamorphosed into a dancing butterfly, fairy-like and absolutely beautiful to behold.

Gorgeous five-coloured butterflies suddenly started to shoot out from her body, flapping their wings as they flew forwards. Numbering over a hundred, they hid the skies and covered the earth as they did so.

After closing in on the demons, powerful energy fluctuations erupted from those dazzling butterflies, before they proceeded to self-destruct. Each explosion rivalled that of the self-destruction created by a Third-Order Origin King cultivator!

The successive explosions of over a hundred butterflies was a magnificent sight to behold.

The three demons, who already suffered quite significant injuries, ended up in an even more disastrous condition.

“Chop!” Qin Zhao Yang wielded a long blade in his hand, which transformed into an astonishing gigantic arc that chopped down from the skies.

The demonized City Lord Cheng, who had arrived within ten metres of the group, was cleaved into two halves. Falling down onto the ground, he finally perished.

Also knowing that this was the critical moment that decided their life or death, Zhuang Pan and Du Li Shen did not dare to hold back any bit of their strength, unleashing their strongest trump cards to obstruct Jiang Tai Sheng and the demonized City Lord Zhou.

A longsword appeared in Yang Kai’s hand, Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi surging endlessly into it. Forming a loop, it shot towards the demonized City Lord Zhou, striking the latter so many times that he appeared just like a bee’s nest after that. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Dragon Emperor Flash!” Clasping his hands together, Duan Yuan Shan made a furious push forward.

With a loud dragon’s roar, a dragon projection lunged forwards, smashing right into the demonized City Lord Zhou’s chest. It was the straw that broke the camel’s back, and City Lord Zhou’s already broken body exploded into quite a few bits before dropping down onto the ground.

“Where’s Jiang Tai Sheng?” All of a sudden, Qin Zhao Yang’s expression changed as he roared.

Among the confusion, he had suddenly discovered that Jiang Tai Sheng had gone missing.

Great waves of shock surged through everyone’s hearts as they hastily scanned their surroundings!

“Over there!” Yang Kai roared. Using his accomplishments in Space Force, he managed to capture Jiang Tai Sheng’s movements. The long sword in his hand trembled, shooting out and transforming into a beam of light.

Pu...

Jiang Tai Sheng’s figure was revealed in a weird manner, with a long sword pierced right through the location of his heart.

Nevertheless, the group could not feel any happiness from this, as Jiang Tai Sheng had already closed in on them. Although he had suffered a lethal injury, a cold smile surfaced at the corner of his mouth, as unstable energy fluctuations radiated out from his body.
