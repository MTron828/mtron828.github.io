It can even be said that the reason why the Abyssal Returner hid behind the mountain after it was injured was so it could wait for his arrival.

The reason why the Abyssal Returner became so vicious before was because of the Secret Technique that Gong Yue performed. Yang Kai remembered that the Abyssal Returner even tried to bite Gong Yue when he was tracking him through the half of the Demon Spirit to Spirit Sword Peak.

The secret demon sealing grounds under Spirit Sword Peak and the bloodline of the Abyssal Returner should be related.

Yang Kai carried the Ancient Demon Black Eye, and he had the aura of an Ancient Demon sealed in his body. The Abyssal Returner might have been able to sense it, and that was why it wanted to try and approach him.

All kinds of thoughts flashed across Yang Kai’s mind, and soon he arrived in front of the Space Array. Space Principles surged and Yang Kai was back in the Northern Territory’s High Heaven Palace.

A few moments later, there was a flash of light above the array, and two figures were revealed.

“So this is the Azure Sun Temple, Palace Master?” Nanmen Da Jun observed his surroundings curiously before clicking his tongue, “It’s nothing special. Not as grand as our High Heaven Palace. En, even the World Energy seems to be inferior.”

“Focus more on the working and less on the talking. Haven’t you heard about this principle?” Yang Kai took the lead and flew ahead.

Nanmen Da Jun laughed, “Yes, yes, yes. By the way, Xiao Hou asked me to ask you how the flight type artifact is doing, and whether or not any places need to be adjusted.”

“No need, it’s working fine.”

“Also, Palace Master. That girl, something Yao from Ice Heart Valley, she came a few times but she always left when she saw that you weren’t in. Is she our Palace Master’s wife?”

“Do you like having a tongue?”

“Fine fine fine, I won’t ask.” Nanmen Da Jun covered his mouth, but after holding it in for only a moment, he started up again, “That girl’s not bad…”

“We’ve arrived!” Yang Kai flew down as he said that.

The group of people on the ground had obviously noticed him as well, and when they looked over, they were all curious as to why Yang Kai had brought a stranger over.

Nanmen Da Jun, however, was like a cat that had caught the smell of fish. He looked towards the entrance of the demon sealing grounds with an inspired look on his face, eyes glowing as he paced back and forth at the entrance, looking more and more excited.

After a while, he turned around and said, “Palace Master, I will head down now. Just wait for my good news.”

Ignoring everyone, he jumped straight down and soon disappeared.

The group of people looked curiously at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai said, “This man is the Northern Territory’s Emperor Array Master, Nanmen Da Jun. He happened to be nearby, so I invited him to come and help us.”

Wen Zi Shan looked at him with a grin, seemingly having noticed something, but he did not expose him.

As time passed, they constantly received new messages from below. As expected of an Emperor Array Master, Nanmen Da Jun was able to crack apart many of the Spirit Arrays remaining in the demon sealing grounds. He used his own abilities to gain dominance, garnering the respect of the temple’s Array Masters.

Breaking the seals took a whole two days, and during that period, representatives of the big Sects in the Southern Territory were constantly arriving at Azure Sun Temple to ask for information. The temple allowed these people to pass, and several Elders took turns receiving them, informing them about the demon sealing grounds, as well as the Demon Spirits escaping.

Many paled in worry as they listened.

Now that the Demon Spirits were out and about, tracking them was going to be a big problem. It was the first time since ancient times that the Southern Territory was encountering such a crisis, so they were completely inexperienced. They could only count on whatever clues may be left inside the demon sealing cave. Otherwise, it would be like searching for a needle in a city worth of haystacks.

But there were no clues to be found in the cave.

Nanmen Da Jun and the temple’s Array Masters cracked all the seals inside the cave, but they couldn’t find any information about the Demon Spirits. On the other hand, they did get some useful information from the Spirit Arrays.

If a time came when they needed to seal the Demon Spirits again, that information may become of use to them.

Everyone was filled with worry for a while.

Soon, envoys from Star Soul Palace arrived. Great Elder Lei Hong led the group personally, bringing with him a decree from the Great Emperor, ordering all the Sects, families, and great forces of the Southern Territory to check their disciples in case any of them have been corrupted by the Demon Spirits.

It was at Spirit Sword Peak that Lei Hong declared the Great Emperor’s order, to which everyone agreed, naturally.

It must be said that the Great Emperor’s Demon Banishment Order had given the whole Southern Territory courage. Many Masters were not as nervous as before; after all, no matter what happened, the Southern Territory still had Star Soul Palace and the Bright Moon Great Emperor behind it. No matter how mysterious or vicious the Demon Spirits could be, they wouldn’t be able to make any waves with the Great Emperor keeping watch.

After the Demon Banishment Order was issued, many Emperor Realm Masters were ready to leave the Azure Sun Temple in order to return to their own Sects to begin work on this matter.

But right at that moment, a red light suddenly sped in from the outside. It gave off an aggressive aura, as if it placed no one else around it in its eyes, and crossed hundreds of kilometres in the blink of an eye, rushing full speed towards Spirit Sword Peak.

After just learning of the escaped Demon Spirits, the emotions of many Masters were still sensitive, so faced with such a brazen visitor who came crashing right into Azure Sun Temple without notice, many thought the worst.

Alarmed, many people instinctively launched attacks to intercept this invader.

A few days ago, the scene of many Elders joining hands with Chen Wen Hao and Feng Ming in the fight against Gong Yue had been explosive enough, but compared to this scene now, it simply paled in comparison.

There were over a hundred Emperor Realm Masters gathered here, so even if only a third of them acted, the scene was still going to be spectacular.

What’s more, the ones acting now were far more than just a third.

Emperor Pressure spread out, and the lights of Secret Technique after Secret Technique bloomed, whilst the power of Emperor Artifacts began to surge before they all gathered towards the red light.

The red light rushing over was clearly a little confused by all this, never having expected to encounter such a situation. It paused in mid-air, but the space it was in was already enveloped in an endless number of attacks.

A dragon roar suddenly rang out through the air, the high-pitched noise shaking everyone’s eardrums. The faces of everyone changed dramatically because this was the call of an extremely pure-blooded Dragon, and not the calls of those flood dragon-like Monster Beasts.

The moment the dragon roar sounded, Yang Kai’s bloodline was suddenly stirred. Seemingly instinctually sensing something, he had not joined those who attacked earlier. Instead, he looked over wide-eyed at this moment.

The red light dispersed, and a huge creature was suddenly revealed in the air. Its more than two-hundred-metre-long body was as lofty as a mountain and it had a pair of Dragon Horns on its head along with four claws extending from its belly. It was covered in red Dragon Scales that were just like burning flames, and with every movement of its Dragon Tail, the wind and clouds would change with it.

“Ssii…”

Everyone drew a sharp breath of cold air, staring dumbfounded at the huge creature in the sky as if they were being looked down upon by a supreme being. In an instant, many people felt their limbs grow weak.

Dragon Clan! The visitor actually turned out to be a Pureblood Dragon! This was something that not everyone expected.

Dragon Pressure spread forth like a tangible wall, striking upon the Emperor Pressure condensed by the hundred Emperor Realm Masters below, actually shattering it to pieces.

With a crackle, the joint attack of dozens of Emperor Realm Masters landed on the Dragon’s body, causing it to throw back its head and roar as sparks splashed from its armour of scales. The Dragon’s body was incredibly sturdy, but even though all these attacks could not endanger the Dragon’s life, it was enough to cause it much pain and anger.

The Dragon raised its head high and spat out a mouthful of Dragon Breath.

As if a volcano had erupted, searing flames spat directly from the Dragon’s mouth towards Spirit Sword Peak. Before the attack had even arrived, everyone could feel their skin searing painfully. The Dragon’s flames seemed to be able to burn anything under the sky, and even the Emperor Realm Masters could feel the deadly threat from it.

“Not good!” At the same time as when Yang Kai’s face changed, he stepped out and summoned his Jade Elder Token into his hand, rapidly injecting his Emperor Qi.

Spirit Sword Peak’s Spirit Arrays suddenly activated, creating a visible layer of protection between them.

This was the defence he set up by mobilizing all the power available to Spirit Sword Peak from its Earth Vein. But this had been done in a rush, its full power could not be released.

As soon as the dragon flame hit the barrier, the scorching heat immediately deformed it. The sound of quenching flames was incessant as ripples began to form on the transparent shield, like it was melting away.

Everyone was shocked and wanted to scatter away as none of them had the confidence to face the terrifying power of this dragon flame.

Lei Hong stepped forward at this time and threw out his fist.

The barrier suddenly cracked, and a bolt of lightning the width of a water bucket crashed into the flames, crashing left and right in the flames and reducing some of the pressure on Yang Kai. This blow was the essence of Lei Hong’s cultivation, clearly showing the might of a veteran Third-Order Emperor Realm Master.

The Big Dragon twisted its head and the flames grew even more intense, seemingly strong enough to melt the lightning.

“Enough!” Wen Zi Shan suddenly shouted, and with one hand behind his back gripping a jade disc, he waved his other hand gently and shot out a beam of light, directly cutting off the dragon flames. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The Big Dragon raised its head and hovered high in the air, looking condescendingly down at the crowd. Its huge dragon eyes were covered in the flames of hatred while its mouth was opening and closing as if it would spit out another mouthful of its Dragon Breath at any moment.

Yang Kai withdrew Spirit Sword Peak’s protection and wiped the cold sweat from his forehead.

“State your identity and your intention for coming here, Dragon!” Wen Zi Shan’s face became serious as he looked at the Red Dragon in the sky, thinking to himself that Azure Sun Temple really was eventful as of late. The Demon Spirits escaped, the Bustling World became trapped, Heaven Devourer escaped, and now a Dragon came to visit. He had no idea how this year could be so unlucky as to invite one wave of misfortune after another, but he was getting too tired to deal with this.

But even Wen Zi Shan did not dare to be careless when facing a Pureblood Dragon, because there was only one place in the world where the Dragon Clan could be found. Behind this Red Dragon in front of him was a force that even Great Emperors could not ignore.

“Who hit me? Who hit me just now!?” The Red Dragon did not answer Wen Zi Shan’s question and instead began to roar as if it was greatly humiliated. It could not be any angrier, and the deafening roar was enough to shake the entire Azure Sun Temple.

The Emperor Realm Masters who accidentally attacked the Red Dragon earlier were all pale-faced at this moment. All of them shrank back into the crowd, lest they be recognized by the Red Dragon.

“You, you, and you!” The Red Dragon looked around, eyes stopping on a few Emperor Realm Masters, “As well as you! Stop hiding, I saw you just now! All of you attacked me earlier!”

“I… I didn’t. This Sir, you must have seen wrongly…” The person who spoke shrank even more, cold sweat covering his body.
