Yang Kai followed Xiao Xiao towards the front and soon arrived at an empty area.

Eight Stone Spirits were already gathered here, all standing behind a table with stone plates on them that seemed to have been locally crafted.

Behind the stone tables were some stone chairs.

The ancient Stone Spirit Elder was already sitting at the head of the stone table, smiling widely as he looked in Yang Kai’s direction.

When Yang Kai and Zhang Ruo Xi followed Xiao Xiao here, the Stone Spirits standing at both sides all paid their respects to them, which made Yang Kai feel really awkward. He and Zhang Ruo Xi could only constantly pay their respects in return. All of these Stone Spirits had been alive for countless years already, so it could be said that they were older than almost everyone in the Star Boundary, and Yang Kai couldn’t be rude in front of them.

Two empty stone seats were next to Elder, obviously prepared for Yang Kai and Zhang Ruo Xi.

When they got closer, Elder raised his hand and announced, “Our two Honoured Guests, please have a seat!”

Yang Kai excused himself as he walked over to the stone table next to Elder and sat down. Ruo Xi saw this and could only sit down quietly on the other side.

Meanwhile, Xiao Xiao ran to the back and sat at the other end of the table together with the other Stone Spirits. He kept acting naughty, which caused the Stone Spirit next to him to knock him with its hand and make a clamorous sound. This instantly made Xiao Xiao start behaving.

“It is our Stone Spirit Clan’s honour to receive guests from afar and dedicate this banquet to them. Please don’t mind that our fare isn’t very fancy,” Elder laughed with an uproarious voice that was as loud as thunder which rattled the eardrums.

Yang Kai got up and replied, “Elder, you’re being too kind. It is my honour to receive such treatment from your clan. I wouldn’t dare to mind anything.”

Elder smiled and nodded, indicating for Yang Kai to sit before he continued, “My Stone Spirit Clan has few clansmen. Those you see here are all that remains of my clansmen. Everyone, introduce yourselves to our honoured guest so that he can tell you apart.”

“Yes!” The Stone Spirits all responded and got up in unison as they greeted Yang Kai. The first one introduced himself by saying, “Shi Yi!”

“Shi Er!”

“Shi San!”

…

“Shi Ba!”

Yang Kai was so stunned that his face couldn’t stop twitching.

These Stone Spirits had really simple names, as all of them were named with numbers. When counting Elder and Xiao Xiao, there were still only ten Stone Spirit clansmen in total. They really were ridiculously few in number.

More importantly, the Stone Spirits’ self-introductions weren’t very useful. Yang Kai kept glancing between them and felt like they all looked identical. He couldn’t tell who was who at all.

Although he couldn’t differentiate between them, he still had to be polite, so Yang Kai greeted them all and acted as if he remembered them, but to be honest, he couldn’t identify a single one.

After the eight Stone Spirits finished introducing themselves, Elder chuckled and said, “My Stone Spirit Clan has never had more than ten members before. One will definitely die if we exceed ten. That is the Will of the Heavens.”

Yang Kai exclaimed in astonishment, “Your clan has never had more than ten clansmen before?”

Elder nodded, “Indeed!”

Yang Kai had a sudden realization, [No wonder why only Xiao Xiao had hatched successfully back when I obtained two Stone Spirit Embryos. I was forced to refine the other one with my Soul Clone in order to help it survive.]

At the time, he thought that he had been unlucky, but now it seemed that it was actually related to Heavens Will, rather than any problem with how he raised them.

He wondered how the Stone Spirits would react if he let Embodiment come out right now.

Elder then continued, “Even though we have few clansmen, we have no conflict with the world, which is how we survived until now. It must seem silly to our honoured guest.”

Yang Kai hurriedly waved his hand.

“Haha, I think that is enough idle chat. Let’s begin the evening party,” Elder chuckled and continued in a hearty voice, “This place is simple and has nothing to treat you with apart from some spirit fruits and spirit wine. I hope you will not mind it, Honoured Guest.”

“I wouldn’t dare disapprove!” Yang Kai had a confused look as he replied.

Elder was talking about giving him some spirit fruits and spirit wine, but Yang Kai didn’t see anything on the table at all. Besides, all ten clansmen of the Stone Spirit Clan were here, so who would bring the plates of food and wine? Yang Kai glanced around but saw that the other nine Stone Spirits, Xiao Xiao included, were just sitting there without moving. In fact, all their eyes were filled with expectation as they looked at the deep part of the forest.

[What is going on?] Yang Kai’s mind was filled with doubts, but he could only quietly watch to see what would happen.

*Pa pa!* Elder suddenly clapped twice, as if he was summoning something.

The trees in the area suddenly glowed with many different brilliant colours, as if ribbons of light had come alive between the tree crowns and the forest.

It seemed as if numerous dainty figures started flying in the hazy light, all of them moving along the coloured ribbons like they were descending from the Heavens above, a scene of indescribable beauty.

Yang Kai instantly widened his eyes when he saw the numerous tiny people about the size of his palm mysteriously appear. These small people didn’t seem to have physical bodies as they glowed brilliantly and had dainty and exquisite figures, like they were carved from the purest jade.

The forest instantly became lively as several hundred of these tiny people poured out from all directions. There were both males and females, with the men having clean faces and handsome appearances, and the women having beautiful features. The women also wore tiny dresses that exposed their exquisite arms and legs to show their snow-white skin.

These tiny beings were all carrying various things as they flew to the stone table and placed their objects down.

Soon, the stone table was covered in stone cups, wine barrels, and baskets of fragrant spirit fruits. These baskets had likely been woven from vines, as they seemed quite exquisitely crafted, with each small basket being filled with various different spirit fruits that had already been cleaned and were ready to eat.

Yang Kai and Ruo Xi had never seen such beings before, so neither of them even blinked in their astonishment.

A small female fairy flew over to Yang Kai and put down the basket that was in her arms, raising her head to see that Yang Kai was staring right at her with eyes wide open, so her cheeks immediately became bright red as she covered her face and retreated. It seemed like she was incredibly embarrassed, which made Yang Kai feel rather apologetic since he felt like he had scared her. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Meanwhile, Zhang Ruo Xi reached out with a finger and poked a small female on the face, but the latter unexpectedly slapped away her finger, pursed her lips, and angrily left.

Ruo Xi couldn’t help but stick out her tongue. Still, her beautiful eyes kept staring unceasingly at these tiny people.

These beautiful small beings naturally attracted a great deal of her interest and she secretly felt like it would be nice if she could take a few back with her to raise.

“Elder, they are…” Yang Kai finally managed to regain his senses as he turned to look at the Stone Spirit Elder.

Elder chuckled, “They are the Wood Spirit Clan, who coexist symbiotically with our Stone Spirit Clan. They are our Stone Spirit Clan’s most reliable ally!” He paused for a moment before adding, “Our Stone Spirit Clan needs their assistance for many things, while the Wood Spirit Clan isn’t skilled at fighting, so it is difficult for them to survive in the Ancient Lands. They need our clan’s protection, so we mutually assist each other.”

Yang Kai understood as he nodded, “So, that’s how it is.”

These small people definitely didn’t seem like they were skilled at combat, and it was likely that any random Monster Beast would be able to kill a large number of them. The Ancient Lands were a dangerous place, so if this clan wanted to survive, they would have to rely on someone strong.

Obviously, they had chosen to rely on the Stone Spirit Clan.

Yang Kai had truly learned much on his trip to the Ancient Lands. Not only did he meet all of Xiao Xiao’s clansmen, he even met this wondrous Wood Spirit Clan. Any ordinary person likely wouldn’t even know of the existence of these two races.

As they were talking, a small Wood Spirit who seemed different from the others somehow flew over. She was wearing clearly more extravagant clothing than the others, and her aura was nobler and purer as well. Her exquisite face actually possessed a pearly white glow that made her seem divine and untouchable. She also had a strange crown on her head.

Elder introduced her, “This is the Wood Spirit Clan’s Clan Head, Mu Na.”

Yang Kai hurriedly got up, “Yang Kai greets Senior Mu!”

Although this Wood Spirit Clan Head was only as large as his palm, which made her seem rather cute and unimposing, since she was the Clan Head of her entire clan, she was obviously someone who had been alive for an unknown number of years already. It was only natural to address her as Senior.

Mu Na smiled gently and raised her hand, “Since you are the Stone Spirit Clan’s guest, you are my Wood Spirit Clan’s guest as well. Now that you’re here, treat this as your own home; there’s no need to be reserved.”

Elder smiled, “Normally, it’s quite difficult to be able to eat the Wood Spirit Clan’s spirit fruit and spirit wine. It’s thanks to our Honoured Guest today that we get to fill our stomachs.”

Mu Na covered her mouth and smiled, “Elder, you shouldn’t blatantly say such a ridiculous thing. Our Wood Spirit Clan has never been stingy with our spirit fruits and spirit wine to you.”

When the Stone Spirits heard this, they all chuckled, making it obvious that they often obtained food and drink from the Wood Spirit Clan.

Yang Kai could tell that these two species didn’t have a simple relationship of protection and reliance. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for Elder and the Wood Spirit Clan Head to have such a casual conversation.

Elder raised his hand, “Since our Honoured Guest has come all the way here, during such a fortuitous time, we shall drink until we are drunk!”

The other Stone Spirits all instantly began to cry and howl as they made loud banging noises on the stone table. It was as if they were about to head out for war and slaughter, which made Yang Kai’s heart tremble. He couldn’t figure out how such a violent species like the Stone Spirit Clan could coexist peacefully with the Wood Spirit Clan.

Even Xiao Xiao was going crazy with excitement.

More than ten female Wood Spirits instantly flew out from the side and went up to each guest as they struggled with the wine barrels and prepared to fill everyone’s stone cups.

The female Wood Spirit who came over to serve Yang Kai seemed to be the same one who flew away in embarrassment because he had been staring at her earlier. Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel sorry for her when he saw how difficult it was for her to pick up the wine barrel, so he hurriedly said, “I can do it by myself. There’s no need to trouble yourself.”

After he said that, the female Wood Spirit couldn’t help but look at him as her eyes instantly reddened with tears flowing in her eyes. She really seemed quite pitiful.

Yang Kai broke out into a cold sweat as he didn’t know what he had said wrong and hurriedly pleaded for help with his expression as he looked at Elder.

Elder chuckled, “Although the Wood Spirit Clan generally dislikes strangers, anyone who can become their guest will see their determination to be gracious hosts. Their most basic etiquette is about serving wine to their guests, so if a guest refuses, that means they haven’t done well enough, and the server will end up being excluded by all their clansmen.”

Silavin. So, their names are literally Stone One, Stone Two, Stone Three and so on…

Poor little spirit girl…

PewPew: The Wood Spirits here are different from the Wood Spirit that went crazy back in Maplewood city… it just doesn’t translate well so… sorry.

Silavin: Well, they are a race. They can come from a similar origin but branched out. I don’t think it is that strange.
