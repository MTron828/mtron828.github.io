Time passed on just like that while Yang Kai cultivated inside the mountain.

Yang You Wei was very astute, so after he was sent away by Zhang Ruo Xi that day, he did not appear again. But Yang Kai wasn’t afraid of him playing any tricks. Currently, Yang You Wei’s Soul Brand was in his hands, so Yang You Wei couldn’t get out of his control. If the latter dared to have any crooked thoughts, he would be seeking his own death.

Zhang Ruo Xi hadn’t come again either as she was completely focused on her cultivation. She was now a Third-Order Dao Source Realm and had gained a lot of benefits in Shattered Star Sea. She had even obtained an intact Star Source and after refining it, she had begun comprehending Emperor Intent. She was just looking for an opportunity now to break through to the Emperor Realm.

After one month, the door was knocked on again.

Yang Kai opened his eyes and opened the door with the wave of his hand.

Yang You Wei respectfully came in and reported, cupping his fists, “Sir, I have some news.”

Yang Kai didn’t want to delay the matter of Bing Yun’s Third Disciple any longer as once he was done with it, he could finally search for Xiao Xiao in peace. Therefore, as soon as he was done listening to Yang You Wei, he set off without wasting a single moment.

Just as he walked out of the door, Zhang Ruo Xi, who had received Yang Kai’s Divine Sense Message, also hurriedly walked out. After exchanging a glance, Yang Kai slightly nodded to her, after which Zhang Ruo Xi followed him without a word.

A streak of light soared into the sky, leaving the top of the mountain before turning in the air and shooting towards a certain direction.

On the way, Yang You Wei carefully reported his findings.

His twenty-some Monster Race subordinates who had survived the last incident had been searching for the Third Disciple’s tracks over the past month, and just half a day ago, one subordinate had suddenly discovered something and quickly reported it to Yang You Wei. The Third Disciple was too vigilant though, so that subordinate had kept a good distance after finding traces of her. They had found the Third Disciple many times over these few decades, but they were unable to capture her, so they had developed a habit of secretly tracking her from afar.

But then again, Yang You Wei’s subordinates weren’t the Third Disciple’s opponent even if they attacked her head-on.

Yang Kai knew that Yang You Wei wasn’t even aware that the Third Disciple was already a Second-Order Emperor, otherwise, how would he dare to attack her so valiantly and spiritedly?

According to the subordinate’s report, the Third Disciple seemed to have been hiding under a local river. They had been able to find her all because of some chances and coincidences. Perhaps it was because the Third Disciple was hiding for too long and wanted to take a breath, she had come out and exposed herself.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. As expected, it was easier to do things with more people.

It was a wise decision to not kill Yang You Wei and instead subdue him at the time, allowing him to search for the Third Disciple. If not, who knows how long it would have taken Yang Kai to find a trace of her.

The journey wasn’t long, but before Yang Kai’s group could even reach their destination, a Monster Race member came flying from the front.

Yang You Wei focused his gaze before hurriedly informing, “It’s my subordinate.”

He took the lead and greeted the Monster Race member, and as soon as the two met, they whispered a few sentences with each other. Immediately after, Yang You Wei’s expression drastically changed and he promptly turned and looked at Yang Kai with anxiety.

Seeing the drastic change in expression on his face, Yang Kai’s heart tightened and he quickly asked, “What’s wrong?”

Yang You Wei bitterly replied, “We were discovered.”

“She ran away again?” Yang Kai asked with a cold look on his face. Last time, the Third Disciple had been hiding for a month after running away. This time, she might hide for more than a month. How could he waste so much time here?

“It can be said that she ran, and it can also be said that she didn’t!” Yang You Wei looked embarrassed, as if he didn’t know how to explain this to Yang Kai.

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai coldly looked at him.

Yang You Wei opened his mouth and sighed before replying, “That woman entered the tomb!”

“What tomb?” Yang Kai frowned.

“The Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb!” Yang You Wei had an agonized expression as his face turned pale and he shuddered as he spoke this name, as if he dreaded it deeply.

Yang Kai coldly laughed and ordered, “I don’t give a damn. I order you to continue tracking her, otherwise, I will take really good care of you!”

Yang You Wei cried in surprise, “Sir! I think you are hearing about the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb for the first time and do not know its circumstances. After you come to know about it, you will understand that this lowly one wants to follow your orders but is unable to do so.”

Yang Kai coldly glared at him, realizing Yang You Wei wasn’t just trying to alarm him and asked, “Fine. Let’s hear what tricks you are up to?”

Yang You Wei bitterly stated, “This lowly one wouldn’t dare. Sir, let me tell you, the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb is an invisible place. It’s also the tomb of all the beings of the Ancient Lands.”

“How can it be invisible?”

Yang You Wei bitterly replied, “No one knows where it is, and it’s also impossible to find.”

Yang Kai angrily rebuked, “You just said that the Third Disciple has entered the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb, now you are saying that no one can find where it is? Do you think this Young Master is a three-year-old who you can fool anytime?”

Zhang Ruo Xi also glared at him with a cold and unkind look on her face. The main reason was that what Yang You Wei had said was too contradictory, making it hard not to be suspicious of him.

Yang You Wei was terrified as he felt pressure on his Soul, knowing that if he didn’t explain it clearly, he would have to part with his life today. Anxiously, he stated, “Sir, please calm yourself, what this lowly one said is indeed true. The entire Ancient Lands knows about the existence of the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb. You can find out about it by just asking anyone. How could I dare lie to you?”

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, feeling like Yang You Wei would not be joking with this, waving his hand and snapping, “Go on!”

Yang You Wei let out a breath of relief, knowing he had managed to keep his life for now. Organizing his thoughts for a moment, he then continued, “The Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb is ethereal and impossible to trace. It can appear anywhere or anytime in the Ancient Lands with no set pattern. It might remain for one or two days, or even several months, but only one entrance will appear each time. If you want to enter, you can only enter through that entrance, but after so many years, no one who has entered has ever come out ever again. And… Once the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb appears, the nearby Monster Beasts and the Ancient Lands residents who are about to die of old age would take the initiative to enter it and wait for their death. This is why it is called the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb. Along with the Blood Gate, they are the two Restricted Areas of the Ancient Lands.”

[What in the world is this Blood Gate?] Yang Kai didn’t know what the Blood Gate was, but since it was designated as a Restricted Area, it must be an incomparably dangerous place.

Yang Kai didn’t even bother to ask about the Blood Gate as he was only interested in confirming the current situation, “So, according to you, this Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb is the place where the residents of Ancient Lands go at their predestined time of death, right?”

“Sir understands correctly!” Yang You Wei said, bowing.

“So, why did the Third Disciple go in?” Yang Kai asked, furrowing his brow.

Yang You Wei thought to himself, [You are asking me, but who am I going to ask?] But he didn’t dare to complain and could only bitterly reply, “This lowly one also has no idea, but since she has gone in… I’m afraid things aren’t looking good for her because even when the strongest Monster Kings enter, they can only remain inside and wait for death.”

When he mentioned this, he hoped that this Sir would not do anything rash.

But Yang Kai only pondered for a moment before he ordered, waving his hand, “Lead the way, let’s go and see this Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb.”

Yang You Wei felt that he had wasted his breath and wailed in his heart. He wanted to dissuade him but when he met Yang Kai’s threatening gaze, he honestly led the way ahead.

After a short while, a small group landed near the entrance of a mountain valley. Immediately after, several Monster Race members came from the jungle. Yang Kai found them familiar as he had seen them last time. They were all Yang You Wei’s subordinates.

“Sir!” The few Monster Race members stepped forward and saluted.

Yang You Wei waved his hand and asked to stand aside, warily staring at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai also looked at the mountain valley, trying to find the Ten Thousand Spirits Tombs, but he found nothing, frowning as he asked, “Where is the tomb?”

Yang You Wei looked at a subordinate and that Monster Race member immediately replied, pointing ahead, “It’s just ahead.”

“Quit playing with me!” Yang Kai’s face turned gloomier and colder.

Yang You Wei was shocked as he hurriedly stated, “This lowly one doesn’t dare to. It’s just that the entrance to the tomb is invisible, one cannot see it unless they have reached the end of his or her lifespan, only then will they be able to find some clues.”

“Really?” Yang Kai suspiciously looked at Yang You Wei. He didn’t find anything with his powerful Divine Sense, but Yang You Wei seemed to be speaking with absolute certainty, which made it harder for him to not doubt it.

“Sir, can’t you see it?” Zhang Ruo Xi suddenly intervened.

“See what?” Yang Kai looked at her in amazement.

“There is a door of light over there, a dark grey door of light!” Zhang Ruo Xi replied, pointing in a certain direction.

The eyes of the few Monster Race members present here widened in shock as they stared at Zhang Ruo Xi in disbelief.

Yang Kai was still looking around and thoroughly swept the area with his Divine Sense, but still came up with nothing, stating in frustration, “There’s nothing there.”

“How is that possible? It’s obviously there…” A doubtful look appeared on Zhang Ruo Xi’s face.

Yang You Wei timidly looked at Zhang Ruo Xi and tentatively asked, “Young Lady… Can you see… The entrance of the tomb?”

“That’s right!” Zhang Ruo Xi didn’t know what was so strange about it.

Yang You Wei’s countenance immediately became unnatural as he looked around and found that the other members of the Monster Race had strange looks on their faces too.

Yang Kai coldly looked over at them and asked with a snort, “Didn’t you say that only someone at the end of their lifespan can see the entrance? How do you explain this? Is Ruo Xi about to die of old age too?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Zhang Ruo Xi was taken aback, furrowing her delicate brow as she angrily glared at Yang You Wei.

It was like Yang You Wei was actually cursing her to die! Just as she had first suspected, he was a bad man!

Yang You Wei stated with a crying look on his face, “This saying has been there since ancient times and remains true till today. Therefore, when this lowly one said that the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb is invisible he was simply stating the truth. I also don’t know what’s going on!” He turned to one of his subordinates and grabbed him by his collar, angrily asking, “Are you sure that the entrance to the tomb is right there?”

The Monster Race member hurriedly nodded, “Yes, yes! That woman disappeared when she went in. When she entered, the entrance to the tomb flashed. Everyone saw it!”

The two Monster Race members on the side also repeatedly nodded in agreement.

Yang You Wei finally let him go and anxiously looked at Yang Kai.

*Dong dong dong…*

Right then, several loud thuds sounded, as if something huge was approaching, and from the direction of the sound, trees could be heard snapping and crashing to the ground.

Yang Kai and the others turned their heads when they heard this clatter and quickly caught sight of a rising cloud of dust. A huge figure was coming from the jungle, step by step, shaking the ground and mountains.

Also, many Monster Race members happened to be flying in the sky above the huge figure, constantly shouting, all looking extremely anxious.
