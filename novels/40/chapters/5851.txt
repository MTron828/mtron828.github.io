All the frontlines had achieved a great victory. Everyone was in high spirits when the news of the Armies defeating the Black Ink Clan travelled back to the Human Race’s rear camps.

Since the Black Ink Clan invaded the 3,000 Worlds, the Human Race was forced to evacuate and many were forced to abandon their homelands for High Heaven Territory, giving up the place of their birth and the foundation laid by their ancestors.

To the Humans, that was a painful and humiliating incident.

But before they could recover from their pain and humiliation, they were met with a huge war to decide the survival of the Human Race. The Humans were trapped in the dozen or so Great Territory Battlefields and were constantly at war with the Black Ink Clan for thousands of years.

During all that time, all Humans endured great regret and humiliation while accumulating their strength.

A few hundred years ago, the Universe Furnace suddenly appeared, breaking the stalemate between the two Races and causing an all-out war to erupt. Relying on the gains they achieved in the Universe Furnace, the Humans were able to achieve a massive victory and subsequently reclaimed numerous lost lands.

However, when the Black Ink Clan Army began retaliating in full, the war reached a stalemate again. No one knew how long the war would last or if they could live to see who achieved the final victory.

No one had expected that victory would arrive so unexpectedly!

One after another, the Supreme Headquarters made announcements filled with good news. When the ones trapped and unable to battle saw the number of enemies killed and the progress of reclaiming their lost land, they felt like they finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel.

In just a few short months, the 12 Human Race Armies had completely defeated the enemy, all but wiping out the Black Ink Clan in the 3,000 Worlds.

The Humans rejoiced!

After another half a year, there were no longer large-scale battles and the 12 Human Race Armies dispersed into Divisions that scoured the Great Territories, hunting down and killing any remnants of the Black Ink Clan.

Now, the Humans had finally fully reclaimed the 3,000 Worlds, which had been in the Black Ink Clan’s hands for thousands of years.

Throughout all of this, there was one name that all Humans would remember in particular, one name that was key to the Human Race’s re-conquest of the 3,000 World.

Yang Kai! A Great Emperor of the Star Boundary, Sect Master of High Heaven Palace, and one of the new generation of Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters.

After using various channels to get the latest news, the Humans finally understood why the war ended so quickly.

It was because Yang Kai was a huge threat to the Pseudo-Royal Lords, and his amazing Space Secret Techniques deterred the Black Ink Clan, forcing them to recall all the Pseudo-Royal Lords to the No-Return Pass.

Without the Pseudo-Royal Lords, the Black Ink Clan Armies were like tigers without teeth and could easily be defeated.

Therefore, during this period, one name was spoken of everywhere Humans lived…

At the same time, outside the Supreme Headquarters’ Universe Fragment, Yang Kai and Mi Jing Lun were standing side by side. The latter was puzzled because he didn’t know why Yang Kai was trying to be mysterious by dragging him out here.

After parting ways with Wu Qing, Yang Kai had a fruitful journey as he travelled about while killing any Black Ink Clansmen he found along the way. However, the Black Ink Clan soldiers were scattered throughout all the Great Territories, and with the current situation, it would be hard to find them all because they would be in hiding. Since Yang Kai couldn’t do much about it alone, he decided to hand this matter over to the 12 Armies. They had separated into individual Divisions and were now sweeping through the Great Territories, wiping out any remnants of the Black Ink Clan who were in hiding.

Yang Kai believed that the Black Ink Clansmen left in the 3,000 Worlds would be entirely annihilated in a matter of a few years. Only then would the 3,000 Worlds be considered fully reclaimed.

Of course, reclaiming the 3,000 Worlds only had a symbolic significance to the Humans because the current 3,000 Worlds was a barren land with nothing but destroyed Universe Worlds and broken Universe Fragments floating about the void.

Therefore, even if the Humans had fully reclaimed the 3,000 Worlds, those who left their homelands still couldn’t return to them. It could be said that this was an extremely sad situation, but nothing could be done about it.

As such, Yang Kai didn’t waste any more time searching for remnants of the Black Ink Clan and instead returned to the Supreme Headquarters to find Mi Jing Lun.

He had gathered quite a lot of things and it was now time to share them.

“Junior Brother, what are we doing here?” Mi Jing Lun couldn’t help but ask.

Yang Kai said dismissively, “Calm down, Senior Brother. I have a surprise for you.”

While saying so, Yang Kai reached into his robes and took out a sphere he had shrunk using his Space-Time River before throwing it out.

Feeling confused, Mi Jing Lun looked upwards and saw the small Space-Time River was filled with dense Dao Strengths. Even as a Ninth-Order Master, he couldn’t help but feel astonished.

He sensed something special about the Space-Time River; also, he knew that although they were both Ninth-Order Masters, Yang Kai’s attainment in the various Grand Daos was much higher and more numerous than his own achievements.

The Space-Time River was spinning like a ball of loose thread, and it would expand a little with every turn. As time passed, it expanded to become something majestic-looking.

In just a short moment, a huge object appeared in Mi Jing Lun’s sight, thoroughly shocking him.

He had realised what it was when it had just begun taking form, but he wasn’t sure until he finally saw the full, majestic, nearly intact Great Pass!

Yang Kai raised his hand and summoned back his Space-Time River, returning the Dao Strengths back to his body. Then, he turned to look at Mi Jing Lun, “Senior Brother, how about using this as the future Supreme Headquarters?”

While gazing at Yang Kai with mixed emotions, Mi Jing Lun nodded, “Good idea!”

He grabbed Yang Kai’s arms and ushered, “Come. Take a look with me.”

Side by side, the two strode towards the majestically-standing Great Pass, and when they arrived at the entrance, they looked up at the worn characters engraved there and fell silent.

This Great Pass used to be a critical weapon in the war against the Black Ink Clan. For hundreds of thousands of years, legions of Humans had shed blood in and around this Great Pass. The Humans managed to keep the Black Ink Clan trapped in the Black Ink Battlefield in large part thanks to these Great Passes.

The void was silent, but when they arrived before the Great Pass, the two felt like they could still hear the sounds of the brutal wars fought here long ago. They were the sounds of Human soldiers fighting against the Black Ink Clan, along with sounds of the last moments of their lives.

This Great Pass used to stand majestically on the Black Ink Battlefield, like all other Great Passes. It had also previously accompanied the Human Race Army on its crusade to the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. However, the Humans were ultimately defeated and forced to abandon this Great Pass outside the No-Return Pass.

Having fallen into the hands of the enemy, the Black Ink Clan naturally wouldn’t cherish this weapon. Although the Great Pass was mostly intact, the Inner Sanctum was a wreck, and there were all kinds of traces left behind from the Black Ink Clan removing their Black Ink Nests.

Two figures walked around the Great Pass and soon arrived before a huge monument. Every Great Pass possessed a Monument of Heroes which recorded the names and origins of every soldier that died in battle there.

This monument was also the only trace their Ancestors left in this world because, during the battles, most of the soldiers who died would perish without corpses.

After cleaning away the thick layer of dust on the Monument of Heroes, Mi Jing Lun sighed, “Junior Brother, you’re too thoughtful.”

With this Great Pass, the Supreme Headquarters could move around more easily and didn’t have to simply remain in one area. Moreover, Mi Jing Lun had become a Ninth-Order Master, and with the help of this Great Pass, he would be able to make even larger contributions in future wars.

“It’s a pity that I couldn’t bring more of them back,” Yang Kai shook his head. As the Black Ink Clan also knew about the power of these Great Passes, letting Yang Kai bring one of them away was already their limit. It was impossible for Mo Na Ye to agree to Yang Kai bringing more of them back.

Of course, it was not like Yang Kai could bring another one with him anyway.

“Do we still have Pure Yang Pass’ Core?” Yang Kai asked.

Every Great Pass had a Core, as operating such a huge Great Pass wasn’t easy. When the Great Evolution Army reclaimed the Great Evolution Pass, they couldn’t find the Core and it almost delayed the Human Race’s crusade. In the end, Yang Kai entered the Void Crack and found the Core.

Since Great Evolution Pass had a Core, Pure Yang Pass would have one too. According to what Yang Kai knew, the Humans brought all the remaining Cores with them when they withdrew to the Barren Territory.

So, Pure Yang Pass’ Core was most likely with them, but Yang Kai didn’t know who was guarding it.

“We still have it. All the Cores from the Great Passes are with Senior Sister Xiao Xiao. I’ll go and ask her for it later,” Mi Jing Lun replied, but then he suddenly felt frustrated, “It will take a lot of resources to repair this thing.”

When the Humans abandoned the No-Return Pass, they not only brought away the Cores, but also all the artifacts and Spirit Arrays they could take. Those that they couldn’t bring away were destroyed lest the Black Ink Clan used them.

Therefore, this Great Pass was now just an empty shell. If they wanted to restore it to its full potential, they would have to renovate it almost from scratch, which would cost an unfathomable amount of resources. Right now, the Humans biggest concern was the general lack of materials and resources.

In simpler terms, they were dirt poor!

Yang Kai laughed and took out a number of Space Rings, saying, “I forgot to tell you, Pure Yang Pass isn’t the only thing I brought back from the Black Ink Clan. There’s also this.”

Mi Jing Lun’s eyes lit up when he saw the Space Rings, “How much is there?”

Yang Kai replied, “About 100 million sets of Fifth-Order materials.”

When Mi Jing Lun heard that, he was so shocked that his face visibly twitched, “How could the Black Ink Clan have agreed to this?”

If Yang Kai hadn’t had such a remarkable battle record, Mi Jing Lun would have thought he had made some sort of secret deal with the Black Ink Clan; otherwise, he wouldn’t have gotten such a frightening amount. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“It wasn’t up to them whether they agreed or not,” while Yang Kai spoke, he threw the Space Rings over to Mi Jing Lun.

With so many resources on hand, the Humans had one less thing to worry about. Moreover, the 12 Armies should have looted quite a lot on their recent conquest; after all, the Black Ink Clan needed a lot of resources too, so every Black Ink Clan Army would carry many valuable materials on them, all of which belonged to the Humans.

But Mi Jing Lun still couldn’t believe that Yang Kai could snatch so much from the Black Ink Clan. It was clearly something that benefited the enemy, yet the Black Ink Clan still agreed to it, which showed how wary they were of Yang Kai.
