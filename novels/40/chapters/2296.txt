“A planned meeting cannot compare to one destined by fate! Ye’er, why don’t we enter the city together? I have obtained some excellent Dark Blood Tea, and was eagerly seeking someone to taste it with. Would you do me the honour?” Qiu Yu turned around and said with a smile.

Ye Jing Han replied coldly, “The path we are taking is different. So, no!”

Saying so, she called out to Du Xian and the others, “Senior Brother, let’s go.”

Du Xian nodded lightly then smiled at Qiu Yu, as if he had won, “Young Master Qiu, you should slowly enjoy your tea alone, be careful to not choke on it.”

“Hehe, Brother Du, many thanks for your concern,” Qiu Yu didn’t get angry and just replied with a smile.

After a short moment, the members of Thousand Leaves Sect all entered the city. Likewise, Qiu Yu, who was already bored of this place, headed back to the city with the two old men and disappeared among the crowd.

“What kind of background does that Qiu Yu have? It seemed like his status was not simple,” upon entering the city, Yang Kai asked curiously.

Ye Jing Han let out a sigh and replied, “He’s the Young Master of Sky Illumination Palace, a Sect at odds with our Thousand Leaves Sect. They have repeatedly tried to suppress us, but we are still here. I also heard that Sky Illumination Palace’s Master, Qiu Ze, has gone into secluded cultivation in an attempt to break through to the Emperor Realm. If he were to succeed, then...”

Saying so, a worried look appeared on Ye Jing Han’s face.

Du Xian spoke, “Sky Crane City and Sky Illumination Palace are working together, so if Qiu Ze becomes an Emperor Realm Master, our Thousand Leaves Sect’s future will be bleak.”

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai realized that the City Lord’s new backer was none other than Sky Illumination Palace.

Wu Ma continued, “It isn’t that easy to enter the Emperor Realm. That old man Qiu Ze will probably suffer cultivation dissonance during his breakthrough and die.”

The crowd clearly discerned that he had just cursed him to die. However, since Qiu Ze dared to attempt a breakthrough to the Emperor Realm, then he surely had the confidence to succeed, and if he really did, the Thousand Leaves Sect would be in big trouble.

“Our Master has his own plans regarding this, so we just have to diligently perform our own duties,” Du Xian had realized that his Fellow Brothers had fallen into a low mood and he quickly consoled them.

.....

In Sky Crane City, the members of Thousand Leaves Sect stopped in front of a store called the Heavenly Puppet Workshop.

Ye Jing Han introduced it to Yang Kai, “This is our greatest industry in Sky Crane City. If you don’t mind, you can stay here for two days. Once tomorrow’s wedding comes to an end, we’ll return to the Main Sect.”

“En!” Yang Kai gazed at the grandiose and luxurious Heavenly Puppet Workshop then nodded.

He could clearly discern that the Heavenly Puppet Workshop’s business had once been amazing, as any store built in such an expensive plot of land would be as bustling with plenty of business.

But, this was clearly a matter of the past. The current Heavenly Puppet Workshop was completely deserted and the goods on the shelves were left to collect dust. Even the clerk was just dozing off behind the counter. This clerk was laughing in his sleep while drooling. Obviously, he must be having a pretty good dream.

“The business here is quite... bleak.” Yang Kai sighed with emotions.

Ye Jing Han smiled bitterly, “If a store is usually surrounded by a few vicious-looking men, using the name of the City Lord, it would naturally make our customers feel uncomfortable. Over time, who would dare buy anything from us?”

Upon hearing her, Yang Kai noticed a few thugs near the store and they were all looking at the doors of Heavenly Puppet Workshop with a sneer, as if they were ready to make a move at any moment. However, upon seeing the badge of the Thousand Leaves Sect on the robes of Ye Jing Han and her companions, these thugs hurriedly averted their gazes.

Yang Kai let out a chuckle, “Your Sect’s standing and businesses in Sky Crane City are in quite the conundrum.”

Ye Jing Han’s expression turned gloomy, “En... It’s gotten even worse than before... Young Master Yang, please come in!”

Yang Kai nodded and entered the store under the lead of Ye Jing Han.

Du Xian, Wu Man, and the others exchanged glances in confusion. They had all noticed that Ye Jing Han valued Yang Kai greatly, and she treated him respectfully, as if he was some important and noble guest. But, no matter how much they observed Yang Kai, he looked like an ordinary Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator. Therefore, they could not understand why Ye Jing Han was treating him with so much care.

But, this wasn’t time for questions. After they entered the store, Wu Ma rushed over to the counter and struck it several times to wake up the sleeping clerk.

The clerk must have also been a disciple of Thousand Leaves Sect, but his cultivation wasn’t high and his status was also pretty low. Upon seeing Ye Jing Han and her companions, he was scared out of his mind and his face turned pale. He could only lower his head and acknowledge his mistake.

Ye Jing Han waved her hand at him impatiently, “Ask the shopkeeper to arrange several rooms for us.”

“Understood, I’ll go right away to call the shopkeeper. Young Lady, please wait for a short while.” The clerk was scared witless and he rushed quickly to the back room as if he had just gotten amnesty.

After a short moment, an old man who seemed to be in his fifties walked out of the back room and went toward Ye Jing Han and her companions in quick strides. He bowed to them then brought them to the back room and made appropriate arrangements for them.

The wedding ceremony was being held tomorrow and there were no other important events today, so after Ye Jing Han helped Yang Kai settle down in his room, she went back to her room and waited for a short while, until she heard someone knocking on her door.

She moved toward the door with light steps and opened it only to see Du Xian standing there with a bright smile. The young woman’s face got flushed and she invited him into the room bashfully, a room which would be shortly drowned in sugary words of love.

.....

Yang Kai was sitting cross-legged in his room, resting.

He had come to Sky Crane City with Ye Jing Han only by pure chance and he planned to just spend his days here in peace.

But, he still felt uneasy for some unknown reason, and he felt like something major would shortly occur, making it impossible for him to calm down.

This was the first time he had such a feeling, he had never experienced something like this when cultivating.

He didn’t dare to take this lightly and he started examining his body repeatedly with his Divine Sense, out of fear that he suffered some hidden damage during his cultivation or he formed a Heart Demon unknowingly.

But, he still didn’t find any issue no matter how much he inspected his body. Rather, his uneasiness had only gotten stronger.

He furrowed his brows and started mulling this over. He noticed that he got this feeling ever since he had entered Sky Crane City, as if something here was affecting him.

It was a very peculiar feeling, but Yang Kai did not dismiss this sensation as irrelevant. He had already reached a fairly high realm and no external event would be able to perturb his inner peace without it being of true significance.

Yang Kai mulled this over for a long time, yet couldn’t come up with an answer and he could only let out a sigh and stand up.

He planned to greet Ye Jing Han and tell her that he would go out for a walk, but upon releasing his Divine Sense, he saw Ye Jing Han and Du Xian flirting in the room and his face had immediately darkened.

They weren’t really doing anything overboard. Du Xian was just holding Ye Jing Han’s hand and looking at her affectionately while showering her with words expressing his deep yearning for her. As for Ye Jing Han, she just lowered her head with her cheeks and neck flushed.

Yang Kai quickly took back his Divine Sense, as he was afraid that he would shortly gouge his eyes out if he continued watching this sight.

He didn’t tell anyone about what he had just seen and his body quickly flickered as he left Heavenly Puppet Workshop to appear in the crowded main street.

Sky Crane City could be considered one of the Southern Territory’s medium-sized cities, so both its overall layout and scale were far above Maplewood City. Its streets were big enough for eight carriages to pass side by side and they were filled with a throng of cultivators.

There were many stores set up at the sides of the street with loud shouts reverberating in them.

The whole city had a special festive air and was decorated with coloured lanterns and banners, which was most likely because of the wedding ceremony tomorrow. The city was bustling with activity and all cultivators wore bright smiles across their faces. One could make a guess as to why they were so cheerful.

Yang Kai walked along with the crowd and he quickly entered a restaurant filled with guests.

He was quickly welcomed by a cordial waiter. This waiter was also a cultivator, but his cultivation was pretty low, only in the Saint Realm. The waiter bowed to Yang Kai with a smile plastered across his face, “Sir, please come in. You look like a new face here, did you come to drink alone, or are you here to meet a friend?”

Yang Kai cast a glance at him and said with a smile, “I’m just by myself!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The waiter smiled in understanding, “Understood, please have a seat here.”

Saying so, he brought Yang Kai to the third floor and offered a table next to the window to him then said with a smile, “Sir, what would you like to order? I’m not trying to brag, but there aren’t any restaurants in Sky Crane City better than ours. All ingredients used by us are from fresh Monster Beasts, cooked with exquisite Spirit Herbs and Fruits. If you can consume them all year long, then even someone at your esteemed realm will receive some consolidation effects. If one is lucky enough, then one may even achieve a breakthrough. This has occurred in our restaurant a few times already.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his brows in surprise and spoke with a smile, “What do you think someone at my cultivation should have?”

The waiter chuckled, “Sir, I can guess with a glance that you’re a Dao Source Realm cultivator, so you should obviously have the best dishes and wine. The only thing missing would be the company of a beauty.”

The waiter had been working here for many years and he had already gotten a pair of pretty discerning eyes. He was just a Saint Realm cultivator, yet he still discerned that Yang Kai was at the Dao Source Realm. He wasn’t just decent looking, he was also slick-tongued and could easily get on people’s good side.

Yang Kai chuckled, “Alright, I’ll leave it to you.”

Upon hearing this, delight surfaced on the waiter’s face and he declared, “Sir, I won’t disappoint you, and if you don’t leave in satisfaction, then you can break my legs to make a stew out of them.”

Yang Kai nodded and spoke, “I’ll take you at your word, if I am dissatisfied by any little thing, then I’ll fulfil your wish.”

The waiter’s face darkened and he could only say, “Then I’ll have to do my best!”

Saying so, he quickly left to arrange and handle this.

Yang Kai sat down next to the window and looked outside while waiting. He found this pretty amusing and he regained his spirits. He had been pretty despondent for the past few days and he still got pretty uneasy a while ago, yet all of those gloomy feelings were swept away now.
