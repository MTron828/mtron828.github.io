The rings Mo Xiao Qi handed to Duan Yuan Shan were filled with Pure Heart Jade. They were countless!

This made Duan Yuan Shan overjoyed.

“Miss, are these all from that mine?” Duan Yuan Shan asked after a moment of thought.

Mo Xiao Qi nodded. “I defeated a few Jiang Family cultivators in the mine and snatched their Space Rings. These are all they had.”

“This Duan will humbly accept Miss’ graciousness!” While speaking, Duan Yuan Shan immediately stood up and deeply bowed to Mo Xiao Qi.

Mo Xiao Qi hurriedly waved off and apologetically said, “City Lord Duan, don’t be so serious. Actually, these are nothing.”

Duan Yuan Shan shook his head and quickly responded, “In any case, my Maplewood City has noted down Miss’ graciousness. If we survive this catastrophe, Miss will be the honoured guest of my Maplewood City!”

The Pure Heart Jade was more or less useful to every cultivator. It was quite valuable. And this much Pure Heart Jade was a huge fortune.

Had it been any other ordinary cultivator, it was quite unlikely that they would offer these many Pure Heart even if they knew that Maplewood City was in danger. However, Mo Xiao Qi took them out without so much as batting her eyes.

Duan Yuan Shan was extremely grateful for this.

“All these Pure Heart Jade can be considered to have been bought by my Maplewood City’s City Lord’s Mansion. In the future, my City Lord’s Mansion will convert them into corresponding Source Crystals and pay you, Miss,” Duan Yuan Shan added.

“It’s really alright!” Mo Xiao Qi really had no idea what to say.

Yang Kai’s expression flickered as he stated, “City Lord Duan, I also have some Pure Heart Jade here. If they are not enough, just tell me!”

Duan Yuan Shan’s eyes lit up after hearing this. He broke into laughter, “After Brother Yang and Miss’ help, my Maplewood City has nothing to worry about! Please let this Duan thank Brother Yang for your generosity in advance. If they really fall short, I will come to Brother Yang. Well, this Duan would now like to distribute these Pure Heart Jade. I wonder if Brother Yang would like to go with this Duan to the city wall... to defend against the foreign enemies?”

Yang Kai didn’t answer immediately. Rather, he glanced around at the others before answering, “I can come but let me drop them off first.”

“But of course! This Duan will go first!” Duan Yuan Shan was in glee after hearing this. He had gotten another Dao Source Realm master’s help. It would be beneficial for the entire Maplewood City. He naturally thanked Yang Kai’s cardinal principles and righteousness.

After bidding goodbye, his figure immediately went out of the ship and flew straight toward the city wall.

After Duan Yuan Shan left, Yang Kai turned his gaze at Mo Xiao Qi and stated, “Xiao Qi, my cave mansion has been taken back by the City Lord’s Mansion. Can I leave them in your cave mansion?”

“Sure,” Mo Xiao Qi readily agreed.

Yang Kai nodded, and following her guidance, piloted the ship to her secluded mansion.

After a while, a crowd arrived at Mo Xiao Qi’s cave mansion.

Under Yang Kai’s arrangement, the Zhang Family and the waiters and two Alchemists of the Spirit Pill Plaza entered the cave mansion.

“Please rest here. If something changes in Maplewood City again, I will come to you in advance and take you out of here,” after saying this, Yang Kai looked at Zhang Ruo Xi and ordered, “Ruo Xi, take care of your Zhang Family.”

“Yes! Sir, please be careful!” Zhang Ruo Xi looked at Yang Kai with a worried look.

“Xiao Qi, do you have a secret room here?” asked Yang Kai.

“Yes, come with me.” Although Mo Xiao Qi didn’t know what Yang Kai wanted to do, she still promptly led the way.

“Brother Kang, you are coming with us as well!” Yang Kai shouted at Kang Si Ran.

Even though Kang Si Ran was suspicious, he followed after them without asking any questions.

The cave mansion rented by Mo Xiao Qi was the best in Maplewood City, whether it was in the density of the World Energy or the size of the cave mansion. The cave mansion Yang Kai had rented before was a far cry from this.

The cave mansion had five-six secret rooms for a retreat.

After arriving before the secret room, Yang Kai gave an eye signal to Mo Xiao Qi, who astutely withdrew.

“Brother Yang, why did you bring me here?” Kang Si Ran was at a loss. He had no idea why Yang Kai brought him to a secret room in this moment of crisis. [Shouldn’t I be coordinating with the cultivators outside to defend against the Demon Qi?]

“Brother Kang, take a look at this.” While speaking, Yang Kai threw him a jade bottle.

Kang Si Ran sceptically took it. Next, he opened its lid and flipped it upside down as a pill rolled down from the jade bottle. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The next moment, Kang Si Ran seemed to have been struck by lightning. His eyes immediately lit up as he suspiciously looked at the pill on his hand. There was a look of incredulity on his face. He studied the pill with widened eyes for a while. And when he had finally determined what it was, he couldn’t help but blurt out in shock, “A Dao Source Pill!?”

As the shopkeeper of the Spirit Pill Plaza, countless pills had been traded by his hands. So, Kang Si Ran was deeply knowledgeable about them. Although he had never seen the Dao Source Pill, how could he not tell what the Dao Source Pill looked like and how it smelled?

The pill in his hand was precisely the very Dao Source Pill from legends.

The only difference was that this Dao Source Pill had lines on it like the meridians of a human body. Delicate patterns that looked like they had been carved by Heaven and Earth itself dotted the pill.

“Dao Source Pill with Pill Veins?” Kang Si Ran’s voice became sharper and louder. His hands were trembling uncontrollably.

“I got this from the Yuan Furnace Mountain. As Brother Kang had expected, a Dao Source Pill refined by Gong Sun Mu himself was indeed left by him in his cave mansion. Unfortunately, too much time has passed. Only, this one was left. The others have been reduced to waste!” Yang Kai explained, looking regretful.

Of course, all of this was nonsense.

This Dao Source Pill with Pill Veins was refined by him personally before he broke through to the Dao Source Realm. After successfully refining it, he didn’t have the time to check his own handiwork as he was immediately absorbed in his advancement.

After having successfully advanced, he had the time to check it while he was waiting for Liu Yan near the Yuan Furnace Mountain.

At that time, he had refined six pills at once, five of which were ordinary Dao Source Pills. Only this one gave birth to Pill Veins!

Fortunately, there was this one. Otherwise, he would not be able to explain the origin of the Dao Source Pill.

After all, only a pill that had given birth to Pill Veins could withstand the erosion of time without losing its medicinal properties.

As such, he could tell Kang Si Ran that this Dao Source Pill came from the Yuan Furnace Mountain and was personally refined by Gong Sun Mu himself. It was within rhyme and reason.

“Brother Yang, this...” Although Kang Si Ran was excited and was unable to calm himself, he didn’t have the slightest bit of greed in his heart. Rather, he looked at Yang Kai and stated, gritting his teeth, “This thing is extremely expensive. This Kang can’t take it!”

Yang Kai chuckled, “Brother Kang, you are treating me like an outsider by saying this. If it weren’t for you, I would never have gone to Yuan Furnace Mountain. Not to mention, didn’t you and I discuss it before that if we find a Dao Source Pill inside, it will be yours and the rest of the things regarding Alchemy would belong to me? Let me put it this way, I didn’t just find this Dao Source Pill inside the Yuan Furnace Mountain, I got something useful as well. I even got to advance to the Dao Source Realm thanks to the opportunity inside!”

Yang Kai wasn’t lying. Had he not taken the Ten Thousand Medicinal Treasures Soup underground the Yuan Furnace Mountain, the Source Qi in his body would not have converted so quickly, and if his Source Qi had not been completely converted, he would not have been able to break through to the Dao Source Realm.

“Be that as it may, I didn’t help you at all. If this Dao Source Pill was auctioned, it would be worth tens of millions of Source Crystals, or even more. This Kang doesn’t deserve to receive such an expensive item!” Kang Si Ran kept shaking his head in refusal. He even put the Dao Source Pill back into the jade bottle with a flip of his hand and stuffed it into Yang Kai’s hands.

Even though his eyes were filled with unwillingness, his movements weren’t the least bit tardy. Even his voice was loud and clear. Obviously, he wasn’t being hypocritical but he genuinely thought so.

In the last auction fair, the Dao Source Fruit was auctioned for more than 10 million Source Crystals in the finale. Although a furnace of Dao Source Pill could be refined with a Dao Source Fruit and one could even get several pills if he or she was blessed by lady luck, it also had corresponding risks. The Alchemist might fail and all of it could be for nought.

And Yang Kai had taken out a Dao Source Pill with Pill Veins! Its effectiveness would be exceptional!

In terms of value, it was definitely several times more valuable than the Dao Source Fruit!

In other words, if a peak Third-Order Origin King took this Dao Source Pill, there was a 70% chance of him being promoted to the Dao Source Realm!

“Brother Kang, do you really not want it!?” Yang Kai looked at Kang Si Ran with a playful smile.

Kang Si Ran resolutely shook his head. But his eyes never left Yang Kai’s hand. Finally, he steeled his heart and turned his head away. If the eyes don’t see anything, the heart will not grieve.

“In that case...” Yang Kai spoke very slowly. Next, he opened the jade bottle and tossed the Dao Source Pill in his hand.

“What do you want to do?” Kang Si Ran vigilantly looked at Yang Kai.

“I want to eat it like a fried bean. This pill smells so good, it’s obviously very tasty,” while speaking, Yang Kai really tossed the pill in his hand. The Dao Source Pill immediately flew into the air. It made a parabolic arc as it flew toward his opened mouth.

“Stop it!” Kang Si Ran was struck with panic. He immediately reached out as the Dao Source Pill flew back into his hand before it could enter Yang Kai’s mouth. He lashed out, infuriated, “Damn you, damn you, Brother Yang! You are really wasting Heaven’s gift. It’s intolerable by Heaven and Earth!”

“You don’t want it anyway,” Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders with an indifferent look hanging on his face.

“Then, can’t you...” while speaking, Kang Si Ran sighed in resignation. “Forget it, since Brother Yang is treating me like this, if this Kang still acts all coy and shy, that would be really low. This Kang accepts this Dao Source Pill. This Kang will forever remember Brother Yang’s kindness. I will definitely repay you in the future. Brother Yang, please accept this Kang’s bow!”

Having said this, he straightened his clothes before he deeply bowed to Yang Kai with an earnest look on his face.

Yang Kai grinned meaningfully and nodded, accepting his bow straight-on, “That’s better.”

Suddenly, he turned serious and stated, “Brother Kang, you retreat in here and refine its medicinal efficacies. If my estimate is right, Maplewood City would not have any trouble hanging on for the next seven to eight days. These days will be enough for your advancement. I will be waiting outside for Brother Kang’s good news!”

“Either I will succeed or die trying! This Kang will live up to Brother Yang’s expectations!” Kang Si Ran quickly replied.
