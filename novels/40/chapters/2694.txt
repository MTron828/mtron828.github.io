“If you understand how great this Young Master is, let her go now, otherwise, I’ll remove your skull and use it as a toilet bowl later!” Yang Kai yelled with his teeth gritted, forcing his rampaging blood to calm down.

Tan Jun Hao shook his head lightly.

Seeing that he was protected by his Honoured Master, Wu Ming was not frightened anymore and he taunted coldly, “Little bastard, aren’t you very strong? Show me your strength once more!”

While speaking, he grabbed Chi Yue’s long locks and tugged backwards. Chi Yue let out a cry as her body was lifted slightly and her chest was pushed out.

Wu Ming grinned, his fingers gleaming as he circulated his Emperor Qi. Then, he slowly pointed his fingers at Chi Yue’s chest and stared at Yang Kai, “This is your mother-in-law, right? Let’s enjoy the scenery of your mother-in-law’s body together, shall we?”

When the words fell, he flicked his fingers downwards.

With a tearing sound, an opening on Chi Yue’s dress was slashed, revealing more than three fingers wide of snow-white skin, which was now flushed in faint crimson from anger and shame.

Yang Kai was Shan Qing Luo’s man, while she was Shan Qing Luo’s adoptive mother. Now, her bare skin was not just exposed to Wu Ming, but also to Yang Kai. Despite Chi Yue being a member of the Monster Race, she still could not stand being humiliated like this in front of her son-in-law.

Yang Kai silently narrowed his eyes.

Wu Ming started to look at Chi Yue’s body unscrupulously, but even though the clothes were torn, he still could not see the important part that remained covered.

He extended his hand excitedly, as if he wanted to strip the clothes and enjoy the most exquisite parts of her body.

“Enough!” Yang Kai shouted.

Wu Ming ignored him.

Yang Kai retorted, “If you dare to touch her again, both of you will never get anything you want today.”

Tan Jun Hao, who had been watching coldly, frowned and raised his hand.

Wu Ming immediately stopped his action with a disappointed face.

Chi Yue could not help letting out a sigh of relief. If Wu Ming really stripped off her clothes, she would be too embarrassed to face Yang Kai and Shan Qing Luo in the future. Although she was still in an awkward situation now, only some of her skin was shown at the moment, which was not too big a deal for a member of the Monster Race.

“Does Little Friend Yang understand this Old Master’s sincerity now?” Tan Jun Hao remained calm and composed while he turned to look at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai sneered, “It’s an eye-opener that an honourable Star Soul Palace Elder would handle things in such a disgraceful manner.”

Tan Jun Hao remarked, “Little friend doesn’t have to be sarcastic. A man of great ambition does not bother about trifles. You should understand this.”

“I only see two shameless dogs bullying a helpless woman. It’s laughable you still dare call yourselves men!”

Tan Jun Hao chuckled, “It’s fine. As long as you hand over the Dragon Island Token to this Old Master, everything can be discussed.”

While speaking, he stretched out his hand to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai clenched his teeth and snorted, pouring his Emperor Qi into the Dragon Island Token and tossing it to Tan Jun Hao.

At this point, he had no choice. If he did not compromise now, he was afraid that Chi Yue would be stripped naked in front of him. If that happened, how would he explain himself to Shan Qing Luo when he saw her again in the future?

He did not care much about a trivial Dragon Island Token anyway. If Hua Qing Si had not reminded him earlier, he would have totally forgotten about this thing. The reason why he refused to return it was because he wanted to save Chi Yue first.

The Dragon Island Token turned into a stream of light, wrapped with a potent piercing power, but Tan Jun Hao caught it easily with a flick of his wrist, rubbing it carefully as he nodded, “Yes, this is the token.”

Yang Kai continued, “I have returned the Dragon Island Token as you asked, are you going to release her now?”

Tan Jun Hao beamed, “There’s no hurry.”

Yang Kai immediately rebuked as he snorted, “Old dog, you’re going back on your word.”

Wu Ming laughed, “Honoured Master never said that he would release her after you returned the Dragon Island Token. Honoured Master only said that if you returned the token, everything could be discussed. We haven’t even started our discussion yet, so how could this be considered Honoured Master going back on his word?”

Seeing Yang Kai being forced to submit, Wu Ming was gleeful, as if he had taken his revenge.

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s face turned dreadfully ugly. His emotions were unstable as he slapped his own thigh with regret, feeling as if he had been scammed.

“Hahahahaha!” Wu Ming finally could not help laughing out loud. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Old dog, what else do you want? I have already returned the Dragon Island Token to you. Don’t force this Young Master anymore, otherwise I will fight with you until either the fish dies or the net gets torn,” Yang Kai gritted his teeth.

Tan Jun Hao replied, “This Old Master wants to ask a little friend for something, but don’t worry, if little friend can fulfil this Old Master’s wish, I will give her back to you immediately.”

“Out with it then,” Yang Kai spat.

Tan Jun Hao smiled lightly and started moving his lips to send a Divine Sense Message, “A bead. A small bead that is said to contain a sealed world!”

Sure enough, Sister Hua had exposed the existence of the Sealed World Bead, but from how Tan Jun Hao was acting, it seemed as if he did not want Wu Ming to know.

The Sealed World Bead was an extremely precious artifact, not to mention that a supreme treasure like the Immortal Tree was inside it. Even though they were Master and Disciple, it made sense that Tan Jun Hao did not intend to let Wu Ming know about the Immortal Tree, lest he covet it.

“I don’t understand what you’re saying!” Yang Kai kept a serious face.

Tan Jun Hao continued to transmit his voice, “My unfilial disciple reported all your secrets to this Old Master, little friend doesn’t need to hide it anymore. This Old Master has meticulously planned everything for this day. The Dragon Island Token is not my main aim; what this Old Master truly wants is that bead. This Old Master will be grateful as long as you can meet his request. If little friend has any needs in the future, this Old Master will definitely try to help you. After all, this Old Master is an Elder of Star Soul Palace, and there is nothing in the Southern Territory that this Old Master cannot settle.”

Yang Kai shook his head like a rattle, “I don’t have such a thing.”

Tan Jun Hao’s face darkened, “Since little friend refuses this Old Master’s kind gesture, then you will have to suffer the consequences.”

He had been polite since the beginning, but after Yang Kai repeatedly refused to hand over the Sealed World Bead, Tan Jun Hao showed signs of anger, which showed how attractive the Sealed World Bead was to him.

Wu Ming became suspicious when he saw Tan Jun Hao and Yang Kai constantly transmitting their voices to each other, wondering what his Honoured Master was unwilling to let him know about, feeling somewhat aggrieved.

Despite that, he dared not to show anything on his face. He could only bury his feelings in his heart while secretly plotting to find a chance to inquire about it after they were done dealing with Yang Kai.

Yang Kai replied helplessly, “I don’t have the thing that you ask from me, so how can I give it to you?”

Tan Jun Hao snorted coldly, then signaled Wu Ming with his eyes, and retorted, “Little Friend Yang is refusing this Old Master’s request. You can do whatever you want with this devilish woman.”

Wu Ming’s eyes lit up and thanked joyously, “Many thanks, Honoured Master!”

While speaking, he attempted to grab Chi Yue’s chest.

“Wait, wait!” Yang Kai hurriedly shouted.

Tan Jun Hao raised his hand and shook Wu Ming’s hand away, causing the latter to look annoyed but he still dared not resist.

“Little friend, have you reconsidered?” Tan Jun Hao looked at Yang Kai with scorching eyes.

Yang Kai scratched his cheek, and coughed slightly, “I seem to remember that there is such a thing.”

Tan Jun Hao’s eyes brightened and he continued eagerly, “Since you remember now, hand it over to this Old Master.” If he could get the Sealed World Bead and the Immortal Tree inside it, the Dragon Island Token wouldn’t even matter to him anymore.

It was rumoured that after refining the Immortal Tree, one could achieve an immortal and indestructible body, so doing so would surely allow him to break through to the Great Emperor Realm.

Yang Kai snorted, “But this Young Master doesn’t trust your credibility.”

Tan Jun Hao immediately replied, “You may rest assured that this Old Master will let you take back this devilish woman as long as you give me that thing.”

“Really?” Yang Kai questioned with a frown.

Tan Jun Hao raised his hand, “If there is any violation, may this Old Master be struck by lightning and split into two halves.”

Yang Kai curled his lip, “If oaths were useful, why would we even bother cultivating? But… since you are an Elder of Star Soul Palace, this Young Master will trust you once more!”

Tan Jun Hao twinkled, “Little Friend Yang is a straightforward person, this Old Master will not disappoint you.”

Yang Kai sighed and flipped his hand over, summoning a longan-sized bead into his palm. This bead looked ordinary at first glance, but a faint wave of Space Principles fluctuated from it.

Tan Jun Hao widened his eyes and ogled the Sealed World Bead, examining it carefully with his Divine Sense.

With his cultivation and insight, he naturally noticed the specialty of the bead at a glance, and immediately understood that it must be the so-called Sealed World Bead. By itself, it was just a special storage artifact, but what was more important were the things inside.

Not just anyone could refine this special storage artifact, but Tan Jun Hao believed that it should be no problem for him to do so and withdraw the Immortal Tree with his strength.

Wu Ming was watching too and frowned, having no idea why such a bead was worth his Honoured Master’s attention, even more so than the Dragon Island Token.

He vaguely felt that the true aim of his Honoured Master this time was not the Dragon Island Token, but this small bead.

“This Young Master obtained this many years ago. It was a gift from a friend. Now, this Young Master is handing it over to Elder Tan, hoping that Elder Tan can take good care of it.” Yang Kai seemed to have accepted his fate and looked at the Sealed World Bead on his hand longingly, reluctant to let it go. Even the way he addressed Tan Jun Hao changed.

Tan Jun Hao replied, “Don’t worry, this Old Master will conceal this treasure cautiously. From now on, little friend will be this Old Master’s friend.”

Yang Kai clenched his fist and pressed on, “Before this, I have one more request.”

Tan Jun Hao frowned, “What is it?”

Yang Kai revealed, “I want Hua Qing Si to be freed from her discipleship under Elder Tan.”

Wu Ming snorted, “In your dreams. That bitch did so many things that disrespected our Honoured Master. It’s already signalledmercy that we didn’t kill her on the spot, yet now you want to ask for her freedom?”

Yang Kai stared at him coldly, “Can you make the decision for Elder Tan?”

Wu Ming’s face immediately changed and he cupped his fists towards Tan Jun Hao, “Honoured Master, this Disciple did not have such intentions.”

Tan Jun Hao waved his hand, “This Old Master understands.”

In fact, Yan Jun Hao actually felt somewhat relieved. He was more worried that Yang Kai wouldn’t continue trying to bargain, as that would truly be suspicious. After having a brief communication with Yang Kai, Tan Jun Hao could see that Yang Kai was a person who valued relationships greatly. If this wasn’t the case, he would not have been able to force Yang Kai to surrender without a fight by just holding Chi Yue as a hostage, even getting him to obediently hand over the Dragon Island Token and Sealed World Bead.

This request seemed to be reasonable to Tan Jun Hao. According to Yang Kai’s behaviour and attitude, it made sense for him to put forward such a request.

After some brief thought, he nodded in agreement, “This Old Master approves your request. From now on, Hua Qing Si is no longer this Old Master’s Disciple and has nothing to do with this Old Master.”
