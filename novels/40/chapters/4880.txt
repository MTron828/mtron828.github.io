In the void, Yang Kai quietly stared at Fan Xiu Qi for a while before asking, “Do you have any last words?”

Fan Xiu Qi’s face was filled with dread and panic. He shook his head vigorously, begging Yang Kai, “Sir, save me!”

He had regained his rationality after Yang Kai had completely expelled the Black Ink Strength from his body, but his energy had become extremely unstable. The World Strength in his Small Universe was uncontrollably leaking out, showing obvious signs of collapsing.

This was the hidden danger of the Black Ink Strength.

When Fan Xiu Qi had broken through to the Open Heaven Realm, he had been a Third-Order, and his limit was the Fifth-Order, but under the influence of the Black Ink Strength, he had broken through to the Sixth-Order, which was nothing short of a miracle.

However, such a miracle came at a price.

As a Black Ink Disciple, Fan Xiu Qi could still control his Sixth-Order strength, but without the support of the Black Ink Strength after it was expelled, his Small Universe could no longer handle his Sixth-Order cultivation; it had exceeded the limit he could bear.

This ultimately caused his Small Universe to become unstable and it was now on the verge of collapsing.

In short, he could not control his Sixth-Order strength.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head in response, “Forgive me. There’s nothing I can do.”

A look of despair appeared on Fan Xiu Qi’s face as the World Force fluctuations around his body became even more unstable. He knew in his heart that there was no way he could escape this calamity today, so he couldn’t help but look up and roar toward the Heavens in grief and indignation.

As his roar resounded across the void, his Small Universe collapsed and his World Force dissipated, resulting in a severe backlash. The next moment, Fan Xiu Qi’s entire body exploded into a bloody mist.

Yang Kai lightly sighed before returning to the ship.

Luan Bai Feng must have guessed everything as she gave Yang Kai a questioning look when she saw him return.

Yang Kai shook his head in response, “He died.”

Luan Bai Feng was momentarily speechless.

“How many others?” Yang Kai asked.

Luan Bai Feng knew what he was asking. She thought for a moment before replying, “Not many, about 20 in total.”

“Find them all,” Yang Kai ordered.

Luan Bai Feng nodded before turning around and leaving to find the 20 or so subordinates who had broken through their Open Heaven Realm limit under the influence of the Black Ink Strength and set them aside.

During the next few days, Yang Kai was completely focused, not relaxing for even a moment. He kept expelling the Black Ink Strength from the Black Ink Disciples, one by one. Furthermore, every time he purified a person, Yang Kai would carefully examine their Small Universe to make sure there were no problems.

Finally, when only the 20 or so people who had been set aside were left, Yang Kai found himself in a dilemma. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Having seen Fan Xiu Qi’s fate, Yang Kai didn’t need to imagine what would happen to these people after their Black Ink Strength was dispelled, but he had no choice but to do so. They had been contaminated by the Black Ink Strength and had been reduced to Black Ink Disciples. If he allowed them to do as they pleased, they would be lurking peril for this vast universe.

After thinking about it for a while, Yang Kai decided to ask Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan’s help.

These two might have some way.

Currently, each of them had 16 Seventh and Eighth-Order Generals under their command and were launching fierce attacks against each other every day. Yang Kai was able to easily find Big Brother Huang, who was in charge of overseeing his rear forces on a certain battlefield.

The battle in front of them was quite intense, but Big Brother Huang didn’t seem to be worried at all, not in the slightest. In the past, they had to command the Small Stone Race to do everything by themselves; but now, with the help of the Masters from the Cave Heavens and Paradises, things were much easier.

Seeing Yang Kai arrive, Big Brother Huang only gave him a sideways glance before carefully listening to the report of a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm General. He then nodded his head and issued orders, displaying the dignity of a commander.

When Big Brother Huang was done, just when Yang Kai was about to speak, he interrupted him, “We can’t save them, just kill them all, it’ll save you time and trouble.”

Yang Kai had a lot of things he wished to say, but was unable to speak, which made him very uncomfortable.

He then went to look for Big Sister Lan, but received the exact same answer.

Yang Kai knew these two weren’t just giving him a perfunctory answer. If there was really some kind of method they could try, they wouldn’t hide it from him as doing so would be beneath them. If even they couldn’t do anything about it, then there really was nothing to be done.

Nonetheless, Yang Kai still didn’t give up. He returned to the ship and started dispersing the Black Ink Strength in the bodies of the 20 or so people.

But the result was extremely tragic.

Just like what happened to Fan Xiu Qi, after dispersing the Black Ink Strength, all of these people died because of the collapse of their Small Universe. Not a single one escaped this tragic fate.

Luan Bai Feng and the others all felt a sense of sadness while also secretly rejoicing that when they were immersed in the Black Ink Strength, they had not broken through their limits; otherwise, they would have suffered the same fate.

The thousands of Black Ink Disciples had already regained their senses. As every one of them was personally rescued by Yang Kai, they were naturally extremely grateful to him.

Yang Kai had consumed a lot of Yellow and Blue Crystals in this time, but compared to the harvest he had obtained here, it was nothing; after all, the cultivation of these Black Ink Disciples wasn’t high.

Purifying a Third-Order Black Ink Disciple only required a Third-Order Yellow Crystal and a Third-Order Blue Crystal.

Yang Kai’s consumption could be considered almost negligible as a result.

Having spent several months in the Chaotic Dead Territory, Yang Kai started to become concerned about the situation in Black Territory. He still didn’t know what to do with the Black Ink Clansman, so he immediately went to say his goodbyes to Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan.

“You’re leaving just like that?” Big Sister Lan looked at him in surprise.

Yang Kai nodded his affirmation, “There are still some things I need to take care of outside, so I can’t stay here for too long. I’ll come visit you two when I have time in the future.”

Big Sister Lan nodded and stated, “Then go. It doesn’t look like you’ll have a short life, so just come back when you’re free.”

Liu Mu, who was standing behind Big Brother Huang, shot Yang Kai a fierce glare at that moment.

Yang Kai understood what that glare meant and gave him a calm gaze in return before stating, “Before leaving, this Little Brother has a presumptuous request.”

“What is it?” Big Brother Huang asked.

Yang Kai cupped his fist and requested, “This Little Brother earnestly requests Big Brother and Big Sister to leave the mountain and destroy the imprisoned Black Ink Clansman in Black Territory!”

This was also something Yang Kai had discussed with Liu Mu and Da Yi before. If he could ask the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer to come out of their seclusion, the Black Ink Clansman in Black Territory would no longer be a problem.

Because of this, Liu Mu and Da Yi did not nag about the Black Ink Clan to Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan over the past few months because they wanted to lay the groundwork for Yang Kai’s request.

Unfortunately, Big Brother Huang shook his head in refusal after hearing Yang Kai’s request, directly stating, “We can’t.”

Big Sister Lan also refused, “It’s impossible.”

Yang Kai looked confused and couldn’t help asking, “Why?”

“If we can’t do it, we can’t do it. There’s no need to ask why,” Big Brother Huang impatiently stated.

Big Sister Lan, on the other hand, was the one to explain, “The outside world cannot accommodate our existence. If we really leave this place, we will only bring destruction wherever we go. Are you sure you can bear this result?”

Yang Kai was stunned. Suddenly, he recalled the first time he had come to the Chaotic Dead Territory. At that time, he had witnessed the collision between the two behemoths of light. Their clash had caused the entire Chaotic Dead Territory to tremble.

Although Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan in front of him looked like little children, these weren’t their true forms.

Their true forms were avatars of destruction.

The Chaotic Dead Territory had nothing inside of it, so they could stay here without worry. However, if their true bodies left the Chaotic Dead Territory and traveled to the outside world, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Yang Kai immediately realized that he had been too naive. He had considered the possibility that Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan would refuse, but he had never considered the possibility that their true bodies would be unable to leave the Chaotic Dead territory.

“However…” Big Sister Lan tapped her lips thoughtfully, “If you can lure that Black Ink Clansman here, we can still help you kill him!”

Yang Kai looked at Liu Mu and Da Yi.

Liu Mu shook his head in response, “That’s too dangerous!”

The Black Ink Clansman was imprisoned in the central part of Black Territory, where countless ore stars and Spirit Arrays formed a Super Array to suppress it. If they really wanted to lure them to the Chaotic Dead Territory, they would have to first breach the Super Array and then lure them here, crossing numerous Great Territories in the process.

Such a situation would be very hard to control. The Black Ink Strength was so treacherous and difficult to deal with, and wherever the Black Ink Clansman passed, the surrounding area would be filled with danger, and countless people would die.

“Then there’s nothing we can do about it.” Big Sister Lan shrugged, wearing a helpless look on her face.

“It’s fine, the Cave Heavens and Paradises have robust and long heritages, I don’t believe they can’t deal with a single Black Ink Clansman!” Liu Mu comforted Yang Kai.

Big Brother Huang glanced at Yang Kai and stated, “With the power in your hands, it shouldn’t be a problem to deal with the Black Ink Clan!”

Yang Kai immediately came to a realization and cupped his fist in gratitude, “Many thanks, Big Brother.”

Suddenly, he was struck with a thought and asked, “Can the two of you also leave a mark on Senior Liu Mu and Senior Da Yi? This way, they can also use your strength to deal with the Black Ink Clan.”

Liu Mu immediately winked at Yang Kai with an approving and even grateful look on his face.

Although he had no idea what Yang Kai was talking about, it was definitely not a bad thing.

Big Brother Huang, however, refused, “You are practically a Divine Spirit, so you have some connection with us, so you can use our strength, but they aren’t, so they can’t. Even if we leave a mark on them, they won’t be able to use it.”

Yang Kai didn’t know there was such a relationship between them, so he had no choice but to give up on this.

Yang Kai thus made up his mind to take a trip to the Ancestral Land and bring Su Yan and the others with him so that Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan could leave their marks on them.

While speaking, Big Brother Huang suddenly realized something and turned to look at Liu Mu, “You’re leaving too?”

Liu Mu took a step forward and cupped his fist, “We have heavy responsibilities weighing on our shoulders, so we cannot stay here for long.”

Big Brother Huang was dumbfounded as he muttered, “Then what should we do?”

Working with Liu Mu and the others during this period of time had saved him and Big Sister Lan a lot of trouble. If all of their subordinates were to leave, they would be back to square one.

Big Sister Lan also bluntly commanded, “You can’t leave. The dead can leave, but the living must stay!”

Liu Mu and Da Yi immediately broke out into a cold sweat. They quickly looked at Yang Kai for help. If they were really trapped here, they would be finished.

Yang Kai also felt a headache coming on. These two were not to be trifled with, and although they had always been calm and approachable, if he really angered them, he had no idea what would happen.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s eyes flickered with an intelligent gleam before he asked, “Please wait a moment!”

Saying so, his figure flickered and disappeared.
