After asking this, Yang Kai suddenly recalled that at the Imperial Palace in Human Imperial City, Zhu Qing had shown her true form. It was a three-hundred-metre long Red Dragon. When Zhu Lie had shown his true form in Azure Sun Temple, he seemed smaller than Zhu Qin, only two hundred metres in length.

Similar to his situation, the purity of a Dragon’s bloodline would be determined from the size of its true form.

Like this, Zhu Qing’s bloodline was indeed a grade stronger than Zhu Lie’s. Zhu Lie saying she was in the Ninth-Order wasn’t without basis.

But Yang Kai found a point puzzling, “So what if she is a Ninth-Order now, isn’t that a good thing? Doesn’t the Dragon Clan pursue the purity of their bloodline? Qing’er, why is your face red?”

“Impossible, impossible, how is it possible?” Zhu Lie muttered, his brows furrowed deeply, unable to understand how Zhu Qing was promoted to Ninth-Order in this short period of time. He was indignant, and felt that the Heavens were unfair. Why couldn’t benefits like these fall on his lap instead?

He suddenly turned towards Yang Kai and said coldly, “What did you call her just now?”

His surprise over Zhu Qing’s bloodline promotion caused him to miss what Yang Kai called his Elder Sister at first, and it was only now that he felt something was amiss. How could such an intimate address be called out by a mere human? It was simply blasphemy, an insult to the Dragon Clan! What was worse was that Zhu Qing didn’t refute!

He suddenly realized something and his tone became even icier, laced with murderous intent, “What did you call me earlier?”

Yang Kai walked to Zhu Qing’s side, and under Zhu Lie’s incredulous gaze, put his hand on Zhu Qing’s shoulder, grinning as he commented, “You’re Qing’er’s younger brother, so naturally I would call you little Brother-in-law.”

Zhu Qing squirmed, but she didn’t pull off Yang Kai’s evil hand, simply allowing him to do as he pleased.

Zhu Lie’s pupils shrank. He wasn’t a fool, so he could tell that Zhu Qing didn’t reject Yang Kai’s intimate behaviour and even welcomed it. Added with how Yang Kai addressed the siblings, a daring thought popped into his head.

His face paled like it was covered in a layer of frost. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

To the side, Li Jiao’s mouth was open wide enough to fit a melon into. He looked at Yang Kai with shock and admiration as he thought to himself, [He actually got together with a Dragon Girl!?]

Li Jiao wondered if he was dreaming. If it was true, wouldn’t Palace Master Yang be the son-in-law of Dragon Island? That was nothing short of an extraordinary feat.

He wanted to prostrate to Yang Kai in deep admiration. Moments before, there were still complaints in his heart, but they were nowhere to be found now. Compared to his matters, hooking up with a Dragon Girl was a heinous crime against Dragon Island. Since Yang Kai had the guts to do even this, what would he not dare to do?

“The both of you… Are you serious?” Zhu Lie’s eyes seemed to burn with flames as he looked at Zhu Qing then Yang Kai, asking in a heavy voice.

Feeling Zhu Lie’s murderous intent, Yang Kai furrowed his brows and said, displeased, “Do I look like I’m joking with you?”

“I must hear your answer!” Zhu Lie ignored him, his gaze fixing on Zhu Qing.

“Is this how you talk to your Elder Sister?” Yang Kai’s face sank as he said darkly, “Don’t think I won’t hit you just because you’re my little Brother-in-law. If you continue being discourteous to your seniors, don’t blame me if I beat you until even your Elder Sister won’t recognize you.”

Veins bulged on Zhu Lie’s neck as murderous intent spread out and he glared at Yang Kai and snarled, “I’d like nothing more!”

“I just said a few words and you’re already like this. Today I’ll give my little Brother-in-law a lesson on showing proper respect!” Yang Kai rolled up his sleeves and walked forward, but Zhu Qing grabbed him.

“What are you stopping me for?” Yang Kai said with an unhappy face, “Your brother has no manners, he should be taught properly. Don’t worry, I won’t kill him, I only plan to break a few bones so he drills into his head how to speak to you.”

Zhu Qing shook her head softly before turning to Zhu Lie, “You saw everything and heard everything, there is nothing more for me to say.”

Zhu Lie trembled and staggered back a few steps. Yang Kai’s words and actions were all hints, and he himself had already guessed it, but for Zhu Qing to confirm it herself, he still found it hard to accept.

A dignified member of the Dragon Clan, a Ninth-Order Red Dragon who stood above all living creatures, actually gave herself to a human!

This was a humiliation, a humiliation to Dragon Island! It was a humiliation to the entire Dragon Clan!

“Zhu Qing, you disappoint me,” Zhu Lie shook his head, his face and tone full of disappointment, “How could you be so foolish?”

Yang Kai snorted coldly, “You make it sound as if we did something wrong. Zhu Lie, this Brother-in-law is finding you more and more displeasing to the eye.”

“Likewise!” Zhu Lie glared coldly at Yang Kai, and as their eyes met, sparks seemed to fly in all directions. It looked like a fight could break out at any moment.

Zhu Qing gave a small smile, “I don’t think I’m foolish, on the contrary, I think this is the greatest happiness of my life.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s dissatisfaction towards Zhu Lie dissipated in a puff of rose-coloured smoke. He was filled with an indescribable sense of satisfaction as he laughed like a fool.

Zhu Lie said bitterly, “Women, no matter how strong they are, in the end, they’re all fools. You know what will happen if you do this, don’t you?”

Zhu Qing’s face paled slightly as she gently pursed her red lips and nodded.

“Then why did you do it!?” Zhu Lie roared hysterically, hating that iron couldn’t become steel.

Zhu Qing didn’t answer and just lowered her head to say, “If I was given a chance to choose again, I would still do so.”

“Madness, utter madness!” Zhu Lie shook his head. As he looked back and forth between Zhu Qing and Yang Kai, his expression grew complex.

After a while, he finally said quietly, “You rose to become a Ninth-Order Red Dragon because of him, right? So that’s how it is, I thought it was an opportunity for you, but unexpectedly… heh.”

Zhu Qing blushed, silently confirming Zhu Lie’s guess.

Yang Kai looked over at Zhu Qing strangely and asked, “What does your breakthrough to the Ninth-Order have to do with me?” He didn’t even know when Zhu Qing had been promoted to the Ninth-Order.

“Stop asking,” Zhu Qing’s face was bashful.

Looking at her appearance, Yang Kai suddenly recalled the crazy days in the Sealed World Bead. At that time, he vaguely noticed a change in Zhu Qing’s aura but he didn’t think too deeply about it. In retrospect, her bloodline had probably made a breakthrough at that time.

Then…

Yang Kai quietly asked via sound Divine Sense, “Qing’er, is it because of my Yang Qi… That…”

Zhu Qing pinched his arm, annoyed, “What Yang Qi?”

Yang Kai laughed dryly, winking at her as he continued speaking through Divine Sense, “You know, it’s that…”

Zhu Qing nodded, “You possess the Ancestral Dragon Source, and with that bloodline… The nourishment of its essence is a great help to Dragons like me.”

She never had such an explicit conversation with a man before, so her face couldn’t help but heat up.

“You really broke through to the Ninth-Order because of me?” Yang Kai wouldn’t stop asking.

“En,” Zhu Qing’s face became even hotter.

“Doesn’t that mean if the two of us work harder in the future…” The gears in Yang Kai’s head turned and came to a conclusion, “Your bloodline could be promoted to an even higher degree?”

“Don’t talk about it anymore…” Zhu Qing bit her red lips; she was really too embarrassed to continue this conversation with Yang Kai.

“I understand, I understand now!” Yang Kai chuckled.

Zhi Lie watched them from the side with cold eyes. Seeing them flirt like this made him look like a fool and he hated that he couldn’t just gouge his eyes out. Zhu Qing’s thoughts were incomprehensible to him. How could she do something so stupid?

Sneering, he said, “Be happy while it lasts, you’ll both come to regret it sooner or later.”

“I just discovered you really are unpleasant,” Yang Kai glanced coldly at Zhu Lie, “If you weren’t my little Brother-in-law, I would have taught you a lesson by now.”

Zhu Lie gritted his teeth, “You think I like being your Brother-in-law? Don’t think too highly of yourself!”

Yang Kai grew angry, “If I don’t teach you a lesson today, I won’t be surnamed Yang! Qing’er, step aside.”

Saying this, he pushed Zhu Qing to the side and with a low murmur, used the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique.

His body expanded rapidly and turned into a giant behemoth as he smashed a giant fist down on Zhu Lie.

Affected by the bloodline suppression, Zhu Lie was unable to use more than forty percent of his cultivation. He was secretly alarmed, the last time he fought Yang Kai, the other hadn’t been nearly this tall or suppressive. This time though, the Ancestral Dragon Source seemed to be giving off even more power, making it impossible for Zhu Lie to fight back.

With a crash, Zhu Lie was sent flying and light flashed wildly on his body.

Yang Kai chased after him, and before Zhu Lie could regain his footing, a thunderous attack came aiming at his face, followed by the sound of things breaking. Zhu Lie was beaten like a sandbag.

“Stop!” Zhu Qing stomped her foot anxiously. One was her man while the other was her younger brother, why couldn’t they get along? They acted like enemies that moment they met, and she was stuck in the middle of a difficult situation.

“No need to worry, I’m only educating him, he won’t die!” Yang Kai replied from afar, but his actions were truly quite ruthless. Regardless, an Eighth-Order Red Dragon was extremely tough and durable, so a little harshness wasn’t going to matter.

The situation was extremely one-sided, and Li Jiao was frightened stiff as he watched. However, his admiration for Yang Kai increased a lot as well.

Forget about getting together with a Dragon Girl, this High Heaven Palace Master actually pummeled his little Brother-in-law Dragon like this. From the past to the present, Palace Master Yang was surely the first to accomplish this. Though, even if Palace Master Yang caused disastrous trouble, he wouldn’t have any self-awareness at all.

“Don’t hide behind the bloodline suppression, do you dare to face me in a real battle of strength?!” Zhu Lie clenched his fists and roared. Although his injuries weren’t heavy, he had lost all face. He was filled with fury but had nowhere to vent it other than with his words.

“You said the same thing last time, don’t you remember how that ended? What a stupid brat!” Yang Kai snorted and continued raining down kicks and punches on him.
