Chapter 1668, Return To Shadowed Star

The black Origin King Grade Starship sailed through the vast Star Field without much need for human intervention, moving quickly towards a certain destination.

Inside the Starship, only a few cultivators were stationed to monitor the surrounding environment.

Yang Kai himself was inside the Sealed World Bead.

This was a homeward journey.

Shadowed Star would be the new home of all those from Tong Xuan Realm.

It had been a year since Yang Kai departed from Scarlet Wave Star, and since then, the Starship had sailed safely and smoothly according to the Star Chart drawn by Yang Kai.

The occasional minor problems that came up were quickly taken care of by a volley of Crystal Cannon fire, allowing the Starship to proceed unimpeded.

The tyrannical power of the Origin King Grade Starship was not something many could afford to challenge.

Inside the Sealed World Bead, Yang Kai and Xia Ning Chang were constantly refining pills, spending massive quantities of resources to improve the cultivation of those from Tong Xuan Realm.

The overall strength of the Three Clans had now soared with Saints everywhere. As for the top masters of the Three Clans, many had reached the Second or Third-Order Saint King Realm, their strength having risen greatly.

Cultivation was a process of accumulation. Tong Xuan Realm was different from Shadowed Star. The former had insufficient World Energy, so it severely limited the development of cultivators while the latter actually suppressed cultivators from reaching peak heights.

Now inside the Small Sealed World, with rich aura and abundant cultivation resources, the cultivators from Tong Xuan Realm were able to develop and improve their strength at astonishing speed.

Yang Xiu Zhu and the other Origin Realm masters also spent much time teaching those from Tong Xuan Realm the mysteries of cultivation, so it was no surprise that the latter group progressed quickly.

The atmosphere inside the Sealed World Bead was jubilant as every day someone would break through to the next realm.

Yang Kai gave special treatment to his closest relatives.

All people had selfish desires, and Yang Kai was no exception

His parents, Grand Master, Ancestral Founder, Martial Uncles and Aunt, Old Demon and others were all given Heaven-defying pills that Yang Kai refined personally, allowing them to transform their physiques, dredge their meridians, and thoroughly enhance their potential and aptitude.

Inside a certain loft, at a window on the second floor, a beautiful figure stood enjoying the breeze blowing through her hair, staring out across a nearby square, her eyes fixed on a brave and heroic-looking young man, a touch of gentleness and nostalgia across her face.

“Elder Sister Qiu.” Suddenly, a shout came from behind her and Qiu Yi Meng retracted her gaze, turned her head around, and saw a pair of twin sisters arriving together. Naturally, it was Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er.

“You’ve come?” Qiu Yi Meng smiled slightly, bringing her thoughts to the present and motioning, “Have a seat!”

Hu Jiao’er glanced at her thoughtfully before turning her eyes to the window where she noticed a bustling figure in the square, heaving a sigh as she muttered, “It seems that the gap is only getting wider and wider between us. I don’t know if it will ever be possible for us to catch up to him in this lifetime.”

“En, the more I cultivate, the farther I feel from him,” Hu Mei’er’s expression also dampened.

Qiu Yi Meng smiled at them and said, “Why are you two sisters so discouraged? At least your cultivation pace is shockingly quick compared to your Elder Sister here. The two of you have reached the Second-Order Saint King Realm while I just entered the Saint King Realm.”

“Even so, I heard that he has already reached the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm,” Hu Mei’er said sadly. “Now, those who can stand next to him are only Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang. I really wonder how they cultivated, all of them actually reached the Origin Returning Realm already. A few days ago, Xia Ning Chang also seems to have broken through to the Second-Order Origin Realm. It’s simply maddening to think about it.”

“They have their own opportunities. We just need to work harder ourselves. Don’t try to catch up to him, just strive to not be left too far behind,” Qiu Yi Meng persuaded.

“Elder Sister Qiu’s determination and resolve are inspiring,” Hu Jiao’er was a little moved as she looked at Qiu Yi Meng admiringly.

Qiu Yi Meng smiled and said, “Since we chose to leave Tong Xuan Realm with him, we should have at least this much heart. If we could not withstand this kind of desperation, we should have just remained on Tong Xuan Realm where we would still be considered peak level masters. Isn’t that what you thought as well, two little sisters?”

Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er looked at each other and nodded solemnly.

“Good, enough about this topic. Come with me, it’s time for the youths from the Three Clans to compare notes. Only by competing constantly can we really mature,” Qiu Yi Meng got up and motioned to the two sisters.

Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er quickly followed.

.....

The days in the Sealed World Bead were calm and steady, allowing time to flow by freely and before anyone knew it, another year had passed.

One day, Yang Kai was cultivating together with Su Yan, their palms pressed against each other’s, their Saint Qi circulating between them.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes as if sensing something.

“What happened?” Su Yan also opened her eyes and asked curiously.

“It seems we’ve arrived,” Yang Kai grinned.

“We’ve finally arrived?” Su Yan was also quite pleased, “The journey was quite long.”

“En, Shadowed Star is very remote. If it were not for this Origin King Grade Starship, we wouldn’t have been able to reach this place. Come with me to have a look.”

“Good, call Ning Chang too.”

After meeting up with Xia Ning Chang, the trio moved out to the Starship.

Immediately, a disciple from High Heaven Sect came forward to report, “Sect Master, Shadowed Star is directly in front of us. We’re finally home.”

His expression was very excited.

Unlike those from Tong Xuan Realm, this disciple was originally a member of the Hai Ke Family, a native of Shadowed Star. He had come out with Yang Kai for eight years now, so he missed his hometown.

“Please give the order, Sect Master!” The disciple of High Heaven Sect respectfully bowed.

“En, bring us down.”

“Yes!”

The next moment, the Starship sailed towards the massive Cultivation Star and in just over a quarter of an hour, it entered the atmosphere, revealing the charming scenery below.

Yang Kai did not order the Starship to continue forward and instead took Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang out before putting the Starship into the Sealed World Bead and using his Star Shuttle to finish their descent.

The Origin King Grade Starship was a bit too noticeable and Yang Kai was not willing to draw too much attention to himself at this moment.

Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang breathed Shadowed Star’s air for the first time and immediately felt the rich World Energy surrounding them, both wearing expressions of pleasant surprise as they inhaled gently.

“Junior Brother, what city is down below? It’s so big,” Xia Ning Chang pointed to a city nearby and asked.

“Well... I actually don’t know,” Yang Kai scratched his head awkwardly. Although he had spent many years on Shadowed Star now, Shadowed Star itself was simply too big so he could not recognize every city at a glance.

Xia Ning Chang smiled seeing this and no longer embarrassed Yang Kai.

“Oh...” Yang Kai’s expression suddenly changed, however, and after carefully examining the outline of the city below, he laughed, “Never mind, I do know where we are.”

“Where?”

“This is Heavenly Fate City!” Yang Kai pointed down, “Look over there, do you see that small mountain range? When I first arrived on Shadowed Star, this is where I settled down, Dragon Cave Mountain. Later, after being besieged by many people and engaging in a great battle, Dragon Cave Mountain was destroyed, and we moved to the current High Heaven Sect.”

Turning towards the direction Yang Kai pointed, Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang saw a small, dilapidated mountain range.

Perhaps because of the relationship this place shared with Yang Kai, the two women looked at the mountain range with cordial eyes.

“It seems you share some fate with this place,” Su Yan said with a little emotion.

When Yang Kai first came to Shadowed Star, this was where he arrived and settled, and now that he had returned after a long journey, this was the first place he came back to. It was almost serendipitous.

“There must indeed be some fate at work here. Good, let’s go down, I know the City Lord of Heavenly Fate City quite well, so we should be able to borrow their Space Array without any trouble,” Yang Kai waved his hand and flew down.

The City Lord of Heavenly Fate City was Fei Zhi Tu. If it had not been for his cultivation having fallen after suffering a serious wound, he would have followed Yang Kai to leave Shadowed Star like Qian Tong.

After so many years, Yang Kai wondered whether Fei Zhi Tu’s cultivation had recovered.

When Yang Kai was still weak, Fei Zhi Tu had taken good care of him, so Yang Kai naturally felt grateful to him.

Suddenly, a violent energy fluctuation erupted from nearby.

“Junior Brother, someone is fighting,” Su Yan noticed and pointed to a certain direction.

Yang Kai turned his head and looked over, only to reveal a look of shock in the next instant as he froze in place with a stunned expression on his face.

“How could it be them?”

Although they were separated by a great distance, with the strength of Yang Kai’s current Divine Sense, he was easily able to tell the identity the parties which were fighting.

It was Shadow Moon Hall’s top disciples Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er.

These two were the rising stars of Shadow Moon Hall, famous figures who were well-known throughout Shadowed Star. Yang Kai had not seen them for many years but he could tell that their cultivation had been progressing quite rapidly. Together, the two of them were able to exert power far beyond that of ordinary First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators.

However, their opponents were even stronger. There were more than a dozen Origin Returning Realm masters engaging them, with a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm powerhouse taking the lead. Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er were currently surrounded and had no chance of escape.

But how was this possible? Yang Kai was extremely puzzled.

They were currently right next to Heavenly Fate City, which was a city under the direct jurisdiction of Shadow Moon Hall. Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er were the future pillars of Shadow Moon Hall, with the former being the disciple of the Hall Master and the latter the disciple of its Great Elder, Qian Tong. Both of them possessed extraordinary status.

Who would dare to attack them within the territory of Shadow Moon Hall?

Yang Kai instinctively realized something was terribly wrong, as if something big had happened to Shadowed Star during the years he had left.

“You know them, Junior Brother?” Su Yan asked.

“En, let’s go take a look,” Yang Kai calmly led Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang towards the direction of the battle.

A few hundred kilometres away, Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er were engaged in a bloody battle. Their opponents were five Origin Returning Realm masters.

Even if Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er possessed extraordinary combat strength for their realm, they were still being suppressed heavily because they were outnumbered and outmatched. Moreover, it seemed they have experienced many battles recently, causing their Saint Qi auras to be somewhat weak. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

If not for their opponents seemingly worrying about the moon-shaped artifact floating above Wei Gu Chang’s head, they would already have rushed forward and killed them.

This moon-shaped artifact was being driven by Wei Gu Chang with some special method, exuding a soft light that flexibly floated about the battlefield, protecting Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er’s lives at critical moments several times.
