This mocking, however, was mainly to buy Yang Kai some time. He had consumed too much of his Spiritual Energy controlling the Embodiment to release a punch from the Sealed World Bead, which was still causing him a sharp headache. Fortunately, the Soul Warming Lotus was displaying its effect, sending a cool sensation through his Knowledge Sea, rapidly restoring his exhausted Soul.

Tan Jun Hao had been badly injured, as it was not easy to take a punch from the Embodiment. Yang Kai had the confidence to fight with him even when he was in his best condition, not to mention now he was in a terrible condition.

This old man had plotted to harm him before they met, and Yang Kai swore that would kill him no matter what.

“Junior, you court death!” Tan Jun Hao growled as he raised his hands in a posture of grasping the whole world and gritted his teeth, “Since you dared to disobey this Old Master, this Old Master will grant your death wish!”

When the words fell, many figures emerged and gathered around him.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow and quickly examined those figures. Soon, to his surprise, he found that these people were all the Emperor Realm Masters from the auction house.

Although most of them were First-Order Emperors, there were also several Second-Order Emperor Realm Masters among them. Many of them looked familiar and seemed to be Sect Masters and Elders from various big Sects in the Southern Territory who came to participate in the auction.

Their number was also quite large, about thirty in total.

These Emperor Realm Masters strangely appeared, and all of them looked quite puzzled. They were all separated in boundless darkness after Tan Jun Hao activated the Spirit Array and had been searching for an exit up till now but to no avail.

Then, inexplicably, a sudden force emerged and dragged them all here. The next thing they knew, they found themselves in the presence of Yang Kai and Tan Jun Hao.

Noticing Tan Jun Hao’s injury, these Emperor Realm Masters were immediately struck by shock and secretly felt terrified.

They saw that Tan Jun Hao was exuding his powerful Third-Order Emperor Realm aura, but he was actually wounded, and his wounds seemed to be quite serious. Other than him, Yang Kai was the only person standing here.

Could these injuries have been caused by the young man named Yang Kai? He was just a First-Order Emperor though, so how could he have the ability to hurt a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master?

“Ah? Elder Tan!” After looking at Tan Jun Hao carefully, a middle-aged man suddenly exclaimed and went forward with his fists cupped, “Greetings Elder Tan. Why are you here?”

Tan Jun Hao glanced at him and nodded, “You recognize this Old Master?”

The middle-aged man smiled, “More than ten years ago, this one was lucky enough to obtain a pass from Star Soul Palace to cultivate in a Heaven Grade Cultivation Room for a time. It was then that I saw Elder Tan from afar, so it is natural that Elder Tan doesn’t remember this humble one.”

The middle-aged man was a Sect Master himself, but he was just a First-Order Emperor and his Sect was only second-class in the Southern Territory. Therefore, he had to behave humbly in front of a Star Soul Palace Elder. Furthermore, he could only break through to the Emperor Realm Master thanks to the opportunity to cultivate in the Heaven Grade Cultivation Room of Star Soul Palace.

He was truly grateful to Star Soul Palace, so it was natural for him to show his respect to a Star Soul Palace Elder here.

Tan Jun Hao nodded lightly, saying nothing more to him.

Nevertheless, the middle-aged man’s words shocked everyone else.

“Elder Tan, Star Soul Palace… Don’t tell me…”

Although most of the Emperor Realm Masters here did not recognize Tan Jun Hao and had never even seen him before, they had made some vague guesses about this situation.

Star Soul Palace was a Great Emperor Sect, so in order to be an Elder, one must reach the Third-Order Emperor Realm. There were only a few Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters in Star Soul Palace.

Even if they had not met Tan Jun Hao before, everyone had heard his name.

All of them were awestruck in their hearts and went forward and greeted with their fists cupped, “Greetings, Elder Tan!”

“Drop the formalities!” Tan Jun Hao waved his hand gently with the demeanour of a senior expert.

The middle-aged man who spoke earlier asked in a solemn face, “Elder Tan, who was bold enough to oppose you? Moreover, you were even wounded.”

Tan Jun Hao looked at Yang Kai coldly, and answered, “It’s this little friend. He ambushed this Old Master!”

Yang Kai curled his lip hearing what Tan Jun Hao said. It was true that he ambushed him, but if Tan Jun Hao did not threaten him first, why would he ambush a Third-Order Emperor Realm for no reason?

The middle-aged man was infuriated and immediately pointed at Yang Kai, “It’s you again, little bastard. Elder Tan is an Elder of Star Soul Palace, who has a respected and noble status! Star Soul Palace is the ruler of our Southern Territory, sheltering billions of cultivators under its wings. Little bastard, it is your honour to be in Elder Tan’s presence, yet instead of showing gratitude, you actually ambushed Elder Tan? Kneel down and apologize now! Elder Tan is kind-hearted, and perhaps he might spare your life, but if you continue to be stubborn, we will kill you!”

His words were sonorous and reverberating, causing Tan Jun Hao to smile gleefully while listening to them.

But all the other Emperor Realm Masters showed different expressions. Unlike the middle-aged man, they had not gained anything significant from Star Soul Palace, so although they respected Star Soul Palace, they did not need to go as far as to bootlick Tan Jun Hao.

However, it was not good for them to refute this either, so they just stood quietly and looked at Yang Kai sympathetically.

Now, they recalled that Yang Kai did mention something about a Star Soul Palace Elder in the auction earlier. Now, it seemed that the Star Soul Palace Elder he mentioned was Tan Jun Hao.

No one knew how a feud between him and Tan Jun Hao started, or how he could still have a way to live in the Southern Territory after offending Tan Jun Hao? Sure enough, youngsters were always impulsive and did not know how to restrain themselves.

“Ah… I was wondering who it was! It’s actually my friend from room thirteen who ate three kilograms of shit! No wonder your mouth is so smelly,” Yang Kai looked sideways at the middle-aged man and fanned the air in front of his nose with his hand.

“Ah…”

“It’s actually him!”

“Did he really eat it?”

“This, this, this…”

After hearing Yang Kai’s words, all the Emperor Realm Masters stared at the middle-aged man simultaneously, their eyes widened. Furthermore, some of them immediately jumped back to widen their distance from the middle-aged man with a disgusted look, as if they really smelled shit from his mouth.

All of a sudden, the middle-aged man’s surroundings were cleared, like a giant pair of invisible hands and split him apart from everyone else. Even Tan Jun Hao frowned as he looked at the middle-aged man with a strange look on his face.

“You…” The middle-aged man pointed at Yang Kai angrily, his face turning red from shame and rage.

What happened in room thirteen before was the biggest insult of his life. At that time, he really felt that it would have been better to be killed by Yang Kai than to be humiliated like that, but the hatred in his heart pushed him to live on as he secretly plotted his revenge.

When he saw Yang Kai after being summoned here by Tan Jun Hao through the Spirit Array, he had guessed that Tan Jun Hao’s injury was somehow related to this little bastard and could not wait to step out and put pressure on Yang Kai using Tan Jun Hao’s name.

But he did not expect that he would be humiliated by Yang Kai again.

Pairs of disdainful and disgusted eyes were piercing him like countless thorns. He could not wait to find a hole to hide as he shouted, “Don’t listen to this little brat’s nonsense, it wasn’t me!” The middle-aged man hurriedly denied.

No one believed him though as everyone had clearly heard him speaking in the auction venue before and could now recognize that it was indeed the same voice.

“Little bastard, you and I will be sworn enemies forever!” The middle-aged man knew that his reputation had been completely ruined when there was no response from the crowd. When someone mentioned him again in the future, perhaps the first thing they thought of would be him eating three kilograms of shit…

Yang Kai lifted his head with his lip curled, “Sorry, this Young Master doesn’t talk to people who eat shit. Please keep your mouth shut, Your Excellency!”

Pu…

The middle-aged man’s vitality roiled from uncontrollable anger, but he had no way to vent it, so he ended up spurting a mouthful of blood.

Seemingly losing his mind, the only thought left in his head was to kill Yang Kai to avenge himself. Through gritted teeth, he shouted in a rage, “I’ll kill you!”

With a flash of brilliance, a sharp sword appeared in his hand, and with a surge of Emperor Qi, he wrapped himself in a sword light and charged towards Yang Kai.

Such a ferocious blow could almost be said to be the full strength of the middle-aged man as a First-Order Emperor Realm Master. Even the other Emperors present could not help looking slightly shocked and dared not to underestimate this move.

On the contrary, Yang Kai showed a scornful look and sneered arrogantly. A large broadsword abruptly appeared in his hand and with a flourish, he retaliated coldly, “Since you want to die so much, this Young Master will grant your wish!”

“You’re the one who will die!” The middle-aged man yelled, seemingly unleashing all his strength in this one strike as he rushed up to Yang Kai’s face.

Yang Kai simply stepped forward and with a swing of his arm, lifted the Myriads Sword up, releasing a shining blade of sword light, one that seemed capable of rending the sky asunder, terrifying all who saw it.

*Ci la… *

Like a piece of silk had been torn apart, the shining sword light that was charging towards Yang Kai’s face was suddenly split into two and passed by either side of his body. The dazzling light dispersed in an instant, falling heavily to the ground and rolling a long way before it gradually stopped.

“Ssii…”

Everyone gasped as they stared at this scene in disbelief and astonishment.

Long bloodstains were drawn on either side behind Yang Kai, while crushed internal organs were scattered all over the ground along with two halves of a fresh corpse.

The power of that one sword slash actually managed to split a First-Order Emperor in two.

And it seemed that Yang Kai just swung his sword casually, not using any of his strength at all.

Although everyone knew Yang Kai’s strength was outstanding and understood that the middle-aged man could not possibly be his match, they never expected him to be so vulnerable.

No, it was not that he was vulnerable, but rather that Yang Kai was unreasonably strong!

Everyone had learnt of his terrifying combat ability when he killed the old man in room seven with a single stomp of his foot and a slash of his sword, but at this moment, they realized that they had still underestimated him.

Yang Kai flicked away the blood on the Myriads Swords and grinned, “This is a place of discord. Just leave if you can, why stay and watch?”

Tan Jun Hao definitely did not summon so many Emperor Realm Masters just for them to watch. He was probably plotting something, and perhaps planned to use these people against him.

Yang Kai did not want to make enemies with so many people, for Tan Jun Hao was his only target now.

Sensing the malevolence from Yang Kai’s words and considering the lessons from the recent past, the Emperor Realm Masters could not help shivering. Although they thought that this young man was too domineering, arrogant, and did not put anyone in the auction in his eyes, he truly had the capital to act so, and it would not be wise for them to turn against him.

Furthermore, they had no grievances with him, so why would they try to provoke him?
