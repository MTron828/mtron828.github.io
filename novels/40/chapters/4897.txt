The worst case scenario was that the other end of the Void Corridor was connected to the Black Ink Battlefield!

This guess wasn’t completely baseless. The fact that an Ancient Great Expert had sealed the Black Ink Royal Lord here and turned it into a part of the seal meant that the other end of the Void Corridor had some connection to the Black Ink Clan.

The most likely place with a connection to a Royal Lord was the Black Ink Battlefield.

“Now that the Royal Lord is dead, the seal is becoming loose and the Void Corridor is gradually revealing itself. If our expectations are correct, we must begin preparing for the worst.”

“This Junior has also made some attempts recently, and with my current achievements in the Dao of Space, while it may be difficult to seal this Void Corridor again, it is not impossible.”

The Eighth-Order Ancestors lightly nodded their acknowledgement when they heard this. Yang Kai had mentioned this to Liu Mu before and many of them had heard it. They were all very glad that there was someone like Yang Kai who was proficient in the Dao of Space in the current generation; otherwise, there really wouldn’t have been any alternative for the Cave Heavens and Paradises in the face of the current situation.

Although they could have also found a way to seal the Void Corridor, it would definitely not have been better than the Ancient Great Expert’s methods, much less Yang Kai’s.

Special tasks should be handled by appropriate professionals only.

“What are you worried about, then?” An Eighth-Order Ancestor asked. Although Yang Kai’s tone was filled with great confidence when he spoke of sealing the Void Corridor again, the worry on his face was obvious.

Yang Kai smiled wryly, “Junior is only worried about one thing right now. When the seal set up by the ancient ancestors is completely lifted, the Void Corridor will be fully open. At that time, even if Junior is able to seal it again, the Void Corridor will still be at a risk of being discovered.”

In that case, re-sealing it would become meaningless.

It wouldn’t matter if the other side wasn’t the Black Ink Battlefield, but if it was, and the Black Ink Clan discovered the existence of this Void Corridor, they would definitely try to investigate what was on the other side. At that time, the 3,000 Worlds would not be able to block them.

It was quite a big ordeal, and everyone sunk into silence upon hearing this.

An Eighth-Order Ancestor with white hair asked, “Can you seal it again while the seal has not been completely lifted, apply another seal while using the original seal as the foundation?”

“Yes and no!”

Yang Kai’s ambiguous answer left everyone confused, [If you can do it, just say yes, if you can’t, say no. What’s the meaning of this ‘yes and no’!?]

Liu Mu wryly smiled, “Yang Boy, if you have something to say, just say it, you’re confusing us old fogies.”

Yang Kai cupped his fist in apology. He pondered for a moment before suddenly taking out a bamboo pole with a flip of his hand.

This bamboo was about as thick as a human arm with some green bamboo leaves also growing on it. Everyone was familiar with this bamboo and recognized it as a stalk of Profound Yin Bamboo.

Over the past 100 years, they had all spent quite a deal of effort and resources to cultivate Profound Yin Bamboo in their Small Universe in order to guard themselves against the Black Ink Master. Now, each and every one of them had a small bamboo forest inside their Small Universe.

Yang Kai’s Small Universe also had Profound Yin Bamboo, a lot of which he had transplanted there when he last visited the New Great Territory to investigate the situation.

The next moment, the Profound Yin Bamboo turned hollow and its branches and leaves withered with a slight shake of his hand, transforming into a long, cylindrical pole.

Everyone looked at Yang Kai in confusion, unable to understand why he did something like this. They were just talking about the Void Corridor’s matter, so why did he suddenly take out a Profound Yin Bamboo all of a sudden?

Nonetheless, everyone knew that Yang Kai must have something in mind and didn’t interrupt him.

“Let me put it this way, let’s assume that this bamboo tube is the Void Corridor.” Yang Kai, holding the Profound Yin Bamboo in one hand, pointed at its ends, “It connects two distant places through the Void. This end is connected to Black Territory, and the other is connected to somewhere unknown. For the moment, we’ll assume it is connected to the Black Ink Battlefield!”

Everyone nodded, indicating for him to continue.

Yang Kai pushed his strength into the Profound Yin Bamboo, filling the Profound Yin Bamboo with yellow light in the blink of an eye. Impressively, it was Yang Element Power.

Yang Kai continued, “The Ancient Masters used some powerful Divine Ability to seal this Void Corridor, cutting off the connection between the two places. The seal makes it absolutely impossible to discover this Void Corridor; but now, the seal has become loose, and the energy used for sealing the Void Corridor is slowly dispersing.” As he spoke, the yellow energy filling the bamboo tube started to slowly recede towards the other end. More than half of it had disappeared after a breath, almost reconnecting the two ends once more.

Yang Kai’s explanation was quite novel and also easy to understand.

Soon, someone noticed a problem. A stalwart Eighth-Order Ancestor furrowed his brow as he asked, “You mean to say that the energy sealing the Void Corridor began to dissipate from Black Territory’s end, and is gradually receding towards the other side!”

The fact that he spotted this wasn’t surprising as Yang Kai’s explanation made it quite obvious. Furthermore, when they had been investigating the Void Corridor recently, their probes also reached a similar conclusion.

When his Divine Sense probed the Void Corridor, Yang Kai could clearly feel an invisible wall blocking him, which was obviously the energy sealing the Void Corridor.

But after some time had passed, he noticed that the energy was indeed retreating.

“Indeed!” Yang Kai nodded his acknowledgement. It saved him a lot of explaining time, “When this Junior said that it could be sealed, this Junior meant it!”

It wasn’t that he was boasting, he was just speaking the truth.

Saying so, he mobilized the blue crystal’s energy, sealing the mouth of the bamboo tube representing Black Territory.

The yellow and blue energy were extremely obvious.

But then, Yang Kai shook his head, adding, “But doing so would be meaningless. We are fooling ourselves if we think that it will be over by just sealing up the passage to Black Territory. So, this kind of sealing does not cut it.”

While he was speaking, the yellow energy representing the Ancient Seal continued to dissipate, meaning that once the seal’s energy had completely disappeared, the Void Corridor on the other side would be revealed.

At that time, the Black Ink Clan on the other side would be able to follow along the Void Corridor, break the seal Yang Kai had left behind, and enter Black Territory.

Everyone fell silent. Yang Kai’s explanation couldn’t be any clearer. All of them were Eighth-Order Ancestors of their respective Sects, so whether it was their aptitude or talent, they were all the best of the best. They would be fools if they couldn’t understand things at this point.

An old white-haired Ancestor thus asked, “Sealing Black Territory is indeed just a treatment for the symptoms, but since you’ve brought this up, I assume you have a solution?”

Yang Kai nodded, “Yes!”

Everyone was shocked.

“Everyone, please take a look!” As Yang Kai spoke, he withdrew the yellow and blue energy and began another demonstration.

This time, he didn’t give any explanation. He just showed them.

The yellow energy once again filled the bamboo tube. After the explanation just now, everyone knew that it represented the energy left behind by the Ancient Masters.

In Yang Kai’s demonstration, the yellow energy continued to dissipate and recede from the side representing Black Territory and soon disappeared.

In other words, it meant that the Void Corridor was completely open.

But the moment yellow energy disappeared, blue energy emerged from the other end and began filling the bamboo tube back up again.

However, the supplement of blue energy and the erosion of yellow energy were in opposite directions.

Everyone understood that this sealing procedure of the Void Corridor had to wait until the energy in the Ancient Seal had completely disappeared. Yang Kai would enter the Void Corridor when the two places were completely connected, and seal it from the other end to Black Territory, completely sealing it!

There was no other alternative either. The Void Corridor was filled with energy right now, and Yang Kai could not reach the other side unless it had completely dissipated.

“It shouldn’t take long. This Junior will be able to completely conceal the traces of the Void Corridor from the other side within half a day at most. As long as no one discovers it during this half a day, the existence of the Void Corridor will remain a secret and there will be no risk of anyone breaking the seal and reaching here.”

“It’s too risky!” Among the crowd, an Eight-Order Ancestor immediately shook his head.

Forget about half a day, even an incense stick’s worth of time would not cut it as no one knew where the other end of the Void Corridor was. Everything would be fine if it wasn’t the Black Ink Battlefield, but if it really was, and the Black Ink Clan discovered it, the consequences would be unimaginable. Just as Yang Kai had said before, all they could do now was prepare for the worst.

This sealing method was too risky and depended too much on luck.

Although the others didn’t say anything, it was obvious they felt the same.

“Then there’s only one way left,” Yang Kai once again filled the bamboo tube with the yellow energy representing the ancient sealing energy, and this time, as the yellow energy receded, the blue energy representing his own sealing technique followed right behind it.

When the yellow energy completely disappeared, the bamboo tube was instantly filled up with blue energy! The Void Corridor’s seal remained intact, but the ancient sealing power had been replaced by Yang Kai’s.

Liu Mu’s expression changed slightly as he saw through Yang Kai’s intentions, “You want to enter the Void Corridor?”

Either way, Yang Kai had to enter the Void Corridor, but the first method entailed starting from the other side and retreating back here. Once the seal was complete, Yang Kai would find himself in Black Territory.

However, the latter method was completely different. This meant that he had to chase after the place where the ancient seal had disappeared and infuse his own energy behind him. Once the seal was complete, he would exit at the other end of the tunnel.

“This is the only way to ensure the Void Corridor is not discovered,” Yang Kai solemnly stated.

“If you do this, you won’t be able to return.” Liu Mu furrowed his brow. He felt the need to warn Yang Kai, “We still can’t determine what kind of place is on the other side, if it really is the Black Ink Battlefield…” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

If it really was the Black Ink Battlefield, Yang Kai, being only a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, would definitely be doomed to die.

“Even if it really is the Black Ink Battlefield, this Junior will not refuse,” Yang Kai put away the bamboo tube, dispersed the yellow and blue energy, and looked at the crowd, “Of course, if Seniors have a better candidate or method to achieve this, this Junior will be more than happy to cooperate.”
