If so many Open Heaven Realm Masters were to fight here, it would definitely have a huge impact on the entire Universe World. If the fight went on for too long, this Universe World might even be torn to pieces; however, they could not remain still either. Once Zuo Quan Hui had refined this Universe World’s foundation, he could do as he pleased and this continent would plunge into misery anyway!

All Yang Kai could do was quickly end this battle to reduce the losses!

Yang Kai’s gaze turned to the nearby Great Emperor, who was lying in a pool of blood. Lu Bai Yang also happened to have noticed him.

As their eyes met, Lu Bai Yang requested in a low voice, “Blue Clouds Continent’s Lu Bai Yang begs for Your Excellency’s assistance in slaying these evil people and returning peace to this world!”

“I won’t disappoint you!” Yang Kai nodded slightly before raising his spear and pointing it towards Zuo Quan Hui.

[Today, either he dies or I perish!]

Seeing this, Lu Bai Yang’s figure flickered and he instantly disappeared from his spot. After having obtained the acknowledgement of the World’s Will and becoming a Great Emperor, he was able to travel freely on the Blue Clouds Continent. Even if he had never cultivated the Dao of Space, he could still travel to any corner of this world with its assistance.

A great battle was about to break out! Although he had no way of speculating what kind of profound cultivation both sides had, he knew that the gap between him and them was too great. If he stayed here, not only would he not be of any help, but he might even be accidentally injured.

Since that was the case, the better choice was to quickly evacuate everyone in the vicinity. Regardless of how many he could actually save, he had to at least try!

Zuo Quan Hui and the others had no intention of stopping him. The life and death of an indigenous Great Emperor did not matter to them.

The next moment, the aura of 22 Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters slowly spread out, causing the entire world to freeze.

Zi Yan and the others couldn’t help but let out muffled grunts as they felt as if a great mountain was pressing down on them, making it hard to even properly breathe. They had no choice but to use their full strength to resist the pressure. At the same time, they quickly moved towards Zuo Quan Hui. The gap in their numbers was simply too great, with Yang Kai’s group being almost three times bigger than theirs. They had no choice but to rely on Zuo Quan Hui, a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm, to even the odds.

The atmosphere instantly became tense as both sides unleashed their auras, seemingly wanting to seize the initiative in this silent battle, but neither of them actually took the initiative to attack. Immediately after, Void Cracks began to appear right in the middle of the two groups, distorting the surrounding space.

They were evenly matched!

Surprisingly, they were able to block the invisible pressure emanated by Void Land’s Masters under Zuo Quan Hui’s leadership.

Zi Yan and the others were ecstatic, and they pushed their auras even harder.

Void Land was losing ground! Among the 22 people who stood in mid-air, a few of them suddenly stumbled and their faces went slightly pale. They looked like they were about to collapse.

Heavenly Sword Union’s Masters became even more excited at the sight of this. They immediately wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to push further and crush the arrogance of Void Land.

If they could achieve this, Void Land would be at a disadvantage in the actual battle.

With such a huge disparity in numbers, Heavenly Sword Union’s side should have been at a disadvantage even if they had a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, but the fact was that Void Land were the ones losing momentum. They appeared to have the upper hand, but actually didn’t.

Zi Yan failed to understand why they were gaining the upper hand and could only guess that Void Land’s side had consumed too much energy in the last battle and had yet to recover.

This was great news for Heavenly Sword Union’s group.

Yin Xin Zhao, Pei Wen Xuan, Dan Yang, and Huang Mao also had similar thoughts. Perhaps this time, they would be able to turn defeat into victory.

But the next moment, something happened that took everyone by surprise!

Palm shadows filled the sky as they rained down on Zuo Quan Hui’s back like a violent storm. Then, the fearsome World Force of someone in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm suddenly erupted. Zuo Quon Hui fell victim to this sneak attack even though he was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. His eyes widened in anger as he slashed his sword behind him without a moment of hesitation.

This sword light seemed to be able to cut through space, leaving only the brilliance of the attack behind.

A figure quickly retreated, but it was still unable to avoid that sharp attack and was slashed from head to toe, almost splitting in two as a result.

Fortunately, the figure immediately retreated after launching their sneak attack. Its quick escape saved its life, but it was still seriously injured. This attack left a huge gaping wound spanning from the middle of its brow to its abdomen. Red hot blood immediately gushed out of the wound as the figure was sent flying, crashing into Tranquil Heavens Peak.

The 10,000 metres tall mountain split and collapsed into rubble.

This sneak attack came out of nowhere, and Zuo Quan Hui’s counterattack was not slow either, so everything was over in a flash.

It wasn’t until this moment that Zi Yan and the others came to their senses. When they turned their heads, they recognized the attacker to be the Myriad Demons Heaven disciple named Mo Sheng, who claimed to have broken through at the last moment and fought his way out.

Pei Wen Xuan’s mind went blank as he instinctively felt that something was wrong.

He could not believe his Junior Brother Mo Sheng launched a sneak attack on Zuo Quan Hui. Why would he do that? As impossible as it seemed, the truth was right in front of him. Mo Sheng had already been sent flying, and no one knew whether he was dead or alive, so Pei Wen Xuan had to accept the reality before his eyes.

Suddenly, he felt a cold gaze focused on him, filled with murderous intent.

Pei Wen Xuan was startled and quickly turned his head, explaining himself in horror, “Martial Uncle Zuo, I don’t know…”

Before he could finish his sentence, an incomparably terrifying pressure descended from the sky. It was none other than Void Land’s cultivators who had been forced to retreat previously and were now counterattacking.

The pressure emanating from the Void Land Masters was tremendous, completely opposite to the weakness they showed before. The pressure felt like it could topple the mountains and overturn the seas, sweeping away the world as it passed.

[They were feigning weakness?]

In an instant, Pei Wen Xuan understood everything. [No wonder they didn’t attack just after they arrived and deliberately used their pressure to suppress us instead. They wanted to distract us so that Zuo Quan Hui would have no choice but to exert his pressure to resist, giving Mo Sheng an opportunity to launch a sneak attack.]

Once Zuo Quan Hui fell into this trap and used his pressure to counterattack, he could not stop.

Their every step was meticulous and carefully planned. Those from Void Land were too cunning!

Pei Wen Xuan also finally understood how those from Void Land had found them so quickly. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

This Great Territory was vast, and they had not left any trail behind on their way here. Furthermore, it was just a coincidence that they found this continent. However, those from Void Land had arrived here less than half a day later; it was simply too quick!

Since Mo Sheng was a traitor though, it was naturally not difficult for him to secretly leave behind some clues.

Mo Sheng was a Myriad Demons Heaven disciple like him, so after Zuo Quan Hui was ambushed, one did not need to be a genius to understand why he was showing such murderous intent towards him. However, Pei Wen Xuan couldn’t come up with anything to prove his innocence. He had no intention of betraying Zuo Quan Hui, but he had been implicated by Mo Sheng.

The only thing he couldn’t figure out was why Mo Sheng had betrayed Zuo Quan Hui and when he had teamed up with Yang Kai!

Now, after he gave it another thought though, he found Mo Sheng’s breakthrough to the Sixth-Order extremely suspicious. However, when Mo Sheng had rushed over, no one had had the time to look deeper into this matter. In addition, he was also a Myriad Demons Heaven disciple, so asking too much would inevitably cause the other party to feel some displeasure, which could lead to a conflict they couldn’t afford right now.

In their situation, even one more Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master meant better chances of survival.

At this moment, none of them had the time to think about these things. Everyone, including Zuo Quan Hui, a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, buckled under the fearsome wave of pressure. Their energy was sent into turmoil as they spat out mouthfuls of blood.

“Kill!” Yang Kai angrily roared as he raised his spear. Immediately after, the 22 people on his side, who had been suppressing their auras since they appeared, rushed down like a tiger hunting its prey as they each went looking for their opponent.

Iron Blood Great Emperor and Bustling World Great Emperor headed straight towards Pei Wen Xuan together.

Martial Beast and Serene Soul charged straight at Yin Xin Zhao.

Flower Shadow and Ice Feather attacked Dan Yang together.

Wondrous Pill and Heavens Revelation fought Huang Mao together.

Fang Yue and Xiang Ying were thus left with no choice but to go after Zi Yan.

As men, they really did not want to gang up on a lone woman, but since everyone had already decided on this strategy, they had no choice but to accept it.

The eight Great Emperors, as well as Fang Yue and Xiang Ying, were Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters who had advanced in recent years. Their foundations were shallow, and could not compare with veteran Sixth-Order Heavenly Monarchs like Dan Yang and Huang Mao, or even Zi Yan, Pei Wen Xuan, and Yin Xin Zhao.

In a one-on-one fight, they were definitely not their opponent.

But two against one was naturally not a problem.

They were also in desperate need of a fierce battle to consolidate their cultivations and adapt to the battles between Open Heaven Realm Masters. In the Star Boundary’s Great Territory, the Great Emperors had not had a chance to act because they had all gone to the Star Boundary to support Yang Kai. Now, their wish had finally come true.

Although the Void Land cultivators weren’t at their peak because of the last battle, the same was true for Yin Xin Zhao, Pei Wen Xuan and the others. Everyone’s situation was similar and neither was better off than the other.

On top of that, Yin Xin Zhao and the others had just suffered under the joint pressure exerted by those from Void Land just now, which had put them at a disadvantage.

For the moment, Void Land had the absolute upper hand in their respective battlefields, leaving Yin Xin Zhao and the others bruised and battered.

The peaks in the vicinity collapsed one after another as the Heavens were torn asunder and the Earth was split apart. The fallout from a battle between Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were extremely terrifying. Lu Bai Yang would have lost his life had he not left, even if he was a Great Emperor.

On the other side, the Three Mountain Lords, Hua Yong and Shu Mu Dan, Qing Kui, Su Ying Xue, Yue He, Mo Mei, Hui Gu, Luan Bai Feng, and Yang Kai as the leader together fought the Seventh-Order Master, Zuo Quan Hui in a twelve vs one battle.

To be honest, even twelve ordinary Sixth-Order Masters might not be able to defeat a Seventh-Order Master. Even if they somehow won by putting their lives on the line, the price they had to pay would be quite steep, and they might even be dragged down with them. Fortunately, Yang Kai was no ordinary Sixth-Order Master.

The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were extremely precious to Void Land, so how could Yang Kai bear to let Zuo Quan Hui kill anyone?

Wu Kuang’s sneak attack had played an important role here. Zuo Quan Hui had not expected that a Myriad Demons Heaven disciple would attack him from behind.

When he had lured Yang Kai into attacking and piercing through the Territory Barrier, he had suffered serious injuries at Yang Kai’s Azure Dragon Spear. On his way here, he did not have the time to heal himself and had only thought of a way to disperse the Golden Crow’s True Fire lingering around his wound. And the sneak attack had only made his injuries worse.

At this moment, Zuo Quan Hui could only exert about 70% of his peak strength! Perhaps even worse.

If Zuo Quan Hui escaped even in these conditions, Yang Kai would simply stab himself to death with his own spear.

As soon as they began fighting, Zuo Quan Hui was forced to retreat again and again. Although he was recklessly waving his sword and spending his World Force, he was still unable to withstand the combined onslaught of twelve Sixth-Order Masters. Yang Kai’s spear struck his shoulder and sent him flying in just a few breaths of time as a dozen or so Divine Abilities and Secret Techniques followed closely behind. It immediately caused Zuo Quan Hui’s eyes to widen in anger as he drew a circle with his sword, barely managing to block the oncoming attacks.

Even so, his vitality was sent into turmoil from the impact.
