Mo Xiao Qi’s entire existence was a conundrum to Yang Kai.

He was fairly certain that the innocence and naivety she displayed were all a deception, but even now, he couldn’t see any flaws in her act. Moreover, judging from the generous gifts she had handed out and the extremely profound concealment Secret Technique she had just used, it was obvious her origins weren’t simple.

How could an ordinary Origin King have so many Origin King Grade artifacts in their Space Ring, and all of them of extraordinary grade and quality? What’s more, subtle but powerful fluctuations came from all over her body, making it apparent she was wearing a lot of very powerful artifacts.

This girl definitely had a very powerful background.

This made Yang Kai wary of her.

For these various reasons, her saying she had a way to deal with the Firebird was quite believable to him.

After obtaining advantages from a person, it was difficult to just abandon them as well, so although Yang Kai did not want to get involved in this Clear Jade Mountain situation anymore, he also didn’t feel he could just back out now.

“Sister Xiao Qi, you said you have a way to deal with that Firebird, can you tell me in detail? After all, that beast is very strong and we really don’t want to follow in their footsteps,” Xu Qing asked with some worry as he pointed to the nearby corpses.

Yu Ruo Mei nodded similarly, agreeing with Xu Qing’s point of view.

Mo Xiao Qi frowned and looked a little embarrassed, but after a moment, she seemed to make up her mind and said, “It’s not convenient for me to give a detailed explanation, but suffice-it-to-say, I have an artifact that restrains its strength. Please trust me everyone, I wouldn’t let you do something too dangerous.”

Hearing this, Xu Qing and Yu Ruo Mei looked at each other and nodded lightly, the former smiling and saying, “Since Sister Xiao Qi has said so, this Xu will not ask anymore. I just hope that Sister Xiao Qi will be successful at that time.”

“Don’t worry, leave it to me,” Mo Xiao Qi was overjoyed and patted her chest firmly, “Then let us quickly track its location, although I don’t know where it has fled, it must have left behind some traces so we can definitely find it.”

Saying so, she led the way again.

After travelling for another hour or so, Mo Xiao Qi suddenly stopped, and the atmosphere of the group became tense again.

The tracks ahead had suddenly ended.

Just when she frowned, trying to find clues again, an extraordinary force suddenly rose up from nearby. This aura was extremely hot and as soon as it appeared, the temperature in the air rose rapidly, causing the surrounding green trees to wither and dry up before quickly bursting into flames.

“Be careful!” Yang Kai hurriedly shouted.

There was no need for him to warn them though as all four people present were Third-Order Origin Kings and were extremely sensitive to such energy fluctuations. When the heat flooded towards them, the four quickly scattered in different directions.

*Hu...*

A jet black ball of flame the size of a washbasin directly bombarded the place where everyone had originally been standing, turning it into a scorching inferno that seemed like it would burn until the end of time. The terrifying heat from these black flames caused the faces of almost everyone present to become solemn.

“As I thought, it’s here!” Mo Xiao Qi on the other hand did not show a look of fear but instead one of joy. Her delicate face was filled with excitement as she turned to stare in a certain direction.

On the other end of her gaze was a strange-looking bird about ten metres tall and covered in fiery-red feathers. The look in its eyes was fierce as it stared at the intruders. Its long tail feathers were particularly beautiful in appearance, making it look like an incarnation of fire.

“Liu Yan?” Yang Kai was taken aback.

The suddenly appeared Firebird, from appearance alone, was almost identical to Liu Yan’s, but soon Yang Kai understood that the Firebird in front of him was not Liu Yan.

Because, even though it looked like it was made of pure fire, it was still obviously a flesh and blood creature, and... Yang Kai also vaguely felt a faint pressure from it, a sign that it was likely even stronger than he was.

“Damn it, who spread that rumour this thing was an Artifact Spirit?” Xu Qing cursed to the side, extremely angry.

On the outskirts of Clear Jade Mountain, many cultivators had heard rumours that a sentient Artifact Spirit was hiding here, which led to countless cultivators rushing over, but now it seemed that was not the case. Obviously, this rumour was spread by some blind bastard who was unable to properly identify this Firebird.

However, thinking about this was meaningless now. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“It’s coming again!” Yu Ruo Mei screamed as her tender body flickered, leaving behind an afterimage as she rapidly dodged.

The next moment, a black ball of flame bombarded where she stood before.

After Yu Ruo Mei’s figure re-appeared some distance away, a look of lingering fear covered her face. She could clearly feel the powerful lethality contained in those black flames and was certain that if she was contaminated by them, her fate would not be any different from the Jiang Family’s Third Elder.

So many dead Origin Kings had already proven how difficult an opponent this Firebird was, so how could Yu Ruo Mei dare act carelessly?

“Friends, please hold it down for a while, I’ll start preparing!” Mo Xiao Qi hurriedly said as she suddenly jumped away from where she stood and began forming a series of mysterious seals with her hands, her entire temperament suddenly changing dramatically.

The innocence faded from her face as Mo Xiao Qi suddenly became solemn and awe-inspiring, her red lips squirming lightly as she formed seals rapidly with her hands. It was impossible to discern what she was saying, but as she spoke, a blue sphere of water appeared in front of her. This sphere contained a surging Water Attribute strength, like a vast ocean compressed down innumerable times, and if one listened carefully, they could even hear the sound of crashing waves coming from within it.

“A Dao Source Grade artifact?” Xu Qing’s eyes nearly turned red as his breathing became ragged, staring greedily at the blue water ball in front of Mo Xiao Qi.

Although he was a Third-Order Origin King, he had never even touched a Dao Source Grade artifact before, much less owned one. Although he speculated this girl had at least one Dao Source Grade artifact on her from the previous degree of generosity Mo Xiao Qi had displayed, after really seeing her pull one out, Xu Qing still felt shocked.

What’s more, this water sphere was obviously no ordinary Dao Source Grade artifact. It was very likely a High-Rank Dao Source Grade Artifact!

Such a treasure was invaluable to Xu Qing!

“Brother Xu, is this the time to get distracted?” Yang Kai snorted coldly as he hurried over to Mo Xiao Qi.

When Mo Xiao Qi took out the water sphere artifact and began to chant, the Firebird on the opposite side immediately fixed its sight on her as its eyes trembled, seemingly sensing a threat from her. Instantly, it marked Mo Xiao Qi as its priority.

Opening its beak, it spat out a pillar of black flames like a surging dragon towards her.

Yang Kai’s face changed drastically as his first instinct was to dodge.

“Please help me resist it, I can’t move right now!”

Before Yang Kai could dodge though, Mo Xiao Qi’s nervous words rang out in his ears.

“What a Pig!” Yang Kai couldn’t help cursing. He really couldn’t figure out whether Mo Xiao Qi was acting naïve or really was just that stupid. In the face of such a powerful enemy, she had displayed a Secret Technique that required her to remain stationary? What difference was that with courting death? Right now, as long as he dodged, Mo Xiao Qi would certainly be hit by the black flames and judging from the terrifying power behind them, she would definitely die.

Was her previous naïve and innocent performance from before not a disguise but her genuine personality? Was he wrong to suspect her of putting on an act all this time? If that wasn’t the case, how could her combat instincts be so terrible?

Anyone with even the slightest experience or combat sense wouldn’t choose this approach unless they were with teammates they could believe in from the bottom of their heart!

As for him, Xu Qing, and Yu Ruo Mei, they obviously were not companions who Mo Xiao Qi could entrust her life to.

In that instant, various thoughts flashed across Yang Kai’s mind, but he swiftly shoved them all aside and shouted, “If you don’t want to die here, help me!”

As he spoke, a five-coloured glow burst from Yang Kai’s body.

Stretching out his hand, he shouted, “Earth Sword Qi, Divine Nullification Shield!”

A yellow-brown light condensed in front of him and quickly assumed the form of a giant shield.

While cultivating the Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art, Yang Kai had absorbed a large amount of energy from Divine Nullification Sand as his Earth Attribute Supreme Treasure, so now he could naturally use it as a form of defence.

The Earth Attribute was thick and solid, so it was best used for defence. As such, the defensive power of this Divine Nullification Shield was naturally quite good.

However, he did not stop there. Yang Kai next stripped the green Wood Attribute light from his body to create an illusory forest in front of himself, adding a second layer of protection behind the Divine Nullification Shield.

Next was the Water Attribute, Metal Attribute, Fire Attribute...

All five of his Sword Qis were used to rapidly create a five-stage barrier in front of himself.

*Hong...*

The black flame pillar struck the Divine Nullification Shield and smashed through it in an instant before rushing into the illusory forest, which it swiftly burst to ashes.

The ocean of water and shield of iron were next to fall, and only when the black flames reached the raging inferno wall did it pause momentarily.

This wasn’t too surprising though, as Yang Kai had used Sun’s True Fire to condense his Fire Sword Qi, so it was definitely not inferior to his opponent’s black flames in terms of grade. However, in terms of quantity, Yang Kai’s flames were naturally inferior, and it was only a blink of an eye before he fell into a disadvantage.

The intense heat and murderous intent which was smashing towards Yang Kai made his hair stand on end as he felt death itself rapidly approach.

Only then did Xu Qing and Yu Ruo Mei finally react.

Although the two of them were clearly plotting something, they were not fools and understood that they weren’t opponents of this Firebird. If they wanted to survive now, they had to first rescue Mo Xiao Qi while praying that her Secret Technique would be effective.

Seeing Yang Kai already taking action, they didn’t dare hold back.

“Heaven Weave Slash!”

“Limitless Sacred Seal!”

A pair of techniques flew out from Xu Qing and Yu Ruo Mei, blocking the explosive power of the black flame pillar. The full-powered blow of two Third-Order Origin Kings was not to be underestimated.

With the two of them joining in, the pressure Yang Kai felt was greatly reduced.
