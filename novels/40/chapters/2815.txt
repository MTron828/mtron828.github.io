Half a day later, the dust finally settled.

Yu panted heavily, her face deathly pale as she stared at the corpse of Bone Melting Wolf King lying on the ground in disbelief.

There were no casualties in this battle on her side. Moreover, only a few of her clansmen had suffered light injuries! And, the biggest contributing factor to this miraculous occurrence was the weak looking, scrawny Shaman Niu!

He had kept the Bone Melting Wolf King’s attention on him the whole time, not giving it any time to bother about anything else. For that reason, the clansmen she led had been able to continuously inflict injuries on the enemy. The killing blow was landed only after a fierce battle lasting half a day. Rather than a decisive kill, it was more like they had gradually worn the Wolf King down to its death.

Looking at Shaman Niu, who was groping around inside the Wolf King’s corpse, Yu couldn’t help feeling mixed and conflicted feelings about it. Even now, she could barely believe what had just happened. The idea of victory itself was inconceivable; after all, that was a Wolf King that rivaled a Shaman Master in strength! Even if it was severely injured, it wasn’t something they could take down with such a small group of people. However, the Wolf King had been powerless against them due to Shaman Niu’s seemingly endless stream of tactics and tricks, turning what seemed like ordinary skills into something miraculous.

[How did he do it?] From the start until the end, this Shaman Niu had not cast any Shamanic Spell that was particularly powerful. All the Shamanic Spells he used were something she could use too. Even so, her Shamanic Spells would not have been anywhere near as effective in comparison.

“Yes! I found it!” Yang Kai laughed happily as he dug out a bloodied Monster Core from the Wolf King’s corpse. Then, he wiped it carefully against the snow before storing it away like a treasure. After that, he walked over to the other six dead Bone Melting Wolves without pause and took out the six Monster Cores from their corpses in the same way.

Yu composed herself somehow and shot a glance at her clansmen. One of them immediately went to pick the Snow Flowers they had originally come for while she walked over to Yang Kai and asked, “Shaman Niu, are you in need of Monster Cores?”

Yang Kai played with his bulging cloth bag and replied without looking up, “Yes!”

Yang Kai wanted to accumulate strength quickly, and in order to do so, he needed many Monster Cores.

Yu continued, “Although I don’t know why you need so many Monster Cores, there’s a place that might be of interest to you.”

“Where is that?” He looked up at her.

“Frost and Snow City!”

Yang Kai frowned at those words for a moment before asking, “The central city of the Frost and Snow Clan?”

“That’s right.”

“Will there be many Monster Cores there?”

Yu smiled in response, “Frost and Snow City is the only city belonging to the Frost and Snow Clan. More than eighty percent of the Frost and Snow Clan’s Shamans gather there. Even Shamans from other clans often frequent Frost and Snow City, especially during winter. Frost and Snow City is the only place that is not affected by the winter snows and remains open all year round. Furthermore, a large number of transactions are carried out in the city every day and Monster Cores of Barbarian Beasts are not uncommon there. You might even find Monster Cores of a higher grade than that of the Bone Melting Wolf King over there. As long as you can bring out goods of equal value, I believe other Shamans will be willing to trade with you.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai rubbed his chin thoughtfully, seeming to be swayed by the idea. If Frost and Snow City was as good as Yu said it was, then he should definitely go and take a look. At the very least, it would be faster obtaining Monster Cores there than simply searching for and killing Barbarian Beasts in White Net Mountain. Of course, Yang Kai had the slight problem of not having anything of value to trade with.

“What do you think? Do you want to check it out?” Yu struck while the iron was hot as she could tell at a glance that he was interested in the idea.

“It would be impolite of me to refuse your kindness, Shaman Yu,” Yang Kai grinned meaningfully.

Yu nodded happily in response, “Then, let’s set off together later.”

At this time, the Ancient Barbarian Warrior that went to collect the Snow Flowers returned and whispered something to her. In turn, she looked up at Yang Kai and said, “Shaman Niu, about the corpses of these Barbarian Beasts…”

“Do whatever you want.”

“Thank you very much!” Yu thanked him. Subsequently, she turned around and instructed her clansmen to process the corpses of the Bone Melting Wolves.

If a Shaman consumed the flesh of Barbarian Beasts over a long period of time, it would help them improve their strength. Thus, she couldn’t bear to let so many Barbarian Beast corpses go to waste in this place even if she was a High-Rank Shaman Warrior. Especially so when it came to the corpse of Bone Melting Wolf King. That was a powerful supplement even for a Shaman Grandmaster.

In contrast, Shaman Niu only wanted the Monster Cores and not the meat. Yu did not know what he was trying to do, as even though a Monster Core was highly valued, the most common method of consuming it was to soak it in wine. Some Herbalists could also use the Monster Cores of Barbarian Beasts to make potions, but this boy didn’t look like a Herbalist.

Needless to say, it was not the first time for these Ancient Barbarian Race Warriors to deal with the corpses of Monster Beasts. On the contrary, they were extremely skilled and, in less than a quarter of an hour, they finished processing the six Bone Melting Wolf carcasses and the Wolf King carcass.

One way or another, everybody carried the seven wolf pelts, plus the most delicious and tender parts of the Barbarian Beasts. Once all the preparations were completed, they set off.

Frost and Snow City was quite far from White Net Mountain, so even if they ran at full speed throughout the entire journey, it would still take them at least three days to arrive. That was based on the premise that Shaman Yu blessed them with the Spirit Walk Spell. Without the Spirit Walk Spell, their speed would be much slower.

Halfway through the journey, Yang Kai asked Yu to teach him the Spirit Walk Spell, and unsurprisingly, he immediately grasped it, shocking her with his incredible comprehension ability.

Three days later, a large shadow loomed before their eyes. The Ancient Barbarian Race Warriors and even Yu couldn’t help breaking out into a heartfelt smile at the sight.

“Shaman Niu, that’s Frost and Snow City!” Yu pointed in front.

Yang Kai could not help feeling astonished at the sight before him. It was his first time coming to an Ancient Barbarian city; however, the sight that greeted his eyes was completely different from what he had imagined.

He thought that since it was a city, it should at least look like a city. However, this place had zero resemblance to a city whatsoever. Rather, there was a single towering tree standing on the horizon. Despite the distance, Yang Kai could feel the rich and majestic aura coming from this tree that seemed to reach up to the Heavens and cover the sky in its canopy. It was hard to imagine just how tall it was as it seemed to continue up forever.

Under the sky-like canopy of the huge tree, buildings were built across the ground in a disorderly manner. It was like a cluttered chessboard that had been overturned in which Yang Kai could vaguely see many people actively living their daily lives.

“This is Frost and Snow City?” Yang Kai turned to look at Yu.

Yu smiled, “Yes, this is Frost and Snow City! It is also the root of the Frost and Snow Clan. Do you see that Evergreen Divine Tree? That is Senior Qing; he is the guardian who protects the Frost and Snow Clan.”

“Senior Qing…” Yang Kai’s mouth twitched, “Are you saying that… That tree is alive?” [If it is alive… Won’t that make it a Monster Tree? Still, such a large Monster Tree is a rare sight to see.]

Yu’s expression became solemn as she said earnestly, “Senior Qing has lived for thousands of years and is immortal and indestructible. Shaman Niu, remember to never desecrate Senior Qing if you ever enter Frost and Snow City!”

[Immortal and indestructible? Doesn’t that really make it a Monster Tree? But, comparing my Immortal Tree and this Evergreen Divine Tree is like comparing an old man and a baby…]

As Yu was being very serious, so Yang Kai could tell that the Evergreen Divine Tree held an extremely high status in the hearts of the Frost and Snow Clan; thus, he nodded and said, “I understand.”

Yu smiled again and continued, “You don’t have to worry so much, Shaman Niu. Senior Qing is very tolerant, so as long as you don’t deliberately desecrate him, my clansmen will not cause you any trouble.”

They gradually approached Frost and Snow City while they were speaking. Upon a closer look, the shock and awe of seeing the Evergreen Divine Tree became more and more intense. The entire Frost and Snow City was not guarded by city walls or Spirit Arrays like in the later generations, but the huge canopy created a secure enclosure surrounding several hundred kilometres. The clansmen of the Frost and Snow Clan had survived for generations under the protection of this canopy.

Even though it was in the middle of winter, there was no snow in Frost and Snow City; instead, it looked like it was the middle of spring.

An hour later, Yang Kai followed Yu across the boundary of Frost and Snow City when he abruptly felt a powerful Divine Sense sweep over him. This powerful probe instantly made all the hairs on his body stand in vigilance as he scanned his surroundings warily, only to find nothing.

Yu did not miss his change in demeanour and explained, “You don’t need to be so nervous, Shaman Niu. Anyone who enters Frost and Snow City will be inspected by Senior Qing. Only if they are hostile towards the Frost and Snow Clan will they be expelled.”

Yang Kai sighed in amazement, “Senior Qing is amazing.”

This was not flattery, but his true feelings, as that Divine Sense just now was measurably stronger than his Divine Sense at his peak. This Monster Tree was an incredible Master!

Yu smiled in agreement, “Of course! Senior Qing is the guardian of Frost and Snow Clan, who has been protecting us for thousands of years. But, it’s a pity…”

“What’s a pity?”

She said sadly, “I heard that Senior Qing fell asleep thousands of years ago; and now nobody can wake him up.”

“Then…” Yang Kai was puzzled. If Senior Qing was asleep, what was that Divine Sense just now?

Yu seemed to understand what he was thinking and smiled, “Even in his sleep, Senior Qing can still distinguish between friend and foe.”

[Isn’t that plain nonsense… If I were cultivating in retreat, I wouldn’t be able to feel anything unless it was a sense of crisis involving matters of life and death. No matter how great this Evergreen Divine Tree is, it’s still impossible to achieve such a degree of unconscious skill.] Still, Yang Kai made no objections to that statement since this seemed to be a strong belief among the Frost and Snow Clan.

While they were conversing with each other, they entered Frost and Snow City. The Ancient Barbarian Race Warriors were exhausted after such a long journey so they seemed a little excited now that they finally returned safely. They even had a faintly proud expression on their faces.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai unexpectedly felt extremely nostalgic when he stood inside Frost and Snow City. The sounds of yelling and bargaining ringing in his ears gave him the illusion that he had returned to Star Boundary for a moment.

“Shaman Niu, thank you for your help in White Net Mountain. We have to part ways here as I need to meet with a Shaman Master here and hand in the Snow Flowers,” Yu said, turning to Yang Kai.

“Go ahead. You don’t need to worry about me.” He nodded.

She then stretched out her hand to one of the Ancient Barbarian Race Warriors standing next to her. That warrior instantly took out a water skin-like thing and handed it to her. Yu took it and handed it to Yang Kai, “Take this to water the roots of Senior Qing, then you can find a place to live.”

Yang Kai raised his brow slightly as he recognized this water skin. When they were at White Net Mountain, the Frost and Snow Warriors had processed the Monster Beast corpses and used this water skin to collect Monster Beast blood. At that time, Yang Kai had not known what Yu and the others planned to do with this blood; however, now, it seemed as though it had some kind of special use here.
