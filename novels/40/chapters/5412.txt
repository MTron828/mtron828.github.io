As Yang Kai looked back, he realised it was inconceivable that he even managed to snatch a root from the World Tree. At that time, he was pretty weak as he wasn’t even an Open Heaven Realm Master yet. He had only condensed his Dao Seal and had yet to even refine all the necessary Powers.

On the other hand, the World Tree was an ancient existence born with the Universe. As time passed, it must have developed spirituality of its own and grown into a powerful being.

How was an Emperor Realm Master supposed to snatch a root from the World Tree? After he acquired the root, the World Tree just swept him to a faraway place, which showed that it was fully capable of dismissing him, it just didn’t bother to do so until after the fact.

If Cang’s speculation was right, Yang Kai was also one of the ways the unfathomable ‘rules’ tried to save themselves, which explained everything. The Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary was where the trials took place, and the root and the World Fruits were the rewards granted by the World Tree.

Millions of years ago, Cang and the other nine Martial Ancestors were selected and given World Fruits by the World Tree, thus allowing them to enter the Open Heaven Realm and teach the others how to do the same. When the Humans grew stronger, they were able to fight against the Monster Beasts and Mo itself.

Millions of years later, Yang Kai arrived at the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary and obtained a root from the World Tree. Even though the outcomes were different, they were both methods the 3,000 Worlds used to help themselves when they found themselves in crisis.

In that case, the original owner of the World Tree clone in Yang Kai’s Small Universe was likely also one of the ways the rules had selected to save themselves. Unfortunately, that Senior passed away on the Black Ink Battlefield, and his or her Small Universe was left behind as a Universe Cave Heaven. Countless years later, Yang Kai had the opportunity to enter it and obtain the World Tree clone.

Perhaps there were other people just like them over the eons; however, Yang Kai didn’t have a way to find out who they were, nor did he know whether they were even still alive.

Cang’s words were too shocking, but believable; after all, he had lived for millions of years and his life in this place gave him ample time to ponder on some deeper issues. Even though Yang Kai found his words inconceivable, it could very possibly be the truth.

“You must be careful,” Cang suddenly said.

A puzzled Yang Kai asked, “What do you mean, Senior?”

With a solemn expression, Cang explained, “Many years have passed, and Mo might have also realised what I’ve come to understand. Perhaps it even knows things that I don’t. If my speculation is right, you are in a perilous situation.”

Yang Kai was startled for a moment, but he soon realised what Cang meant.

If he was indeed one of the ways the ‘rules’ had selected to save themselves, he must be special in some way. As long as Mo noticed his presence, he wouldn’t let him off.

“You swaggered around the battlefield without worrying about getting corrupted by Black Ink Strength, so perhaps you’ve already caught Mo’s attention.”

Yang Kai replied, “The Four Universe Pillars are also able to protect one’s Small Universe and fend off Black Ink Strength. It might not realise that I have a World Tree clone.”

Cang nodded, “You have a point, but you still have to be careful. Also, even though you have the World Tree clone, which makes you immune to the Black Ink Strength of ordinary Black Ink Clansmen, that might not be able to drive off Mo’s Source Strength. Its strength is far greater than that of ordinary Black Ink Clansmen. Perhaps it might be able to break through the barriers of your Small Universe.”

Yang Kai said with a smile, “With you around, Mo won’t be able to get out of the trap, so how is it going to make a move against me? If even Senior is unable to suppress Mo, the Human Race won’t be far from extinction either way.”

The next moment, Yang Kai got to his feet and lifted his Azure Dragon Spear, “I’ve gotten enough rest, Senior. I’ll kill some more enemies before coming back to chat with you.”

Half a day later, Yang Kai returned, covered in blood. The Territory Lords chasing after him appeared furious, for the moment Yang Kai landed beside Cang, they had no choice but to leave. This time, he was in a better state than before, so it took him less time to recover.

After getting some rest, Yang Kai continued battling against the enemy. As he repeated this over and over again, the Black Ink Clansmen grew annoyed. Some of the Territory Lords now directly waited outside the safe zone on the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction so that they could kill Yang Kai the moment he left Cang’s shelter.

However, Yang Kai was a Master of the Dao of Space, so as long as the space around him wasn’t sealed, these Territory Lords had no way to capture him. Eventually, the Black Ink Clan stopped bothering with him, and without any restraints, Yang Kai was able to kill even more enemies.

Nevertheless, he was the only one capable of such things, as the other Humans were unable to imitate him. As they were not experts in the Dao of Space, they couldn’t cross the vast battlefield quickly and safely; therefore, only Yang Kai could run to Cang’s side to seek refuge and recuperate. Although he had made significant contributions, he was unable to single-handedly change the tide of battle.

Several months had passed since the war started, and 30% of the original 2 million Human soldiers had been killed in action. In other words, some 600,000 Human soldiers had lost their lives, all of them in the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm and above. The losses they had suffered were simply staggering.

There was no denying that the losses that the Black Ink Clan had suffered were dozens of times greater than those of the Humans as innumerable Territory Lords and Royal Lords had lost their lives. Still, even more Black Ink Clansmen continuously poured out from the opening and entered the battlefield to make up for the losses.

All the Humans were exhausted, and even the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters appeared weary. The two Races had been fighting against one another on the Black Ink Battlefield for many years, and although some wars lasted for months or even years, it was always a process of intense battles, followed by a period of rest and recovery before they clashed once again.

This time was different as the two Races had never stopped fighting since the war started. The chaos on the battlefield was constant. Fortunately, the various Army Commanders had already expected that this war would be a long one, so the 2 million soldiers were divided into two groups that took turns to battle the enemy. If not for this rotation of troops, the Humans would have been defeated by the Black Ink Clan long ago.

At this point, the Black Ink Clan had gained the upper hand. Although it wasn’t conspicuous, they were indeed in a favourable position. This was the balance Mo had been trying to sustain. Had it recklessly released all its servants to the battlefield, the Humans would’ve been defeated long ago.

Cang’s expression became increasingly solemn as he felt that it was time to seal the gap in the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. If this dragged on and the Humans were routed, the situation would surely get out of hand.

After months of releasing Black Ink Strength, he could feel that the pressure within the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction had been alleviated somewhat. Although it wouldn’t be as much as he hoped for if he stopped now, it was still acceptable. At the thought of this, he hesitated no more. As he performed a different hand seal, the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction started vibrating.

All of a sudden, Mo, who had remained silent all along, said, “I thought you were going to wait for a while more.”

Cang snorted, “You’d better quickly show us what tricks you still have; otherwise, you won’t have the chance to do so soon.”

Since the beginning, Cang had realised that Mo must have been holding something back; otherwise, it wouldn’t have tried to maintain the balance of powers between the two sides. It knew that once the balance was broken and the Humans were defeated, Cang would immediately seal the gap, giving it no chance to escape.

While the balance was being sustained, Cang was more than happy to weaken Mo’s power. It could be said that the situation on the battlefield was a tacit coordination between the two Races with the 2 million Human soldiers and the tens of millions of Black Ink Clansmen serving as chess pieces.

Cang also knew that once he started sealing the opening, there was no way Mo would sit idly by. There was bound to be a fierce fight where both sides did everything they could to gain the upper hand.

“You’ve grown old, Cang,” Mo let out a sigh of pity.

Even a cultivator as powerful as Cang had grown old after staying here for millions of years. As Mo recalled the days when it and the 10 Humans were still friends, it couldn’t help but feel rueful.

Those were the best days of its life. It could talk with his friends, travel with them, and share tea and wine together. It was carefree. Those days were gone for good once it was confined to this place. There wouldn’t be another Mu or Cang in this world.

It was fully aware that they didn’t hold any malicious intent trapping it in this place, but it was unresigned. It was born the way it was, it didn’t acquire its strength through cultivation. Since the Heavens had given it a power to turn others into the same beings as it, it was destined to rule over the Universe. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

As all its friends were gone for good, so it stopped having any pity for this world. Everyone was bound to be subservient to it.

“All of you have underestimated me!” As Mo roared, an immense force burst out of the endless darkness. A magnificent aura spread out and shocked both the Black Ink Clansmen and the Humans on the battlefield. It was a power that was so overwhelming that even the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were dazed by it.

All of a sudden, Cang had a bad premonition. After several months of intense fighting, countless Black Ink Clansmen had lost their lives on the battlefield. Black blood, Black Ink Strength, and severed limbs were everywhere in the void.

The moment Mo’s Will spread out, these miscellaneous scraps on the battlefield started squirming and shooting towards the same place as though they had been guided by a mysterious force.

The expressions of all of the Humans changed. That was because these miscellaneous things were moving towards the opening.

In just a moment, the black blood, Black Ink Strength, and the hashed flesh left behind from fallen Black Ink Clansmen formed a colossal dark tide. The dark tide crossed the battlefield, and along the way, some Human soldiers were accidentally swept into it and killed.

The entire universe trembled as the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction shook. Even more dark blood, Black Ink Strength, and smashed meat joined the dark tide and fortified it.

Besides that, even the Black Ink Clansmen, who had been dealing with the Humans, abandoned their opponents and dashed towards the dark tide before disappearing. The turn of events stunned the Humans. They had been in a disadvantageous position on the battlefield when they suddenly lost their opponents.

“Damn!” Cang exclaimed as he hadn’t expected that Mo was able to use such a move. In fact, even though the 10 of them were close friends with Mo in the past and they subsequently confined it to this place for millions of years, they didn’t really know its capabilities very well.
