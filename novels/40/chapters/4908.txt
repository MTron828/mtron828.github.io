At Myriad Demons Heaven’s temporary base, Yang Kai was naturally treated with great hospitality again, and after a feast, he was already quite drunk.

However, Mo Sha did not show up from beginning to the end. It was only when Yu Ru Meng proposed to pay her respects to her Honoured Master at the time of departure that they were brought to him.

The two entered hand in hand into an empty hall. The door to the hall slammed shut behind them.

A figure covered by Demon Qi sat cross-legged in the center of the hall. The turbulent Demon Qi, thick enough to seem like a viscous liquid, surrounded Mo Sha Divine Monarch.

“Honoured Master!” Yu Ru Meng bowed and greeted respectfully.

Yang Kai followed suit.

Mo Sha opened his eyes and raised his hand. With a gentle flick, the two of them rose.

Mo Sha kept his hand up and pointed a finger towards Yang Kai.

Both Yu Ru Meng and Yang Kai did not expect Mo Sha to suddenly make such a move, so they were caught off guard when the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master took action.

Yang Kai was hit by the flick of a finger and stumbled backward several steps with a muffled grunt.

“Honoured Master!” Yu Ru Meng was shocked and quickly ran over to Yang Kai. She knew that there was a grudge between Yang Kai and Myriad Demons Heaven, and was worried Mo Sha was going to harm Yang Kai.

Yang Kai placed his hand on Yu Ru Meng’s shoulder and pulled her behind him before he firmly shook his head to signal that he was alright.

After that finger flick, his eyes burned as if they were on fire, and in the next instant, his left eye suddenly turned golden, with a vertical slit, while his right eye became pitch black.

At first glance, it looked as if the right eye had been stained by the Black Ink Strength, but this was different. It was a Secret Technique.

“Demon Eye of Annihilation and Black Purgatory Eye!” Mo Sha nodded lightly and stood up. With his hands behind his back, he stepped in front of Yang Kai and carefully examined his two eyes to make sure they were correct, then narrowed his eyes and asked, “Was Ti Zheng killed by you?”

After asking this though, Mo Sha shook his head and said, “No. Although Ti Zheng’s cultivation was decent, he had not cultivated these two Eye Techniques. My Myriad Demons Heaven’s two Core Techniques cannot be cultivated by just anyone.”

Yang Kai endured the discomfort in both eyes and said hastily, “So, Divine Monarch had already noticed.”

Of all the Cave Heavens and Paradises, the reason why Yang Kai was most wary of Myriad Demons Heaven was not because he initially had some grudges with them, but because of these two Eye Techniques.

At that time, when he was outside of the Shattered Heaven, Ti Zheng noticed that he had these two Eye Techniques and was very concerned about them. He even offered to buy his two eyes. Of course, Yang Kai did not agree.

Before that day, Yang Kai had never shown these two Eye Techniques to Ti Zheng.

Yet Ti Zheng was aware of them. It could be that the people of Myriad Demons Heaven were sensitive to those who had these two Eye Techniques.

Ti Zheng was only a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master; thus, Mo Sha, who was in the Eighth-Order, was much stronger than him.

During the days spent in Black Territory, Yang Kai had intentionally avoided all the High-Rank Masters from Myriad Demons Heaven just to avoid causing any trouble. The last time, when he came to welcome the bride, Mo Sha did not say anything, so Yang Kai thought he had gotten away with it. However, now it seemed that, although he did not say anything, that did not mean that Mo Sha did not notice.

Yang Kai did not know what Mo Sha had done to cause the two Eye Techniques to involuntarily reveal themselves, but at the moment he had no way of hiding them.

Mo Sha’s eyes twitched slightly and his left eye instantly turned golden, with a vertical slit, while his right eye turned pitch black like a black hole. At that moment, Yang Kai felt an excruciating pain.

In a flash though, Mo Sha’s eyes returned to normal again.

Then it dawned upon Yang Kai that this person in front of him also cultivated these two Eye Techniques, and it seemed that he was much more skilled at using them. As such, it was not surprising that he could detect others who cultivated them.

“These two Eye Techniques are core secrets of Myriad Demons Heaven. Even ordinary disciples are unable to obtain them. Where did you get them from?” Mo Sha asked curiously.

He thought that Yang Kai had killed Ti Zheng and took them from him; however, Ti Zheng had not cultivated these two Eye Techniques so that was impossible.

Since they were in this situation, it was meaningless for Yang Kai to hide things from Mo Sha. Moreover, he would be going to seal the Void Corridor soon, so Mo Sha would not harm him. Yang Kai figured he might as well come clean.

He thus went ahead and told the story of how he managed to obtain his two eyes.

Mo Sha listened with amazement, not having expected the whole process to be so full of twists and turns.

Yang Kai’s Demon Eye of Annihilation was obtained very early on in life, back in Tong Xuan Realm, while the Black Purgatory Eye came much later.

These two seemingly unrelated Eye Techniques were actually from the same source. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Mo Sheng…” Mo Sha frowned and muttered to himself. He had never heard of this name, but according to Yang Kai’s story, it could be deduced that this person should be from a long time ago. Mo Sha wondered what happened to this ancient disciple. To arrive in a remote Universe World, experience a massive drop in cultivation and become confined to that Universe World, then contaminate the world into becoming the Demon Realm.

If not for a series of coincidences, Mo Sheng could have contacted Myriad Demons Heaven and asked for help to take him back to the Sect long ago.

“This was how it happened, and the two Eye Techniques were obtained by chance. It was not something Junior did on purpose.”

Mo Sha looked at him and said, “Whether it was an opportunity or an intentional act, these are still core secrets of Myriad Demons Heaven.”

Yang Kai asked, “Then what does the Divine Monarch want?”

Yu Ru Meng could not help but become nervous. She was the one who said that they should return to their ‘families’ after the wedding. If Yang Kai was in danger now because of this, she would inevitably feel guilty.

Now she understood why a Senior Sister of Myriad Demons Heaven suddenly came looking for her one day. She then got her thinking about going back to the Sect after the wedding.

It was now obvious that Mo Sha, this cheap Honoured Master of hers, wanted to meet her Husband to confirm certain matters. Returning to her bridal family after the wedding was just an excuse.

Mo Sha slowly said, “Since this is a core secret of Myriad Demons Heaven, naturally it cannot be passed on. I can either destroy your eyes, or you can become a Myriad Demons Heaven’s disciple, so that you have the right to retain them.”

Yu Ru Meng forced a smile and said, “Honoured Master, even if my Husband is not a disciple of Myriad Demons Heaven, he is already Myriad Demons Heaven’s Son-in-Law. He can now be considered as one of Myriad Demons Heaven’s people.”

Mo Sha shook his head and said, “That’s not the same.”

Yu Ru Meng was about to speak when Yang Kai raised his hand to stop her and stared at Mo Sha. He then said, “It is impossible for me to become a Myriad Demons Heaven disciple, and I don’t want to lose my eyes either; after all, I do not know if I will become blind after they are destroyed. Divine Monarch, is there any other choice?”

“What choice do you want?” Mo Sha looked at him with a smile.

“How about Divine Monarch pretends not to know about this?” Yang Kai raised a brow.

Mo Sha almost laughed and said, “Do you think that’s possible?”

Yang Kai spread his hands and said openly, “If that’s the case, then Divine Monarch will have to kill me!”

Mo Sha face twitched and roared, “You think I won’t kill you?”

Yang Kai snorted, “If Divine Monarch kills me, your new Disciple will be widowed!”

Yu Ru Meng nodded vigorously from the side and begged, “Please be merciful, Honoured Master.”

Mo Sha said, “We have been fighting with the Black Ink Clan on the Black Ink Battlefield for countless years, and countless others have died. We already have tens of thousands of widows.”

This topic was getting a bit heavy.

Yang Kai thought for a while, then turned his head to look at a worried Yu Ru Meng, and said, “Do not be afraid, Divine Monarch is just intimidating me. I still have to go to seal the Void Corridor. He will not do anything to me.”

Yu Ru Meng was very worried, but was reassured when she heard what Yang Kai said. Yang Kai volunteered to seal the Void Corridor, and there was no one else in the 3,000 Worlds capable of doing it in his place, so how could Mo Sha kill him?

If he did, there would be no way for him to explain himself to the other Cave Heavens and Paradises.

Yang Kai turned his head to Mo Sha and said, “Divine Monarch, just state exactly what you want. There’s no need to drag this matter out further.”

Mo Sha grunted in frustration. Yang Kai’s smug look was truly annoying. He was really tempted to give this cheeky brat a slap and snuff him out once and for all.

However, just as Yang Kai had said, that was not an option.

Moreover, when he asked Yang Kai to come here today, his original intention was not to make things difficult for him.

After a moment of contemplation, Mo Sha suddenly flicked his wrist and a jade slip flew towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai raised his hand to catch the slip and then poured his Divine Sense into it. He frowned a moment later and asked, “Divine Monarch, what is this…”

“The Black Ink Battlefield is extremely dangerous. Your Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm cultivation is far too low. It’s also too late to start raising your cultivation. The Cave Heavens and Paradises owe you a favour. Myriad Demons Heaven has nothing of value to give you, but since you are lucky to have obtained these two Eye Techniques, then you should cultivate them properly,” Mo Sha said, “Myriad Demons Heaven’s two Great Eye Techniques have untold secrets and infinite power. You must be diligent when cultivating them!

“Many thanks, Divine Monarch!” Yang Kai was overjoyed.

“Leave!” Mo Sha waved his hand impatiently. To him, today’s incident was making a mountain out of a molehill. This situation was special and he did not want to pursue it any further.

Yang Kai and Yu Ru Meng bowed and bade farewell to Mo Sha.

On the way back from Myriad Demons Heaven, Yu Ru Meng took the time to inquire what Mo Sha had given to Yang Kai.

“The cultivation method for the two Eye Techniques,” Yang Kai explained.

Since he received the two Eye Techniques, although their power had increased alongside his own cultivation, Yang Kai had never really practiced them properly, let alone understood how to use them.

Now that Mo Sha took the initiative to give him the knowledge to cultivate them, this was an excellent development for Yang Kai.

It was a great gift.

Both the Demon Eye of Annihilation and Black Purgatory Eye were core secrets of Myriad Demons Heaven. In Myriad Demons Heaven, ordinary disciples were not worthy to cultivate them at all. Only elite disciples were fortunate enough to practice one of them, with very few being able to cultivate both.

Under normal circumstances, if an outsider like Yang Kai had these two Secret Techniques, Myriad Demons Heaven would definitely fight him to the death and would ruthlessly kill him to prevent their secrets from leaking out.

However, the situation was different now. Yang Kai would soon go to seal the Void Corridor and his fate was uncertain. Mo Sha would not be insistent under such circumstances.
