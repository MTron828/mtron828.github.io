“Since Martial Uncle Zuo is being so hospitable, then your Martial Nephew won’t stand on ceremony with you!” Wu Kuang grinned maliciously as he sat down cross-legged and activated his Heaven Devouring Battle Law. Immediately after, his body seemingly transformed into a bottomless pit as the World Force in the surroundings swirled towards him.

In an extremely short period of time, Wu Kuang had pushed his Heaven Devouring Battle Law to its limit and devoured all of the nearby World Force! Wu Kuang couldn’t help the look of glee that appeared on his face, feeling the endless stream of pure energy.

His expression gave the impression of a perverted hungry ghost holding a warm and fragrant body, as if he could devour it body and soul!

When others were pulled into this Small Universe by Zuo Quan Hui, they could only use everything they had to wreak as much destruction as possible. This was even true for someone as strong as Yang Kai, but Wu Kuang was different. He could devour the Small Universe’s foundation directly and strengthen himself in the process.

Zuo Quan Hui had not expected this, and this was his biggest mistake.

He thought that Wu Kuang had advanced to the Sixth-Order from the Fifth-Order during the last battle, but he had no idea that Wu Kuang had reached the Sixth-Order long ago. It was just that he had been carefully hiding his Sixth-Order cultivation to the end in order to track down Zuo Quan Hui and inform Yang Kai.

They might not have discussed any plans beforehand, but Wu Kuang was sure that Yang Kai understood his thoughts, and Yang Kai was sure that Wu Kuang understood his. To a certain extent, their hearts were connected.

Destruction and devouring were two completely different things. The reckless destruction Yang Kai and his friends had caused to the Small Universe would undoubtedly bring great damage to Zuo Quan Hui’s foundation, but their efficiency was far lower than Wu Kuang’s.

The Small Universe’s foundation began to rapidly deplete as the devouring took place! On the other hand, Wu Kuang’s aura gradually grew stronger.

Yang Kai could clearly feel that Zuo Quan Hui’s interference with him had taken a huge dive and laughed loudly as he continued to bombard his surroundings, “You finally noticed? But what to do? It’s too late!”

A figure suddenly appeared not far from Yang Kai. It was none other than Zuo Quan Hui, who had been hiding all this time. At this moment, this High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master’s face was slightly pale and he was fuming in rage. He raised his long sword and asked, pointing it at Yang Kai and glaring at him, “You knew this was going to happen!?”

Yang Kai thrust his spear towards him, blotting the sky with spear shadows, his face beaming with joy as he taunted, “Guess!”

Zuo Quan Hui’s figure did not move, but an enormous sword wave shot forward, shattering the spear shadows and heading straight towards Yang Kai. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Yang Kai quickly retreated, blocking that enormous sword wave that spanned across the sky, but the next moment, his heart suddenly clenched as he threw himself to the ground.

A bolt of lightning came rumbling from behind, brushing past his scalp, burning a few strands of his hair.

Yang Kai stood back up again, but he had broken into a cold sweat. It was indeed difficult to fight with someone inside their Small Universe, not to mention that this opponent was a High-Rank Master. Although Zuo Quan Hui had not fully recovered from his injuries, a starving camel was still bigger than a horse.

But he had no choice but to fight on!

“Who are you? You are definitely not a Myriad Demons Heaven disciple!”

On another side, Wu Kuang was no longer able to calmly continue devouring in peace. In fact, when he activated his Heaven Devouring Battle Law, Zuo Quan Hui appeared before him out of thin air, slashing at him.

Wu Kuang was so flustered that he quickly counterattacked and fled. However, after exchanging blows with Zuo Quan Hui, Wu Kuang discovered that there was something wrong with this Zuo Quan Hui. He didn’t appear to be real, but more like a projection; he also didn’t have the strength of a Seventh-Order Master.

Wu Kuang might be fleeing in panic at the sight of Zuo Quan Hui chasing after him, but he was not completely helpless.

He realized that Zuo Quan Hui could not divert too much attention to his side, which was why he was so weak. Having realized this, Wu Kuang greatly calmed down. While running around in circles, he circulated his Heaven Devouring Battle Law, greedily devouring the surrounding World Force. There was a malicious grin hanging on his face as he responded, “Of course I’m a Myriad Demons Heaven disciple, why is Martial Uncle Zuo asking such a question?”

Zuo Quan Hui didn’t appear to have taken any action, but he appeared in front of Wu Kuang like a ghost and gently thrust out his sword. Had Wu Kuang not been constantly changing his position, it would have been next to impossible to avoid this sword strike for him.

“Myriad Demons Heaven definitely does not have such an evil technique, what kind of Secret Art are you cultivating!?” Zuo Quan Hui shouted, gnashing his teeth as a sliver of fear could be seen in his eyes. He had never seen such an evil technique before, and much to his surprise, it could actually swallow his Small Universe’s foundation and make use of it. This kind of Secret Art went against the Heavens. If everyone could cultivate it, it would not be this difficult to break through to the Open Heaven Realm.

Among the dozen or so Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters he had pulled into his Small Universe, Yang Kai’s was undoubtedly the strongest, but if there was anyone who posed the greatest threat to him, it would be this Myriad Demons Heaven disciple before him!

Even now, Zuo Quan Hui still couldn’t understand why Myriad Demons Heaven’s own men would ambush him!

Meanwhile, Zuo Quan Hui’s projection also appeared in front of the other Sixth-Order Masters of Void Land. Be that as it may, these projections weren’t very strong at all; they were at most on par with their respective opponents, some of them even slightly weaker. Occasionally, they would launch a fierce attack, but it was clearly not working. Obviously, Zuo Quan Hui was too distracted to control them all.

At first, everyone was shocked by Zuo Quan Hui’s sudden appearance. Even a sickly tiger was quite fierce, so no one was confident facing a Seventh-Order Master.

But after exchanging a few blows, they discovered the truth and no longer panicked.

The dozen or so battlefields were like a raging wildfire. Each time they clashed, they would cause damage to Zuo Quan Hui’s Small Universe to a certain extent, whereas Wu Kuang was constantly using his Heaven Devouring Battle Law to devour Zuo Quan Hui’s foundation.

Yang Kai’s several thousand metres tall Half-Dragon Form was riddled with wounds and had many places where his Dragon Scales were blown off, a shocking sight to behold. Zuo Quan Hui had placed most of his attention on him, giving Yang Kai a really hard time. Although his life was in no danger, being constantly suppressed was not very enjoyable.

Be that as it may, Yang Kai was more than happy to see this status quo maintained. The longer this dragged on, the more disadvantageous it would be for Zuo Quan Hui, and once he reached his limit, he would lose for sure!

Zuo Quan Hui was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so how could he fail to realize this? He was thinking of taking down Yang Kai first and then deal with the others one by one. As long as Yang Kai died, it did not matter how many Sixth-Order Masters Void Land had.

But after a while, he realized that it was easier said than done. Even if he could push Yang Kai into a corner, he wouldn’t be defeated so easily.

Since things had come to this, he could only change his strategy.

As the two figures clashed, Yang Kai’s spear struck Zuo Quan Hui’s figure, but no blood flowed out. Yang Kai wasn’t surprised either; he had already noticed that Zuo Quan Hui wasn’t a real entity, but a lifelike projection.

Suddenly, Yang Kai raised his spear and looked around, but he could not spot Zuo Quan Hui. Even his barrage of attacks which had never ceased had stopped.

Yang Kai’s heart clenched.

This undoubtedly meant that Zuo Quan Hui had no intention of hounding him and had instead focused his attention elsewhere. And on Void Land’s side, Wu Kuang was the biggest threat to Zuo Quan Hui.

Wu Kuang was in danger!

Although Yang Kai could take this opportunity to vandalize Zuo Quan Hui’s Small Universe, Wu Kuang would probably be killed by Zuo Quan Hui in less than ten breaths.

Yang Kai instantly spread out his Divine Sense, but he couldn’t sense anyone’s aura, let alone find Wu Kuang’s location. Zuo Quan Hui’s aura was all around him and disrupting him.

[What should I do to get out of this?] Yang Kai asked himself. He couldn’t save Wu Kuang if he couldn’t find him.

Furthermore, once Zuo Quan Hui killed Wu Kuang and the others, he could not be stopped.

And Yang Kai would definitely not be able to completely destroy Zuo Quan Hui’s Small Universe before then.

After a moment of consideration, Yang Kai slammed the Azure Dragon Spear into the ground and pressed his palms together before fiercely pulling them away from each other, as if he was trying to separate the whole world, shouting word by word, “Heaven and Earth, open!”

His Small Universe rapidly rotated before it suddenly manifested!

The reason why Zuo Quan Hui was able to manifest his Small Universe was because his Small Universe had already turned tangible. This was a trump card that could only be displayed by a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master. Ordinary Sixth-Order Masters would not be able to do such a thing.

However, Yang Kai was able to do so, because his Small Universe had materialized from the very beginning!

Yang Kai had no idea what the consequences of doing so would be; after all, he had never tried something like this ever before, but he knew that if he didn’t do so, Wu Kuang would die without a doubt, and then the others would follow suit.

Yang Kai’s Small Universe instantly spread out and he suddenly felt as if he had stepped into a whole new world.

He could clearly feel that his Small Universe was now nested inside Zuo Quan Hui’s Small Universe, and the two Small Universes were overlapping each other, one within in the other.

The bigger one belonged to Zuo Quan Hui, while the smaller one belonged to him!

An extremely uncomfortable feeling coursed through Yang Kai’s body. He felt as if he was trapped in a cage and was being squeezed from every possible direction, causing him to let out a muffled groan.

But the next moment, Yang Kai sensed the auras and locations of the others.

He knew everything within his Small Universe like the back of his hand!

Wu Kuang was indeed hanging by a thread; one of his arms limply hanging, connected only by skin and muscles. His body was covered in blood as he desperately tried to escape from Zuo Quan Hui’s assault!

In the moment of life and death, he no longer had the time to use the Heaven Devouring Battle Law to devour energy. All he could focus on was preserving his life!

Zuo Quan Hui was everywhere, his sword following him like a shadow. Just when it looked that Wu Kuang was about to die, Zuo Quan Hui’s movements suddenly became sluggish.

As Yang Kai’s Small Universe spread out, he felt extremely uncomfortable, as if he was trapped in a cage, but Zuo Quan Hui did not feel good either. In contrast, he felt like his Small Universe had become bloated, like he had eaten far too much. He even found circulating his World Force a little difficult.

Otherwise, there wouldn’t have been such a slight pause just now.

With such a good opportunity before him, Wu Kuang was finally able to escape from the jaws of death. Fear was clearly visible on his face.

Zuo Quan Hui didn’t give chase and instead gazed around with a look of shock hanging on his face.

Yang Kai’s figure suddenly appeared out of thin air, alongside the dozen or so other Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters.

Everyone had gathered! The others obviously hadn’t realized what was happening, but since they were together again, it was better than fighting on their own.

They looked at each other, and seeing that they had not lost anyone, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

“You’re only a Sixth-Order, how could you possibly manifest your Small Universe?” Zuo Quan Hui stared at Yang Kai in disbelief.

“None of your damn business!” Yang Kai raised his spear and pointed it at him with an arrogant and unyielding look on his face, suppressing the surging blood in his heart.

“Your Small Universe has become tangible when you are only in the Sixth-Order, you really are a rare genius!” Zuo Quan Hui sighed.

Yang Kai sneered, “Don’t think that you can save your life just by some ass-kissing. Today, you are going to die, no matter how unwilling you are!”

Zuo Quan Hui suddenly smiled and stated, “Now that our Small Universes are overlapping, if one of us suffers, we both suffer. This Monarch wants to see how you will kill me now!”
