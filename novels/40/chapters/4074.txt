Zhu Jiu Yin was furious, “You say your requirements are not high, but do you know what it means to ask for something in the Seventh Order or above?”

“What does it mean?” Yang Kai asked meekly.

Zhu Jiu Yin snorted, “It means an existence at a similar level to this Queen must be killed, and their Monster Core taken. If you really wish to do so, then this Queen can point you in a direction. Head west a million kilometres from here. There’s an annoying guy there called Jin Wu. Kill him and take his Monster Core. It will be a treasure of at least the Eighth Order.”

Cold sweat slid down Yang Kai’s forehead, “Senior must be joking.”

That Jin Wu must also be a Divine Spirit. If Yang Kai really had the ability to kill him, would he need to act meek and respectful in front of Zhu Jiu Yin? He would have put her in her place long ago.

“Junior does not necessarily need a Divine Spirit’s Monster Core for his Metal Element treasure. Are there no other suitable treasures here in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary?”

“There used to be some.” Zhu Jiu Yin had a reminiscent look on her face, “But they are all gone.”

“How come?” Yang Kai was confused.

“You are not the only guests we have had here in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. If there was anything good, then would those bastards not have taken them away already? Do you think they would leave it for you? If you are looking for treasures in the Seventh Order and above, then the only way you can get them is by killing Divine Spirits and taking their Monster Cores.”

Yang Kai was dumbfounded, but on second thought, it did make sense. Even though the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary was a huge natural treasure trove, they were not the only visitors who had come here through the countless years. Why should those Senior Experts leave anything for their Juniors when they came here? If there was anything good, they would have taken them away a long time ago.

The reason he was able to get his hands on the Earth Attribute Dragon Bead was because of his bloodline’s perception, and naturally, the Moon Essence was the Sea Clan’s Sacred Treasure, which was looked after by Kun Sha. Getting his hands on a Metal Element treasure was probably going to be difficult.

“Why do you seek treasures in the Seventh Order or above?” Zhu Jiu Yin looked at Yang Kai in confusion, “I know you Humans cultivate by condensing a Dao Seal in your bodies, and then condensing Yin, Yang, and Five Elements to reach the Open Heaven Realm. If you seek Seventh-Order materials, does that mean you are aiming to reach the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm with your initial breakthrough?”

“Exactly.” Yang Kai nodded solemnly, “Junior has high aspirations and is seeking to reach the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm, exactly as Senior says.”

Zhu Jiu Yin blinked her eyes for a moment and laughed, “You’re the most ambitious Human I’ve met.”

Yang Kai keenly grasped onto a clue, “Has Senior had a Bearer in the past?”

Zhu Jiu Yin was surprised, “You know about the Bearers?”

“It’s not a secret, is it?” Yang Kai smiled and pretended to be well-learned.

Zhu Jiu Yin observed him, “Your heritage is not bad, so you must come from an extraordinary background. It is not surprising that you know this.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Grabbing onto the opportunity to get out of this cage is why Junior seeks benefits from Senior. Only when Junior is strong will he be able to compete with the others and take the top spot!”

“That is reasonable.” Zhu Jiu Yin nodded, “But if you want a Metal Element treasure in the Seventh Order or above, then there is nothing I can do to help. However, I do have plenty of Sixth-Order materials.”

Yang Kai was speechless. He also had Sixth-Order treasures. Yuan Magnetic Divine Stones alone, he had several dozen pieces of them, and his Yuan Magnetic Divine Bottle Gourd was also holding much Sixth-Order Yuan Magnetic Divine Light. If he were willing to use Sixth-Order materials, then why would he have to ask Zhu Jiu Yin for help?

“I’ll tell you what,” Zhu Jiu Yin said after pondering for a while, “First, condense your Water Element Power. Meanwhile, I will have someone poke around for a Metal Element treasure for you. There might be something left behind, and if there is, I will find it for you.”

Yang Kai did not understand, “How will I condense my Water Element without first condensing my Metal Element?”

Zhu Jiu Yin laughed, “Naturally, ordinary people can only condense the Five Elements in order; however, this Queen has a wonderful technique that can allow you to ignore this order and condense them in any order you wish.”

Yang Kai was stunned, “Such a technique exists in this world?”

Yue He and Lu Xue were both also surprised. They were Fourth and Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, and could already be considered knowledgeable, but they had never heard of the existence of such a Secret Art before.

If such a technique truly existed, then would it not be a breakthrough in the cultivation techniques formed through countless ages in the Outer Universe? If such a thing were to appear in the world, then it would certainly set off a reign of terror.

Zhu Jiu Yin spoke faintly, “It did not used to exist, but this Queen had a Bearer with amazing ingenuity who created this technique. He was in the same situation as you back then, lacking materials for his next Element, even though he had resources for the one after that. Helpless, he had no choice but to skip over the order. But I must tell you that though this is a profound technique, and even somewhat fantastical, it comes with some risks. If your heritage is not deep enough, the Five Elements Powers could riot and destroy your Dao Seal. When that time comes, your cultivation will be lost at best, and at worst you will die. Do you still want to learn?”

“Junior is willing!” Yang Kai nodded. No matter the risk, learning the technique first was never a wrong idea. If it were truly impossible, he could just choose not to cultivate it. He was still young anyway and had a long future ahead of him. There was no need for him to rush things.

Zhu Jiu Yin nodded and gently lifted a finger, pressing it onto Yang Kai’s forehead.

Yang Kai’s body shuddered. Then, he felt immense information pouring into his mind, causing him to freeze in place for a while.

After a long time, his body suddenly shook, and he came back to his senses. He had a look of admiration on his face as he muttered, “The one who created this technique is truly a genius.”

This technique was called the Defying Yin-Yang Five Elements Profound Universe Heart Scripture. If one were to condense their Yin, Yang, and Five Elements through this method, they would simply not have to care about the order at all, meaning they could cultivate however they wished.

However, the impact of the Powers on one’s Dao Seal when condensed through this method was far greater compared to normal. If one’s Dao Seal was not firm enough, then cultivating this way simply would not work. That was the risk that Zhu Jiu Yin told him about.

But there were still some advantages to condensing one’s Yin, Yang, and Five Elements in this manner and that was that once a cultivator broke through to the Open Heaven Realm, their strength would be slightly higher than normal.

That was because the Dao Seal had withstood much stronger impacts, leading to a more solid foundation, which others naturally could not compete against.

Yang Kai was very impressed. Zhu Jiu Yin had told him that it was one of her Bearers that developed this technique, so it can be seen how amazing that Bearer was.

But what confused Yang Kai was why that Bearer, despite his amazing achievements, was unable to bring Zhu Jiu Yin out of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary.

Seemingly noticing Yang Kai’s question, Zhu Jiu Yin answered, “That man died in the Spirit Seizing War. If not, with his aptitude, how could this Queen still be trapped here?”

Yang Kai gulped, “Did he die because of this technique?”

“No. Actually, this technique was created by the two of us and perfected to the greatest degree possible. He died because he became the tree that rose too far above the forest. He was surrounded by the other Bearers and killed.”

Yang Kai nodded. With this, he could rest easy. Since someone was able to successfully cultivate this Defying Yin-Yang Five Elements Profound Universe Heart Scripture, then he would certainly be able to do it as well.

There was no reason for him not to follow the path developed by the Seniors before him.

He was eager to learn the mysteries of this profound technique, so not bothering to continue chatting with Zhu Jiu Yin any further, Yang Kai excused himself and retreated to his room to cultivate.

Day after day, month after month passed.

The Defying Yin-Yang Five Elements Profound Universe Heart Scripture was so profound that Yang Kai had to study it for half a year before gaining any insight. Even so, he did not dare try it rashly.

The Moon Essence’s Order was very high; after all, it was an Innate Supreme Treasure. If he did not have complete confidence in success, then forcibly condensing it would only damage his Dao Seal.

Even if Yang Kai wanted to try it, then there were two other key points.

One is that the Five Elements Powers couldn’t be harmonized as usual. Normally, he should first condense his Metal Element before condensing the Water Element, but now, without a suitable Metal Element treasure, the Five Elements were bound to be somewhat disordered, so he had to harmonise them with the Defying Yin-Yang Five Elements Profound Universe Heart Scripture, which would solve the problem. This Defying Yin-Yang Five Elements Profound Universe Heart Scripture was created just for moments like these.

The greatest problem came if one’s Dao Seal was not firm enough. Yang Kai was uniquely blessed to have been able to condense the essence of the Immortal Tree to form his Wood Element Power, which laid a solid foundation for himself and also helped to suppress the Fire Element Power he condensed. There was no need to mention the Earth Element Power from the Earth Dragon Bead as he too possessed a Divine Dragon Source, so there was no danger in him condensing it. But if he now wanted to condense his Water Element Power out of order, his Dao Seal was still not rigid enough to withstand it.

Yang Kai had no choice but to leave his room and seek Zhu Jiu Yin’s advice.

He believed that the previous Bearer should have encountered a similar experience. Since her previous Bearer accomplished his training, he must have been able to solve this problem.

After hearing what Yang Kai had to say, Zhu Jiu Yin casually tossed a jade bottle to him.

Yang Kai accepted it and opened the bottle while asking in confusion, “What is this?”

Zhu Jiu Yin answered lazily, “I don’t know what it is, either, but that brat called it Divine Dao Water.” The brat that Zhu Jiu Yin spoke of must be the Bearer who created the Defying Yin-Yang Five Elements Profound Universe Heart Scripture.

“Divine Dao Water!?” Yue He and Lu Xue at the side exclaimed in unison, their beautiful faces turning pale.

Zhu Jiu Yin turned her head and shot them a glance. Even Yang Kai had turned to look at them, “Is this item well-known?”

Her understanding of the Outer Universe was lacking, so she naturally had no idea what the value of this Divine Dao Water was.

Yue He quickly explained, “It’s a very good item. A real treasure!”

Lu Xue also nodded vigorously and looked at the jade bottle in Yang Kai’s hand with great enthusiasm.

Yang Kai raised his brow as he listened, “Since this was a reward from Senior, then it must be something good, but what is its use?”

Yue He explained, “To strengthen one’s Dao Seal! You must know that a cultivator’s aptitude has limits, and the fundamental manifestation of that is their Dao Seal. Condensing Third-Order Elements is the limit for some people, but others can condense Sixth-Order Elements. This is the difference between the limits of each cultivator’s Dao Seal. Each Dao Seal is condensed in a person’s own body, so once it is formed, it cannot be easily changed. So, the forming of one’s Dao Seal basically predetermines a person’s future achievements. But with Divine Dao Water, it’s possible to go a step further.”

“By strengthening one’s Dao Seal with this Divine Water, one can condense Yin, Yang and Five Elements of Higher-Orders, surpassing one’s original limits?” Yang Kai seemed to be able to understand, and was overjoyed to hear this.

“En,” Yue He nodded. She was able to achieve the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm back then, meaning that her Dao Seal’s limit was being able to withstand the impact of Fifth-Order Elements, but if she had the help of the Divine Dao Water at that time, then reaching the Sixth-Order would be no problem, provided she was able to collect enough Sixth-Order materials.

Only, Divine Dao Water was extremely rare. After countless years, legends of people obtaining Divine Dao Water had only appeared a handful of times in the 3,000 Worlds.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
