Half of the whole Northern Territory was covered with ice and snow, and with Ice Attribute Secret Arts being the core inheritance of Ice Heart Valley, Bing Yun naturally chose a cold environment like this to establish her Sect.

Although Xiao Ling’er had begun to cultivate, she was still young and weak, so it was normal for her to feel cold.

“Young Master Yang… can Ling’er really join Ice Heart Valley?” Old Ban asked uneasily from the side.

Although he noticed that Yang Kai had an unusual relationship with Ice Heart Valley, otherwise he could not just come and go through this Space Array, Old Ban was still quite concerned about the matter related to Xiao Ling’er’s future.

“Don’t worry, it’s absolutely no problem for her to join Ice Heart Valley, but how much she can achieve in the future will depend on her own efforts and opportunities,” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

“I’m not expecting her to have exceptional achievements. As long as she is safe and happy, that is enough.” After listening to Yang Kai’s reply, Old Ban sighed in relief, slightly delighted.

Previously, in the melting pot of people from different backgrounds of the desolate city, every time Old Ban went out to guide people through the Ancient Lands Passageway, he would constantly worry for Xiao Ling’er’s safety. But if he did not lead the way for people, they would not have been able to survive.

It would be great if his little girl could join Ice Heart Valley, as he would no longer have to live such a precarious life.

“Ice Moon City is not far away from Ice Heart Valley, and it is run by Ice Heart Valley…”

While waiting for the war to end, Yang Kai chatted with Old Ban and told him about the situation in Ice Heart Valley. Old Ban was greatly relieved after learning that Ice Moon City was not far from Ice Heart Valley.

This way, if ever Xiao Ling’er missed him or he missed Xiao Ling’er in the future, it would not be too troublesome for them to meet. He just needed to find somewhere to live in the Ice Moon City, and he did not need to worry about Xiao Ling’er anymore.

As they chatted, the noise outside gradually died down, replaced by a burst of cheers from many women spread across the fields.

It was obvious that Ice Heart Valley had achieved a great victory, and now the disciples were celebrating.

It was a miracle that seven thousand disciples could win against a force of a hundred thousand.

*Weng weng weng… *

Strange noises buzzed from all directions a moment later as clouds of black insects rushed into the Ice Lake Island from various locations in Ice Heart Valley.

When Yang Kai saw this, he took out his Insect Enslavement Bracelet and put all these Soul Devouring Demon Insects into it.

The Soul Devouring Insects had contributed greatly to the war today. Earlier, when Yang Kai arrived in Ice Heart Valley, he released all his Soul Devouring Demon Insects and ordered them to kill all the enemies.

With the current strength of his Soul Devouring Insects, even though they could not help Yang Kai out in higher level fights, they were quite handy in such large-scale battles.

Without the shelter of Emperor Realm Masters, no one in the hundred thousand scattered troops could resist the might of Yang Kai’s Soul Devouring Demon Insects, so wherever the black cloud of insects passed, Seeking Passion Sect troops fell like reaped wheat.

With the offensive power of the Soul Devouring Insects, the defensive strength of the Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation, and the assistance of several Ice Heart Valley Emperors and three Monster Kings, the victory of Ice Heart Valley was an inevitable outcome.

“Young Master Yang, Young Master Yang…”

Just then, a cry came from outside.

“Young Master Yang, someone seems to be looking for you,” Old Ban glanced over.

“Ignore him.” Yang Kai curled his lips and continued to talk with Old Ban.

Old Ban read his face and did not question further, although Old Ban did not know why Yang Kai looked like he was being cold to that person.

A moment later, Nanmen Da Jun finally flew over and landed in front of Yang Kai, hurriedly cupping his fists with a big smile on his face, “Young Master Yang, so this is where you were.”

Luckily, Yang Kai had killed some enemies along the way here, so many Ice Heart Valley female disciples had spotted him, otherwise, Nanmen Da Jun might not have been able to find him so quickly. Nanmen Da Jun had asked many people along the way and followed a distinct trail of bodies to quickly arrive at where Yang Kai was.

This Ice Lake was originally a Restricted Area, a hidden place where even disciples of the Sect would not easily be able to enter.

Nanmen Da Jun put his angry attitude away and replaced it with a respectful and flattering attitude. The aloofness of a Grandmaster was shattered by his behaviour. For people who did not know the whole story, they would be made to believe that this Grandmaster was nothing but a bootlicker. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Young Master Yang, why do you harm me so by concealing the truth? If I knew that the Formation was Young Master Yang’s property, I wouldn’t have bothered Senior Bing Yun.” Nanmen Da Jun put a smile on his face, but he actually felt bitter in his heart, a complicated feeling.

After separating from Yang Kai, he went to find Bing Yun to ask about the Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation; however, Bing Yun was in charge of cleaning up the remaining enemies, so he did not feel right to disturb her and had to wait until everything was settled before asking.

When he finally got the chance to ask her though, Nanmen Da Jun was dumbfounded.

It turned out that the Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation was given to Ice Heart Valley by Yang Kai a month ago and did not belong to them at all. Bing Yun also clearly told Nanmen Da Jun that it was inappropriate for Ice Heart Valley to discuss anything about this Formation with him, and if he wanted to know about its details, he should ask Yang Kai himself.

Nanmen Da Jun was dumbstruck.

Realization dawned on him as he finally understood the meaning of Yang Kai’s last words to him during their previous meeting.

At that time, Nanmen Da Jun thought this boy was being arrogant and ignorant, but it turned out that Yang Kai had actually dug a big hole for him and was just waiting for him to voluntarily jump down into it.

Nanmen Da Jun was regretful and mad all at once. He was a famous Array Grandmaster, and even though he did not have any strong background or force behind him, he was respected by all people. Even Third-Order Emperor Realm Sect Masters showed him courtesy; after all, who did not have a Sect Defending Array or need help arranging Spirit Arrays now and again?

Now, it was embarrassing that he had to go back to plead with Yang Kai for a Spirit Array. He was already embarrassed once in asking about the matter regarding the Ancient Wild Lands, so he could not believe that now he had to turn the other cheek after being slapped on one side of his face.

[Why am I so cheap!?] Nanmen Da Jun despised himself in his heart.

After agonizing over it though, he still had no choice. Even if he had to humiliate himself, he could not resist the temptation of such a rare treasure. He secretly pledged that no matter how hard Yang Kai made things for him, he would still swallow all his pride as long as Yang Kai would show him the array charts of the Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation.

“Do I know you?” Yang Kai looked disdainfully at him with a lukewarm expression.

Nanmen Da Jun grinned, “Once strange, twice familiar, and thrice friends.”

“No need,” Yang Kai faked a smile, “Grandmaster Nanmen is famous in the Star Boundary, a leading Array Grandmaster of this generation. This Young Master is just a small character, unworthy to be friends with you.”

Nanmen Da Jun pulled a long face, “Young Master Yang is too serious. This Nanmen is just a little knowledgeable in the Dao of Spirit Arrays and wouldn’t dare to call himself a Grandmaster. Young Master Yang, please don’t flatter me.”

He would have accepted the praise without hesitation if it was from others, but in front of Yang Kai, he dared not to admit it.

Treasures blind the eyes. Before he got his hands on the charts from Yang Kai, Nanmen Da Jun still had to act humble in front of him, even if he felt extremely aggrieved.

Yang Kai ignored him and continued to chat with Old Ban.

Although Old Ban had no idea what was going on, he could see that this man named Grandmaster Nanmen was asking Yang Kai for a favour. Since he did not have the right to intervene in this kind of matter, Old Ban simply pretended that he knew nothing and continued chatting with Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s haughtiness infuriated Nanmen Da Jun; however, he could only choke down his anger and wait for the other side with a forced smile, hoping that his sincerity would change Yang Kai’s mind later.

After listening to their conversation for a while, Nanmen Da Jun gradually realized a few things and turned to look at Xiao Ling’er, “Little girl, what’s your name?” He asked kindly.

Xiao Ling’er took a look at him and gave a crisp reply.

Nanmen Da Jun smiled lightly, “Ling’er is smart and lovely, and has honest eyes. It seems that it is fate for us to meet each other. Come, come, come, this old man will give you a little gift to commemorate our first meeting.”

Saying so, an object abruptly appeared in the hand of Nanmen Da Jun. It looked like a jade pendant; however, this pendant did not really have the colour of jade, but was in an unsophisticated yellow material.

After taking this pendant out, he hung it on Xiao Ling’er’s neck without hesitation.

Yang Kai casually swept his eyes across this pendant and immediately raised his brow.

Old Ban, who was talking to Yang Kai, was also greatly shocked, “Grandmaster, we cannot accept this, it is far too precious! Ling’er cannot receive such a valuable gift!”

Although he did not recognize what the jade pendant-like object was, he knew that Nanmen Da Jun would not give out something cheap.

Nanmen Da Jun chuckled, “You’re too serious. Since you know Young Master Yang Kai, you are also this Nanmen’s friend. This is our first meeting, but I’m sorry that I didn’t prepare anything for you, so I hope you don’t mind this small gift for your descendant!”

Old Ban opened his mouth, but he did not know how to reject it. He could only turn to Yang Kai helplessly.

They did not know each other at all, so it was unreasonable for Nanmen Da Jun to suddenly give a precious gift to Xiao Ling’er. It was obvious that he wanted to curry favour with Yang Kai through them, so only Yang Kai could deal with this matter.

“Grandmaster Nanmen is quite generous to just casually give out an Array Plate,” Yang Kai responded lightly.

Nanmen Da Jun’s eyes lit up, “Young Master Yang recognizes this?”

He was actually afraid that Yang Kai did not know the value of this thing, and wanted to give a few hints about it, but it seemed like he had underestimated Yang Kai’s vision.

“What? An Array Plate!?” Old Ban was taken aback as his face filled with terror.

An Array Plate was far too much for a first meeting gift.

Array Plates were self-contained Spirit Arrays. When facing an enemy, one could summon an Array Plate to instantly activate the Spirit Array inscribed inside of it. Old Ban had lived on the edge of the Ancient Wild Lands for a long time and had a lot of contact with many people, so he was knowledgeable enough to know what an Array Plate was.

“It’s just a small thing, a small thing. This Nanmen only refined it during his spare time and it is now useless for him to keep it. Please don’t reject this small gift,” Nanmen Da Jun laughed.

Yang Kai did not speak a word, simply reaching out to touch the Array Plate for a while before nodding, “Not bad. This could confine a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master for at least an incense stick worth of time, while anyone below the Third-Order Dao Source Realm would die instantly inside!”

It was Nanmen Da Jun’s turn to be surprised as he genuinely complimented, “Young Master Yang really has sharp eyesight.”

Old Ban, who was listening on the side, gasped, his voice cracking, “Anyone below the Third-Order Dao Source Realm would die instantly inside this array?”
