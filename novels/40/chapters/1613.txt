Chapter 1613, Poaching

Ba He and the others stood in place and looked at each other.

Shan Qing Luo seemed to be in a daze as she held the Space Ring in her small hands, feeling Yang Kai’s lingering warmth on it.

Sinking her Divine Sense into it, and after seeing what was in the Space Ring, Shan Qing Luo immediately flashed a shocked expression.

Inside this Space Ring were at least two hundred Domain Stones!

She almost thought that she was seeing things, but after carefully examining these things, Shan Qing Luo confirmed they were really Domain Stones, each one emitting a gentle Domain aura.

[So many!] Shan Qing Luo was astonished, and her tender body couldn’t help shivering slightly.

One had to know that, over the entire time she spent in the Blood Prison, she had only managed to acquire three Domain Stones. She obtained these three after much painstaking effort and thought she had reaped a great harvest.

Yu Xiong only got a single piece while Ba He managed to acquire two.

But Yang Kai had unexpectedly given her two hundred pieces all at once! This number was enough to drive anyone crazy.

But where had he obtained so many Domain Stones?

After recovering from her initial shock, Shan Qing Luo laughed sweetly as she gripped the Space Ring a little tighter.

With so many Domain Stones, she was confident that she could reach the Origin King Realm in a very short time, and that she would not become a burden to Yang Kai in the future.

“Don’t wait for Xue Lian and the others? What does that mean?” Yu Xiong looked confused.

Ba He’s face dimmed as his eyes flashed, clearly understanding what Yang Kai’s last words implied, and simply waved, “Let’s go, there’s no need to wait.”

Xue Sun also flew over and landed beside the still smiling Shan Qing Luo and pulled her towards a well-concealed Void Corridor nearby.

This Void Corridor had existed in this valley since ancient times and led to a place a million kilometres outside Green Mountains Star. The Monster Race cultivator from Monster Emperor Star always left through this Void Corridor after the Blood Prison closed.

With Ba He, Yu Xiong, and the other’s cultivations, after leaving the Void Corridor, they would need to fly through the Starry Sky for three or four months before returning to Monster Emperor Star.

Fortunately, there wasn’t much danger along this road, so they didn’t have anything to worry about on the way.

Two days later, Yang Kai left the Blood Prison and arrived at a vast wilderness.

Sporadic cultivators appeared one after another from inside the Blood Prison, either alone or in groups, but without exception looking both excited and sad.

Excited because they survived the Blood Prison Trial, an achievement that proved they had the qualifications to condense their Shi to the grand accomplishment stage and possibly break through to the Origin King Realm.

Even if they could not break through in the end, they could still become top-level Origin Realm masters after this experience.

They were also sad because many of their companions had died!

Some great forces even had all the cultivators they sent to participate in the Blood Prison Trial annihilated inside, such as Scarlet Wave Star’s Brilliant Flame Sect.

Above the wilderness, countless cultivators were waiting for their fellow Sect companions to emerge, and once they found them, they would smile and greet them enthusiastically with a look of expectation and hope in their eyes.

Naturally, no one came to welcome Yang Kai. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Shan Qing Luo and the others who came with him from Monster Emperor Star had headed back there.

Yang Kai did not care about these people’s excitement and instead released his Divine Sense to start looking for Qian Tong and the others.

He came out late so Qian Tong and the others should have come out long ago!

Soon, he noticed a familiar aura and turned to fly off in a certain direction.

Not far from there, a group of people who seemed to have a strong background were surrounding a beautiful young woman, trying their best to win her over. All of their expressions were extremely sincere, and they were constantly sending out attractive offers.

“Madam, if you don’t have a particular destination in mind, why not come to my Blue Radish Sect? With your cultivation and strength, as long as you join, you can immediately become an Outer Sect Elder, have your own Spirit Peak, and be provided with a generous amount of Saint Crystals and pills every month. My Blue Radish Sect has seventy-two main peaks, one of which is empty as we have not found a suitable owner until today.”

“What does the Blue Radish Sect count for? Madam, come to our Heavenly Dream Palace, we have an Origin King Realm Master who commands Heavenly Dream Palace so you will have an opportunity to receive guidance in the mysteries of Domain every three years if you join us. Madam cannot miss this opportunity.”

“If Madam is willing to join my Imperial Spirit Pavilion, this old master can guarantee that you will become an Inner Sect Elder right away. My Imperial Spirit Pavilion will also do its best to help you cultivate so you can make a breakthrough to the Origin King Realm as soon as possible!”

The beautiful young woman turned a deaf ear to the noise around her and simply stood in place with a frown on her brow, seemingly waiting for someone as she would look around from time to time.

After becoming somewhat annoyed with all the noise around her though, she finally shook her head and said, “I apologize to everyone here, but this Mistress already has a Sect and does not plan to leave it, so please don’t waste your time with me.”

“It doesn’t matter if you already have a Sect,” The old man from Imperial Spirit Pavilion who had previously invited her to join laughed, “This old master won’t insist you leave your current Sect. Madam can simply join my Imperial Spirit Pavilion as you are now without any trouble.”

In order to win over this beautiful young woman, he didn’t mind offering extremely generous conditions, not even minding her already having a Sect she belonged to.

“I’m sorry, but I have no such intentions,” The young woman still shook her head.

“Elder Lin,” Yang Kai walked over suddenly and called out.

Hearing this call, Lin Yu Rao’s beautiful eyes lit up and she quickly turned her gaze towards him and called out cheerfully, “Sect Master, you finally came out.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly and looked around, “Why are you alone, where are Qian Tong and the others?”

Lin Yu Rao’s expression turned complicated as she whispered, “It’s not convenient to talk here, let’s talk while walking.”

Seeing this kind of look on her face, Yang Kai did not ask any questions and simply nodded, “Alright.”

“Friend, please wait!” Seeing that Yang Kai was about to take Lin Yu Rao away, the people who had been surrounding her suddenly became anxious and hurriedly stood in front of Yang Kai.

“Do you have something you need to say?” Yang Kai frowned.

The old man who had been speaking happily just now cupped his fists and asked politely, “Friend, are you the Sect Master of this lady here?”

“Yes, what of it?”

“Nothing much, this old master is Imperial Spirit Pavilion’s Great Elder, and would like to invite this lady on behalf of my Sect to join our pavilion as an Inner Sect Elder!” The old man saw that Yang Kai was just a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator and could not help feeling somewhat contemptuous, otherwise, how could he continue trying to poach Lin Yu Rao right before Yang Kai’s eyes?

After all, this kind of thing was a bit improper...

“Do all of you have such intentions?” Yang Kai looked around at the rest of the crowd.

“Indeed,” Those people nodded, their expressions calm.

“And your opinion?” Yang Kai turned to look at Lin Yu Rao.

“Why would Sect Master ask such a question? This Mistress won’t leave High Heaven Sect,” Lin Yu Rao brushed her hair behind her ear and responded lightly.

Yang Kai nodded, “All of you heard her, yes? Since that is settled, let’s leave.”

Saying so, Yang Kai tried to lead Lin Yu Rao off.

“Madam, are you certain you don’t want to think about this matter more carefully? If you feel that this old master’s offer is not sincere enough, we can still discuss it, everything is open to negotiation,” The old man still chattered and followed Lin Yu Rao.

“Scram!” Yang Kai shouted coldly as he glared at the old man.

These people had greeted him with smiles, so Yang Kai did not want to embarrass them directly and instead asked Lin Yu Rao for her opinion. But after the other party got Lin Yu Rao’s answer, he was still reluctant to give up, which was nothing less than a slap in the face.

Facing such naked contempt, Yang Kai was not about to just sit back in silence.

The old man was stunned for a moment before his face immediately turned gloomy and he snickered, “Brat, this is none of your concern, you’d better close your mouth obediently otherwise...”

“Otherwise what?” Yang Kai looked back at him coldly.

“Otherwise, you’ll regret it. Do not think that because you are a so-called ‘Sect Master’ you can act rampantly. What thing are you? As a Sect Master, how can you have a cultivation level inferior to one of your Elders? What kind of Sect Master are you? In my opinion, this madam serving you is a waste of her talents, talents that would be better put to use in my Imperial Spirit Pavilion where she will certainly have a brighter future.”

As the old man spoke, the other cultivators who wanted to invite Lin Yu Rao began calling out as well, belittling Yang Kai’s cultivation and trying to force him to back down and not ruin Lin Yu Rao’s future.

“What are you quarrelling about?” Yang Kai was annoyed and said coldly, “Elder Lin has already rejected you, yet you are still trying to bother her, are you not putting me in your eyes at all?”

“Does this old master need to put you in his eyes? Nonsense!” The old man said coldly snorted.

Everyone else looked at Yang Kai disdainfully, obviously not paying attention to him.

The conflict here had attracted a lot of attention, but seeing how Yang Kai was just a trivial Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator and that he had provoked so many enemies all at once, many began wearing sympathetic looks, feeling that Yang Kai had eyes but failed to see and would certainly suffer a big loss.

“Old man, if you don’t want to die, I would stop provoking him. Don’t just look at his cultivation, he’s not someone you can handle,” An abrupt voice interrupted, causing the old man and the others around him to frown. Turning around, they saw that the source of this sound was an ordinary-looking young man standing nearby with his arms folded across his chest and a mocking grin on his face.

Being so disdained, the old man was naturally angry and his face sank, but just as he was about to retort, he caught sight of a three-petal flower pattern embroidered on the chest of the young man’s clothes. As if thinking of something, his expression changed slightly and he cupped his fists politely and asked, “May I ask this friend, who is Senior Wu Dao to you?”

The young man said lightly, “My Master!”

Gasps resounded all around as everyone present stared at this young man in shock, disbelief, and deep envy.

“Heavens, this person is actually a disciple of Senior Wu Dao.”

“It was rumoured that Senior Wu Dao accepted a disciple fifty years ago but unfortunately no one knows who it was. It turns out to be him.”

“He actually came to participate in the Blood Prison Trial.”

“What did he mean just now then? Does that Second-Order Origin Returning Realm boy have some kind of incredible background like him?”

After learning that this young man turned out to be Senior Wu Dao’s disciple, everyone looked at him with awe and envy.

The old man of the Imperial Spirit Pavilion did not dare ignore this young man’s warning just now anymore, frowned, and asked, “This friend, a moment ago, what did you...”

The young man still maintained a relaxed look and just shook his head faintly, “You all heard what I said just now, what more do you want to ask? If you want to die, keep trying to provoke him.”

The old man’s face turned pale as he shot a fear-filled glance towards Yang Kai. Now, it was as if he could see some kind of massive shadow behind Yang Kai, one he didn’t dare act presumptuously before anymore.
