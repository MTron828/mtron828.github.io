It was all over; Zi Long knew he could no longer escape.

A look of unwillingness flashed across his eyes as he stared at Yang Kai with unadulterated hatred. Clenching his fists, Zi Long’s face flushed, and his body began to rapidly inflate, the blue veins on his distorted face throbbing in a terrifying manner as extremely violent energy fluctuations spread from his figure.

“Not good! He wants to self-destruct!” Gui Zu’s complexion changed drastically as he felt a chill shoot up his back.

Although they were ten kilometres away from Zi Long at the moment, the force of a Second-Order Origin King self-destructing wouldn’t be diminished with such little distance. Once Zi Long truly detonated his cultivation, everything within at least a hundred kilometres would be vaporized.

Even Gui Zu could not guarantee he would survive such an explosion.

He immediately understood that Zi Long had been driven into a dead-end, otherwise, how could a Second-Order Origin King make such a decisive decision?

“In your dreams!” Yang Kai’s expression was also very solemn as he stretched out his hand and summoned a small blue bead into it before immediately pouring his Saint Qi and Spiritual Energy into it madly.

After just one breath, Yang Kai’s aura became languid while the pale blue bead only shone faintly.

“Go!” Yang Kai pushed the bead forward and sent out a tiny lightning bolt, only about as big as an ox’s hair, towards Zi Long.

Gui Zu’s forehead leaked even more cold sweat as his eyes nearly popped staring at the seemingly inconspicuous lightning arc.

He could feel a ruinous aura coming from this bolt, along with a power he could not even muster the will to resist.

This kind of power seemed to surpass the Origin King Realm and was able to dominate over this world!

“Haha, have you finally run out of tricks? Even if this King must die here today, don’t think you’ll feel any better!” Zi Long smiled madly and taunted as he stared at the weak-looking lightning bolt Yang Kai had just sent out, thinking he was making a futile last effort.

But all he could see was Yang Kai staring at him with disdain.

Zi Long frowned slightly but before he could respond, the faint bolt of lightning flashed before his eyes.

In the next moment, Zi Long felt his whole body go numb, as if he had been struck by Heaven’s might, even his thoughts seemingly freezing up.

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw numerous lightning arcs floating around his body, like tiny snakes, and under the destructive power of these lightning arcs, the Second-Order Origin King physique he was so proud of began to collapse and disintegrate, his strength melting like snowflakes under the scorching sun.

His bulging body also shrivelled up at an extremely rapid pace.

“This... is impossible!” Zi Long roared unwillingly.

Xiao Xiao’s Heaven Shaking Pillar smashed down on him at that moment, along with a ball of thunder-flame from Liu Yan.

After three breaths, the dust settled, and the place where Zi Long once stood was now empty. The Sect Master of Purple Star did not even leave behind any bones. Only his Space Ring remained as it shot into the distance under the strong force.

Liu Yan turned around, transformed into her human form, and chased after the Space Ring.

*Pu...*

Yang Kai coughed up blood as his complexion went extremely pale. Quickly sitting down cross-legged in the void, Yang Kai took out a Spirit Pill, stuffed it into his mouth, and began circulating his Secret Art to heal his injuries.

Gui Zu stood to the side, utterly stunned.

He had witnessed the entire battle just now from beginning to end, and although he and Yang Kai had teamed up to wound Zi Long at the beginning, the finishing blow essentially had nothing to do with him. In other words, at least eighty percent of the credit for killing Zi Long belonged to Yang Kai alone.

Perhaps... Yang Kai could have even accomplished this without his help.

When this thought emerged, Gui Zu was shocked.

[An Origin King that just broke through was able to kill a character like Zi Long? Is this boy... really human?]

Gui Zu looked at Yang Kai like he was some kind of monster.

What astounded Gui Zu further was the light-blue bead that Yang Kai had summoned at the last moment. It was definitely an amazing artifact, but Gui Zu was unable to tell what grade it was.

As he stood there stunned, Xiao Xiao and Liu Yan returned together and flanked Gui Zu from both left and right, staring at him with unkind eyes.

“What?” Gui Zu’s mouth twitched, “This old master is High Heaven Sect’s Supreme Elder and is your master’s ally. Don’t look at this old master with such suspicion, this old master won’t treat him unfavourably.”

Gui Zu knew that Xiao Xiao and Liu Yan were wary of him because Yang Kai was healing here, so he did not take their offensive behaviour to heart.

However, Xiao Xiao and Liu Yan remained unmoved, still standing in place, clearly threatening to attack Gui Zu if he made any suspicious moves.

“Don’t be rude!” A booming, almost deafening voice suddenly called out, “You two can retreat for now.”

Hearing this voice sound, Liu Yan stepped aside without hesitation while Xiao Xiao scratched his head, seeming to be a little dazed. Liu Yan saw him acting like this and quickly arrived at his side and used her fist to knock his head lightly.

Xiao Xiao bowed his head aggrievedly.

Gui Zu opened his mouth wide and looked up as he watched the stone giant walk towards him from the distance. Each step Yang Kai’s Embodiment took caused the surrounding space to tremble. Slightly hesitant, Gui Zu asked, “Just now... did you speak?”

After asking, like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, he shivered and asked again, “Can you talk?”

“Why wouldn’t I be able to talk?” The Embodiment grinned in a manner extremely similar to Yang Kai and said in a booming tone, “Did Supreme Elder think this body was just a dead puppet?”

“You call me Supreme Elder?” Gui Zu frowned, “So you really are Yang Kai.”

“I am, in a sense. I can at least represent my true body,” The Embodiment gently nodded before frowning slightly. “This body is too big, it’s so inconvenient to move.”

“It is quite big...” Gui Zu wiped the cold sweat from his forehead. Although he understood that this Embodiment was Yang Kai, seeing such a massive fellow walking towards him with a sly grin on its face still caused him quite a bit of stress.

“My main body just consumed too much strength and should be able to wake up in a while. Supreme Elder doesn’t need to worry,” The Embodiment also seemed to realize that his voice was a bit too loud and deliberately lowered it.

[Why should I be worried?!] Gui Zu yelled in his heart, he could naturally see what happened to Yang Kai, but everything that happened in the recent battle had been too frightful, so it had taken him some time to digest reality and compose himself.

“Kid, didn’t your true body only just break through to the Origin King Realm? How did you suddenly reach the peak of the First-Order? It even looks like your main body could break through to the Second-Order right away, if he had the opportunity,” Gui Zu asked indignantly. He had spent two thousand years on the floating continent and only broke through to the Origin King by coincidence before spending the next five hundred years in stagnation. Only after escaping from the floating continent and feeling both his mind and body break free, did Gui Zu experience another breakthrough.

Yang Kai, on the other hand, had only disappeared for a few months but had already reached the peak of First-Order. Gui Zu wanted to scream out about how the Heavens were unfair.

“My main body’s situation is somewhat related to me,” The Embodiment finally arrived beside Gui Zu and sat down cross-legged. Looking down, the Embodiment pointed at himself and said, “Because of my birth, my main body experienced massive growth after his breakthrough.”

Gui Zu’s brow furrowed in confusion, “That makes even less sense...”

“Hehe, let’s put it this way: If one of us prospers, both of us prosper. Once my strength grows, it has a positive effect on my main body.”

“En, this old master understands,” Gui Zu rubbed his sore neck. “But your Embodiment is a bit peculiar. How did you cultivate it?”

This was what Gui Zu was really interested in. External incarnations only existed in legend and it was certainly a Secret Technique he wanted to cultivate. If he could create an embodiment of his own in the future, his strength would definitely soar.

“If Supreme Elder wants to cultivate it, I can teach you.”

“How could I possibly accept something like that?” Gui Zu was overjoyed as he rubbed his hands, saying no but his expression clearly saying yes.

The Embodiment chuckled seeing this and said, “Do you still remember that, on the floating continent, you sent my Soul Clone into that Space Array to test it?”

Gui Zu’s face suddenly turned awkward, “That was all in the past, why bring it up now?”

His attitude towards Yang Kai at the time could not be described as friendly.

“At that time, instead of my true body, it was my Soul Clone that entered the Space Array...” The Embodiment looked at Gui Zu with a smile.

Gui Zu thoughtfully said, “You mean...”

“Yes, I am that Soul Clone!” The Embodiment nodded slightly, “If you want to cultivate an Embodiment, you must first cultivate a Soul Clone, then wait for it to become strong enough before implanting it into a suitable body.”

“That’s it?” Gui Zu was surprised.

“En, it’s that simple,” the Embodiment smiled slightly. “But... although the process is simple, it may not necessarily be effective.”

“Why do you say that?” Gui Zu asked curiously.

“First, finding a suitable body is extremely difficult, and even if you do find one, ensuring that your Soul Clone can merge with it successfully is another issue; after all, putting a foreign Soul into a vessel not designed for it is never simple. Even if you can succeed in both of these aspects, the Embodiment you create may not be too powerful. For a master like Supreme Elder, an Embodiment probably won’t be able to add anything to your strength.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“But you...” Gui Zu was not completely convinced yet. Although he could not understand all the details of Yang Kai’s Embodiment, judging from the slap it used on Zi Long before, its combat effectiveness was definitely no weaker than a Second-Order Origin King, probably even higher.

“I am an exception. There were too many opportunities and coincidences involved in my birth,” The Embodiment did not bother explaining much.

Yang Kai’s Embodiment was originally just the second Golden Stone Puppet, and because it had not swallowed many ores, its combat power was actually quite low. Yang Kai had kept it on hand but never used it for much until this recent opportunity to swallow and refine the floating continent. After accomplishing this, its strength had taken a massive leap.

Such development was simply impossible to replicate.

“So, does Supreme Elder still wish to learn?” The Embodiment asked.

Gui Zu pondered over the issue for a moment. Cultivating an Embodiment would surely be a very time-consuming and resource-intensive process; after all, this Secret Technique was clearly incredibly powerful, and the more powerful a Secret Technique was, the more difficult it would be to cultivate.

Was it really worth delaying his own pursuit of the Martial Dao?

“Forget it, I won’t bother learning it for now. If this old master wants to learn it in the future, I’ll come to you again,” Gui Zu thought for a long time before he decided to first reach the Third-Order Origin King Realm to study this Embodiment technique.

“Alright,” The Embodiment nodded, “En, my main body should wake up soon, you guys can talk.”
