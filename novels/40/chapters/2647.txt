Yang Kai turned around again to look at Luan Feng with a grin and asked, “Lady Feng, did you have something else you wanted to say?”

Luan Feng gritted her pristine teeth hard and spat angrily, “This Queen really doesn’t know what she owed you in her past life!”

Yang Kai shook his head, “Lady Feng should not say that. Helping others is the route to happiness. But does this mean Lady Feng is willing to provide her assistance?”

Since she had stopped him, she naturally would not refuse the request. After all, she was still unsure whether Zhang Ruo Xi was really from Ice Heart Valley or not, but it was better to believe it than to not. Since Yang Kai had involved Zhang Ruo Xi, Luan Feng had to help no matter what.

She was not helping Yang Kai, but the descendant of Heaven’s Order whom she was extremely frightened of.

“Just two trivial Third-Order Emperor Realms Masters are not enough for this Queen to move personally, a few Monster Kings will be more than sufficient,” Luan Feng grumbled unhappily.

Yang Kai raised his brow and stated, “Lady Feng is wise. Then please send about seven or eight Monster Kings to the Northern Territory with me to eradicate the enemy!”

He never expected Luan Feng to take part in the fight from the beginning. His initial plan was to ask Luan Feng to send a few Monster Kings to boost their forces, and now Luan Feng had offered him exactly what he wanted.

“Seven or eight…” Luan Feng rolled her eyes, “Not even in your dreams!”

She did not possess that many Monster Kings. Hearing Yang Kai request for seven or eight Monster Kings made it seem less like he wanted to help Ice Heart Valley and more like he wanted to wage war against the world.

“Four or five then…” Yang Kai grinned.

Luan Feng did not answer, instead wearing a pensive look for a moment before she spoke, “Since this matter involves ‘her’, it is also a matter for the entire Ancient Lands. This Queen can’t bear the responsibility for this alone. How about this, stay here in the Phoenix Nest Palace for a few days. This Queen will give you a satisfactory answer within three days.”

Yang Kai thought for a while after hearing this, soon realizing something and smiling as he nodded, “Many thanks, Lady Feng!”

There was a pause before Yang Kai continued, “There is one more thing I need to ask of Lady Feng!”

“What?” Luan Feng suddenly became vigilant. The more she interacted with Yang Kai, the more offput she became. Nothing good would come out of this little brat’s mouth.

Yang Kai requested, “I want to build a Space Array in Phoenix Nest Palace, may I know of a suitable location?”

“A Space Array?” Luan Feng frowned, “Do you actually know how to arrange such an array?”

“Somewhat.”

“Where would this Space Array lead to?” Luan Feng asked uneasily.

“To Ice Heart Valley,” Yang Kai replied naturally, “I spent one month to get here, so I can’t return the same way as that would take too much time. That’s why I want to arrange a Space Array here that directly connects to Ice Heart Valley.”

“A Cross-Territory Space Array!” Luan Feng could not help being shocked as she asked incredulously, “Can you really arrange such a thing?”

This was the Eastern Territory, and Ice Heart Valley was in the Northern Territory. If Yang Kai was really not speaking carelessly, he possessed the incredible ability to arrange Cross-Territory Space Arrays. The only Cross-Territory Space Arrays in the entire Star Boundary were ancient relics that had been passed down over tens of thousands of years. Currently, there was no one capable of building new ones.

“Lady Feng can just wait and see,” Yang Kai laughed lightly. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Luan Feng nodded lightly, “This Queen will allow it. Just look for Tian Long, she will arrange everything.”

“Many thanks!”

As soon as they finished their negotiations, Luan Feng summoned Tian Long again and gave her instructions to take Yang Kai to the same small building where he stayed last time.

Back in the same small courtyard, Yang Kai sent Old Ban and Xiao Ling’er to rest before reiterating his request to Tian Long. Tian Long did not object to his request when she heard that it was approved by Luan Feng and personally brought Yang Kai to a concealed and spacious place.

Yang Kai immediately began to build the Space Array in that hidden place.

In less than a day, a brand new Space Array had taken shape.

After confirming the Space Array was not faulty, Yang Kai went back to the building to rest.

Just as he left, a graceful figure suddenly appeared, gaping at the Space Array in amazement.

“Tian Long, did he really only spend a day arranging this?” Luan Feng asked preposterously.

Standing to the side, Tian Long nodded in awe, “This servant saw it with her own eyes. Although this servant stood far away when Young Master Yang was working, she observed everything carefully from beginning to end.”

“Is he really that capable?” Luan Feng asked in disbelief.

Space Arrays were not easy to arrange, not to mention Cross-Territory Space Arrays. Luan Feng originally thought that Yang Kai would need at least ten days to half a month to arrange such an array, possibly even longer, but she had never expected him to complete it in a day.

This was simply amazing.

“Ice Heart Valley…” Luan Feng muttered, “Tian Long, I’ll pay a visit to Ice Heart Valley, you stay here.”

The reason that she decided to go to Ice Heart Valley was to first test the credibility of this Space Array, and second to investigate Zhang Ruo Xi’s relation with Ice Heart Valley.

She could not shake off the feeling that Yang Kai was conning her; after all, that little brat was too untrustworthy and was always up to no good.

Tian Long was flabbergasted, “Mistress must not! It’s not a question of whether this Space Array can be used, but just in case something unexpected happens…”

It was not a joke if an accident occurred during long-distance teleportation. At worst, Luan Feng could be exiled forever to The Void without a way out. Regardless of how strong Luan Feng was, she would be bound to suffer being exiled to the endless chaos.

Luan Feng waved her hand and insisted, “This Queen has her own plans.”

With another wave of her hand, many High-Rank Source Crystals appeared and slid into the grooves of the Space Array before she stepped up onto the platform with a flash.

Tian Long waited at the side nervously.

Luan Feng was also a little nervous. After all, this was something Yang Kai built in less than a day, so it could be faulty.

Surprisingly though, after Luan Feng waited on the formation for a long time, there was still no reaction from the Space Array.

“What? So, he was just running his mouth!” Luan Feng sneered, confirming that the Space Array was completely useless. She got down from the Space Array smugly and went back to her palace in a gleeful mood.

She was now anticipating seeing Yang Kai’s expression when he realized that his precious Space Array was defective.

During the few days of their stay, Old Ban felt like he was always walking on thin ice, constantly trembling in fear.

This was the palace of a Divine Spirit. He was extremely fortunate to even stay here, thanks to the blessing of Yang Kai, so how could he dare expect anything more? On the contrary, Xiao Ling’er was ignorant due to her age and lively by nature, so it was inevitable for her to feel curious when one suddenly moved to such a luxurious place.

The spirit fruits placed on the table were almost completely eaten by her. These spirit fruits were the local harvests of the Ancient Lands, all of which were rich in World Energy and naturally rare items to the outside world. Anyone who ate them would gain great benefits to his or her cultivation.

Xiao Ling’er lived here for only three days, but had eaten several dozen of these precious spirit fruits. Her originally sallow skin and thin figure had become supple and tender while even her dull hair had turned black and shiny while an abundance of energy seemed to pulse through her body.

The morning after the third day, the screech of an eagle was heard outside the Phoenix Nest Palace. A navy blue light fell from the sky and a figure appeared outside the palace. Before he could kowtow at the palace gate, another figure flew over from a different direction, appearing near him.

The two exchanged eye contact and the former smiled slightly as he raised his brow, “Xie Wu Wei!”

The latter greeted softly, “Ying Fei?”

Ying Fei peeked at Xie Wu Wei curiously, “Why did Brother Xie come to Phoenix Nest Palace? This is not Sir Fan Wu’s territory.”

Xie Wu Wei grimaced in reply, “You are here too, and this is not Sir Cang Gou’s territory.”

After speaking, the two seemed to realize something, and they both asked in unison, “Are you here for that?”

There was no answer, but the answer was apparent.

Xie Wu Wei crooned in amazement, “You are so lucky that you were assigned this job. I’m sure the others are all quite jealous!”

Ying Fei laughed heartily, “A few days ago, Young Master Yang travelled through this King’s territory. This King escorted him along the way, so after Sir Cang Gou learned of this, he assigned this King to assist Young Master Yang. But Brother Xie, how about you? How did you land this cushy job?”

He knew that among the Monster Kings under Fan Wu, Xie Wu Wei was definitely not the strongest one, nor the one that Fan Wu valued the most, because he had a short and bad temper, and he was unlikable; it was amazing that Xie Wu Wei actually stood out and grabbed this job.

He could obtain this job without shedding any blood, mainly because of a fortunate encounter with Yang Kai a few days ago, but how did Xie Wu Wei win over this opportunity?

Xie Wu Wei replied grumpily, “None of your damn business.”

Choked by his words, Ying Fei could not help rolling his eyes.

During their conversation, thunder rolled and a lightning-like light shot over from the distance. The light rushed towards Xie Wu Wei and Ying Fei and dispersed in front of them, revealing a burly figure.

“Xi Lei!” Xie Wu Wei frowned.

Ying Fei could not help cackling, “Brother Xi Lei, what happened to you?”

The burly figure before them was Monster King Xi Lei, a Monster King subordinate of Shi Huo. However, after Shi Huo was killed, he took shelter under Luan Feng and was now regarded as one of Luan Feng’s subordinates.

Despite Xi Lei’s rowdy, barbarian appearance, his strength was ranked top three among the thirty-two Monster Kings.

But the powerful Monster King, at this moment, looked quite dishevelled. He had a bruised nose and a swollen face, seemingly having just come from an extremely ferocious battle.

The Monster Race all had strong physiques and would recover rapidly from ordinary injuries, but Xi Lei’s wounds were still shockingly obvious and he had yet to fully heal, so his original injuries were no doubt quite severe.

Xi Lei scoffed at the question, “I just had a fight with those bastards! This Old Rhino suffered, but those bastards are not much better off than me.”

Although Xi Lei’s name did not consist of the word ‘rhino’, he had the body of a rhinoceros originating from an ancient bloodline, so he had always addressed himself as Old Rhino.

Xie Wu Wei and Ying Fei exchanged looks, and could not help feeling sombre. From the looks of Xi Lei’s condition, the two of them immediately understood that if they had not been so fortunate to have some previous connections with Yang Kai, they would have had to fight it out to obtain this position.
