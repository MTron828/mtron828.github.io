“Jiang, Jiang Chu He?” Qin Yu’s beautiful eyes suddenly snapped wide open, a look of inconceivable shock appearing on her face as she stared at the struggling demon being suppressed on the ground.

She realised that this demon was, in fact, the Jiang Family’s new generational talent, Jiang Chu He!

As one of the descendants hailing from the various aristocratic families in Maplewood City, Qin Yu had had a number of interactions with Jiang Chu He, and thus was naturally able to recognise him. However, never in her wildest thoughts did she imagine that one of the demons who had taken over the outside of Maplewood City would actually be a person she knew.

The Jiang Family’s wanton mining had caused the seal in the mine to break, causing the pure Demon Qi from the Ancient Great Demon to seep out. Only a handful of Dao Source Realm Masters within Maplewood City knew about this, leaving it as a mystery for all the other cultivators.

It wasn’t because Duan Yuan Shan was worried about creating chaos that he had not disseminated this information, but that he hadn’t had the time and opportunity to do so.

“How could it be him?” Qin Yu was completely incapable of wrapping her head around what she was seeing.

“Oh my god! Isn’t that Young Master Jiang?”

“Is that really Young Master Jiang? I had a drink of flower wine with him at the Drunken Moon Winehouse just half a month ago! How could he...”

After recognizing Jiang Chu He from his appearance, expressions of shock appeared on the faces of the surrounding cultivators.

One of the cultivators even revealed a pained look on his face, as he had indeed had a drink with Jiang Chu He at the greatest winehouse in Maplewood City, beautiful women in their arms as they drank delicious flower wine and had a great and happy chat.

Within half a month, the majestic and graceful Jiang Young Master had unexpectedly turned into such a monster! He couldn’t help but sigh sorrowfully in regret.

“Hold him down properly! What are you all scared of? Little Brother Yang has already suppressed his cultivation, he’s just a useless person!” Qin Zhao Yang shouted out from the side, his voice brimming with a stern and oppressive pressure.

Hearing this, the surrounding cultivators unconsciously twitched their mouths in response.

Everyone had clearly seen Qin Zhao Yang instinctively unleashing a palm strike earlier that destroyed all of Jiang Chu He’s bones.

Nevertheless, no one dared to go against him at this moment as they started to surround Jiang Chu He. Unleashing various techniques, they bound him up, all while sizing him up with great curiosity.

Jiang Chu He seemed to have lost all conscious thought; not even the slightest shred of recognition appeared on his face despite coming face-to-face with several familiar faces. On the contrary, he continued to roar out, sending terrifying roars ringing out from his throat.

Outside of the city, Yang Kai continued to act like a mountain, standing right in front of the last hole. Unleashing his Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi, he blocked wave after wave of countless demonic creatures.

Utilising his Demon Eye of Annihilation to look ahead, the only thing he saw was a lone and miserable figure currently charging about wildly within the endless surging Demon Qi. Unleashing an unknown secret technique that was unexpectedly able to resist the Demon Qi’s corrosion, the figure fled madly towards Yang Kai’s position.

“Ah, great sir! You really are my saviour! Many thanks, many thanks great sir! This one will forever remember great sir’s benevolence! This one will definitely bow three times in the morning, and burn an incense in the evening to pray for this great sir to live to a hundred years old!”

As he flew rapidly towards Yang Kai, he continued to blabber incessantly!

This spiked Yang Kai’s curiosity greatly; this person’s movement skills were exceedingly deft and nimble. Although he was breaking through all of those demonic creatures by himself, he was unexpectedly doing so with ease, and not a single one of the demonic creatures managed to land an attack on him. He even had the time to give thanks to Yang Kai.

A frown appeared on Yang Kai’s face as he replied in anger, “A hundred years old isn’t a long lifespan for me! Are you trying to curse me to an early demise!”

“It’s just a saying, it’s just a saying...” The man seemed to notice his faux pas. However, by then, he had already arrived several dozen metres from Yang Kai.

“Shut up and hurry inside!” Yang Kai said impatiently, as he could see that the hole behind him was about to close up. Right after saying those words, he gave up caring about that person and turned around, rushing through the hole into the city.

“Wait for me, sir!” With a strange shout, that person abruptly accelerated, and in a brief instant, rushed up to Yang Kai’s side and into the city.

Without any more targets to attack, the countless demonic creatures and Demon Qi continued to gush into the city.

Nevertheless, how would the Array Masters waiting silently for their opportunity let them do as they wish? Dazzling flashes of light blossomed from their hands, transforming into streams of energy that flowed into the Spirit Array and the hole shrank rapidly, soon completely repaired!

Hong Hong Hong...

Demonic creatures continued to unleash attacks at the Spirit Array, while Demon Qi continued to surge forth. Nevertheless, everyone breathed a light sigh of relief. As long as the defensive Spirit Array was undamaged, they did not have to worry too much.

“You few, hurry up and strengthen the weak links here! Make sure that the demonic creatures never break the Spirit Array again!” Qin Zhao Yang roared at the few Array Masters present with a stern tone.

Accepting the command, the few Array Masters hastily grasped the Array Plates in their hands tightly.

“We’re really lucky to have you around this time, Little Brother Yang. Without you, Maplewood City might have...” A look of fear flashed past Qin Zhao Yang’s face as he cupped his hands towards Yang Kai in gratitude.

With the viciousness of the Demon Qi and demonic creatures outside of the city, he did not dare to belittle the earlier hole at all. If the Spirit Array hadn’t been able to be repaired, the endless Demon Qi that engulfed the city would definitely invade inwards. Among the tens of thousands of cultivators in Maplewood City, just how few would be able to defend against that?

He could almost visualise the terrible spectacle of despair that would envelop Maplewood City! If that really happened, he would be the sinner of Maplewood City, as protecting the city was his responsibility after all.

“There’s no need to be that modest, Old Sir Qin! It’s within my abilities!” Yang Kai waved his hand in response, and he took those remarks lightly. Instead, he started sizing up the person who had rushed into the city alongside him.

After an instant, a look of shock appeared on his face as he growled, “It’s you, you old swindler!”

Earlier, when he was outside of the city, Yang Kai did not pay much attention to that person’s face. Only now did he realize that the fellow who had rushed through all of the demonic creatures with boldness and bravery, turned out to be that wretched old swindler!

While in the black market, this old fellow had swindled a few thousand Source Crystals from Mo Xiao Qi. After that, before the opening of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, he had gone all over the place to peddle his Nine Revolutions Life Restoring Pill, which he claimed to be his ancestor’s and had some miraculous power to help people regrow their flesh, bones and even bring people back to life! And from the looks of it, his business had been great!

Never in his wildest dreams did Yang Kai imagine that this old swindler had such an outstanding side to him.

Not just any Origin King Realm cultivator could travel through Demon Qi as they wished. Although the old swindler appeared to be gasping for air, at the very least, he had managed to live another day.

Just this fact alone would raise the old swindler to a level that ordinary people could only dream to reach!

“There’s no need to say such horrible words, this sir...” After hearing Yang Kai’s way of addressing him, a rather embarrassed look appeared on the old swindler’s face. With a cheeky smile, he continued, “This old master is merely scraping by, I’ve never swindled anyone before.”

“Oh really?” Yang Kai grinned meaningfully as he shot a deep look at the old swindler.

A righteous look appeared on the old swindler’s face as he replied, “This old master has always treated buying and selling as fair business with reasonable prices. I definitely wouldn’t force others to buy and sell. It’s merely that some people have misunderstood this old master, that’s all, claiming that this old master is a swindler. That’s absolutely slander! This old master’s a businessman, where honesty is of the utmost importance!”

“It’s you, you old thing! Exactly what the hell is that Golden Rod Pill that you sold me last time...” All of a sudden, a cultivator stood out from the crowd. Looking at the old swindler with a face brimming with anger, he seemed to have suffered some kind of great loss.

“That thing didn’t work?” A look of surprise appeared on the old swindler’s face as he looked at that person, before replying in a baffled tone, “Of course. That pill was refined by this old master using my ancestor’s formula. Its efficacy is absolutely extraordinary. This brother, are you sure you followed the instructions properly?”

That cultivator asked with a strange look on his face, “Other than eating, what other way can the pill be used?”

The old swindler patted his leg and cried out in lament, “You idiot! How can you eat that Golden Rod Pill! You’re supposed to grind it to powder, before applying it on...your...!”

Right as he said those words, everyone’s eyes instantly snapped wide open, their eyeballs almost popping out of their sockets.

“Apply what? Apply on where?” Curious, Qin Yu asked with an innocent look on her face.

Qin Zhao Yang could not help but cough lightly in response. Nevertheless, unsure of whether to give a reply to her or not, an exceedingly embarrassed look appeared on his face. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Shooting his gaze towards Qin Yu, the old swindler waved his hands and said, “Don’t ask so many questions, little lass!”

Hearing his response, Qin Yu pouted her lips in anger.

Turning his attention back to the earlier cultivator, a vulgar look appeared on the old swindler’s face as he whispered, “Brother, don’t tell me you’ve really consumed it.”

That cultivator’s face turned red, though he did not give a reply.

Seeing this, the old swindler clapped his hands and continued with a wide grin, “Indeed, you’ve consumed it! Haha, you’re in luck, brother! Although you can consume that Golden Rod Pill, if you really did so, your golden rod will not turn limp for a full 49 days... Oh, let me calculate, the last time I saw you was...”

“Bastard!” That cultivator immediately turned angry with shame. Rushing up, he instantly unleashed a punch at the old swindler while shouting, “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth! Any brothers with grievances against this old fellow, let’s have a go at him!”

As his words rang out, several dozen people immediately rushed out from the crowd!

A wave of bangs rang out, mixed with the old swindler’s shrieks and cries for help. Just like a young girl who had been passed around by a dozen men, tears streamed from his eyes as an incomparably miserable look filled his face.

As the crowd looked over towards the first cultivator to have started the beating, looks of understanding proceeded to flash across their faces. So this was the reason why this brother of theirs had been wearing an extra-large set of robes for the past few days! Furthermore, he would frequently bend his waist forwards! Originally, they had assumed that he had suffered some kind of injury. So this was the hidden trouble he was facing!

That cultivator’s face turned beet red as he noticed the crowd’s gaze bearing down on him, causing him to bolt away hastily.

“Sigh...” At this moment, Qin Zhao Yang gave a light cough, before glancing at Yang Kai with concern. “Did you get injured, Little Brother Yang?”

“I’m alright!” Yang Kai replied while shaking his head.

“That’s good to hear,” Qin Zhao Yang seemed to breathe a sigh of relief. “The City Lord’s Mansion has already been notified of this matter. Your hard work was a major factor in allowing us to repair Spirit Array. City Lord Duan has said that when this demonic tribulation is over, he’ll confer you the position of 3rd Vice City Lord of Maplewood City, though he doesn’t know if Little Brother Yang will accept it or not!”

“Vice City Lord?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows in surprise, before giving a spiteful laugh. “It’s an honour to be held in such high regard by City Lord Duan. However, I’m not interested in being a Vice City Lord!”

“Haha, Little Brother Yang’s afraid of being bound by fetters, right? Although the position of Vice City Lord seems impressive, in reality, many responsibilities come along with it. Little Brother Yang’s choice is the intelligent one!” Qin Zhao Yang gave a hearty chuckle. For some unknown reason, his expression became much more relaxed. “ Rather than some Vice City Lord post, this old master feels that Little Brother Yang would be more unfettered by choosing an aristocratic family and becoming a Great Foreign Elder!”
