Chapter 5504: Still Not Awake?

Years passed before the two finally crossed that Late Ancient Era battlefield.

Wu Kuang could no longer stand it, “Brat, what are you planning? We’ve been travelling for almost 10 years. Are you certain this is where the No-Return Pass is?”

Over the last 10 years, the World Tree clone in his Small Universe had grown significantly, and the living beings he had taken in had gradually settled in, but they had yet to encounter a single Black Ink Clansman, which made Wu Kuang lose patience.

When Yang Kai knew that lying was no longer an option, he said, “We’re not heading to the No-Return Pass.”

Wu Kuang exclaimed in rage, “You lied to me!?”

Yang Kai ignored him and continued, “From Chaos, Heaven and Earth first split apart and the first Primordial Light was born alongside the Primordial Darkness.”

Yang Kai began to speak of the many secrets he heard from Cang back then.

Since Wu Kuang had lived longer than him yet never heard about any of this before, he was quickly fascinated and set aside his anger.

The Divine Spirits of the Primordial Era, Monster Race of the Early Ancient Era, the Human Race of the Late Ancient Era…

The change of dominance of these Races represented the change of each era.

Though Yang Kai explained it nonchalantly, Wu Kuang felt as if he personally experienced the unfolding of the events during that time and finally understood the origins of Mo.

After Yang Kai finished speaking, Wu Kuang pondered for a long time and asked, “As you said, if we want to completely eradicate the Black Ink Clan, we need to find the Primordial Light?”

“Indeed.”

Wu Kuang frowned, “How do we find that thing?”

“I already have some clues, but you shouldn’t be concerned about this.”

[I’m too lazy to care anyways,] Wu Kuang thought.

“Wu Kuang, is the Heaven Devouring Battle Law really a Secret Art created by you?” Yang Kai questioned afterwards.

Wu Kuang snorted, “Of course it was created by this King. In this world, is there anyone else who can use this Secret Art?”

Yang Kai shook his head in response, “The Star Boundary is located in a remote corner of the 3,000 Worlds where the Martial Dao is still quite underdeveloped. No matter how gifted you are, without having been in contact with the outside world, how would you be able to create such a magnificent Secret Art like the Heaven Devouring Battle Law? Have you ever wondered why this Secret Art can assist you to quickly enhance your cultivation even up to this day?”

1,000 years ago, the strongest Masters in the Star Boundary were the Great Emperors. It would still be reasonable if the Heaven Devouring Battle Law was only useful up to that level, as it would still remain within the scope of what the Star Boundary’s Martial Dao allowed. However, this Secret Act was still helping Wu Kuang climb through the Open Heaven Realm, which should be impossible.

Wu Kuang frowned this time, but instead of speaking aggressively, he just asked, “What are you trying to say?”

“I don’t think you personally created this Secret Art. It may be regarded as your creation in a certain sense, but… it may not be created by you in this life!”

Wu Kuang was stunned and looked at Yang Kai with a menacing gleam in his eyes, but that was ignored by Yang Kai.

Only after a long time did Wu Kuang calm his thoughts; after all, Yang Kai revealed his biggest secret in one go, which utterly shocked him.

Then, Wu Kuang nodded, “Yes, the Heaven Devouring Battle Law may not have been created by me; however, when I was young, I frequently dreamed of some fragments of this Secret Art in my sleep, which is the foundation of the Heaven Devouring Battle Law. If I cultivated according to it, my strength grew steadily, and the Heaven Devouring Battle Law was fully perfected once I became a Great Emperor!”

It was not as if Wu Kuang hadn’t given this matter any thought. He understood why he had dreams about the Secret Art and knew that with it, he could become a Great Emperor.

It was because, in his previous life, he was already one!

In the Shattered Star Sea, he killed multiple Great Emperors all on his own thanks to the Heaven Devouring Battle Law.

Over the years, as his cultivation strengthened, Wu Kuang frequently saw visions that he had never experienced before and vaguely suspected that there was more to his origin than met the eye.

Wu Kuang had also come into contact with the theory of reincarnation, even suspecting that he was such a case, but he had no evidence either way.

It was just that he did not expect nor wish for all of this to be revealed by Yang Kai so suddenly.

“Is there something that made you aware of this?” Wu Kuang asked solemnly.

Yang Kai remained silent and just led him forward.

After a short pause, Wu Kuang stopped asking. He knew that Yang Kai would tell him when it was time. If he refused to say anything now, then it was not time yet.

Half a year passed before Yang Kai finally stopped and Wu Kuang hurriedly halted as well.

Just as he was going to ask, he felt something, looked up, and his pupils immediately shrank.

A massive void filled with Warship debris and innumerable dismembered Black Ink Clansmen could be seen in front of them.

Wu Kuang even caught a glimpse of a magnificent Great Pass that was seemingly ripped apart by some overwhelming force.

This was a grand battlefield!

Wu Kuang quickly came to his senses. This must be a recent battlefield as the Warships seemed familiar to Wu Kuang, like the ones the Humans used when he was fighting with the Great Evaluation Army in the Barren Territory.

“This is…” He turned to look at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai kept his silence before saying, “The battlefield outside the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. This is where the Human Race’s Crusade Force first arrived, and where we met our first defeat.”

Wu Kuang immediately understood as he had heard about the battle at the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction too. He just did not expect that he had followed Yang Kai all the way here, travelling for 10 years straight.

Yang Kai then pointed forward, “Beyond this battlefield is the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, which is also the origin of the Black Ink Clan. There, the True Body of Mo is sealed.”

Wu Kuang experienced a startling surge of emotion.

The origin of the Black Ink Clan was already not a secret. The Royal Lords, Territory Lords, Feudal Lords, and even the Black Ink Giant Spirit Gods were all created by Mo, showing how powerful Mo was.

“At the end of the Late Ancient Era, the 10 Martial Ancestors received enlightenment from the World Tree to comprehend the Open Heaven Realm. It was under the instructions of the Heavenly Way. Those 10 were well aware of the dangers Mo posed, and they worked extremely hard to set up this Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction to seal it. Though they were able to seal Mo, they were unable to completely destroy it. After millions of years, guarding this place, they passed away, one after another, leaving only one in the end. When the Human Race Army arrived here, we met an individual who called himself Cang. It was also through him that the Human Race learned about the secrets of the past.

“Unfortunately, Cang also passed away during the battle here. Currently, this place is no longer guarded. Though Mo is still in a deep sleep thanks to the final trick left behind by another Master, no one knows when it will awaken. If no one stands guard over this place, no one will be able to stop it, and the 3,000 Worlds will be unable to resist.”

“Fortunately, before Cang passed away, he gave me something. And now… I will hand it over to you!”

Saying so, Yang Kai stretched out a finger towards Wu Kuang. Instinctively, Wu Kuang wanted to dodge, but that was impossible in the face of Yang Kai’s vastly superior strength. As Space Principles inundated, he was made immobile.

Wu Kuang could only watch helplessly as Yang Kai tapped a golden light onto his forehead with his fingertips.

In an instant, Wu Kuang trembled hard and his vision went blank.

“Shi, are you still not awake?” Yang Kai said in a deep voice.

Although his voice was soft, it rang like a bell in Wu Kuang’s head. Following the burst of the golden light that Yang Kai placed on him, memories of the past flooded Wu Kuang.

That golden light was actually a piece of Wu Kuang’s past life’s Soul, which had preserved all of his memories.

Back then, when Cang activated the Heaven Devouring Battle Law in front of him, Yang Kai immediately recognised it and hit the mark with a single comment.

Cang was equally as shocked; after all, an old friend of his created this Secret Art millions of years ago. However, Yang Kai was able to recognize the Heaven Devouring Battle Law at a glance, which revealed a lot to him.

After talking with Yang Kai, Cang learned that there was a man named Wu Kuang in this world who also cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Law.

Since then, Cang concluded that Wu Kuang was the reincarnation of his friend, because the Heaven Devouring Battle Law was a Secret Act created by Shi.

For precisely these reasons, Cang offered Yang Kai the part of Shi’s Soul that the latter had left in his keeping.

Yang Kai wasn’t aware of what he had been given at the time; still, a Royal Lord pursued him all the way to the Great Sea Celestial Phenomenon for it.

Over the years, Yang Kai had also come to understand the importance of the mission Cang had given to him before he passed away. Subsequently, he began to inquire about Wu Kuang when he was in the Shattered Heaven, hoping to find him.

In the end, by fate, Yang Kai met Wu Kuang in a random Great Territory, as ordained by Heaven’s Will.

Now that he had returned that Soul wisp, completing the mission entrusted to him by Cang, Yang Kai heaved a sigh of relief while turning to stare at the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction.

Though Wu Kuang was the reincarnation of that Martial Ancestor, he was not Shi himself.

Before Shi was about to pass away, he sent another piece of his Soul away, hoping to be reincarnated, in an effort to find a solution to destroy Mo after his death.

After so many years without any news, Cang thought Shi had failed.

Now that Wu Kuang was brought back by Yang Kai and given back the preserved bit of Shi’s Soul, Yang Kai wasn’t sure if Wu Kuang would do as Cang wished.

The Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction needed to be guarded; otherwise, once Mo woke up, it could not be held captive.

The best person to guard this place was none other than Wu Kuang.

Yang Kai secretly made up his mind that if Wu Kuang was unwilling, he would beat him until he was willing, after all, Wu Kuang was currently not his opponent. So, doing so would not be hard.

The Soul fragment exploded, and information about Shi filled Wu Kuang’s mind, causing his expression to continuously change.

Several days later, Wu Kuang regained consciousness and was plainly lost in thought.

Rather than the free and unfettered Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, he was now unexpectedly burdened with tremendous responsibility, which made him feel somewhat uncomfortable.

After observing him in silence for some time, Yang Kai asked, “Do you now understand everything?”

Wu Kuang nodded.

Many questions in this life had now been answered, including how he was able to acquire the Heaven Devouring Battle Law in his dreams when he was a child, and why there were no restrictions when he broke through, even in the Open Heaven Realm. Although he only directly ascended to the Fifth Order, he felt that he had the potential to reach the Ninth Order. After he received that bit of Soul left by Shi, Wu Kuang now possessed vastly more knowledge than Yang Kai.

Now, Wu Kuang couldn’t even tell if he was the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor or Shi.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com
