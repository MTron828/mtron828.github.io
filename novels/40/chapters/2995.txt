“Exile!” Yang Kai shouted as he stretched out his hand in front of himself, causing space to warp and tear apart. Subsequently, all the poisonous animals were sucked into the collapsed space and exiled into the endless Void, vanishing in the blink of an eye.

“A Space Technique!” The black-robed man exclaimed. At first, he wanted to exchange a few blows with Yang Kai; however, he immediately dispelled his original idea upon seeing the power of Yang Kai’s Divine Ability. Pushing his Emperor Qi, with a flick of his robe, the man’s entire body suddenly became indiscernible, as if he had melted into the surrounding air around him.

It was obviously a profound escape method. When used, it made it hard for others to grasp his movements and the slightest bit of carelessness from them would allow him to escape without a trace.

“Why run? You should stay!” Yang Kai coldly snorted as Space Principles surged, enveloping the surrounding space. The man’s faded figure appeared again as a squeezing force from the surrounding space broke his Secret Technique in an instant and forced him to reveal himself.

At that moment, the black-robed man panicked. He had long heard that Masters proficient in the Dao of Space were not to be trifled with; however, he had not expected his opponent to be so strong. Although both their cultivations were in the First-Order Emperor Realm, Yang Kai seemed so much stronger that it was difficult to believe their realms were the same. Thus, the black-robed man no longer had the confidence to fight against Yang Kai.

Forcibly pushing his own power, he tried to escape the constraints of the Space Principles, but before he had a chance to succeed, a large hand reached out from the front and grabbed him by the neck. Then, a surge of power flooded into his meridians, scattering his strength. The black-robed man immediately lost all strength to resist and as a result was lifted up like a helpless chicken, unable to move a single muscle.

Yang Kai snorted and a burst of energy tore apart the headpiece covering the black-robed man’s head. Consequently, a scarred and pitted face that looked like it had been burned by boiling water was revealed. It was a horrifying and sickening appearance that made one shudder at the sight.

The struggle between the two might have been short, but it still created a commotion, attracting the attention of many local residents the moment their powers clashed. As soon as the black-robed man’s true appearance was revealed, bursts of exclamations rang out from the crowd.

“Poison Lord Bu Hong!”

“Why is he here?!”

“Damn! How could Wind and Cloud Pavilion let that monster out?!”

“Hurry up and run! This place is dangerous! We can’t stay here! Death and destruction always follow the Poison Lord’s appearance!”

“Why are you running? Don’t you see that Bu Hong has been restrained? Tsk. Tsk. Just who is that young man, I can’t believe how amazing he is!”

“Are you blind? How could the Poison Lord be captured so easily? That little brat is done for. No, no way. I have to leave quickly. If I don’t leave now, I might never get the chance to leave this place again!”

The crowd became quite noisy and many people rushed out of the city desperately, as if that black-robed man was a scourge and they would lose their lives if they fled even a little slower.

“It looks like you’re pretty famous,” Yang Kai pointed out, looking ahead coldly.

Bu Hong smiled deviously, “Little brat, you’re dead! My body is full of poisons. If you had not approached me, I might not have been a match for you, but you just had to recklessly try and capture me without fear of death!”

While Bu Hong was talking, a viridian aura flowed into Yang Kai’s hand and spread along his arm like a green snake climbing upward. It moved very swiftly and disappeared into the sleeves of his clothes in the blink of an eye.

Yang Kai looked down and absent-mindedly said, “With this rubbish of a poison of yours?”

Bu Hong was clearly affronted, but just as he was about to retort with vicious words, he widened his eyes in astonishment as he stared at Yang Kai’s arm incredulously. Then, Yang Kai pulled up his sleeves as the green aura became stuck at his elbow, unable to advance any further.

A drop of cold sweat dripped from Bu Hong’s forehead as he uttered in shock, “How is that possible?! How did you resist my poison?!”

Yang Kai replied indifferently, “As long as one’s body is strong enough, it can protect itself against any kind of poison!”

“Impossible! That’s absolutely impossible!” Bu Hong’s eyes trembled violently, as if he had received a terrible shock. Even a Third-Order Emperor should be unable to resist his poisons! How could a mere First-Order Emperor Realm brat remain safe in front of him?

Even though Yang Kai had been poisoned, the poison was being blocked below his elbow. It couldn’t spread to the rest of his body. Therefore, Bu Hong simply couldn’t accept it. Just how strong does one’s body have to be to resist his poison?

Now that his biggest trump card had failed to produce results, he finally panicked for real. He could feel Yang Kai’s murderous intent and the increasing strength gripping around his neck and hurriedly said, “You might have a way to detoxify my poison, but what about the little girl? If you want her to live, you have to obediently release me! Perhaps, she might still have a chance of survival then.”

Yang Kai snorted in response, “You don’t need to worry about her! Have a safe journey to the afterlife!” As soon as the words left his mouth, he pushed Emperor Qi into his hand.

With a soft snap, Bu Hong’s neck was squeezed so hard that it exploded and his head flew up into the air. Bu Hong’s eyes were as wide as saucers as he retained a shocked expression on his face, as if he had yet to realize what was going on. Up until the moment of his death, he still could not understand why this young man was so unconcerned about the life and death of that little girl.

As the mutilated body fell from the air, Yang Kai reached out his hand and took Bu Hong’s Space Ring.

When the crowd of onlookers saw what happened and were so shocked by the situation that they were rendered completely speechless. Poison Lord Bu Hong was dead! Poison Lord Bu Hong, who caused disasters in the Western Territory for centuries and had left more than a dozen cities in ruins in his wake, had been killed so effortlessly! Moreover, he had died so miserably, crushed to death by a young man with one hand.

After a long period of silence, cheers suddenly rang out from the crowd below. Eyes filled with admiration and gratitude looked up at Yang Kai as if he had done something to be applauded.

It certainly was a good thing though. Poison Lord Bu Hong had used many cultivators in the Western Territory as his experimental subjects when concocting his poisons. On many occasions, he poisoned entire cities just to test out the effects of his new poison and concealed himself in the city to observe the results. Numerous cities had been wiped out by him and countless people had lost their lives. As such, the people in the Western Territory hated the very mention of the Poison Lord.

Although Bu Hong’s cultivation wasn’t high, the poisons he cultivated were unpredictable and difficult to deal with. Many Second-Order Emperor Realm Masters had died at his hands. Later, Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters had tried to hunt him down, but unfortunately, Bu Hong had taken shelter inside Wind and Cloud Pavilion. It had been a long time since he last showed up in public and he certainly never expected to meet his death just like that.

Ignoring the cheers coming from below, Yang Kai silently circulated his Secret Art to force out the poison in his arm. Bu Hong’s poison really was quite amazing and if it were Yang Kai from a few years ago, he probably would have succumbed to it as well.

However, ever since he started cultivating the Dragon Transformation Secret Art, drawing out the Golden Divine Dragon’s Source Strength, a trace of the Dragon Clan’s bloodline had been added to his physique, dramatically increasing his body’s resistance to poison.

The true members of the Dragon Clan had an incredible resistance towards all forms of negative conditions. A Master of the Dragon Clan was even more invincible and impervious to all sorts of poisons.

Although Yang Kai could not compare to the true members of the Dragon Clan, it was sufficient to resist Bu Hong’s poison. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

A short while later, a drop of viridian poison was forced out of Yang Kai’s fingertip. The poison might be small in amount but it contained enough power to destroy an entire city. Pushing his Space Principles, Yang Kai exiled the poison to the Void.

Shifting his body slightly, he returned to the private room and saw a mess on the table. All the food had been polished off cleanly. Meanwhile, Lin Yun’er spread her palms open and was carefully licking her fingers clean, one by one.

Yang Kai sweated profusely. It must not have been easy to be this girl’s Master. Just how much would it cost to keep this bottomless glutton fed?

“Are you back, Uncle Yang?” She looked up at him and smiled so widely that her eyes squinted.

“Ah… en,” he nodded. Then, he pensively asked, “Were you planning to head towards Wind and Cloud Pavilion?”

“That’s right,” upon hearing his question, her pretty face sank and her expression turned frosty, “The people of Wind and Cloud Pavilion are too much! From what I heard from their Young Pavilion Master, it seems that he has imprisoned many innocent women and girls in his home. I want to rescue them.” After saying that, her expression changed drastically and she slammed her palms down on the table and stood up.

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

“I don’t know where the Wind and Cloud Pavilion is!” She looked at him with an aggrieved yet innocent expression.

The corners of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched in response, “Then, how did you find your way before?”

She laughed in embarrassment, “I was just moving about randomly.”

Yang Kai suddenly felt a headache coming on but somehow pushed it aside and muttered, “Forget it. I’ll go with you.”

There was nothing urgent that Yang Kai needed to do at the moment. He originally wanted to search for Zu Qing and her brother, but it seemed as though the two of them had left this place a long time ago, so it was meaningless to continue chasing after them. Besides, he could meet them again when he returned to the Northern Territory; on the other hand, it was not easy for him to meet Lin Yun’er, so she naturally became the priority.

The little girl might be powerful, but there would always be people in this world that she could not afford to provoke. With her innocent and na?ve personality, he did not know what trouble she might get herself into; therefore, it was better for him to just go along with her.

When Lin Yun’er heard those words, her eyes lit up, “Uncle Yang, you’re the best!” She rushed over and hugged his arm, squeezing herself up against him.

Feeling an amazing softness pressing against his arm, Yang Kai earnestly said, “Yun’er, you’re all grown up. You are a big girl now.”

She nodded repeatedly, “En, en.”

He continued, “Since you are a big girl now, there are some things that you can’t continue doing like before.”

“En, en!”

He opened his mouth again but swallowed the words that were on the tip of his tongue before sighing to himself. This little girl had been sheltered too much, never having been outside in all these years, so she had no clue about the differences between men and women nor how to act appropriately… She was too pure, so why should he be the one who leaves a black mark on her with worldly ideas?

Giving up on educating her, Yang Kai was about to say something else when he frowned slightly and scanned his surroundings warily, releasing his Divine Sense out like a rushing tide.

“What happened?” Lin Yun’er asked anxiously, noting his strange behaviour.

“Did you just feel something?” Yang Kai quickly asked.

“I did,” She nodded immediately.

“You felt it too?” He was looking around, straining his sense to the maximum. For some reason, he had felt a sudden trace of hostility directed at him for a moment; however, there was no trace of it now, so it made him wonder whether it had simply been an illusion.

“En, I feel very comfortable!”

Yang Kai was speechless while Lin Yun’er giggled in response, hugging his arm even tighter without any care.

Afterwards, the two of them left the restaurant and asked around for directions to Wind and Cloud Pavilion. Then, Yang Kai immediately summoned his Flowing Clouds Shuttle and led Lin Yun’er aboard before it took off like a stream of light into the distance.
