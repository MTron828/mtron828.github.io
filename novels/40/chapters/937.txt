Chapter 938, Alter

Inside the Beguiling Demon Queen’s palace, Lightning Flash Shadow King proudly stood with an unyielding look filling his face.

Glancing over at him, Yang Kai simply waved his hand and said, “Go, I have no interest in killing you.”

Shadow King was stunned by this and stared towards Yang Kai, seemingly not having imagined he would let him go.

Over the past decade, he had constantly been disguising himself as a lowly beggar because he was afraid that the masters from the Central Capital would seek him out. Now that he had accidentally fallen into Yang Kai’s hands, did he really have a chance to survive?

“Haven’t left yet?” Yang Kai snorted.

Shadow King grit his teeth as the veins on his forehead throbbed. He was once a supreme ruler, the Lightning Flash Shadow King who struck fear into the hearts of this entire world’s common people, yet now he was actually so despised by the young man in front of him, deemed not even worth the effort to kill. Never before had he felt so humiliated.

In his heart, the idea of going all out with Yang Kai began to rise.

But in the end, he endured it and coldly snapped, “Shang Qing Luo went to the Spider Mother’s den before leaving, apparently she found something of interest there. If you’re planning to search for her, you might find some clues there.”

After saying so, Shadow King shot off like lightning and disappeared.

“The Spider Mother’s Den...” Yang Kai muttered to himself. Naturally, he remembered this place. It was where the Seventh-Order Monster Beast, the Spider Mother lived.

The Spider Mother was the only Seventh-Order Monster Beast in this entire world.

Shan Qing Luo’s Poison Widow Body special constitution originated from her, as did the life threatening toxin which plagued her lineage. The only cure to this poison was the Spider Mother’s monster core.

“Young Master Yang...” Yun Li called out, “Are you going to find Mistress Demon Queen?”

“I’ll go take a look. She’s not necessarily there, en, she should be long gone in fact.”

“En, then Young Master Yang must take care along the way,” Yun Li, Ruo Yu, and Ruo Qing nodded lightly, not making any attempt to dissuade him.

Yang Kai swept his eyes over them and suddenly asked, “Your Mistress is no longer here, so why do you remain?”

Yun Li smiled mirthlessly, “Where can we go? As long as we stay here at least we don’t have to worry about having a place to sleep, but if we were to leave, with our appearances and strength, Young Master Yang should be clear of the consequences.”

This mature woman and two young girls were all quite beautiful and their strength wasn’t very high, if they left the safety of this palace and travelled outside, they would no doubt degenerate into playthings for unscrupulous men.

“If I offered to take you away, would you accept?” Yang Kai asked on the spur of the moment.

Yun Li eyes brightened as she exchanged a quick glance with Ruo Yu and Ruo Qing before all three of them nodded, “Yes, we would happily accept Young Master Yang’s offer. If we travel with you, perhaps one day we may reunite with Mistress and continue to serve her.”

“Then go tidy up your affairs and pack, I’ll return as soon as possible to pick you up. Right, if I recall correctly, there should be other maids besides you three, yes? Ask them if they wish to come as well,” Yang Kai instructed before departing.

Half an hour later, above the Spider Mother’s Den.

Yang Kai stood high up in the air and overlooked the giant spider statue down below.

He had never thought about it before, but staring at it now, more than a decade later, he couldn’t help wondering how this giant spider statue came to exist, suddenly feeling like something was unusual about it.

There used to be countless giant spiders here as well as the Spider Mother herself, but in the end, they were just Monster Beasts, so it was impossible for them to have built such a statue.

Moreover, this statue seemed to be quite ancient, staring at its weather worn traces, Yang Kai estimated that it was at least ten thousand years old.

At this moment, there were no signs of activity inside the Spider Mother’s lair. After the death of the Spider Mother, the giant spiders who lived here had apparently scattered, so when Yang Kai arrived, he did not see any traces of life at all.

Landing, Yang Kai walked up to the front of the statue and entered into its giant maw.

Inside the statue, there was a huge space, covered in spider webs with a thick layer of dust spread across its floor. Obviously no one had come here for many years.

Yang Kai was looking around when something suddenly caught his eye. Turning towards a certain location, he saw a kind of altar with a strange chart or formation carved onto its surface. In addition, there were some dark stains in various places atop the alter.

Yang Kai instantly recognized the dark stains as dried up old blood.

This altar was not very big, at most large enough to accommodate two or three people standing on top of it. Yang Kai examined it carefully and quickly discovered two distinct sets of footprints that, because of the dried bloodstains had not been erased by time.

Were these two sets of footprints left behind by Shan Qing Luo and Bi Luo?

Yang Kai couldn’t be certain about these footprints, but he was certain that there were traces of Void Energy lingering about this alter.

The altar had been damaged, with many cracks running across it. When Yang Kai reached out and touched it, even though he didn’t use any strength at all, the alter actually crumbled to pieces.

Staring blankly at the scene in front of him, Yang Kai heart pounded.

From the strange chart engraved onto it and the remnant Void Energy aura, it was not difficult for Yang Kai to conclude that this was once the entrance to a Void Corridor.

If the two pairs of blood-stained footprints were really left behind by Shan Qing Luo and Bi Luo, they must have left this world through that Void Corridor.

But where did they go?

When he last separated from this devilish woman, she was only a First-Order Transcendent! That kind of strength was nothing in Tong Xuan Realm. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

After inspecting it for a while, yet not discovering any other useful clues, Yang Kai left the giant spider statue and flew up into the air, lifting his palm towards the sky.

Heaven Covering Hand!

A huge palm descended from the sky and landed on the spider statue, shattering the rocks and collapsing it entirely, dust flying as it was buried underground forever.

Yang Kai’s mood was quite complicated

When he left the Central Capital earlier today, he had planned to visit two places and bring the people there back with him to Tong Xuan Realm, but Xiao Fu Sheng of Medicine King’s Valley had passed away and Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan were unwilling to leave him, while Shan Qing Luo had actually left Fragrance City long ago and was nowhere to be found.

He had failed to achieve anything he had set out to do.

Helpless to do anything about all this, Yang Kai returned to Fragrance City just as Yun Li and the other maids finished their preparations. In addition to Ruo Yu, and Ruo Qing, there were indeed two other maids staying in the palace, all of whom Yang Kai brought back with him to the Central Capital.

After half a day, he once again returned to the Yang Family.

Seeing Yang Kai bring back five beauties, the expressions of Li Rong and Han Fei suddenly became strange.

Yang Kai was too lazy to explain to them and simply asked his father to make arrangements for Yun Li and the others. Before finding Shan Qing Luo again, these five women would serve as Yang Family maids.

Yang Ying Feng easily agreed.

“Yang Kai!”

“Cousin!”

Two voices suddenly called out and when Yang Kai turned around to see who it was, he found Dong Qing Han and Dong Qing Yan running over towards him.

Fatty Dong wasn’t fat anymore; having lost what seemed to be several dozen kilograms, leaving behind a tall and imposing figure.

Dong Qing Yan on the other hand had matured into a woman. What should be big was big, and what should be small was small, making for quite a pretty picture.

Yang Kai’s mood instantly brightened as he smiled warmly.

When he came back a few days ago, he had met many old friends, but he had not actually seen anyone from the Dong Family. It wasn’t until today that his two cousins had appeared in front of him.

Dong Qing Yan rushed over, her beautiful eyes looking Yang Kai over as she smiled, “Cousin, after ten years of not seeing you, you’ve become more handsome.”

“And your mouth has become quite sweet,” Yang Kai nodded with satisfaction, but how could he have imagined that Dong Qing Yan would grin mischievously and stretch out her hand towards him, “So what kind of gift does cousin have for me to commemorate our reunion?”

Yang Kai was stunned.

Fatty Dong just laughed as he stared at Yang Kai, clearly taking pleasure in his misfortune.

“I’ll give you this,” Yang Kai took out a single piece of Crystal Stone and handed it over to Dong Qing Yan, saying in a serious tone, “This is a rare and precious treasure. It contains a lot of pure energy that can be directly absorbed and transformed into True Qi, it is extremely beneficial whether it is used to restore oneself or to cultivate.”

Dong Qing Yan’s eyes lit up as she tightly gripped the piece of Crystal Stone and praised liberally, “This thing is so pretty, just like a huge gem. Is cousin really giving this to me?”

“Do you think cousin will try to take back the gifts he sends out?”

“Thank you, cousin!” Dong Qing Yan cried out happily, carefully storing the Crystal Stone into her purse, a look of satisfaction on her face.

Seeing this, Li Rong and Han Fei, who were standing nearby, didn’t have the heart to see this young girl deceived by Yang Kai and quickly explained to her that Crystal Stones were just ordinary items, slowly shaking their heads as they laughed lightly.

“Little sister, go outside the play for a bit, I have something to discuss with Yang Kai,” Dong Qing Han shot Dong Qing Yan a meaningful glance.

“Hmph, trying to be mysterious, obviously you’re not going to discuss anything good,” Dong Qing Yan snorted and quickly dashed off.

When it was just the two cousins, Dong Qing Han’s expression became serious as he stared at Yang Kai and asked, “I heard that you want to bring the entire Yang Family to a place called Tong Xuan Realm.”

“En, what does your Dong Family intend to do? My mother should have passed on the relevant information to you, yes?”

“After receiving Aunt and Uncle’s message, I hurried over. The rest of the Dong Family is currently packing up and preparing to accompany your Yang Family,” Dong Qing Han asked solemnly, “Is this information really reliable?”

“Do you believe I’d let my entire family go with me if it weren’t? I’m not one to play such distasteful pranks,” Yang Kai raised his brow.

“Naturally I understand that, it’s just... Suddenly having to leave our homes and travel to some unknown place is really somewhat nerve-wracking.”

“You’ll slowly get used to it,” Yang Kai comforted, “When I first arrived on the other side, I also felt quite lost, but there were many more wonderful things and opportunities over there for us young people.”

“Haha!” Dong Qing Han laughed, “I was just asking casually. Since Qiu Yi Meng decided to go with you, there shouldn’t be an issue. Frankly speaking, I believe in the Qiu Family’s First Young Lady’s vision more than cousin’s words.”

Yang Kai was dumbstruck.

“When does your Yang Family plan to depart?”

“As soon as possible, the journey will be quite long. From here to our destination, it will be at least three to four months. If there are delays on the road, it could take even longer.”

“So long?” Dong Qing Han gawked.

“The vastness of Tong Xuan Realm is far beyond your imagination. Since that’s the case, there’s no need for your Dong Family to meet up with the Yang Family in the Central Capital; it would be best if you sent them a letter telling them to head to High Heaven Pavilion after they finish packing. I will be bringing the Yang Family people there as well.”

“Good.” Dong Qing Han nodded firmly, “I’ll go arrange it.”
