If others dared to say that Cang Guo was disgusting, he would have already rushed at the opposite party and torn him or her apart.

But the person in front of him had the right to speak this way. Without even mentioning that Cang Guo was very fond of her, he also wasn’t as strong as Luan Feng.

There were naturally differences in strength between each Divine Spirit. In ancient times, there was even a ranking for the Divine Spirits, with the Dragon and Phoenix Clans reigning atop that list. Compared to these two Divine Spirit Clans, the Divine Spirits at the bottom of the rankings weren’t even in the same class.

Luan Feng was from a branch of the Phoenix Clan, so although her strength couldn’t be compared with her ancestors’, it was still immense, especially her World Extinguishing Black Flames, which had extraordinary power.

Among the Four Great Divine Venerables of the Ancient Lands, Luan Feng was the strongest. This was something the other Divine Venerables couldn’t deny. It was just that these four had been living in the Ancient Wild Lands for millennia now and would not fight with each other unless it was absolutely necessary. Even though Luan Feng was a bit more powerful, in a life or death battle, the other three wouldn’t be easy for her to deal with. Even if they couldn’t kill her, they would be able to severely injure her.

The four Divine Venerables barely maintained a state of mutual checks and balances in the Ancient Lands.

After being severely despised by Luan Feng, Cang Guo inevitably became angry out of shame and lashed out, “These eyes belong to this King, this King will look wherever he wants to look!”

Luan Feng’s movements abruptly stopped as she slightly raised her eyes, a cold gleam flashing across their depths as she stared at Cang Guo. Right then, she suddenly opened her mouth and lightly exhaled towards him.

A wisp of pitch-black flame shot out of her mouth, straight towards Chag Guo like a snake.

“World Extinguishing Black Flame!” Cang Guo’s expression drastically changed as he realized that his joke had gone a little too far. Luan Feng had actually attacked him, forcing him to hurriedly back away while fiercely palming forward.

This palm shattered space and reduced the entire stone pavilion to rubble.

Several figures suddenly jumped up, hovering in the air.

“What the heck are you two doing?” Fan Wu coldly glared at Cang Guo and Luan Feng, shouting at them, “Why do you do this every time you meet!?”

Luan Feng flicked her silky hair over her shoulder and indifferently replied, “He is the one that provokes this Queen every single time.”

Cang Guo immediately blew his top and angrily rebuked, “This King just took a few glances at you, that’s all. It’s not like you lost anything! But you actually tried to attack this King! Do you really think that this King is that easy to bully?”

Luan Feng coldly glared at him and snorted, “I may not have lost anything, but your gaze feels extremely disgusting. This Queen was uncomfortable, so she had to remedy the situation.”

Cang Guo lashed back, “Good, good, this King has been bearing you for not just a day or two! Since you look down on this King so much, let’s decide today who is the better!”

“Good!” Luan Feng turned around, looking like she had been waiting for this. She coldly smiled and stated, “This Queen has been wanting to kill you for not just a day or two either. Since you are asking for death, this Queen might as well fulfill your wish!”

“You two…” Fan Wu’s face turned colder and immediately shouted, grinding his teeth, “That’s enough!”

He seemed to have some prestige among the four, so when he spoke, whether it was Cang Guo or Luan Feng, they stopped in place, both of them turning their heads and coldly scoffing.

“So many problems have cropped up this time, yet instead of working together, you have started internal strife!” Fan Wu looked exasperated from their failure to meet his expectations, “Is it fun to make a joke of yourselves before your subordinates?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Both Cang Guo and Luan Feng, who were reprimanded, looked embarrassed and pouted.

The group of Monster Race members were currently staring at the former site of the Stone Pavilion with widened eyes. It seemed as if they couldn’t fathom why the high and mighty Divine Venerables were unable to cooperate and even attacked each other.

“And you!” Fan Wu looked at Shi Huo.

“What does any of this have to do with me?” Shi Huo shook his head with an innocent look on his face.

“Every time, you are just enjoying the show! Why don’t you try to stop them?” Fan Wu rebuffed, coldly snorting.

Shi Huo muttered with an unhappy look on his face, “They are fighting while I’m watching, the two are irrelevant to each other.”

Fan Wu’s brow twitched a few times before a resigned look appeared on his face. Only after a long time did he finally calm down, “Due to the changes of the Blood Gate and the sudden propagation of bloodline attraction, the Ancient Lands creatures are all moving strangely. If the four of us weren’t personally overseeing things here, the Monster Kings under us might have already tried to enter the Blood Gate. Everyone might have already inherited their ancestors’ Source Strength and memories. You should know what secrets lie inside the Blood Gate. In the past, ‘that’ Master wielding the Heaven’s Order Sword had almost exterminated all Divine Spirits from this world. Our ancestors somehow escaped that disaster. You don’t want that person’s power to reappear and make us flee about with nowhere to hide, right?”

Hearing him talk about ‘that’ Master, the other three Divine Venerables’ expressions couldn’t help but sink.

In the Ancient Lands, even the thirty-two Monster Kings were oblivious to most of the secrets of the Blood Gate, but that wasn’t the case for these four. The four had inherited the Source Strength and bloodline memories of their ancestors, so they clearly knew about what exactly was sealed inside the Blood Gate.

There weren’t just countless Divine Spirit Sources inside, but also the Heaven’s Order Sword that could make all Divine Spirits in the world tremble in fear at the mere mention of its name!

If someone broke the Blood Gate seal and allowed that sword to reappear in this world, there would be nowhere in the Star Boundary what would be safe for them anymore, and the four of them would undoubtedly be the first to bear the brunt of this catastrophe.

The four of them had personally moved because of the seriousness of this matter. They were here to supervise and had ordered all thirty-two Monster Kings under them to guard the surrounding area to prevent anyone from approaching the Blood Gate. They wanted to prevent the breaking of Blood Gate’s seal and the reappearance of the Heaven’s Order Sword no matter what.

Seeing the three go silent, Fan Wu lightly added with a nod, “As long as the four of us remain of one heart and one mind, even the Monster Kings under us would not dare to trespass into the Blood Gate Restricted Area no matter how much they want to. We can sit back and relax after we weather through this, but if you really start fighting seriously, the Monster Kings under us will definitely take advantage of the chaos caused. Once an accident occurs at the Blood Gate, who will be able to bear the responsibility?”

His words were well justified and well-founded, so the other three Divine Venerables had to nod in agreement. Cang Guo and Luan Feng also reigned in their hostility, understanding that now wasn’t the right time for infighting.

…

Thirty kilometres outside the Blood Gate, Xie Wu Wei was overseeing his group of subordinates, blocking any Ancient Lands inhabitants who were trying to enter the Blood Gate from approaching. However, from time to time, he would look in a certain direction.

That was the place where the Divine Venerables were gathered.

He was sitting on an armchair, sneering from time to time.

The Four Divine Venerables were gathered near the Blood Gate, and he knew why. These four were obviously worried that the Monster Kings under them could not resist the temptation of the bloodline attraction.

In fact, they weren’t overreacting. If the four of them weren’t nearby, perhaps Xie Wu Wei would have already tried to break the Blood Gate seal.

He had already reached the limit of his cultivation and there was no room for growth left. This was undoubtedly painful torture for members of the Monster Race, who always yearned for strength.

The strange changes of the Blood Gate had given him hope. He could clearly perceive a mysterious and powerful force from the Blood Gate, resonating with his bloodline. It was definitely the power that could make him be reborn, stimulate his ancestral bloodline, and transform him into a Divine Spirit.

Once he got his hands on this power, he could become an existence that could stand on equal footing with the four Divine Venerables and he would no longer need to follow someone else’s orders.

Unfortunately… He didn’t have this opportunity! He couldn’t even get close to the Blood Gate. Under the surveillance of those four, he believed that he would be reduced to nothing before he could even approach.

With a heavy sigh, Xie Wu Wei slapped the armrest of the chair, shattering it into pieces. He was extremely unwilling to accept the current state of things. If he really missed such a good opportunity, it would be utterly depressing!

At that moment, he suddenly seemed to sense something and turned his head to stare in another direction, his heart clenching tightly.

He furrowed his brow for a while before slowly standing up.

The Monster Race Master called Shu Yu, who was by his side, couldn’t help but ask, seeing this, “Sir, where are you going?”

“I’m feeling bored, I’m going for a walk. You continue to monitor the things here. If anyone tries to break through, kill without mercy!” Xie Wu Wei, carrying his hands behind his back, stoically ordered.

“Yes Sir!” Shu Yu respectfully cupped his fists and responded, sending off Xie Wu Wei with his eyes.

After Xie Wu Wei’s figure left his subordinate’s sight, his figure flickered before he disappeared into the jungle.

After a moment, his figure reappeared on top of a huge tree. He looked left and right for a while with a suspicious expression on his face.

Just when he was feeling at a loss, a figure suddenly appeared beside him; seemingly out of thin air.

Xie Wu Wei was taken aback and his Monster Qi surged; he immediately wanted to attack.

“It’s me!” A familiar voice reached his ear before he could move though, forcing Xie Wu Wei to suppress his strength.

“Young Master Yang!” Xie Wu Wei looked over with surprise, “Where did you come from?”

To his great shock, he was unable to sense Yang Kai’s arrival with his peak Twelfth-Order strength. It was really incredible.

Yang Kai smiled lightly but didn’t answer his question; rather, he asked him for his help, “Monster King, can you do me a favour?”

Xie Wu Wei immediately looked at him with vigilance and anxiously asked, “What’s the matter?”

Yang Kai beckoned to him. Xie Wu Wei looked annoyed, but had no choice but to get closer.

Yang Kai whispered a few words into his ear.

Xie Wu Wei’s face immediately changed as he asked in amazement, “You are asking me to inform the Divine Venerables of this? Why not ask me to court death directly!?”

Although he was Yang Kai’s Soul Slave, how could Xie Wu Wei be willing to play cat and mouse with death, so of course he was infuriated.

Yang Kai asked in surprise, “Why would you be courting your death?”

Xie Wu Wei replied with a cold snort, “They will immediately realize that it’s a lie as soon as they hear it. The Divine Venerables aren’t idiots, how will they not investigate? And once they have investigated, they won’t let this King live!”

While speaking, he kept shaking his head, “No, this King won’t go. Even if you beat me to death, I won’t go! It’s better to die at your hands than to die in the hands of four furious Divine Venerables. Just kill me right now!”

Yang Kai couldn’t stop himself from laughing before saying, “Who told you that it’s false?”

Xie Wu Wei took a sidelong glance at him before deriding, pursing his lips, “Don’t lie to this King. Every single creature of the Ancient Lands knows that the ancient bell has already been taken by a Human Master tens of thousands of years ago. How could it appear in the Ancient Lands for no reason?”

Yang Kai earnestly guaranteed, “It’s true! I’m not lying!”

Xie Wu Wei looked shocked and stated in surprise, “This King is a member of Monster Race, this King isn’t as scheming as you Humans. Don’t lie to me.”

Yang Kai pursed his lips into a smile and ensured, patting the Monster King’s shoulder, “Why would I lie to you? I only want you to disclose this news to the Divine Venerables. I guarantee nothing will happen to you.”
