The Space Ring was filled with countless Black Ink Clan corpses.

Although they were dead, the auras exuding from some of them suggested that there were even Feudal Lords among the piles.

A shocked Yang Kai asked, “Has the Black Ink Clan launched another invasion?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Zhong Liang shook his head, “No.”

“So… why are there so many corpses here?” If they hadn’t been attacked by the Black Ink Clan, why were there so many corpses in this Space Ring?

Zhong Liang glared at Ding Yao, who said impassively, “This King personally went to the Black Ink Clan’s domain and destroyed some of their territories.”

Despite his dispassionate tone, Yang Kai could imagine how much danger the older man must have gone through. Even though Ding Yao was an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, it was still extremely risky for him to barge into the Black Ink Clan hinterland on his own. The injuries on his figure were the best proof.

“I almost killed a Territory Lord, but that guy ran away too quickly,” Ding Yao sounded regretful. Given his strength, it wasn’t hard for him to defeat a Territory Lord, but it wasn’t easy for him to kill one.

That was the reason Yang Kai and Bai Yi gained a lot of Military Merits after they joined forces to kill Zhu Feng.

To the Humans and the Black Ink Clansmen, Eighth-Order Masters and Territory Lords were indispensable assets. Any loss of such figures would be unbearably painful.

Yang Kai was dumbfounded. After hearing what Ding Yao had said, he figured out what a crazy thing this man must have done. Apparently, Ding Yao headed to the Black Ink Clan’s territory and made a scene after acquiring the World Spring.

Perhaps he had always wanted to do that in the past; however, despite being an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he would have to consume a lot of energy in prolonged resistance against Black Ink Strength. Now that he had the World Spring though, he didn’t have to worry about Black Ink Strength harming him. That was why he could barge into the Black Ink Clan’s territory on his own and give them an unpleasant surprise.

The World Spring wouldn’t increase an Open Heaven Realm Master’s strength, but it could offer incredible assistance to a powerful Master like Ding Yao on the Black Ink Battlefield. It could be said that the World Spring was more useful in Ding Yao’s possession than in Yang Kai’s.

It was for this reason that the Four Universe Pillars were usually given to Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters.

“You can bring this ring to the Merit Hall. It should get you a lot of Military Merits,” Ding Yao said impassively.

Yang Kai turned to Zhong Liang, “Is it… alright to do so?”

After all, he wasn’t the one who killed those enemies. These corpses were given to him by Ding Yao. If he really brought the ring to the Merit Hall, it would be akin to taking Military Merits that supposedly belonged to Ding Yao. That was why he felt uneasy about it.

Zhong Liang chuckled upon hearing that, “It’s definitely alright to do so. Just take it. Your Martial Uncle Ding doesn’t like to owe anyone a favour.”

“But… there are too many corpses here.” Yang Kai felt that the ring in his hand was quite heavy. He didn’t count those corpses, but he reckoned that there were several tens of thousands of them in total. Even though most of them were Low-Rank and High-Rank Black Ink Clansmen, there were also quite a number of Feudal Lords. He could get a staggering number of Military Merits by bringing this ring to the Merit Hall.

Ding Yao coughed, “If you feel like you have to give me something in return, I do have a request.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Please ask, Sir.”

Ding Yao went on to say, “If it’s alright for you, I’d like to get some Humans from your Small Universe.”

After a cultivator ascended to the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm, his Small Universe would materialise, thus giving him the ability to raise living beings inside his body. Doing this would allow the living creatures to help increase the heritage in their Small Universe as time passed. It would help the cultivator shorten cultivation time and grow faster.

Ding Yao already had this ability thousands of years ago; however, the situation on the Black Ink Battlefield was perilous, and every time the Black Ink Clan’s Army invaded, he had to personally fight against powerful enemies, which sometimes resulted in his Small Universe being shaken. If there were living creatures in his Small Universe when that happened, many would be killed.

Nevertheless, things were different now. With the World Spring’s presence, his Small Universe was firm and impenetrable. Even if he had to deal with formidable enemies, his Small Universe would be safe and sound.

Ding Yao was still quite some distance away from the Ninth Order, so it was expected that he wanted to raise some living beings in his Small Universe to shorten the time until his next breakthrough.

In the entire Blue Sky Pass, only Yang Kai had living creatures in his Small Universe, so he was the only one who could help Ding Yao.

Yang Kai instantly realised Ding Yao’s intentions when he heard that, “Do you want to raise living creatures in your Small Universe, Sir?”

“Yes,” Ding Yao nodded.

Yang Kai went on to say, “Since you have the World Spring to protect your Small Universe now, you’re indeed able to start raising living creatures safely. However, rather than Humans, I can offer you a better option.”

“A better option?” Ding Yao arched his brow. Zhong Liang also gazed at him with surprise.

After giving it a thought, Yang Kai waved his hand and the portal to his Small Universe opened up. A moment later, a knee-high stony living creature appeared before him.

Presently, the creature appeared puzzled as he had no idea why he’d appeared in this place; however, it was apparent that he was a simple-minded creature with low sentience. He soon ignored the people around him and started strolling around.

“What’s this?” Ding Yao examined him with a frown.

Zhong Liang was also looking at the stone creature with curiosity.

Neither of them had seen such a special creature before, so their interest had been piqued.

“I call them the Small Stone Race. They were discovered in a New Great Territory.”

“A New Great Territory?” Ding Yao was astounded.

Yang Kai nodded, then explained to him the Small Stone Race’s background. Ding Yao and the others were amazed as they had never expected that a New Great Territory had been found in the 3,000 Worlds.

“Compared to Humans, raising these Small Stone Race members can give us more benefits. Assuming that there are equal numbers of Humans and Small Stone Race members, the latter can help increase the heritage of our Small Universe roughly 10 times quicker.”

“10 times quicker?” Zhong Liang exclaimed as a myriad of expressions came over him, “Are you serious?”

“Yes,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Why is that?” Zhong Liang was puzzled.

Yang Kai shook his head, “I have no idea either. Although they’ve been living inside my Small Universe for many years now, I still don’t know the reason behind it. I can only say that these special living creatures are beneficial to the Small Universes of cultivators like us; therefore, if you want to raise living creatures in your Small Universe, I’d recommend these Small Stone Race members. As for Humans, I have the World Tree’s clone in my Small Universe now, and with its nourishment, many geniuses will appear after three to five generations.”

Ding Yao’s eyes brightened, “It’s best to have these Small Stone Race members then. However, how many of them can you give me?”

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “You can have as many as you want. In fact, it’s not hard to raise these little guys. They multiply quickly, sharing similar characteristics to ants. As long as there’s a queen ant and enough food, you don’t have to worry about increasing their number. With that said, it takes quite a lot of materials to raise them. It might not have been possible in Blue Sky Pass in the past, but it shouldn’t be an issue now. I suppose those First, Second, and Third-Order materials are basically useless. Small Stone Race members are not picky when it comes to what you feed them.”

Ding Yao exchanged glances with Zhong Liang, then turned to Yang Kai and nodded, “I’ll listen to you, then.”

Certainly, Yang Kai didn’t have any objections. He then started taking some Small Stone Race members out of his Small Universe.

It took him several days to finally fish out a little more than half of the Small Stone Race members from his Small Universe. It was then that Ding Yao was satisfied.

With these Small Stone Race members as a foundation, they would certainly multiply quickly in his Small Universe as long as there were sufficient materials. As time passed, it would save him a lot of cultivation time and help him ascend to the Ninth Order earlier.

Ding Yao soon left. Even though he had killed a lot of Black Ink Clansmen and returned alive, he was injured after all. Moreover, with so many Small Stone Race members in his Small Universe now, he had to spend some time studying them, so he didn’t remain for long.

On the other hand, Zhong Liang wasn’t in a rush to leave. He gazed at Yang Kai and asked caringly, “Are you sure you can resist Black Ink Strength without the World Spring?”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai chuckled, “Have you forgotten about it, Sir? I still have a lot of Black Ink Strength suppressed in my Small Universe. I would have fallen into danger instead of still looking safe and sound if I were unable to resist the Black Ink Strength.”

Zhong Liang was startled as he soon recalled it. Finding it regretful, he couldn’t help but let out a sigh.

In fact, he hoped that the World Tree’s clone wouldn’t have the same effects as the World Spring so that Yang Kai would have to stay in Blue Sky Pass instead of running around everywhere; however, he knew that his wishes wouldn’t always be granted. It had come to a point where there was nothing he could do to change the situation.

“By the way, I should give this back to you.” As Yang Kai spoke, he fished out a box and passed it to Zhong Liang.

A doubtful Zhong Liang took the box, and upon opening it, he asked in shock, “You didn’t consume it?”

The thing inside the box was the Profound Yin Spirit Fruit he had given to Yang Kai some time ago.

Yang Kai nodded, “The World Tree clone is able to repair damage to my Small Universe, so I don’t need to consume this fruit. My Small Universe has almost fully healed now. This fruit is rare in the Inner Sanctum, so it should be given to another fellow Brother or Sister who needs it.”

Zhong Liang was astounded as he muttered, “I didn’t expect the clone to have this effect.”

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “I just found out about it not long ago.”

Certainly, Yang Kai wouldn’t joke around about such an issue. Zhong Liang couldn’t help but think that the World Tree was truly amazing. Just a clone could bring so many benefits with it. What surprises would there be if someone could refine the Mother Tree itself?

With that said, he knew that it couldn’t possibly happen; after all, the Mother Tree was hiding in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, where not just anyone could enter. This Sealed World had always been elusive, and no one knew where or when it would appear. Entering was basically a matter of luck.

Eventually, Zhong Liang left with the Profound Yin Spirit Fruit. Yang Kai passed the ring that was full of Black Ink Clan corpses to Feng Ying and told her to bring it to the Merit Hall to exchange for Military Merits. He didn’t intend to keep the Military Merits to himself; instead, he decided to keep it in Dawn Squad’s account. After all, it required some Military Merits every time Dawning Light was repaired, so he had to be prepared for future emergencies.

After Feng Ying left, Yang Kai started cultivating in seclusion again, for his Small Universe hadn’t fully healed yet. However, with the World Tree clone’s presence, repairing his Small Universe wasn’t really an issue.

Another half a year passed before Yang Kai finally felt his Small Universe was complete once more.
