In less time than it would take to brew a half cup of tea, the surrounding region for several thousand kilometres was covered by this extremely rich Spirit Qi Sea, engulfing many cultivators in it, blocking their vision. Even Maplewood City, which was two thousand kilometres away, benefited greatly. Countless cultivators rushed to the city walls and looked up full of excitement, opening their arms to welcome the raining World Energy.

(Silavin, Spirit Qi Sea is basically greatly condensed World Energy. The term is interchangeable.)

*Hong Hong Hong... *

The sound of the invisible shackles being opened came from every corner of Maplewood City, transmitted from the bodies of many cultivators, causing them to tremble and have weird expressions.

“I... I made a breakthrough to the Second-Order Origin King Realm!”

“Wo... I can die in peace now that I have broken the shackles of the Origin Returning Realm!”

“Hahahaha, this Young Master is truly talented, an undefeatable genius, instantly breaking through three Minor Realms straight to the Immortal Ascension Realm! This Young Master is truly invincible!”

The joyful cries of the cultivators filled the air as more and more of them broke through, reaching higher in the Martial Dao with the assistance of the dense Spirit Qi Sea.

Nothing much occurred when breaking through a Minor Realm within a Great Realm, but breaking through to a new Great Realm would always usher in a World Energy Baptism.

As a result, the sky covering Maplewood City soon grew dark, engulfing the entire city in black clouds as if the end was near. Soon after, winds began to gather and bolts of World Energy began pouring down from above, striking the bodies of those who had just advanced to the next Great Realm, washing their bodies and Souls.

Maplewood City instantly boiled up.

However, Yang Kai and the others, who were standing just above the ancient seal outside of the city, benefited even more.

Each and every Dao Source Realm Master stood frozen with their eyes closed, feeling the richness of World Energy around them, opening all their pores in order to absorb this energy even without consciously circulating their Secret Art. The ubiquitous World Energy continuously poured into their limbs even when they just stood still, making them feel completely relaxed and at ease.

A creaking sound came from inside Yang Kai’s body, which made his expression strange and immediately excited.

“Brother Yang...” Qin Zhao Yang suddenly shouted with difficulty.

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai turned his head and looked at Qin Zhao Yang.

“This Old Master can’t withstand it anymore...” Qin Zhao Yang looked like he was in pain as if he had constipation and suddenly glanced at Yang Kai, “I need to look for a place... to quietly break through!”

Yang Kai raised his brows immediately and said with great joy, “Congratulations, Patriarch Qin.”

Qin Zhao Yang had shown no signs of breaking through for hundreds of years due to his advanced age, but when he was suddenly enveloped by this dense World Energy, it seemed his opportunity had come.

Without this opportunity, given Qin Zhao Yang’s innate aptitude and age, he would never be able to reach the threshold of the Second-Order Dao Source Realm until the day he died. If he was able to break through at this time though, it would be a great blessing to the Qin Family, and even to Maplewood City.

Qin Zhao Yang smiled bitterly, “The timing couldn’t be worse though. The situation here is turbulent at the moment, so this Old Master will have to ask Brother Yang to stand guard for him for a time!”

“No problem!” Yang Kai agreed readily before he began looking around. There were many cultivators present, all of whom showed excited looks as the Source Qi in their bodies became turbulent. Many seemed to similarly be on the verge of breaking through.

“Let’s head to the source!” Yang Kai grabbed Qin Zhao Yang and rushed forward.

There were too many people around at this moment, all of whom were Dao Source Realm, and the impact that occurred during a breakthrough would be very chaotic, so it was not suitable to remain here. Since Qin Zhao Yang showed signs of a breakthrough, it could not be wasted.

Therefore, Yang Kai decided to go deep into the tiger’s den.

“The source!” Qin Zhao Yang narrowed his eyes but quickly understood what Yang Kai was referring to.

Soon, the pair dove into a massive hole in the ground and rushed downwards against the constant upsurge of World Energy.

Yang Kai’s approach was indeed correct. The deeper they dove, the more terrifying the purity and richness of the World Energy. The World Energy that appeared above ground was amazing enough, but the World Energy below the surface was on a completely different scale.

With the help of such a vast sea of World Energy, Qin Zhao Yang felt that it was simply impossible for him to fail to break through this time. He could not help but feel excited as his face glowed, making him appear several dozen years younger.

The two of them fell all the way down for more than a thousand metres before reaching solid ground.

The underground situation was the same as above, a literal lake.

However, the water here was not ordinary water, but rather Liquid Spirit Qi.

Yang Kai did not intend to linger here and simply looked for a direction before he continued to rush forward.

After a long time, he suddenly stopped, looked left and right, and said, “Patriarch Qin, you can break through here. No one should come here in a short time.”

At this moment, everyone was busy absorbing World Energy to prepare for their own breakthrough, so how could they have the mind to explore this underground cave system? So, what Yang Kai said made sense.

Qin Zhao Yang was afraid that he could not suppress himself anymore so he simply nodded and sat down cross-legged without another word. Circulating his Secret Art, he instantly entered a meditative state.

Yang Kai waved his hand and summoned three beautiful figures before himself.

“Sir... what is this place?” Zhang Ruo Xi asked, noticing the strangeness around her instantly and couldn’t help covering her lips in shock.

Hua Qing Si’s beautiful eyes also widened as she trembled, “Yang... Yang Kai, don’t tell me you broke into some great Sect’s cultivation paradise without authorization?”

Liu Yan’s dazzling eyes looked around while the corners of her mouth rose slightly to reveal a smile, but she did not comment out loud.

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Of course not.”

“The World Energy here...” Hua Qing Si was shocked.

“How is it compared to the cultivation paradises of Star Soul Palace?” Yang Kai asked with interest.

“Not far off!” Hua Qing Si pondered for a while before groaning, “The cultivation paradise of ​​Soul Palace is divided into three levels, Heaven, Earth, and Mortal. Those with my cultivation are only permitted to enter the Earth Grade cultivation paradises, and in order to do so, we need to offer a massive number of contribution points to the Sect. The World Energy here is even denser than in those Earth Grade cultivation rooms!”

“What about Heaven Grade?” Yang Kai frowned.

“I don’t know!” Hua Qing Si shook her head, and said bitterly, “Only Emperor Realm Masters are allowed to cultivate under such conditions, I am not qualified to enter.”

Yang Kai gently nodded.

“Where is this place? Why is there such rich World Energy here?” Hua Qing Si asked again.

“It’s the land around the ancient seal we visited last time. I don’t know what this place’s name is, or what lies below, but apparently, a number of Earth Veins and a Source Crystal lode suddenly appeared here...”

Hua Qing Si was stunned when she heard this.

She had lost her freedom here in this place after Yang Kai captured her and threw her into his Sealed World Bead, eventually forcing her to surrender her Soul Brand.

However, because of that, she obtained an Extraordinary Treasure Pill, which greatly increased her chances of breaking through to the Emperor Realm.

It was hard to say if she had gained or lost from this event. In any case, Hua Qing Si was not upset with her current situation and she had grown a much friendlier opinion of Yang Kai.

“Enough nonsense, it would be a shame to let this opportunity slip by. Quickly meditate and cultivate, absorb as much World Energy as you can.”

Hua Qing Si and Zhang Ruo Xi nodded one after another at his words and quickly found a place to sit cross-legged and circulate their Secret Arts.

Hua Qing Si was a disciple of Star Soul Palace and had a powerful Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation, so although she failed miserably in her previous mission and wound up captured by Yang Kai, she was not someone to be underestimated. In a short time, her tender body became a bottomless pit that gathered a steady stream of World Energy towards it.

Yang Kai looked at her in amazement, secretly admiring the Secret Arts of Star Soul Palace.

Immediately afterwards, something that startled him even more happened.

A whistling noise emerged from Zhang Ruo Xi’s body, one that was created by a strong stream of wind. Instantly, Zhang Ruo Xi’s petite form also became a bottomless pit that rapidly absorbed the surrounding World Energy. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Zhang Ruo Xi’s cultivation aura soared upwards at a speed visible to the naked eye.

*Ka... *

An abnormal noise soon sounded and with Zhang Ruo Xi’s tender body as the centre, an invisible wave of pressure pulsed outwards.

“This...” Yang Kai ogled.

Ever since her bloodline power began to awaken, Zhang Ruo Xi’s cultivation speed had increased expeditiously, and the richer the World Energy was, the more obvious the effects of her cultivation were. She had no bottlenecks at all; as long as the accumulation of energy was sufficient, she could automatically break through. Even her Shi had easily reached the Grand Accomplishment Stage without any stagnation at all.

The scene before him was Zhang Ruo Xi easily breaking through to the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm!

Yang Kai was unsure of the condition of this young girl and her mysterious bloodline, but it was undeniable that this underground location was the most suitable place for Zhang Ruo Xi’s cultivation.

Thoughts floated through Yang Kai’s mind helplessly. [What would it be like if Zhang Ruo Xi were to cultivate in the Heaven Grade cultivation paradise of Star Soul Palace for several years?]

[Could she directly reach the Emperor Realm?]

“Master, you seem to be about to break through too!” Liu Yan looked at Yang Kai brightly with her beautiful eyes.

Her cultivation was much stronger now and was able to naturally detect the vibrations coming from Yang Kai’s body.

Yang Kai nodded and responded, “You will need to stand guard at this place.”

Saying so, Yang Kai reached out his hand and summoned the Sealed World Bead. After he performed a series of hand seals, the Sealed World Bead began emitting a huge suction force that drew in the surrounding World Energy. The Liquid Spirit Qi nearby surged as streams of water seemed to flow towards the small bead.

Tossing the Sealed World Bead to Liu Yan, Yang Kai said, “Find a place to hide, there are quite a lot of people here.”

Liu Yan nodded, holding the Sealed World Bead as her tender body disappeared in a flash, hiding somewhere.

However, before she left, Yang Kai saw a hint of envy in her eyes.

This couldn’t be helped though; everyone was benefiting from such a wondrous opportunity, but Liu Yan could not, naturally making her feel a bit distraught.
