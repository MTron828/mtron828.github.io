Looking up, Yang Kai saw that there was a place that looked like a camp in front of him where several dozen Black Ink Clansmen were looking in their direction. The one standing at the front had two horns on his forehead and his burly figure made him look like some kind of two-legged Ox Demon.

Those several dozen auras apparently came from this group. Surprisingly, they were mostly Feudal Lords while the Black Ink Clansman who looked like an Ox Demon was a Territory Lord.

There were many powerful Black Ink Clansmen guarding the portal of this Sealed World, and their leader was a Territory Lord. It went to show how important the Black Ink Clan considered this place.

The Feudal Lord, who led Yang Kai to this place, gazed at the Territory Lord and cupped his fist, “Sir Mei Qiong.”

The Territory Lord named Mei Qiong nodded lightly. Just by taking a glance at Yang Kai, he figured out the latter’s identity, “Found a new Artifact Refiner?”

The Feudal Lord replied, “It was Sir Hei Yuan who found him.”

“Hei Yuan…” Mei Qiong snorted. Perhaps he had some grudges against Hei Yuan. Yang Kai could see a hint of disdain flashing through his face at the mention of Hei Yuan, “What’s his rank?”

The Feudal Lord replied, “According to Sir Hei Yuan, he’s a Great Master Artifact Refiner.”

“A Great Master? Hei Yuan is pretty lucky!” Mei Qiong was surprised; after all, since this plan had been started years ago, all the Black Ink Disciples who knew even a thing or two about Artifact Refining had been gathered here. It was hard to find a Great Master Artifact Refiner in the outside world.

Even in this place, there were only a small number of Great Masters.

“I’ll leave him to you, Sir Mei Qiong. I still have to go back and report the matter to the Royal Lord.”

Mei Qiong nodded, “Good. Just leave him here. You can go back now.”

The Feudal Lord went on to say, “The Royal Lord wants me to tell you and Sir Qing Lei to work harder and complete this task as soon as possible.”

In an instant, Mei Qiong appeared annoyed, “It’s not like Qing Lei and I can accelerate the process in any way. The Human Artifact Refiners are the ones developing it.”

The Feudal Lord asked impassively, “Do you want me to pass on your words to the Royal Lord, Sir?”

Mei Qiong felt his brow twitching. Feeling vexed, he uttered, “Qing Lei and I will work harder to supervise them. Tell the Royal Lord to rest assured.”

It was only then that the Feudal Lord bowed his head and flew towards the portal.

After the portal closed, Mei Qiong turned to look at Yang Kai and sneered, “You’re pretty bold. I hope your skills in Artifact Refining are just as great as your audacity.”

Yang Kai put on a fawning smile as he wouldn’t dare to say anything in front of this overbearing man.

Mei Qiong beckoned to a subordinate and ordered, “Bring him to see Qing Lei.”

“Yes,” Upon receiving the order, the Feudal Lord directly pushed his Black Ink Strength and engulfed Yang Kai with it before flying further into the Sealed World.

Just a moment later, they arrived at a huge valley where there was a Grand Hall in the middle of the mountain wall. There were a lot of Black Ink Clansmen moving around the Grand Hall. The Feudal Lord turned his head and ordered, “Come with me.”

He then shuffled into the Grand Hall; naturally, no one stopped him.

Yang Kai followed him closely.

Soon, they moved across the Grand Hall and arrived at an open-air platform on the other end. There was a well-built figure standing on the platform. Looking down from this position, one could watch over the entire valley.

The Feudal Lord, who led Yang Kai to this place, saluted the well-built figure, “Sir Qing Lei.”

Without turning his head, Qing Lei asked in a deep voice, “The portal of the Sealed World was opened just now?”

Although he was responsible for guarding this place, he was a Territory Lord after all. He certainly could detect that the portal was opened earlier.

The Feudal Lord replied respectfully, “An Artifact Refiner has been sent over from the Royal City.”

Qing Lei turned around and examined Yang Kai before nodding, “What’s his rank?”

“It’s said that he’s a Great Master Artifact Refiner.”

Qing Lei said impassively, “Not bad. Leave him to me.”

“Yes,” the Feudal Lord replied, then left the place respectfully.

Yang Kai stood there silently and waited for Qing Lei to speak to him; however, Qing Lei didn’t seem to have the intention of saying anything to Yang Kai as he remained unmoving.

Yang Kai had no idea what the other man was waiting for. Despite that, he had figured out some important information not long after he arrived in this Sealed World.

There was no doubt that Mu Guang Royal Lord treasured this Sealed World highly. Not only did it require a special token to open the portal, but there were also two Territory Lords guarding this place. One of them was Mei Qiong, who was responsible for guarding the portal, and the other was Qing Lei.

Yang Kai had no idea how many Feudal Lords there were in this place, but he was certain there were a lot of them.

The number of powerful Black Ink Clansmen here showed how cautious Mu Guang was. Although Yang Kai always knew this would be a difficult task, he still felt frustrated at this moment.

He could ignore the Feudal Lords, but it wasn’t easy to do anything without alerting the Territory Lords.

As Yang Kai followed Qing Lei’s gaze, he saw a huge Warship hovering in the middle of the mountain valley.

The size of this Warship was similar to the one he saw in Blue Sky Pass in the past. It was much larger than a typical Warship owned by a Human Squad, similar to the size of a Warship used by a Battalion. The appearance of the Warship was imposing.

Since Yang Kai was unable to get closer, he couldn’t ascertain the capabilities of this Warship; however, it had been 20 years since those from Yin-Yang Pass discovered the first prototype Black Ink Clan Warship, so the newer one must have been improved at least a little.

At this moment, there were a lot of Human Artifact Refiners that had gathered together in this mountain valley. Nevertheless, not every Artifact Refiner had the right to refine this kind of Warship. Most of the Artifact Refiners could be ignored. The most pressing issue for Yang Kai was to find out who was the Artifact Refiner that was in charge of developing the Warship. Only by doing so could he come up with a solution.

All of a sudden, a figure shot into the sky, which caught Yang Kai’s attention.

As he looked intently, he realised that the person was a Human, not a Black Ink Clansman.

The person was an elderly man who was in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm; however, he appeared exhausted, as though he hadn’t taken a break from work for a long time.

The elderly man walked up to Qing Lei and saluted him, “What’s wrong, Sir Qing Lei?”

Qing Lei shot him a dispassionate glance, “Here’s a new Artifact Refiner. Help him settle in.”

It was then that the elderly man noticed Yang Kai, who was behind Qing Lei. Elated, and replied, “Understood!”

Upon finishing his words, he beckoned to Yang Kai, “Come with me.”

Yang Kai nodded and flew towards the mountain valley alongside the elderly man.

Before they landed, the elderly man turned to look at Yang Kai and asked, “What’s your name?”

Yang Kai cupped his fist, “Yang Kai.”

The elderly man nodded, “So it is Little Brother Yang. You’re already so strong at such a young age. You do have a promising future. By the way, I’m Wu Xing He.”

[Wu Xing He!]

Yang Kai turned serious the moment he heard this name.

Before he left Yin-Yang Pass, Tang Qiu had given him a list of a dozen people who had gone missing on the battlefield. Those from Yin-Yang Pass speculated that they had been corrupted by the Black Ink Clan and turned into Black Ink Disciples. These dozen people had studied Artifact Refining before and shown some talent for it. Of course, when they went missing, they could only be considered novices in Artifact Refining.

However, if they fell into the hands of the Black Ink Clan and started focusing on studying the Dao of Artifact Refining, they would have a chance to grow. Those from Yin-Yang Pass speculated that the person in charge of developing the Warship was one of those people.

Tang Qiu told Yang Kai to pay more attention to the information regarding the people on the list when the latter arrived in the Black Ink Clan’s domain.

Yang Kai had never expected that not long after he entered this Sealed World, he would meet one of the people on the list.

Could this person be the one who was in charge of developing the Warship? Yang Kai was uncertain about it. From the looks of it, even if Wu Xing He wasn’t the most important figure in this project, he wouldn’t be insignificant; otherwise, Qing Lei wouldn’t have told him to help Yang Kai settle in.

Suppressing the emotions in his heart, Yang Kai cupped his fist, “So, it is Senior Wu.”

Wu Xing He glanced at him and chuckled, “We’re both in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, so you don’t have to call me a Senior. Moreover, we’re in the Black Ink Clan now, so we don’t have to comply with the etiquette of the Humans.”

Yang Kai was already used to Human etiquette, and although he was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he could only be considered a rising Star compared to the other much older veteran Seventh-Order Masters.

Upon hearing Wu Xing He’s words though, Yang Kai stopped being overly polite and addressed the older man in a different way, saying, “Senior Brother Wu.”

Wu Xing He replied with a smile, “What’s your rank in Artifact Refining?”

Yang Kai replied honestly, “Great Master.”

“What field are you particularly well-versed in?”

“Personally, I’m good at refining offensive and defensive artifacts. I can build flight-type artifacts as well, but that will take a longer time.”

Upon hearing that, Wu Xing He nodded, “In that case, you shall work with me. I happen to need more people on my side.”

“I shall trouble you from now on then, Senior Brother Wu.”

By the time they finished speaking, they arrived at the bottom of the mountain valley. Yang Kai looked down and saw many Artifact Refiners working on the Warship. There were also some Feudal Lords walking around that seemed to be supervising them.

Wu Xing He directly led Yang Kai to the edge of the mountain valley where there were a lot of houses. Wu Xing He pointed at those houses and said, “This is where we can get some rest and cultivate. The three houses on the left are empty, so you can choose one of them. Although Black Ink Disciples are considered lowly in the Black Ink Clan, Artifact Refiners like us are treated fairly well. If you need resources to cultivate, you can go over there and get some.”

Then, he pointed at the hall on the side, “Not only are there materials of different Orders, but there are also a lot of Spirit Pills. They’re for us to use.”

Yang Kai was astounded, “It seems that everything is provided for us.”

Wu Xing He replied with a smile, “They’ve prepared everything for us so that we can work harder. It requires a lot of energy to refine artifacts. If we can restore ourselves quickly, we can put more effort into making artifacts. The Black Ink Clan is aware of that.”

Yang Kai nodded to show that he understood what the other man was saying.

“The Black Ink Clan has a lot of resources that are hard to come by on the Humans’ side. In this place, you can get a set of Seventh-Order materials from the Black Ink Clan to cultivate with ease. Of course, you can only get one set at a time, and you can only get another set after refining the ones you have.”
