Gu Zhi Xin was in the Third-Order Open Heaven Realm. On the other hand, the others were all in the Second-Order Open Heaven Realm. The destructive power they could exert when working together could not be considered weak. Just what kind of existence could slaughter them all in an instant? A Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master would not be able to pull off something like that. The only ones who could do this were in the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm or a Master above the Fifth-Order!

“Could it be that Zhao Bai Chuan made a move personally!?” The burly man surnamed Guan had an extremely solemn expression on his face.

It was only natural that he made such an assumption. Guo Zi Yan was a part of Scarlet Star while Zhao Bai Chuan was the Head Manager of Scarlet Star. It would make sense if Zhao Bai Chuan helped Guo Zi Yan.

Yun Xing Hua stood up slowly, “It doesn’t matter who slaughtered Elder Gu and the others. Everyone, Blood Swan Continent will soon face a huge catastrophe. The slightest carelessness will lead to a disastrous situation. I hope that all of you will stand with this King to face this possible crisis together.”

Somebody stepped forward, “Sect Master, are you saying that the person who killed Elder Gu and the others will come to cause trouble for Blood Swan Continent?”

Yun Xing Hua nodded, “I cannot rule out this possibility.”

That person followed up, “Even if it was Zhao Bai Chuan who attacked us, he is only in the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm. It is true that there is nobody in Blood Swan Continent who could be his opponent, but if he wanted to attack this place… It won’t be so easy.”

Yun Xing Hua replied, “If it were only Zhao Bai Chuan alone, then there is nothing for Blood Swan Continent to fear. We can rely on the Defensive Grand Array to protect ourselves. What can he do to Blood Swan Continent even if he is in the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm? But if you believe that is all we have to worry about, then you underestimate the situation in Scarlet Star. They have several Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters and dozens in the Low-Rank. I don’t know where they have been hiding for the past decade, but their strength is no trivial matter now that they have returned.”

The weak-looking scholar from before said, “If that’s the case, Blood Swan Continent will not be able to fight back against them. Sect Master, I suggest we ask Shocking Swan Pavilion for help! Shocking Swan Territory is Shocking Swan Pavilion’s territory and Blood Swan Continent is affiliated with them. It is not Scarlet Star’s place to run wild!”

Yun Xing Hua revealed a complicated look in his eyes as he slowly shook his head, “I’m afraid it’s too late. If anyone really wants to cause trouble for Blood Swan Continent, they will appear in at most a day or two. Even if we ask Shocking Swan Pavilion for help, they won’t be able to make it in time. Besides, Shocking Swan Pavilion… might not be willing to lend us a hand.”

Upon hearing that, everybody’s expression became gloomy.

Yun Xing Hua had been suppressed by Shocking Swan Pavilion in the past. He was forced to advance to the Third-Order Open Heaven Realm when he could have broken through to the Fourth-Order. Now that he worked hard to cultivate for tens of years and finally regained the strength of a Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, Shocking Swan Pavilion would not be pleased with this turn of events. If they really asked Shocking Swan Pavilion for help, they did not know what kind of price they would need to pay. Shocking Swan Pavilion might even take the chance to put forward some harsh conditions to suppress them further.

“Don’t mention asking for help again. I hope all of you will remain vigilant during this period. If there are any strange movements from the outside, report them immediately!”

“Yes!” Everybody responded loudly before scattering in all directions.

Once everybody had left, Yun Xing Hua finally gashed his teeth and viciously slammed his fist against the armrest of his chair, gritting his teeth as he cursed, “Gu Zhi Xin, you incompetent bastard!”

Yun Xing Hua had been suppressed and forced to advance into the Third-Order Open Heaven Realm, and now that he obtained the strength of a Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he finally saw hopes towards the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm. With his aptitude, it would not be difficult for him to advance into the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm within 200 years if he had enough resources.

That would also be around the time the Old Pavilion Master of Shocking Swan Pavilion died. Aside from the old ghost of Shocking Swan Pavilion, Yun Xing Hua thought little of the others. When he obtained the strength of a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, there would be nobody else in the entire Shocking Swan Territory who could be his opponent. Dominating the entire Shocking Swan Territory and using Shocking Swan Territory to lord over Shocking Swan Pavilion would not be a difficult task. Only then could he take revenge for his grudge of being suppressed back then!

His beautiful dream had only just begun, and yet, he was faced with such a turn of events. That unknown powerful enemy could slaughter four Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters in an instant. Yun Xing Hua had to admit that he was not this enemy’s opponent. Even if they relied on Blood Swan Continent’s Grand Array, they might not be able to stop the enemy. He couldn’t help feeling a little lost as to what he should do in the future!

Despite pondering gloomily for a while, Yun Xing Hua came up with no countermeasure whatsoever. He could only hope that the enemy was not that powerful and would retreat in the face of difficulties.

Unfortunately, his hopes were crushed to pieces in just one day.

Following a loud sound, the entire Blood Swan Continent seemed to shake as a violent force impacted it. Blood Swan Continent was struck by a disaster. The slightly weaker disciples began bleeding from their seven orifices from the impact of the shock and chaos soon spread. Some even passed out, unable to take the impact.

Yun Xing Hua came out of the place where he had been cultivating and lifting his gaze, he immediately saw an enormous lotus outside of Blood Swan Continent’s Grand Array. The lotus rotated slowly and every flower petal was exquisitely crafted, like the most beautiful work of art. Even so, he could sense an amazing power from it.

This was definitely an artifact that only a Second-Class great force could produce. Moreover, it would need to be a Second-Class great force with quite a strong heritage. Shocking Swan Pavilion had a similar artifact called Shocking Swan Platform, which cost countless resources to create.

Yun Xing Hua’s mouth was instantly filled with bitterness at the sight.

At this moment, the Defensive Grand Array of Blood Swan Continent had been activated and a transparent light barrier enveloped the entire Spirit Province. However, there was a deep indentation at one spot of the light barrier that was slowly restoring itself. Yun Xing Hua’s face twitched slightly at the sight when he realised that the indentation was caused by the lotus ramming into the Grand Array.

[Just who is inside that lotus!? I can’t believe they used an artifact like that to forcefully try to break Blood Swan Continent’s Defensive Grand Array! Are they insane!?]

It had to be said that while this kind of artifact might be powerful, it was also extremely expensive to produce. Repairing such an artifact was no easy feat once it was damaged; therefore, artifacts like this would generally be loved and cherished greatly no matter the great force that owned it. They would not allow the artifact to be damaged easily. On the contrary, this person was using the lotus artifact to smash into the Grand Array directly.

[What violent and ruthless methods.] Just as that thought crossed Yun Xing Hua’s mind, he saw the lotus backing up by several dozen kilometres. Then, it turned into a stream of light and charged towards Blood Swan Continent again.

Yun Xing Hua felt as though his eyes were about to pop out of their sockets. A chill surged up from the soles of his feet to the top of his head in an instant and without any hesitation whatsoever, he summoned the Array Jade and desperately poured his power into it, urgently mobilising the strength of the Defensive Grand Array.

The World Energy of Blood Swan Continent instantly felt like it had been siphoned away. Everything was directed into the Grand Array to enhance its strength. The transparent light barrier quickly became more solid, as though several layers had been added to it.

The process had only just been completed when the lotus collided directly with the light barrier, which caved inward so deeply that the changes were visible to the naked eye. The enormous lotus was like a Divine sword falling from the Heavens, stabbing into Blood Swan Continent’s vitals, giving off the impression that it wanted to smash Blood Swan Continent to pieces.

There was a loud booming explosion and Blood Swan Continent experienced another earthquake. The illusory phantom of a Small Universe appeared behind Yun Xing Hua’s back for a moment before vanishing and his World Force fluctuated.

The power of the Grand Array did not disappoint as the thick light barrier was like a rubber ball that caused the lotus to bounce backwards. However, it took a very long time for the dented portion of the light barrier to recover.

Yun Xing Hua groaned and staggered backwards. Blood was trickling out of his mouth and nose and his complexion was slightly pale. As the person controlling Blood Swan Continent’s Grand Array, his mind was connected to it; hence, he was also affected by the backlash when Blood Swan Continent was struck by the impact.

“Sect Master!” Numerous figures rushed over and stood next to him, looking outward with expressions of shock and horror.

Yun Xing Hua suppressed the churning vitality in his body and shouted across the Grand Array, “These friends! Please stop! I have something to say!”

He originally placed his hopes in the Defensive Grand Array, but it would now seem that his hopes were in vain. Although the Defensive Grand Array remained strong and did not break, he could not withstand much more himself. The lotus would only need to slam into the Grand Array another 3 to 5 times before he would be severely injured. At that time, without someone to control it, the Grand Array would collapse on its own.

There was no response from the enormous lotus; instead, it pulled back once more to create a distance of over a hundred kilometres before turning into a stream of light and shooting towards Blood Swan Continent again.

*Hong…*

The collision shook the sky. Countless Blood Swan Continent disciples passed out on the spot and even those in the Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm seemed unable to withstand the impact of the collision. They staggered slightly, their expressions turning grim.

Meanwhile, Yun Xing Hua spat out a mouthful of fresh blood and his aura withered all of a sudden. He was the one in charge of the Defensive Grand Array after all, so he received the most direct impact.

Nevertheless, Blood Swan Continent’s Defensive Grand Array held even after the 3 ramming blows. That was the strength of the Spirit Array. Even if Blood Swan Continent was only a Third-Class great force, it could rely on the power of its Grand Array to defend against an invading enemy that was stronger than itself.

On the other hand, the glow of the enormous lotus faded slightly after the 3 impacts. It would seem that it had been damaged as a result.

A delicate woman’s voice came from inside the lotus, “Xiao Guo Miao, the Young Master has helped you vent your anger. If you have not had enough, we can continue ramming them. We will break this tortoise shell and trample flat Blood Swan Continent.”

Inside Blood Swan Continent, many of the Open Heaven Realm Masters nearly spat blood at those words. [Such a violent and crazy approach was just to help Guo Miao vent her anger!? Just what kind of lunatic is hidden inside that lotus!?]

While they were trembling in fear, they heard a young girl’s voice, “Many thanks, Senior. This disciple only wishes for my father to be safe and sound. I don’t care about anything else.”

Elder Guan stood next to Yun Xing Hua and whispered, “That’s Guo Miao’s voice.”

Guo Miao had lived in Blood Swan Continent for many years. Since Elder Guan knew about her identity, it was only natural that he could also recognise her voice.

Yun Xing Hua nodded solemnly. He had long guessed the murderer who killed Gu Zhi Xin and the others would not leave things be. It was just that he never imagined they would appear outside Blood Swan Continent so quickly. Taking a deep breath, he suppressed the rage in his heart and cupped his fists, “Blood Swan Continent Yun Xing Hua offers his greetings. May I know to whom I am speaking? Will you show yourselves?”

The lotus floating in the sky spun slowly. Then, an opening appeared in the gaps between two flower petals and two people emerged from within that opening. One was a brave and heroic young man. He stood with his hands behind his back with an indifferent expression on his face while the other one was a beautiful and charming woman.

Yun Xing Hua’s eyes contracted at the sight. That was because, among the two people who appeared, he could sense a terrifying aura coming from the woman. That aura was something he only felt from the Old Pavilion Master of Shocking Swan Pavilion before.

“Sixth-Order!” Elder Guan exclaimed, his expression instantly becoming extremely ugly.

The other Open Heaven Realm Masters also felt their hearts sinking in their chest. Their expressions were gloomy and their nervous gulping was faintly audible. [A Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master!? Blood Swan Continent has kicked an iron plate this time! We’re doomed!]
