Two days later, Yang Kai felt that the surrounding strange fog had thinned out a little. He wasn’t sure if it was his imagination though.

Old Ban, who was walking in front of him, suddenly stopped and said, “We’ve almost reached the exit, Little Brother. The strange fog will no longer affect Divine Sense much. With your strength, you should be able to find the way out safely.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai quickly released his Divine Sense to investigate his surroundings and sure enough, he was able to scan a far wider range than before.

As long as he could use his Divine Sense, he should be able to navigate through the strange fog without trouble; moreover, his Divine Sense would only become clearer as he moved closer to the exit.

“Many thanks for guiding us until now, Old Ban. Please be careful going back,” Yang Kai said, cupping his fists.

“You don’t have to worry about me, Little Brother,” Old Ban replied with a slight smile, “If you need this old man’s guidance on the day of your return, you can go to the cave over there and wait.”

He pointed in one direction and then continued, “This old man will go there once every month to guide people back through the Ancient Lands Passageway; however, the time isn’t fixed.”

Yang Kai understood his meaning, “Old Ban is doing two-way business.”

He could take people who wanted to enter the Ancient Lands, and then take people out when he exited. It was quite a good business.

“This old man’s cultivation is low. Although I am knowledgeable about the terrain, I will not be able to resist if I encounter a powerful Yin Soul. As a guide, I also receive the protection of those I’m guiding.”

“You’ve thought of things out quite meticulously,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Alright, this old man will leave now. I wish you safe travels, Little Brother, Young Lady,” Old Ban bid farewell before leaving in the direction he had pointed out earlier, presumably to wait for people to guide back.

As soon as the old man disappeared, Yang Kai turned his eyes to the front, and after looking for a moment, he said, “Ruo Xi. I’ll go the rest of the way alone.”

Zhang Ruo Xi’s face was filled with distress. Although she wanted to help Yang Kai, she was still too weak and would only be a burden if she stayed, so she had no choice but to grit her teeth and leave.

With the flash of light, Yang Kai hid Zhang Ruo Xi inside the Sealed World Bead, then he began to move forward.

The more he moved forward, the less influence the strange fog would have, and the wider the range that Yang Kai’s Divine Sense could detect.

Just as he was about to leave the passageway and set foot into the real wilderness, Yang Kai suddenly stopped and looked around. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Here, the strange fog was almost transparent and barely affected him, so he could sense his surroundings clearly.

It was quiet, without any sign of living creatures or even the slightest fluctuation of Qi.

However, Yang Kai grinned and shouted, “I’m sure you’ve been eagerly awaiting this moment, Brother Yin. Now that it’s come, why bother hiding like this?”

As soon as his words came out, somewhere in the sky, it was as though a piece of perfect brocade and silk had been torn off, and suddenly, a line of more than twenty people appeared.

A pair of eyes, carrying great murderous intent, focused on Yang Kai.

At the same time, a streak of light flashed by, turning into a cloak-like artifact that fell into the hand of a red-clothed woman.

Yang Kai’s eyes lingered on the cloak for a moment before raising his brow and muttering, “A concealment artifact?”

He wasn’t certain that this was the place, but his intuition had told him the people from the Netherworld Sect were hiding here, so he spoke up to check and sure enough, his intuition was right.

It seemed that they were able to conceal themselves not because of a Secret Art, but because of the cloak.

To be able to hide so many people at once and escape even his detection… It was quite an amazing artifact.

Yang Kai looked at the red-clothed girl with some slight surprise.

Although he knew that she and Old Fu had entered the Ancient Lands Passageway one day prior, he hadn’t expected them to be together with the people of the Netherworld Sect. Furthermore, he didn’t know whether they were Netherworld Sect’s people or not.

At the moment, the red-clothed girl was glaring fiercely at him, seemingly very angry. She grit her teeth and demanded, “How did you find us?”

Old Fu could not help but sigh, “That shouldn’t be the case, Young Lady. This artifact is a treasure gifted to you by Sir himself. How could a trivial First-Order Emperor Realm Master be able to see through it?”

“How could that be? I clearly heard him speak just now,” the red-clothed girl said in dismay.

Old Fu was speechless, as were Yin Le Sheng and Hua Fei Chen.

[He was just probing, yet you revealed us immediately. Now you’re asking how he found us? Why are you running around outside without a brain?]

Originally, they thought they could take advantage of the red-clothed girl’s Emperor Artifact to catch Yang Kai off-guard; however, she had exposed them when Yang Kai was only three metres away from where they needed him to be!

At that moment, Yin Le Sheng and Hua Fei Chen’s faces were as black as the bottom of a pot.

If they had known this would happen, they wouldn’t have tried to borrow the power of the red-clothed girl’s artifact to conceal themselves.

“Are you two also from the Netherworld Sect?” Yang Kai asked, looking at the red-clothed girl and Old Fu.

Before Old Fu could answer, the red-clothed girl coldly snorted, “What thing is the Netherworld Sect? How could this Young Lady be from such a lowly place?”

With these words, Old Fu’s face cramped, and the expressions of Hua Fei Chen and Yin Le Sheng became even worse.

The red-clothed girl spoke thoughtlessly, but saying it so easily in front of the Netherworld Sect’s people was no different from slapping them in the face; after all, the Netherworld Sect was one of the top Sects in the Eastern Territory, its name inspiring awe and fear in the masses, but it was described by the red-clothed girl so disdainfully.

It was no wonder Hua Fei Chen and Yin Le Sheng’s expressions were so ugly.

If it were anyone else who said that, Hua Fei Chen would have slapped them in the face. However, he didn’t dare to touch a single hair on this red-clothed girl’s head.

Old Fu cut in hastily, “Please don’t take it to heart, Elder Hua. My Young Lady is always like this, it couldn’t be helped.”

Although Hua Fei Chen was annoyed, he could only respond with a cold face, “Very well. Young Lady Lin’er is quite frank. This King will not quibble with her.”

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed, and he nodded, “I understand now.”

The girl named Lin’er snapped, “You understand what?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “Nothing, just that this Young Lady seems to want to make things difficult for this Young Master by colluding with the Netherworld Sect.”

“So what if I am?” The girl named Lin’er said, gritting her teeth. When she saw Yang Kai standing there motionless, she assumed that he was afraid and immediately puffed out her chest.

“If you want to live, you’d better get on your knees and kowtow to this Young Lady, then give me your Soul Imprint and serve this Young Lady for ten years! Who knows, I might let you live!”

“No!” When Yin Le Sheng heard that, his face changed greatly and he immediately tried to stop her.

He brought so many people with him together, all to kill Yang Kai, so how could he let this red-clothed girl say that she could let him live?

Yang Kai must die today, no matter what!

However, without giving him a chance to continue, the girl named Lin’er turned her head and said angrily, “Shut up! How dare you interrupt this Young Lady?!”

Yin Le Sheng was so infuriated that his face twisted up, but he didn’t dare to say a word.

He could barely stand it. This little girl was clearly here to ask for their help, but at this moment, it was as though he and his Sect members had become her subordinates and needed to heed her every command.

The girl named Lin’er turned her attention to Yang Kai again, then she glanced around and frowned, “Where did that wench who was with you go?”

When she saw Yang Kai earlier, she was caught up in her anger and forgot about the existence of Zhang Ruo Xi. Now, she suddenly realized that Yang Kai was alone.

When he smiled without responding, she was angered, “Are you deaf? This Young Lady is asking you a question! Where did that wench who slapped my face go? I’m going to make her life worse than death!”

“Slapped…” Hua Fei Chen’s ears perked up as he directed a look of shock at the young girl.

The other disciples of the Netherworld Sect also looked horrified.

Someone who dared to slap this Young Lady’s face… existed? Who was this so-called ‘wench’ that truly didn’t fear the Heavens?

Meanwhile, Old Fu was standing off to the side, his forehead dripping with cold sweat, his legs almost shaking.

His Young Lady was slapped in the face while he was escorting her. It would’ve been fine if no one learned about it, but she just had to expose it to the public. If this were to spread to Sir’s ears, how could he possibly survive now?

The fearful Old Fu immediately looked over at Hua Fei Chen pleadingly, silently begging him to not let this out.

Hua Fei Chen returned his gaze and observed him, quickly figuring out what Old Fu was thinking and simply nodding.

Although Old Fu’s cultivation was lower than his, he was nonetheless born and raised from ‘that’ place and served as this Young Lady’s guard, so it wouldn’t hurt to have a good relationship with him. There may come a time when they need to use Old Fu, so this could benefit them in the future.

After getting a response, Old Fu quickly cupped his fists to express his gratitude.

The girl named Lin’er continued shouting, her bosom heaving in anger. Finally, she put her hands on her hips and scolded angrily, “Call that wench out for me. This Young Lady won’t spare her!”

She was confident that Yang Kai had hidden Zhang Ruo Xi somewhere.

Yang Kai coldly snorted and looked at her indifferently, “Little girl, this Young Master would advise you to learn your place. Otherwise, you will die somewhere sooner or later.”

“How dare you!” Old Fu roared. How could he just stand by and watch as his Young Lady was being threatened like this?

The girl named Lin’er was utterly stunned and didn’t react until several moments later, “You want to kill me?” she frowned.

“My patience is not limitless, girl. So what if I kill you?” Yang Kai sneered.

Upon hearing that, the girl flew into a hysterical rage.

“You want to kill me? You sure have guts! You people, hurry and come capture him for me!” She shrieked, urging Yin Le Sheng and the others around her to take action. It was as though the Netherworld Sect’s people were her subordinates.
