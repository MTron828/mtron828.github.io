The black hole was extremely small at first, but in the blink of an eye, it expanded rapidly as if it was trying to devour the world, giving the people an illusion of a coming apocalypse.

Darkness descended on them as the entire world became pitch black.

In the boundless darkness, something was vaguely growing rapidly.

Gao Shan and Liu Shui were the first to bear the brunt as various dark emotions in them suddenly started to materialize and surged up, causing their eyes to tremble and exude an extremely evil light. The darkness seemed to be able to swallow someone’s mind and make them fall into the path of evil.

“Not good!” Gao Shan bellowed, biting the tip of his tongue and spitting a mouthful of Blood Essence, barely managing to suppress his dark impulses.

It was the same for Liu Shui. Both of them looked pained and it seemed that they would not be able to hold on for long under this strange ability before they would succumb to their impulses and become Demons themselves.

At the moment of crisis, a deep and solemn voice suddenly resounded across the world.

The sound was infinite, seemingly near yet also far, ethereal and unpredictable. When this voice sounded, a ray of light abruptly burst out of the darkness.

A figure enveloped in light quietly floated mid-air, performing a series of profound hand seals, mumbling some unknown incantation.

All the cultivators who heard the sound of this incantation seemingly felt an invisible hand brushing their minds, washing away the surging darkness, and bringing clarity back to their Souls.

“It’s her!” Yang Kai stood not far away with an odd expression on his face, staring at the shimmering figure in the sky, unexpectedly discovering that this person turned out to be Ye Jing Han.

He had no idea what kind of Divine Ability she was performing, or how it could have such a powerful purifying effect on one’s spirit, immediately pulling all the cultivators here back from the abyss of misery.

After everyone regained their senses, they dared not linger and immediately escaped from the darkness with their Movement Skills. The two Protectors, Gao Shan and Liu Shui, saw there was a slim chance of survival and quickly fled too. Of course, they did not forget to drag Ning Yuan Shu along upon leaving.

Ye Jing Han’s cultivation was only Second-Order Dao Source Realm, so even if she possessed a profound Divine Ability that could restrain the darkness, she certainly wouldn’t be able to maintain it for long. After just ten breaths, her pretty face turned pale and the light emitting from her body diminished drastically.

She seemed to have exhausted all her strength and had none left for her to escape, her head drooping as she fell from the sky, like a beautiful flower petal that had wilted and was now falling to its death.

At this crucial moment, Hua Qing Si threw out a red ribbon, wrapped it around Ye Jing Han, and pulled her out of the darkness, taking her and Zhang Ruo Xi together with Liu Yan and running away without looking back.

Seeing this situation, Yang Kai dared not to hesitate, turned around and teleported away with the help of the local Space Principles.

He could not count on any of the cultivators here and could only rely on himself. However, the priority now was to restore his strength as soon as possible.

Shortly after Yang Kai left, the Artifact Spirit lowered its War Hammer and the darkness dissipated. It turned its head and looked around, only seeing an empty surrounding with not even a shadow of a living being. However, it quickly fixed its gaze on the direction where Yang Kai escaped towards and chased after him while hefting its War Hammer.

Clear Jade Mountain, about ten thousand kilometres away from Maplewood City.

The Divine Spirit Luan Feng once appeared here and burned away a large swath of the mountain forest with its World Extinguishing Black Flames. Even though nearly two years had passed since then, the black flames showed no sign of fading and continued to burn vigorously.

This region had become a barren scorched earth, with not a blade of grass growing within a hundred-kilometre radius, only patches of black flames covering the ground.

Although this place was deserted and ruined, it had become a paradise for those who cultivated Fire Attribute Secret Arts and Secret Techniques.

Many cultivators who cultivated the Fire Attribute came here despite the danger to seek comprehension from the profound World Extinguishing Black Flames. After all, these were the flames of an Ancient Divine Spirit and seemed to contain unlimited power. If they could refine just a tiny bit of these flames, it would be enough to benefit them for a lifetime.

Yang Kai had long heard that there were many Fire Attribute cultivators gathered around Clear Jade Mountain and had also thought of bringing Liu Yang here to absorb its power. Since Liu Yan was able to refine even the feather of the Luan Feng, there was no reason she would be helpless against these World Extinguishing Black Flames.

However, he had been too busy recently to do so.

With his continuous teleportations, Yang Kai reached Clear Jade Mountain within a short time, arriving at the land which was incinerated by the Luan Feng that day.

Sweeping his eyes across this place, Yang Kai discovered many cultivators cultivating here. Everyone’s aura was burning hot, so obviously they were cultivating Fire Attribute Secret Arts or Secret Techniques.

Perceiving the arrival of Yang Kai, many of them opened their eyes and glanced at him, but ignored him afterwards.

Yang Kai scanned them with his Divine Sense, his face turning solemn.

This was because he found that there was no one here with decent cultivation. Most were just Origin Kings or Origin Returning Realm cultivators; even the few Dao Source Realm cultivators were just First-Order which would be of no help to him now

He was hoping to rely on these cultivators to distract the Artifact Spirit, but now, it seemed his plan was doomed from the start.

But soon, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he stared towards the centre of the black flames.

There was a safe zone at the very epicentre of the devastation about ten meters in radius, a place where the black flames did not even reach.

After thinking for a while, he shouted, “Everyone, it will soon become dangerous here. If you don’t want to die, leave now.”

The cultivators were woken from their meditation by his words, opened their eyes, and glared at him.

Someone even chuckled and threatened him, “Little brat, what did you just say? Say it again if you dare!”

That person saw that Yang Kai was young, and thought that his cultivation must not be high, so he did not take him seriously.

Yang Kai glanced at the person and faintly smiled, “I spoke very clearly, and I’m urging all of you to leave for your own good.”

“Little brat, I bet you just want to monopolize this divine fire!” An old man looked coldly at Yang Kai, “Young man, you need to know that bringing convenience to others means bringing convenience to yourself. This divine fire covers a huge radius and there is plenty of space here, so just find a place to sit and comprehend its mysteries quietly. There is no need to find trouble with others right? Even if you are strong, you should know that two fists can’t block four strikes. This Old Master advises you to behave yourself and not speak nonsense here.”

Yang Kai simply shrugged, “I’m not planning to comprehend the mysteries of this divine fire. It’s just that a dangerous entity is approaching this place and if you don’t leave now, it will be too late.”

“What dangerous entity?!” A tall and robust man, who had a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation, snorted coldly. Yang Kai had never met this guy before and he did not know if he was a local or a foreign cultivator.

However, he was not surprised since there were a lot of foreign cultivators appearing in Maplewood City recently. This burly man continued bellowing, “Boy, don’t be such an alarmist, otherwise, don’t blame Father here for being impolite to you!”

Yang Kai’s face changed abruptly, frowning slightly as he forced a smile, “Alright, it will be difficult for you to leave now.”

“What?”

“You little brat! You still dare to threaten us? Do you think I won’t peel your skin off!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“This is outrageous! This brat doesn’t put us in his eyes at all! Let’s teach him a lesson!”

Just as everyone was ranting in a rage, a sound abruptly broke through the sky, and the Artifact Spirit’s figure was revealed on the horizon, startling everyone. As they all looked towards the Artifact Spirit with doubtful faces, they quickly sensed its malevolent and powerful aura and went pale, realizing that Yang Kai was telling the truth.

“Run! Why are you still sitting here like idiots? Are you hoping to die!?” Yang Kai yelled.

Everyone’s expressions changed drastically. This Artifact Spirit did not look like a being they could provoke, and the intensity of the aura it gave off was comparable to an Emperor Realm Master, so no one dared to hesitate and immediately got up and ran away using their Movement Skills.

The Artifact Spirit seemed to have no interest in anyone else but Yang Kai, so it ignored these people and simply fixed its scarlet eyes on him.

A short while later, all the cultivators who had been cultivating the mysteries of the black flames here had evacuated.

Yang Kai grinned at the Artifact Spirit, “I’m really curious how much sentience you have.” While speaking, he raised one finger and asked, “How many is this?”

The Artifact Spirit was indifferent.

Yang Kai laughed out loud and answered, “This is two! You fool!”

Just as he finished speaking, the Artifact Spirit raised its War Hammer. Yang Kai’s expression slightly changed when he saw this and hastily dived into the safe zone surrounded by the black flame, laughing arrogantly, “Come and beat me! Come and beat me if you dare!”

As if provoked by Yang Kai’s words, the Artifact Spirit rushed towards him.

However, as soon as the Artifact Spirit stepped into the land of burning black flames, it acted as if it was shocked by something and rapidly retreated.

The Artifact Spirit’s dark body was caught by several clusters of tiny black flames, and even though these clusters were small, they burned brilliantly.

There was nothing in this world that could not be burnt by the Luan Feng’s World Extinguishing Black Flames, not even an Emperor Artifact.

It was just that the black flames here had been burning for a long time without the support of the Luan Feng, so they had naturally become much weaker than before.

Even so, such flames were still not easy to put out.

The Artifact Spirit seemed to sense the danger of these flames and kept pushing its power to extinguish them, but to no avail, so it started to become irritated.

It lifted its Demonic War Hammer and directly hit itself.

That blow made a buzzing sound and released a powerful shockwave.

Yang Kai squinted in fright, “So hot-headed!”

Although the Artifact Spirit was born from the Demonic War Hammer, such an impact on its own body would still cause some unpredictable consequences. It was obvious that the sentience of the Artifact Spirit was not high, and therefore, it simply acted recklessly.

Still, the blow was actually quite effective.

The flames that were beaten by the Demonic War Hammer seemed to have dimmed a lot.

Seeing this, the Artifact Spirit tilted its head curiously; then, as if it had found an excellent solution, it lifted its War Hammer again and began constantly beating the flames on its body.

Yang Kai, who was looking coldly from the side, was thinking that this might keep it occupied for a while, so he immediately felt relieved and snorted coldly, “Take your time, this Young Master will teach you some proper manners later!”
