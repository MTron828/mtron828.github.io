Within Azure Sun Temple, every single Elder was granted their own Spirit Peak; Purple Bamboo Peak was Gao Xue Ting’s domain.

If Yang Kai were to be conferred the title of Elder in Azure Sun Temple, he would also be bestowed with the same level of treatment; however, since the Grand Canonization Ceremony would only be held after a few days, Yang Kai could only live on Purple Bamboo Peak in the interim.

The peak was peaceful and quiet, without a single servant present. Gao Xue Ting arranged for Yang Kai to reside in the guest residence, advising him to not run about recklessly, before turning around to leave.

“Elder Gao!” All of a sudden, Yang Kai suddenly shouted out to stop her.

Gao Xue Ting turned back.

“Disciple needs to request Elder Gao’s assistance for a matter,” Yang Kai said in a serious tone.

“What’s the matter?”

“I wish to take a trip into the Divine Ascension Mirror!”

“You want to enter the Divine Ascension Mirror?” A frown appeared on Gao Xue Ting’s face, “Why?”

The Divine Ascension Mirror was Azure Sun Temple’s greatest secret. Previously, Yang Kai was able to enter the Divine Ascension Mirror world only due to the numerous Star Seals he had brought back to the temple, a great merit that warranted his entry. Now, however, despite being a quasi-Elder of Azure Sun Temple, with the qualifications to enter the Divine Ascension Mirror, he still couldn’t simply go in there as he wished. Therefore, it was natural for Gao Xue Ting to want a thorough explanation for his request.

After a moment of silence, Yang Kai did not conceal anything and proceeded to tell her about his agreement with Tian Yan.

Gao Xue Ting gasped in shock, “You actually managed to make such an agreement with that Senior during your last trip to the Divine Ascension Mirror?”

“Yes,” Yang Kai nodded his head. “I agreed to it without much thought back then; however, after so many years, I should give him a proper reply.”

Gao Xue Ting replied in a slightly absent-minded manner, “I never expected you to have such great fortune… since you’ve made such an agreement, you should honour it. However, the Fleshly Body Pill isn’t easy to obtain.”

“I’ve already obtained the Fleshly Body Pill,” Yang Kai replied with a faint smile.

Gao Xue Ting’s expression shook, “You have?”

Yang Kai smiled in response, “I’ve already acquired the required materials and in a few days, my High Heaven Palace’s Emperor Alchemist should finish refining the Fleshly Body Pill.”

“What are the chances of success?” Gao Xue Ting asked in a somewhat impatient voice. Although this was the first time she had heard about the Fleshly Body Pill, she knew that such a pill would definitely not be easy to refine. Even an Emperor Alchemist might not be able to guarantee a one hundred percent refining success rate.

Yang Kai replied, “I forgot to inform Elder Gao, my High Heaven Palace’s Emperor Alchemist is the Fifth Disciple of the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor.”

Gao Xue Ting was instantly dumbstruck, taking quite a while before pushing out a shocked reply, “You managed to poach the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor’s Legacy Disciple to be your Sect’s Chief Alchemist?”

Such boldness! Originally, it was already shocking that Yang Kai’s High Heaven Palace had an Emperor Alchemist amongst their ranks; however, Gao Xue Ting had never expected that this Emperor Alchemist would actually have such an illustrious background. That was the Fifth Legacy Disciple of the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor! Even Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters would have to show great respect to such a person.

The matter that puzzled Gao Xue Ting the most was, why would the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor consent to this?

Nevertheless, with the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor’s Disciple personally taking action, the possibility of a refining failure was quite minimized.

“It isn’t too difficult if you wish to enter the Divine Ascension Mirror today; however, at this moment…” All of a sudden, a frown appeared on Gao Xue Ting’s face.

“What happened?” Yang Kai asked.

Gao Xue Ting replied, “Since you’re not an outsider, it’s alright for you to know about this. Right now, there are people currently using the Divine Ascension Mirror, and it is imperative to not disturb them unless absolutely necessary. Therefore, it is somewhat difficult if you wish to enter the Divine Ascension Mirror at this moment.”

A look of surprise appeared on Yang Kai’s face.

Earlier, the people he had met on top of Myriad Saints Peak included all of Azure Sun Temple’s higher-ups, so who could be using the Divine Ascension Mirror right now? Furthermore, they weren’t to be disturbed? It seemed as though the person using the Divine Ascension Mirror had an extraordinary status.

Even thinking along these lines though, Yang Kai was not able to identify this person.

“I’ll talk to Temple Master about this, to see if we are able to devise a win-win solution to this. If it really isn’t possible… you should just wait here for a while. In any case, it has been so many years since your agreement with that Senior and you don’t have the Fleshly Body Pill on you right now anyways.”

“Okay,” Yang Kai nodded. With the situation as it was at the moment, he had no choice but to agree.

He proceeded to ask about Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao’s current situations, and found out that they had both entered retreat after returning from the Shattered Star Sea. Currently, they had yet to show any signs of coming out, so Yang Kai had to cancel his plan of catching up with them.

Those two were Core Disciples of Azure Sun Temple, future pillars of the Sect. Nevertheless, they were just a little lacking when compared to Xia Sheng, as the latter was able to break through to the Emperor Realm inside the Shattered Star Sea. In comparison, Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao were unable to do so. Nevertheless, they had still reaped substantial benefits there, making them develop a will to not leave their closed-door cultivation until they broke through to the Emperor Realm.

After Gao Xue Ting departed, Yang Kai proceeded to sit down. Extending his hand, a large chest made of exquisitely crafted metal appeared before him.

The Great Soaring Black Dragon Armor!

Since he had purchased this Mid-Rank Emperor Grade Artifact Armor from Violet Source Auction, Yang Kai hadn’t had the time for a detailed inspection of it until this moment.

Extending his hand, Yang Kai opened the case and began gently brushing the Artifact Armor. In an instant, a furious roar suddenly rang out from within, before black Qi started to rapidly gush out from the pieces that made up the Artifact Armour. Coalescing together into a black mass, the light formed into a black flood dragon that stared sharply towards Yang Kai.

“Ah…” Raising his head to look at the illusionary phantom, a grin spread across Yang Kai’s face.

According to the descriptions from Violet Source Chamber of Commerce, this Great Soaring Black Dragon Armor was created from the scales of a Black Flood Dragon. Black Flood Dragons were extremely rare existences, and were renowned for their formidable defensive strength. During this armour’s refinement, the Black Flood Dragon’s Monster Core should have been fused into it, resulting in a wisp of the Black Flood Dragon’s Soul being sealed into the Artifact Armor.

In other words, this Great Soaring Black Dragon Armor seemed to possess an Artifact Spirit.

An artifact like this that was refined from the body parts of a powerful Monster Beast was capable of fusing perfectly with the Monster Core of its origin Monster Beast.

This wasn’t mentioned by the Violet Source Chamber of Commerce. Yang Kai guessed that they were afraid that this fact would affect their customers’ valuation of this item. Although an Artifact with an Artifact Spirit would generally fetch a much higher price, it would also depend on what type of Artifact Spirit it possessed.

The Artifact Spirit of this Great Soaring Black Dragon Armor was the Soul of a Black Flood Dragon. Despite only being a Flood Dragon, it still possessed the bloodline of the Dragon Clan. Therefore, most people would not be able to subdue an Artifact Spirit like this.

A good example would be the sudden appearance of the Black Flood Dragon’s Soul the instant Yang Kai made contact with the Great Soaring Black Dragon Armor. If the user didn’t refine this Artifact Spirit, making it recognise them as its owner, it would be utterly impossible for them to access the full might of this Artifact Armor.

The gigantic Black Flood Dragon Artifact Spirit appeared almost corporeal as it shot a disdainful look at Yang Kai, just like how one would look at an ant.

However, in the next instant, a suppressive dragon roar rang out from the ant-like figure before it. Golden light blossomed, before the Source Strength of the Golden Divine Dragon erupted mightily from Yang Kai, manifesting in a giant golden dragon far larger than the Black Flood Dragon Artifact Spirit behind Yang Kai’s head.

At this moment, the Black Flood Dragon, a dead object that didn’t possess any consciousness, unexpectedly revealed a sense of dread on its face, while its raised head drooped a little. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

As the aura of the Golden Divine Dragon erupted, the Black Flood Dragon subconsciously shrank back into the chest.

The strength of bloodline suppression within the Dragon Clan was a strange and mysterious sight to behold; it was a terrifying oppression that no other race could fathom.

A good example would be when Li Jiao, a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, was unable to muster even an ounce of resistance against Zhu Qing. No matter how powerful they became, any existence with the bloodline of the Dragon Clan would have no choice but to be shackled by this unbreakable fetter.

Against any other ordinary Third-Order Emperor, Zhu Qing would still be able to obtain victory in a fight, though it would not be an easy fight. However, she would be able to reap Li Jiao’s life with ease.

“Afraid?” Yang Kai revealed a villainous grin, shooting a sinister look at the Artifact Spirit as he said, “If you’re afraid, scram back and let me use you at will. If not, I’ll erase your Soul!”

No one knew if the Black Flood Dragon Artifact Spirit actually understood words or not; however, right as Yang Kai’s words rang out, it retreated and fused back into the Artifact Armor.

As this was happening, with Wen Zi Shan in the lead, the group of Azure Sun Temple Elders had solemn expressions on their faces as they stood on top of Myriad Saints Peaks.

Two streaks of light flew over rapidly, descending before the group, revealing the figures of Xiao Yu Yang and Xiao Chen a moment later.

“Xiao Chen greets Temple Master Wen and various Seniors!” Xiao Chen cupped his hands in respect. Despite his pride and high self-esteem, as well as his unbridled arrogance against his peers, he still maintained proper etiquette, not forgetting to greet the Seniors present before him.

Wen Zi Shan smiled and nodded, “Young Master Xiao is thoughtful.” Cupping his fists to Xiao Yu Yang, he continued, “It has been a while, Brother Xiao.”

“Temple Master Wen!” Xiao Yu Yang replied in a serious tone.

Although he was a member of Star Soul Palace, and similarly a Third-Order Emperor, he did not dare to show any ounce of overbearingness before the Temple Master of Azure Sun Temple, Wen Zi Shan.

Without waiting for Xiao Yu Yang to speak, Wen Zi Shan cut in, “You’ve come just in time for a joyous occasion for my temple, Brother Xiao. You certainly have to be a guest here for a few days.”

“Joyous occasion?” A frown appeared on Xiao Yu Yang’s face as he replied, “What joyous occasion?”

Wen Zi Shan replied, “It’s like this. In five days, our temple will be canonizing a new Elder. If Brother Xiao isn’t in a hurry, please stay behind to drink some celebratory wine.”

Hearing those words, Xiao Yu Yang’s eyes narrowed before he gave a reply in a cold tone, “Temple Master Wen, from what this King knows, among your noble sect’s Core Disciples, Xiao Sheng already broke through to the Emperor Realm quite some time ago, and already holds the position of Elder, while the others are in closed-door cultivation and won’t be coming out in short order. The person you are able to confer this position to couldn’t be the person I am looking for, right?”

A confused look appeared on Wen Zi Shan’s face, “Huh? Who is Brother Xiao looking for?”

Xiao Yu Yang proceeded to speak while emphasizing every word he said, “Yang… Kai!”

Wen Zi Shan responded with a surprised look, “Brother Xiao, what a genuine surprise, you’re actually able to guess that! Admirable! Admirable!”

Xiao Yu Yang roared out in fury, “Temple Master Wen!”

Seeing Wen Zi Shan still playing dumb, Xiao Yu Yang’s anger erupted.

With a chuckle, Wen Zi Shan replied, “Did Brother Xiao predict such a matter beforehand and come earlier to offer your congratulations? You really are too thoughtful.”

The veins on Xiao Yu Yang’s temples bulged and throbbed as he quickly snapped back, “Having known you for so many years, this Xiao will give you advice to not attract disaster onto yourself, Brother Wen.”

Wen Zi Shan could not help but narrow his eyes as he replied, “I don’t understand what you’re saying, Brother Xiao. Our temple is only inducting a new Elder. How would that invite disaster onto ourselves?”

Xiao Yu Yang stared intently at Wen Zi Shan, “That boy killed Tan Jun Hao and Wu Ming. I don’t think Temple Master Wen is unaware of this matter.”

Wen Zi Shan gasped in shock, “That’s impossible, right? Tan Jun Han is a Third-Order Emperor, while Wu Ming is a Second-Order Emperor. Compared to them, Yang Kai is just a First-Order Emperor. How could he have killed them? That’s absolutely impossible! Could there be some mistake?”

Xiao Yu Yang sneered in response, “Over twenty Emperor Realm Masters hailing from as many Sects of the Southern Territory bore witness to this matter, so how could it be a mistake?”
