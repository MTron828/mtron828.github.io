Only after settling all these things did Yang Kai release his Divine Sense. Then, in the next moment, his body teleported and appeared in front of his Embodiment, Liu Yan, and the others.

“Master, are you alright?” Liu Yan asked with a happy face as soon as she saw Yang Kai appear.

A few days ago, she went to check on Yang Kai’s condition when she noticed him entering the Small Sealed World, but she never expected to see Yang Kai being plagued by Demon Qi, so she had been worried ever since.

The Embodiment and Hua Qing Si were also extremely worried.

Of course, when they saw Yang Kai alive and well, there was no way they didn’t realize that he had already dealt with the Demon Qi.

“En, I’ve come back to life!” Yang Kai grinned.

Hua Qing Si said with a serious expression, “Are you sure there are no after-effects? You can’t be too careless.”

“Rest assured, Sister Hua.” While speaking, Yang Kai took something out of his Space Ring and handed it to Hua Qing Si, “Here, this is for you.”

Hua Qing Si took it with suspicion, but then her pretty face paled and she called out in shock, “An Emperor Artifact?”

What Yang Kai handed her was the Five-Coloured Spear that Yao Chang Jun used before this. After that duel to the death, and before Yang Kai entered the Small Sealed World, he managed to snatch away this Emperor Artifact and Yao Chang Jun’s Space Ring.

Liu Yan already had the Annihilation Thunder Bead and Hua Qing Si had always been loyal to Yang Kai, so he felt relieved handing this Five-Coloured Spear over to her for her use.

“An Emperor Artifact is powerful, but the most important thing to a cultivator is still their foundation. Sister Hua, don’t put the cart before the horse,” Yang Kai said.

Hua Qing Si fiddled with the Five-Coloured Spear in her hands and looked completely overjoyed with it. She nodded and told him off, “I know that, do I still need you to teach me?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Yang Kai grinned meaningfully and touched his own nose.

He did not have time to check Yao Chang Jun’s Space Ring yet; however, taking it out now, he found that there were quite a lot of good things inside.

There were hundreds of millions of Source Crystals alone. What’s more, most of them were Mid-Rank and High-Rank. But it was within Yang Kai’s expectations for a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master like Yao Chang Jun to have amassed this much wealth.

He had such a high cultivation, so how could he be broke?

Besides the Source Crystals, there were also large amounts of Spirit Pills and Artifacts, but none of them were Emperor Grade.

After checking around for a bit, Yang Kai suddenly remembered something and asked, stunned, “Where’s Liu Xian Yun?”

Liu Xian Yun had passed out earlier, so Yang Kai tossed her into the Small Sealed World in order to avoid accidentally hurting her during his fight with Yao Chang Jun. However, she was nowhere to be seen right now.

Liu Yan explained, “I placed her at the pavilion and she is already awake now, but she seems to be confused about her situation.”

“You didn’t explain anything to her?”

“No,” Liu Yan shook her head. Not to mention explaining, she didn’t even show her face to Liu Xian Yun.

“I’ll take a look.” As he spoke, Yang Kai’s figure had already disappeared.

Inside the pavilion, Liu Xian Yun had a serious expression and her eyes were filled with bewilderment.

She found herself in this pavilion when she woke up earlier, and she had no idea what this place was. Looking around, she found that there was no danger here, and nobody could be found nearby either. On the other hand, the World Energy here was absurdly dense.

Liu Xian Yun had never seen a place with such rich World Energy as this. This place must be a cultivation paradise, one where she didn’t even need to circulate her Secret Arts to absorb the World Energy around her as it would simply seep into her pores on its own.

If she could cultivate here for a while, then it may not take long before she was able to break through her shackles and advance to the Second-Order Dao Source Realm.

But she was so set on trying to figure out where she was right now that she didn’t have the heart to cultivate. What worried her the most was the fact that Yang Kai was nowhere to be found. After several days of searching, she even began to wonder if she had been abandoned.

But while she was staying mournfully in the attic at this moment, thinking about where she should go in the future, a figure suddenly flashed in front of her, and Yang Kai appeared mysteriously just like that.

“Senior Brother...” When Liu Xian Yun saw Yang Kai, it was as if she had found her pillar of support and rushed towards him, her anxious expression clearly relaxing a lot.

Yang Kai smiled, “Something happened and I was occupied for a few days.”

“It’s good as long as you’re okay, Senior Brother.” Liu Xian Yun swept her eyes over Yang Kai for a while and found that he was full of energy. Only then did she put her heart at ease and ask, “Senior Brother, do you know where this is? Weren’t we swallowed up by that huge vortex earlier?”

Her memory was still stuck at the unforeseen disaster in the Solitary Void Mountain Range. When she remembered how they were unable to fight back against the power of that vortex, her pretty face could not help but pale a little.

“We did get swallowed up, then we landed atop a sea.”

“A sea?” Liu Xian Yun was even more confused now. She had been exploring the surrounding area these past few days but she never saw any sea. Instead, the environment here was extremely pleasant. There were many buildings, and it was apparent that many people used to live here.

[If I could settle down here with Senior Brother, that would be nice.]

Yang Kai scratched his head. He had no idea how to explain the current situation to Liu Xian Yun, so he could only say, “I’ll show you around.”

While speaking, Yang Kai left the Sealed World Bead with Liu Xian Yun with a thought.

As soon as they emerged, they were surrounded by a fishy smell. Following that, they could hear a strange sound coming from all directions, and even the sound of a beating heart.

Just by sweeping through the place with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai found where they currently were.

He previously ignored where the Sealed World Bead was going to land so that he could seal the Demon Qi. As such, he allowed the Sealed World Bead to fall into the depths of the sea. Only, after a few days passed, Yang Kai had no idea how, but it seemed it ended up in the stomach of a big fish.

It seemed that this big fish had swallowed the Sealed World Bead and then swam with them all the way to who knows where.

After understanding this, Yang Kai circulated his Source Qi and shot out a Golden Blood Thread. After a chaotic dance, he opened a hole right through the fish’s back and brought Liu Xian Yun up.

Even though the fish was quite big, it was not a powerful Monster Beast, so it could not bear the pain of Yang Kai tossing about inside it and was constantly rolling around in the sea as fresh blood spilled out. From the looks of it, it likely wouldn’t be able to survive.

In the next moment, Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun sped out to the surface of the sea. Summoning his wooden boat, Yang Kai got on top of it with Liu Xian Yun in tow.

A faint fishiness wafted out from the sea and all they could see around them were blue waves and blue skies. Endless seas as far as the eyes could see and countless waterspouts all around. Whirlpools surrounded them as well, looking particularly dangerous.

Liu Xian Yun was stunned.

She still hadn’t managed to figure out where she was before, so appearing suddenly on top of the sea had put her at a loss.

“After we were swallowed by the vortex, this is where we popped up.” Yang Kai swept his eyes around the place and could not help but feel a little disappointed when he found no trace of land.

“Where is this?” Liu Xian Yun asked, shocked.

“From what Yao Chang Jun and Pang Guang said, this place seems to be some Solitary Void Sealed World,” Yang Kai frowned.

“Solitary Void Sealed World?” Liu Xian Yun looked bewildered. It seemed like she had never heard of such a place. She had only been in Marsh City for a few years and did not know too much about the deeper secrets of this place, so she naturally never heard of the Solitary Void Sealed World.

“Yao Chang Jun and Pang Guang are also here?” Liu Xian Yun suddenly realized the meaning behind Yang Kai’s words and was startled again.

“Don’t worry, I don’t know where they went,” Yang Kai answered casually. He did not tell her that Yao Chang Jun was already dead. On the other hand, Pang Guang had fled so Yang Kai really didn’t know where he was.

“So, what should we do now?”

“Well, since we’re here, let’s settle down first.” Yang Kai sighed, “First, we’ll find out if anyone else is living here and get some information about this place. Then, we can look for a way out.”

“En. Let’s go with your plan, Senior Brother.” Liu Xian Yun did not have any ideas, so she could only put her hopes on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai then picked a direction and flew off on the wooden boat.

The large sea looked endless. Yang Kai could not even tell north from south and could only keep flying in one direction, hoping to find something.

But the waterspouts present all over the surface of the sea were causing a huge obstacle to him.

The waterspouts had strong suction power, and if they really fell into them, even a Dao Source Realm cultivator may not be able to get out safely.

In order to get away from the suction force of the waterspouts, Yang Kai also consumed a great amount of energy.

Three whole days passed, and the two still did not find anything. It was as if the sea was truly endless. Even someone as calm as Yang Kai could not help but feel a little uneasy. If they really couldn’t find a place to settle down, then would the two of them have to keep on flying forever?

If that happened, the two of them would end up dead sooner or later. Even though they could avoid danger in the Sealed World Bead and rest and recuperate, they would still be trapped here for life if unable to find the way out.

“Junior Sister, come and take over for a while, I need to rest for a bit.” Yang Kai beckoned Liu Xian Yun over and passed the controls of the wooden boat to her.

“En.” Liu Xian Yun had been wanting to help Yang Kai for a long time, so she was happy to take over when he asked her to do so.

“Watch out for those waterspouts. If you find one that’s too big, then it’s better to go around it than to try and force your way through it. Those things are dangerous.” Yang Kai cautioned her before sitting down cross-legged. Tossing a few restorative Spirit Pills into his mouth, and silently circulating his Secret Art.

The World Energy inside this Solitary Void Sealed World was extremely dense, not more so than in the Sealed World Bead, but definitely higher than an average Sect’s cultivation paradises.

Yang Kai figured that he could recover quickly if he used Spirit Pills and cultivate here.

But only a short time passed before he realized that something wasn’t quite right.

The World Energy that was being drawn into his body seemed to be mixed with something else that Yang Kai could not identify. This strange energy felt like sharp needles that constantly pricked his meridians and body when it entered his body, causing immense physical pain.

The more he cultivated, the more of this stuff he absorbed.

An hour later, Yang Kai coughed up a mouthful of blood, his face looking terrible.

“Senior Brother, what happened?” Liu Xian Yun’s face suddenly changed. Yang Kai was clearly restoring his Source Qi, so how did he end up coughing up blood as if he had received a severe injury, especially when there were no enemies nearby.

“The World Energy in this place is strange, don’t absorb it. The more you do, the higher the chance you hurt yourself!” Yang Kai said through gritted teeth as he wiped the blood from the corners of his mouth.
