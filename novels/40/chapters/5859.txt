Yang Kai arrived at the Supreme Headquarters as requested and dashed inside the side hall.

Meanwhile, Mi Jing Lun sensed his presence and transmitted a message to him, telling Yang Kai to wait while he finished with a certain matter. Once he was done, he came out tiredly and sat beside Yang Kai before taping on the teacup beside him.

Yang Kai grinned meaningfully and poured Mi Jing Lun a cup. Then, Mi Jing Lun finished his tea in one gulp before revealing a relaxed expression.

After a long silence, Mi Jing Lun suddenly spoke up, “Although there’s no war, there are a lot of miscellaneous things to take care of. I don’t have a competent adjutant with me, so if you don’t have anything to do, how about you help out at the Supreme Headquarters?”

Sipping on his tea, Yang Kai looked outside the hall and asked, “Senior Brother Xiang is a better candidate than me.”

Mi Jing Lun pursed his lips, “He says he’s going to enter retreat.”

“What about Senior Brother Ou Yang?”

“He also wants to enter retreat.”

“Then…”

“All of them want to enter retreat!” While saying that, Mi Jing Lun felt angry, “We’re all Ninth-Order Masters! Do they think I don’t want to enter retreat too?!”

Yang Kai looked at him helplessly, “There has to be someone dealing with these matters, and Senior Brother Mi is the best candidate.” A short pause later, he continued, “Don’t feel too pressured. It’s indeed hard for the Human Race to get to this point, so no matter what happens in the future, we just have to go all out and hope for the best.”

He could understand Mi Jing Lun’s frustrations. Now that the Humans had taken back the 3,000 Worlds, the situation seemed bright for them, but that was only on the surface.

The following battle was critical to determining whether the Human Race would survive or perish. If they could take back the No-Return Pass, the Humans would be taking one big step towards victory, but if they couldn’t, all of their efforts would be for nought.

Moreover, they had to be quick when taking down the No-Return Pass because they couldn’t afford to fight a prolonged battle. Without mentioning other reasons, just their supply of resources wasn’t enough to sustain a protracted war.

Therefore, as the leading figure of the Supreme Headquarters responsible for integrating and managing all the Armies, Mi Jing Lun was shouldering an unfathomable amount of pressure. That pressure was so huge that Yang Kai couldn’t shoulder it, even as a Ninth-Order Master.

If another Ninth-Order Master were helping Mi Jing Lun, they could help carry some of the responsibilities; however, there were only so many Ninth-Order Masters at this moment, and none of them were suitable candidates.

There had to be someone dealing with these matters… Though it didn’t sound like much in conversation, Yang Kai knew how large of a burden was resting on Mi Jing Lun’s shoulders.

Meanwhile, Mi Jing Lun knew this as well. The reason he mentioned this to Yang Kai was not that he intended for Yang Kai to help and stay in the Supreme Headquarters, he was simply venting. Yang Kai was currently the strongest Master they had besides the two Giant Spirit Gods, so no matter what, he shouldn’t be cooped up inside the Supreme Headquarters handling logistics; instead, the place he belonged was the battlefield.

“Never mind. Let’s talk about more serious matters,” Mi Jing Lun changed the topic, confirming he was only ranting just now, “I’ve discussed this with the others. It will take 10 years at minimum, and 20 years at most for us to get ready. Then we’ll be able to attack the No-Return Pass. Do you have any suggestions?”

10 to 20 years may seem like a long time, but to prepare for a battle involving the entire Race, it was actually a very short period of time; after all, they had to re-organize and coordinate all the individual Armies and prepare the supplies and weapons prior to beginning the battle. All of these processes were time-consuming because the war wasn’t only about sending all their troops out.

Yang Kai shook his head, “Since things have come to this point, I don’t have anything to suggest. If we want to win, we simply need to have enough strength to do it.”

Hearing that, Mi Jing Lun nodded lightly, “It seems like our thoughts are aligned. When the time comes, I need you to lead the way to enter the Black Ink Battlefield through Black Territory.”

“Of course,” Yang Kai nodded. If they wanted to take back the No-Return Pass, it wasn’t workable to attack from the Barren Territory; after all, the Territory Gate was a fixed size. If the Human Race attacked through it, it would give the Black Ink Clan a chance to gradually kill them. Therefore, the only option they had to attack the No-Return Pass was to first pass through that secret passage and gather their troops deep inside the Black Ink Battlefield before assaulting the Black Ink Clan’s base.

After a short pause, Yang Kai asked, “How about the Barren Territory?”

“I heard you left the two Giant Spirit Gods there to guard the Territory Gate. With them there, I’m sure the Black Ink Clan wouldn’t doom themselves by trying to pass through. Also, they don’t intend to do anything anyway.”

With Ah Da and Ah Er standing guard on the other side of the Territory Gate and keeping their eyes on the No-Return Pass, the Black Ink Giant Spirit Gods wouldn’t dare to act recklessly because that would only give Ah Da and Ah Er a chance to charge into the No-Return Pass and kill everyone.

“But the Giant Spirit Gods don’t have high intelligence, so we need someone there to communicate with them, telling them what they should and shouldn’t do and when they should and shouldn’t attack.”

Yang Kai pointed his thumb at himself, “Don’t tell me I’m the one to do it?”

Then, Mi Jing Lun looked at Yang Kai like he was a promising young man, “There is no one else who can do this besides you. No one else has interacted much with those two Giant Spirit Gods, so you’re the only one familiar with them. If they’ll listen to anyone, it will be you. Also, with your abilities, I’m sure the Black Ink Clan wouldn’t be able to do anything about you if they saw you guarding the Barren Territory with the two Giant Spirit Gods.”

After thinking about it, Yang Kai sighed and nodded, “Good. If that’s your arrangement, I’ll follow it.”

Even if he was ordered to guard the Barren Territory, it wouldn’t stop him from causing a commotion when the time came. Once the battle began, he could charge through the Territory Gate and kill his way into the No-Return Pass, joining the Human Race Army on the other side.

From that perspective alone, there really was no other person more suitable than him to guard the Barren Territory. Though the other Ninth-Order Masters were strong as well, they couldn’t move about as effortlessly as Yang Kai could.

Meanwhile, Mi Jing Lun immediately saw through Yang Kai’s thoughts and offered, “How about we split into two routes and arrange for some soldiers to assemble in the Barren Territory? Perhaps we can attack from both sides at a crucial moment.”

“That’s not necessary. Attacking through the Territory Gate into the No-Return Pass is quite problematic. If we have too many people there, we won’t be able to grasp the opportunity during the war, and there’s no use if we have too few people. Ah Da, Ah Er, and me working together should suffice.”

Mi Jing Lun also thought that was reasonable and nodded, “Let’s keep it that way for now.”

Later, Yang Kai chatted with Mi Jing Lun for a bit before leaving.

Before he left, he quickly examined Pure Yang Pass’ situation. Pure Yang Pass was constantly being worked on, and after the past few years, they had successfully repaired the Great Pass’ superstructure. The destroyed Arrays and artifacts needed to be replaced for Pure Yang Pass to be able to return to its full glory, but that would still require a lot of time and resources.

One of the reasons the Human Race needed 10 to 20 years before attacking the No-Return Pass was that they needed to finish repairing Pure Yang Pass.

An hour later, Yang Kai arrived at the Star Boundary.

On top of a Spirit Peak in High Heaven Palace was a huge square, and on that square stood several majestic buildings. These buildings were worn to differing degrees, while some were even heavily damaged, seemingly having experienced the ravages of war.

People were heading in and out of those Grand Halls, so the atmosphere in the square was very lively.

These buildings were Universe Temples that the Void Guard retrieved from the many Great Territories. During the three years Yang Kai was in retreat and comprehending the mysteries of the Grand Dao, the Void Guard had gathered around 1,000 Universe Temples here. Now that the Supreme Headquarters had distributed their share of resources and assistants, the Void Guard took the lead to start arranging Space Arrays using these Universe Temples as a base.

The more than 100 Void Guards had been swamped while the Array Masters and Artifact Refiners sent over were also working day and night without rest.

Although they had made some small successes, their progress was quite slow, which worried Li Wu Yi.

At this moment, inside one of the Grand Halls, Li Wu Yi led several Void Guards in discussing how to best set up the Arrays with a few Array Masters.

It was a serious topic, so they concentrated hard on the matter. Just as they were carefully outlining and carving a pattern and were about to succeed, they heard a voice saying, “That’s not right.”

In this silent Grand Hall, even the gentlest voice was like an exploding bomb, shocking everyone.

Like that, the almost-formed Array shattered, its lines cracking while the energy inserted inside blew up. A bright light flashed inside the hall, leaving everyone with a dusty face.

Li Wu Yi turned around and looked at Yang Kai with bloodshot eyes before gnashing his teeth, “You brat! You finally appeared!”

They had agreed beforehand that they would form the Void Guard to gather Universe Temples to be used to house Space Arrays so that the Army could use them as rapid transit points in the coming war.

Even though it seemed like Li Wu Yi was the leader here, it was actually Yang Kai who was in command; otherwise, the Void Guard wouldn’t have the word ‘Void’ in the name because that was Yang Kai’s title in the Star Boundary.

However…

“Three years! Do you know how I’ve spent these three years!?” Li Wu Yi roared viciously as he questioned Yang Kai’s act of forgetting about the Void Guard after dumping everything on him.

“Something unexpected happened…” Yang Kai coughed lightly into his fist.

He didn’t expect creating the Myriad Dao Sealed World would suddenly enlighten him, and he would spend three years in retreat.

“Anyway, I’m here now,” Yang Kai tried to change the topic.

“Smelly brat…” Li Wu Yi was so angry that he wanted to laugh.

Afterwards, Yang Kai held Li Wu Yi’s shoulder and whispered, “Don’t keep calling me brat. I’m a Ninth-Order Master now, as well as the Dao Lord of the Void Dao Temple. How do you expect the disciples to respect me if you call me that?”

Hearing that, Li Wu Yi couldn’t help but roll his eyes, but when he thought carefully about it, it did seem inappropriate because no matter whether he was Yang Kai’s Senior or not, Yang Kai was now a Ninth-Order Master, so he should get the respect he deserved.

Li Wu Yi’s actions just now were because he was pissed off. He originally had a nominal role in the Void Guard and didn’t need to worry about leading or organizing anything, but he suddenly became the one in charge after the Void Guard was formed.

Taking a step back, Li Wu Yi cupped his fist, “Greetings, Sir.”

He had a serious expression on his face as if nothing had happened just now.

The other disciples also cupped their fists and bowed, “Greetings, Dao Lord!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

“Sir, you said this is not right. Can Sir tell us what is the right way and perhaps show us an example?” Li Wu Yi acted like a student and respectfully asked.

While looking at him, Yang Kai felt his face twitch, but still replied, “Gather everyone over here and I’ll demonstrate.”

Several Dao Temple disciples were instantly excited. Though they were from the Void Dao Temple, they didn’t have many opportunities to interact with Yang Kai. Most of them only had the chance to see Yang Kai once when he brought them out of his Small Universe. Now that they heard that the Dao Lord was about to demonstrate a whole new type of Space Array, they naturally felt very excited. As such, they all swarmed out of the Grand Hall to gather their fellow Dao Temple disciples.
