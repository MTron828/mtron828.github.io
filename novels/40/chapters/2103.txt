“This is tricky, his Demon Qi can corrode even our Emperor Artifacts.” Chen Wen Hao took a look at his Flowing Water Sword and the Radiant Sun Mirror in Gao Xue Ting’s hand with a grave look on his face.

The Flowing Water Sword had also been covered by a layer of Black Qi like the Radiant Sun Mirror, and it had obviously been corroded.

Corrosion of this level wouldn’t damage an Emperor Artifact’s spirituality unless they didn’t get rid of it in time.

It wasn’t easy to craft an Emperor Artifact, and every Emperor Realm Master treasured them. So, how could they allow this?

“What a troublesome guy, it seems like we have to get serious.” Feng Ming sneered coldly.

Chen Wen Hao glared at Yang Kai, while speaking with Gao Xue Ting, “Junior Sister Gao, we’ll have to draw support from your power.”

Gao Xue Ting gnashed her teeth, as if she had just made a hard decision. She said, “If the Radiant Sun Mirror gets ruined, you’ll have to compensate me.”

Feng Ming laughed and said, “It’s still an Emperor Artifact and it won’t be destroyed so easily. Let’s not waste our breath. Hurry up and make a move. If we delay it any further, we may face some unforeseen circumstances.”

Gao Xue Ting raised her hands and the Radiant Sun Mirror flew into the air as if it wanted to break into the firmament and quickly overlapped with the sun in the sky. At this moment, she raised her hands upwards and started weaving hand seals.

The Radiant Sun Mirror let out a humming noise and a mysterious power started spreading from it, while the blazing sun in the sky suddenly let out a dazzling sunbeam and struck the mirror. That said sunbeam penetrated the mirror and its radiance spread to the surroundings.

“Radiant Sun Heavenly Territory, Nine Suns’ Radiant Shine!” Gao Xue Ting put her arms against her chest and pushed them forward slowly.

As the blazing radiance spread out, the region sealed by Yang Kai’s Space Principle power let out a crisp snapping noise, as if some force broke through its confines.

Soon after, an unusual phenomenon appeared. Nine radiant suns appeared in the sky and their light was nearly blinding. Those suns emitted scorching rays, which burned the earth and left it charred.

Yang Kai let out a loud shriek, as if he couldn’t stand the numerous blazing suns surrounding him, and he made a move right away.

He rushed toward a sun and thrust his fist at it.

*Rumble!*

The radiant sun up in the sky was shattered apart, but another sun emerged out in a different location right away.

But, Yang Kai still went in and destroyed another sun, as if he had already lost his reason, yet the same scene unfolded again, and all of his efforts turned out pointless.

...

“It’s useless, such attacks wouldn’t be of any use against Senior Gao’s Radiant Sun Heavenly Territory.”

In the Small Sealed World, it seemed like Hua Qing Si had already heard of the Radiant Sun Heavenly Territory, and upon seeing Yang Kai running around aimlessly, she shook her head slowly and took pleasure in his misfortune.

The Embodiment rolled his eyes around and asked, “What kinds of attacks would be useful against it?”

“It’s obviously attacking Senior Gao,” Hua Qing Si replied quickly and chuckled. “But, in the Radiant Sun Heavenly Territory, Senior Gao is omnipotent and the body shown by her is only a phantom image, while her true body is hiding somewhere else.”

“Is it?” The Embodiment curled the corners of his mouth and let out a meaningful laugh. “You really know a lot, as expected of a member of the Star Soul Palace.”

In response, Hua Qing Si laughed complacently.

If she wasn’t from a supreme faction of the Southern Territory, the Star Soul Palace, then how could a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator get any info about the mysteries of Gao Xue Ting’s Secret Technique?

...

While Yang Kai was crazily attacking the loathsome suns, a silhouette appeared suddenly next to him and condensed the power of his Sword Principle within his sword and thrust it slowly, yet carefully toward Yang Kai.

“Myriad Swords Dao!” Gao Xue Ting shouted in a low voice.

When he thrust his sword, even the nine suns in the sky lost their radiance, and only Chen Wen Hao’s sword was left here, a sword that was the fruit of his whole life’s cultivation.

As the sword’s light flickered, fresh blood spluttered and Demon Qi billowed, while Yang Kai let out a miserable shriek.

This sword strike had achieved its aim. It had penetrated Yang Kai’s belly and brought with it his golden blood.

Yang Kai stretched his dragon claw out of pain and held the Flowing Water Sword without any regard for the harm inflicted upon his palm by its sharp edge. As for his other hand, it turned into a giant palm that went after Chen Wen Hao to swat him down.

Chen Wen Hao’s pupils contracted and he was about to move back, yet he discovered in surprise that a peculiar Space Principle power descended upon him, and stranded him for a moment.

Yet this short moment was enough for Yang Kai’s palm to reach him.

“Location Swap!” Gao Xue Ting’s voice resounded out, as she folded her palms and pushed them forward. One of the suns in the sky replaced Chen Wen Hao’s and got shattered by the giant palm. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

As for Chen Wen Hao, his body appeared somewhere else in the vicinity. His face had already turned pale and he nodded at Gao Xue Ting to express his gratitude.

If Gao Xue Ting didn’t cast a Secret Technique to move him away, he would have been gravely injured.

“Didn’t you forget someone?” A voice suddenly resounded behind Yang Kai. While he was dealing with Chen Wen Hao, Feng Ming took advantage of this chance to close in on him with the Lightning Goose Spear in his hand. He condensed his Source Qi in his spear and thrust it forward.

“Flying Thunder Explosion!”

A large lighting ball appeared on the spearhead. This ball contained berserk lightning with great destructive power and it had suddenly exploded near Yang Kai.

Lightning ran amok, and silver serpentine lightning danced around, while the ground had been turned into a lightning field.

At this moment, the Demon Qi on Yang Kai’s back got thinned out and his white bones were exposed.

It seemed like this strike had inflicted great harm upon him!

But, Feng Ming still couldn’t rejoice over this, as Yang Kai had already turned around and thrust his palm at him.

“Are you looking down on me?” Upon seeing Yang Kai attacking him head-on, Feng Ming flew into a rage and thrust his spear. He launched another attack, yet he hit thin air this time.

The person in front of him had already disappeared!

Feng Ming’s heart tightened, and he pulled back his spear to retreat. His wariness was apparent on his face.

After all, he was fighting against a fearful being able to use Space Principle to manoeuvre and he didn’t dare to take him lightly.

Meanwhile, Feng Ming had also enveloped this region with his Divine Sense to seek Yang Kai’s trail.

Yet, at this moment, a delicate shout reverberated out.

In an empty region with no soul in sight, Gao Xue Ting’s body stumbled out, closely followed by the murderous-looking Yang Kai.

“How is this possible?” Astonishment was apparent on Gao Xue Ting’s face. She couldn’t believe that Yang Kai was able to accurately find her real body’s hiding spot within the Radiant Sun Heavenly Territory, and he still got to launch a sneak attack on her.

Upon looking at the black silhouette closing in on her, she felt death looming over, and she felt like she heard the Death God’s whispers.

“Boundless Sword Dao!” At this critical juncture, Chen Wen Hao rushed over with his Flowing Water Sword in hand. Boundless Sword Qi emanated from the sword and swept Yang Kai like a hurricane.

Yang Kai roared and the Demon Qi on his body surface billowed and formed numerous ethereal serpents, which collided against the Sword Qi.

*Sizzle!*

The Sword Qi was extinguished, while the ethereal serpents had also dispersed.

By the time Yang Kai’s body was revealed again, Gao Xue Ting had already moved back to Chen Wen Hao’s side. Her face was deathly pale and her clothes had already been soaked by sweat.

“Did this person retain his mind and wisdom?” Feng Ming’s eyes widened up and he asked in surprise.

A while ago, Yang Kai had used himself as bait to attract the crowd’s attention, while he closed in on Gao Xue Ting in silence to launch a sneak attack. A demon who had lost his mind couldn’t achieve this endeavour, and this was obviously a pretty intelligent battle tactic.

Even if he possessed the same power, he wouldn’t be able to do better.

“Perhaps.” Chen Wen Hao pulled back his sword and stood motionless with his hands behind his back. He looked like an unsheathed sword and he emitted an astonishing Sword Intent. He said, “Demon, I’ll let you have a taste of my sword.”

As his voice reverberated, he revealed his murderous intent and his Sword Qi ran amok. Chen Wen Hao used up his Source Qi without any restraints and displayed his exquisite sword technique. He condensed his power and Principle power in his sword and launched an attack.

When he had just made a move, Gao Xue Ting’s body disappeared once again from the Radiant Sun Heavenly Territory. But, the nine suns in the sky emitted intense radiance. They shot nine light pillars, which fell upon Yang Kai and sealed this region.

As for Feng Ming, he launched his best skill with the Lightning Gose Spear and targeted Yang Kai’s vital regions.

The three great Emperor Realm Masters attacked jointly to slay the demon and protect the human world!

Yang Kai could only roar loudly as usual and he dealt with them in the same way as before. As the Demon Qi on his body billowed, he launched various crude and simple moves. He was obviously in a disadvantageous position, but his enemies still weren’t able to slay him in a short while.

The Demon Crests on the surface of his body possessed extremely strong defensive power and even the three great Emperor Realm Masters’ various Secret Techniques and Emperor Artifacts’ attacks couldn’t break through his defence.

The region was wrecked apart and even the celestial bodies had lost their radiance here!

...

In the Small Sealed World, Hua Qing Si was left speechful for so long and her pretty eyes shivered lightly.

Getting to watch Emperor Realm Masters’ fight was a great opportunity for a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivator, yet usually, closing in on Emperor Realm Masters’ battlefield was pretty dangerous and ordinary cultivators wouldn’t get a chance to watch and observe it.

Yet, due to a series of coincidences, she got the chance to watch one from beginning to end.

She already didn’t wish for Yang Kai to die quickly, and she had gotten lost in her thoughts while watching the battle and a pensive look was apparent on her face

The Embodiment cast a glance at her and curled up his mouth. He didn’t disturb her, and turned his head again toward the battlefield and revealed a worried look.

Even though it looked like the main body had just gotten into a deadlock, he was only a First-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivator, and even if he drew help from the Demon Qi, he still couldn’t deal with three Emperor Realm Masters.

As time passed, the main body was only accumulating more injuries and this was clear proof of its terrible situation.

Actually, he didn’t really care about his injuries, the crux was that the main body didn’t escape despite knowing fully he wasn’t a match for them, and this was the source of the Embodiment’s worries.

The Embodiment wasn’t sure whether the main body retained his mind. He had tried to contact him, yet he didn’t get any response. But, when he told him stealthily the weakness of Gao Xue Ting’s Radiant Sun Heavenly Territory, the main body took notice of his advice.

If this wasn’t the case, the main body wouldn’t have sought and uncovered Gao Xue Ting’s hiding spot, then almost inflict heavy injuries upon her.

He had suddenly gotten great power, and it was still the evil and vicious power of an Ancient Great Demon. It wasn’t good news for the main body, if he kept using it for so long, then some unforeseen problems might befall him.
