Half an hour later, Yang Kai walked out of the secret room with Bian Yu Qing following closely behind him. The two Third-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters from Blizzard Sect had already told him everything they knew, and after cross-referencing the information they had revealed, Yang Kai did not find anything suspicious. So, questioning them anymore would be pointless.

“Sect Master, what should we deal with those forces?” Bian Yu Qing asked softly.

In order to survive, the two Blizzard Sect members had mentioned several forces, but they couldn’t be certain if these forces really had colluded with Heavenly Sword Union. Perhaps they were just speculating, or perhaps they were just spouting names in order to appear more useful.

As such, dealing with these forces was quite troublesome.

“Send a message to Governor Mo to keep an eye on them, and if there’s any sign of trouble,” Yang Kai paused for a moment before coldly continuing, “We’d rather kill and be wrong than let them off!”

Bian Yu Qing quickly responded, “Yes!”

She also knew that what Void Land lacked the most right now was time. As long as they had a little more time, the number of Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters they had would grow. When the battle broke out with Heavenly Sword Union, every Sixth-Order Master would be an indispensable force. So, concealing information right now was the top priority.

Otherwise, if Zuo Quan Hui found out about the situation here, he would definitely launch an all-out attack.

Last time, Zuo Quan Hui’s lineage alone had forced Void Land to send out all its top experts; so now, with Heavenly Sword Union’s help, if Void Land didn’t have more Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, it would be difficult to resist.

“What should we do with those two?” Bian Yu Qing asked again. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Detain them for now,” Yang Kai replied casually. He didn’t take the two Blizzard Sect members seriously, but since they wanted to make an enemy out of Void Land, he would not show any mercy. After the war here was settled, he would just throw them into the Black Territory. Luan Bai Feng would be more than happy to acquire more ore slaves.

After the order was passed down, the Star City also began to make arrangements. Sure enough, three days later, they caught another spy who wanted to leave Void Territory. After interrogating them and confirming that there was no mistake, they also detained them.

Yang Kai didn’t know how much longer Zuo Quan Hui could endure. He had led Heavenly Sword Union to seal off the Territory Gate for over three years now, which wasn’t necessary a long time, but it wasn’t short either. Theoretically, it was enough time for a newly established force to run out of supplies.

Void Land had only risen recently, so unlike the Cave Heavens and Paradises that possessed inheritances that spanned countless centuries, it did not have a rich stockpile of resources. Now, even the Star City income had been cut off, so the only reason it was able to persist until now was because of the benefits brought about by the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill.

From Zuo Quan Hui’s perspective, he was in an invincible position. As long as he waited patiently, Void Land would one day be unable to hold back and rush out to seek a way out. At that time, he would be able to deal a heavy blow to Void Land!

However, there was always a limit to his patience, and it was impossible to completely seal off news from Void Land. Although Yang Kai didn’t need to worry too much about the Star City, there were still many people hidden in Void Territory who were observing Void Land.

Once the Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array was activated frequently, it would definitely arouse Zuo Quan Hui’s vigilance and at that time, he would definitely try to probe the situation.

As such, Yang Kai felt that Void Land would at most be safe for another year or so.

But a year was enough!

Three months later, Bustling World Great Emperor broke through to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, and quite smoothly at that.

Another month later, Martial Beast Great Emperor also did so, which came as no surprise!

In another two months, Fang Yue, and Xiang Ying both broke through, not facing too much danger.

Immediately after Fang Yue and Xiang Ying, Flower Shadow and Ice Feather Great Emperors broke through!

At this point, the number of Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in Void Land had reached 16, not including Luan Bai Feng in Heavenly Sword Union or Lan You Ruo who was in secluded retreat.

Although 7 of these 16 had just advanced to the Open Heaven Realm and were unable to display their full strength for a short period of time due to the instability of their cultivation, they were still in the Sixth-Order Masters. As the saying went, a starving camel was still bigger than a horse.

In addition, there were more than 100 cultivators who had advanced below the Sixth-Order in Void Land during this time. It could be said that a wave of advancement to the Open Heaven Realm had been set off.

Just as Yang Kai had expected, the frequent activation of the Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array had alerted Zuo Quan Hui. After the enemy scouts hiding in Void Territory sent word back, the peace that had been maintained for several years was finally broken.

“Sect Master, a large number of ships suddenly appeared from Flying Smoke Territory’s Territory Gate leading to Void Territory. They were confirmed to be from Heavenly Sword Union, and Mountain Lord Mao, who was watching over things there, engaged in a brief clash with the enemy.”

On Dragon Son’s Peak, Yang Kai was examining Zhu Qing’s condition when Bian Yu Qing suddenly rushed over and anxiously reported.

Yang Kai turned his head and asked, “How is the situation?”

After returning from the Black Territory to Void Territory that day, Yang Kai had Mao Zhe, Geng Qing, and Zhou Ya lead a group of Open Heaven Realm Masters to guard the Territory Gate. On one hand, it was to block spies from leaving towards Flying Smoke Territory, while on the other hand, it was to monitor the situation of Heavenly Sword Union.

Over the past few years, Heavenly Sword Union had made quite a few attempts to check the situation in Void Territory, but all of them had been easily resolved by Mao Zhe and the others. Since Zuo Quan Hui had decided to starve Void Land to death, he naturally wouldn’t start a war so easily before the time was right.

This time, the situation was clearly different from the previous small-scale investigations.

Bian Yu Qing shook her head and replied, “The situation is serious but not critical. Heavenly Sword Union sent several Sixth-Order Masters, forcing Mountain Lord Mao and the others to retreat. The Territory Gate fell into Heavenly Sword Union’s hands.”

“Is everyone alright?” Yang Kai asked with concern. Although Void Land was now filled with powerful forces, every Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was a rare and needed talent.

“A few low-order Open Heaven Realm Masters lost their lives in the clash, but not many. The other party seemed to only be probing the region, so Mountain Lord Mao and the others were able to retreat safely.”

Yang Kai fell silent for a moment before commenting in a mournful tone, “In a battle between two armies, injuries and deaths are inevitable.”

When the Star Boundary united to fight against the Demon Realm, millions of cultivators and billions of innocents lost their lives. The entire Star Boundary had been plunged into misery and suffering during that time. Now that they were fighting against Heavenly Sword Union, Yang Kai was naturally prepared for such losses.

“Did Zuo Quan Hui show up?” Yang Kai asked again.

Bian Yu Qing slowly shook her head and rejoiced, “If he showed up personally, Mountain Lord Mao and the others would definitely not have remained unharmed.”

Although Mao Zhe and the other two were veteran Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, they were definitely not Zuo Quan Hui’s match even if they were to fight together. Last time, they had been able to defend against Zuo Quan Hui because Yang Kai had been the one to bear most of the pressure.

“Coward!” Yang Kai sneered.

Zuo Quan Hui was obviously afraid of the Divine Spirits of Void Land, so he didn’t dare show his face easily; however, this was also in line with Yang Kai’s intentions. From this point alone, even if Zhu Jiu Yin didn’t actively participate in the war, she would still be a great deterrent.

“Sect Master,” Bian Yu Qing’s voice was somewhat hoarse, “Is the war about to begin?”

Although she was mentally prepared, when this day really came, Bian Yu Qing couldn’t help but be nervous.

As someone from the Star Boundary, she had never forgotten how tragic the Two Worlds Great War had been.

“It is!” Yang Kai took a deep breath and turned his head, “Senior, I’ll have to trouble you to look after Void Land and the Star City.”

Nodding, Bi Xi replied, “Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of these two places for you. If you can’t defeat the enemy, just come back. With this Old Master here, they won’t dare act rashly.”

“Many thanks, Senior!” Yang Kai expressed his gratitude before turning to Zhu Qing.

But before he could say anything, Zhu Qing stepped forward and stated, “I’ll go with you.”

Yang Kai flatly refused, “No!”

Zhu Qing’s bloodline had improved dramatically as a result of her Dragon Vein being greatly purified and condensed, allowing her to transform into a 3,000 to 4,000 meters long Dragon. However, when Yang Kai checked her strength, she was only able to display the might of someone around the Third or Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

A true Grand Dragon was said to be at least 10,000 meters long, so although Zhu Qing’s transformation this time had greatly increased her strength, there was still a big gap between her and a true powerhouse. It was likely that she would need to undergo another great transformation before she could truly become a Grand Dragon!

On the other hand, in a battle between two armies, the situation was chaotic, and a Third or Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master could die at any moment. How could Yang Kai allow her to enter the battlefield?

Zhu Qing looked at him quietly, “I am the Wife of Void Land’s Lord. If I didn’t have the ability to participate, it would have been fine, but now that I have the necessary strength, if I still have to hide in the rear, what will others think? If those disciples who are desperately bleeding and dying for Void Land came to know about it, what would they think? They will definitely think that I’m a turtle!”

To the side, Bi Xi couldn’t help but shrink his neck… he wanted to say something, but decided to hold back.

Zhu Qing continued, “All these years, we Sisters have been cultivating hard, but have never been able to help you much when you were out roaming the world. Now that I have this opportunity, I want to do something! We can’t live under your wings forever, always allowing you to shield us from the wind and storms. Big Sister and the others must be thinking the same and working hard for this goal.”

Yang Kai had a belly full of words but he couldn’t say them. Even though he was still reluctant, his heart was filled with warmth.

“In any case, if I want to go, even if you don’t allow me to, I’ll go myself unless you lock me up,” Zhu Qing proclaimed angrily.

Yang Kai stared at her for a moment before suddenly smiling and nodding, “If you want to go, you can go!”

Zhu Qing stared at Yang Kai in shock, “You’re not lying?” She hadn’t expected Yang Kai to agree to her request so easily.

“I’m not lying!” Yang Kai replied seriously before turning to look at the old man, “Senior, please take care!”

Saying so, he wrapped his arm around Zhu Qing’s waist and flew off.

A moment later, numerous large and small ships flew out from Void Land, transforming into streaks of light as they headed towards the Territory Gate.

Void Territory was vast, so it would take at least ten days to half a month to reach the Territory Gate. If Yang Kai was alone, it wouldn’t have taken him so long, but now that there were a lot of Open Heaven Realm Masters from Void Land accompanying him, their speed was naturally slower.

Inside a room aboard the Falling Lotus, Zhu Qing was lying on the bed, her clothes in disarray and her hair disheveled as she was sweating profusely. Lifting her head, she rebuked with great difficulty, “Aren’t we going to war? If others find out… what will we do?”

Yang Kai grinned and replied, “It will take some time to get there, so we can’t waste time. Senior said that I can help you purify your bloodline, and with each transformation, your strength will grow, so I must work hard!”

Zhu Qing was already in a daze, unable to speak, her entire body glowing with a faint red light.

Yang Kai suddenly felt a little annoyed, “If I had known this would happen, I would have worked much harder and not wasted so much time before.”
