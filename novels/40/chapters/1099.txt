Chapter 1099, Wu Yi’s Anger

The Starship broke through the cloud layer of Shadowed Star and descended slowly to a large landing square.

At the square, someone who had already received word of their return was waiting to receive them, and when Wu Yi saw who this figure out the Starship’s window, she couldn’t help waving both her hands and calling out happily, “It’s Uncle Hao An!”

Yu Feng also grinned broadly, “Our trip is also considered an important task. Senior Hao An will naturally come out to meet us in person. Young Lady, after we get back, we’ll be properly rewarded, right?”

“All you think about is your reward!” Wu Yi rolled her eyes before laughing lightly, “Rest assured, the ore we mined this time is quite precious, there’ll definitely be enough compensation.”

Hearing her say this, the cultivator gathered nearby immediately cheered.

With a dull thud, the Starship landed and the hatch slowly opened. With Wu Yi at the head, and Chang Qi following close behind, a large crowd filed out with their heads held his, like soldiers returning in triumph from the battlefield, bringing honour and glory with them.

The old man named Hao An greeted them quickly while a number of cultivators from the Hai Ke Family who were standing behind him also approached and saluted, “Many thanks for Young Lady’s hard work!”

“It is what I should do, Uncle Hao An is too polite,” Wu Yi smiled.

“This old man can finally rest easy knowing Young Lady has returned safely,” Hao An declared with a look of lingering worry. Everyone understood just how dangerous it was to navigate the Star Field aboard a Starship. Wu Yi’s trip this time had lasted longer than a year, and many people who cared for her safety had not slept well since she left; Hao An was one among them and enthusiastically greeted, “Young Lady, please come back to the family, Patriarch and the other Elders are very worried about you, I’m sure they will be happy to know you’ve returned safe and sound.”

Wu Yi smiled but shook her head lightly, “There’s no rush, and we’ll first unload the ore from the Starship before heading back.”

Hearing this, Hao An’s face froze up, but he quickly fixed his expression and put on a strong smile, “Such matters do not need the Young Lady to handle personally, someone will naturally process it.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Wu Yi stood for a moment before nodding, “Fine.”

Saying so, she shouted to the crowd behind her, “You lot stay here and help transport the ore back.”

“Yes!” Yu Feng and the others shouted loudly.

“No need, we’ll take care of it ourselves,” A voice suddenly called out, and the moment Wu Yi heard who it was, her smile disappeared and was replaced with a strong look of disgust, her beautiful eyes glancing over towards the side.

From the direction of the sound, Wu Yi spotted a group of cultivators rushing over towards them headed by a young man of short stature. This young man was impishly short, his head only reaching partway up Yang Kai’s chest, but although he was short, he took highly exaggerated steps and threw out his chest like he was a mighty expert, the smug look on his face fully illustrating his undisguised disdain for those around him.

“Xie Hong Wen?” Wu Yi’s eyes narrowed dangerously as she angrily shouted, “Why are you here?”

“Why can’t I be here?” The young man named Xie Hong Wen grinned meaningfully, “Although this is your Hai Ke Family’s land, it can also be regarded as my Shadow Moon Hall’s territory, if I want to walk here that is my business. En, Little Sister Wu Yi must have worked hard this time, I heard you even went deep into the Star Field, you must have collected a lot of rare ores.”

“What does that have to do with you?” Wu Yi immediately became vigilant.

“What doesn’t it have to do with me?” Xie Hong Wen laughed before pointing towards the Starship, “The ore inside this thing is now the property of my Shadow Moon Hall, didn’t anyone tell you?”

Wu Yi’s face paled, and Yu Feng and the others also fumed with anger.

Wu Yi turned her head towards Hao An, expecting him to give her an explanation. Hao An met her gaze with a guilty look and only after a long silence let out a long sigh, “Young Lady, let us first return, the Patriarch will give you an explanation.”

“An explanation?” Wu Yi sneered, immediately understanding what was happening here, her blood running cold as she icily spat, “In order to collect these ores, we set out with more than a hundred people, but only half of us were able to return. Do you know what kind of dangers we encountered? Do they how many waves of Black Rock Beasts we had to fend off? Do you know we were almost wiped out and unable to return? Who do you think we went out to collect these ores for? Now we return home with a full load and you want to tell us we can’t even enjoy the fruits of our labour? What kind of explanation do you plan on giving us?”

This series of questions made Hao An close his mouth tightly, the shame on his face only growing thicker, as if he couldn’t wait to find a hole to crawl into and disappear.

Not only was Wu Yi incredibly anger, her tender body trembling with rage, the fifty or so cultivators behind her were also spewing murderous intent as all their eyes stared menacingly towards Xie Hong Wen, their strength secretly condensing.

Xie Hong Wen remained motionless though, his disgusting smile still plastered all over his face as he looked provocatively at Yu Feng and the others, as if he couldn’t wait for them to attack and make the situation even bigger.

“Young Lady, this is the family’s decision!” Hao An finally managed to put out a few words while turning an imploring look towards Wu Yi and all but begging, “Please take the bigger picture into consideration, Young Lady!”

Wu Yi was not a little girl who didn’t understand propriety. She knew that the family had made such a decision because it was powerless to do otherwise and that if she remaining unyielding here, it would only bring greater disaster to her and the people behind her. Her delicate hands balling up into tight fists, the anger on her face gave way to helplessness as she let out a heavy sigh, “I understand.”

“Young Lady!” Yu Feng called out loudly and seemed to want to say something more.

“Enough! Your rewards won’t be short, even if the family can’t provide it, I will find a way to compensate you!” Wu Yi gave him a stern glance.

Tears began dripping from Yu Feng’s eyes as he lowered his head.

Xie Hong Wen clapped his hands lightly, sarcastically giving his approval of this show as he let out a laugh, “I heard that Little Sister Wu Yi possesses a noble spirit, en I’ve certainly see so today, truly deserving of your reputation, having so many unruly men act so obediently to you, Big Brother here is impressed!”

“Who is your Little Sister? Who is my Brother?” Wu Yi glared at him in disgust, “Xie Hong Wen, I’ll tell you now, this Starship’s ore is soaked with the blood of my Hai Ke Family’s clansmen, it was mined with our very lives, I hope you won’t have nightmares after being haunted by the grieving dead after seizing this from us!”

Xie Hong Wen’s face went cold for a moment but his smile soon returned, “Wu Yi, I know you’re dissatisfied, but what of it? If you want to blame someone, blame your family for being so weak, en, one day though your surname will be Xie and you will be this Xie’s woman, just wait and see.”

Saying so, he let out a peal of even more dissolute laughter and waved his hand, “Whoever dares to stop us from taking this ore, kill without mercy!”

The cultivators behind Xie Hony Wen immediately put on aggressive looks as they rushed into the Starship.

“Return!” Wu Yi didn’t want to stay and see this ugly display, and a deep coldness filled her pretty face as she led the several dozen cultivators behind her away.

After over a year of hard work, travelling deep into the Star Field to mine this ore, it had actually fallen into another’s hands the moment they returned to Shadowed Star; this was nothing less than torture for everyone present.

The mood of Wu Yi’s team was completely depressed, but Yang Kai could clearly see that all of their eyes were red with madness. He believed that as long as Wu Yi gave the order, all of them would not hesitate to attack Xie Hong Wen in order to defend their precious cargo.

Yang Kai had originally planned to part ways with Wu Yi as soon as they arrived on Shadowed Star, but leaving right now really wouldn’t be appropriate, so with no other choice, he simply followed along with the others.

After thinking about it for a moment, Yang Kai whispered to Yu Feng, “Does that Xie Hong Wen have some kind of grudge with your Young Lady?”

Yu Feng’s anger had not subsided yet, and when he heard these words he couldn’t help shooting Yang Kai a glare before shaking his head, “There’s no enmity between them, it’s just that he wanted to marry the Young Lady a few years ago, but was rejected by her. After that, he became angry out of shame and began oppressing our family at every chance he could.”

“Is that guy so strong?”

“He is nothing!” Yu Feng spat disdainfully, “Without the protection of Shadow Moon Hall, I can kill him instantly! But his father is an important figure in Shadow Moon Hall, so he can act unscrupulously! My Hai Ke Family is just a minor attached force of Shadow Moon Hall, so no matter how he bullies us, no one will try to uphold justice... Brat, you’re a bit too curious about this, aren’t you? Let me warn you, don’t even think about trying to take Wu Yi from me otherwise I’ll beat you bad enough your mother won’t recognize you! “

Yang Kai gawked for a moment before smirking, “Rest assured, I won’t steal her from you, en, I already have many women.”

Yu Feng’s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets as he stared in shock towards Yang Kai, glancing over him as he asked, “Is that true? With just your pitiful strength, how many women could you have? What do you use to protect them?”

Yang Kai shrugged and didn’t say any more.

Yu Feng seemed to have discovered something of great importance and immediately rushed over to Wu Yi’s side, acting mysterious as he whispered something to her.

After a moment, Wu Yi looked back at Yang Kai, his brow furrowed slightly as a look of disbelief spread across her face.

Yang Kai’s face turned black, knowing that Yu Feng was trying to smear him, but after hearing this strange anecdote, Wu Yi’s mood seemed to improve slightly and her tight expression gradually relaxed, a slight smile even reaching her lips.

The Hai Ke Family’s manor was not far from the square where the Starship had landed, only about fifty kilometres away, so after a short while, the crowd had arrived.

Wu Yi, Hao An, and Chang Qi naturally separated from the group to report to the other Elders of the family while at the same time ask them to give her an explanation. Everyone else also dispersed into the manor and soon disappeared.

A moment later, only Yu Feng and Yang Kai remained.

Yu Feng scratched his head and muttered, “En, Young Lady told me to entertain you well, but after thinking it over, I don’t know what to do, I’ve never had any experience in this area!”

Yang Kai laughed dumbly and waved his hand, “You can go about your own business, and I’ll just take a stroll around.”

“Do as you like, Father here also happens to have something to do. En, don’t go to the local village, that’s the place where the family lives, you can stroll around anywhere else. If you get bored, you can go check out Tian Yun City, it’s about two hundred kilometres in that direction.”

“Sure,” Yang Kai nodded.
