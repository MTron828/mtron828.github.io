Chapter 107 - Sneak attack

Translator - Erza

Editor - Ben

At this moment, Kai Yang also started to make his move. Currently, all of disciple Xie’s attention was occupied by the Nine Yin Dew Crystals, so it was the perfect opportunity for him to mount a sneak attack.

Even in his dreams, disciple Xie would never have thought that Kai Yang would be able to find his position and dare to mount a sneak attack on him.

On disciple Xie’s face was an extremely greedy expression, his body was nimble and his movement silent like a cat. Slowly, he crept up closer to the Nine Yin Dew Crystals. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

With the distance slowly becoming smaller and smaller, twenty feet, ten feet, nine feet......

The Nine Yin Dew Crystals continued to stay in their position, continuously absorbing the Qi in the valley and raising gusts of strong wind.

When the distance between disciple Xie and the Nine Yin Dew Crystals was only five feet, his World Qi exploded and surrounded him. Then leaping out like a cheetah, with his eyes a blaze, he reached out to grab at the Nine Yin Dew Crystals.

At that time, Kai Yang also made his move. With his eyes fixed on disciple Xie, Kai Yang’s feet carried him swiftly out like the wind. Clutching the newly acquired blade in his hand, he prepared to strike a killing blow when his opponent’s defences were at their lowest.

Just when disciple Xie thought he had obtained it, the Nine Yin Dew Crystals suddenly stopped absorbing Qi. Then from within its core, it burst out waves of cold Yin energy that started to attack disciple Xie.

All of this happened far too quickly. So quickly that he couldn’t even stop.

Great astonishment showed on disciple Xie’s face! Previously, he could tell that this was a heavenly treasure, but he could never have predicted this thing had spirit awareness and could counterattack at the most critical of times.

Disciple Xie’s mind was currently a mess. When facing this sudden cold attack, his mind and body were scared beyond belief as he spurred his World Qi to protect him from the incoming attack.

Just as he finished his preparations to take that strike, the Nine Yin Dew Crystals flashed and the attack vanished without a trace.

In the moment it flashed, the brightness in the surrounding area also vanished and dimmed.

With the sudden loss of light, disciple Xie’s eyesight was greatly impacted and he was unable to see any changes in the surrounding area. And it was in that split moment that Kai Yang acted.

Even though Kai Yang’s sight had also been affected, he could make could out the approximate position of his enemy. Even if that blade couldn’t take a life, it was guaranteed to make his life uncomfortable.

All of disciple Xie’s attention was focused on the cold, so how could he spare any attention on the incoming deathblade?

In the next instant, disciple Xie’s entire body flashed. Attacked by the cold, his entire body was like an ice block as he furiously revolved his World Qi; he unconsciously shivered. Before he could even take a breath, he felt a piercing pain from his waist; it was like something had stabbed him.

Disciple Xie’s battle experience was plentiful, after all he was a separation and reunion boundary cultivator. Although his view was partially blocked, he still instinctively kicked towards Kai Yang’s location.

With a muffled grunt, Kai Yang was hit and flew backwards.

Both people started to pant really hard. Now, there was no longer a need for Kai Yang to hide anymore.

With his eyesight gradually returning, disciple Xie looked poisonously at Kai Yang, meanwhile his body shook unconsciously and his hand clasped the wound he had received.

The blade had penetrated quite deeply into his side. Just then, Kai Yang used all of his strength to make the stab. And because disciple Xie had to use a fair amount of World Qi to defend against the cold, how could he spare any defences to block that stab?

“It’s you!” After confirming Kai Yang’s identity, disciple Xie’s face momentarily lit up. Just then, various possibilities had run through his mind. One possibility was that either Yuan Lang or junior brother Wu had mounted a sneak attack. Eliminating him when they had the chance; fellow disciples killing each other was quite normal after all. Another possibility was that that female had attacked him with the intention to kill. Or another unlikely possibility was that within this mountain valley, there was another group of people.

But no matter what, he would have never thought that the attacker was actually someone they had determined to be a sheep on the cutting board; Kai Yang.

“He he!” Slowly rising, Kai Yang smiled maliciously and stretched arm which had taken the kick. After confirming that nothing big had happened, he began to walk fearlessly, step by step, over. The present disciple Xie was a crossbow at the ends of its rope.

“How could it be.......” Disciple Xie’s face quickly paled.

“Although I don’t know what you are flabbergasted about, I presume that this situation differs greatly from what you anticipated.” Kai Yang replied, laughing coldly.

“We......” Lowering his head to look down, disciple Xie’s face revealed his surprise: “This is junior brother Wu’s sword.”

“That’s right. He is already dead. Now it’s your turn!”

“Turns out we had all been fooled by you!” With this realisation, an intense sense of humiliation and unwillingness burst out from disciple Xie’s heart.

When senior brother Cai had died under Kai Yang’s hands, they could still say it was due to the secret artifact’s might. But now, he himself would die under Kai Yang’s hand.

Your father is a separation and reunion boundary practitioner! Now, he would actually be killed by a practitioner at the initial element stage. What logic is this? Stifling, this was extremely stifling.

Crying out ‘Wa’, an arrow of blood streamed out from disciple Xie’s mouth, he was depressed to the limit. The wound on his body, the mental humiliation, combined they had made him haggard and he was left with no chance to redeem himself.

“I don’t have any grudges or enmities with you, but since you came knocking, then don’t blame me for being ruthless!” His face cold, Kai Yang walked up and struck out.

Disciple Xie was like the final radiance from a dying sun, his eyes glittering many times brighter. Forcibly extracting the blade from his side, he used it to slice towards Kai Yang.

Crouching down, Kai Yang sent out a hook punch to disciple Xie’s chin, crushing it to pieces. Flying backwards from the momentum, he then proceeded to smash heavily into the earth.

Not allowing him any more chances to resist, Kai Yang followed up with two more punches containing his World Qi, leaving disciple Xie completely at his mercy.

Standing back, he sneered: “You want to play with crafty plots and machinations, well I am your grandfather!”

His eyes clear, disciple Xie wanted to appear weak and helpless before dealing the killing blow to Kai Yang.

But Kai Yang had long been prepared for it. Even rabbits will lash out when cornered, let alone a martial practitioner. Before the enemy was completely dead, any mistakes and the lowering of one’s guard would result in death.

After killing him, Kai Yang searched around for anything useful. Unfortunately there wasn’t much, only two more bottles of pills and some money.

These people were still on an outing, so they wouldn’t bring too many things.

Those pills were useful for him and the money too. Without any shame or guilt, he shoved them into his pockets.

In the same manner as before, he hid the corpse in a large nearby tree before looking around. To his surprise the Nine Yin Dew Crystals had long since vanished without any trace.

Previously, when the Nine Yin Dew Crystals burst out in its brilliance, Kai Yang could feel the energy quite clearly; that energy was a very domineering energy. No wonder they needed him to come and help subdue it. That object’s spirit awareness was quite high, and when danger arose it would immediately flee. Apart from Yang attributed energy, there wouldn’t be anything else that would be useful in countering it.

There was still about two hours left until the sun rose! He must hasten his speed, but before that, he must return and ask Xia Ning Chang on how to subdue the Nine Yin Dew Crystals.

p.s. 1/3 of last week. I was sick and had to study for a test today. This test has also told me that extension 1 maths was NOT a good choice.... -_- The second chapter has also been released. Final will come tomorrow, because my body’s too sore all over; muscles are all aching.
