When one’s cultivation reached the Third-Order Origin King Realm, an Origin Essence Crystal would be condensed in their body. An Origin Essence Crystal contained the life experiences of an Origin King as well as the accumulation of their insights into the Martial Dao. Even if such a cultivator died, their Origin Essence Crystal would not disappear.

The Ancestral Founder of Ice Heart Valley left Profound Frost at the bottom of the Heavenly Blessings Frozen Pond, but her Origin Essence Crystal was nowhere to be seen, which was enough to raise many suspicions.

She might really still be alive!

Even if this was the case, no one had seen her for over ten thousand years, so there was no way to tell for certain if Ancestral Founder Bing Yun was alive or dead.

This was undoubtedly extremely exciting news for Luo Li nonetheless.

Luo Li turned to look at Yang Kai once more and sighed slightly.

She discovered that if Yang Kai were a disciple of Ice Heart Valley, he would surely bring them a great fortune!

Since his appearance in Ice Heart Valley, there had been too many happy events for them. First, Chi Huo was killed, second, her injuries had been healed, now Profound Frost had reappeared in this world, and if what Su Yan had seen was any indication, there was a chance Ice Heart Valley’s Ancestral Founder may still be alive somewhere in this universe...

This series of events were all excellent news for Ice Heart Valley.

Unfortunately, Yang Kai was a man, so he couldn’t join Ice Heart Valley, not to mention he did not hold a very good impression of them in the first place.

“Senior, it’s time we go to Brilliant Flame Sect,” Yang Kai suddenly said.

“En,” Luo Li nodded when she heard these words, “It is indeed time.”

Turning her gaze towards the distance, a strong light flashed across her eyes.

From now on, Scarlet Wave Star would be dominated by Ice Heart Valley!

.....

A fleet of five Starships took off from Pure Ice Island a few days later. These five Starships carried a total of three thousand Ice Heart Valley elites as they sailed towards Brilliant Flame Mountain Range.

Ice Heart Valley was one of the top two Sects on Scarlet Wave Star, so it had its own Starships.

However, Yang Kai could tell that there was only one Origin Grade High-Rank Starship, which served as a flagship of sorts, while the other four were only Origin Grade Mid-Rank.

The quality was incomparable to the one he possessed.

Evidently, Origin King Grade Starships were extremely rare even when the entire Star Field was taken into consideration.

To lay siege to Brilliant Flame Sect and thoroughly destroy it, Luo Li chose to use these Starships, as they were powerful mobile fortresses.

The disciples of Ice Heart Valley also knew the purpose of this expedition, so all of them wore solemn and fierce expressions.

Countless years of conflict made the feud between Ice Heart Valley and Brilliant Flame Sect incredibly deep, unable to be resolved in any other way than total victory. Many of these disciples had seen their Senior and Junior Sisters die tragically at the hands of Brilliant Flame Sect cultivators, and because they were all women, once one of them was captured alive, their fate would be worse than death.

Knowing that their Supreme Elder was personally leading a crusade against Brilliant Flame Sect, these three thousand elites immediately took the initiative to volunteer. All of them enthusiastically participated in this war and could not wait to charge into Brilliant Flame Mountain Range to destroy their hated enemy once and for all.

The fleet moved extremely fast, and although Ice Heart Valley was several million kilometres from Brilliant Flame Sect, it only took a few days for the five Starships to arrive outside Brilliant Flame Mountain Range.

At the head of the flagship, Luo Li stood looking into the distance as a group of high-level Ice Heart Valley Elders stood behind her.

Yang Kai and Su Yan were also present amongst this group.

“This is Brilliant Flame Mountain Range?” Yang Kai looked around with some admiration.

This mountain range looked like a long dragon laying on the ground that stretched on and on for tens of thousands of kilometres.

More importantly, this entire mountain range possessed a rich Fire Attribute aura, a faint red-light halo seemingly surrounding the mountains themselves.

Even the ambient temperature here was quite warm. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“En, this is Brilliant Flame Mountain Range. There is a giant Fire Dragon Earth Vein buried beneath this place which matches perfectly with Brilliant Flame Sect’s Secret Arts, allowing its disciples to cultivate very rapidly in this environment,” Bing Long explained softly to Yang Kai.

“Hmph, starting today, there will be no more Brilliant Flame Sect here,” Ran Yun Ting coldly snorted.

As soon as she spoke these words, she suddenly seemed to sense something, turned her gaze towards a certain spot, and stretched out her hand to grasp towards the void.

Accompanied by a panicked shout, a cultivator wearing Brilliant Flame Sect robes was dragged up and thrown onto the deck of the ship by Ran Yun Ting from the forest down below.

This person appeared middle-aged and did not have an extremely high cultivation, only First-Order Origin Returning Realm. His Fire Attribute Saint Qi was easily suppressed by Ran Yun Ting and after falling on the ship, seeing such a variety of beauties, he couldn’t help gulping as he immediately understood what his situation was and shouted, “Ice Heart Valley, why have you appeared here? So aggressively invading my Brilliant Flame Mountain Range, are you planning to start a war with my Brilliant Flame Sect?”

“Start a war?” Ran Yun Ting sneered, “Since when has my Ice Heart Valley and your Brilliant Flame Sect been at peace?”

The cultivator’s expression stagnated as he became speechless.

Indeed, the two great forces that dominated Scarlet Wave Star had never once called a truce. Small conflicts continued to happen without end, but a blatant full-scale invasion like this had never occurred before.

“What are your intentions here?” The Brilliant Flame Sect cultivator apparently had some backbone so even though he was facing so many masters whose strength far exceeded his own, he was still able to ask questions clearly.

“What are our intentions?” Ran Yun Ting sneered, “Naturally we’re here to trample your Brilliant Flame Sect flat!”

This cultivator turned pale as he stared at Ran Yun Ting with wide eyes, seemingly trying to tell if she was telling the truth or just bluffing.

“Your cultivation isn’t bad, and it seems your status in Brilliant Flame Sect isn’t low. Fine, scram back to your Sect and tell Wei Qing to wash his neck and wait for me, Ran Yun Ting, to claim his head.”

“Ran Yun Ting!?” The cultivator cried out in terror.

He naturally knew who Ice Heart Valley’s Great Elder was and what her reputation was like. Turning his head around, he quickly discovered that every woman here had a cultivation which far surpassed his own and could only shout out instinctually, “My Brilliant Flame Sect’s Supreme Elder will not let this pass!”

“You mean that old monster Chi Huo?” Ran Yun Ting sneered, “Don’t you know? Chi Huo is already dead.”

“Supreme Elder is dead?” The man’s eyes bulged as he parroted hoarsely, “Impossible, Supreme Elder is an Origin King, who among you has the ability to kill him?”

“Is that so? Go ask Wei Qing yourself then, this Elder has no time to talk nonsense with you!” Ran Yun Ting stopped talking, reached out, and tossed the hapless man off the Starship.

Regaining his balance mid-air, the cultivator hurriedly flew off while occasionally glancing back at the five imposing Starships behind him, pushing his Saint Qi to its limits so he could report this news to the Sect’s leaders as quickly as possible.

“En, sending a warning ahead is only proper. Allowing them some time to prepare will prevent them from slandering this Luo Li as someone who bullies the weak,” Luo Li, who hadn’t been paying attention to the previous situation, simply said lightly as the Brilliant Flame Sect cultivator disappeared from sight.

The fleet continued to move forward at a pace neither swift nor slow; however, the invisible and terrifying pressure quickly began spreading across Brilliant Flame Mountain Range from their presence.

A stick of incense worth of time later, chaos erupted inside Brilliant Flame Sect’s headquarters.

“Ice Heart Valley is actually attacking?”

“How dare they!”

“It seems that the lessons they have received this past year weren’t enough. Haha, good, since they’ve come of their own accord, we can teach them again, ruthlessly.”

“I heard that all of Ice Heart Valley’s top Elders are country toppling beauties, but there has never been an opportunity to capture one of them before. Now that they’ve delivered themselves to our door, this old master can snatch a few of them and train them well.”

“Elder Qi, at your age, you’re still interested in such pursuits?”

“Hmph, this old master’s prowess only grows stronger with age, why wouldn’t he be able to satisfy a few cheap sluts?”

“En, those sluts will definitely submit to Elder Qi’s might.”

A group of Elders all boasted and blustered heartily, not feeling at all anxious after hearing that Ice Heart Valley was attacking and instead feeling quite excited. Thinking of the screams they would pull from these tender women before they died or when they were devastating them put all the Elders into high spirits.

Ravaging a pure and innocent beauty, especially one that was unwilling, had always provoked the bestial instincts of men.

And the women of Ice Heart Valley were undoubtedly the purest of them all.

“Sect Master, please order us into battle immediately, we need to meet them head-on!” Many of the Elders called out to Wei Qing, who was sitting at the head of the hall.

However, when Wei Qing heard all these cries, all he could do was sweep his eyes around as a deep anxiety covered his face.

“Sect Master, you...” Wei Qing’s demeanour made many Elders furrow their brows and the noise inside the hall gradually subsided as everyone turned to him suspiciously.

“Catastrophe has come to Brilliant Flame Sect!” Wei Qing sighed.

The expressions of all the Elders changed when they heard these words.

“Sect Master, what do you mean?” One of the Elders who had spoken before wore a solemn expression and asked, “Ice Heart Valley is indeed strong, but since they dared to violate my Brilliant Flame Sect’s territory, all we need to do is defeat them and send them back, how could this be a catastrophe for my Brilliant Flame Sect?”

“Because... Supreme Elder may have already fallen.”

As soon as this statement came out, the audience fell silent.

Only after a long silence passed did one Elder ask hesitantly, “How is that possible? Sect Master, are you making some kind of joke?”

“At this time, how could this King make such a bad joke?” Wei Qing said solemnly.

“But... How could Supreme Elder fall? Wasn’t Supreme Elder entertaining Sir Luo Hai in his residence in the mountains?”

Wei Qing rubbed his forehead as he explained, “A few months ago, Supreme Elder and Sir Luo Hai left Brilliant Flame Sect and went to Ice Heart Valley, but they have not returned since then.”

“That doesn’t mean Supreme Elder has fallen though,” Some could not believe it and still held onto a glimmer of hope, but even while speaking this conjecture they did not have much confidence in their voices.

If the Supreme Elder had not fallen, how could this have happened? Why hadn’t he simply returned to Brilliant Flame Sect?

If Supreme Elder had not fallen, how could Ice Heart Valley dare act so aggressively?

Ice Heart Valley obviously knew the truth of this situation and was using this opportunity to launch an attack.

“Ice Heart Valley’s Luo Li could not possibly have killed the Supreme Elder! Could it be... Sir Luo Hai?” Someone exclaimed.

Only Luo Hai could kill their Supreme Elder on this star. However, wasn’t it rumoured that the two of them had a good relationship? Moreover, when Sir Luo Hai visited Scarlet Wave Star this time, he had been a guest at Brilliant Flame Sect for over a year, so why would he suddenly launch a deadly attack against their Supreme Elder?
