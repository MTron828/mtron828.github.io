Colorful Balloons Take Flight

The situation changed too fast. Yang Kai’s forces, which seemed incapable of resisting, suddenly produced a large number of top-level masters, devastating the Huang Family and Radiant Palace disciples before they could even react.

Even when they finally awakened from their shock, they were still incapable of blocking the nine Blood Warriors’ assault.

This was the first battle the nine Blood Warriors engaged in after breaking through to the Transcendent Realm, so they were even more enthusiastic and ruthless than normal.

The moment they clashed head on with the nine Blood Warriors, Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe realized things were very different from what they had imagined.

When the two of them finally stabilized themselves and turned their eyes back to the battle, they were so shocked they couldn’t even shout.

The elite cultivators from their respective forces were being cut down as easily as wheat in a field by the Yang Family’s nine Blood Warriors.

From the moment Huang Xiao ordered the attack until the end of the battle, only ten breaths of time had elapsed.

The seventy or so Huang Family and Radiant Palace cultivators had been wiped out, leaving only Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe, the two Transcendents, trembling in fear.

A few dozen meters away, the Lu Family elites were also shivering violently.

Originally, when Lu Si refused to join Huang Xiao, giving up this opportunity to earn merits, they were somewhat disappointed, but after witnessing this one sided massacre they couldn’t help thanking the Heavens that their Grand Elder had such vision and foresight.

If the Lu Family’s elites had been joined in just now, they would be no different from the Huang Family and Radiant Palace people – broken and battered corpses strewn across the ground.

A chill gripped all of their hearts, making all of them feel like they had suddenly been tossed into an icebox.

The so-called elites from these two first-class forces weren’t enough to fill the gaps between the teeth of these nine Transcendent masters.

Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe were still dazed, until now they still couldn’t believe what they had just witnessed: Their forces’ core members all being summarily executed all while they stood by, powerless to save them.

Nine figures suddenly rose from the battlefield and shot towards them, it was the nine Yang Family Blood Warriors, all of them wearing cold indifferent expressions.

Facing this impending crisis, Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe snapped out of their stupor, screamed, and hurriedly escaped.

“Young Master Yang, please show mercy!” Lu Si anxiously shouted, “They are still part of the forces resisting the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land!”

“Yang Kai...” Qiu Yi Meng also shouted.

Upon hearing Qiu Yi Meng’s voice, the nine Blood Warrior’s movements slowed slightly, waiting for Yang Kai’s instructions. This short delay allowed Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe to escape.

Seeing that Yang Kai not order a pursuit, Lu Si couldn’t help breathing a sigh of relief.

The elites of the Huang Family and Radiant Palace dying here, although a terrible loss, did not permanently damage the two forces’ foundations, but if Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe also die, these two first-class forces would really be destroyed.

“Many thanks, Young Master Yang!” Lu Si hurriedly cupped his fists and bowed respectfully.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai’s face was slightly awkward as his brow furrowed deeply, his expression neither happy nor unhappy, simply standing there silently.

Lu Si felt quite uneasy in his heart but could do nothing but wait quietly. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Yang Kai’s attention was no longer here.

When the nine Blood Warriors rushed out and struck down the first Immortal Ascension Boundary master, a huge suction force suddenly erupted from his Knowledge Sea and proceeded to pull in an inexplicable clump of energy.

As the masters from the Huang Family and Radiant Palace fell one by one, additional energy masses were drawn into his Knowledge Sea.

Yang Kai quickly immersed his Soul into his Knowledge Sea and carefully inspected this phenomenon.

After a brief examination, he discovered that these energy masses that had been sucked into his Knowledge Sea were actually the Spiritual Energy remnants from the dead Immortal Ascension Boundary masters.

Every Immortal Ascension Boundary master had opened his or her own Knowledge Sea which served as a container for their Spiritual Energy.

When an Immortal Ascension Boundary master died, their Knowledge Sea would collapse. When this happened, the Spiritual Energy contained within their Knowledge Sea would quickly dissipate into the surrounding world.

It was as if a cup that was filled with water had been broken, sending the contents spilling out, eventually evaporating and returning to nature.

Unless one had some kind of special Precious Treasure to serve as a receptacle, there was no way to save the Spiritual Energy which leaked out after the death of an Immortal Ascension Boundary master.

For example, the Soul Warming Lotus.

When Yang Kai had first encountered the Soul Warming Lotus, it had been wrapped in a huge well of Spiritual Energy that was left over from its previous owner.

However, Yang Kai’s cultivation at the time was too low, so there was no way for him to absorb that Spiritual Energy, allowing Old Demon to pick up a bargain.

Today though, the Spiritual Energy which emerged from the Knowledge Seas of these deceased Immortal Ascension Boundary masters had all been drawn into Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea.

The source of this attraction though was not the Soul Warming Lotus but rather the Solitary Golden Eye.

Yang Kai’s expression was solemn.

The tyrannical power of the Solitary Golden Eye, he had experienced once before, and as such he had spent an entire month attempting to refine it.

Unfortunately, all his attempts were futile; all he had accomplished was allowing his Soul to have a subtle link with it.

Originally, Yang Kai hadn’t cared much about not being able to refine the Solitary Golden Eye, so it suddenly playing a role now came as a great surprise.

More than seventy lumps of Spiritual Energy were now clustered together inside his Knowledge Sea. These Spiritual Energy groups contained all the remnant thoughts of the Huang Family and the Radiant Palace cultivators, like a great hodgepodge of memories and experiences, causing Yang Kai’s brow to wrinkle greatly.

With his Divine Sense immersed inside his Knowledge Sea, naturally he wouldn’t respond to the voices calling out to him in the outside world.

To everyone else, it was like Yang Kai was deep in thought, contemplating something very important, and his expression changing rapidly.

After a while, Yang Kai suddenly came to his senses and swept his eyes over the battlefield. Not seeing the bodies of Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe, he immediately understood that they had managed to escape.

Not interested in pursuing the matter any further, he simply said, “Clear the bodies!”

After issuing these instructions, Yang Kai turned around and walked towards the house.

“Young Master Yang, please wait!” Lu Si suddenly called out.

Yang Kai stopped, glanced back, and with an impatient look on his face asked, “What advice does Senior Lu have?”

Lu Si ignored the cold sweat on his forehead and quickly waved his hands, “This Lu doesn’t dare...”

In the past, Lu Si had taken advantage of his age and status in front of Yang Kai in order to play the role of a Senior, but seeing with his own eyes the incredible strength gathered here and the ruthless methods they employed, how could Lu Si dare try to pull rank?

If he wasn’t careful, all the Lu Family people gathered here today would pay the price.

Immediately putting on a humble appearance, he carefully asked, “Young Master Yang... how do you plan on handling this?”

“Handling what?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Killing that many people...”

“What’s done is done, if someone wants to take revenge for them, they’re welcome to come find me.” Yang Kai smiled coldly, “Or what? Does Senior Lu want to take revenge for them?”

“Please don’t joke with this old man, Young Master Yang.” Lu Si hurriedly said, “This Lu just wants to say, this time, my Lu Family traveled here together with the Huang Family and Radiant Palace in order to aid the Central Capital’s Eight Great Families, but now that such a situation has occurred, if the Eight Great Families inquire, it will be difficult for this old master to explain.”

Turning around, Yang Kai stared towards Lu Si and calmly asked, “Senior Lu, I ask you: Was this time’s matter my fault?”

“No.” Lu Si thought about it for a moment before shaking his head seriously.

What transpired here really wasn’t Yang Kai fault. From the beginning, it was Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe who insisted on causing trouble. They acted against Yang Kai but had greatly underestimated their opponent’s strength and wound up suffering a disastrous loss instead. They could only blame themselves for having eyes but failing to see, offending someone who should not be offended.

The only misdemeanor Yang Kai had committed was that he had acted too mercilessly; there was no need for him to kill so many people. As long as the nine Blood Warriors released their auras, the Huang Family and Radiant Palace would definitely have backed down.

But the Yang Family’s Little Lord had such a personality; Lu Si had both heard of and experienced it. He even dared to kill the heirs of two first-class families, so why would he hesitate to wipe out a group of so-called elites?

“Since I am not in the wrong here, if the Eight Great Families asks, Senior Lu can simply tell the truth.” Yang Kai sneered.

Lu Si slowly shook his head, “Our three forces travelled together, yet while the Huang Family and Radiant Palace suffered major losses, my Lu Family emerged unharmed. When we reach the Central Capital, I’m afraid the Lu Family will be suspected.”

“Whatever Senior Lu wants to say, just say it, I don’t have time to waste with you!”

Lu Si grit his teeth for a moment before letting out a sigh, “The characters of Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe, this old master understands well. Their mistake caused their two forces foundations to be seriously damaged, so in order to avoid losing face, I’m afraid they will try to shift all responsibility onto my Lu Family and Young Master Yang.”

“By saying you colluded with me to frame them?”

“It’s not impossible.” Lu Si nodded.

Yang Kai laughed, “Then your Lu Family is finished. This time, I’m afraid that even the Qiu Family won’t be able to protect you.”

Seeing Yang Kai taking pleasure in their misfortune, Lu Si didn’t dare to get angry, simply sighing again and sincerely imploring, “Therefore, this old master humbly requests Young Master Yang accompany me to the Central Capital.”

Hearing this request, Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed as a cold light flickered in the depths of his eyes.

“Young Master Yang has a great many powerful masters behind him. If you can accompany my Lu Family to the Central Capital, you might be able to break the current deadlock. At that time, the Eight Great Families will no longer accuse Young Master Yang of anything and my Lu Family will be able to protect itself. There are only advantages for you. In fact... old master has never believed that Young Master Yang is colluding with demons and devils.”

“I appreciate Senior Lu’s confidence in me...” Yang Kai said faintly, “But the life and death of the Eight Great Families and the survival of the Central Capital, what does any of that have to do with me? My remaining here is only to seek refuge. Farewell Senior Lu, I’ll not see you off.”

Saying so, Yang Kai turned around and walked into the house, not giving Lu Si any opportunity to respond...

In short order, all the bodies outside the house were processed by the nine Blood Warriors and everyone followed Yang Kai back into the compound, leaving behind the Lu Family outside the barrier.

Lu Si could only smile bitterly.

Inside the mansion, the injured Bi Luo was being treated. Shan Qing Luo followed beside Yang Kai to see her and let out a sigh of relief after some investigation.

“Thank you.” Shan Qing Luo looked at Yang Kai faintly, her peerless enchanting face filled with a faint pink blush and her breathing becoming slightly heavy.

Perceiving this abnormality, Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man looked at her strangely.

Wondering what this Beguiling Demon Queen was thinking, wearing such an expression in public.

“Are you alright?” Yang Kai swept his eyes over her.

“I’m fine,” Shan Qing Luo smiled sweetly, an intoxicated light flashing across her eyes, “I just want to eat you.”

“Hey... there are others here!” Qiu Yi Meng couldn’t stand it and shouted. Such blatant seduction, wasn’t she acting a bit too shameless? In an instant, all the favourable impressions she had of the Beguiling Demon Queen immediately plummeted.
