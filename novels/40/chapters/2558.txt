Serene Soul angrily lashed out, “Duan Hong Chen, enough is enough!”

[He isn’t looking favourably on that brat but rather looking down on me!] Serene Soul immediately blew his top.

Duan Hong Chen indifferently stated, “He is proficient in the Dao of Space!”

“Is that so?” Serene Soul was slightly shocked, but since Duan Hong Chen said this boy was proficient in the Dao of Space, then he really must be so. Such a person would really be hard to kill.

“He has also mastered the Time Flies Seal!”

“What!? Time Flies Seal!?” Serene Soul was really shocked this time. Time Flies Seal was the Divine Ability of the Flowing Time Great Emperor, the only Divine Ability related to the Dao of Time in this world. Even Serene Soul himself had not been able to get a glimpse of its secrets. Once the Time Flies Seal was used, his daughter really might be buried along with him.

“By the way, he also has the Mountains and Rivers Bell!” Duan Hong Chen threw out information in bits and pieces, each time giving Serene Soul a bigger shock than the last, making his expression change even more drastically than before. Giving it another thought, even Duan Hong Chen felt uncomfortable.

He didn’t have an idea about any of this; after all, Yang Kai hadn’t revealed much information in the Shattered Star Sea back then.

The Serene Soul Great Emperor was flabbergasted and in a daze, the corners of his lips were constantly twitching.

After a long time, he confirmed in a grim voice, “Yuan Ding’s Mountains and Rivers Bell?”

Duan Hong Chen raised his brow before rebuking, “Apart from that Mountains and Rivers Bell, are there any other Mountains and Rivers Bell you know of?”

Serene Soul’s facial muscles twitched even more fiercely.

Although he was one of the Ten Great Emperors and had no shortage of Emperor Artifacts, he couldn’t help but covet an artifact like the Mountains and Rivers Bell, an Ancient Exotic Artifact. In the past, when Heaven Devourer was besieged, he killed Yuan Ding first at the cost of serious injuries all because of the fear of the suppressive capabilities of the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

How could Serene Soul not desire something that even Heavenly Devourer was afraid of?

[Dao of Space, Time Flies, Mountains and Rivers Bell…]

[This brat’s luck is simply too good. How could he gather all these treasures for himself? It’s already a blessing if an ordinary cultivator can obtain one! Is he simply that loved by the Heavens?]

[Those who are not blessed will not encounter such fortuitous opportunities. The blessings of this brat are too Heaven defying.]

After a while of silence, Serene Soul stated with a snort, “What’s the point in telling me this? How boring!”

Duan Hong Chen replied, chuckling, “I’m just making small talk…”

He knew that Serene Soul wouldn’t attempt to kill Yang Kai anymore, because he wasn’t confident that he could behead Yang Kai with just his Soul Descent. Duan Hong Chen wouldn’t have revealed all this if that wasn’t his objective.

While speaking, Duan Hong Chen impatiently urged again, “You should quickly settle the things there. This Old Master is waiting for you to separate me from Heaven Devourer. Ever since this old dog has occupied this Old Master’s body, it has become inconvenient for this Old Master to visit the brothel!”

The Serene Soul Great Emperor was titled Serene Soul naturally because he was proficient in Souls and Spiritual Energy. He had done the most thorough research on the topics related to Spiritual Energy and Souls among the Ten Great Emperors. Therefore, Duan Hong Chen had come to Serene Soul Palace and asked the Serene Soul Great Emperor for help. He wanted to check whether Serene Soul could strip Heaven Devourer’s Soul from his body.

If even Serene Soul couldn’t help him, then he could only temporarily maintain this state while trying to find other solutions. When he contemplated the future, Duan Hong Chen couldn’t help but shudder.

Speaking of proper business, Serene Soul’s face also turned serious as he replied, “Hong Chen, I won’t hide it from you. Your situation is a bit tricky. I may not be able to help.”

“Whether you can help or not, it’s fine. Just give it a try,” Duan Hong Chen replied in a grim voice.

Serene Soul nodded before closing his eyes again. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Outside the Ancient Lands Passageway, Yang Kai was keeping an eye on Old Fu while holding the Myriads Sword, not daring to let down his guard.

The Soul Manifestation of the Serene Soul Great Emperor spoke a sentence to him before he stopped moving, leaving Yang Kai puzzled. He couldn’t comprehend what Serene Soul wanted to do.

[Should I take advantage of this situation and run away?]

[But if the matter here isn’t resolved, I might be targeted by the Serene Soul Palace. The Serene Soul Palace and the Netherworld Sect are on completely different levels. Being targeted by those from the Serene Soul Palace will definitely be troublesome.]

Thinking about it, an even bolder idea flashed in his mind.

[How about I be the ruthless one and kill these two first? Their deaths would end all my troubles.]

However, the moment this idea appeared in his mind, it was quashed by Yang Kai. If he really did this, he would completely offend the Serene Soul Great Emperor.

[Let’s look at how things proceed first.] Yang Kai decided to act depending on the situation. If the Serene Soul Great Emperor really tried to attack him, it would not be too late to react. Considering all this, he glanced at Lin’er and coincidentally, she too was looking at him.

As their gazes met, Yang Kai pursed his lips into an evil grin, one that made him look extremely ferocious.

Lin’er was frightened and hurriedly looked away, questioning what her Father was doing. [Things won’t end even with the death of this brat… I was bullied and can’t lift my head anymore… How depressing…]

At this moment, Old Fu, who had been standing still, suddenly raised his head and looked at Yang Kai as if he had regained his senses.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but nervously gulp before speaking in a stiff voice, “Sir, what advice do you have for me?”

Old Fu slightly narrowed his eyes as he sized up Yang Kai. Then, he turned his gaze to the corpses of the twenty or so Netherworld Sect disciples. He knew that these people had unjustly died. How could they be an opponent of someone who had fought together with the Bustling World Great Emperor to deal with Heaven Devourer?

[Mountains and Rivers Bell! After this Ancient Exotic Artifact was brought out of this place by Yuan Ding tens of thousands of years ago… To think it would return to this place again…]

“I understand the gist of what has happened here,” Old Fu indifferently stated, “My daughter was in the wrong in this matter and deliberately made trouble for you. You did nothing wrong.”

“Haha, Sir’s vision is truly sharp,” Yang Kai relaxed after hearing this as he knew that he wasn’t in danger. In any case, Serene Soul was a Great Emperor, and since he had given such a judgement, he would definitely not make trouble for Yang Kai any longer.

On the contrary, Lin’er pouted in anger upon hearing this, her face filled with dissatisfaction.

Old Fu added with a nod, “The Ancient Lands are a dangerous place, take good care of yourself.”

Having said so, he stretched his hand toward Lin’er and wrapped her up in his Emperor Qi before turning to leave.

“Wait!” Yang Kai hurriedly shouted seeing his stance.

“You have something more to say?” Old Fu turned his head, looking at Yang Kai with some impatience.

The corner of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched as he asked, “Sir, you are not thinking of leaving just like that right?”

[Are you kidding me? I was injured because of this stubborn girl, and now you want to leave without so much as a word of apology?] Even if Heavens’ retribution came down now, Yang Kai wouldn’t agree to this.

Old Fu was stunned and a strange look appeared on his face as he asked, “What do you want?”

Yang Kai grimaced in pain and stated, pointing at the gaping wound on his chest, “Sir, this Junior’s injuries are a result of your daughter’s interference, even my bones have been crushed and I’m afraid I won’t be able to recover from this for at least a half year…”

Old Fu turned his gaze down, looking at the squirming muscles near Yang Kai’s wound, and immediately, his face couldn’t help but twitch a little.

Did this brat think he was blind? Although he couldn’t see what Body Tempering Secret Art Yang Kai had cultivated, such an injury was clearly just a superficial wound to him and would fully recover in a few days, yet he dared to claim it would take half a year of rest to recover from? How outrageous!

Yang Kai didn’t seem to have noticed his expression and continued, “Sir also said that the Ancient Lands are dangerous. This Junior must continue to venture forth because of some personal matters. If Junior was to die here because of this wound, your dear daughter would not be able to escape blame. If this matter were to be spread out, Sir’s prestige would truly be affected. Others will definitely say that Sir schemed together with his daughter to commit murder. Tsk tsk… Sir’s also has a reputation to maintain, right?”

[Is he really trying to threaten me!?] Old Fu slightly raised his brow, his expression turning gloomy as he bluntly asked, “What do you want?”

Yang Kai put away his sword and replied in a trembling voice, “This Junior is confident in his strength, but isn’t sure that he can charge straight into the Ancient Lands unscathed. Sir, if you could casually offer me a defensive artifact, at least to protect myself due to my wounds, that would be the best.”

Angered, Old Fu broke into laughter before asking, “What defensive artifact do you want? Let’s hear it.”

Yang Kai replied with a stern face, “The bowl in your daughter’s hand… I think it’s pretty good…”

Lin’er was greatly taken aback and she furiously rebuked, “You ruffian! You dare to have eyes for my treasure!?”

Yang Kai snorted and countered, glaring, “When adults are speaking, children should keep quiet!”

Old Fu looked at Yang Kai, smiling, and asked, “Do you want the Taiyi Cinnamon Bowl?”

“So, it’s called the Taiyi Cinnamon Bowl…” Yang Kai raised his brow before continuing, grinning, “If Sir can bestow it to me, it would naturally be best. To tell you the truth, this Junior has been wandering alone in the Star Boundary and is currently quite poor. Although I have reached the Emperor Realm, I haven’t been able to find a good artifact. I have had truly bitter days!”

[You have the Mountains and Rivers Bell in your possession, and you still dare to call yourself poor? Only ghosts would believe you!] Old Fu snorted in his heart.

“Sir is a respectable Great Emperor and has no shortage of Emperor Artifacts, right?” Yang Kai continued to pester. He really wanted the Taiyi Cinnamon Bowl as it clearly had exceptional defensive abilities and he just happened to lack a defensive artifact. It was indeed a reckless waste of such a good treasure to be placed in the hands of Lin’er, so if Yang Kai could get his hands on it, it would just be like adding wings to a tiger.

“My Father is my Father, and I’m me! Why are you eyeing my treasure!?” Lin’er screamed. This man was truly loathsome! He kept making such unreasonable demands. If she could beat him up, she would have long ago taught him a lesson!

“Isn’t everything because of you? Just look at my wound!” Yang Kai puffed up his chest, his hideous wound immediately scaring Lin’er as she quickly turned her head away.

He might have been bringing up his wound at every turn, making for a dull argument, but it was indeed quite frightening.

Old Fu remained indifferent for a while before he agreed, nodding, “That also makes sense. It’s not impossible to give you the Taiyi Cinnamon Bowl!”

Yang Kai burst with joy after hearing this. He was just trying his luck; after all, the Serene Soul Great Emperor had a reputation to uphold and needed to keep some face. Even if he didn’t give Yang Kai the Taiyi Cinnamon Bowl, he would give something else. Otherwise, his enmity with Lin’er would remain unresolved!

But Yang Kai had never even imagined that the Serene Soul Great Emperor would be so easy to talk to. By the looks of it, the Taiyi Cinnamon Bowl would be given to him.

Yang Kai smacked his lips and stretched his hand out towards Lin’er, asking, “Give it!”

Mouth agape, Lin’er looked at Old Fu and grievously pleaded, “Father!”

Old Fu remained unmoved and indifferently stated, “I can give you the Taiyi Cinnamon Bowl, but I can’t give it for free. This King wants something in exchange from you. If you agree, the Taiyi Cinnamon Bowl is yours.”

Yang Kai suddenly became vigilant, “What is it?”

[There are conditions? What’s the meaning of this!?]
