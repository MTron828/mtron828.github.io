Space was an extremely mysterious thing. There had been countless talented geniuses who had led their eras throughout the ages, but how many of them could thoroughly study the mysteries of the Dao of Space?

Even the current Yang Kai didn’t dare say that he had fully comprehended the essence of the Dao of Space, he had simply walked further and saw more of the Dao of Space than others.

He had been to the Void Crack many times, so he was naturally no stranger to this omnipresent Void Turbulence.

Ordinary people wouldn’t be able to find a direction or any kind of regularity here, but for those who were proficient in the Dao of Space, the movements of the Void Turbulence were still quite noticeable.

Although it had been determined that Great Evolution Pass’ Core had been lost in the Void Crack, no one knew where it was exactly.

After 30,000 years, perhaps the Core had drifted far away along with the Void Turbulence’s flow.

What Yang Kai needed to do now was to find some clues that he could use to find the Core in this boundless expanse.

This was undoubtedly a difficult task.

The only piece of good news was that the Core shouldn’t have drifted too far away; otherwise, it wouldn’t have disturbed the stability of the Void Corridor between Great Evolution Pass and Wind and Cloud Pass.

Yang Kai tried his best to recall the place where the Void Corridor was disrupted back then. His figure moved through the Void Turbulence like a fish through water as he pushed his Space Principles.

Meanwhile, Yuan Xing Ge, at Wind and Cloud Pass’ Space Array, ordered, “Send a message to Great Evolution Pass and inform them of the situation here.”

The Great Evolution Army had no idea how long it would take for Yang Kai to find the Core in the Void Crack, but they must still be waiting for news.

The soldier on duty nodded in response and quickly prepared a blank jade slip. He recorded everything that had transpired here with his Divine Sense before activating the Space Array and sending the jade slip to Great Evolution Pass.

The moment the two Arrays connected, Yang Kai, who was in the Void Crack between them, sensed it. Via his Divine Sense, he quickly discovered that something was rapidly passing through the local space.

Very soon, he understood that it should be a message sent by Wind and Cloud Pass to Great Evolution Pass.

[Yuan Xing Ge is quite meticulous, while I was a bit sloppy. I should have reported to Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao before I left. But since Wind and Cloud Pass has sent a message, it should be fine now.]

Yang Kai found nothing as he investigated along the direction of the Void Turbulence flow, which frustrated him slightly. Had he known that Great Evolution Pass’ Core was lost in this Void Crack, he wouldn’t have been so quick to open up the Void Corridor that day. That was undoubtedly the best opportunity to find the Core, because he could find the source of the disturbance.

The source of this disturbance was definitely the location of the Core.

Nevertheless, there was no point in crying over spilt milk; no one had expected such a situation to occur.

Just as this thought flashed across Yang Kai’s mind, he shook his head and quashed it. Sabotaging the Space Array wouldn’t be a problem, and repairing it wasn’t an issue either, but the chances of reconstructing the exact circumstance from 30,000 years ago were far too low. Even the slightest error could throw the entire attempt off.

Right now, the best solution was to search, slowly and painstakingly. Perhaps he might even obtain some benefits.

Just as Yang Kai was looking around, he suddenly felt a strange reaction from his Space Ring. He quickly stopped and focused his Divine Sense.

The next instant, a look of shock appeared on his face as an extremely rich fluctuation of Space Principles began to radiate from his Space Ring.

Before he could figure out what was going on, a seven-coloured figure of light flew out from his Space Ring. The figure of light twisted and transformed, taking the shape of a young woman in front of him.

Yang Kai stared at the figure before him in shock and muttered, “Si Niang?”

This young woman was none other than Huang Si Niang, who should be back at the No-Return Pass.

[How is Si Niang here, and how did she appear from my Space Ring!?]

[Also, aren’t the Phoenix Clan and Dragon Clan bound by the Bloodline Great Oath that prevents them from leaving the No-Return Pass unless they are under threat of extermination?]

While Yang Kai was reeling from the shock, Huang Si Niang stretched lazily and chanted “I’m finally out!”

After glancing around, she was a little taken aback by her surroundings and muttered, “You’re cultivating the Dao of Space here? No wonder I felt strong fluctuations of Space Principles.”

If it weren’t for the fact that she had noticed the extremely chaotic fluctuations of the surrounding Space Principles, she wouldn’t have appeared.

She had thought that Yang Kai had encountered some kind of enemy and was currently locked in battle, but contrary to her assumption, he was actually swimming through the Void Crack.

Yang Kai sized up Huang Si Niang for a moment before hesitantly guessing, “A Soul Clone?”

When she first appeared in front of him, Yang Kai really thought that Si Niang had come here in person, but after carefully examining her, he discovered that she had not. This should be a type of Soul Clone because the Huang Si Niang in front of him wasn’t as powerful as he had seen before. However, this was clearly somewhat different from an ordinary Soul Clone.

Si Niang had no intention of explaining and just slightly nodded her agreement to his question, “Yup.”

Yang Kai didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, “That tail feather?”

Si Niang grinned.

Yang Kai smacked his forehead, voicing his thoughts, “I was wondering why you were so generous when we first met, it turns out you had this in mind.”

Back at the Phoenix Nest, Si Niang had said that she had lost a bet with Feng Liu Lang, and as a result, she had to give him a tail feather.

Yang Kai was quite puzzled by this; the two of them had made a bet, so how was he related? But, it was the tail feather of a Phoenix, from which he could comprehend the Dao of Space, so Yang Kai naturally happily accepted it.

But by the looks of it, it wasn’t because of his outstanding charisma and charm, but rather because Huang Si Niang had other plans.

Si Niang really liked to join in on the fun, but unfortunately, she couldn’t leave the No-Return Pass, nor did the Black Ink Clan come attacking, so she spent her days in her Phoenix Nest, bored to death.

Although a large number of Humans, who would come to the No-Return Pass and would be sent to the various Great Passes, would appear every few years, they were all ordinary Humans. How could Si Niang lower herself to interact with them?

Yang Kai, on the other hand, was different. He was partially a Dragon at that time. So, giving him a tail feather was no big deal.

In truth, Si Niang hadn’t schemed against Yang Kai in this matter, she just hadn’t told him the whole truth because she had some selfish motives.

Although a Space Ring was a sealed space, with the Phoenix Clan’s attainments in the Dao of Space, it naturally wouldn’t be difficult for Si Niang to escape even if Yang Kai placed the tail feather inside one.

The reason she had appeared at this time was because she had sensed dense fluctuations of the Space Principles and had thought that Yang Kai was fighting with the Black Ink Clan, so she had come out to join in.

As a result, she appeared in the Void Crack.

“Your Soul Clone is not restricted by the Bloodline Oath?” Yang Kai asked.

Huang Si Niang pursed her lips, “It’s just a Soul Clone, why would it receive any restrictions? It’s not a big deal if my main body doesn’t leave the No-Return Pass.”

Yang Kai just nodded along in response.

“What are you doing in such a place?” Huang Si Niang looked around, and when she saw nothing but Void Turbulence, disappointment filled her face.

Although her tail feather was similar to a Soul Clone, it wasn’t really one, so she couldn’t maintain this state indefinitely. At most, she could only manifest around three times before it became ineffective.

This was a waste of an opportunity, so she was truly annoyed.

Yang Kai, on the other hand, was overjoyed, “Si Niang, you came just in time! I have something I need your help with.”

Huang Si Niang couldn’t help but gawk at his happy expression…

After Yang Kai explained the situation, Huang Si Niang nodded, “Understood. Since that’s the case, let’s split up and search.”

Saying so, her figure flickered as she transformed into a seven-coloured streak of light and disappeared into the Void Turbulence.

Yang Kai watched in amazement.

Although his mastery of the Dao of Space had reached an extremely high level and he had no problem traversing through this turbulent Void, Huang Si Niang was a Phoenix with an innate Bloodline Talent for the Dao of Space, allowing her to literally feel at home in this kind of environment. He couldn’t repeat the same feat.

This had nothing to do with mastery.

If he could be considered a person who had practised and mastered the art of swimming, then Huang Si Niang and the other Phoenixes would be fish born in the ocean.

Be that as it may, if he were to think about it from a different perspective, he had his own advantages. Although their Bloodline Talent was indeed powerful and beneficial, it was also set in stone with predefined limits. This was also why the Phoenix Clan was unable to repair the damaged Universe Temples.

The Human Race had made many innovations and come up with a lot of applications for the Dao of Space, something the Phoenix Clan couldn’t compare to.

In any case, it should not be a problem to find the Great Evolution Pass Core with the help of Huang Si Niang.

As for how she would inform him after finding it, that was something Yang Kai was not worried about. The advantages the Phoenix Clan could display here were beyond his reach. Since Si Niang had left so quickly, she definitely had a way to find him again.

Keeping his thoughts to himself, Yang Kai also shuttled through the Void Turbulence and began carefully searching.

Unfortunately, he didn’t find anything, until he sensed a strange movement in the Void near him at some point. Yang Kai focused his senses to investigate and found that a seven-coloured beam of light was rapidly approaching him through the Void Turbulence. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“I don’t know if it’s what you’re looking for, but there’s something strange over there,” Huang Si Niang reported before turning around and leading the way.

Yang Kai quickly chased after her.

A moment later, the two stopped somewhere in the Void Crack, staring at the strange scene before their eyes. Yang Kai became slightly absent-minded at the sight of this.

He had travelled through the Void Crack many times, but he had never seen anything like this.

The Void Turbulence had almost solidified into a sphere-like object. Even now, more turbulence was still being pulled in from the surroundings and merging with this anomaly, slowly enlarging the sphere.

Who knows how long it had existed for it to reach its current size.

“Is this what you’re looking for?” Huang Si Niang asked.

Yang Kai shook his head, “I’m not sure, but it might be.”

There was nothing else in this Void Crack apart from this strange thing; furthermore, the surrounding Void Turbulence was extremely chaotic because of this object, so it was quite possible that it had disturbed the Void Corridor before.

Huang Si Niang looked at it for a moment before replying, “It’s going to be a bit difficult to deal with this.”

Yang Kai humbly asked, “Can you take it out directly?”

Huang Si Niang shook her head, “This thing is formed from an immense amount of Void Turbulence. Even if you could force it open, once the structure is disturbed, the flow around here will surely become extremely violent and chaotic, to the point where this section of the Void Crack will be torn to pieces and scatter about randomly.”

Yang Kai nodded his agreement, “Then we’ll have to slowly peel it open.”
