Chapter 5486: Emptying the Family Coffers

Of course, after his fist landed on their heads, Yang Kai abruptly came back to his senses. How could these two… be so easily beaten by him? Even with his current strength, if either of these two even sneezed too hard at him, he would be vaporized.

Yang Kai’s head was filled with indignation and anxiety at that moment and acted without thinking, only wanting to teach these brats a lesson.

Naturally, Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan were also struck dumb by this and both of them stared blankly at Yang Kai, holding their heads.

This was probably the first time someone had ever knocked on their heads. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Yang Kai had also fallen into a daze. Looking at their figures before him, he suddenly recalled that while he might address them cordially as Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan, they were two of the most powerful Masters to have ever lived. Of course, they were still children at heart.

The ancient Supreme Masters Mo was also childlike, so how could the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer, who were from the same era and possessed the same level of strength, not be similar. It could be that countless years of isolation from the outside world had prevented them from maturing. Or, it might just be the Universe trying to achieve some kind of balance.

Yang Kai had placed all his hopes of defeating Mo on them, and had even asked for them to merge together, yet he had never asked their opinion.

[Right now, they are Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan, but what if they really merged? What would become of them?]

Feeling somewhat guilty, Yang Kai sighed and gently rubbed their heads.

Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan seemed to have sensed the change in Yang Kai’s mood. Big Brother Huang tilted his head to avoid his hand and stated, “If we really could merge, we would have discovered it long ago. Why would we wait for you to remind us?”

Big Sister Lan also nodded, but she didn’t avoid Yang Kai’s hand, rather her eyes became slightly narrow as a look of enjoyment appeared on her face.

“But…” Big Brother Huang’s tone suddenly changed, “We sensed something strange over the years.”

“Like what?” Yang Kai asked.

Big Brother Huang thought about it for a moment, as if he was trying to sort out his words. After a while, he finally replied, “We have a vague memory from the time when our consciousnesses were not fully developed. It’s as if we Brother and Sister, once existed together somewhere, but one day we suddenly left that place and appeared in the Chaotic Dead Territory.”

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up after hearing this, “What kind of place was that?”

Big Brother Huang shook his head in response, “We were ignorant at that time and we only have some vague memories of it now.”

Big Sister Lan added, “I think it’s not that we left, but rather that we were abandoned.”

“Abandoned?” Yang Kai was shocked. [These two were already among the strongest beings in existence the moment they were born, so how could they have been abandoned?]

Nonetheless, the only thing he was certain of now was that Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan were deeply related to the Primordial Light, or else their combined strength would not have been able to restrain the Black Ink Strength so easily.

The Primordial Light and Black Ink Strength were basically complete opposites.

According to Cang, the Primordial Light should have gained sentience a long time ago and now, it might not be in the form of a simple light. It could be a tree, a flower, or anything else in this World.

Combined with what Big Sister Lan had said, Yang Kai suddenly had a bold guess.

[Could it be that after the Primordial Light gained sentience, it stripped away the Great Sun Force and Great Moon Force from its body? That Great Sun Force eventually became the Burning Light, and the Great Moon Force turned into the Serene Glimmer. But in that case, where is its main body?]

Perhaps, Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan’s inability to control their own strength was related to this, because they themselves were only two parts of that Primordial Light. Currently, they are damaged and incomplete, so naturally, they are unable to control their strength, leading to the continuous confrontation between their innate Forces.

But in that case, why did Primordial Light strip these two from its body? What form did it take afterwards?

Unable to figure anything out, Yang Kai suddenly thought of something else and asked, “The World reveres the two of you as the ancestors of all Divine Spirits, but did the two of you really give birth to the Divine Spirits’ Bloodlines?”

Big Sister Lan immediately blushed red, “We’re still children, what nonsense are you spouting?”

Big Brother Huang also stuttered, “Don’t talk nonsense, we’re Brother and Sister.”

Sister Lan corrected him, “Sister and Brother, it’s Sister first then Brother!”

…..

The two of them began arguing like usual while Yang Kai stroked his chin thoughtfully. Before he had met Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan, he had not given much of a thought to the fact that the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer were progenitors of all Divine Spirits, but after meeting these two and getting to know them, he became highly suspicious of this claim.

How could these two give birth to the Divine Spirits? Moreover, there were so many different types of Divine Spirits, so was it even possible for them to be the common ancestors to all of them.

By the looks of it, these two being the so-called Divine Spirit Progenitors was also just a misunderstanding. However, the reason why Yang Kai’s Dragon Vein could improve so quickly was because of the energy bestowed by them all those years ago.

From this, it could be seen that they had some kind of close relationship with the Divine Spirits, but it no longer seemed like they were the legendary ancestors.

History was shrouded in multiple veils of ancient secrets that had been obscured over millions and millions of years. If one did not belong to that era, there was simply no way to uncover the truth anymore.

Yang Kai couldn’t be bothered to think about such matters now though. The main reason he had come here was to ask these two to descend the mountain and deal with the Black Ink Giant Spirit Gods. Now that he knew they couldn’t control their own strength though, his plan had failed before even beginning.

However, since he was here, he naturally couldn’t just return empty-handed.

With this thought in mind, Yang Kai cupped his fist and requested, “Big Brother, Big Sister, the Humans’ entire existence is at stake. The Purifying Light created by merging your energies is the nemesis of Black Ink Strength, so Little Brother must earnestly request that the two of you bestow upon us some Yellow and Blue Crystals to prepare for battle.”

Hearing this, the two of them stopped arguing and Big Sister Lan agreed, nodding, “No problem, how much do you want?”

Yang Kai solemnly answered, “The more the better! Also, is there a way for you to allow me to bestow the Great Sun and Great Moon Marks to others?”

Without these two seals, the Yellow and Blue Crystals were just cultivation materials. Only by activating these two marks could the Yellow and Blue Crystals fuse into Purifying Light that could counter the Black Ink Clan.

But Yang Kai had come here alone and didn’t know what he should do to carry the Great Sun and Great Moon Marks and bestow them to someone else. It would be great if Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan had a solution to this problem, but if they did not, he would have no choice but to ask someone else to come to the Chaotic Dead Territory and leave them to Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan.

He was considering this now because he was currently the only one who could create Purifying Light. Even if he had enough Yellow and Blue Crystals, the efficiency was still quite low while the risk was also quite high. If more people had the Great Sun and Great Moon Marks though, things would be much simpler.

Big Brother Huang explained, “These two marks are formed from our Source Strength, so while we can bestow a few more to you, it can’t be too many. Moreover, these two marks can only be borne by one with a Divine Spirit Bloodline. You must remember this, for if one doesn’t have the body or Bloodline of a Divine Spirit, they will die trying to refine our two marks.”

Yang Kai repeatedly nodded.

Big Brother Huang continued, “We’ll get you some Yellow and Blue Crystals first.”

Saying so, Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan’s figures flickered before a boundless pressure emanated from them. Even though Yang Kai was already an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he still felt completely insignificant before them as his heart clenched tight.

The next moment, surging waves of energy gushed out from their bodies, transforming into enormous yellow and blue clouds.

The moment these two clouds appeared, they immediately flew at each other and collided non-stop as powerful energy fluctuations began spreading throughout the Chaotic Dead Territory.

As they collided, the two clouds constantly scattered and re-condensed, creating massive amounts of Yellow and Blue Crystals of various Orders.

Nonetheless, Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan didn’t stop. They constantly pushed their strength as clouds of various sizes appeared, one after another, flying off in different directions.

It was true that these two were unable to control their own strength, so once they clashed with the energy in their bodies, they were simply unable to direct the result. Their energies would automatically clash once unleashed.

Be that as it may, their strength seemed to be limitless. The entire void was filled with clouds of various shapes and sizes in just a few days, and soon after that, Yellow and Blue Crystals were floating everywhere. All the Yellow and Blue Crystals varied in sizes and qualities; some were as small as beads while some were as large as mountains.

Since Yang Kai didn’t stop them, they had no intention of stopping.

While Big Brother Huang kept pushing his strength, he also taught Yang Kai a set of Secret Techniques. According to him, Yang Kai could create Great Sun and Moon Marks by activating this Secret Technique with his Divine Spirit Source, supplemented with part of their Source Strength.

Yang Kai was naturally overjoyed by this, and carefully memorized this Secret Technique.

After Yang Kai had completely mastered this Secret Technique, Big Brother Huang stretched out his hand and pointed towards him as an orange-yellow bead appeared before him.

Big Brother Huang pointed 10 times, for a total of 10 beads.

Each bead was created using his Source Strength and was also the foundation for cultivating the Great Sun Mark.

On another side, Big Sister Lan also followed suit, creating 10 blue beads.

After they had done this, Yang Kai could clearly feel that Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan were a bit exhausted. Obviously, extracting so much of their Source Strength was detrimental to them.

Putting away the 20 beads, Yang Kai wore an earnest look and thanked the two, cupping his fist, “Little Brother thanks Big Brother and Big Sister on behalf of the Human Race and all living beings in the 3,000 Worlds!”

Big Brother Huang stated, shaking his head, “We can’t help you much. This is all we can do.”

Big Sister Lan exhorted, “You must be careful, don’t die so easily.”

Yang Kai grinned, “Don’t worry, how could your Little Brother die so easily if the Black Ink Clan is not destroyed?” Changing the topic, he pointed towards the distance and requested, “Little Brother also has another request, can I take some of your Small Stone Race armies?”

The Small Stone Race in the Chaotic Dead Territory had been raised so well by Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan that even 1,000 metres tall clansmen comparable to Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters had appeared. It would be a waste to leave them here just to kill each other. The Small Stone Race were unafraid of the corruption of Black Ink Strength, so they could become a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.

How could Yang Kai miss this opportunity?

Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan were both a bit speechless as they felt that Yang Kai’s visit this time had nearly emptied out their entire family’s fortune. He had asked for Yellow and Blue Crystals, and also requested the Great Sun and Great Moon Marks, and now, he was even coveting their Small Stone Race Armies.

Yang Kai quickly proposed, “I also have many Small Stone Race members with me, I can exchange them with you two.”

Although his Small Stone Race looked weak, if they were trained by these two, presumably they would turn into an elite army in a few hundred years at most.
