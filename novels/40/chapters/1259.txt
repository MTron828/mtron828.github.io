One of the items Yang Kai brought out was a metre-long crystalline bone that was about as thick as a baby’s arm. At first glance it was clear to see that this thing was extraordinary. The second item was a round bead the size of a pigeon egg. This bead was perfectly clear but there seemed to be a tiny green snake swimming about inside it, almost as if it was a living creature.

This little green snake also exuded a Soul fluctuation that while very weak contained an oppressive presence.

As soon as this round bead appeared, a resonant dragon roar came from Yang Kai’s body and at the same time, a different kind of pressure spread out from him.

Yang Yan looked up in amazement as she stared at Yang Kai, but soon her attention was attracted to the bone and round bead in front of her.

Looking closely, her expression changed once more as a series of extremely complex looks flashed across her face; sometimes there was surprise, sometimes there was suspicion, still other times there was shock...

After a long time, she took a deep breath, raised her eyes, and looked straight at Yang Kai.

“Were you able to see what these two things are?” Yang Kai felt that his lips had become a bit dry. Even though these things had been in his Space Ring for quite some time now, after taking them out again, he still could not help feeling a bit excited.

“Your luck is really amazing! You even managed to obtain a piece of Dragon Bone and a Dragon Bead. I really don’t know where you could have found these things inside the Flowing Flame Sand Field,” Yang Yan bit her red lips lightly. It was obvious that she too, was extremely excited, but she was forcefully suppressing her raging emotions.

“It really is a Dragon Bone and Dragon Bead?” Yang Kai looked overjoyed. Although he had suspected as much when he obtained these two things in the underground Saint Crystal lode, when Yang Yan confirmed it, he was still finding it difficult to believe.

“This is indeed a Dragon Bone and Dragon Bead!”

Yang Kai could not help grinning from happiness. Yang Yan also seemed to be happy, as if Yang Kai’s Heaven defying opportunities were her own, accompanying him in his foolish laughter for a time.

A while later, after Yang Yan and Yang Kai calmed down, the former asked, “What are you going to do with them?”

“Can they be refined into an artifact? I happen to be missing an offensive artifact!” Yang Kai already had a plan in mind, so he naturally asked immediately. Yang Kai didn’t care for offensive artifacts, even an Origin Grade High-Rank artifact may not necessarily be able to produce a more powerful attack than he could produce himself; as for Origin King Grade artifacts, with his current strength, he couldn’t properly active them, but now that he had obtained a piece of Dragon Bone and a Dragon Bead, if they could be refined into an offensive artifact, Yang Kai knew his combat effectiveness would rise greatly.

The Hundred Mountains Picture was not bad, but Yang Kai always felt a bit unsatisfied when using it.

“That.. would be difficult...” To Yang Kai’s surprise though, Yang Yan, who always seemed omnipotent in such matters, heard his request, and actually shook her head.

This made Yang Kai, who was looking forward to it, suddenly show a disappointed expression.

“I’m not saying that I can’t refine them into an artifact, but rather that doing so would reduce their value instead of promoting them.”

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai frowned and asked.

“This piece of Dragon Bone is from a True Dragon and has incredible power already within it. From the colour of the Dragon Soul in this Dragon Bead, it and the piece of bone should come from a Wood Attribute True Dragon. I don’t what kind of innate powers are stored inside these two things, but it can be said that they are already superb artifacts as is. If you let me refine them, it would only contaminate their natural auras and impede the flow of their power, reducing their overall might. Of course, if I were an Origin King Grade High-Rank Artifact Refiner, I would not have such concerns. Unfortunately, with my current level of skill, it would be exceedingly difficult to refine these two things perfectly!”

“So what should I do?” Yang Kai’s burning heat seemed to have been doused with a pot of cold water, calming him down in an instant. “Do I have to wait for you to grow into an Origin King Grade High-Rank Artifact Refiner?”

Yang Yan knit her brow and fell silent, seemingly immersed in thought for a while.

Some time later, she looked at Yang Kai and smiled, “Is the Saint Qi in your body Yang Attribute?”

“Not exactly, but it used to be,” Yang Kai shook his head slowly. Now that his Saint Qi had been transformed into the black Demonic Flame, Yang Kai could not quite tell what its attribute was, so he didn’t quite know how to answer Yang Yan’s question.

“Push your Saint Qi so I can see,” Yang Yan asked as her beautiful eyes stared at him.

Yang Kai quickly pushed his Saint Qi while transforming his Demonic Flame into a pure hot nature.

Yang Yan’s eyes lit up when she saw this and smile, “If it’s like this then there’s no problem. It seems your luck is really good, if this Dragon Bone and Dragon Bead had been obtained by another cultivator, they might have had to wait for me to grow into an Origin King Grade High-Rank Artifact Refiner before they could be processed into something useful, but since your Saint Qi is hot in nature, you can just refine it yourself.”

“Refining it myself?” Yang Kai stunned.

“En, refine it yourself. Doing so will result in great benefits, actually. With your current strength, although you can’t fully refine this thing, nor can you exert all of its power, as time passes and your cultivation grows, the power this Dragon Bone will be able to display will increase proportionally. When the time comes, it can even become an artifact connected directly with your Soul and life,” Yang Yan explained with excitement.

“But I’m not an Artifact Refiner, how am I supposed to refine it?” Yang Kai was still confused.

“There’s no need for you to be an Artifact Refiner because it is already a complete artifact that doesn’t require any enhancement. You only need to warm and nourish it. Here, I’ll give you a set of Secret Arts to use.”

“Just like that?” Yang Kai was overjoyed as his mood rose once more.

“Yeah, and you also have a Dragon Bead with a real Dragon Soul, if you can also refine the Dragon Soul and Dragon Bead into the Dragon Bone, hehe... I really can’t imagine what this Dragon Bone will look like at that time,” Yang Yan’s beautiful eyes shimmered brilliantly as a hint of obsession flashed across them. It seemed that she could not wait to see the scene after the Dragon Bone had been refined.

Finished what she had to explain, Yang Yan quickly passed the refinement method to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai listened and took down what Yang Yan said carefully, asking immediately when there was something he did not understand. Yang Yan explained everything patiently.

This refinement method was not difficult, so it only took Yang Kai two hours to memorize it. Now all he needed to do was spend some time to slowly comprehend it after which he could begin refining the Dragon Bone.

After teaching Yang Kai this Secret Art, Yang Yan thought for a while and said, “If you want to speed up things, I can let you borrow my Artifact Refining Furnace. Although my Artifact Refining Furnace is not very good, it will still be able to assist in the refinement process.”

“Artifact Refining Furnace?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, revealing a weird look, “I have one.”

“You have an Artifact Refining Furnace?” Yang Yan was stunned and quickly asked, “You’re not an Artifact Refiner, so why do you have an Artifact Refining Furnace?”

“En, I obtained it in the Flowing Flame Sand Field; moreover, it’s not an ordinary one,” Yang Kai said while taking out the tiny Artifact Refining Furnace.

When Yang Yan saw this little Artifact Refining Furnace, she did not show too much surprise, only feeling that the strange bird pattern on it was a little unusual. But while she was inspecting the quality of this Artifact Refining Furnace, the strange bird pattern came to life, swam across the surface of the furnace, then leapt off its surface and transformed into the Scarlet Firebird.

Immediately, the temperature in the stone room shot up as a pure Fire Attribute aura filled the air. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“An Artifact Spirit!” Yang Yan called out in alarm, covering her mouth as her beautiful eyes stared fixedly at the Artifact Spirit. Along with great shock, her face also showed nearly obsessive interest.

The Artifact Spirit also seemed to realize Yang Yan’s hot intentions and, after flying a quick circle, landed on Yang Kai’s shoulder. Its three long tail feathers trailed behind its body as it used its pointed beak to comb its wings, occasionally using its small eyes to cautiously observe Yang Yan, excluding its intelligence.

Yang Yan was stunned speechless and her eyes flashed with undisguised longing.

She suddenly realized that it was truly a loss for Yang Kai to not to be an Artifact Refiner.

He had an appropriate Saint Qi attribute and an extremely powerful Soul. On top of that, he had the best assistant in the form of the Stone Puppet and now even possessed an Artifact Refining Furnace with an Artifact Spirit. This Artifact Refining Furnace was also Origin King Grade...

It was so unfair!

When Yang Yan compared her possessions with Yang Kai’s, she suddenly found herself greatly discouraged.

This Artifact Spirit had obviously been conquered by Yang Kai, so even if she wanted this Artifact Refining Furnace, it was out of her reach. Once an Artifact Spirit was subdued, it was impossible for it to surrender to a second person unless the first died.

“With such an Artifact Refining Furnace to assist you, you’ll get twice the results with half the effort when refining the Dragon Bone, Dragon Bead, and Dragon Soul,” Yang Yan said sourly, glaring at Yang Kai with grudge filled eyes.

“Ahem... I actually collected a lot of Artifact Refining Furnaces on this trip, and several of them are even Origin King Grade.”

“Really?” Yang Yan’s spirits immediately lifted.

“En, but they all seem to be a bit damaged,” Yang Kai said while taking out the Artifact Refining Furnaces, he had collected in the Earth Lung Fire Pond, scattering them about the room.

Yang Yan’s jaw dropped and refused to close for quite some time, but after checking these Artifact Refining Furnaces one by one, a look of annoyance filled her face as she shouted, “How is this a ‘bit’ damage? It’s more like they’ve all be scrapped! How could they have been so recklessly burned?”

“Can they still be used?”

“I don’t know, but I’ll try my best to fix them,” Yang Yan waved her hand and put all the Artifact Refining Furnaces into her Space Ring.

Next, Yang Kai took out all his other gains from the Flowing Flame Sand Field one by one and handed all of them over to Yang Yan.

For example, a huge number of Fire Crystal Stones, the Brilliant Fire Crystal Essence, a Flowing Flame Flying Fire, etc.

Yang Kai had collected a total of nine Flowing Flame Flying Fires, so after giving one to Yang Yan, he had eight left. He wanted to know whether refining one of these would enhance the power of his Conflagrated Knowledge Sea.

The ancient map fragment Yang Kai obtained by killing Meng Hong Liang was also given to Yang Yan. As a result, she now had two of these map fragments in her possession, and although this was not enough to form a complete map, putting them together and researching them might yield some results.

The piece of crystal that Yang Kai obtained in the sixth layer which caused him to hallucinate was also recognized by Yang Yan. She said it was a naturally formed treasure called an Illusion Stone. She also received this crystal as it was the best material to arrange an Illusion Array with.

The twenty pieces of bamboo which took Yang Kai half a year to collect were also given to Yang Yan so she could find a way to make use of them.
