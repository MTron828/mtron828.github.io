In the wilderness, in front of the entrance to the Sealed World Bead, disguised as the place where an Ancient Demon Saint fell, Bao Qi sat cross-legged, alone, his eyes closed, as if he was waiting for someone. The swirling entrance that was visible earlier had now been hidden in the Void by Yang Kai, which caused it to be hard to detect if one wasn’t looking carefully. Only a Master at the Demon King Realm could feel the pure Demon Qi leaking from the Void.

Yang Kai and Sha Ya were missing at the moment.

After waiting for less than half a day, Bao Qi suddenly opened his eyes. Looking up into the sky in front of him, he pronounced in a deep voice, “Since you have already come, why hide?”

A strange laugh suddenly burst out from the void, followed by a black shadow appearing out of thin air. The newcomer was wrapped in pure Demon Qi, completely distorting their appearance, making it impossible to even identify their gender. The neither feminine nor masculine voice also seemed to contain a kind of power that made it sound as if it was coming from multiple directions

“Mo Ke Tuo!” Bao Qi narrowed his eyes and immediately recognized the identity of the person.

Shadow Demon Mo Ke Tuo! He was a peak level Master in the Shadow Demon Clan, and his true strength was even stronger than Bao Qi’s. The Shadow Demon Clan excelled in concealment and assassination, and as a Demon King, Mo Ke Tuo was one of the best.

Among all the Demon Kings, he may not be the most powerful, but he was definitely the most difficult to deal with.

Because once someone was targeted by him, even Demon Kings who were stronger than him would not dare to say that they could survive. He could always find the most appropriate timing and place to launch a sneak attack and send a fatal blow to the enemy.

Bao Qi did not expect that the first person to arrive here would be Shadow Demon Mo Ke Tuo and could not help feeling a little nervous. He was not afraid of fighting face-to-face with the other party, but this guy always came and went like the wind. If they really started a fight here, Bao Qi felt that he would be the one at a disadvantage.

“It seems that I have come early!” Mo Ke Tuo chuckled, seemingly an active person despite his penchant for concealment. Although Mo Ke Tuo’s body was wrapped in black Qi, Bao Qi could feel the former’s eyes staring at him, “You told me that this is the land where an Ancient Saint fell. Where is it? Why don’t I see anything?”

“It’s behind me. Look carefully.” Bao Qi remained calm and replied.

As expected, Mo Ke Tuo checked carefully and immediately found the hidden entrance. He could not help but be surprised, as he was obviously aware of the pure Demon Qi, “Are you sure this leads to where an Ancient Saint fell?” His tone suddenly became serious.

Bao Qi snorted, “Isn’t it obvious? What else could it be? Although I can’t guarantee anything, I think it’s highly likely.”

Mo Ke Tuo did not respond, seemingly agreeing with Bao Qi’s statement. No one dared to guarantee anything before entering, but the aura exuded by this hidden portal was really quite tempting.

“How did you find such a hidden place?” Mo Ke Tuo questioned casually, but Bao Qi knew that he was being cautious.

“This is inside my territory; I found it by accident.” Of course, Bao Qi was well prepared for such a question.

“You’re quite lucky, but since you found it, why didn’t you go in and see for yourself and instead invited me? If I’m not mistaken, you must have invited others too, right?”

“Of course, you’re not the only one.” Bao Qi replied slowly, “But I don’t know how many of them will come in the end; after all, this is the burial place of an Ancient Saint. Although the secrets to Sainthood may be hidden inside, there may also be fatal danger. I, Bao Qi, haven’t lived long enough and want to live a few more years, so I didn’t dare to go in alone.”

Mo Ke Tuo sneered with a little ridicule. He, who wrapped himself in black Qi, patrolled around and examined the entrance of the vortex.

Bao Qi continued, “You can go in if you wish and have a look now. I believe there should be no great danger with the abilities of your Shadow Demon Clan.”

He hoped that Mo Ke Tuo would not be able to withstand the temptation and go straight inside. As long as he went in, his life and death would no longer be his to control.

Mo Ke Tuo seemed to be a little moved by his proposal and stopped in place, pondered for a moment, but ultimately refused, “I think it’s better to wait for others to come over. Just like you haven’t lived long enough, neither have I.”

The land of a fallen Ancient Saint certainly contained some danger in it. How could he be willing to take the lead to explore for others?

“En,” Bao Qi did not persuade any further and just closed his eyes again to mediate.

Mo Ke Tuo walked a few more rounds as he had nothing to do, but soon he got bored and also sat down near Bao Qi like a shadow.

Over the next two days, more and more Demon Kings arrived one after another.

These Demon Kings were all Masters from their own Clans, and even though Bao Qi did not know them well, he was familiar with their names.

The number of visitors exceeded his expectation, which made him a little uneasy.

He thought it would be good enough to have ten people respond to his invitation; after all, the Demon Kings weren’t exactly free. Moreover, he was not close to some of them. However, a total of fifteen Demon Kings came after just two days, and most of them were stronger than him.

It seemed that he had underestimated the attraction of Sainthood.

[Can Sir Shaman Niu handle so many Demon Kings? He better not go for wool and come home shorn.]

Many Demon Kings gathered together at this place, and at this moment, the wilderness was saturated with Demon Qi. Every Demon King who came here would undoubtedly question Bao Qi about the situation here first, then check it for themselves. All of them would only remain after confirming that there was nothing wrong.

Bao Qi had to say that the portal created by Yang Kai was perfect, at least it did not arouse any suspicion from the Demon Kings.

It was rare for such Masters to gather together in one place, so naturally, there were Demon Kings who were close to each other who huddled in groups and loudly boasted about how many foreign Masters they had killed and how many foreign beauties they had captured. They were utterly immersed in bragging about themselves, and when there was a slight verbal conflict, they would put on a stance and looked like they were ready to break into a fight at any time.

Fortunately, everyone was quite restrained, so even if there were some conflicts, they would settle them with words rather than fighting with each other.

“Bao Qi, what are we waiting for?”

A fiery Demon King suddenly stood in front of Bao Qi, the hot flames coming from his body seemingly able to melt space. This guy looked different from other Demon Kings as his skin was notably red, resembling lava from a volcano.

Flame Demon Lai Wen! His strength was above the average among the Demon Kings present and was also well known for his impatience, clearly becoming agitated after waiting for the past two days.

The other Demon Kings’ gazes darted to Bao Qi with the same question in their eyes. Although Bao Qi’s strength was not the strongest among these Demon Kings, being average at best, this was his territory in the end. Furthermore, he was also the one who initiated this gathering to explore the Ancient Saint’s tomb, so everyone had to at least give him a little face.

Bao Qi looked around and announced, “The deadline for the agreed date is tomorrow, but since everyone is so anxious, let’s start now. Almost everyone is here anyway. Those guys who are not here yet are just unlucky. What do you think?”

Certainly, the Demon Kings had no problem with this. There were already fifteen Demon Kings here, so even if there really was any danger in this hidden land, they would be able to overcome it with their abilities. On top of that, the more people who came, the greater the competition would be. No one knew what would happen once they got inside.

Therefore, Bao Qi’s proposal was soon accepted by everyone.

Just when Bao Qi was about to continue, a charming voice called out from afar, “Oh, I’m late. Sorry.”

When the words fell, Sha Ya appeared in the vision of the Demon Kings and got close to them in a few steps.

Seeing that Sha Ya appeared just in time, Bao Qi secretly let out a sigh of relief. Their eyes met, and there was no need to communicate with words.

“Waste!” Someone bellowed as a gigantic skeleton suddenly stepped towards Sha Ya. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The skeleton did not possess any flesh, and instead of being the normal white, was pitch-black, as if it was painted in with a layer of black ink. Only a gloomy green ghost fire in his eyes added some colour to his form.

Bone Demon Fei Li!

As he spoke, he approached Sha Ya with a menacing aura.

This sudden change of situation surprised both Bao Qi and Sha Ya. They had no idea why Fei Li had such hatred for Sha Ya. Although the Charm Demons never had a very good impression, no one had heard of any grudge between Fei Li and Sha Ya.

Bao Qi cast an inquiring look at Sha Ya, but Sha Ya’s expression was filled with innocence.

Just as Sha Ya was hesitating, Fei Li appeared right in front of her, stretched out his huge skeletal hand, grabbed her slender white neck, and lifted her up high.

Sha Ya who was supposed to be a powerful Demon King, struggled like a weak child, seemingly suffocating from this strangling.

Sha Ya felt helpless. If it were another Demon King, perhaps she would still have some methods to save herself, but facing Bone Demon Fei Li who had no flesh and thus no physical desires, she had no ability to resist him at all.

The Charm Technique that she excelled at had no effect on Bone Demons.

“What… are you… doing?” Sha Ya asked with great difficulty. She looked pitiful, unable to get rid of his grip and her face was beginning to turn pale.

The surrounding Demon Kings watched indifferently, none of them showing any mercy to Sha Ya, because everyone knew that her pitiful appearance was nothing but a disguise.

“You failed to live up to the trust of the Demon Saints, yet you still have the face to live?” Fei Li’s pitch-black jaws opened and closed, emitting a strange, grating voice.

As soon as he mentioned this, Sha Ya and Bao Qi were taken aback and wondered whether the secret of them being subdued by Sir Shaman Niu was exposed, but it did not seem so, because if they were really exposed, Bao Qi would have long ago been attacked by the other Demon Kings here.

But if not, why did Fei Li pick on Sha Ya like this?

“What do you mean?” Sha Ya asked with a pale face. Part of it was due to Fei Li’s torture, but another part was the feeling of uneasiness from hiding her secrets.

“Fei Li, Sha Ya is still a Demon King, how did she fail to live up to the trust of the Demon Saints? Tell us if you know anything,” a Demon King took the initiative to ask.

The others turned their attention to Fei Li.

Fei Li just snorted coldly and disclosed, “The territory she ruled has fallen, and all three thousand of her subordinates were killed. Isn’t such a person trash? Doesn’t she deserve to die?
