!!

That said, Yang Kai still felt somewhat uneasy since, right now, no one knew what the Proprietress’ situation was.

Old Bai’s physical injuries had healed a lot thanks to his Wood Element Power and the healing pills he had taken. All remaining issues need to be taken care of slowly. Right now, the greatest problem he faced was the instability of the Small Universe in his body, but that required the Star Gathering Universe Pill to resolve.

Leaving Yue He to look after Old Bai, Yang Kai sent a Divine Sense transmission to Mo Mei, inquiring about the situation. Shortly afterwards, Mo Mei replied that the Star Gathering Universe Pill was being refined. While she didn’t know when it would be successfully completed, once the pill was ready, she would send it to Void Land immediately.

Yang Kai stood on the top of a certain Spirit Peak after breaking off the transmission with Mo Mei. Gazing at the sea of clouds, he sorted out his jumbled thoughts while his mind wandered.

The Proprietress was in trouble, and someone was trying to lure him out of Void Land, but in the face of this situation, he really did not have any good solution. Unless he acted like a shrinking turtle, he could not sit idly by.

However, if he really did rush out of Void Land, his enemy’s scheme would be successful.

After a long contemplation, Yang Kai’s gaze gradually hardened. His body flickered, and he suddenly disappeared.

By the time he reappeared, he had already arrived outside of a great palace, which was protected by layers of arrays. Entry into this part of the Void Land was forbidden for any uninvited person. Even its Open Heaven Realm Masters had to go around this place.

This couldn’t be helped, because this was the place where Zhu Jiu Yin cultivated in retreat.

Facing this palace, Yang Kai cupped his fist and shouted, “Senior, Junior Yang Kai requests an audience!”

There was no response.

Yang Kai shouted again, “Senior, I need to see you urgently, please show yourself!”

Even after calling for her three times in a row, Zhu Jiu Yin did not respond.

Yang Kai felt very annoyed. Although there were barriers here, Zhu Jiu Yin was incredibly powerful, so she certainly knew he was here. She must have also heard his voice; yet, she was not showing up. What did that mean? Ever since she came to Void Land, Zhu Jiu Yin had been living in seclusion, except for the last time when the Hundred Sects Alliance had come. Other than that time, she had basically not shown herself.

Normally, since Zhu Jiu Yin had taken such an attitude, Yang Kai would not impose himself on her. However, this time, since it was related to the safety of the Proprietress, he had no choice but to risk offending her.

Taking a deep breath, Yang Kai raised his hand and summoned the Azure Dragon Spear, its tip pointing forward. With a single thought, the Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array roared to life, making the entire Void Land buzz.

It had been three years since the last time the Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array had been activated, so while the Starlight Strength gathered in such a short period of time was not much, it was enough to support Yang Kai to activate it at least once!

The Azure Dragon Spear suddenly turned into a Great Dragon, shaking its head and flicking its tail. A high-pitched dragon roar resounded through the sky as Dragon Pressure filled the air. The giant dragon stared at the palace’s front door majestically, ready to pounce with its teeth and claws.

“You dare to display such impudence, you brat!?” Zhu Jiu Yin’s voice boomed in Yang Kai’s ears, and a slender figure entered his field of vision after the palace’s restriction disappeared.

Seeing her, Yang Kai hurriedly dispersed the power of the Grand Array and put away the Azure Dragon Spear. His action had made the Great Dragon disintegrated into thin air.

Zhu Jiu Yin looked at him with annoyance, “What madness possessed you to do this you smelly brat?”

Yang Kai’s face was slightly pale, and after taking a few sharp gasps for breath, he cupped his fist and said, “Please forgive me Senior, but the situation is urgent!”

Zhu Jiu Yin looked at him suspiciously, and frowned when she saw him so disturbed.

Last time, when the Hundred Sects Alliance had come, Yang Kai was as steady as a mountain, and did not send any messages to her, asking for help, until the very last moment. It was only when the two High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters suddenly showed up that Zhu Jiu Yin really took action.

What could have happened this time for him to appear so disturbed?

Faintly aware that the situation this time was probably not a small matter, Zhu Jiu Yin softly snorted, “Come in and talk.”

“Many thanks, Senior!” Yang Kai followed Zhu Jiu Yin into the palace after he cupped his fist.

After the guest and the host were seated, Yang Kai looked around and saw no sign of Shan Qing Luo. She was obviously cultivating in retreat. With Zhu Jiu Yin, a Divine Spirit of the same lineage as her, personally teaching her, Shan Qing Luo’s future cultivation path was not something Yang Kai needed to worry about.

“So? What is it?” Zhu Jiu Yin proactively asked.

Yang Kai organized his thoughts and told her briefly about what had happened to the Proprietress.

Zhu Jiu Yin listened to him completely before she snorted, “What the hell did you do to provoke so many people to deal with you? Last time, it was the Hundred Sects Alliance, and this time, it is clear that some group is targeting you. This Queen and that old turtle are present in Void Land, which is why they are using that Lan You Ruo as bait to lure you out. It is only because of your relationship with her.”

“What Senior says is true. Someone is trying to lure me out.” Yang Kai nodded.

Zhu Jiu Yin looked at him with amusement, “Since you know this, why don’t you just not go out?”

Yang Kai shook his head slowly, “I have to go.”

Since the mastermind behind this had told Old Bai to go to Void Land and inform him, it was clear that his target was Yang Kai. If Yang Kai did not show up, the crisis that the Proprietress was in would not be resolved. Furthermore, she would only be put into more danger. So, even though he knew that once he left Void Land, he would be stepping into a trap set by someone else, Yang Kai had to leap into it.

Zhu Jiu Yin looked up and down at him, “I didn’t know you were so foolish till now.”

Yang Kai quickly replied, “Senior, please don’t joke right now. This Junior is feeling really anxious.”

Zhu Jiu Yin laughed coldly, “What kind of bewitching soup did that woman feed you for you to even risk yourself to save her? Do you not know, if something happens to you, Luo’er will try to avenge you no matter what? With the inconsequential cultivation she has right now, it will be the same as impulsively jumping into death’s embrace. Even so, she will still do it.”

Yang Kai said, “Proprietress has shown great kindness to me. Now that she is in trouble, I can not sit idly by.”

Zhu Jiu Yin snickered, “Fool!”

Suddenly, she frowned and squinted at Yang Kai, “What are you doing here talking to this Queen then? I’m warning you, don’t get any ideas about bothering this Queen!”

Yang Kai said, “Since someone has set up such a trap, waiting for this Junior to throw himself in, I naturally cannot go unprepared. In all of Void Land, I can only rely on you, Senior, so I hope Senior can accompany me!”

“In your dreams!” Zhu Jiu Yin instantly snapped.

“Senior, please don’t forget that you are my Protector. You have sworn an oath on your Divine Spirit Source. If this Junior dies during this trip, you will be breaching your oath.”

Zhu Jiu Yin chuckled lightly and said, “Really? This Queen seems to recall there being many clauses in that oath, such as this Queen’s protection not extending to situations in which you cause trouble outside yourself and get killed? Ha, go ahead. This Queen will wait for the good news here in Void Land. Once you die, this Queen will be free! Just thinking about it certainly makes this Queen feel happy.”

Yang Kai said miserably, “Senior, I was the one who brought you out of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, out of that prisoner’s cage! You can’t just sit back and watch when I’m in trouble now!”

“When those two High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters attacked you last time, didn’t this Queen help? This Queen is your Protector, not your nanny. If you want to go around courting death, this Queen cannot stop you. Forget about this, this Queen will never agree to accompany you!”

Zhu Jiu Yin flicked her sleeve, “Get out, get out, don’t show this Queen your unlucky appearance! All it will do is bring misfortune!”

A strong force shoved Yang Kai, pushing him back.

Yang Kai gritted his teeth and shouted, “If Senior helps me this one time, ensuring that Proprietress is safe and sound, then I will consider Senior to have fully fulfilled her oath! From then on, Senior will regain her freedom!”

...

Zhu Jiu Yin’s movements paused, and her beautiful eyes glowed as she stared at him, “Is what you’re saying true?”

Yang Kai grit his teeth and said, “I always mean what I say!”

Zhu Jiu Yin was clearly moved. As long as she helped Yang Kai this time, she could be released from her oath, and for her, this was indeed a huge temptation. It would be a hassle for her to be a Protector for 1,000 years, especially since this brat in front of her had a propensity for stirring up trouble. She would not have to help this brat clean up after every mess he made.

But Zhu Jiu Yin slowly shook her head after pondering for only a little while, and declared, “No. Absolutely not!”

Yang Kai hurriedly asked, “Why?”

Zhu Jiu Yin grunted, “Do you think a Divine Spirit is invincible? This Queen’s strength has not yet been fully restored, and last time, they already tested this Queen’s depths. They would have obviously taken this Queen into consideration since they are targeting you. Perhaps the people targeting you have set up a terrifying trap outside, just waiting for this Queen to step into it!”

After saying this, Zhu Jiu Yin could not help but have a cold sweat, increasingly feeling a sense of an inexplicable crisis.

“I was almost deceived by your honeyed words, you damn brat!” Zhu Jiu Yin scolded furiously!

Yang Kai also snarled angrily, “Senior is so heartless, even refusing to grant this small favour!”

“Is this what you call a small favour!? Stop talking nonsense! You are asking this Queen to gamble with her life!”

“Fine then!” Yang Kai ground his teeth angrily, “Since Senior is so unwilling to help, this Junior will not force you. Just know that if this Junior really dies on this trip, Luo’er will become a widow, and we will see if she forever resents you or not!”

...

“Despicable little bastard!” Zhu Jiu Yin’s face turned red with rage, “Get out!”

With a flick of her hand, she drove Yang Kai out of the palace, causing him to tumble through the air for a few breaths before he slowly stabilized himself.

Glancing at the palace where Zhu Jiu Yin lived, Yang Kai heaved a heavy sigh. Even though he had been arguing so passionately with her just now, he was in no position to blame Zhu Jiu Yin for refusing his request. Zhu Jiu Yin was right. Her existence was already known to them, and this time, she would definitely be taken into account and targeted.

Even if Zhu Jiu Yin accompanied him, the other party may have the means to deal with her. However, right now, in Void Land, she and Bi Xi were the strongest Masters available. Yang Kai definitely needed their help to save the Proprietress.

After hitting a wall with Zhu Jiu Yin, Yang Kai turned his head towards the Dragon Sons’ Peak.
