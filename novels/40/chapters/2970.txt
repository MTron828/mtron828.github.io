“I really don’t know…” Zhu Qing whispered back in reply.

“Does this concern the secrets of the Dragon Clan?”

Zhu Qing shook her head.

“Then say it.” Extending his hand, Yang Kai carefully coaxed Zhu Qing into his palm, as though he was lifting the most exquisite porcelain, before saying in a threatening tone, “If you know the reason but do not report it, be careful about being disciplined by our Family Law.”

“What Family Law…” Zhu Qing’s eyes snapped wide open as a black look appeared on her face. Nevertheless, she quickly caught on to what Yang Kai meant, causing her entire body to turn flushed. Raising her head, she glared at him, only to discover that his eyes were wide open, while his breathing had turned rough. Sighing in her heart, she knew that this was a blessing and not a curse, though it couldn’t be avoided if it was a curse.

Using the book to cover her face, she whispered back, “The myriad of living creatures reject the Yin and embrace the Yang, when Yin and Yang merge, the Source will flow together, filling… one with energy.”

Yang Kai gawked before a strange look appeared on his face as he said in an ambiguous tone, “Are you saying…”

Zhu Qing’s face was now covered entirely by the book, leaving him unable to see the expression on her face. Nevertheless, he knew that her pretty face was definitely burning up at this very moment as she hastily replied, “I’m just casually speaking. Don’t treat it as a fact.”

“The Dragon Clan has also paid attention to dual cultivation?” Yang Kai’s smile grew wider, which appeared exceedingly malevolent in his dragon form, as though he could devour Zhu Qing in a single mouthful.

If this was really the case, the future days would really be too blissful.

“How is that possible, but…”

“But what?” Yang Kai extended a claw out and gently pushed Zhu Qing’s book down, while extending his head forwards, taking what seemed like a menacing stance.

With nowhere to hide, Zhu Qing finally replied in embarrassment, “But even for human women, their… virgin Yin Qi is extremely beneficial towards the cultivation of men, with the effect being increasingly obvious at higher realms of cultivation, much more that of a Dragon.”

Yang Kai replied, “Are you saying that I’ve grown stronger because… that was your first time?”

Zhu Qing nodded gently. She was feeling utterly embarrassed being forced by Yang Kai to say such words out loud, and could not help herself from wanting to dig a hole to hide in.

“So there will be no effect in the future?”

“No,” Zhu Qing shook her head decisively. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“I don’t believe it!” As he said that, Yang Kai grabbed Zhu Qing and scuttled in a direction. As he took big strides forwards, he dispelled the Dragon Transformation Secret Art, causing his gigantic body to rapidly shrink in size.

“What are you doing?” Zhu Qing exclaimed in shock.

“A test is needed to know if it works or not,” having returned to his original appearance, Yang Kai proceeded to lift Zhu Qing by her waist.

Pressed against his chest and feeling the fiery temperature of his body, Zhu Qing was instantly flustered as she hastily replied, “There really are no further results. I’m not lying to you!”

Yang Kai replied with a wide grin, “I already said to give it a try, so don’t struggle and resist, alright? It’s useless.”

As he said those words, he tossed Zhu Qing heavily onto the bed. She shrieked in response, while Yang Kai had already launched himself at her like a ravenous dog. Although she had experienced this before, Zhu Qing hadn’t adapted to it fully, resulting in the intense thumping of her chest as her heart appeared to be wanting to jump out at any given moment.

The male on top of her was extremely invasive, lunging right at her with reckless abandon, causing her weak defences to crumble and shatter apart with a bang.

As her clothes started to unravel, Zhu Qing tilted her head and closed her eyes tightly. Her hands gripped the sheets of the bed, as though she was about to enter the execution grounds, her entire being brimming with nervousness.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai seemed to have realized something as he turned his head to the side and pointed, before speaking a single word at a time, “Get… Out!”

The black puppy had been roused from its sleep, resulting in it quietly trying to doze off during these last few moments. It did not bark nor cause any trouble, and was extremely clever and obedient; however, right at this moment, it had raised its head and opened its eyes wide to stare towards the direction of the large bed. It did not move an inch, with its breathing sounds coming to a halt as it earnestly took in everything in sight.

The dog’s eyes gleamed with curiosity and a vacant look.

Upon hearing Yang Kai’s words, it whined as it stood up in reluctance, its tail hanging between its legs as it slowly walked towards the door.

Reaching the door, it still shot a longing glance back, its eyes filled with entreaty, as though it was begging Yang Kai to allow it to stay here.

Instead, Yang Kai replied with a snort, leaving it no choice but to push open the door dejectedly with its head. Slinking away through the crack between the doors, it still knew to close the doors properly after leaving.

At this moment, there were a few women of varying ages that stood outside of the palace, and every one of them appeared to have a layer of frost covering their faces.

These few princesses had basically had enough of this. A few days ago, Yang Kai had asked them to wait outside of the palace, leaving them no choice but to obey.

Never did they expect this to drag on for days, with not a single order coming their way this whole time. Yang Kai had also not dismissed them, leaving them no choice but to wait here like wooden poles anchored to the ground.

When did they, who were pampered throughout their entire lives, ever experience such humiliation? All of them were unleashing torrents of curses towards Yang Kai in their hearts, praying that he would die miserably and as soon as possible.

The only exception was the innocent and pure little princess, who did not have a single inkling about the entire matter that had happened. She only knew that her Imperial Father had ordered them to come over, listen to the orders from the man inside, and make sure to fulfil his every demand.

Being young and innocent, she had yet to be corrupted by the complicated issues present within the Imperial Family. Therefore, she was the only one that did not feel any grievances towards Yang Kai, with only feelings of boredom and tiredness surfacing within her after standing for the past few days. At this moment, she was dozing off while resting her head on one of her Elder Sister’s shoulders, her head rocking slightly, coming close to falling down onto the ground on a few occasions.

When the black puppy walked out, it was noticed by all of the princesses, instantly drawing their attention to look over towards it.

A look of hatred immediately appeared on the face of the Second Princess, Fu Yu, as she still vividly remembered the matter of this little bastard causing her to lose all face through a wardrobe malfunction a few days ago. Therefore, she was naturally incomparably hellbent on getting revenge, with her heart being filled with thoughts on how she would exact vengeance, like whether she should take the chance to capture this little bastard, chop him into little bits, and make a hotpot of him.

Seemingly sensing something, the black puppy turned its head towards Fu Yu, bared its fangs and let off a threatening growl at her, all while moving into a pouncing stance.

[Little bastard, if you dare act rampantly, I’ll make sure to kill you and eat your meat!] Fu Yu cursed out in her heart, while an ambiguous feeling of happiness surged through her entire body as images of her accomplishing that feat played through her mind.

Right at this moment, a cry of surprise suddenly rang out from within the palace.

The shout shocked all of the princesses, with all of them exchanging blank looks with each other, not knowing exactly what had happened within the palace.

The drowsy little princess was also shocked awake. Opening her eyes wide, she snapped to her senses faster than anyone else and asked in a fluster, “What happened?”

Nonetheless, no one bothered about her as the other princesses had perked their ears to listen for any follow-up sounds.

Yet another shout rang out, but this time, the group of ladies heard it clearly. However, this shout… seemed a little strange, as it did not sound like what one would let off when met with an incident. Instead, it sounded suppressed, somewhat raw, and almost like…

The faces of the few princesses turned red. Having clearly realized what this cry represented, how would they have the heart left to continue eavesdropping? On the contrary, they wished they could block their hearing out to prevent that sound from fouling their ears.

The stifled sounds grew increasingly clearer as they continued on, increasing and softening in varying intervals, sounding as though someone was dying.

Jumping in fright, the little princess’s face turned pale, “What’s happening? The voice sounds strange. Is someone in trouble? Should we go inside to take a look?”

Her questions left her Elder Sisters hanging between laughter and tears.

The Sixth Princess, who was standing by the little princess’s side, hastily replied, “You better not go in.”

“Why? Why can’t we go in?” The little princess wanted to get to the bottom of this mystery.

The Sixth Princess stamped her feet, “Little kids shouldn’t ask so much.”

“Ah… en,” the little princess nodded her head obediently. Although she could not wrap her head around the current situation, since her Sixth Sister had told her so, she definitely had her reasons to oppose. All of a sudden, she looked curiously at her other sisters and asked in a worried tone, “Second, Sixth, and Eleventh Sister, why are your faces so red? Are you all sick?”

The Eleventh Princess glared back at her and replied with an irritated tone, “What sick? When did we get sick?”

“But…” The little princess extended her little hand out and touched the Sixth Princess’ face, which resulted in her pulling her hand back in fright, “Your face is really hot, Sixth Sister! This is bad! Let’s go to Imperial Father to have him take a look.”

The Eleventh Princess shot a glare at the Sixth Princess, before covering her mouth to hide her grin, “There’s nothing Imperial Father can do for what your Sixth Sister is going through right now.”

“Then who should we see?”

The Eleventh Princess pouted, “She’ll be alright if you call the man inside to take a look at her.”

After finishing her words, she could not contain herself, letting a laugh slip out from her mouth, one so strong that it caused her waist to buckle as she shook like a willow in a gust.

“Then I’ll go call him over.” Believing everything she was told, the little princess strode forwards in an attempt to rush into the palace. However, after taking two steps forward, she hastily retreated, before speaking out in fear, “It sounds like he’s killing someone, right… I don’t dare to go in.”

The smile on the Eleventh Princess’ face grew even wider as a light flashed across her peach blossom-like eyes as she indicated towards the palace, “Of course he’s killing someone, but not just killing… he’s… eating someone.”

“E-E-Eating someone!” The little princess’s face drained of so much colour it turned into a shade that rivalled that of snow.

The Eleventh Princess continued on, “The man inside is an incorrigible tyrant, and he loves to eat tender little girls like you. If you get captured by him, he will first devour your fingers, then your nose, then your ears…”

As she spoke, she made a gnawing action, as though she was really chewing something, before wrapping it up with a look of satisfaction.

“Yee!” Terrified, the little princess immediately drilled herself into the bosom of the Sixth Princess, shivering as she replied in a trembling voice, “Sixth Sister, save me! I don’t want to get eaten! I don’t want to get eaten by him!”

“What are you scaring her for!” The Sixth Princess glared angrily at the Eleventh Princess, “Little sister is pure and naive, and believes anything people say, so what’s the point of telling her such a frightening tale.”

The Eleventh Princess shrugged her shoulders, “Since we’re all bored, I’m just trying to have a little fun. Haa… it’s really not fun to only hear but not participate in this colour-filled spring scenery.”

Fu Yu replied in a cold tone, “You can go in if you wish to participate, though I don’t know if they’ll welcome you or kill you.”

The Eleventh Princess said, “Forget it. It’s not good to provoke that fellow. As for me, I’m afraid even my bones won’t be left after he’s done eating me.”

Hearing those words, the little princess became increasingly frightened, causing her to hug the Sixth Princess tightly and cry, “Bring me away, Sixth Sister! I don’t want to be here! Save me, Imperial Father! Save me, Imperial Father! Wu wu wu!”

Fu Yu glared at her and growled, “Cover her ears.”

The Sixth Princess hastily extended her hands and covered the Little Princess’ ears tightly.

Sounds continued to ring out from the palace. In the beginning, it was somewhat subdued before becoming utterly unrestrained, causing the few princesses to feel exceedingly awkward. Fortunately, the Little Princess returned to snoozing within the Sixth Princess’s embrace, seemingly tired from the huge cry after being frightened. The tear stains which now marred her little sister’s face caused the Sixth Princess to feel sorry and angry for her, as well as forming an even worse impression of the man who was at fault for all this misery.
