In the Shattered Star Sea, cultivators could break through to the Emperor Realm. Every time the Shattered Star Sea opened, many would see through the profundities of the Emperor Realm here and jump over the dragon gate, reaching the sky in a single leap.

So, Yang Kai couldn’t help but wonder about this.

However, when he gave it a second thought, he realized that something wasn’t right, because while the energy fluctuations emitted were on the level of someone breaking through to the Emperor Realm, Yang Kai didn’t notice the World Energy Baptism that would accompany a breakthrough to a new Great Realm.

Since it wasn’t a breakthrough, could an Emperor Artifact be about to appear?

Realizing this, Yang Kai was surprised and he hurriedly turned and shot towards that direction.

He had heard that some very high-grade Emperor Artifacts would occasionally appear in the Shattered Star Sea, because it was not just Heaven Devouring Great Emperor who died in this place, many other Great Emperors had been buried with him.

Various treasures owned by the other Great Emperors, who had died in the Shattered Star Sea, were patiently waiting for the destined one to obtain them.

Therefore, all the Emperor Artifacts born in the Shattered Star Sea were of extraordinary significance and high value. They could cause countless people to fight for them.

The Emperor Artifacts of Great Emperors were completely different from ordinary Emperor Artifacts. If one really compared, the gap between them was equivalent to the difference between an Emperor Artifact and a Dao Source Grade Artifact. There was simply no comparison.

Naturally, nobody would miss such a good thing.

When Yang Kai was flying in the direction the Emperor Pressure was coming from, he suddenly felt the world around him tremble. Immediately after, an echoing sound like a morning bell came from the front. The sound waves were so concentrated that they were visible to the naked eyes. They swept away everything like a violent gust of wind and carried an extremely terrifying might.

Yang Kai’s expression drastically changed as he hurriedly flew down to the surface while carefully protecting his Soul.

*Hualala…*

The ground in the vicinity was completely flipped over and rolled like a wave, giving the illusion that this Star was about to shatter.

When the sound waves hit, Yang Kai suddenly became unstable; stars circled around his eyes and he was struck by dizziness. There were only the chimes of a huge bell ringing in his mind, making him lose his wits.

In shock, he quickly mobilized the power of his Soul Warming Lotus, supplementing and protecting his Knowledge Sea. Only then did he finally recover from the shock.

As he looked around again, Yang Kai gasped as the landscape had experienced tremendous changes. Several small peaks had actually risen from the ground while mountains that originally existed had ceased to exist. Countless abyss-like fissures had appeared on the ground, making for a daunting sight. The whole world seemed to have been shrouded in a haze all of a sudden.

Yang Kai was completely dumbfounded.

Such a terrifying might definitely couldn’t come from the cultivators who had entered the Shattered Star Sea for tempering. The only explanation was that an Emperor Artifact had appeared!

And this artifact definitely belonged to a Great Emperor. Yang Kai’s heartbeat quickened all of a sudden. He wiped the blood flowing from his nostrils and quickly rushed in the artifact’s direction like a bolt of lightning.

There were many people all around, and the sound of them cutting through the air was obvious. Clearly many cultivators were rushing there with the same intention as Yang Kai.

Yang Kai secretly cursed in his heart. None of the people who had come to the Shattered Star Sea were simple. Even if he had been slightly injured just now, he didn’t expect that no one had died from that deathly knell!

After a while, Yang Kai arrived not far away from the source of the sound. Hovering mid-air, he looked over and couldn’t help but shiver at the sight before him.

About a thousand meters away, a strange mountain entered Yang Kai’s vision. This mountain was about three hundred meters high and had a peculiar shape, almost like a giant bell placed on the ground.

Halfway up the mountain, shattered pieces of rocks kept rolling down, and from inside that mountain, dazzling brilliance and powerful Emperor Aura kept radiating.

“The Emperor Artifact!” Yang Kai’s pupils shrank as he immediately realized that the mountain was where the Emperor Artifact was hidden.

The other cultivators here were obviously aware of this too, but the might of the Emperor Artifact before had been too deadly, so even though they all came here, no one dared to act rashly.

And in front of the mountain, several mutilated corpses were lying on the ground at this moment. All of these corpses were bleeding from their seven orifices. It was quite a miserable sight, and judging by their appearances and the location of these deceased people, they should have been the first ones here. The person who discovered the Emperor Artifact encountered severe backlash when he tried to take it away, as a result, he was killed right then and there.

Suddenly, the brilliance of Star Seals glowed from these corpses. After their owners died, these Star Seals escaped and hovered mid-air, but right then, they seemed to be attracted by something as they flew towards cultivators in the vicinity. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

An extremely dazzling Star Seal among them actually flew toward Yang Kai’s direction.

How could Yang Kai miss such a good thing? His figure flickered as he welcomed the Star Seal.

At the same time, countless cultivators also made their moves, their gazes fixed on the free Star Seals, prompting them to snatch these prizes.

About seven or eight cultivators were eyeing the same Star Seal as Yang Kai, their cultivations all in the Third-Order Dao Source Realm.

They were fast, but Yang Kai wasn’t slow either.

Making use of his mastery of Space Principles, Yang Kai leapt ahead of the crowd and snatched the Star Seal.

But the moment the Star Seal entered his hand, a figure suddenly shot over towards him and reached out to grab his hand, grabbing his wrist right away. However, because the other party didn’t push their Source Qi and didn’t have the slightest malice, Yang Kai didn’t show much reaction.

[This guy is pretty fast!] Yang Kai was a little surprised, because he hadn’t noticed any threat from the person who was trying to rob his Star Seal, but now, it seemed that if he was a little slower, the Star Seal would have been snatched by this person.

This cultivator, who was only a step away from the Star Seal, was so fast that Yang Kai couldn’t keep up without using Space Principles to teleport.

Yang Kai looked up at the opposite party in surprise, but after seeing the opposite party’s face, he couldn’t help but speak with a grin, “We meet again.”

He found that the cultivator he was slightly concerned about, was none other than the so-called woman he had previously seen.

“It’s you again!” The young woman, after seeing that it was Yang Kai, frowned as an annoyed look appeared on her face, “Why are you stalking me? Why do you keep snatching my things wherever I go!”

Just recently, Yang Kai had snatched a Flaming Cloud Mushroom from her, and now he had robbed her of a Star Seal. Was this guy sent by the Heavens to snatch her things?

Yang Kai sheepishly grinned and stated, “Sister, you speak as if I have been chasing you. Rest assured, I’m not interested in women with small chests!”

After hearing this, the young woman’s face immediately turned cold and she clenched her teeth in anger. Both her top and bottom weren’t well defined, and this was the biggest regret in her life. Now, when Yang Kai pointed it out right in front of her face, it would be strange if she looked happy.

“If you dare to talk nonsense, I’ll rip your tongue out!” The girl said with hatred.

Yang Kai smiled and stated, “Then you should let go of my hand first. If you keep doing this, I’m going to act indecently!”

The woman let out a snort after hearing this and she retracted her hand, turning around before flying down and landing.

The other oncoming cultivators, who failed to grab the Star Seal, looked at Yang Kai in amazement. There was an extremely strange look on all of their faces.

Seeing Yang Kai turn his gaze towards them, all of them shuddered and their faces turned pale as they involuntarily took a few steps back, creating a distance between them.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, unaware of why these people were reacting like this, but in the next moment, he suddenly realized and explained himself with a straight face, “She’s a woman. What, did you think I’m interested in men?”

Everyone’s face turned pale after hearing this and they scampered off in haste.

Yang Kai’s face turned black after he realised that they all thought that he would use his sword to attack them.

He scanned the surroundings with an unhappy look on his face, but in the next moment, he had no intention of worrying about these trivial details and instead excitedly focused his gaze in one direction. On that side, a familiar figure was vying for a Star Seal with several others. His means were extremely ruthless and his cultivation was unmatched. Even though his rivals were all Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators as well, they were clearly not this man’s opponent and were being beaten black and blue.

Yin Le Sheng!

Yang Kai had never imagined meeting Yin Le Sheng would be so easy. Even though he inferred that Yin Le Shen was on this Star through the clues revealed by Zhong Zhen Hong, Yang Kai had no idea where he was, exactly.

And right this moment, he actually saw Yin Le Sheng!

He was obviously attracted by the commotion here.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but have his emotions fluctuate. He thought about it a bit before he flew over, taking something out from his Space Ring and sticking it to his face before circulating his Source Qi.

In the blink of an eye, his appearance changed into that of a burly fellow, completely different from before.

This mask that could change his appearance was a prize he had obtained from Sang De’s Space Ring. In the Solitary Void Sealed World, Sang De relied on this artifact to change his appearance and leave Clear Sky City unnoticed. Otherwise, with his popularity, he would be unable to sneak away.

Even though Sang De wasn’t a good fellow, his Artifact Refining skills were extraordinary. The artifacts he personally refined were extremely effective. Even those close to Yang Kai couldn’t determine his identity while he was wearing this mask, unless they were an Emperor Realm Master and used their Divine Sense to probe him.

After finishing his disguise, Yang Kai felt a strange gaze cast at him.

Yang Kai turned to look and noticed that it was none other than that so-called woman.

She must have seen his actions.

Yang Kai didn’t care about it too much though and just smiled as he flew over to her side, cupped his fist politely, and asked, “I still didn’t get your name!”

The young woman furrowed her brow, appearing a little impatient. Nonetheless, she still replied, “Lan He!”

“So, it is Sister Lan He. This one is Yang Kai!”
