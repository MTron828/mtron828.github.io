“Please just agree to it.”

“Alright. Since you’ve said so, I won’t say no.”

It was then Duan Hong Chen nodded, “Work hard and continue to cultivate. Given your aptitude, you might be strong enough by then. In the future, we might have a chance to go to war together.”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai became excited as it would be an honour to go to war with a Great Emperor. However, he soon became puzzled. [Who is the enemy? Wu Kuang?]

However, he felt that something was amiss. Also, Duan Hong Chen appeared grim when he said those words earlier.

Then, he went on to tell Duan Hong Chen about the recent developments in Azure Sun Temple and what happened after the latter left Dragon Island. After a sigh, Duan Hong Chen said, “It’s a shame that a Dragon Clan member was killed.”

After that, he suddenly chided, “What do you mean it’s a shame? All members of the Dragon Clan should become food for me!”

“Will you shut up!?” Yang Kai looked disdainfully at him. [I was having a chat with Duan Hong Chen, why did you come out all of a sudden?]

Wu Kuang put on a wicked smile and took a look outside before asking, “Where’s your Stone Spirit, your Embodiment?”

“What do you want with it?” Yang Kai looked vigilantly at him. It wasn’t strange that Wu Kuang knew about his Embodiment because they had come across each other before. Moreover, his Embodiment had cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, so they shared a kind of invisible connection.

“Actually, my Heaven Devouring Battle Law isn’t suitable for Humans to cultivate, but it does suit those from the Stone Spirit clan surprisingly well. I thought that if you had brought him with you, I could have given him a gift. Since he isn’t here, forget it then.”

As soon as he finished his words, the Embodiment appeared out of thin air.

Fortunately, after absorbing Shi Huo’s Source, the Embodiment could shrink to the size of a Human now. Otherwise, this house wouldn’t be able to accommodate him.

“The Dao of Space is indeed wonderful.” Wu Kuang complimented him. He didn’t even realise how Yang Kai made the Embodiment appear, he just assumed that this young man had some kind of special storage artifact on him.

After the Embodiment appeared, he immediately felt Wu Kuang’s aura, so he became alarmed as the scarlet fires in his eyes flickered.

“He said he’ll give you something,” Yang Kai uttered.

Embodiment asked in a low voice, “What is it?”

In response, Yang Kai shrugged.

With a faint smile, Wu Kuang extended his hand towards the Embodiment, who hesitated for a moment but didn’t resist in the end. The next moment, Wu Kuang’s large hand was pressed against the Embodiment’s angular head as an amazing wave of energy was released, causing the Embodiment to be rooted to the spot.

Although Yang Kai appeared aloof, he was extremely alarmed in his heart. He had no idea what Wu Kuang was up to; however, he was ready to make a move if something went wrong. Nevertheless, from beginning to end, nothing seemed to have happened to his Embodiment.

A moment later, Wu Kuang withdrew his hand, upon which Yang Kai turned to look at the Embodiment, only to see that the latter had fallen into deep thought.

Yang Kai pushed his Divine Sense and immediately understood what his Embodiment had obtained from Wu Kuang. After all, the Embodiment was his Soul Clone, so there were no barriers in their communication with each other. If Yang Kai wanted, he could even feel everything his Embodiment could feel.

What he received was a vast amount of knowledge and insight into the Heaven Devouring Battle Law!

Wu Kuang had infused practically all his experience in cultivating the Heaven Devouring Battle Law into the Embodiment, which was more than just a generous gift. Wu Kuang was the one who created the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, so he was undoubtedly the most knowledgeable about it. His millennia of experience and insights into this Secret Art were an unimaginable treasure.

Nevertheless, he still passed everything to the Embodiment without any reservation.

Although Yang Kai had always been hostile towards Wu Kuang, he was still moved at this moment. [Is it a bribe to keep our mouths shut? However, this is indeed a hefty price to pay.]

It could be imagined that after his Embodiment comprehended this knowledge, it would be smooth sailing in his cultivation journey from then on. Perhaps he would become as powerful as Heaven Devouring Great Emperor one day, or even surpass him; after all, the Embodiment was initially a Stone Spirit, and he had already assimilated Shi Huo’s Source, so his starting point was much better than Wu Kuang’s.

Noticing that Yang Kai was both doubtful and shocked, Wu Kuang said with a grin, “Maybe one day we’ll stop being enemies and become friends instead.”

“Don’t even think about it!” Yang Kai snorted, but his tone had softened significantly.

It couldn’t be helped, as it was said that gifts blinded the eyes. He wasn’t a shameless man, so after obtaining huge benefits, he was too embarrassed to keep acting aggressive. However, it was impossible that they would go from enemies to friends because Wu Kuang was the most detested figure in the entire Star Boundary.

It was said that there were no eternal enemies, only eternal benefits, but what Wu Kuang had done was beyond the boundary of morality. Yang Kai would be out of his mind if he became friends with him.

“Nothing is constant. Who can say what will be in a hundred years, or a thousand,” Wu Kuang didn’t seem to mind either way.

Yang Kai stored his Embodiment and grinned, “Only if you’ll live until then.”

With a wicked gaze, he stared fixedly at Wu Kuang’s neck, as though he was pondering on where to start.

Then, his expression turned solemn as he said, “Wu Kuang, since you’re willing to change for the better, I’ll give you a chance to make up for the crimes you’ve committed.”

With a smile, Wu Kuang asked, “What is it? Just tell me.”

Yang Kai replied, “I want to return to my homeland, but I can’t find any way to do that. Since you’re an expert in this matter, tell me how I can go back to my own Star Field.”

This was the reason he still stepped into the house despite knowing that Wu Kuang was inside.

Wu Kuang had destroyed countless Star Fields before, so he was apparently familiar with the ways to move between Star Fields. If Yang Kai could get his guidance, it’d be better than if he searched around aimlessly.

“What Star Field are you from?” Wu Kuang asked.

“Heng Luo Star Field!”

Hearing that, Wu Kuang shook his head, “Never heard of it before.” He had been to countless Star Fields, but he had never bothered to find out their names. To him, all Lower Star Fields were just resources to him.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but be disappointed. After giving it a thought, he realized that if Wu Kuang had been to Heng Luo Star Field, Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, Purple Star, and Sword Union would already be in Wu Kuang’s stomach.

“If you want to return to a Lower Star Field from here, one of the ways is to pass through those Star Road Portals. The prerequisite is that the Star Field has a portal that’s connected to the Ancestral Domain. Apparently, you haven’t found it.”

“What about the other way?”

With a smile, Wu Kuang replied, “You’ll have to make use of the Star Field Source.”

“Star Field Source?” Yang Kai arched his brow as an idea flashed across his mind. It seemed important, but he couldn’t catch it.

“There’s a Star Source in every Star, so naturally, there’s also a Star Field Source in every Star Field. The difference is that a Star Source is hidden in a Cultivation Star. Anyone with enough power will stand a chance to refine it and become the Star Master. On the other hand, it’s much more difficult to look for a Star Field Source. A Star Field is extremely vast. Maybe a flower, a tree, someone you come across on the street, a rabbit running in the wild, an asteroid in the Starry Sky… Any of these could be the manifestation of the Star Field Source. The average person might not be able to discover it even if they see it. However, if you can refine it, you’ll take control of the Star Field and become its Master and its Guardian.”

Wu Kuang was speaking slowly, while Yang Kai was attentively listening to him as his eyes glinted. It wasn’t the first time he heard about Star Field Guardian. Someone had mentioned that title to him before.

In the past, when he left Heng Luo Star Field and headed to the Star Boundary, Yang Kai had made the decision to become the Guardian of Heng Luo Star Field one day.

“If you can become the Star Field’s Guardian, you’ll be able to sense the Star Field’s location no matter where you are. By then, you won’t need to exert any effort to travel to that Star Field from the Ancestral Domain.”

By then, Yang Kai would just have to think about the Star Field, and he’d be able to grasp the connection between them. In a calm manner, he uttered, “I see. Many thanks for your guidance.”

In his heart, he scolded himself for being an idiot. If he hadn’t come across Wu Kuang on this day and listened to him, he would have forgotten about the thing in his Knowledge Sea. The Star Chart!

In his Knowledge Sea, there was a massive Star Chart of the entire Heng Luo Star Field. It wasn’t a Star Chart that was drawn by a Star Chart Master to navigate through a Star Field. It was more like a mysterious inheritance.

He obtained it from a Star Chart Master not long after he first stepped into the Starry Sky from Tong Xuan Realm. At that time, the Starship he was aboard fell into a crisis and was torn apart. A Star Chart Master was killed in a place near Yang Kai, upon which a beam of light shot into Yang Kai’s mind. After that, the Star Chart of the entire Star Field suddenly appeared in his Knowledge Sea.

During his years in Heng Luo Star Field, it was the Star Chart in his Knowledge Sea that had given him directions countless times, which was why he was never lost in the Star Field.

In the past, there was a Master who broke into Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea using a kind of Soul Clone, and upon seeing the Star Chart, he exclaimed as though he had obtained an invaluable treasure. Unfortunately for him, he was captured and taken away by Yang Yan before he could obtain anything.

Previously, Yang Kai still couldn’t confirm what the Star Chart in his Knowledge Sea was. But now, he knew that it was the Star Field Source!

He still remembered that after he reached the Star Boundary, he was still somewhat connected to his homeland thanks to this Star Chart. However, as time passed, this connection weakened.

The very elusive Star Field Source had been residing in his own Knowledge Sea for years. With this thing in his mind, he could easily find the path back to Heng Luo Star Field.

Although he was over the moon, he still pretended to be nonchalant as he uttered dispassionately, “I’ll ask you one more question.”

“Go ahead.” Wu Kuang seemed to be in a good mood, which was why he didn’t mind Yang Kai asking so many questions.

“How do you avoid being rejected by the Heavenly Way?” Tens of thousands of years ago, Wu Kuang had destroyed countless Star Fields. Yang Kai didn’t think he could do it with just an Origin King Realm cultivation.

Since Wu Kuang was able to act as he pleased in those Star Fields, he must have used a power that exceeded the Origin King Realm. Perhaps he had even showcased all his power, but even though he was a Great Emperor, the Heavenly Way’s repulsion was no laughing matter. How was he not punished?

Wu Kuang explained, “Every time I visited a Star Field, the first thing I’d do is look for the Star Field Source. I didn’t care if I had to dig it up or simply snatch it from someone. After I refined the Star Field Source, I became Master of that Star Field, so why would I be rejected?”

At that instant, enlightenment dawned upon Yang Kai.

Just like how a Star Master could become the ruler of a Cultivation Star by refining its Source, a Star Field’s Master could take control of the entire Star Field by refining its Star Field Source, so being repelled by the World Principles of that Star Field would naturally become impossible.
