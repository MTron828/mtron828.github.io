Jia Si carefully observed Yang Kai’s reaction and suddenly thought of something, gulping as he proposed, “Young Master, there is one thing that this Jia might know. I wonder if I could speak about it?”

“Don’t waste my time if it’s nonsense!” Yang Kai stared at him coldly.

Jia Si nodded and continued, “One and a half months ago, Elder Ju Tian Qing visited Sir City Lord, then Sir City Lord left Earth City the next day.”

“Ju Tian Qing?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, “Who is he?”

Jia Si replied, “He is one of the Emperor Realm Elders of Brahma Holy Land. He has a close relationship with the City Lord.”

“Brahma Holy Land?” Yang Kai was surprised.

Yang Kai was well aware of Brahma Holy Land as it was one of the top Sects in the Eastern Territory. In terms of status, it was similar in position to Azure Sun Temple in the Southern Territory.

The two Holy Sons, Zhang Xian and Zhang Hao, who Yang Kai met in the Shattered Star Sea, were from Brahma Holy Land, and their aptitude in cultivation was indeed extraordinary. If it were not for their bad luck of encountering Yang Kai, perhaps they would have already broken through to the Emperor Realm in the Shattered Star Sea.

Ju Tian Qing was one of the ten Emperor Realm Elders of Brahma Holy Land. This Sect lived up to the prestige of being one of the top Sects in this territory as its overall strength was above Azure Sun Temple.

“What specific cultivation does Ju Tian Qing have?” Yang Kai vaguely had a hunch that this Ju Tian Qing had something to do with the matter of Gao Xue Ting.

“He is a First-Order Emperor,” Since Jia Si had already disclosed so much, there was no point trying to hide any information anymore. He just revealed everything he knew and was hoping to leave here as soon as possible. Judging from Yang Kai’s previous ability to crush a Dao Source Grade High-Rank shield with his bare hands, Jia Si knew that Yang Kai could kill him with a flick of his finger.

Jia Si did not think that his physique was tougher than that shield.

Yang Kai nodded, and raised his index finger, “One last question, do you know where Ju Tian Qing or Zu Hong are now?”

Jia Si wiped the cold sweat on his forehead and answered anxiously, “I don’t know anything about that!”

The chill in Yang Kai’s eyes turned horrifying.

Jia Si’s face paled in fright as he cried out dismally, “I really don’t know about it, Sir City Lord didn’t tell me anything before he left.” After a pause, he continued, “If Young Master really wants to know, this humble one can try to find out for you…”

“Find out for me?” Yang Kai snorted heavily, “How are you going to find out for me? Didn’t you just say that Zu Hong told you nothing when he left?”

“This humble one could try to probe the City Lord’s son or Madam City Lord, perhaps they might know something. If not, this humble one could still send a messenger to the disciples of Elder Ju. In all honesty, this humble one has a decent relationship with some of those disciples, and they might know where Elder Ju is.”

“How long do you need?” Yang Kai asked, his expression icy.

“Four hours… No, no, two hours is enough.”

Yang Kai instantly beamed, “Then I shall trouble you, Sir Jia. Go and come back quickly, I’ll wait for you here.”

Jia Si got up immediately and rushed outside without turning back, as if he was being chased.

However, after his first step, Yang Kai casually tapped his shoulder.

Jia Si’s face changed drastically and was petrified. He looked at Yang Kai, and only felt that that part of his body was burning with unbearable pain.

“Don’t be anxious. This is just a small Secret Technique of this Young Master. It won’t cause you any harm in the short term…” Yang Kai put on a harmless smile.

“And in the long term…” Jia Si’s voice trembled.

“If the mark left behind by the Secret Technique is not removed by this Young Master’s unique method within twenty-four hours, your bones will be separated, your meridians will be broken, and you will beg for death!” Yang Kai’s words sent chills down Jia Si’s spine, as if a cold wind blew from the depths of purgatory to surround him.

Jia Si’s face was as pale as a ghost’s, but he dared not to resist as Yang Kai showed him just how powerful an opponent he was. After being stunned for a moment, Jia Si flickered and flew off as swiftly as the wind.

Yang Kai summoned the waiter of the teahouse and asked him to serve a new pot of tea, so he could spend some time in leisure.

Jia Si returned in just about a stick of incense worth of time.

“So fast?” Yang Kai stared at him in amazement, praising him, “Sir Jia is quite exceptional. Given your performance in intelligence work, you must be the right-hand man of the City Lord.”

Jia Si smiled obsequiously, “It was just a coincidence. Sir City Lord left a message to Madam City Lord before his departure, so it was easy for me to obtain some information.”

“I can’t believe you can obtain the information from Madam City Lord personally. Tsk tsk, perhaps Sir City Lord wears a green hat?” Yang Kai looked at him with a knowing grin.

Jia Si hurriedly explained in terror, “Young Master, please don’t joke like this. It’s not what you think. This Jia just inquired about the information from a maidservant of Madam City Lord.”

“Alright,” Yang Kai replied lazily, and pressed on with a solemn face, “Tell me what I want to know.”

Jia Si reported, “Sir City Lord mentioned he would be going to the Dragon Bone Wilderness, but I’m not sure about his exact location.”

“Dragon Bone Wilderness!” A cold brilliance flashed across Yang Kai’s eyes.

Jia Si continued, “This Jia could only find out this much, it is impossible to obtain any more information. Young Master, can you…”

Yang Kai nodded and stood up, patting his shoulder casually as he said, “Understood. Goodbye.”

When the words fell, Yang Kai’s figure blurred and instantly disappeared.

Jia Si’s face changed drastically as he hurriedly asked, “What about the mark?”

However, there was not a trace of Yang Kai anymore. Jia Si began panicking like a cat jumping on hot bricks, secretly cursing Yang Kai for not keeping his promise.

But soon, he realized something was different. The burning sensation was gone. He examined himself with his Divine Sense and found that there was nothing abnormal about him anymore.

Only then did he realize that Yang Kai had probably removed the mark when he patted his shoulder.

Jia Si could not help shuddering in joy before he secretly rushed to the city gate, preparing to leave Earth City.

He revealed so much information to Yang Kai today, so no matter what the outcome was, he could no longer stay in Earth City. If the City Lord returned safe and sound, he would surely find out he had sold him out, and the punishment for the crime of leaking information would be unbearable.

Even if the City Lord never returned, he was afraid that Yang Kai would come back for him. For the sake of his own safety, it was better for him to run as far as he could. It would be best if he could escape the Eastern Territory and hide in one of the other three.

……

It did not take Yang Kai too much effort to find Zhang Ruo Xi and Lu Wen outside the city. After embarking on his boat, Yang Kai queried Lu Wen, “Where is the Dragon Bone Wilderness?”

Lu Wen pointed in a certain direction, “That way. It will take about two days to travel there.” After a pause, she asked in shock, “Is Elder Gao in the Dragon Bone Wilderness?”

“Most likely,” Yang Kai replied in a deep voice, “But her exact location is not clear. Is it a big region?”

“Big, very big!” Lu Wen nodded, “It is rumoured to have been an ancient battlefield. Many fell there and it is a place filled with Yin Qi. Many cultivators like to explore it and sometimes they find some ancient treasures if their luck is good, especially in the central region where it is possible to make a great fortune. The central region also has Yin Qi as dense as fog though, so not even ordinary Emperor Realm Masters easily approach it. Rumours say that the corpse of a True Dragon lies somewhere in the central region, hence it is called the Dragon Bone Wilderness.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows and grinned, “Then let’s go to the central region to take a look.”

The speed of the boat was superb. It was a Dao Source Grade High-Rank flight artifact. With the complement of Yang Kai Space Techniques, the boat flew across hundreds of kilometres in the blink of an eye, seemingly skipping along space.

In the beginning, Lu Wen did not notice this anomaly, but after she settled down, she quickly realized that the speed of the boat was unusually fast. She was amazed when she saw this and felt more confident about Yang Kai.

After half a day, Yang Kai had arrived at the Dragon Bone Wilderness. Below was a piece of lifeless, desolate land. There was a strange scene where Yin Qi was spinning like a whirlwind about a few kilometres away, and as if sensing the aura of the living nearby, it gathered together in a cluster.

This was just the periphery of the Dragon Bone Wilderness, where the Yin Qi was so weak that it diminished before even getting close to Yang Kai and his group.

Ignoring the mass of Yin Qi, Yang Kai spread out his Divine Sense like a vast ocean before he ventured deeper, examining every inch of this place.

He did not know if Gao Xue Ting was in the Dragon Bone wilderness, but he could only try his luck as it was the only clue he had now.

Half a day later, Yang Kai reached the central region of the Dragon Bone Wilderness.

Along the way, Yang Kai found that the Dragon Bone Wilderness was an exceptional place for cultivators to train and temper themselves. This would no doubt be an excellent training ground for him if he were still a Dao Source Realm cultivator; however, he had already broken through to the Emperor Realm, so there was no point for him to cultivate here.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai looked intently in a certain direction as if he had discovered something.

He sensed several powerful cultivators guarding a certain region, seemingly warning travellers not to enter this place. On top of that, Yang Kai noticed some odd energy fluctuations coming from that place.

Yang Kai could not help feeling suspicious about this and changed the direction in which he was flying.

“Who goes there?” Someone yelled before Yang Kai approached.

“Stop! Do not come any closer, otherwise don’t blame me for being impolite to you!” Another person threatened him.

Yang Kai ignored them and charged straight forward.

“Impudence!”

“Courting death!”

After a few roars, flashes of lights from Secret Techniques and various violent forces launched towards the boat.

Lu Wen’s face turned pale in fright and she almost fell over after losing her balance.

Zhang Ruo Xi, on the other hand, stood behind Yang Kai steadily, turning a blind eye to the attacks. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

*Hong Hong Hong… *

Several explosions were heard, but the impacts were not as the attackers had expected. On the contrary, they, who stood at the opposite side, screamed as if they had been attacked. They started to groan in pain, and a few of them even collapsed on the ground directly.

Lu Wen’s eyes widened with shock as she had not even seen exactly what Yang Kai had done.
