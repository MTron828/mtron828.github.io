“Twelfth-Order Monster Core!” Lou Chi was stunned. With a burning gaze, he took the Monster Core placed on the table and carefully studied it, nodding repeatedly, “It’s truly a Twelfth-Order Monster Core.”

Twelfth-Order Monster Cores! They were cores only produced in the bodies of Twelfth-Order Monster Beasts, and Twelfth-Order Monster Beasts were equivalent to Emperor Realm existences. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Even he, Lou Chi, was merely a First-Order Emperor Realm cultivator. If he really encountered a Twelfth-Order Monster Beast, then there was no saying who may win in that fight. If things went wrong, he may even die under the bloody claws of the Monster Beast.

It can be said that Twelfth-Order Monster Cores were rare materials throughout the Star Boundary. Weak cultivators couldn’t get them, and even if a Master were to obtain one, they wouldn’t sell it easily; after all, Monster Beast Cores have a wide range of uses, and its use in Alchemy alone was enough to get countless people fighting for them.

“But it’s a pity…” Lou Chi sighed.

Kang Si Ran asked, “What’s a pity?”

He was also shocked. Meeting Yang Kai again, he found that he suddenly didn’t recognize him that well anymore. Yang Kai came in, bringing such a large business deal, and now he even took out a Twelfth-Order Monster Core so casually. Fortunately, Yang Kai was still his same old self personality-wise.

Kang Si Ran still remembered the time when Yang Kai had just arrived in Maplewood City. Not to say that he was destitute, but poor was not an inaccurate description. How did he become so rich all of a sudden? Compared to Yang Kai, Kang Si Ran felt like he had simply been living the past decade in vain.

“Unfortunately, this is only the Monster Core of a Twelfth-Order Low-Rank Monster Beast, equivalent to a First-Order Emperor.” Lou Chi shook his head while stroking his beard.

The same Twelfth-Order Monster Core could have a world of difference in value and price depending on the rank of beast it came from. Just as the Emperor Realm has three Minor Realms, Monster Beast Cores had three different ranks in a single order, their value increasing dramatically with each rise in rank.

“So, how much is a Monster Core like this worth?” Yang Kai asked.

Lou Chi declared openly, “If sold to our chamber of commerce, the reserve price is two million High-Rank Source Crystals!”

“A fair price!” Yang Kai nodded lightly. For a Twelfth-Order Low-Rank Monster Core, this price really was about right.

“Of course, if you take it to our auction house, it’s possible to get as much as three million High-Rank Source Crystals.” Lou Chi smiled, “The business that little friend talked about before couldn’t be referring to this, right?”

This was indeed good business. Monster Cores of Twelfth-Order Monster Beasts were always in short supply, but a Low-Rank Monster Core wasn’t anything to marvel about. They may not be common, but they could still be encountered occasionally at auction houses.

“Then, what about this?” Yang Kai tossed something over.

Lou Chi caught it by instinct and studied it, his eyes turning wide at once, “This… This is…”

“Twelfth-Order High-Rank?” Kang Si Ran was also shocked.

If a Low-Rank Monster Core wasn’t here as a comparison, Kang Si Ran may not have the eyes to tell the difference, but when this Monster Core was compared with the previous one, just the aura it emitted alone was several times stronger than the previous.

This was definitely a Twelfth-Order High-Rank Monster Core!

That was equivalent to a core only producible by a Master in the Third-Order Emperor Realm.

“Little friend, where did you get this?” Lou Chi was completely roused and he stood up abruptly.

Yang Kai looked at him with a meaningful smile on his face.

The corners of Lou Chi’s mouth twitched awkwardly, “This Old Master has spoken out of turn.”

It was not his place to pry, and they also had clear rules in the chamber of commerce. If he were to break any of the rules, then he would be punished and may even be expelled even if he was a Vice President. Luo Chi was merely too shocked as he had never in his life had the opportunity to encounter a Twelfth-Order High-Rank Monster Core before.

His hand was clutching hard on that Monster Core at that moment, unwilling to let go.

“How much is this Monster Core worth?” Yang Kai asked.

“Ten million!” Lou Chi quickly answered, “At least ten million that is. If you put it up for auction, it could possibly fetch fifteen million!”

Yang Kai raised a brow. That was because the price difference between the High-Rank and Low-Rank Twelfth-Order Monster Cores was really quite large.

“So, what do you think about this business?” Yang Kai asked with a grin.

“A big deal indeed!” Lou Chi nodded earnestly. Both of the deals Yang Kai came here for totalled over ten million High-Rank Source Crystals in worth, which was enough for him to meet him personally. This was not a deal that he could casually come across. With these two deals under his name, Kang Si Ran’s reputation would definitely rise, leaving the rest of the Managers in this branch far behind him.

“But… How could this kind of business be a long-term collaboration?” Lou Chi frowned.

He would like to be able to work with Yang Kai for an extended period of time, but Twelfth-Order Monster Cores weren’t easy to obtain. Luo Chi had no idea where Yang Kai was able to get these two Monster Cores, but he may not be so lucky next time.

“From now on, I will trade two Twelfth-Order Monster Cores with Brother Kang each year with no limits on the grade, until Brother Kang leaves Maplewood City.”

Lou Chi smiled bitterly, “In the end, little friend still wants to keep Manager Kang in Maplewood City. It’s not that this Old Master is unwilling to help, and not that this Old Master doesn’t trust little friend either, but these are Twelfth-Order Monster Cores, how will little friend…”

Speaking up to this point, Lou Chi’s eyes suddenly went wide as he stared forward dumbfoundedly at the Monster Cores held between Yang Kai’s right-hand fingers. Each one of them, regardless of their size, colour, or aura, were exactly the same as the one that he took out in the beginning.

Then, when he looked at his left hand and saw a similar scene.

*Gudong…*

Even Lou Chi, who was used to the strong winds and big waves, couldn’t help but gulp at this moment.

He was about to take a closer look when Yang Kai flipped both his hands over, and the Monster Cores suddenly disappeared again.

“Are they all Twelfth-Order?” Lou Chi asked, head buzzing.

Yang Kai smiled, “Word of mouth is just a rumour, but seeing is believing. Hasn’t President Luo seen it himself?”

Lou Chi grew excited as he asked, “Little friend, is it possible for you to sell all the Monster Cores…”

“Absolutely not!” Yang Kai refused. Even though he had more Monster Cores than he could ever possibly use, he wouldn’t just sell them off all at once.

Lou Chi felt a burst of bitterness, but the Monster Cores belonged to someone else after all, and it was up to them whether they were willing to sell or not. He couldn’t just go up and snatch them from him.

After a long sigh, Lou Chi tried to make one last effort, “Little friend, if you can sell all of your Monster Cores to my chamber of commerce, then this Old Master will offer you a very good price.”

“Not selling!” Yang Kai waved his hand repeatedly.

Lou Chi was dismayed, but he suddenly collected himself, “Very well. Little friend does have the capital to cooperate in a long term exchange with my chamber of commerce.” From the Monster Cores that he had seen alone, there were eight pieces. Which was to say that this deal could last for at least four years.

“I will report this matter to the headquarters. As for what decisions they make, this Old Master is powerless to interfere.”

Yang Kai smiled, “President Luo is too modest. You are at least a Vice President and have some say in internal matters. What do you mean you can’t interfere? How about this, if I can collaborate long term with Brother Kang, then I can sell you two Twelfth-Order Monster Cores every half year. How does that sound?”

“Half a year, two pieces!” Lou Chi was stunned before his eyes narrowed and a big smile appeared on his face, “Good, please rest assured, little friend, this Old Master will make every effort to negotiate a favourable outcome regarding this matter.”

Yang Kai cupped his fists, “Then I shall trouble President Luo.”

“Happy to oblige. Please, continue your talk. This Old Master will go and settle the Space Spirit Crystals and Space Spirit Jade for little friend so as not to delay your business.” After saying that, he stood up and put the Twelfth-Order Monster Core he was holding into Kang Si Ran’s hand, transmitting a few words to him using his Divine Sense before leaving the room.

The doors were shut again, and holding the two Monster Cores, Kang Si Ran had a grateful expression on his face, “Brother Yang, thanks are not enough for this kindness. If there is anything this Kang can help you with in the future, please just say the word.”

Yang Kai waved his hand, “Don’t worry about it, Brother Kang. I am not doing this only for you, but also myself.”

Naturally, Kang Si Ran did not believe him and thought he was just being modest.

Yang Kai said, “I’ve recently founded a Sect, and it is still in its infancy, but I will have a high demand for various materials and resources in the future when it grows, so Violet Source Chamber of Commerce is going to be a very important partner for us. With Brother Kang here, I will definitely not suffer any losses when dealing with the Violet Source Chamber of Commerce.”

Kang Si Ran was astonished, “Brother Yang, you actually founded a Sect?”

This really astonished him. Even though Yang Kai was an Emperor Realm Master, not every Emperor had the capabilities to found a Sect. Firstly, they had to pick out a good spot, and they also needed a wide range of contacts and sufficient strength. They also had to recruit disciples and whatnot. It was a lot of difficult work.

“It’s nothing big!” Yang Kai smiled.

Kang Si Ran told him earnestly, “Rest assured, Brother Yang, if your noble Sect has any business you wish to conduct with the chamber of commerce in the future, then this Kang will certainly do his best for your sake.”

Yang Kai smiled, “I can rest assured with Brother Kang’s help. If at any time you find yourself unhappy with your current position, Brother Kang is always welcome in my Sect.”

Kang Si Ran grinned, “If your noble Sect was not going to collaborate with the chamber of commerce in the future, then I would go over right now!”

But if Yang Kai’s Sect was going to establish a channel of cooperation with Violet Source Chamber of Commerce in the future, it would naturally be better for Yang Kai if Kang Si Ran stayed where he was.

After chatting for a while, Kang Si Ran said, “Before the President left just now, he told me that if Brother Yang is willing to sell these two Monster Cores now, we will offer a price of thirteen million Source Crystals for them.”

Yang Kai told him, “Naturally, I brought these Monster Cores out to sell. Could there be any other way to sell them?”

Kang Si Ran answered, “Since this is our first collaboration, the President told me that he will make things simple for you. You can either sell them directly to us, or you can have us auction them for you, but you won’t have that option again in the future.”

Yang Kai responded without hesitation, “Then I’ll just sell it to you directly.”

Even though he may lose a bit this way compared to them being auctioned off, he would still have to shell out some amount in fees if he entrusts the matter to the chamber of commerce. In that case, the amount he gained from selling the Monster Cores wouldn’t be that different.

Since he wanted to help Kang Si Ran, Yang Kai naturally wouldn’t be greedy for those small benefits.

“Good!” Kang Si Ran nodded, “It just so happens that there’s an auction happening tomorrow night. These two Monster Cores should fetch a good price. As for the Source Crystals for the sale, Brother Yang…”

Yang Kai told him, “Just count it towards the purchase of the Space Spirit Crystal and Space Spirit Jade.”

“Very well!” Kang Si Ran nodded. The way Yang Kai agreed so quickly to the matter made him realize that Yang Kai’s wealth may be even more terrifying than he originally thought. If that wasn’t the case, he wouldn’t be so casual when handling tens of millions of High-Rank Source Crystals.

“By the way, Brother Kang. There’s something I wish to ask.”

Kang Si Ran answered, “Please, Brother Yang!”

“Will there be any Artifact Armors for sale in tomorrow’s auction?”
