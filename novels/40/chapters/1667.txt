Chapter 1667, Artifact Spirit’s Transformation

“Young Master Yang, where is the Heavenly Thunder Fire now?” Luo Li asked curiously.

Yang Kai pointed to the magma below, “It’s still inside right now, but it won’t be around much longer.”

Luo Li’s body shook as terrified light flashed across her beautiful eyes.

She naturally knew how powerful the Heavenly Thunder Fire was, but listening to the meaning of Yang Kai’s words, he seemed to have found a way to completely extinguish it, a development beyond Luo Li’s expectations.

Originally, she believed that Yang Kai merely had some kind of ability which he could use to hold back the Heavenly Thunder Fire, allowing her to freely deal with Brilliant Flame Sect.

As such, once she was done processing the remnants of Brilliant Flame Sect, she immediately rushed to this place to assist Yang Kai.

Never had she imagined that there would be nothing more for her to do here.

“Young Master Yang’s methods are truly astonishing, this Queen is incredibly impressed,” Luo Li spoke with sincere admiration. Even if she had acted personally, she was not confident she could destroy this strange flame, but Yang Kai apparently had this ability.

“Senior is too polite.”

“Since everything is settled here, this Queen won’t linger. If Young Hero has free time in the future, please accept my open invitation to Ice Heart Valley as a guest. Ice Heart Valley will offer Young Hero a fitting welcome.”

“If there is a chance,” Yang Kai replied in a noncommittal manner.

Luo Li nodded lightly before departing quickly.

After Luo Li left, another person flew down from the volcanic crater and, with a burst of refreshing icy air, arrived by Yang Kai’s side, sitting down.

Naturally, it was Su Yan.

Yang Kai turned his head, reached out, and grabbed one of her delicate hands, holding it in his own appreciatively.

Su Yan did not speak, simply smiling lightly as she turned to look at the rolling magma in front of her while leaning her head on Yang Kai’s shoulder with a satisfied look on her face.

It seemed the Senior Sister and Junior Brother pair simply wanted to spend some quiet time together.

“Junior Brother, where are we going next?” After a long silence, Su Yan asked.

“To Shadowed Star.”

“Shadowed Star? Where is that?”

“Shadowed Star is extremely far away, but it has a much better environment than today’s Tong Xuan Realm. Although there is a strange World Principle suppression there, it is suitable for everyone from Tong Xuan Realm to grow and develop. I founded High Heaven Sect there on a cultivation paradise...”

Yang Kai began describing the various aspects of Shadowed Star one by one, causing Su Yan to feel a sense of yearning.

The Star Field was incredibly vast, filled with wonders, but to her, it didn’t really matter where she went. As long as she could accompany the man beside her, even the ends of the universe could be a warm home.

At this moment, Su Yan felt a sense of satisfaction she never experienced before.

The battle between the Firebird and Heavenly Thunder Fire lingered on for quite some time.

Yang Kai and Su Yan waited next to the volcanic crater for half a month, but still, the battle down below had not been decided.

Bing Long came at one point and handed Yang Kai a large number of Space Rings filled with an astonishing amount of wealth which formerly belonged to Brilliant Flame Sect. There were many precious ores, herbs, artifacts, pills, and Secret Arts, Martial Skills, and billions of Saint Crystals.

Ice Heart Valley was able to wipe out Brilliant Flame Sect in one fell swoop thanks to Yang Kai, so they did not take sole possession of Brilliant Flame Sect’s wealth. After receiving instructions from Luo Li, Bing Long personally divided this huge harvest in half, one part going to Ice Heart Valley while the other was given to Yang Kai exclusively!

Naturally, this was a gesture of goodwill from Ice Heart Valley that was meant to ease the relationship between them and Yang Kai.

Yang Kai understood this and did not refuse, readily accepting the Space Rings.

Now that he was bringing over ten thousand of his friends and family to Shadowed Star, he would need an extraordinary amount of cultivation resources to support them. This wealth from Brilliant Flame Sect was enough to support those from Tong Xuan Realm for ten or twenty years without any difficulty.

Although Yang Kai had not left the volcanic crater after he arrived, he could still detect the movements of those from Ice Heart Valley.

After Brilliant Flame Sect was eliminated, Brilliant Flame Mountain Range became a treasured land without any owner, but since Ice Heart Valley’s disciples all cultivated Ice Attribute Secret Arts, they were not going to open a branch here.

Nevertheless, there were many Sects attached to Ice Heart Valley, so they had several of them migrate to Brilliant Flame Mountain Range to occupy this cultivation paradise.

All of this had nothing to do with Yang Kai as he was simply a passerby to Scarlet Wave Star.

While they waited, Yang Kai and Su Yan had plenty to talk about, sharing their respective experiences from the past thirty years, from the stunning adventures to the trivial occurrences.

From time to time, they would sit in meditation to cultivate as well.

The two found that when they cultivate together, their rate of cultivation increased ten-fold compared to when they were alone.

Saint Qi flowed between them and merged together, forming an endless cycle that rapidly drew in the surrounding World Energy to strengthen themselves.

Time flew by and soon another half a month passed.

While they were cultivating today, Yang Kai and Su Yan both sensed something and simultaneously opened their eyes before turning their gazes down.

Below, the originally tumbling and roaring magma was rapidly calming down and the terrifying heat which filled the air began to abate. Even the liquid magma was solidifying at a rate visible to the naked eye.

Obviously, something was absorbing all the Fire Attribute energy in this volcanic crater.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he had a vague guess in his heart about what was happening, raising his expectations greatly.

After half a day, the situation became more obvious as the temperature in the volcanic crater dropped to a normal level where even an ordinary mortal who had never cultivated would not feel much discomfort.

The tumbling magma in front of him had already become semi-solidified.

Suddenly, a stream of aura rapidly rose from the depths.

This aura was very familiar to Yang Kai and when he sensed it, a smile appeared on his face.

*Xiu...*

A red light blasted out from below and a Firebird with a ten-metre wingspan suddenly flew up into the air.

Its entire body was a dazzling fiery red while purple streaks of lightning flashed across its surface, giving it a domineering and devastating aura.

Yang Kai raised his brow as he looked at the radiant Firebird in surprise, secretly feeling shocked by the intensity of the aura it gave off.

The Firebird had undoubtedly successfully swallowed the Heavenly Thunder Fire and obtained a quantitative evolution, but the increase in its strength was actually quite shocking, possibly ten times more than before.

Yang Kai felt a pressure from the Firebird now comparable to an ordinary Origin King.

Was the Firebird now comparable to an Origin King? Yang Kai could not help smiling happily thinking so.

*Li...*

The Firebird raised its head high and released a resounding cry, seemingly extremely excited.

Immediately after, its figure began to distort, its wings folding in as its body underwent a rapid and dramatic transformation.

Soon, a beautiful young woman with fiery hair appeared in front of Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was dumbfounded!

The beauty that appeared in front of him was so dazzling it was somewhat unbelievable. Her delicate face was dotted with elegant features, without the slightest flaw, and her slender willow brows, dazzling eyes, and tender lips which had a shimmering ruby ​​lustre easily provoked the imagination.

Her figure was also extremely provocative, full in all the right places while slender in all the others, complimented perfectly with two long, beautiful legs. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Most noticeable was the highly exposed way she dressed.

She wore a fiery red armour which only covered her most sensitive places while revealing much of her thighs and lower abdomen.

Her seductive neckline, flat abdomen, and delicate belly button were all exposed to the air, as was much of her beautiful legs along with her snow-white jade feet which lightly stepped through the air, enchanting all who bore witness to them.

Yang Kai suddenly felt a little dizzy.

Su Yan also covered her mouth with her small hands in surprise, but immediately thinking of something, she shot Yang Kai a light smile as a profound light flashed across her eyes.

“You... you... how did you become like this?” Yang Kai pointed at the evolved Firebird in a somewhat incoherent manner.

“Greetings, Master!” The Firebird suddenly saluted Yang Kai elegantly and spoke in a clear voice.

Her voice and expression were cold and indifferent, a clear contrast to her scorching hot figure.

Moreover, her voice seemed to contain an aura of destruction and killing intent while her dark red eyes burned like flames.

Gazing into her eyes, Yang Kai faintly felt he saw a world of flames that could incinerate one’s Soul if they stared too long.

“You... can talk?” Yang Kai was even more shocked, his mouth hanging agape.

The Firebird nodded, thought for a moment, then explained, “After consuming that guy, I suddenly discovered I could speak. Why, does master not like this me?”

“Am I supposed to?” Yang Kai brow furrowed as he caught a glimpse of Su Yan staring at him with interest from the corner of his eye, making him feel a little guilty.

“It should... I have been following Master for many years and felt that my current appearance should match very well with Master’s interests, so...”

“Shut up!” Yang Kai roared frantically as he took a deep breath, turned to Su Yan, and declared solemnly, “This is slander, pure slander! Senior Sister, don’t take her seriously.”

Su Yan smiled lightly and said, “Naturally, I believe in Junior Brother.”

“It seems... I was mistaken,” Firebird thought about it for a while before sincerely admitting her wrongs. After completing this, she turned to Su Yan and bowed with a serious expression, “Greetings, Madam.”

[Seems her vision is sharp, at least!] Yang Kai cast an approving look towards the Firebird.

Su Yan pursed her lips and giggled, walking forward as she took the Firebird’s hand and said, “You don’t need to be so polite. Your current image is not old, so from now on, we will be sisters. En, you said you have followed Junior Brother for many years, so you must be very clear about all he’s done these years. If we have time, we should have a good chat.”

“Master probably wouldn’t want me to expose his private affairs, especially with regards to certain women,” Firebird frowned and replied, appearing somewhat reluctant.

Yang Kai’s face became as black as the bottom of a pot.

He suddenly discovered that the Firebird who was obedient to him and did not know how to talk was more likeable.

The current Firebird’s sentience had advanced greatly, and her strength had soared, but why did it feel like he had lost something in the process?

“By the way, Junior Brother, she now has a human form, so does she have a name?” Su Yan did not try to dig into these trivial matters and suddenly asked.

Yang Kai shook his head and turned to the Firebird to ask, “Do you want a name?”

A strange brilliance flashed across the Firebird’s eyes and she quickly nodded, “Please bestow me a name, Master!”

Possessing a true name was a special privilege that only existences which had achieved a certain level of sentience could possess, in other words, only those that had true names could be considered true, independent beings!

“En, then from now on your name will be Liu Yan,” Yang Kai did not think much before replying.
