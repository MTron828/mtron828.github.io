The sighs of the Senior Sisters of two different generations reuniting with their Junior Sisters after all this time was really touching.

The disciples of Ice Heart Valley were all quite emotional. Looking here and there, soon everyone’s eyes turned moist one by one, as if they were infected by the atmosphere. All of them sheathed their swords and quietly stood on their spot.

“Cough…” Yang Kai loosened his readied fist and lightly coughed, instantly attracting everyone’s attention.

“Right, Seventh Junior Sister, I came back together with Honoured Master,” startled, Ji Yao said to the petite figure with a look of joy on her face.

“Sister Zhang Sun, we meet again,” Yang Kai called out with a light smile.

The petite figure was none other than Bing Yun’s Seventh Disciple, Zhang Sun Ying, whom Yang Kai had met a couple years back.

Zhang Sun Ying looked at Yang Kai and cried out in surprise, “Senior Brother Yang, how come you’re here?”

She was very surprised, but that was understandable as she was reunited with Ji Yao after a very long time. Being totally absorbed in her joy, she had forgotten to pay attention to anything else and only now did she realize that her Third Senior Sister actually came together with Yang Kai.

She addressed Yang Kai as Senior Brother, not because Yang Kai’s cultivation was higher than hers. She was a First-Order Emperor, and furthermore, when she first met Yang Kai a few years ago, he was just a Third-Order Dao Source Realm.

She addressed him as such out of respect.

After all, Bing Yun was able to escape from the Solitary Void Sealed World and return to Ice Heart Valley mostly because of Yang Kai. After hearing about this, Bing Yun’s Disciples were all very grateful to Yang Kai and began addressing him as Senior Brother as a courtesy.

“Sister Zhang Sun, am I not welcome here?” Yang Kai asked with a slight grin.

Zhang Sun Yin immediately blushed and replied, “When did I say that!? Senior Brother Yang has done a great service to my Ice Heart Valley, so why would Senior Brother Yang be not welcomed? Honoured Master has already exhorted us to treat Senior Brother Yang as family.”

“Senior Bing Yun’s care is much appreciated,” Yang Kai gently nodded.

Ji Yao furrowed her brow deeply, staring at Yang Kai in confusion, puzzlement slowly creeping into her eyes.

In her mind, Yang Kai was her Honoured Master, Bing Yun, but now, when she heard Yang Kai speaking such words, she couldn’t help feeling confused and unable to understand what was happening.

Yang Kai, noticing her change, solemnly asked, “Is Senior Bing Yun free? I have to see her regarding something.”

Zhang Sun Yin hurriedly replied, “Honoured Master hasn’t entered retreat recently. If she learns that you are here and that Third Senior Sister has also returned, she will definitely be very happy… follow me!”

Saying so, she pulled Ji Yao’s arm, leading the way ahead.

Yang Kai, carrying Ming Hui in one hand, walked a few steps before turning around and beckoning, “Tian He, you come too, let’s go and meet your Honoured Master.”

Shi Tian He’s tender figure trembled as a restless look appeared on her face.

“Junior Sister, don’t be afraid. I will accompany you,” Yu Dan patted the back of Shi Tian He’s hand and stated in a gentle voice. Feeling this hand, Shi Tian He finally calmed down a little, before she and Yu Dan followed after Yang Kai.

Halfway there, Shi Tian He anxiously asked, “Senior Sister, is Honoured Master still angry with me after all these years?”

Yu Dan sincerely nodded, “Of course.”

Shi Tian He immediately turned pale, feeling her legs grow heavy as if they were filled with lead, making it impossible for her to move forward.

Yu Dan, on the other hand, mysteriously smiled and added, “Back then, you didn’t hesitate to disobey to go with that guy surnamed Dong, so of course Honoured Master will be angry; after all, she personally taught you for many years. Is she not allowed to be angry after you disobeyed her?”

Shi Tian He bitterly admitted, “Yes, this Junior Sister has disappointed Honoured Master.”

Yu Dan added, “But don’t worry, Honoured Master’s anger aside, she has still been thinking about you all these years.”

“Really!?” She Tian He was overjoyed.

Yu Dan replied in a low voice, “In the past hundred years, I was ordered to visit Serenity City every two years to inquire about your situation and check if you had been wronged in any way.”

Shi Tian He’s figure trembled and excitedly asked, “Did Honoured Master order you to do so?”

Yu Dan replied, smiling wryly, “Without Honoured Master’s order, who would dare to go? Honoured Master said that if you were wronged even once in the Dong Family, no matter how slight the offence was, she would destroy them completely. It might look as if Honoured Master hasn’t cared for you over these hundred years, but in fact, you have been on her mind all the while.”

Hearing this, Shi Tian He’s eyes turned red and she almost cried again. Only after persistent comforting from Yu Dan did she finally calm down.

…..

In the main hall of Ice Heart Valley, Yang Kai sat upright in a rigid fashion while Ji Yao and Shi Tian He stood behind him. As for Ming Hui, he was still unconscious and laid on the ground by Yang Kai’s feet. Yu Dan, who accompanied Shi Tian He, was secretly communicating with her Junior Sister via Divine Sense.

Zhang Sun Ying, after offering tea, stated, “Senior Brother Yang, please wait a moment. Honoured Master has already been notified and will be here soon.”

“She already is,” Yang Kai’s expression changed as he turned to the hall’s entrance.

He immediately noticed a flash, and the next moment, Bing Yun had appeared. Closely following behind her were Ice Heart Valley’s Emperor Realm Masters, ten of them in total.

First Disciple An Ruo Yun, Second Disciple Sun Yun Xiu, and the others were standing in single file.

Yang Kai quickly got up and greeted, cupping his fist, “Yang Kai greets Senior Bing Yun!”

Bing Yun replied, smiling, “You’re here!”

Even though the two had not been in contact for a long time, because they both came from the Heng Luo Star Field, they felt much closer to each other than others. At this moment, Bing Yun was very happy to see Yang Kai.

“Greetings, Senior Brother Yang!” The disciples behind Bing Yun hurriedly greeted.

Yang Kai nodded before gazing at everyone, looking at Liu Xian Yun and Fan Xin before turning his gaze to Zi Yu. Now, Zi Yu was also an Emperor Realm cultivator. She had entered the Shattered Star Sea with Yang Kai, gained an opportunity, and broken through during that time.

As their gazes met, Zi Yu lightly nodded to Yang Kai, her eyes filled with gratitude.

In the Shattered Star Sea, her breakthrough was imminent but she had also attracted the covetous eyes of her enemies. The Ice Heart Valley disciples by her side had not been strong enough to protect her at the time, but her breakthrough to the Emperor Realm still went smoothly. Only after she finished her breakthrough did she learn from her fellow Sisters that Yang Kai had appeared at the critical moment and lured the enemy away, giving her a safe and stable environment to advance.

This favour alone was enough to make Zi Yu grateful, let alone the fact that Yang Kai and Ice Heart Valley had an intricate relationship. There was also the close ties he had with Ancestral Founder Bing Yun.

Liu Xian Yun was equally excited. She hadn’t seen Yang Kai for several years, but after seeing him this time, she naturally had much to say to him, but she knew that now was not the time.

“I heard that Yao’er returned?” Bing Yun looked around as she asked, quickly noticing a dumbstruck Ji Yao standing there.

“Third Junior Sister!”

“Third Senior Sister!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

An Ruo Yun and the others also cried in excitement.

Ji Yao, on the other hand, stood there in a daze, her eyes filled with confusion. But staring at Bing Yun, the confusion in her eyes slowly became more and more obvious, as if dark clouds were blocking her vision.

“Third Junior Sister, why are you in a daze, why aren’t you greeting Honoured Master!” An Ruo Yun didn’t know what happened, so she just thought Ji Yao was overwhelmed with emotions and quickly reminded her.

Bing Yun, on the other hand, noticed that something was amiss and turned to Yang Kai to ask, “What’s wrong with Yao’er?”

Yang Kai hurriedly informed her via Divine Sense Message about Ji Yao’s current condition. He also didn’t hide the fact that he had been pretending to be her.

Yang Kai’s report broke Bing Yun’s heart. Ji Yao had suffered for many years in the Ancient Wild Lands, so much so that she even lost her mind. If Yang Kai hadn’t found her by chance, it was quite possible she would still be wandering the Ancient Lands aimlessly.

Bing Yun softly sighed before she called out with a face full of gentleness, “Yao’er, your Master is here, can’t you come over?”

“Honoured Master…” Ji Yao tenderly shouted, hearing this. Her figure quivered and her pupils shook violently, the confusion in her eyes shattering at that moment before regaining clarity.

*Pu…*

Ji Yao opened her mouth and spurted a mouthful of black blood, causing her aura to immediately wane while her eyes regained a kind of lucid brightness.

An Ruo Yun and the others were shocked at the sight of this as they had no idea what was wrong with Ji Yao.

“Honoured Master!” Ji Yao’s figure flickered as she suddenly rushed to Bing Yun, kneeled down and greeted in a trembling voice, “This unworthy Disciple has caused Honoured Master to be worried.”

Bing Yun stretched her hand out and lightly stroked her head, “It’s good that you are back, it’s really good. Get up.”

Ji Yao shook her head and kept crying, holding Bing Yun’s thigh tightly as if she was never going to let go.

An Ruo Yun and the others also wiped the tears from the corners of their eyes.

Bing Yun helplessly stated, “You and I are Master and Disciple, we should be happy to be meeting again after so long, so don’t cry, get up and talk.”

She held Ji Yao and pulled her up gently, personally wiping her tears before handing her to An Ruo Yun. Afterwards, she turned to Yang Kai and continued, “We’ve shown you something embarrassing. Yao’er has been stubborn since childhood, so I ask you not to pay it any mind.”

Yang Kai denied, shaking his head, “Yao’er, she… cough cough, Junior Sister Ji Yao just acts on her emotions.”

He had gotten used to calling her Yao’er during their time together and almost addressed her wrongly.

At that prompt, Ji Yao turned to look at Yang Kai with a complicated expression. After seeing the real Bing Yun, she had sobered thoroughly. Whether she would remain this way or lose her mind later remained to be seen, but at least for now, she was safe and sound.

Because she had fully regained her faculties though, she also finally realized how bad her previous state was.

She had misidentified a man as her Honoured Master. If this hadn’t happened to her personally, Ji Yao would have never believed it.

Yang Kai felt a little guilty and didn’t dare meet her gaze, instead shifting his eyes about in an awkward fashion.

“Sit down and talk, don’t keep standing,” Bing Yun proposed in a good mood. Her Third Disciple, who had been missing for so long, had returned to the Sect. Yang Kai was also back. It was a joyous event, so a rare smile appeared on Bing Yun’s face.

The disciples were overjoyed after seeing this.

They hadn’t seen Bing Yun smile at all these past few years; but today, they finally saw the beautiful moon after the dark clouds had cleared up, lightening the worries in their hearts.

An Ruo Yun, receiving a Divine Sense Message from Bing Yun, didn’t dare to let Ji Yao remain too far away from her. Naturally, she made her sit by her so that she could take good care of her.

“Senior Brother Yang, did you hear about our Ice Heart Valley’s situation and come here on purpose?” After taking her seat, Sun Yun Xiu asked as she curiously looked at Yang Kai. If he wasn’t here because of this, then his timing was too coincidental.

Yang Kai replied, shaking his head, “It wasn’t intentional. I happened to run into Junior Sister Ji Yao in the Ancient Wild Lands by accident and was just planning to escort her back. Certain events happened while we were passing through Serenity City though, and only then did we come to know about the current situation of Ice Heart Valley.”
