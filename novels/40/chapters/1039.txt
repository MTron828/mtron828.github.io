Chapter 1039, This Transaction Must Be Cancelled

As the battle continued, the Saint King Realm master pushed himself to his limit, using all his best Martial Skills and artifacts, yet he was still unable to defeat much less kill Yang Kai.

Over the course of the battle, Yang Kai not only didn’t retreat but instead became even more aggressive, his eyes filling with radiance as a joyful look appeared on his face!

He was enjoying himself. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Fighting an evenly matched opponent, going all out to out to kill one another knowing only one of them would be able to emerge victoriously, this rush made Yang Kai truly feel alive.

Seeing this crazed expression on his opponent’s face, the Saint King Realm master couldn’t help shivering slightly.

By now, he had comprehended Yang Kai’s real intentions here; this young man was actually using this battle to explore the depths of his own strength! The two Third-Order Saints he had killed before were just something he had done because it was convenient.

Realizing this, this Saint King master finally panicked and his courage gave out, his instincts screaming at him to escape from this insane and terrifying youth.

*Hong Hong Hong...*

As their strengths collided with one another in a series of explosions, Yang Kai and the First Order Saint King separated from each other, breaking away from the range of each other’s strikes, gasping for breath as they stared at one another across a hundred-meter gap.

The sound of joints cracking came from Yang Kai’s body as he flexed his physique, his Saint Qi welling up as a half-full look appeared on his face.

Opposite him, the Saint King Realm cultivator wore a bleak look as he struggled to support his bloody and exhausted body.

He couldn’t help staring at Yang Kai in horror as he saw the minor wounds on his body recover at a rate visible to the naked eye. At the same time, he noted that the blood covering this youth was actually giving off a dazzling golden glow.

He actually possessed golden blood!

The eyes of this cultivator stared dumbfounded at this incredible scene.

He didn’t know what kind of Secret Art this youth had cultivated to produce blood of this colour but he could tell that the abnormal vitality and resilience of his body stemmed from this golden blood.

It was thanks to this golden blood that this youth’s wounds healed so quickly.

The Saint King master quickly realized he was not this young man’s opponent as he simply didn’t possess such astonishing recovery ability. If they continued to fight, he would definitely die.

He actually still had a trump card he could play, a forbidden technique that would instantly raise his combat power significantly, allowing him to continue the fight.

But he didn’t dare to use it.

Because once he used this forbidden technique, his condition would rapidly deteriorate, and even his current realm might fall, damaging his foundation and preventing him from ever advancing again. He was already half-dead from this battle, if he really used his forbidden technique, even if he won, the cost would be too high.

The most important factor though was that even if he used this forbidden technique, he wasn’t confident he could triumph.

Just who was this boy? When did such a fearful character appear?

He was thoroughly confused and shocked by the power Yang Kai displayed.

Therefore, while continuing to stare at Yang Kai, he began withdrawing, his face filled with vigilance as he worried about this youth refusing to compromise.

Only after he retreated to what he considered a safe distance did he summon his Star Shuttle and shout out to Yang Kai, “Little brat, you’ll pay for your actions today! There will be no place on Water Moon Star where you can take shelter!”

His voice came from far away as his figure disappeared across the horizon.

Yang Kai’s face remained indifferent, seemingly having no intention to pursue, just standing in the same place while staring at this fading back.

However, while he remained still, a thread of his Divine Sense broke through the fetters of space and leapt forward and latched onto the fleeing Saint King.

Immediately after, Yang Kai stretched out his hand and tore the space in front of him.

A couple hundred kilometres away, the Saint King Realm master who was still escaping was working hard to extinguish the remaining clusters of Demonic Flame covering him.

While he was fighting Yang Kai, dealing with these Demonic Flames had forced him to consume a lot of his Saint Qi. If not, he wouldn’t have ended up in such a miserable state.

This Demonic Flame was something he had never even heard of before, much less experienced. Hot and cold coexisting, Yin and Yang mutually promoting one another, it was a combination filled with contradictions and he was unable to extinguish it easily, forcing him to continue consuming his own Saint Qi to resist it while he pushed his speed to its limits, hoping to return to the mountain valley as soon as possible and ask his Seniors for assistance.

There was no trace of the strange young man behind him, fortunately, so he felt that he had made a clean getaway and began wracking his brain to come up with an excuse to explain his defeat.

Just as he was contemplating this issue though, the space in front of him suddenly twisted, causing him to think his exhaustion was bad to the point where he was seeing things.

However, as he stared at it, this distortion in space only grew bigger, and soon, the space in front of him shattered like a broken mirror, and in the next moment, a giant crack appeared before him, like the great maw of an invisible beast.

From inside the crack, a figure emerged with a playful grin upon its face, seemingly having anticipated his arrival.

Seeing the face of this person, the man’s expression paled as if he had seen a ghost. He was unable to believe his eyes.

It was actually the young man he had just been fighting with!

This youth reached out and grabbed him while he was still in a daze and before the Saint King master could respond, he was tossed into the Void. Immediately after, the crack in space rapidly began to close as the young man stood outside and waved to him.

As the profound darkness engulfed him, the Saint King Realm master instantly felt like he had been sunk into a frigid swap as the turbulent forces around him dragged him under.

He roared and struggled frantically but was unable to escape and could only accept his fate.

Outside, Yang Kai dismissed his Demon God Transformation and after letting out a long breath, his expression becoming dignified.

After such an intense battle, he had come to understand where his current limits stood.

He could battle against a First Order Saint King, and after using his Demon God Transformation, he did not need to fear such an opponent.

He wasn’t clear however how he would fare against a Second-Order Saint King.

This fight had yielded other harvest as well, allowing Yang Kai to familiarize himself with his new power. He now fully comprehended how terrifying his Demonic Flame was.

However, what he was currently most concerned about was why these three people had chased him down in the first place. What exactly was it that he saw that he wasn’t supposed to?

It seemed like this group was simply transporting supplies, although their choice of location to complete this transaction was somewhat remote.

Yang Kai didn’t understand and couldn’t be bothered thinking deeply about it, so he simply summoned his Star Shuttle and quickly flew off.

Half a day later, inside the remote mountain valley that Yang Kai had passed by before, all the materials had been loaded onto the Starship, and a middle-aged man who had been talking and laughing with the handsome young man said with a smile, “Young Master Xue Yue, it’s been a pleasure doing business with you. If there is another good opportunity like this in the future, I hope Young Master Xue Yue can remember us. We will pay you a satisfactory price!”

The young man called Xue Yue’s smiled and nodded his face as refreshing as a spring breeze, causing the people around him to involuntarily feel a sense of warmth and kindness from it. Wherever his eyes drifted, the female cultivators, regardless of their age or strength, would all show intoxicated looks as they stared towards him.

There was no doubt that as long as this Young Master Xue Yue beckoned to them, these women would willingly throw themselves on him.

“We’ll take our leave then. Farewell, Young Master Xue Yue!” The middle-aged man said with a smile before waving to his subordinates and walking towards the Starship, many of them women who belonged to his crew wearing reluctant expression, all of them repeatedly glancing back towards Xue Yue.

At that moment, a Saint King Realm cultivator hurried over to Xue Yue’s side and whispered something into his ear in a dignified voice.

Xue Yue’s smile instantly went stiff as he whispered back, “Are you certain?”

“Positive, their two bodies were found five hundred kilometres away, and there is no sign of the other. It’s more than likely he too suffered disaster. Young Master, I’m afraid this time’s transaction has been fully seen by that bystander.”

Xue Yue’s pair of crystal clear eyes flashed a sharp light before he nodded, “I understand.”

Saying so, he took a step forward and shouted, “Wait a moment!”

The happily satisfied middle-aged man who was preparing to return home, came to an abrupt halt and turned to face Xue Yue, asking in confusion, “What instructions does Young Master Xue Yue have?”

Xue Yue continued smiling lightly as he said, “Although I’m very sorry about having to do this now, this transaction must be cancelled. En, you can’t carry off these materials.”

“Cancelled?” The middle-aged man frowned, a slightly disgruntled look flashing across his face briefly before he forced out a grin and asked, “Young Master Xue Yue, surely you must be joking. Money and goods have been exchanged and this transaction is already completed, yet now you say it must be cancelled?”

Xue Yue smiled and nodded as if it was only natural and declared, “If I say it’s cancelled, it’s cancelled.”

This young man’s blatant arrogance, not putting anyone in his eyes, irked the middle-aged man greatly and he couldn’t help but laugh, “You’ll have to excuse me, Young Master Xue Yue. Since the transaction has been completed, I am not ready to return the merchandise. These things are constantly in short supply so their value cannot be measured by mere money. En, you take care, I hope we’ll have an opportunity to cooperate again next time.”

“There will be no next time,” Xue Yue slowly shook his head, his smile was not fading at all, still causing everyone present to feel the refreshing atmosphere and involuntarily lower their guard, “These goods must remain, and... you as well!”

When this sentence came out, the middle-aged man’s expression changed greatly and a foreboding sense of fear suddenly shrouded his whole body.

The cultivator concealing his appearance in a large robe standing behind Xue Yue suddenly flickered and appeared in front of the middle-aged man, raising his hand and gently patting the top of his head. A strange force flooded into the middle-aged man and in an instant, all his bones shattered, along with his five viscera and six organs, his vitality quickly disappearing from his body.

“Origin Returning Realm...” Staring at the robed man standing in front of him, the middle-aged man called out in despair as the light faded from his eyes.

His death caused a huge panic, and the Starship and surrounding area were immediately plunged into a sea of screams.

The man hiding his figure slowly walked into the Starship, killing every cultivator he came across as easily as if he was stepping on a group of ants.

A short time later, he calmly walked out and reported to Xue Yue, “One hundred and thirty-five people, all dead!”

“En,” Xue Yue nodded lightly, waving to his subordinate and shouting, “Gather up the materials and take them all away!”

“Young Master, what about this Starship?” One of his subordinates asked, the materials could be carried off, but this Starship was obviously too big to fit inside a Space Ring and it remaining behind would definitely attract unwanted attention.

“Toss it somewhere into Second Brother’s territory. His subordinates haven’t been very peaceful as of late, they seem to have gotten into a fight with a group of outsiders,” Xue Yue faintly ordered.

“Yes!” The group of subordinates responded before getting to work.
