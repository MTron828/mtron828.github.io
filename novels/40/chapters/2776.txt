Indeed, the title of Elder of Azure Sun Temple had great utility. It would be an utter fantasy for anyone else to even attempt to obtain the Supreme Divine Water from Zhang Da Shan’s hands as he wasn’t that much of an idiot to simply offer a precious treasure like the Supreme Divine Water to others on a whim.

It was precisely due to Yang Kai’s status as an Elder of Azure Sun Temple that he had chosen to believe the latter.

Seeing Yang Kai’s figure disappear without a trace, Zhang Da Shan was overwhelmed with excitement and apprehension.

He was excited about the possibility of forging a connection with Grandmaster Ji Ying through this matter. This would allow him to benefit from this relationship should he need to request Emperor Pills in the future. The apprehension he felt stemmed from the unknown success of the refining of the Emperor Pill this time round.

Even an Emperor Alchemist had a certain percentage chance of failure whenever they took action. If it failed, the herbs that he had painstakingly collected would be completely destroyed, meaning he wasted the five years of his life that he had spent collecting them!

As Zhang Da Shan moved along this train of thought, he was shocked once again as he patted his leg in annoyance. Earlier, due to being overwhelmed by his emotions, he had forgotten to inform Yang Kai about the pill he desired. Nevertheless, after further consideration, with Grandmaster Ji Ying’s insight and Alchemical prowess, it shouldn’t be difficult to deduce the type of Spirit Pill to refine from the herbs that he had prepared.

As the day passed, Zhang Da Shan waited impatiently, feeling as though an entire year had gone by.

All of a sudden, a streak of light came shooting over from the distance. Zhang Da Shan’s mind shook as he raised his eyes to look over.

Yang Kai’s figure reappeared, and with a casual toss, threw a jade bottle over. With a faint smile, he said, “Fortunately, I did not fail my mission!”

Emotions surged crazily in Zhang Da Shan’s heart upon hearing that. Receiving the jade bottle, he opened it up to take a look. Indeed, he saw six gleaming, smooth, and round Emperor Pills within. Taking a whiff of the pill fragrance, he immediately felt his mind relax and his soul enter a harmonious state.

He let off a laugh, and replied in a sincere tone as a look of gratitude appeared on his face, “Many thanks, Elder Yang.”

If not for Yang Kai’s connections, how would it have been possible for him to obtain these Spirit Pills in just a day? According to Zhang Da Shan’s estimates, he would have to first head to the headquarters of the Violet Source Chamber of Commerce to seek out Grandmaster Huang Fu, gift the Supreme Divine Water to him, then wait at least a few months before being able to obtain the Spirit Pills from him.

Furthermore, three to four Spirit Pills would be the maximum amount he would obtain.

Truly worthy of being the Disciple of the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor! Grandmaster Ji Ying’s prowess in Alchemy left Grandmaster Huang Fu in the dust. Zhang Da Shan could not help but rejoice that he was fortunate enough for Yang Kai to send a message to him yesterday, and fortunately, he had believed in Yang Kai. If not, how would he have benefited from such a wondrous matter?

At this moment, he naturally felt extreme gratitude towards Yang Kai.

“You’re too courteous, Sect Master Zhang. We both obtained what we wanted, that’s all,” Yang Kai smiled faintly and cupped his fists, “Safe travels!”

“Please wait, Elder Yang!” Zhang Da Shan suddenly raised his hand and shouted.

Looking back, Yang Kai replied, “What is it, Sect Master Zhang?”

A somewhat sheepish look appeared on Zhang Da Shan’s face, “This Zhang wishes to ask Elder Yang, if this Zhang wishes to seek Alchemy services in the future…”

Yang Kai smiled, “Please do not hesitate to find me in Azure Sun Temple.”

In any case, with Ji Ying putting in the effort, any Emperor Pill could be easily refined. Furthermore, he could even obtain some commission from it.

Zhang Da Shan was ecstatic, “Many thanks, Elder Yang.”

Yang Kai nodded his head, and with a flicker, returned back the way he came.

……

Azure Sun Temple, Spirit Jade Peak, the residence of Vice Temple Master Qiu Ran.

“Senior Brother Qiu, I’m here!” Yang Kai shouted out after barging inside. Very quickly, he noticed Qiu Ran seated quietly within, appearing as though he was waiting for the former to arrive.

“Hm, your expression doesn’t look too good, Senior Brother Qiu.” Yang Kai looked at Qiu Ran in surprise.

With a gloomy look, Qiu Ran replied, “Didn’t you ask this Old Master to wait for you for a moment yesterday? How did a moment become a day?”

Only then did Yang Kai realize why the latter was looking at him with bitterness on his face, making it seem as though Yang Kai had abandoned him after a one night stand. Scratching his head, he laughed sheepishly, “I bumped into a small matter and was held up for a bit.”

Qiu Ran shook his head in helplessness. Too lazy to refute the latter, he waved his hand and replied, “Follow me.”

Yang Kai followed behind obediently.

As Qiu Ran walked into a slightly larger hall, he waved his hand, causing the doors to immediately close shut. Looking left and right, Yang Kai discovered that there were traces of a Spirit Array present within this large hall, though he was unable to identify exactly what kind of array it was.

There was a massive sand table present in the middle of the hall, and upon taking a cursory look at it, Yang Kai discovered that there seemed to be a sliver of spirituality present within the sand as it slowly circulated about. However, taking a closer look, he noticed that it was an inanimate object, bringing about an incomparably strange feeling within him.

Moving forward for a closer look, Yang Kai’s eyebrows immediately rose up, “Is this Azure Sun Mountain Range?”

Qiu Ran nodded in response, “Correct. This is the Mountains and Rivers Projection of our Azure Sun Mountain Range.” As he said that, he extended his finger. Emperor Qi surged out before the sand table immediately started to come alive. Luscious vegetation, trees, and a mountain range rose up, followed by rocky outcrops, before a miniaturized model of Azure Sun Mountain Range impressively formed. Every single mountain peak, and every single valley present within Azure Sun Mountain Range was identical in shape and scaled size to the original.

Yang Kai clicked his tongue repeatedly in awe, while thinking whether he should ask Hua Qing Si to create a similar Mountains and Rivers Projection when he returned back to High Heavens Palace.

Although this kind of thing was not uncommon within big Sects, it required exquisite and detailed refining to create. With his High Heavens Palace’s current level of heritage, it shouldn’t be difficult to accomplish such a task.

“Our Azure Sun Temple sits within Azure Sun Mountain Range, with our temple taking its name from it. There are a total of 1,352 large and small peaks, of which there are 27 main peaks reserved for our Elders. Currently, the majority of them are empty. Take a look and find one that catches your interest,” Qiu Ran said while pointing towards the Mountains and Rivers Projection.

Yang Kai took a deep look for a while before replying, “Senior Brother Qiu, someone is staying in that green area, right?”

Qiu Ran nodded, “That’s right. The peaks highlighted in green are occupied by people, while the white areas are unoccupied.” Saying that, he extended his hand to point towards a certain location on the Mountains and Rivers Projection, “This is this Old Master’s Spirit Jade Peak.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his brow. With Spirit Jade Peak as a reference, he was able to make out the accuracy of this Mountains and Rivers Projection in detail. Of the 27 main peaks, other than the 10 or so being occupied by the Elders of the temple, the remaining dozen or so were left for him to choose from. Yang Kai looked over at them and felt somewhat dazzled, resulting in him being unable to make a decision for a long time.

To the side, Qiu Ran extended his hand and pointed towards a certain Spirit Peak, “That place is quite good. How about considering it, Junior Brother?”

Yang Kai looked over to where he was pointing, before pointing towards the neighbouring Spirit Peak, “If I am not mistaken, that should be the Purple Bamboo Peak, yes?”

“That’s right. That’s Junior Sister Gao’s Purple Bamboo Peak!”

“Forget about it,” Yang Kai said with great certainty.

Of the people within Azure Sun Temple, Gao Xue Ting was the person that he was most unable to oppose. Although if he and Gao Xue Ting were to fight, Gao Xue Ting would lose nine times out of ten, it was still for the best to avoid being neighbours with her.

“Oh… take your time to choose one then,” Qiu Ran did not judge Yang Kai’s response.

After a while, Yang Kai suddenly pointed, “That Spirit Peak.”

Qiu Ran looked over and nodded slightly and replied, “Spirit Sword Peak. It’s also fairly good, though its location is somewhat remote and the peak isn’t too big.”

The 27 Spirit Peaks designated for the residence of Elders did not have many differences between them; after all, regardless of shape or the density of World Energy present, they were all Main Peak level locations. Nevertheless, this Spirit Sword Peak was located slightly further from the core of Azure Sun Mountain Range, though it truly did not matter for anyone with an Emperor Realm cultivation.

“Since Junior Brother has already chosen, then Spirit Sword Peak it is.” With a wave of Qiu Ran’s hand, the Mountains and Rivers Projection instantly collapsed, turning back into its earlier sand table appearance, before he continued, “Junior Brother, your Elder Token will be able to open the various barriers and restrictions present on Spirit Sword Peak. When you head over, please remember to refine your Elder Token together with the Spirit Sword Peak’s Earth Vein. From then on, Spirit Sword Peak will be your domain. Without your permission, even this Old Master cannot enter as he pleases.”

“Many thanks, Senior Brother Qiu,” Yang Kai cupped his hands and replied.

“Off you go,” Qiu Ran waved his hand.

Yang Kai immediately bade farewell and left.

Leaving Spirit Jade Peak, Yang Kai headed along the path he memorized towards Spirit Sword Peak.

It merely took the time for one to steep a small cup of tea for a tall, precipitous mountain peak to come into view in the distance. At first glance, the mountain peak appeared just like a sharp sword piercing out from the ground, giving it an imposing look. That was also where its name of Spirit Sword Peak came from.

The sides of the mountain peak were steep, with high cliffs surrounding it, while clouds covered the midline of the mountain. Many beasts and creatures were living on the mountain, with everything coming together to form something akin to a paradise.

Yang Kai looked over from a distance and was immensely satisfied with it.

Although he was the Palace Master of High Heaven Palace, which occupied a peak grade Spirit Vein and many Spirit Peaks, he was just a High-Rank Guest Elder in Azure Sun Temple. Nevertheless, Yang Kai now had a place he could call his own in the Southern Territory.

This was something to be happy about.

Transforming into a streak of light, he flew towards the mountain peak. Sweeping his gaze around, Yang Kai saw that there were a few exquisite palaces here. Although it had been unoccupied for many years, and no maintenance had been conducted on them, with the protection of the various Spirit Arrays, there was not a trace of damage present on these palaces. In fact, there wasn’t even a speck of dust.

Standing where he landed, Yang Kai spread out his Divine Sense. Like a tsunami roaring towards the shore, it encapsulated the entire Spirit Sword Peak in a flash, allowing Yang Kai to get a full understanding of the situation of this Spirit Sword Peak.

Retracting his Divine Sense, Yang Kai moved about, appearing just like a sovereign who was inspecting his own territory.

After spending a full half-day doing so, Yang Kai had returned to his peak’s main palace and could not help but call out in surprise, “Senior Brothers, Senior Sisters, why are all of you here?”

Impressively, Gao Xue Ting and the others were waiting within. Upon seeing Yang Kai return, Chen Qian gave a faint smile and replied, “We’re here to offer our congratulations.”

Yang Kai chuckled and said, “Didn’t you all already offer your congratulations yesterday?”

“What’s wrong? You don’t welcome us?” Gao Xue Ting shot a cold glare at Yang Kai.

This shocked Yang Kai, who hastily replied, “How would I dare? I’m simply ecstatic. Everyone, please come in.”

As he said that, he welcomed the other Elders into the palace hall.

Before Yang Kai could even sit down though, Gao Xue Ting suddenly waved her hand, causing over a hundred big bottles of fragrant wine to appear on the ground. With a refreshing tone, she declared, “Our temple has a new Elder, so today, everyone will not return until they’re drunk!”

As those words rang out, colour faded from everyone’s faces.

Chen Qian’s pretty face turned pale as she hurriedly cautioned, “Please don’t be impulsive, Senior Sister!”

Di Rong’s face also changed as he subconsciously backpedalled, “I suddenly recalled that the Temple Master is looking for me for some matters, so I’ll take a leave first.”

“Hmm?” Gao Xue Ting’s eyes narrowed sharply as she snorted deeply.

In an instant, Di Rong turned stiff and came to a halt there. He turned his head around to You Kun, hoping that the latter could save him from this impending disaster, only to see You Kun drenched in beads of cold sweat, his face so pale it appeared as though he had lost all of his blood.
