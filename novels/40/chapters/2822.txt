Yang Kai followed Yu all the way into the palace and waited for about an hour before he met with a Shaman Grandmaster with a tall stature and a thick aura. It was unknown what Shaman Art this man cultivated, but he had an aura that looked like lightning and he had sharp, penetrating eyes that made Yang Kai feel a bit on edge.

“Shaman Che, this is Shaman Niu!” Yu gave a respectful bow, not daring to lift her face while introducing Yang Kai to Che.

Yang Kai also followed the appropriate customs and laid his hand on his chest, bowed, and spoke, “Greetings Shaman Che!”

Che nodded lightly and opened his mouth to speak, his voice echoing like muffled, rolling thunder, “Are you the Shaman who made that healing medicine?”

“Yes!” Yang Kai raised his eyes to meet Che’s.

Che questioned with interest, “It’s rare to see one like you. Are you from the Nomad Clan?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “I am from the South Barbarian Clan, I was simply born somewhat small and weak.”

No Shaman or Ancient Barbarian would deny their origins as that would be equivalent to an act of self-contempt. So even though Yang Kai looked weak and resembled a Nomad Clan, Che did not doubt his words.

The corners of Che’s mouth curled into a forced smile as he spoke, “Herbalists do not need to be too strong. The healing medicine you refined is sought after by my clansmen, so there is no need to belittle yourself.”

“Many thanks for Shaman Che’s words!”

Yang Kai’s attitude was neither humble nor overbearing, which made Che look at him a little differently. It was rare to see a High-Rank Shaman Warrior who could face him so freely and easily.

[Wait… Didn’t Yu say that he was just a Low-Rank Shaman Warrior? Why is he now a High-Rank Shaman Warrior?]

This was a difference of two Minor Realms, and Shaman Che believed that Yu would not be mistaken in her report.

Although suspicious in his heart, Che did not ask much and just continued, “I believe Shaman Yu has already told you why we summoned you.”

Yang Kai replied, “She has, and I, Shaman Niu, am also willing to contribute to the Frost and Snow Clan.”

A light flashed across Che’s eyes as he smiled, “Very well, if that’s the case… Yu, Bring Shaman Niu in and report any herbs that are needed.”

“Yes!” Yu responded and took the lead to guide Yang Kai into the palace.

After a while, the two of them entered a certain room. Out of Yang Kai’s expectation, there were already two people waiting here, both of them very old. Their auras were much stronger than his, so it was obvious they were Shaman Masters.

One of them had a head of completely white hair, while the other had somewhat colourful hair. Both of them shot Yu with inquisitive gazes.

Yu nodded lightly, and the two old men stepped forward and chanted in unison, “Greetings, Shaman Niu!”

Yang Kai uttered in amazement, “These two are…”

Yu’s expression was a little uneasy when she explained, “They’re helpers Shaman Che arranged for you. If you need any assistance, just ask them.”

“Is that so…?” Yang Kai smiled lightly. He had some guesses about this situation, but he did not speak up; after all, this was not a big deal to him. Seeing Yang Kai’s smile meaningfully, Yu’s expression became even more uneasy while a trace of guilt flashed across her eyes.

Fortunately, Yang Kai did not question further and instead just got to work, “I need some herbs. Could you help me gather them?”

“Ah, en, what do you need?” Yu asked quickly.

Yang Kai immediately reported the names of the herbs and Yu noted each of them by memory. The two old men also perked up their ears at this moment and listened attentively, not willing to miss a single word.

After a while, when Yang Kai finished reporting the names of various herbs and the required quantities, Yu immediately turned around and went out to prepare them.

Yang Kai then turned to the two old men remaining in the room and asked politely, “How should I address the two Seniors?”

The two exchanged a glance before they shook their heads and waved their hands in embarrassment, apparently unwilling to reveal their names.

Yang Kai wanted to laugh, thinking, [The Ancient Barbarian Race is the Ancient Barbarian Race after all; they’re indeed simple-minded. Although it is obvious enough that they want to steal my knowledge and skills, they so obviously feel guilty about it. I guess that’s why they do not want to reveal their names.]

Yang Kai did not insist and instead found a place for himself, took out a handful of Monster Cores from the bag he carried with him, then stuffed them directly into his mouth, swallowing them in one gulp.

The size of these Monster Cores was just like rice grains, and not only were they small, they also had low concentrations of energy, so Yang Kai could ingest several dozen of them in a handful. His guts groaned strangely, and the two knowledge-stealing old men watched in awe. The two had no idea what Yang Kai had eaten and guessed that he should be cultivating, so even though they were surprised, they remained silent.

But within a stick of incense’s worth of time, Yang Kai had already finished refining the Monster Core he swallowed, and the intensity of his aura suddenly increased.

When he repeated the process again, only then did the two old men see exactly what he was eating.

The white-haired old man was shocked and quickly stopped him, “Shaman Niu, are those Barbarian Beast Cores? How can you swallow them directly?”

The colourful-haired old man hurriedly tried to stop Yang Kai, “You can’t eat them! You can’t eat them like that!”

They had never met someone who dared to swallow Barbarian Beast Cores like this. Was he not afraid of exploding?

“I have always eaten them like this though,” Yang Kai threw more Monster Cores into his mouth as he spoke, making a crunching noise that terrified the old men who were now staring at him as if he was a monster.

“Do you want some? They’re Monster Insects flavour and they’re quite crunchy!” Yang Kai smiled and opened his palm to offer them.

The two old men shook their heads like pellet drums, completely horrified.

Fortunately, at this time, a large number of Frost and Snow Clansmen flooded into the room, each of them carrying a large number of herbs. Yu, who was the leader, instructed the clansmen to put the herbs aside in different categories.

After all the herbs were placed, Yu reported, “Shaman Niu, all the things you requested are here, I’ll remain outside so just call me if you need anything else.”

“Thanks!” Yang Kai gently nodded at her.

Yu then turned and left, closing the door behind her.

Yang Kai closed his eyes and adjusted his breathing while he finished refining the Monster Cores he ingested. Then, he opened his eyes and said to the two old men, “Then let’s start.”

The two old men looked at each other and got up together.

“Two Rain Flower Branches, one Earth Fruit, three Sour Citrus Grass…” Yang Kai chanted the names and weights of various herbs continuously, and the two old men immediately began working after a short moment of astonishment. They gathered exactly what Yang Kai needed among the piles of herbs, not making the slightest mistake in the details.

Not long after, a pile of herbs piled up in front of Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled, “Watch carefully now…”

Saying so, he pinched a few herbs in one hand, and a ball of fire suddenly lit up in the other palm, its temperature fluctuating.

The two old men were stunned again and, ignoring any shame and guilt they felt, they fixed their eyes on Yang Kai’s hands, their gazes unmoving.

They were Frost and Snow Clan’s most outstanding Herbalists, and they were highly respected characters in their own right. It was truly shameful that they were tasked by Shaman Che to steal knowledge from Yang Kai, but they also knew that they were not capable of making that magical healing medicine on their own. Even though they knew the ingredients, they lacked the appropriate knowledge, leaving them strong in will but weak in strength.

Unfortunately, the knowledge of a Herbalist was often the secret of a Clan and would not be leaked easily, so if they wanted to know the refining method of this healing medicine, they could only obey Shaman Che and try to quietly steal the methods in the name of assisting Shaman Niu.

How could they have anticipated that Yang Kai had already seen through their intentions but did not even try to conceal anything from them? Not only was he generously refining medicines for their clan, he even deliberately taught them his knowledge. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Compared to their despicable actions, his generosity and kindness were a far cry, making the two highly respected Herbalists feel evermore condemned by their conscience.

Despite their guilt, the two Herbalists were still extremely focused and persistent in studying the refinement of the medicine. They held their breath as they observed, and planned to thank and apologize to this Shaman Niu when the time came.

The secret of refining the healing medicine was quickly understood by the two old men under the personal demonstration and teaching by an Emperor Alchemist like Yang Kai.

They were excellent Herbalists and Yang Kai’s healing medicine was not difficult to make; only the refining techniques were a little strange. The two old men only needed to figure out this methodology to comprehend the entire refinement process. After all, they too, would gain a new comprehension in this field of study.

Therefore, in less than a day, the two Herbalists had basically mastered the refining method of the healing medicine, and with the encouragement of Yang Kai, they experimented by themselves.

Yang Kai left them alone and refined his Monster Cores to improve his cultivation, only checking on the two old men after they finished each refinement, putting forward his own opinions and pointing out the mistakes they made during their refinement.

The quality of the healing medicine produced by the two Herbalists moved closer to perfection day by day.

The days passed by quietly and the men, two old and one young, all forgot the passage of time.

Despite the age of the two Herbalists of the Frost and Snow Clan, they were very energetic. The more contact they had with this Shaman Niu, the more they discovered how horrifyingly deep his knowledge of medicine was. Even a casual comment from him could lead them to an epiphany that would benefit them immensely.

The healing medicine made by these two was now no different from the one made by Yang Kai himself. In other words, this healing medicine would become a common medicine for the Frost and Snow Clan in the future, meaning they had no need to worry about any future serious injuries.

This was a great event that benefited the entire Clan, and the two old men were incredibly grateful to Yang Kai.

Ten days later, the huge number of herbs delivered by Yu were all refined into healing medicine by the two old men. With such a large amount of healing medicine, the Clan would not need to worry about any serious injuries for at least the next twenty years, and they could even sell some to other tribes in exchange for other precious resources.

While the two old men concentrated on refining medicine, they did not notice that the aura on Yang Kai’s body had suddenly escalated, and at the same time, the Monster Cores he had harvested were completely exhausted.

Examining his own condition in joy, Yang Kai opened his eyes slightly, and his eyes flashed in a terrifying light.

The ups and downs of the early stage have passed. From now on, his cultivation path would be smooth and rapid!
