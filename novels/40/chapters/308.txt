A moment later, that Sixth-Order spider suddenly became violent and attacked its companions without any explanation. The other spiders, noticing this disturbance, hurriedly swarmed towards the fight.

Shan Qing Luo lightly waved her hand and directly cut a hole in the cocoon, and vanished without a trace in the next breath. Her soft voice soon drifted into Yang Kai’s ear, “Don’t move from there, and wait for me to come back!”

Yang Kai naturally wasn’t going to move about randomly. Calming his breath, he carefully examined the outside situation.

The spider that he was controlling at the moment was now engaged in a turbulent struggle with its former companions. A Sixth-Order Monster Beast would undoubtedly have already gained a certain amount of sentience, albeit not a lot, but it was at least capable of some simple reasoning.

The attacked spiders didn’t seem to understand why their companion had suddenly gone crazy, just like when it had suddenly killed so many of the Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land’s cultivators.

After passively resisting for a moment, the attacked spiders, as if having reached some kind of consensus, no longer held back and treated this violent comrade of theirs as if it had gone insane and couldn’t be saved.

In only a few breaths of time, the Sixth-Order Monster Beast controlled by Yang Kai had met its end.

The gathered spiders then quickly began to disperse again.

“Yang Kai!” Qiu Yi Meng suddenly shouted.

Yang Kai’s face remained indifferent, and he didn’t even bothering to respond.

“Has Elder Sister Shan recovered her strength?” Qiu Yi Meng eagerly asked.

Still he remained silent.

Qiu Yi Meng wryly smiled, “Yang Kai, you’re not such a stingy man right? I admit that I had offended you before, will you not allow me to apologize to you for that?”

“No need, the distinguished Young Lady Qiu’s apology, I’m afraid I can’t afford it.” Yang Kai replied coldly.

Qiu Yi Meng giggled lightly, “Fine fine, I was wrong, I was truly wrong, I should not have brought people to your High Heaven Pavilion to find trouble. In fact, I’m also at a bit of a loss about how I would have taken you, your combat ability is so strong that between us if we really compete I’m not sure who would win. I really can’t believe such a small Sect could train a disciple like you.”

“Don’t bother trying to flatter me, it’s disgusting.”

“Hehe, fine, you and I are both reasonable people so I’ll be direct with you.” Qiu Yi Meng said with a light smile, “After Elder Sister Shan comes back, can you please ask her to bring Xiao Man and I out with you? Rest assured, as long as she promises to help us, my Qiu Family will spare no expense to repay her!”

“Saving you is up to her, it’s not something I can interfere with,” Yang Kai said bluntly, his brow slightly wrinkled.

“No no no, I see that the relationship between you and the Beguiling Demon Queen is quite intimate, quite unlike how she must treat other men. If you put in a few words with her, I’m sure Elder Sister Shan will be more inclined to help us.” Qiu Yi Meng’s voice suddenly became more restrained, “As long as you don’t insist on Xiao Man and I becoming your servants, any other conditions you mention we can comply with! Even if you want to marry a young lady of my Qiu Family, I can make sure that my Lord Father agrees... oh, but be careful not to mention such things in front of Elder Sister Shan or else I’m afraid she might become jealous.”

Yang Kai’s patience increasingly grew thin as his face twisted with antipathy, “I’ve already said, her saving you is up to her, it has nothing to do with me, what meaning do you have to spout such nonsense towards me?”

Qiu Yi Meng’s face quickly became miserable, like she was about to cry, “But I can only pin my hopes on you, if you don’t speak up for us, I’m afraid we really have no hope of escaping this crisis.” As she was speaking, the sound of her voice choked up, stuttering slightly, “Do you... do you really have the heart to just leave us to die?”

Knowing that she was simply putting on an act to try to gain his sympathy, Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling repulsed, and he was no longer willing to even respond to her.

Yang Kai had a particularly bad impression towards this scheming woman.

“Yang Kai, Yang Kai ...” Qiu Yi Meng did not become discouraged though and continued to call out softly to him again and again.

The conversation between the two of them was quite quiet, but Luo Xiao Man who was not far away naturally heard it clearly.

Seeing Yang Kai act so ruthlessly, Luo Xiao Man couldn’t help but to despair, and her face gradually became deathly pale. She sobbed in a panic before she quietly called out, “Elder Sister Qiu, what should we do?

Qiu Yi Meng faintly sighed and gave up on her efforts to convince Yang Kai, wearing a desolate smile, “Just wait, we can’t simply die here.”

At that moment, a breath of incense suddenly flew over as a red clothed figure suddenly appeared in front of Yang Kai. With a wave of her fingers, the remaining silk threads binding Yang Kai were instantly severed

“Go!” Shan Qing Luo said hastily, one hand grabbing Yang Kai as she lightly kicked the ground, quickly flying up.

Yang Kai’s expression also became dignified as he quickly kept up with her. His Divine Sense which was constantly monitoring the surroundings had already noticed that the Spider Mother’s unique overwhelming blood force was rapidly reviving. Apparently Shan Qing Luo’s movements just now had awakened it.

“Elder Sister Shan.” Qiu Yi Meng shouted in a hurried voice and ground her teeth, still showing a slight hesitation on her face.

But she knew that this was no time to be concerned with her pride, if Shan Qing Luo left, she and Luo Xiao Man would really have no chance of escaping from here alive.

“Elder Sister Shan, I agree to your previous conditions, please take me and Xiao Man away with you!” Qiu Yi Meng cried out.

Shan Qing Luo slightly frowned as she glanced towards her. Flicking her wrist, two pink ribbons shot out and wrapped up Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man and quickly dragged them up with her.

Seeing Shan Qing Luo not abandon them in the end, whether it was Qiu Yi Meng or Luo Xiao Man they were both suddenly filled with a desperate joy.

“Betraying your own blood, not heeding the advice of your elders, don’t even dream of escaping!” The Spider Mother’s infuriated voice rang out, no longer containing the slightest bit of charm and instead sounded more akin to an enraged woman.

As she spoke, two thick white silk threads pierced through the air.

These two silk threads were ridiculously fast, and almost instantaneously arrived in front of Shan Qing Luo and Yang Kai and forced them to hastily guard themselves.

As the Yuan Qi from their attacks collided and exploded, the two spider threads were blocked, but the force from the impact cut off one of the ribbons Shan Qing Luo was holding, sending Luo Xiao Man plummeting back down towards the ground.

Letting out a piercing wail, Luo Xiao Man’s watery eyes filled with panic as her heart all but stopped.

Seeing this, Yang Kai reacted instantaneously by push-kicking Qiu Yi Meng’s waist, sending her towards Luo Xiao Man.

Before the pair had even reached the ground, Qiu Yi Meng managed to stretch out her hand and grasp Luo Xiao Man’s clothes, pulling her towards herself.

“Elder Sister Qiu...” Luo Xiao Man cried out in amazement as large round tears poured out of her eyes. Her lofty peaks rose and fell as she gasped for breath. Her face was still filled with terror.

“I’ve got you, don’t worry, I won’t let go of.” Qiu Yi Meng smiled towards her, trying to disperse the lingering fear still apparent on her face.

Shan Qing Luo quickly glanced towards Yang Kai meaningfully, her mouth showing a teasing yet soul-stirring smile.

Yang Kai simply shrugged his shoulders.

Just now, his kick had been made subconsciously, it was a purely instinctive reaction!

Suddenly, from down below, Bai Yun Feng’s raving voice rang out, “Bring me with you! You damn sluts... how could you just abandon me here? Even if I become a ghost I won’t let you off!”

Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man’s faces filled with disgust as they remained cold and indifferent.

Only by journeying together with someone through ups and downs would you be able to know them. Bai Yun Feng used to give them a favourable impression. Although they wouldn’t rate him highly, whatever the case, he had behaved appropriately for the eldest son of a first-class family. Be it his background or personal power, his capital was not small; needless to say there was no shortage of young women who sought after him.

However, when they had fallen into this crisis, he had completely exposed the darkness hidden within his heart.

As a man, he was no better than dog shit! Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man didn’t have the slightest bit of sympathy towards him.

Next to a quaint, calm, crystal clear lake, filled with floating plants and happily swimming fish, three people sat.

In front of a bonfire he had made, Yang Kai roasted some fatty fish he had caught.

Luo Xiao Man and Qiu Yi Meng sat opposite him, breathing in the crisp clean air while glancing towards this young man awkwardly.

As a splashing sound drift over from the lake, Shan Qing Luo’s gracefully figure suddenly emerged. After finishing her bath, her exquisite snow white skin seemed to glisten with an attractive luster, this hint of blush only added to her radiance. Her delicate pair of bare jade like feet lightly flashed in and out of view.

Exuding ten thousand different types of charm, her thin and tender red lips displayed a carefree smile. Her skin was nearly fully exposed, and only her bountiful peaks and the sacred valley below her waist were covered, making for an alluring display.

Seeing such an fascinating, flirtatious picture, not only did Yang Kai’s heart race, even Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man’s faces blushed a bright shade of red. All of their breaths became slightly hurried.

Immediately, the three of them quickly turned aside their gazes and silently cursed this bewitching fairy in their hearts!

“Hehehe...” Shan Qing Luo giggled happily as she observed the reaction of these three.

Arriving at the edge of the lake, she draped her clothes haphazardly over her lithe body, only half covering herself before gracefully stepping forward and quickly arriving beside Yang Kai and sitting herself down and snuggling up next to him.

“Can’t you behave yourself a little?” Yang Kai asked helplessly.

“Is there a need for us to be discreet?” Shan Qing Luo smiled brilliantly, “We’ve already touched each other intimately and shared more than one kiss, why do we suddenly need to act all prim and proper?”

Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man couldn’t help looking shocked and gazed towards Yang Kai in surprise. Their eyes were filled with a confused light.

Although Qiu Yi Meng had felt that the relationship between Yang Kai and Shan Qing Luo was not simple, ultimately she had never seen the two interact with her own eyes and couldn’t tell just how close they really were.

However, seeing them sit so close to one another, if they were not essentially lovers, what woman would behave so shamelessly?

[Could the world’s most charming woman actually be in love with him?] Qiu Yi Meng pondered as she gazed absentmindedly and swept her eyes over Yang Kai once more. Although he gave off an uninhibited aura, and his strength wasn’t bad, in the end, he was still only a youth at the True Element Boundary Fourth Stage.

Just how in the world did he managed to capture the world famous Beguiling Demon Queen’s heart?

Qiu Yi Meng continued staring at them for a long time before she managed to pull herself together. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Yang Kai on the other hand turned a blind eye to her and pretended he didn’t notice the puzzled stares he was receiving. Instead, he just intently grilling his fish.

As the delicate aroma of fresh cooked food wafted about, Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man couldn’t stop their stomachs from crying out softly, and both of them immediately became crimson faced after.

The two of them had been chased relentlessly by the cultivators of the Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land for more than a month, and they never had a moment of rest and were constantly suppressing their feelings of fatigue and hunger. After that, when they had reached the height of their exhaustion, they had been captured by those spiders, and it wasn’t until now that they could truly relax.

“Thank you for saving us, Elder Sister Shan.” Qiu Yi Meng suddenly said, doing her best to squeeze out a smile.

Shan Qing Luo simply smiled back frivolously, “It was simply a deal between you and me, there’s no need for thanks!”

“Be that as it may, if it weren’t for Elder Sister Shan, Xiao Man and I would not have been able to escape that crisis.” Qiu Yi Meng shook her head gently.

As she finished speaking, she once again glanced towards Yang Kai awkwardly, reluctantly saying, “Thank you, too!”

Qiu Yi Meng knew that if he hadn’t swiftly helped her back then, there was no way she could have rescued Luo Xiao Man.

However, Yang Kai remained indifferent and completely ignored her.

Qiu Yi Meng couldn’t help suddenly feeling a bit bitter.
