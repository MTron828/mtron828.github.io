A moment later, the bamboo hut’s door opened again, and under everyone’s stunned gazes, a pale Gong Yang Xi walked out of the house. He turned around and respectfully closed the door before bowing, “I’m sorry for disturbing you, Senior. Please rest well.”

The jaws of these hundreds of top cultivators from Wild Dragon Pavilion dropped as they couldn’t believe their eyes.

“Let’s go!” Gong Yang Xi yelled as he turned into a beam of light and shot into the distance.

Although the people from Wild Dragon Pavilion were doubtful, they didn’t dare to ask anything. After that, they summoned their own flight type artifacts or used their Movement Skills to leave this place. In the blink of an eye, hundreds of them disappeared from the place, as the solitary mountain became serene again.

After they flew for more than 100 kilometres, Gong Yang Xi, who was at the front, staggered and sprayed out a mouthful of blood as his aura weakened all of a sudden. His wrinkled face became even more withered, as though he would lose his life at any moment.

“Pavilion Master!” The other Elders were stunned as they surrounded him.

[What happened inside the bamboo hut? What did Pavilion Master and the thief talk about? Why did he step out of the house and leave the place in silence? Why does he look like he’s severely injured now?]

Their minds became a mess because of the mysteries.

Gong Yang Xi stabilized himself with difficulty and waved his hand to signal that he was fine.

“Pavilion Master, that person…” One of the Elders couldn’t contain his curiosity anymore, so he asked the question.

“Don’t ask anything,” A sense of fear flashed across Gong Yang Xi’s face.

“But our Sect’s Supreme Artifact…” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Never mention it again!” Gong Yang Xi’s gaze was filled with conflicted determination, “Just treat it as if we have never had it before.”

“What!?” All of them exclaimed.

[Who was that person!? Why is Pavilion Master so terrified of him? Now, he doesn’t even want to get back the Supreme Artifact that has been with us for more than ten thousand years…] The Elders wouldn’t dare to keep thinking about it, as they were worried that the idea in their minds would make them lose faith in their Martial Dao.

…

Outside the bamboo hut, He Yun Xiang opened her mouth slightly, as though two invisible fingers had been stuffed into it. She watched dazedly as the people from Wild Dragon Pavilion left the place because what was happening before her eyes was beyond her ability to understand.

[Aren’t they from one of the top Sects in the Ancestral Domain? Why did they suddenly turn so timid when they were confronted?] If He Yun Xiang hadn’t sensed their power, she would have thought that there was another great force in the Ancestral Domain that was also called Wild Dragon Pavilion.

The corners of Yang Kai’s mouth kept twitching. If possible, he would want to turn around and leave as well.

However, the person inside the house might be the key to obtaining what he wanted, so he was reluctant to leave. After hesitating for a long time, he clenched his teeth and made up his mind. In order to return to the Heng Luo Star Field, even if there was a pile of dung inside the house, he would go in and step on it!

“Stay here. I’ll be right back.” Yang Kai patted Liu Yan’s head.

Nevertheless, she grabbed his sleeve and wouldn’t let go.

“Let go.” Yang Kai glowered at her.

“No!” Not to be outdone, Liu Yan opened her eyes wider than him.

Yang Kai uttered, “We can’t put all the eggs in the same basket. If something goes wrong, I’ll notify you. Then, you’ll rush into the house and burn him to ashes.”

Hearing that, Liu Yan nodded and released him, “Alright then. Be careful.”

Yang Kai groaned and thought that it was useless to be careful in front of that person. Then, he walked up to the door and coughed slightly before he knocked on the door. In a loud voice, he asked, “Is anyone home?”

In an instant, the solemn atmosphere became hilarious. He Yun Xiang even burst out laughing, but she quickly covered her mouth and suppressed her voice.

Getting no response, Yang Kai adjusted his clothes and went on to speak, “Sorry for the disturbance then.”

Following that, he pushed the door open and stepped into the house. Just like what had happened just now, the door automatically closed.

Inside the dark house, a person was sitting cross-legged on a futon as he looked smilingly at Yang Kai.

When their gazes met, Yang Kai became extremely alarmed, but he still pretended to be nonchalant and cupped his fists, “Brother Wu, how are you?” [Since you’ve used the alias Wu Chen, I’ll call you Brother Wu, then. I’ll never call you Senior Wu because you’re the biggest scourge in the entire Star Boundary has ever known.]

Wu Kuang didn’t mind it as he extended his hand, “Have a seat.”

Yang Kai replied, “I don’t mind standing.”

He circulated his Qi and readied himself to battle against the man before his eyes at any moment.

Wu Kuang said, “But then I have to raise my head to speak to you.”

Yang Kai’s brow twitched. After giving it a thought, he decided that he didn’t want to take advantage of him in this matter, for he was worried that the latter might suddenly become enraged. So, he gave in and took a seat.

As they were sitting across from each other, Wu Kuang took out a tea set and started preparing tea.

At that moment, Yang Kai felt overwhelmed by this kind of treatment. Wu Kuang was the greatest disaster the Star Boundary had experienced in the past hundred thousand years and had devastated countless Star Fields, killing an innumerable number of people in the process. Nevertheless, he was still one of the strongest Masters in the entire Star Boundary’s history, even killing a few Great Emperors. So, it was quite an honour for Yang Kai that Wu Kuang was preparing tea for him.

In an instant, he felt less hostile towards Wu Kuang. That was indeed the kind of demeanour a Master should have. In the future, he would be quite honoured to tell others that he had had tea with Wu Kuang before.

“Little Friend, why are you here?” Wu Kuang asked nonchalantly. In fact, he hadn’t expected that he would come across Yang Kai in such a place.

With a serious expression, Yang Kai replied, “It’s a long story, but my intention was to hunt you down.”

Wu Kuang put on a smile, “What about now?”

“Will you let me kill you?” Yang Kai questioned.

“That’ll depend on whether you’re powerful enough.”

Yang Kai pondered on it for a moment and shook his head, “Even if I had the power to do so, I’m afraid I still can’t kill you.” By killing Wu Kuang, it would be akin to murdering Duan Hong Chen, so it was too hefty a price to pay.

In an instant, he turned furious and bellowed, “Just you wait. When I find a way to get you out of Senior Hong Chen’s body one day! I’ll certainly kill you!”

“Then you’ll have to work harder on cultivating.” Wu Kuang grinned.

Yang Kai felt uneasy, as this meeting was different from what he had imagined. [Isn’t he a murderous madman? Why is he acting like a wise and magnanimous old sage now?] He felt as though his fist had landed on a soft wad of cotton rather than an iron sheet he was expecting, making him feel all the more uncomfortable. It would have been more natural to have been dragged into an all-out battle from the start.

“Did you suddenly become a vegetarian?” Yang Kai suddenly asked.

“What do you mean?” Wu Kuang was puzzled.

“Why didn’t you devour those people from Wild Dragon Pavilion?” In fact, Yang Kai was utterly surprised that those from Wild Dragon Pavilion had left safely, which was an inconceivable idea. It must be the luckiest day in their lives that they had escaped from this place unscathed.

Wu Kuang’s temperament couldn’t have changed, as his Heaven Devouring Battle Law was his primary Secret Art. Just half a year ago, he had even eaten an Eighth-Order Dragon on Dragon Island.

“They’re not even enough to fill the cracks between my teeth, so why should I bother?”

Finally understanding the reason behind it, Yang Kai nodded and asked, “Why did you come to the Ancestral Domain, then? Did you go to Dragon Island in an attempt to come here?”

Wu Kuang replied, “I’ve come here to get back something and prepare for the future.”

“The future?” Yang Kai frowned.

“We’ll talk about the future in the future.” When the tea was ready, Wu Kuang filled one cup with it and took a sip.

Realising that there was no extra teacup, Yang Kai directly picked up the pot and drank a mouthful of it before he said, “You didn’t eat those people not because you didn’t want to, but because you couldn’t, right?”

Wu Kuang froze for a moment as a glint flashed across his eyes, “What do you mean? There’s nothing in this world that I can’t do!”

“Although those people are not powerful enough, a mosquito is still meat to you. Moreover, you’re still recuperating. The reason you’re hiding in a Lower Star Field is to absorb more energy, isn’t it?”

“So?” Wu Kuang looked smilingly at him but didn’t refute him.

Yang Kai went on to say, “Senior Duan would never allow that to happen though, he must have stopped you…” As he spoke, he frowned all of a sudden. Then, he fell back a little and sized up Wu Kuang.

For a moment, an inconceivable idea flashed across his mind.

Wu Kuang kept a smile on his face.

Yang Kai’s body shook as he asked hesitantly, “Senior… Duan?”

It was then that Wu Kuang’s smile turned helpless.

In disbelief, Yang Kai asked, “Are you really Senior Duan?”

All of a sudden, ‘Wu Kuang’ cackled, “Old Duan, I told you that you can never imitate my confident demeanour! It’s as if you want to draw a tiger, but it turns out to be a dog instead.”

Then, the same man snapped, “Shut up.”

Yang Kai’s forehead was beaded with cold sweat. He was just having doubts earlier, but now, his speculation had been confirmed. Since the beginning, it was Duan Hong Chen who had been talking to him instead of Wu Kuang.

In an instant, Yang Kai’s face fell as he questioned, “Senior Duan, what’s going on?”

He had thought that Duan Hong Chen had been suppressed by Wu Kuang. Otherwise, the latter wouldn’t have gone to Dragon Island to slay a Dragon and hidden in a Lower Star Field. However, now, that didn’t seem to be the case. Apparently, Duan Hong Chen hadn’t been completely suppressed as he still had some freedom.

Moreover, judging from the conversation between Wu Kuang and Duan Hong Chen just now, they were at least not fighting anymore.

No matter what evil atrocities Wu Kuang had done, Yang Kai would just think that it was typical of him to have done that. However, if Duan Hong Chen was involved in those evil acts, it would be an entirely different story.

Knowing what Yang Kai was questioning, Duan Hong Chen replied after a sigh, “I was only liberated after he came to this place. I didn’t mean to hide anything from you.”

Yang Kai heaved a sigh of relief because Duan Hong Chen wasn’t involved in any of those crimes. If Duan Hong Chen and Wu Kuang had become partners things would become troublesome.

Seeing Yang Kai’s expression fluctuating between ferocity and hesitancy, Duan Hong Chen uttered, “Don’t even think about it. Even if we team up, we won’t be able to kill him. It’s thanks to him that I’m able to take a breather now. If he decides to fully suppress me, I won’t be able to struggle out of his grip.”

Frustrated, Yang Kai pushed the idea to the back of his mind and asked helplessly, “What should we do, then?”

Duan Hong Chen replied, “Just let nature take its course. However, since we’re lucky enough to have come across each other today, I do have a favour to ask of you.”

With a serious expression, Yang Kai said, “Just tell me right away. I’ll surely do my best to fulfil it.”

Duan Hong Chen went on to say, “After you return to Star Boundary, they’ll certainly ask you about Wu Kuang’s whereabouts. Please don’t reveal it to anyone.”

Yang Kai asked curiously, “Why?” During this meet-up, he had a feeling that Duan Hong Chen’s attitude towards Wu Kuang had changed significantly. Duan Hong Chen wasn’t as hostile towards Wu Kuang as before, almost as if he had given in and was now partnering with him.

[What’s going on? Have these two Great Emperors communicated and come to some kind of agreement? Why is Duan Hong Chen trying to help Wu Kuang hide his whereabouts?]
