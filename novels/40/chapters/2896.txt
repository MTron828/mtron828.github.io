Both the Demon Race and the Barbarian Race paid close attention to Body Tempering, especially a Demon Saint like Mo Duo. Even if his body was not immortal and indestructible, he must have already cultivated his body to its limit.

If Yang Kai fought him with Secret Techniques or long-range Divine Abilities, perhaps Mo Duo would need to spend more effort dealing with him, but now that Yang Kai just charged at him and was about to engage in hand to hand combat, Mo Duo could not help feeling ridiculous and also maddened at the same time.

He felt ridiculous because of the stupidity of his opponent, while feeling enraged because he felt like he was being underestimated.

Mo Duo used all his strength in his attack.

When the two fists collided, Mo Duo’s body shook, while Yang Kai staggered back a few steps.

Yang Kai, who used his Dragon Transformation, still lost to the Demon Saint with only seventy percent of his strength in the competition of pure physical strength! The strength of this Devil Saint was obvious from this alone.

The huge recoil rushed into Yang Kai’s meridians and physique like a rampaging current, causing him unprecedented pain.

Before he could stand firm, Mo Duo already approached him with a counterattack. A fist wrapped with the aura of destruction hit Yang Kai’s abdomen heavily, causing the latter’s eyes to nearly pop out of their sockets as the surge of Demon Qi almost took away his ability to breathe.

It was not over yet though as Mo Duo sent another punch at Yang Kai’s face, sending him spinning in the air and spewing tremendous amounts of blood.

If it were not for his Dragon Transformation that dramatically strengthened his physique, these two punches alone would have been enough to kill Yang Kai. Even so, he still suffered dreadfully from it. Yang Kai felt as though his insides were thrown into a stormy sea, and the Demon Qi which invaded his body through the attacks made him feel lightheaded as destruction swept through his meridians and physique.

Yang Kai fell to the ground helplessly and struggled to get up, but before he could stand firm again, Mo Duo had appeared in front of him and welcomed him with another heavy punch.

Yang Kai’s seemingly confused face suddenly showed a trace of malevolence, his eyes flashing as the Mountains and Rivers Bell was summoned, directly covering the place where he stood.

Mo Duo widened his eyes and wanted to withdraw his fist but it was too late. Yang Kai’s timing in summoning the Mountains and Rivers Bell perfectly matched when Mo Duo had fully exerted his strength.

*Guang Dang…*

The destructive punch hit the Mountains and Rivers Bell, and the ancient bell let out a visible ripple infused with its desolate aura.

The fist that Mo Duo punched the Mountains and Rivers Bell with was instantly mutilated. It was very difficult for him to bear the recoil of his own full blow despite being a Demon Saint, but that was not what was most important in this situation. What mattered the most was the ringing of the Mountain and Rivers Bell. As soon as this sound entered Mo Duo’s ears, he had the impression that he was being suppressed.

As if countless mountains had been piled onto his back, he found himself unable to stand straight under the pressure.

‘Its chime was sufficient to suppress mountains and rivers, its Emperor Aura was sufficient to upturn the universe’. Such was the evaluation of the Mountains and Rivers Bell by various Masters throughout history. The greatest Divine Ability of this Ancient Exotic Artifact was to suppress all things in the world.

Mo Duo’s aura dropped sharply.

The Mountains and Rivers Bell suddenly vanished at that moment and Yang Kai pounced at Mo Duo ferociously, going straight for his chest with his Dragon Claws that were sharper than the finest blade in the world.

In a moment of desperation, Mo Duo roared angrily and tried his best to dispel all kinds of discomfort caused by the Mountains and Rivers Bell through pure Demonic Qi. He then grabbed at Yang Kai’s Dragon Claw with one hand at lightning speed, obviously attempting to stop his attack.

Suddenly, the Mountains and Rivers Bell reappeared again, but instead of covering Yang Kai this time, it turned into the size of a handbell, resting in Yang Kai’s other claw.

With a flick of his fingers, the strange sound of the Mountains and Rivers Bell reverberated again, and the sound wave condensed into an invisible attack, hitting Mo Duo.

Mo Duo’s back bent again and his newly recovered state was instantly ruined.

*Chi… *

Yang Kai’s sharp claw pierced directly through Mo Duo’s chest and out his back, capturing a bloody Demon Heart that was still beating violently. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“You…” Mo Duo stared at Yang Kai, who was close at hand and flew into a rage as he roared madly.

An unimaginable impact gathered into a visible force that shot from Mo Duo’s mouth towards Yang Kai’s chest, resulting in the clear crack of bones. Struck by this impact, Yang Kai was sent flying into the sky like a paper kite.

Mo Duo staggered to straighten his back as blood spurted wildly out of his chest. A huge hole went straight through his body, exposing his organs and viscera.

He looked down with a look of disbelief.

Yang Kai got up in the distance, spat the blood out from his mouth, held the Demon Heart in his palm and grinned at Mo Duo, “I heard that a Master like you has more than one Demon Heart, and as long as the Demon Heart remains, the Demon Race will not die. So, how many Demon Hearts do you have?”

Mo Duo narrowed his eyes and an unfathomably cold light flashed across them. As he surged his Demon Qi, the flesh of his chest wriggled and was soon healed, as if he hadn’t been wounded at all.

“Return it to me!” He demanded in a low voice.

Although he had more than one Demon Heart, and losing one did not threaten his life, the destruction of a Demon Heart would have some impact on his strength. Yang Kai had already shown he had the ability to compete against him in his current state, so losing a Demon Heart would put Mo Duo at a greater disadvantage.

Yang Kai grinned, “What did you say? Did I hear it wrongly, or did you say it wrongly? Did you just ask me to return this thing to you?”

“You heard me right, give it back!” Mo Duo replied coldly.

“Haha!” Yang Kai cackled, “You’re too funny! You and I are locked in a fight to the death, using all our skills and strength to kill one another, but now that I snatched your Demon Heart, you’re actually asking me to give it back to you? I just want to know… Are you an idiot?”

“Give it back to me, and I can grant you a painless end. Otherwise, I will make you suffer a fate worse than death.”

Yang Kai’s face suddenly became serious and continued in a deep voice, “Your Demon Heart is in my hand now, yet instead of asking politely, you’re threatening me?” Yang Kai’s face turned into a mocking grin, “You’re really an idiot!”

Mo Duo stopped talking and fixed his eyes on the Demon Heart.

In the next moment, Yang Kai’s heart jumped as he suddenly felt something was wrong. His face changed drastically and he quickly clenched his hand.

With a loud bang, the Demon Heart exploded, but there was no blood or residual flesh. The Demon Qi contained in it surged out and turned into black fog, shrouding Yang Kai. This black fog was like a living creature, and without any hesitation, it entered straight into Yang Kai’s body by seeping into his pores and the seven orifices on his face.

Yang Kai’s expression turned ugly. Although he wanted to stop it, there was nothing he could do. No matter how he surged his power, he could not stop the invasion of the Demon Qi.

Moreover, the explosion of the Demon Heart earlier was not caused by him but was instead a self-destruct Mo Duo inexplicably used.

Mo Duo groaned at the same time when the Demon Heart exploded and his aura weakened noticeably, as if he had suffered a serious injury, but he still pressed on, “I know you have a way to resist the corruption of ordinary Demon Qi, but you won’t be able to resist my Demon Qi. You will lose yourself and become my slave. I will fulfil my promise and let you taste all the torment this world has to offer other than death. Shaman Niu, kneel down and beg me. Perhaps, I will have mercy.”

As if to confirm his words, Yang Kai showed a dreadfully pained expression, his eyes bulging as if they were going to explode and his entire physique becoming tinted with an abnormal shade of black.

Mo Duo stood to the side and observed coldly. From time to time, he would toss a glance at the Evergreen Divine Tree in the distance, as if he was considering when to destroy this annoying tree.

The Demon Qi all disappeared into Yang Kai’s body quickly and seemingly melted into his physique.

Mo Duo soon lost his patience though and raised his hand to tap on Yang Kai’s head. Although it was hard for him to accept that his heart was destroyed by such a weak enemy and he wanted nothing more than to torture him to vent his anger, he still had more important things to do at this moment.

The giant tree had already reached the sky, and was not far from sealing the entire Two Worlds Passage. If Mo Duo continued to delay, he was afraid that there would be trouble.

Mo Duo decided to kill Yang Kai first, then deal with the giant tree.

But just as he was about to act, a shocking scene appeared before his eyes.

Yang Kai, who looked like he was in incredible pain, suddenly let out a low roar and spat out a stream of rich, pitch-black Demon Qi from his mouth.

Mo Duo was dumbstruck.

This Demon Qi was clearly the Demon Qi that was contained in his Demon Heart. It should have invaded this Shaman Niu’s body and merged with his flesh and blood, so how did he manage to spit it out again?

More and more Demon Qi was spat out and the seemingly living Demon Qi rushed about in a flustered motion, as if there was something in Yang Kai’s body that frightened it greatly.

Mo Duo could hardly believe his eyes and was stunned in place for a moment.

After a while, Yang Kai finally finished spitting out all the Demon Qi, patted his stomach, and remarked with a disgusted look, “What the hell is this? It’s not delicious at all.”

“How… how did you…” Mo Duo wanted to ask clearly, but as soon as he spoke, he knew that his opponent would not answer him. This Shaman Niu definitely kept many secrets, so Mo Duo stopped halfway.

Sure enough, Yang Kai did not want to answer him. After spitting out all the Demon Qi, he raised his hand, and the Mountains and Rivers Bell flew towards Mo Duo, rapidly enlarged, and plunged down, as if intending to suppress him in one fell swoop.

How could Mo Duo just stand idly by though? He learnt the power of this little bell previously, so he immediately flickered aside as soon as he saw Yang Kai’s action.

Nevertheless, Yang Kai took another action after observing Mo Duo’s move, quickly catching up with the Mountains and Rivers Bell and slapping it.

*Guang Dang…*

A visible sound wave converged into an attack and, driven by Yang Kai, cut through the air like a sharp blade towards Mo Duo.

Mo Duo could not avoid this sudden attack and was struck by the condensed sound wave, stunning him for a moment and causing his face to contort in pain.

Given that the Mountains and Rivers Bell could influence and suppress his actions before, it would be harder for Mo Duo, who had just lost a Demon Heart, to resist its power now.

While Mo Duo was dazed, Yang Kai leapt over with a ferocious grin on his face.

Mo Duo jumped back instinctively, but Yang Kai grabbed his arm with his Dragon Claw like an iron hoop, and with a surge of power, broke all the bones in this arm.
