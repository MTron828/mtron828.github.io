Although he had fought against Yang Kai just now, he had only been probing his strength and had not used his all, but just now, in order to obtain that Origin Essence Crystal, a treasure which would give him a chance to reach the Third-Order Origin King Realm, Gong Sun Liang had not held back.

The blow he just delivered had a hundred percent of his strength behind it but was easily blocked by his opponent.

Not only that, but the counterforce he felt from Yang Kai was almost irresistible. Under the impact of this force, Gong Sun Liang felt like he was on a small boat in a stormy sea, the waves crashing in on him from all sides, threatening to drown him at any moment.

Gong Sun Liang was terrified when he realized this and while struggling to resist, he shouted, “Brother Li, what are you waiting for!”

He had to ask for help from Li Mao Ming.

Li Mao Ming frowned and shook his head, “Why... why...”

While complaining though, he too used his Domain to suppress Yang Kai.

In the end, he still owed Gong Sun Liang a favour and Yang Kai had returned the Venerable Token, meaning he was no longer a Purple Star Venerable; there were no moral concerns about him making a move against Yang Kai now.

Even so, he did not want to fight against a cultivator who was in the same realm as himself, so this time he only released his Domain to exert some pressure on Yang Kai instead of actually making a move.

From the left and right, two Second-Order Origin King Domains pressed down like two giant mountains, trying to crush everything between them to dust.

And at the very centre point of this vice was Yang Kai.

This put Yang Kai under great pressure and forced him to divert part of his strength to resist Li Mao Ming’s Domain. Gong Sun Liang saw this and immediately moved to regain the initiative, quickly suppressing Yang Kai.

While putting pressure on Yang Kai, he grit his teeth and spoke to Yang Kai sincerely, “Young man, there is a saying ‘A wise man will submit to the circumstances.’ Hand over that thing and this old master will no longer embarrass you, you can even receive high-level treatment as a guest of Purple Star, what say you?”

“Why do you sound like victory is already within your grasp?” Although Yang Kai had a difficult expression on his face, his demeanour was still extremely leisurely as he glanced over at Gong Sun Liang and asked in a composed tone.

Gong Sun Liang laughed at this question and spat, “Because this old master already has victory in hand!”

“Is that so!” Yang Kai grinned viciously and in the next moment, his Domain burst forth.

*Weng...*

With a low hum, the surrounding space destabilized, as if it was about to collapse and cave in.

Like a giant rock had been dropped into a calm lake, the power of Yang Kai’s Domain formed visible ripples in space as it spread outward.

*Kacha...*

A faint, cracking sound spread out.

Gong Sun Liang and Li Mao Ming’s faces changed greatly as the former exclaimed, “How can this be?”

He was shocked to discover that under the joint pressure of his and Li Mao Ming’s Domain, Yang Kai had not been suppressed; in fact, he was the one breaking their combined Domains apart.

Gong Sun Liang’s heart shook!

He had broken through to the Origin King Realm almost a thousand years ago and reached the Second-Order more than three hundred years ago. In other words, his Domain had been condensed and refined over nearly a millennium! For a thousand years, he had forged his Domain through his own unique comprehensions and insights. Few people in the entire Star Field could surpass him in this regard.

Li Mao Ming’s history was similarly profound.

But now, their two Domains combined could not push back Yang Kai’s and were literally cracking apart when faced with the latter’s. What did that mean? It meant that their two Domains put together were weaker than his!

This discovery made Gong Sun Liang’s blood run cold and his eyes filled with horror.

Only now did he realize that Yang Kai had never once used his full strength. Gong Sun Liang had overestimated Yang Kai’s strength as much as he thought possible, but he found he had still greatly underestimated his opponent, in the end.

“Not good!” Li Mao Ming shouted as he quickly withdrew his Domain, his face completely pale.

His Domain being cracked meant his foundation was cracked. If this continued and his Domain broke, it would most likely result in his realm regressing. Such a consequence was not something any Origin King would be able to bear.

Fortunately, he quickly realized what was happening and retracted his Domain, otherwise, he would have been in great danger.

With his Domain withdrawn, Gong Sun Liang alone could obviously not resist Yang Kai’s might and a dense series of cracks sounded through the air. Together with these sounds, Gong Sun Liang’s body trembled, and blood began to leak from his seven orifices.

His Domain, which had been condensed for a thousand years, was showing signs of collapsing.

After this battle, even if Gong Sun Liang did not die, he would need to enter retreat for at least a hundred years if he wanted to repair his Domain.

The battle was not over yet though, and from point blank range, Yang Kai pressed his Dragon Bone Sword fiercely towards Gong Sun Liang, sending an overwhelming force towards him that sent the latter flying.

*Huo...*

A resounding dragon roar filled the world as the Dragon Bone Sword transformed into a giant dark green dragon, its body swaying back and forth as its giant eyes fixed onto Gong Sun Liang. Diving towards its prey, it opened its giant maw and bit towards him, seemingly intending to swallow him whole.

“A Dragon Bone artifact!” Gong Sun Liang’s eyes bulged at this sight. Although he had felt that the other party’s artifact was somewhat different when Yang Kai had taken out the Dragon Bone Sword, he could not figure out why until now. This artifact was refined from Dragon Bone!

Those were the bones of an Ancient Divine Spirit! Any artifact created from such materials would be at least Origin King Grade.

The rich, nearly tangible Dragon Pressure impacted Gong Sun Liang’s Soul and body, causing him to tremble in fear and horror.

This was a kind of instinctual fear, as no one could face an Ancient Divine Spirit without having such emotions. This was something on a fundamental level!

Biting the tip of his tongue, Gong Sun Liang forcefully dispelled the discomfort in his heart and swiftly formed a series of seals with his hands while pushing his Saint Qi madly.

The next moment, his short sword artifact released a radiant light and transformed into a giant flood dragon.

This flood dragon gave off a dazzling multi-coloured light and had a mouth filled with sharp, jagged fangs. Releasing a roar, it shot towards the giant dark green dragon.

The two transformed Origin King Grade artifacts met mid-air and began to clash, releasing violent energy fluctuations that shook the whole of Purple Star City. The houses down below shattered like they were made from thousand-year-old rotten wood, bursting into pieces as massive gullies and trenches were dug out from the fallout of this great battle.

The surviving Origin Realm masters who had been observing from nearby were all hit hard as well, their expressions changing drastically as they did their best to retreat while defending themselves, each of them showing looks of shock from the terrifying aftermath they were subjected to.

Only a few of Purple Star’s Elders remained where they stood by relying on their high cultivations, but judging from their expressions, it was no easy task for them to resist the fallout from this battle. Each of these Elders’ expressions was extremely solemn but none of them were willing to withdraw or even close their eyes as they fixedly observed this raging conflict.

Battles between Second-Order Origin Kings were an extremely rare occurrence, and being able to spectate one was an even rarer opportunity. Anything they learned from observing this battle would surely benefit them greatly.

With a huge burst of energy, Yang Kai disappeared like a ghost, and when he reappeared, he was already right in front of Gong Sun Liang.

“You...” Gong Sun Liang gasped. At this moment, his momentum was already quite weak, and now that Yang Kai had mysteriously appeared within striking range...

Yang Kai did not say a word, his expression cold and determined as his fist flashed with five-coloured light, sending a punch towards Gong Sun Liang.

Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art!

This exquisite Body Tempering Secret Art was usable both offensively and defensively, able to penetrate the hardest of defences and protect against the most brutal of attacks. Yang Kai’s fist, covered in his Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi, was as solid and sturdy as an ordinary Origin King Grade artifact.

If this punch landed, Gong Sun Liang would take severe damage!

This fist was not swung very fast, and its path was extremely clear, but Gong Sun Liang was stunned to discover that he couldn’t dodge or avoid it at all.

This fist carried with it an absolute suppressive force! It was an attack that could not be resolved no matter what method he used!

If he was at his peak, Gong Sun Liang might have been able to retreat, but at this moment, having just suffered serious damage to his Domain, how could he resist? Only able to watch this glowing fist close in, Gong Sun Liang’s heart filled with panic.

At the crucial moment, a figure appeared in front of Gong Sun Liang. It was Li Mao Ming!

Li Mao Ming’s face was also extremely dignified as he lifted the wine bottle in his hand to his mouth and took a deep drink before spitting out fiercely.

*Hu...*

A blue flame burst forth from Li Mao Ming’s mouth and created a barrier between him and Yang Kai’s fist.

This flame was not hot, but extremely cold instead. As soon as this blue flame appeared, the whole surrounding world seemed to freeze over.

The five-coloured glow on Yang Kai’s fist flickered violently, as if it was about to be extinguished while at the same time a deep chill travelled up his arm all the way to his chest.

Yang Kai could not help trembling under this impact.

Glancing at the wine bottle and the blue flames in front of him, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he realized this was a rare and powerful treasure.

“Brother Yang, stop!” Seeing Yang Kai’s actions slow down, Li Mao Ming hurriedly shouted.

Yang Kai’s eyes simply narrowed though and ignoring Li Mao Ming’s plea, he shouted in a low voice, “Dragon Transformation!”

*Kacha...*

Yang Kai’s arm inflated to twice its normal size in that instant and under the shocked gazes of Li Mao Ming and Gong Sun Liang, Dragon Scales condensed from Saint Qi covered his arm and his outstretched fist transformed into a terrifying dragon claw. The Golden Divine Dragon aura that diffused from Yang Kai’s arm caused the two men facing it to tremble.

The wall of blue flame which was separating the two sides was easily broken through as these flames were unable to harm Yang Kai’s dragon-scale-covered arm in the slightest.

Li Mao Ming and Gong Sun Liang’s eyeballs bulged as they reacted instinctually and combined their strengths to counterattack, releasing a strike that was not weaker than an ordinary Third-Order Origin King’s attack towards Yang Kai’s terrifying dragon claw.

*Hong...*

High up in the sky, as if it was the end of the world, a brilliant burst of light erupted as a thunderous explosion rang out, blinding and deafening all who were observing.

In the next instant, three figures were sent flying out from the centre of this explosion.
