“Wait!” When he saw that Yang Kai was really planning to leave, Le Dong Zheng quickly shouted.

“Sect Master Le, what else do you need?” Yang Kai turned to look at him.

Le Dong Zheng narrowed his eyes and stared coldly at Yang Kai for a while before asking, “My three disciples… where are they now?”

“Hah!” Yang Kai laughed and looked jeeringly at Le Dong Zheng, “And here I thought that Sect Master Le really didn’t know anything. So, you were the one who sent the three of them?”

Bian Yu Qing’s face paled, as she looked at Le Dong Zheng with rage in her eyes. If what Yang Kai said was true, then Le Dong Zheng was the culprit responsible for Kou Wu’s death. Without his orders, she and Kou Wu wouldn’t have been chased after by those three people.

As if he didn’t hear that snide comment, Le Dong Zheng continued, “You haven’t answered this Old Master’s question yet.”

“Curious to know?” Yang Kai grinned, “Figure it out yourself!”

He turned around and left.

Le Dong Zheng was fuming. If not for the fact that Spirit Lake City forbade fighting, he would have rushed over to battle Yang Kai to the death. One of the three disciples he sent was his descendant, one he had high hopes for him. From Yang Kai’s tone, the fate of the three must be disastrous, so how could Le Dong Zheng’s heart not ache?

Gritting his teeth, he shouted, “Boy! Don’t let this Old Master see you outside the city, or he will kill you!”

Yang Kai scoffed and couldn’t even be bothered to turn around, giving Le Dong Zheng a sense of powerlessness as if he were punching at cotton. He almost coughed up a mouthful of blood from anger.

He watched Yang Kai leave with hatred in his eyes, inwardly deciding to himself that he would teach this little brat a harsh lesson; otherwise, his three disciples would have died in vain.

…..

“What are you doing? Go back and wait in line!”

In front of Spirit Lake Palace, a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator dressed in the uniform of Heavenly Martial Holy Land reached out to stop Yang Kai with an arrogant look on his face.

As a disciple of one of the Southern Territory’s top Sects, he naturally had the capital to act arrogant. What’s more, he was still young and had already reached the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, so the possibility of him breaking through to the Emperor Realm in the future was quite high.

Led by Star Soul Palace, Spirit Lake Palace was built under the joint efforts of all three of the Southern Territory’s top Sects, so it was naturally managed by the three of them.

Yang Kai took out a token and waved it in front of the man.

The Heavenly Martial Holy Land disciple instantly withdrew his arrogance and cupped his fists, “So it is a Senior Brother from Azure Sun Temple. May I know how to address Senior Brother?”

The token that Yang Kai held up was the Azure Sun Golden Token, a token that only Core Disciples were qualified to possess. Even though this man was from Heavenly Martial Holy Land, he was merely an inner disciple, a far cry from a Core Disciple. After confirming Yang Kai’s identity, he naturally didn’t dare to be too reckless.

Bian Yu Qing almost went cross-eyed at this sight. She had personally seen how arrogant and supercilious the cultivators guarding Spirit Lake Palace’s entrance were. Even Emperor Realm Masters would sometimes be greeted with disdainful looks by these top Sect disciples, so when she saw one cupping his fists and bowing to Yang Kai, then listening to what he said, Bian Yu Qing suddenly recalled that Yang Kai was with Azure Sun Temple when they went to the Four Seasons Realm back then.

It turned out that Yang Kai had already become a disciple of Azure Sun Temple, and from the looks of this situation, his status didn’t seem low. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to make this cultivator lower himself before him.

“Yang Kai!”

The disciple who was guarding the gate frowned at his words and thought carefully for a moment, but found that he was extremely unfamiliar with his name. He had never even heard of it.

He basically knew all of Azure Sun Temple’s Core Disciples, but he had never seen or heard of Yang Kai before. But the Azure Sun Golden Token couldn’t be faked. With this Golden Token, it meant that Yang Kai really was a Core Disciple of Azure Sun Temple.

When Yang Kai refined the Extraordinary Treasure Pill back then in the Four Seasons Realm, his fame spread across the entire Southern Territory, but since so many years had passed, news naturally died down and many cultivators spent much of their time in secluded retreat, so it was normal for them to have never heard of Yang Kai’s name before. This cultivator at the gate was clearly one of these people.

“So, it is Senior Brother Yang!” Even though that cultivator did not recognize Yang Kai, he didn’t dare to be any less polite to him, “May I ask if Senior Brother Yang has come this time in order to make use of the cultivation rooms?

“Indeed!” Yang Kai nodded.

When Gao Xue Ting handed him this Azure Sun Golden Token, she told him that in addition to the Heaven, Earth, and Mortal Grade cultivation rooms in Spirit Lake Palace, there were even better ones reserved for the disciples of the three Sects that were not open to the public. However, they were free to enter them with the Golden Token.

If not, Yang Kai wouldn’t have sold Bian Yu Qing’s Sapphire Token. Since there was an even better place for her to go, there was naturally no more use for that Sapphire Entry Token.

“Senior Brother Yang, please follow me. I’ll bring you to see the Sir Steward.” That man turned around after he finished speaking.

Yang Kai called out to Bian Yu Qing and followed him.

Bian Yu Qing had already figured out what Yang Kai was trying to do at this point, and her eyes were filled with gratitude. At the same time, she couldn’t help but smile bitterly. She had to spend all of her assets just to buy that Sapphire Entry Token after many difficulties, still having to wait eight months before her turn came. On the other hand, Yang Kai only needed to come here and he was allowed into a Heaven Grade cultivation room. Through this comparison, Bian Yu Qing realized that the convenience of being the disciple of a top Sect was beyond her imagination, and she couldn’t help but feel helpless at that fact.

Without a strong background, even if one really were to ascend to the Emperor Realm, they wouldn’t have much prestige in front of these large Sect’s disciples.

“What’re you doing?” Yang Kai suddenly turned around to look at Bian Yu Qing, frowning, suddenly realizing that her state was not quite right.

Bian Yu Qing was taken by surprise at his call and suddenly realized how dispirited her thoughts had become. With such a mindset, her already slim chances of breaking through to the Emperor Realm became even slimmer.

She immediately collected her thoughts and her eyes became determined!

That’s right, Kou Wu died in order to preserve that Sapphire Entry Token, all so he could leave a ray of hope behind for her to break through. If she couldn’t give him a satisfactory answer, how could she face Kou Wu in the future after her death?

Kou Wu’s blood could not be shed in vain.

“Nothing!” Bian Yu Qing smiled, a hard-to-describe sense of self-confidence and determination emanating from her body. She had a feeling that if she could find a good place to enter retreat at this moment, then her chances of breaking through to the Emperor Realm would be as high as thirty percent!

It had to be known that she only had a one in ten chance before this, so thirty percent was already very high.

Yang Kai stared at Bian Yu Qing seriously, watching her for a long time before turning his head away.

He had no idea what sort of psychological struggle Bian Yu Qing had just gone through in this short period of time, but he was pleased to see that she was in better form now.

That Heavenly Martial Holy Land disciple led Yang Kai and Bian Yu Qing to a room and said, “Senior Brother Yang, please wait for a moment. I’ll go and get the Sir Steward.”

“Many thanks!” Yang Kai nodded.

The man then turned and left.

“Thank you!” Bian Yu Qing suddenly spoke. This was already the second time she thanked Yang Kai since bumping into him again, and each time, she was thanking him from the bottom of her heart. In all her years of living, no one had ever shown her such kindness, so his actions moved her greatly.

Yang Kai smiled, “It’s just a trivial matter!”

While saying that, he casually tossed a few jade bottles over to her.

Bian Yu Qing accepted them and looked doubtfully at Yang Kai, “These are…”

“You can use these while you cultivate,” Yang Kai explained.

Curious, Bian Yu Qing opened up a jade bottle and peeked inside. In an instant, her entire body shook and she was wide-eyed, “This is… an Emperor Grade Spirit Pill?”

Looking into another bottle, it turned out to be another Emperor Grade Spirit Pill, and from the looks and fragrance of the pill from the first bottle, it seemed to be similar to the legendary Pure Heart Pill. The Pure Heart Pill was a pill that could help a cultivator focus their mind and alleviate any heart demons from disturbing them during cultivation.

Even though similar pills were available on the market, one at the Emperor Grade would definitely not appear. The best ones were no more than Dao Source Grade Mid-Rank, a far cry from the one inside this jade bottle.

The other bottle seemed to contain a Heavenly Dao Pill. This pill was even more shocking as it could help a cultivator perceive the Heavenly Way and assist them in comprehending Principle Strength…

With the help of these two Spirit Pills, her thirty percent chance rose up to at least fifty percent! If she still didn’t manage to make a breakthrough this time, then she probably wouldn’t ever be able to.

Holding the two bottles tightly in her hands, Bian Yu Qing’s heart was surging. She looked at Yang Kai with a complicated gaze as she commented, “I don’t know how to repay you for such a heavy gift.”

“It’s not like I’m asking for repayment,” Yang Kai stroked his chin and pondered for a moment, “But if you insist, then… Why don’t you join my Sect?”

“Azure Sun Temple?” Bian Yu Qing was dumbfounded.

This was another great gift, so how could it be considered repayment? Even if there weren’t ten thousand cultivators just like her who wanted to enter Azure Sun Temple, there were at least eight thousand. Azure Sun Temple was one of the top Sects in the Southern Territory, so how could she simply enter it?

If she really were able to join Azure Sun Temple, then even if she was a lowest-ranking disciple, it would still be better than wandering around on her own. A woman, and especially a beautiful woman like her with a charming face and an enchanting body, was prone to getting caught up in trouble when she was on her own. Sometimes, trouble would even come to her even if she stayed hidden.

“No, no, no, not Azure Sun Temple,” Yang Kai shook his head.

“No?” Bian Yu Qing was surprised.

Yang Kai smiled, “I founded my own Sect. Right now, my Sect has… En, ten people? It’s still a work in progress at this stage and we’re short of hands. Is Protector Bian interested?”

“Yes!” Bian Yu Qing didn’t even think for a moment before she agreed. Yang Kai had already helped her so much, so even if she had to give her life, she wouldn’t have hesitated, let alone just joining his Sect.

Bian Yu Qing didn’t think that the Sect Yang Kai founded would be that powerful as even though he was an Emperor Realm Master with strong abilities, every Sect had a development phase. Right now, there were less than ten members, so it was quite clearly a small Sect. Perhaps, it may even be worse than the Blue Feather Sect of the past.

But so what? As long as they worked together, the Sect would have a chance of becoming big in the future, and if she could break through to the Emperor Realm, then she would be an even greater help to Yang Kai, which would allow her to slowly repay his favour.

“You’re quite quick to agree!” Yang Kai grinned.

Bian Yu Qing brushed her hair behind her ear and smiled, “I’m also a person who knows gratitude, so you may rest assured. If I can safely come out of this retreat, I’ll follow you back to your Sect, but if I happen to die… then that’s just my destiny.”
