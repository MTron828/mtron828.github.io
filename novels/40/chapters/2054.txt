Chapter 2054, Ghost Hands Shen Tu

At a certain moment, a strange sound rang from inside the Black Jade Furnace, followed by a strong medicinal fragrance that permeated into the surroundings.

As a bit of fragrance drifted into Yang Kai’s nose and made its way into Yang Kai’s body, his Martial Dao bottleneck that had reached a critical juncture showed a slight sign of loosening. The calm Source Qi in his body madly started flowing.

Right then, Yang Kai opened his eyes and smacked the Black Jade Furnace, causing its lid to instantly fly up.

Immediately after, he quickly displayed the Nine Heavens Profound Pill Method that he had developed from the Grand Alchemic Dao Tone. His hands kept forming seals in succession as he continuously poured his energy into the Black Jade Furnace.

After a short while, the noises coming from the furnace became more and more obvious. It sounded like something was rolling inside the furnace.

Later, as Yang Kai withdrew his Pill Condensing Technique, streaks of light suddenly shot out of the Black Jade Furnace.

Yang Kai had been waiting for this moment. He immediately reached out, catching the several streaking things in his palm.

He didn’t have time to take a closer look at the result of his Alchemy. All he knew was that there were a total of six pills.

He promptly placed the newly-refined Dao Source Pills into the jade bottle that he had prepared in advance. Immediately after, he waved his hand as a large number of Source Crystals flew out of his Space Ring and fell on the ground, piling up in circles around him.

Some time ago, Yang Kai had killed many powerful enemies. He had gained no less than ten million Source Crystals from them, but for the sake of his own advancement, he threw out all ten million of them.

After all, the World Energy here was pretty scarce, and to meet the necessary requirement for his own advancement, he could only use these Source Crystals.

As soon as the Source Crystals appeared, a muffled thunder-like sound resounded above Yang Kai’s head. Suddenly, the World Energy became turbulent as the power of Principles started to circle around Yang Kai.

After a short while, a large black cloud appeared over Yang Kai’s head. The cloud started slowly rotating and taking a funnel shape.

Sand and rocks started to fly around everywhere as the sky went dark.

Seemingly under the effect of some mysterious force, the Source Crystals thrown around Yang Kai suddenly burst apart with crackling explosions. They instantly transformed into streams of pure energy that filled the surroundings before converging in the sky.

On the top of Yang Kai’s head, the black funnel vortex was growing at a speed visible to the naked eyes. It was quite a shocking sight.

The originally scarce World Energy in the surrounding grew extremely dense after being supplemented by the Source Crystals. And the place where Yang Kai was sitting was soon shrouded by a white mist. The white mist wasn’t real mist but a scene caused by the dense World Energy.

Yang Kai didn’t seem to be aware of this. He was still sitting cross-legged on the ground with his eyes closed. He looked extremely calm and at peace.

He was communicating with his Origin Essence Crystal in his consciousness and feeling the Heavenly Way Martial Dao. Meanwhile, the Star Source of Shadowed Star in his body happened to be regularly pulsating at this moment, as if it was being affected by something. With the blessing of this Star Source, Yang Kai could feel the power of the World Principles around him even more clearly.

He had absorbed many shattered Principle Fragments on the third level of the Five Colored Treasure Pagoda, and at this moment, they were getting incisively sublimated so that Yang Kai could brand his own perception and sublimate his realm.

With time, the black funnel in the sky grew larger and larger, almost covering the entire sky.

Even though Yang Kai had chosen a desolate land for his advancement and had even spent a few days clearing the Monster Beasts within a range of a thousand kilometres, some accidents were bound to happen. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

His advancement had caused such a huge commotion that he could still be noticed from a few thousand kilometres away.

When the black funnel that had covered a small part of the sky took shape, many cultivators in the distance had noticed this scene. Naturally, their curiosity was piqued and they rushed to the place where Yang Kai was advancing to check what was going on.

After these cultivators figured out that someone was advancing by a Great Realm and was about to welcome the World Energy baptism, most of the cultivators stopped, spectating from a few hundred kilometres away.

The cultivation of these cultivators wasn’t that high. After all, the overall strength of the cultivators in the vicinity of Maplewood City wasn’t that good. Most of them were Origin King or Origin Returning Realm masters, while there were even weaker ones as well.

Sensing how strong and violent the energy in the sky was, how would they dare step forward? After having come to join in the fun, they gathered around and started discussing, pointing in Yang Kai’s direction.

Among the crowd, there was a weak little girl in her twenties. She was only in the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm. Furthermore, she seemed to be suffering from some chronic disease and she was wearing a lot of clothes despite the warm weather. There were several Origin King Realm cultivators around her, guarding her. While the girl’s pretty eyes were focused into the distance, she suddenly started coughing.

The Origin King Realm masters around her immediately looked at her with concern but everyone seemed to be accustomed to this scene. So, they didn’t look too panicked. After the girl’s breath stabilized, they finally withdrew their gazes.

After a short while, a First-Order Origin King cultivator hastily flew over from the distance and arrived before the girl in a few flickers.

“Young Lady, I am back,” the cultivator quickly said.

“Did you find out who is advancing?” the girl asked in a gentle voice, parting her lips.

The cultivator shook his head and reported, “I’m sorry Young Lady. The World Energy there is too violent, and as that person is at a critical juncture of his advancement, I didn’t dare to get too close. So, I couldn’t see who it was. But according to my observation, this person should be breaking through to the Dao Source Realm!”

“As I’ve expected, he is indeed breaking through to the Dao Source Realm!” The girl in purple seemed to have expected it. She gently nodded. Her eyes suddenly lit up as she spoke, “Since that person decided to break through to the Dao Source Realm here, it means that he or she doesn’t have friends or relatives, or a Sect to back him. Obviously, that person is a lone master. He or she can be roped in!”

The Origin King Realm cultivators around the girl in purple slightly nodded in agreement after hearing this.

If one had the backing of a Sect or had friends or relatives, who would be willing to break through a Great Realm in this wilderness? Only a lone wolf would be forced to do this.

“That being said, Young Lady, with all due respect, this person might not be able to successfully break through,” another solemn-looking middle-aged man looked toward them and said with a serious look on his face.

“Why do you think so?” The girl in purple turned her gaze at him.

The middle-aged man wryly smiled. “The movement caused by him is just too great. It’s not something a peak Origin King Realm cultivator can bear. I should not say this, but if he is unable to bear the baptism of the World Energy, he simply has no hope of surviving. He will die for sure!”

All the other Origin King Realm repeatedly nodded their agreement after hearing this. They looked at the enormous black funnel in the sky with a look of fear. Obviously, if they were to take the baptism of such energy, it was absolutely impossible for them to succeed.

The girl in purple furrowed her black brows. “So to say, this person has very little hope of succeeding?”

The middle-aged man said, “Of course, that’s just my opinion. If, and only if, he really survived this catastrophe and crossed this juncture, his future achievements will be probably beyond our imagination.”

The girl in purple nodded after hearing this. She pondered for a while and said, “Anyway, let’s just protect him first. If he really advances, he will definitely remember our favour. At that time, we can try to recruit him. Now that the geniuses of my Qin Family are declining, we can only rely on just Old Ancestor’s support. We are hitting rock bottom, but if we can get this person’s help, my Qin Family can finally take a breath.”

Hearing this, the Origin King Realm cultivators nodded together and said, “If that’s what Young Lady wants, then Young Lady’s wish is our command.”

Just as this group of people were about to disperse and protect Yang Kai, the previous middle-aged man furrowed his brow and he suspiciously gazed toward a direction and shouted, “Dammit, someone is going to interfere with him!”

“Who is it?” The girl in purple was taken aback when she heard this. She looked along with the middle-aged man’s gaze and saw a streak of light shooting toward Yang Kai’s location. Not only were they not hiding their figures, but also had no intentions of hiding their goal. Each and every one was displaying an aggressive stance and malicious intention.

By a rough count, there were at least a dozen people in that streak of light. And the leading figure in that light was particularly bright.

The girl in purple hesitated for a while before she stomped her feet and said, “Come with me, let’s see if we can negotiate with them or not!”

While speaking, her tender figure flew toward that side with a jolt.

The middle-aged man was greatly shocked. He hurriedly chased after her with others.

Not far away, among the group of cultivators rushing toward Yang Kai, someone soon discovered the Qin Family group’s movement. They immediately shouted to the front, “Honored Master, someone is coming toward us.”

At the forefront, an almost bald old man with a short and fat stature suddenly stopped after hearing this. His pair of triangular eyes focused into the distance before quickly locking on to the Qin Family group. He then let out a cold snort and rebuked, “Several Origin King Realm cubs want to ruin this old master’s good deed? I have to hand it to their courage!”

“Honored Master, do you want us to...” the man made a gesture of beheading while he spoke this.

A grim smile immediately appeared on the old man’s face as he said, “Let’s see what they want to say first. Since they dare to come here, they probably have something to rely on. This old master wants to see what is making them this courageous.”

“Honored Master is wise!” that middle-aged man immediately flattered.

After a short while, the Qin Family group, led by the girl in the purple, arrived before the old man and the others.

The girl seemed to have expended a lot of her energy for this rush. He immediately broke into a fit of cough and couldn’t speak a word.

The middle-aged man and the others, who were closely following after her, gathered around the girl like the stars around the moon. And when the middle-aged man noticed the leading short and fat old man and his iconic bald head, he cried in shock as his face turned pale as if he was facing an enemy, “Ghost Hand Shen Tu!”
