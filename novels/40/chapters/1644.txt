Everything happened so suddenly that no one was able to react.

It wasn’t until three breathes after Bing Die had been hit that one of the disciples from the Law Enforcement Hall recovered and shouted, “Who goes there!”

At that moment, she turned to look at Yang Kai, but after seeing the face of the person who took action she couldn’t help staring blankly.

“A man?”

“Since when did our Pure Ice Island allow men to enter?”

“Where did this man come from? He forced Senior Sister Bing Die back and wounded her with a single palm.”

“Hey, isn’t he the one we were ordered to look for some time ago? So, we’ve already found him! No wonder the Elders recalled us.”

.....

The spectating female disciples from Ice Heart Valley behaved as if they were seeing an unexpected and novel creature as they stared at Yang Kai strangely. After discovering that he was the person they and their sisters had been searching for an entire year, they suddenly became excited.

All of them had worked hard outside the Sect for a year just to find a trace of Yang Kai, so now seeing him in the flesh, many couldn’t help wondering what was so special about him that Ice Heart Valley was willing to sacrifice so many disciples and resources to find him.

However, no matter how they looked, they couldn’t see any clues, only that Yang Kai seemed to be a little annoyed at the moment, his face extremely cold as he stood in front of Qing Ya like a towering mountain, blocking all winds and rain.

Such a scene made the disciples of Ice Heart Valley frown and speculate about the relationship between Yang Kai and Qing Ya.

The pain she was anticipating did not come, and instead, only Bing Die’s muffled cries rang in her ears, causing Qing Ya to open her eyes suspiciously only to find herself staring at Yang Kai’s back.

“What are you doing here?” Qing Ya asked in astonishment.

“I came over to talk to you, but I didn’t expect to encounter such a sight!” Yang Kai turned his head and glanced at her with concern, “Are you okay?”

Qing Ya shook her head and smiled bitterly, “It’s nothing serious.”

“Who hurt you?”

Qing Ya bit her red lips and refused to speak.

Yang Kai sighed slightly, took out a jade bottle from his Space Ring, and handed it over, “Take this and heal your injuries.”

Qing Ya reached out and accepted it, thanking him politely but not taking the pill inside right away. Instead, she turned her attention to Bing Die who was lying not far away with a complex expression.

After receiving Yang Kai’s palm, Bing Die looked extremely embarrassed, but she was not actually injured seriously. This was a result of Yang Kai holding back. Otherwise, with his current strength, he could have easily killed her with that blow.

This was Ice Heart Valley, after all, Su Yan’s Sect, so Yang Kai did not want to make doesn’t want too much of a fuss.

Hearing the conversation between Yang Kai and Qing Ya, Bing Die’s cold face showed a hideous expression as she leapt up and wiped the blood from the corner of her as she sneered, “Heal? She will not have a chance! Openly resisting the orders of an Elder, injuring a Law Enforcement Hall disciples, Outer Island disciple Qing Ya, today, you must die!”

Qing Ya’s tender body trembled as she clenched both her fists so tightly they began to bleed.

Yang Kai glanced over at Bing Die, his eyes as cold as a knife and a callous look upon his face.

“I’m the one who hurt you, so what crime has Qing Ya committed?”

“You won’t escape either! No matter what your origins are, since you dared act presumptuously in Pure Ice Island, you will not leave here alive. As for Qing Ya... she must die, not only has she colluded with outsiders, but she even brought a man into Pure Ice Island, corrupting the moral purity of my Ice Heart Valley! A male bastard and his female bitch sneaking into my Ice Heart Valley, what wicked scheme are you plotting?”

Qing Ya’s body shivered and her face paled as she stared at Bing Die, saying in a trembling voice, “Senior Sister Bing Die, I cannot let that pass, there is no such relationship between Yang Kai and me, and I have never done anything to corrupt the morals or shame the reputation Ice Heart Valley! Yang Kai is here only because...”

“Silence! You have no right to speak here!” Bing Die ground her teeth as she glared at Qing Ya, not allowing her to explain anything and snickering as she continued, “You are calling him so intimately, how dare you say you have no relationship with him?”

At this time, many of the spectating Ice Heart Valley disciples showed strange expressions.

Although Yang Kai and Qing Ya did not exchange more than a few words, anyone could infer from their attitude and tone that the relationship between the two wasn’t shallow. At the very least they were clearly familiar with one another.

Could there really be some untoward secret between them?

Qing Ya wore a saddened look as she pined, “Senior Sister, you may beat or even kill me, but you may not insult me. Since entering Ice Heart Valley, Qing Ya has never done anything to shame the Sect.”

Moreover, this matter was also related to Yang Kai. Yang Kai was Su Yan’s man, so no matter how muddled Qing Ya became, she couldn’t have any kind of intimate relationship with him.

“You haven’t done anything?” Bing Die looked at her viciously, “Instigating this man to sneak attack me is not a disgrace to the Sect?”

“I did no such thing!” Qing Ya retorted anxiously.

“Pure sophistry!” Bing Die snapped, “If it weren’t for your instigation, how could he appear here so timely!”

Qing Ya opened her mouth but was unable to respond.

“There’s truly no lack of charges with which to falsely incriminate someone!” Yang Kai’s face suddenly showed a look of disappointment, “Qing Ya, since there is no longer any place for you here, you need not remain.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

After saying so, he sighed and seemingly muttered to himself, “I thought that Su Yan would be well taken care of here, but now it seems that it is time to take her away. Staying in this filthy place will only tarnish her pure soul.”

Su Yan?

This man actually knew Su Yan?

And did he just say that... he wanted to take Su Yan away?

Was he sleep talking?

Men were all indeed unreasonable animals!

Many women looked at Yang Kai oddly, wondering if he was another poor fool who had been captivated by Su Yan’s charm?

Since Su Yan entered the Sect, although she had only gone out a few times, her reputation had spread across Scarlet Wave Star and even characters like Wei Feng, the son of Brilliant Flame Sect’s Sect Master, had never been able to forget her, let alone others.

Over the years, countless people from various great forces had come to Ice Heart Valley, hoping to let their young geniuses marry Su Yan. Among them were some talented rising stars with exceptional aptitude, but without exception, all were rejected by Ice Heart Valley.

Su Yan was the future hope of Ice Heart Valley, how could she be allowed to marry out of the Sect?

Rumours had it that even the Supreme Elder had high hopes for Su Yan, and would even teach Su Yan personally on occasion over the past few decades.

This was a great honour. In Ice Heart Valley, only the Valley Master and Great Elder were eligible to meet the Supreme Elder, no one else was qualified.

Su Yan was like a phoenix resting on a branch. Compared to her, all men on Scarlet Wave Star were like insects crawling on the ground.

No one was worthy of her!

Yang Kai suddenly making such a remake immediately sparked many misunderstandings among the women from Ice Heart Valley. They thought Yang Kai was like Wei Feng, enamoured with Su Yan but unable to obtain her and forced to pine for her from a distance.

“You, take Su Yan away?” Bing Die’s eyes flashed with anger as she shouted, “Only if you live past today can you continue spewing such nonsense! Ice Heart Valley disciples, obey my orders! Kill Qing Ya and this shameless man! Their deaths will serve as a warning to others who would dare infringe upon our Sect!”

As soon as Bing Die’s voice fell, the Law Enforcement Hall disciples who had followed her immediately rushed towards Yang Kai fearlessly.

It was not that they hadn’t seen the methods Yang Kai used to deal with Bing Die before, but the Law Enforcement Hall’s orders were absolute.

As for the disciples who were watching nearby, many chose to remain on sidelines while a few, due to the majesty of the Law Enforcement Hall’s reputation, secretly began condensing their Saint Qi as they stared at Yang Kai.

They did not want to attack Qing Ya, but they didn’t have any problem dealing with a male stranger like Yang Kai.

Ice Attribute Saint Qi surging in all directions, causing the already extremely cold ice peak to become more frigid, the air itself seemingly freezing.

The Law Enforcement Hall disciples who had rushed forward first, however, only got to within five metres of Yang Kai before being thrown backwards and falling to the snowy ground one by one, their faces pale, unable to stand up.

As for the Outer Island disciples who attacked Yang Kai, they too were forced backwards, their complexions turning pale as they stared at Yang Kai in shock, none of them daring to act rashly again.

No one saw how Yang Kai attacked just now, but the results of this brief conflict made them deeply understand just how massive the gap was between them.

“Yang Kai, don’t overdo it!” Qing Ya was shocked.

She had not expected that on Pure Ice Island, Yang Kai would dare attack so many Ice Heart Valley disciples.

A moment ago, he acted to save her, but now, he had actually displayed open hostility.

Although he did not kill anyone, from the looks of the Law Enforcement Hall disciples, it was obvious that their injuries were serious.

She did not care about the life or death of these people of course. After experiencing this event, Qing Ya’s sense of identity and belonging to Ice Heart Valley had disappeared.

She just wanted to leave here quickly.

What she was worried about was Yang Kai taking things too far and forcing Ice Heart Valley’s true masters to act!

At that time, even if Yang Kai had astonishing abilities, he would not be able to escape here easily.

Bing Die stood on the spot, staring at the scene in front of her for a moment before suddenly smiling, but this smile was like that of a poisonous viper, one who had their prey right where they wanted. “Good, good, good! This time, no matter who you are, you will die today!”

Yang Kai simply looked at her with narrowed eyes and calmly said, “You think I can’t see through this little charade of yours?”

The smile on Bing Die’s face suddenly became somewhat stiff.

“Why continue to conceal yourself? Come out! Your Excellency has watched long enough, right?” Yang Kai said as he suddenly waved his hand towards a spot in the sky, releasing a palm.

With a loud bang, this palm was intercepted and dispersed by some kind of invisible force, but in the spot where there was once nothing, a figure strangely appeared.

Countless Outer Island disciples looked up and suddenly shouted in shock, “Great Elder!”

“Disciple greets Great Elder!” Everyone came back to their senses and hurriedly saluted with respect.

The figure that appeared was none other than Ice Heart Valley’s Great Elder!

Ran Yun Ting is dressed in a lavender dress that gave her a noble appearance and her quiet aura was deep and profound; however, at this moment, she was staring towards Yang Kai with some slight surprise.

She had not expected Yang Kai to have discovered her existence so quickly.

She had thought everything was proceeding smoothly and secretly.
