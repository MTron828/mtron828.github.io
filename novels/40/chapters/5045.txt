Activating the Universe Transference Law required a few breaths of time, during which the person using it could not be disturbed; otherwise, it would definitely fail.

Even if the person successfully activated the Universe Transference Law and returned to the Purifying Black Ink Battleship in the forward base, it would take them two days to return to the battlefield. The battle would have ended by then; in which case, it was no different from weakening the Human Army.

However, things would be different if every Human soldier who fought against the Black Ink Clan had several Purifying Black Ink Pills with them. Even if they were invaded by Black Ink Strength, they wouldn’t turn into Black Ink Disciples as long as they could quickly consume a Purifying Black Ink Pill, allowing them to stay on the battlefield and continue fighting.

Therefore, Purifying Black Ink Pills would be more useful and convenient than Purifying Light on the battlefield.

“Since your arrival in the Inner Sanctum, Blue Sky Pass has become the centre of attention of all Humans. We’ve been in the limelight,” Zhong Liang let out a laugh again.

A puzzled Yang Kai asked, “What do you mean?”

Zhong Liang replied, “You see, you were the one who brought Purifying Light to us. When the news spread, the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters from different Great Passes personally brought their Purifying Black Ink Battleships to Blue Sky Pass. That was the first event. Then, you came up with the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors, and we were the ones who informed the Humans from different Great Passes about their refinement method. That was the second event. Now, we’ve successfully developed Purifying Black Ink Pills. The pill recipe will be sent to the other Great Passes, and once they get it, they will all be over the Moon and grateful to Blue Sky Pass. That’s the reason we’re the centre of attention, and you’re the one who has brought us such glory.”

“It is this Junior’s duty, nothing more.”

Zhong Liang shook his head, “In the past, I’d never expected that one person could single-handedly change the status quo on this vast battlefield. As I grew older and started losing hope, there came a day when you arrived and changed everything.”

“Perhaps I’m just lucky.” Yang Kai put on a smile.

Zhong Liang flashed a smile at him as well, “It’s not just about luck. Perhaps we’ll finally see some changes on this seemingly never-changing battlefield. Never mind, let’s not talk about it. Is everything going well with your cultivation?” He suddenly changed the topic.

Yang Kai replied, “Everything’s fine.”

Zhong Liang nodded, “I can see that your aura has become denser compared to several years ago. It’s apparent that your power has increased significantly; however, the cultivation of an Open Heaven Realm Master is a process of accumulation. Hence, you must not be too proud or impatient. Don’t try to run before you can walk. You just ascended to the Seventh Order several years ago, so there’s no rush for you to try to make it to the Eighth Order. Given your aptitude and heritage, it will naturally happen when the time comes. If it’s not the right time yet, it’s pointless for you to work excessively hard.”

Yang Kai replied respectfully, “I understand.”

Zhong Liang went on to say, “Since you understand, there’s no rush for you to continue cultivating. There’s something I need you to do.”

“What is it?” Yang Kai gazed at him.

Zhong Liang replied, “Several years ago, you opened up 11 portals to Sealed Worlds in the resource harvesting area around forward base 4. Did Cha Hu tell you that the Sealed Worlds on the Black Ink Battlefield tend to be clustered?”

Yang Kai nodded, “He did mention it.”

“Good.” Zhong Liang ran his fingers through his beard, “The thing is, we’ve found quite a number of Sealed Worlds in different places in the Blue Sky Theatre in the past. Most of the time, we could only find one to two Sealed Worlds in any given place, but we suspect that there are still a lot of hidden Sealed Worlds around the places where Sealed Worlds were previously found. It’s just that we didn’t have the means to look for the hidden portals. Hence, we’re unable to extract the resources in those Sealed Worlds.”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai said, “Do you want me to go to the places where Sealed Worlds were previously found to look for hidden portals?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“En,” Zhong Liang nodded, “You’re a Master of the Dao of Space, so it shouldn’t be difficult for you to find more hidden portals. There are a lot of valuable items in those Sealed Worlds, after all. Just getting more Profound Yin Spirit Fruit Trees would be extremely useful to the Inner Sanctum.”

Upon listening to his intention, Yang Kai nodded, “In that case, I’ll get prepared and set off.”

Zhong Liang waved his hand, “There’s no need to get prepared. Just set off now. I’ve informed Dawn Squad about it, and they’re waiting for you outside the Inner Sanctum. You just have to join them. I’ve asked someone to tell Feng Ying about the places where Sealed Worlds were previously found. She’ll lead you there.”

Yang Kai was stunned as he had never expected Zhong Liang to be so well prepared. He had even informed Dawn about it, so it was apparent that he didn’t intend to let Yang Kai continue cultivating; however, since it was his order, Yang Kai naturally wouldn’t disobey. He then cupped his fist and said, “I’ll get going now, then.”

Zhong Liang nodded, “There’s no rush in dealing with this matter. You can come back when you’re done with it. On the other hand, when you’re handling this matter, no one from the Inner Sanctum will contact you. Unless you fall into danger, you won’t have to inform us about whatever you do. Be safe when you’re outside.”

A puzzled Yang Kai responded and left. He had a feeling that Zhong Liang was acting strangely, but he couldn’t really tell what was off.

After he was gone, a figure abruptly appeared beside Zhong Liang. The person was none other than the Eastern Army Commander, Ding Yao.

“Has he left?” Ding Yao asked.

Zhong Liang nodded, “Yes.” Then, he asked, “Where’s that old fart surnamed Tang?”

Ding Yao shrugged, “Shen Tu is dealing with him now.”

Zhong Liang frowned, “What’s that old fart up to, coming all the way here to Blue Sky Pass?”

Ding Yao shook his head, “Tang Qiu never said anything; however, he’s an Eighth-Order Master, so he must have used a lot of resources to be sent to this place from Yin-Yang Pass. He certainly wouldn’t come here for no reason.”

Zhong Liang scowled, “Could it be what we think? He’s here to lure Yang Boy to his side seeing that he created so many wonderful things?”

Ding Yao instantly sported a ferocious expression, “How dare he!”

“Regardless of whether he has the guts to do so, I reckon that it’s indeed his intention. He already expressed such intentions when he visited previously. It’s just that Yang Boy didn’t leave with him. Since he has come all the way here again this time, it’s clear to us what he’s up to. In any case, Yang Boy is considered a member of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven while Tang Qiu is an Eighth-Order Ancestor from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven as well as an Army Commander of Yin-Yang Pass, so it’s expected that he wants to bring Yang Boy back with him.”

“Once a member of Blue Sky Pass, always a member of Blue Sky Pass!” Ding Yao snorted, “If that old fart surnamed Tang really has his eyes on Yang Boy, I’ll definitely beat him up.”

Zhong Liang shot him a glance, “I’ll be looking forward to it, then. Don’t back down when the time comes.”

Ding Yao scoffed in response.

Zhong Liang chuckled, “Let’s go probe that old fart first. It’s been a few days since he arrived, so we can’t possibly keep ignoring him.”

Meanwhile, Shen Tu Mo was accompanying a middle-aged man who was clad in simple clothes. They were having a chat while walking around. Nevertheless, Shen Tu Mo remained impassive and didn’t speak much while the middle-aged man was apparently the more talkative one.

This middle-aged man named Tang Qiu was the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven whom Yang Kai had met before. He was also an Army Commander.

When Tang Qiu brought the Purifying Black Ink Battleships refined by Yin-Yang Pass to Blue Sky Pass back then, he met up with Yang Kai. He had also brought Xu Ling Gong with him.

A moment later, Tang Qiu suddenly stopped in his tracks and put on a bitter smile, “Brother Shen Tu, it seems that I’m not welcome in Blue Sky Pass. I’m truly saddened.”

There was a dispassionate expression on Shen Tu Mo’s face as he replied, “We’ve always been sincere and welcoming to our friends; however, if it’s an enemy, he’ll be greeted by the Secret Techniques of our several ten thousand soldiers.”

The corners of Tang Qiu’s face twitched, “Why is this Tang an enemy of Blue Sky Pass?”

Shen Tu Mo turned around, showing only his profile, “Brother Tang, it’s up to you whether you want to be our friend or foe.”

A speechless Tang Qiu broke into laughter, “I don’t understand, Brother Shen Tu. Please make it clear to me.”

Shen Tu Mo shook his head in silence.

Tang Qiu let out a sigh, “Forget it. Since you don’t welcome me here, I’ll leave now.”

“Farewell!” Shen Tu Mo extended his hand, as though he was eager to see him leave.

Tang Qiu’s chest heaved with fury. He suppressed his anger and said resentfully, “I’ll definitely leave, but there’s one person I have to see before that.”

Shen Tu Mo looked cautiously at him, “Who do you want to see?”

Tang Qiu replied, “Yang Kai!”

“You’ve finally revealed your ulterior motive, Old Fart! I knew you were up to no good coming all the way here to Blue Sky Pass! You’re really here to snatch Yang Kai!” Someone was heard growling. The next moment, two figures descended from the sky. They were none other than Zhong Liang and Ding Yao, who happened to arrive and hear what Tang Qiu had just said.

The moment they landed on the ground, Zhong Liang turned to Ding Yao, “Haven’t you heard what he said, Brother Ding? What are you waiting for?”

Ding Yao balled up his fist and palmed it loudly.

An alerted Tang Qiu yelled, “What are you trying to do?”

It wasn’t until this moment that he realised that three Army Commanders of Blue Sky Pass had surrounded him, causing him to sweat.

Ding Yao grinned in an eerie manner, “Well, it’s our duty to beat up anyone who’s ill-intentioned here.”

Tang Qiu was dumbfounded, “Why do you think this Tang is ill-intentioned?”

Zhong Liang snorted, “You failed in your attempt to get Yang Kai to go to your side previously, so we never expected that you would still have the nerve to come try again! It seems that we’ve been too magnanimous. You probably won’t learn your lesson unless we beat you up!”

Tang Qiu quickly raised his hands, “Wait a moment. That’s not this Tang’s intention! The reason I want to see Yang Kai is that one of the Purifying Black Ink Battleships from Yin-Yang Pass has run out of Purifying Light, so I’d like him to help replenish it.”

“Do you think I’ll believe you?” Zhong Liang sneered and waved his hand, “Kill!”

Three figures instantly shot towards him like they were arrows.

“You…” Tang Qiu was flabbergasted as he hadn’t expected that they would really dare to make a move. He was already surrounded by them, to begin with, and he had missed the best chance to escape. How was he supposed to counterattack at this moment?

He clumsily dodged their attacks, but to no avail.

Fortunately, these four Eighth-Order Army Commanders didn’t forget the fact that they were in the Inner Sanctum, so they made sure that their powers didn’t leak beyond a radius of 10 metres. Despite that, it was still a world-shaking battle.
