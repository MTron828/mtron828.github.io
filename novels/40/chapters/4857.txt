“That’s right.” Yang Kai nodded.

“What are you going to do?” Luo Ting He asked.

“I have to head to the Black Prison to look into the matter. Regardless of who the culprit is, I’ll make them pay.” There was a cold expression on Yang Kai’s face.

He had no idea who had made a move on the Black Prison, but Luan Bai Feng had been working for him for a long time now. She had also made a huge contribution when they were dealing with Zuo Quan Hui back then. Certainly, the ill-intentioned people were aware that she was Yang Kai’s subordinate as well as a person from Void Land.

Since the unknown enemy dared to make a move on Luan Bai Feng, their real target was probably Yang Kai. Furthermore, given Luan Bai Feng’s cultivation, coupled with her advantageous position in the Black Prison, the person who was able to kill her must be in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm at the very least, and the person was no ordinary Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

In other words, the person was probably from one of the Cave Heavens or Paradises. The High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters from the Shattered Heaven wouldn’t have the guts to enter the 3,000 Worlds.

Was it Thousand Crane Paradise or Myriad Demons Cave Heaven? Yang Kai reckoned that he only had some grudges with these two Sects, but he couldn’t think of the reason they decided to kill Luan Bai Feng.

At this moment, Yang Kai felt fortunate that Luo Ting He had also tagged along; otherwise, he, Qu Hua Shang, and Tao Ling Wan might not be able to accompany him to Black Territory.

Regardless of the danger in Black Territory, there wouldn’t be a problem as they had Luo Ting He, who was a new Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, with them.

Therefore, the ship changed directions and headed straight to Black Territory.

They never encountered any danger on the road, and a few months later, they arrived at a Great Territory that was just beside Black Territory.

Yang Kai didn’t rush into Black Territory to look into the matter. Since Luan Bai Feng and Xin Peng were dead, it suggested that a turn of events had already taken place in Black Territory. No one knew what was going on there. Although they had Luo Ting He, an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, with them, they still had to be careful.

They thus hid on a shattered Spirit Province and waited patiently.

Yang Kai had been to this place once before. This was the location where he ambushed Xin Peng, who had just left Black Territory at that time, and forced him to leave his name on the Loyalty List. He then subdued Luan Bai Feng and took control of the Black Prison.

Even though there were countless Ore Stars in Black Territory that were full of materials, the place was considered barren when it came to anything else. Luan Bai Feng was a woman who enjoyed the finer things in life; therefore, she would periodically tell someone to buy some daily necessities and luxuries from a Star City in the neighbouring Great Territory.

Yang Kai wanted to wait for someone to come out so that he could find out the current situation in Black Territory.

He was pretty lucky. After waiting for half a month, Yang Kai, who was meditating, heard Qu Hua Shang saying, “Junior Brother, someone has come out.”

Yang Kai hurriedly looked up and saw that a person emerged from the Territory Gate that was connected to Black Territory. The person was heading straight to the Star City.

As Yang Kai looked intently at the person, he soon widened his eyes in disbelief.

“What’s wrong?” Luo Ting He asked.

“That’s Xin Peng!” Yang Kai scowled.

Upon hearing that, Luo Ting He was stunned, “The one whose name has disappeared from the Loyalty List? Didn’t you say he was dead?”

She had no idea who Xin Peng was, but she remembered the name after Yang Kai mentioned the Loyalty List to her previously.

Yang Kai said, “For a name to disappear from the Loyalty List, it’s either that I let the person go or they pass away. I’ve never changed anything on the Loyalty List, but their names have disappeared. That’s why I thought they were dead.”

However, now it was obvious to him that Xin Peng was still alive and kicking. In that case, what about Luan Bai Feng?

“Could it be possible that the Loyalty List malfunctioned, or it’s a fake?” Luo Ting He turned her head and asked.

“That’s impossible.” Yang Kai shook his head, “The Loyal List is genuine, and I’ve always kept it on me, so there’s no damage on it.”

A glint flashed through Qu Hua Shang’s eyes, “In that case, they’ve probably found a way to safely remove their names from the Loyalty List.”

That might be possible, but Yang Kai didn’t think Xin Peng and Luan Bai Feng were capable of doing that. Even if they were able to do that, it wouldn’t bring them any benefits by doing so.

Black Territory was a strategic location that was under Yang Kai’s control, so Luan Bai Feng and Xin Peng had to listen to his command as well. In fact, Yang Kai had never treated them unjustly over the years. He had always been magnanimous when it came to rewarding his subordinates.

Mao Zhe and the others had enjoyed countless resources in Void Land over the years. Not only did they not have to worry about putting food on the table, they also held important positions in the Sect and were respected by all its members.

They didn’t have a reason to take the risk of removing their names from the Loyalty List.

Was there a senior expert who was behind all of this? What could their intentions be though?

“Instead of making speculations, why don’t you just go over and ask him?” Luo Ting He was a woman of action, that was the reason she dashed into the Samsara Pavilion back then over a trivial matter and set up an extremely difficult Heart Barrier, then waited for Senior Brother Sun to look for her.

That was indeed a good way of finding out more information. Regardless of how they were able to remove their names from the Loyalty List or whether there was a senior expert behind the scenes, Yang Kai would figure out everything by asking them.

If the senior expert wanted to lure Yang Kai to Black Territory, his plan would be revealed after Yang Kai met up with Xin Peng.

At the thought of this, Yang Kai decided to leave the hiding place as the ladies followed him closely.

In the void, Xin Peng, who had turned into a ray of light, was rushing to the Star City in this Great Territory. When he saw someone standing in his way all of a sudden, he was astounded.

He instinctively activated his World Force and bellowed, “Who is it!”

“Xin Peng, we haven’t met for many years. Don’t you recognise me anymore?” Yang Kai said, staring at him.

Upon hearing his voice and making out his face, Xin Peng was evidently shocked. He then quickly saluted him and replied, “Sect Master, I’m sorry for being rude. Please forgive me.”

“It’s fine. Where are you going?” Yang Kai asked impassively.

Xin Peng wouldn’t even dare to lift his head as he replied, “I’m going to the Star City to buy some daily necessities for Elder Luan.”

Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters like Luan Bai Feng who worked for Yang Kai were all the Elders of Void Land. That was the reason Xin Peng called her Elder Luan now.

Of course, that was how he addressed her in front of Yang Kai, the Sect Master. It wasn’t certain what he called her in private.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, “Does Elder Luan have the urge to drink again?”

Luan Bai Feng was an alcoholic. Yang Kai only realised it through his observation after he took her on as a subordinate. When there was a task she had to carry out, she wouldn’t even drink a drop of wine; nevertheless, when there was some free time, she loved to indulge herself in alcohol.

Black Territory didn’t have ingredients for making wine, so she would always tell Xin Peng to buy a lot of wine from the Star City in a neighbouring Great Territory; however, she would soon finish all the wine and tell Xin Peng to get more.

That has always been the case over the years.

Xin Peng smiled meekly, “You indeed have acute eyesight, Sect Master. Elder Luan… said that she wanted to drink a little wine. You happen to come back at the right time. Elder Luan always says that it feels lonely to drink wine on her own. Now that you’re here, Elder Luan will have fun drinking to her heart’s content.”

Yang Kai stroked his chin, “I haven’t met her in years, but she remains the same.”

[As expected, Luan Bai Feng is alive as well.] Yang Kai already had this speculation when he saw that Xin Peng was still safe and sound. Xin Peng’s words had also confirmed his speculation.

Luan Bai Feng was still alive, but for some reason, their names had disappeared from the Loyalty List.

Furthermore, Xin Peng’s reaction suggested that he wasn’t aware of this fact; otherwise, he wouldn’t have remained so calm and collected.

If he knew that his name had disappeared from the Loyalty List, he would’ve become flustered the moment he saw Yang Kai; however, even though he appeared slightly nervous, he wasn’t afraid one bit as he still behaved like usual.

Could Yang Kai’s other speculation be wrong? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He initially thought that a senior expert had made a move to help remove Luan Bai Feng and Xin Peng’s names from the Loyalty List; however, it didn’t seem to be the case now.

Xin Peng could only smile in response as he didn’t have the audacity to say anything when Yang Kai remarked on Luan Bai Feng’s behaviour.

He secretly took a glance at the ladies behind Yang Kai and realised that he didn’t know them either; however, these women were all beautiful in their own ways. He couldn’t help but think that the Sect Master was truly lucky to be always surrounded by such women.

Yang Kai already had several wives at home, but he still managed to bring back three more!

Xin Peng went on to say, “Where have you been all these years, Sect Master? It was rumoured that you had entered the Chaotic Dead Territory. While everyone thought that you were dead, Elder Luan and I knew that you were still alive, and you would emerge sooner or later.”

Yang Kai’s safety would have a direct impact on Xin Peng and the others. Since they were still alive, it meant that nothing had happened to Yang Kai.

Therefore, when the rumour spread that Yang Kai had lost his life in the Chaotic Dead Territory, the people whose names were on the Loyalty List knew that he was still alive. With that said, they had been apprehensive as well, for the Chaotic Dead Territory was known to be a dangerous place. They were worried that Yang Kai would be doomed to die sooner or later.

If something happened to Yang Kai, all of them would lose their lives as well.

Xin Peng was genuinely pleased when he saw Yang Kai appearing in front of him as he could finally be at ease.

Yang Kai nodded, “I did come across some accidents. Since you’re going to buy wine for Elder Luan, you should go now. I’ll be waiting for you here, and we’ll enter Black Territory together.”

After hesitating for a moment, Xin Peng asked inquisitively, “Why don’t I send you into Black Territory first?”

“There’s no need for that.” Yang Kai waved his hand.

It was then Xin Peng left the place in a hurry. It was apparent that he wanted to buy the wine and return quickly.

As Yang Kai watched him leave, he asked the others, “Did you see anything unusual?”

Luo Ting He shook her head, “There’s nothing unusual about his behaviour. Although he was nervous, it was only about as much as a subordinate would be when dealing with their leader.”

Qu Hua Shang nodded, “I don’t see anything wrong with him either.”

The fact that there was nothing off about Xin Peng suggested that something must have gone wrong somewhere else.

Yang Kai suddenly had a feeling that the matter regarding Black Territory was more complicated than he thought.

Tao Ling Wan parted her lips, as though she was trying to say something, but she couldn’t bring herself to speak in the end. Seeing that, Qu Hua Shang asked with a smile, “Do you see anything unusual about that person, Senior Sister Tao?”

Yang Kai instantly turned to look at her.

A blushing Tao Ling Wan said in a small voice, “It seems that he isn’t aware that his name has disappeared from the Loyalty List…”

Yang Kai arched his brow, “Why do you say so?”

Tao Ling Wan replied, “If he were aware of it, he would’ve been apprehensive. T-That’s because the fact that his name has disappeared from the Loyalty List suggests that he has betrayed you. In that case, he should have been afraid when he saw you.”
