Yang Kai couldn’t imagine how a force’s leader could manage even one Cultivation Star, much less several of them. Their schedule would probably not have a single free moment of time. When would they even find time to cultivate?

“Layers upon layers of management,” Shen Tu explained with a smile, “There are high-level managers, then mid-level managers, then low-level managers, each one responsible for the level below them. The ones at the top don’t need to deal with everything.”

Hearing this explanation, Yang Kai realized he had just asked a stupid question and immediately kept quiet.

Yang Kai had never been in or reached such a position before, nor had he ever sought out such a position, so he felt such things were somewhat asinine, but people seek higher heights just like water flows down to the sea. Ultimately, this was just a different method of reaching the top .

Beasts had pack leaders while empires had monarchs. Standing atop a mountain, one would be able to enjoy the unique scenery and have the ability to command the subjects beneath them, but this wasn’t something Yang Kai concerned himself with.

After an hour or so, a group of buildings that covered a vast area appeared in front of the trio and Shen Tu instructed Yang Kai to land.

The designs of these buildings were strange, something Yang Kai had never seen before, many of them were like giant spires that stood thousands of meters high and were clustered all together.

“We’re here. Everywhere within a three thousand kilometre radius is my personal territory,” Shen Tu leapt off the Star Shuttle and spread out his arms, breathing in the air in an exaggerated manner, a cheerful look upon his face.

Yang Kai and Bi Ya also retrieved their Star Shuttles and landed behind him.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to examine his surroundings and was amazed to discover that there were several hundred cultivators in the area. These cultivators had varying cultivations, some of them not very high at all, only at the Transcendent Realm, Immortal Ascension Boundary, or even True Element Boundary. There were also a number of powerful auras comparable to that of Yue Xi and Lu Gui Chen.

Saint King Realm masters!

Yang Kai understood that there were a lot of masters in the Star Field, but even these masters had to grow step by step from the Initial Element Stage, to Qi Transformation Stage, Separation and Reunion Boundary, True Element Boundary, Immortal Ascension Boundary, etc....

Cultivation was a continuous process of breaking through one’s limits in order to obtain more and more tyrannical strength.

However, in order to escape the bounds of the Cultivation Star they were born in and travel to the Starry Sky, they had to at least reach the Saint Realm, so none of those Yang Kai saw out amongst the stars was weak.

Beneath the Saint Realm, even with the protection of a Star Shuttle, most didn’t dare risk traversing the Starry Sky.

Even brief contact with the power of the Starry Sky would be enough to kill them! Such cultivators had to shelter themselves inside great Starships to ensure their safety.

It seemed that because of the arrival of the group of three, the cultivators in this place had become alert and a middle-aged man in a black suit quickly appeared from inside. After seeing Shen Tu though, this man couldn’t help wearing a happy expression and shouting, “Young Master Shen Tu, you’ve come back?”

“En, I’ve returned,” Shen Tu nodded at him and grinned, “Has anything happened here since I left?”

The middle-aged man shook his head and said, “Nothing of importance, but President Ai Ou has been looking for you since six months ago. Because Young Master suddenly disappeared, President flew into a rage for quite some time.”

Hearing this, Shen Tu paled, shrinking his neck, “Did father come looking for me? What did he say?”

The middle-aged man shook his head, “President didn’t say anything, he only ordered that you see him as soon as you returned!”

Shen Tu’s expression became bitter as he muttered, “I’m finished. Death might be avoidable, but Father will definitely peel a layer of skin at least.”

As the two of them spoke, Yang Kai silently observed and quickly determined that this middle-aged man and the few masters hidden around this compound were subordinates of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce sent to protect Shen Tu.

The middle-aged man was also observing Yang Kai and Bi Ya. He didn’t show much reaction to Yang Kai, but upon seeing Bi Ya, he wore an obviously disgruntled expression.

He seemed to be able to see at a glance that Bi Ya was a promiscuous woman and probably thought that she had seduced Shen Tu into accepting her.

“Young Master, these two are...” The middle-aged man continued to stare at Yang Kai and Bi Ya.

“Right, this guy is Yang Kai!” Shen Tu wrapped his arm around Yang Kai’s shoulder in a friendly manner and said, “He is a life or death brother I met while outside. En, Uncle Jia Long should regard him as my life’s benefactor.”

“Young Master’s benefactor?” The middle-aged man named Jia Long wore a stunned expression but didn’t ask anything, quickly cupping his fists to Yang Kai and saying, “Many thanks to little brother for your care of my Young Master. Young Master has been stubborn and disobedient since he was young and has probably caused little brother much trouble, I hope little brother can be broad-minded!”

“Senior is too polite, Shen Tu and I both helped one another,” Yang Kai smiled humbly.

Jia Long gently nodded, showing a satisfied look upon his face.

“This woman...” Shen Tu pointed to Bi Ya, “En, she was originally a Purple Star cultivator, but now wishes to join our Chamber of Commerce. Please arrange things for her Uncle Long.”

“Purple Star?” Jia Long frowned, “Her strength is a bit low...”

“As long as I can enter secluded retreat, I will be able to break through to the Saint King Realm within half a month!” Bi Ya hurriedly declared, clearly anxious to obtain a place to take shelter.

“Half a month to break through to the Saint King Realm?” Jia Long’s thick brow rose slightly, “If you become a Saint King, our Chamber of Commerce will gladly welcome you, en, you can enter secluded retreat here for the time being.”

Saying so, he gently clapped his hands and a guard immediately flew out from the palace and landed beside him.

“Lead this young lady to a cultivation room and provide her with some Saint Crystals and pill,” Jia Long said.

“Yes.”

“Thank you Young Master Shen Tu, thank you Senior Jia Long,” Bi Ya’s pretty face showed a happy look as she bowed elegantly to Shen Tu before turning to Yang Kai, “I hope we meet again.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

After Bi Ya was led away, Shen Tu enthusiastically ushered Yang Kai into the palace.

The middle-aged cultivator called Jia Long followed suit.

The guards and maidservants they met along the way all bowed and saluted respectfully.

“Brother, I’m going to go bathe and change, you should do so as well. If there is anything you’d like to talk about, we can do so a bit later,” Inside the palace, Shen Tu said casually, “Don’t think of yourself as an outsider here.”

“Good,” Yang Kai accepted politely.

Shen Tu smiled before reaching out and wrapping his arms around two young girls before walking towards the inside of the building while smirking.

“Young Master Yang, this way please!” Another maidservant with beautiful looks and a graceful figure walked up to Yang Kai and beckoned for him to follow her.

Behind her, Yang Kai walked through the palace.

Although Shen Tu had said he was an illegitimate son of President Ai Ou whose existence wasn’t disclosed to the public, from the extent of the territory he was given to the staff he was provided with, it was obvious that Shen Tu did not have a low position in President Ai Ou’s heart.

If that were not so, there wouldn’t be several Saint King Realm cultivators acting as bodyguards in this place, nor would Shen Tu have been granted dominion over a three thousand kilometre radius piece of land.

Yang Kai wasn’t interested in inquiring about other peoples’ affairs though and simply followed behind the maidservant, soon arriving at a large room.

Inside this room was a grand bed covered with light pink translucent curtains, giving it a warm aura.

The room was filled with flowers and a short distance away there was a massive bath made from the purest white jade. This bath was filled with hot water that gave off a light steamy mist.

Colourful flower petals floated atop the bath and beside it were a number of beautiful women wearing revealing negligee. When these women saw Yang Kai walk in, they all smiled and bowed politely.

The light mist surrounding them added an element of mystery to their beauty.

The white steam lightly wet the thin clothes they wore and caused them to cling to their seductive curves, emphasising their amazing body lines.

Yang Kai was stunned, not having expected to suddenly encounter such a scene, his pulse increasing slightly as his breathing became a bit heavy as he stared towards these young women.

Their ages didn’t seem too high and each of them had perfect, snow-white skin that was full of rosy, seductive lustre. They had outstanding appearances and a variety of temperaments as well as charming smiles and enchanting bodies that could fascinate any man.

To Yang Kai’s obvious gaze, some of them responded boldly with hot eyes while others showed bashful appearances, covering their most sensitive places with their hands in an alluring manner...

[That Shen Tu actually lives such an indulgent lifestyle...]

Yang Kai couldn’t help commenting to himself.

“Does Young Master need your servant to help you remove your clothes?” The maidservant who had led him here, seeing Yang Kai freeze up, showed an intoxicating smile and couldn’t help calling out softly.

Yang Kai took back his gaze and shook his head before asking, “Was all this arranged by your Young Master?”

“It was this servant who made these arrangements...” The maidservant replied, “But it was in lines with Young Master Shen’s intentions, he made a point of mentioning that Young Master is an honoured guest so this servant made sure to provide the highest level of reception possible. En, Young Master is only the second person to enjoy this level of service.”

“Oh? Have you received someone like this once before?”

“Yes,” The maidservant nodded, “But Young Master may rest assured that these sisters all still possess their innocence and have not been tarnished in any way, they are also very happy to serve Young Master Shen Tu’s guests.”

“Why would they be very happy?” Yang Kai asked curiously.

“Because Young Master Shen Tu has a graciousness to them, each of them volunteered to become a maidservant here, no one has forced them to do anything. Before arranging for them to come here, this servant has consulted with and received each of their agreement.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Yang Kai once again looked towards the young women in front of him and discovered that they truly didn’t show any signs of unwillingness, understanding that the maidservant who led him here was telling the truth.

“Is Young Master dissatisfied with them? If so, your servant can replace them, I will certainly be able to find one to your liking.”

“No need,” Yang Kai shook his head.

“Then...”

Yang Kai thought about it for a moment then grinned, “Good, since Shen Tu is willing to show such kind intentions, to refuse would be impolite.”

Saying so, he calmly removed his robes and leapt into the bath.

The women standing next to the bath all smiled happily and slipped into the water after him, gracefully swimming over to Yang Kai and taking the initiative to press their tender bodies onto his, fully revealing their beautiful figures as they attentively served and bathed him.
