The Feudal Lord’s eyes brightened when he saw what was going on from the large ship. He said in a pleasantly surprised tone, “Sir, that guy can’t hold on any longer. He’s starting to give up parts of his Small Universe.”

After years of conflict, both Races were fully aware of each other’s patterns of behaviour.

On the battlefield, it wasn’t rare to see an Open Heaven Realm Master giving up a part of his Small Universe after he was invaded by Black Ink Strength; therefore, after every major battle, there would be a lot of asteroids floating around the battlefield. Those were the territories that the Humans had cut off from their Small Universes.

When a Human did this, it suggested that they were already on their last legs. In fact, this action wasn’t really useful. Even though he could spare himself the fate of being invaded by Black Ink Strength, his foundation would be damaged, thus causing his strength to plunge. This way, he would only get killed much quicker on the chaotic battlefield. Or, it would be easier for the Black Ink Clan to corrupt him again.

Yang Kai had showcased an incredible power as countless Black Ink Clansmen were killed by him, so it was apparent that he was no ordinary Seventh-Order Master.

It wasn’t until he gave up a part of his Small Universe that the Black Ink Clansmen were relieved. This Human wasn’t invincible; he could be defeated or even killed.

Back then, when Yang Kai decided to give up his World Spring in Blue Sky Pass, he cut off a small part of his Small Universe to do so. He still clearly remembered the excruciating pain he had gone through as though the incident had happened just yesterday.

At this moment, he wouldn’t have done such a thing if he still had a choice.

However, he had to act like a normal Seventh-Order Human. Regardless of how powerful a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was, he couldn’t possibly resist the Black Ink Strength after fighting against the Black Ink Clansmen for such a long time; therefore, he had to show them that he had to take a Spirit Pill, and presently, he also had to sacrifice a small part of his Small Universe.

He was doing all this because he wanted to carry out his plan without arousing anyone’s suspicion.

Fortunately, he had a World Tree clone with him now. Even though he had sacrificed a small part of his Small Universe, the clone would help him repair the missing part over time. He wouldn’t have to worry about his foundation being permanently damaged.

As he cut off a part of his Small Universe, Yang Kai was overwhelmed by a sense of excruciating pain once again. This caused him to tremble and growl like a beast.

In an instant, countless attacks were directed at him. Upon impact, he almost lost his balance as blood spurted from his wounds.

The missing part of his Small Universe caused his strength to plunge. Earlier, he had showcased a power that was much greater than that of the average Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, but now, he was just like any other cultivator in the same Order.

Given his cultivation, could he save himself in such a hostile environment?

The Black Ink Clansmen around him had undoubtedly noticed this. Emboldened, they started launching violent attacks on him.

At that instant, things could not have been worse for Yang Kai.

One hour later, his face was covered with Black Ink Strength once again, making it seem like his Small Universe was eroded by Black Ink Strength for the second time.

Hei Yuan was watching silently from the ship. At this moment, he couldn’t help but praise, “He’s indeed a resolute person.”

However, this spear-holding young man had done that twice in a short time.

It must have taken him a lot of courage and grit to do so. This Human was not only ruthless to the Black Ink Clan, but also to himself.

“Sir, why don’t I go capture him?” The Feudal Lord, who had not dared to join the battle earlier, suddenly made such a request.

This couldn’t be helped, as Yang Kai’s aura plunged after he gave up a part of his Small Universe twice. He was almost unable to remain in the Seventh Order. If he did that one more time, he would probably regress to the Sixth Order.

The Feudal Lord wouldn’t dare to make a move when he saw how intimidating Yang Kai was just now, but now that Yang Kai was at the end of his rope, the Feudal Lord was certainly not afraid of him.

If he could capture this Human, he would make a big contribution in front of the Territory Lord.

Nevertheless, Hei Yuan snorted, “Who do you think you are to do that?”

The horrified Feudal Lord instantly fell silent. Even though he had no idea what the Territory Lord’s intention was, he reckoned that the latter was interested in this Human. The Territory Lord would most likely turn this Human into a Black Ink Disciple; otherwise, he wouldn’t have stopped and waited here for so long.

On the battlefield, Yang Kai was battered and his hair hung loose over his shoulders.

This wasn’t an act; he really was running out of energy. Despite having the World Tree’s clone, he suffered tremendous damage after giving up a part of his Small Universe twice. The prolonged fight also exacerbated his wounds. Presently, the World Force in his Small Universe was almost completely depleted.

However, the Black Ink Clansman he had been waiting for still hadn’t shown up.

Even though he had no idea who the Territory Lord on the large ship was, he knew that the latter was paying close attention to the battlefield. Nevertheless, the Territory Lord still didn’t seem to have the intention of making a move.

The fact that he was so cautious suggested that he was badly injured. He wouldn’t rashly make a move unless he was confident that he could achieve his goal with one strike.

In that case, Yang Kai had no choice but to lend him a hand.

Upon making up his mind, Yang Kai fiercely swept his spear across the Black Ink Clansmen around him to drive them back. While he was holding his spear, his aura started rising rapidly.

He was imposing as he glared at the enemies around him.

Not knowing what was going on, these Black Ink Clansmen wouldn’t dare to move forward.

Disdain was written all over Yang Kai’s face as he sneered, “How dare you trash violate my Human Race’s dignity!”

Then, he shouted, “Long live the Humans!”

Even though his aura had already reached its former peak, it continued to rise. With a resolute expression, he seemed determined to die.

When the Feudal Lord, who was standing beside Hei Yuan on the large ship, saw that, his expression changed as he shouted, “Sir, he’s going to kill himself!”

On the battlefield, it was common for Human cultivators to kill themselves in order to avoid being turned into Black Ink Disciples. There were always such people in every major battle; therefore, the moment the Feudal Lord saw what Yang Kai was doing, he realised his intentions.

The spear-holding young man was trapped in a dead end. He had given up a part of his Small Universe twice, so he was at risk of falling back into the Sixth Order. Moreover, surrounded by a sea of Black Ink Clansmen, he would never be able to flee. Other than killing himself, there was nothing he could do.

As soon as the Feudal Lord finished speaking, he turned to look at Hei Yuan, but the latter was already nowhere in sight.

He had no idea when the Territory Lord disappeared.

The Feudal Lord quickly looked back at the battlefield, where he saw the Territory Lord’s figure.

Hei Yuan had abruptly appeared in front of the young man as he hovered his hand above the latter’s head.

At this moment, Yang Kai’s aura had already reached an unstable state, and the illusory phantom of his Small Universe faintly appeared behind him. The moment he detected the Territory Lord’s aura, a glint flashed through his eyes as he thrust out his Azure Dragon Spear.

Hei Yuan effortlessly slapped the spear aside and the hand he extended first firmly came into contact with Yang Kai’s head.

Upon impact, Yang Kai was overwhelmed with a sense of dizziness.

Hei Yuan was indeed badly injured, but Yang Kai was not in any better shape.

The aura he had just accumulated dissipated following the blow to his head.

The next instant, a torrent of Black Ink Strength streamed out of Hei Yuan’s hand as it turned into a Black Ink Cloud that engulfed the two of them.

The Black Ink Clansmen were unable to see what was going on, but they could hear the Human growling furiously, “In your dreams!”

Following a brief exchange of moves, the place fell into silence.

When the Black Ink Cloud dissipated a moment later, the figures of Yang Kai and Hei Yuan were revealed.

Hei Yuan’s aura was slightly unstable while Yang Kai was soaked in blood, looking all battered, his spear still pointing forward.

Soon though, he put the spear away and cupped his fist before calling out in a respectful manner, “Master!”

Upon hearing that, the Black Ink Clansmen around them were evidently relieved. There was no doubt that the Territory Lord had successfully turned this Human into a Black Ink Disciple. From now on, he wasn’t just a Human but also the Territory Lord’s servant.

Hei Yuan nodded gently and examined Yang Kai. He was apparently pleased to be able to subdue him.

“Come with me,” Hei Yuan said, then flew towards the large ship. Yang Kai coughed before following him.

Upon boarding the large ship, he saw a Feudal Lord coming over, “Congratulations on subduing this Human, Sir. I’m sure he’ll be a capable aide to you in the future.”

Hei Yuan ordered impassively, “I’ll get some rest. Take care of him and make sure that no one oppresses him.”

Upon hearing that, the Feudal Lord was surprised, thinking that the Territory Lord truly treasured this Human; otherwise, he wouldn’t have given such an order. After all, Black Ink Disciples were the lowest of beings among the Black Ink Clan.

However, Hei Yuan had a good reason for valuing him, for this Human had showcased incredible power. This person was no ordinary Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

After Hei Yuan finished speaking, he strode into the cabin. Meanwhile, the Feudal Lord looked smilingly at Yang Kai.

With a dispassionate expression, Yang Kai looked around.

There were quite a number of Feudal Lords on the ship; however, they were all looking at him with hostile expressions. Just now, they had seen Yang Kai slaughtering their clansmen. Although they didn’t intend to avenge their deaths, they were instinctively resentful of Humans as the blood feud between the two Races had been ongoing for countless years. Despite the fact that Yang Kai had turned into a Black Ink Disciple, they were still displeased.

Nevertheless, having just heard Hei Yuan’s orders, none of these Feudal Lords would dare to make things difficult for him.

Other than these Feudal Lords, there were also a lot of injured High-Rank Black Ink Clansmen who were recuperating on the deck.

Yang Kai even detected the auras of other Territory Lords from the inner part of the ship, which made him feel flabbergasted.

Fortunately, even though there had been some hitches, he had eventually achieved his goal. He had sacrificed a lot by giving up a part of his Small Universe twice, but he had successfully become the Black Ink Disciple of a Territory Lord.

However, there was something he had to ascertain first.

Was the Territory Lord who had stopped him from committing suicide and corrupted him with Black Ink Strength the Hei Yuan that those from Yin-Yang Pass had chosen for him?
