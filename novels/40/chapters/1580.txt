Chapter 1580, Xue Lian

Inside their residence, Xia Ning Chang was focusing on Alchemy while Yang Kai was thinking about how to obtain the Origin King Grade herbs from Chi Yue’s storehouse.

Obviously, there was only one option.

To use the Stone Puppet!

The Stone Puppet could move silently through the earth, and because of its unique physiology, it was extremely difficult for people to detect any trace of it. When Yang Kai was a guest at Shadowed Star’s Coloured Glass Sect, he had used the Stone Puppet to steal a large amount of Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass, which was subsequently used as a primary material for refining the Origin King Grade Starship.

However, this situation was somewhat different from the one back then.

Although Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Mountain was tightly protected by Coloured Glass Sect, Yang Kai still had an opportunity to pilfer it as the masters of Coloured Glass Sect never imagined such a strange creature existed, which could extract Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass right under their noses.

But the level of defence around Chi Yue’s storehouse would obviously vastly exceed anything protecting Coloured Glass Mountain. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Although the Stone Puppet had many useful abilities, its intelligence wasn’t very high, and if Yang Kai sent it out rashly, it would very likely alert others to its presence.

He had to do this himself!

Concluding so, Yang Kai didn’t hesitate anymore, stretched out his hand, and summoned out the Golden Stone Puppet. This Stone Puppet was Xiao Xiao’s only kin, but when it was born, its Soul failed to form properly for some reason, making the originally low sentience creature completely brain dead.

However, as a result, it became the perfect vessel for Yang Kai to use as an Avatar.

It had absorbed a lot of pure Golden Blood from Yang Kai, so its colour had turned pale gold.

Looking at the Golden Stone Puppet in front of him, Yang Kai gently nodded before extracting his Soul Clone from his Knowledge Sea and sending it into it.

In the next moment, the sluggish eyes of the Golden Stone Puppet regained some of their light, becoming animated and intelligent.

Yang Kai closed his eyes and his expression changed slightly.

No matter how many times he experienced this, it still felt extremely mysterious. By inserting his Soul Clone into the Golden Stone Puppet, he transformed it into a physical Avatar, making Yang Kai feel as if he had been split in two.

Not only could he feel all the emotions and sensations of his own body, but he could also see and hear everything the Golden Stone Puppet did at the same time.

It was a strange and inexplicable feeling.

Yang Kai didn’t rush to act, but instead tried to control the movements of the Golden Stone Puppet with his Soul Clone. Only after familiarizing himself with this peculiar body did he suddenly burrow into the ground.

The seemingly solid earth was no more a barrier to the Golden Stone Puppet than air was, like a fish in water. Additionally, its peculiar body was able to perfectly camouflage itself inside the ground.

No one inside the palace noticed its presence.

Regarding the location of the storehouse, Yang Kai had also asked Shan Qing Luo, so there was no need for him to search randomly.

Estimating the distance and location, it only took a moment for the Golden Stone Puppet to arrive beneath the storehouse.

Yang Kai quietly released his Divine Sense then and spied upward.

Unsurprisingly, even deep below the storehouse, there seemed to be a barrier protecting it. When Yang Kai’s Avatar’s Divine Sense swept the area, it quickly encountered an invisible resistance that impeded it from advancing any further.

This invisible resistance didn’t seem to be very strong, so with a furrow of his brow, Yang Kai slightly increased the output of his Divine Sense, condensing his Spiritual Energy and shelling the space in front of him.

This was just a simple test and Yang Kai was doing his best to control both the power he used and the area he targeted, not daring to act too forcefully. He thought such a small test wouldn’t attract anyone’s attention.

However, when his pulse of Divine Sense came into contact with the invisible barrier, a terrifying aura suddenly spread out from somewhere in the palace.

The strength of this aura caused everyone in the palace to tremble.

From the void, a pair of invisible eyes seemed to open and look down at the entire palace, observing everyone’s movements. No one dared to act rashly under the gaze of these eyes.

The powerful aura swept forth, but soon after it scanned the entire palace, it receded and disappeared.

Many people fell to the ground as sweat dripped from their foreheads. Even the Origin Returning Realm masters inside the palace felt their bodies go weak and limp at this moment.

“What was Lady Tribal Lord looking for?”

“I don’t know, could it be someone did something to anger her inside the palace?”

Confusion and discussion abounded.

Everyone knew that the powerful aura belonged to Red Moon Tribal Lord as only she could silence the entire palace with a single thought.

Yang Kai was also taken aback. He never expected Chi Yue’s reaction to be so fast. If it weren’t for the unique physique of the Stone Puppet, which allowed it to perfectly blend in with the surrounding land, his Avatar would definitely have been exposed.

After such an experience, Yang Kai didn’t dare have any ideas about the storehouse and quickly and quietly withdrew his Avatar.

Inside Chi Yue’s chambers, her brow furrowed lightly as a look of suspicion covered her face, “Strange, the barrier of the storehouse was obviously just touched, so why couldn’t I find anything?”

She also didn’t understand.

No one could act presumptuous in her domain, and no one could avoid her sight, so she simply concluded that the barrier around the storehouse had fallen into disrepair after such a long time and some kind of fault had caused the reaction just now.

Thinking so, she no longer tried to investigate, instead flashing an interested smile as she muttered to herself softly, “Yu Xiong seems to have used his head this time, using a borrowed knife to do the deed. This Queen must have a look at what kind of skill this human boy has!”

Saying so, she quietly released her Divine Sense towards the palace where Xia Ning Chang was staying to observe the movements there.

Inside the palace, Yang Kai had just taken the Golden Stone Puppet back into his Black Book Space when suddenly he turned to stare towards a certain spot with a frown.

At this moment, he actually felt like someone was spying on him, but even after inspecting with Divine Sense carefully, he found nothing.

Could it be that he was exposed somehow in the incident just now and Chi Yue was now monitoring him?

Yang Kai’s face instantly turned black.

“Oh... this little boy actually sensed something?” Chi Yue said in surprise.

With her powerful Second-Order Origin King cultivation, it should have been a simple task for her to observe a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm boy without his knowledge, but Yang Kai’s glance towards the void just now clearly indicated he had noticed her prying eyes.

However, that was his limit as it was certainly impossible for him to really perceive her Divine Sense.

He should only be suspicious right now! Chi Yue could infer this from Yang Kai’s reactions.

[Things have become interesting!] Chi Yue suddenly thought to herself.

Yang Kai frowned as he sat in place, secretly feeling the situation become complicated.

After a moment though, his expression calmed down and he pretended that nothing had happened, closed his eyes, and began adjusting his breathing.

Soon after, Yang Kai heard voices coming from outside.

“I’m sorry, two Young Lords, but you cannot go in. This is the private residence of Grandmaster Xia. Lady Tribal Lord has ordered that no one may disturb Grandmaster Xia while she is performing Alchemy!”

Yang Kai’s expression changed as he heard this voice. He instantly recognized that the speaker was the same green clothed maid that came to deliver herbs to Xia Ning Chang; however, at this moment, she seemed to be trying to prevent someone from approaching the palace.

“This Young Lord knows this is the palace of Alchemy Grandmaster Xia, that’s why he has come. If not for this, do you think this Young Lord would come to this remote place? Stand aside, this Young Lord has something to discuss with that Grandmaster Xia!” A rough voice sounded loudly.

“Two Young Lords, please reconsider! Lady Tribal Lord has already issued strict orders, please do not embarrass this servant!” The green clothed maid begged while again mentioning Chi Yue’s name, using both soft and hard methods.

“Scram!” The previous speaker shouted angrily, “Don’t try to use Senior Chi Yue’s name to suppress this Young Lord! If Senior Chi Yue has a problem, this Young Lord will explain himself to her, not you! How dare a mere servant try to block this Young Lord’s way!”

“Little lady, you should give way. This Young Lord came here with Brother Xue Lian this time to request Grandmaster Xia refine a pill, not to intrude upon her privacy; however, Brother Xue Lian’s temper is a bit bad, so if we’ve offended you, this Young Lord will apologize on his behalf,” Another voice sounded.

Yang Kai suddenly sneered.

The owner of this voice was someone he was familiar with, Young Master Wicked Eyes Mi Tian!

Since entering the palace, Yang Kai had not seen him again, but a person with such high pride would definitely not let the matter in Shimmering Moon City drop. Shan Qing Luo had also reminded him to be wary of Mi Tian’s revenge.

His intentions for showing up at this time were clearly not good.

But who was the other person? Hearing Mi Tian calling him Brother Xue Lian, it seemed the other party’s status was not low.

Yang Kai instantly became curious.

“Request Alchemy from Grandmaster Xia?” The green clothed maid froze for a moment before quickly shaking her head, “That would be inappropriate, Grandmaster Xia is a talent Lady Tribal Lord highly favours. Without the permission of Lady Tribal Lord, she cannot perform Alchemy for others.”

“Not appropriate?” The Monster Race master named Xue Lian sneered, “Inappropriate, how? She’s just a trivial human woman; This Young Lord asking her to perform Alchemy is her honour, how could she refuse? If she dares say no, this Young Lord will immediately kill her!”

The green clothed maid turned pale in fright. Although she was afraid of the ferocity of the Monster Race master named Xue Lian, she still stood firmly in front of him and prevented him from entering the palace.

“I’ll give you three breaths time, if you don’t give way by then, be prepared to die! Even if this Young Lord kills a trivial maidservant, Senior Chi Yue won’t care, think carefully before you decide,” Xue Lian glared coldly at the green-clothed maid, a fierce and violent light flashing across his eyes.

“Little lady, you’d best step aside, your delicate skin and tender flesh will certainly not look good if it’s ripped apart,” Mi Tian still maintained a gentle smile as he persuaded the green-clothed maid, his eyes flashing a wicked and enchanting light.

When she made contact with these eyes, the green-clothed maid’s vision blurred and the look of struggle on her face gradually smoothed, a faint blush appearing on her cheeks as she gently and shyly nodded before backing downs.

With a cold snort, Xue Lian stretched out his hand and shoved the maid further away before taking a big step forward towards the palace.

Mi Tian smiled and followed behind him.

When the two were less than ten metres from the palace, however, the front door suddenly opened and Yang Kai walked out, closing the door behind him before sweeping his eyes across Xue Lian and Mi Tian indifferently.

Xue Lian and Mi Tian both stopped at the same time, the former staring at Yang Kai disdainfully.

The latter’s eyes narrowed, however, as a look of hatred and dread flashed across their depths.

He would never forget Yang Kai’s terrifying performance back in Shimmering Moon City; this was an opponent he had no choice but to take seriously.
