As early as halfway back to the Lu Mansion, Yang Kai had already caught up to Lu Bai Chuan.

But, he did not immediately show up to attack him and instead quietly trailed behind.

With Yang Kai’s powerful Divine Sense, and his Nihility Secret Technique, if he wanted to hide, even most Dao Source Realm masters would be unable to detect him, much less Lu Bai Chuan who was running away in a panic.

As for the reason he didn’t kill Lu Bai Chuan immediately, it was because Yang Kai was a bit curious about him.

The Dao of Space was not so easy to comprehend, and even if Lu Bai Chuan could only condense a small Space Needle, that was enough to show he had some competency in the Dao of Space.

As such, Yang Kai wanted to investigate him a bit.

After noticing that Lu Bai Chuan had entered this secret room, Yang Kai hurriedly followed him inside, maintaining Nihility to observe him from up close.

But something he didn’t expect suddenly happened. The moment he entered this secret room, Nihility was actually forcefully dispersed by some strange force, revealing him!

Yang Kai clearly felt that this force emanated from the pitch-black round jade suspended up ahead.

“You... how did you come in?” Lu Bai Chuan shouted in a high-pitched voice as he stared at Yang Kai like he was a ghost.

Yang Kai withdrew his gaze from the round black jade, glanced at Lu Bai Chuan, and grinned, “Naturally, I followed you inside.”

“Damn! Do you really insist on killing ruthlessly? Little Brother, this old master has never met you before today and has no grievances or grudges with you, so why take things to such extremes? Instead of fighting with this old master and ending with mutual wounds, why not let matters end here? If you agree, this old master can allow you to leave here unharmed,” Lu Bai Chuan saw that Yang Kai hadn’t immediately attacked him and forced himself to calm down.

“If I want to leave, do I need your consent?” Yang Kai sneered, “Moreover, although I have no grudge with you, since I have agreed to the Zhang Family’s request, I can’t let you live anymore.”

“Boy, don’t go too far! Do you really think that this old master is afraid of you? If so, I advise you to think twice!” Lu Bai Chuan saw Yang Kai’s stand-offish attitude and immediately understood that it was useless to say anything more. There was nothing more to do now but fight.

As he spoke, Lu Bai Chuan pushed his strength madly and rushed towards Yang Kai, murderous intent filling his bloodshot eyes as he summoned his Thunder Wind Hammer again and sent out bolts of lightning to fill the secret room.

Yang Kai smiled lightly at this sight and just shouted, “Come out!”

As he spoke, he waved his hand casually.

The pure white Monster Insect Queen, wielding its blue and purple dual swords, made a grand entrance.

As soon as Monster Insect Queen Yu appeared, she received Yang Kai’s order and waved her swords towards Lu Bai Chuan.

Yang Kai didn’t want to expose the existence of the Monster Insect Queen, but inside this secret room, there was just him and Lu Bai Chuan, so there was no issue. The Monster Insect Queen could now rival a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, so dealing with Lu Bai Chuan was naturally a breeze.

Feeling the aura emanating from Monster Insect Queen, Lu Bai Chuan was startled and cried out in shock, “An Eleventh-Order Monster Beast!?”

Instantly, his face turned pale and all his fighting spirit disappeared.

He was currently just a Third-Order Origin King, so after encountering an ordinary Eleventh-Order Monster Beast, he would have no choice but to flee. What’s more, at first glance, it was obvious the Monster Insect Queen in front of him was no ordinary Eleventh-Order Monster Beast, it was wielding dual sword artifacts after all...

“Little Brother, this Lu acknowledges his punishment is deserved and asks Little Brother to show mercy by not killing him!” Lu Bai Chuan immediately begged for mercy without any shame.

Yang Kai flatly ignored him.

Naturally, the Monster Insect Queen would not pay attention to Lu Bai Chuan’s begging and the icy aura it released surged as it swung the dual swords down.

Suddenly, the inside of the secret room became chaotic as Lu Bai Chuan called out repeatedly. Even going all out, he couldn’t protect himself from the Monster Insect Queen and it was not long before he was bleeding from cuts all over his body.

In the meantime, Yang Kai had arrived in front of the pitch-black round jade and was frowning as he observed it.

This thing was extremely weird. Yang Kai’s Divine Sense was able to penetrate it, but when it did it was as if it was sinking into a bottomless ocean.

On top of that... it was able to disperse his Nihility Secret Technique somehow or another.

After studying it for a while, Yang Kai stretched out his hand and grabbed the pitch-black round jade. But unexpectedly, nothing happened. Even after pouring his strength into it, the jade did not respond at all.

“Strange!” Yang Kai shook his head.

“Little Brother, mercy! If you want to know the purpose of that thing, this Lu can tell you, all he asks is you spare his life!” Lu Bai Chuan had been forced into a corner by the Monster Insect Queen at this moment and had no way out.

What made him feel resentful at this moment was how sturdy this secret room was. Long ago, his Lu Family ancestors had spent a great sum of money to create a secret room that even a Dao Source Realm master would find difficult to break out of in short order, so there was naturally no way Lu Bai Chuan could simply smash a wall and escape.

“Do you know the details of this thing?” Yang Kai turned to look at him.

Lu Bai Chuan said anxiously, “I know!”

Yang Kai nodded, and in the next moment, with a single command from his Divine Sense, the Monster Insect Queen froze in place, its dual swords less than a finger-length away from Lu Bai Chuan’s forehead. Some residual Sword Qi from the swords even shaved off a few of Lu Bai Chuan’s hairs.

The hair fell through the air and passed by Lu Bai Chuan’s eyes, making him leak cold sweat all over.

“Talk. What is this thing? Why can it break my Secret Technique?” Yang Kai asked after fiddling a bit with the pitch-black jade in his hand.

Lu Bai Chuan gulped hard before he weakly glanced over at the Monster Insect Queen standing in front of him, not understanding how a trivial Origin King like Yang Kai could command such a powerful Monster Beast.

“Don’t get any ideas, or I’ll kill you immediately,” Yang Kai couldn’t help coldly snorting when he saw Lu Bai Chuan’s expression flickering.

Lu Bai Chuan quickly understood something and hesitantly asked, “This old master admits the punishment is deserved, so he would not dare try anything, but... If this old master can provide Little Brother with the information he wants, can Little Brother spare his life?”

“Are you trying to negotiate terms with me?” Yang Kai grinned.

“I would not dare!” Lu Bai Chuan waved his hand quickly, “It’s just... This old master really doesn’t want to die.”

“No one wants to die,” Yang Kai nodded, “Good, I can give you a way out.”

Lu Bai Chuan was overjoyed and was about to speak when Yang Kai continued, “Of course, the premise is that the information you provide can satisfy me!”

Lu Bai Chuan’s face suddenly became bitter as he said, “This old master will not conceal anything.”

“Very good,” Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction, stretching out his hand and pulling over a stone bench from somewhere inside the secret room before sitting down casually. Still playing with the black jade in his hand, he asked once more, “What is this thing?”

Lu Bai Chuan quickly replied, “A Space Spirit Jade!”

“Space Spirit Jade?” Yang Kai raised his brow, as if thinking of something before asking, “What is its relationship with Space Spirit Crystal?”

Lu Bai Chuan hurriedly replied, “Space Spirit Jade is produced at the cores of pure, condensed Space Spirit Crystals. Less than one in ten thousand Space Spirit Crystals will produce a Space Spirit Jade.”

“So it’s the core of a Space Spirit Crystal?” Yang Kai’s expression changed.

“Indeed, but... this doesn’t seem to be a pure Space Spirit Jade. It seems to have been blended with other materials by some powerful master and refined into a type of artifact,” Lu Bai Chuan explained further.

“Oh? You know quite a bit,” Yang Kai said with some surprise.

“Little Brother flatters me, this old master has been studying it for many years and read many ancient books to come up with these speculations,” Lu Bai Chuan smiled, his expression fluctuating quite a bit as he hesitantly asked. “Dare I ask if Little Brother cultivates Space Force?”

“Don’t you?” Yang Kai looked at him faintly. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Lu Bai Chuan smiled bitterly, “How can this old master’s comprehension of the Dao of Space compare to Little Brother’s? After Little Brother caught this old master’s Space Needle with one hand, this old master had some faint guesses, but now it seems to be true. If Little Brother did not cultivate Space Force, how could he have accomplished such a feat?”

“Just some paltry tricks,” Yang Kai snorted.

“Yes yes, this old master’s accomplishments are like dim fireflies compared to Little Brother’s brilliant moon.”

“Cease your flattery and get to the point. How did you manage to cultivate Space Force? Does it have something to do with this Space Spirit Jade?” Yang Kai continued to inquire.

“Little Brother’s insight is indeed sharp,” Lu Bai Chuan nodded, “The reason why I know something about Space Force is because of this Space Spirit Jade.”

Hearing what he said, Yang Kai’s doubts disappeared.

When his Nihility Secret Technique was cracked by the Space Spirit Jade, he had a guess that Lu Bai Chuan’s comprehension of the Dao of Space was related to it.

“As this old master said before, this Space Spirit Jade seems to have been refined into a peculiar artifact by some powerful master, but this old master is unable to draw out any of its power and only inadvertently gained some inspiration from it which allowed him to begin cultivating Space Force...” Lu Bai Chuan explained while carefully observing the changes in Yang Kai’s expression.

However, Yang Kai’s face remained as tranquil as an ancient well, with no joy, sorrow, or interest showing at all, causing Lu Bai Chuan to become more and more nervous.

“How difficult the Dao of Space is to cultivate, I understand well. If one does not have the appropriate aptitude for it, even spending a thousand years would not be enough to learn anything. I’m a little curious, what kind of opportunity did you have that allowed you to accidentally comprehend Space Force from this thing?” Squinting at Lu Bai Chuan, Yang Kai asked lightly, “If you dare to speak any lies, I’ll make you beg for death.”

Lu Bai Chuan shivered in fright as he quickly said, “Little Brother, I would not dare tell any lies. Since Little Brother wants to know, this old master will naturally explain clearly. There truly was a special opportunity that allowed this old master to spy on the mysteries of the Dao of Space. It is a long story though. Actually, this thing was not originally my Lu Family’s, but the Zhang Family’s.”

“Then how did your Lu Family come to possess it? Did you steal it?” Yang Kai looked at him and sneered.

Lu Bai Chuan waved his hand, “Little Brother misunderstands. This thing was part of the dowry the Lu Family received when a woman from the Zhang Family married into the Lu Family two hundred years ago. You should know that my Lu Family and the Zhang Family have several hundred years of friendship, so marriages between us are...”

“What does that have to do with the opportunity you obtained?” Yang Kai cut in, still quite confused.

“Please be patient, Little Brother, this old master will explain everything,” Lu Bai Chuan squeezed out a smile, but seeing Yang Kai’s cold glare, he didn’t dare to dally and quickly continued.
