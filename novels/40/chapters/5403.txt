The Great Battle Heaven Old Ancestor looked up at void, narrowed his eyes and asked, “What kind of deal?”

Mo replied, “If you help me kill this old man, this Supreme One will promise you that after I get out of this cage, I will rule alongside your Human Race! Black Ink Battlefield… is what you call this stretch of void. The Black Ink Clan and I will never set foot outside of Black Ink Battlefield or bring harm to your lands.”

Unlike Cang, Mo knew a lot about the Humans of today. The bizarre nature of the Black Ink Nest allowed Mo to monitor every Theatre at all times.

The Great Battle Heaven Old Ancestor snickered, “How could we possibly sleep in peace?”

There was no guarantee that Mo would keep this agreement. Even if it did, how could the Human Race be at ease? Who knew if Mo changed its mind?

After all, it was the source of the Black Ink Clan!

The Human Race and the Black Ink Clan had fought with each other for countless years. The countless dead soldiers had forged an eternal blood feud. This was not a matter that could be so easily resolved.

All the Old Ancestors wanted to hear was Mo’s proposal, but they had no plans to take it seriously.

Even Cang knew that the Human Race would not accept this proposal which was why he chose to remain quiet and not interfere.

Mo sighed and said, “You Humans keep saying that you want to kill this Supreme One for your own survival, but you have not achieved this even after so many years. You have lost a lot of people, just as I have lost a lot of my servants. No one has the upper hand. Didn’t that old man say that this Supreme One was born when the Heavens and Earth began? If the Heavens and Earth were destroyed, how can this Supreme One live on? I would be alone. When I first became sentient, I didn’t know anything and could not control my own power, that is why I caused such a great disaster. Now that I know the seriousness of what happened, I will not let it happen again. I promise. If this Supreme One says that the Black Ink Clan will never step out of the Black Ink Battlefield, this Supreme One will definitely not go back on my word. This Supreme One swears by its Soul that if I lie, may the Heavens smite my Soul and end my life.”

Cang was slightly moved and remarked, “Looks like you are determined!”

An Old Ancestor looked at Cang and asked, “Senior means that this guy can be trusted?”

Cang nodded and said, “The most important thing to Mo’s existence is its own Soul, or in other words, its sentience. Since it swore by its Soul, it should be true. If it violates its oath, even if its Soul does not get destroyed, it would suffer a fate worse than death.”

Cang did not try to exaggerate or lie and just spoke straightforwardly.

Hearing what Mo said, there was no doubt that it was extremely eager to get out of this trap. For this reason, it was even willing not to step out of the Black Ink Battlefield.

“Not only do Humans desire a prosperous future, so does this Supreme One. I naturally desired to go somewhere most bustling and alive. The disaster that happened eons ago was unintentional, and for it I have been trapped here for so many years. Isn’t that punishment enough?”

Cang sighed slightly and said, “It is not a question of if it is enough. Mo, you should know that yourself.”

Mo replied indignantly, “Then, you want to ruthlessly kill me simply because I was born with this power?”

Was Mo wrong?

But, was it right?

Its presence resulted in the decimation of hundreds of Great Territories and the death of all living things in those lands. Countless Human Race Masters became corrupted by Black Ink Strength, their original personality annihilated as they were reduced mere slaves.

This was no longer a question of right or wrong.

In the silence, the Great Battle Heaven Old Ancestor coldly snorted and said, “You were ignorant back then, but don’t you understand now? For countless years, the Black Ink Clan on the Black Ink Battlefield have been trying to invade the 3,000 Worlds. Your words sound sincere at first, but they are dishonest!”

Mo said leisurely, “If you had been trapped here for millions of years, wouldn’t you try to find a way to get out? There is only one way for this Supreme One to get out of here, but that was the past. Now, as long as you are willing to help me, this Supreme One naturally does not need to do that again. This Supreme One can even promise you that after I get out of this trap, this Supreme One can retract all my Black Ink Strength. Then, there would not be any Black Ink Clansman in this world except for this Supreme One!”

“That certainly sounds tempting!” An Old Ancestor chuckled.

If Mo was true to its word, it would remain in the Black Ink Battlefield and take back all its Black Ink Strength. This was undoubtedly a good outcome. However, could it keep its word?

Even if it could keep its promise for a short time, what about in the long run?

If it could never step out of the Black Ink Battlefield, it meant that it was still imprisoned!

The only thing that changed was that it had gone from a small cage built around the Primordial Heavens Source, to the big cage of the Black Ink Battlefield.

Did it not just say that it sought for prosperity? Perhaps it could endure loneliness for 1,000 years, or even 10,000 years, but what would happen after 100,000 years, or a million years?

How could an entity that had been imprisoned for millions of years, once freed, agree to be imprisoned again? They certainly could not believe everything it said.

Thus, none of the Old Ancestors took its words seriously. Mo’s sincere-sounding oath could only be taken superficially and anyone who believed in it was a fool.

Mo had sensed the Old Ancestors’ thoughts towards its proposal and it began to fume as, regardless of how long it had lived, its thoughts were still like those of a child. It now felt upset and aggrieved that even its willingness to compromise could not satisfy the greedy Human Race.

“Do you really want to be the enemy of this Supreme One?” Mo raged.

“Years of blood feud can only end in death!” The Great Battle Heaven Old Ancestor’s aura turned sharp as it pointed to the void.

Mo gloomily said, “Consider carefully. You may not be able to win if you really want to fight! This old man has also said that this Supreme One created countless servants over these millions of years. You may have a 2 million strong Army, but that is still not enough to be this Supreme One’s opponent. How can you win? What will be the final outcome? Since you cannot kill this Supreme One, are you going to continue to imprison me?”

An Old Ancestor said with a smile, “Originally, I did not have much confidence in this battle when I heard what Martial Ancestor said. However, now that I have listened to you, I think we can win. Perhaps we can even kill you!”

“You must be tired of living!” Mo shouted angrily.

The Old Ancestors did not bother to say anything else. They were all Masters with firm Wills who had led their Armies to this place; thus, they would not be swayed by what Mo said.

No matter how tempting Mo’s promises were, its very existence was a huge threat to the 3,000 Worlds. The only way to solve this problem was to completely annihilate it.

Although there was no way to find the Primordial Light for the time being, they could not just leave Mo alone.

Looking around at the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, Cang asked, “Have you all thought it through?”

The Old Ancestors all nodded.

The Myriad Demons Old Ancestor smiled and said, “Senior, tell us what we should do. Honestly, we had not expected things to turn out this way, so we hardly know how we should proceed.”

Cang nodded and said, “Since you and the others are determined to fight, then the matter is very simple.”

He did not try to hide what he was going to say from Mo; in fact, he could not hide it even if he wanted to. Although Mo was not particularly strong in terms of raw combat power, its Divine Sense was exceptionally keen. Thus, Mo could sense whatever he was about to say no matter how he tried to conceal it.

“When you are prepared, this Old Master will open the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. Once the restriction is open, you and the army must kill the Black Ink Clansmen as soon as they emerge,” Cang explained.

An Old Ancestor asked with worry, “Once the restriction is open? Won’t Mo take advantage of the opportunity to escape?”

Cang shook his head and said “This Old Master will use the power of the restriction to restrain it. It will not be able to get out.”

Cang was confident about this point; otherwise, he would not dare to open up the restriction.

“But you must be very careful, Mo has an innate ability which also can be said to be a Secret Technique. Even if Mo does not have direct contact with you, the Secret Technique might cause you and the others to be corrupted and turn into servants.”

“An Innate Divine Ability!?” An Old Ancestor bellowed.

Cang nodded and said, “So to speak. So, be sure to protect your Souls. This Old Master will try not to let it have the opportunity to strike you, but you should also protect yourselves.”

“We understand.”

The Human Race was no stranger to such abilities of the Black Ink Clan. In fact, the Royal Lords had such an Innate Divine Ability, which the Humans simply called the Royal Lord Secret Technique.

As Cang said, even without direct contact, once their Soul was hit by such a Secret Technique, it would be corrupted by Black Ink Strength.

As the source of the Black Ink Clan, how could Mo not possess such a skill? Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Over the years, this Old Master was not sure of how many servants Mo had created, so this battle will most likely be very difficult, if you and the others can’t hold on anymore, you should inform Old Master immediately and I will close the gap!”

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up and exclaimed, “Senior can both open and close the restriction? Can we keep repeating this, so that we can keep wearing down its strength.”

As long as Cang had good control of this gap, the Human Race might even be able to kill the entire Black Ink Clan Army without any damage.

Cang, however, smiled and replied, “No. Opening and ensuring that the gap does not expand and closing it requires much time and strength. Furthermore, doing it too many times would make the restriction unstable. If Mo breaks out from inside, even this Old Master might be powerless to suppress and seal it.”

Yang Kai understood. He also knew that it could not be that simple.

“In addition…” Cang appeared slightly grave as he said, “Over these years, Mo seems to have hidden some kind of power. When he first used that power, he almost broke out of the restriction. Unfortunately, I still do not know much about this power. All of you must be extremely careful.”

The Old Ancestors all listened solemnly. If Mo nearly broke out of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, and even Cang, who had been here guarding this place for millions of years did not understand how, then this power was obviously Mo’s trump card.
