Chapter 907, Blood Sea

“Yes,” Thunder Dragon nodded, “I was one of Blood Flood Dragon Great Senior’s subordinates. Blood Flood Dragon Great Senior’s death is actually related to the original owner of this artifact.”

“Was he killed by that guy named Meng Wu Ya?” Earth Splitting Divine Ox exclaimed.

Thunder Dragon Great Senior slowly shook his head, “Not exactly. When the two of them fought, Blood Flood Dragon Great Senior was defeated after only a stick of incense worth of time and suffered serious wounds, wounds he eventually succumbed to. It was only after Blood Flood Dragon Great Senior died that This King was able to rise to the position of Great Senior and become a leader of the Monster Domain.”

Earth Splitting Divine Ox’s eyes bulged, as he shouted out in disbelief, “Blood Flood Dragon Great Senior’s strength should be comparable if not greater than yours or mine, yet someone was actually able to beat him half to death in the time it would take to burn a stick of incense?”

“En, it was really just a stick of incense worth of time. When the two of them fought, this King was present! The means of that Meng Wu Ya... they were truly earth-shattering. It was only later, when this King investigated about him that I learned he was actually the Human Race’s strongest master, an opponent no one dared offend.”

As Yang Kai listened to this glorious tale, all that came to mind was Treasurer Meng’s lazy old demeanour and perverted grin, causing his face to twitch unceasingly. His back shivered at the thought...

Did Treasurer Meng really have such a brilliant past?

Although Yang Kai had long guessed that Meng Wu Ya’s strength was not low, it appeared he was still underestimating his ability.

It wasn’t until today that Yang Kai finally had a clearer understanding of Treasurer Meng’s background.

“And this Heavenly Palace was one of Meng Wu Ya’s signature artifacts...” Thunder Dragon Great Senior stared at the artifacts in Yang Kai’s hand, a complex expression appearing on his face as he sighed slightly, “Because of the death of Blood Flood Dragon Great Senior, This King had been paying attention to that guy’s movements and whereabouts, but unfortunately I heard that he later ran to the Demon Land to challenge the current Demon Commander and ultimately died as a result...”

After a pause, he furrowed his brow and said, “That guy was also quite eccentric. He didn’t belong to any Sect and seemed to have been self-taught, there were no rumours at all about where he originated from or how he obtained his phenomenal strength. On top of that, he didn’t seem to have a legacy disciple, leaving This King no one to seek revenge from. Kid, where exactly did you get this artifact?”

“Heh heh, if I said that he left it with me, would you believe it or not?” Yang Kai let out a hollow laugh.

Thunder Dragon frowned and asked, “What do you mean? Are you trying to say he’s actually still?”

“En.”

“Impossible, there hasn’t been any news about him for at least a hundred years! If he was still alive, how could he have not made a single sound after so long?” Thunder Dragon seemed unable to believe his ears, staring somewhat suspiciously towards Yang Kai, “Why is this Heavenly Palace continuously flickering now?”

“Probably because it senses its owner’s aura!” Yang Kai also stared at Heavenly Palace. After taking it out of the Black Book space, the Heavenly Palace began flashing more frequently, which only increased Yang Kai’s suspicion that Meng Wu Ya was here.

“He’s really still alive?” Thunder Dragon Great Senior exclaimed.

“Do I look like someone who would lie about this?” Yang Kai looked at him with seriousness.

“No.”

“Exactly.”

Thunder Dragon’s expression fluctuated before suddenly realizing something, his eyes lighting up as he shouted, “So, as long as we follow the guidance of this Heavenly Palace, we’ll be able to find Meng Wu Ya and subsequently leave this Bewildering Array?”

“I think so,” Yang Kai nodded heavily, pouring his True Qi into the Heavenly Palace.

Back when Meng Wu Ya wrapped Yang Kai’s mansion with the Heavenly Palace, it had saved him and his allies from being destroyed by the Devil Lord and his minions. Later on, in order to facilitate Yang Kai entering and exiting the barrier, Meng Wu Ya had set it up so that the Heavenly Palace could be driven to a certain extent by Yang Kai.

This artifact ultimately did not belong to Yang Kai so it was impossible for him to display all of its power.

However, it was enough! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

As he poured his True Qi into it, the Heavenly Palace began to tremble and Yang Kai immediately noticed some signs of it wanting to escape from his grasp and fly off.

Immediately, Yang Kai’s spirits rose as he shouted, “Follow me!”

Holding onto the Heavenly Palace and feeling the direction it wanted to fly, Yang Kai began rushing forward.

The crowd followed close behind.

As he was walking, Yang Kai’s mood fluctuated wildly.

He wasn’t sure if Meng Wu Ya was here or if he had simply left a trace of himself behind before leaving, if it turned out like that, then this time to he would be unable to find Treasurer Meng and Little Senior Sister.

However, this was without a doubt a clue in his search, so there was still hope.

Yang Kai had already found Su Yan, and he wasn’t worried about Old Demon, so as long as he could find Xia Ning Chang, he would have finally accomplished what he came to Tong Xuan Realm to do.

Since leaving the Central Capital and coming to this world, it had already been more than a decade. Over the past ten years, his strength had undergone earth-shaking changes, but this worry of his had never left heart, often causing him to sigh helplessly.

[When I finally find Meng Wu Ya, I swear I’ll pluck out every last hair from that old fart’s beard!] Yang Kai secretly grumbled to himself as he flew forward as quickly as he could.

After an unknown amount of time, the barren grey landscape actually began to change.

In front of Yang Kai, there seemed to be some kind of landmark sticking up from the ground.

After arriving here, the light from the Heavenly Palace also became much stronger.

Yang Kai couldn’t help getting his hopes up as he rushed towards this landmark but upon seeing what it was, his brow furrowed deeply.

The other five people also came to a stop, each of them staring forward with a solemn expression.

Twenty meters or so in front of their group of six stood a gigantic stone pillar at least five meters thick and was so tall that they were unable to see its top.

On the stone pillar, there were a few large Demon characters written by the same hand as the ones which they first saw upon entering this Mysterious Small World.

“Li Rong, what’s written on it?” Yang Kai hurriedly asked.

Li Rong quickly observed the characters before taking her gaze back, not daring to stare at it for too long, quickly replying, “Tong Xuan Pillar!”

“Tong Xuan Pillar?” Yang Kai frowned, not knowing what these words meant.

However, there was indeed an extraordinary force surrounding this stone pillar, one that caused everyone present to feel fearful and apprehensive.

Following the guidance of the Heavenly Palace, they had not found Meng Wu Ya but instead discovered this strange stone pillar, disappointing each of them somewhat.

But Yang Kai could still feel the Heavenly Palace pulling him in a certain direction so obviously this was not their last stop.

“Let’s keep moving, in any case, we’ve at least managed to leave the Bewildering Array,” Yang Kai said.

The other five nodded gently and continued to keep up.

The group began advancing more carefully now, each of them on high alert in case they encountered any unforeseen danger.

After half an hour, Yang Kai suddenly slowed down and sniffed the air before asking, “Have you all noticed as well?”

“En, it smells like blood!” Thunder Dragon replied immediately, his eyes glancing around vigilantly, “There’s a bloody scent coming from nearby.”

“En, it seems to be growing stronger too,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Wait, there’s movement up ahead,” Thunder Dragon declared.

Everyone came to a stop and perked up their ears.

Some subtle sounds came from afar, almost like the rolling sound of waves on the ocean.

The sound rapidly grew louder as whatever was causing it seemed to be closing in on them at great speed. A moment later, at the edge of their sight, a dark red light appeared in the originally grey world.

Gradually, the dark red light grew larger and the rhythmic sound of the tide resounded even clearer than before.

Before any of them could react, the entire world in front of them was dyed blood red.

“Not good!” Thunder Dragon Great Senior roared, instantly pushing his strength and throwing up a blue light curtain around their group.

At the same time, from right in front of them, a thick and boundless blood red sea crashed down on them, as if a dam somewhere up ahead had broken, turning this barren wasteland into a floodplain and in an instant. Completely enveloping the six of them.

A rich bloody smell filled all of their noses and all they could see now around them was a thick bloody red liquid. It was as if they had suddenly fallen into the middle of blood sea and lost all sense of direction, unable to find the way out.

The blood sea vaporized on contact with the light barrier and quickly began seeping inside. The Heavenly Palace in Yang Kai’s hand had only been slightly contaminated by this blood fog yet the glow it had been giving off had greatly diminished, as if it had almost lost all spirituality.

Without hesitation, Yang Kai threw the Heavenly Palace back into the Black Book space.

*Ci la la...*

A sizzling sound burst out from all around. It seemed like the blood fog that managed to infiltrate the light barrier was extremely corrosive, causing a painful burning sensation upon contact with everyone’s skin.

Yang Kai grit his teeth and began circulating his strength to resist the effects of this blood fog, rapidly consuming his True Qi in the process.

“What the hell is this stuff?” Earth Splitting Divine Ox cursed as he enveloped his body in a brown light. Unfortunately, under the erosion of the blood fog, even his light defence quickly became dim, forcing him to exert even more strength to compensate, draining his reserves at a rapid pace.

The blood sea and blood fog seemed to be able to even dissolve various kinds of energy.

“It should be some kind of trap we accidentally triggered, we need to find our way out of this blood sea first before figuring out what to do about it,” Thunder Dragon roared as he resisted the pressure from the surrounding blood sea, pushing his defenses to the limit.

“Great Senior, watch out!” Cai Die suddenly exclaimed, waving her seven coloured wings and shooting out a beam of light.

Looking towards the direction of her attack, Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed.

He found that amidst the vast blood sea, there were innumerable figures wandering about that seemed to be condensed entirely from blood. These blood people seemed to have no facial features or even solid figures; Cai Die’s attack passed right through a few of them and scattered them into blood fog.

In the blink of an eye though, several more of these blood people rushed threateningly towards Thunder Dragon Great Senior.

Thunder Dragon’s pupils shrank as he unleashed a bolt of purple lightning towards these figures, smashing a number of them into the bloody fog.

However, one of them managed to avoid getting hit, closed in, reached out, and grabbed the wrist of Thunder Dragon Great Senior.

As if he had molten metal poured onto his flesh, a scalding sound burst out and Thunder Dragon revealed a look of pain, quickly waving his arm to shake off the bloody hand.

On his wrist, a bright red handprint remained along with a deep bruising.

Seeing this, everyone’s face paled.

Thunder Dragon was a supreme master and a Monster Beast on top of that, his flesh was extremely strong yet after only being gripped by this blood man he had actually suffered a serious wound. It was clear from this just how terrifying the corrosive strength of the surrounding blood was.

However, what made everyone truly feel desperate was that the blood people that were smashed apart by Thunder Dragon Great Senior a moment ago actually gathered together and stood up again, completely unharmed.

It was like they were immortal and indestructible.
