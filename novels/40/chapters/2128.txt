“Little Xue Ting, why don’t we make a bet?” Wen Zi Shan turned his attention to her.

“What bet?” Gao Xue Ting looked over.

“A bet on who wins!” Wen Zi Shan smiled, pointing downwards.

“What will we be betting?” Gao Xue Ting asked coldly.

“Hm, let me think...” Wen Zi Shan thought deeply. “Ah, Little Xue Ting, didn’t you always want to see what it is like in the Life or Death Door? This King shall allow you to enter if you win.”

“Really?” Gao Xue Ting exclaimed as her eyes focused.

Standing in a corner, Chen Qian’s expression changed at those words “Life or Death Door”.

“When has this King ever lied to you?” Wen Zi Shan had a harmless smile as he spoke.

Gao Xue Ting’s eyes bored into Wen Zi Shan, trying to figure out his true intention, but he merely maintained a gentle smile. After a while, Gao Xue Ting finally removed her gaze, said “It is true that as a Sect Master, you have never behaved like one. You are always fooling around and never did any honest work...”

Wen Zi Shan’s face turned dark, the corners of his mouth twitched slightly, “This King feels so useless after hearing that!”

Gao Xue Ting changed the direction of the topic and said, “But you have never lied to anyone!”

“Does this King only have this one good virtue?” Wen Zi Shan looked dejected.

“Then, what do you want if you win?” Gao Xue Ting asked coldly.

Wen Zi Shan laughed whimsically, his bright eyes swept across Gao Xue Ting from top to bottom a few times.

She blushed, feeling extremely uncomfortable and said, “Stop any of your dirty thoughts or I’ll dig your eyes out.”

“What were you thinking?” Wen Zi Shan laughed, “Well, how about this: If I win, you will owe me a small favour that will not violate your principles and will not be a demanding request!”

“Small favour? What kind of favour?” Gao Xue Ting asked carefully.

“Well... I haven’t thought about it. I’ll let you know when I have thought of one.” Wen Zi Shan laughed.

“Sister Gao, don’t be fooled! Who knows what he’s plotting to do?” Chen Qian warned her, lest Gao Xue Ting fall into Wen Zi Shan’s trap.

“I know!” Gao Xue Ting agreed, she turned her attention downwards as she spoke “But he has to win the bet first, otherwise, there’s no meaning to anything he said.”

She turned to Wen Zi Shan and agreed, “Okay, it’s a deal.”

“That’s a promise!” Wen Zi Shan chuckled, “No regrets.”

“You should start preparing the permit for me to enter the Life or Death door!”

Chen Qian sighed, looking helpless. Although she did not believe that Yang Kai would be able to defeat Xue Yi, who was ranked fifteenth in the entire Azure Sun Temple’s Dao Source Realm hierarchy, she could not help but have a bad hunch – Sir Temple Master was always unpredictable, but he was always very reliable during critical times.

Chen Qian was doubtful that Wen Zi Shan would allow Gao Xue Ting to enter the Life or Death Door. He must be very confident that he would win.

Considering all of this, she quickly looked down.

Below them, Xue Yi was startled by Yang Kai, who was walking towards him. “You should have stayed down. Why did you get up? You are seeking your own death!”

“Friend, you sure are vicious. Thanks for the lesson!!” Yang Kai snorted.

A voice suddenly spoke into his ear, “Little brat, do well and beat your opponent to the ground. This King promises to grant you any request that is not too excessive!”

Yang Kai was stunned by the voice.

It was undeniably the voice of the Temple Master of Azure Sun Temple, Wen Zi Shan!

Yang Kai had only met this man a few days ago, therefore, he was still very familiar with his voice. Besides, not a single person in the Azure Sun Temple headquarters would dare to impersonate Wen Zi Shan.

In other words, the person who whispered in his ear was none other than Wen Zi Shan.

“What the...?” Yang Kai frowned. He released his Divine Sense, scanned the surrounding area but found no trace of Wen Zi Shan.

If it had not happened to Yang Kai himself, he would have never believed that the Master of a Sect had sent a secret message to an outsider to defeat an elite disciple of his own Sect.

On top of that, Wen Zi Shan actually promised to grant him a favour?

[What is the meaning of this?]

Even the intelligent Yang Kai could not fathom.

Just when he was lost in his thoughts, a fierce blow came his way.

“What are you thinking about? How dare you get distracted in front of your enemy? Are you underestimating me?” He finished his sentence with another attack, just as aggressive as the previous one, a force enveloping his fist, preparing to destroy anything in its way.

“Enemy?” Yang Kai raised his head abruptly, pierced Xue Yi with his ice-cold gaze. Without flinching, he returned Xue Yi’s attack with a punch just as vicious.

*Hong...*

There was a loud commotion, and the sky trembled.

The ground on which both Yang Kai and Xue Yi were standing began to crumble apart in a spider web pattern and collapsed into a large round pit.

*Chi chi chi...*

An ear-splitting sound emitted from their fists when their Source Qi clashed with each other.

The surrounding rubble and soil floated into the air weightlessly, and space within a thousand-metre radius was distorted.

“Not too bad!” Xue Yi raised his thick eyebrows slightly, surprised by the Yang Kai who was inches in front of him. Although Yang Kai was one Minor Realm beneath him, he was a tough opponent.

Xiao Bai Yi was astonished, his face changed ever so slightly.

“You’re not too bad yourself...” Yang Kai returned, the corners of his lips curved and sneered, “At talking!”

With a swing of his arm, Yang Kai sent another punch towards Xue Yi’s face.

Xue Yi did not falter. With a cold snort, he blocked the attack with his arms. He then immediately released his arms and took advantage of Yang Kai’s attack to launch a counterattack.

Yang Kai responded quickly by unclenching his fist and positioned it in front of his neck. He waited for Xue Yi’s attack to land and grabbed his punch tightly as though he was trying to crush it into pieces.

“How naïve!” Xue Yi grinned. He tilted his body backwards slightly, his feet rebounded from the ground like a cannonball, propelling him towards Yang Kai’s abdomen.

Yang Kai lowered his elbows ferociously, and he dissolved the attack before it arrived!

Fighting in close combat, their probing, attacks and counter-attacks were speedy, like flashes of light.

Each of their movements was as smooth as floating clouds and flowing water, free of any routine, fully captivating their audience.

There was a trace of solemnity in Xiao Bai Yi’s eyes.

Although he was ranked second in the Sect’s martial arts challenge, he would definitely be overthrown in close combat with Xue Yi. However, Yang Kai was on par with Xue Yi.

In other words, he was on the same level as Xue Yi in aspects of close combat.

What baffled Xiao Bai Yi even more was that Yang Kai only had the level of First-Order Dao Source Realm! He was one level lower than Xue Yi, two levels lower than him.

[Where on Earth does this guy come from?] He and Xue Yi are the elites of Azure Sun Temple!

*Peng peng peng...*

In front of the palace, the two figures crisscrossed, going back and forth in front without using any artifacts or secret techniques, only the collision of the bodies and Source Qi. The raging battle bloomed in wild beauty, dazzling anyone who watched it.

One large pit after another appeared on the ground, the void was battered by the violent forces, and the battlefield shifted from one place to another. The entire solitary peak was chaotic!

“Sister Gao...” Chen Qian was dumbfounded. She was shocked by Yang Kai’s abilities, but she was even more worried about the bet between Gao Xue Ting and the unscrupulous Temple Master. In the case of Yang Kai winning, who knew what this tasteless Sir Temple Master would request of Gao Xue Ting.

“Damn, I got it wrong!” Gao Xue Ting gritted her teeth and glared fiercely at Wen Zi Shan. He was still sipping wine and eating spirit fruit with a triumphant look etched on his face, aggravating the already frustrated Gao Xue Ting.

“Don’t be so confident.” Gao Xue Ting spoke coldly, “If that is the case, don’t blame me for summoning my trump card!”

As she finished, she stared down again with a slight change in Divine Sense.

Below, Xue Yi, who was in mid-battle with Yang Kai suddenly yelled in horror, “No!”

He seemed to have received a great shock, his face filled with terror.

Yang Kai ignored whatever that was happening to him and threw a direct punch at his face.

Xue Yi let out a strange cry. Like a kite with a broken string, he floated high above the ground, blood spurting out of his nostrils, then fell heavily to the ground.

“Huh?” Xiao Bai Yi gasped at the scene in astonishment, unable to fathom how Xue Yi could have received a direct hit when both parties were evenly matched.

“It seems like your help was wasted!” In the void, Wen Zi Shan smiled at Gao Xue Ting, fully taking pleasure in her misfortune.

Gao Xue Ting snorted coldly, said: “Save your nonsense, just wait and see!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Wen Zi Shan was unaffected by this embarrassment, after all, he had always been thick-skinned...

On the other side, Xue Yi slowly got up from the ground, rubbed beneath his nose and snickered, “Of course I don’t want to be confined for half a year... Ancient Dark Peak, that damn place is not meant for the living!”

“What nonsense are you talking about? Have you been beaten stupid?” Yang Kai squinted at him.

“I’m saying... you’re dead meat!” An extremely dangerous beam of light shot out of Xue Yi’s eyes, and his body was glowing. “I wanted to just teach you a lesson, but now... I might just kill you by accident!”

The light emitted by his body suddenly exploded, accompanied by a shocking roar, his skin and body glowed with a metallic lustre like steel.
