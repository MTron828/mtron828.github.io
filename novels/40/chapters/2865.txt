Outside the cave, different scales of battles broke out from time to time.

Sha Ya played the role of a traitor perfectly.

She baited all the Demon Great Generals within a ten thousand kilometre radius to this place, together with their corresponding subordinates. Every Demon group that rushed here for the purpose of ‘rescue’ was wiped out mercilessly by the Shaman Niu Clan without exception.

A three-month period of such battles had greatly promoted the growth of the clansmen in the Shaman Niu Clan, not to mention the Warriors who broke through their own shackles one by one under the baptism of blood, becoming true Warriors. Even many of the dozen Shaman Warriors and Shaman Apprentices had unknowingly broken through their respective bottlenecks and been promoted to a higher Realm.

Other than Yue and Lu, there were two newly promoted Shaman Masters in the Shaman Niu Clan, strengthening the power of the Shamanic Spells that blessed the whole army.

The increase in the number of the army was also extremely obvious.

At the beginning, there were only three thousand clansmen in the Shaman Niu Clan.

But three months later, the Shaman Niu Clan had grown to five thousand in number, almost twice its original size.

The additional two thousand clansmen were the captured clansmen that had been rescued in the battles. After they were purged of Demon Qi and regained their intelligence, they all joined the Shaman Niu Clan without hesitation and played a vital role in the following battles.

In the past three months, the Shaman Niu Clan had participated in more than a dozen battles, slaughtered at least ten thousand enemies, and killed more than a dozen Demon Great Generals. This was a glorious achievement. They could confidently say that no other army of a Shaman Grandmaster in the entire Barbarian Race had achieved such a splendid record; after all, Demon Great Generals were basically equally strong as Shaman Grandmasters. If other Shaman Grandmasters wanted to kill a Demon Great General, they would need to have the determination to sacrifice themselves and their army to achieve it.

But the Shaman Niu Clan was different. The leader of each baited Demon Clan group died the moment they met Sha Ya, and their respective subordinates would be thrown into chaos, ultimately being crushed mercilessly by the Shaman Niu Clan that charged at them from all directions.

After three months, not a single Demon could be seen within a ten-thousand-kilometre radius.

Sha Ya’s efforts were also recognized by all the Barbarians. Although she still had the identity of a Demon, everyone knew that she was on their side.

In fact, the battles in these three months were basically led by Sha Ya with the help of the twins, Yue and Lu. As for the commander of the Shaman Niu Clan, Sir Shaman Niu, he had not appeared for the whole three months and just stayed in his own cave.

Whenever a Shaman wanted to meet Yang Kai, he would be stopped by Sha Ya, or even by Yue and Lu.

If Sha Ya had not been committed to luring and killing the enemy and stood firmly on their side, perhaps everyone would think that it was actually Yang Kai being controlled by Sha Ya.

One day after the initial three months, the Shamans and Sha Ya were having a meeting and discussing what to do next when suddenly, Sha Ya looked back as if she sensed something, then bowed down and said, “Sir!”

All the Shamans also looked up and saw Yang Kai, who seemingly appeared out of nowhere, and hurriedly got up and saluted too.

Yang Kai waved his hand, “Pass down the order. Prepare to depart tomorrow.”

“Depart?” Yue was slightly stunned, “Sir, are we going somewhere else?”

Yang Kai replied, “There are no Demons around here anymore, so it’s meaningless to stay here. We’ll head to a new place where there are Demons.”

“Sir, you mean…” Yue was surprised.

There were indeed no Demons around here. After three months of Sha Ya’s baiting, she had lured in all the Demons within a ten-thousand-kilometre range and killed them.

Although there were Demons farther away, those Demons could not be commanded by Sha Ya. The jurisdiction of each Demon King was limited, so the Demons outside this range no longer fell under Sha Ya’s influence. Even if Sha Ya sent a request for reinforcements, those Demons would not necessarily obey.

They were also discussing whether it was time to move to another location, but no one could make a decision because Yang Kai was not present.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai showed up at this critical moment and made such a declaration.

Yang Kai smiled, “Although I’ve been cultivating this whole time, I’m still aware of what has been happening outside.”

While talking, he glanced at Sha Ya. She was branded by his Soul Imprint and became his slave, so Yang Kai could easily pry into Sha Ya’s mind from time to time. As such, he was naturally well aware of the current situation.

“Then I’ll pass down the order now.” Yue looked excited and immediately began to make arrangements. Other Shamans were also dismissed one after another. Although the migration of an army of five thousand people was not too big a task, it also wasn’t a small one. There would be many things that needed to be arranged.

Only Sha Ya was asked to stay by Yang Kai.

When the two were alone, Sha Ya’s brow jumped as she stared at Yang Kai in surprise, “Sir, your aura…”

It had only been three months since their last meeting, but the aura of this foreign race man had become several times stronger than before. According to the divisions of the Demon Race, he should be on the brink of reaching the Demon King Realm.

If it was by the standards of the Barbarian Race, he was about to be promoted to a Shaman King! Sha Ya had been here for three months now, so she knew a lot more about the Barbarian Race than before.

She clearly remembered that when she first saw Yang Kai three months ago, he was just a Mid-Rank Shaman Grandmaster. Even if he did nothing but cultivate for the past three months, he should not have been able to advance so rapidly.

A rumour that was secretly circulating in the Shaman Niu Clan suddenly came to her mind.

According to the rumour, Sir Shaman Niu was just an ordinary, powerless man before last winter. He was even inferior to some Barbarian children, but one night, he received the blessings of the Barbarian Gods and from then on soared to the Heavens.

This rumour seemed to come from the villagers of the same village as Shaman Niu, and those who spoke about it swore it was the absolute truth.

At first, Sha Ya did not take their words seriously, but now it seemed that these rumours did not just appear out of thin air.

Being able to advance from Mid-Rank Shaman Grandmaster Realm to the brink of the Shaman King Realm in just three months was simply too terrifying.

Shaman Niu had even once severely injured her when he was just a Mid-Rank Shaman Grandmaster, but now, his strength had increased several times compared to then. Sha Ya felt that even if she fought head-on with him now, she may not be able to escape like last time.

Yang Kai ignored her shock and continued, “Tell me, where is the nearest Demon King?”

As Yang Kai’s slave, Sha Ya naturally could understand his intentions and quickly answered, “I know a guy named Bao Qi, and I happen to know his location!”

Yang Kai stole a glance at her, and smiled, “Do you hold a grudge with him?”

Sha Ya’s pretty face twitched slightly, but she still readily admitted, “He humiliated me in the past, but he was the one in the wrong the whole time. However, his location really is the closest to us, so…”

“Good,” Yang Kai waved his hand and nodded gently, “You’ve worked hard these few months as my slave. Since you have grudges with this Bao Qi, I have no problem teaching him a lesson.”

“Yes!” Sha Ya’s beautiful eyes lit up.

Early in the morning of the next day, the Shaman Niu Clan left the stronghold that they had been residing in for three months and headed for an unknown but larger battlefield, their five thousand soldiers marching in an orderly manner.

After three months of battle, the Barbarians learnt much about coordination and discipline. Fighting bravely was not the key point in a large-scale battle, only by banding together, supporting one another, and trusting their comrades, could they hope to achieve victory.

The Aerial Cavalry went ahead to investigate the situation and relay information back to the army. Meanwhile, the group of five thousand continued to advance, not encountering any interception from the Demon Clan.

With the help of Sha Ya in recent months, all the surrounding Demons had been wiped out, and even if there were any survivors, they couldn’t even harm Shaman Niu’s army, let alone block their way.

Half a month later, the Shaman Niu Clan came to a halt in a jungle, utilizing the tall trees and dense grass to conceal their presence.

Sha Ya pointed at the front and mentioned, “Sir, there is a city of your Barbarian Race in that direction, that’s where Bao Qi has set up his base.”

Yang Kai nodded before asking curiously, “You live in a cave while he lives in a city, but both of you are Demon Kings. Why is the treatment somewhat different?”

Sha Ya was a little embarrassed and replied, “Bao Qi is stronger than me. In terms of your Barbarian Race’s rankings, I should be a Low-Rank Shaman King, while Bao Qi is a Mid-Rank Shaman King.”

“What Clan is Bao Qi from?” Yang Kai asked.

Sha Ya’s face turned solemn, “The Blood Demon Clan! So you must be careful not to get wounded by him in battle. Any wound is enough for him to use his Innate Divine Ability to its full potential to drain your blood to death.”

“I’ll remember that.” Yang Kai nodded slightly, and looking into the distance he continued, “We’ll rest for half a day, then begin at night.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Sha Ya received the order and left. Guessing Yang Kai’s intention, she felt a little uneasy. Although her Master’s aura was close to Shaman King and his true strength could not be judged by his realm alone, she did not know whether he could win against Bao Qi. He was a Blood Demon after all.

But now, as a slave, it was useless for her to think too much. No matter what decision Yang Kai made, she could not disobey it and did not even dare question him in her heart. Therefore, she could only find a place to adjust herself to her peak.

Time passed quickly, and when night fell, Sha Ya suddenly opened her eyes, looking over in a certain direction, and then walked out without saying a word.

Yang Kai stood a few kilometres away, waiting for her. After seeing her coming, he gently nodded his head, “From now on, I’m your slave, be careful not to expose any clues.”

Sha Ya smiled confidently, “Acting is also a skill of we Charm Demons. Don’t worry, little boy, Elder Sister will treat you well.”

She put away her respectful face and giggled, changing back to the way when Yang Kai first saw her.

Yang Kai did not care about her verbal offence and nodded slightly, following behind her with his head lowered, like a real slave.
