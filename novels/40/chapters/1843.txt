“Senior Bai...” Xia Jing Wu’s sweat dripped down his forehead as he forced out a smile, walked over, and cupped his fists. “Senior Bai, this lowly one is Xia Jing Wu and had the good fortune to meet Senior Bai three years ago. I wonder if Senior Bai still remembers?”

Bai Zheng Chu looked over at him coldly, “What thing are you?”

“Haha...” Xia Jing Wu chuckled, “Senior Bai need not remember such trivial things, en, however, this one has some friendship with Senior Bai’s subordinate, Senior Kang Sheng. Out of respect for that friendship, would Senior Bai be willing to enter the hall for a moment to allow this one to explain the situation in detail?”

While speaking, Xia Jing Wu took off the Space Ring from his hand and handed it to Bai Zheng Chu stealthily.

Almost all of his belongings were inside this Space Ring, but Xu Jing Wu had still handed it over without hesitation because he knew that, if the Chamber of Commerce could not survive this catastrophe, there was no way he could keep these things anyways.

“You know Kang Sheng?” Bai Zheng Chu glanced over at Xia Jing Wu in surprise.

Xia Jing Wu nodded repeatedly and bowed, “It is this one’s good fortune.”

Bai Zheng Chu sneered, “How could Kang Sheng associate with such trash? It seems he doesn’t need his patrol captain position anymore.”

As soon as this statement came out, Xia Jing Wu’s face changed drastically.

His words had now dragged the patrol captain named Kang Sheng into these muddy waters and brought disaster to him. After this incident, even if Bai Zheng Chu did not destroy Five Paths Chamber of Commerce, Kang Sheng certainly would not let them off.

The friendship between him and Kang Sheng was entirely based on Saint Crystals, and such a friendship was naturally quite fragile.

“Your courage isn’t small, daring to bribe a Vice Commander in front of everyone’s eyes!” Bai Zheng Chu coldly snorted before reaching out and seizing Xia Jing Wu’s Space Ring. Without even looking at it, he tossed it to one of his subordinates before declaring, “Five Paths Chamber of Commerce committed violence, flaunted Purple Star City’s laws, and attempted to bribe a Vice Commander to cover up their crimes, for these three charges, all of them are to be arrested.”

“Yes!” The group of cultivators snorted and surrounded everyone from Five Paths Chamber of Commerce.

Besides Hua You Meng, who was a Third-Order Origin Realm cultivator, only the woman named Gao Hong had reached the First-Order Origin Returning Realm out of the chamber of commerce’s members. Everyone else was just a Saint King. If Hua You Meng was at her peak, she may have been able to struggle, but under the effects of Xia Jing Wu’s Flower Petal Raindrops, she was now the weakest of all. Although she was still conscious, she could not use her Saint Qi and could only watch as her brothers and sisters were captured.

Soon, everyone from Five Paths Chamber of Commerce was taken down, with Xia Jing Wu and Yao Qing being the most bruised and swollen.

“We didn’t attack anyone, so why are we the ones being captured? I refuse to accept this!” Yao Qing yelled as he thrashed about.

“Oh? You did not hit anyone? So many people outside the city witnessed your Five Paths Chamber of Commerce’s people commit the act, could they all be lying?”

“If I say it wasn’t us, it wasn’t us!” Yao Qing ground his teeth and roared.

“Senior Bai...” Gao Hong wore a hesitant expression for a moment before she called out, “Reporting to Senior Bai, the one who committed violence was indeed not from our Chamber of Commerce. That person defeated Deacon Min with one move after all; how could our small Five Paths Chamber of Commerce hire such a master? Senior is wise and insightful, so surely you have seen through this already, yes?”

Bai Zheng Chu narrowed his eyes and stared at Gao Hong coldly as he snapped, “Are you accusing this Vice Commander of confusing right and wrong?”

“I wouldn’t dare!” Gao Hong trembled under the pressure as she grits her teeth and continued, “However, if Senior Bai only arrests us innocent people while letting the true culprit off, should this matter become known to Commander Lu, I don’t know whether Commander Lu would believe Senior Bai is confusing right and wrong and failing to execute his duties.”

“Impudence!” Bai Zheng Chu shouted sharply, his eyes becoming fierce.

Gao Hong forced herself to endure this pressure and stared up at him.

After a while, Bai Zheng Chu grinned meaningfully, “I did not expect that there were so many in this small chamber of commerce who don’t know how to fear the Heavens, good! Since you say the culprit is not from your Five Paths Chamber of Commerce... where is he?”

“He’s still here!” Gao Hong could not help but breathe a sigh of relief and quickly replied.

“Gao Hong!” Hua You Meng’s pretty face changed slightly as she directed a look of blame towards Gao Hong.

Gao Hong smiled sadly, “President, that person caused this trouble himself, so we can’t let our chamber of commerce take responsibility. Whether you blame me or not, I must tell the truth.”

Saying so, she stretched out her hand and tapped Hua You Meng’s neck, making it impossible for her to speak, only able to watch.

“The attacker is still in your chamber of commerce, yet you dare say he’s not one of you?” Bai Zheng Chu looked at Gao Hong with a sneer, “Do you take this Vice Commander for a fool?”

Gao Hong quickly explained, “Because he is not a member of our chamber of commerce, this one did her best to have the real culprit remain here to await Sir’s arrival so that the situation can be resolved.”

“Glib!” Bai Zheng Chu smiled slightly, seemingly satisfied with the answer, “Good, in that case, you lead the way. I want to see which bastard dares act presumptuously in my Purple Star City!”

“Sir, please!” Gao Hong stretched out her hand and immediately led the way.

Even if she was leading the way, she did not put down Hua You Meng though, whose body was still limp.

Gao Hong narrowed her eyes towards the pavilion where Yang Kai was located, her expression fluctuating. But after a moment, her beautiful eyes became firm, as if she had made some kind of big decision. Lowering one of her hands quietly, she pinched a few seals with her fingers.

Xia Jing Wu, who was following behind, saw this and his expression became solemn.

A moment later, under the leadership of Gao Hong, a group of people crowded around outside the guest house Yang Kai occupied.

“Sir, the person is inside. If Sir does not believe me, just tell him to come out and confront him, and you will know whether what I said before is true or false,” Gao Hong stood aside and pointed forward.

Bai Zheng Chu ignored her as his focus was on the pavilion in front of him. Releasing his Divine Sense, he probed the situation.

He had noticed that there was someone inside, but when he tried to spy on the other party’s cultivation, he found that his Divine Sense was unable to uncover anything. The moment it penetrated the other party’s body, it was like a stone sinking into the vast sea.

This discovery made Bai Zheng Chu stare blankly for a moment, aware that the opponent’s strength was not low.

This made sense though; after all, anyone who could defeat Deacon Min with a single blow was certainly not weak. At least, Bai Zheng Chu was unable to achieve such a feat.

As such, Bai Zheng Chu did not dare act too presumptuous and quickly took his Divine Sense back. However, this was still Purple Star City and he was used to being arrogant and domineering as a Vice Commander, so he still did not put Yang Kai in his eyes and shouted loudly, “Your Excellency dares wound my Purple Star City’s people? Quickly show yourself!”

No sound came from inside.

Bai Zheng Chu’s face suddenly became gloomy as he sneered, “Friend, if you know what’s best for you, come out on your own. I do not care what your background is or how powerful your cultivation is, anyone who dares act presumptuously in Purple Star City will have a miserable end. If you cooperate obediently, you may still have a chance to survive, otherwise...”

He waited for a while with a calm face, but still didn’t get a reply, causing him to become angry out of shame and shout furiously, “Playing cheap tricks! Just wait for this Vice Commander to throw you into the Frozen Prison. Let’s see if you can act so arrogant after that!”

Saying so, Bai Zheng Chu waved his hand and said to six nearby cultivators, “Go inside and capture him.”

The six cultivators were not stupid and knew that the man inside this pavilion was not someone to be provoked easily, but since Bai Zheng Chu gave them an order, they did not dare to disobey and could only charge in.

Everyone thought there would be some commotion next, and at worst, some sounds of fighting from inside the room, but on the contrary, after these six went in, they seemed to completely disappear, making not a single sound at all.

If it were not for their life auras not disappearing, everyone would have assumed they had simply vanished.

Bai Zheng Chu’s face grew more solemn.

The people from Five Paths Chamber of Commerce also looked at each other, unable to understand what happened inside.

A moment later, several figures flew out from inside and fell to the ground one by one, motionless.

Naturally, it was the six who just rushed inside, but each of them now wore a peaceful look on their face, as if they were asleep. On the surface, they did not seem to have suffered any harm and there was even one who wore a smile, seemingly dreaming a good dream.

*Ah...*

Bai Zheng Chu gasped audibly. These cultivators were all Origin Realm masters, and although they were just First-Order, they were not men who could be casually controlled. Even if he had taken action personally, he couldn’t achieve this.

Just who was it that was inside this house? Bai Zheng Chu’s heart began to pound nervously.

However, as one of the eight Vice Commanders of the Purple Star City Guard, he could not show weakness in this situation, so after steeling himself, he commanded, “Follow me.”

If he could not take down this troublemaker today, he would no longer be a Vice Commander. At this moment, he could only secretly pray that the other party was not an Origin King, otherwise, there was no way he could win.

A large group of guards rushed into the pavilion.

This time, it was no longer silent though as sounds of shouting and fighting immediately rang out. In the next moment, one cultivator after another was thrown out and fell to the ground, howling miserably.

In the blink of an eye, everyone who had rushed inside had been thrown out with the exception of Bai Zheng Chu, but from his continued screams, it was clear his situation was dire.

“Now!” Gao Hong, who had been watching coldly, suddenly yelled, held Hua You Meng tightly, and flew up into the sky.

Xia Jing Wu, who had already understood her intentions, also shouted, “Go!”

Yao Qing and Hai Tang did not react until this moment, but they still quickly followed after Xia Jing Wu and Gao Hong, wanting to escape from this chaos.

However, they only made it a couple dozen metres before a terrifying aura surrounded them. This aura was like a mountain pressing down on them, and before Gao Hong and the others were even aware of what was happening, they had been knocked back down to the ground.

In the sky above them, a series of ripples appeared and at their centre stood a figure which had appeared like a ghost.
