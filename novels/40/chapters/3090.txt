“Sir, if you doubt my loyalty, I’m willing to give you my Soul Brand. From now on, I’ll be your servant, and I’ll never utter a single complaint.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help laughing, but it wasn’t because he was mocking her. Instead, he admired her courage and boldness. As the Head Manager of the Fierce Gale Pirates, she was indeed a capable woman. If she was just a bit brainless, she would’ve died long ago.

Since she wasn’t foolish, then he might have a use for her in the future. Yang Kai knew nothing about Unending Star Field, so if he had a local as a guide, he would be spared a lot of trouble. Moreover, he was a cultivator in an incredible realm who had descended to this Lower Star Field. Although he possessed an astonishing power, he wouldn’t dare to use it as he pleased. Otherwise, he might be repelled by the Heavenly Way again. It would be a good thing for him to have someone to deal with trivial matters for him.

Moreover, this lackey was quite pleasing to the eyes, at least more so than a bulky man following him around.

Hearing his laugh, He Yun Xiang looked up at him, hope written all over her alluring face.

“You don’t have to be my servant, and I don’t need your Soul Brand.”

“Sir…” He Yun Xing was flustered. She couldn’t believe that he still wasn’t moved after she made her intentions clear. Did she have to take off her clothes and serve him in bed? Although she was prepared to go that far, that didn’t mean she wasn’t resistant to the idea.

“If you want to follow me, then you have to prove your worth. However, your cultivation is still too weak to do anything for me.”

He Yun Xiang was startled for a moment before her gaze beamed with ecstasy, “Sir, y-you mean…”

[Has he agreed? That’s certainly what it sounds like!] Never before in her life had she felt so nervous before. It was as though a beautiful landscape was unfolding right before her eyes, showing her the new future she would attain one day.

“So, improve your strength first.”

Agitated, He Yun Xiang replied, “Yes. I’ll cultivate now. I won’t disappoint you, Sir.”

Despite what she just said, her cultivation had come to a point that it was extremely difficult for her to reach the next realm. She had been stuck in the Second-Order Origin King Realm for hundreds of years already. If there was a chance for her to achieve a breakthrough, she would’ve seized it a long time ago. This wasn’t something she could achieve by sitting cross-legged and cultivating diligently. However, since Yang Kai said her cultivation was too weak, then she had to cultivate immediately. Whether or not she could achieve a breakthrough, she had to show him her sincerity.

“Open your mouth!” Yang Kai suddenly ordered.

He Yun Xiang was startled, but she quickly opened her mouth as she was told. Before she could even understand what was going on, she felt something entering her mouth and sliding down her throat to her stomach. She didn’t even manage to taste it.

The next moment, her expression changed drastically, because she felt a scorching heat in her abdomen, as though a fire was burning within her, consuming her from inside out.

[What is this? A pill? What kind of pill has such terrifying medicinal efficacies!?]

She knew that Yang Kai must have fed some incredible pill to her, so she immediately suppressed her shock and changed to a different position. She sat cross-legged on the ground and closed her eyes. Then, she performed several hand seals to circulate her Secret Art.

Yang Kai sat down on the side and ignored her as he took a sip of the spirit tea.

Gusts of wind whirled around in the room as all the ornaments clanged against each other. Ripples were formed in the bathtub as the water splashed out of it.

Blasts of uncontrolled Qi devastated the room, causing the place to turn into a mess. It was as though two peerless Masters had fought a life-or-death battle here. Yang Kai remained unmoving and did not try to resist those blasts of Qi as he just let them wash over him.

He Yun Xiang’s face had turned completely red as she kept moaning with difficulty. Her entire body was soaked in sweat, so her clothes stuck to her skin, emphasizing her alluring figure.

Her cultivation was rapidly improving, and it soon reached its peak after just an incense stick’s worth of time.

Then, her cultivation, which had been stagnant in the same realm for quite some time, suddenly surged and reached new heights. At the same time, an invisible aura spread across the room with He Yun Xiang as the centre, causing the already messy room to become even more chaotic.

Fortunately, this was Lu Huai Shuang’s room, and it was protected by several powerful Spirit Arrays, so the racket in the room wouldn’t spread. Otherwise, they would’ve attracted the attention of those from the Lu Family.

Then, a long groan was heard. He Yun Xiang’s face was so scarlet that it was as though she had applied a layer of rouge on her face. Her body stiffened, and her limbs convulsed uncontrollably. She opened her eyes slowly, and her gaze appeared blurred, as though she was just beginning to breathe again after experiencing a life or death battle.

Her body remained stiff for a long time before she suddenly gasped, upon which her plump bosom heaved violently, forming an impressive undulation.

Yang Kai found himself in an awkward position. It was just a breakthrough, but He Yun Xiang made it look like she had just been ravaged. At that instant, he wasn’t even sure what he should make of it.

Soaked in sweat, He Yun Xiang finally calmed herself down. For some reason, she felt as if she had become lighter, as though she had thrown away some burden that had been weighing her down. Her mind had become razor-sharp, and her vision became clearer than ever.

[This is the Third-Order Origin King Realm! I broke through to the Third-Order Origin King Realm just like that!?]

She thought she was dreaming, but when she turned her head and saw the young man’s meaningful grin, she realized that everything she just experienced was real. She was now a Third-Order Origin King, a peak level Master in the Star Field. The bottleneck that had been troubling her for hundreds of years had been broken through without her even understanding what was going on.

[What Spirit Pill was that? How is it so powerful?] FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Then, she gazed at Yang Kai with gratitude and admiration. Whether or not she would fall into any danger or even get killed while following him around in the future, the reward she had obtained now proved that her earlier decision was right.

If she hadn’t insisted on following him, this kind of reward wouldn’t have befallen her. If she were to cultivate on her own, she might not have reached the Third-Order Origin King Realm in her lifetime.

The man before her eyes allowed her to become a Third-Order Origin King with just one pill, so the chances he could bring her to even greater heights in the future were great.

Elegantly getting to her feet, He Yun Xiang was just about to offer her sincere thanks when she caught a whiff of a foul smell. After she examined herself with a frown, she instantly became embarrassed, for she realized that her entire body was covered in a sticky layer of what looked like black mud, as though she had just swum through a swamp.

Her embarrassment then turned to shock as she realized what had happened. She had gone through similar experiences in her life before, and had seen others go through this process a number of times. Normally, only those with weaker strength would encounter this situation when they first began to cultivate.

All her bone marrow and meridians had been cleansed, so she had practically been reborn now. The mud on her body was all the impurities that had been expelled from her body.

She didn’t expect that as she ascended from the Second-Order to the Third-Order Origin King Realm, she would experience this kind of cleansing, dramatically improving her constitution and physique. This surprise was far more exciting than the fact that she had achieved a breakthrough. A breakthrough simply meant reaching a new realm, obtaining a boost in strength, but the cleansing of one’s marrow and meridians meant that her cultivation aptitude had been fundamentally improved.

At that instant, she realized that she had underestimated the power of the Spirit Pill she had been fed. It was no wonder that she felt so light, as she really had shed her old form and been purified.

With her heart filled with surprise and joy, she thought that no one could be luckier than she was in this world.

“Sir, please forgive my discourtesy.” He Yun Xiang uttered before she leapt into the air and plunged into the bathtub. While she was in mid-air, she shed all her clothes. When her curvy figure dove into the water, she didn’t cause any splash at all, as though she was as light as a feather.

After submerging herself in the water for a while, she emerged on the surface, upon which all the impurities on her skin had disappeared, and her skin appeared delicate and snow-white.

The crystal clear water slid down her face that was as fine as the most beautiful porcelain in the world. The water slowed down when it reached her plump bosom and accelerated after it moved past the twin peaks, cascading down her flat belly.

She brushed away the water on her face and rested her arms on the edge of the bath. With her chin resting on her hands, she stared fixedly at Yang Kai. She didn’t attempt to hide anything. Although she appeared slightly embarrassed, she still tried to make herself look at ease. Since she had decided to serve him, she believed that she would become his woman sooner or later. So, it wouldn’t matter that she let him take a look at her naked body first.

Moreover, after what just happened, she secretly hoped that he would bed her sooner. If she could become his woman, then he would certainly treat her even better. Although she wanted something from him, she wasn’t ill-intentioned about it nor did she have any ulterior motive.

Yang Kai didn’t look away, as there was no reason for him to turn down a naked lady’s advances. As a man, he wasn’t afraid of looking at her as he took a seat beside the bathtub and said, “Tell me about the Secret Art you’ve been cultivating.”

He Yun Xiang’s expression changed as she realized something. Suppressing the excitement in her heart forcefully, she began describing her Secret Art in detail.

Her cultivation technique was one of the best in Unending Star Field, but while others might covet her Secret Art, she knew that the man before her eyes wouldn’t.

While she was explaining her cultivation technique, Yang Kai listened attentively and asked some questions from time to time. Then, he told her to show him her artifact. Upon examination, he formed a general idea of what to do.

One hour later, He Yun Xiang put on her clothes and stood before Yang Kai. After her marrow and meridians were cleansed of impurities, she appeared even more alluring than before. By just standing there, she was an attractive sight herself. However, she was slightly disappointed as she didn’t manage to arouse this man’s more carnal instincts despite the intimate atmosphere earlier.

Nevertheless, a man like him was indeed reliable, so she still felt that she had made the right bet this time.

“As cultivators, we tirelessly try to pursue a higher Martial Dao. However, we’re bound to come across enemies and battle against them along the way. When that happens, whether or not your cultivation is strong enough is often the deciding factor. Nevertheless, artifacts and Secret Arts are indispensable as well. Although your Secret Art is decent, it’s still too weak. I have a Secret Art with me that should be suitable for you. Take it and study it.” Yang Kai took out a jade slip and passed it to her.

Suppressing her excitement, He Yun Xiang performed a salute, “Many thanks, Sir.”

“I’ll also give you this artifact. Try to refine it as much as possible. I might need your help on Taiyi Star.”

Then, he passed an artifact that looked like a ribbon to her.

The ribbon was woven from seven colours, and it was bright and strikingly beautiful. He Yun Xiang fell in love with it at first glance. She had been pretending to be a man for a long time, so even her artifact was rather masculine. She had never used a feminine artifact before, so this ribbon had undoubtedly made one of her long-held wishes come true.
