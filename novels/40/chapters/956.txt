Chapter 957, Decision

Observing their responses, Yang Kai understood their difficulties, and after thinking about it for a moment, he invited, “Would you like to return to Nine Heavens Holy Land with me?”

Shui Yun was somewhat startled and directed a look of surprise towards Yang Kai, “That... that wouldn’t be appropriate...”

“How could it not be? It’s just that the environment there may not be suitable for your cultivation. Of course, if you are willing, I can temporarily grant you the status of Deacon in my Nine Heavens Holy Land. If later you wish to revitalize Water Spirit Temple, my Holy Land will lend you its full support!”

Listening to Yang Kai, Shui Yun’s eyes overflowed with a deep sense of happiness and gratitude. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Many thanks for Holy Master Yang’s generosity!” Shui Yun bowed his head.

“Shui Ling and I are friends, Senior Shui does not need to act like an outsider,” Yang Kai smiled.

Shui Yun was a First Order Saint, so a guest Deacon position in the Holy Land would not bring shame to him.

After a brief discussion, the three set out for Nine Heavens Holy Land.

Two days later, Yang Kai returned and immediately sent word to High Heaven Pavilion’s side.

Half a day later, Su Mu, Su Xuan Wu, and Ling Tai Xu rushed to the Holy Land and saw Yang Kai inside the main hall.

At this moment, all of the Holy Land’s Elders and all of the Ancient Demon Clan’s Great Commanders were present, each of them cloaked in a solemn atmosphere.

Sensing that the situation was quite serious, Ling Tai Xu couldn’t help but frown as he glanced towards Yang Kai, wondering why he had suddenly convened all his high-level forces here.

“Yang Kai, where’s Su Yan?” Su Xuan Wu was naturally concerned about the safety of his granddaughter, so when he looked around the hall and found no trace of her, he couldn’t help asking.

“Yes, brother-in-law, where is Elder Sister?” Su Mu also had his doubts. Yang Kai had gone out to find Su Yan, this was something they all knew, but now he had returned and without her, this fact alone caused them to become a little uneasy, concerned that something might have happened to Su Yan.

Yang Kai hesitated for a moment, but quickly organized his thoughts and expression before saying, “Su Yan is safe for now, but she is no longer in Tong Xuan Realm.”

Su Mu was startled and scratched his head, “What do you mean? If Elder Sister is not in Tong Xuan Realm, did she enter some Mysterious Small World?”

It had been some time since they arrived here so naturally, they were aware of the concept of Mysterious Small Worlds. The cultivators from the Great Han Dynasty even understanding that their original homeland was a relatively large Mysterious Small World.

Yang Kai shook his head and pointed his finger up, “She went to the Starry Sky!”

This time, everyone inside the hall was shocked, all the leaders of the Holy Land and Ancient Demon Clan staring at Yang Kai in disbelief.

“The Starry Sky?” Ling Tai Xu frowned, “Did you not say that the Starry Sky was filled with danger? That man named Wu Jie once talked to this old master about it and mentioned that anyone who had not reached the Third-Order Saint Realm that entered the Starry Sky would die without doubt.”

“En, that’s true, but Su Yan did not go there alone. There are five Saint Realm masters with her and they have an artifact designed to traverse the Starry Sky.”

“Brother-in-law, what happened?” Su Mu asked, his head unable to catch up with the situation.

Yang Kai sighed and began explaining what had transpired.

After listening to his story, everyone was dumbfounded. The strangeness of the Bone Race greatly frightened the Holy Land’s Elders.

“Holy Master, you mean to say that these Bone Race creatures are only living skeletons but they can actually absorb the flesh and blood of others to mould their own physiques?”

“Yes.”

“And they can create more of their race from a large amount of dead cultivator’s flesh and blood along with the appropriate herbs?”

“Exactly!”

“The higher the grade of the material, the higher the strength of these newborn creatures?”

“That’s what they said.”

Everyone’s heart sank greatly.

With just this information alone, everyone present was able to picture a future where the Bone Race dominated Tong Xuan Realm.

This race could invest its entire strength into a war without worrying about destroying their foundation. All they had to do was kill enough masters and they could give birth to new clansmen; what’s more, these newly born clansmen could extremely quickly become additional war strength.

If left alone, one day, the world would certainly become conquered by the Bone Race.

This was a catastrophe, a world-ending catastrophe!

“The situation is grave!” Xu Hui said heavily, “This matter must be told to the entire human race.”

“Even if we inform them, how many will believe it?” Yu Ying’s pretty face filled with worry. The news about the Bone Race was too sensational, if it wasn’t Yang Kai and instead someone else who had told them this story today, all the Elders present would have written him off as a raving lunatic.

“Whether they believe it or not is a matter for the future, we can only do what we’re capable of right now. I assembled all of you today for this matter, quickly arrange some manpower to go out and distribute this information to every force possible and make them continue to spread the word. Tell everyone that my Holy Land guarantees the authenticity of this information and that if they have any doubts, they may come to the Holy Land and speak directly with me!”

“Yes!” The Elders all acknowledged.

Without wasting another breath they departed and began making arrangements as all of them was well aware of the seriousness of this problem. If the Bone Race was not strangled in the cradle as early as possible and allowed to expand without check, even if the managed to assemble the power of the entire Human Race, they would be unable to stop them.

After the Elders left, Yang Kai turned to Li Rong and said, “You, Han Fei, and I will go to the Demon Capital!”

Li Rong’s tender body trembled, “Has Master decided to go?”

“En, whatever secrets are hidden there, I must unravel!”

“Good!” Li Rong nodded firmly.

“This old master will also accompany you!” Outside the hall, a deep sounding voice called out. When he heard this voice, Yang Kai’s expression shook and both he and Ling Tai Xu turned towards its source.

From outside the hall, Meng Wu Ya strode in, his face full of smiles as he let out a hearty laugh, “Brother Ling, it has been far too long, have you been well recently?”

“Brother Meng!” Ling Tai Xu was also quite excited and he hurried forward to welcome this old friend he had not seen in over a decade.

Meng Wu Ya had suddenly left only a few days after being brought back to the Holy Land by Yang Kai and was not present when the Great Han cultivators had arrived.

Before the two could speak many words though, Yang Kai called out, “Treasurer Meng, you’ve come back at a fortuitous time.”

“Do you want to go to the Demon Capital?” Meng Wu Ya turned his attention to Yang Kai.

“En.”

“Then I’m going with you. I also want to know what secrets are hidden there!” Meng Wu Ya eyes then flashed a profound light, “On top of that, I need to pay a visit to that Demon Commander. Last time he used an underhanded trick to seal my cultivation, this time I’d like to see how he plans to face me.”

Yang Kai smiled bitterly, “I’m not going there to find trouble with Zhang Yuan.”

Meng Wu Ya frowned, “You’ve met him?”

“En,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Be wary of him, Zhang Yuan is as insidious as he is ambitious. Don’t be deceived by his usual mild manner. If he really wants to act against you, he won’t show the slightest hesitation or mercy.”

“I know, but with you together with me, even if Zhang Yuan wants to play any tricks, do you think he’ll have the guts to try?” Yang Kai relaxed greatly.

It would have been sufficient with just Li Rong and Han Fei accompanying him, but now that Meng Wu Ya would be coming too, Demon Commander Zhang Yuan wouldn’t dare have any crooked thoughts.

“I hope he knows his limits,” Meng Wu Ya snorted.

“Treasurer Meng, why did you suddenly leave nearly a year ago, what have you been up to?” Yang Kai asked.

“Investigating, mainly about that Bone Race you were just speaking about!” Meng Wu Ya’s face suddenly became dignified, “But I only managed to learn that they are foreign invaders and that their deep sleep was somehow related to Great Demon God. Everything else I am not clear about. I was planning on going to the Demon Capital to inquire about them from Zhang Yuan, but since you also plan to go, we might as well go together. I have a hunch that as long as we go there, all the mysteries the Great Demon God left behind will become clear.”

“I also feel the same!” Yang Kai stared at him deeply, the two of them exchanging a grin.

Moreover, Yang Kai held the only key to unlocking the array in the Demon Capital, the Wordless Black Book, or as Zhang Yuan called it, the Demon Mystic Tome!

The secrets left behind by Great Demon God had puzzled generations of Demon Commanders, and Zhang Yuan was also very curious about it.

However, Meng Wu Ya being able to learn so much about the Bone Race was extremely impressive in Yang Kai’s eyes.

He had heard most of his information directly from the Bone Race, but Yang Kai didn’t know what method Meng Wu Ya had used to acquire his information.

Treasurer Meng’s network was obviously quite vast so being able to uncover some clues actually wasn’t too surprising.

After spending two days in the Holy Land taking care of various arrangements, Yang Kai took Meng Wu Ya, Li Rong and Han Fei and headed to the Demon Capital.

Passing through the Beast Sea Jungle, Yang Kai stopped at Thunder Tree Palace and told Thunder Dragon Great Senior about the Bone Race’s reappearance and made him aware of the stakes.

Thunder Dragon listened carefully, and although he found the story difficult to believe, since it was Yang Kai telling him so, he chose to unconditionally trust him.

Thunder Dragon solemnly declared that he would pass this information on to the other two Monster Race Great Seniors and discuss with them how to deal with it.

Yang Kai then continued on to the Demon Capital.

Passing through the entire Monster Domain, the group of four arrived in the Demon Land a few days later.

Feeling the Demonic Qi in the air, Li Rong and Han Fei both unconsciously relaxed, their beautiful faces showing looks of happiness. They were descendants of the Ancient Demon Clan and should by all rights be living in the Demon Land; it was only because they followed Yang Kai that they were currently staying in Nine Heavens Holy Land.

To them, the environment of the Demon Land was definitely more suited for them to live in.

Even though he had entered the Demon Land, Yang Kai still unscrupulously utilized his Star Shuttle. With the speed of the Flying Heavens Shuttle, even if the masters in the Demon Land became aware of them, they would be powerless to block their path.

The Demon Land’s area was inferior to the Human Territory, but still much larger than the Monster Domain. Meng Wu Ya also knew the way forward so there were no delays on the road or any need to stop and ask for directions to the Demon Capital.

With some idle time on his hands, Yang Kai inquired to Meng Wu Ya about his battle with the Demon Commander.

But the moment he asked, Treasurer Meng became angry out of shame and began unceasingly cursing.

From the few words between his various curses, Yang Kai managed to infer that Treasurer Meng had boldly run over to the Demon Capital all alone to challenge the Demon Commander, completely unaware that there was a hidden Grand Spirit Array beneath the Demon Capital. Zhang Yuan used this Spirit Array to trap Meng Wu Ya inside the city and fought him for a while three months before finally managing to apply the Profound Heavenly Seal to him.

It was also at that moment that Meng Wu Ya managed to luckily escape, but not before his Third Order Saint Realm cultivation was restricted to the Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary.

Since then, Meng Wu Ya had concealed his identity and been searching for ways to break this seal.

Finally, he had found his way to the Great Han Dynasty where he inadvertently discovered Xia Ning Chang who carried the Sacred Spirit Medicine Body.
