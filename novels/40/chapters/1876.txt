Kuang Shi Zong’s intent to kill was real, and he had the strength to back up his arrogance. He didn’t take Yang Kai’s threats to heart at all. Having made his decision, Kuang Shi Zong did not hesitate to act, stretching out his hand and pointing at Shen Tu as if he was really intending to kill him.

Shen Tu’s face paled as he felt the aura of death enveloping him, his whole body shivering from fright.

At that moment though, a mysterious power pulsed and Yang Kai’s figure suddenly disappeared.

Kuang Shi Zong’s eyes shrank and his outstretched hand suddenly clenched into a fist as the full power of his Third-Order Origin King cultivation gathered on it and blasted towards the space in front of him.

At the spot where Kuang Shi Zong punched, Yang Kai appeared like a ghost, shielding Shen Tu and the others behind himself, his face extremely solemn as both his palms stretched out towards the void.

Secret Technique, Exile!

Space Force surged as a black hole suddenly appeared in front of Kuang Shi Zong. This black hole was like the open mouth of an ancient beast that wanted to swallow him whole. The hole itself was filled with a chaotic nothingness that even a master like Kuang Shi Zong could not help trembling slightly before.

The powerful strength of a Third-Order Origin King burst forth.

*Hong...*

With a thunderous explosion, the black hole was shattered like a mirror, collapsing in on itself as the chaotic Space Force sputtered out in all directions, quickly transforming into countless blade-like attacks that launched towards Kuang Shi Zong.

“What a bold Junior!” Kuang Shi Zong was furious and his entire body shook as Saint Qi burst forth from it to form a protective layer that blocked the chaotic blades of Space Force.

*Xiu xiu xiu...*

An endless series of sounds resembling something cutting through the air rang out as pitch-black crescent-shaped blades slashed towards Kuang Shi Zong.

Secret Technique, Moon Blade!

Kuang Shi Zong narrowed his eyes as he felt huge danger from these Moon Blades. Not daring to despise them, he opened his mouth and spat out a jade-pendant-like artifact that swiftly twisted and transformed into a giant bird.

This giant bird had three heads, each the size of a house, and its wings flapped wildly as it gathered the surrounding World Energy and condensed it into countless wind blades that it shot out to intercept Yang Kai’s Moon Blades.

There was a burst of explosions as the barrage of Moon Blades and Wind Blades clashed mid-air, creating a region of space that was literally being shredded apart.

A fist slammed out from the rampaging storm of explosions and flew towards Kuang Shi Zong, five-coloured light radiating brilliantly from it. It was Yang Kai’s Indestructible Sword Qi.

Kuang Shi Zong reacted just as rapidly and threw out a punch of his own.

With a bang, Kuang Shi Zong’s body was shaken and he was forced to retreat three steps before finally standing firm. On the other hand, Yang Kai was sent flying backwards, his face turning pale as he tumbled through the air while trying to use his Saint Qi to resolve the rampaging energy that had penetrated his body.

The conflict had happened so quickly that most did not even understand what had happened. Even the First-Order Origin King Elders who were watching were confused about what had transpired, while only Gong Sun Liang and Li Mao Ming were able to witness the entire process.

The two of them could not help gasping as they exchanged a glance and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.

When the two of them joined forces to fight Yang Kai just now, they had been at a disadvantage, so they already knew Yang Kai was no ordinary Second-Order Origin King and had even guessed he might have the ability to fight a Third-Order.

But speculations were just speculations in the end; after all, neither of them knew just how strong a Third-Order Origin King really was.

However, at this moment, what they had only guessed at was really happening before their eyes.

Yang Kai had exchanged blows with Kuang Shi Zong, and although he had been at a disadvantage from start to finish, even winding up with some slight injuries, he was far from being defeated!

Who was Kuang Shi Zong? An old monster who had lived for thousands of years and had few equals throughout the entire Star Field. Each of these Third-Order Origin Kings had the power to destroy a small Star and were masters that ordinary people would never see in their lifetime. They were the supreme symbols of the peak of the Martial Dao, undefeated legends.

But Yang Kai was able to confront such a master head-on and not die.

Not only that...

He had also managed to rescue the people from Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce from Kuang Shi Zong!

This scene shocked Li Mao Ming and Gong Sun Liang to their cores and forced them to ask themselves if would they be able to achieve the same?

The answer was a resounding no! Most likely, they would have been heavily injured by Kuang Shi Zong’s first move and then been forced to retreat.

Above Purple Star City, Kuang Shi Zong’s expression fluctuated, not showing any embarrassment or anger, only solemness as he stared fixedly at Yang Kai without saying a word.

Not far away, Yang Kai stood before Shen Tu and the others, wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, raised his head slightly, and stared back at Kuang Shi Zong.

After a long time, Kuang Shi Zong asked seriously, “Space Force?”

“Senior’s perception is sharp!” Yang Kai grinned at him.

“You’ve actually managed to comprehend such an esoteric power? Even reaching such a level of proficiency!?” Kuang Shi Zong’s heart shook as his eyes nearly bulged.

Kuang Shi Zong had naturally heard of the Dao of Space as there were a number of people who had cultivated Space Force in the Star Field and even Purple Star itself, but most of these cultivators had only touched upon this mysterious force, and none could use Space Force in battle.

But the methods Yang Kai used just now clearly showed he had extremely deep attainments in the Dao of Space, otherwise, he would not have been able to move instantaneously or condense a blade of Space Force and form a chaotic black hole.

This was a shocking reality.

Li Mao Ming and Gong Sun Liang were both stunned as well. Only now did they understand that what Yang Kai had just used was the extremely esoteric Space Force. Realizing this, both of their expressions turned even uglier than before.

Didn’t this mean that when Yang Kai had fought them just now, he was not using his full strength?

Fighting two against one, falling into a disadvantage, and not even being able to make the other side use their true strength... this ugly truth made Gong Sun Liang and Li Mao Ming feel deeply ashamed.

“Since Senior understands, is he still confident in keeping me here?” On the other side, Yang Kai smiled and declared with a confident expression, “If I want to go, no one in this world can stop me!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Hearing what he said, Kuang Shi Zong actually nodded slightly and said, “Although your words are crazy, you are indeed qualified to say them.”

“It’s good that Senior understands. Now, why don’t we discuss this matter? Today’s affair will end here, I will leave with my few friends, and Senior will forget about everything that has happened, how about it?”

“In your dreams!” Kuang Shi Zong sneered, “It is true that since you are proficient in the Dao of Space, wanting to kill you is indeed impossible, but... That is only the truth if you were alone. Dragging along those dead-weights, do you still have the confidence to escape from this old master’s pursuit? No one here is a fool, so stop trying to play cheap tricks with this old master.”

Yang Kai brow twitched slightly as he said helplessly, “I didn’t expect that Senior would already see this far ahead. It is as you say!”

Shen Tu, who was being protected by Yang Kai heard this and a determined look appeared on his face as he said, “Brother Yang, just leave us here. If my life can ensure yours, this Shen Tu will die without regret.”

“We will follow Second Young Master to the death. On the road to the Yellow Springs, the journey won’t be lonely!” The several others expressed their opinions one after another, resolute as ever in the face of death.

Yang Kai turned his head, glanced at them, and smiled slightly, “Don’t worry, with things already having reached this point, naturally it is impossible for me to simply abandon you here. Today, all of us will leave here together!”

“Leave here together?” Kuang Shi Zong sneered, “Boy, you think too highly of yourself, in my Purple Star City, you don’t have the qualifications to act so impudently!”

Saying so, he waved his hand, and the eight Purple Star First-Order Origin King Realm Elders flew up to encircle Yang Kai together with Li Mao Ming and Gong Sun Liang. In the blink of an eye, ten Origin Kings had surrounded Yang Kai while the Third-Order Origin King, Kuang Shi Zong eyed him covetously.

Shen Tu and his entourage wore gloomy expressions as they realized that this time they were really unable to escape disaster.

Yang Kai, however, just laughed loudly, “Interesting, interesting! It’s rare to meet so many masters at once, it’s really exciting! If that is the case, then I can really cut loose and run amok!”

Kuang Shi Zong frowned, seeing Yang Kai still acting so rampantly, wondering what other cards he was hiding, unable to stop himself from worrying slightly.

“Everyone, be careful!” Yang Kai grinned before waving his hand and shouting loudly, “Come out!”

As soon as these words fell, a huge creature suddenly appeared above Purple Star City, one that was as tall as a mountain and blocked out the sunlight with its shadow as soon as it manifested.

“What is that?” Someone could not help but exclaim.

“So big? A humanoid puppet?”

“What the hell is it?”

Everyone stared up at this huge figure and almost lost the ability to think.

This figure was a thousand metres high and had a human form but was clearly composed of rock! Its body was rough and angular, but also bulky and burly, giving it an imposing appearance.

From its body, there was no aura of life, but the pure pressure it radiated was comparable to that of a Third-Order Origin King.

Every Origin King Realm standing midair felt as if a mountain was pressing down on them.

The cultivators below the Origin King Realm were under even greater strain as some with lower strength even lost the ability to fly and fell from the sky screaming.

This stone giant’s eyes were bright though, as if they were full of sentience, and once it appeared, it immediately began falling straight down.

It was as if a giant meteor was crashing to the ground.

“Not good!” Kuang Shi Zong roared upon seeing Yang Kai’s huge Embodiment falling downward, but just when he was about to move to intercept it, the sky suddenly darkened again.

Accompanied by the crisp bird cry, a massive Firebird with a long flaming tail suddenly appeared and covered the sky.

This Firebird seemed to be composed entirely of flames and had faint streaks of lightning flashing across its figure. The aura of destruction coming from it caused the hearts of many to clench and as it flapped its wings the surrounding temperature rose sharply.

Things had not ended yet though as several Golden Blood Threads shot out and transformed into various roaring beasts. The Blood Beast Army had appeared.

Thunderflame Bird, Tail Crown Snake, Silent Vermillion Bird, Star King Turtle, Eight Eyes Demon Toad, Purple Thunderbolt Sky Leopard...

There were many others as well. Besides the Steel Flame Ghost Spider that Yang Kai had left in Tong Xuan Realm to guard Nine Heavens Holy Land, all his other remaining Blood Beasts were dispatched now. Every Blood Beast emitted a powerful energy fluctuation that was no weaker than a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master. Nearly twenty Blood Beasts gathered in one place, releasing a blinding golden light that seemed to soar up into the Starry Sky.
