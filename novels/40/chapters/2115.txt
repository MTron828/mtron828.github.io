After he had refined the blood of a true Dragon, the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique’s form became quite different from before.

The first difference was his hands. Previously, only one of his hands turned into a Dragon Claw, yet now it was both, and it went without saying that two Dragon Claws were stronger than one, while the might of those said Dragon Claws was indomitable and they were able to contend against an Artifact befitting someone with his cultivation base.

In the past, his arm had also been covered by Dragon Scales formed out of his energy but they didn’t have a scarlet tint nor a wisp of a Fire Dragon’s aura. They were now obviously harder and stronger than before, while the Dragon Scale Armor formed by the genuine Dragon Scale in his chest provided Yang Kai with pretty good defence.

Refining a drop of a true Dragon’s blood alone had so many amazing effects, and he couldn’t help but wonder what he would get if he refined and fused the Dragon Bone Sword with his body.

As this thought sprung into his mind, he got quite enthusiastic and he dispelled the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique then sat down cross-legged again.

Refining a Dragon Blood was quite simple, as he only had to swallow it down, but the Dragon Bone Sword was different. This was a piece of a dragon’s backbone and he couldn’t resort to the same method with it.

But, he had already refined it roughly once and he could collect it into his body, and as long as he put some time into it, he would be able to fuse with it.

Yang Kai didn’t hesitate and he immediately divided the Dragon Bone Sword’s two materials, the Dragon Backbone and Dragon Bead, then fused them with his body and started refining them.

...

In the serene Small Sealed World, a month quickly elapsed.

In the last month, many people in Maplewood City came over to visit Yang Kai. Among them, the number of Mo Xiao Qi’s visits had been the highest, followed closely by Kang Si Ran, and the City Lord’s Mansion’s people, as well as the various families’ Dao Source Realm Ancestors.

But, the Zhang family’s matriarch had already gotten a Divine Sense Message from Yang Kai, and she knew that he wouldn’t accept any visits during his secluded cultivation. So, she could only brace herself and keep the guests outside.

It hadn’t been difficult for her to deal with Mo Xiao Qi, Kang Si Ran, Duan Yuan Shan, Qin Zhao Yang, and others, as they didn’t embarrass her after hearing about Yang Kai’s secluded cultivation. They had only raised some questions about Yang Kai’s current situation out of concern.

The Zhang family had even gotten close to those few Dao Source Realm Masters through this and they got a lot of help from them.

But the other families’ Dao Source Realm Ancestors didn’t treat them kindly. They had all come excitedly to recruit Yang Kai and invite him to undertake an elder position in their families, yet they had been obstructed by a First-Order Origin King granny, and they all felt like they got the cold shoulder.

During this ordeal, the Zhang family’s granny and beautiful madam had been quite nervous and fearful, and they could only smile apologetically and provide them with an explanation.

After several similar visits, people stopped dropping by.

Even though the Dao Source Realm Ancestors were displeased by the Zhang family’s treatment, they still didn’t dare to make trouble for those orphans and widows, simply because they were under the protection of the City Lord’s mansion. The Zhang family had gotten through this ordeal without suffering any harm thanks to them.

...

After a month, Yang Kai left seclusion safely, and upon getting news of it, all of the Zhang family’s members dropped by to visit him.

The granny enquired about his well-being for a while, then said, “Sir, I have something to tell you. A lot of people came to see you in your seclusion.”

“En.” Yang Kai didn’t inquire about them, simply because he could easily guess who had come.

“In addition, the Spirit Pill Plaza’s Shopkeeper Kang and Miss Mo Xiao Qi both left a jade slip for you,” as the granny spoke, she cast a meaningful glance at Zhang Ruo Xi.

Zhang Ruo Xi understood her intentions and she respectfully handed over two jade slips to Yang Kai then stood next to him with her head lowered.

Upon getting the jade slips, Yang Kai swept one of them with his Divine Sense then said with a smile. “As expected, Brother Kang has been transferred...”

Upon hearing him, the Zhang family’s granny nodded and said, “That’s right, it looked like Shopkeeper Kang has gotten a movement order from the headquarters of the Violet Source Chamber of Commerce and he has already left Maplewood City half a month ago. In his last days, he stayed in our mansion, hoping to see you one more time before leaving, but it’s a pity that you didn’t leave seclusion in time.”

“I hope we cross paths again,” Yang Kai revealed a faint smile.

He had already guessed long ago that Kang Si Ran would be transferred.

After all, Maplewood City was quite small, while Kang Si Ran had already advanced into the Dao Source Realm and it was beneath him to manage a store here. The Violet Source Chamber of Commerce would obviously pick a better place in need of his talent.

Kang Si Ran was a member of a Chamber of Commerce and couldn’t act as he wished. He couldn’t defy an order passed down by the headquarters unless he planned to betray it. But, if he had done so, he wouldn’t have a place for him in the whole Southern Territory.

“Prior to his departure, Shopkeeper Kang said that he didn’t know where he would be transferred to, but he said that he would send a message to you after ascertaining his new destination, and he mentioned that he would be at your call whenever you need him. Furthermore, he said that he felt ashamed that he couldn’t bid you farewell in person and he hopes that you can forgive him,” the Zhang family’s granny reported solemnly.

Yang Kai nodded in response. Kang Si Ran was quite considerate. He had gotten his current cultivation base only thanks to the Dao Source Pill gifted to him by Yang Kai, and he was obviously quite grateful to him.

Yang Kai didn’t comment and he just scanned the other jade slip. When he checked its contents, a surprised look appeared on his face, “Xiao Qi has also left?”

The jade slip’s message was quite simple and it only had several sentences.

“Hateful Brother Yang, why are you still in seclusion? I can’t even see you one last time. Aunt Feng has come for me, and I have to leave. If I don’t leave now, I won’t make it in time...”

Mo Xiao Qi’s origins were quite mysterious, but Yang Kai could still easily discern her outstanding familial background, and from the message left by her in the jade slip, it looked like her relatives had come to fetch her.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but imagine this scene. A rebellious young girl left her home to travel the world, yet they caught her trails and sent masters after her. In the end, she got intercepted and captured by them, then taken back home.

“Xiao Qi’s fate is so pitiful...” Yang Kai sighed. He sympathized with her, but he wasn’t worried about her. She had only said that one of her relatives had come to capture her and take her back home, and it would be unlikely for them to harm her.

Moreover, Yang Kai had once heard Mo Xiao Qi mention Aunt Feng, and it looked like they were quite close, as Mo Xiao Qi said that her Aunt Feng had told her a lot of good stories.

He had only stayed in seclusion for a month, yet two of his friends had already left Maplewood City, and they were forced to leave. He couldn’t help but lament over this ever-changing world.

Yang Kai crushed the jade slips then said, looking at the granny, “Is there anything else besides this?”

The granny replied, “The Qin Family has sent someone to pass a message to you, asking you to drop by their home once you finish your secluded cultivation. They said that they have an answer for your question.”

“Huh?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up and he said out of delight, “That’s awesome, I’m leaving for the Qin Family right now.”

As his voice fell, he stood up. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Zhang Ruo Xi said anxiously, “Sir... Do you need me to accompany you?”

Yang Kai replied, “That isn’t necessary, stay home and focus on your cultivation.”

“Then... Take care.” A sad gleam flashed past Zhang Ruo Xi’s eyes, but she quickly recalled the previous ordeal with the Space Spirit Jade and got a newfound resolution.

She still couldn’t provide any help to Yang Kai with her current lacking cultivation base, and she had to improve her cultivation to uncover the secret of the Space Spirit Jade and help Yang Kai.

Yang Kai strode forward within the hall, while his body flickered and disappeared before his foot reached the ground.

...

After a short moment, Yang Kai reached the home of Maplewood City’s Qin Family.

This time, he didn’t go inside right away and he stood outside and released his Divine Sense.

In the next moment, Qin Zhao Yang’s laughter resounded within the Qin Family’s home. He said, “Brother Yang, you have finally left seclusion.”

As his voice fell, Qin Zhao Yang had already appeared within Yang Kai’s line of sight. He was as swift as lightning and he quickly reached Yang Kai, then started examining him back and forth with his eyes. Soon after, his pupils contracted and he blurted out, “Brother Yang, it looks like you made a lot of progress in your seclusion.”

Qin Zhao Yang couldn’t really explain what he was feeling. Yang Kai’s cultivation base didn’t improve at all, yet he looked stronger than before, and even his aura had gotten stronger.

But, he quickly understood that Yang Kai should have cultivated some Secret Technique in his seclusion that lasted a whole month.

He didn’t bother with getting to the bottom of this and he didn’t even wait for Yang Kai’s answer. He just said warmly, “Come, please come in.”

Yang Kai revealed a smile and followed Qin Zhao Yang into the inside of the Qin Family’s home.

In the way, all members of the Qin Family greeted him politely with a solemn expression and they all didn’t dare to slight him.

Surprisingly though, Qin Zhao Yang didn’t bring him into the reception hall, rather he went to a certain chamber.

After they reached the chamber, Qin Zhao Yang said with a smile, “Brother Yang, I know that you have left some questions for Yu’er and it looks like she has already found the answer. She’s now inside, please go in and discuss it with her. After you’re done, I’ll come back to have a chat with you. By the way, Yu’er didn’t breathe a word about your questions, and she didn’t tell me anything.”

“I trust Miss Qin,” Yang Kai nodded and pushed the door then went inside.

It was the same chamber as before and Qin Yu had already been waiting here for him for so long. Upon seeing him, she quickly stood up and greeted him.

“Miss Qin, you’re so polite, there are no strangers here.” Yang Kai waved his hand at her in response.

“We must respect basic courtesy,” Qin yu said with a smile.

Yang Kai cast a glance at her with a smile, but his expression suddenly turned strange and his gaze stayed locked into her face for several seconds. In the end, he couldn’t help but furrow his brows as if he had detected something unusual.

Qin Yu opened her mouth and spoke, oblivious to everything, “Sir, you have once questioned me about a Golden Silver Exotic Tree and I have flipped through some books left by our ancestors in the past days and I have finally found some inklings.”

“Go on and elaborate further,” Yang Kai quelled his excitement and spoke calmly.

“Prior to this, I have a question for you,” Qin Yu said.

“What is it?”

“Did the Golden Silver Exotic Tree in the scene seen by you display any special abilities?”

“Why are you inquiring about this?” Yang Kai furrowed his brows.

Qin Yu said, “At the beginning of the world, everything was pure chaos. Even time and space was unstable. At that time, the Firmament Tree emerged and sealed the world with its Yin-Yang Chaos Power, suppressing the void, locking the whole world, and trapping the four seas...”

Qin Yu’s voice was low and indistinct, while her eyes flickered in a silver radiance as she uttered those words. They looked quite profound and mysterious!

“It has been like this until an almighty being cast a great Divine Ability to shatter the seal of the void, destroy the cage and slay the Firmament Tree... The power of Heaven and Earth had finally exploded out for the first time and innumerable Mighty Warriors emerged one after the other in those Primordial Times. They all cast and displayed their Divine Abilities and fought for supremacy.”
