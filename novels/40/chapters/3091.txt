He Yun Xiang didn’t have the time to look into the Secret Art yet, but she believed that since it was given to her by Yang Kai, it wouldn’t be weak. At the very least, it must be better than her own cultivation technique.

On the other hand, she could tell that this artifact was sublime at first glance.

She ran her hand over the ribbon and felt the aura fluctuation coming from it. With an agitated expression, she looked longingly at him, “Sir, your cultivation really must be above the Origin King Realm!”

Most cultivators in this Lower Star Field were aware that there was a higher realm than the Origin King Realm, but they didn’t know the secrets of that realm or how to reach it. They didn’t even know its name.

Normally, they would just refer to it as a realm that was above the Origin King Realm.

The artifact in her hand must be above Origin King Grade, so the person who gave it to her must be in a realm that was higher than the Origin King Realm.

“The realm above Origin King is called the Dao Source Realm.” Yang Kai flashed a smile at her.

“Dao Source Realm?” He Yun Xiang raised her head and looked excitedly at him. It was the first time she found out the name of the realm that was above the Origin King Realm, as though a door had opened right before her eyes, which showed her an entirely new world.

“Only by transforming all your Saint Qi into Source Qi will you have the right to achieve a breakthrough to the Dao Source Realm. Cultivate diligently, you still have a long way to go. What you have to do now is to strengthen your foundation.”

He Yun Xiang suppressed her excitement and longing as she replied respectfully, “Yes.”

“You may leave now. Inform me when we’re about to reach Taiyi Star. Don’t bother me if there’s nothing urgent.”

He Yun Xiang bowed and turned to leave. She pressed the ribbon against her chest, as though she was holding the most precious treasure in her life. After she left the room, she didn’t look for a secret room to cultivate immediately. Instead, she directly sat cross-legged in front of the door, acting as Yang Kai’s bodyguard.

A short time later, Lu Huai Shuang came to look for Yang Kai.

Earlier, she had gone to handle the matter regarding the He Family’s Starship. She told some Lu Family members to sail the He Family’s Starship back to Morning Sun Star first. The He Family’s Patriarch and hundreds of their top cultivators were dead, so she had to let the Lu Family members back home know about it as soon as possible so that they could begin preparations. When she returned to Morning Sun Star, she could directly launch an attack on the He Family.

After the He Family was destroyed, she believed that there would be no more dangers to the Lu Family left on Morning Sun Star.

When she saw He Yun Xiang sitting outside the room, she didn’t pay much attention to her at first, but she soon fell into a dazed state.

They had just separated for four hours, but she could feel that this Fierce Gale Pirates Head Manager had gone through some kind of transformation. The latter had become even more charming and alluring. Although she was a beautiful woman herself, Lu Huai Shuang was still enchanted by He Yun Xiang’s current beauty.

Following that, she exclaimed in absolute shock, “How have you reached the Third-Order Origin King Realm!?”

He Yun Xiang had just achieved a breakthrough, so she couldn’t conceal her aura yet.

It was apparent to Lu Huai Shuang that the woman before her eyes was a Third-Order Origin King, but less than half a day ago she was still just a Second-Order Origin King!

He Yun Xiang smiled without replying to her. It wasn’t that she wasn’t willing to reveal the secret to her, but Yang Kai’s methods were too inconceivable. She was worried that Lu Huai Shuang might develop ill intentions upon finding out what happened. If this woman also wanted to rely on Yang Kai, then there would be one more competitor for her.

Naturally, as the Head Manager of the Fierce Gale Pirates, she wouldn’t ask for such trouble herself.

Despite her silence, Lu Huai Shuang was easily able to figure out some things and asked in shock, “It was him, wasn’t it?”

With a smile, He Yun Xiang replied, “Sir is cultivating in seclusion right now, and I need to meditate as well to consolidate my breakthrough. Little Sister, please go back now if there’s nothing important. Sir told me to inform him only when we’re about to reach Taiyi Star.”

A myriad of expressions came over Lu Huai Shuang before she nodded her head, “Good. Congratulations.”

The transformation in He Yun Xiang had had a huge impact on her. [Is this the benefit of relying on a Master like him? What’s the point of me having persevered for so many years? The Lu Family is such a heavy burden on my shoulders, which makes it difficult for me to even breathe sometimes. Should I just give it all up and ask him to become my Master as well?]

The man inside the room was the best choice she would ever come across. Since he could accept He Yun Xiang, then he might accept her as well. She was confident that she wouldn’t lose out to anyone when it came to her beauty. That was the innate advantage of a woman.

[No! She’s walking down the path she has chosen and I have my own path to explore. Vines can grow taller by climbing a huge tree, but with the help of sunlight and rain, a sapling can grow into a mighty tree as well.]

At that instant, the shackles that had chained her for years relaxed a little, causing her aura to change slightly. With her gaze becoming determined, she put on a smile as she had let go of something in her heart, “Got it. I’ll inform you about it by then.”

[We’re not the same kind of people. You have your own way to survive, and I have my own method to grow stronger. Although the paths we’ve chosen are different in terms of difficulty, our destination is the same. When we come across each other in the future, I hope you won’t be too surprised.]

…

The black Starship started to lift off and left the Dead Star, accelerating out into the borderless Star Field.

It was the first time Yang Kai slowed down his pace in years. On his Martial Dao, he had always been running ahead diligently, not daring to slack for even a moment. What spurred him on were the threats from all directions and his desire for greater power. Now that he had slowed down all of a sudden, he realized that there were more paths in his life than he had imagined, and the view around him was magnificent as well.

During his stay in the room, he would often enter the Small Sealed World and chat with Liu Yan, the Embodiment, and the others inside. Sometimes, he would boil a pot of tea and read an ancient book for days. His life on the Starship was quite relaxing.

One had to know when to work hard and when to relax when cultivating. A skilful archer would untie the string when the bow wasn’t in use to ensure the longevity of his instrument.

It was said that by reading more books, one could marry a beautiful wife and earn a lot of money, thereby achieving success in life. However, that was just self-delusion and consolation for those poor scholars. However, it couldn’t be denied that one could improve one’s state of mind by reading more books.

(Silavin: Oh shit! He got us! Man down man down!)

All of a sudden, he put down the ancient text in his hands and gave it a hard thought. Moments later, a realization dawned upon him, “It’s because I’ve always been in a rush!”

He had always been cultivating at an incredible speed, and each of his breakthroughs was astonishing enough to shatter most peoples’ imagination. However, since he reached the Emperor Realm in the Shattered Star Sea, he had been stuck in this realm for a long time. He couldn’t achieve a breakthrough no matter how hard he tried.

He had always thought that it was because he hadn’t come across the right opportunity to ascend to the next realm. However, he now realized that it wasn’t that the opportunity hadn’t come to him. Instead, it was his mentality that was the problem here. He had always been in a rush to pursue greater strength and achieve a breakthrough from the First-Order to the Second-Order Emperor Realm to explore the secrets of a higher Martial Dao.

What he didn’t realize was that the more eager for success he was, the further his goal drifted away from him. His attitude to relentlessly pursue progress had formed a shackle that chained him to the peak of the First-Order Emperor Realm.

Although he had an inkling of this previously and had planned to let nature take its course, he still craved greater power when he was in an environment like the Star Boundary. Naturally, he couldn’t be at ease, thus failing in his attempt to achieve a breakthrough.

However, since he came to this place, not only did he not dare to use his power as he pleased, but he had also suppressed his cultivation as best he could. Also, he couldn’t cultivate at all. It was when he was forced to enter such a relaxed state that he finally realized the crux of the problem.

It was like a shaded area under the light. The problem had always been right before his eyes, but he had failed to notice it because he had never looked down at his own feet.

Whether or not he could return to Heng Luo Star Field this time, the journey had been fruitful because he had realized his own problem. He believed that he would be pleasantly surprised when he returned to Star Boundary.

Then, he picked up his book again and poured his attention into it. He was so quiet that it was as though he was someone who was in his twilight years.

*Du du du…*

Someone suddenly knocked on the door.

“Come in,” Yang Kai uttered without raising his head.

He Yun Xiang pushed the door open and entered the room, upon which the pleasant fragrance wafting from her body soon permeated the entire room.

“Sir, we’ll be landing on Taiyi Star soon,” She wouldn’t dare to forget Yang Kai’s order. Right after Lu Huai Shuang’s subordinate informed her about it, she immediately knocked on the door to inform him.

“Good.” Yang Kai acknowledged as he continued staring fixedly at the ancient book.

[Is that some kind of supreme Secret Technique Manual?] He Yun Xiang’s interest was piqued. Yang Kai could easily give her a profound and abstruse Secret Art, so his heritage must be incredibly rich. Hence, the book he was reading so attentively must contain great mysteries and unfathomable knowledge.

She knew that it was wrong to take a peek, especially when the other party was a powerful Master, which might cause him to feel repulsion. If that happened, her previous efforts would all be wasted.

However, a woman’s curiosity would bounce back harder the more it was suppressed. Initially, He Yun Xiang kept her head lowered. Yang Kai was unsuspecting, but it didn’t mean she could take a peek at his secrets.

Nevertheless, a moment later, she couldn’t contain her urge anymore, so she stole a glance at the ancient book. However, when she saw the book’s title, the corner of her mouth twitched. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

[‘Emerald Mountain Record’? This is not a Secret Technique Manual at all!]

*Pa…*

Yang Kai closed ‘Emerald Mountain Record’ and rose from the chair. As he moved past her in a few steps, he uttered, “Let’s go.”

Hearing that, He Yun Xiang hurriedly followed after him.

“Your realm is only considered stable when you attain complete control of your aura, allowing you to take it out and conceal it at will. You have to work harder.”

Upon hearing what he said, He Yun Xiang nodded repeatedly and replied obediently, “Sir, you’re right. It’s just that it’s been too short a time.”

Only half a month had passed, so she didn’t have enough time to fully consolidate her new cultivation. Although she was already in a better state than half a month ago, her Third-Order Origin King aura was still pretty conspicuous. Anyone with a decent enough vision would be able to easily sense it.

“How about the refinement of the artifact?”

“I’ve achieved some success, but I still can’t wield it freely.”

The ribbon was a Dao Source Grade Low-Rank artifact. Yang Kai couldn’t remember how he obtained it. He had killed many cultivators over the years, and their belongings had all become his spoils. Although it was only a Dao Source Grade Low-Rank artifact, it was still difficult for He Yun Xiang to refine it because she had just reached the Third-Order Origin King Realm not long ago.

“What about the Secret Art?”

“I’m still studying it.”

“En, feel free to ask me if there’s anything you don’t understand.”

“Many thanks, Sir! There are indeed many parts that are difficult for me to understand.” He Yun Xiang didn’t pretend to understand more than she did. If she wanted to work under Yang Kai, she had to make sure that she was useful to him, since her worth stemmed from her power.
