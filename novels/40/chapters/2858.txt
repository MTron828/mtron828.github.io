Yang Kai stretched out his large hands to grab the twins, seizing them as easily as if they were two chicks.

In front of everyone’s eyes, the twins looked frightened and uneasy but could not help being drawn over to Yang Kai, who then took them and flew back to the Demon Race’s side.

The rest of the Shamans watched, as chills spread out from every pore of their bodies, freezing them all in place.

Sha Ya’s proud laughter resounded across the whole battlefield, a grating sound in every Ancient Barbarian’s ears.

A figure suddenly flashed in front of the trio. It was Tiea, who blocked the way.

At the same time, Yue and Lu revealed a look of surprise and pleaded in unison, “Madam, Shaman Niu has defected to the Demon Race! Quickly stop him!”

After getting closer during their time together, Yue and Lu learnt that Tiea was also a Shaman Grandmaster, the same Realm as Shaman Niu, so perhaps she could successfully stop him.

Tiea turned a deaf ear to them, however, and just stood still, staring at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai also stopped, squinted at Tiea, and asked, “Do you want to stop me?”

Tiea fell silent for a moment before quietly moving aside to make way for him, causing the light of hope in Yue and Lu’s eyes to vanish.

Yang Kai nodded and flew past Tiea, taking Yue and Lu with him.

“Be careful…” Tiea whispered so softly that if one had not been paying very close attention, they would not have heard her.

Yang Kai flew off and soon disappeared.

“The battle is not over yet! What are you all just standing around for!?” Tiea shouted at the Shamans below and took the lead in charging ahead. She fluttered lightly and dived into the battle. From time to time, while she was slaying the Demons with her agile skills, her hands would release a burst of light as she cast Shamanic Spells, granting all kinds of support to the Barbarian Warriors around her.

Seeing her like this, the thirteen remaining Shamans regained their spirit and gradually stabilized their minds. Their incantations sounded again and the light of Shamanic Spells flickered repeatedly.

On the other side, Yang Kai landed on the ground and loosened his grip on Yue and Lu, who fell to the ground. The twins’ glared at him fuming as if a volcano was hidden in their eyes. After staring at Yang Kai, they took a glance at the half-naked Sha Ya with their teeth clenched. While feeling humiliated at their current situation, they also felt angry at Yang Kai’s cowardness.

If they had known that Shaman Niu was such a person, they would never have agreed to follow him.

“Is this sincerity enough for you?” Yang Kai questioned, smiling at Sha Ya.

Sha Ya smiled meaningfully as she looked down at Yue and Lu before looking back at Yang Kai and slowly shaking her head.

Yang Kai frowned, “They are the heart of three thousand Barbarians of my Clan. I have captured them for you, how is this not good enough?”

Sha Ya raised her hand lightly and casually pointed to Lu, “Kill her!”

As soon as these words came out, the faces of Yue and Lu changed.

“Kill her and I will believe you.” Sha Ya looked at Yang Kai with her head tilted, a trace of provocation apparent in her eyes.

She was not a fool. Although this Barbarian Shaman Grandmaster was poisoned by the Green Demon Poison and showed intentions to submit, that alone was not enough to win her trust.

This was her last test. If this Barbarian Shaman Grandmaster could kill his former subordinate without hesitation, she would not doubt his intention to surrender. Otherwise, she would assume this was all a trick to get close to her and save himself!

Sha Ya was feeling somewhat conflicted right now. She hoped that this Barbarian Shaman Grandmaster would insist until the end and would rather die than give in, because struggling prey was the best prey. On the other hand, she did not want him to die just like that. She sincerely wished he would become her obedient slave and follow her every command…

Therefore, she also had no idea which choice she hoped this man would make.

She observed his face carefully, hoping to see hesitation and struggle, which would at least entertain her for a bit.

However, to her amazement, Yang Kai just walked forward silently after listening to her order, without the slightest hesitation.

The twins’ faces changed drastically as Yue summoned her courage and stood in front of her sister, glaring at Yang Kai and shouting sternly, “Kill me, but let her go!”

Yang Kai stood in front of her like an insurmountable mountain, looking down at her as he nodded lightly, “What a touching display of sisterhood, but too bad…”

With a loud thud, Yang Kai sent Yue flying several dozen metres with a kick, sending her crashing into the ground as she spurted blood from her mouth.

“This is Madam Sha Ya’s first order, so I have to obey it!” Yang Kai grasped Lu’s slender neck as he declared and slowly lifted her up.

Lu struggled hard, her face turning red, but she couldn’t shake off Yang Kai’s grip with just her physical strength. The struggle she displayed with her hands and feet only made her look more miserable in the end.

“Let…” Yue choked on her blood as she shouted, “Let her go!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Struggling to her feet, she screamed and tried to rush back but was firmly subdued by a black shadow at that moment.

Yang Kai’s grip on Lu’s neck tightened and his Shaman Strength began to surge, releasing an extremely dangerous aura.

Perhaps due to their Heart Resonance, the struggling Lu suddenly turned her head and looked at her Elder Sister, and Yue stared back in sorrow. Their eyes met, and Lu gently opened her mouth, but no sound came out.

Yue knew that she was saying goodbye.

“No!!” Yue shrieked desperately.

*Peng… *

A mass of blood suddenly burst out and Lu, who was lifted by Yang Kai, exploded directly in his hand, leaving not even bones behind, only a mist of blood and minced flesh that sprinkled down to the ground.

Yue’s scream suddenly ceased as her whole body froze, as if she had just lost her Soul. She stared at the blood mist covering the sky, and could not believe that her Little Sister, who was still close to her just a moment ago, had met such a miserable end.

Two streaks of tears fell silently from the corners of her eyes. She did not cry out loud, but her eyes became piercingly cold, glaring at Yang Kai with unforgivable hatred. If possible, she would bite Shaman Niu to death, feast on his flesh, drink his blood, gnaw his bones to devour every last trace of him!

“Hahahaha!” Sha Ya suddenly burst into a frenzied laugh, her whole body trembling, looking extremely elated. It was as if the scene that just happened in front of her gave unprecedented satisfaction.

Yang Kai ignored Yue’s resentful gaze and turned to Sha Ya, “Madam, is this sincerity enough?”

“Enough!” Sha Ya nodded with satisfaction.

Now, she truly believed that Yang Kai was sincere about surrendering to her.

“Come!” Sha Ya called, as if summoning a pet.

Yang Kai walked up to her and stood in front of her.

“Kneel down!” Sha Ya ordered again.

Yang Kai frowned, and shook his head, “Sorry, my legs hurt, so I can’t kneel down!”

The smile on Sha Ya’s face immediately disappeared and she looked coldly at Yang Kai, “How dare you disobey my orders. Do you want to die?”

Yang Kai replied faintly, “There are some things you can abandon in life, but some things must be insisted upon. Madam, you are a woman, and you don’t understand the pride and perseverance of a man.”

Sha Ya curled her lip, “Ridiculous. You can even kill your own subordinate, but you can’t kneel to me?”

Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders, “I’d rather die!”

They exchanged looks, with Yang Kai staring back steadily at Sha Ya, a lofty and imposing aura exuding from his being.

After a long stare, Sha Ya curled her lip again. She found that this Shaman Grandmaster was a man who meant every word he said, and such stubborn perseverance did not annoy her and instead actually made her a little excited.

Only by taming such a rebellious slave could she have a sense of achievement.

“Good, since you have proved your sincerity, it’s my turn.”

Saying so, Sha Ya approached Yang Kai gracefully and gently tapped her finger on his forehead.

A black Ancient Demon Qi suddenly flowed out of Sha Ya’s fingertip.

The nature of this Ancient Demon Qi was similar to that encountered by the Shaman Niu Clan in the abandoned village, but there were some key differences. When comparing, Sha Ya’s Demon Qi was undoubtedly stronger, purer, and more invasive.

After forcing out her Ancient Demon Qi, Sha Ya’s face suddenly showed a trace of fatigue. This procedure obviously took a great toll on her.

The Ancient Demon Qi was like a living creature, and after circling around Sha Ya’s fingertip several times, it seeped into Yang Kai’s body.

Yang Kai grunted and took two steps back.

A faint black tinge immediately permeated around his body. The black tinge was like a burning flame, burning away all the Green Demon Poison wherever it passed.

The green radiance disappeared and was replaced by a strange and heavy darkness.

“Is it done?” Yang Kai frowned.

Sha Ya lightly smiled, “You are now a member of the Demon Clan. Even if you can withstand my Demon Qi without dying, you still need something more to become my slave.”

Yang Kai responded, “I am willing to serve Madam.”

“Very good,” Sha Ya nodded with satisfaction.

Next, Sha Ya opened my mouth and spat out something about the size of a fist.

Yue, who had been watching coldly from the side, narrowed her eyes at this moment because this thing looked exactly like a heart. A black heart that was even now beating rhythmically.

Sha Ya held this heart in her hand, and with each beat it made, a strange power was released from it, giving one who heard and felt it a sense of uneasiness and dizziness.

Yang Kai looked at this heart with relish.

Sha Ya smiled faintly and explained, “This is my Demon Heart.”

“Is it okay for Madam to take it out like this?” Yang Kai asked with concern, “Won’t it have any impact on you?”

Sha Ya replied with a chuckle, “For us Demons, every Master who achieves success in cultivation has their own Demon Heart, and as long as the Demon Heart remains, the Demon Race will not die! Didn’t your ancestors tell you about this?”

Yang Kai answered, “This is my first time hearing of it.”

Staring at the Demon Heart with hot light, Yang Kai continued, “In other words, this thing is your foundation?”

“That’s right,” Sha Ya nodded slightly.

“Can I take a look?” Yang Kai observed the Demon Heart curiously.

Sha Ya looked up with a meaningful gaze, as if she was wondering if he just asked the question casually, or he had some sort of scheme planned.

Yue suddenly held her breath, nervously.
