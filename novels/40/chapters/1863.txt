“What? An Origin King Pill?”

“It couldn’t be?”

“This Sir actually has an Origin King Pill in his hands?”

As soon as Li Nuo’s voice fell, the cultivators in the hall erupted, all of them stretched their necks to try to get a better look at the stage, their eyes seemingly trying to penetrate the jade bottle to see whether there was really an Origin King Pill inside or not.

Li Nuo knew that further words would be pointless so she quickly poured out the contents of the jade bottle.

In an instant, a rich pill fragrance filled the hall.

When the original Origin King Pill was taken out, everyone had smelled its unique fragrance, so after smelling it again so soon, everyone was able to conclude this new pill was an Origin King Pill.

If there was any difference, it was that this pill fragrance... seemed to be more intense.

“Look, isn’t this Origin King Pill slightly bigger than the one from just now? Could its quality be better?”

“Nonsense, how can you judge the quality of a Spirit Pill by its size... however, judging from the colour and richness of its scent, it does seem higher quality than the one from earlier.”

“Isn’t that what I just said?”

“Uh... in a sense.”

The cultivators on the auction house floor endlessly called out while, in Room A2, Zi Wu Ji’s eyes were glued to the Origin King Pill on the stage, joy nearly bursting from his heart.

The Origin King Pill that was auctioned off before was snatched from him by Gong Sun Liang, causing him to feel helpless and annoyed, but just when he thought he had missed this opportunity, Yang Kai had unexpectedly taken out another Origin King Pill, one of even higher quality at that.

How could Zi Wu Ji not be pleasantly surprised?

No matter what, he needed to find a way to obtain this Origin King Pill. With the help of this Spirit Pill, he could attempt to break through to the Origin King Realm as long as he could prepare appropriately!

Once he succeeded, he would have a far stronger position with which to challenge Gong Sun Liang!

“How much is this King’s Spirit Pill worth?” Yang Kai’s voice floated out from his private room.

Li Nuo eyes flashed for a moment before she laughed lightly, “Because the Origin King Pill just now was sold at a price of one billion, this Origin King Pill is naturally worth such an amount in this Mistress’ eyes!”

Obviously, she was assisting Yang Kai.

A haze flashed across Gong Sun Liang’s eyes as he snorted coldly, “Lady Li Nuo, you should think clearly. This old master was willing to spend a billion to buy that Origin King Pill, but that does not mean it is really worth that price. If you intend to say it is worth a billion Saint Crystals, this old master will not agree.”

Li Nuo frowned and was about to say something when Zi Wu Ji’s voice suddenly came out, “Great Elder, don’t worry, this Wu Ji will purchase this Spirit Pill for a billion Saint Crystals.”

Although he did not have a billion Saint Crystals on him now, with his status and position, it would be fine to just give Li Nuo an IOU.

Li Nuo nodded lightly before turning to smile towards Gong Sun Liang, “Since that’s the case, does Great Elder still have any objections?”

“Hmph,” Gong Sun Liang just coldly snorted and quickly declared, “1.1 billion!”

“Great Elder, please send enough Saint Crystals or items of corresponding value to the stage to show fairness!” Zi Wu Ji needled loudly.

Gong Sun Liang said nothing as he sent a Space Ring from Room A1 towards the stage.

Li Nuo stretched out her hand, grabbed it, and began to investigate with a solemn expression.

Zi Wu Ji grinned lightly and said, “Please look carefully, Lady Li Nuo; after all, this is a huge number, not something that can be counted in a short time.”

As soon as this statement came out, many people could not help showing a thoughtful look and silently nodded to themselves. How could such a large number of Saint Crystals be counted at once? But when Li Nuo went to Room A1 to count Saint Crystals just now, she had confirmed the number instantly. Was there something nefarious afoot?

Great Elder could not have actually failed to pay the appropriate number of Saint Crystals, right? If that was the case, it would simply be going too far.

This time, Li Nuo counted for a full incense stick worth of time before smiling and declaring, “The number is confirmed, it is indeed 1.1 billion Saint Crystals!”

“Great Elder is indeed wealthy; this one is truly impressed!” Yang Kai smiled and acknowledged.

“If Your Excellency is unable to increase the price, this last auction item will belong to this old master,” Gong Sun Liang replied lightly.

Yang Kai just chuckled, stretched out his hand, and threw out an object from his private room to land in front of Li Nuo.

It was another jade bottle!

“A pill again?”

“Could it be another Origin King Pill?”

“Of course not, the Origin King Pill can only be refined by an Origin King Grade Alchemist, and its main ingredient is extremely scarce. It is a rare treasure one can only hope to see once in a lifetime, so how could another one possible appear today? This jade bottle must contain some other type of Spirit Pill.”

“That makes sense, but this Sir has an extraordinary background. I think the value of this new pill shouldn’t be any lower than that of an Origin King Pill.”

Everyone was immersed in discussion as they curiously speculated about the pill inside the jade bottle, wondering what kind of treasure Yang Kai had put out this time.

Li Nuo opened the jade bottle and glanced inside suspiciously, only to have her tender body shake noticeably as a look of pure shock appeared on her face as she shouted, “Another Origin King Pill!”

“What? It really is another Origin King Pill?”

“How many Origin King Pills does this Sir have in his hands!”

“Sir, do you want a servant? This old man has a peak Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation. If Sir is willing, this old man would like to offer Sir a lifetime of service!”

“Bullshit! Old Chen, you want to follow this Sir even at your age? You want that Origin King Pill that desperately? With your aptitude, even if you get an Origin King Pill, you can’t break through to the Origin King Realm. Giving it to you would only be a waste! Sir, please take a look at this Sun’s aptitude. This Sun is already a pinnacle Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator with solid Saint Qi and Shi just below the grand accomplishment stage. Please let this Sun offer his service to Sir!”

“Old Sun, you dare to slander this Chen’s reputation? This Chen will fight with you!”

“You two old fools, how could you think yourselves worthy of serving this Sir? Sir, this Mistress has a Special Constitution, and although it does not compare to the legendary Wonderful Furnace Divine Body, it is not far off. Is Sir interested in having a taste? Although this Mistress is only a small Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator now, she will definitely be able to break through to the Origin King Realm sooner or later. If Sir is willing to accept, this Mistress will offer herself as a maid or servant!”

“You whore, how many thousands of men have you been sullied by already? Do not dirty this Sir with your filth! Sir, please accept this Mistress as your servant, I promise I have never been touched by a man before and still retain my purity.”

“No, choose me! I know several boudoir arts that will definitely please Sir!”

The entire auction hall suddenly became as noisy as a hawkers market, with numerous Origin Returning Realm cultivators shouting in the direction of Room A5, everyone trying to promote themselves while some women even shamelessly tried to use seduction.

Yang Kai had taken out two Origin King Pills at once, so everyone could see how wealthy he was. If he could take out two so easily, there may be more. An Origin King Pill was a priceless treasure for any Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator and had a near-fatal temptation to them. If any of them could follow Yang Kai and obtain an Origin King Pill, a lifetime of service was really a cheap price to pay.

Inside the private room, Hua You Meng’s pretty face distorted as she watched a sea of women who had clearly been deflowered throwing coquettish glances towards the man next to her, her brow twitching from a mixture of disgust and disdain.

However, when she cast her beautiful eyes towards Yang Kai, even she could not help being somewhat tempted; after all, she was a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator as well!

On the stage, Li Nuo looked at the funny scene below with a wry smile, not knowing what she should do. She had hosted many auctions before, but she had never seen a situation like this.

Her limelight had actually been stolen by a bidder, but she didn’t complain, only feeling this was all... quite strange.

At the critical moment, Yang Kai coughed lightly and said, “Everyone’s sincerity, this King has noted, but this King has no intention of taking any followers. What’s more, these Origin King Pills were only obtained by this King by chance. There are only two, no more.”

Yang Kai really only had two. He had refined them himself on the floating continent in case he needed to take one during his breakthrough to the Origin King Realm, but his breakthrough had gone smoothly in the end so he no longer had a use for these Origin King Pills.

As soon as Yang Kai finished speaking, many cultivators showed looks of disappointment and besides a few people whose eyes still shone brightly, the rest sat down and no longer shouted.

Yang Kai then directed his attention to Li Nuo and asked, “How valuable is this Origin King Pill?”

Li Nuo said without hesitation, “Since the Origin King Pill just now was worth a billion, then this one is the same.”

Gong Sun Liang angrily snapped, “Can you find another person who is willing to spend a billion to buy it?”

Li Nuo suddenly showed a look of embarrassment. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Yang Kai let out a hearty laugh at this and said, “Lady Li Nuo does not need to make things awkward, just mark its value at 500 million.”

Li Nuo showed a look of gratitude and nodded, “Since Sir has said so, then 500 million it is. Does Great Elder have any objections?”

Gong Sun Liang coldly snorted in response.

Everyone knew the value of an Origin King Pill was between 500 to 600 million, with many people even willing to spend more than that. As such, an estimate of 500 million was actually quite low. With Yang Kai being so generous, if Gong Sun Liang still objected, he would only look petty.

Li Nuo smiled slightly, “This Sir from Room A5 has offered 1.5 billion. Does Great Elder want to increase the price?”

Inside Room A1, Gong Sun Liang’s eyes flashed with struggle.

Jiang Chang Feng whispered from the side at that moment, “Great Elder, what special use does that thing possess? Why are you and that person willing to bid such a large amount of money to win it?”

Gong Sun Liang just glanced at him, sneered, and said, “Nothing, we are competing for face.”

“Uh...” Jiang Chang Feng began to leak cold sweat, thinking that a battle over face could actually cost a billion Saint Crystals. These two were truly prodigal. After grumbling silently to himself, he followed up, “If that is the case, Great Elder should not fight with him anymore. This is Purple Star, does Great Elder need to worry about him not giving face?”

A gloomy light flashed across Gong Sun Liang’s eyes before he finally nodded and said, “Fine, this matter will stop here.”

Although he still had the ability to continue bidding, just looking at Yang Kai’s momentum, he wasn’t sure he would be the ultimate winner. As Jiang Chang Feng said, this was Purple Star, where he was the one in charge. What did it matter if he allowed the other party to have a small win for now?

Saying so, his figure actually flickered and he disappeared from the private room.
