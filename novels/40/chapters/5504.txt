Chapter 5505: Creation Realm

“Now that you understand, you should know the reason why I brought you here, so make a decision. Whether you stay here and guard this place for Cang, or leave this place and be free,” Yang Kai commented.

Wu Kuang glanced at the Azure Dragon Spear that Yang Kai was playing with and his brow twitched, “If I say no, are you going to stab me to death?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “How could I? Shi is Shi, and you are you. You are both separate individuals. Shi is one of the Martial Ancestors who guarded the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction every day with the world in mind. Even when he died, he did so for the Human Race. He is a true role model. You, on the other hand, are an infamous bandit. Your story is used as a lesson for misbehaving children in the Star Boundary. I can understand if you say you don’t want to stay. Considering that guarding this place is not a matter of a day or two but a matter of thousands or even tens of thousands of years! Not everyone can endure such solitude.”

Even as Yang Kai spoke such words though, the Azure Dragon Spear glinted an icy light.

Sneering, Wu Kuang said, “Stop speaking nonsense. It took you more than 10 years to bring me here. I’m afraid that if I say one wrong word, I’ll die on the spot.”

“You misunderstand me deeply,” Yang Kai stated firmly.

Yang Kai received a cold snort in response before Wu Kuang turned and glanced in the direction of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, “But, there is no need for you to threaten me. I will guard this place from now on!”

Yang Kai raised his brow, “This matter is not forced on you.”

Wu Kuang shook his head and said, “I’m not forced. If I did not want to, I would rather you kill me than stay. This is… my own choice.”

With a serious expression, Yang Kai retrieved the Azure Dragon Spear and lowered his head to Wu Kuang, “Senior is indeed kind and understanding. This Yang Kai would like to thank Senior on behalf of the 3,000 Worlds and Cang. If Mo can be destroyed in the future, much credit will belong to Senior!”

Wu Kuang snorted coldly at his words.

When Yang Kai did not need help from him, he would only address him by his name, now that he had needed help though, he was suddenly ‘Senior’. This Brat’s skin was just too thick.

Yang Kai added, “May I ask Senior, why are you willing to endure thousands of years of loneliness to guard the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction?”

Wu Kuang glanced at him, knowing that this Brat was still not assured about him; after all, everything was just a verbal promise at this point. When Yang Kai left, he would have the chance to leave this place; thus, he explained, “Rest assured. Though I am in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, I am still not strong enough. You know more about the characteristics of the Heaven Devouring Battle Law than anyone other than me. The Heaven Devouring Battle Law can help me to greatly enhance my cultivation, and in the vast Universe, there is no place I can benefit more from than this Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction.”

Yang Kai instantly understood, “You’re planning to devour the Black Ink Strength here?”

“The Black Ink Strength here is many times denser and purer than in any Black Ink Clansmen. If I can consume the Black Ink Strength here, it will be much more beneficial than killing a few Feudal Lords outside,” Wu Kuang laughed wickedly.

“Senior, you’re indeed wise.”

“Don’t pat my ass, it’s pointless.”

Yang Kai continued, “Although Mo is now in a deep slumber, I don’t know when it will awaken. Senior is currently only in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, are you even strong enough to guard the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction?”

This was a legitimate concern. It was possible that Wu Kuang, who was currently in the Seventh Order, wouldn’t be able to exert even 1% of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction’s power. In which case, he might not be able to restrict Mo.

Wu Kuang gushed with pride, “Within 3,000 years, this King can ascend to the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm. As long as Mo does not wake up before then, there will be no problem.”

Nobody else in this world except for Wu Kuang dared to boast about being able to cross from the Seventh Order to the Ninth Order in a mere 3,000 years.

It was, however, true that Wu Kuang, who cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, could borrow the power of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction to rapidly enhance his strength. This was something he was absolutely confident about.

Once Wu Kuang really ascended to the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm, he would be able to somewhat control the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction; after all, he was not any ordinary Master but the reincarnation of Shi. He and his nine old friends created the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, so naturally, he was more familiar with this place than anyone else currently alive.

Still, 3,000 years was a steep hurdle to vault.

If Wu Kuang found it hard, what more needs to be said about the entire Human Race?

After 3,000 years, even if Wu Kuang ascended to the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm and completely took control of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, there was still no way to resolve Mo if the Human Race did not have sufficient strength to fight back and did not find the Primordial Light.

Yang Kai nodded and said, “Then, I hope Senior’s path in the great Martial Dao is as you wish.”

“About the Primordial Light…” Wu Kuang frowned, “Did you ask the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer already?

Previously, when he asked about the Primordial Light, all Yang Kai said was that searching for it wasn’t his concern.

But, now that Wu Kuang obtained that part of Shi’s Soul, and recalling his current life’s experiences, it was no surprise that Wu Kuang guessed that the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer had some relationship with the Primordial Light.

“I did.”

“What did they say?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “They couldn’t explain it clearly. Right now, the only thing that can be said with certainty is that those two do indeed have some connection to the Primordial Light. They might be a part of it but were separated from it somehow. They even did as I asked and tried to fuse together, but it was to no avail. We are still missing a key component.”

Wu Kuang frowned.

The key was missing. If they couldn’t find out what the one missing key was, they would never be able to locate the Primordial Light.

Turning his head to look in the direction of Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, Wu Kuang paused and said, “Do you know why Shi took the risk of reincarnation when he hadn’t reached his predestined time of death? If he hadn’t done so, with the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, he would still have been able to live on for many years, yet he chose to give that all up.”

Yang Kai instantly felt more energised. Despite hearing many ancient secrets from Cang, he had never personally lived during that period. He had a slight feeling that he might have learned a big secret when Wu Kuang asked this out of the blue.

Immediately, he replied seriously, “Senior, please enlighten me.”

“To eliminate Mo, finding the Primordial Light is one way. It was just that Shi sensed that the Primordial Light might not be able to be found, so we could only try the second option.” He turned to look at Yang Kai and said in a deeper voice, “To reach the same realm as Mo or surpass it, and crush it with absolute power.”

Yang Kai was shocked, “What realm is Mo in?”

“Mo possesses the power of Creation, so it is in the Creation Realm. This realm is also the realm that Shi and the other nine had been pursuing, but it is a pity that none were able to achieve it.”

A little distracted, Yang Kai muttered, “The Creation Realm!”

He still remembered that when he and the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Old Ancestors visited Cang, they enquired about that realm from him. Cang only chuckled and claimed that he was only in the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm, just further along that path than others.

At that time, Yang Kai vaguely guessed that there might be a higher realm above the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

His guess was now confirmed by Wu Kuang. There was indeed a realm above the Ninth-Order Realm, which was the Creation Realm! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Being in the Creation Realm, Mo could create Royal Lords, Territory Lords and even Black Ink Giant Spirit Gods. This was the might of the Creation Realm.

“Back when Mu dove deep into the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, she witnessed Mo use hints of power that should only belong to the Creation Realm. Through that, she knew that its breakthrough to the Creation Realm was just a matter of time. Due to the characteristics of Black Ink Strength, Mo was born with an innate advantage. So, not long after she returned from inside the Grand Restriction, she sacrificed her life to the restriction to fortify it, leaving behind one last trump card for Cang to play, which must be the reason why Mo is in deep sleep right now,” Wu Kuang recalled the past while seemingly sifting through his new memories.

“Although Mu was an unparalleled talent, she was still a woman, which made her hesitate and act more conservatively. That trump card she left behind can only temporarily keep Mo in check. It is unable to resolve the issue entirely. Compared to her, Shi chose another approach.”

“To reincarnate?” Yang Kai slightly lifted his brow.

Wu Kuang gave a nod, “Shi and the other nine used the power of the World Tree to reach the Open Heaven Realm, but it was also due to this that they couldn’t go beyond the Open Heaven Realm. No matter how high they climbed, they would never surmount the Ninth Order. One needs other means to break this shackle, so Shi chose to reincarnate, hoping to find a way to break through the Ninth Order in his next life.”

“Is there any chance for Senior to do so now?” Yang Kai inquired.

Wu Kuang smiled and said, “The Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters have consistently been the most powerful Supreme Masters of the Human Race since ancient times. The Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm is the limit. Not to mention, I’m only in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm at the moment, making such a breakthrough even more challenging.”

After hesitating for a moment, he continued, “Maybe I will discover more when I reach the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm, but for now, my cultivation is just too low.”

Yang Kai was aware that this situation could not be rushed, but finding a way to surpass the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm was indeed another option.

The Creation Realm.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but yearn for it.

Then again, he remembered that the Eighth Order was his limit in this life. To want to break through to the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm was already close to impossible, not to mention reaching the Creation Realm.

Wu Kuang seemed to have noticed what was going on in his mind, so he turned and asked, “You have already reached your limit as an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Stop thinking about other nonsense.”

With a trace of Shi’s Soul, Wu Kuang gained quite a bit of a Senior demeanour.

Yang Kai only smiled in response, “There’s always hope.”

“The Universe Furnace?” Wu Kuang sneered, “Innate Open Heaven Pills from the Universe Furnace can indeed help you break through that barrier, but the Universe Furnace is the most mysterious entity in the Universe. Nobody knows when it will appear. Let’s say it does appear one day, do you think you’ll have a place among all the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters from all the Cave Heavens and Paradises? Do keep in mind that the number of Open Heaven Pills that a furnace produces is limited.”

Yang Kai thought secretly in his heart, [If the Universe Furnace shows up one day, and the Human Race manages to obtain its Innate Open Heaven Pills, I should be able to take some for my breakthrough; after all, I have always fought with those above my realm. To allow me to ascend to the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm is a better choice than any other.]

The only issue was that the Universe Furnace was nowhere to be found, and no one knew when or where it would appear.

“Other than the Universe Furnace, there is actually another way,” Wu Kuang smirked.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up and he immediately bowed again, “Senior, please enlighten me once more!”
