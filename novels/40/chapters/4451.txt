The status of Pei Wen Xuan in Myriad Demons Heaven was the same as Qu Hua Shang in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. Such a person was destined to be one of the most important figures in Myriad Demons Heaven in the future, so there was no way he would marry into Yin-Yang Cave Heaven; otherwise, it would be a huge loss for his Sect.

Therefore, when the two disciples, who were responsible for registering the candidates, heard that Elder He was making a registration for Pei Wen Xuan to take part in the Dao Theory Assembly, they were dumbfounded.

“Cut the crap! Do it now and give me a Jade Token!” Elder He snapped.

“Yes, yes, yes. Please give us a moment, Elder He!” Not daring to be negligent, the two disciples hurriedly recorded Pei Wen Xuan’s information and passed the elderly man a Jade Token.

Not willing to stay there any longer, Elder He took the token and left while the two disciples exchanged glances in puzzlement.

Before they even recovered from their shock, more people had come to make a registration.

…

Half a day later, the two disciples fell into a dazed state as they looked at the book in front of them.

In such a short time, more than ten Cave Heavens and Paradises had sent new disciples to take part in the Dao Theory Assembly, and they were all in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. Just like Pei Wen Xuan, they were rising stars of their respective Sects who achieved an ascension in the past one hundred years.

The two disciples were torn between tears and laughter because there was even a woman on the list.

The words ‘Lang Ya Paradise, Gu Pan, Sixth-Order’ were clearly written in the book.

The purpose of the Dao Theory Assembly was to help Qu Hua Shang find a Husband, so the participants were naturally all men. Something had to be terribly wrong with Lang Ya Paradise as they had sent a female disciple. If Gu Pan happened to become the winner, she would have to bed Qu Hua Shang in the future.

The two disciples felt their blood beginning to boil as they began to imagine such a future.

Although they had no idea what had happened that made these new Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realms change their minds and take part in the Dao Theory Assembly, they could clearly feel that a change was taking place in the assembly.

Their gazes fell upon a certain name as they had a feeling that the change had something to do with that person; after all, prior to this, he was the only Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm among the hundreds of participants in the assembly.

On Intertwining Fate Peak, Yang Kai examined Kong Tian Yu’s Space Ring and obtained some Fifth-Order materials from it. Other than that, there was nothing worth mentioning.

As the Lord of Void Land, Yang Kai had a First Class Star City and countless powerful Open Heaven Realms as subordinates. Given his wealth, he was naturally dismissive of ordinary treasures. After putting everything of value in his own ring, he continued refining Open Heaven Pills.

Soon however, the barrier around his house was triggered. Instead of a violent fluctuation this time though, it felt more like someone was simply trying to get his attention.

With a frown, Yang Kai got up and lowered the barrier. After pushing the door open, he saw a decent-looking young man standing outside. Seeing Yang Kai, the young man quickly saluted him, Gathering Yuan Union’s Lu Jing greets Senior Brother!”

Yang Kai sized him up and asked, “What’s wrong?”

He remembered seeing Gathering Yuan Union in his Universe Chart, which included all the known Great Territories and great forces within them. When he was looking for the Star Boundary in the past, Yang Kai had carefully studied every part of the Universe Chart, so he vaguely remembered a force called Gathering Yuan Union.

However, he didn’t pay any attention to this force since he probably wouldn’t come into contact with them.

If he wasn’t mistaken, Gathering Yuan Union was above average among the Second Class great forces, with a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master overseeing their Sect.

“I’m sorry for bothering you, Senior Brother.” Lu Jing cautiously examined Yang Kai’s expression, and upon seeing that the latter didn’t show signs of impatience, he set his mind at ease. He was shocked to see Kong Tian Yu getting killed in just one move a short time ago. That guy was a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, but he was killed like an ant. Therefore, Lu Jing was terrified when dealing with Yang Kai as he was worried that the latter would make a move on him at any moment.

The participants of the Dao Theory Assembly had to understand that they might get killed at any moment; hence, Yang Kai could murder all the people on Intertwining Fate Peak if he wanted to do that.

“If you don’t mind, can I come in to speak with you?” Lu Jing asked in a gentle tone.

After giving it a thought, Yang Kai stepped aside. Lu Jing thanked him and shuffled into the house.

After they were seated, Lu Jing said, “I’ve heard much about you, Senior Brother. Now that I finally see you…”

Before he could finish his flattery, Yang Kai raised his hand and cut him off, “Just speak frankly.” Since it was the first time they met, there was nothing worth talking about between them and the only reason Yang Kai let him in was to find out his intentions.

An embarrassed Lu Jing coughed and put on a hollow laugh, “Good, Senior Brother Yang, the reason I’ve come to visit you is to ask you to protect me in the Dao Theory Assembly to the best of your abilities.”

Yang Kai frowned and gazed at him in puzzlement.

Lu Jing put on a bitter smile, “As you can see, Senior Brother, I’m just a Fourth-Order cultivator, one of the weakest among the participants in the Dao Theory Assembly. If I encounter a powerful opponent, there’s no way I can survive.”

With an awkward expression, Yang Kai asked, “Since you’re aware of your weaknesses, why have you still come here to take part in the assembly?”

A troubled Lu Jing replied, “Do you think I want to be here, Senior Brother? I had no choice. Although the purpose of the Dao Theory Assembly is to help Senior Sister Qu select a Husband, it is also a major event in the 3,000 Worlds. My Father told me to take part in it to broaden my horizons and gain some life experience. He doesn’t expect me to become the winner. To be honest with you, many participants of the assembly are in the same situation as me.”

“They’re forced to come here by their families?” Yang Kai was surprised.

Lu Jing replied, “Well, not all of them. There are only a small number of people who are forced to come here by their families. What I mean is that they’re taking part in the assembly not to become the winner but to go through some training by using this event as an opportunity.”

Upon hearing his explanation, Yang Kai nodded his head. After giving it a thought, he realised that it was just like what Lu Jing had said. The Dao Theory Assembly was considered a major event in the 3,000 Worlds. Many powerful cultivators had gathered together in this place to exchange moves, which was a kind of training for them.

Then, Yang Kai said with a frown, “It will be difficult for me to ensure your safety. What I can do at most is to let you off when you’re faced with me. The others might not be as easy-going though.”

Upon hearing that, Lu Jing burst into laughter, “Do you think the assembly is just an event where all the participants have to fight with one another until the strongest one emerges?”

“Isn’t that the case?” Yang Kai was shocked.

Lu Jing explained, “There might be such an event in the final stage; however, from what I’ve gathered, the assembly isn’t so simple. There must be other arrangements; however, I’m unable to find out how the assembly would be carried out.” He paused for a moment, “Why do you think those from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven want us to stay on different Spirit Peaks?”

Yang Kai replied, “Of course it’s to allow the stronger cultivators to weed out weaker opponents in advance to simplify the situation.”

“That might be one of the reasons; however, it’s also possible that they want us to familiarise ourselves with one another and find our own companions so that we can face various challenges together.”

A glint flashed through Yang Kai’s eyes when he heard that. Was it really the intention of those from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven for making such an arrangement? Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Lu Jing went on to say, “The Dao Theory Assembly is to help Senior Sister Qu select a Husband, so it would be too straightforward if they just wanted to select the strongest cultivator. In that case, there would be no need for a competition at all, we would just have to stand in a row and let the High-Rank Open Heaven Realms examine us to select a winner. However, how do they examine the winner’s temperament and personality? Only by going through different tests could the participants showcase their capabilities in different areas.”

Yang Kai reckoned that Lu Jing had a point.

“Therefore, I think that the Dao Theory Assembly isn’t just about fighting against one another. There must be more to it!” Lu Jing’s eyes seemed to be glowing as though he was confident that his speculation was right. Then, he turned to look at Yang Kai, “Hence, I hope you’ll ensure my safety to the best of your abilities, Senior Brother.”

Yang Kai stroked his chin and said frankly, “If the assembly is just like what you’ve said, I can take care of you to some extent; however, what can you give me?”

Lu Jing was startled as he hadn’t expected Yang Kai to agree so easily. The speech he had prepared in advance now became completely useless, so he simply asked dazedly, “What do you want, Senior Brother?”

The way Yang Kai gazed at him made him shrink back.

...

“If I’m not mistaken, Gathering Yuan Union focuses on doing business. Your ships sail everywhere in the 3,000 Worlds, and your Sect is quite wealthy. Since you’re able to represent Gathering Yuan Union to take part in the assembly when you’re just in the Fourth-Order, you’re obviously an important figure in your Sect.”

“Say no more, Senior Brother. I’m willing to pay you a Sixth-Order Yang Element treasure as a reward. What do you think?” Lu Jing interrupted Yang Kai as he was worried that the latter would come up with some unreasonable demands.

“Deal!” Yang Kai replied without hesitation.

Lu Jing breathed a sigh of relief and cupped his fists, “I’ll be relying on you then, Senior Brother. After the Dao Theory Assembly ends, I’ll pass you the reward.”

Yang Kai nodded, and after they chatted for a bit more, Lu Jing left.

Upon activating the Array again, Yang Kai returned to his room and fell silent.

A Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was able to directly offer a Sixth-Order Yang Element material, which went to show that Gathering Yuan Union was truly wealthy. It had to be noted that a Sixth-Order material was worth 10 to 20 million Open Heaven Pills, with Yin and Yang Element treasures being even more expensive than that.

Therefore, it was apparent that Lu Jing was an important figure in Gathering Yuan Union. Perhaps he was the Young Union Master, which was why he could offer such a handsome reward so easily.

If there were indeed other arrangements in the Dao Theory Assembly just like what Lu Jing had speculated, Yang Kai wouldn’t mind protecting him as long as he was capable of doing so.

There was a serious lack of Sixth-Order materials in Void Land. Besides the Great Emperors, Su Yan, and his other wives, Yang Kai also needed Sixth-Order materials now. Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters like Yue He and the others also needed Sixth-Order materials to cultivate efficiently.

Although he had a First Class Star City where he could obtain Sixth-Order materials from time to time, Yin and Yang Element materials were still extremely rare.

...

Lu Jing was clearly a seasoned person, so he knew that other rewards might not be able to move Yang Kai. As such, he directly offered a reward that Yang Kai would not be able to turn down.

Everything was peaceful for the next few days.

When Kong Tian Yu was on Intertwining Fate Peak previously, the place was lively as the residents would exchange pointers from time to time. However, after he was killed by Yang Kai with only one move, the entire Spirit Peak fell into a dead silence. The dozen or so people living here all hid in their resting places to cultivate while keeping their defensive Arrays activated, worried that Yang Kai would storm into their places and kill them all in advance.

After all, a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was essentially unmatched on the Spirit Peak.
