The cultivators gathered in the hall were constantly making toasts, and Yang Kai did not refuse any of them. With a gentle smile and a calm expression, he had created a particularly good impression of himself after exchanging drinks with everyone.

From time to time, he would chat and laugh with Gu Jian Xin while occasionally glancing at the beautiful dancers.

Time flew by, the wine flowed freely, and the atmosphere in the hall became more and more lively.

Most cultivators were bold and unrestrained people, so this kind of free banquet naturally became a good place for them to let down their guard and express themselves. The cultivators who followed Gu Jian Xin each drank and laughed heartily.

Although Gu Jian Xin drank a lot, he never became drunk. During this time, he was observing Yang Kai.

A dazzling star like Yang Kai suddenly appearing in the Star Field naturally drew Gu Jian Xin’s curiosity, and he naturally wanted to use this banquet to try to learn some more about him.

To his disappointment though, Gu Jian Xin was not able to learn much.

When Yang Kai looked at the young women below who were dancing and singing, his vision remained clear without any obscene desire, and when he drank and chatted with his subordinates, he always behaved following proper decorum.

All in all, Yang Kai was mysterious, but worth making friends with.

After drinking three rounds, Gu Jian Xin suddenly said, “Brother Yang, this Gu has an awkward request to make. I wonder if you’d be willing to listen?”

As soon as this remark came out, the noise in the hall suddenly decreased and although the cultivators present seemed to be drinking and chatting amongst themselves, all of them undoubtedly heard Gu Jian Xin’s words and diverted part of their attention to listen.

“Brother Gu can speak frankly,” Yang Kai put down his glass and smiled lightly.

Yang Kai was actually somewhat surprised. Throughout the banquet, he had been looking for a suitable opportunity to discuss He Zao and He Mao’s situation with Gu Jian Xin, but before he could find one, Gu Jian Xin had spoken up first.

He wondered what this ‘awkward request’ would be.

“It’s like this,” Gu Jian Xin wore a solemn expression, “This Gu was ambushed by Old Dog Li and suffered great losses. Although Old Dog Li deserved his death, he was still one of my Sword Union’s Elders in the end, and the Soul Breaker Spear he wielded is a treasure my Sword Union spent countless materials and hired a renowned Origin King Grade Artifact Refiner to refine. Rather than Old Dog Li’s personal property, it is more appropriate to say it belongs to my Sword Union. Now that he is dead, however, it is this Gu’s responsibility to bring the Soul Breaker Spear back to the Home Star and inform the Union Master about what has transpired.”

Having said that, he looked at Yang Kai with some embarrassment. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Yang Kai immediately understood what he meant.

“Brother Gu wants to take back the Soul Breaker Spear?”

“En,” An awkward smile appeared on Gu Jian Xin’s face. “This Gu knows that this request is truly somewhat shameless. Since Old Dog Li was killed by Brother Yang, the Soul Breaker Spear should belong to you, but... without the Soul Breaker Spear, things will be difficult for this Gu upon his return, which is why I must ask for it back. Of course, this Gu guarantees he will compensate Brother Yang appropriately, so he does not suffer a loss in exchange for the Soul Breaker Spear. As for everything else Old Dog Li had on him, Brother Yang is free to keep them. Those things don’t belong to my Sword Union.”

“So that’s it,” Yang Kai gently nodded as he wore a look of contemplation.

Gu Jian Xin did not urge him and simply waited quietly.

Inside the hall, at some point silence had fallen as everyone paid full attention to what was happening at the head of the table.

After a while, Yang Kai nodded, “Good, the Soul Breaker Spear is an Origin King Grade artifact, and its value is not low. Brother Gu, if I return the Soul Breaker Spear to Sword Union, what compensation can I expect?”

“As long as the value does not exceed the value of the Soul Breaker Spear itself, this Gu will definitely acquire it for you!” Gu Jian Xin replied solemnly.

Yang Kai chuckled, “Since Brother Gu is so sincere, then this Yang will oblige. In any case, this artifact is of no use to me.”

He did not use a spear and there was no one among his close acquaintances who did, so Yang Kai didn’t feel much loss returning the Soul Breaker Spear.

Saying so, Yang Kai took the Soul Breaker Spear out of his Space Ring and placed it in front of Gu Jian Xin.

Gu Jian Xin gestured lightly, and the Left Sword Servant Ling Yue immediately stepped forward and collected this Origin King Grade artifact.

“For Brother Yang’s righteousness, this Gu is grateful. I wonder what kind of compensation Brother Yang wants in return? Although my Sword Union is not the strongest force in the Star Field, it is also not weak and possesses many rare cultivation resources and materials, pills and herbs. Even if Brother Yang wants some kind of profound Secret Art or Secret Technique, this Gu can find a way to acquire it for you!”

Yang Kai returning the Soul Breaker Spear without any hesitation was a great relief to Gu Jian Xin, so he was prepared to compensate him for his loss as much as possible.

Yang Kai smiled lightly and said, “There’s no need to rush this discussion of compensation, Brother Gu.”

“No rush?” Gu Jian Xin was taken aback.

“En, this Yang wants to ask: Who here is Senior Qin Wu Hui?”

*Shua Shua Shua...*

In the hall, almost everyone’s eyes turned towards a certain direction. Following these eyes, Yang Kai’s gaze landed on a thin old man wearing unremarkable grey robes who was sitting only a seat below Gu Jian Xin.

Being able to sit in such a position showed how high this man’s status was amongst this group.

Yang Kai suddenly calling his name caused Qin Wu Hui to show a puzzled look and he quickly stood up. Cupping his fists, this old man said, “This old master is Qin Wu Hui; there is no need for Young Master Yang to address this old master as Senior. What advice does Young Master Yang have?”

“Senior is too modest,” Yang Kai smiled. “Actually, I have something I wish to give Senior, and I hope you will not refuse!”

“You wish to give this old master something?” Qin Wu Hui was now completely confused.

He was certain he had never greeted or even met Yang Kai before today, and had no relationship with him, yet this young man suddenly wanted to give him something. Despite Qin Wu Hui’s vast knowledge and experience, Yang Kai’s actions left him baffled.

Before Qin Wu Hui could comprehend the situation though, Yang Kai tossed a jade bottle over to him.

There was no sign of any Saint Qi being used to send this jade bottle, so Qin Wu Hui simply caught it and asked in surprise, “Young Master Yang, this is...”

“Senior might as well open it,” Yang Kai smiled, “Naturally, you will know what is inside once you do.”

Qin Wu Hui furrowed his brow and turned his eyes towards Gu Jian Xin, but the latter just laughed loudly, “Since it was delivered to Elder Qin by Brother Yang, Elder Qin might as well take a look. This Young Master is also very curious about what Brother Yang is trying to peddle.”

Qin Wu Hui nodded and opened the bottle before everyone’s eyes before pouring out a pill onto his palm.

This pill was snow-white and only about the size of a bean, but when it appeared before his eyes, Qin Wu Hui’s suspicious expression suddenly became rosy, filled with surprise, excitement, and disbelief...

Immediately, he brought the pill to his nose, sniffed it carefully, and even licked it with his tongue.

He soon exclaimed, “This is... a Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill?”

“What?” Inside the hall, all the gathered cultivators called out in alarm as if an explosion had gone off, all of them gazing towards the pill in Qin Wu Hui’s hand in surprise before shifting to Yang Kai, seemingly eagerly waiting for him to answer.

Gu Jian Xin’s eyes flashed as well as he glanced towards Yang Kai thoughtfully and hesitantly asked, “Brother Yang, is this really a Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill?”

“Senior Qin’s vision is quite sharp; this is indeed a Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill!”

Receiving confirmation from Yang Kai, Qin Wu Hui was so excited that he almost jumped for joy.

Even Gu Jian Xin drew a deep breath and quickly said, “Brother Yang’s means are truly shocking!”

“It’s a mere pill,” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

“Young Master Yang, why would you...” Qin Wu Hui came back to his senses and held the jade bottle tightly in his hand as he looked towards Yang Kai with a puzzled expression, wondering why this unknown young man had suddenly given him this Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill.

“I heard that during a battle against a powerful opponent, Senior Qin’s son suffered a severe injury to his Soul. This Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill should be the appropriate medicine for this situation. Although I dare not say it is a miracle cure, if used in conjunction with appropriate treatment, it should be able to fully restore Young Lord Qin’s Soul over time,” Yang Kai looked at Qin Wu Hui with a smile.

Qin Wu Hui looked at Yang Kai with a face full of excitement.

What happened to Qin Qi Yang had become something of a heart demon to him, and he had been searching for a pill to treat his good-for-nothing son over the years. Unfortunately, even with his capabilities and Gu Jian Xin’s backing, Qin Wu Hui had been unsuccessful in his attempts so far.

Injuries to the Soul were far more difficult to treat than those to the body, and only some extremely special pills would be effective. If it was only a minor injury, things wouldn’t be quite so difficult, but Qin Qi Yang had been wounded so badly that he had degenerated into an idiot, which was a grave injury.

According to Qin Wu Hui’s research, there were only a few pills in existence that could completely heal this kind of injury, but most of those pills were extinct, with either their recipe having been lost to history or the materials required to refine them having disappeared.

The Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill was one such pill. Qin Wu Hui was able to recognize this pill immediately because he had been constantly searching through ancient books these past few years. He also knew that in order to refine this kind of pill, one needed to use the Monster Core of a Seven Coloured Elk!

The Seven Coloured Elk was an ancient exotic Monster Beast that had long ago gone extinct in the Star Field; it was now impossible to find one anywhere.

Even if the Monster Core of a Seven Coloured Elk could somehow be found, it was also an essential component in refining treasures like the Ten Thousand Year Incense, so who would use it to refine a mere Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill?

Yet now, Yang Kai had suddenly taken one out!

Qin Wu Hui gripped the jade bottle tightly as his lips trembled, now knowing what to say.

“Brother Yang, I heard that this Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill is an ancient pill which can even enhance a cultivator’s comprehension and aptitude if taken. Is this true?” Gu Jian Xin suddenly asked.

Enhancing comprehension and aptitude would classify this pill as a Heaven defying treasure.

Generally speaking, qualities like aptitude and talent were innate and could not be changed by external forces unless one had some kind of extraordinary opportunity.

As such, after hearing Gu Jian Xin’s words, all the cultivators in the room were thoroughly shocked as they realized that the true value of this pill was actually far higher than the Origin King Grade Soul Breaker Spear!

An artifact was only an external tool and could not fundamentally change a cultivator’s ability like their aptitude or talent could. The more valuable item was obvious.
