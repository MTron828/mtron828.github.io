“Who is robbing you!? Obviously it was you who was attracted to me and tried to use the Star Source here to seduce me, and after you were rejected by me, you became angry out of shame and wanted to use force! Fortunately, I was prepared, otherwise, you would have surely succeeded,” Yu Ying aggrievedly cried, guarding herself in frustration as if Guan Qi had really done something wrong to her.

Guan Qi looked at Yu Ying with widened eyes as he rebuked in disbelief, “Do you know no shame?”

Yu Ying’s pretty face turned extremely gloomy as she lashed out, “You dare call me shameless!?”

Guan Qi angrily rebuked, “I discovered the Star Source here first and you wanted to snatch it! Why are you blaming others while you yourself are to be blamed.”

Suddenly, the two were locked in an endless quarrel, citing that the Star Source here was first discovered by them and the other party wanted to snatch it. They both repeated the same words but there was no evidence for either side, so there was no way to prove that what they were saying was indeed true.

Yang Kai indifferently stood on one side, sneering in his heart.

[If my guess is right, Guan Qi should have discovered the Star Source first and Yu Ying tried to snatch it.]

The reason was very simple. Since Guan Qi could come to the Shattered Star Sea, it meant his aptitude was pretty good in the Seeking Passion Sect. He could be regarded as an elite disciple, and as an elite, he must be cultivating the Seeking Passion Supreme Art.

This Secret Art of Seeking Passion Sect followed the Dao of Passion, so even if their elite disciples were a little lustful and each of them had countless wives and concubines, because of the characteristics of the Seeking Passion Supreme Art, they would never force themselves on a woman. When they wanted to get a woman, they would inevitably need to seduce and win her over, so the other party fell in love with them.

Yu Ying stated that Guan Qi had lusted for her, which was obviously nonsense.

If Yang Kai hadn’t dealt with the Seeking Passion Sect in the Northern Territory, he wouldn’t have been aware of this particular detail.

But then again, neither of these two were good people. They were fighting like dogs, biting each other.

The two quarrelled for a while before Yu Ying shook Yang Kai’s arm and sweetly whispered, “Senior Brother Feng, this person is bullying me. You have to do something on my behalf!”

By the looks of her stance, she really wanted to rely on Yang Kai’s strength to wear the lion’s skin.

Yang Kai didn’t want to watch it anymore, so he let out a cold snort and stated directly, “Since you have offended my Junior Sister Yu, this matter can’t be forgotten.”

Guan Qi gritted his teeth and shouted in a low voice, glaring at Yang Kai, “What do you want? Friend, I have no past grudge or grievance with you, so don’t go too far!”

He was neither humble nor overbearing, catching Yang Kai by surprise. After pondering for a while, Yang Kai sneered and stated, “Fortunately, Junior Sister Yu didn’t suffer any injuries. Otherwise, this Feng would have already taken your life!”

Guan Qi relaxed after hearing this. From the looks of it, it seemed that Yang Kai wasn’t planning on making things too difficult for him. This surprised him as he had no idea what Yang Kai wanted.

In this damned place, a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master had plenty of reasons and the ability to kill him. And to top it off, any conflicts at this point would mean a death in vain.

“Who said I’m not hurt? My heart is deeply wounded. If you don’t believe it, Senior Brother, you examine it for yourself,” Yu Ying whispered in a tender voice and while speaking, she pushed her ‘heart’ before Yang Kai, as though saying ‘I’m all yours’.

Black lines appeared on Yang Kai’s face as he stated, “There is someone here…”

Yu Ying giggled and said, “Senior Brother Feng, you are really interesting.”

She thought that Yang Kai had thin skin and was embarrassed to have excessive contact in front of others.

Yang Kai quickly changed the subject and shouted at Guan Qi, “Let’s do it like this, you will have to leave something behind and I’ll let you go!”

“What!?” Guan Qi’s face changed as he cried in shock. If Yang Kai’s request wasn’t excessive, he might agree, but if it’s too excessive, even if he had to put his life on the line, he would not let Yang Kai have his way.

“Leave your Space Ring as compensation for my Junior Sister Yu,” Yang Kai stated coldly.

Yu Ying was a little unhappy because Yang Kai said that he was going to let Guan Qi off, but when she heard the next sentence, she immediately raised her brows in glee and looked at Yang Kai in gratitude.

Guan Qi pondered for a moment in silence. He seemed to have also realized that he was currently a fish on the chopping board that couldn’t resist at all, so he reluctantly removed his Space Ring and threw it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai casually took it, secretly inspected it with his Divine Sense to make sure that there was nothing in it that he was interested in, before gifting it to Yu Ying.

“Can this Guan go now?” Guan Qi anxiously asked.

“Scram!” Yang Kai fiercely shouted.

Guan Qi bitterly glanced at Yang Kai and Yu Ying, as if he wanted to burn the image of this shameless couple in the depths of his mind. Only then did he use some kind of Secret Technique to flee at a very fast speed.

“Senior Brother Feng, if you make a move now, you can definitely catch him by surprise!” Yu Ying whispered in Yang Kai’s ear while secretly circulating her Source Qi, preparing to make her move at any moment.

[She is truly vicious!] Yang Kai was secretly shocked. Even now, she didn’t plan to let Guan Qi go. She wanted to take his life. Presumably, if not for her being uncertain if she would succeed, she would have already acted.

She wanted to use Yang Kai’s strength to kill Guan Qi.

But much to her disappointment, from the start of Guan Qi’s departure, Yang Kai had no intention of making a move. Yu Ying was a little dissatisfied by this and knit her brow, secretly thinking that this Senior Brother surnamed Feng was a little too kind.

[That Guan Qi had a five-pointed Star Seal. If I could have killed him and stole his Star Seal, then my Star Seal would have upgraded. I missed this huge opportunity for nothing!] Yu Ying’s joy of getting Guan Qi’s Space Ring had diminished a lot.

“The disciples of the Seeking Passion Sect aren’t good to provoke, he might have some card up his sleeve. Once he was forced to use that card, we might not be able to retreat scot-free,” Yang Kai indifferently explained.

In fact, he just didn’t want to be used by Yu Ying. If he had met Guan Qi alone, the result might not have been the same.

“I guess, you are right,” Yu Ying approvingly nodded before continuing with a smile, “Senior Brother Feng is quite thorough.”

After a pause, she asked, “Senior Brother Feng, about that ring…”

Although Yang Kai had just mentioned that the ring was meant as compensation for her loss, it was Yang Kai who had robbed it, so at this moment, she had to ask for his opinion.

“Junior Sister, take it as my gift to you,” Yang Kai slightly smiled.

Yu Ying beamed with joy as she put the ring away and stated, “Senior Brother Feng, you are so good!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Yang Kai smiled and continued, “Senior Brother is just gifting at the expense of others, so Junior Sister doesn’t need to care.” He then quickly changed the subject, “Right, I haven’t seen Senior Brother Yin for several years, why don’t we go look for him now?”

Deep down in his heart, he couldn’t wait to meet Yin Le Sheng and inquire about the whereabouts of Xiao Xiao. If it weren’t for this reason, why would he try to please Yu Ying and even more, tolerate her shamelessness?

“It’s not that simple to find Senior Brother Yin. Although we Netherworld Sect disciples cultivated a certain Secret Technique before we came to this place which allows us to sense each other from far away, the Shattered Star Sea is vast and we might not see each other until it closes. However, Senior Brother Feng, rest assured, even if we don’t find Senior Brother Ying, when you come to my Netherworld Sect in the future, you only need to report this Junior Sister’s name, and this Junior Sister will definitely welcome you in person.”

Yang Kai was struck with a chill when he heard this. If Yin Le Sheng wasn’t found, what would he do with Yu Ying?

Yu Ying added, “But it’s not like there is no hope. We are still in the periphery of the Shattered Star Sea. Senior Brother Yin must be heading towards the central region so we simply need to travel deeper before I can sense his position.”

“Then what are we waiting for? Let’s go!” Yang Kai anxiously proposed.

Yu Ying glanced at him and said, “Oh, Senior Brother Feng, you are really anxious. It is important to find Senior Brother Yin, but the Star Source here is not to be missed either.”

Yang Kai smacked his head and said, “Good, I almost forgot about this. Many thanks for Junior Sister Yu’s reminder.”

Yu Ying pursed her lips into a smile, “Senior Brother Feng is so cute.”

Yang Kai stated, “In that case, you and I should find a place to refine the Star Source here, and then we will go look for Senior Brother Yin.”

“Good!”

Next, the two moved separately, each looking for a safe location before they sat down cross-legged and started refining the Source Strength.

The Source Strength here wasn’t bad, enough for two ordinary Dao Source Realm cultivators to spend an entire month to completely absorb it.

Fortunately, the Shattered Star Sea remained open for quite some time, allowing cultivators to refine a lot of Source Strength despite it being a time-consuming process. If the duration was too short, the cultivators who entered here basically wouldn’t gain any benefits at all.

Yang Kai was anxious to find Yin Le Sheng though, so he directly used his Star Refining Art and in an instant, the Source Strength lingering about this asteroid swarmed toward him, transforming into specks of starlight that passed through his skin and merged with his body.

After two days, the Source Strength of the asteroid was completely refined.

This was the result of Yang Kai holding back. If he had gone all out, perhaps it wouldn’t have taken him half a day to absorb the Source Strength here.

Ninety-nine percent of the Star Source here was refined by Yang Kai, so Yu Ying ended up with a pitiful amount.

Two days later, the two reunited and Yu Ying looked at Yang Kai with a weird expression and asked, “Senior Brother Feng, why did the Source Strength here disappear so soon?”

“I don’t know either,” Yang Kai pretended to be ignorant. Yu Ying didn’t see him while he was circulating the Star Refining Art so there was no way for her to know anything.

Yu Ying stated, “I could feel it, all the Source Strength was converging toward Senior Brother Feng’s location. Senior Brother Feng, your refining speed is much faster than mine…” At this point, she seemed to have struck with realization and her countenance changed as she asked in a shaking voice, “Senior Brother Feng, you wouldn’t happen to be a Star Master?”

Yang Kai was stunned; however, he agreed with a nod, “En, I am also a Star Master of the Grand Desolation Star Field.”

Yu Ying couldn’t help but cover her cherry red lips with her soft hands as she looked at Yang Kai with excitement, as if she had seen some marvellous treasure, whispering in a low voice, “Senior Brother Feng, are you really a Star Master?”
