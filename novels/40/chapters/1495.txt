Chapter 1495, A Presumptuous Request

This Ancient Sect Ruins was located inside Fallen Emperor Mountain Range and covered a vast area. Yang Kai estimated that this Sect was not inferior to High Heaven Sect in size, and the aura inside its territory was also vibrant. Even if it was not quite as good as the current High Heaven Sect, it wasn’t far off.

Many great forces would likely struggle over this place in the future!

With such a good environment, those great forces would certainly not surrender it easily. If any power could claim this land as their headquarters, the benefits it brought to the future development of their force were immense.

Yang Kai already had High Heaven Sect, so he wasn’t concerned about this issue, but Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu were both filled with enthusiasm and had considered this idea.

Although Shadow Moon Hall’s headquarters was situated on an excellent piece of land, it was incredibly inferior to this place. Shadow Moon Hall was also only a few days away, so if they could move their Sect here, their disciples would be able to grow faster.

Even if they did not move their main headquarters to this location, it was entirely feasible to turn this place into a sub-headquarters.

As such, Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu were both excited, but thinking about the hardships and hindrances that would likely occur because of this place’s discovery, their enthusiasm died down significantly.

Such a cultivation paradise would not be ignored by Heaven Battling Union and Thunder Typhoon Sect, so in all likelihood, Shadow Moon Hall would not have any chance to lay claim to it.

The trio travelled deeper into the interior of this Ancient Sect Ruin and saw many grand palaces and pavilions which, despite being left idle for over ten thousand years, were still in almost pristine condition.

In their field of vision, many cultivators were already searching through these palaces, coming in and out, obviously exploring.

Yang Kai, Qian Tong, and Fei Zhi Tu exchanged a glance before immediately dispersing, each of them travelling to a different region to explore independently.

In the current situation, it was naturally more efficient to split up and search. Although the risk would increase a little, the three were not timid by any means so how could they act so restrained? There was not even a need for discussion before they made this decision.

After a while, Yang Kai walked out of a palace with a calm expression.

He had not gained anything. Although the palace was well-preserved, there was nothing of value inside.

This was also normal, and Yang Kai had expected it.

When he and the others were exploring High Heaven Sect for the first time, they had also not found much treasure left behind, so now Yang Kai was mentally prepared for this experience. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The cultivators who belonged to this ancient Sect may have taken away all their prized possessions before disaster befell them, so finding anything of worth remaining here was really a matter of luck.

Without pausing, Yang Kai quickly entered another palace.

At the same time, somewhere inside the Ancient Sect Ruins, a group of Origin Returning Realm masters gathered together led by a man in green robes and a man in blue robes. These two people were naturally Heaven Battling Union’s Union Master Qu Zheng and Thunder Typhoon Sect’s Sect Master Fang Peng.

At this moment, Qu Zheng held a communication artifact in his hand and poured his Divine Sense into it. After a while, he raised his head and said, “That little brat is ten kilometres west of here. Brother Fang, should we act now?”

Fang Peng pondered for a moment before asking, “Are Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu with him?”

“It seems they separated,” Qu Zheng replied, “But it doesn’t matter even if they are together. Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu wouldn’t even be able to block us for a moment.”

“Even if that’s true, those two belong to Shadow Moon Hall, if we really did something to them, Shadow Moon Hall would...” Fang Peng seemed a little hesitant.

“What thing is Shadow Moon Hall? Star Emperor Mountain is intervening in this matter personally. If Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu know what’s good for them, they would gladly back down, and if they don’t, hmph, Shadowed Star won’t mind another Sect disappearing.”

“Fair enough,” Fang Peng sneered, feeling that he was a bit too cautious.

“Father, since that kid has such a good relationship with Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, shouldn’t we capture them so we can force him to act cautiously, lest innocents are hurt?” From the crowd, a brave and heroic-looking young man with piercing eyes proposed. This young man was holding a folding fan and had his hair tied up with golden threads which emphasised his white skin, giving him a free and unrestrained appearance.

If Yang Kai was here, he would definitely recognise this young man as Heaven Battling Union’s Young Union Master Qu Chang Feng, a famous rising star on Shadowed Star.

Yang Kai had a bad impression of Heaven Battling Union, and the primary reason for this was Qu Chang Feng. This young man’s playboy style was quite repugnant, and he had even tried to kill Yang Kai inside the Flowing Flame Sand Field once.

Yang Kai naturally would not have a good impression of him.

“Oh?” Qu Zheng raised his brow, “Why should we try to capture Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu? Those two old dogs are Third-Order Origin Realm cultivators, two Minor Realms higher than that little brat. Wouldn’t targeting them be more trouble than simply targeting him?”

Fang Peng and others also turned to look at Qu Chang Feng, somewhat puzzled by his proposal.

Qu Chang Feng just chuckled though as he snapped his folding fan open and fanned himself lightly, “Although that might be the case, as far as I know, that boy seems to be able to use Space Force. We may have a lot of manpower with us, but if we can’t thoroughly block him from fleeing, he may still be able to escape.”

“That little brat uses Space Force? Where did he learn that from?” Qu Zheng and Fang Peng both looked surprised.

“I accidentally heard Great Elder speak of it. Father might as well ask Great Elder about this; he should know more than I,” Qu Chang Feng didn’t explain much and instead turned his eyes towards an old man among the crowd, Heaven Battling Union’s Great Elder Mo Xiao Sheng.

Suddenly becoming the focus of attention, Mo Xiao Sheng stepped forward and said with a solemn expression, “Exactly, it is as the Young Union Master said. That Yang Kai does indeed have some attainment in the Dao of Space. This Elder witnessed him use it during the battle on Dragon Cave Mountain that day! Others may not have been able to notice, but the truth couldn’t be hidden from this Elder’s eyes as he also cultivates Space Force.”

“He actually cultivates Space Force?” Qu Zheng frowned as he asked with surprise. As the Master of Heaven Battling Union, Qu Zheng understood how difficult it was for someone to comprehend the Dao of Space.

This had nothing to do with cultivation aptitude, the Dao of Space was an esoteric field that was extremely difficult even to begin comprehending and even harder to cultivate afterwards. Great Elder Mo Xiao Sheng wouldn’t have even been able to touch upon this field if he had not had a fortuitous encounter many years ago, but even after all this time, his accomplishments in the Dao of Space were still extremely shallow with no way to seemingly go any further as well.

“Great Elder, in your opinion, what kind of mastery does that little brat have of the Dao of Space?”

“He only used Space Force once in front of this Elder that day, so it’s not easy to judge, but he should be on par with this old master,” Mo Xiao Sheng’s mouth twitched slightly. Although he was very unwilling to acknowledge Yang Kai’s accomplishments in this field as equal to his own, Mo Xiao Sheng had no other choice. Yang Kai suddenly disappearing from in front of him that day was clearly the result of using Space Force, a feat he could only match, not best.

It was precisely because of his comprehension of the Dao of Space that Mo Xiao Sheng could occupy the position of Heaven Battling Union’s Great Elder. Otherwise, just considering the density and purity of his Saint Qi, along with the degree to which he had condensed his Shi, there were several other Elders in the Union who were superior to him.

This point showed just how profound and mysterious the Dao of Space was.

“If that’s the case, this might be a little difficult,” Qu Zheng frowned. From what he knew about the Great Elder’s means, Qu Zheng understood just how difficult it was to capture a cultivator who cultivated Space Force alive.

Yang Kai was a trivial First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator who no one here put in their eyes, but knowing what they did now, none of them had complete confidence that they could capture him.

Anyone who could use Space Force had an unmatched advantage in speed and mobility, which made their ability to escape and outrun pursuers extremely high.

“That said, if we capture Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, we really could add a layer of shackles to him,” Fang Peng pondered.

“Yes. Elder Liang, go monitor Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu. If you have an opportunity, capture them,” Qu Zheng ordered lightly, “If Shadow Moon Hall makes a fuss I’ll handle them.”

“Yes!” The Elder named Liang Yong, who let Yang Kai pass through before, immediately set off.

“Father, I have a presumptuous request!” Qu Chang Feng put away his folding fan and cupped his fists respectfully.

“Let’s hear it!” Qu Zheng doted on his son greatly so he would not dismiss him out of hand in front of so many people.

“If we really block off all of Yang Kai’s paths of retreat, please let me fight him!” Qu Chang Feng said solemnly.

“You?”

“Yes! During that battle on Battle of Dragon Cave Mountain, that boy made a big name for himself and is now being touted as the strongest of the younger generation. There are even rumours on Shadowed Star saying that his strength is not inferior to that of a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master. I, on the other hand, think this is nothing but an exaggeration, so I wish to challenge him and prove who the true leader of this generation is,” Qu Chang Feng declared proudly. After finishing saying so, he even turned his head to look at another young man who was wearing simple robes and asked with a smile, “Brother Tian Zhong, what do you think?”

This young man was none other than Fang Tian Zhong, another famous rising star whose status equalled Qu Chang Feng. During this joint operation between Heaven Battling Union and Thunder Typhoon Sect, both these extraordinary youths had tagged along.

With his arms still folded, Fang Tian Zhong heard Qu Chang Feng’s question and only raised his brow slightly before replying indifferently, “It’s all nothing but unwarranted rumours. How outsiders evaluate him has nothing to do with this Fang.”

“Really? Then why were you so eager to join this little hunt? Didn’t you want to see with your own eyes what Yang Kai’s strength was like and whether there was any disparity with yours?” Qu Chang Feng snickered and needled him with no trace of politeness, “This Qu is a man of action and came here simply to fight him. Since Brother Tian Zhong has no interest, this Qu will take the lead.”

“Do as you like!” Fang Tian Zhong snorted indifferently.

“Good, then it’s decided. Have our people monitor Yang Kai’s movements. When he enters a place where there are no outsiders, we will act. This mission was assigned to us by Star Emperor Mountain, so failure is not an option,” Qu Zheng was a decisive man so seeing that negotiations here were finished, he waved his hands and gave the command.

As for his son’s challenge to Yang Kai, he would not stop it. It was a good thing for his son to desire to compete.

Yang Kai was completely oblivious to these machinations and had no idea so many were monitoring and plotting against him at this moment.

Although this Ancient Sect Ruin was quite vast, there were many cultivators now combing it, and since Yang Kai did not want to stir up unnecessary conflict, he had purposefully chosen more remote locations to explore.
