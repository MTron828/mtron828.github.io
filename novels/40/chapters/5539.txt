Chapter 5540: Unavoidable Confrontation


 

Besides, they could not make a foolproof plan if they wanted to take down somebody like Yang Kai. On the contrary, they had to allow him to exploit so that he would take the risk of attack. If four Territory Lords were to openly work together, he would probably end up hiding without showing himself, which would only make things more difficult for the Black Ink Clan.

“What’s more,” Mo Na Ye continued, “The message from the Royal Lord indicates that Yang Kai is extremely proficient in escaping. His movements are elusive and unpredictable. Yang Kai managed to escape even though the Royal Lord himself gave pursuit. If you encounter him by accident, you must make sure to keep him pinned down at all costs. He must not be allowed to escape!”

The other four Territory Lords nodded, “Understood.”

The snake-tongued Territory Lord eagerly asked, “Mo Na Ye, are we going to tighten the noose now? The big fish has already taken the bait. There’s no need to wait any longer.”

Mo Na Ye was silent for a moment before he nodded, “We can seal off the Territory Gates now, but we should not rush to make a move. There are five other Territory Lords on the way right now and they should be arriving soon.”

The other four Territory Lords were stunned, with the winged Territory Lord asking, “Did you call for more reinforcements?”

There were five other Territory Lords on the way. Combined with the five Territory Lords that were already here, there would be 10 Territory Lords gathered in Acacia Territory alone! 10 Territory Lords against a single Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master… That was certainly a high valuation of their enemy.

“There’s nothing wrong with being cautious!” Mo Na Ye quickly said, “If we can get rid of Yang Kai once and for all, then the Royal Lord will definitely be pleased with our efforts. If a little extra help can accomplish that, why hesitate?”

Seeing as Mo Na Ye had brought up the Royal Lord as his reason, the other Territory Lords could not say anything to refute him.

A short while later, Mo Na Ye issued an order. The Black Ink Clan Armies that had been hiding around the five Territory Gates in Acacia Territory emerged and formed a blockade. There were now a million troops at each Territory Gate, and although no Territory Lords were overseeing them, such Armies were simply insurmountable. Even if an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master tried to break through their defences, the Black Ink Clan would be able to stop them if they disregarded the losses that they would sustain.

Just as Mo Na Ye and others were having their discussion, Bi Xi’s Soul Clone suddenly seemed to notice something and turned to look in a certain direction. There seemed to be an aura that was extremely similar to his coming from that direction. Although they were separated by hundreds of millions of kilometres, the aura from the same Source could not be blocked by such a trivial distance.

He immediately became confused. [Why is he here? If that guy is here, then wouldn’t the little ones also be here? Why aren’t they cultivating in the Star Boundary? Why did they appear in Acacia Territory? They truly do not fear the Heavens! What if something happens to them? How am I supposed to explain it to Yang Kai?]

He quickly calmed himself and sent out a message to the other side, “Why did you bring the little ones here?”

The other side answered quickly, “Why are you here?”

He replied, “It’s a long story. Yang Boy wanted to come to Acacia Territory. Yu Ru Meng and the others insisted on following him, so I had no other choice.”

The other side fell silent for a moment. When he spoke again, he seemed slightly guilty, “Has Yang Boy returned? Ahem… Did he return to the Star Boundary?”

“Probably not,” he responded angrily, “You are too bold! How could you bring them here?”

The other side said, “I had no choice. These little ones had some success in their cultivation; moreover, they are young and ambitious. How could they bear just hiding away in the Star Boundary without doing anything? They’ve been complaining incessantly. As you know, I’ve gotten old. I can’t stand the endless begging and coaxing of the little ones. In a moment of weakness, I…”

“You’re such a useless fool!” Bi Xi’s Soul Clone spat in disdain.

The other side was silent for a moment, “You are me, and I am you. If you scold me, then you are scolding yourself too.”

Bi Xi’s Soul Clone was at a loss for words for a moment. Thankfully, he did not forget the main issue at hand and quickly said, “There’s something wrong with the situation in Acacia Territory. The Black Ink Clan is probably trying to lure us all into a trap. You should take them away before the situation becomes chaotic. You don’t have much time, so move quickly!”

“Good!” The other side responded just as rapidly. It was obvious that he had also realised something was wrong in Acacia Territory.

After their simple exchange, both sides immediately cut off contact. Bi Xi’s Soul Clone couldn’t help feeling slightly melancholic. [Should I tell Yang Kai about this? If I tell him, he won’t be able to ignore their situation, but if I don’t tell him, how will I explain myself if he learns about this matter in the future?]

Just as Bi Xi’s Soul Clone was feeling hesitant and indecisive, Yang Kai suddenly looked back with a frown from where he stood on the deck of Dawning Light. He vaguely felt as though there was a strange energy fluctuation coming from behind him earlier; however, he did not discover anything when he carefully searched for the source, which left him puzzled.

With his strength, it was generally impossible for him to mistake such a subtle feeling, so he couldn’t help feeling worried. [Could someone from the Black Ink Clan be spying on us from the shadows?]

He immediately sent a Divine Sense transmission to Bi Xi’s Soul Clone, “Senior Brother Bi Xi, did you notice anything abnormal just now?”

Bi Xi’s Soul Clone felt extremely guilty but still hastily replied, “No? Did you detect something abnormal?”

Yang Kai felt even more confused, [Could I have been mistaken?]

Just in case, he surged his Divine Sense and swept his surroundings. His investigation immediately revealed the presence of five powerful auras in the distant void, travelling at a high speed.

[Five Territory Lords! The Black Ink Clan sure is determined. I can’t believe that five Territory Lords are overseeing Acacia Territory! It seems the Black Ink Clan truly harbours a deep hatred for the Hunters. Of course, it might also have something to do with me…]

The Black Ink Clan had probably predicted that he would come to Acacia Territory, so these five Territory Lords might have made a special trip here just to eliminate him.

When Yang Kai detected the five Territory Lords, the five Territory Lords also noticed his presence. Their powerful Divine Senses immediately traced back his probe and discovered the whereabouts of Dawning Light and the Bi Xi Battleship. It was just that the distance was too great, so they could not learn much other than that there was a powerful Human Race Master spying on them from afar.

It was one thing if they had not discovered the Warships, but having noticed them, they could not ignore their presence. They were Territory Lords after all. Across the vast Universe, the only two Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were fully occupied and unable to move, so why should they be afraid of anyone? They immediately turned around, transformed into Black Ink Clouds, and rushed in the direction of the Warships.

Aboard Dawning Light, Yang Kai immediately withdrew and concealed his aura so that he resembled a dead rock as he shouted, “We’ve got incoming! Continue at full speed!”

After the words left his mouth, he vanished without a trace.

On Dawning Light, Feng Ying’s expression turned solemn as she hastily cooperated with the rest of the Squad members to fully activate the Warship’s strength. Behind them, Bi Xi’s Soul Clone mustered all his strength to follow.

The two Warships transformed into two streams of dazzling light as they shot forward with astonishing speed, but regardless of how fast they moved, there was no way they could outrun Innate Territory Lords, so the distance between them closed rapidly.

In less than a stick of incense, the two Warships appeared in the eyes of the Territory Lords. When the five Territory Lords detected the two Warships with their Divine Senses, they immediately became overjoyed. An Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master and a dozen or so Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters! It was certainly a huge harvest.

These five Territory Lords were the reinforcements that Mo Na Ye had requested. They only knew that they were here to cooperate with Mo Na Ye against a Human Race Master, but did not know the identity of their target.

They never imagined that they would encounter two Human Squads as soon as they arrived at Acacia Territory, much less that their discovery would be so plentiful. In any case, they did not think much of a lone Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master as any one of them was enough to restrain the other party. Nevertheless, they couldn’t help feeling puzzled for a moment. Did the Hunters have Eighth-Order Masters among their ranks?

The situation did not match the information that they possessed. As the Human Race did not have many Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, each one of them was a pillar of strength that would have to join the front lines in the primary Great Territory Battlefields.

Although there were many Hunters, there had never been any Eighth-Order Masters among them. There were many Sixth-Order and Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, as well as Fourth-Order and Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. Needless to say, none were weaker than that. The Hunters who roamed the various Great Territories would not survive without a certain level of strength, so Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters generally did not have the necessary capabilities. Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm was the lowest acceptable limit.

The reason Hunters were extremely difficult to kill was that they were extremely elusive and hard to find. Now that the five Territory Lords had encountered the two Hunter Squads, how could they allow them to escape? They naturally gave chase with all their might.

After a brief period, the distance between them grew even closer.

The pursuing Territory Lords surged their strength, sending out numerous Divine Abilities and Secret Techniques towards Dawning Light and the Bi Xi Battleship. A short while later, the void shook as both Warships lit up with a thick and durable defensive Spirit Array that constantly flashed from the impact. The occasional counterattacks were also easily deflected by the pursuing Territory Lords.

The battle that took place here seemed to set off the entire Acacia Territory.

In the distant void, a Warship was speeding in the direction of a Territory Gate. 10 figures were standing on the deck of the Warship, five of them very young, consisting of both males and females.

There was a pair of children, a little girl with delicate and adorable looks and a boy with a large gaping mouth that dripped with saliva. The little girl constantly wiped his saliva for him, but there was no end to his drool. Be that as it may, she did not show any impatience. She simply repeated her actions over and over again, which made the boy giggle endlessly.

There was a small Stone Man. From his external appearance alone, he seemed very similar to the Small Stone Race which was actively playing a role on the various Great Territory Battlefields. However, a closer inspection would reveal that he was a different species altogether.

Whether strong or weak, the Small Stone Race generally had low sentience. Even the 1,000-metre-tall Small Stone Race members who could rival an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master would only act according to their instincts and did not seem to have the ability for autonomous thinking.

On the contrary, the small Stone Man was clearly different. Not only was he sentient, he was highly so. At this moment, he was climbing the edges of the Warship in disinterest as he stared into the void with a look of loneliness and forlornness in his eyes.

There was also an Ominous Beast lying on the deck with its eyes closed. It was obvious that this Ominous Beast was a Divine Spirit of similar rank to Tao Wu that Yang Kai slaughtered in Profound Nether Territory.

Beside the Ominous Beast was a delicate little girl. She was stroking his fur lightly with a leisurely expression. She looked rather young, but her eyes were filled with the vastitudes of countless years. It was obvious that she was not just a simple little girl.

The line-up in this group certainly looked very strange; however, everybody in the group, be it the young people, the two children, or the Ominous Beast, seemed to be rather powerful.

At first glance, even their Warship looked very similar to Yu Ru Meng and the others’. That was another Bi Xi Battleship, one that was modified and formed from Bi Xi’s Soul Clone.

The other party in the communication with Bi Xi’s Soul Clone on Yang Kai’s side earlier was none other than this Warship.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

They were both Bi Xi’s Soul Clones; therefore, they had no problems communicating with each other regardless of the distance between them as long as they were in the same Great Territory and unaffected by a Heaven Sealing Earth Locking Array or Technique. They could also communicate in secret. Even a Master like Yang Kai could not detect anything. He could only perceive a slight disturbance in the void, which had prompted him to investigate his surroundings. Nevertheless, he never expected to catch the attention of five travelling Territory Lords, which was just an unfortunate coincidence.
