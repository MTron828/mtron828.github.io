In fact, against Divine Spirits, Heaven’s Order was more powerful than even Great Emperors. Though, this was limited to Divine Spirits, which made her their natural enemy.

Both Phoenixes and Dragons were no exception, as she had killed many Dragons in her lifetime.

Although the Four Great Divine Venerables in the Ancient Lands were Divine Spirits as well, they were still much weaker than True Dragons. Even the Dragons were no match for Heaven’s Order, let alone these Divine Venerables. That was why, when they realized that Zhang Ruo Xi was Heaven’s Order’s descendant, they turned completely pale in fright, as though the end of the world had arrived.

“Fan Wu… don’t go spouting nonsense…” Cang Guo gulped as he looked dazedly at Zhang Ruo Xi, who had transformed into a completely different person. In a trembling voice, he uttered, “Are you sure she is a descendant of Heaven’s Order?”

Fan Wu forced a smile and replied in a bitter voice, “You’ve also inherited your ancestors’ memories, so don’t you recognize that sword?”

Cang Guo was rendered speechless, as Heaven’s Order Sword was exactly what Heaven’s Order used as her primary weapon. From the memories they had inherited, they knew that the sword had been sealed behind the Blood Gate. The reason they cordoned off this area and never allowed anyone to come close to this place wasn’t that they were worried about Monster Race members obtaining Source Strength and being reborn as Divine Spirits.

No, their worry was that the Heaven’s Order Sword would re-emerge in this world. Now, their biggest worry had become reality.

It wasn’t that someone had barged into the Blood Gate and brought the Heaven’s Order Sword out, but it was summoned by a Human girl in her early twenties. Only Heaven’s Order and her descendants were capable of wielding the Heaven’s Order Sword. With that sword in her hand, Zhang Ruo Xi’s identity could not be clearer.

“It’s all over…” Cang Guo muttered. Their biggest worry had come true. Heaven’s Order Sword had reappeared, and the bloodline of Heaven’s Order’s descendant had awakened. From now on, there wouldn’t be a single peaceful day for any Divine Spirits anymore. The people who would face her wrath first were undoubtedly the Four Great Divine Venerables at the scene.

“Heaven’s Order’s descendant…” Yang Kai was dumbstruck, as he had never expected that Zhang Ruo Xi was the descendant of the legendary Heaven’s Order, who was the natural enemy of all the Divine Spirits.

The revelation was so shocking that he still couldn’t come to his senses after some time. Soon though, he thought of something. After they entered the Flowing Time Temple in the Four Season Land, Zhang Ruo Xi suddenly disappeared for some time. When she appeared again, she was clad in the Pink Clouds Phoenix Robe, a priceless defensive Emperor Artifact.

Zhang Ruo Xi told him that it was a guy called Qiong Qi who gifted it to her. Qiong Qi was one of the most ferocious among the Ancient Divine Spirits, so Yang Kai had never understood why such a powerful creature would give Zhang Ruo Xi such a precious artifact. Now, he realized that Qiong Qi must have sensed her Bloodline Power, which was why the beast hadn’t dared to make things difficult for her. He must have also realized that her bloodline would awaken if she was pushed into a crisis, and when that happened, Qiong Qi would find himself in a perilous situation.

On the other hand, Duan Hong Chen must have figured it out as well, but he wouldn’t dare to reveal such an important secret. All the signs suggested that Zhang Ruo Xi was undoubtedly a descendant of Heaven’s Order.

“I see…” Yang Kai put on a bitter smile. Things had developed to a point that had exceeded his imagination, as he had never expected that he would be so flabbergasted after Zhang Ruo Xi’s Bloodline Power awakened.

“You!” Zhang Ruo Xi shot Shi Huo a glare and spoke in a cold voice, “Tell me, how do you want to die?”

Shi Huo shuddered as his face warped in fear. The flickering flames in his eyes suggested that he was extremely anxious. Just some time ago, he had no regard for Zhang Ruo Xi whatsoever, as he could easily kill a Human girl in the Third-Order Dao Source Realm with a snort; however, the girl before his eyes now was able to make him feel uneasy and fill his heart with despair.

He had revealed his intention of killing Zhang Ruo Xi just now, and he had tortured Yang Kai for a very long time, so he was certain that she must completely resent him now. The Monster Race members and the other Divine Venerables might be able to survive this calamity, but he was certain he had no future.

Upon realizing this, Shi Huo threw all caution to the wind and decided to double down, pushing his dark flames madly as he shouted, “So what if you’re a descendant of Heaven’s Order!? I am the descendant of an Ancient Divine Spirit, how are you able to kill me before you even grow up?”

After he barked at Zhang Ruo Xi, he turned to look at Fan Wu and the others as he uttered, “My fellow Divine Venerables, Heaven’s Order is the common enemy of all the Divine Spirits, and her power is capable of suppressing all of us. If all of you still want to rest easy at night, why don’t you join me and nip her descendant in the bud before she becomes stronger?”

Yang Kai’s expression darkened when he heard that as he sized up the other three Divine Venerables anxiously.

Just like what Shi Huo had said, the Bloodline Power within Zhang Ruo Xi had just awakened, so it wasn’t certain how powerful she was. However, the powers of these Divine Venerables were unquestionable. Once they joined forces, Zhang Ruo Xi might not be able to counter them.

Cang Guo appeared tempted, apparently swayed by what Shi Huo had said. On the other hand, Fan Wu and Luan Feng didn’t give any reaction, so it wasn’t certain what was on their minds. Their reactions were not missed by Cang Guo as well, and after giving it a thought with a frown, he shook his head slightly and suppressed the impulse in his heart.

Shi Huo’s heart sank when he saw that and snarled, “Are you really willing to give her time to grow? Don’t you understand that when she becomes stronger, all Divine Spirits in the world will live a life that is worse than Hell?”

Naturally, Fan Wu and the others understood that as well. When Heaven’s Order walked the world in the past, all Divine Spirits hid in fear from her, worried she would find them and take their Sources before killing them.

It wasn’t until Heaven’s Order suddenly went missing hundreds of thousands of years ago that these Divine Spirits slowly emerged again. Shi Huo’s words were indeed sensible, but Fan Wu and the others didn’t have the guts to confront Zhang Ruo Xi.

Faced with someone with Heaven’s Order’s bloodline, they were instinctively wary and terrified. Even if they wanted to deal with Zhang Ruo Xi, they didn’t have the courage to do so.

Fan Wu directly closed his eyes and stayed clear from this. Apparently, he wasn’t willing to offend Zhang Ruo Xi.

On the other hand, his intention was to let Shi Huo test the waters first. If Zhang Ruo Xi, as Heaven’s Order’s descendant, turned out to be less powerful than she appeared to be, it wouldn’t be too late for them to make a move. However, if she had inherited all of Heaven’s Order’s abilities, then Shi Huo would be the best guinea pig.

“Fine then!” Shi Huo snorted and swept a mocking glance over Fan Wu and the others before he uttered loudly, “Since that’s the case, I’ll end her life on my own. You don’t have to thank me afterwards!”

Upon finishing his words, he growled as his already gigantic figure seemed to expand once more, growing twice as large as before. His entire body was engulfed in dark flames, and his eyes were burning with rage. The ground seemed to have melted because of the heat, and the atmosphere around that place turned scorching hot.

*Deng, Deng, Deng…*

Shi Huo charged forward and reached Zhang Ruo Xi in just three steps. He raised his right arm as he was aiming to strike her with his humongous fist.

“From today onward, there won’t be any more descendants of Heaven’s Order!” Shi Huo grinned as his aura turned violent. He had never been kind-hearted; otherwise, he wouldn’t have slaughtered all of those from the Black Tortoise Sect twenty thousand years ago. It all happened because when one of their disciples was travelling around the world, he came across Shi Huo and offended him because he didn’t know who the latter was. Nevertheless, in retaliation, Shi Huo went to the Black Tortoise Sect and killed all ten thousand members of that Sect.

Judging from how he tortured Yang Kai on this day, it was apparent that he was a ruthless individual that was worse than the infamous ominous beast, Qiong Qi. As his gargantuan fist flew towards Zhang Ruo Xi, the wind pressure that came with his attack caused her hair and clothes to fly out behind her.

Fan Wu widened his eyes in that instant and stared fixedly at them, wanting to determine whether this Heaven’s Order descendant was as powerful as she appeared to be. Luan Feng and Cang Guo held their breaths as well.

The Third Disciple exclaimed and covered her eyes, as though she didn’t dare toover time watch what would happen next. At the same time, Yang Kai shouted, “Ruo Xi, watch out!”

Under everyone’s gazes though, Zhang Ruo Xi just stood there without showing any intention of making a move. She didn’t try to evade the attack, nor did she attempt to defend herself. Faced with the strike that was powerful enough to shatter worlds, she appeared unfazed as her expression was completely calm. Standing in front of the gigantic Shi Huo, she looked as small as an ant, which was a stark contrast to the attacker.

Shi Huo was elated that she remained unmoving, exerting more force with his fist as he sneered, “Weak!”

He could already envision the sight of Zhang Ruo Xi being crushed to death by him. If he could kill her, all the Divine Spirits in this world would owe him a favour, a huge favour. By then, everyone in the Ancient Lands, including Fan Wu and the other Divine Venerables, wouldn’t dare to disobey him.

“Kneel down!” Just as the huge fist was about to hit her, Zhang Ruo Xi suddenly tucked her hair behind her ear and parted her lips to utter these two words lightly.

“What?” Fan Wu was startled. Luan Feng and Cang Guo were also rooted to the spot as they glanced at each other, thinking to themselves, [Did we hear that right? Did this little girl just demand that Shi Huo kneel down? Even if she’s really Heaven’s Order’s descendant, and her bloodline has awakened, she’s still just a little girl. Was she originally this haughty? Her enemy is Divine Spirit, Shi Huo.]

*Weng…*

Just then, the Blood Gate started humming as a mysterious force flooded out from it. Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Guo grunted as their expressions changed drastically. Under this strange force’s suppression, the Divine Spirit Sources in their bodies shook violently and their minds filled with soul-wrenching fear. They almost fell to their knees right then and there, as though they couldn’t even support their own weight.

Fortunately, they managed to stabilize their figures and not embarrass themselves at the last moment; however, the actual target of the mysterious force, Shi Huo, wasn’t so lucky. His colossal fist stopped just a palm length from Zhang Ruo Xi, his flames almost burning her hair. Nevertheless, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t advance his fist even the slightest bit further.

His expression changed from stunned to shocked, and his legs turned to jelly as he fell on his knees in front of Zhang Ruo Xi.

“Ahh…” Fan Wu and the others gasped in utter astonishment.

They could feel that this force that had suppressed Shi Huo didn’t come from Zhang Ruo Xi, but rather from the Blood Gate. Still, it was obvious that this force was being controlled by this young girl before their eyes.

She was able to force a Divine Spirit, Shi Huo, to kneel down on the ground with ease. In other words, it wouldn’t take her much effort to suppress the other three Divine Venerables.

Silavin, Like mentioned. I wanted to fix the Black Turtle Sect plot hole but it’s sorta too far gone. So, I suggest we treat it as though the story actually got changed over the course of time. Also, Shi Huo has nothing to do with tortoises.
