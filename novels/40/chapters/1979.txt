Chapter 1979, Poaching

Translator: Silavin & PewPewLaserGun

Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain & Dhael Ligerkeys

Kang Si Ran had a very hard time this past month with Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce’s Pill Pavilion using despicable and shameless means to poach two of his Alchemists.

If Spirit Pill Plaza really folded because of this, Kang Si Ran’s career in Violet Source Chamber of Commerce would be over.

After finally finding Yang Kai and having him sign a Soul Contract to become the second Alchemist in Spirit Pill Plaza and stabilize the situation, Kang Si Ran had really not expected to receive news that Alchemist Fan was planning to leave.

If Alchemist Fan really left, then the situation he had worked so hard to restore would likely collapse again, making the future worrying.

Kang Si Ran was incredibly anxious as he hurriedly led Yang Kai towards the shop’s backyard. Even before the pair arrived though, Fan Hong’s shouts could be heard, “Who dares to stop me!? This Fan must quit! Make way! Any who block this Fan’s path cannot blame this Fan for being impolite!”

In the backyard, several shop-hands were trying to persuade Fang Hong to stop, but they were not having any success.

Kang Si Ran heard these shouts and knew that the situation was indeed dire, so he quickly increased his speed and in the blink of an eye, he arrived to see a bristling Fan Hong who seemed to be on the verge of attacking.

However, after seeing Kang Si Ran, Fan Hong frowned as a hint of guilt flashed deep within his eyes.

“Alchemist Fan, what seems to be the matter?” Although Kang Si Ran was annoyed by Fan Hong at this moment, he did not dare to use a harsh tone and could only ask politely.

Fan Hong sighed and said, “Shopkeeper Kang, this Fan Hong feels sorry for you, but this Fan had decided he must leave. Please forgive me, Shopkeeper Kang.”

“Has this Kang not offered Alchemist Fan enough for his services? Or perhaps Alchemist Fan has received a better offer somewhere else? If so, there is room for discussion!” Kang Si Ran knew that the most important matter right now was to figure out why Fan Hong wanted to leave Spirit Pill Plaza so he could try to find a remedy to the situation.

“Shopkeeper Kang saying so is an insult to this Fan! This Fan has worked for Spirit Pill Plaza since he came to Maplewood City and has refined pills for Spirit Pill Plaza for more than a decade. This Fan regards this place like his home and would not be tempted by mere greed,” Fan Hong implored in an impassioned tone as he looked truly offended by Kang Si Ran’s words.

Kang Si Ran smiled bitterly, “If the reason is not payment, why does Alchemist Fan suddenly insist on leaving?”

Fan Hong sighed and said, “Shopkeeper Kang, this past month this Fan has been performing Alchemy day and night and is now nothing but a dried-up oil lamp. If this continues, this Fan is afraid he will not be able to bear it. Shopkeeper Kang, just allow this Fan to leave.”

Hearing this, Kang Si Ran was at a loss for words.

While the two of them were talking, Yang Kai was also observing Fan Hong and found that, as this man said, he had most likely experienced excessive consumption of his strength. Not only was Fan Hong’s hair a mess and his eyes bloodshot, but even his aura was also fluctuating somewhat chaotically. It was clear he was extremely fatigued.

What’s more, this Fan Hong was not very strong to begin with, only a peak Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator.

With this kind of cultivation, Yang Kai estimated that even if he was an Origin King Grade Alchemist, he could only be at the Origin King Grade Low-Rank.

After all, Alchemy often needed the support of enough internal Qi, otherwise, refining good Spirit Pills would be impossible. However, Alchemists normally immersed themselves in Alchemy year-round, causing them to neglect their own cultivation. But without a strong cultivation, how could they have enough strength to support high-level Alchemy?

This became a vicious circle for most Alchemists.

“This is indeed because this Kang’s failure of management. Please forgive my incompetence, Alchemist Fan!” Kang Si Ran also knew that Fan Hong had paid a great price this past month, so he did not hesitate to bow his head upon hearing this.

Fan Hong seemed surprised by this act and quickly said, “Shopkeeper Kang is too polite.”

Kang Si Ran shook his head, “It was this Kang’s failure of responsibility, but everything is alright now. This Kang has just hired another Alchemist, so Alchemist Fan need not bear this burden alone anymore. You can refine the normal number of Spirit Pills as before. That being the case, would Alchemist Fan consider remaining in the plaza? Of course, Alchemist Fan can take a few days to rest and recuperate first.”

“Hired another Alchemist?” Fan Hong was stunned when he heard these words and quickly scanned the crowd, finally stopping on Yang Kai’s unfamiliar face.

Yang Kai smiled at him slightly.

“This Kang has naturally seen Alchemist Fan’s contribution to the store with his own eyes, and no mere words of gratitude will be enough thanks. Please take some time to rest, and when you feel it appropriate, return to the store to discuss this matter again.” Kang Si Ran said sincerely, looking at Fan Hong imploringly as he really did not want to let Fan Hong go.

“This...” Fan Hong looked awkward and seemed a little hesitant.

Just as Kang Si Ran was preparing to persuade Fan Hong further, a clear and sweet voice suddenly came from outside, “Alchemist Fan, the time has arrived. This Mistress has come to meet you in person.”

As soon as this person’s voice fell, Fan Hong’s complexion changed drastically, going from red, to blue, to green, embarrassed to the extreme.

Kang Si Ran was also startled, but soon grit his teeth and cursed, “Zhuo Ning Si!”

His eyes flashed with anger, as if there was some great hatred between him and this woman named Zhuo Ning Si.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed slightly as he vaguely understood something before he turned a grin towards Fan Hong.

Fan Hong was clearly uncomfortable, and his eyes were darting around erratically, his lips moving lightly, as if he was cursing.

When Kang Si Ran’s gaze shifted back to him, Fan Hong flushed even further and seemed to be looking for a hole to crawl into!

“This old master understands!” Kang Si Ran sneered coldly, “Alchemist Fan really found a better place to go. If that is the case, Alchemist Fan might as well have just said so earlier so this old master could offer his congratulations. Why bother looking for some excuse instead?”

Fan Hong gritted his teeth, becoming angry out of shame and snapped, “What is Shopkeeper Kang trying to imply? Is it not true that this Fan has made great contributions this past month? In order to refine enough Spirit Pills for the store, this Fang has coughed up blood several times already! If it were not for this Fan’s efforts, Spirit Pill Plaza would have closed already!”

The more he spoke, the more excited he became and the louder his voice resounded.

Kang Si Ran heard all this and frowned deeply, after a long time simply sighing and slumping his shoulders, as if he had suddenly aged a thousand years. Nodding faintly, he admitted, “What Alchemist Fan said is true, if not for Alchemist Fan’s support, Spirit Pill Plaza would indeed have closed a long time ago.”

“Hmph! If you understand, then there’s no need to say anything more!” Fan Hong coldly snorted, “This Fan must also consider his future. Sacrifice alone is not enough to support one’s life! Shopkeeper Kang should also understand this truth. You take care, this Fan will take his leave!”

Finished with what he had to say, Fan Hong pushed away the two shop-hands blocking his path and walked towards the front of the shop.

When he walked past Yang Kai, he paused for a moment and smiled at him faintly, seemingly taking pleasure in his misfortune, “You’ll be miserable as well soon.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Yang Kai just shrugged in a noncommittal manner.

Kang Si Ran stood in place, pondered for a moment, then suddenly turned around and followed Fan Hong out.

Outside Spirit Pill Plaza, a beautiful woman with a rather revealing dress smiled as she stood before the gates, a few beautiful maids standing by her side. She exuded a kind of intoxicating charm that was only amplified by her exposed snow-white skin and deep cut dress which revealed a rather profound valley, drawing countless looks from the passing male cultivators.

This woman did not seem to care at all about the looks she was getting; on the contrary, she seemed to enjoy those men’s gazes very much. From time to time, she would even send out a wink or two, causing some men to nearly lose their souls.

Fan Hong hurriedly walked out of Spirit Pill Plaza, arrived in front of the beautiful woman, and muttered, “Didn’t I say I would come myself? What did you come here for?”

Zhuo Ning Si giggled as she pursed her lips and said, “Is there something wrong with this Mistress coming to greet you in person?”

“You... Haa...” Fan Hong sighed helplessly.

Zhuo Ning Si continued, “Even if Alchemist Fan wants to conceal the truth, unless he hides from the public forever, eventually, everyone will know. Besides, it is only changing one’s place of employment, is there anything wrong with that?”

Fan Hong wore a sullen face and did not answer.

He knew that Zhuo Ning Si had not come here to welcome him, but rather to strike a blow against Spirit Pill Plaza. He was just a pawn that could be used by Zhuo Ning Si.

So, he knew that arguing here was also pointless.

As the two talked, Kang Si Ran walked out and staring at this graceful and beautiful woman, his eyes nearly spat flames.

Zhuo Ning Si noticed his gaze and gave a strange cry as she placed her jade white hand atop her well-rounded peaks, “Shopkeeper Kang’s gaze is quite fierce, like he wishes he could eat this Mistress whole. But Shopkeeper Kang, you are not young anymore, are you sure you could handle such a rich meal?”

As she spoke, she covered her mouth and smiled.

“Shopkeeper Zhuo!” Kang Si Ran was not moved by her beauty at all and instead just smiled coldly, “You certainly are praiseworthy, this old master admires your methods.”

“Oh, what does Shopkeeper Kang mean? This Mistress does not understand,” Zhuo Ning Si pulled out a folding fan and began waving it lightly.

“No one here is a fool, so why bother acting? However, if Shopkeeper Zhuo thinks that this is enough to force my Spirit Pill Plaza to shut down, you could not be more wrong,” Kang Si Ran sneered.

“Haha...” Zhuo Ning Si covered her mouth with her fan as she stared at Kang Si Ran with her beautiful eyes, “This Mistress remembers that Shopkeeper Kang had three Origin King Grade Alchemists in his employment before, but they all seem to have left for this Mistress’s Pill Pavilion now. Could it be that Shopkeeper Kang is also a Grandmaster in the Alchemic Dao and plans to support his store all on his own? Shopkeeper Kang is truly not young anymore and should take better care of his body.”

“Hmph, with Maplewood City being so big, how hard do you think it is to find an Origin King Grade Alchemist?” Kang Si Ran grinned.

Zhuo Ning Si was truly stunned this time and asked in surprise, “Has Shopkeeper Kang hired another Alchemist?”

Fan Hong leaned over at this moment and whispered a few words in Zhuo Ning Si’s ear.

Zhuo Ning Si’s brow furrowed as her gaze shifted to Yang Kai, her beautiful eyes lighting up as she smiled and said, “Sir Alchemist, dare I ask your surname?”

“Yang!”

“So it is Alchemist Yang, this Mistress has been impolite,” Zhuo Ning Si smiled and said, “Alchemist Yang is young, but his cultivation is profound and he is also an Alchemist, this Mistress is deeply impressed.”

“There have always been many people who admire me,” Yang Kai chuckled.

Zhuo Ning Si slightly froze for a moment, not having expected Yang Kai to be so brazen, but she didn’t pay it much mind as she simply smiled and continued, “Then I wonder if Alchemist Yang is interested in coming to my Pill Pavilion to perform Alchemy, this Mistress can promise Alchemist Yang...”

“Zhuo Ning Si!”

Before she could finish speaking, Kang Si Ran cut in furiously.
