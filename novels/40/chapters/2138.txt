The male and female cultivators, who no one knew where they hailed from, crashed into an invisible barrier protecting the entrance of the Four Seasons Realm, forcing them to be unable to enter.

Not only that, the barrier that blocked the two of them contained an extremely brutal killing power, directly wringing the two into a mass of flesh and blood, exploding in the air.

The two of them died unexplainably!

“What?”

“What is going on?”

Below, many cultivators screamed, their faces turned pale.

[If the entrance of the Four Seasons Realm was so dangerous, how can we get in? I’m afraid that most of the people present can’t pass through the entrance at all, and all will die here.]

However, many Dao Source Realms’ faces stayed unmoved, as if they had long expected this.

Yang Kai sighed.

He got the jade slip from Azure Sun Temple, and he knew that the two’s behaviour was reckless. If he wanted to enter the Four Seasons Realm, he couldn’t force it. No matter how high one’s cultivation was, he would end up just like those two people.

If you wanted to enter the Four Seasons Realm, you could only wait for a mysterious force.

This was the benefit of information.

If Yang Kai went alone, if he was ignorant, he could just break in and cause some unpredictable consequences.

A transparent energy ball emerged from the crack. The energy ball was like a bubble, suspended in the air.

When the energy ball appeared, the disciples of Star Soul Palace moved into action.

Ten of the forty disciples rushed into the bubble one after another. It was twisted and deformed but never burst. It looked amazing.

The bubble seemed to have just enough space for ten people to stand. After ten Dao Source Realm cultivators got inside, there was not much space left. The bubble contracted very quickly and swiftly drifted towards the entrance.

Those that got on went into the entrance and disappeared.

The cultivators who came to participate in the Four Seasons Realm Sealed World for the first time now understood what was going on.

The bubble was the key to entering Four Seasons Realm.

Another bubble emerged, and once again, ten disciples jumped into action...

After the process repeated four times, the disciples of Star Soul Palace were all gone.

Star Soul Palace was the overlord of the Southern Territory. The first batch to enter Four Seasons Realm was of course going to be them. Meanwhile, for the other positions, no one really knew how the Emperor Realms negotiated the order. After Star Soul Palace, it would be the 20 disciples from Heavenly Martial Holy Land who would be divided into two groups. One group entering the Four Seasons Realm after the other.

The Azure Sun Temple came in as the third batch.

When it was Azure Sun Temple’s turn, Xia Sheng took the lead and pointed out nine people to follow him and they took the mysterious bubble to enter the Sealed World.

Yang Kai was with the remaining nine people.

The bubbles looked amazing. Yang Kai felt no obstacles when he got inside. Instead, they seemed to have fallen into the water. The surrounding area was soft, but there was no suffocating feeling.

While wrapped in the bubble and passing through the crack, there was no danger at all.

When he opened his eyes, he was somewhere else. In front of him was a flower.

The ten were still wrapped in a bubble, suspended in the air. As the bubble began to burst, everyone hurriedly circulated their Qi and suspended themselves in the air.

From the information recorded in the jade slip, Yang Kai learned that every batch of cultivators that were introduced into the Four Seasons Realm by the bubble appeared in the same area, but it was difficult to guess where in that area they would actually land.

At that moment, the ten were still together, looking around. There were no other cultivators around, and those present did not know where the dozens of people who entered the Four Seasons Realm before had been teleported to.

Azure Sun Temple’s second batch of ten was a team headed by Xiao Bai Yi. After all, in the Sect rankings, Xiao Bai Yi ranked second only to Xia Sheng.

This was also negotiated in advance, and he and Xia Sheng would each lead a team.

The moment the bubble burst, Xiao Bai Yi took out a communication artifact from his Space Ring and poured his Divine Sense into it, as if he wanted to see whether Xia Sheng was nearby or not.

After waiting for a while, there was no response. Xiao Bai Yi had no choice but to put away the communication artifact.

“This should be the Realm of Summer, right?” Murong Xiao Xiao, who had been exploring the surroundings, suddenly asked.

The sun was scorching where they appeared, and the air contained extremely abundant Fire Attribute spiritual power. The ground was dry and cracked, and there was little vegetation. This location was known as the Realm of Summer.

“It should be,” Xiao Bai Yi said with a gentle nod, when he was about to speak again, his expression hardened and he turned and looked in one direction.

At the same time, Yang Kai’s expression sank, and he shouted in a low voice, “Something is coming!”

Xiao Bai Yi glanced at him in amazement, shocked by Yang Kai’s keen sense.

“What do you mean?” Murong Xiao Xiao questioned.

There was no need for Yang Kai to explain anything. As soon as her voice fell, there was a bang from far away, as if some behemoth was rushing towards them, shaking the earth with each step.

Everyone was startled, and they all quickly urged their Source Qi to be on guard.

The sound was getting closer and louder, and the shaking of the earth became more apparent.

Less than ten breaths after Yang Kai spoke, several streams of light suddenly appeared in front of him.

The lead was reddish-white, extremely dazzling, and exuded an aura that made everyone feel familiar and jealous.

“Wu Chang!” Xiao Bai Yi’s face sank. He never thought that he would encounter the evil star of Heavenly Martial Holy Land when entered the Four Seasons Realm.

He had seen the battle between Wu Chang and Xia Sheng before and secretly felt that this person was a powerful foe. If he met him alone, his chances of winning would be slim. At that moment, Wu Chang and some elites of Heavenly Martial Holy Land were headed towards him. This caused Xiao Bai Yi’s nerves to suddenly constrict.

Because of Xia Sheng’s previous fight with him, Wu Chang could already be said to be an enemy of Azure Sun Temple. If he wanted to kill this time around, Xiao Bai Yi had no confidence to stop him.

As he gritted his teeth and cursed, Yang Kai changed his expression and shouted, “They are not chasing after us! Something is chasing after them!”

“Wu Chang is being chased?”

The face of a male cultivator in the team changed abruptly.

Wu Chang was already the cultivator of Third-Order Dao Source Realm, and he was also the top rising star of Heavenly Martial Holy Land. To force him to escape like a madman, it had to be an existence at the Emperor Realm.

The Four Seasons Realm was not without such beings. Over the years, many people who had entered the Four Seasons Realm had died at the hands of such powerful beings who they had no power to oppose.

While talking, the thing that chased Wu Chang and others was printed in everyone’s eyes. Behind Wu Chang, at a distance, a monster that was tens of metres tall was wrapped in flames and had red eyes. The monster moved its limbs and ran across the ground, dragging a long red light behind it.

Every time it leapt, it seemed to ignore the barriers of space, and the earth shook under it.

“Flame Beast!” Xiao Bai Yi’s face turned pale and they called out in alarm, “This is the locale of the Flame Beast!”

In the information recorded in the jade slip of Azure Sun Temple, there were mentions of the Flame Beast from the Realm of Summer. It was a genuine Twelfth-Order Monster Beast, capable of exerting a powerful force equivalent to a Master in the Emperor Realm.

The place where Flame Beast was located, was also listed as a Restricted Area in the jade slip, and disciples were not allowed to visit it.

No one expected that their luck would be so bad that they would appear in Flame Beast’s territory as soon as they arrived.

However, it seemed that Wu Chang and the others had worse luck. They probably appeared near the Flame Beast habitat, which led to the hunt.

“Roar...” The Flame Beast, who had been chasing Wu Chang and the others, couldn’t catch them, and roared in rage. Along with the roar, a fiery red light suddenly appeared from its mouth.

The space was penetrated, and the fiery red light, with unimaginable lethality, ran through the north and south, stretching more than a dozen kilometres.

Wu Chang reacted swiftly. After detecting the murderous intent behind him, he quickly rushed upwards. He avoided the killer move, but the others were not so lucky.

One of the disciples of Heavenly Martial Holy Land couldn’t avoid it, and was directly hit by the fiery red light, turning to ashes without even screaming.

Another disciple’s arm was nicked, and it melted away, as the disciple let out an earth-shattering cry.

“Hurry up!” Yang Kai took the lead in summoning the Dao Source Grade High-Rank ship. Stepping on it and urging his Source Qi, the ship flew in the opposite direction as swiftly as lightning.

The nine people who had been watching Azure Sun Temple finally recovered and summoned their flight type artifacts, turning them into streamers of various colours, and fleeing from Flame Beast.

It was not that they were not strong enough. It was mainly because that person in Heavenly Martial Holy Land suddenly died.

That was the elite disciple of Heavenly Martial Holy Land, not an average fish from some small sect. The dead cultivator is of the same level as them.

And yet, he suddenly evaporated.

If anyone were to encounter such a scene, they would run as well.

Immediately after, Yang Kai and the nine others tried their best to escape without stopping to fight with Flame Beast. Even with the strength of everyone present, there was no way to fight such a terrifying existence. The result of retaliation would certainly be death.

The remaining people of Heavenly Martial Holy Land flew close behind. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

However, they were smart. They saw that someone was carrying the pot so they quickly scattered and went off in other directions.

After all, to the Flame Beast, no matter which sect they belonged to, anyone who trespassed in their territory had to die, so it simply chased.
