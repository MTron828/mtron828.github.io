The male old Elder said, “I do not know what the Ancient Masters were thinking; however, in this current situation, if there wasn’t this agreement, then the numbers of Dragons and Phoenixes would definitely have been fewer than it is now.”

Without this agreement, the Dragon and Phoenix Clans could enter and leave the battlefield at will, but who could guarantee that they would survive the fight? Under the powerful attacks of the Black Ink Clan, even mighty Dragons and Phoenixes could fall.

They could accept a few clansmen dying on the battlefield, but what about significant numbers of deaths? If a few important clansmen died and the entire Clan became agitated and rushed to the battlefield, it might lead to complete extinction.

It was because of this agreement that the two Clans could continue to remain at the No-Return Pass. Although the days were boring, at least they did not need to face the many risks of the battlefield.

From this point of view, perhaps it was not the ancient Human Great Expert who restricted the freedom of two Clans, but rather the two Clans choosing this of their own accord.

“But what does this have to do with this Junior recording my name on the Dragon Tome?” Yang Kai asked with a frown.

The Elder replied, “If you record your name on the Dragon Tome, then you must also honour this agreement.”

“In other words, if I record my name on the Dragon Tome, I have to stay at the No-Return Pass and cannot return to the Black Ink Battlefield?” Yang Kai exclaimed.

“Indeed,” The Elder nodded.

This agreement was known as the Bloodline Great Oath for a reason. If Yang Kai was not a pure-blood Dragon, it would be fine, but now that his Bloodline was pure, once he recorded his name in the Dragon Tome and officially joined the Dragon Clan, he would be subject to the same restrictions. If he broke them, he would face backlash from his Bloodline.

Yang Kai swept his eyes over the three Dragon Clan Elders in front of him, who all appeared very calm.

If Yang Kai had not taken the initiative to ask, they would not have said anything. It was not that they intended to hide anything, for if they did, they could simply have not explained at all.

Of course, the message that Fu Guang sent back on the Dragon Scale indicated that Yang Kai’s Great Sun and Moon Marks were extremely useful to the Dragon Clan. If possible, they wanted Yang Kai to remain at the No-Return Pass.

Not to mention the three of them, there were also other Ancient Dragons in the Clan who either wanted or needed to break through in the future. If Yang Kai helped them with their breakthrough, then their chances of success would greatly increase. Maybe by as much as 30%!

A 30% increase could not be underestimated; after all, over time that would mean a 30% increase in the number of Divine Dragons for the Dragon Clan!

Nonetheless, since Yang Kai took the initiative to ask, they had to explain it clearly. They did not intend to deceive him.

The benefits of recording one’s name in the Dragon Tome were indeed enormous and the possibility of coming back from the dead with the powers of the Dragon Tome and Dragon Pool were very tempting.

However, what was the use of all these benefits if he could not leave the No-Return Pass?

Yang Kai’s trip here was to improve his strength, mainly in preparation for the Human Race’s crusade. If he was now forced to remain in the No-Return Pass, how could he take part in the crusade? He would also have wasted Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao’s efforts and expectations.

Amidst the silence, the old female Elder said, “Yang Kai, the Source you received is the Source of the Third Generation Dragon Emperor. This Source is remarkable. Additionally, you have transformed from a Human to a Dragon. Once you record your name in the Dragon Tome, you can maintain your Family name and establish a new branch family of the Dragon Clan. This would be a huge contribution to the Dragon Clan!”

The old woman Elder’s message was obvious. If Yang Kai stayed at the No-Return Pass and sired a few more Young Dragons, then the Dragon Clan would add the Yang Family to the existing Fu, Zhu, and Ji Families. Furthermore, he would be the founding patriarch of this new Family!

Not just anyone could receive such an honour. The Dragon Clan has existed for countless aeons, but so far, only three family branches had been established.

As soon as Yang Kai recorded his name on the Dragon Tome, there would be another family branch, and Yang Kai would immediately become the first Ancestor of this Dragon Family branch.

Another Elder, who had not spoken so far, also added, “We’re not asking you to remain at the No-Return Pass and idle for the rest of your life. With your Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm cultivation, even with your 70,000-metre Ancient Dragon Form, your role on the Black Ink Battlefield will be very limited. However, if you stay in the No-Return Pass, your presence would be of great benefit and importance to the future of the Dragon Clan.”

“If you want, you can also bring your family to the No-Return Pass. Although we are also technically on the Black Ink Battlefield, it has been quite peaceful over the years. Now that Great Evolution Pass has been retaken, the Black Ink Clan can no longer come to harass us.”

“That’s right. You have family in the 3,000 Worlds, right? There is no such thing as security on the Black Ink Battlefield, so your loved ones must be extremely nervous about your safety. How could you continue to let them worry?”

The three Dragon Clan Elders took turns to persuade Yang Kai to record his name on the Dragon Tome and remain at the No-Return Pass.

However, when they saw that Yang Kai remained so indifferent, the three Elders knew that their persuasions were ineffective. Even if he was young compared to them, he was still a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master with a strong and resolute heart. If he could change his mind after just a few words of persuasion, then it would be impossible for him to have the cultivation he had today.

The old male Elder said again, “There is no hurry to decide on recording your name in the Dragon Tome. Why don’t you stay at the No-Return Pass for some time and carefully consider first. If you really do not wish to stay, no one can force you to.”

Yang Kai slowly shook his head and said, “This Junior appreciates the kindness of the three Elders, offering me the opportunity to record my name on the Dragon Tome and your invitation to stay at the No-Return Pass. This Junior is eager to live such a peaceful life, but many of my companions are still on the Black Ink Battlefield. The Human Race is about to embark on a grand crusade, but this Junior’s cultivation was too low. Perhaps as the Elders have said, my presence may not make much of a difference on the battlefield, but every pair of hands helps. Millions of my predecessors have fallen on the battlefield to stop the Black Ink Clan. This Junior is not that powerful, but I would like to follow the example of my ancestors. If I fall somewhere on the battlefield, it will only be because I am not strong enough. No one else is to be blamed.”

The old man Elder said solemnly, “So, you’ve made up your mind.”

Yang Kai took a step back, cupped his fist, bowed, and shouted, “For the common people, for the 3,000 Worlds, I will continue to fight until my dying breath!”

The old female Elder sighed softly and said no more.

The old male Elder then said, “In that case, we will not force you. About the matter of recording your name in the Dragon Tome… when the Black Ink Clan has been eliminated, you can come back to the No-Return Pass and we will help you do so.”

“Many thanks, three Elders!” Yang Kai bowed again, “I’ve inconvenienced you for too long now. I shall take my leave.”

“The battlefield is dangerous, be careful in whatever you do.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly, turned around and rushed out of the temple as the group of Dragon Clan members looked on with heavy hearts. He then flew out of the No-Return Pass.

Although the other Dragons were outside the temple, they saw and heard what happened inside and understood that Yang Kai did not record his name in the Dragon Tome.

Zhu Wu You went over to Fu Qian and whispered, “Is that guy stupid? He would rather go out courting death than to take up such a great reward.”

Fu Qian looked on as Yang Kai departed and sighed softly, “Why keep sharpening a sword if you don’t intend to use it?”

Zhu Wu You blinked at him for a moment before he snarled, “You are just as stupid.”

Fu Qian glared at him and barked, “You know shit!”

…..

When he was about to leave the No-Return Pass, Yang Kai stopped and turned his head to look at the Immortal Parasol Tree. He saw Huang Si Niang sitting on a tree branch, looking at him with a smile, and Feng Liu Lang standing next to her.

“Are you leaving?” Huang Si Niang asked with a smile.

“I am.” Yang Kai nodded, thought about it for a moment, turned around again and bowed to her, “Many thanks for helping out with my Wife’s affairs.”

Huang Si Niang waved her hand and said, “Think nothing of it. Is there anything you want to tell her?”

Yang Kai shook his head and said, “There is nothing to say.”

After a pause, he then asked, “The Dragon Clan and the Phoenix Clan had an ancient agreement with the Human Great Experts. After recording one’s name on the Dragon Tome, the Dragon Clan had to remain in the No-Return Pass, how about the Phoenix Clan?”

Huang Si Niang pursed her lips, patted the branch she was sitting on and said, “Once you have your own Nest on the Immortal Parasol Tree, you need to stay at the No-Return Pass.”

Yang Kai nodded blankly. It seemed that both the Dragon Clan and Phoenix Clan had similar restrictions. For the Dragon Clan, even if one did not record their name on the Dragon Tome, he could still cultivate in the Dragon Pool. However, the same could not be said about the Phoenix Clan. If one wanted to cultivate with the Phoenix Clan, it required possessing their own Phoenix Nest.

Now, Yang Kai understood that if Su Yan really came here, she would be restricted to the No-Return Pass.

Yang Kai cupped his fist and said, “I will take my leave now. If I come back, it will be a triumphant return!”

Huang Si Niang snickered, “Shameless boasting! Then, I’ll wait for your good news!”

As soon as he finished, he dashed away and then a loud Dragon Roar could be heard from the distance. A golden light flashed brightly as the Dragon Pressure faded away!

In the void, Yang Kai transformed into his 70,000-metre Ancient Dragon Form.

He did not do this to intentionally show off. The void was silent and no one would see even if he wanted to show off. He was overjoyed because he had gained so much during this trip to the Dragon Pool. His Dragon Body was only 35,000 metres when he first entered the Dragon Pool, but after emerging, it was 70,000 metres long.

Not only did his size double, but his Dragon Vein and Dragon Bloodline had become completely pure, allowing him to transform into a True Dragon.

This dramatic increase in size meant a huge increase in strength; however, his Small Universe still only had the heritage of a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Thus, it would take time for Yang Kai to get used to this sudden surge in power. He had to find a way to adapt, otherwise, it may be a problem if he had to face powerful enemies.

It took Yang Kai half a year to travel from Great Evolution Pass to the No-Return Pass. Now, even if his mastery over the Dao of Space had improved, it would still take roughly half a year for him to return.

This was the perfect opportunity to get familiar with his new strength.

During the journey, Yang Kai swung his Dragon Claws and whipped his Dragon Tail from time to time. Occasionally, he would use Dragon Clan Secret Techniques, and sometimes, he would summon the Azure Dragon Spear. His two Dragon Claws would grab the spear and wield it around as if he was fighting invisible enemies.

If anyone saw this scene, they might think that this Golden Dragon had gone insane.

Yang Kai could not help it though. The Human Race crusade was about to begin, and he did not want to enter the battlefield before he familiarized himself with his newfound powers.

It was a very fruitful trip to the No-Return Pass.

On top of the improvement of his Bloodline, he had gained a massive amount of Space Dao Essence from Su Yan’s Phoenix Nest.

The Space Dao Essence in her Phoenix Nest was created from the Immortal Parasol Tree and contained the mysteries of the Grand Dao of Heaven and Earth from the primordial era, so it was a great tonic for Yang Kai.

Although it did not take him to the next level of master in the Dao of Space, it did enhance his comprehension immensely.

The main reason was that Yang Kai’s own attainments in the Dao of Space were already very high, and it would be very difficult for him to ascend to the next level.

Inside the Dragon Pool, when he helped Fu Guang to draw in the Dragon Pool power, the latter even used his Dragon Bead to demonstrate to Yang Kai the mysteries of the Dao of Time.

That enabled Yang Kai to break through the shackles of his understanding of the Dao of Time, reaching the next level of mastery.

His Dragon Bloodline had grown and his two Grand Dao’s had improved tremendously.

At this moment, Yang Kai felt very fulfilled, both in terms of his strength and his perception of the two Grand Daos. He was totally unrecognizable as compared to when he left Great Evolution Pass.
