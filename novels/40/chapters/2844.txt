Not only did Shaman Tu’s provocation fail to achieve the desired effect, it even helped Yang Kai build his own prestige.

Now, everyone knew that although this Shaman Grandmaster named Niu looked thin and weak, his strength was unfathomable. If anyone could follow such a Shaman Grandmaster, their future would be safer and more promising than the others.

Furthermore, anyone who joined him could obtain a fine weapon too.

Who would not be moved under such conditions?

Therefore, after Shaman Tu left, Yang Kai’s recruitment progressed extremely well.

Within one stick of incense, another two thousand people had joined his ranks and had weapons divided amongst them.

Yang Kai did not just accept any newcomers though. He mainly took in whole villages, with the village being between two to three hundred people. Two thousand people wound up being equivalent to eight or nine villages.

Ninety-nine percent of these people were Barbarian Warriors and Spirit Archers, with the rest being Shamans of varying strength.

Tiea recorded the statistics for the two thousand new recruits and then reported to Yang Kai. In addition to the Shamans who had followed Yang Kai to King City before, he now had thirteen Shamans under his command, among which were four Shaman Warriors and nine Shaman Apprentices.

There were no Shaman Masters, but Yang Kai could not do anything about it. Shamans were rare in the first place, and it was even more difficult for places like villages to raise a Shaman Master. Only some small Clans and major cities with thousands of people would have Shaman Masters.

But this was not a big problem for Yang Kai, because he still had Tiea with him.

Other Shaman Grandmasters had Shaman Masters under them, but Yang Kai had a Shaman Grandmaster. Furthermore, Tiea was no ordinary Shaman Grandmaster. She had been taught by Senior Qing for many years and had mastered a lot more Shamanic Spells compared to ordinary Shaman Grandmasters. Once the war began, the two of them could work together and would be enough to cover the three thousand people with their Shamanic Spells.

Next, Yang Kai personally divided the three thousand people into ten small groups, ranging from two hundred fifty to three hundred people in each group. Then, he assigned the most powerful warriors and archers as the Captain and Vice-Captain of each group.

He also picked a hundred elites out of the three thousand people to serve as an Elite Guards.

It did not mean that Yang Kai needed Elite Guards as, with his current strength, why would he need others to protect him? Instead, the task of these Elite Guards was to protect the thirteen Shamans other than him and Tiea.

These Shamans were just Shaman Warriors and Shaman Apprentices, and it was true that they could not play a huge role when fighting alone. However, when it came to small and medium-scale battles, they would become the core of the ten groups. Any death among them would definitely be a huge loss.

Therefore, Yang Kai had to make plans for their safety.

The three thousand people were made aware of the group allocations swiftly and each group was managed by its own Captain and Vice-Captain, with these Captains and Vice-Captains answering directly to Yang Kai. With this method, it was much more efficient than him giving orders to the three thousand people himself.

The Shaman Grandmasters observed Yang Kai’s way of handling things and quickly realized the benefits of this kind of subdivision. As such, they also followed Yang Kai’s example in managing their groups, and soon, they became organized too.

After Yang Kai demonstrated his abilities in front of the crowd, these three thousand warriors were completely obedient to Yang Kai as they believed that they truly followed the right person this time and might have gained the upper hand over other clansmen in the upcoming war.

After passing down the order to the three thousand people to train in getting familiar with the cooperation and formation of their groups, Yang Kai and Tiea quietly left King City.

……

“Where are we going now?” Tiea questioned curiously, wondering why Yang Kai was dragging her with him.

Yang Kai led the way without turning his head back and answered, “When I was in King City, I saw some tamed Barbarian Beasts. Let’s catch some too.”

“Do you want to tame beasts?” Tiea looked at him in surprise.

“Senior Qing taught you the Beast Taming Spell, right?” Yang Kai looked back at her.

Tiea nodded gently, “Yes, he did, but I haven’t used it before, so I don’t know if it has any effect.”

“It’s fine as long as you’ve learnt it. As for the effect, we’ll know when we try later; after all, I haven’t used it either.” Yang Kai grinned.

“But… Do you know where to find Barbarian Beasts?”

“Just follow me. Those Beasts in King City didn’t just appear out of thin air. Since they can catch them, then we can do it too.”

Yang Kai flew forward as he spoke.

He had inquired about a certain place before. There was a mountain range about half a day away from King City, where Yang Kai’s targets for this trip lived.

They set out at night, and by dawn, a mountain range appeared in front of the pair, like a giant Dragon lying on the Earth. After entering the mountains, they continued ahead without stopping.

Half a day later, a fierce screech came from above.

Yang Kai stopped, looked up through the scattered leaves, and saw a huge eagle-like Barbarian Beast swooping down from above into a mountain pass. When the Barbarian Beast flew up to the sky again, a Giant Python had been caught in its sharp claws. The Giant Python struggled wildly and coiled its body around the Giant Eagle’s claws.

The Giant Eagle lowered its head and pecked at the Giant Python’s body, causing blood to rain down from the sky. The Giant Python struggled even more, causing the Giant Eagle to lose some of its steadiness, as if it would fall from the sky at any time.

But soon, the Giant Eagle opened its beak, and a wind blade-like attack suddenly shot out from its mouth, cutting the Giant Python’s body directly into several sections. Its internal organs turned into pulp, and its struggling body gradually stopped moving.

The Giant Eagle let out a fierce screech again, turned around in mid-air, then flew towards a certain direction with its prey in its claws.

“Do you want to tame this kind of Barbarian Beast?” Tiea noticed Yang Kai’s interested and motivated look, and immediately understood his intention.

“Of course we should tame Barbarian Beasts like this!” Yang Kai chased after the Giant Eagle as he answered.

Tiea was speechless. She knew that Yang Kai was coming to catch Barbarian Beasts, but she did not expect that he was looking for Flying Barbarian Beasts. This type of creature was much harder to catch than the ordinary Barbarian Beasts, and it seemed that the cultivation of the Giant Eagle was not low given its size and aura. She was afraid that her Beast Taming Spell might not work on it.

Despite the uneasy feeling, Tiea did not say much but followed Yang Kai obediently.

After a stick of incense worth of time, the pair came to a certain mountain valley which was surrounded by high cliffs, precipices, and jagged rocks. On the cliff were countless giant nests nestled between the rocks, each with a Giant Eagle standing proudly above it, like kings overlooking their territory.

More Giant Eagles soared through the air, with some leaving to look for food, while some were returning from their hunt.

“So many!” Tiea was amazed by the scene.

“It’s good to have more.” Yang Kai grinned. To him, it was better to have more of them, but it only depended on whether the Beast Taming Spell was useful or not. If it was useless, everything was just empty talk.

“Wait here, I’ll give it a try.” Yang Kai said before disappearing from his original place with a flicker.

Tiea looked around with wide eyes, but she could not find any trace of Yang Kai, causing a look of shock to fill her pretty face. This was definitely not the effect of any Shamanic Spell that she knew.

The more she stayed with Shaman Niu, the more Tiea discovered how mysterious he was.

When she was looking around for Yang Kai, she suddenly sensed some abnormal movement on the opposite cliff, and sure enough, she found Yang Kai when she looked over.

She had no idea when he got there, but at that moment, he had caught a Giant Eagle by its neck and was pressing it down into the nest while lying down on its belly to avoid being noticed by the other Giant Eagles.

A faint light flashed and disappeared into the Giant Eagle’s body.

Tiea clearly saw that the Giant Eagle suddenly stopped struggling and a short moment later, it stood up again, spread its wings, and resumed its former aloof appearance, as if nothing had happened.

[He succeeded!]

Tiea’s eyes lit up. The Beast Taming Spell was an extremely oppressive Shamanic Spell, but not only did it consume a lot of Shaman Strength, it was also a Shamanic Spell like Life Chains that could only be mastered by those at the Shaman Grandmaster Realm and above. The conditions to cast it were also extremely harsh.

If one succeeded, he would leave a Brand in the Barbarian Beast’s body and be able to control its life. But if one failed, not only would the Shaman Grandmaster who performed the Beast Taming Spell suffer from a harsh backlash, but the Beast would also die instantly.

Therefore, in general, if one wanted to cast the Beast Taming Spell on a Barbarian Beast, it was better to capture it first and spend some time building a relationship with it to decrease its resistance to its new owner. This was the only way one could have some hope of success.

Basically, taking such a forceful action like what Yang Kai had done would almost always end in failure.

But, contrary to the norm, he actually succeeded.

Even after witnessing tremendous miracles that seemed to occur constantly around this Shaman Niu, Tiea was still dumbstruck.

[Was it just luck?] She wondered. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The next moment, the Giant Eagle subdued by Yang Kai suddenly spread its wings and flew directly towards her side.

After a while, when the Giant Eagle landed in front of her, Yang Kai, who was hiding in its feathers, popped his head out and remarked, “I have a good idea and I need you to cooperate!”

Tiea asked in a daze, “What idea?”

Yang Kai’s eyes flashed, “I want to catch the Eagle King!”

Tiea’s whole face twitched.

But after Yang Kai explained his plan, she changed her mind and thought that it was indeed a good idea too.

After forcibly subduing a Giant Eagle with the Beast Taming Spell, Yang Kai was vaguely aware of the thoughts of this Giant Eagle. From it, Yang Kai learnt that there was an Eagle King in this place. The Eagle King was stronger than all the other Giant Eagles, and they had to submit to it.

If they could dive straight into the enemy’s lair and subdue the Eagle King, they could take away the numerous Giant Eagles here at their convenience.

It was a drastic measure to deal with the situation, but much more efficient than Yang Kai’s previous plan to ambush and subdue Giant Eagles one by one.

The two discussed for a moment and soon finalized their plan.

Then, the Giant Eagle flew up again, with Yang Kai and Tiea hiding on its back. The back of this Barbarian Beast was spacious enough for them to sit side by side easily without falling, and under the cover of its long feathers, Yang Kai and Tiea became all but invisible.
