Chapter 1449, Ruthlessly Exterminate

The yellow-robed old man was already an arrow at the end of its flight, so despite knowing the approaching Golden Blood Thread was a life-threatening attack, he was simply unable to avoid or resist it. He was only able to hurriedly push his Saint Qi to protect himself and pray it would be enough for him to survive.

With a slicing noise, however, the old man’s Saint Qi protection was pierced through like paper and his head was swiftly penetrated by the sharp Golden Blood Thread.

The yellow-robed old man’s lips squirmed as he stared towards Yang Kai in disbelief, seemingly wanting to say something but unable to form any words; soon after his vitality drained from his eyes.

When Yang Kai withdrew his Golden Blood Thread, the old man’s body crumpled to the ground.

Since Yang Kai first rushed his opponent, only half a cup of tea’s worth of time had passed yet the result had already been decided with the yellow-robed old man, who supposedly had higher strength, being the one who fell.

The briefness of this battle and the unexpected end result thoroughly shocked everyone present.

In truth, Yang Kai was also quite surprised. Although Yang Kai didn’t fear a mere Second-Order Origin Realm cultivator and was even confident he could kill one with his current means, from the beginning of this fight until its conclusion, he had not even exerted all his strength; mainly using his Golden Blood Thread and Firebird Artifact Spirit and momentarily activating his Blossoming Lotus Secret Technique once.

It was not that he was trying to conserve or conceal his strength, it was simply that he didn’t need to show any more of his methods.

The Firebird Artifact Spirit was a significant factor in why the yellow-robed old man fell so quickly, however; if it hadn’t devoured the old man’s Heaven Scorching Thunder Fire, causing him heavy losses, it would have been impossible for Yang Kai to have won so easily.

Although the others present were all engaged in their own battles, everyone was still paying attention to the changes in their surroundings, so the death of the old man naturally was not missed by them.

Seeing Yang Kai kill the yellow-robed old man so easily, the burly bald man, Kong Wen Dong, could not help becoming furious while also showing an extremely ugly expression. Even the beautiful young female leader from Ice Heart Valley had a look of dread flash across her face.

She had thought that Yang Kai was not strong, so although she had deliberately tried to win him over, she had not counted on him providing much help, nor had she taken the conditions he previously proposed seriously, but how could she have known that this young man was not only ruthless but also extremely powerful?

However, considering everything, the young woman was far happier than depressed; after all, with a cultivator from Brilliant Flame Sect dead, she was now certain her group would win this battle.

Thinking so, she immediately yelled to Yang Kai, “Little brother, please hurry to assist this Mistress’ sisters!”

“Sure!” Yang Kai nodded casually before turning his eyes to the First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator who had been hit by the woman’s sneak attack earlier.

This man was seriously injured and was being thoroughly suppressed by his opponent from Ice Heart Valley. He was already unable to fight back and was barely able to defend himself, so after seeing the yellow-robed old man die and noticing Yang Kai eyeing him menacingly, how could this man not begin to panic?

With his state of mind thrown into chaos, his strength fell once more, and faced with the fierce assault of his Ice Heart Valley opponent, he actually allowed himself to suffer a hit in order to withdraw from the battle and attempt to escape.

The woman from Ice Heart Valley definitely would not allow her opponent’s plan to succeed and took this opportunity to land a heavy blow with her artifact, opening a giant gash on the fleeing man’s back and causing him to cough up blood and crash to the ground.

This young woman had a beautiful continence and seemed gentle and temperate, but she understood the concept of beating a snake to death to avoid future calamity and immediately stepped forward to deliver a final blow; ending her opponent’s life.

After winning this battle, she and Yang Kai exchanged a glance before both of them flew towards another battlefield.

These two chose was the one where the two Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators were fighting. Originally, this battle had been an even fight, but with Yang Kai and the other First-Order Ice Heart Valley woman joining in, the situation immediately changed.

With the situation becoming a three on one, the female cultivator from Brilliant Flame Sect had no chance of running away, persisting only thirty breaths of time before she was killed by the two women from Ice Heart Valley.

Yang Kai only played a containment role, but his contribution was no less significant!

The state of this battle had changed far faster than anyone expected and Ice Heart Valley grained the absolute upper hand with Yang Kai serving as a lynchpin. Currently, only Kong Wen Dong left of the original group of four from Brilliant Flame Sect.

Seeing that the situation had become hopeless, hatred flashed across the depths of Kong Wen Dong’s eyes as he shouted out fiercely, “Cheap slut, Father will make you pay for this one day!”

Saying so, he made a feint and escaped from the range of the young woman he was fighting, condensed a mighty flame around his body, and shot off towards the distance at incredible speed.

It was impossible to tell what kind of escaping Secret Technique had been used.

In a moment of distraction, the young woman actually allowed Kong Wen Dong to flee several kilometres before her beautiful face darkened.

The last thing she wanted was to allow Kong Wen Dong to escape and call for help, the situation might turn against her again, so she quickly shouted, “Stop him!”

Hearing her cry, the other two Ice Heart Valley women naturally flew off, but Yang Kai simply frowned and stood in place without moving.

Whether Kong Wen Dong lived or died was none of his concern. Yang Kai didn’t know what star Brilliant Flame Sect was based on, so even if he allowed Kong Wen Dong to flee, no harm would come to him. What Yang Kai cared about now was the benefits inside this hidden secluded home. As long as he could break through the barrier protecting this place and obtain the treasures inside, he could just calmly depart.

He had no interest in inserting himself in the grudge between Brilliant Flame Sect and Ice Heart Valley.

Seeing Yang Kai not moving, clearly showing no intention to help, the young woman leader from Ice Heart Sect could not help becoming somewhat flurried, but she quickly thought of something and said, “Kong Wen Dong also has a Heaven Scorching Thunder Fire on him, killing him will allow your Spirit Fire to obtain more benefits!”

Her mind really was quite sharp as it only took her one sentence to arouse Yang Kai’s interest!

“Really?” Yang Kai looked at her suspiciously; after all, that Heaven Scorching Thunder Fire had looked quite powerful so his first thought was that the yellow-robed old man had obtained it through some kind of rare opportunity, therefore, he found it difficult to believe that Kong Wen Dong had one as well.

“How could this Mistress deceive you? I can explain the specific reasons for this later, but believe me when I say Kong Wen Dong definitely has a Heaven Scorching Thunder Fire on him!” Seeing Yang Kai’s look of interest, the young woman immediately knew she had made the right bet and quickly offered her assurances.

“If that’s the case, we really can’t let him run away!” Yang Kai’s eyes flashed before his figure flickered and he suddenly disappeared.

When he reappeared, he was already a few kilometres away.

The young female leader’s eyes shrank when she saw this and her sense of dread increased once more. Even with her cultivation, she was unable to see what kind of miraculous Movement Skill Yang Kai had used to achieve such speed.

This wasn’t surprising since the Space Force Yang Kai cultivated was something very few people could recognize, and even fewer could cultivate to any practical degree. Only if someone like Heaven Battling Union’s Great Elder Mo Xiao Sheng, who also cultivated Space Force, was here would they be able to see through the method Yang Kai had just used.

By applying a small amount of his Space Force, Yang Kai was able to almost instantly cross over a few hundred metres in an instant. Although this method could not compare to tearing space in terms of distance travelled, it was by no means a trivial method as it required very fine control over Space Force. Furthermore, this method was far more subtle than tearing space as it did not create such an obvious disturbance in the surroundings.

Kong Wen Dong’s speed was indeed quite quick, but no matter how fast he was, he still couldn’t compare to Yang Kai who was literally leaping across space.

In just a few dozen breaths, Yang Kai came to a stop in front of Kong Wen Dong and with a wave of his hand sent out a flock of Demonic Flame birds towards him.

“Out of my way, boy!” Kong Wen Dong didn’t even try to hide his anger as he plunged headfirst into Yang Kai’s attack while summoning a large sword artifact into his hand, pouring his Saint Qi into it, and slashing out.

A massive hundred-metre long sword wave shot forward with astonishing momentum.

The Demonic Flame birds were blown away in an instant. Facing such a blow, Yang Kai didn’t dare act carelessly; after all, his opponent’s strength wasn’t by any means weak. Without any hesitation, Yang Kai summoned his Purple Shield and activated its sandstorm ability to protect himself.

A loud noise rang out as the wind and sand were scattered about as the massive sword wave was dispersed, leaving behind a gap in the sandstorm the Purple Shield had created, nearly exposing Yang Kai’s figure.

“An Origin Grade High-Rank defensive artifact?” Kong Wen Dong’s eyes shrank as he exclaimed.

His vision was good so he had no trouble identifying the grade of the Purple Shield.

“For the sins you’ve committed, the Heavens will pass their own judgement, but today, Kong Wen Dong, this will be your burial place!” From behind, a soft shout rang out from the lead Ice Heart Valley woman who had chased after Kong Wen Dong Heart.

Although her speed was slower than that of Yang Kai’s, with the latter having blocked Kong Wen Dong’s way, it wasn’t difficult for her to catch up. Seeing the current situation, the young female leader was overjoyed. She quickly summoned her Origin King Grade Profound Yin Heart Shattering Drum artifact, and used her jade white hand to gently rap it.

An invisible wave spread out from the drum in the next instant, carrying with it a resonant sound. Although this sound was quite faint, when it reached one’s ears, it caused their vitality to tumble, making it incredibly uncomfortable to listen to.

This wasn’t the end though as the young woman’s jade white hand continued to beat this drum slowly, her face becoming paler with each strike, seemingly having to pay a huge price each time she beat this drum. The drumbeat from the Profound Yin Heart Shattering Drum grew louder and louder until it became absolutely deafening, as if it was being struck inside one’s ears, completely impossible to guard against.

Not only did this drum sound effect Kong Wen Dong though, but even Yang Kai was not spared.

As the pounding drum beat entered his ears, Yang Kai’s eyes were gradually turned bloodshot and his face crimson, all the blood in his body seemingly rushing to his head. Sensing this, Yang Kai shot a cold glare towards the approaching young woman.

Even separated by a few thousand metres, this icy glare caused the young woman’s tender body to shiver and she involuntarily paused her assault. When she resumed beating her drum a moment later, the sound in Yang Kai’s ear weakened dramatically, almost to the point where he could ignore it altogether.

Conversely, the pressure Kong Wen Dong was feeling in front of Yang Kai greatly increased. The power of an Origin King Grade artifact was not to be underestimated, and although the young woman had not fully refined the Profound Yin Heart Shattering Drum and could only exert half of its strength, Kong Wen Dong still found it extremely difficult to resist.

Before he even realized it, blood began leaking from Kong Wen Dong’s seven orifices and his aura became disordered, seemingly suffering from unbearable pain; even his well-built body began to tremble violently.

With the young female leader’s Profound Yin Heart Shattering Drum suppressing Kong Wen Dong, Yang Kai was able to act without any scruples, sending out his Golden Blood Thread as well as a few Space Blades concealed inside his Demonic Flames.

At the same time, the Firebird Artifact Spirit was also directed by Yang Kai to rush towards Kong Wen Dong.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
