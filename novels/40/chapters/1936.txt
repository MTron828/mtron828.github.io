Yang Kai could not help but grin when he found out that the Star Chart in his Knowledge Sea somehow connected him with his home Star Field, even allowing him to perceive its location from so far away.

This way, no matter where he was, he would be able to feel the existence of his home so long as he looked up, as if he could see its familiar figure.

This made his heart feel full, so even at this moment, though he was alone, he did not feel isolated.

He did not know if he could still summon the strength of his home star in the Star Boundary.

As the Star Master of Shadowed Star, Yang Kai could summon the strength of Shadowed Star to assist him and increase his strength with a single thought in his native Star Field. Now that he had reached the Star Boundary, he didn’t know if he still had this convenience.

Considering all this, Yang Kai returned his consciousness to his body and stimulated the Star Source of Shadowed Star in his body.

At the same time, he closely stared at the sky up above where his native Star Field was located.

Suddenly, a little light flickered somewhere in that vast nebula and a faint bolt of starlight which seemed to cross over space in an instant shot towards him.

In the blink of an eye, this beam of starlight rushed into Yang Kai’s body.

[It is really possible?] Yang Kai was surprised.

He had only felt a slight whim and tried a small experiment, but Yang Kai had not expected that he could still summon the power of Shadowed Star in the Star Boundary.

However... perhaps because the distance was so great, even if he was able to summon this strength, it had a negligible effect. Once this weak beam of starlight entered him, Yang Kai’s strength essentially didn’t change.

Realizing this, Yang Kai quickly severed his connection with Shadowed Star.

At this moment, he was in an unfamiliar place, and if such an obvious phenomenon continued, it would likely draw unwanted attention.

Yang Kai was faintly regretting his recklessness.

Immediately afterwards, he closed his eyes and began to circulate his Secret Art to refine the medicinal efficacies in his body and replenish the strength he had lost.

The surrounding environment was extremely comfortable. The World Energy here was extremely rich, far more so than in any place in his Star Field. Moreover, the World Energy here seemed subtly different when compared to the Star Field. In this environment, Yang Kai estimated that it would only take a few days for him to restore himself to his peak.

As for what came next, Yang Kai did not have any firm plans, only thinking he needed to quickly search for Gui Zu and the others, especially Liu Yan and Xiao Xiao. Being separated from his two big helpers made Yang Kai feel somewhat anxious for their well-being.

Time passed by in this silent mountain range as there seemed to be no beasts nearby, only the light sound of the wind rustling the nearby leaves broke the stillness of the night.

Suddenly, Yang Kai opened his eyes and stared towards a certain spot in the sky coldly.

There, at some unknown point, a figure had appeared, floating quietly in the air. The moonlight gently fell upon this figure allowing Yang Kai to see her in all her beauty.

“It’s you!” The visitor also looked at Yang Kai with a surprised expression.

“Death!” Yang Kai suddenly shot up from the ground, using his Dragon Transformation Secret Technique instantly, transforming his arm into a golden dragon claw and with a ferocious dragon roar, he violently struck towards this newcomer.

“Wait, wait!” The woman called out in shock while she quickly moved to disperse Yang Kai’s attack, backing away quickly as she called out anxiously, “There’s been a misunderstanding between us!”

Yang Kai did not reply as he struck out with his dragon claw towards the woman’s chest, as if trying to gouge out her heart.

The woman saw this and knit her brow, “Stop this, in your current state, if you exert yourself like this, you’ll only further aggravate your wounds!”

“I don’t need your fake pity!” Yang Kai coldly snorted as he pushed his strength even harder. Space Force began pulsing from his body as it flickered about randomly, instantly breaking through the woman’s defences and allowing him to directly appear beside her.

The woman called out in shock as she swept her hand out and condensed a defensive light to resist Yang Kai’s blow while at the same time withdrawing once again, her beautiful eyes staring at Yang Kai incredulously as she called out, “Even in that state, you still have such power, you’re really not ordinary. No wonder you were able to survive Senior Brother Yin’s assault.”

Yang Kai frowned but did not continue to act.

He had not restored much of his strength yet and clearly couldn’t kill this woman in a short time, so he was at a slight loss about what to do now.

Seeing him calm down, the woman forced out a smile and said, “Can we talk now?”

“If you want to fart, just let it out!” Yang Kai snapped coldly without giving this woman any face.

The other party frowned hearing such crass language directed at her, but although she was a little annoyed, she knew that Yang Kai’s attitude was only natural after what had transpired so she simply said, “You haven’t healed your wounds yet, and I’m also quite afraid of the Emperor Artifact in your hands, so I think it’s best if we can end our hostilities here. As for what happened between us earlier... That was not my intention, I was simply forced to act.”

Yang Kai stared at her coldly for a moment before nodding, “Go on!”

This woman was none other than the female Third-Order Origin King cultivator who was together with Yin Le Sheng in the Starlight Corridor before. At that time, she had teamed up with the bald youth to attack Gui Zu and the others.

Yang Kai had a chance to observe that fight and had noticed at the time that she was different from the bald man in that she had no murderous intent, so after hearing what she said now, he at least somewhat believed her. If it were Yin Le Sheng or the bald man here, Yang Kai would not have bothered even listening to them.

If it were not for these three suddenly attacking them, how could he have been separated from Gui Zu and the others? How could Xiao Xiao and Liu Yan now be forced to wander the world alone?

Yang Kai carried a deep seething hatred towards these three.

“First, allow me to introduce myself. This Mistress is Liu Xian Yun, and like the Senior Brother Yin, I come from the Grand Desolation Star Field,” Liu Xian Yun lightly opened her delicate lips as she gazed towards Yang Kai elegantly.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed slightly before simply spitting, “Yang Kai!”

“So it is Brother Yang!” Liu Xian Yun smiled, “About earlier, let me explain. Although Senior Brother Yin and I indeed come from Grand Desolation Star Field, we are not from the same Sect, nor are we companions. I was simply helpless to disobey him and was forced to act against your companions. For that, this Mistress apologizes.”

“If apologies were useful, why would we bother cultivating?” Yang Kai sneered.

“Think what you like,” Liu Xian Yun smiled flatly. She was also considered to be a peak level figure where she came from; her taking so much time to explain to Yang Kai was simply because she felt guilty about her actions. Yang Kai having resentment was something she could understand.

“Now that Senior Brother Yin is not there, this Mistress doesn’t need to give him any face or act against her conscience, so I think it would be best for us to exchange weapons of war for gifts of jade and silk.”

“Not fighting is fine, as for anything else, I have no interest. I want to heal now and have no time to waste with you,” Yang Kai closed his eyes and said coldly.

Liu Xian Yun smiled and said, “Why must Brother Yang act so distant.”

“How should I act?”

Liu Xian Yun smiled, “Why don’t we cooperate? You and I are both from lower Star Fields, newcomers in this strange place, so working together will benefit both of us. What does Brother Yang think?”

Yang Kai didn’t answer right away as he seriously thought about it.

Liu Xian Yun saw this and quickly continued, “Since I want us to work together, this Mistress will speak frankly. Brother Yang, although you are only a Second-Order Origin King, your strength and ability are far above that of your realm. If it were any of your companions here instead, hehe... this Mistress would have no interest in cooperating with them.”

“Should I feel honoured then?” Yang Kai sneered.

“That’s not what I meant. This Mistress simply doesn’t want to wander the Star Boundary alone, the Star Boundary is much more dangerous than the Star Field after all...”

Hearing this, Yang Kai suddenly became interested, “You know something about the Star Boundary?”

“I don’t know much, but I believe it should be more than you,” Liu Xian Yun smiled slyly.

Yang Kai snorted, “You also know that our Star Field has been closed off for ten thousand years and naturally have very limited information.”

Saying so, he simply sat down cross-legged. Since he was sure that this Liu Xian Yun was not hostile to him, Yang Kai didn’t bother putting up his guard and instead focused on recovering his strength. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“If Brother Yang wants to know what this Mistress knows, I can tell you. Consider it a bit of sincerity from this Mistress,” Seeing Yang Kai relax, Liu Xian Yun realized he was at least willing to hear out her proposal, so she couldn’t help but smile.

“There’s one thing I don’t understand,” Yang Kai said lightly, “How did you find this place?”

“Oh, I came out of the Void Crack nearby, and just saw a beam of starlight fall around here, so I thought some kind of treasure had appeared and came to take a look, but I found Brother Yang healing here instead,” Liu Xian Yun laughed lightly.

Yang Kai instantly looked a bit depressed, realizing that his actions earlier were a bit hair-brained. Fortunately, only Liu Xian Yun had been attracted, if it had been a powerful enemy the consequences would have been disastrous.

“We should find another place to talk then!” Yang Kai pondered for a moment before deciding it wasn’t safe to remain here any longer.

Liu Xian Yun nodded, “Agreed!”

Saying so, the pair flew up into the sky and rushed towards the depths of the mountain range.

Somewhere a few thousand kilometres away, inside a cave, Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun sat facing each other across a dozen meter gap.

Yang Kai went straight to the point and asked, “I have a question I need to ask you.”

“Please feel free, Brother Yang,” Liu Xian Yun lifted her hand and brushed her hair back behind her ear charmingly.

“Why did you think of working with me? We were enemies just a moment ago,” Yang Kai looked directly into her eyes, as if trying to see into the depths of her heart.

Liu Xian Yun smiled lightly and replied, “Because I think Brother Yang is not a wicked person but rather trustworthy.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai sneered.

Liu Xian Yun said sternly, “This Mistress is not a naïve little girl. After living for so many years, I have gained some ability to see through people, and while I dare not say my judgement is always right, this Mistress can at least weigh things fairly. Brother Yang’s previous actions in the Starlight Corridor were all witnessed by this Mistress, so I believe you’re a man of heavy affection and righteousness, on top of being quite capable!”

“The latter being the main point,” Yang Kai spat disdainfully.

Liu Xian Yun nodded and said, “I won’t deny that, but if you weren’t a man of principles, this Mistress wouldn’t have taken the initiative to propose we cooperate.”

“Well, since you are an honest and upfront woman, it would only make me seem petty if I were to continue doubting you,” Yang Kai nodded. “You and I can cooperate, as I also want to know more about the Star Boundary, but you should remember well... If one day you dare to stab me in the back... heh heh heh!”

Yang Kai’s grin caused Liu Xian Yun’s tender to shiver inexplicably, and she quickly nodded with a straight face, “You may rest assured, this Mistress is not someone who engages in treachery.”

“That would be best!”

“So we have a deal?” Liu Xian Yun looked at Yang Kai with a smile.

Yang Kai nodded.
