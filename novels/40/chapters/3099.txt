Inside the control room, the glow of all arrays kept flickering. That was the sign that the Spirit Arrays were about to reach their limits, and cracking sounds could be heard from all directions.

“Patriarch, we can’t continue, otherwise…” One burly man came over with an anxious expression. It was then he realised that they weren’t lucky to have set off on this journey. Instead, it was a journey to Hell.

Yan Luo uttered dispassionately, “Increase speed!”

The burly man’s expression became aghast.

Yan Luo raised his hand and landed a palm on the burly man’s forehead. With his forehead sunken, he fell to the ground without even a sound as fluids leaked out from his seven orifices. The other Yan Family’s disciples were terrified upon seeing that.

“Increase speed!” Yan Luo demanded again.

Not daring to hesitate anymore, all the disciples immediately infused their energy into their respective arrays. The Starship stalled for a moment before its speed picked up.

They were surrounded by lights of different colours, and they couldn’t see any way out. The pressure coming from the Void constantly damaged the Starship’s structure. Although it was an Origin King Grade Mid-Rank Starship, it was still creaking continuously.

A moment later, one of the arrays in the cabin suddenly turned dim, as it had been completely destroyed. At the same time, a part of the Starship began collapsing. As though a chain reaction had been triggered, with the broken part as the centre, the damage rapidly expanded as the Starship started disintegrating.

One by one, all the arrays stopped functioning.

All the Yan Family’s disciples turned completely pale as they turned to look at Yan Luo. Upon seeing that he remained calm and collected, as though he was unperturbed by such a crisis, they began seeing hope again.

[Patriarch will definitely lead us out of this crisis! We’re all selected by him to explore the Ancestral Domain together, so how is it possible that we’ll lose our lives here?]

One hour later, their hope was crushed. Following a loud crash, the Starship completely collapsed.

The pressure from the Void gushed in from all directions, and without the protection of the Starship, there was no way these cultivators who hadn’t reached Origin King Realm could survive.

*Pu, Pu, Pu…*

Just like bubbles that had been poked at, one by one, they exploded as their blood spurted everywhere.

“Patriarch, save us!”

All of them screamed for help. However, Yan Luo ignored them as he made a move, upon which a layer of dark Artifact Armour covered him from head to toe, making him look like an imposing general who was about to storm into their enemy’s territory in ancient times.

At the same time, He Yun Xiang summoned her ribbon artifact.

She had been diligently refining this artifact since she received it, and although she still couldn’t use the Low-Rank Dao Source Grade artifact with ease, it was still useful at this moment. The artifact could be used as a weapon as well as an armour, so it was pretty rare. Moreover, its grade wasn’t too high, so it suited her current cultivation.

The ribbon enlarged and covered her up, as though she had just put on a colourful dress. In an instant, she felt less pressured, upon which she moved closer to Yang Kai as she wouldn’t dare to stay too far away from him.

Yan Luo ran towards them and stood beside He Yun Xiang, his eyes narrowing when he saw the ribbon.

He had sharp vision, so he could see that the ribbon was no ordinary artifact. The artifacts he had seen before were all trash compared to this ribbon. Although he lusted after the artifact, he didn’t let the emotion show on his face.

[I’ll let you keep this treasure for now. It’ll be mine soon!]

A short moment later, the screams for help had died down. It had only been a short while since the Starship broke apart, but the hundreds of Yan Family disciples who had been manning it were all dead. However, Yan Luo remained emotionless, as though the people who had lost their lives were strangers instead of his own people.

He Yun Xiang was shocked as she found him to be too ruthless. Although she had killed countless people before, she could never be as cold-hearted as he was.

In this endless Void, there was no way to navigate as all they could see were vivid and colourful lights. It was the first time Yan Luo and He Yun Xiang experienced this, but they soon pushed it to the back of their mind as they explored the wonder around them.

Yang Kai was walking at the front, still not revealing any aura fluctuations from his body, but the horrifying pressure didn’t even make him frown.

The world was utterly silent, to the point where their heartbeats could be heard clearly.

Yan Luo felt that something was off, because it had been a safe journey so far without encountering any dangers or accidents.

500 years ago, the Old Ancestor embarked on a journey to the Ancestral Domain. Outsiders didn’t know whether he had succeeded, but Yan Luo knew that he had reached the Ancestral Domain. That was because three months after the Old Ancestor left home, Yan Luo used the Secret Technique left behind by the Old Ancestor to contact him. At that time, the Old Ancestor told him all about his journey to the Ancestral Domain. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

According to the Old Ancestor, this colourful Void that they were passing through now was extremely dangerous. If they were not careful enough, they would be crushed to pieces. A lot of inconspicuous dangers were hiding in this seemingly beautiful world.

Yan Luo had gotten himself ready as he remained vigilant at all times, because he was worried that danger would befall him all of a sudden.

However, since the beginning, the journey had been smooth sailing, as though they were taking a stroll in their back garden. There didn’t seem to be any danger at all.

It was impossible for the Old Ancestor to lie to him, so they were either unbelievably lucky, or the strange young man leading them forward was somehow helping them avoid all the dangers, which was why they were safe now.

Yan Luo hoped that the former was the reason, for if it was the latter, then it would be too horrifying. Maybe the plot they had come up with wasn’t the right decision. At that instant, he began feeling apprehensive.

There was nothing around them that could be used as a reference, so they didn’t know how far they had gone. Yan Luo’s Artifact Armour appeared dim, so it was apparent that it had lost most of its spirituality. Nevertheless, he was well prepared, so he immediately changed into a new Artifact Armour.

On the other hand, He Yun Xiang had expended a lot of her energy as she had to use her Saint Qi to sustain the ribbon’s defensive capabilities. It was already difficult for her to use a Dao Source Grade artifact when she was just a newly promoted Third-Order Origin King, so it was expected that she couldn’t persevere for too long.

Despite feeling reluctant, she still fished out a Spirit Pill from her Space Ring and took it, after which she shuddered as a warm stream expanded from her abdomen and spread towards all her bones and organs. In an instant, her Saint Qi, which was about to be exhausted soon, was replenished significantly. The medicinal efficacy, however, was too potent, meaning she couldn’t quickly refine and absorb it, so most of it was wasted.

[All the things Sir has given me are so valuable!] There certainly wasn’t any Spirit Pill in Unending Star Field that was comparable to the one she had just consumed. She didn’t even know the pill’s name, all she knew was that it could help replenish her energy. Yang Kai had given it to her together with the Source Condensing Pills some time ago.

As time passed, they slowly grew tired of the magnificent view. The three of them were like lonely travellers in the desert, not knowing where their destination was. Yan Luo’s expression had turned from hopeful to dejected, while He Yun Xiang was anxious as well. Only Yang Kai remained unperturbed, and even his pace hadn’t changed one bit.

Just then, Yang Kai suddenly arched his brow and turned to speak to He Yun Xiang, “We’ll be there soon.”

Upon hearing that, He Yun Xiang was startled for a moment before she became elated.

Yan Luo hurriedly raised his head and saw that there was a different view in the distance. In an instant, he was over the moon, because he had no more Artifact Armours left. The one on his body now was the last set. If they still couldn’t reach the Ancestral Domain by the time it became damaged, he would have no choice but to ask for Yang Kai’s protection.

Fortunately, their destination was now in sight, so his perseverance so far was worth it.

Without uttering a word, they accelerated their pace at the same time.

One day later, a five-coloured swirl appeared before their eyes. The swirl was stationery in an eerie manner. Standing in front of the swirl, the three of them looked as insignificant as dust.

Yan Luo was so agitated that his lips began trembling. He looked fixedly at the swirl, as though he could penetrate the barrier of space and see the view on the other side.

He Yun Xiang’s gaze brightened as well. Just three months ago, she would never have imagined that this would happen to her one day. The Ancestral Domain was just one step away from her. This was the dream countless people had been pursuing for their entire lives, but she would be able to reach it soon.

Both of them turned to look at Yang Kai, only to be surprised to see that he had closed his eyes as he was quietly standing there. Neither of them dared to disturb him.

Moments later, he opened his eyes and uttered, “Let’s go.”

Then, he directly stepped into the stationery five-coloured swirl.

Dawdling no further, Yan Luo and He Yun Xiang immediately followed in his footsteps, upon which a feeling of weightlessness engulfed them.

In an instant, they felt dizzy, and their hearts throbbed uncontrollably. Unexpectedly, they could hear some voices around them. They tried to listen to them, but they couldn’t make out what those people were saying because their ears were ringing.

Only Yang Kai appeared speechless as he looked around.

On his way to his destination, he had thought about what it would look like, but when he finally reached this place, he realized that it was quite different from his imagination.

He wasn’t disappointed, but the sight before his eyes just felt off.

“Hey, there are new people.”

“Wow, there are three people in one go. What Star Field are they from?”

“One of them will go to Sky Pavilion.”

“Surname Liu, who do you think you are? Why must one of them go to your place? Have you even asked if we agree?”

“So what if you don’t agree? Are you going to fight with me?”

“Come then! I’m not afraid of you!”

“Regardless of what you think, one of them will go to Starry Mountain!”

“The remaining one will go to Holy Mountain Peak, then.”

“Are all of you cracking jokes?”

“I’m serious.”

“Your mother!”

“Why are you scolding me?”

It seemed that the situation was out of control because of the arrival of Yang Kai and the others, leaving him dumbfounded at the sight.

“Silence! All of you making such a fuss here before these new arrivals is highly improper! Acting so immaturely will only make them look down on us! Don’t you know the rules? We should ask about where they’re from first,” an old man with a sallow face suddenly uttered. The old man appeared authoritative among this group. His figure was thin, but his eyes were very energetic. There was a pipe in his hand as smoke was rising from the chamber. After he finished speaking, all of them fell silent and looked fixedly at Yang Kai and the others.
