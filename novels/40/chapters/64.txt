Chapter 65 - Wei Zhuan

Apart from these two groups of people, there were quite a few Sky Tower disciples encircling the fighters to view the theatrics. The number of these unrelated bystanders was not little as they pointed with their fingers at the ongoing duel.

Bringing with him a few doubts, Kai Yang broke through the crowd to slowly walk over to Li Yun Tian.

He saw that Su Mu had a bloody nose and swollen face, he was cutting quite the sorry figure as he was facing a youngster who couldn’t be much older than him. The youngster was very calm and composed, without a single sign on injury on his body as he smiled at Su Mu with a contemptuous look. As he effortlessly blocked Su Mu’s attacks, he was also provoking him. And as Su Mu yelled loudly, he jumped forward but his attack was easily countered.

After watching for a while, Kai Yang’s eyebrows creased because he saw that it wasn’t because Su Mu’s attacks didn’t hit that youngster, but rather Su Mu’s attack had no effect even when they hit. When Su Mu’s fist landed, that youngster didn’t even bat an eyelid, while Su Mu on the other hand received some light injuries.

Between the two, the difference in World Qi energy fluctuations was quite small, in other words, their strengths were about equal. How could their be such a large disparity when they battled?

“What’s going on?” Kai Yang patted Li Yun Tian’s shoulder as he asked.

Turning around, Li Yun Tian’s face turned joyous as he replied: “Senior brother Kai!”

Hearing this shout, Zhou Hu and the others saw Kai Yang and went to greet him before turning around to re-face the people facing them.

“How come Su Mu is not his opponent?” Kai Yang voiced his puzzlement, “Their strengths should be about the same?”

Li Yun Tian immediately nodded his head, however his expression fell: “En, Young Master Su is currently at the initial element second stage while that person is at the initial element third stage. If you really wanted this to be fair, then you would have to say Young Master Su is not exactly his opponent, so he would not have an easy time. But this person is despicable to the extreme. As fellow disciples when we are exchanging notes and during our duels we do not use any treasures or artifacts, however he actually dared to wear a defensive artifact. How can Su Mu’s attacks show their might?”

When he heard this, Kai Yang expression showed his contemplation: “Defensive artifact?”

“Right.” Li Yun Tian clenched his teeth: “He is the Grand Elder’s flesh and blood grandson, he is called Wei Zhuan. His defensive artifact was given to him personally by the Grand Elder.”

“Another second generation master?” Slowly things became clear. Behind Su Mu, there was an Elder and this Wei Zhuan was the grandson of the Grand Elder. Both had powerful backings, their positions were about the same, so if others didn’t dare to fight Su Mu, that did not mean that Wei Zhuan didn’t dare. But wearing a defensive artifact was a bit unfair.

“The Grand Elder and the Second Elder were never on good terms, so much so that even Su Mu and this Wei Zhuan held unfavourable impressions of each other. Now that he has this opportunity, he definitely plans on teaching Su Mu a ruthless lesson.” Li Yun Tian was secretly worried.

Kai Yang oh-ed out: “So it was just some boring and senseless internal strife.”

“Senior brother Kai, please think of a way to save Young Master Su. You know his character, if he continues like this, then he will receive heavy injuries. ”

Kai Yang remained calm: “The exchange of notes between Main Gate disciples, if you are not up to par with them then you are beaten up alittle. Are you saying that Sky Tower disciples are afraid of this?”

“But this duel wasn’t fair from the start, and Wei Zhuan is hiding behind the might of his defensive artifact.”

Kai Yang coolly laughed: “This world was never fair! The strong prey on the weak, the strong are respected. You guys should already know all of this.”

(TL: GG, Kai Yang giving us valuable life lessons. Listen well to Shi-fu Kai.)

Li Yun Tian became speechless, left at a loss for words.

In the exchange of notes between Main Gate disciples, they weren’t able to intervene. Although Kai Yang’s actions were fierce in the past, even he couldn’t disobey school rules, so how could they expect him to go and save Su Mu like last time?

On the battleground, Su Mu was already on the verge of collapse and his attacks no longer had much strength behind them. Wei Zhuan was laughing out loud, exceptionally pleased with this outcome. Hitting his chest proudly he said: “Su Mu don’t be polite, please come over. This young master is feeling very generous today, for I will not move from this spot at all. And if you are able to hurt me, then it will be my loss.”

Su Mu’s eye’s blurred, both his fists had smears of red blood over them. The defensive artifact that Wei Zhuan wore not only had defensive properties, it could also deflect World Qi imbued attacks, causing Su Mu’s every attack to rebound back on him with at least half the original strength. The injuries on his fists were caused from this.

Hearing Wei Zhuan’s arrogant words, Su Mu spat out some blood as he retorted full of contempt: “If you have the guts then take off that turtle shell you’re wearing. If this young master doesn’t beat you until you can only crawl, then you aren’t my grandson!”

(TL: So insulting Su Mu. o.o)

Wei Zhuan’s expression became frosty and sinister. Laughing evilly: “No small amount of courage! You actually dared to take advantage of me! You will pay for your words!”

Wei Zhuan was clearly enraged, three steps, two steps, he rushed towards Su Mu. Throwing out a punch at Su Mu’s cheek, Su Mu could only attempt to block with his hands. But his strength was already incomparable to his opponent, so he couldn’t defend against it. As the punch landed, it immediately caused his cheek to swell up, and his head to turn one hundred and eighty degrees.

Wei Zhuan was imposing like a tiger, walking forward he kicked out and kicked Su Mu to the ground before throwing both his fists down.

Su Mu used all his strength to resists but to no avail. The defensive artifact that Wei Zhuan wore clearly held many uses and wasn’t something Su Mu could contend against with his current strength.

“Call me grandfather and this young master will spare you!” After hitting him for a while, Wei Zhuan paused to say this.

Su Mu coolly looked up, smiling with disgust evident in his eyes.

Last time, Su Mu narrowly avoided Cheng Shao Feng smashing a stone into his head, but he still hadn’t yielded. How could he surrender this time?

“You make me laugh!” Wei Zhuan didn’t hesitate and resumed hitting Su Mu, Su Mu’s teeth went flying and his nose started to overflow with blood causing his appearance to be quite pitiful.

This Wei Zhuan’s hands were very fierce, even more so than Cheng Shao Feng’s had been.

“Young master Su!” Li Yun Tian and the others could no longer bear it, but as they took a step forward they realised they couldn’t do anything more, because the Main Gate rules could not be violated.

Wei Zhuan didn’t continue but instead turned to sneer at Li Yun Tian and the rest, he he saying: “You want to save him?”

Li Yun Tian and the others didn’t reply but took in deep breaths, full of resentment.

“I asked, do you want to save him?” He slapped his hand across Su Mu’s face as he asked again evilly.

Seeing Su Mu being attacked again, they nodded their heads but were afraid that he was scheming something.

“The kneel down! Obediently kowtow a few times and if this lord is feeling good, then I shall spare him today!” Since Wei Zhuan couldn’t deal with Su Mu completely, he turned towards Li Yun Tian and the others. Since they were Su Mu’s underlings, if they were humiliated, then it was equal to humiliating Su Mu.

Hearing this, the people there went into an uproar while Li Yun Tian and the rest became ashen faced, humiliated to the extreme.

Su Mu struggled to look towards them, and with his broken teeth he said: “Do not listen to him!”

“Pa” it rang out as Su Mu received another slap. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Li Yun Tian and the others turned pale in fright because they knew that if they hesitated any further, Su Mu would only suffer more. Faces full of despair, they slowly knelt to the ground.

Kai Yang looked at them in astonishment, because he would never have imagined that they would go to such an extent for Su Mu. Was there gold underneath their knees, if their relationship wasn’t close, who would do this for someone?

Originally Kai Yang thought that Li Yun Tian and the others followed behind the second generation Su Mu to earn some benefits, but that was clearly not the case.

Wei Zhuan’s eyes narrowed and he suddenly laughed loudly. Towering over them, he looked down at Su Mu: “You couldn’t tell that these dogs you trained were so obedient.”

From the corners of Su Mu’s eyes, leaked out two strands of tears, tears of humiliation! Even when he was beaten by Wei Zhuan to such an extent, he had yet to shed any tears, but now when he saw Li Yun Tian and the others kneeling on the ground, he couldn’t restrain those tears.

p.s. Hey, so not anything long because it’s already 1.24am here so this is my yesterday’s regular release. Will start my today’s chapter, after I get some rest. But Wei Zhuan is a jackass and should go die and end his arc. Also, just wondering, if you guys have any good chinese dramas to recommend like this one, then please tell me because I’m in the mood for some dramas. Now good night. 😀
