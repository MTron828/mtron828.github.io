However, with Yang Kai fiercely fighting back, he had eventually won the right to manage the Star City in High Heaven Territory, which was what he had expected.

Although it would be exhausting to manage such a big Star City, there were a lot of benefits to be gained.

With such power in possession, those from High Heaven Palace could get 5% of the Star City’s profit. Although 5% sounded like a small figure, it had to be noted that the remaining 95% was shared by all 108 great forces.

In comparison, 5% was a lot.

Xu Ling Gong had also told Yang Kai not to underestimate 5% of profit as it might even surpass what he could get from the Star City in Void Territory.

However, with the Star Boundary as the centre, Yang Kai had to build Space Arrays at the Star City and the Territory Gate of High Heaven Territory so that they could move around swiftly.

Those were the concessions both parties had to make as mentioned by Xu Ling Gong.

High Heaven Palace had gained the most benefits since they had the right to manage the Star City; nevertheless, Yang Kai had to be responsible for arranging the Space Arrays.

A sulky Yang Kai rebuked, “I don’t mind arranging the Space Arrays, but the ordinary ones cannot transfer people across such a long distance. Once it’s too far, the arrays cannot be connected. I can arrange the Arrays that could send people from the Territory Gate to the Star Boundary, but we’d have to draw on the power of the Star Boundary to make that happen. On that note, there’s one thing I don’t understand. Why don’t we just build a Universe Temple in High Heaven Territory instead of asking me to arrange special Space Arrays!”

Every Great Territory had at least one Universe Temple that served as a resting place for cultivators. It could also help them save time on travelling.

However, there wasn’t a Universe Temple in High Heaven Territory since it didn’t even have a name in the Universe Chart previously.

Xu Ling Gong replied calmly, “It’s not that they don’t want to build a Universe Temple here, it’s that they can’t. The Universe Temples left behind in the Great Territories are all from ancient times. No one from the Cave Heavens and Paradises is able to build a Universe Temple now.”

Yang Kai was stunned, “There are things that the Cave Heavens and Paradises can’t do?”

Xu Ling Gong said, “Universe Temples are essentially enhanced versions of Space Arrays, so mastery in the Dao of Space to build them. No one can build a Universe Temple without such skill. You might not be aware of it, but there are some Universe Temples in several Great Territories that have become dilapidated and lost their functions. Although we’ve been trying to restore them, it’s been to no avail. Not many people in the 3,000 Worlds know how to use Space Principles, let alone have mastery of them.”

Yang Kai fell into his thoughts.

Knowing what was on the other man’s mind, Xu Ling Gong continued, “I know what you’re thinking. You want to study the mysteries of the Universe Temples, right?”

Yang Kai nodded, “It’d be for the best if there’s such a chance.” Universe Temples certainly contained the secrets of the Grand Dao of Space. If he could study them carefully, he would gain immense benefits as well.

Xu Ling Gong replied with a smile, “Just wait. I’ve reported this matter to the Sect Master, and he’ll make the arrangements. However, you’re not from one of the Cave Heavens or Paradises, so I cannot be sure whether you’ll have a chance to look into the Universe Temples. The decision will have to be made by the higher-ups.”

Yang Kai frowned, “Why are you all so cautious about it? Everyone will benefit if the Universe Temples are restored.”

Following a sigh, Xu Ling Gong replied, “What you can see is not the complete picture of the 3,000 Worlds. You have no right to know many things now. When you become strong enough one day, you’ll find out. Now, I can only tell you that the mystery of Universe Temples has far-reaching implications. If we’re not careful, we might cause a disaster for the 3,000 Worlds.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

An astounded Yang Kai looked dazedly at Xu Ling Gong, but he didn’t think the latter was exaggerating.

“What do you think about creating the Space Arrays?” Xu Ling Gong urged, “Those shameless old people have asked me to persuade you. Just tell me right away whether you’ll agree to it.”

Yang Kai snorted, “In order to send people from the Territory Gate to the Star Boundary, the Space Arrays would be immense and costly. High Heaven Palace and Void Land can’t possibly afford it.”

Xu Ling Gong scoffed, “Stingy brat. Don’t worry, you’ll not pay anything for the materials.”

Yang Kai nodded, “That’s more like it. However, the distance between the Territory Gate and the Star Boundary is too far. Even if they could be connected by Space Arrays, it would still require the power of the Star Boundary to make it happen. The heritage of the Star Boundary would suffer a slight loss every time the arrays were used; therefore, even if the arrays are successfully built, they can’t be used for free. For every transfer, High Heaven Palace will collect a certain fee.”

Xu Ling Gong snorted, “Not only do you possess Void Star City and 5% of High Heaven Star City, you also have the resources of the New Great Territory as a backup. I can’t believe you’re still trying to profit from the Space Arrays.”

Yang Kai grinned meaningfully, “Haven’t you heard that many grains of sand can build a tower? You can never underestimate the amount of money something will generate. Martial Uncle Xu, you’re not responsible for managing a Sect, so you have no idea how difficult it is to run one.”

After giving it a thought, Xu Ling Gong replied, “Give some free quotas to the Cave Heavens and Paradises every year. Within those quotas, they won’t be charged a fee. Anyone who exceeds the quotas will have to pay the same fee as outsiders.”

Yang Kai pondered on it for a moment and replied, “Good.”

“Write down the materials needed to arrange the arrays and give the list to me later. I’ll ask them to share the cost.”

With a smile, Yang Kai fished out a jade slip and passed it to him, “Here.”

Seeing that this boy was already prepared, Xu Ling Gong rolled his eyes, and upon looking into the jade slip, he did so again.

Even though he had no idea how many materials were needed to arrange these Space Arrays, it was obvious Yang Kai was trying to get more than what was required.

Without pointing it out though, he stored the jade slip and left. He was obviously going to ask the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters to share the cost.

Xu Ling Gong was pretty efficient as he passed Yang Kai a Space Ring three days later. Yang Kai directly stored the ring without looking into it, then he returned to the Star Boundary. After bringing Luan Bai Feng and some people with him, he headed straight to the first Territory Gate.

Fortunately, before the epic battle against Heavenly Sword Union, he had left behind many Space Beacons around High Heaven Territory. Therefore, they didn’t really have to fly over as they soon reached the Territory Gate by making use of those Space Beacons.

Arranging Space Arrays was like a walk in the park for Yang Kai. However, the one he was building was much larger than any array he had arranged before, and it would require a lot of materials.

Working for a full month, the gigantic array finally took shape near the Territory Gate.

Without taking a rest, he headed straight to the Star Boundary and found a suitable location before working on a corresponding Space Array.

Since this array was connected to the Star Boundary, it would draw on the Universe World’s immense World Force every time it was used. Otherwise, it couldn’t be linked to the array at the Territory Gate that was trillions of kilometres away.

Yang Kai wasn’t lying when he said to Xu Ling Gong that the heritage of the Star Boundary would be used every time the array was used. It was the truth.

However, only a small amount of heritage would be needed. With the continuous nourishment from the World Tree, the consumption was essentially negligible.

Ten days later, the array in the Star Boundary was completed. Yang Kai then headed to the Star City. This time, it only took him one day to finish building a new Space Array.

Hence, the arrays that connected the Territory Gate to the Star Boundary and then led to the Star City had been completed. The presence of these arrays could allow cultivators to move around easily. Otherwise, when the visitors arrived at High Heaven Territory, it would take them about half a month to go from the Territory Gate to the Star City.

During this period of time, the Star City had also been completed. The Cave Heavens and Paradises as well as High Heaven Palace had selected the best locations to open their shops, while the rest of the land was rented out.

Some astute business people had started asking about the Star City as they were apparently ready to start businesses there. However, since Yang Kai hadn’t come up with a framework to manage the Star City, he decided to ignore them for now.

Void Star City was currently managed by Mo Mei, a Sixth-Order Master, and since High Heaven Star City was much larger, the person in charge naturally couldn’t be weak.

Yang Kai intended to select one of the Great Emperors from the Star Boundary.

The Great Emperors also had the ability to borrow World Strength from the Star Boundary. Given the powerful heritage of the Star Boundary, after borrowing its World Force, they could exert the might of the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm. They would certainly be less powerful than Yang Kai, but that was because their heritages were weaker to begin with.

Only by doing so could they have a better control over High Heaven Star City. The reason Yang Kai decided to build the Star City near the Star Boundary was that the Great Emperor in charge of the city would be able to draw on the power of the Star Boundary.

Since he now had some free time, Yang Kai gathered all the Great Emperors together and told them about his plans, and after he finished, everyone turned to look at Duan Hong Chen at the same time.

Bustling World Great Emperor chuckled, “Well, it seems that I’ll have to take up the responsibility.”

The decision was made just like that. Bustling World Great Emperor would become the Governor of High Heaven Star City. Even though it might occupy some of his cultivation time, there shouldn’t be a problem as long as he could manage his time well.

On the day the Star City opened for business, innumerable merchants streamed into the city as they continuously knocked on the door of the Governor’s Mansion.

Meanwhile, in a Universe World in the New Great Territory, Yang Kai was seated across from Wu Kuang. It had been a few years since they last met, and Wu Kuang had become even more formidable. Perhaps it was because he had swallowed the heritages of a few Sixth-Order Masters that he was unable to fully conceal his aura now and was shrouded in Demon Qi.

There were some living creatures in this Universe World, but none of them had any sentience. It was obvious that it had been a short time since they were born, and the environment was hostile as the place was covered in a sandstorm.

However, Wu Kuang didn’t mind it at all as he decided to settle down here.

Yang Kai gazed at him and asked, “What are your future plans?”

Wu Kuang was holding a wine bottle given to him by Yang Kai as he leaned against a chair. His demeanour didn’t look like that of a senior expert. As he raised the bottle and let the wine flow into his mouth, he replied nonchalantly, “I’ll keep hiding for a few years and digest what I’ve eaten.”

Yang Kai nodded, “That’s for the best. More than a hundred High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters have gathered together in the Star Boundary. They’ll notice you as soon as you show up, and they’ll definitely try to kill you. Nevertheless, it’s not like you can keep hiding forever. You’ll have to go out one day.”

Wu Kuang shot him a glance, “Don’t worry. Since this King has tasted so many palatable dishes, I can never go back to having coarse food. Anyone that’s lower than the Fifth-Order will be tasteless to me, not to mention the lowly living beings in those Universe Worlds.”
