Yang Kai moved towards the fluctuations and manipulated Space Principles. To him, the almost indiscernible traces were as conspicuous as a beacon of light in the darkness.

In front of everyone’s eyes, he extended his hands into the Void, which started melting away.

Space Principles surged as he forcefully separated his hands.

World Force came right at his face as the portal to a Sealed World was opened.

Cha Hu arched his brow at the sight, thinking that the younger man was truly a master in the Dao of Space. He couldn’t even detect the portal to the Sealed World, but Yang Kai was able to easily open it.

The Squad Leaders, who were standing on the deck of Dawning Light, were staring at the portal with fervent gazes. Human soldiers were always keen on exploring Sealed Worlds. First of all, compared to the hostile environment on the Black Ink Battlefield, there usually wouldn’t be any dangers in a Sealed World. Secondly, every Sealed World would have some good stuff inside. Even though they wouldn’t always get Profound Yin Spirit Fruits, there would certainly be a lot of herbs that could be used to make Spirit Pills.

They would also acquire some Military Merits by exploring these Sealed Worlds and harvesting some treasures.

Cha Hu swept a glance over them and asked, “Do any of you want to look into it?”

“Me!”

“I’m willing to explore it!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

At that moment, the place was bustling with noises as the Squad Leaders fought for the chance.

Cha Hu raised his hand, after which everyone fell silent. He then pointed at the Squad Leader nearest to him and said, “You’ll go in with your Squad. However, regardless of what you get, you have to share half of the Military Merits with Dawn.”

Upon hearing that, the Squad Leader nodded, “Alright.”

Yang Kai was the one who opened the portal to the Sealed World. Supposedly, the members of Dawn had discovered this Sealed World, and they had the right to explore it; however, since Cha Hu had given the order, this Squad had the chance to get some benefits. It was totally reasonable to share half of the Military Merits with Dawn.

“If there’s any danger, inform me immediately!” Cha Hu ordered.

The Squad Leader cupped his fists, “Yes.”

Things wouldn’t always go well every time they explored a Sealed World. There might be some unexpected danger.

The Squad Leader gathered his members and then flew into the Sealed World.

The other Squad Leaders stared at them with envious expressions.

Cha Hu turned to Yang Kai, “Try looking for more Sealed Worlds nearby.”

Upon receiving the order, Yang Kai wandered around the area.

After hearing Cha Hu’s explanation about the origin of the Sealed Worlds, Yang Kai was curious whether they really were clustered just like mushrooms.

He happened to discover something when he passed by this place previously, but he had not looked into it carefully. Now that he started exploring the area, he soon found another portal to a Sealed World.

Just like the previous Sealed World, there were only faint Space Principle fluctuations. If he hadn’t intently searched for it, he would have missed it.

Yang Kai made a move again and opened the portal, after which another Squad went inside.

About a cup of tea stick later, he found two more portals to the Sealed Worlds, which were not far away from the second one.

If the speculation that Cha Hu had mentioned was right, it meant that in this region of the void, the ancient Great Experts had clashed with the Black Ink Clan. A lot of powerful cultivators were killed, and the Small Universes that they left behind formed into a cluster of Sealed Worlds as time passed.

It had been less than an hour since Yang Kai arrived at this place, and he had already found four portals. Obviously, there were even more Sealed Worlds that were yet to be discovered.

As he focused on looking for them, he soon found even more Sealed Worlds.

One day later, all eight Squads on Dawning Light had left to explore the Sealed Worlds. Other than the people who had to stand guard, the members of Dawn had also been divided into two teams, which were respectively led by a Seventh-Order Master, and gone to explore two Sealed Worlds.

Four to five days later, Yang Kai returned to Dawning Light and reported to Cha Hu, “Sir, I’ve explored every corner of this area. There are 11 Sealed Worlds in total, and all the portals have been opened.”

Cha Hu praised him by saying, “You’ve done a great job.”

11 Sealed Worlds would mean tremendous benefits to Humans. A lot of useful herbs and Profound Yin Spirit Fruits would be found in this place.

This cluster of Sealed Worlds could be considered quite large. The best record found in Blue Sky Pass was that they had discovered 7 Sealed Worlds in a particular area in the past.

In order to open those portals, the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters had to take action personally, unlike how easy it was for Yang Kai.

With an expert in the Dao of Space around, they wouldn’t miss any hidden Sealed Worlds in this place.

An idea flashed through Cha Hu’s mind as he thought about it. Previously, they had found a lot of Sealed Worlds in many areas around Blue Sky Pass, but due to limited means, they hadn’t necessarily uncovered all the hidden Sealed Worlds. Perhaps there were Sealed Worlds that were yet to be discovered in those places. If they brought Yang Kai to where Sealed Worlds had been found in the past, they might get some pleasant surprises.

He decided to deal with this matter after they were done with the work here.

They would take up some of Yang Kai’s time, but this kind of sacrifice was nothing compared to the rewards they would get.

A considerate Cha Hu said, “We’ll stay here for quite some time. Since you’re free, you can cultivate on your own or explore the Sealed Worlds freely. This King will stand guard on Dawning Light, so you don’t have to worry about anything.”

After giving it a thought, Yang Kai replied, “I’ll go explore a Sealed World, then.”

“En.” Cha Hu nodded, then shouted, “Bai Yi!”

“Yes.” Bai Yi took a step forward.

“Follow your Senior Brother Yang so that you two can take care of each other.”

“Yes.”

Yang Kai didn’t object to it as he shot out of Dawning Light with her and led the way. Soon, they arrived at a Sealed World’s portal.

He activated Space Principles to engulf Bai Yi and crashed into the Sealed World.

A sense of dizziness came over them, but they soon recovered from it. What came into their sight was endless greenery.

This kind of greenery was exceptionally rare on the Black Ink Battlefield where the environment was incredibly hostile. All Universe Worlds were shrouded in Death Qi without a hint of greenery, and eerie Black Ink Clouds loomed everywhere in the void.

Therefore, both Bai Yi and Yang Kai felt refreshed the instant they saw such a beautiful sight.

In this kind of environment, there were surely a lot of Spirit Herbs.

That was indeed the case. Yang Kai soon found a red flower the size of a washbasin in a nearby place. There were seven golden dots on the flower petals that formed into an abstruse pattern.

Yang Kai couldn’t recognise the flower. Although he had studied Alchemic Dao for a time, he stopped improving on it after he left the Star Boundary. He couldn’t recognise all of the Spirit Flowers in the 3,000 Worlds, let alone the ones on the Black Ink Battlefield; however, he still instinctively felt that this red flower was a kind of Spirit Herb.

On the other hand, Bai Yi directly told him the flower’s name, “It’s a Seven Stars Red Rain Flower.”

“You can recognise it?” Yang Kai was surprised.

Bai Yi nodded, “It’s the main ingredient for making the Seven Stars Pill. You should have seen it on the list of resources in the War Materials Hall.”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai replied, “I’ve exchanged for some Seven Stars Pills before.”

Seven Stars Pills were wonderful healing medicines. When he saw the pills in the War Materials Hall, he decided to obtain some of them. After the battle against Zhu Feng previously, he consumed some of those pills, and they were truly effective. He still had two Seven Stars Pills with him.

“So, you’re an expert in Alchemic Dao,” Admiration was written all over Yang Kai’s face.

Bai Yi burst into laughter, “I’m not an Alchemist of any sort; however, I did have some experience in exploring Sealed Worlds. The Alchemists from the Inner Sanctum have written up a manual that describes the appearances, harvesting techniques, and uses of some herbs. I have read the manual, so I can remember them.”

It required some special techniques when picking certain herbs. If they did it without much thought, they might damage the medicinal efficacies. Taking that into consideration, the Alchemists from the Inner Sanctum decided to create instruction manuals that recorded the herbs found in Sealed Worlds on the Black Ink Battlefield and distributed them to the soldiers so that they wouldn’t be rough to the good stuff they found.

Yang Kai suggested by saying, “Since you can recognise it, I’ll let you pick it, then.”

Bai Yi nodded and picked the flower. Fortunately, it didn’t require any special skills for picking Seven Stars Red Rain Flowers, so she soon acquired it.

After they obtained the flower, they were looking forward to getting more rewards in this Sealed World.

Following a brief discussion, they decided to split up while ensuring there was only a distance of 50 kilometres between them. At such a distance, if one of them fell into danger, the other could come to the rescue immediately.

Bai Yi also passed Yang Kai the manual that was made by the Alchemist from the Inner Sanctum.

Yang Kai flipped through it and soon remembered its content.

As he passed through the dense forest, he released his Divine Sense so that he could immediately detect any Spirit Herbs nearby.

It seemed the environment in this Sealed World was quite suitable for the growth of herbs, and after just half a day, Yang Kai had acquired more than 100 herbs and kept them inside his Small Universe. When he returned to Blue Sky Pass, he could hand them in for Military Merits.

Unfortunately, he hadn’t found any Profound Yin Spirit Fruits.

With that said, he wasn’t disappointed, for not every Sealed World had Profound Yin Spirit Fruits. He had opened 11 portals, so there must be Profound Yin Spirit Fruits in some of the Sealed Worlds.

While looking for herbs, Yang Kai was also inspecting this Sealed World.

Gradually, he realised that Cha Hu’s speculation about the origin of the Sealed Worlds could very well be right. Fundamentally, these Sealed Worlds were the same as the Universe Paradises and Cave Heavens left behind by Human Masters after their deaths in ancient times.

However, the way the Great Experts cultivated back then might be a little different from the current cultivators, so the Small Universes they had left behind were distinct.

Another half a day later, Yang Kai had acquired a lot of good things.

Presently, he was moving towards a place where there was a lot of World Energy. He could sense that there was some kind of potent Spirit Medicine over there.

He soon found a plant that was half the height of a Human. Some fruits the size of baby fists were seen hanging on the branches.
