*Hong hong hong…*

The swords rained down and exploded against Yang Kai’s body, causing sparks to fly in all directions. The forty-five-metre tall behemoth swayed as it was struck by the forces that came from all directions, looking as if it might collapse at any time.

*Chi chi chi…*

He grimaced in pain when the attacks began to draw blood. It made his monstrous face look quite hideous and terrifying. Even so, Yang Kai remained in place without moving. Curling up into a ball, he exposed his back and protected Lin Yun’er from even the slightest harm.

“Uncle Yang!” Lin Yun’er lifted her head, shock and surprise flashing in her eyes. She had not expected him to change so drastically in the blink of an eye; however, her eyes immediately reddened when she realized that he was enduring those attacks.

He grinned, “Let’s get through this for now and deal with them later.”

She nodded in response, a ruthless expression flitting across her face.

The endless sword rain lasted for a long time before it gradually subsided.

“What!?” The Great Elder’s voice rang out. He was astonished beyond words, having never imagined that Yang Kai could survive the Sword Formation’s assault. Not only was that a Yin Yang Five Elements Everchanging Profound Sword Formation formed by hundreds of people, but he, a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master, was also acting as the Formation Core! In addition, he had the support of six other First-Order Emperor Realm Masters, while the rest were Third-Order Dao Source Realm Masters! Even if a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master was subjected to that attack, they would die without a corpse!

[How did he survive?! Furthermore, his appearance has changed too greatly! There are two bulging protrusions on his head; his hands have turned into sharp claws, and his exposed skin is covered in scales. What kind of monster is he?!] He was so shocked that he couldn’t speak, his thoughts turning rapidly as he activated the power of Sword Formation again.

After that previous rain of swords, not many longswords were left inside the Sword Formation; however, swords of different shapes and auras were slowly condensing again at this moment as though the supply of swords was infinite. Although it wasn’t certain whether those sharp swords were real or not, every one of them was emitting powerful Sword Qi regardless of how real they were.

In response, Yang Kai’s expression turned grim. He anxiously swept his Divine Sense out in all directions.

[Trapped inside this Sword Formation, Yun’er and I will eventually tire ourselves out if we can’t find a way to destroy it or escape.] It was only to be expected; they were fighting against so many enemies after all. Moreover, their enemies were relying on the power of the Formation to maximize their strength. In contrast, the two of them were greatly outnumbered. Even if they could hold out for a while, they could not keep it up forever.

It was a pity that his Divine Sense could not find any loopholes in this place. Besides, he did not have much knowledge in Spirit Arrays. [If only Nanmen Da Jun was here, he might be able to give me some advice.]

While he was frowning deeply, Lin Yun’er angrily said, “Uncle Yang, please buy me some time.”

Although she had killed a lot before, she had always remained perfectly calm. Rather, it felt as though she was simply kicking aside a small stone by the side of the road. She didn’t even get mad when she was constantly being attacked or ambushed previously, but this time, she was angry for real. It couldn’t be helped though as her Uncle Yang had suffered a serious injury in order to protect her.

He was stunned when he heard those words, “Can you destroy this Formation?”

She replied, “I have a trump card. It should be able to destroy it!”

“Good.” Yang Kai was elated, “Go ahead and cast your Secret Technique. I will not let them interfere with you.”

“En!” She sat down cross-legged as soon as he finished speaking. Closing her beautiful eyes, she placed one hand flat against her lower abdomen and made a weird seal with the other hand. The aura around her floated about erratically.

Yang Kai did not know what she was going to do; however, she had already said so much, so he could only give her his greatest trust in return. Besides, he currently did not have any means to destroy this Formation. Thus, it was only natural to let her try if she had a way. If it failed, he would think about it then.

“You brats think you can destroy our Formation?! Such shameless boasting!” The Great Elder’s voice rang out again. He had heard the conversation between the two, and his voice practically dripped with scorn. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

[If the Yin Yang Five Elements Everchanging Profound Sword Formation was that easy to break, it could not have rescued Wind and Cloud Pavilion from danger on so many occasions. Even if these two have some knowledge in Spirit Arrays, it won’t be enough for them to discover the weak points of this Formation.] While thinking so, he shouted again, “Slash!”

Without warning, a huge sword wave sliced down with Lin Yun’er as its target. The sword wave was several tens of metres long and looked like one of the towering pillars supporting the Heavens. Even cracks appeared in space as it slashed down from the sky. This attack was comparable to the full strength of a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master.

Yang Kai roared in defiance as he used his large body to stand between Lin Yun’er and the sword wave. His window-sized fists simultaneously lashed out, striking the approaching attack.

The sword wave dissipated with a loud bang. Meanwhile, Yang Kai staggered backwards slightly, a bloody wound appearing on his clenched fist.

“What amazing might!” The Great Elder was astonished. He did not know what kind of Secret Technique Yang Kai had used to make his body become so large, but even so, it was impressive of Yang Kai to take on the Everchanging Profound Sword Formation with his body alone. Still, he coldly snorted, “Let’s see how long you can last!”

“Slash!”

“Slash!”

“Slash!”

One after another, huge sword waves attacked again and again. The aura behind those attacks threatened to kill Yang Kai and Lin Yun’er ruthlessly. It was completely different from the endless sword rain just now. Each sword wave was infinitely more powerful. Hence the power was increased by a thousand times even though the number was much smaller.

Yang Kai strode forward to meet these attacks. His huge body was indescribably flexible and nimble, swinging out with his fists as he took on one sword after another. Every time he dealt with one sword, he staggered backwards slightly and an extra gash appeared on his fist. Meanwhile, fresh blood dripped on the ground with soft pattering sounds.

By the time the last sword wave came towards him, Yang Kai’s fists were a bloody mess and the Dragon Scales covering them were completely cracked. Gritting his teeth in determination, he used his head to block the attack.

An explosive sound rang out as that sword wave slashed down and embedded itself more than a hand length into his head. His entire body seemed to become shorter after taking that attack, and fresh blood slid down his cheeks.

“Ah…” The Great Elder gasped, feeling shocked. [How is he still alive?! What is with this boy?! How can his body’s defence be this strong?! How is he still standing even after taking on so many of our attacks?! Even a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master wouldn’t be able to remain standing after that, right?! This is impossible!]

A sharp look flashed through his eyes as he sent a giant sword wave at Yang Kai while simultaneously sending a much stealthier sword wave towards Lin Yun’er. Even if he couldn’t kill this boy, he could at least kill that girl, right?

As soon as the sword waves were released, the Great Elder suddenly felt a chill running down his back. The feeling that he was being targeted by a mighty presence blossomed in him for some reason. This terrifying sensation gave him the feeling that he could die at any moment if the other party so wished.

“Who’s there?!” He exclaimed in shock, but received no reply, and strangely enough, the feeling he got just now also vanished without any explanation, as if it had been nothing more than an illusion.

The Great Elder frowned in response, not knowing what was going on and secretly wondering if he had sensed wrongly.

He was currently acting as the Formation Core of the Yin Yang Five Elements Everchanging Profound Sword Formation; moreover, he had combined with hundreds of disciples to assemble the Sword Formation. If anybody wanted to harm him, they had to destroy the Sword Formation before they could locate his true body. [That inexplicable murderous intent that targeted me directly just now must have been nothing more than a figment of my imagination.]

In the meantime, while the sword wave rushed toward Lin Yun’er, she remained motionless, as if she could not sense the imminent danger approaching. She simply continued to cast her Secret Technique quietly and prepared to unleash her trump card.

[I wonder what trump card she has that requires such a long preparation time.] It made Yang Kai secretly judge her Master for being rather unreliable. [Who cares how powerful the trump card is if it takes so long to prepare?! In a real life-or-death situation, who is going to give you the time to make such preparations?!]

Although he was dealing with the Great Elder, he remained vigilant and paid close attention to Lin Yun’er’s situation; therefore, he immediately noticed the sword wave as soon as it appeared. With no other choice, he summoned the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

The tiny Mountains and Rivers Bell looked like a child’s toy in his large hands, but as it spun about in the air for a moment, it rapidly enlarged before covering Lin Yun’er. For that reason, the sword wave that arrived as expected struck the bell instead.

“That is…” The Great Elder was shocked again, his gaze locking onto the Mountains and Rivers Bell like a leech, a strange light shining in his eyes. How could he fail to detect the profoundness of this artifact? The aura that seeped out of this bell was ancient and desolate, as well as incredibly powerful.

“An Ancient Exotic Artifact!” He exclaimed, his gaze immediately filling with greed. He could barely hold in his urge to laugh as he couldn’t believe that this boy had such a precious treasure in his possession!

Even though he was a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master with his own Emperor Rank Artifact, an Emperor Rank Artifact and an Ancient Exotic Artifact were two completely different things. The latter was extremely rare but unbelievably powerful and would be incredibly beneficial in improving his strength if he could obtain one.

Looking at the bell again, he realized how extraordinary it was. Even among all the Ancient Exotic Artifacts, it was certainly a superior existence.

A greedy notion immediately budded in his heart as he secretly vowed to himself that he would seize that Ancient Exotic Artifact! How could a mere First-Order Emperor deserve such a treasure? Leaving that in his possession would be such a waste!

If he could get hold of that Ancient Exotic Artifact, he was confident that he could even fight against a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master. The appeal was too great.

While the Great Elder was being distracted by his greedy thoughts, Yang Kai reached out a hand to wipe at the blood on his face. He breathed in gently, a harsh and cold light flashing in his eyes.

He would not have used the Mountains and Rivers Bell if it had not been necessary. That was because the suppression effect of the Ancient Exotic Artifact was too strong. Even though it could provide Lin Yun’er with great protection, the suppression effect it exuded would surely interfere with her somewhat, especially since she was currently casting her Secret Technique.

Unfortunately, there was nothing much he could do about it at this point. He could only hope that it did not affect her too much. For that reason, he had also weakened the power of the Mountains and Rivers Bell as much as possible.

“Now I can finally go all out now! Old dog, you had better hide as best as you can. Don’t let me catch you, otherwise, I’m going to skin you alive!” Yang Kai looked around with cold eyes, sneering icily.

“How dare you be so cocky, you brat!” The Great Elder yelled in great frustration. His pride was hanging on the line. He was leading a Sword Formation composed of hundreds of people, so logically speaking, he should have been able to eliminate Yang Kai with ease, but contrary to his expectations, Yang Kai wasn’t just alive and kicking, he even dared to throw out threats too!

It was simply intolerable!
