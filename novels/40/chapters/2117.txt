Chapter 2117, Jade Beauty Beggar Token

Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain & Dhael Ligerkeys

Generally speaking, some designs or words would be carved on tokens to show their origin and usage, and the token handed over to Yang Kai by Qin Zhao Yang was no exception.

There weren’t any words carved on the token’s face and there was only a design, a lifelike design of a beauty rising from water.

The patterns and lines of the token looked rigid and rough, yet the beauty depicted on it looked realistic. It was the design of a beauty with beautiful curves and refined facial features. This beauty was just about to leave a pond and her upper body was faintly visible among water droplets...

Moreover, her lower body was also naked, but her pretty legs and nether regions were hidden below the water surface. Anyone who saw this pic would get a strong urge to pull the beauty out of the token and peer into what was hidden from view, which would be shortly followed by frustration born out of failure to satisfy those said urges.

“Damn!” After Yang Kai observed it for a while, and couldn’t help but break into curses. His mood had been dampened!

The person who drew this picture was quite treacherous. He was a person who understood the heart of men well and had deliberately done this. It was so hateful!

Yang Kai flipped over the token and found another design on its backside. It was a painting of a man with dishevelled hair curling up on the ground with a broken and empty bowl placed in front of him.

This was a painting of a beggar, a completely different painting from the beauty on the front side.

Upon observing this painting, Yang Kai felt like he could see the beggar shivering in the cold as wind swept him.

“This beggar...” Yang Kai furrowed his brow and mumbled, “He looks like a certain person...”

As he spoke, the image of a wretched person ran across this mind.

“It’s that Master who has passed it to me,” Qin Zhao Yang provided a weak explanation.

“Brother Qin... are you sure that Master isn’t just a... Swindler?” Yang Kai looked in surprise at him and said, “It looks like this token is made out of ordinary wood, even though the designs should have been painted by a competent Master... But, what kind of Master is so childish?”

“This isn’t ordinary wood,” Qin Zhao Yang said solemnly, “I have observed it carefully, it’s a hundred-year-old elmwood.”

“Does this make any difference?” Yang Kai asked.

The corners of Qin Zhao Yang’s mouth twitched and he could only say, “Nope.”

Every token was a symbol of authority and represented some sort of status or power. This was why tokens wouldn’t be crafted with cheap material such as a hundred-year-old elmwood, and Yang Kai’s Dragon Island Token was even made from materials beyond his knowledge.

As for the Jade Beauty Beggar Token, its materials were very ordinary.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but get sceptical and felt like Qin Zhao Yang had been deceived.

“Little Brother Yang, I know what is in your mind,” Qin Zhao Yang said in a deep voice. “But, why don’t you try crushing this token.”

Yang Kai squinted his eyes and said, “Old Man Qin, are you sure about this? What if I destroy...”

“Then it’ll prove that I have been deceived and it won’t be a loss then.”

Yang Kai nodded and said, “Fine, I’ll give it a try.”

As his voice fell, he held the token in his hand tightly and exerted his power.

A snapping noise echoed out!

Yang Kai’s expression changed, while Qin Zhao Yang revealed a smile, as if this outcome was within his expectations.

The snapping noise wasn’t a result of crushing the token, but rather just the sound of the joints of Yang Kai’s fingers. As for the token held by him, it was still intact.

“How is this possible?” Yang Kai’s eyes widened up in disbelief.

The material of the token was just common wood and it wasn’t a special treasure, yet he couldn’t damage it despite his great power.

Yang Kai couldn’t believe this and he exerted more power, yet he still couldn’t damage it nor twist it.

“Little Brother Yang, did you confirm it by yourself? He’s a real Master,” Qin Zhao Yang looked at Yang Kai’s embarrassing actions and chuckled. “I have suspected this a lot of times in the past years and I have tried a lot of methods to destroy the token, yet to no avail. If I wasn’t sure it’s genuine, I wouldn’t have taken it out.”

“He really is a great Master!” A terrified look was apparent on Yang Kai’s face.

The mysterious Master had used some sort of power on this token, and it had turned the ordinary wood so hard that it was almost indestructible. Ordinary Emperor Realm Masters couldn’t achieve this feat!

At this moment, Yang Kai didn’t have any more doubts and he returned the token to Qin Zhao Yang solemnly then said, “How can I use this token to enter the Four Seasons Realm?”

Qin Zhao Yang said, “The Master has asked me to make a trip to the Azure Sun Temple and ask for a quota from them.”

“So that’s how it is...” An enlightened look appeared on Yang Kai’s face.

The Azure Sun Temple was also one of the Southern Territory’s top sects and its fame and power were second only to the Star Soul Palace. This great sect surely had a lot of entry quotas and it wouldn’t be strange for Qin Zhao Yang to get one with the token.

He couldn’t help but wonder what was the relationship of the token’s Master with the Azure Sun Temple. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Will the Four Seasons Realm open up soon?” Yang Kai asked.

“Likely!” Qin Zhao Yang nodded then mulled it over for a moment and said, “I’m suspecting that everything is within that Master’s expectations. When Yu’er was five years old, he passed the token to me and asked me to make a trip to the Azure Sun Temple in twelve years. I don’t know if the Four Seasons Realm will open up soon or not. After all, our little Maplewood City has no access to this information, but from what happened up to this day, it’ll most likely open up.”

“Brother Qin, you want me to visit the Four Seasons Realm in your stead and seek the Tribulation Fruit?”

Qin Zhao Yang revealed a bitter smile and said, “If I had half of your power, I wouldn’t trouble you with it. But, you also know my situation. I’m also a Dao Source Realm Cultivator, but I’m not on par with the sect elites, and if I go into it, then I won’t leave it alive. I’m not afraid of death, but Yu’er is... I can only trust you with this.”

“When are we leaving?” Yang Kai went right to the point and raised a question.

Qin Zhao Yang said in surprise, “Did you just accept my request?”

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Why would I refuse? You have provided me with a rare opportunity, and I’ll obviously seize it. I also want to visit the Sealed World of the Southern Territory.”

As Yang Kai said this, he revealed a longing look.

Qin Zhao Yang had asked him to enter the Four Seasons Realm to look for the Tribulation Fruit, but if he looked at it from another perspective, then this was a golden opportunity.

The elite disciples of great sects would all compete against each other to get a chance to enter that Sealed World and it obviously had a lot of precious treasures.

Even if it didn’t have innumerable precious treasures in it, just the talented youths were enough of a reason for Yang Kai. This was a good chance to test his power against them.

“Alright!” Qin Zhao Yang didn’t expect Yang Kai to agree so readily and he had even been worried about his refusal, yet he didn’t even need to try to convince him in the end. He was so overjoyed and he said excitedly, “I don’t know when the Four Seasons Realm will open up, but we mustn’t delay this matter further. Little Brother Yang, if you’re free, then why don’t we set off tomorrow? We’ll have to spend a dozen days on the road to reach the Azure Sun Temple.”

“Fine!” Yang Kai nodded and stood up then said, “I’ll go back to get ready for it. I’ll seek you again tomorrow.”

“Then it’s settled!”

After a short moment, Yang Kai left the Qin family’s residence and went toward the residence of the Zhang family.

...

Shortly after Yang Kai left, Qin Yu suddenly returned to the chamber. She cast a glance at Qin Zhao Yang’s face, then asked in a low voice, as if she had realized the outcome, “Old Ancestor, did Senior Yang... agree?”

“He has agreed readily,” Qin Zhao Yang said out of delight. “I didn’t have to waste time convincing him. Little Brother Yang is a straightforward man.”

“Old Ancestor, did you tell him the danger lurking in it? Killing people and stealing their treasures isn’t any different than drinking water there. The competition between various sects’ disciples is very intense and none will be there to oversee and restrict them. Senior Yang’s power is pretty great, but he’s only a First-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivator, what if...”

Upon hearing this, Qin Zhao Yang quieted and he only spoke again after a long while, “Little Brother Yang doesn’t look like a person doomed to die young...”

“Old Ancestor, since when can you read others’ futures?” Qin Yu said through gnashed teeth.

An embarrassed look surfaced on Qin Zhao Yang’s face and he could only say weakly, “I don’t have a choice. There is no one else our Qin family can trust in Maplewood City other than Little Brother Yang, and I couldn’t find any other candidate. Why don’t I just go by myself?”

Qin Yu’s expression turned sad and she said, “Old Ancestor, if you go by yourself, then you won’t make it back alive. Our Qin family has just taken over the Jiang family’s industry. So, who will oversee the place if you leave?”

She stopped for a moment then said, “Fine, Old Ancestor, give him our Qin family’s Myriads Sword and its usage method.”

“Myriads Sword?”

Upon hearing this, Qin Zhao Yang’s expression changed and he said, “Yu’er, that’s our Qin family’s ancestral heirloom...”

“I know how important it’s, but none in our family can wield this Emperor Artifact now, and even though Senior Yang’s cultivation isn’t high enough yet, he’ll still be able to release some of its might with his power and it may even help him in the Four Seasons Realm and save his life. Senior Yang has put his life in the line for our Qin family, so we must show him our concern. If you don’t do so, I’ll have to live the rest of my days in guilt and unease..”

“Since you have already said so much... Fine, when he drops by tomorrow, I’ll hand over the Myriads Sword to him. I hope he can appreciate your regard for him,” Qin Zhao Yang sighed and gave in.

...

Yang Kai went back to the Zhang family and handed over some instructions to Zhang Ruo Xi. He told her that he would shortly take a trip and asked her to focus on her cultivation at home.

Zhang Ruo Xi had revealed a reluctant look, yet she still agreed in the end and didn’t comment on this. Yang Kai had noticed that the young girl was fired up and she wanted to quickly go into seclusion and raise her cultivation base.

As he mulled this over a lot more, he changed his mind and said, “Why don’t you accompany me?”

“Sir, you don’t mind taking me with you?” Zhang Ruo Xi’s eyes lit up and she spoke in delight.

“I don’t mind bringing you with me, but you won’t always be next to me,” Yang Kai said.

“Sir, I can’t understand what you mean.” Zhang Ruo Xi revealed a confused look.

Yang Kai smiled and waved his hand. As the Source Qi enveloped Zhang Ruo Xi, she let out a soft cry and was sent into the Small Sealed World.
