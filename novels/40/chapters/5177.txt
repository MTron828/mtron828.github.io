Both Squad Leaders got knocked out together, but the members of both Squads had yet to enjoy themselves to their heart’s content. A few female members of the Old Turtles Squad even took out some cooking utensils and started preparing some snacks to go with the drinking. Seeing this, Feng Ying and Bai Yi also stepped forward to help.

The courtyard was bustling with noise and excitement.

Both Special Operations Squads were rivals on the battlefield, but they were also inseparable comrades-in-arms. It was the same during the drinking competition.

Everyone was drinking in either groups of three or five. At some point, everyone was drunk, their eyes were droopy and red. Even Feng Ying and the other women had a slight blush on their faces.

Even though they were all Open Heaven Realm Masters, because no one used their World Force to detoxify themselves, their alcohol tolerance was still limited. Of course, they could still hold their liquor because of their powerful physiques.

The empty wine jugs piled higher and higher as more and more fell to the ground, dead drunk.

After an unknown period of time, the entire courtyard had people lying here and there, knocked out; not a single person was left standing. As for Feng Ying and Bai Yi, they were unable to continue drinking long ago and had returned to their rooms to rest.

The bustling courtyard had become completely silent and peaceful.

Under the table, Yang Kai, who was knocked out, secretly opened his eyes. After confirming that the drinking competition was over, only then did he pop his head up, taking the support of the chair. But the next moment, he saw a pair of eyes staring at him from across the table.

When their eyes met, both Yang Kai and Chai Fang were awkward and embarrassed!

Yang Kai had secretly used his strength to detoxify himself, but he didn’t expect Chai Fang to do the same.

[Shameless bastard!] Both of them cursed in their hearts.

After calming himself down, Yang Kai sat back down with no change in his expression. He then took out a tea set and started carefully brewing.

Chai Fang remained silent and waited for the tea.

A moment later, the fragrance of tea filled the air as Yang Kai poured two cups and pushed one to Chai Fang.

Chai Fang picked up the cup and took a sip.

For a moment, alternate sounds of sipping filled the silent courtyard.

After finishing a pot of tea, Chai Fang suddenly opened his mouth and stated, “I’m afraid that something big is about to happen.”

Yang Kai slightly furrowed his brow, “Senior Brother noticed?”

Chai Fang nodded his affirmation, “It seems you did too.”

Yang Kai continued, “Generally, 80% of the Pass’ forces are concentrated at the forward base, and this status quo has been maintained for over 200 years. Although there hasn’t been any fighting for a long time, we still need to be on guard against the Black Ink Clan’s counterattack. In light of this, it’s a little unusual to suddenly recall two Special Operations Squads.”

Chai Fang added with a nod, “It would have been nothing if it was just our Squads; but recently, many Squads had been returning one after another. All of them must have received recall orders. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but all these Squads belonged to the different Divisions and Battalions. In other words, none of the returning Squads belonged to the same Battalion.”

“Do you have some hypothesis?” Yang Kai asked.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Chai Fang shook his head, denying, “I have no idea. I was hoping you had heard something.”

This was the main reason why he had come to Yang Kai. The drinking competition was just an added bonus.

Yang Kai frowned, voicing his thoughts, “If the Pass is planning an attack, they should have gathered their forces at the forward base; but for some reason, they have been recalling us.”

“It seems little brother doesn’t know anything.”

Although Yang Kai suspected that whatever the Pass’ upper echelons were planning had something to do with the newly developed Evil Purging Divine Spear, he believed that doing so would be a reckless thing.

He might have infused Purifying Light into quite a lot of Evil Purging Divine Spears, but each Pass still had only 200 to 300 in total. These Evil Purging Divine Spears could be given to the elite soldiers, but it would not change the course of the war that much; after all, the Evil Purging Divine Spears were one time use consumables.

In his opinion, the Evil Purging Divine Spears would be best used only after amassing a considerable amount of them. They should either not use them, or use them only to force the Black Ink Clan into a corner.

Since this matter concerned the Evil Purging Divine Spear, Yang Kai couldn’t reveal too much to Chai Fang.

“The higher-ups have always been very secretive, so I’m afraid no one will know what they’re planning until the last moment,” Chai Fang couldn’t help but grumble.

It was the same when they had used Xiang Shan’s breakthrough to lure the Black Ink Clan Territory Lords out last time. The Special Operations Squads had no idea and tried to protect Xiang Shan at the cost of their lives, but in the end, the upper echelons of the Pass had been well prepared.

But it was only reasonable to not inform them, because only when they put their lives on the line would the Territory Lords believe that the Human Race had not planned some kind of trap. Had they known the plan beforehand, they might have revealed some clues.

“Senior Brother, don’t worry about it. If they’re really planning to do something, we will know soon enough,” Yang Kai comforted.

Chai Fang nodded slightly, “Junior Brother, if you receive any news, please inform me as soon as possible so that I can make preparations.”

“Good!”

“Then, this Chai will take his leave first.” Chai Fang stood up and shouted, “All of you, get up! Don’t keep lying like corpses! 50 of you lot were beaten by just 30 people, stop making fools of yourselves!”

As soon as his voice fell, the members of both Squads lying in the courtyard got up one by one. Everyone circulated their strength to dispel the effects of the alcohol. The members of the Old Turtle Squad looked very ashamed while Dawn Squad, on the other hand, was beaming with smiles.

Under Chai Fang’s lead, the Old Turtles quickly left, Dawn’s members also left after them, leaving the courtyard in a mess with Yang Kai alone, who silently tidied up everything.

A few days later, Yang Kai, who was cultivating, was once again summoned to the Army Headquarters.

But the moment he stepped into the Army Headquarters, he heard a familiar angry shout coming from the main office, “Why can’t I go? Old Zhong Liang promised me!”

[Grandmaster Ma Fan?]

Yang Kai was slightly taken aback. He had no idea that Grandmaster Ma Fan had returned to Blue Sky Pass. Grandmaster Ma Fan had been staying in the forward base since he had arrived at the Black Ink Battlefield. Since he was here, Yang Kai felt that the situation inside Blue Sky Pass was even more complicated than he expected.

Moreover, Zhong Liang’s promise Grandmaster Ma Fan had just spoken about was quite concerning.

When the Evil Purging Divine Spear experiment was over, Grandmaster Ma Fan had reminded Zhong Liang to not forget his promise, and Zhong Liang had assured that he had not.

Yang Kai didn’t know what Zhong Liang had promised to Grandmaster Ma Fan, but by the looks of it, things had gone wrong. Ding Yao seemed to disagree, which had caused Ma Fan to burn with fury.

While these thoughts were running in his mind, he walked into the office. As he had guessed, he saw Grandmaster Ma Fan inside, but the old man was like an angry rooster, glaring at Ding Yao. Meanwhile, Shen Tu Mo tried to persuade him, “Grandmaster, please calm down. Brother Zhong had indeed promised you, so logically speaking, Brother Ding and I should accept Brother Zhong’s decision, but times have changed. The Evil Purging Divine Spear was invented by you, so you need to oversee the project if further modifications are required. The Evil Purging Divine Spear will determine the future of the Human Race and change the course of its future. Ergo, Grandmaster should remain at Blue Sky Pass for the big picture.”

“Bullshit!” Grandmaster Ma Fan spat in anger. Yang Kai could not help but shrink his neck at the sight of this.

Even an ordinary Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master wouldn’t act so presumptuously before these two Army Commanders; however, not only was Ma Fan an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, but he was also an Artifact Refining Great Grandmaster.

“This old man already has one foot in the grave, so why would I care about the big picture? That’s something you Army Commanders need to worry about, what does it have to do with me? The reason this old man has been holding on even after so many years is because I am unable to face my ancestors. Now that I’ve a chance to fulfill my lifelong wish, you guys are not letting this old man go? What kind of bullshit logic is that? Besides, although this old man was in charge of developing the Evil Purging Divine Spear, the refining process has already been spread to the other Passes. If any improvements are needed in the future, those old farts can figure it out, so why should I worry about it?”

Shen Tu Mo earnestly advised, “Grandmaster, the battlefield is dangerous, and this operation will be different from the past. No one can guarantee anything.”

Grandmaster Ma Fan shot him a side-long look, “What? Are you afraid this old man will be a burden? This old man doesn’t just know how to refine artifacts, I also know how to kill enemies. If it weren’t for your lack of Artifact Refiners, this old man wouldn’t have been sitting in the rear and would have charged into the Black Ink Clan’s base many times already. Furthermore, if this old man really did die on the battlefield, it would be a worthy death! When I meet my ancestors in the next life, this old man can proudly tell them that I died on the Black Ink Battlefield. My ancestors will definitely praise me!”

Shen Tu Mo was rendered speechless. Even he could not use force against someone like Grandmaster Ma Fan, and judging by the old man’s attitude, it was pointless to persuade him.

Grandmaster Ma Fan suddenly turned to Yang Kai, “You said that the Evil Purging Divine Spear is connected to the future of the entire Human Race, so you are afraid that something will happen to me and asked this old man not to go, but the true key to the Evil Purging Divine Spears is that brat! The Evil Purging Divine Spear would be nothing more than a piece of trash without his Purifying Light. You recalled him, so that means you planned to deploy him with the Army? What the Hell!? A Seventh-Order boy can go, but this old man can’t? I don’t give a damn! I’m going whether you like it or not, whether you allow me or not. Hell, this old man will go alone if I have to!”

Saying so, he turned around and left, not even giving Yang Kai so much as a glance.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but pucker his lips. He suddenly felt like he had run into an unexpected disaster. He couldn’t understand why these big shots had to drag him into their quarrel.

[I was right, the Pass is indeed planning something, and judging by Grandmaster Ma Fan’s words, it seemed like we are going somewhere. This explains why all those Squads have been recalled.]

That was alright too. Everything was peaceful at Blue Sky Pass, and the Black Ink Clan had been holed up in their nests for the last two centuries. Since Blue Sky Pass won’t be facing any battle any time soon, deploying forces elsewhere where they might be needed was a good idea.

The Great Passes had never been able to provide any real assistance to one another since ancient times, because they were too far apart and the amount of resources needed to transport so many people was too great. But since Blue Sky Pass had enough resources and leeway, they could ignore such a cost.

While these thoughts were running through his mind, there was no change in Yang Kai’s expression as he cupped his fist, “Sirs.”

Ding Yao and Shen Tu Mo both nodded slightly.

Shen Tu Mo looked at him and asked, “You heard everything, right?”

Yang Kai nodded in response.

“What do you think?”

Yang Kai didn’t hesitate to voice his guess, “Is the Pass planning to send reinforcements to another Pass to defend against the Black Ink Clan?”
