In front of Yang Kai’s mansion, Huo Xing Chen had taken the lead and made several rude comments. Not only did Yang Kai’s brow wrinkle, but the young man opposite was also unhappy, coldly snorting at this so called advice.

Huo Xing Chen was unaffected by the atmosphere though, grinning as he started to say something again, but before he could speak Yang Kai had already grabbed his clothes and tossed him aside.

Tumbling through the air a few times, Huo Xing Chen face planted on the floor. After standing up, he rubbed his nose awkwardly but not daring to have any complaints, simply glaring back at his attacker bitterly.

Seeing this scene, the young man couldn’t help turning his attention to Yang Kai, the cultivators who stood behind him also whispering amongst themselves. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“I’m the one you are looking for,” Yang Kai said indifferently as he swept his gaze over the crowd.

The lead youth looked a little stunned, his eyes quickly flashing a trace of disdain and insolence, staring towards Yang Kai in a provocative manner. Without bowing or cupping his fists, he flatly spoke, “Greetings Young Lord Kai!”

“Who are you?” Yang Kai also found this situation interesting. No wonder Qiu Yi Meng said that this person’s attitude was strange, there was indeed a problem with how he acted.

By all accounts, it looked like he had come here to form an alliance with him; he had brought a lot of cultivators and four large crates of materials, but his expression was clearly filled with unwillingness, almost like being here was some kind of punishment for him.

On top of all that, Yang Kai simply couldn’t remember where he had met this person.

“Xiang Tian Xiao!” The young man replied curtly.

“Xiang Tian Xiao?” Yang Kai’s brow furrowed, suddenly hearing his surname and thinking of something. A grin appearing on his face, he spoke in a dismissive tone, “Who is Xiang Chu to you?”

Xiang Chu, a Young Lord of the first-class Xiang Family, was someone Yang Kai had met at Tai Fang Mountain a few months ago; he was the next in line to inherit the Xiang Family.

At that time, Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng had joined forces to oppress Yang Kai, but at the last moment two Yang Family Blood Warriors had appeared. Yang Kai had secretly plucked two feathers from the Golden Feather Eagle and then pushed responsibility onto Nan Sheng, resulting in two of the Nan Family’s Ascension masters losing an arm as well as Nan Sheng losing two fingers.

The identities of the Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng weren’t low, so Yang Kai couldn’t kill them outright and was forced to let them go; however, he had told them before they left that within three months he expected to see their sincerity in the Central Capital.

Given this series of events, it was obvious that this Xiang Tian Xiao and Xiang Chu were related; as such, then the origins of these cultivators and materials could also be explained.

“He is my elder brother!” Xiang Tian Xiao responded faintly.

Sure enough, Yang Kai nodded slightly and grinned at the cultivators behind Xiang Tian Xiao, “This is the sincerity of your Xiang Family? Good, I’m very satisfied!”

However, Xiang Tian Xiao slowly shook his head and said, “You don’t have such big face yet. The cultivators here are the sincerity of my Xiang Family, and these four boxes of material are the sincerity of the Nan Family!”

“Very well! I don’t mind. Although these people’s strength is a little weak, together with this material they’ll be a little useful.” Yang Kai smiled care freely.

Between these two first-class families, one had sent manpower while the other had sent resources, such an arrangement was still acceptable. Yang Kai estimated that these two families greatly feared that their descendant’s attempt to kill a Yang Family Young Lord would cause the Yang Family to seek trouble with them, so they had choked back their tears and paid a hefty sum to resolve the issue peacefully.

Xiang Tian Xiao’s eyes overflowed with an angry light, his mouth forming into a disdainful sneer as he shot back, “Young Lord Kai’s tone is higher than the Heavens! Whatever your grudge with my big brother is, I have no mood to ask, but if you want my Xiang Family’s help in this Inheritance War, you’ll have to prove to me you have the skills first!”

“Hahah! You want to fight him?” Huo Xing Chen suddenly burst into laughter, staring at Xiang Tian Xiao with a look of pity. His eyes flashed a look of interest before slowly shaking his head, “Even if you’re the second Young Lord of the Xiang Family, I can’t say your chances of success are high, it’s really not a wise decision to play with him.”

To the side, Qiu Yi Meng also giggled and looked at Xiang Tian Xiao with a funny smile.

Both of them had exchanged blows with Yang Kai, but when Qiu Yi Meng and Yang Kai had fought, he was still only a True Element Boundary Third Stage cultivator. At that time, he was able to fight evenly against her while still concealing part of his strength. Now that Yang Kai had reached the True Element Eighth Stage, even though Qiu Yi Meng had successfully broken through to the Immortal Ascension Boundary First Stage, she didn’t dare think she could defeat Yang Kai.

As for Huo Xing Chen, the night’s experience still haunted him like a nightmare.

When all was said and done, he was still a direct descendant of one of the Eight Great Families, and the sole heir at that. Although he spent a lot of his time indulging in pleasure seeking, he had still cultivated diligently and taken countless Precious Treasures so his strength was by no means weak, on top of that he carried a number of excellent artifacts on him as well.

But even with this kind of foundation and background, he was still taken hostage by Yang Kai before he even had time to react; this alone was enough to understand Yang Kai’s tyrannical combat strength.

Huo Xing Chen didn’t believe this Second Young Lord had a chance of beating Yang Kai in a fight.

Amongst the younger generation, only the Liu Family’s genius Liu Qing Yao had any hope of fighting evenly with this freak Yang Kai, besides him there was no other who was his match.

Huo Xing Chen and Qiu Yi Meng’s expressions didn’t escape Xiang Tian Xiao observation, causing a faint curiosity in his heart.

With his eyesight, he could naturally see the strength of these two people. Although he didn’t recognize who these two were, but having such cultivation and bearing at such a young age, they were no doubt children of the Eight Great Families, yet these two, even if they didn’t say much, from their attitude and tone had made their opinions clear.

Was this Yang Kai really that powerful?

Staring at Yang Kai carefully, Xiang Tian Xiao secretly shook his head. He couldn’t see Yang Kai’s depths. As this Yang Family Young Lord stood there, he didn’t release the slightest bit of aura, his True Qi as calm as an ancient well, his Spiritual Essence also showed a similar degree of restraint. Such a degree of control either indicated he was extremely powerful, or had used some kind of artifact to conceal his strength.

Xiang Tian Xiao couldn’t tell whether this was his real ability or simply an illusion, if he wanted to understand his true strength, the only way was for him to fight.

But now that things had reached this point, Xiang Tian Xiao had no way to retreat, saying to Yang Kai, “If you really just relied on those two Blood Warriors to make my brother submit, then you’ll never convince me. If you want me to help you sincerely, you’ll have to defeat me yourself.”

Huo Xing Chen couldn’t help but sigh, walking over to Qiu Yi Meng and muttering with a sad face, “This kid can’t be saved!”

Qiu Yi Meng also nodded lightly, expressing her full agreement.

Listening to them, Xiang Tian Xiao suddenly felt irritated, even the four Immortal Ascension Boundary masters behind him looked at Huo Xing Chen with unfriendly eyes, seemingly thinking he should not despise their Second Young Lord.

Yang Kai’s eyes flashed a meaningful light as he frowned slightly, “It seems that your big brother didn’t tell you everything about that incident.”

From Xiang Tian Xiao’s words, Yang Kai quickly realized some issues.

“If your big brother didn’t tell you, then so be it, but didn’t your cousin Nan Sheng at least explain what happened?” Yang Kai grinned treacherously, revealing a lot of hidden meanings.

Qiu Yi Meng’s long eyelashes fluttered, quietly remembering some rumors she had heard before turning her gaze towards Xiang Tian Xiao, slowly revealing a sympathetic look.

Xiang Tian Xiao expression became firm, coldly snorting, “Things heard are unreliable, seeing is believing! If you have the confidence, fight with me, if you refuse, then I’ll leave here immediately, regardless, these people and these materials will remain and the accounts between you and my Xiang Family will be considered settled.”

Yang Kai shook his head slowly, “I don’t need a headless snake, I accept your challenge!”

Without this Xiang Family Second Young Lord to lead them, even if these cultivators remained they wouldn’t bring him benefit to Yang Kai. These people, at first glance, were obviously quite loyal to Xiang Tian Xiao.

Saying so, Yang Kai casually strode a few steps forward before calmly signaling to Xiang Tian Xiao to begin.

Such a contemptuous appearance only further angered Xiang Tian Xiao; however, he swiftly took a deep breath and suppressed his surging emotions, firmly pressing down the resentment in his heart.

In an instant, Xiang Tian Xiao’s breath became calm as he seriously stared at Yang Kai.

This rapid change improved Yang Kai’s impression of Xiang Tian Xiao greatly, the greatest mistake when facing an opponent was to become emotional. Therefore, when the cultivators faced enemies they considered strong, they would usually use words to try to stimulate each other and make their opponent take rash or impatient actions, thus increasing the chance that they would make a mistake that could be exploited.

Only by remaining calm could a cultivator exert their full strength, even possibly allowing them to display combat prowess above their usual limit .

Xiang Tian Xiao being able to instantly restrain his emotions showed that his strength and experience weren’t ordinary.

“Second Young Lord, be careful!” The Xiang Family cultivators hurriedly stepped back, the Immortal Ascension Boundary Fourth Stage master calling out as he retreated.

“I know!” Xiang Tian Xiao calmly shouted.

As he spoke, his hand turned and a long blue saber suddenly appeared in his hand.

Heaven Grade artifact!

When this saber appeared, Xiang Tian Xiao’s aura immediately changed, suddenly becoming wild and unhindered, overflowing with a strong sense of self-confidence, it was as if no matter who or what stood before him, he could slice it apart.

No words were exchanged or signals given, as soon as Xiang Tian Xiao summoned his artifact, he instantly held it up towards the Heavens, a fierce wind pressure swiftly engulfing the blade as he swung it down towards Yang Kai.

“Isn’t this considered a sneak attack?” Huo Xing Chen asked.

Qiu Yi Meng was too lazy to take respond to him. Yang Kai had already agreed to his challenge, what more needed to be said? Xiang Tian Xiao was obviously a straightforward person, so any further conversation was unnecessary.

Moreover, his strength was not low, a True Element Boundary Ninth Stage elite!

Her eyes quickly turning, Qiu Yi Meng wants to see how Yang Kai would resist this strike. Although she knew Yang Kai was very powerful, it had been a long time since she had fought against him, just how much Yang Kai since then was also of great interest to her.

As this storm like sword strike approached, Yang Kai simply stood in place, his expression completely indifferent, seemingly having no intention to dodge or avoid it, gently lifting a single hand and pushing it towards the falling blade.

A fierce True Qi burst forth as a large palm strike visible to the naked eye met the blade head on.

*Hong!*

A loud bang resounded as waves of energy splashed out.

The blade storm and the palm strike collided together and exploded, both perfectly offsetting one another.

Under the cover of the resulting dust cloud, Xiang Tian Xiao had at some point closed the gap between them, a wild True Qi bursting from his body as a blue radiance pulsed from his saber’s tip. This chilling brilliance was enough the make the heart of any who saw it jump.

This blue ball of light was as large as a plate and gave of a fierce, murderous, aura filled with the power of thunder and lightning.

Channeling this elemental lightning force, Xiang Tian Xiao’s speed seemed to be boosted greatly, only leaving behind a blurry afterimage as he stepped in.

Thunder Flash Saber!

This was Xiang Tian Xiao’s absolute killing strike, it had never failed him before, under this single attack he would often be able to rout his opponents.

The Xiang Family cultivators also showed a faint smile on their faces, full of expectations. All of them wanted to see how Yang Kai would suffer under this blow.
