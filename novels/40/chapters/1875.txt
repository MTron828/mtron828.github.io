Chapter 1875, You Dare

In front of an old monster like Kuang Shi Zong, Gong Sun Liang didn’t dare to play any tricks, so his narration of the events of today contained no slander or embellishment.

When Kuang Shi Zong heard that all the ancestral tablets had been broken, he became furious and a terrifying pressure fell upon the audience. This pressure was so heavy it felt as if the sky had collapsed and was now weighing directly on everyone’s heart.

Kuang Shi Zong shot a fierce glare towards Zi Wu Ji at that moment, causing him to immediately cough up a mouthful of blood.

With his shrewdness, how could Kuang Shi Zong not understand that the broken tablets were something Zi Wu Ji had engineered. This was an intolerable disrespect to the ancestors, so he punished him.

Hearing that Yang Kai had fought two opponents at once and actually held the advantage, Kuang Shi Zong raised his brows and looked at Yang Kai with interest.

Yang Kai showed no fear though and simply grinned back at him.

After a while, Gong Sun Liang finished speaking and stood quietly in place, waiting nervously.

The atmosphere was solemn, and no one dared to speak. The place where Kuang Shi Zong stood was the focus of everyone present as no one knew what he was thinking at this moment.

Only after a long silence did Kuang Shi Zong suddenly say, “Why has this old master not heard about my Purple Star having a third Venerable? Boy, where did you obtain your Venerable Token?”

Yang Kai smiled lightly and said, “Senior’s question is quite strange, the Venerable Token was naturally given to me by Zi Long.”

“He gave it to you? When, where?” Kuang Shi Zong stared sternly at Yang Kai as he pointedly questioned.

Gong Sun Liang, Li Mao Ming, and all the others all looked suspiciously at Kuang Shi Zong, not knowing why he would ask these seemingly irrelevant questions.

Yang Kai frowned slightly as he suddenly had a bad premonition, but he still calmly said, “What does Senior mean by asking this?”

“What do I mean?” Kuang Shi Zong’s face suddenly became solemn as he took a step towards Yang Kai. It was only a step, but Kuang Shi Zong’s aura seemed to crash towards Yang Kai as a result, forcing him to retreat three steps as his face flushed slightly.

“Zi Long... Where is he? Is he dead or alive?” Kuang Shi Zong asked in a deep voice.

Yang Kai’s face changed slightly and did not make a sound. Kuang Shi Zong asking such a question obviously meant he either already knew the answer or was trying to force a response from Yang Kai in order to make a determination, so the best course of action was to not speak.

“Refusing to speak? Is that a confirmation of your guilty conscience?” Kuang Shi Zong sneered, “Boy, you may not know, but becoming a Venerable of Purple Star is not just about holding a Venerable Token. It is also required for this old master to consent before anything becomes official. Without a nod from this old master, Zi Long would never give out a Venerable Token no matter how much courage he had. You hold a Venerable Token, but this old master knows nothing about your existence, so does Zi Long no longer put this old master in his eyes or is there something else afoot here? Care to explain?”

Hearing what he said, Yang Kai could not help but chuckle and casually said, “Maybe Zi Long was planning to discuss the matter with Senior after thinking about it for a while, and... the Venerable Token has already been returned to Great Elder by me, so why don’t we end things here for today?”

“Hmph!” Kuang Shi Zong coldly snorted, ignoring Yang Kai and instead turning to Zi Wu Ji and coldly asking, “Is your father’s Life Lamp still intact?”

Zi Wu Ji had just suffered a heavy blow, but he was not critically injured and was currently adjusting his breathing. Hearing this question though, he trembled and hesitated, debating whether he should lie or not, but soon he resigned himself and answered honestly, “Reporting to Martial Ancestor, Lord Father’s Life Lamp... has broken!”

“What?” Everyone was shocked, and even Gong Sun Liang showed an expression of disbelief.

They naturally knew what a Life Lamp was and what it meant for it to have broken.

This meant that Zi Long had fallen! Purple Star’s Sect Master had died!

Only Li Mao Ming, who received the news from Zi Wu Ji earlier today, remained relatively calm, though a sad and bitter smile still adorned his face. He and Zi Long were as close as siblings when they were young, and though they had later parted ways because of a woman, they were still brothers, not enemies. When he learned that Zi Long had fallen, Li Mao Ming was not the least bit happy and instead was extremely sad.

“As I thought!” Kuang Shi Zong sighed, his already old face seemingly ageing noticeably.

After remaining silent for a moment, he turned to Yang Kai again, his eyes as sharp as a falcon’s, as if they could penetrate everything in the world, and quickly asked, “Where did Zi Long die?”

“The Severed World!” Yang Kai answered with a frown.

“Who killed him!?”

Yang Kai raised his brow and asked, “Oh? Does Senior feel that the death of Brother Zi Long has nothing to do with me?”

Kuang Shi Zong sneered, “Although you are quite good, you’re not qualified to kill Zi Long. If that weren’t the case, do you think this old master would be bothering to speak with you now? This old master would have already taken your life to avenge Zi Long.”

“Senior’s mind is sharp!” Yang Kai wore a look of admiration before immediately showing a pained look, “Brother Zi Long died under the Seven-Coloured Radiant Light, it was not under anyone’s hand!”

“Seven Coloured Radiant Light!” Kuang Shi Zong’s face changed. Obviously, he knew what the Seven Coloured Radiant Light was, perhaps he had even entered the Severed World before and thus knew of its power. Lightly nodding, he muttered, “If that is the case, then it was his own fault for acting reckless.”

“After Brother Zi Long died, I picked up his Space Ring, and as for the Venerable Token... haha...” Yang Kai smirked.

“What? You mean you never were my Purple Star’s Venerable?” Gong Sun Liang could not help but yell in a cracking voice.

“Great Elder, forgive me, forgive me!” Yang Kai cupped his fists at him with a smile.

“You... you!” Gong Sun Liang’s blood rushed to his head and his heart nearly burst from his chest.

Kuang Shi Zong glanced at him coldly before turning to Yang Kai and saying, “Boy, you are not my Purple Star Venerable, you deceived your way into this place, and damaged my Purple Star City! These sins is unforgivable!”

“It wasn’t just me!” Yang Kai protested.

“If it weren’t for you, how could today’s situation have happened?” Kuang Shi Zong looked at Yang Kai coldly, his murderous intent so strong it was tangible.

Yang Kai secretly became vigilant and condensed his Saint Qi, preparing to defend himself.

But to his surprise, Kuang Shi Zong did not immediately attack but instead said, “Boy, this old master will give you two options. One, this old master kills you here and now to comfort the departed souls of my Purple Star’s ancestors! Two, you join my Purple Star officially and work for my Purple Star! Choose!”

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Why must Senior try to embarrass me? I don’t want to die, and I don’t want to join Purple Star, so what should be done?”

“Boy, do not refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit, this old master appreciates talents and does not want to see someone like you die young, you should consider well before replying.”

“I have considered it thoroughly!” Yang Kai nodded sincerely.

Kuang Shi Zong narrowed his eyes as he stared at Yang Kai and said unhurriedly, “You pretending to be my Purple Star Venerable, even going so far as to infiltrate my Purple Star Palace and involve yourself in this muddy water was for more than just your own entertainment, yes? If this old master isn’t wrong... you came here for these people.”

Saying so, Kuang Shi Zong stretched out his hand and waved and from down below, a slight exclamation rang out, then a loud roar accompanied by violent energy fluctuations burst forth as Kuang Shi Zong’s face went cold and he clenched his fist.

Several figures flew over towards him uncontrollably at that moment and immediately arrived beside him.

Amazingly, it was Shen Tu and his entourage.

Behind Shen Tu and the others, Xiao Xiao held the Heaven Shaking Pillar and was in close pursuit. Xiao Xiao’s body had already swelled up to his Stone Giant form and seemed to be trying to save Shen Tu and the others, but was powerless to do so.

Shen Tu and the others wore panicked expressions at this moment. They had just been rescued by Xiao Xiao and were about to use the chaos to escape from Purple Star City when they were suddenly subdued by Kuang Shi Zong and instantly became the focus of everyone’s attention.

Kuang Shi Zong fixed Shen Tu and the others in place not far away before turning and frowning at the Stone Puppet below, some curiosity apparent in his gaze. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Even with his insight and experience, he could not tell whether the Stone Puppet was a creature or a puppet and could only vaguely feel that this stone-like thing was not simple.

“What is Senior’s meaning here?” Yang Kai squinted at Kuang Shi Zong.

“Nothing,” Kuang Shi Zong saw Yang Kai become somewhat anxious when Shen Tu and the others and couldn’t help but smile, “So you’re from Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce? However, this old master has never heard of anyone like you in Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce. Who are you?”

“Junior is an unknown person, Senior has naturally never heard of him, but I must say, a Senior of your level resorting to such underhanded methods... if word of this were to spread out, wouldn’t it invite ridicule?” Yang Kai’s face was as cold and gloomy as ice.

“Who would dare laugh at me? This old master will kill him and all his family,” Kuang Shi Zong said indifferently. “I will give you one last chance, swear allegiance to my Purple Star and I can release this trash, otherwise, all of you will die here today!”

Shen Tu was suspended in mid-air and his strength was completely imprisoned, so all he could do is look towards Yang Kai with a wry smile and say, “Brother Yang, forget about us, just think of a way to esca...”

Before he finished speaking, he suddenly paled and spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Second Young Master!” The cultivators from Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce were shocked and one of them even turned his head and cursed at Kuang Shi Zong, “Old Bastard, how dare you...”

*Peng...*

Halfway through his sentence though, his head suddenly burst open, spraying a mess of red and white all over before his headless corpse fell to the ground.

Shen Tu and the others turned pale immediately as they expected that a master like Kuang Shi Zong would actually lower himself to killing an Origin Realm cultivator he had already subdued.

At that moment, none of them dared to say anything again, for fear of causing their own death.

“This old master’s patience is limited. Next, it will be him. This boy seems to have some value. If you do not want him to die, you should seriously consider this old master’s offer,” Kuang Shi Zong pointed at Shen Tu, his expression cold and unfeeling.

As soon as this was said, Shen Tu could not help shivering slightly.

“You dare!” Yang Kai shouted angrily, his complexion becoming fierce.

Without even mentioning his personal friendship with Shen Tu, just Xue Yue’s existence was more than enough for Yang Kai to act here. If he really let Shen Tu die at Kuang Shi Zong’s hand, Yang Kai would no longer have any face to see Xue Yue.

After all, Shen Tu was Xue Yue’s Second Brother.

Kuang Shi Zong looked startled for a moment before a strange grin appeared on his face, “No one has dared speak to this old master that way for many years. Interesting, boy, open your eyes and watch whether this old master really dares to kill him!”
