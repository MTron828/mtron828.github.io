Yang Kai smacked his lips with joy as he stated, “Tsk tsk, it’s tempting but this Young Master has a lot of grievances with your Netherworld Sect, especially with your noble Sect Master’s Legacy Disciple, Yin Le Sheng…”

Wu Yuan Zheng guaranteed, “This King said, as long as you are willing to join our Sect, our past grievances will be written off. As for Martial Nephew Yin, this King will persuade him. I believe that he is not someone who will fail to see the bigger picture.”

“Will everything really be written off?” Yang Kai asked, raising his brow.

“How can this King lie to you after giving his word?”

“Even if Yin Le Sheng and Hua Fei Chen have been killed by me?”

Wu Yuan Zheng narrowed his eyes and the smile on his face instantly disappeared as he shouted out loud, “What did you say?”

Yang Kai indifferently reiterated, “Yin Le Sheng and Hua Fei Chen have been killed by me!”

Wu Yuan Zheng shouted again, “That’s impossible!”

The reason why he had come here was because he had heard that Yin Le Sheng and Hua Fei Chen had taken a team of Netherworld Sect disciples to the Ancient Lands to deal with a personal enemy. Yin Le Sheng was the Legacy Disciple of the current Netherworld Sect Sect Master. Also, he had ascended to the Star Boundary from the lower plane, so his aptitude was extremely good and his future was extremely bright. He was of great value to the Netherworld Sect and the Sect Master also valued him greatly.

Whereas Hua Fei Chen was an Elder of the Netherworld Sect, an extremely high position in the Netherworld Sect.

Wu Yuan Zheng and the Netherworld Sect Master were completely oblivious about the two of them taking so many disciples to the Ancient Lands at first as the two had acted very secretly.

Later, when the Netherworld Sect Master accidentally came to hear about it, he became furious and extremely worried as well. After all, the Ancient Lands were extremely dangerous. He was afraid that something would happen to his Legacy Disciple, so he had asked Wu Yuan Zheng to personally go and search for them.

And so, Wu Yuan Zheng, after coming here, went to the Qi Family Fort right away. At Qi Family Fort, he came to hear about Yin Le Sheng’s grudge with Yang Kai, and about Yang Kai being in possession of the Phoenix True Fire from Qi Hai.

Wu Yuan Zheng was immediately overjoyed and realized that this trip might be a good opportunity for him.

If he could obtain the Phoenix True Fire and refine it, he may be able to become the next Martial Flame Great Emperor! At that time, the Netherworld Sect would be at his beck and call.

He secretly made up his mind to search for Yin Le Sheng while also seizing Yang Kai’s Phoenix True Fire. Therefore, he didn’t hesitate to offer Yang Kai an Elder’s position.

How could a trivial First-Order Emperor Realm brat have something as divine as the Phoenix True Fire? Only a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master like him could subdue a Divine Flame for his own use.

How would he have known that Yang Kai would suddenly deliver him such a terrible surprise?

After returning from the Shattered Star Sea, Yin Le Sheng had advanced to the First-Order Emperor Realm whereas Hua Fei Chen was an established Second-Order Emperor. And now, Yang Kai actually claimed that he had killed both of them.

Wu Yuan Zheng immediately rejected the very notion; after all, Yin Le Shen still had an Emperor Authority Bead gifted to him by the Netherworld Sect Master. That Emperor Authority Bead had the full powered attack of a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master sealed inside of it.

“You killed them? You? Boy, aren’t you afraid of being struck by lightning for making such outrageous claims!?” The Netherworld Sect Elder, who had attacked Qi Hai before, sneered. Obviously, he didn’t believe Yang Kai one bit. With Yang Kai’s current strength, how could he kill Hua Fei Chen, a Second-Order Emperor?

However, as he said this, his eyes suddenly widened as he stared ahead in shock.

Suddenly, a pitch-black thing appeared in Yang Kai’s hand. It was surrounded by dense Yin Qi and ghastly cries and wails could be heard when it flapped along with the wind.

“Netherworld Purgatory Banner!” The Elder couldn’t help but blurt out while Wu Yuan Zheng too couldn’t help but have his facial muscles twitch, staring straight at the Netherworld Purgatory Banner.

“It’s indeed a Netherworld Purgatory Banner…”

“And the rich aura is unlike that of a Dao Source Grade banner, it’s more like an Emperor Grade Netherworld Purgatory Banner!”

“In the Sect, only the Elders, Sect Master, and Vice Sect Master can have an Emperor Grade Netherworld Purgatory Banner… Could it be that he really killed Elder Hua?”

Shocked by this revelation, the Netherworld Sect disciples broke into a lively discussion.

The Netherworld Purgatory Banner was an artifact refined by every disciple of Netherworld Sect; however, which grade of banner they received depended on their individual cultivation.

The banner taken out by Yang Kai was an Emperor Artifact left by Hua Fei Chen after his death. Some disciples were unable to distinguish its aura, but Wu Yuan Zheng and the other Elder could tell that it belonged to Hua Fei Chen at a glance.

In a flash, Wu Yuan Zheng’s face turned ashen.

[If Hua Fei Chen is dead, then Yin Le Sheng’s fate cannot be any better. Sect Master regards Yin Le Sheng as Netherworld Sect’ successor and spared no effort nurturing him. If he is dead, who will calm Sect Master’s anger?]

“You actually killed Elder Hua!?” The Netherworld Sect Elder became furious and roared at the top of his lungs, “Boy, I’ll take your life!”

Having lost his mind to anger, he charged ahead without a moment of hesitation. Dense Black Qi surged around him in a gloomy and terrifying manner. It seemed as if he wanted to kill Yang Kai to avenge Hua Fei Chen. Who knows what his relationship with Hua Fei Chen was?

Wu Yuan Zheng was shocked and hurriedly shouted, “Elder Zhong, come back!”

Although Yang Kai was just a First-Order Emperor Realm, since he could kill Hua Fei Chen, Elder Zhong wasn’t his opponent for sure. At this moment, Elder Zhong had been blinded by rage but he could clearly see this.

But his warning came a little too late.

Yang Kai, seeing Elder Zhong charging at him, wasn’t surprised at all and simply chuckled, “Elder Zhong, don’t worry, this Young Master will send you to reunite with Hua Fei Chen!”

He slowly raised his hand, but just as he was about to make a move, a shapely and slender figure suddenly appeared before him.

Ji Yao’s figure was exuding an extremely cold aura, and standing before Yang Kai, her jade-like hand slightly grasped the void as she summoned a long sword into her grip.

Immediately, a fearsome aura erupted from Ji Yao, as if she had transformed into a giant crystal of eternal ice that would never melt and would freeze anyone who dared to approach her.

“Second-Order Emperor Realm!” Elder Zhong’s face turned pale in shock and horror.

Although he had seen Ji Yao before, because Ji Yao had been standing behind Yang Kai, he thought that this woman was Yang Kai’s entourage or maid.

How strong would a maid accompanying Yang Kai, a First-Order Emperor, be?

Not to mention him, even Wu Yuan Zheng had never paid any importance to Ji Yao from the beginning to the end.

They didn’t realize how wrong they were until Ji Yao had made a move.

To their dismay, the woman calmly standing behind Yang Kai was actually a Second-Order Emperor, significantly higher than Yang Kai in cultivation.

Just as Ji Yao drew her sword, a flash of light flickered accompanied by a metallic cry before an icy domain that could freeze space itself rapidly spread into the surroundings, enveloping Elder Zhong.

Mid-air, Elder Zhong felt his entire body turn stiff. Affected by the Ice Principles, he was unable to circulate his Emperor Qi smoothly and his hair and beard froze in an instant.

[I’m not her opponent!] Elder Zhong’s eyes went wide as he loudly shouted, “Vice Sect Master, save me!”

But how could Wu Yuan Zheng save him? Elder Zhong had attacked without any prior signs and his speed was too fast, so at this moment, he wasn’t that far from Yang Kai, meaning Wu Yuan Zheng would be too late to rescue him even if he tried to.

Before everyone’s eyes, the sword in Ji Yao’s hand flashed before it returned to its original position, as if it had never moved.

However, an ice flower had strangely appeared on Elder Zhong’s chest.

The ice flower had six petals and was crystal clear. It was extremely beautiful, but this epitome of beauty was accompanied by a fearsome murderous intent. With a burst of soft cracking sounds, more ice flowers suddenly spread across Elder Zhong’s body, encasing him from top to bottom.

Through the newly formed wall of transparent ice, a hundred pairs of eyes could clearly see the frozen expression of horror on Elder Zhong’s face.

Frozen, Elder Zhong plummeted from the air. And the moment he touched the ground, the block of ice shattered, and so did Elder Zhong, leaving not even a single drop of blood. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Instant kill!

A First-Order Emperor Realm Elder of the Netherworld Sect was instantly killed by this otherworldly woman! The strong visual impact had shaken everyone’s heart and soul, causing them to be unable to regain their senses for a long time.

“How dare you yell before the Honoured Master! You deserve death!” Ji Yao oppressively shouted as her pair of pretty eyes swept over the audience.

Anyone who met her gaze involuntarily shivered.

Only Wu Yuan Zheng, who was burning with fury and on the verge of erupting like a volcano, coldly said with his hair and clothes dancing despite there being no wind today, “Good good good! It seems that the Sect has been silent for too long that any random whore now dares to kill our Elders!” While speaking, he glared at Yang Kai and shouted, “Yang Kai, even if you hand over the Phoenix True Fire today, you will still die!”

An Elder-level Master had died right before his eyes, so if he didn’t kill the culprit, how would he explain it to the Sect?

Yang Kai sneered, “You want to kill this Young Master? Let’s see if you have the ability!”

“This King will broaden your vision today!” Wu Yuan Zheng stated in an ice-cold voice and grimly smiled, “Don’t worry, this King won’t kill you right away. I will drain every drop of blood from your body! As for the two women by your side… they will know what it means to suffer a fate worse than death!”

“Vice Sect Master, kill them to avenge Elder Zhong!”

“Kill them!”

“The two women are great beauties. Vice Sect Master, this is a blessing! You can enjoy them before killing them!”

“Yes, yes! Heh heh, these two women are blind and ignorant, they have no idea who to follow and who to not. They are actually accompanying this brat, how unfortunate for them!”

After recovering from the shock of Elder Zhong being killed, the Netherworld Sect disciples suddenly became more confident as they had Wu Yuan Zheng with them!

He was the Netherworld Sect’s Vice Sect Master, a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master. His strength was second only to the Sect Master in the Netherworld Sect. Once the Vice Sect Master made his move, this man and these two women would surely be doomed.

“Sir Yang, why not leave them to this Mistress?” Luan Feng, hearing the foul and obscene words of the Netherworld Sect disciples, asked in a cold voice as an icy gleam flashed past her eyes.

Yang Kai meaningfully grinned, “I was just about to ask Lady Feng for your help!”

A Third-Order Emperor Realm Master was far stronger than him, and even if he pulled out all his trump cards, he would have to pay a price to kill this opponent. Yang Kai was only acting so confident and carefree in this situation because Luan Feng was by his side.

Otherwise, he would have escaped with Ji Yao at first notice.

But now, Wu Yuan Zheng’s luck had definitely run out! He thought he could turn Luan Feng’s life into a living hell! Even the Heavens themselves would not be able to save him now.
