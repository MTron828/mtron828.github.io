That tall and beefy Ancient Barbarian hid in an inconspicuous spot and took out an animal skin bag from underneath his clothes. Opening the bag and looking inside, he suddenly chuckled. There were thousands of Green Coins inside! Enough for an entire year’s worth of living expenses!

“Not a bad harvest, right?” All of a sudden, a voice sounded from behind and he jumped in fright, hurriedly turning around to stare at the speaker vigilantly. Immediately, he felt a pang of guilt in his heart as he met eyes with this newcomer. This was only natural since he recognized the speaker as the owner of that bag.

An Ancient Barbarian as weak and slender as Yang Kai was very rare in Frost and Snow City, so rare that Yang Kai could even be considered unique in this place.

Despite recognizing Yang Kai, that beefy Ancient Barbarian refused to admit anything, instead putting on a vicious expression as he snapped, “What do you want?”

Yang Kai instantly found this scene amusing as he commented, “You stole from me yet can still pretend to be so nonchalant about it. I have to say, your existence has overturned my perception of the entire Ancient Barbarian Race.”

“What do you mean by stole?!”

“I’m talking about that bag you’re stuffing into your clothes.” Yang Kai watched the other party’s movements coldly.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” The beefy Ancient Barbarian casually put the skin bag away and impatiently said, “If there’s nothing else, I’m leaving. Stop following me.”

Yang Kai was shocked and burst out furiously, “You shameless thief! How dare you act so arrogantly?! Will you believe me if I say I will call the Frost and Snow Clan’s guards to deal with you?!”

That beefy Ancient Barbarian Race looked at Yang Kai disdainfully and sneered, “Go ahead and do it!”

That person’s confidence left Yang Kai dumbfounded, but calling the Frost and Snow Clan’s guards was clearly impossible.

Though Yang Kai had identified the thief in this incident, he had no evidence that this person had stolen his money. Hence, bringing the guards was a waste of time. Besides, Yang Kai didn’t want to drag other people into this either. Clicking his tongue, he said, “You provoked somebody you should never have offended.”

That beefy Ancient Barbarian Race smiled coldly, “Stop talking nonsense. If you keep wasting my time, I’ll beat you up!” While speaking, he raised a large fist at Yang Kai with a threatening look.

As soon as the words left his mouth, his expression changed drastically as he saw Yang Kai rushing towards him. At the same time, a clenched fist appeared in front of his face.

“You court death!” The beefy Ancient Barbarian Race roared as he had not expected such a weak-looking man to attack. Even so, he swiftly threw out a punch of his own, despite his shock and anger.

Yang Kai let out a soft sound of surprise the moment their fists connected as contrary to his expectations, he discovered that no violent force was behind this punch. Rather, the other party’s imposing body and threatening fist seemed to be made of air.

A look of consternation and fear flashed across that beefy Ancient Barbarian Race’s face as his huge body flew backwards. All of a sudden, that large, sturdy body distorted and transformed into a petite and slender figure.

*Pa…*

A small figure crashed into the ground like a dead fish, landing with a loud thud. At the same time, a green leaf fluttered down from the sky.

Yang Kai’s eyes nearly popped out in shock as he stood blankly in place for a long time before finally recovering. This couldn’t be helped though as his punch turned the burly man into a young girl! How was that possible? It definitely wasn’t anything he did!

In the time Yang Kai was staring dumbfounded, the girl that had landed on the ground got up with some difficulty, the expression on her face as she stared at him full of fear.

Looking at the girl again, Yang Kai realized that she was no more than sixteen or seventeen years old. Moreover, she had a Shaman’s aura enveloping her body. As for what realm she was in, Yang Kai couldn’t tell. The time he spent in this world was very short. Furthermore, he had barely met any Shamans and did not have a clear understanding of the distinction between Shaman Strength and their realms.

After the huge change in the girl’s body, her clothes also became looser as a result. Still, that was not enough to conceal her voluptuous curves which went to show just how shapely her body was.

Meanwhile, the girl looked extremely flustered now that her real appearance had been revealed without warning. Glancing about in a panic, she hurriedly rushed forward to pick up the green leaf that had fluttered to the ground previously and pressed it to her head. Subsequently, her petite body distorted and transformed back to the burly appearance from before.

“You’re part of the Nomad Clan!” Yang Kai had a sudden realization and blurted out her origins.

“W-What nonsense are you saying?!” The beefy man, who was the disguise of that girl, retorted stubbornly and looked about shiftily.

“Is that so?” Yang Kai smilingly looked at the other party, as if he had already won, “Am I speaking nonsense?”

“What do you mean by the Nomad Clan?! I’m from the Flowing Clouds Clan.”

“Heh heh…” Yang Kai chuckled softly. All of a sudden, he cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted, “Hey, everyone! There’s a thief from the Nomad Clan here! Hey…” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Shut up!!” The girl’s expression changed drastically as she reached into her clothes, took out the skin bag, and tossed it to him, “I’ll return it to you. So, stop shouting!”

Yang Kai playfully tossed the bag in his hands and glanced at her teasingly, “Why are you so nervous if you’re not part of the Nomad Clan?”

She stubbornly insisted, “I’m not nervous.”

Among the knowledge the Village Chief had taught to Yang Kai was that basically all of the Ancient Barbarian Race clans considered a strong and robust body to be beautiful. However, one clan differed from the rest, the Nomad Clan! People of this clan drifted about with no fixed homes; moreover, there were very few in this clan. As such, it was very rare for ordinary people to meet them. Since the Nomad Clan did not focus on cultivating their bodies, their physiques were drastically different from that of the other clans. If that were all, it would be nothing worth mentioning. The key point was that the clansmen of the Noman Clan were not honest people. Every one of them seemed to be involved in nefarious trades. Hence, their reputation was very bad among the Ancient Barbarian Race.

There were two reasons why Yang Kai constantly received hateful looks wherever he went. The first reason was that his body looked too weak, meaning he wasn’t worthy of respect. The second reason was that some people mistakenly assumed that he was from the Nomad Clan. What Yang Kai experienced was the epitome of what a Nomad Clansman experienced outside their clan.

Yang Kai clicked his tongue and circled the girl several times, commenting with great interest, “I’ve heard of how special the Nomad Clan is, but this is the first time I’m meeting one. How interesting… Hey, let me see your real appearance again.”

This wanton examination of his made the girl’s skin crawl and she asked in a shaky voice, “What do you want?”

Yang Kai shrugged, “I just want to have a look. I’m not going to do anything.”

“In your dreams!”

Yang Kai cupped his hands around his mouth again and just as he took a deep breath to shout, the girl snapped, “That’s enough!”

She glared at him fiercely, but he simply looked back at her with a smile. In the end, she surrendered in defeat. Reaching out her hand, she plucked the green leaf from her head. At the same time, the beefy body immediately shrank in size and returned to the appearance of a young girl.

“You will regret this!” She spat as she bit her red lips, her eyes burning with resentment and fury, like there was an irreconcilable grudge between them.

“En, this is much better. You should just act like a girl. Why bother disguising yourself as a man?” He laughed softly.

Having seen so many wild beauties among the Ancient Barbarian Race, the appearance of a more normal girl suddenly gave off such a kind and comfortable vibe.

“Have you seen your fill?!” The girl snapped impatiently, placing the green leaf back on her head and turning back into the beefy man’s appearance in an instant.

Yang Kai shook his head and sighed, feeling dissatisfied. Even so, he asked curiously, “Is that an illusion spell? Why didn’t I feel any power fluctuations when you cast your Shamanic Spells?”

That strange green leaf seemed to hold an incredible effect. The girl’s appearance changed drastically with the green leaf on her body, but her real appearance was instantly revealed once she took it off. At first, Yang Kai thought that the green leaf was some kind of medium she used to perform her illusions; however, he felt something was amiss after considering it carefully.

From the looks of it, that green leaf was similar to a Green Coin. It was clearly a leaf of the Evergreen Divine Tree; still, Yang Kai had not heard of any Shamanic Spells that required a medium like this to cast.

“Why do you care? I’ve returned your money back to you, what else do you want?” She was extremely annoyed. Letting him see her true appearance was her biggest mistake so far as it could be said that he was holding her weakness in his hands. She would be at his mercy from now on.

Fortunately, Yang Kai was not as despicable as she imagined and after pondering for a moment, he simply asked, “What is your name?”

The girl fell silent for a moment. Then, she replied, “It’s Tiea!”

“My name is Ah Niu!” Yang Kai responded with a smile.

“Shaman Niu… I’ll remember you. If there’s nothing else, I’m leaving!” Tiea said, and seeing that he had no objections, she turned and left.

Yang Kai watched as her back disappeared out of sight, laughing softly to himself before going off to purchase the herbs he needed.

The next day, Yang Kai finished refining enough healing medicine and walked out of the Tree Cave; however, he did not go down immediately. He controlled the direction and floated over to another Tree Cave not far away before reaching out and knocking on the trunk.

Soon, a head popped out from within the Tree Cave. That person stared at him in surprise and stuttered, “H-H-How did you know that I live here?!”

This neighbour of his was none other than Tiea, the girl he met yesterday.

Tiea’s eyes were full of panic upon meeting Yang Kai again, not to mention that it was at her doorstep.

“I saw you come back here by chance yesterday.”

“What do you want?!” Tiea wished she were dead. She was fearless even when she had been caught red-handed stealing his money at the time; however, the fact that he knew her identity as part of the Nomad Clan left her at a loss for what to do. It was the first time somebody had seen through her disguise after she began living here more than ten years ago.

“Don’t be so nervous.” Yang Kai smiled slightly, “I just have a favour to ask of you.”

“What is it?” She furrowed her brow.

“You should know that I’ve been selling medicine for the past few days, right? It’s because you know that you decided to rob me, right?”

She frowned in response to his words and replied to his questions with silence.

“In that case, this will be easy.” While speaking, he handed her the stone pots in his hand.

Of course, she did not take the pot and instead stared at him suspiciously before asking, “What do you want?”

“Help me sell my medicine. You should know the price. I’ll give you ten percent of the profits.”

Upon hearing those words, Tiea’s eyes lit up and she exclaimed, “Really?!”

“I’ve already handed my goods to you. What do you mean by ‘really’?”

Following that, she hurriedly took the stone pots from him, feeling over the moon. After all, the man in front of her could earn thousands of Green Coins a day just by selling this healing medicine. Ten percent of the profits would be a few hundred Green Coins a day. Although it wasn’t that much, it was still far better than stealing from others.

“Why?” Tiea couldn’t understand. Logically speaking, it was good enough if he generously did not cause trouble with her or expose her identity after she stole from him yesterday, so why was he now sharing such huge benefits with her?
