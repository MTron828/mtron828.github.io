“Hey, seriously? What is the situation in the outside world today? You lowlifes have actually been driven back all the way here? Has my Human Race flourished so much that you are no longer their match?”

“There are not many Innate Royal Lords anymore, hm? Most of you are Acquired and have advanced from below. It looks like a lot of those who went out from here died already.”

“Look, don’t waste your energy. Do you think that this Old Master will be easy for you to defeat? Save your energy and take a break. Isn’t it better for us to have a chat? Hello?”

“Hey you, yes, the one with the horns on your head. Yes, you, tell me how things are out there? In exchange, I can give you a gift.”

…..

The Black Ink Strength surged as they madly attacked; however, even with the combined efforts of 24 Royal Lords they couldn’t even scratch Cang.

The more he nagged, the fiercer the Royal Lords attacked. It was as if they were determined to shut him up.

At one point, a voice from the dark depths exclaimed in surprise, “You can control Shi’s power? The power to devour?”

Although Cang’s movements were extremely subtle, they were still detectable so he usually concealed them extremely well. However, this time, he accidentally revealed something.

Cang laughed and said, “Oh, you’ve found out.”

The voice said coldly, “So that’s why! Old thing, no wonder you survived for so many years! You can control Shi’s power!”

Cang sighed and said, “Not like I can help it. This damned place has been turned into a soulless, spiritless land by your underlings, so if this Old Master wants to live, the only way is to secretly steal from you from time to time.”

For countless years, he had relied on the manipulation of Shi’s power to occasionally devour some energy from the darkness in order to survive; otherwise, he would have died many years ago.

The voice in the darkness sneered and said, “You’re really good at hiding. You managed to hide your flaws for so many years that even I was unaware of it.”

“It was unbecoming of me to keep it from you, the Master of this domain. Now that you’ve found out, should I be ashamed of it?”

“I’m afraid that you’ve forgotten how Shi died.”

“I can’t help it. This is the only way if I want to live.”

How could Cang not know how Shi died? It was because Shi had devoured too much Black Ink Strength and was at risk of being corrupted by it that he had to integrate himself into the restriction at the last moment.

The voice in the darkness laughed coldly and said, “Very well, you want it, don’t you? If you want it so badly, then I’ll give it to you!”

Cang frowned and called out hastily, “Mo, do not be rash. Let’s talk about this!”

The voice in the darkness kept silent and the power rumbled more and more fiercely.

Cang was originally withered to skin and bones, but now, he visibly swelled up. In the blink of an eye, he turned into a plump old man.

This transformation was not done though as his body continued to expand and soon bulged up, like a blown-up ball.

“Stop stop!” Cang shouted, appearing terrified as he yelled, “Mo, stop, if you keep doing this, this Old Master will burst!”

Mo naturally would not stop. He wanted nothing more than to make this noisy old man explode.

The 24 Royal Lords saw this scene from outside the restriction and smiled happily. They felt re-invigorated, and increased the intensity of their attacks.

After a few moments, Cang’s whole body was swollen into a ball. He was so puffed up that no one could see his facial features. He seemed like he could burst at any moment.

He shouted with difficulty, “I can’t, I can’t hold on anymore!”

After he said so, he lifted his chubby palm and thrusted it forward.

The Royal Lords, who were bombarding him indiscriminately, instantly froze as if death itself had enveloped them.

In the darkness, Mo suddenly roared, “Dodge!”

But it was too late.

When Cang thrust his fat palm out, the vast void trembled and the restriction which covered the darkness visibly rippled.

The five closest Royal Lords were swept up by the violent burst of power and instantly exploded into blood mist.

More Royal Lords behind them were hit hard and began to bleed.

The whole world suddenly fell silent with just one blow.

Cang’s swollen body, which was like a round ball, now began to deflate and shrink rapidly. He eventually reverted to an old man, heaved a long sigh of relief, and said, “Ah… much more comfortable.”

The Royal Lords, who were still alive, were all terrified as they stared at Cang with immense fear.

They were Royal Lords, the most powerful in existence in this world. 24 of them joined hands to attack Cang for so long but they couldn’t even hurt him. However, with just one counter-attack, five Royal Lords perished and more than 10 of them were seriously injured. The ones who weren’t further injured were simply lucky to have avoided the blow.

The power of that palm just now had surpassed their understanding.

There should not be such a force in this world.

A while later, Mo angrily scolded, “You tricked me!”

Just now, when Cang pleaded for him to stop, he really thought that this old thing was about to burst, so he spared no effort to funnel more power into him. In reality, Cang was borrowing his power to fight! Thus, once Cang unleashed the accumulated power, it violently blasted out, resulting in casualties among the Royal Lords. It could be said that the power of that blow was not his real strength, but his combined with Mo’s.

The Royal Lords were unaware of what happened, but Mo understood. He knew that Cang’s attack was done with the help of his power and also the power of the entire restriction, that was why the damage it inflicted was so terrifying.

It was impossible for Cang to do this with his strength alone.

If he really had such strength, he would not have been trapped here so close to the restriction for so long.

“How dare you lie to me!” Mo roared hysterically, as if he was a jilted woman.

Cang shuddered a little as his body was covered in goosebumps, “Settle down Mo. Don’t make frivolous accusations as if this Old Master has taken advantage of you. Furthermore, isn’t it expected that I would fool you? You’re such an idiot and deserve to be fooled.”

“You lied to me back then too!” Mo hissed, “You led me here, and laid this restriction, imprisoning me for millions of years! You all deserve to die!”

Cang sighed slightly and said, “It really couldn’t be helped, Mo. Your power… is just too overbearing, if you weren’t imprisoned here, the 3,000 Worlds would have been destroyed long ago. Haven’t we old guys been accompanying you? Now, there is only one old man left, while everyone else is dead.”

Mo coldly laughed, “There’s no way for you to live any longer!”

It was a huge restriction that required someone to be here to make sure Mo remained trapped; thus, those Cang mentioned had to remain here at all times.

Unfortunately, Mo’s life and no natural end while those people who guarded this place were not immortals. Regardless of how strong they were, they would eventually pass away.

“So be it, the past is the past, let’s not mention it anymore,” Cang waved his hand with a look of despair and continued, “This Old Master will not last long. When this Old Master dies, you will no longer be trapped. Then whatever you do in this vast universe is none of my concern.”

There was a long silence in the darkness before Mo muttered, “I await that day.”

Cang raised his eyebrows and asked, “Do you want to do it yourself? Just like earlier, perhaps if we do it a few more times, this Old Master will really burst!”

“Hmph!” Mo coldly snorted, fell silent, and ignored him.

Cang looked at the 19 Royal Lords who were still alive, waved to them casually, and asked, “Shall we continue?”

The Royal Lords looked terrified and none of them dared to move.

Since they knew that this man could devour Black Ink Strength and turn it into his own power, why would they still want to fight against him? They just witnessed him vaporise five Royal Lords with a simple thrust of his palm!

If he did it a few more times, they would all die meaninglessly.

The next moment, the Royal Lords seemed to have received some instructions. All of them bowed towards the darkness where Mo was sealed, turned around, and dashed off. Soon, they were nowhere to be seen.

Cang secretly heaved a sigh of relief at this sight.

Although Mo’s intelligence had grown considerably compared to back then, and he was much more mature, making it not as easy to deal with him, he was still rather naive. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

If he really pumped up Cang a few more times with his power, Cang was certain that he would not be able to survive.

After all, there were originally 10 guardians of this huge restriction; however, he was now the only one remaining.

He could still make use of the restriction, but he was now all alone.

He sighed in his heart as he looked in the direction of where the Royal Lords departed, “Shi, if you do not return soon, this Old Master really won’t be able to hold up much longer…”

[Will I be able to last until that day?]

He had guarded this place for so many eons, in this barren place with no means of restoring his strength or increasing his lifespan. One by one, his old friends exhausted their powers and died. Before they died, all of them integrated themselves into the restriction to reinforce it.

The last one to leave was Shi.

Before integrating his body into the restriction, Shi told Cang a plan that he would retain a trace of his Soul, which would cross the void, and return to the 3,000 Worlds.

Doing so, he might have a chance to live again.

He wanted to find a complete solution to the problem in his next life.

Needless to say, this was an extremely bold plan, because even Shi, himself, did not know whether it would work.

But there was always hope.

Now, more than 100,000 years had passed yet Shi still had not returned. Cang did not know whether his plan had worked or not.

Perhaps Shi’s Soul never made it back to the 3,000 Worlds.

After all, the road was very dangerous, with plenty of traps. An empty spirituality did not have the slightest self-preservation power and might be destroyed if it encountered any dangers.

Even if Shi managed to return to the 3,000 Worlds, there was very little chance that he could resurrect.

Cang was mentally prepared for this. The reason why he agreed to this plan was also because there was really no other way. A sliver of hope was better than sitting on the sidelines and waiting to die.

However, after waiting for so many years, Shi’s plan must have failed; otherwise, he should have heard something from him in these 100,000 years.

The good thing was, now the descendants of the Human Race had finally struck back. They actually were able to drive back the Royal Lords from the outside, allowing Cang to see a glimmer of hope again.
