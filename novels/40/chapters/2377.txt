Fan Xin of Ice Heart Pavilion soon buddied up with Ling Yin Qin and they secretly communicated with each other through Divine Sense.

Soon after, Ling Yin Qin looked up at Yang Kai and asked, “This Junior Sister Fan has a very good offer. I’m going to sell the goods to her. What do you say?”

When she asked this, it was clear she was just making a show for Fan Xin. What’s more, her cultivation was a little higher than Fan Xin, so there was no problem with calling her Junior Sister.

Fan Xin immediately looked at Yang Kai with an expectant face. She had been here for almost half a day and didn’t manage to purchase anything. Now, she finally saw a glimmer of light. As long as Yang Kai nodded, she would be able to receive a lot of goods, so she was naturally excited.

Yang Kai smiled, “Sell it to her then.”

Fan Xin instantly beamed, “Many thanks to this Senior Sister and Little Brother. Please rest assured, we at Ice Heart Pavilion always do fair business and will offer appropriate prices.”

Ling Yin Qin lightly agreed, “I’ve long heard of Ice Heart Pavilion’s famed name, otherwise, I wouldn’t have sold everything to you so readily.”

While speaking, the two of them exchanged goods and money quickly. Yang Kai peeped over and found that in addition to Source Crystals, Fan Xin also handed some Spirit Pills to Ling Yin Qin.

After receiving the goods, Fan Xin looked extremely happy and her attitude also became more and more enthusiastic, “Little Brother, if you have anything to sell in the future, don’t forget about this Mistress. The price is negotiable.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Of course.”

“Let’s go,” Ling Yin Qin called out to them and led Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun towards the front.

After walking out from the noisy docks, the three of them stopped and waited for the others to arrive.

After about an incense stick of time, the dozen crew members all returned, each of them exuberant and joyful. Their harvest was obviously not small, and what they sold just now was only a small portion of their harvest this trip. There was still a lot that had not been taken out.

The 100,000 pieces of Grey Feather Coral were too large an amount, so it was obviously not suitable for them to sell it at the docks. Ling Yin Qin was going to wait until they returned to Clear Sky City to process it.

The harvest from this trip alone would be enough to keep them well-fed for the next three years, and they could also move to a better place.

After a short walk, a huge city appeared in front of them. Even the gates were huge, looking like the jaws of a beast, ready to find someone to devour. Right above the gates were three characters, ‘Clear Sky City’!

There were guards stationed outside the city and whether they were going in or out, anyone passing by would have to pay a Low-Rank Source Crystal or something of corresponding value before they could pass.

When Yang Kai saw this, he frowned.

Source Crystals were very valuable in this Solitary Void Sealed World. He thought he could enter and leave as he pleased as long as he had an Identity Token, but he didn’t expect that he would still have to pay Source Crystals. One piece of Low-Rank Source Crystal was nothing for him, but for the poor cultivators who had lived here for so long, it was no doubt a great fortune.

There weren’t many people in front of the gates, only the cultivators who had returned from the docks earlier and were lining up to enter the city. From how no one was leaving the city, it was clear that the cultivators in Clear Sky City didn’t want to spend that one Source Crystal to come and go as they pleased either, only when they had to go out to sea or absolutely had to leave the city.

Ling Yin Qin’s group of a dozen easily entered the city after paying the dozen Source Crystals and verifying everyone’s Identity Tokens.

Yang Kai was a little worried that his identity as a newcomer would be exposed, but when he saw how simply everything went, he realized that he was worried for nothing.

A lively scene unfurled once they were inside the city. There were many cultivators in the city with shops lining both sides of the street and an endless stream of cultivators brushing past each other’s shoulders.

But Yang Kai soon found some parts different from normal cities. Many cultivators were sitting cross-legged on both sides of the street, gazing vacantly ahead.

There were quite a few of these cultivators, but regardless of their cultivation level, their auras were extremely weak. It seemed like all of them had not cultivated for a long time and were just sitting there, not moving.

Not only that, but there were also many people dressed like beggars on the streets, constantly begging for something, but they hardly got anything.

Yang Kai frowned. He did not expect the inside of the seemingly prosperous Clear Sky City to be so depressing.

“These are all pitiful people,” Ling Yin Qin sighed. “Without cultivation resources, their cultivation drops day after day, and they can’t even go out to sea to look for harvest anymore. So, other than begging, all they can do is wait for death.”

Hearing her say so, Yang Kai realized why the streets were like this now. Having to see this after he had only just entered the city, who knew how many people were waiting to die in the entire Clear Sky City just like this?

“Is there really no way to get out of here?” Yang Kai asked.

Ling Yin Qin shook her head, “I’ve never heard of anyone leaving here successfully.”

As the two were talking, an angry shout suddenly sounded from not far away, “You little rat, how dare you steal from me!”

The shout was accompanied by the commotion of a crowd nearby, and occasionally the sounds of fighting.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and immediately found out what was going on. It seems that a cultivator had been robbed, and the person being robbed was a First-Order Dao Source Realm, while the person robbing him was only a Second-Order Origin King. Not only was his cultivation much weaker than the other person, but his aura was so weak that he may not even be able to bring out his real strength.

This kind of death courting act would definitely never happen outside this Small Sealed World, but it seemed to be common here in Clear Sky City. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

With two bangs, the robber was immediately killed and the cultivator got his Space Ring back. That First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator was about to start hurling insults when countless people with vacant expressions on their faces suddenly came over. The originally hollow eyes of these guys were currently bloodshot and all of them were eyeing the cultivator’s Space Ring. It wasn’t long before a fight broke out.

The owner of the Space Ring was a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, but two fists can’t block four strikes. Even though he managed to kill several of them in quick succession, no one was deterred and he was soon swamped by the crowd.

*Shua shua...*

While they were engaged in a heated battle, two figures suddenly descended from the sky. These two men had imposing auras and were dressed in black fitted robes. With a cold sneer on their faces, they watched the fight ahead, without any intention of stopping it.

“Those guys are from Clear Sky City’s law enforcement team,” Jiao Yi whispered to Yang Kai beside him.

“And they don’t care about this?” Yang Kai asked, surprised. Since they were from the law enforcement team, then naturally they should want to maintain the peace of the city, so why were they acting so indifferent when there was a fight happening right in front of them?

Jiao Yi sneered, “You’ll see.”

*Peng peng!*

Another two robbers were sent flying by the ring’s owner, but that man also seemed to be growing exhausted. Even though his situation was better than those who were either begging or waiting for death, his cultivation had clearly regressed a lot since arriving on this island. There was simply no way for him to display the full might of a Dao Source Realm cultivator now and was already battered, bruised, and exhausted from this brief fight.

When he looked up, he just so happened to see the two black-robed law enforcement officers and quickly shouted, “Sirs, please help me! These people are lawless and dare they rob people in broad daylight! Please sirs, deliver justice here!”

The two enforcers did not move, but instead watched on coldly.

The owner of the ring shouted again, “Sirs, please do something! This humble one is willing to pay half of what he has in his Space Ring as a reward!”

Upon hearing this, one of the enforcers sneered, “Only half?”

The owner of the ring gritted his teeth and said bitterly, “I’ll offer all of it to the two Sirs...”

He knew that if he didn’t get help now, then he may end up killed by these lawless people. Compared to his own life, what was everything else worth?

Only then did the two enforcers walk forward lazily. The person who spoke earlier grunted, “Little Brat, since you’re so sensible, we’ll give you a hand.”

After he said this, the two people moved in unison, greeting the crowd with ruthlessness. With a surge of energy, they blasted out the robbers directly, causing countless casualties and creating a strong smell of blood around them.

As soon as the two of them attacked, the cultivators around them turned silent out of fear. The robbers who were lucky to still be alive immediately scattered as they didn’t dare to remain any longer.

The only person left on the ground was the cultivator who was being robbed. He was lying there covered in blood, looking to be in a miserable state.

One of the enforcers walked over and raised his hand to suck the fallen man’s Space Ring into his palm. After searching it with his Divine Sense, he frowned and spat, “Broke bastard! Is this all you have?”

After saying that, he spat in disgust at the cultivator once more before walking off.

“This guy will also have no choice but to wait for death from now on.” Jiao Yi sighed.

The cultivator who was robbed probably didn’t have much in the first place, but now he had even lost his Space Ring, unless he could find a ship he could follow out to sea soon, he would definitely be reduced to just waiting for death here like those guys who were robbing him earlier.

“This place is such a mess.” Yang Kai’s face sank.

Ling Yin Qin said, “When one reaches the end of the road, one is capable of doing anything. Those people were forced to this point.”

Yang Kai felt silent as he knew what Ling Yin Qin said was correct.

These robbers were already waiting for death, what else could still scare them? But what Yang Kai could not believe was the fact that even the law enforcers in Clear Sky City were so dirty.

To put it nicely, what happened earlier was adding salt to a wound, in frank terms though, it was blatant robbery.

It seemed like Clear Sky City was without laws. It must have been hard for Ling Yin Qin and the others to have stayed here for so long.

“Things are a little more chaotic out here in the Outer City, but the Inner City is safer. Things like this won’t happen there,” Ling Yin Qin explained.

“Do you stay in the Outer City or Inner City?” Yang Kai asked.

Jiao Yi answered, “Outer City, but we’ll be able to move to the Inner City in just a few days.”

Their harvest was not small this time, and it was enough for them to rent a pretty good cave mansion in the Inner City. Even though life was generally more expensive in the Inner City, it was safer, so the cost was worth it.

Ling Yin Qin advised, “Senior Brother Yang, you just arrived so it’s best you rent a cave mansion to stay in. Then you can slowly get familiarized with this place.”

“That’s what I was planning to do.” Yang Kai nodded. He had no idea how long he would have to stay in Clear Sky Island, but he had to find a place to stay regardless.
