Chapter 67 - You can’t compare to him

At that moment, you could even say that Wei Zhuan was oh so regretful.

He was shocked that his Embroidered Cloud Locking Mail was unable to block even a single blow from his opponent, and was crying over the tear in his defensive artifact. That was because it had lost all its defensive properties now.

He was extremely angry. Turning his body around, Wei Zhuan jumped towards Kai Yang and bellowed: “You dared to break my defensive artifact! I want you to die!”

Wei Zhuan was also at the initial element third stage, so when his strength burst out, it didn’t lose to Kai Yangs. But, unfortunately for him, when Kai Yang was still at the tempered body stage, he could already kill someone at the initial element fifth stage. How could an insignificant person at the initial element third stage gain any advantage?

When Wei Zhuan reached Kai Yang, the blood red blade criss-crossed through the air, slashing Wei Zhuan multiple times, leaving various wounds.

Wei Zhuan’s body immediately froze, his fist stopping three inches away from Kai Yang. No matter how much he struggled, he couldn’t move a step further because he felt a scalding hot feeling.

Shuddering, his eyes turned to face the ground. Only to see the blood red blade in Kai Yang’s hand, like a quick snake attacking incessantly.

“A defensive artifact isn’t all it’s made out to be.” Kai Yang sneered as his eyes swept over the Embroidered Cloud Locking Mail on Wei Zhuan’s body; it was full of holes and tears.

Kai Yang was also shocked, because he also hadn’t predicted that his Yang Liquid blade would be this powerful; it was actually this sharp.

Speaking of which, Kai Yang really wanted to fight Wei Zhuan. Originally he thought he would have to use some power, but currently he had only used one drop of the Yang Liquid, to dominate him.

Since the opponent used the Embroidered Cloud Locking Mail, why couldn’t he use Yang Liquid.

“Come and try to injure me!” Wei Zhuan’s cheeks trembled, looking at Kai Yang with a bit of resentment. Even though his life was in the hands of Kai Yang, he wasn’t the least bit afraid because he was the grandson of the Grand Elder! With a person holding such an honorable position backing him, no one in Sky Tower would dare injure him.

“Brat, you probably don’t know but my grandfather is the Grand Elder so if you dare injure me, you are looking for death!” Full of confidence, Wei Zhuan looked over at Kai Yang threateningly.

Kai Yang did have a reaction when he heard this, the blood red blade between his fingers becoming more menacing and the red glint in his eyes appeared more ferocious than before.

“I don’t know whether it’s you who dies first or me?” Kai Yang said to Wei Zhuan, his voice full of interest. On his face was a strange smile, and he slowly exerted strength with his fingers.

Slowly, a trickle of dark red blood dripped down from Wei Zhuan’s chest and he couldn’t help but let out a groan. In the moment that he got injured, Wei Zhuan felt a rush of boiling hot World Qi enter him, burning his skin and flesh painfully.

“You actually dared.........” Wei Zhuan looked at Kai Yang in disbelief. He couldn’t believe that there were still people in Sky Tower who dared to injure him.

“Whether I dared or not, I have already done it. Do you say I don’t dare?” Kai Yang continued to exert strength and pushed the blade half an inch deeper, causing the blood to continuously flow out. Showing his cowardly inside Wei Zhuan cried out: “Aren’t you afraid that my grandfather will kill you!”

“In the comparing of notes between disciples, one is responsible for their own life and death!” Kai Yang sneered out coldly, “If you can’t compare to others, you can’t blame others for killing you. What can the Grand Elder do? Sky Tower Pavilion does not belong to him.”

Wei Zhuan, to this frantic to the point of craziness disciple, felt shivers and cold all over.

Just as he was about to speak, Kai Yang suddenly interrupted him: “If you say I concede, these two words, I will kill you. So don’t even think about it.”

Wei Zhuan became deathly white because he had just thought of conceding. In a battle between disciples, if one felt that they were unable to match up against their opponent, they were able to concede. Then their opponent could not pursue them or attack them any further.

But now he didn’t dare to say these two words, because he couldn’t see any hint that Kai Yang was joking in his crazy but serious eyes.

“What do you really want to do?” Wei Zhuan clenched his teeth as he asked this. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I’m don’t want to do anything. I’m just thinking how you can’t compare to Su Mu because you relied on your defensive artifact to win against him!” Kai Yang said as he slowly shook his head.

“I can’t compare to him?” Wei Zhuan was like a cat that had its tail stepped on. Lowly shouting: “How can I not compare to him? My strength is higher than his, my status is also higher, so how am I not comparable to him?”

Kai Yang shifted his head to the side: “You don’t believe me? I’ll show you.”

Stopping his words, Kai Yang exerted some strength with his fingers causing Wei Zhuan face to contort and shiver uncontrollably.

Kai Yang turned around to size up Wei Zhuan’s underlings. Previously they were fighting against Li Yun Tian and the others with all their might. But as soon as they saw Wei Zhaun fall, they stopped fighting and didn’t dare to do anything other than stare stupidly.

“Do you want to save your young master Wei Zhuan?” Kai Yang asked them.

No one dared to reply because they were all terrified at Kai Yang’s craziness. After his display of ferociousness, how could any of the ten or so young men dare to confront him?

“If you want to save him, then obediently kneel down and admit you were wrong! If I feel merciful, I will spare him!” Kai Yang coldly laughed out.

Their faces paled, this......didn’t Wei Zhuan just say this to Su Mu’s underlings?

After Su Mu’s underlings heard this, they had kneeled without hesitation and kowtowed to Wei Zhuan. Did that mean they had to do the same?

These people just stared, because if they kneeled, then they would lose a great amount of face. Without face, how could they continue to stay in Sky Tower? But if they didn’t kneel and Wei Zhuan blamed them, what would they do?

Each person’s face was different, each contemplative and unsure as to which decision to make.

“It looks like you want him to die.” Kai Yang sighed out softly, and pushed the blade a bit further into Wei Zhuan’s body.

Wei Zhuan cried out in fright, because he could feel that if the blade in Kai Yang’s hands were to penetrate even deeper, then it would stab his heart.

That was a fatal attack!

Wei Zhuan didn’t want to die and shouted out in desperation with a hoarse voice at his underlings: “Why are you still dawdling? Hurry up and kneel down! If I am to die, then none of you shall be spared!”

Only then did the underlings under Wei Zhuan shake their bodies and kneel down.

Watching this scene, Li Yun Tian and the others were overwhelmed with emotions, because the previous injustices they had suffered were being washed away by their actions. They were much more carefree.

Kai Yang turned back to Wei Zhuan, enthusiastically saying: “Now do you know the difference between you and Su Mu?”

Wei Zhuan looked on blankly before his face suddenly changed and he looked at his underlings with a gaze full of malice.

In order to save Su Mu’s life, Li Yun Tian and the others threw away their pride. But how about his underlings? Only when he had bellowed out and threatened their lives, did they grudgingly obey Kai Yang’s request.

When comparing the two, the difference between Wei Zhuan and Su Mu became clear. In personal charisma, Wei Zhuan couldn’t compare to Su Mu.

“Are you satisfied now?” Wei Zhuan asked, looking at Kai Yang coldly.

Kai Yang narrowed his eyes, his expression unreadable.

Wei Zhuan turned pale with fright and said in a shrill voice: “You can’t possibly.....”

But before Kai Yang could reply, from afar, a voice bellowed out in rage: “Detain them all!”

p.s. Ho ho ho! I wonder which powerful guy has come over in a fit! Is it Su Mu’s elder? Or is it Wei Zhuan’s granddaddy? Or is it Kai Yang’s potential backer??? Hmmmmmm??? Anyway, please thank Joseph G. again for sponsoring this chapter! 😀
