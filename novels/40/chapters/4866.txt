As time passed, more Open Heaven Realm Masters from different parts of the 3,000 Worlds steamed into Black Territory. They were then sent to the different Ore Stars to extract materials.

Since Yang Kai was already one of them, he had the right to know more information about the Black Prison.

The number of Black Ink Disciples was increasing by the day. In just one month, the number had increased by several hundred people. Moreover, several Black Ink Disciples would head over to the place where the Black Ink Clansman was imprisoned and crash into the Grand Array to kill themselves every day.

Their reason for doing so was to feed their World Forces to the Black Ink Clansman after their death so that the latter could restore his strength.

Luan Bai Feng was extremely cautious about this and never let a lot of Black Ink Disciples make a move at the same time; after all, the secret might be exposed if a lot of people went missing all of a sudden. Hence, it was the best arrangement to let several die each day. No one would care about the life or death of a small number of people who had gone missing. They were all attracted to the abundant materials on the Ore Stars in Black Territory.

Yang Kai would look around Black Territory every day. Everything he saw and the information he had gathered made him feel heartbroken.

If the situation was left unhindered, it would only take a few decades for the number of Black Ink Disciples to grow to a staggering figure. Besides that, the most important thing was that the Black Ink Clansman trapped in the Black Prison would also be freed. When that time came, the entire universe would be gripped by a reign of terror.

Nevertheless, Yang Kai was unable to stop it now. A Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master might be able to reign as an overlord of a normal Great Territory, and the fact that he was a Great Emperor from the Star Boundary allowed him to stand on equal footing with the envoys of the Cave Heavens and Paradises. However, at the end of the day, this kind of cultivation was too weak in the face of a major crisis that could affect the entire 3,000 Worlds.

His power was completely insufficient in this matter.

Yang Kai felt a great sense of helplessness, so he could only hope that the powerful Masters from the Cave Heavens and Paradises would arrive at Black Territory soon to take charge of this matter. Only the old fossils who had cultivated in seclusion for millennia had the right to go against the imprisoned Black Ink Clan and end this threat once and for all.

One day, upon receiving Luan Bai Feng’s invitation, Yang Kai arrived at a Grand Hall.

There was no one else in the Grand Hall as Luan Bai Feng was already waiting inside. Seeing him, she nodded.

Yang Kai looked around and asked curiously, “What’s wrong?”

Luan Bai Feng replied with a smile, “Wait a moment.”

A short time later, a timid-looking person walked into the Grand Hall. When Yang Kai realised who the person was, he couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

The person was none other than Yuan Tong Guang, a Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master from White Fang Province.

Upon seeing Luan Bai Feng and Yang Kai, Yuan Tong Guang sported an anxious expression. He hastened his pace and cupped his fist, “Greetings, Sect Master Yang, Warden Luan.”

Even though he was just here to hand in some materials and get his reward, he still felt apprehensive.

During this period of time, he and his fellow Brothers from the same Sect had extracted quite a lot Black Stones on Ore Star 16. After spending some effort to dissolve the Black Stones, they were lucky to obtain quite some materials. Most of the materials didn’t really matter much, but amidst their harvest, they actually managed to acquire a Seventh-Order Earth Element material.

According to the rules in Black Territory, high Order materials had to be handed over immediately; therefore, Yuan Tong Guang quickly returned from Ore Star 16 and informed Luan Bai Feng’s subordinate about it.

The person directly brought him to the Grand Hall. Yuan Tong Guang had never expected that Luan Bai Feng and Yang Kai would be waiting for him there.

However, after giving it a thought, he realised it was expected that those from Black Territory had to take this seriously; after all, this one material could be traded for 10 million Open Heaven Pills.

10 million Open Heaven Pills was an astronomical figure for a force like White Fang Province. It had to be noted that this amount of money was almost enough to purchase a complete set of Fifth-Order materials. It would allow them to create a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, which would bring White Fang Province to greater heights.

When Yang Kai first entered the 3,000 Worlds, those from Great Moon Province had given him some compensation because of the matter regarding the Golden Crow’s carcass. The compensation was only 100,000 Open Heaven Pills, which was the maximum amount of money that those from Great Moon Province could take out at once.

Great Moon Province and White Fang Province were similar in terms of their power and financial strength. It could be said that for someone like Yuan Tong Guang to possess 100,000 Open Heaven Pills, he would be considered wealthy, not to mention 10 million. That was an unimaginable amount of wealth.

“This Yuan has obtained a Seventh-Order Earth Element material on Ore Star 16. Please inspect it.” Without any delay, Yuan Tong Guang told them the purpose of his visit and held out the Seventh-Order Earth Element material with both hands.

“You’ve done a good job.” Luan Bai Feng extended her hand and sucked the Seventh-Order Earth Element material towards herself before stuffing it into her Space Ring. She didn’t even intend to examine it. She then turned to Yang Kai and said smilingly, “Weren’t you curious about how to transform a cultivator into a companion? You can give it a try now.”

While Yang Kai sported a dispassionate expression, Yuan Tong Guang was puzzled.

Supposedly, after he presented the Seventh-Order Earth Element material, Luan Bai Feng would give him his reward; however, instead of seeing any reward, he heard some puzzling words from the woman.

He instinctively felt a great sense of unease. Could everything he had heard be false? Was Luan Bai Feng going to kill him so that she didn’t have to give him the 10 million Open Heaven Pills? However, if she really did that, her reputation would be severely tarnished. In that case, the people who had come to Black Territory to help with mining materials would no longer trust her.

Just when he was doubtful, Yang Kai suddenly took a step forward and pointed a finger at him.

As Space Principles undulated, Yuan Tong Guang was instantly bound in place.

He was only a Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so how was he supposed to defend himself against Yang Kai? Since the Binding Secret Technique had activated, there was no escaping now.

“Sect Master Yang?” Yuan Tong Guang’s expression changed drastically as he was now certain that he was doomed; however, he didn’t understand the reason behind it.

As Yang Kai was facing away from Luan Bai Feng, he looked apologetically at the other man.

He had indeed asked Luan Bai Feng about how to turn a cultivator into one of their companions, but he was only doing so to gather information. It never crossed his mind that she would make him do it.

He wouldn’t dare to show the slightest hesitation, for that might cause his secret to be exposed. The powerful cultivators from the Cave Heavens and Paradises hadn’t arrived yet, so if he was exposed at this point, he might trigger some unexpected consequences, and he wouldn’t be able to bear the responsibility for that.

As he stood in front of Yuan Tong Guang, he could see the fear and pleading behind the other man’s eyes.

Just then, Luan Bai Feng’s voice was heard coming from behind him, “Activate the Black Ink Essence in your Small Universe. That’s Master’s power, and no one can resist it!”

Without saying anything, Yang Kai lifted his hand as a squirming black fog formed on his palm.

An evil aura permeated the hall and made Yuan Tong Guang feel a great sense of discomfort.

He became increasingly horrified as he pleaded, “Please spare my life, Sect Master Yang! There are no grudges between us, and no one from White Fang Province has ever offended you! Please don’t kill me!”

“Don’t worry. I’m not killing you,” Yang Kai said, “In fact, I am going to grant you the most wondrous gift.”

Upon finishing his words, he covered Yuan Tong Guang’s face with his palm.

The squirming black fog seemed to have come to life as it streamed into Yuan Tong Guang’s body through his seven orifices.

Yuan Yong Guang widened his eyes and started shaking violently. A gurgling sound was heard coming from his throat, as though he was going through an unimaginable torture.

However, he was still bound to the spot by Yang Kai’s Space Principles, so regardless of how hard he struggled, he could never break free.

A moment later, the Black Ink Strength’s aura billowed from Yuan Tong Guang’s body as his eyes gradually darkened until they became completely black.

He slowly stopped struggling, as though he had resigned to fate.

“You can release him now,” Luan Bai Feng said from behind.

Yang Kai dispelled his Binding Technique, after which Yuan Tong Guang collapsed to the ground.

With a frown, Yang Kai asked, “Is it done?”

Luan Bai Feng shook her head, “It’s not that easy. Although the Master’s power is profound, it isn’t easy to transform a cultivator into a companion. It depends on how strong the other party’s willpower is. The time it takes the Black Ink Strength to invade a Small Universe also varies.”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai felt his chest tightening as it was different from his previous pretence.

Luan Bai Feng said with a smile, “We are different of course. It’s much quicker for a Black Ink Insect to transform a person into a companion. Black Ink Essence is much less concentrated and thus takes longer.” She then took a glance at Yuan Tong Guang, who was lying on the ground, “He has basically transformed; all we have to do is wait.”

That was indeed the case.

After just half a day, Yuan Tong Guang was fully transformed into a Black Ink Disciple. He got to his feet and acted normally, but his eyes were now black.

“Greetings, Sir, Madam!” Yuan Tong Guang cupped his fist.

Luan Bai Feng nodded and tossed a Space Ring at him.

Yuan Tong Guang took the ring and infused his Divine Sense into it, after which he realised that there were countless Open Heaven Pills inside.

If he had seen so many Open Heaven Pills before today, he would have been ecstatic; however, he sported an impassive expression at this moment.

“Do you know what you should say after you go back?” Luan Bai Feng asked.

Yuan Tong Guang quickly replied, “I will ensure all know that Sir Yang is a man of his word.”

“Good. You may go now.” Luan Bai Feng waved her hand.

Yuan Tong Guang saluted them again and then left the hall.

After he was gone, Luan Bai Feng looked smilingly at Yang Kai, “See? It’s that easy.”

There was a sense of admiration on Yang Kai’s face, “Master’s power is indeed amazing.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Luan Bai Feng said with a smile, “This is just the tip of the iceberg. Let’s go. I’ll bring you to see something else.”

Upon finishing her words, she led the way for him.

With his curiosity piqued, Yang Kai followed her closely as he wondered what she was about to show him.

Luan Bai Feng led Yang Kai to a very remote place.

There didn’t seem to be anyone passing by here. The visitors in Black Territory were aware that this place was filled with inconspicuous but dangerous Spirit Arrays that were hidden in the void; therefore, the cultivators who were in Black Territory to mine materials wouldn’t dare to wander randomly. They would only travel the paths that had been proven safe.
