“You!”

“How dare you, you brat!”

“Hurry up and release the Great Elder! Otherwise, you will die a miserable death!”

…

Shouts rang out from all around. Meanwhile, Yang Kai held the Great Elder in one hand and swept a sharp gaze across the sky as he sneered softly.

He had been one-sidedly beaten up ever since this Formation was set up. He couldn’t even find the enemy’s shadow. Thus, the rage he had been holding back was still simmering inside him with no place to go. He finally caught hold of one of their weaknesses and captured one of the enemy’s leaders, so how could he give him up so easily?

Over a hundred people had worked together to attack Yang Kai and Lin Yun’er, quite a few of them Emperor Realm Masters. There was even a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master among those numbers. During this period, they vigorously pressured them, fiercely attacked, and ruthlessly tried to kill them, yet now that Yang Kai had seized an opportunity to turn things around, they became furious and started issuing threats.

Yang Kai chuckled softly. Shifting his gaze, he stared at the Great Elder and coldly spat out a single word, “Die!”

“No!” The Great Elder’s expression changed drastically while wailing loudly. Unfortunately, he couldn’t break free from the restraints of that large hand regardless of how hard he struggled.

A violent force squeezed him from all directions and the sounds of bones breaking rang out. At the same time, blood flowed from all seven of his orifices. The Great Elder could distinctly feel his bones snapping and his internal organs being squeezed so hard that they exploded.

*Pa!*

Fresh blood splattered all over the place as the Great Elder’s flesh scattered in all directions.

“Ah!”

“The Great Elder is dead!”

The disciples of Wind and Cloud Pavilion exclaimed in horror. They could not accept what they just saw. The Great Elder was not just anybody. In the Wind and Cloud Pavilion, he was the second most powerful person aside from the Pavilion Master, Hua Xing! However, such a great existence had been single-handedly crushed by that monster!

“How impudent!”

“Avenge the Great Elder!”

They were shocked into silence for a moment before they began to clamour even louder than before.

The Sword Formation was activated once again and sharp swords appeared in every direction again, murderous intent increasing rapidly.

The Yin Yang Five Elements Everchanging Profound Sword Formation was constructed with swords as its base and cultivators proficient in the Sword Dao as its roots. It was basically a killing array. The Great Elder’s death made their murderous intent swell and significantly enhanced the power of the Formation.

It was a pity that the overall strength of the Formation still decreased despite their rage. It couldn’t be helped though as the Great Elder, who was acting as the Formation Core, had died. Meanwhile, the Third Elder, who took over his role, was only a First-Order Emperor. Hence, the power of the Formation Core had been reduced by a whole Minor Realm. It caused the entire Sword Formation to weaken as a result. Even the increase in intensity could not make up for the difference in power caused by the Great Elder’s death.

Yang Kai laughed wildly, “If I can kill one of you, I can kill all of you! Wash your necks and wait for me; I’ll find all of you, one by one then kill each and every one of you!”

“How dare you boast so shamelessly?!” The Third Elder, who linked the Formation, roared and no longer hesitated. As soon as the thought flashed across his mind, an overwhelming sword wave rushed toward Yang Kai again.

Before Yang Kai could react though, Lin Yun’er shouted again, “Seize!”

The moment the words left her mouth, the countless sword waves seemed to receive some sort of command from somebody else. They uniformly changed directions, flew in a certain direction, entered a certain spot, and vanished instantly.

Turning his head to look at her, Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and revealed a look of surprise, “Huh?”

At this moment, Lin Yun’er had her hands held up high and was holding a washbasin-sized item over her head. That item was entirely ink-black and looked extremely plain. It looked like nothing more than the usual iron wok that people used to cook with.

Contrary to appearances though, the plain-looking iron wok was the one to release such an incredible and unimaginable devouring power. All the Sword Qi brought out by the Yin Yang Five Elements Everchanging Profound Sword Formation disappeared after being sucked into it. Like a bottomless pit, that iron wok absorbed all the sword waves that came its way regardless of the number. Moreover, there was no sign of saturation at all.

Even so, what surprised Yang Kai wasn’t the power it displayed but the aura it emitted. It was a very pure and ancient aura, just like the Mountains and Rivers Bell he owned. It felt as though the aura had come from prehistoric times.

“An Ancient Exotic Artifact!” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he was shocked to see that Lin Yun’er had an Ancient Exotic Artifact in her possession.

After all, Ancient Exotic Artifacts were items that had been passed down since ancient times and were extraordinarily rare. The only Ancient Exotic Artifact Yang Kai knew about, aside from his Mountains and Rivers Bell, was Hua Yu Lu’s small flower drum; however, he did not know the extent of Hua Yu Lu’s artifact’s power.

This iron wok was amazing, on the other hand. Just judging by the devouring ability, it was incomparable to ordinary treasures. It was just that it looked… Rather unsightly. At first glance, Yang Kai really thought it was an ordinary wok used for cooking.

“Is that your trump card?” Yang Kai asked curiously.

Lin Yun’er balanced the iron wok on her head and rushed over to him with a smile. She lightly kicked with her feet and stood on his shoulders as she replied without answering his question, “Uncle Yang, you’re so handsome.”

He laughed heartily, “I think so too. You sure have a good eye, Yun’er.”

When the Third Elder heard those words, he nearly spat out a mouthful of blood. This was a life or death battle with the future of a great Sect at stake, so why was the enemy having such a casual conversation?! They were clearly looking down on them!

The Third Elder did know where that iron wok came from, all he knew was that it could bring about a miraculous effect. Even so, he had been angered by Yang Kai and Lin Yun’er’s nonchalance. Just as he was about to activate the power of the Formation again though, he heard exclamations of shock ringing out from all directions.

“Ah!”

“What’s going on?!”

“My sword!”

“Senior Brother, help! My sword is being sucked away!”

“Help you? Damn it… My sword is being sucked away too! I can’t even protect myself right now!”

When those voices rang out, the Third Elder’s expression changed drastically. He recalled the strange occurrence that the Great Elder had experienced before his death and seemed to understand something all of a sudden. Consequently, his expression became horrified.

At that moment, he suddenly felt the longsword in his hands being pulled by a powerful force. It was being drawn towards a certain direction uncontrollably as if to escape his grip. That direction happened to be the location of the little girl holding the iron wok.

*Xiu xiu xiu…*

Streams of light cut through the air, but this time around, it was no longer those non-existing sword waves but actual, genuine Artifacts.

The cultivators forming the Yin Yang Five Elements Everchanging Profound Sword Formation were either in the Third-Order Dao Source Realm or higher; therefore, the artifacts that they owned were naturally of rather high quality. Those Artifacts were Dao Source Grade Mid-Rank at the very least, but many were actually Emperor Artifacts.

Unfortunately, those swords were now flying toward Lin Yun’er and disappearing into the iron wok regardless of whether they were Dao Source Grade or Emperor Grade. In the blink of an eye, the iron wok had collected several dozen longswords. Moreover, more were still to come.

“What in the world is that?!” The Third Elder was horrified as he couldn’t believe that the iron wok would actually be able to snatch away other people’s artifacts! How were they supposed to fight against such an unfair power? He had never even heard of such a strange artifact before!

The power that was trying to devour the sword in his hands was becoming stronger and stronger, and even he had a hard time resisting it. He did not dare to relax his guard and hurriedly focused his attention on controlling his Emperor Artifact.

“Shua shua shua…*

In less than ten breaths, more than ninety swords had been sucked away by the iron wok. A short while later, even the Third Elder could not hold onto his artifact anymore. The sword slipped out of his control with a whoosh and flew away.

“Ah!” The Third Elder screamed as he madly pushed his Secret Art to recall his Emperor Artifact. But, what use would that do? Even the Great Elder had failed, so it was only natural that he couldn’t do any better.

When the last sword disappeared into the iron wok, a crashing sound rang out. Figure after figure began to appear, surrounding Yang Kai and Lin Yun’er in all directions, the expressions on their faces filled with terror.

These people were none other than the disciples and Elders that had participated in the Sword Formation. The Everchanging Profound Sword Formation was constructed with their swords as its base and them as its roots. Now that all the swords had been taken away, the Formation naturally broke apart even though the cultivators making up its roots were still around. Therefore, it could no longer conceal their presence.

“H-H-How is that possible?!” On the other side, Hua Xing drew a sharp breath of cold air into his lungs as he stared in that direction in disbelief. The Yin Yang Five Elements Everchanging Profound Sword Formation was destroyed! The indestructible Yin Yang Five Elements Everchanging Profound Sword Formation that saved Wind and Cloud Pavilion from danger on multiple occasions had actually been broken!

Hua Xing felt he was having a nightmare, [This is impossible! That formation was passed down for thousands of years! It only needs five people to deploy; moreover, it gets stronger the more people are linked to it!]

More than a hundred people were linked to the formation this time, an extremely large-scale event. Furthermore, the person leading the Formation was the Great Elder, a man whose cultivation reached the Second-Order Emperor Realm! With such a lineup, even Hua Xing would have died several times over if he were caught inside. How could it be destroyed by two unknown Juniors?! Also, what happened to the Great Elder? Where was he?

Hua Xing swept his gaze around but did not see the Great Elder anywhere among those people and his heart pounded wildly, knowing that something had gone wrong. The Great Elder had been acting as the Formation Core, but he was currently nowhere to be seen. That could only mean one thing, the Great Elder was dead!

[How did he die? Who killed him?] Hua Xing did not understand anything and was clueless about the happenings within the Sword Formation, so it was only natural that he was completely bewildered.

At that moment, he felt his heart clenching all of a sudden as he instinctively sensed that danger was heading his way.

[This is bad!] Only then did he remember that he was in the middle of a battle with someone else. Moreover, the opponent was stronger than him. He would never have made such a foolish mistake under normal circumstances, but what he just witnessed had shocked him to the core, so it was inevitable that he would become slightly distracted as a result.

Unfortunately, that moment of distraction gave Li Jiao an opportunity to attack. A ferocious burst of Emperor Qi pressed down on Hua Xing and exploded on his chest, sending him flying as he coughed out a mouthful of blood.

“Old Dog Hua, how dare you make Palace Master Yang your enemy?! Today, this Li will definitely kill you!”

Upon hearing those words, Hua Xing spat out another mouthful of blood as he roared furiously, “Damn you, Li Jiao!”

The exchange of blows between them just now had been little more than a farce, a show they were putting on for the masses. Although it seemed like a lively battle, they had not been using even ten percent of their true strength. Thus, the full-powered attack had caught Hua Xing completely off guard.

Hua Xing also knew why Li Jiao was acting in this manner. It was clear that Li Jiao was reacting to the situation at hand and choosing the most advantageous action for himself. Even so, Hua Xing couldn’t help the rage that erupted in his heart. How could a hundred years of friendship be overturned just like that?!

Gritting his teeth, Hua Xing roared, “Are you certain you’ll win?! Just wait and see! Nobody will leave this place alive today!” Pausing for a moment, seemingly steeling himself, Hua Xing then shouted to the sky, “Come out, Divine Beast!”
