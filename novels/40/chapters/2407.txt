Yang Kai silently looked at Jiang Zhou Zi, wondering, [How did he conclude that I’m not putting his Immaculate Island in my eyes? Can this guy even listen properly?!]

Hearing their Vice Island Master’s words, the group of Dao Source Realm cultivators in the rear was also filled with indignation, just as if they’d suffered some great humiliation. They quietly pushed their Source Qi and looked at Yang Kai’s group with unveiled hostility, ready to attack at any moment.

Yang Kai remained calm, however, and spoke, “That was not my intention. I’m just saying that since the beast has already escaped, we should work toward a solution. If Island Master Jiang has any suggestion, we’ll be glad to hear it.”

Jiang Zhou Zi laughed out loud and sneered, “This brat sure can talk!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The red-robed woman stepped forward and whispered something in Jiang Zhou Zi’s ear at that moment, and while speaking, she kept glancing in Bing Yun’s direction, a wicked expression on her face.

Seeing this situation, Fan Xin and her Junior and Senior Sisters frowned. Although they couldn’t hear the red-robed woman’s words, they knew it was nothing good!

Their Honoured Master was in the middle of treating her injuries, and she could suffer no interference! So, what were these people thinking?

Fan Xin and her sisters glanced at each other before they discreetly shifted their formation to keep guard in front of Bing Yun.

Jiang Zhou Zi coldly snorted as turned back to Yang Kai and said, “You scared off the gift this Old Master had prepared for the Seeking Passion Sect, which is an unforgivable crime!”

Since he kept mentioning the name ‘Seeking Passion Sect,’ Yang Kai could tell that it must be a Sect with great influence in the Northern Territory. Otherwise, these people from Immaculate Island wouldn’t go to such lengths to prepare a gift for them.

Yang Kai didn’t reply and merely stared at Jiang Zhou Zi, waiting for him to continue.

“However, since you said you’d compensate us, it’s not like we can’t discuss the matter.”

Yang Kai said calmly, “Island Master Jiang, what do you suggest?”

Jiang Zhou Zi coldly snorted before pointing his finger and saying, “Leave that girl behind. The rest of you can scram.”

When they first came here, he was so angry that he didn’t notice Bing Yun at all, but after the red-robed woman’s reminder, he saw that there was an extraordinary beauty among this group of people.

Jiang Zhou Zi had lived for many years, but it was his first time seeing such a pure and flawless woman. Bing Yun was heavily injured and treating her wounds at this moment, but her spotless, otherworldly aura was still enough to shock Jiang Zhou Zi.

He felt that it would be impossible to find another girl like her in this world.

He didn’t want Bing Yun for himself, but rather wanted to give her to the Seeking Passion Sect. Although the Blue Infant Beast was gone, they might still gain the Seeking Passion Sect’s favour if they delivered them this girl.

Cultivators from the Seeking Passion Sect pursued the Dao of Passion, so their Secret Arts were all deeply related to it. The greater the passion, the greater their cultivation. Let alone their Young Sect Master, even ordinary disciples had countless beautiful women by their side.

If they delivered this beautiful girl to the Young Sect Master, he would certainly be overjoyed as she was the perfect person to fall in love with, and as long as the Young Sect Master was happy, their Immaculate Island would be treated well.

“Bold!” When Fan Xin and her sisters saw Jiang Zhou Zi pointing his finger at their Honoured Master and uttering such drivel, they all flew into a rage.

Jiang Zhou Zi’s face darkened as he said coldly, “What did you say? Say it again if you have the courage!”

Fan Xin gritted her teeth and just as she was about to snap back at him, Yang Kai waved his hand and stopped her.

He calmly looked at Jiang Zhou Zi and said with an odd smile, “Island Master Jiang... are you sure you want her to stay behind?”

He felt like laughing at this moment. Bing Yun was a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, but due to her Secret Art, she gave off a pure and innocent feeling, and her appearance was no different from that of a young girl. This Jiang Zhou Zi was really a blind dog who didn’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth! He unexpectedly wanted Bing Yun to stay behind!

He was someone who didn’t know how to write the word ‘death’!

“Except for that girl, the rest of you better scram now. I’ll give you ten breaths of time. If you haven’t disappeared from my sight by then, you can forget about leaving here alive!” Jiang Zhou Zi shouted as he cast a sidelong glance at Yang Kai, releasing overflowing killing intent, looking very intimidating.

“En, good, we’ll leave!” Yang Kai didn’t waste time and waved his hand, ready to bring everyone away.

“Waste!” The red-robed woman shot a disdainful look at Yang Kai. To save his life, he immediately abandoned his companion, the very definition of cowardice! Although she was the one who suggested having Bing Yun stay behind, it didn’t stop her from looking down on Yang Kai’s unsightly behaviour.

The other cultivators from Immaculate Island didn’t say anything, but the contempt in their eyes was evident.

“Alchemist Yang!” Fan Xin stamped her feet in anger as she looked at Yang Kai. She wore a disappointed look and was deeply shocked that he chose to abandon her Honoured Master so easily. Could he not tell that she was in the middle of treating her wounds?

“Don’t worry,” Yang Kai winked at her, hinting that everything was under his control.

Hearing his words, Fan Xin didn’t say anything else, simply glancing at Bing Yun with worry before finally retreating with Yang Kai and the others.

Jiang Zhou Zi didn’t waste time and leapt forward, stretching out his hand toward Bing Yun. It seemed he wanted to subdue her and bring her back to Immaculate Island right away.

When his gaze fell on Bing Yun’s peaceful face, all sorts of feelings welled up in his heart. How could there be such a pure woman in this world? Even he, someone who wasn’t a womanizer, couldn’t help but be moved. He had the impulse to bring her back home and take care of her forever.

He was already imagining the beautiful scene of him and Bing Yun living a happy life together.

In hindsight, such a perfect woman was his to take. It would be a waste to give her to the Seeking Passion Sect’s Young Sect Master! He loathed the fact that they might have to part ways.

Bing Yun, who was healing herself even now, suddenly opened her beautiful eyes at that moment.

*Zi...*

Seeing her beautiful eyes, Jiang Zhou Zi felt as if someone had ruthlessly pounded his heart with a sledgehammer and he couldn’t move his gaze away.

[What a wondrous pair of eyes!] Jiang Zhou Zi could see his dazed expression reflected in her round, moon-like pupils. Her eyes were like a crystal-clear pond of water, capable of bewitching anyone who saw them, branding themselves in the depths of their soul.

Jiang Zhou Zi was now even more bent on taking this girl for himself. He had been cultivating for so long, but it was his first time being so moved after seeing a woman!

“Don’t move, this King doesn’t want to hurt you,” he tried to sound as gentle as possible, afraid that he might frighten this timid girl. At the same time, his hand moved toward her shoulder.

But right at that moment, Bing Yun slightly raised her jade white hand and gently tapped at Jiang Zhou Zi’s palm.

Her movements were extremely gentle and carried an otherworldly aura.

Jiang Zhou Zi was a little absent-minded while it was happening, but in the next instant, his expression changed drastically.

As Bing Yun moved her hand, he sensed the terrifying aura burst from her body.

[This young girl... is a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master!?]

Yang Kai’s group had a varied level of cultivation, with the strongest of them being at the Third-Order Dao Source Realm. As Bing Yun was treating her wounds back then, Jiang Zhou Zi didn’t pay her too much attention and mistakenly believed that her strength would also be around that level at best.

Only now did he realize that her cultivation was something he could never hope to match!

He had no one but himself to blame. How could he do something as stupid as asking this kind of Master to stay behind? Had he known earlier that Bing Yun was so strong, he would never have dared to be this rude!

Even Immaculate Island’s Island Master was only a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master, which meant that in his Sect, no one was this woman’s match.

While still in shock, he tried to retreat at his fastest speed; however, an invisible force kept him in place.

Bing Yun’s movements seemed slow and gentle, but her tapping Jiang Zhou Zi’s palm happened in a flash.

“Senior, mercy!” Jiang Zhou Zi cried out in terror, his face pale.

While screaming, he felt a slight pain in his palm, as if it had been pricked by a needle. Then, a chilling cold spread from there.

He opened his eyes wide as his heart sank.

A pure white ice flower had blossomed at the centre of his palm. The flower was magnificent and looked as if it was carved from jade. It was flawless and formed a beautiful sight that mesmerized any who gazed upon it.

However, Jiang Zhou Zi had no time to appreciate this sight as the ice flower, as soon as it appeared, began radiating frost up his forearm at a speed visible to the naked eye. Soon, his whole arm became numb as the bone-chilling cold seemed capable of freezing even his Soul.

Seeing that the frost was about to spread to his chest, Jiang Zhou Zi bit the tip of his tongue and used his finger as a blade to cut off his arm at the shoulder.

*Puchi...*

Blood spurted out.

As his arm was cut off, the force keeping him in place disappeared. Terrified, Jiang Zhou Zhi hurried to put some distance between himself and Bing Yun.

When he returned to his senses, his forehead was covered in sweat and his face was as white as a sheet of paper. Without wasting time, he took out a healing pill from his Space Ring and threw it into his mouth before turning a panic-stricken gaze towards Bing Yun.

From the strength Bing Yun showed just now, he wouldn’t be able to resist if she decided to kill him!

He could only hope that Bing Yun wasn’t someone fond of killing and that she would let him go after seeing that he had suffered enough.

In the meantime, that group of Dao Source Realm cultivators from Immaculate Island was dumbfounded.

They only saw Jiang Zhou Zi moving toward Bing Yun, who gently raised her hand in response; and then, in the next instant, Jiang Zhou Zi retreated in a panic, cutting off his own arm!
