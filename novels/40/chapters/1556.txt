Chapter 1556, Tender Affection

Although everyone was excited, they also understood that leaving Tong Xuan Realm and entering the Star Field would not be a simple matter.

Ling Tai Xu and Meng Wu Ya had been unsuccessful even after teaming up, so the difficulty could easily be imagined.

But now that Yang Kai had issued such a statement, everyone’s hopes were roused.

“Settle down, settle down!” Ling Tai Xu waved his hand and called for order, “Since Little Yang Kai has made such an announcement, he surely has a solution to this problem, yes?”

Saying so, he looked towards Yang Kai with a smile.

“Grand Master understands well, it truly won’t be a problem to bring all of you to the Star Field. En, in fact, not just everyone here, but also all your clansmen and even all of Nine Heavens Holy Land. It will just take a little time to organize everyone but we can all go at once.”

“All at once?” This time Ling Tai Xu was also shocked.

War Spirit Temple and Shattering Mystical Palace currently housed three or four thousand people from the Central Capital while Nine Heavens Holy Land had more than two thousand disciples.

Adding these two groups together yielded as many as six thousand people. How was Yang Kai going to take away such a massive group with him? The power of the Starry Sky was extremely oppressive, and even if he was an Origin Returning Realm master, Yang Kai couldn’t possibly shelter so many people.

“En, I have my methods, Grand Master need not worry,” Yang Kai grinned, “The key is whether you are willing to go.”

“Of course we’re willing!” Huo Xing Chen called out immediately and eagerly, “When will we be leaving?”

“Haha, Brother Huo doesn’t need to be in such a rush. Although you are the Patriarch of a family, this kind of important matter still needs to be discussed with your clansmen. Perhaps there will be some who don’t wish to leave here. If you are willing to come with me, you’re more than welcome, if not, I won’t force you. En, this goes for the Qiu Family, Yang Family, Dong Family, and everyone else. Sister Qiu, Big Brother, Cousin, you are now all leaders of your various families, so you should discuss this matter carefully with your respective Elders.”

“We know,” Yang Wei and Dong Qing Han nodded.

Qiu Yi Meng also nodded in agreement, her previously dim eyes showing a glowing lustre again after hearing this news.

If she was able to enter the Star Field, she would be able to reach a higher level, and although she didn’t believe she could stand shoulder to shoulder with Yang Kai, narrowing the distance between them should be possible. Perhaps one day, she would be able to touch him...

She saw a faint hope, but that was enough to restore her radiant look.

“Does that mean we won’t be separated from each for so long again?” Dong Su Zhu looked at Yang Kai excitedly.

Yang Kai was her only child, but since he turned thirteen years old, she had barely spent any time with him. It was not so bad at first as, although she couldn’t see Yang Kai, she at least knew he was in High Heaven Pavilion and living well while, during the Inheritance War, Yang Kai was only a hundred kilometres away from her.

But since Yang Kai left Tong Xuan Realm and journeyed to the Star Field, not only had she not been able to see him for thirty years, she wasn’t even able to hear a single bit of news about him.

Had it not been for Yang Ying Feng’s painstaking efforts to soothe her mood these years, Dong Su Zhu would have already collapsed.

Today, learning that she could also go to the Star Field with her son, Dong Su Zhu was incredibly elated.

Yang Kai looked at her and gently nodded. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Dong Su Zhu laughed joyfully as she smiled from the bottom of her heart.

“This matter can’t be delayed, I’m going right now to convince those old fogies.” Huo Xing Chen couldn’t sit still and quickly got up and left, a look on his face saying he wouldn’t allow anyone to dare disagree with him.

“I’ll go too,” Yang Zhao also got up and left.

Qiu Yi Meng followed close behind.

None of them were willing to waste any time.

All of them longed to see a higher level of the Martial Dao and experience the mysteries of the Star Field.

Soon, only Ling Tai Xu and Yang Kai’s parents were left in the hall.

Their family had at last reunited.

There were endless words and endless thoughts to exchange.

After learning that Yang Kai still couldn’t find Su Yan’s whereabouts, Dong Su Zhu sighed and comforted him.

She liked her daughter-in-law Su Yan very much.

“Little brat, you worrying whole-heartedly about Su Yan is fine and all, but have you ever given any thought about how to deal with the ones you’ve left behind here?” Yang Ying Feng suddenly looked at Yang Kai and asked pointedly.

“Little Senior Sister?” Yang Kai chuckled, “I’ve already gone to see her, but there seems to be a little something wrong with her so I’ll have to speak with her carefully when she wakes up.”

“Don’t play dumb!” Yang Ying Feng glared at him, “There’s more than Xia Ning Chang here, there are several others.”

“Since when were there so many?” Yang Kai asked back with a wronged look.

“Hmph, there’s one here in War Spirit Temple and two over at Twin Spirit Pavilion! You think your Father is blind?” Yang Ying Feng snickered, “You may not have said anything to your Father, but he is clearer about this than anyone.”

Yang Kai instantly blushed awkwardly.

Dong Su Zhu simply giggled to the side while quietly raising her thumb up to Yang Kai. Yang Ying Feng had been deeply in love with her his entire life and she was his only wife, a fact she was quite satisfied with; however, when it came to her son, she hoped he would be accompanied by many beauties. The best case would be for him to quickly give her one or two... no, ten grandchildren so that she and his father would not be bored in the future.

Even if Yang Kai wasn’t there to attend to them, they could busy themselves raising their grandchildren.

“Good, good, let’s not interfere in the matters of the young. Yang Kai is not an unreasonable boy anymore, he will obviously treat those little girls appropriately,” Ling Tai Xu interjected.

With his Master speaking, Yang Ying Feng immediately shrank his head before nodding.

All of War Spirit Temple and Shattering Mystical Palace were abuzz with activity as the big families who had come here with Yang Kai held high-level meetings, everyone seemingly discussing something of great importance.

Everyone soon learned that Yang Kai had returned and also that they were being given an opportunity to travel to the Star Field.

No one would be forced, though. Everything was voluntary.

Nine Heavens Holy Land also received a message from Yang Kai and reacted in a similar fashion to War Spirit Temple’s side. In addition, Yang Kai sent a message to Soaring Heaven Sect.

Two days later, Yang Kai returned to Nine Heavens Holy Land.

He went directly to the cultivation room where Xia Ning Chang was in seclusion.

Little Senior Sister was still asleep, however. It seemed like her recent cultivation deviation had exhausted her quite a bit.

Yang Kai came up to her, held her jade white hand, and poured some Saint Qi into her body gently.

After a while, Xia Ning Chang’s long eyelashes fluttered and Yang Kai sat down on the edge of her bed, facing her with a warm smile.

Soon after, Xia Ning Chang opened her beautiful eyes, and when she saw Yang Kai’s face, she instantly fixated on him.

Four eyes suddenly met, just like they had accidentally back in the Nine Yin Mountain Valley all those years ago.

There was warmth as well as a slight hint of panic.

Soon though, Xia Ning Chang pursed her lips and tittered lightly.

“Why are you laughing?” Yang Kai asked while looking at her with a smile.

“Because this dream has lasted so long!” Xia Ning Chang held Yang Kai’s big hand tightly, as if she was unwilling to let go.

Yang Kai grinned, leaning down, and kissed her jewel-like red lips affectionately.

Little Senior Sister instantly found it difficult to breathe.

As their lips overlapped and pressed against one another, her temperature rose and her beautiful eyes became blurred.

“In your dreams, do you do these kinds of things with me?” Yang Kai looked at her meaningfully.

Xia Ning Chang’s pretty face immediately blushed as she shifted her body to bury her head in Yang Kai’s clothes, seemingly afraid to meet eyes with him again.

Yang Kai got the answer he was looking for and laughed happily.

Suddenly, Xia Ning Chang’s tender body trembled and she hurriedly sat up before freezing in place. Her beautiful eyes focused on Yang Kai’s face as surprised and doubt flashed across them.

“Junior Brother, you...” Xia Ning Chang opened her mouth, her brows furrowed cutely, seemingly still somewhat confused.

“I’m back,” Yang Kai said softly.

Little Senior Sister immediately covered her delicate mouth with her hands as her limpid eyes filled with mist.

Tears began sliding down her cheek as her eyes quickly turned red.

She finally realized that everything was real, that she wasn’t dreaming.

The man who she had been thinking about every day for the past several decades was now here, sitting on her bed, looking at her affectionately. Xia Ning Chang’s heart nearly melted from the tender affection she felt at this moment.

She couldn’t believe it!

“I’m really back,” Yang Kai stretched out his hands and embraced her tightly, pressing their bodies together as if he wanted them to become one.

A light whimper came from Xia Ning Chang as she hugged Yang Kai back just as tightly, cries leaking from her lips.

These cries pierced Yang Kai’s heart.

Straightening himself up, Yang Kai forcefully blocked her cries.

Soon, clothing was scattered, and a spring-like atmosphere filled the room.

All lovesickness and longing that had been fermenting over the past few decades all burst forth at this moment, transforming into a pure happiness and passion that made Xia Ning Chang lose herself in bliss.

Love between men and women had always been this way.

After an hour, a completely energized and rejuvenated Yang Kai took big strides out from the cultivation room.

By his side, Xia Ning Chang wore a veil and followed with her head down in embarrassment.

Her exquisite earlobes and slender neck were still a light shade of pink.

Like a withered flower which had just been watered by the spring rain, Xia Ning Chang at this moment had an unimaginably sensuous aura around her which was enough to drive even the most sage-like men mad with fervour.

The pair’s hands were closely linked, just like their hearts.

From nearby, a flash of light quickly approached, seemingly looking to discuss something with Yang Kai, but after seeing this scene, this figure immediately turned around and disappeared in the blink of an eye.

“Master...” Xia Ning Chang whispered, wishing she could find a hole to crawl into and hide herself.

Naturally, she saw that the person who had escaped just now was Meng Wu Ya.

Yang Kai grinned and laughed foolishly, resulting in Xia Ning Chang biting her red lips and stomping her foot in annoyance.

“Forget it, it must not have been important otherwise Treasurer Meng wouldn’t have just left,” Yang Kai comforted, “Right, Little Senior Sister, I have something to ask you.”

“What’s the matter?” Xia Ning Chang looked up at him timidly, met Yang Kai’s gaze, then quickly turned aside shyly.

This shy appearance caused Yang Kai’s blood to boil and he very much wanted to turn around right then and there to return to that secluded room...

Circulating his Saint Qi to suppress these urges with great difficulty, Yang Kai wore a solemn look and asked, “When I helped you smooth the flow of your Saint Qi, I discovered a strange grey Qi in your body; what was it?”

“That thing...” Xia Ning Chang heard this and frowned slightly as she replied, “Actually, I don’t know either.”

“You don’t know?” Yang Kai was surprised.

“En, it followed me all by itself, oh, where did it go?” Xia Ning Chang suddenly found that something was wrong. The mysterious grey Qi that had always existed in her body had disappeared at this moment.
