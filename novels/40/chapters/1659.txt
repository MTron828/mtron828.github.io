Seeing him look so calm, Luo Li nodded slightly, stretched out her hand, poured some tea into a small teacup in front of Yang Kai, and said, “Have a taste of this Queen’s Tranquil as Snow Tea.” As she spoke, a clear and refreshing fragrance wafted towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s expression changed as he picked up the teacup and put it under his nose, sniffing it a few times as a slightly intoxicated look appeared on his face. Immediately after, he lifted the cup of tea up and drank it down in one gulp before chewing a small tea leaf that became stuck in his teeth.

Luo Li was slightly startled and smiled lightly, “Young Master Yang does not seem to have dabbled much in the art of tea ceremonies.”

“En, I haven’t studied it at all,” Yang Kai grinned meaningfully, “I have been too busy running around these years so I haven’t had the time or mind to learn about such things.”

“That is only natural. Young Hero Yang already has such a shocking cultivation at his age, so clearly he is an assiduous individual.”

“Senior is too polite; however, though Junior does not know much about the tea ceremony, he can tell that this Tranquil as Snow has the effect of calming one’s mood. Senior giving me this tea as soon as I arrived... could you be worried about something?” Yang Kai smiled without really smiling.

Luo Li sighed openly, “Why does Young Master Yang ask something he already knows the answer to?”

Yang Kai’s expression became serious as he stated, “Junior will be direct then. Ice Heart Valley’s previous attitude and practice truly angered me greatly, and for a moment I felt that it would be best to wipe it from existence!”

Luo Li’s expression remained unchanged as she continued looking at Yang Kai, waiting for him to continue.

“But reflecting on it now, that was just an impulse driven by anger and completely unnecessary. Moreover, even if I really wanted to do so, Su Yan would not have agreed.”

When Yang Kai mentioned Su Yan, Luo Li’s face flashed with sadness, “Su Yan is a good child. I have taught her several times and her understanding, aptitude, and will are all outstanding. If it were not for matters occurring in such a manner, Su Yan would definitely have grown into the pillar of my Ice Heart Valley and lead it to a glorious future.”

“Unfortunately, that will never come to pass,” Yang Kai smiled coldly.

“This time, it was my Ice Heart Valley’s fault. My, Luo Li’s, fault. Young Master Yang having the heart to forgive our transgressions even after everything that happened is more than this Luo Li can thank you for!” Luo Li stood up and bowed to Yang Kai elegantly.

Yang Kai frowned, but his expression soon softened. After thinking for a moment, he said, “Senior is too serious. Senior is an Origin King while Junior is a mere Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator. Senior need not display such courtesy or respect.”

Luo Li shook her head sternly, “This Queen cannot depend on her status to remain aloof. Besides, although this Queen is somewhat short-sighted, she knows Young Hero’s future must be bright.”

Yang Kai laughed loudly, “Then I’ll take advantage of Senior’s auspicious words.”

After this laugh, Yang Kai said solemnly, “Since Senior is willing to speak openly and honestly, then Junior will reciprocate in kind. From now on, Su Yan and Qing Ya no longer have any relationship with Ice Heart Valley, and in return, I will not take what Ice Heart Valley has done in the past to heart.”

A trace of sadness flashed across Luo Li’s face as she nodded lightly, “Very well, it is my Ice Heart Valley that is not fated to receive these blessings and opportunities, so we will not try to demand them.”

“Senior being able to think so is for the best,” Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction.

Yang Kai was happy that Luo Li did not try to make things difficult here. Although his main purpose in coming here was to take Qing Ya away, he also wanted to meet with this Supreme Elder to draw a clear line between Ice Heart Valley and Su Yan.

After all, Ice Heart Valley had nurtured and taught Su Yan and Qing Ya for more than thirty years, using plenty of effort and resources on them, so although Yang Kai was extremely angry and disappointed with their most recent actions, some things still needed to be made clear.

“Good, since the personal affairs have been concluded, let’s talk about proper business,” Yang Kai’s expression changed as he spoke to Luo Li, a sly merchant’s grin appearing on his face.

Luo Li was stunned for a moment before she asked, “Proper business? What business?”

Despite her sharp instincts, she was unable to keep up with Yang Kai’s constantly changing rhythm.

“Brilliant Flame Sect and Ice Heart Valley have fought over Scarlet Wave Star for thousands of years and share an indelible blood feud. The number of Ice Heart Valley disciples who have died at the hands of Brilliant Flame Sect cultivators must be quite astonishing. Now that Brilliant Flame Sect’s Supreme Elder Chi Huo has been killed by me, hasn’t Senior had any ideas about taking advantage of the situation?” Yang Kai looked at Luo Li with a smile and slowly stated, “For example, cutting weeds and pulling out roots to avoid future troubles.”

Luo Li’s expression changed as she looked at Yang Kai in shock, “Young Hero is apparently a merciless person.”

“Hmph, those who aren’t merciless can never stand firmly,” Yang Kai sneered.

Luo Li’s beautiful eyes flashed, “These words are both learned and cultured, it seems this Queen has looked down on Young Hero.”

“So what are Senior’s intentions?”

“This Queen will speak opening then. This Queen indeed had such intentions; with Chi Huo dead, Brilliant Flame Sect now is leaderless, so now is indeed the best time to settle all the grievances between our two factions, but... this Queen is strong in will but weak in strength.”

Yang Kai raised his brow slightly before gently nodding, “Is Senior referring to her internal and Soul injuries?”

“Young Hero’s eyes are indeed sharp,” Luo Li did not deny it.

The internal injuries were the result of her recent cultivation dissonance, while the damage to her Soul was a result of her choice to abandon Su Yan. The latter made the situation of the former worse, which was the reason why Luo Li had not taken any action.

Otherwise, given all the grievances between the two factions, as early as the day Chi Huo was beheaded, Luo Li would have set out for Brilliant Flame Mountain Range to uproot Brilliant Flame Sect.

“Even so, with Senior’s means, is there no way to take Brilliant Flame Sect?” Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

“Young Hero thinks too highly of me,” Luo Li laughed and shook her head. “If this Queen was at her peak, she would have at least a seventy percent chance of breaking through Brilliant Flame Sect’s Sect Defending Array, but under the current circumstances... it would be quite difficult. Although Brilliant Flame Sect does not have an Origin King to protect it now, it still has hundreds of Origin Realm cultivators, and with the help of their Sect Defending Array, they would have a fair chance of defeating this Queen.”

“It seems I’ve underestimated Brilliant Flame Sect!” Yang Kai stroked his shin, showing a trace of solemnity on his face.

In the end, Brilliant Flame Sect had endured for more than ten thousand years, so it possessed a profound heritage.

“So... if I can allow Senior to restore her strength to its peak, heal her injuries, and offer my cooperation, there would be a good chance of success?” Yang Kai suddenly laughed strangely.

“What?” Luo Li was startled as she furrowed her delicate brow, “You have a method to allow me to restore my peak strength?”

“Indeed!”

“But to heal my injuries, only an extraordinary cure will be useful. I would need a very specific type of Origin King Grade pill!” As she spoke, Luo Li seemed to realize something and her complexion changed dramatically, calling out in alarm, “Is Young Hero also an Origin King Grade Alchemist?”

Yang Kai smiled meaningfully, giving off a profound image as he nodded, “Whether or not that is the case, Senior can see for herself. Good, I need these materials. With Ice Heart Valley’s heritage, it shouldn’t be difficult to take them out...”

Yang Kai quickly listed a number of herbs, all of them Origin King Grade.

Luo Li was in a daze as she took down the list of materials while staring at Yang Kai in disbelief, her tender body trembling slightly as she did.

All the signs pointed to this young man being an Origin King Grade Alchemist. At the very least, an Origin King Grade Alchemist was standing behind him, otherwise, he would not have any need for such herbs.

Luo Li’s heart tumbled like it was being battered by great stormy waves, making it impossible for her to regain her calm for a long time.

Origin King Grade Alchemists were extremely rare even considering the entire Star Field, almost to the point where they could be counted with one’s fingers. Each of these Grandmasters was extremely famous and even peak Third-Order Origin Kings would have to act respectful and polite whenever they met them.

They were the true nobility of the Star Field.

If the young man in front of her was really an Origin King Grade Alchemist, then Ice Heart Valley’s loss this time would be difficult to quantify.

As soon as she thought about this, Luo Li felt the light in front of her eyes dim slightly and she nearly fainted. Fortunately, thanks to her profound cultivation and many years of tempering, she somehow managed to endure this shock and maintain her consciousness.

“These materials shouldn’t be difficult to find, right?” Yang Kai looked at Luo Li.

“En, the materials Young Hero has listed should be in the Valley’s storehouses, I will have someone check immediately!”

“Very good. En, I will also need a seclusions room.”

“This Queen will have one prepared!” Luo Li nodded immediately.

“Alright, in three days, I will come here again, Senior should look forward to it!” Yang Kai stood up.

“Young Master Yang...” Luo Li also stood up and called out.

“Is there something else Senior wishes to say?”

“I would like to ask, why are you trying to destroy Brilliant Flame Sect? Although Wei Feng insulted Su Yan that day, he is also dead. Brilliant Flame Sect has not truly provoked Young Hero, right? Young Hero would also not do this simply to help my Ice Heart Valley.”

“Who said they haven’t provoked me?” Yang Kai snorted, “They’ve provoked me several times. Of course, this is not the main reason. I want to deal with Brilliant Flame Sect because I want their Heavenly Thunder Fire!”

Shock filled Luo Li’s face as she muttered, “Young Hero has a big appetite! The Heavenly Thunder Fire is the foundation of Brilliant Flame Sect. It is also rumoured to have its own sentience and possess incredible strength. The primary reason this Queen has hesitated to invade Brilliant Flame Sect was precisely because of the Heavenly Thunder Fire!”

“En, very good. Since it can cause Senior so much worry, the Heavenly Thunder Fire must be stronger than I anticipated. I want it even more now!” Yang Kai laughed happily.

“You...” Luo Li stared at Yang Kai in amazement, thinking that he was indeed somewhat crazy. Even she was extremely concerned about the Heavenly Thunder Fire, yet this young man showed not the slightest fear of it, it really was a mystery what he had to rely on.

[I hope he is not someone who does not know his own limits.]

Luo Li prayed secretly in her heart.

After her expression fluctuated a few times, Luo Li seemed to make some kind of important decision and spoke once more, “Young Master Yang, if there is a chance, could you have Su Yan come to see this Queen one last time? This Queen has something she wishes to tell her.”

Yang Kai looked at her seriously, but after a short silence, he nodded and said, “Sure, I will have Su Yan come see you tonight. I’ll take my leave first.”

“Many thanks, Young Hero,” Luo Li nodded gently.

Yang Kai descended Pure Ice Peak and met up with Qing Ya, who was waiting at its base. The latter released a sigh of relief when she saw him return safely. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Obviously, Bing Long had received Luo Li’s communication and immediately greeted Yang Kai, “Young Master Yang, please follow me.”

“Please!”

A short while later, Yang Kai was led to a certain isolated loft on the Inner Island while the herbs he had requested before were delivered to him by Bing Long herself.
