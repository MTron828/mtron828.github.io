It took two hours for Qin Zhao Yang to wake up.

After a moment of fogginess, he suddenly remembered what had happened before he fell unconscious. His face changed greatly. He looked around, and he was relieved when he found that Yang Kai was safe and sound.

He was naturally very curious about what the woman in red wanted and what happened while he was knocked out.

He asked Yang Kai, who did not tell the truth since this matter involved Mo Xiao Qi’s origins and identity. Therefore, Yang Kai casually shared that the woman in red had the wrong person...

Qin Zhao Yang was doubtful, but since the two of them were unharmed, he did not dive deeper into it and they continued to drive towards the direction of Azure Sun Temple.

Yang Kai’s ship artifact had been destroyed, and Yang Kai had no time to refine the smaller ship artifact he had gotten from Qin Zhao Yang. Thus, Qin Zhao Yang had to summon his own flight-type artifact and the two of them shared it.

It was a Dao Source Grade Low-Rank wagon-like artifact. Although the space inside is not as big as Yang Kai’s ship, its speed was not much slower.

In the meantime, Yang Kai took the time to refine the artifact he was given.

The woman in red was a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, so she could easily compensate Yang Kai for the broken artifact, which was Dao Source Grade High Rank! And there were many barriers inside. Although it had no attack power, the defence was solid, which made Yang Kai extremely satisfied.

If he wanted to enter the Four Seasons Realm, there would inevitably be a need to use flight-type artifacts, so he was seizing the time to refine his.

No accidents happened along the way. More than ten days later, the two entered the territory of the Azure Sun Temple.

Azure Sun Temple was a famous sect in Southern Territory, and it ranked alongside Orthodoxy Temple and Heavenly Martial Holy Land. It was second only to Star Soul Palace.

Its headquarters were located in a rolling mountain, with tens of thousands of disciples at the foot, and an endless number of masters!

Neither Yang Kai nor Qin Zhao Yang knew why the senior expert appointed Qin Zhao Yang to Azure Sun Temple in exchange for the Four Seasons Realm quota, but since the other party said so, it probably had something to do with Azure Sun Temple.

The two of them stepped into the Azure Sun Mountain Range. Yang Kai was shocked by the spiritual energy contained in the mountain.

The full-bodied world energy rushed towards one’s face, with the fragrance of flowers and plants, which made people feel refreshed. Cultivating in such a good environment, the effect was absolutely amazing.

Yang Kai estimated that there should be a lot of good Earth Veins under the Azure Sun Mountain Range. Even the highest quality Earth Vein should exist, otherwise, there wouldn’t be such rich world energy.

And this was just the periphery. If one went nearer to the centre, what would it be like?

He looked around, secretly shocked by the heritage that Azure Sun Temple sat on, but unexpectedly found that Qin Zhao Yang’s demeanour was a little nervous and cautious.

When Yang Kai thought about it, he understood.

This was the headquarters of the top sect in the Southern Territory. Qin Zhao Yang was a patriarch from a small family in Maplewood City, and he may still be the number one person there, but maybe even the common disciple here made him inferior. Naturally, he was under a lot of psychological pressure, for fear of making a mistake in speech or lack of courtesy or something else.

After all, he came here to beg for help. Naturally, he was very nervous.

In contrast, Yang Kai seemed to be under no pressure, as if he were travelling in the mountains and playing in the water, having a panoramic view of the beautiful scenery along the way.

Suddenly, Yang Kai paused and said, “Brother Qin, someone is here.”

“Ah...” Qin Zhao Yang, who seemed to have his thoughts wandering away, was suddenly startled when he heard the words, but stopped. He stood quietly in place.

In a short while, two streams of light shot over from a distance. They fell not far in front of the two and looked at them coldly.

One of them had a large head, big ears, and a fat body, the fat on his face piled up together. It was almost impossible to see where the eyes were. The other person was a blue-faced man, and it was unknown whether it was his original skin colour or the consequence of cultivating some secret technique. Anyway, he didn’t look like a normal person.

The cultivation of these two was not high: A Second-Order Origin King and a Third-Order Origin King.

But as a mountain patrol disciple, such cultivation was enough to demonstrate the strong heritage of Azure Sun Temple!

“Who are you waiting for? Why are you trespassing into my Azure Sun Temple?” The obese man wasn’t afraid of the cultivation gap. Instead, he looked aloof, interrogating Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang.

Yang Kai’s heart moved, and he thought to himself that a big sect was a big sect. In any other place, if a Dao Source Realm expert stood in front of them, an Origin King Realm cultivator would be trembling. Here, neither of these two guys showed timidity, on the contrary making it seem like his cultivation was lower than theirs.

Qin Zhao Yang was also surprised, but when he thought this was Azure Sun Temple, he was relieved and quickly lowered his posture, cupped his fists, and said, “Greetings, two little brothers. This old master is the master of the Maplewood City Qin family... This is-“

Before he could introduce Yang Kai, the fat man frowned and said, “Maplewood City? I haven’t heard of it.”

“I haven’t heard of it!” The green-faced man also looked impatient and said contemptuously, “Probably some impoverished town.”

“Senior Brother makes sense!” The fat man touched his double chin with a look of approval and then shouted at Qin Zhao Yang, “Country bumpkin, what are you here for? Why did you not stay in that Mapleleaf City??”

“Co... country bumpkin!” Qin Zhao Yang was shocked. This fat man called him this way in front of his own face. No one had ever called him that way.

A trace of anger burst out of his heart, but now people under the eaves had to bow their heads and could only suppress the anger in his heart, displaying a smile. “It’s Maplewood City, not Mapleleaf City!”

“Aren’t they all the same?” said the fat man.

“Well, it’s all the same!” The blue-faced man also nodded.

“You haven’t answered my question yet. What are you doing here at Azure Sun Temple? If you don’t answer quickly, you will be regarded as enemies invading. Don’t blame my fellow brothers for being ruthless!” the fat man said as he didn’t fit his body shape. The attacking posture contained agility and speed.

“Our fellow brothers are strong and will move very quickly when called!” The green-faced man also put on a pose at the right time, meaning that he would have to fight if he didn’t agree with him.

“Wait!” Qin Zhao Yang was taken aback. The two Origin King Realms dared to show their intention to attack. Although there was some overconfidence, this was the headquarters of the Azure Sun Temple. Once the fight began, there was bound to be a master. Here, he and Yang Kai would never escape from this place even if they had the means to reach the sky.

He pondered his words and said, “Two little brothers, don’t be nervous. Brother Yang and I are not enemies of the noble temple.”

The fat man shouted in a low voice, “Senior Brother and I will make our own judgment whether you’re an enemy or not!”

“Yes, it’s not for you to decide!” Although the green-faced man was the Senior Brother, he seemed to be someone who had no opinion. He said whatever the fat Junior Brother said.

Qin Zhao Yang sighed and said helplessly, “The old master came here to beg noble Temple Master Wen.”

Hearing this, the fat junior brother and the green-faced senior brother both froze and were silent for a while.

After a while, the fat junior brother turned his head to look at his Senior Brother and said, “Senior Brother, did I hear them wrongly? The bumpkin just said he asked to see the Temple Master?”

“Senior Brother heard it too.” The blue-faced senior brother nodded.

“Impudent!” The fat junior brother suddenly turned furious and shouted, “You country bumpkins, if you are given three types of dyes, you plan to open a dyeing workshop! How dare you!”

It was too late. The fat junior brother shook his body, his hands clasped, and the power inside his body pushed forward violently. A surging force was suddenly aroused and hit Qin Zhao Yang.

The blue-faced senior brother didn’t react too slowly. He directly took out a long sword artifact, and under the flickering light of the sword, he took on Yang Kai from the front, showing off his moves. To put it plainly, it was full of flaws...

“What are the two little brothers doing?” Qin Zhao Yang was shocked, and Source Qi immediately resolving the fat Junior Brother’s attack.

He didn’t expect that the other party would try to kill him immediately after he stated his intention.

Fortunately, the strength of these two was not high, with his Dao Source Realm cultivation, there was no need to be afraid.

On the other side, Yang Kai stretched out his hand and clamped the fierce long sword of the blue-faced man, in the palm of his hand.

Both of them just cracked the opponent’s killer move and did not fight back.

“Ah!” The fat junior brother exclaimed when he saw this scene. “No, Senior Brother, these two are Dao Source Realm cultivators. Retreat!”

It seemed that until this moment, he had no insight into the fact that Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang’s cultivations were higher than theirs.

“Oh!” The blue-faced senior brother also recovered at this moment. He didn’t know what movement skill he had used, but instead of ignoring his clamped long sword artifact, he slipped back to junior brother’s side.

“The enemy! Senior Brother, run! These two people are not easy to deal with!” The fat junior brother had a serious look on his face and sped off once his attack was complete.

The blue-faced man followed closely behind.

From a distance, the fat Junior Brother’s voice could be heard. “If you have the guts, wait for us to return. When the experts from my temple arrive, I will make sure to remember your face!”

“Well, this is...” Qin Zhao Yang was dumbfounded, standing in place with a bewildered expression.

Yang Kai’s face was turning a shade darker. He thought for a while and switched to holding the long sword in his palm, instead of his fingers.

“Brother Yang, we...” Qin Zhao Yang looked flustered, a little beaten retreat.

“We should just go in. We should see the person he is speaking about soon.” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

“Is that really a good idea?” Qin Zhao Yang was indecisive.

“Once we are wanted by Azure Sun Temple, I’m afraid we will be chased throughout the Southern Territory. It is better to take the initiative to meet and explain to their higher-ups.”

“Brother Yang is right... but, I’m afraid they won’t believe us...” Qin Zhao Yang worriedly said. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Yang Kai laughed and continued, “The two just now... were a bit strange... I doubt that the others from Azure Sun Temple will be like them. If we explain clearly, they should understand.”

“I hope so.” Qin Zhao Yang nodded. After thinking about it, the tension and fear in his heart disappeared and he followed Yang Kai forward.
