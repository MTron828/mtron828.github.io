Yuan Wu was just talking without much thought to it. The main reason was that he was extremely unwilling to nurture the Dragon Blood Flowers. He had done this more than once and would be weakened for a year to two after each session. It was an excruciatingly painful experience.

Who could have thought that Fu Qi would nod in agreement after briefly considering the suggestion?

“Alright then, I will leave them to you, hybrid. If anything happens, you will be held responsible!”

Yuan Wu was stunned for a moment. Then, he was overjoyed, “I won’t let you down, Sir!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Let’s go,” Fu Ling urged impatiently. Hence, the 200 Dragonborn had no choice but to follow behind her and flew in the direction of the Spirit Island where the Dragon Blood Flowers were being cultivated. Many of them looked at Yuan Wu enviously before they left, making him feel very proud of himself.

All of a sudden, his eyes flashed and he glared at Li Jiao with an insidious expression. It so happened that Li Jiao was looking back at that moment. Their gazes met, and the corners of Yuan Wu’s mouth lifted in a smirk.

He had suffered at the hands of Li Jiao back in Half-Dragon City. He had been badly beaten and lost a lot of face. Now, the tables had turned. Li Jiao was about to be taken away to nurture the Dragon Blood Flowers while he had the easy task of watching the 500 ordinary people. Comparing his situation to Li Jiao’s, he felt extremely happy and satisfied.

[So what if your bloodline is stronger? So what if your cultivation is higher? You still need to bleed for Dragon Blood Flowers.]

Besides, that mother-and-daughter pair was finally in his hands again. He was already in the middle of planning how he could torture those two to vent his grievances. He turned his head to glance at the pair, then he turned back to give Li Jiao a deliberately provocative look and snickered. The meaning behind that look could not be more obvious.

Contrary to expectations, Li Jiao was completely unaffected. He simply glanced at Yuan Wu coldly. What’s more; the look in his eyes seemed to contain a trace of ridicule and sympathy.

[What does that mean?] Yuan Wu’s expression immediately went cold. Despite ruminating over it for a while, he still could not understand the meaning behind the look Li Jiao had given him.

Earlier, Li Jiao had stepped up to protect Lu San Niang and her daughter. It was quite clear that they were friendly with each other. [Why is that guy so indifferent towards my provocation?] Yuan Wu frowned deeply, his mind full of doubts.

Li Jiao had no need to worry about Lu San Niang and her daughter because Yang Kai was with them. It would be fine so long as Yuan Wu did not do anything; however, it would end very badly for Yuan Wu if he dared to do something. Li Jiao was certain that Yang Kai would not stand idly by when it came to Lu San Niang and her daughter.

The 200 Dragonborn disappeared into the distance and vanished out of sight. Then, Fu Qi turned around and headed in another direction without saying anything.

Yuan Wu had no time to worry about Li Jiao’s unusual reaction and quickly shouted, “Hurry and keep up! Don’t cause delays for Senior Fu Qi!”

He was used to bullying others by relying on the Dragon Clan’s authority; therefore, his tone was very rude.

Even so, nobody dared to complain about it. The 500 ordinary people hurried after Fu Qi. As Lu San Niang and her daughter passed by, Yuan Wu smiled coldly and immediately leaned over.

Lu San Niang shuddered, her complexion paling slightly. Li Jiao was gone, and she had lost her support; moreover, Yuan Wu could communicate with the Dragon Clan. If he really raised his hand against her or her daughter, she would have no power to fight back; thus, she secretly vowed to herself, [Even if I die, I won’t allow my daughter to fall into Yuan Wu’s hands!]

Her daughter might be the by-product of that Dragon’s impropriety, but Lu Yu Qin was also the baby she carried and gave birth to. The only reason she had been able to continue living all these years was Lu Yu Qin. If not for her daughter, Lu San Niang would have chosen death a long time ago. How could she have survived until today?

She held her daughter in her arms and quietly moved to the side, putting some distance between Yuan Wu and them. Unfortunately, Yuan Wu would never let such a chance slip away. He moved closer to her, clearly trying to take advantage of the situation to feel her up. In response, her expression suddenly became very unnatural. Lowering her head, her pretty face turned deathly pale.

Glancing to the front, Yuan Wu saw that Fu Qi was flying without paying much attention to what happened behind him; therefore, he immediately reached out his hands boldly to grab at Lu San Niang’s firm peaks. He had been lusting after her for a long time now as it was rare to see such a gorgeous beauty in Half-Dragon City nowadays. Furthermore, she had been expelled from Dragon Palace, which meant that she had been intimate with a member of the Dragon Clan, giving Yuan Wu a perverted sense of anticipation. It was only to be expected that he would not let the opportunity pass him by now that he could finally get rid of that itch.

To his surprise though, his hands grabbed at nothing but air and his expression darkened as a result. Turning to look to the side, he discovered that Lu San Niang, who had been right next to him, had slipped to the other side somehow. Moreover, a young man wearing dark blue clothes was standing between him and the mother-and-daughter pair.

He had been completely focused on feeling up Lu San Niang and did not notice when that young man had arrived. When he looked up, he saw the young man giving him a cold glance.

[Did this guy do that on purpose?] Yuan Wu immediately became annoyed. As he was able to communicate with the Dragon Clan, his status within Half-Dragon City was very high and whether they were Human, Monster, or Dragonborn, even the stronger cultivators had to show him some measure of respect.

The previous beating he suffered at the hands of Li Jiao inside the city had enraged him greatly; hence, he could not believe that there were still people out there that would ruin his fun. He glared at the person, and his expression turned frosty, “It’s you!”

He recognized Yang Kai as the young man sitting at the same table as Li Jiao. They clearly had a friendly relationship with each other.

[What’s this? Since that Dragonborn is gone, you’re stepping up to protect those two instead? What can you protect with that pitiful cultivation of yours?] Yuan Wu did not think much of Yang Kai as his own cultivation was Second-Order Emperor Realm, and he had a Second-Order High-Rank Dragon Vein on top of that. Yuan Wu could put up a fight against an ordinary Third-Order Emperor Realm Master and even if he couldn’t win, protecting himself wasn’t an issue.

Yuan Wu had failed to detect Yang Kai’s cultivation before because the latter had not used his Emperor Qi; however, everybody was flying at this moment and the aura fluctuations Yang Kai gave off exposed his strength.

[A First-Order Emperor!? How dare a First-Order Emperor defy me! Moreover, a mere Human!] Yuan Wu was so furious that his nose twitched in rage. [This little brat is looking down on me too much! Is he insane!?]

He darkly sent a Divine Sense transmission to Yang Kai, “Little brat, you sure are bold! How dare you spoil my fun?!”

The corners of Yang Kai’s mouth curled slightly as he replied, “I’ve always been this bold.”

Yuan Wu was taken aback by those words, not having expected Yang Kai to be so unyielding. He initially thought that Yang Kai was simply acting out of loyalty and summoned up the courage to stop him as a result. If that was the case, he simply needed to act fiercely to scare the other party away. To Yuan Wu’s surprise though, his statement not only failed to scare the other party away but actually drew insults to himself. [This is a rebellion!]

Thus, Yuan Wu instantly hated Yang Kai and secretly planned to create a chance for Yang Kai to suffer a fate worse than death. [How dare a mere Human boy in the First-Order Emperor Realm act so presumptuously in front of me? If I wasn’t worried about Fu Qi at the head of the group, I would have beaten this little brat senseless already.]

Smiling coldly, Yuan Wu sneered, “Good. Very good. Don’t forget those words you said. I hope you don’t regret saying them in the future.”

Yang Kai sneered, “Rest assured. I have never regretted anything I did.”

[He is too cocky! Too arrogant!] Yuan Wu was livid. Nobody in the whole of Half-Dragon City had ever dared to speak to him in such a manner before. Not only did somebody break that precedent today, but that person also had an expression of ‘What can you do to me?’ while speaking those words.

Gritting his teeth, he snarled, “Do you think that I won’t dare to do anything to you just because Fu Qi is right there? If that’s the case, you’re gravely mistaken…”

“Go on then, do something,” Yang Kai looked at Yuan Wu sincerely, “If you want to make a move, go ahead, I promise I won’t fight back.”

Yuan Wu was livid beyond words. Unfortunately, he truly did not dare to make a move. Fu Qi was right in front of him and if he did anything without a valid reason, Fu Qi would punish him first. Yuan Wu was not ignorant enough to believe that Fu Qi’s willingness to speak a few words to him meant that he thought any differently about him. The Dragon Clan was prideful and could not be bothered to speak with people like him, it was simply better to have a familiar face to speak with than a stranger. Yuan Wu knew he meant nothing to Fu Qi and could be replaced on a whim.

He understood this point very clearly. Hence, he was so furious that his face flushed red when Yang Kai provoked him in that manner, causing him to issue a vicious threat, “Little brat, I will remember you! Once we reach the island, I will show you what suffering means!”

“Waste!” Yang Kai glanced at Yuan Wu coldly.

Yuan Wu was stunned for a moment, then his face turned red, “What did you say!?”

Yang Kai moved his lips and spat out that word again, slowly, nearly causing Yuan Wu to explode with rage.

At that moment, a figure suddenly intervened between Yang Kai and Yuan Wu. That person cupped his fists at Yuan Wu and smiled ingratiatingly, his Divine Sense surging as he clearly said something to Yuan Wu.

It was a middle-aged man with a monkey-like face and shifty rat-like eyes. At first glance, he did not look like a good thing. Nevertheless, that person’s cultivation was not weak. He was a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master and seemed to be of the Monster Race. The Monster Qi surrounding him was very dense, but it was not very pure.

These kinds of situations were very common in Half-Dragon City. The Dragons had a lustful nature and did not discriminate when it came to their conquests. Therefore, women of the Human Race were not the only ones that the Dragon Clan kidnapped and took back to Dragon Island. There were women from the Monster Race too. If those women gave birth to a child of one of the Dragon Clan members, it would often bring about a situation like this where the child did not have a Dragon Clan bloodline. Unfortunately, their Monster Qi was not pure either and combined with the unique situation in Half-Dragon City where Humans and Monsters intermingled with each other, it was inevitable that some Half-Monsters would be born as a result.

Half-Monsters generally had a hard time cultivating and increasing their cultivation, so to be in the Second-Order Emperor Realm was an amazing achievement in itself.

While communicating with Yuan Wu via Divine Sense transmission, that man secretly winked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai blinked then laughed to himself. This Half-Monster certainly was kinder than he looked.

This man was obviously aware of the conflict between Yang Kai and Yuan Wu and deliberately came to rescue the former. What he didn’t know was that Yang Kai did not need any rescuing whatsoever. Just as Yuan Wu did not think much of Yang Kai, what could Yang Kai possibly think of Yuan Wu?

Even so, this man’s gestures made Yang Kai form a favourable opinion of him and it reminded him that he should not judge a person by their looks.

Just by looking at this Half-Monster’s face, anyone would think that he was an insidious and wretched person; moreover, if one were to meet this person on the streets, they would have stayed as far away from him as possible, lest they were harmed by him in any way.
