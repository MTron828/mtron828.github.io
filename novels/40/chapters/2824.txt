They had only just met though, so Che had no idea what Shaman Niu wanted. He had been collecting information about Yang Kai for the past few days, but he still could not find anything useful. He only knew that he followed Yu into Frost and Snow City one month ago, then stayed in a Tree Cave of the Divine Tree. If he did not come out to sell the healing medicine that he made, perhaps no one would have known he even existed.

Such a person should not be unknown. He should remain in the Frost and Snow Clan and make astonishing achievements.

“Shaman Che…” Across from him, Yang Kai grinned mockingly, “Is this the hospitality of your Frost and Snow Clan?”

Che’s expression remained unchanged, “Since you are already here, you seem to know my plan. This Shaman sincerely invites you to join our Frost and Snow Clan. What do you think about it?”

Yang Kai replied, “Many thanks for your sincerity. If there is nothing else, I’ll be leaving.”

Che frowned, and was obviously unhappy with Yang Kai’s arrogance and impudence. Although they were not from the same Clan, lower-ranking Shaman should show some respect to their superiors, but Che did not feel even the slightest respect from Shaman Niu.

However, this was his fault to begin with, so Che did not feel right criticizing him. It was already unbecoming for Che to arrange for his people to learn from him to steal his skills, but Yang Kai still generously taught them. Everyone in the Frost and Snow Clan was notably grateful for this, so Che would only seem insatiable trying to keep Yang Kai with them now.

“If you have any conditions, just state them. I can agree to any request my Frost and Snow Clan can grant!” Shaman Che was unwilling to give up.

“No price is worth my freedom!” Yang Kai shook his head lightly, and continued in a deep voice, “So far, I have no opinion about your Frost and Snow Clan, but if Shaman Che continues to speak nonsense, my view about the Frost and Snow Clan will change.”

Che sighed heavily and raised his hand lightly, “Shaman Niu, this Shaman did not wish for things to escalate to this point, but since we can’t bargain, then this Shaman will have to detain you here for now. I believe you will change your mind about our Clan if you stay in the palace for a little longer. Just like what you said to Yu, ‘the Barbarian Race is one family’. Isn’t it the same wherever you serve?”

After he spoke, he suddenly shot a flash of lightning out of his palm towards Yang Kai. The lightning shot through the air and abruptly spread into a net, trapping Yang Kai tightly, catching him off guard.

The lightning wrapped around Yang Kai and tied him up like a rice dumpling, causing his hair to all stand on end.

“En?” Che, however, furrowed his brow. Although he did not use his full strength, only focusing on suppressing Yang Kai without hurting him, he was still shocked to see this young Shaman’s face remained unchanged after taking a blow of his Shamanic Spell.

Yang Kai was just a High-Rank Shaman Warrior, and he should have passed out directly after taking this attack. However, Yang Kai’s eyes still looked crystal clear, not showing the slightest signs of fainting.

“Shaman Che…” Just then, Yang Kai voiced out leisurely, “Not that I underestimate you, but If I want to leave… I’m afraid that you can’t stop me!”

As soon as Yang Kai spoke those words, the lightning net shrouding him was suddenly shattered by a surging force.

Che was taken aback and his face changed as he called out in surprise, “Shaman Master!”

He was finally able to sense Yang Kai’s realm after the latter made a move. But, how did this boy become a Shaman Master?

When he saw Yang Kai a few days ago, it was clear that he was just a High-Rank Shaman Warrior, but he actually only spent a few days breaking through the shackles of a Great Realm. Although there was no significant difference for Shaman Che between a newly promoted Shaman Master and a High-Rank Shaman Warrior, it was still a watershed point which countless Shamans became stuck at, past which they were unable to advance for the rest of their life. Connecting the information reported by Yu before, Che’s eyes instantly lit up.

[I truly found a treasure!]

This was not a simple Shaman who happened to be a Herbalist. The strength of this Shaman Niu had been improving terrifyingly fast. He was just a Low-Rank Shaman Warrior one month ago, then he reached the High-Rank Shaman Warrior just a few days ago; but now after meeting again, he was already a Shaman Master.

Such rapid promotion obviously showed that this Shaman Niu received the favour and blessings of the Barbarian Gods. If he was given a little more time, achieving the rank of Shaman Grandmaster, Shaman King, or even Shaman Saint would not be a problem to him.

The Frost and Snow Clan lacked the leadership and protection of a Shaman Saint, and only had a few Shaman Kings. Therefore, there was still a gap between them and the top Clans; however, if there was a Shaman Saint born in the Frost and Snow Clan, the status of the whole Clan would be greatly improved.

No matter what, Che could not let Shaman Niu leave today and had to keep him here. Even if he would be despised or hated later, he still had to make Shaman Niu a member of the Frost and Snow Clan no matter the cost. When Shaman Niu reached the Shaman Saint realm, the Frost and Snow Clan would shake the world.

After a few quick thoughts, Che made up his mind. His aura surged as lightning arcs flashed across his skin, “Shaman Niu, this Shaman likes you more and more. Stay and become a member of our Frost and Snow Clan.” He smiled lightly.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, “I was born in the South Barbarian Clan, and I will die in the South Barbarian Clan. Whether I stay or go depends on if you have the ability to make me stay.”

Che wanted to say something more, but his face suddenly changed as he raised his hand to cast a shield in front of him. As a Shaman Grandmaster, he had mastered the use of this simple Shamanic Spell after years of practice. The power that he unleashed with the wave of his hand was just right, no more and no less, without the slightest excess or waste.

Furthermore, such Shield Spell was not one that a newly promoted Shaman Master could break through.

Che was full of confidence, but in the next moment, his face changed abruptly.

Because a clear cracking sound reached his ears, and the Shield Spell that he had just formed was suddenly shattered. Following that, a rather modest-looking fist rapidly enlarged in front of his vision.

His Shield Spell was broken!

It was hard for Che to imagine what kind of violent power could be contained in that small, weak body that gave it the kind of brutal force not inferior to the most powerful Warriors blessed with the Bloodlust Spell in the Clan. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

*Hong… *

Yang Kai punched Che in the face, and instantly flattened his nose. Blood spurted everywhere, while Che was rebounded by the impact after a bang.

However, Yang Kai did not have the slightest joy of success. Instead, he raised his brow and showed a surprised look.

He saw that the Che, who was sent out flying, burst apart as he landed on the ground, Spiritual Energy pouring out as he transformed into a mist.

At the same time, a roar of thunder came from behind, as if a powerful force was advancing towards him, attempting to engulf him.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and found that Che had somehow reappeared behind his back. He was floating in the air with an object that resembled an animal bone in his hand. It was unknown what kind of beast the animal bone belonged to, but it shone with purple radiance as lightning flickered about it.

Che lifted the animal bone and slammed it towards Yang Kai, bringing down a flash of lightning bolts as he struck, making for an awe-inspiring sight.

Kicking the ground, Yang Kai immediately flickered away from his original position right before the lightning bolts struck on the ground and opened a number of huge pits.

Che raised his brow as he was secretly amazed by Yang Kai’s reaction speed. Although they had just begun the fight, he could see that this Shaman Niu was not to be taken lightly. It had not been long since he broke through to the Shaman Master Realm and so far he had mainly relied on the robust explosive power of his physique, but such power was still incomparable to the strength of a typical Shaman Master.

Unfortunately, Che was a Shaman Grandmaster! He was a Great Realm higher than Yang Kai.

As Che raised his hand, a lightning python flew out from his animal bone club, swaying its head and tail. The python snapped its jaws seemingly in the middle of nowhere just when Yang Kai’s figure suddenly appeared there.

Che seemed to have the ability to foresee the future, and predicted Yang Kai’s landing position, succeeding in catching him off guard.

“Just give up. You can’t compete with me with your ability. The Frost and Snow Clan is looking forward to your addition!” Che, who stood high above, remarked sincerely.

Yang Kai chuckled and stretched out his hand, summoning the Myriads Sword out of thin air. He lifted the sword up and swung it wildly, sending out a long sword light flying obliquely.

The extraordinarily sharp sword light cut through the body of the lightning python, splitting it into two before it flew past Shaman Che and smashed into pieces on a palace far away.

The corner of Che’s mouth constricted slightly as he stared fixedly at the Myriads Sword in Yang Kai’s hand.

Blue South Village was located in a remote place and there were no Masters in it, so there were no decent weapons there and the villagers just battled with stone spears and stone axes. However, the Frost and Snow Clan was different. All the powerful Warriors in the Clan had their own weapons, all of which were made of refined metal. Some powerful Warriors even wielded Shaman Artifacts that were granted to them by Shaman Grandmasters.

The animal bone in Che’s hand was also a Shaman Artifact.

He was not a man without vision and experience, but he was still greatly stimulated when he saw the Myriads Sword.

The sword was not just a Shaman Artifact, but was also a very High Grade Shaman Artifact. Che had only seen such a High-Grade Shaman Artifact once, in the hands of a Shaman King of the Frost and Snow Clan.

How could a Shaman Master possess such a powerful Shaman Artifact? Moreover, he could wield it at will with his meagre strength. Even he, a Shaman Grandmaster, would not be able to control such a Shaman Artifact so freely.

What Che saw in front of him was beyond his capability to fathom, much less understand.

Yang Kai pointed his sword at Shaman Che, and he smiled with his black hair flying in the wind, “Shaman Che, I’ll say it again. If I want to leave, you can’t stop me. If you continue to block my path, I won’t hold back anymore.”

Che could not help feeling intimidated by his assertive tone, but he clenched his teeth and replied in a deep voice, “The Frost and Snow Clan needs you, please stay!”

He stomped his foot, and a Thunder Domain spread wildly, revolving around him, covering an area of a thousand meters in an instant. Dense bolts of lightning filled this region, as if the apocalypse had come.

“A Domain!” Yang Kai grinned.

This Thunder Domain was somewhat similar to the Domain mastered by Origin Kings, but it was still notably different. The course of tens of thousands of years had resulted in many changes in the Martial Dao.

Che’s Thunder Domain was stronger than any Domain of an Origin King that Yang Kai had ever seen. Perhaps, even an ordinary Dao Source Realm cultivator would be troubled if they were trapped inside of this lightning sea.

Che was obviously going all out now, and with his hairs and beard billowing crazily, he bellowed, “All within my Thunder Prison fall under my command! Shaman Niu, surrender yourself. You know that I don’t want to hurt you.”

Yang Kai just snickered disdainfully, however, and replied once more, “That depends on if you have the ability.”

Che sighed and shook his head, “Looks like you must experience the power of this Shaman in order to change your view of my Frost and Snow Clan.”

Raising his hand, he shouted, “Bind!”
