Sword Qi flashed as the power of the Sword Formation burst forth. The dazzling light seemed to be able to penetrate through space itself and completely covered a large area around the city gate.

Du Xian, who bore the brunt of the attack, could not dodge as an immense and tumultuous wave of energy enveloped him.

In an instant, Du Xian was torn apart.

“Hahaha, overconfident!” The lead disciple of the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect thought Du Xian had a trump card when he suddenly attacked so aggressively, but it turned out that it was just the howls of a toothless old wolf. With just a round of attacks from the Sword Formation, the enemy was ripped into pieces, drawing laughter from this man.

Just when he started cackling though, he instinctively sensed that something was wrong. His expression changed as his eyes widened when he saw the torn apart Du Xian, as if he had witnessed something unbelievable, “A Puppet!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

This bold, unhesitant, dauntless Du Xian who rushed towards them like he was ready to die, was actually not a living person but a puppet!

The puppet was so delicately crafted it was almost an exact replica of a real person, and in the midst of a fast-paced fight, it had been impossible to tell it apart from the original.

“Explode!” A low voice that sounded like a call from the underworld resounded in everyone’s ears.

The smashed Du Xian puppet suddenly radiated extremely bright scorching rays.

The extremely dangerous aura spread like a tsunami.

The Flowing Shadow Sword Sect disciple’s complexion changed drastically as he roared, “Run!”

As he spoke, he twisted the sharp sword in his hand, condensing a layer of solid Sword Intent to protect his body. He then stomped his foot and retreated backwards.

*Hong…*

There was an explosion and a scorching white ball blew up outside the city gates, covering a full thousand-metre radius, sending out a violent gust of wind that swept across the city.

There was a muffled snort, but it abruptly stopped. All life auras inside the radius of the blast were extinguished one after another, symbolizing the fall of the cultivators, causing the nearby onlookers to look on in fright.

After some time, the dust settled.

At the gates of Flowing Shadow City, a large pit several tens of meters deep and a thousand meters wide appeared. Surrounding the pit was a chaotic mess. A large section of the city wall was collapsed, while on the ground, there were scorched dead bodies and broken pieces of limbs.

*Kacha…*

The python puppet that had been coiled tightly around Du Xian and Ye Jing Han to protect them raised its head slightly, its scarlet tongue flicking threateningly while on its curled up abdomen stood Ye Jing Han and Du Xian, unscathed.

On the messy ground, a figure struggled to get up. It was the lead disciple of the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect. He was the strongest among the many disciples and he was the fastest to sense the approaching danger, so although he suffered some injuries from the self-destruction of the puppet, he managed to save his life in the end.

Just as he was standing up though, the light in front of him dimmed, as if covered by something in front of him.

Looking up, it was Du Xian.

When their eyes met, the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect disciple glared at Du Xian and angrily snarled, “You cheated!”

As he swung his sword at Du Xian, unbearable pain filled his body and his face became pale from the turbid flow of his Source Qi.

The self-destruction of Du Xian’s puppet was extremely powerful, almost equal to the self-destruction of a peak Dao Source Realm cultivator. The Flowing Shadow Sword Sect disciples who were standing close by were annihilated by this explosion, while their leader barely managed to preserve his life while suffering severe injuries.

Du Xian’s eyes flashed red as he gritted his teeth, “Compared to what the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect did to my Thousand Leaves Sect, this is nothing! We’re just collecting a little interest before getting our revenge!”

Du Xian couldn’t reconcile with the ones who exterminated his Sect. No matter whether the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect was instigated by someone else or not, they were all murderers, so Du Xian would never show mercy.

Finished with what he had to say, Du Xian lifted his palm to strike the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect disciple’s head in an attempt to finish him off quickly.

“Impudent Junior! This is Flowing Shadow City! How dare you commit murder here!”

An angry roar sounded as the figure of an old man suddenly appeared in the sky and grabbed towards Du Xian.

A burst of Emperor Pressure permeated his surroundings, causing Du Xian to freeze in place, unable to move no matter how hard he tried.

“An Emperor!” Du Xian’s face changed, knowing that the commotion they caused just now had forced a real Master to appear, but this person did not seem to be the Sect Master of Flowing Shadow Sword Sect, so his intentions for showing up and his connection with the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect was unclear.

“How can you be so bloodthirsty at such a young age? What will happen when you grow up? This Old Master will teach you a lesson to cleanse your murderous evil!”

The old man seemed to be making a point of explaining his actions as his big hand grabbed towards Du Xian’s head.

From the surroundings, several other figures flickered and rushed towards Ye Jing Han who was standing nearby.

The Thousand Leaves Sect was just a small, insignificant Sect that no one paid attention to before. It was only because of the uproar caused by the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect that anyone even knew its name.

The Dao of Puppetry was considered an auxiliary profession, so even if it was useful, it did not attract much attention.

But today, after seeing the Puppet Arts used by Du Xian and Ye Jing Han, these hidden Emperor Realm Masters dared not underestimate them anymore. Two Thousand Leaves Sect remnants relying only on a few puppets had actually slaughtered a dozen Flowing Shadow Sword Sect disciples inside Flowing Shadow City. If they could obtain such a precious ability, it would definitely enhance the power of their own Sect.

So in an instant, Ye Jing Han and Du Xian became a delicious meal many people were determined to snatch in order to unearth the secrets in refining puppets.

“Who does this old thing think he is to act so brazenly?”

There was a cold snort, and a sharp burst of Emperor Qi suddenly shot towards the old man, carrying momentum like a Flood Dragon emerging from the sea.

The old man’s heart clenched as he instinctively sensed danger and had no choice but to release Du Xian. He quickly pushed seventy to eighty percent of his strength to meet this incoming attack.

*Hong…*

With a muffled sound, the old man staggered and fell back a few steps, his face going pale as his vitality tumbled, somehow managing to not cough up blood. He was secretly shocked as he stared in the direction of the source of the attack and shouted in a low voice, “Who is Your Excellency?”

Yang Kai sneered and did not answer, instead just sending out a volley of palms towards the space around Ye Jing Han.

As these strikes struck, the several sneaky figures creeping towards Ye Jing Han immediately revealed themselves, ugly looks on their faces.

Without the suppression from the old man, the Source Qi in Du Xian boiled again as he palmed the barely living Flowing Shadow Sword Sect disciple into a pulp, a sense of release filling him as he roared to the sky.

Yang Kai swept his gaze across each of the Emperor Realm Masters who acted just now and asked, “Which one of you is the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect’s Sect Master?”

There was silence, and no one answered.

Ye Jing Han walked over and whispered, “That person is not here.”

When the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect invaded Thousand Leaves Sect that day, Ye Jing Han had also seen Li Qing Yun from afar, so she would recognize him if he had come.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, “Is he a coward?”

He was also a little curious now. Even after so many disciples of the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect had been slaughtered, why had the Sect Master not shown up yet? The situation was a little different from what he imagined, and he could not help feeling a little irritable.

“Boy, who are you?” The old man demanded again. He suffered some injuries from Yang Kai’s attack and lost his temper when Yang Kai ignored him.

Yang Kai was already disgruntled and shot him a cold glare, “You should have stayed in your bed old man, lest you injured yourself from running around like this.”

“Impudence!” The old man was enraged. After all, he was a Sect Master and it was simply unbearable for him to be humiliated by an unknown young man. If not for Yang Kai’s strength, he would have taught him a lesson to respect his elders already, letting him know the older ginger was spicier.

“Whose disciple are you? How can you be so arrogant? Didn’t your Master teach you how to show proper respect?” A middle-aged strong man frowned, apparently disapproving of Yang Kai’s defiant attitude.

Yang Kai grinned and taunted, “Do you want to teach me how to show proper respect?”

The middle-aged strong man grunted, “Young man, it’s not a good thing to be too arrogant. You must know that there are always mountains beyond mountains!”

Yang Kai brandished the Myriads Sword at him and snorted, “Come and fight if you are unhappy, let this Young Master see how high your mountain is.”

The middle-aged strong man gritted his teeth, “Madman.”

The other Emperor Realm Masters also shook their heads, thinking that this young man was just like a mad dog that would pounce on anyone who he didn’t find pleasing to the eye. What they didn’t know was that Yang Kai’s intentions here were to raise as much trouble as possible. Yang Kai was even worried that he would not be able to stir up a big enough commotion, but now that someone had been baited, he had no plans to stop.

However, the Sect Master he wanted to see had still not appeared, which made Yang Kai feel rather dispirited. He snickered deeply as he put away the Myriads Sword and declared, “It seems like you’re all talk and no action. If that’s the case, scram out of my sight. Don’t waste this Young Master’s time.”

Yang Kai then signaled Ye Jing Han and Du Xian, and with a sweep of his Divine Sense, his eyes locked on the direction of the City Lord’s Mansion, shouting in a loud voice, “Since Sect Master Li refuses to come out to meet me, this Young Master will have to visit him instead.”

Saying so, he straightened his back and led Ye Jing Han and Du Xian towards the City Lord’s Mansion.

Many Emperor Realm Masters glanced at each other, all of them aware of Yang Kai’s intentions, but only feeling more puzzled as a result. They were wondering how these two Thousand Leaves Sect survivors found such a powerful Emperor Realm Master to back them and why they were now trying to enter the dragon’s nest alone. It seemed that the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect was in big trouble this time, and they wondered if the auction could still be held on schedule.

After seeing the Puppet Arts used by Du Xian and Ye Jing Han, these Emperor Realm Masters were extremely interested in the Heaven Grade Puppets that were going to be sold and now felt that it would be worthwhile to buy one or two.

It was not easy for one to break through to the Emperor Realm, so if one could purchase a ready-made Emperor Realm puppet for some Source Crystals, it would be worth it.

For a while, the minds of these Masters were occupied by thoughts of their personal gains and losses and worries about the auction being derailed by Yang Kai.

But then again, it was none of their business, and they had no intention of intervening; the most they would do was watch from the side idly.

In front of the City Lord’s Mansion, a group of Flowing Shadow Sword Sect disciples stood trembling. Blood had long drained from their faces as they knew that they would soon be facing a terrible enemy.

A dozen or so of their fellow brothers had died in the battle in front of the city gates, and when they thought that their Sect Master would come out to teach these two Thousand Leaves Sect survivors a lesson, all they received instead was silence.

These disciples watched the group led by Yang Kai heading towards them step by step in fear, cold sweat oozing from their palms.

The breeze that brushed past them seemed to contain a thick murderous intent that sent chills down their spines.
