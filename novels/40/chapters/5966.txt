Chapter 5965: See You Soon

A horrifying power was felt surging inside the pit. The howls of wind were like its growls as it kept crashing into the Profound Source Gate.

The Source piece, which had been suppressed and sealed here for a long time, must have realised that something was off, so it was trying to resist; nevertheless, its efforts were futile. If it was the complete Source, the gate wouldn’t have been a threat to it, but it was only a small piece.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The Profound Source Gate’s suppressive power spread. At the same time, a powerful drawing force was felt coming from behind the gate.

After the Source piece was lured out, it lost the power to resist and disappeared into the gap.

The gate closed once again, after which Yang Kai kept it inside his Knowledge Sea.

This time, it didn’t take him much effort to suppress and seal Mo’s Source piece, but he knew it was all thanks to Mu.

Just by looking at the skeletons in the valley, he knew that the woman must have waited here for countless years and killed all the ancient beasts that coveted Black Ink Strength.

If not for Mu’s efforts, Yang Kai would’ve been attacked by ancient beasts corrupted by Black Ink Strength the moment he arrived in this World, making his situation quite perilous.

As Mu watched the Source getting sealed, she finally appeared relieved.

She got to her feet slowly. As Yang Kai looked at her in puzzlement, she extended her hand and pressed it against the man’s chest.

After their eyes met, Mu said, “I’ve completed my task, so I’ll leave the rest to you, Junior. The Human Race’s future hinges on you, so you must do your best to not fail this mission.”

As she spoke, her figure faded rapidly. It was as though she was about to disappear from this World. As that happened, Yang Kai could feel a warm stream entering his body through the woman’s palm.

“Senior…” With a conflicted expression, Yang Kai had no idea what to say.

“This is the price I have to pay for sending you away,” Mu replied with a smile.

Gradually, her figure was gone. As her power engulfed Yang Kai, he shot into the sky and turned into a ray of light.

A crack appeared in the sky just then. The ray of light passed through it and disappeared.

The familiar drawing force appeared again and led Yang Kai to the next world.

He pressed his hand against his chest as his emotions undulated in his heart.

Unlike the Primordial World, the second World was one where only ancient beasts existed. He didn’t do much as he only summoned the Profound Source Gate and sealed Mo’s Source piece.

Mu had cleared all the danger and obstacles for him.

It was the result of countless years of perseverance.

The entire time, Yang Kai had only briefly talked to Mu.

There was no doubt she was a kind-hearted person. She devised this plan millions of years ago and let her shadows stay in different Universe Worlds to carry it out. She had been on her own all this time, waiting for a future that might not even come.

In the end, she didn’t even make any demands or requests, she simply told Yang Kai to do his best and try not to fail.

Even so, he didn’t give her a definitive reply.

He couldn’t help but blame himself. Mu had been doing all this selflessly, and she didn’t need anyone to thank her; nevertheless, Yang Kai could give her hope.

While he was lost in his thoughts, the aura of the third World came right at his face.

As usual, he followed the faint guidance and successfully found Mu, who had been waiting in a desolate place for countless years.

Before Mu could say anything, Yang Kai muttered, “Senior, all the darkness will be dispelled by the light one day. The Human Race will have a bright future. All your contributions and efforts over the aeons will be worth it!”

Mu stared fixedly at him with her mouth slightly open.

With a confident expression, Yang Kai flashed a smile at her.

Mu put on a smile as well. In just a short time, she understood everything and nodded, “Good.”

She turned around and pointed in a particular direction, “Mo’s Source piece is over there. Go ahead.”

“Yes,” Yang Kai cupped his fist and strode towards the place.

He soon sealed the Source piece and returned.

Mu walked up to him and pressed her hand against his chest before her figure faded.

Yang Kai kept all the sorrow to himself and put on a bright smile, “I’ll see you soon, Senior.”

At the last moment, Mu flashed a smile at him, “See you soon!”

The next instant, Yang Kai shot into the sky.

As he moved around different Universe Worlds, he made use of the Profound Source Gate’s power and sealed the pieces of Mo’s Source.

Every time Yang Kai arrived in a new World, he would immediately say the same thing to Mu, who would give him the same response.

As they met and parted ways repeatedly, it was like a never-ending cycle.

In general, things went smoothly. In most of the worlds, Mu had cleared all the obstacles for him, so he just had to find her shadow and summon the Profound Source Gate to seal Mo’s Source piece.

In truth, in the Primordial World, if not for the fact that Mu had to keep Little Eleventh by her side, she could’ve taken control of the Profound Source Gate as well.

However, due to Little Eleventh, Mu in the Primordial World couldn’t go near the Profound Source Gate; after all, Mo’s Source piece had been suppressed behind the gate. An accident might happen if Little Eleventh approached the gate.

Mo’s Source gave birth to the Black Ink Cult; as such, Mu had to establish the Light Spirit Religion to oppose it.

In that independent World, there wasn’t much help that Mu could provide in terms of aid. Moreover, the Black Ink Cult had developed rapidly; as such, it took Yang Kai quite some effort before he settled everything in the Primordial World.

Nevertheless, things wouldn’t always go smoothly.

When Yang Kai entered the 60th Universe World, he realised that something was off. The entire world was filled with Black Ink Strength. All the living creatures in this World had been corrupted by Black Ink Strength and turned into Black Ink Disciples.

When Yang Kai followed the guidance and found Mu, she was covered in blood while running for her life.

This couldn’t be helped, as everyone in that World was hunting her down.

Yang Kai had no idea how long the situation had persisted, but when he found her, she was in a terrible state.

After saving Mu from the Black Ink Disciples, Yang Kai found a quiet place and stopped in his tracks.

He asked, “What’s going on, Senior?”

Mu explained, “Something went wrong with the sealing location. Too much of Mo’s Source Strength leaked out and it has affected far too many beings. They shattered the seal and let Mo’s Source piece break free.”

Upon hearing her explanation, Yang Kai finally realised why this World was filled with Black Ink Strength. Mo’s Source piece had broken free from its shackles.

The darkness in the Humans of this World could no longer be hidden in front of Black Ink Strength. Everyone in this World had been affected and turned into Black Ink Disciples.

“Do you know where the Source piece is, Senior?” Yang Kai asked.

Realising his intention, Mu shook her head, “There’s no point looking for it. Since you’ve started sealing Mo’s Source piece, speed is essential. Give up on this World and head to the next one!”

Saying so, she tried to get to her feet, but due to her injuries, she was unable to do so.

Yang Kai hurriedly squatted in front of her.

Mu pressed her hand against his chest. They could hear the sounds of footsteps as many living creatures were rapidly approaching them.

“Remember, if there’s a similar situation in any World, abandon it at once. There’s no point trying to achieve your goal every time because you won’t be able to seal all the pieces of its Source regardless.”

Yang Kai nodded in response.

Back in the Primordial World, Mu’s first shadow told him that she had divided Mo’s Source into 3,000 pieces. Every time Yang Kai sealed a piece of its Source, Mo would be alerted. When it reached a certain point, Mo would awaken and retrieve all the remaining Source pieces.

Therefore, Yang Kai couldn’t seal all 3,000 pieces. In that case, it would be wiser to give up on this World and head to the next one where it would be easier to seal the Source piece.

“I understand.” Yang Kai nodded.

“Also, my shadows might not be alive in all the Universe Worlds. You might enter a World where I’m not around, but you don’t have to worry. The previous shadows had left behind enough power for you, so you can leave for the next World anytime you want.”

Yang Kai nodded again.

The footsteps were getting closer as they felt flaring energy fluctuations. The Black Ink Disciples around them were running out of patience as they were ready to make a move.

Mu’s figure vanished into thin air, after which Yang Kai shot into the sky, leaving the Black Ink Disciples growling on the ground.

He set off on his journey and traversed the Space-Time River again. He repeatedly entered different Worlds and sealed the pieces of the Source.

[100, 200, 300…] Yang Kai kept count in his mind. As the number of the pieces he sealed increased, he could feel the situation worsening.

Every time he sealed a piece of Mo’s Source, Mo would be disturbed. When it finally realised the severity of the matter, it would awaken.

Yang Kai had no idea what the limit was, but he knew he was getting closer to it.

What made him feel helpless was that there were now more and more Worlds with difficult situations.

The first time he came across a problem was when he reached the 60th World. The second time was after he sealed the 100th piece, and the third time was around the 130th piece. The intervals were getting shorter.

The Universe Worlds within Mu’s Space-Time River all had different World Principles; therefore, the strengths of the living creatures in these Worlds varied greatly. However, her guidance seemed to be leading Yang Kai from the weakest to the strongest ones.

Initially, the limit of the Martial Dao in the Universe Worlds was only the Immortal Ascension Boundary, but gradually, it became the Transcendent Realm, then the Saint Realm, the Saint King Realm, the Dao Source Realm, and eventually the Emperor Realm.

As the living creatures in those Worlds became stronger, it became more difficult for Yang Kai to achieve his goal; after all, Mu’s shadow was on her own in most Worlds. The powerful creatures were naturally attracted to Mo’s Source Strength, and once too many of them gathered together, even Mu’s shadow couldn’t stop them.

Yang Kai followed Mu’s advice. Every time he came across a fallen World, he would give up on it at once.

Nevertheless, he would always look for Mu and integrate her last bit of power into his body.

He wasn’t after Mu’s power; he just wanted to bring as much of her away as possible.
