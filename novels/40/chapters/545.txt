Facing Qiu Yi Meng’s approaching dagger, Yang Kai maintained his calm grin, not showing the slightest tension as he stared at the brilliantly glowing blade, he didn’t even condense his True Qi, as if he really had no intention of resisting.

Qiu Yi Meng’s beautiful face was filled with determination and the speed at which she struck only accelerated.

But in the next instant, Yang Kai’s complexion rapidly changed, his eyes filling with shock as he grabbed towards Qiu Yi Meng’s hand as fast as he could.

*Pu...*

A dull thud resounded and blood splashed out.

Screams rang out and the masters behind the two entangled figures shot forward.

The eyes of Chen Xuan and the other Fallen Leaves Hall masters all wore fanatical expressions as they stared at the dumbstruck Yang Kai, grinning fiercely as they approached.

Ying Jiu, Tang Yu Xian, and Old Demon also pushed their True Qi rapidly and crossed over the heads of Yang Kai and Qiu Yi Meng to intercept Chen Xuan and the Qiu Family masters.

The battle had instantly erupted; those below the Immortal Ascension Boundary were unable to interfere. Even those younger generation leaders who had already broken through the Immortal Ascension Boundary were too afraid to approach and could only use their Martial Skills and artifacts to strike from a distance.

Brilliant flashes of light blossomed and waves of True Qi rampaged about.

Amidst the chaos, Luo Xiao Man stumbled over to Yang Kai and Qiu Yi Meng but after seeing the situation, she couldn’t help trembling violently as she covered her mouth to stifle her screams.

Qiu Yi Meng had fallen limply into Yang Kai’s arms, her face pale and bloodless as she silently smiled towards the man embracing her. Inserted into her lower abdomen was the very same dagger artifact she had taken out just now.

Yang Kai on the other hand was completely unscathed.

“What the hell are you doing?” Yang Kai angered snapped.

“I couldn’t do anything...” Qiu Yi Meng smiled faintly, “I could only think of this way and let myself escape temporarily.”

Just now, Qiu Yi Meng stopped her attack halfway through and instead turned the dagger on herself. Yang Kai saw this and immediately tried to stop her.

However, Qiu Yi Meng’s previous expression was too convincing and Yang Kai was also deceived by her for a moment, thinking that she really was going to attack him.

When he realized he had been tricked, it was already too late to stop her.

Blood flowed from Qiu Yi Meng’s lower abdomen and soon her clothes were stained dark red, giving her a strange ephemeral beauty.

“Don’t talk.” Yang Kai wrinkled his brow but didn’t panic, Qiu Yi Meng’s injury wasn’t in a fatal position nor did the dagger penetrate too deep, with the help of the Myriad Drug Milk, in only a day or two she would fully recover without even a scar. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“I have something I want to ask you.” Qiu Yi Meng panted for breath as she stubbornly stared at Yang Kai.

“If you have something to say, just spit it out.” Yang Kai coldly snorted, he was quite discontent with Qiu Yi Meng right now.

Qiu Yi Meng went silent for a moment before staring at Yang Kai, her eyes filled with a look of expectation as she whispered, “If I really had attacked you, would you have resisted?”

“What do you think?” Yang Kai stared back at her.

“I don’t know, I never could tell what you’re thinking.”

“I’m not an idiot, how could I just stand there and let you stab me!”

“Sure enough...” Qiu Yi Meng laughed bitterly, “You’ve always been a selfish person, but if you weren’t, you wouldn’t be you.”

Yang Kai suddenly wore a fierce grin, “If you really had tried to attack me, then today your life would have been over.”

“What would you do to me? Kill me?”

“Nothing so dramatic, I’d just strip off all your clothes, and then... heh, spank your little butt red!”

Qiu Yi Meng’s pale cheeks suddenly blushed furiously. No one had ever spoken such shameful words to her and she was at a loss about how to respond, in her mind she couldn’t help imagining a scene where she laid across Yang Kai’s lap naked and was repeatedly smacked.

[Shameful!]

“Stop it. Both of you!” Luo Xiao Man stood helplessly to one side and pitifully called out, “Quickly tend to her injuries.”

“She won’t die.” Yang Kai said in an intentionally aloof face before tightly holding Qiu Yi Meng and standing up. Glancing over at the chaotic battlefield, a cold light flashed through the depths of his eyes before he turned around and hurried into the house.

Luo Xiao Man chased after him quickly.

A short time later, the three arrived at Su Yan’s room.

Pushing open the door, the trio was hit by a blast of cold air.

Su Yan was sitting on the ice crystal bed, seemingly cultivating, but in fact her mind wasn’t here at all. The commotion outside Yang Kai’s house and the ensuing battle had naturally drawn her attention, but because of her identity as a High Heaven Pavilion disciple, it wasn’t convenient for her to come forward to join the fray and could only wait here quietly.

“What happened? How did she receive such an injury?” Su Yan saw Qiu Yi Meng’s condition and quickly inquired.

“This silly girl did it to herself.” Yang Kai said while laying Qiu Yi Meng down on the ice bed, the profound chill quickly enveloping her and causing her to shiver.

However, thanks to this influx of cold Qi, her wound stopped bleeding and her pain was also numbed.

“I’ll leave her to you.” Yang Kai snorted, turned around and left.

The location of Qiu Yi Meng’s injury was too sensitive, if she had been wounded anywhere else, Yang Kai would handle it himself, but since it was on her lower abdomen, he could only hand her treatment over to Su Yan.

Su Yan also had some Myriad Drug Milk on her and would know what to do.

The sound of battle outside continued to grow and very soon it seemed as if half the night sky was illuminated by explosions of light.

When Yang Kai returned to the outside of the house, he suddenly found that the battle had reached a fever pitch with both forces’ strength comparable to each other.

The enemy force consisted of twenty Qiu Family Fallen Leaves Hall masters at or above the Immortal Ascension Boundary Sixth Stage.

On his own side there were three Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary masters, Ying Jiu, Tang Yu Xian, and Old Demon, each of whom was currently displaying phenomenal strength

Shui Ling was also taking advantage of her special constitution to harass the enemy and disrupt their concentration.

There were also many other Immortal Ascension Boundary masters from Yang Kai’s allies participating in the battle one way or another. In terms of quantity, Yang Kai undoubtedly held a big advantage, but each master from the Fallen Leaves Hall couldn’t be underestimated, so even if they were heavily outnumbered, the fight was still relatively even.

The battle quickly became a difficult struggle.

Since the beginning of the Inheritance War, Yang Kai and his allies had never encountered such a situation, every battle they fought had always been a lopsided route.

Chen Xuan and the other Qiu Family masters were even more shocked though. They had arrived here tonight full of confidence, but when the battle really began, they discovered that the rumors weren’t exaggerations at all and had even underestimated the combat power of the cultivators in Yang Kai’s house.

The Fallen Leaves Hall had deployed almost all of its manpower for this operation yet now they had no way to defeat the forces of a single Yang Family Young Lord.

Chen Xuan couldn’t help feeling a great sense of shame but quickly steadied himself and began to fight back seriously.

Yang Kai watched for a moment but didn’t go personally enter the fray, instead turning his eyes towards a spot in the distance.

From the direction he was staring, he felt the auras of many strong masters.

The strength of each of these people was no worse than that of the masters from the Fallen Leaves Hall, but they numbered several times as many!

Without a doubt these people were the masters from the other six families.

Just as Yang Kai suspected, three kilometers away on the third floor of a large building, the six super family’s Young Lords and Young Ladies, headed by Ye Xin Rou, had gathered and were observing the battle.

Although it was night time, the moon was full so everything that had taken place in front of Yang Kai’s mansion had been seen by them.

Qiu Yi Meng suddenly attacking, Yang Kai taking action in response, they had witnessed everything.

But the final result surprised all of them!

The one who fell in a pool of their own blood was actually Qiu Yi Meng.

Ye Xin Rou’s beautiful face flashed a gloating expression before she coldly snorted, “Yang Kai really has lost his humanity, he’ll even viciously attack someone who supported him for so long and who he had such a good relationship with like Qiu Yi Meng.”

Kang Zhan and the other Young Lords silently nodded, although they were discontent with Ye Xin Rou’s arrogant attitude, they still agreed with her current rhetoric.

They were too far from the battle and hadn’t seen any of the intrigue which played out, all they were able to determine was that Qiu Yi Meng had been stabbed by Yang Kai.

Since entering Yang Kai’s mansion more than ten months ago, Qiu Yi Meng had served as his right arm, managing all of the matters inside his house even down the deployment of his allied forces, she had put in a tremendous amount of work and effort, but in the end, Yang Kai hadn’t even hesitated to attack her.

No matter who saw this, wouldn’t they be disappointed?

With such an example, how could anyone think Yang Kai still had any sense of morality? It was obvious that he cared nothing for his allies and all that mattered to him was his own interests.

Only Huo Xing Chen wore a different expression, a subtle sneer adorning his face. Although he hadn’t seen exactly what happened just now, he wholeheartedly disagreed with Ye Xin Rou’s assessment.

“It seems like my plan has failed.” Ye Xin Rou said, however there was not look of disappointment on her face, instead there was even a hint of joy. She apparently very much enjoyed watching Qiu Yi Meng’s bitter experience, but she quickly wore a calm, indifferent expression, “If only I had known things would turn out like this I wouldn’t have sent Elder Sister Qiu in to face such danger alone. *Ha...* it seems I overestimated Yang Kai’s humanity, he can no longer be saved. He is a true demon who no longer recognizes friends or family.”

“What should we do now?” Gao Rang Feng asked pointedly, Qiu Yi Meng’s so called surprise attack force hadn’t played any role at all which made him suddenly suspect if Ye Xin Rou knew things would turn out this was and had deliberately set the former up to fail. Thinking so, a thick sense of detest began to well up in his heart.

“Let’s observe the situation for a while longer,” Ye Xin Rou said without the slightest sense of tension, her expression calm and light. Oh! The fight is starting to get fiercer.”

“Shouldn’t we send reinforcements?” Kang Zhan frowned, “If we stand by and do nothing I’m afraid the Qiu Family will complain later.”

“Let them fight for a while longer.” Ye Xin Rou faintly smiled, “Ying Jiu and Tang Yu Xian have already activated their Mad Tyrant Blood Skill, I don’t think anyone from any of your families wants to face them in their current state, right? After a while, the effects of the Mad Tyrant Blood Skill will disappear, that will be the best time for us to intervene.”

The looks on each of the Young Lord’s faces became awkward but none of them opened their mouths to refute.

No one wanted to lose one of their families’ masters when there was another option available.

After this brief conversation, everyone fell silent and waited patiently.

As time passed, the fighting only became more and more fierce and people were constantly injured or killed.

Yang Kai’s allies and the Fallen Leaves Hall both suffered losses.

Although the powerhouses from the Fallen Leaves Hall held nothing back and fully displayed their great strength, it wasn’t enough to ensure their safety in this kind of melee.

This was especially true when Yang Kai finally joined the battle, the moment he entered the fray the delicate balance was broken. After unleashing an eruption of evil energy from inside his Unyielding Golden Skeleton, the Immortal Ascension Boundary Second Stage Yang Kai was actually able to fight evenly with a Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary masters.

Also, now that Yang Kai had opened his Knowledge Sea, he could display the full might of his Soul Skills and Soul type artifact. Using these two methods he was able to catch people off guard by launching swift, unexpected attacks, often able to kill people in a single strike!

The Fallen Leaves Hall immediately began suffering heavy losses and the situation quickly became dire. Suddenly facing immense pressure, Chen Xuan couldn’t stand it anymore and shouted loudly, “Young Lady Ye!”
