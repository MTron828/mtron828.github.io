Seeing that nobody was answering, Ye Hen calmly stated, “Luo Jin’s behaviour is shameless. Friends, are you really going to stand together with such a person?”

Due to his anger, he no longer acted polite with Luo Jin and directly called out his name.

The man with a back like a tiger’s and a waist like a bear’s coldly snorted when he heard this, “Forget about City Lord Luo’s matter. This King wants to ask that little brat surnamed Yang just what grudge my Sky Peak Temple’s Vice Temple Master Ke Tian has with him for him to kill Ke Tian at the City Lord’s Mansion!”

With his tone, it was obvious that he was Ruan Hong Bo, the Temple Master of Sky Peak Temple.

Ruan Hong Bo was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm, just like Ye Hen. It was impossible for him to do nothing since his Vice Temple Master had been killed by Yang Kai. That was why he still came along to take revenge even though he didn’t like Luo Jin’s character.

When Ruan Hong Bo finished speaking, someone else immediately added, “That’s right, that villain even killed my son Mu Zheng. I, Mu Guan, am absolutely irreconcilable with him!”

Ye Hen turned to see that the speaker was Mu Guan, the Tower Master of White Clouds Tower.

Ye Hen had questioned Ye Jing Han in detail before about what happened that day at the City Lord’s Mansion. He knew that Yang Kai had indeed killed Mu Zheng and even used his physique to write a large ‘death’ character on the wall to scare all the guests.

However, this matter was Mu Zheng courting death himself. He insisted on taking action despite not having any abilities. Who else’s fault was it that Yang Kai killed him to strike fear into the others? Still, it was obvious that the White Clouds Tower wouldn’t just let this go. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“That little brat injured my Heart Seeking Pavilion’s disciple. This Pavilion Master came here to ask him for a reasonable explanation,” The Heart Seeking Pavilion’s Pavilion Master also came out.

“Sect Master Ye, just give Yang Kai to us. That will give face to all of us.”

As various Third-Order Dao Source Realm Masters levelled their accusations, the higher-ups of Thousand Leaves Sect all gradually changed expressions. However, Ye Hen still maintained a calm expression. He turned to look at the blue-haired man who was sitting on the rickshaw, “Palace Lord Qiu, is this also your intention?”

Ye Hen wasn’t afraid of everyone else here, but the one he couldn’t ignore was this blue-haired man. He was Palace Master Qiu Ze of the Sky Illumination Palace, and was a peak Dao Source Realm Master. It was said that he had been in retreat to try and peer into the secrets of the Emperor Realm over the past ten years in hopes of a breakthrough.

No news had been heard over the past ten plus years of him going outside, so it was unexpected that he would actually come to the Thousand Leaves Sect today.

Ye Hen didn’t dare to relax his guard against this person, since it was highly likely that he would reach the Emperor Realm. Once he was an Emperor, not a single person within a radius of a hundred thousand kilometres would be capable of challenging him.

Qiu Ze smiled slightly, “My son Qiu Yu is unskilled and suffered against that little brat surnamed Yang. This King came here to invite him to be a guest at my Sky Illumination Palace for a few days to teach Qiu Yu how to cultivate. They’re both youngsters, so they should be able to find some common topics to talk about. Please don’t refuse, Sect Master Ye.”

His words sounded polite, but everyone knew that this was only an excuse.

Yang Kai had indeed seriously injured Qiu Yu at the City Lord’s Mansion on that day. However, Qiu Ze wouldn’t personally act just for that alone. Sky Illumination Palace and Thousand Leaves Sect had a longstanding grudge with each other. Sky Illumination Palace was a new Sect that had hope of becoming the leader of this region, while the Thousand Leaves Sect was an old great force that was currently declining. If the prior wanted to gain authority, it would obviously benefit them to attack the latter.

As long as Qiu Ze could eliminate the Thousand Leaves Sect, Sky Illumination Palace’s authority would be untouchable and he would become the ruler of this entire area.

“Give him up!”

“Sect Master Ye, we have no grudge with your Thousand Leaves Sect and don’t want to make things difficult for you; however, that bastard surnamed Yang can’t be forgiven that easily. Sect Master Ye, don’t shelter him!”

The major Sect Masters all began to speak up and pressure Thousand Leaves Sect.

Ye Hen furrowed his brow. The higher-ups of the Thousand Leaves Sect who came with him all felt panic in their hearts as their expressions changed.

Although the Sect Defending Array was protecting them, and the people here probably couldn’t do anything to them, Thousand Leaves Sect’s disciples would need to go out eventually. It was impossible to hide behind their Array forever. If they antagonized so many great forces, Thousand Leaves Sect would never know peace afterwards.

The Thousand Leaves Sect’s higher-ups all glanced at Ye Hen as they thought of this.

They didn’t know just what kind of relationship Yang Kai and Ye Hen had, or why Yang Kai came to hide at Thousand Leaves Sect after causing so much trouble, which brought trouble to the Sect. Also, why did Ye Hen still accept Yang Kai despite clearly knowing about all of this!

This obviously didn’t seem like a wise decision.

“Sect Master...” A Second-Order Dao Source Realm Elder gently called out to Ye Hen. Although he didn’t say anything, his meaning was quite obvious.

Yang Kai wasn’t related at all to Thousand Leaves Sect, so the Elder felt that they should cooperate here and give Yang Kai to the others in exchange for safety, which was better than having so many hostile people blocking their doorstep.

Ye Hen glanced at the Elder and calmly declared, “I know what I’m doing.”

When the Elder heard this, he could only heavily sigh without saying anything more. He was from an older generation of Thousand Leaves Sect and had watched Ye Hen grow up. He understood Ye Hen’s temperament and knew that the latter wouldn’t do anything ridiculous. Thus, he chose to believe that Ye Hen wouldn’t harm the Sect, even though he was still really worried.

“Sect Master!” Thousand Leaves Sect Vice Sect Master Shi Cang Ying suddenly came over and cupped his fists as he quickly said, “This Shi feels that our foreign friends’ words are reasonable. That little brat surnamed Yang doesn’t know any respect and dared to act as he pleased in the City Lord’s Mansion, which is too ridiculous. He even killed someone as venerated as Sir Ke Tian, so he’s clearly a bloodthirsty person who relishes in murder. No matter what his goals are, he definitely doesn’t have good intentions in coming to our Thousand Leaves Sect. This Shi asks the Sect Master to give that boy over to our friends here to deal with so that others don’t speak bad about us by making claims such as our Thousand Leaves Sect being in collusion with him, which will ruin our reputation.”

Qiu Ze smiled, “Vice Sect Master Shi understands well. Very good, very good!”

Shi Cang Ying smiled, “Heaven is watching us. This Shi is simply acting according to the will of Heaven. Palace Lord Qiu is too polite.”

Ye Hen spoke coldly, “Brother Shi, this Ye previously declared that Young Master Yang is an honoured guest of our Thousand Leaves Sect, and that no one is allowed to do anything to him. If you still view me as the Sect Master, then don’t speak of this again.”

Shi Cang Ying’s expression changed slightly, “Sect Master, are you going to ignore the ten thousand years of foundation that our Ancestors left to us?”

Ye Hen replied, “It is precisely because I care about that foundation that I can’t give Young Master Yang to anyone.”

Only Ye Hen and Ye Jing Han knew that Yang Kai had gone to repair the Sealed World’s entrance. Ye Hen hadn’t mentioned this matter to anyone else, so even Shi Cang Ying didn’t know why Ye Hen insisted so much on protecting Yang Kai.

Shi Cang Ying’s heart jumped when he saw Ye Hen’s adamant expression and demeanour that seemed like Ye Hen would fight him if he said anything more about this topic. In Shi Cang Ying’s mind, Ye Hen wasn’t such a forceful person, as Ye Hen was already old and his cultivation wasn’t making any more progress. Ye Hen had always been polite to him over the years, so logically speaking, Ye Hen should have carefully considered anything that he said. Even if he objected, Ye Hen shouldn’t have used such a harsh tone to refuse. So, it made him wonder as to the reasons Ye Hen was so adamant on the topic related to that brat surnamed Yang?

Shi Cang Ying instinctively felt that there was more to this matter, but he didn’t have the time to carefully think it over. His expression darkened as he warned, “Sect Master, you insist on doing this despite everyone’s objections. Must you endanger the Sect like this? Have you thought about our three thousand disciples’ feelings and their future? One mistaken decision from you could ruin our entire Sect! This Shi is Thousand Leaves Sect Vice Sect Master, so I have the duty and responsibility to think about the future of our Sect and our disciples.”

Ye Hen answered coldly, “Are you thinking for your own sake, or for the Sect’s sake?”

Before Shi Cang Ying could reply, Ye Hen shouted in a harsh tone, “I’ve made my decision. Stand back!”

Shi Cang Ying was so surprised to hear this that his body trembled reflexively. It was as if he had just remembered that Ye Hen was the Thousand Leaves Sect Master, while he was only a Vice Sect Master.

Outside the Sect Defending Array, all the Masters watched the show while chuckling coldly in their hearts. It was rumoured that Thousand Leaves Sect was unstable internally and that Ye Hen and Shi Cang Ying didn’t get along well. It now seemed like those rumours were true after all. These two people were the pillars of Thousand Leaves Sect, yet they were actually arguing at such a time, so it was apparent just how much Thousand Leaves Sect had rotted away internally.

Such a Sect wasn’t likely to survive for much longer.

Everyone kept chuckling mentally as they thought about this. They felt as if they could envision the moment of the Thousand Leaves Sect’s destruction.

Shi Cang Ying naturally felt like he lost face since Ye Hen had reprimanded him like this in front of everyone’s eyes. He became angry out of shame as he declared, “Fine, since Sect Master won’t listen to advice and insists on doing things his way without care for the Sect’s safety, then don’t blame this Shi for no longer viewing you as the Sect Master.”

Ye Hen was somewhat astonished as he coldly shouted, “What are you planning to do?”

Shi Cang Ying smiled, “The little brat surnamed Yang antagonized so many Sects, yet he is hiding in our Thousand Leaves Sect and bringing trouble to our doorstep. This Shi is naturally going to hand him over for the Sect’s disciples’ sake. Sect Master, rest assured, this matter has nothing to do with you. Even if anyone wants to assign blame in the future, this Shi will take all responsibility, which won’t soil your reputation!”

He acted all justified, as if he was heroically willing to take a tainted reputation for the Sect’s sake. This instantly gained him the favour of several Thousand Leaves Sect’s higher-ups, who all felt that Ye Hen was indeed insisting on having his way despite everyone’s objections.

Ye Hen seemed to suddenly realize something as he exclaimed, “You dare to send people to capture them?”

Only now did Ye Hen realize that three Elders loyal to Shi Cang Ying had disappeared. Those three Elders were all Second-Order Dao Source Realm Masters, so Yang Kai’s friends wouldn’t be able to stop them at all.

Yang Kai’s friends were only First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators, and although their rooms had barriers set up, the Elders were highly knowledgeable about the barriers and could easily remove them.

After Ye Hen considered all this, his expression greatly changed as he really wanted to kill Shi Cang Ying with a single blow right here.

Ye Hen’s daughter had worked so hard on inviting Yang Kai to Thousand Leaves Sect to fix the Sealed World’s entrance, yet his own Vice Sect Master was going to attack Yang Kai’s friends now. How was he supposed to explain this to Yang Kai if the latter learned about this?

Ye Hen had already made his calculations that even if he antagonized all these Sects this time, as long as Yang Kai could repair the Sealed World’s entrance and help the Thousand Leaves Sect recover their Secret Arts and Secret Techniques, it would all be worth it.

At most, the Thousand Leaves Sect would remain on their mountain for several years and have their Sect’s cultivators learn those Secret Arts and Secret Techniques. As long as they could control the thirty or so Dao Source Grade puppets in the plaza, Thousand Leaves Sect wouldn’t need to be afraid of any nearby Sect and they would also gain breathing room. And as time passed, wouldn’t they also be able to control the Heaven Grade puppets as well?
