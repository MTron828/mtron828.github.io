“Martial Uncle Yu wants to take that child on as a Legacy Disciple, so would you want to get a Disciple too, Martial Uncle Xu?” Yang Kai asked.

“Nonsense!” Xu Ling Gong snapped as he appeared somewhat determined, “I’ve had enough with only three Disciples. I’m basically their Father who raised them from diapers to today. I’ll never accept a Disciple again.”

Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue rolled their eyes, thinking that they were already teenagers when they joined the Sect. Xu Ling Gong was completely exaggerating. Qu Hua Shang was indeed a toddler when she was taken into the Sect, but it was Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue who raised her while Xu Ling Gong acted as an arm-flinging shopkeeper.

Despite their thoughts, they would never dare to say this out loud of course.

Xu Ling Gong said with a grin, “Even though I’m not taking on a Disciple, it doesn’t mean I can’t get some disciples for Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. Your Star Boundary is full of talented young people now, and the World Tree located here is truly abstruse as it has transformed this place greatly. Its aura is able to cleanse a person’s Soul and physique. Before a child is even born, they have already been cleansed thoroughly. You can’t find nearly as many talents in other Universe Worlds as in this place. In my eyes, the Star Boundary is paved with gold. Kid, since you want to share the benefits, are you ready to let others take the lion’s share?”

A nonchalant Yang Kai replied, “It’s said that one has to lose something in order to gain more. Keeping all the benefits to myself will only invite trouble.”

Xu Ling Gong gave him an approving look, “When Qing Boy came back to the Sect, he told me what you had said, and I commend you for that. The Star Boundary is like a treasure trove now. If you intend to hog everything for yourself, you’ll be destroyed one day. All the Cave Heavens and Paradises are very sensitive to events in the 3,000 Worlds. Once news about the Star Boundary spreads, they’ll all flock to this place. The fact that you’re able to see through this and open it up in advance in order to maintain the initiative is praiseworthy.”

There was a solemn expression on Yang Kai’s face, “Please advise me, Martial Uncle Xu.”

Xu Ling Gong waved his hand, “Just like what I’ve said, your place is filled with talents. Even though I’m not going to accept any Disciples, no Cave Heaven or Paradises would refuse more disciples with exceptional aptitudes. In all the Cave Heavens and Paradises, a Core Disciple that can directly ascend to the Sixth-Order will only appear once every 1,000 years or so. Disciples like Qu’er cost each Cave Heaven and Paradise a lot of resources and time to nurture. Of course, there are also freaks like you. If those great forces hadn’t stopped you, you could’ve directly ascended to the Seventh-Order.”

As he spoke, he gave Yang Kai a regretful look.

Yang Kai put on a nonchalant smile, “A tree that rises too far above the forest will be destroyed by the wind. I’m fine with the situation I’m in. At least I don’t have others breathing down my neck all the time and I can have some good rest at night.”

Xu Ling Gong turned to look at Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue as he pointed at Yang Kai, “Look at how sanguine your Junior Brother is. You should learn from him. It’s not easy for a young man to have such a temperament.”

Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue nodded at the same time, “You’re right, Honoured Master.”

Following a sigh, Xu Ling Gong said, “Don’t blame the Cave Heavens and Paradises for meddling in your business, kid. There are some reasons that cannot be exposed to outsiders which make them feel wary of anyone who attempts to directly ascend to the Seventh-Order.”

With a frown, Yang Kai said, “I heard that someone directly ascended to the Seventh-Order in the past and eventually made it to the Ninth-Order. However, due to an accident, many people were slaughtered in the 3,000 Worlds.”

After measuring his words, Xu Ling Gong said, “Something like that, but I can’t tell you the details. You’ll have a clearer picture about it in the future.”

Yang Kai fell into his thoughts as he realised that there were other unknown reasons; however, since Xu Ling Gong wasn’t willing to go further, he couldn’t keep asking.

“Let’s get back to the main topic.” Xu Ling Gong waved his hand, “Let’s talk about the Star Boundary. Now that you’ve opened up this place, I’ve granted your request to bring some people over; however, they’re just the first batch, and more will come soon. Once word gets out, all 108 Cave Heavens and Paradises will send representatives to the Star Boundary, trying to get their hands on the benefits here. Since Yin-Yang Cave Heaven and your Sect are on close terms, I’ll not hesitate to state my demands first.”

“Please go ahead, Martial Uncle Xu.” Yang Kai sported a solemn expression.

Xu Ling Gong gently knocked on the table and enunciated, “Yin-Yang Cave Heaven will take ten disciples from the Star Boundary every 100 years. Will you agree to it?”

Since he had come up with his demand, it was no longer a chat between a Senior and a Junior, it was a negotiation between Yin-Yang Cave Heaven and Yang Kai, who represented Void Land and the Star Boundary.

“Ten people every 100 years!” Despite being ready for it, Yang Kai still gasped upon hearing that, then he put on a bitter smile, “Yin-Yang Cave Heaven alone will get ten people, so that means a total of 1,080 for all 108 forces with a 100 year cycle. It’s not like the Star Boundary can produce so many talented people. All of them will be snatched up by you and other great forces. How is Void Land going to get any benefits?”

Xu Ling Gong shot him a glance, “What’s wrong, kid? Are you going to give everyone a fair deal? Are you also their son-in-law?”

Yang Kai chuckled, “Of course not.”

Xu Ling Gong directly pointed the way for him, “They’ll be more than happy if you could respectively give them one person every 100 years. The Martial Dao is all about quality, not quantity. It’s the same case for disciples. What’s the point of getting so many disciples if all of them are weak? If they’re lucky enough to find one that can directly ascend to the Seventh-Order, it’ll be more valuable than getting 100 weaker disciples.”

Yang Kai played along and said, “Since you’ve said so, Martial Uncle Xu, a disciple every 100 years is all Yin-Yang Cave Heaven will need. What’s the point of getting ten people?”

Xu Ling Gong stared at him without saying a word.

Yang Kai tried to haggle, “Three people.”

Hearing that, Xu Ling Gong rose from the chair and barked, “Qing Boy, Little Xue’er, let’s go home! It seems that this son-in-law doesn’t welcome us. I’m annoyed! Go back and tell Qu’er that there won’t be any wedding either. We’ll call it all off.”

“Ten people it is!” Yang Kai hurriedly pulled Xu Ling Gong back to his seat and placated him, “I was just pulling your leg, Martial Uncle Xu. Why take it so seriously?”

Xu Ling Gong picked up his cup and realised that there was no more tea in it. Seeing that, Yang Kai quickly filled it.

After taking a sip of the tea, Xu Ling Gong spoke in a heartfelt manner, “Do not think that you’re suffering a loss, kid. You have to know that the Star Boundary is on the rise, and this is just the first generation. Under the influence of the World Tree, more and more talented people will appear over the successive generations. Many people will most likely be able to directly ascend to the Fifth-Order and Sixth-Order. Heaven-defying talents who can directly make it to the Seventh-Order might also appear.”

Yang Kai nodded, “I understand.”

“With so many people with outstanding aptitudes around, can Void Land alone provide for them?”

Yang Kai replied honestly, “Of course we can’t.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“In that case, I’d suggest you not waste their talents and send them to other great forces instead. What’s more, all of them will be born in the Star Boundary, so regardless of what Cave Heaven or Paradise they join in the future, their roots will remain here in the Star Boundary, so if the time ever comes, they will defend their ‘home’ no matter what. When they become powerful one day, they’ll not betray the Star Boundary. They’re like the World Tree you’ve planted; there’ll come a day when they’ll give back to this land.”

Yang Kai nodded, “That is the reason I’ve decided to open up this place. First of all, just like what you’ve said, I have no choice but to do so in order to avoid trouble. Secondly, I have to find some suitable paths for the future young talents of the Star Boundary.”

“The fact that you have this consideration is commendable.” Xu Ling Gong gave him an approving look.

Meanwhile, Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue gazed at Yang Kai in disbelief. When he previously told Qing Kui to go back to Yin-Yang Cave Heaven and inform Xu Ling Gong about it, they just thought that he wanted to use their Honoured Master to help fend off the approaching wolves. However, it never crossed their minds that he was so far-sighted.

In a poor family, the parents couldn’t afford to provide for their children if there were too many of them. Regardless of how reluctant they were, they had to give some children away. During times of war or famine, the people who sold their children were not necessarily after the money, many just wanted their children to have a better future. It was true that parents would always worry about their children.

“Since you’re so far-sighted, have you thought about what will happen when all these disciples, who will be scattered everywhere in the 3,000 Worlds, become powerful figures in the Cave Heavens and Paradises one day?”

Yang Kai was startled for a moment before his eyes lit up.

With a smile, Xu Ling Gong patted the other man’s shoulder, “Give it a thought. There will come a day when the Star Boundary becomes the centre of the 3,000 Worlds. All the Cave Heavens and Paradises will have some connections with the Star Boundary, so if the Star Boundary falls into trouble, they’ll not hesitate to help.”

After pondering on it for a moment, Yang Kai asked, “If it’s just like what you’ve said, should I proactively offer more benefits to them instead of haggling with them?”

Xu Ling Gong scoffed, “Don’t go overboard. Just like what you’ve said, if all the benefits are given out, what will be left for your Void Land? You have to be moderate in everything you do. It’s all good if you’re able to pull off this feat, but if you can’t, some people will suffer losses.”

Yang Kai nodded, “I understand. Many thanks for your advice, Martial Uncle Xu.”

After a pause, he chuckled, “I initially thought that Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven and Myriad Demons Heaven should never dream about getting any benefits from the Star Boundary. If they dared to come, I’d tell them to scram.”

“What about now?” Xu Ling Gong gazed at him.

With a smile, Yang Kai replied, “I’ll treat them politely. It’ll be all good if they behave themselves. If they don’t, I’ll have to ask you to lend me a hand.”

Xu Ling Gong grinned, “Since I’ve gotten so many benefits from you, I don’t mind giving you a hand. I even made some preparations before coming to this place.”

Yang Kai batted his eyes, “Should I also share more benefits with the others so that they’ll help out?”

“Of course you’ll have to do that, but there’s no rush. Let them walk around and see more of the Star Boundary. When they realise the importance of this place, it’ll be easier for you to haggle with them.”

“You’re such a cunning man, Martial Uncle Xu!” Yang Kai chuckled.

His laugh then abruptly stopped following a slap from Xu Ling Gong.

“The ten disciples every 100 years that I’ve mentioned is just one of the demands. There’s one more.” Xu Ling Gong patted his sleeves.

Yang Kai rubbed his head and said, “Please explain. I’m all ears.”

“Yin-Yang Cave Heaven will build a Dao Temple in the Star Boundary as a branch of the Master Sect. I’ll select the place myself. Don’t worry, we’ll not snatch your foundation or oppress you. As for the landmass… I’ll need 500,000 square kilometres. We’ll bear the cost of building the Dao Temple and maintaining it, so you’ll just have to agree to giving the land to us.”

Silavin: The thing about war time and poverty is true. Even in Singapore, not that rare to hear friends adopting children from their friends due to circumstances. Well, it is mostly in the past, but still happens in other countries.
