In Guan Qi’s opinion, Yang Kai was definitely a lecher who was weak to beauties. Judging by how Yang Kai was fawning over Yu Ying, he had definitely fallen for her beauty, and this girl wasn’t anything good either. When Guan Qi had met her, she had giggled and flirted with him, trying to make him give her the Star Source here, but after she was rejected, she started attacking without any hesitation, now, without even batting an eye, she was fawning over this newcomer. She was shameless to the core, having not the slightest self-respect or dignity.

Yu Ying smiled and asked, “Does this Senior Brother have some connection with my Netherworld Sect?”

It might have seemed that she was asking a casual question, but she was really showing meticulousness because she knew that she couldn’t trust anyone in the Shattered Star Sea. Yang Kai had only said that their Sect’s name ‘resounded like thunder’. How could she believe that he didn’t hold any malicious intention towards her just based on this?

She needed to inquire a little more so that she could be sure that the other party wasn’t just playing with her since she could not compete with a Third-Order Dao Source Realm.

“Obviously there is,” Yang Kai slightly smiled. He saw through Yu Ying’s meticulous thoughts and pondered for a moment before adding, “I came from the Grand Desolation Star Field. I wonder if Junior Sister has heard of it?”

Yu Ying’s pretty eyes lit up after hearing this as she cried out in surprise, “Grand Desolation Star Field?”

Yang Kai burst into laughter and continued, “Junior Sister, since you have heard of the Grand Desolation Star Field, you should know Senior Brother Yin Le Sheng pretty well, yes?”

Yin Le Sheng was from the Grand Desolation Star Field, and just like Liu Xian Yun, he was a former overlord from that Star Field.

Yang Kai hadn’t expected that he would actually run into someone from the Eastern Territory’s Netherworld Sect in the Shattered Star Sea. He had hoped for it, but he hadn’t expected it to be so easy.

Before he departed from Thousand Leaves Sect, he had been thinking of going to the Netherworld Sect to look for Yin Le Sheng to find out about the whereabouts of Xiao Xiao. Unfortunately, things didn’t turn out as he expected. Before Yang Kai could arrive in the Eastern Territory, he was swept into the Solitary Void Sealed World, and then was later sent to the Northern Territory, which had made his plans go awry.

At this moment though, he had actually run into someone from the Netherworld Sect. Naturally, Yang Kai was pleasantly surprised.

And if by some chance Yin Le Sheng had come to the Shattered Star Sea as well, Yang Kai believed that he could get his location from Yu Ying.

[If I want to find Xiao Xiao, I can only start from Yin Le Sheng.] In a flash, Yang Kai’s gaze towards Yu Ying changed, filling with a fiery light.

Yu Ying had obviously noticed this and turned shy at just the right moment as she stated in a low voice, “Senior Brother Yin, he has been very good to me.”

“Senior Brother?” Yang Kai raised his brow as he asked in surprise. It had been just six or seven years since Yin Le Sheng arrived in the Star Boundary from the Grand Desolation Star Field. Even if he had entered the Netherworld Sect, he shouldn’t have been able to become a Senior Brother in such a short time.

Yu Ying was a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, but she was addressing Yin Le Sheng as Senior Brother, so wouldn’t that mean that Yin Le Sheng’s cultivation was higher than hers?

“Naturally, it is Senior Brother!” Yu Ying smiled, “Senior Brother Yin might have joined the Sect recently, but his aptitude is superb. He was personally taken in by the Sect Master as a Disciple and advanced to the Third-Order Dao Source Realm just before the Shattered Star Sea opened!”

Yang Kai gasped in shock upon hearing this.

Yin Le Sheng actually reached the Third-Order Dao Source Realm in such a short amount of time! Yang Kai thought that his cultivation speed was quite quick, but Yin Le Sheng’s wasn’t bad either, basically keeping pace with him.

Compared to Ai Ou, Chi Yue, and the others’ current cultivation, Yin Le Sheng’s progress was terrifying.

Yu Ying smiled and continued, “Senior Brother Yin is a Star Master from the lower Star Field, and he has received much care from the Sect Master, enjoying many resources. Be that as it may, it is still a miracle to reach the Third-Order Dao Source Realm in such a short time. The year he joined the Sect, I was also a First-Order Dao Source Realm, but now… hehe.”

While speaking, a saddened look appeared on her face, appearing a bit ashamed to compare her progress with Yin Le Sheng’s.

“Senior Brother Yin’s aptitude is extraordinary. He is also the person I admire the most in my life. Knowing that he has already advanced to the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, I am truly gratified!” Yang Kai barely suppressed the nauseating feeling in his heart and spoke words of praise.

Yu Ying seemed to have eliminated the suspicion and vigilance in her heart because he had spoken about the Grand Desolation Field and Yin Le Sheng. It was evident that Yang Kai and Yin Le Sheng had deep ties, otherwise, he shouldn’t have been aware of such secret information.

“Isn’t this Senior Brother also a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master? In this Junior Sister’s opinion, you aren’t worse than Senior Brother Yin,” said Yu Ying, smiling.

“I don’t dare to compare myself with Senior Brother Yin. I was able to reach this point because I encountered an extraordinary opportunity. If it had just been through regular cultivation, how could I stand a chance against Senior Brother Yin’s heaven-defying aptitude? Back then, in the Grand Desolation Star Field, I received many favours and guidance from him. In fact, it was only thanks to him that I was able to come to the Star Boundary. I had planned to join your noble Sect, but unfortunately, the Starlight Corridor collapsed at that time and I was thrown out into the Southern Territory. Since then, I never had the chance to pay homage to your noble Sect.”

“You were also going to join our Sect?” Yu Ying looked at Yang Kai in surprise before asking, “Why haven’t I heard about you from Senior Brother Yin?”

Judging by her tone, she seemed to know Yin Le Sheng fairly well.

Yang Kai smiled and explained, “Senior Brother Yin most likely assumed I had died; after all, I was seriously injured at that time. But that became a blessing in disguise. Not only did I not die, I also gained a great opportunity.”

“So, that’s how it is!” Yu Ying nodded without doubting anything.

Yang Kai, changed the topic, asked, “By the way, is Senior Brother Yin also in the Shattered Star Sea now?”

“He is! Twelve of our Sect’s disciples have come here. Naturally, Senior Brother Yin had a quota too,” replied Yu Ying. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Wonderful!” Yang Kai excitedly shouted, “I have always wanted to go to the Eastern Territory to meet my Senior Brother all these years, but it was simply too far. Who would have thought that I would encounter Junior Sister Yu in the Shattered Star Sea. Tell me, is this not fate?”

Yu Ying giggled and added, “It is this Junior Sister who is blessed to meet Senior Brother here. By the way, how should I address Senior Brother?”

“Feng De, my name is Feng De!” Yang Kai replied.

Feng De was indeed a real character, a burly bald-headed man. Just like Liu Xian Yun, he was together with Yin Le Sheng in the Starlight Corridor; however, he was later killed by Yang Kai. Since Yang Kai wanted to impersonate someone from the Grand Desolation Star Field, he had used this name.

Who knows what kind of expression Yin Le Sheng would show when he heard that Feng De had come back from the dead.

“Greetings, Senior Brother Feng!” After having chatted with Yang Kai, Yu Ying was no longer suspicious of him. Instead, she was acting quite ‘familiar’. A glimmer flashed in her eyes as she asked, “Senior Brother Feng, are you still interested in joining our Sect? Or is Senior Brother already part of another Sect?”

Yang Kai promptly replied, “How could I belong to any Sect? I had joined a small Sect before, but it was destroyed not long after. I have been wandering alone since then.” While speaking, he looked at Yu Ying with expectation, “I do indeed wish to join your noble Sect, but unfortunately, I never got the chance to meet Senior Brother Yin and did not know anyone else who could give me a recommendation. So, I didn’t dare to take any liberties.”

Yu Ying smiled and stated, “That’s a simple matter to resolve. I will take you to Senior Brother Yin when we are done with the things here. When you see Senior Brother Yin, you can ask him yourself. I believe he will not refuse you.”

“Really!?” Yang Kai was overjoyed.

“Why would Junior Sister lie to you?” Yu Ying slightly smiled, flying over and leaning her soft and fragrant figure against Yang Kai before meaningfully asking, “When Senior Brother Feng joins our Sect, don’t forget to take good care of this Junior Sister.”

Yang Kai immediately showed a lustful look as he agreed, nodding repeatedly, “If I can really join your noble Sect, then Junior Sister Yu will be my great benefactor. This Feng will never treat you like an outsider.”

Yu Ying broke into a giggle, “Then, let me thank Senior Brother Feng in advance.”

The two began a steamy chat, while the gloominess of the nearby Guan Qi’s face only increased.

When Yang Kai stated that he came from some Grand Desolation Star Field, he had already realized something was wrong. Later, the more the two fools talked, the more passionate they became. The unfriendly look in this Feng De’s eyes gave him a sense of crisis.

At this moment, the two of them were acting more like Senior Brother and Junior Sister, obviously intent on pulling their relationship closer, leaving Guan Qi anxious.

He might have been able to fight off Yu Ying before, but with Yang Kai added to the mix, he had absolutely no chance of winning. And judging by Yang Kai’s previous attitude, he clearly didn’t have a good impression of the Seeking Passion Sect. Since he was a Seeking Passion Sect disciple, what good would it do to bargain here?

He wanted to escape, but he didn’t dare to act rashly, lest he draw their murderous intentions.

But if he didn’t leave now, what could he do?

Considering all this, he clenched his teeth and stated, cupping his fist, “Friends, you can continue with your chat, this Guan will take his leave first.”

While speaking, his figure swayed and he prepared to retreat.

Yu Ying, who was chatting with Yang Kai with a smile on her face, suddenly turned cold, her expression changing as quickly as flipping a page and she shouted in a piercing voice, “Where do you think you’re going?”

Just as she screamed, she raised her bare and tender arm as a dark and gloomy ghost claw tore towards Guan Qi. The ghost claw was exuding an incomparably sinister and cold aura.

Guan Qi’s face changed and he immediately sent out a barrage of fist shadows towards the sky.

Deafening explosions immediately rang out as the two moves cancelled one another out.

But having been blocked by Yu Ying like this, Guan Qi didn’t dare to leave.

“Senior Brother Feng…” Yu Ying suddenly coquettishly called out to Yang Kai, shaking his arm as she stamped her foot and pleaded, “He is bullying me, don’t you care!?”

Yang Kai immediately got goosebumps and cold sweat formed on his back. He was barely suppressing the nausea in his heart as he stated with a cold snort, “You, rat, dare to bully my Junior Sister Yu, are you really that tired of living!?”

Even though he didn’t like members of the Seeking Passion Sect, at the end of day, he had no grievances or grudges with this Guan Qi. Therefore, there was no reason for him to kill Guan Qi. Not to mention, he didn’t like being treated as someone else’s dog. Obviously, Yu Yin was using her power to embarrass Guan Qi, and Yang Kai disdained such practices, so although he was presenting a vicious stance, he didn’t release the slightest murderous intent.

Guan Qi grit his teeth and explained himself, “Brother Feng, I discovered the Star Source here first, and this… Young Lady wanted to snatch it from me after the fact. We had a disagreement, which led to a fight. She hasn’t suffered any injuries and this Guan doesn’t want this Star Source either. I just want to leave this place. Friend, I’m asking you to allow me to leave.”
