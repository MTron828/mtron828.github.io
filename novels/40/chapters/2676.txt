Yang Kai held his burning fury inside his heart. The battle with this young woman reminded him of his helplessness against Shi Huo in the Ancient Lands more than a year ago.

He could not kill Shi Huo back then, and now, was it possible that he could not kill this stupid little woman too?

Rage erupted in Yang Kai’s heart as his blood boiled like magma. Although he was still overwhelmed by the woman’s terrifying brute strength and mostly defended instead of attacked, as the battle went on, he became more and more furious and excited, and the flow of his strength also became smoother and smoother.

*Hong hong hong… *

The two figures constantly collided with each other and whizzed around the mountains. Countless mountains collapsed, while all living creatures nearby ran for their lives. From time to time, Yang Kai’s blood splattered the air from an attack, but he would pounce back into the battle tenaciously without the slightest hesitation.

His clothes were almost completely torn, and the more pieces of his robes fell with each exchange. His upper body was completely naked now, leaving only a few strips of cloth covering the private part of his lower body. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He never wore Artifact Armour, not that he didn’t possess any. Throughout the recent years, he had killed many Masters and obtained a lot of loot like Artifact Armours from their Space Rings; however, Yang Kai did not refine them as he did not think that he would need them. Even though Artifact Armour could provide a layer of protection, it would also isolate his perception of danger.

It was not good relying too much on external aids.

However, how could ordinary clothes withstand such a violent battle? If the battle continued, Yang Kai would probably be totally naked before long.

Surprisingly, the woman did not feel shy at all, as if she did not see anything on Yang Kai. Even if she had never seen a man’s naked body before, she ought to have heard some stories about it, and it was nothing interesting to her… Furthermore, she did not think it mattered what a dead man looked like.

Compared with Yang Kai’s messy condition, the battle seemed to be much more relaxed for the young woman. No matter how fierce Yang Kai’s attacks were, she could resolve them easily. The terrifying strength that she possessed was simply unfathomable. Even the strongest Monster Beasts would not be able to compete with her in strength.

*Pu… *

Yang Kai spurted another mouthful of blood as he shot out again, ploughing a deep ravine into the ground as the last remnants of clothing on his lower half were shredded.

The woman frowned slightly, thinking that Yang Kai was simply too stubborn and unreasonable.

If it were any other ordinary Emperor Realm Master, he would have been smashed into mince by now. Nevertheless, Yang Kai was still alive, and although he looked utterly dishevelled, his fighting spirit was only rising instead. This was all thanks to the surging vitality in his peculiar golden blood she thought, if not for it, this man would have been long dead.

Sure enough, the Golden Blood was really bizarre.

Yang Kai got up trembling, spat out the blood in his mouth, and stared at the young woman defiantly with shocking brilliance in his eyes.

Facing such adversity and the desperate struggle itself made him recall the moment when he obtained the Demon Mystic Tome many years ago. It was precisely because of his unyielding spirit that he was able to obtain the recognition of the Demon Mystic Tome and begin his journey on the Martial Dao.

The situation at this moment was very similar to that time.

However, that incident was too long ago, and he had almost forgotten that feeling.

Because of this suffering, Yang Kai finally found his fierce spirit rekindled after a long period of dormancy.

[As long as I remain unyielding, who can stop me?]

With a single thought, he vaguely comprehended something. The blood in his body circulated with increasing haste, and his wounds began to heal rapidly. Yang Kai stretched out his hand and wiped the blood clots off his body, revealing new skin.

“I see!” Yang Kai’s eyes sparkled with radiance.

Over the years, his reliance on Secret Techniques and Artifacts in battle had caused him almost to forget his unyielding spirit. The insight that he gained today was truly fruitful.

“You…” The young woman slightly furrowed her brow, instinctively sensing that something had changed with Yang Kai just now, but she could not tell what this transformation was.

Yang Kai took out a new set of clothes from his Space Ring and put them on.

He beckoned the woman by curling his index finger, “Again!”

Infuriated, the woman gritted her teeth, “Since you can’t wait to die, I will fulfil your wish!”

Without showing any unnecessary animation, she rushed towards Yang Kai’s face and threw another punch.

Yang Kai immediately punched back to counter. At the moment their knuckles touched, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, and he burst out the power of his whole body in all directions.

*Hong… *

Yang Kai was blown away again, but this time, the young woman also couldn’t help withdrawing a single step back.

“What just happened…” The young woman was shocked. Previously, no matter how hard Yang Kai tried, he would not be able to even shake her. However, she was forced to take a step back from this clash, clearly indicating that the power of his punch was many folds greater than before.

What transformation could he have possibly undergone in this short time to achieve such rapid growth?

“Hahaha!” Yang Kai flew back with a laugh as he tumbled through the sky before crashing down on a certain hill, “Give an inch and you take a mile. Look at how weak you are, you are still just a woman after all!”

The young woman was exasperated and her next punch flew out like a gust of wind that shrouded towards Yang Kai.

For a moment, the sky was full of fist shadows.

After a short while, the two figures separated. The ground under the young woman’s feet cracked, and her breathing had become a slight bit faster. Yang Kai’s new clothes were torn again, his skin was cracked, and his Golden Blood dripped down like streams from his wounds, but despite his messy look, he was even more excited, like nothing but the battle before him existed anymore.

The woman finally showed a solemn look as she swept her eyes over Yang Kai and asked, “What’s your name?”

She had asked this before in front of the City Lord’s Mansion, but at that time she was not really interested in knowing the answer because she did not put Yang Kai in her eyes. To her, Yang Kai was already a dead man, so why did she need to know his name?

But now, she asked the same question again.

The Human whom she looked down on was finally worthy of her attention, if only a little of it.

The strong had always treated each other with respect.

“Yang Kai!”

After a moment of silence, the woman replied, “Zhu Qing!”

Yang Kai was stunned at first, then he nodded when he realized that it was her name, “I’ll remember it.”

Zhu Qing looked at him in surprise, and questioned, “Don’t you have anything to say after hearing this Queen’s name?”

Yang Kai thought about it carefully, and answered, “It’s a nice name. Sweet and simple. Not bad, not bad.”

Zhu Qing could not help rolling her eyes as she could not believe that this guy really could not connect her name to anything. Zhu Qing finally realised why Yang Kai was so fearless; he was just an ignorant idiot. She wondered how he had managed to become a First-Order Emperor in the first place.

Although she admitted this young man was talented, he had violated a grave taboo, and the world could not tolerate his existence. He had to die.

“Never mind!” Zhu Qing waved her hand in disappointment, “Time to get serious.”

“Hmph, this Young Master also hasn’t given it his all yet! I was being a gentleman the whole time because you are a woman.”

Although Yang Kai boasted so, internally he was screaming, [What the hell did this crazy woman mean? Was she just fooling around up till now? How arrogant is she? I can’t come off as weak in front of her!]

“I know,” Zhu Qing smiled faintly, revealing a serene look.

Yang Kai thought that she would snap back at him for his arrogance, but unexpectedly she actually answered like this.

“What do you know?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

Zhu Qing tucked her hair behind her ear and answered slowly, “You refined those things but haven’t used them yet, so of course, you haven’t given it your all yet.”

Yang Kai frowned, “You keep talking about ‘those things’, but what do you mean?”

Zhu Qing did mention that he refined something that he should not have earlier, and this was the reason for their battle; however, he hated people trying to act mysterious with him the most. If it were not for her ample figure, he would have slapped her in the face.

Zhu Qing’s expression turned cold, and retorted, “You don’t even remember what you refined?”

Her aura changed tremendously in the next instant. If she had appeared like a harmless woman next door previously, now she was like a Flood Dragon that was going out to the sea to commit murder.

Yang Kai retorted, “This Young Master has refined so many things over his life, how could I possibly know what you’re talking about if you don’t tell me?”

“Then…” Zhu Qing touched her red lips and flashed a sweet smile, “Let me help you remember.”

When the words fell, she already reappeared in front of Yang Kai, her hand in the shape of a claw as she grabbed at his chest. Her speed was so fast that Yang Kai could not react at all.

Perhaps it was an illusion, but Yang Kai seemed to hear a dragon roar at that moment as Zhu Qing’s small hand seemed to transform into a dragon claw. It appeared that she was attempting to tear down all his defences to gouge out his heart in one blow.

Sure enough, this young woman had not given it her all earlier. Yang Kai hurriedly stepped back, horrified.

But Yang Kai could not shake her off as Zhu Qing chased after him like a shadow. When she reached right under his nose, he could smell her orchid-like breath when she warned him, “If you don’t use it now, you won’t have a chance to use it again.”

At the critical moment of life and death, a realization dawned on Yang Kai and he shouted, “Dragon Transformation!”

His aura that was already quite strong instantly rose to a new high, his monstrous power became comparable to a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master. Pieces of scales suddenly appeared on Yang Kai’s exposed skin, and both his hands also turned into dragon claws at the same time. A golden ray of light flashed behind him as a giant Golden Divine Dragon illusory phantom manifested.

Zhu Qing’s heart sped up inexplicably as she lifted her head and stared behind Yang Kai, but she saw nothing. She was dumbstruck, staring with her eyes widened.

However, because of this short moment of delay, her momentum decreased sharply.

Yang Kai immediately stretched out his dragon claw to grab her hand.

“Oh no!” The pretty face of Zhu Qing turned pale as she hurriedly tried to retreat, but it was too late as she was too close to Yang Kai. Yang Kai successfully caught her hand, and his dragon claw unleashed a mighty power, which made Zhu Qing feel pain, a sensation she rarely felt.

“Caught you!” There were Dragon Scales vaguely appearing on Yang Kai’s face, and his bearing changed greatly, becoming dreadfully overbearing.

“Let go of me!” Zhu Qing shouted as she punched Yang Kai’s chest with her other fist.

Yang Kai did not move, however, and simply allowed the punch to hit his chest directly, resulting in a metallic clang. Sparks flew and his chest sunk in somewhat. His body staggered a bit, but he still held Zhu Qing’s hand tightly in his grip.

Zhu Qing was dumbfounded as she did not expect that her strike to be so weak.

No, it wasn’t her punch that was weak, but Yang Kai who had grown stronger.

When she thought of punching again, Yang Kai suddenly reached out and grabbed her free arm. Both of her arms were restrained now, unable to budge. He held her so close to himself that there was only a finger’s length of distance between their faces now.
