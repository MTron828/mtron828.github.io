A Phoenix Blood Fruit had no other uses besides being an exceptional healing tonic. As long as the injured person was still breathing, this fruit could certainly save their life. In this sense, its use was quite similar to the Immortal Source Liquid.

Fan Wu and the others widened their eyes in disbelief. Although they were aloof Divine Spirits, they had never seen anything as precious as the Phoenix Blood Fruit before, leaving them flabbergasted.

But soon, the faces of these three Divine Venerables fell. Luan Feng’s pretty face was especially filled with regret and anxiety.

Judging from the situation they were in, although the bloodline of this Heavens Order’s descendant had awakened completely, she still regarded Yang Kai as someone precious to her. If this wasn’t the case, she wouldn’t have drawn out a Phoenix Blood Fruit from the Blood Gate to help him heal his injuries as this act was quite an extravagant waste.

Earlier, when Yang Kai was tortured and humiliated by Shi Huo, all three of them just watched from the side and did nothing, which led to Yang Kai becoming so battered. They wondered if this Heavens Order’s descendant would next settle the score with them.

Luan Feng was especially worried because Zhang Ruo Xi had slapped herself and begged her to help Yang Kai, but she remained unfazed, and she didn’t have any intention of stopping Zhang Ruo Xi, which led to the young girl slapping herself continuously until her cheeks were completely swollen. The blood at the corner of Zhang Ruo Xi’s mouth hadn’t even dried up yet.

If Luan Feng had known this would be the outcome, she would’ve done her a favour and saved Yang Kai, thereby making the young girl owe her one. However, she wasn’t willing to do that earlier because she didn’t want to offend Shi Huo. Looking back now, it was obvious whose favour was more important.

Now that Shi Huo was dead and his Source Strength had been taken away, Luan Feng’s previous worries looked laughable and had put her into a tight spot. It was the first time she felt so regretful in her life, and her mouth was filled with bitterness. Given a second chance, she would definitely choose to go against Shi Huo.

“Sir, heal your wounds first,” Seeing that Yang Kai remained unmoving with the Phoenix Blood Fruit in his hand, Zhang Ruo Xi couldn’t help but urge him to eat it. She had travelled together with Yang Kai for many years, but this was the first time she saw him looking so battered. While she was feeling sorry for him, her heart was also filled with resentment. Although she had killed the main culprit, Shi Huo, the other three present who did nothing but stood by were equally to blame in her mind.

After a nod, Yang Kai put the Phoenix Blood Fruit into his mouth and gulped it down. Although the fruit was rare and precious, he wouldn’t turn down Zhang Ruo Xi’s good intention. In an instant, the fresh and sweet juice permeated in his mouth. Following that, a warm stream in his stomach began flowing towards all his organs, filling his entire body and bones as it rapidly healed his wounds.

Yang Kai was shocked. Although he had known that Phoenix Blood Fruit was the best fruit for healing, he only realized how incredible the spirit fruit was after tasting it. It was said that as long as the injured person was still breathing, one piece of Phoenix Blood Fruit was enough to fully restore that person. Now, it seemed that these rumours weren’t exaggerated.

“Sir, how should we deal with them?” Zhang Ruo Xi spoke to Yang Kai via Divine Sense while turning her eyes to look at Fan Wu and the others, who dared not move a muscle.

The chests of Fan Wu and the others tightened when they saw her turning to gaze at them and they subconsciously gulped. Her cold gaze sent chills down their spines as they wondered what this Heavens Order’s descendant was thinking.

“How do you want to deal with them?” Yang Kai asked her the same question instead of answering it.

“I want to kill them all!” Zhang Ruo Xi’s gaze turned cold.

Yang Kai put on a bitter smile as he knew that she must be resentful of them. There was no way she would let them off.

“But, I’ll listen to you,” Zhang Ruo Xi added. “I’ll kill them if you want them dead.”

After giving it a thought, Yang Kai replied, “You don’t own the power that you used to kill Shi Huo, right?”

Zhang Ruo Xi nodded slightly and uttered, “I borrowed the power my ancestors left behind inside the Blood Gate. My own power isn’t enough to go up against them yet.”

“What are the downsides of using that power?” Yang Kai asked. He knew that borrowing such strength was no easy task; after all, Zhang Ruo Xi was still just a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, so it was impossible that there were no consequences for her using a power great enough to kill a Divine Spirit.

After a moment of silence, Zhang Ruo Xi replied honestly, “There’ll be some slight burden on my body.”

“Forget it then,” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

“But, Sir…” Zhang Ruo Xi didn’t seem happy to let them off.

Yang Kai uttered, “Although they didn’t offer to help us, it doesn’t mean they should be killed. What they did was what most people would do in that situation. At the end of the day, they didn’t harm me one bit. It’s good enough that Shi Huo is dead. Moreover, Luan Feng stopped you from killing yourself, so I owe her a favour.”

Zhang Ruo Xi bit her lip and nodded almost imperceptibly, which suggested that she agreed with Yang Kai, “Since you’ve said so, I won’t kill them, then. But, we still have to teach them a lesson, otherwise, they’ll think that we’re pushovers!” After a snort, she stood up in front of Yang Kai and shot a cold glare at Fan Wu and the others.

Yang Kai shook his head with a helpless smile. Zhang Ruo Xi’s temperament had changed drastically after her Bloodline Power awakened. She was now so domineering that Yang Kai couldn’t get used to it. With that said, he still felt her transformation was a good thing overall because timid and obedient people would only be bullied in this world.

It was the first time Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Gou felt so apprehensive in their lives. As they watched Zhang Ruo Xi and Yang Kai communicating with each other secretly, they felt like they were sitting on pins and needles. Seeing that Zhang Ruo Xi stood up and turned to face them, they felt a crawling sensation on their scalps, and they instinctively wanted to flee. However, Shi Huo’s death served as a lesson for them, so they didn’t dare to make any rash move lest they be killed on the spot.

“Madam, is there anything we can do for you?” Fan Wu grit his teeth and cupped his fists before asking. Luan Feng and Cang Gou looked apprehensively at them with their faces stiffened.

Zhang Ruo Xi snorted and uttered coldly, “Listen well. All of you helped Shi Huo oppress the weak and made things difficult for Sir. Even if I slaughtered you all, it wouldn’t begin to calm the fury in my heart!”

The expressions of Fan Wu and the others changed drastically when they heard this, and they almost wanted to run for their lives. However, they forced themselves to remain on the spot because they were too frightened of Zhang Ruo Xi.

“But…” Zhang Ruo Xi suddenly changed her tone, “Sir is a kind-hearted man, so he doesn’t want to kill others unless it’s necessary. Since the culprit is dead, he won’t pursue the matter.”

In an instant, Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Gou felt ecstatic as they shifted their attention to Yang Kai at the same time, directing grateful expressions at him as if he was their saviour.

“Although I won’t kill you, that doesn’t mean there won’t be any punishments. Take this lesson and learn from your foolish mistakes. If you dare to use your strength as Divine Spirit to oppress the weak again, your end will be the same as Shi Huo’s!” As soon as Zhang Ruo Xi finished speaking, she pushed out her palm at them.

The Blood Gate buzzed again, upon which two beams of red light shot out of it and struck Fan Wu and Cang Gou. Unable to resist these strikes, the two Divine Verenables were sent flying as they coughed up blood mid-air.

Luan Feng was rooted to the spot as her eyelashes fluttered. A moment later, she finally realized that she wasn’t attacked. She was an intelligent woman, so she knew why Fan Wu and Cang Gou were harmed, but not her. It was all because she had saved this Heavens Order’s descendant earlier. At that instant, she was glad she had at least done that much.

On the other hand, Fan Wu and Cang Gou fell to the ground. Although they appeared quite miserable, they dared not utter any complaint. Instead, they heaved a sigh of relief and got to their feet before cupping their fists and bowing, “Many thanks for sparing our lives.”

They understood that since Zhang Ruo Xi had made such a move, it meant that this matter was settled and they were safe, for now.

Zhang Ruo Xi snorted as her pretty face turned slightly red. It seemed that her body was now feeling the burden of borrowing the power from the Blood Gate. Remaining on the spot, she looked into the distance and beckoned, “Uncle Stone, Xiao Xiao, come here!”

The Uncle Stone she was referring to was undoubtedly the Embodiment. They had lived together in the Sealed World Bead for many years, so they were on good terms.

Upon hearing this call, the Embodiment and Xiao Xiao, who were just ten kilometres away, hurriedly ran over and reached Zhang Ruo Xi a moment later.

Zhang Ruo Xi turned to look at Fan Wu without uttering a word. Understanding her hint, Fan Wu immediately removed the seals on the Embodiment and Xiao Xiao, restoring their freedom.

“Uncle Stone, this is for you.” As Zhang Ruo Xi spoke, she flicked Shi Huo’s Source, which she had been holding in her hand all this while, towards the Embodiment. The heart-like thing spun and hovered around the Embodiment’s chest.

“For me?” Embodiment’s gaze brightened. He had seen how Zhang Ruo Xi killed Shi Huo, so he knew what this thing was. This was Shi Huo’s Source. If any suitable person could obtain it, refine it, and inherit its Source Strength, they would become the next Shi Huo.

After a nod, Zhang Ruo Xi drew out her Heavens Order Sword again and pointed it gently at Embodiment as she uttered, “The Stone Spirit Clan and Shi Huo are somewhat related, so your body structure and nature are quite similar to his. Therefore, I believe that a Stone Spirit Clan member like you can inherit Shi Huo’s power.”

The tip of Heavens Order Sword, which was pointed at Embodiment, suddenly shone brightly and carved a strange pattern on his chest. The pattern seemed to have a power of attraction, and with a blow, it pulled Shi Huo’s Source into it, causing it to disappear from everyone’s sight.

The Embodiment grunted as his body started burning with dark flames, and his face instantly contorted in pain.

Zhang Ruo Xi lowered the sword and quickly performed a hand seal with both her hands, upon which, a series of abstruse seals shot into the Embodiment. With every seal penetrating his body, the dark flames would be suppressed significantly. After a quarter of an hour, all the flames finally disappeared.

At the same time, the Embodiment fell silent and sat down cross-legged on the spot, as though he had fallen into the state of enlightenment.

“This Stone Spirit has now become one of the most powerful individuals in the world,” Fan Wu suddenly uttered as he looked at them from nearby.

With a bitter smile, Luan Feng said, “I heard that not only could Heavens Order take away a Divine Spirit’s Source, she could also bequeath them to others to create new Divine Spirits. Now we know this is true.”

Cang Gou appeared envious as he said, “If this Stone Spirit were to try to inherit Shi Huo’s Source on his own, the success rate would only be about ten percent; however, with the help of Heavens Order’s descendant, there are basically no drawbacks. After he refines Shi Huo’s Source, this world will have a new Divine Spirit.”
