“You’re right, the Heaven Grade Cultivation Paradise of the Spirit Lake Palace is probably on par with the Heaven Grade ones in Star Soul Palace, and all Emperor Realm Masters would want to give it a try. If they managed to make a breakthrough during their occupancy, it would be worth it no matter how high the price,” Ye Jing Han approved of the opinion of Yang Kai and she said. “But, there are only thirty Heaven Grade Cultivation Rooms.”

“Thirty rooms... Then those Seniors would have an intense fight over them.” Yang Kai nodded.

Thirty rooms seemed plenty, but it really was not. Emperor Realm Masters weren’t commonly seen, but even if there weren’t a thousand in the Southern Territory, there were at least eight hundred, and only those from Star Soul Palace wouldn’t be interested in the Heaven Grade Cultivation Rooms here. As for the rest, they would all covet a secluded cultivation in those rooms.

Once news about it spread out, thirty rooms wouldn’t be nearly enough!

“That’s those Seniors’ business and it isn’t something the likes of me has to agonize over,” Ye Jing Han pursed her lips and smiled.

“What’s the number of Earth and Mortal Grade Rooms?” Yang Kai asked next.

“It looks like there are 500 Earth Grade Rooms and 3,000 Mortal Grade Rooms...”

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai nodded lightly. The number of rooms looked low and far from enough, but not every person could afford a cultivation session in the Spirit Lake Palace and could only observe those rooms from afar.

The income of Maplewood City would reach an astronomical figure thanks to those rooms, but it would likely be divided between the top Sects and only a little would be left for the city. Despite this, Duan Yuan Shan and the others would quickly get rich.

“It is as you say...” Ye Jing Han’s voice suddenly turned low and she spoke in a mystifying tone, “However, this is only a rumour, but it is said that the Spirit Lake Palace has some additional rooms left for the top Sects, which aren’t open to the public. Disciples of those Sects can use those rooms for free, and they can stay there as long as they want.”

“Huh?” Yang Kai raised his brows, “Is that true?”

Ye Jing Han said, “The source of this information isn’t known, but it seems to be quite reliable; after all, the Spirit Lake Palace was built by those top Sects, so it only makes sense for them to reserve some rooms for themselves.”

“That’s understandable!” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Now, he was also a disciple of Azure Sun Temple and he had an Identity Token in his hands. If the news was reliable, then he could use the token to cultivate in one of those rooms for free.

“In addition, the great Sects arranged a powerful Spirit Array that would lead the World Energy leaking out from the Spirit Lake Palace into Maplewood City, which is why the density of the World Energy in Maplewood City has risen so much.”

“So that’s what happened...” Yang Kai suddenly understood the reason why the density of the World Energy in Maplewood City had risen greatly rather than decreasing. It turned out that it was because an array was leading the World Energy of the Spirit Lake Palace here. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Now, Maplewood City was also much more suitable for cultivation than before. Even if it wasn’t on par with the Spirit Lake Palace, it was still a good fortune for the cultivators residing in Maplewood City.

“Maplewood City will become one of the greatest cities of the Southern Territory in less than two years. I heard that the two great chambers of commerce will also establish branches here.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “The two chambers of commerce wouldn’t miss any chance to make money.”

As they chatted, they quickly reached Spirit Pill Plaza. The shop wasn’t any different from before and there weren’t many customers shopping at the moment. In fact, only the shop-hand was present while the shopkeeper was nowhere to be seen.

Since Kang Si Ran had been transferred, Yang Kai had not visited Spirit Pill Plaza again until now and he couldn’t help sighing inwardly upon seeing it.

After all, Spirit Pill Plaza was the first place he ‘settled’ in Maplewood City.

“Are you... Grandmaster Yang?” A surprised cry reached the ears of Yang Kai and pulled him out of his trance. He raised his head to take a look and saw the shop hand gazing at him excitedly.

“Shop hand, how have you been lately?” Yang Kai greeted him with a smile.

When he had been refining pills in Spirit Pill Plaza, he often contacted this shop hand so, naturally, they weren’t strangers. However, due to various circumstances Yang Kai never actually learned this young lad’s name.

“Good, very good!” The shop-hand said excitedly and incoherently from Yang Kai even remembering his appearance, “Many thanks, Grandmaster Yang, for your concern.”

After he spoke, he quickly ran into the store, shouting, “Grandmaster Yang has come back. Shopkeeper, Grandmaster Yang has come back!”

“Why is he acting like that?” Ye Jing Han looked in confusion at Yang Kai, wondering what was wrong with the shop-hand.

Yang Kai said, “I refined pills in this Spirit Pill Plaza for a couple of months in the past.”

“So that’s the reason.”

“Let’s go in,” Yang Kai gestured to her lightly. He had noticed that after the crazy shouts of the shop-hand, the few customers who were here to make purchases of pills all turned to give him strange gazes, which was why he urged Ye Jing Han to head further inside.

After he walked past the lobby, he ran into a fatty with a gleaming face clad in luxurious clothes on his way to the back of the store. This fat man looked about forty years old and had an impressive belly.

This was obviously the new shopkeeper of Spirit Pill Plaza and he was also a Third-Order Origin King cultivator, the same as Kang Si Ran before his recent breakthrough.

The fatty wiped off the sweat from his forehead and said anxiously, “Where is Grandmaster Yang?”

As his voice fell, he suddenly raised his head and sighted upon Yang Kai. He quickly cupped his fists at him and said, “Greetings Grandmaster Yang, I am the current shopkeeper of Spirit Pill Plaza, Zhou Fu, I apologize sincerely for failing to welcome you personally, please don’t take offense.”

Yang Kai cupped his fists to him and said with a smile, “Shopkeeper Zhou is too polite. It was I who came unannounced.”

As they exchanged greetings, two more people raced out from the back rooms shouting anxiously, “Who is Grandmaster Yang, where is he?”

One of them surveyed the surroundings before his gaze fell upon Yang Kai and he immediately asked, “Are you Grandmaster Yang?”

Yang Kai cast a glance at him. This man had dishevelled hair and sunken, bloodshot eyes, as if he hadn’t rested in a long while. The other man standing next to him was in similar condition.

What’s more, Yang Kai could smell a faint pill fragrance lingering around this pair’s bodies.

Yang Kai quickly realized their occupations and he smiled at them, “I don’t dare to call myself a Grandmaster, but this one is indeed surnamed Yang.”

Upon hearing this, the eyes of the two people shone brightly and they stared at Yang Kai with an ardent gaze. Cupping their fists, they bowed deeply, “Greetings, Grandmaster Yang.”

“Two friends are too polite,” Yang Kai smiled before he turned to Zhou Fu, “Shopkeeper Zhou, can we go inside to have a chat?”

He gestured lightly toward the people in the vicinity. The customers making purchases in the store were all observing them in confusion, making guesses about the identity of Yang Kai and why the members of Spirit Pill Plaza were so respectful to him.

Zhou Fu said awkwardly, “How negligent of me! Grandmaster Yang, please come in.”

“Yes, yes, Grandmaster Yang, please come inside,” the two men behind him quickly made way for Yang Kai respectfully.

“Have the best spirit tea prepared immediately,” as Zhou Fu said so, he kicked the shop-hand observing them, sending the latter scurrying to complete his task.

After a short while, Yang Kai sat down in the backroom with Ye Jing Han standing behind him like a bodyguard, while Zhou Fu and his companions stood before him.

“Friends, please sit,” Yang Kai said and gestured to them lightly.

“No, we don’t have the right to sit in the presence of Grandmaster Yang, we’ll just stand!” Zhou Fu quickly waved his hand in refusal.

“That’s right, that’s right.”

“Kneeling is also fine!” One of the two Alchemists suddenly suggested, drawing light laughter from Ye Jing Han’s lips. She simply couldn’t understand why Yang Kai had so much prestige here.

Yang Kai didn’t force them to sit down anymore and instead asked, “Have you received any instructions from Shopkeeper Kang?”

Zhou Fu’s expression turned austere as he said, “Shopkeeper Kang has contacted us multiple times, inquiring about Grandmaster Yang, but until today none of us had seen Your Excellency, nor could we obtain any information about you. Fortunately, news spread from the Four Seasons Realm about Grandmaster Yang, allowing us to give a confession to Shopkeeper Kang,” Zhou Fu said and chuckled bitterly.

Yang Kai nodded, “Shopkeeper Kang is quite considerate, how is he doing now?”

Zhou Fu explained, “Very good, I heard that he’ll shortly return to Maplewood City.”

Yang Kai’s expression changed and he said, “Is it because of the matter about Violet Source Chamber of Commerce setting up a branch here?”

Zhou Fu said, “Grandmaster Yang, you are indeed well-informed. Violet Source Chamber of Commerce decided to open a branch in Maplewood City and they decided to assign Kang Si Ran as a Manager. He has been conducting business here for many years and has an extensive network of contacts, making it easier to deal with diverse affairs in this city.”

Yang Kai said with a smile, “Brother Kang will finally be rewarded for his hard work.”

In the past, Maplewood City was just an insignificant city, the likes of which could be found anywhere, so Kang Si Ran had been eager to transfer away after reaching the Dao Source Realm. However, the current Maplewood City was on the cusp of becoming a great city, which was why Violet Source Chamber of Commerce was transferring Kang Si Ran back here. They obviously trusted his ability and the latter would surely obtain many benefits and a prominent status as a result.

As a matter of fact, this was really what happened. Kang Si Ran had stayed in this city for so many years and he had a good relationship with the City Lord’s Mansion and the Patriarchs of the various great families, which was why he was a perfect candidate to become a Manager in Maplewood City’s branch.

After they chatted for a while, Yang Kai suddenly changed the topic of discussion and said, “Shopkeeper Zhou, I visited Spirit Pill Plaza today to ask for your help.”

Zhou Fu’s face became rosy and he said in a deep voice, “Grandmaster Yang, what instructions do you have for me? Please feel free to speak. This Zhou will walk through fire and cross oceans for you!”

“Hehe, it’s nothing so grave.” Yang Kai chuckled and waved his hand, “I want to purchase some Facetless Profound Grass, you know of it, don’t you?”

“Facetless Profound Grass?” Shopkeeper Zhou raised his brows and said, “I am indeed familiar with it and our Spirit Pill Plaza has some in stock. If Grandmaster Yang has need of it, he may take all of it as a gift.”

Yang Kai shook his head and said, “The stock in Spirit Pill Plaza is far from enough.”

Zhou Fu said, “How much do you want?”

“The more the better!”

“I’ll send people to collect it from the other shops in the city. Grandmaster Yang will not be disappointed by the results.”

“Many thanks, Shopkeeper Zhou,” Yang Kai said and cupped his fists.

Zhou Fu smiled, “Grandmaster Yang is far too polite. Grandmaster Yang is the saviour of our Spirit Pill Plaza as well as a former member of it, it is only natural that this Zhou fulfils your little request.”
