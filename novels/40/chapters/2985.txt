Yang Kai’s incantation changed again before smacking another palm, “Demon Purification.”

The moment the light flashed, a stream of black Qi whizzed out from Li Jiao’s back and let out a wail as if a ghost possessing Li Jiao had been exorcised.

The black Qi lasted for several breaths before it was completely eliminated. When the Demon Qi was completely eliminated, a flash of joy involuntarily appeared in Li Jiao’s eyes.

He knew his own situation best. He had been plagued by the Demon Qi these days, and even if it didn’t continuously grow, he was unable to get rid of it despite his Third-Order Emperor Realm cultivation.

But now, after Yang Kai had used his mysterious techniques, Li Jiao could clearly feel that the problem that had been plaguing him had been completely resolved. There was no more Demon Qi left in his body; all of it had been expelled, and with the Bloodlust Spell’s restraint, the Demon Essence would no longer affect his heart while his Knowledge Sea would remain completely clear.

“Many thanks, Palace Master Yang!” Li Jiao was extremely grateful.

Just as he finished thanking him, he saw Yang Kai grin widely at him, sending out a hard palm. This palm was definitely not something to expel Demon Qi, because it was quite powerful. The most important thing was that it carried a suppressive force of his Dragon Clan bloodline.

Pitifully Li Jiao, a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, didn’t even have the time to react before directly fainting from the blow.

Afterwards, Yang Kai stretched his hand out towards him before Li Jiao’s figure disappeared from sight.

Zhu Lie, who had been watching on with cold eyes, couldn’t help but have his pupils shrunk. He couldn’t figure out where Yang Kai had put Li Jiao.

Only Zhu Qing knew that Li Jiao should have been thrown into that strange space she had been to before. The World Principles here were about to change, and although the Demon Qi had been purged from Li Jiao’s body, if he didn’t find a place to take shelter, it was inevitable that he would be invaded by the Demon Qi again. Human Imperial City was too far away, and there was no place to hide in Demon Fury City, so that isolated space was the best option.

Thinking of what previously transpired in that space though, Zhu Qing’s cheeks involuntarily flushed.

At this moment, the transformation of the World Principles was extremely obvious. The World Energy seemed to have been infused by something which was no doubt Demon Qi.

Many Demon Kings and Demon Great Generals who had been waiting for this looked excited. This was the aura of their ancestral home. When the Revolving World Principles leaned towards the Demon Realm, their rate of cultivation and speed of recovery was enhanced.

The black puppy also became very excited. Obviously, it liked these World Principles too. It cracked its mouth wide and constantly sucked in the surrounding Demon Qi.

In a short while, the entire world had drastically changed. The surroundings were full of rich Demon Qi, and the world had gone dark. The rich Demon Qi flooded in every direction, giving everyone the impression of entering the Demon Realm.

Although Yang Kai had no idea what the Demon Realm looked like, he reckoned that it shouldn’t look much different from the current Revolving World.

The change in World Principles lasted a total of three days, and in these three days, Demon Fury City’s Masters recovered a lot, not enough to keep up with the appetite of the black puppy, but better than before. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Three days later, Yang Kai took the black puppy to Yin Wind Mountain, but when he came back, there was a frown on his face. Under the Demon Kings and Demon Great Generals’ disappointed gaze, Yang Kai threw the black puppy down, letting it continue to devour their Demon Qi.

“What’s the situation?” Zhu Lie asked, raising his head.

“I still couldn’t see the exit,” Yang Kai shook his head.

Although he climbed a little further than the last time, he still couldn’t find where the exit was. In other words, the black puppy’s current strength was still insufficient for them to leave. He had no choice but to continue making it grow stronger.

Zhu Qing stepped forward and comforted, holding Yang Kai’s hand, “Don’t worry, we will definitely get out someday, it’s just a matter of time, that’s all.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “I’m not worried about anything. Only, this damned place is too depressing. The sooner we leave this place, the sooner I will be at ease.”

Zhu Qing hesitated for a moment before softly asking, “What if we really can’t leave this place?”

Yang Kai squeezed her hand and affectionately replied, “Then we will grow old together here.”

Zhu Qing lowered her head; her face was completely flushed.

“You two, do you think I’m blind?” Zhu Lie coldly snorted, his face extremely unsightly.

He had strictly warned Yang Kai before, but he hadn’t expected him to not take his words seriously.

Yang Kai raised his hand, put his arm around Zhu Qing’s shoulder, and stated provocatively, “You watch over things here, I’m going on a walk with your Elder Sister.”

After having said this, he directly grabbed Zhu Qing and left.

Li Jiao grew anxious and loudly shouted from behind, “Palace Master Yang, please return as soon as possible.”

Without Yang Kai, he would definitely not be able to stand the erosion of the Demon Qi when the World Principles changed again. Although he had no idea what Yang Kai had done to him before, he didn’t notice any signs of Demon Qi erosion when he woke up from his coma.

If he wanted to survive in this place, he could only rely on Yang Kai.

“Where are we going?” Zhu Qing still believed that Yang Kai was taking her out for something, and innocently asked.

“Anywhere as long as there is no one else there.”

His words were too straightforward, so Zhu Qing immediately understood and her heart immediately started beating wildly as her cheeks turned red and hot.

……

One after another, days went by, and in a flash, it had been three months since Yang Kai and his group had come to Demon Fury City.

During these three months, the Demon King and Demon Great Generals of Demon Fury City had been living a life worse than death. They were constantly alternating between recovering and being drained. More often than not, they were forced to line up when just twenty to thirty percent of their strength had recovered.

After three months of this, the cultivations of all the Demon Kings and Demon Great Generals had regressed by one or two Minor Realms.

It was tantamount to having their flesh cut with a blunt knife, even more painful than being killed outright. Sometimes, the Demon Kings simply wanted to fight it out with Yang Kai, whatever the cost might be, but after giving it a thought, a living dog was better than a dead lion. Their ancestors had occupied Demon Fury City for hundreds of thousands of years, they couldn’t allow its inheritance to be severed in their generation. Thinking so, they had no choice but to painstakingly bide their time, waiting to send these gods of misfortune away.

The black puppy still looked the same as ever, only exuding an aura of a Fifth or Sixth-Order Monster Beast, but through Yang Kai’s many experiments, he knew it had become a lot stronger.

The unknown space in its belly was more than a hundred times larger than it was at the beginning, and it could now take Yang Kai far higher up the mountain than before.

During these three months, Yang Kai and Zhu Qing would occasionally go out to tour the mountains and rivers, then return to Demon Fury City after spending a day or two together. Zhu Lie grumbled over this many times, even openly mocking them, but it had no effect on the couple. Zhu Qing had thin skin and would always blush with guilt whenever her little brother accused them, but Yang Kai was completely brazen. No matter what Zhu Lie said, he treated it as nothing but farts.

As for Li Jiao, he was no longer living his life according to his own wishes, because every time the World Principles leaned towards the Demon Realm, he would be knocked out by Yang Kai and only wake when the change was over.

To this day, he still had no idea how exactly Yang Kai helped him avoid the misfortune of being corroded by the Demon Qi. Nonetheless, his gratitude towards him was increasing day by day despite having no choice in the matter.

At this moment, Yang Kai was already rejoicing a little for not letting the black puppy swallow the Demon Kings, because if he had really done that, the black puppy would have never grown to this level in three months.

It was indeed better to keep the goose that lays the egg than to kill it.

The hard days of the Demon Race were finally coming to an end though, because the last time Yang Kai returned from Yin Wind Mountain with the black puppy, he informed the others that he had a vague idea of the location of the exit. As long as the black puppy became just a bit stronger, they should have a chance to leave this place.

All the Demon Race members rejoiced after hearing this piece of news. They had been toiling hard for these three months just for this day, so now that they had seen hope, they naturally tried harder to recover.

The priceless Demon Fruits that they could never bear to use, were all taken out as they spared no effort to recover their energy.

After another change of World Principles, Yang Kai threw Li Jiao out of the Small Sealed World and woke him.

In the square, all the Demon Kings and Demon Great Generals were sitting cross-legged on the ground, blankly looking at Yang Kai, looking weak and exhausted.

Yang Kai curled his lips into a smile and loudly stated, “Humans and Demons have been enemies since ancient times. There is a deep-rooted feud between the two races that can never be resolved. According to reason, I should kill you all and end all troubles.”

Just as he said this, the faces of Demon Race members changed, but they didn’t panic as they could tell that Yang Kai didn’t plan on doing that from his words.

“However, as thanks for your help over these past few months, we finally have hope of leaving this place, so I am willing to spare your lives.”

“Many thanks, Sir!” The Charm Demon shouted out loud, but there was no response from other Demon Race members.

Yang Kai smiled and added, “I hope we will never meet again.”

[Who wants to meet you again!?] Many Demon Kings and Demon Great Generals rained down curses in their hearts!

“Farewell!” Yang Kai smiled before picking up the black puppy and flying towards Yin Wind Mountain.

Zhu Qing, Zhu Lie, and Li Jiao hurriedly followed after him.

“I wish Sir good luck and safe travels!” The Charm Demon vigorously waved her hands; the corners of her eyes were a little moist.

[Finally! Finally, these living calamities are leaving!] The Demon Kings and Demon Great Generals sincerely prayed in their hearts for them to leave this world, watching Yang Kai and the others’ departing backs.

Yang Kai had been to Yin Wind Mountain more than a dozen times now, each time to perform an experiment with the black puppy, each time climbing further than he previously had.

So, he could be considered to be quite familiar with the way and method.

The Cold Demon Qi continuously blew down the mountain from some unknown place, and the higher one climbed, the more terrifying it was.

At the very beginning, everyone was at ease and could resist the Cold Demon Qi with their own strength, but after a thousand metres, it started to become a little strenuous. None would be able to go farther than a thousand metres without the help of the black puppy.

Obviously, the black puppy was familiar with this too, and after a thousand metres, it opened its mouth wide and sucked in the oncoming Cold Demon Qi into its belly.

In a flash, the four felt the pressure on them greatly reduce. Basically, ninety percent of the oncoming Cold Demon Qi was swallowed by the black puppy while the remaining ten percent was scattered about, easily dealt with by Yang Kai and the others.

As they continued to advance forward, the Cold Demon Qi grew more intense, but the black puppy was safe and sound as it devoured everything.

Only after traversing ten thousand metres did a faint frost start to appear on the black puppy’s body. Obviously, the Cold Demon Qi began to have some effect on it.
