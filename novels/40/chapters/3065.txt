Although Yang Kai was constantly resisting and evading their attacks, he was just one person after all, so he appeared battered and helpless. It was as though he would lose his life at any moment upon just one critical attack from the seven Dragons.

Zhu Qing roared and spat out a jet of her scorching flames at the seven Dragons.

Yang Kai and the Dragons turned to look at her. Flabbergasted, the Dragons wondered why Zhu Qing had arrived at this place.

The flame had temporarily gotten Yang Kai out of his predicament, upon which Zhu Qing immediately flew towards him. Apparently, she was ready to fight alongside him and share the burden with him.

The seven Dragons traded glances and came up with a solution instantly.

Two Dragons immediately shot towards Zhu Qing and blocked her way. In an instant, the three Dragons confronted and cast their Dragon Pressure together, causing the space around them to shake and the world to shatter.

“Move!” Zhu Qing growled.

Certainly, the two Dragons couldn’t step aside. One of them uttered, “Zhu Qing, stop destroying your own future! You’re now a Ninth-Order Dragon! If everything goes well, you’ll become the Dragon Clan’s Fifth Elder. Please look at the big picture and place the Dragon Clan first!”

Zhu Qing refuted coldly, “Before a Dragon, I am a woman! I don’t understand what big picture you’re talking about, all I know is that you’re hurting my man!”

The Dragon Clan member bellowed, “Mind your language! He’s just a lowly Human. Stop embarrassing the Dragon Clan!”

The other Dragon hurriedly reminded, “Zhu Qing, have you forgotten what happened years ago? She was as powerful as you are now, but look where she ended up. Do you want to go down the same path?”

Zhu Qing replied nonchalantly, “At that time, I didn’t understand why she was so obstinate, but I do now. Given a second chance, I would have stood on her side rather than against her at that time!”

“You’re so stubborn!”

“You’ll be thrown into the Dragon Grave. Zhu Qing, stop now!”

As they spoke, Fu Ling finally arrived at this place. As a Purple Dragon, she looked elegant and mighty, but upon her arrival, two people immediately scolded her, ““Useless!””

One of them was a Dragon Clan member. The seven Dragons didn’t understand why Fu Ling and the Blue Dragon couldn’t stop Zhu Qing although they had joined forces. Now, it seemed that the Blue Dragon had been injured. Otherwise, Fu Ling wouldn’t have raced after Zhu Qing on her own.

Supposedly, Fu Ling and the Blue Dragon had joined forces, and they had the Dragon Temple’s Blessing, so they should’ve been able to hold Zhu Qing up. However, in reality, they had only managed to hinder Zhu Qing for a short period of time, which forced two of the seven Dragons to come forward to deal with Zhu Qing.

The other person who scolded Fu Ling was Yang Kai, for he had never expected that she couldn’t even complete such a simple task. If she had accurately passed on his word and told Zhu Qing to help the others to defeat their opponents first, they would have been able to gain the upper hand.

However, Zhu Qing had directly arrived at this place, which meant that Fu Ling wasn’t able to complete her task, which was why Yang Kai was displeased with her.

Appearing embarrassed, Fu Ling stopped in mid-air and didn’t know what to do.

“Go over to help now!” One of the Dragons, who was confronting Zhu Qing, growled at Fu Ling.

Upon hearing that, Fu Ling had no choice but to fly towards Yang Kai. Seeing her, the other five Dragons snorted. They had already gained the upper hand by encircling Yang Kai with seven people on their side. Although Zhu Qing’s arrival forced two of them to leave the group to deal with her, they now had Fu Ling with them. Generally, the collective power remained roughly the same.

They had figured out all of Yang Kai’s abilities now. It was impossible for Yang Kai to win this battle, so they should just deal with him slowly by wearing out his confidence and energy until he could no longer use his elusive Space Divine Ability. By then, they would be able to kill or even capture him.

At the thought of this, the Dragons gazed at Yang Kai with a sneer and a sense of mockery. [What thing does he think he is? Where did he get the guts to make a scene on Dragon Island? Doesn’t he understand what place this is? There’s no doubt his end will be miserable!]

“Just choose one.”

While the Dragons were mocking Yang Kai in their hearts, he suddenly turned to look at Fu Ling and said something unfathomable.

The Dragons were stunned. [What does he mean, she has to choose one? What is he talking about?]

A sense of struggle and hesitation flashed across Fu Ling’s eyes. Seeing that, Yang Kai snorted and said coldly, “I’ll kill you if you dare disobey me!”

Her 100-metre figure shuddered when she heard that. Hesitating no further, she opened her mouth and shot a beam of purple light at one of the Dragon Clan members.

The Dragon Clan member had a frame that was as large as Fu Ling’s Dragon Form, so their power and bloodline should be roughly the same, which meant that they were basically there to assist the others. That was why he was focusing on Yang Kai and had never expected that Fu Ling would make a move against him suddenly. Hence, he was struck by the purple light directly, upon which he kept writhing about and roaring.

“Fu Ling, what’s wrong with you!?” One of the Dragon Clan members growled.

What just happened was utterly strange. As a member of the Dragon Clan, why did Fu Ling side with Yang Kai and attack her kin? That was absolutely absurd! Zhu Lie was Zhu Qing’s brother, so it was understandable that he would side with her, but why did Fu Ling go mad and side with them as well? 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Knowing that she was in the wrong, Fu Ling didn’t try to defend herself. She simply transformed her gigantic figure into a beam of purple light and launched herself at her target.

Incensed, her opponent came to his senses and met Fu Ling head-on. In an instant, the two Dragons clashed, sending a shockwave across the sky as they chanted in Dragon Language to cast their own Secret Techniques. After they fell into the sea, they caused a huge splash that could eclipse the sky.

“What have you done to Fu Ling?” Not all of them were fools and a glint flashed across a Dragon Clan member’s eyes as he had figured out something, turning around to glare at Yang Kai.

On the other hand, Yang Kai chuckled and wiped away the blood on his face, which revealed his hideous countenance as he sneered, “Take a guess!”

The Dragon Clan member’s expression darkened as he realized that things were getting out of their control. Initially, they were dealing with Yang Kai with seven people on their side, which rendered him powerless to continue making a scene, and it was only a matter of time before they could suppress the battle. However, Zhu Qing’s arrival had forced two of them to leave the group, and now that Fu Ling had sided with Yang Kai, one more of them had to leave to deal with her as well.

Now, there were only four of them left, which was about half their original number. That was why they were slightly anxious. They had experienced Yang Kai’s elusive Space Divine Ability first hand. With the advantage of having more people on their side, they were able to intercept Yang Kai and make sure he couldn’t escape. However, with only four of them left, their plan and cooperation would be flawed now.

If Yang Kai could find a way to break their Blessing Technique, the Dragon Clan would be bound to lose the fight. No Dragon Clan member could ever accept this kind of humiliation.

Growing cautious, they didn’t dare to make a rash move again. As they traded glances, it was apparent that they were having a secret chat.

However, Yang Kai didn’t give them a chance. With his 80-metre-long figure, he appeared overbearing. As the four Dragons stared at him with caution, he launched himself at them, continuing their great melee.

…..

On a deserted island where World Energy was abundant, Fu Chi, whose face was completely pale, sat cross-legged and circulated his Dragon Essence. He had attached his arms, which had been torn off by Yang Kai, back on his body already, but although his vitality and restorative abilities were strong, being a member of the Dragon Clan, it would still take him one to two years to restore his strength to its peak.

It wasn’t certain if it was because he was in pain or something else, but with a contorting face, he was trying to heal himself while cursing at someone through gritted teeth, “That bitch! Slut! Whore!”

Although the entire Dragon Clan had been humiliated on this day, the humiliation that had been inflicted upon Fu Chi was a thousand times more intense than that on his fellow clansmen.

His bride had been snatched from him on his wedding day, and he had been subdued by his love rival. That Human even tore off both his arms. If it weren’t for the Great Elder rescuing him at the end, he would have been killed. Judging from how ruthless and resolute that Human appeared, Fu Chi was certain Yang Kai would not have hesitated to do it.

This kind of humiliation was like a mountain that pressed against Fu Chi’s chest, making it hard for him to breathe.

He could imagine that his reputation would be completely ruined after this day. In the future, he would be too embarrassed to meet his fellow clansmen. By just thinking about the expressions he would see on their faces, he felt utterly enraged.

As his blood was boiling, he suddenly spat out a mouthful of Dragon Blood, which dyed the ground in front of him.

At that moment, images of a man and a woman kept flashing across his mind. Feeling resentful of Yang Kai and Zhu Qing, he swore that he would make them experience pain and humiliation a hundred times more intense. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to soothe the rage in his chest. As for who he would make suffer the most, he hated Zhu Qing more than Yang Kai so she would be the greatest victim.

While Fu Chi was deep in such thoughts, he suddenly noticed something and looked up, upon which his gaze turned ferocious.

Someone was standing quietly in the sky nearby, but he was a Dragonborn rather than a Human.

Fu Chi could sense the mixed Dragon Blood aura wafting from this person’s body. He was most familiar with this kind of aura because those hybrids from Half-Dragon City all exuded this kind of revolting aura.

All Dragon Clan members loathed this sort of aura and instinctively felt repulsed by it. Fu Chi was no exception.

“Scram!” Fu Chi growled with a cold expression.

He had suffered an unbearable humiliation on this day, which was why he fled to this island to recuperate, but he never expected that a Dragonborn would stalk him here and even look down on him from nearby.

He had already been humiliated by a lowly Human, so was this hybrid going to do the same?

In normal times, Fu Chi would have killed him on the spot; however, he was in the process of healing himself right now and wasn’t in the mood to deal with this hybrid.

He thought that his growl would terrify this hybrid and send him running for his life. In fact, any hybrid from Half-Dragon City would never attempt to disobey a Pureblood Dragon. It had nothing to do with their strength, it was just inherent inferiority they had before the Dragon Clan.

The division of Dragon Veins was rigid. The difference between Pureblood Dragon Veins and Half-Dragon bloodlines was like the difference between the Heavens and Earth.

However, what shocked Fu Chi was that his growl didn’t elicit any expression from the hybrid. Instead, the hybrid just stared at him quietly with an expression that was as calm as a still lake.

Infuriated, Fu Chi decided to vent his anger on this hybrid and lashed out coldly, “You must court death!”

Upon finishing his words, he pushed his Dragon Pressure and engulfed Li Jiao in it.
