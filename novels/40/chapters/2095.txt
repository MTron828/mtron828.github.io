Chapter 2095, Re-growing a Severed Limb

All of their guesses were basically the same. However, never in their wildest dreams would they believe that the Wood Spirit had a part to play in this matter. If not for the Wood Spirit quietly anchoring itself in Ning Yuan Cheng’s body, Han Leng would never have been ambushed.

With Yang Kai’s level of strength, he would not be able to obtain any advantage if he were to fight against Han Leng, who was at the Second-Order Dao Source Realm and hailed from a powerful sect.

A plethora of expressions flashed through everyone’s faces as they secretly felt envious and shocked at Yang Kai’s luck.

“Little Brat, hand that bottle of Spirit Pills and that ship artifact over to me right now!” All of a sudden, the middle-aged man extended his hand in an overbearing fashion at Yang Kai, “Those items belong to my Flying Saint Palace, you ought to return them to their rightful owners!”

“Those words don’t sound reasonable, sir.”

Before Yang Kai could reply, Hua Qing Si suddenly interjected with a ridiculing laugh. “For ownerless items, finders keepers. Since this little brother managed to obtain these items by luck, then it is also his destiny to find them. Do you not care about your dignity by asking him to return them like that?”

After finishing her sentence, she turned to look at Yang Kai. “Little brother, don’t listen to him.”

Little brother...

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched at the way she had addressed him, while a look of discomfort appeared on his face.

“Do you really think that this king is afraid of you, cheap slut?” After being ridiculed by Hua Qing Si time and time again, the middle-aged man’s belly was already filled with anger. At this moment, he could no longer endure it, cursing out loud at her.

“A useless man scolding other people is truly an ugly sight to behold, tsk tsk...” The ridiculing look on Hua Qing Si’s face grew even more contemptuous.

“You...” The middle-aged man’s anger skyrocketed. If not for the oath he had made with his Heart Demon, he might have already started a fight with Hua Qing Si to keep his face.

Hua Qing Si continued to provoke him, “What narrow mindedness. Little brother, would it be possible for you to give this elder sister a Blood Burning Source Returning Pill?”

“Sure!” Yang Kai nodded his head. He had taken out the bottle of Spirit Pills for two reasons. First, he wanted to use this opportunity to try to clear his name and erase that middle-aged man’s suspicions towards him, and secondly, he wanted to distribute it to everyone.

After displaying the Spirit Array, everyone’s fate was tied together, so it was useless to act solely for personal benefits.

“There’s enough for everyone,” Yang Kai said, all while giving everyone a Blood Burning Source Restoring Pill. Only the middle-aged man did not receive anything!

Being a higher-up of the Flying Saint Palace, no one would believe that he didn’t have such a Spirit Pill with him. Since he treated the Spirit Pills so importantly and had no intention of sharing them, Yang Kai was not so stupid as to give him a Spirit Pill.

“You sure are magnanimous, Little Brother. You’re looking really pleasing to this elder sister’s eyes,” Keeping the Blood Burning Source Restoring Pill, Hua Qing Si’s beautiful eyes gleamed with an alluring splendour as she said those words. With a giggle, she looked towards Yang Kai, her peach-like eyes shining with a soul-stirring gleam. As her red lips wriggled, they shone with a gem-like lustre. “Since you’ve given me a Spirit Pill, this Elder Sister will make sure to protect you. If anyone wants to touch you, they have to first go past this elder sister!”

After saying those words, she intentionally swept her gaze towards the middle-aged man, a look that was filled with provocation!

Yang Kai grinned and replied, “Then I’ll have to thank you, Elder Sister!”

Hua Qing Si could not help but to toss some coquettish glances at him after seeing how collaborative he was. Yang Kai responded with a look as though he had been charmed by her. This caused Duan Yuan Shan and the others to feel extremely uncomfortable, resulting in them cursing the two. [Why didn’t such amazing things happen to me, too?]

“You two sure are brave!” The middle-aged man was so angry, steam could be seen rising from his head. With a chilling voice, he added, “This matter isn’t over.”

“Elder sister, he’s threatening me!” Yang Kai immediately called for help.

Hua Qing Si rolled her beautiful eyes and replied in an unconcerned manner. “He has yet to take any action. What’s there to be afraid of? You better not be too gutless, Little Brother!”

“Can... you all please quieten down a bit? It’s extremely distracting to my concentration.”

All of a sudden, Qin Yu, who was focusing all of her efforts on repairing the seal, spoke up with an extremely annoyed look on her face, while simultaneously shooting fierce glares at the few raucous people.

After hearing her words, everyone instantly shut up. Nevertheless, everyone could feel the rather weird atmosphere.

The seven people that formed this Spirit Array weren’t united in heart, foretelling that this matter wouldn’t go smoothly.

For a period of time, deathly silence filled the interior of the mine, with the only noises coming from the continuous whistles and roars from the surrounding Demon Qi and demonic creatures.

Qin Yu continued to repair the seal in silence.

Not long after, a frown suddenly appeared on Duan Yuan Shan’s face as he roared out, “There’s something coming!”

There wasn’t any look of surprise appearing on the faces of the middle-aged man and Hua Qing Si. Clearly, they had discovered it before Duan Yuan Shan. This was also the case for Yang Kai. With his Divine Sense being not one bit inferior to a Third-Order Dao Source Realm master, he had naturally discovered it before Duan Yuan Shan. In fact, he was even able to faintly sense some information that was not privy to the rest.

On the contrary, the faces of the few First-Order Dao Source Realm masters turned solemn upon hearing his words.

*Whoosh whoosh....*

Human and beast figures started to reveal themselves within the swirling Demon Qi. Clearly, they were demonized creatures.

Having spent a period of time within the mine, which was the source of the Demon Qi, it was naturally impossible for the group to not worry about the demonic creatures present.

After gathering together, they proceeded to launch all-out attacks without regard for their lives.

Nevertheless, having travelled all the way here, the seven people were much more proficient in operating the Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array than before. Under their combined strength, they focused strictly on protecting the area of the seal, all while not sparing a single demonic creature that dared to approach them.

After a while, piles made from the corpses of innumerable demonic creatures appeared before the group, with the resulting bloody smell assailing everyone’s noses.

Although they managed to achieve remarkable results, everyone had a feeling of unease creep into their hearts. As a result of suppressing the origin of the Demon Qi, all while needing to fight against the onslaught of demonic creatures, the consumption rate of their Source Qi had increased by 30%.

They had yet to spend a stick of incense’s worth of time since arriving here, yet they had already consumed the greater half of the Source Qi within their bodies.

At this rate, it wouldn’t take too long before they would exhaust all of their Source Qi. When that happened, they would need to consume that Blood Burning Source Restoring Pill.

“Roar...”

All of a sudden, a furious roar rang out from a certain location. In the next moment, a dazzling burst of radiance surfaced over there, transforming into an astonishing giant axe that cleaved downwards from the air.

Before the giant axe had truly chopped down, everyone felt a surging pressure descending from the sky, causing the faces of the few First-Order Dao Source Realm masters to turn pale.

Even the expressions of the two Third-Order Dao Source Realm masters, the middle-aged man and Hua Qin Si, suddenly turned solemn.

“Giant Spirit Axe?” Duan Yuan Shan exclaimed, as though he had recognized that artifact. With a roar, he rapidly formed seals with his hands.

The Black Tortoise projection raised its head and roared, before lifting up its gigantic foreleg to meet the incoming giant axe.

*Bang...*

This time around, the ever so mighty and invincible Black Tortoise’s palm was unexpectedly only able to block the incoming giant axe. In fact, a giant gash appeared on its palm, looking dangerously close to being chopped off.

Duan Yuan Shan’s expression changed as he realized that he had underestimated the might of that Giant Spirit Axe, causing him to hastily increase the strength of the Spirit Array.

However, right at this moment, a figure appeared in a flash, as a person with jet-black abstruse eyes had appeared in a location not far away from the group in a spectre-like manner. Although he did not use any artifact, he waved his fists about, Demon Qi swirling around them as he sent a fierce punch forward.

“In your dreams!” With a furious roar, Duan Yuan Shan’s hand seal formation speed increased by a few notches. In return, the Black Tortoise projection opened its big mouth, before biting down on that figure.

Just like a house, its gigantic mouth devoured that person whole.

However, before people could feel any delight, the Black Tortoise’s giant mouth unexpectedly started to swell and shrink, as though some kind of berserk energies were erupting from within. In the next moment, with a bang, the devoured figure rushed out, and with a flash, retreated away. Reappearing right beside the Giant Spirit Axe wielding demon, it continued to let out roars from its mouth.

“Brother Cheng, Brother Zhou...” Duan Yuan Shan shot a complicated look at the two demons that had suddenly appeared, before letting out a sigh.“It has been three years. I never expected that you two would actually become like this in our next meeting.”

From his sighing expression, it was clear that he recognized the two people.

Qin Zhao Yang’s expression had also sunk as he quickly said, “They are the two City Lords of Forest City!”

“Forest City!” Yang Kai repeated those words, before sighing too. “From the looks of it, Forest City has already fallen.”

Previously, Old Swindler had said that he had come from Forest City to ask for reinforcements from Maplewood City. Now, since the two City Lords of Forest City had appeared before them, and had both turned into demons, anyone could imagine the situation at Forest City!

Although Forest City was smaller than Maplewood City, these two City Lords were both First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators. Strengthened by Demon Qi, most First-Order Dao Source Realms were truly no match for them. This explained the powerful attacks they were able to unleash.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai roared out, “If they are here, that Jiang Tai Sheng must also be here! Everyone, please pay attention.”

“They’re just a few trivial First-Order Dao Source Realm demons, that’s all! Is there anything to be afraid of? Take a look at how this king deals with them.” With his belly already filled with anger, the middle-aged man was worrying about how to vent his anger. Therefore, it was natural for him to find a good place for him to blow all of his anger off.

He was interested in showing off his strength. After saying those words, a short spear about a foot long suddenly appeared in his hand, before Source Qi surged into it.

“Pay attention to conserve your Source Qi!” Seeing him about to take action, Duan Yuan Shan immediately let out a reminder.

Nevertheless, it was a pity that he was too late. The short spear radiated with a weak brilliance. With a flash it disappeared from his hand, creating a shockwave in the process.

Not far away, appearing to sense something, the demonized City Lord Cheng twisted his body.

In the next instant, a blood mist erupted from his shoulder, while the connected arm blew apart, revealing jet-black muscles and white body, an exceedingly striking sight for one to see.

As pain set in, the demonized City Lord Cheng roared out loudly, its roars seemingly transforming into invisible shockwaves that shook everyone’s Knowledge Seas. Fortunately, as the cultivation realms of everyone present here weren’t low, coupled with the protection of the Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array, they only needed to spend some energy to suppress the tremors.

“It isn’t dead yet?” The middle-aged man was extremely surprised.

His short spear was a Mid-Rank Dao Source Grade artifact, and possessed incomparably powerful might. Originally, he had assumed that it would only take a flick of his hand to deal with a demon that had lost its consciousness. However, he never expected that it would actually shift its body and vitals in time, resulting in it only losing an arm.

“Looks like their combat abilities have increased by quite a bit after losing their consciousness.” Yang Kai said pensively. Even he could feel the danger behind the strike the middle-aged man had launched, and it clearly wasn’t easy to evade it at all.

Hearing his words, Hua Qing Si nodded her head in agreement.

Right at this moment, a shocking spectacle appeared before everyone.

Demon Qi started to churn at the stump of the demonised City Lord Chen. It proceeded to merge together with the wound. In the next instant, right before everyone’s eyes, the wound started to squirm, before rapidly growing out.

Before ten breaths were up, it had actually regrown its severed limb!
