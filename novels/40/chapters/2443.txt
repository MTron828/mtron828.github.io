“Senior Brother Zhong… what are you doing?” Even until this moment, Yu Ying hadn’t realized what was happening and turned to Zhong Zhen Yong in amazement; she had no idea why he suddenly attacked Yang Kai.

After all, Zhong Zhen Yong’s attitude toward Yang Kai had been pretty good along the way. He had been chatting and laughing with him the whole time, so why did Zhong Zhen Yong suddenly turn hostile after coming here? Yu Ying wasn’t able to figure it out.

“Yes, Senior Brother Zhong, what are you doing?” Yang Kai coldly looked at Zhong Zhen Yong and asked with a gloomy look on his face, “How has this Feng offended you that you actually want to assassinate me?”

“This Feng is it?” Zhong Zhen Yong raised his brow and broke into laughter before he shouted, “Brother Feng, let this Zhong ask you a question. If your answer is satisfactory, this Zhong will apologize for everything. If it’s not… heh heh…”

Yang Kai slowly squinted his eyes as he replied, “Senior Brother Zhong, why don’t you ask then?”

Zhong Zhen Yong asked with a grim look on his face, “Brother Feng, which Sect in the Grand Desolation Star Field do you belong to? How did you come to meet Junior Brother Ying?”

Yang Kai was lost in thought after hearing this.

Zhong Zhen Yong had been paying close attention to the change in Yang Kai’s expression, not daring to miss even the slightest change. The nearby Yu Ying looked between the two as well. No matter how stupid she was, she finally realized that something was wrong and she couldn’t help but furrow her dark brow, silently circulating her Source Qi while vigilantly staring at Yang Kai.

After a short while, Yang Kai raised his eyes as he finally responded, staring at Zheng Zhen Yong, “Senior Brother Zhong, these are… two questions? You are breaking your word.”

Zhong Zhen Yong was stunned before he snapped back, “Whether it’s one or two, just answer.”

Yang Kai pursed his lips into a smile as he asked, thoughtfully staring at Zhong Zhen Yong, “Senior Brother Zhong seems to know something!”

Since he already launched a sneak attack, it was obvious this Zhong Zhen Yong knew something and probably realized from the start that Yang Kai had been impersonating Feng De.

“Senior Brother Zhong, what is happening here?” Yu Ying asked, with an unsightly look on her face.

Zhong Zhen Yong let out a cold snort as he explained, pointing at Yang Kai, “Junior Sister Yu, this ‘Feng De’, who had been following you all the while, is a fake.”

“A fake!?” Yu Ying was stunned as she looked at Yang Kai in shock.

“The real Feng De is already dead!”

“Dead!?” Yu Ying was confused as she muttered to herself in disbelief, “How is that possible?”

If Feng De was already dead, how did this guy know so much about her Senior Brother Yin? What was the relationship between this guy and Senior Brother Yin? Did he pretend to be Feng De to approach Senior Brother Yin? Recalling that she had been totally defenceless with Yang Kai without even being aware of his true intentions, Yu Ying couldn’t help but shudder.

“The real Feng De died in the Starlight Corridor. Junior Brother Yin saw it with his own eyes, so this is a fact. As for the person in front of you, he has some grudges with Junior Brother Yin,” Zhong Zhen Yong sneered as he mockingly looked at Yang Kai, “Am I right, Brother Yang?”

A heavy emphasis on the ‘Brother Yang’.

Yang Kai raised his brow as he asked in surprise, “Oh? Since you know everything down to my name, it seems that Yin Le Sheng has been in contact with you?”

While speaking, his eyes lit up as he glanced towards the strange dark red Star.

Although Zhong Zhen Yong didn’t mention where Yin Le Sheng was now, Yang Kai was ninety percent certain that he was on this Star. Otherwise, Zhong Zhen Yong would not have been able to contact Yin Le Shen and ask about him at all.

“Good,” Zhong Zhen Yong didn’t have any intention of denying it, “I indeed obtained all this information from Junior Brother Yin. No matter what kind of grievance there is between you and Junior Brother Yin, you will not have a chance to report it.”

While he was speaking, a hideous and greedy look appeared on Zhong Zhen Yong’s face, like he was hungry for a pound of Yang Kai flesh.

“Who exactly are you? Why did you lie to me!?” Yu Ying became furious. Her pretty eyes were burning with fury as she bit her lips in anger, glaring at Yang Kai, her face laced with murderous intent.

Yang Kai glanced at her and stated in a cold voice, “What an ungrateful and ruthless woman. This Young Master saved your life and now you dare to show murderous intent toward me? Even shamelessness should have a limit!”

Yu Ying tenderly shouted, “So what!? Since you dared to lie to me, you deserve to die!” She turned around and said to Zhong Zhen Yong, “Senior Brother Zhong, this guy has a complete Star Source. If you can obtain it, it will be of great benefit to Senior Brother.”

Zhong Zhen Yong licked his lips as he excitedly stated, “I’m well aware of this.”

In the Netherworld Sect, although he believed that his current strength wasn’t much worse than Yin Le Sheng, based on Yin Le Sheng’s terrifying cultivation speed, it wouldn’t be long before he would be surpassed. And the biggest source of Yin Le Sheng’s rapid progress was his status as a Star Master and the fact that he had a complete Star Source.

This was an opportunity that no cultivator could get even after praying day and night for!

But now, another cultivator with a complete Star Source was right before him. This kind of Star Source was completely different from the Shattered Star Sea’s Shattered Sources. If Zhong Zhen Yong could obtain Yang Kai’s Star Source, the benefits would be simply unimaginable. With it, he wouldn’t need to worry about being surpassed by Yin Le Sheng. Both would have a complete Star Source and the rest would come down to hard work and persistence. And in those regards, Zhong Zhen Yong was confident that he wouldn’t lose to anyone.

Yang Kai suddenly asked, “Is Yin Le Sheng really on that Star?”

Zhong Zhen Yong rebuked with a cold snort, “You are about to die, what’s the point in asking?”

Yang Kai grinned and stated, “Since I’ve found Yin Le Sheng, there is no need to keep you all alive!”

Zhong Zhen Yong was startled before he furiously roared, “Little brat, you are really insane! You are the first one to say something like this to this Zhong! I will send you to hell with this Netherworld Purgatory Banner!”

Saying so, he suddenly stretched his hand out and summoned a black banner. A burst of cries and howls immediately came from the black banner and gusts of dark and sinister winds that carried endless coldness swept out.

When the Netherworld Purgatory Banner spread open, even richer Yin Qi billowed towards Yang Kai, making him feel as if he was being dragged into the real Netherworld.

Yu Ying, seeing Zhong Zhen Yong resorting straight to his trump card, had a distinct change in her expression and hastily retreated, lest she was also caught up in this fight.

“An interesting artifact! This should be perfect for Gui Zu,” when Yang Kai caught sight of the Netherworld Purgatory Banner, his eyes immediately lit up. This artifact was similar to Gui Zu’s Ten Thousand Soul Banner. Both artifacts should have the same origin, but the grade of the Netherworld Purgatory Banner was obviously much higher than Gui Zu’s Ten Thousand Soul Banner.

Yang Kai could even feel faint Emperor Pressure emanating from it.

In other words, this artifact should have been personally refined by an Emperor Realm Master and was currently a Pseudo-Emperor Artifact, yet to fully evolve into a genuine Emperor Artifact. However, as long as Zhong Zhen Yong advanced to the Emperor Realm and used his Emperor Aura to nourish this Netherworld Purgatory Banner, that upgrade would happen sooner or later.

Worthy of one of the top three disciples of a top Sect! Zhong Zhen Yong took out something extraordinary right from the start.

The never-ending cries and howls were like devil’s whispers, filled with mystifying powers that could affect the mind of any hostile cultivator. Judging by how aggressive Zhong Zhen Yong was, it was quite apparent that he wanted to finish Yang Kai in one move, not giving him a chance to fight back.

A complete Star Source was too attractive to him!

Yang Kai was ready to take the challenge with a serious look on his face, lifting his hands and quickly forming a series of profound seals.

After a few complicated movements, an inexplicable force suddenly spread towards the surroundings and a mysterious Principal Strength started to diffuse about.

Zhong Zhen Yong’s eyes bulged as he suddenly had a bad feeling. At that moment, it seemed like his actions and even his thoughts were slowing down, everything around him coming to a halt.

The only one that wasn’t still was the guy who pretended to be Feng De.

[What Divine Ability is this!?] Zhong Zhen Yong’s face drastically changed as his heart was gripped by a chill.

Although Yang Kai’s seals hadn’t been finished yet, Zhong Zhen Yong already had warning bells ringing in his mind. [This boy surnamed Yang isn’t someone that should be provoked!]

From somewhere unknown, a whisper rang in his ears, shaking his Soul.

“Time Flows on Infinitely, Like a Mighty Stream, Like an Unending Dream!”

An unprecedented sense of crisis suddenly flooded his mind, and at the critical moment, Zhong Zhen Yong bit his tongue and spewed out a mouthful of Blood Essence.

Along the spurting of his Blood Essence, the strange stillness around him was finally broken and everything returned to normal, but when he looked up, an enormous seal was already right before him, leaving him no room to escape.

Hong… RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

A thud suddenly rang out, stunning Zhong Zhen Yong on the spot.

He didn’t feel a strong impact like he had imagined, nor did he notice any injuries on his person; however, he was shocked to find that a strange energy was now invading his body, causing his vitality and lifespan to pass at an incredible speed. In the blink of an eye, it seemed as if hundreds or even thousands of years had elapsed for him.

“Senior Brother Zhong!” Yu Ying couldn’t help but scream as her eyes widened in incredulity, the scene before her absolutely terrifying to behold.

Zhong Zhen Yong seemed to have realized something too and he slightly raised his old and dried hands, putting them right before his eyes before asking in a trembling voice, “What… what the hell… did you do to me?”

Yang Kai coldly glared at him before raising his hand and sending out a Moon Blade at him.

Had Zhong Zhen Yong been at his peak, he might have been able to avoid this blow, but at this moment, over ninety percent of his vitality had been drained. He was now completely powerless to react.

The pitch-black Moon Blade struck Zhong Zhen Yong and silently sliced him in two.

Yu Ying immediately turned pale.

Dead! Her Senior Brother Zhong Zhen Yong had actually died just like that!

Senior Brother Zhong was ranked amongst the top three in her Sect and could be regarded as an outstanding genius in the Eastern Territory or even the entire Star Boundary, but he had been killed by a cultivator in the same realm effortlessly!

If this kind of thing hadn’t happened right under her nose, Yu Ying would have never believed it.

But the facts were right before her eyes and she couldn’t doubt them.

It was only now that she finally realized that Yang Kai had hidden his strength throughout their journey. Previously, when he spurted blood while fighting against the Brahma Holy Land disciples, he was undoubtedly just acting! It was simply laughable that she had scorned him earlier for not being Zhang Hao’s opponent.
