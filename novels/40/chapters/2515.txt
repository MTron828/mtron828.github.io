No doubt, it could be described as ‘crushing’ if someone could win within just three moves in a match between two cultivators in the same realm.

“Since then, this little girl has come to the Rising Dragon Arena to fight everyday. No one could stand against her for more than a cup of tea’s worth of time. With her ferocious aura and brutality, everyone began calling her Asura Girl.”

“I’m surprised that this little girl is so powerful.” The first man’s eyes lit up as he exclaimed again and again, watching the arena with great interest.

“Asura Girl is really good, but Gu Shan is not bad either. I still think Gu Shan will win.” The previous Gu Shan’s fan insisted with an unwavering gleam in his eyes.

The third person sneered, “Gu Shan is indeed strong. He has a solid foundation, his Source Qi is vigorous, but he is definitely no match for Asura Girl.”

“Why do you say that?”

“Yeah, I think this friend is too subjective. Looking at the situation now, it is obvious that Gu Shan has an upper hand against her, he is no less brutal than that little girl.”

The third person glanced at the arena leisurely, and replied faintly, “I definitely have my own reason for saying that.”

“What’s your reason? Let’s hear about it.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Gu Shan’s strength has reached its limit. Unless he breaks through to the Emperor Realm, he won’t be able to improve any more in his life. But Asura Girl is different. She has an astounding cultivation, but it seems like she rarely fought before. However, she is constantly improving through each battle, and she is a lot more powerful than she was twenty days ago. Didn’t you guys notice that in the beginning of their battle, Asura Girl was put at a disadvantage, but now, she’s already capable of finding opportunities while defending, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack? If I’m not mistaken, she will continue to grow rapidly in this battle and I’m afraid it won’t be too long before she surpasses Gu Shan and takes him down.”

After listening to his analysis, the other two people thought about it carefully and found that he was right. They could not help praising him, “You have a point. It looks like Gu Shan really might not be able to defeat her.”

“Where did this little girl come from? She seems to be only in her early twenties. Could she have cultivated some Secret Technique that froze her age?”

“Humph, although the aura of this girl is ferocious, she still has the air of a child. It is obvious she is still young.”

“This friend seems to know this Asura Girl very well. Do you observe her a lot?”

The corner of the person’s mouth twitched, “Yes, because… the opponent of her first battle was me!”

“Ah?” The other two people gaped at him in shock. They did not expect that he was the cultivator who spat blood and fainted after being beaten by Asura Girl in three moves. The atmosphere of their conversation instantly turned awkward.

Around the stage, numerous audience members were commenting about this Asura Girl, wondering which Sect she hailed from. Nevertheless, they couldn’t find out as the way she fought was strange and unpredictable.

Furthermore, she did not use any artifacts at all, so people could not guess her identity from them.

This subtle sense of mystery intensified their interest in her.

Yang Kai looked at the arena indifferently, a weird feeling nagging at him.

He could not believe that Zhang Ruo Xi was actually participating in arena fights, and even had a renowned name that scared the cultivators in Purple Mountain City.

His impression of Zhang Ruo Xi was completely different from the little girl that he saw in the arena now.

He suddenly felt like he had raised a dormant beast in the past few years. It usually behaved very well in its cage, but once it was released, it could set off a reign of terror.

Meanwhile, the arena fight was heating up.

Although the previous cultivator lost miserably to Zhang Ruo Xi in the first battle due to his weak foundation, he had a keen eye for observation.

Perhaps, he had closely observed Zhang Ruo Xi for the past twenty days in endurance of his humiliation and clearly witnessed her terrifying growth.

The battle between Gu Shan and Asura Girl progressed from Gu Shan being at an absolute advantage in the beginning to an equally matched battle, then Gu Fang fell into a disadvantage. Gu Shan’s shift from an offensive stance to a defensive stance was obvious.

Neither of the pair used artifacts. Zhang Ruo Xi in fact did not have her own offensive artifact, only the Pink Clouds Phoenix Robe that she always wore. However, she did not activate the defensive power of the Emperor Artifact, so from Gu Shan’s perspective, since he was already a famous figure in Purple Mountain City, it would be embarrassing for him to summon his artifact to fight a little girl who had not summoned hers.

Various Secret Techniques collided with each other, and the light barrier rippled endlessly from each collision.

Compared to Gu Shan’s firm and steady tactics, Zhang Ruo Xi’s movements were flexible and agile. Her fighting style was unique and peculiar. It also seemed that she possessed an exceedingly keen fighting instinct. Yang Kai had never seen or even heard of those various Secret Techniques that performed so outstandingly in her hands and he had no idea when or where she learned them.

The bloody red radiance on Gu Shan’s body was quivering constantly and gradually dimmed, even his aura was fluctuating unstably.

[How strong!] Gu Shan shivered in his heart. Although he had long heard about this little girl who brought torment to the cultivators in Purple Mountain City, he realized now that he had still underestimated her.

Her growth in the battle had also deeply horrified him.

It only took a short time for her to turn the tide of battle; from a total disadvantage to taking control of the flow. Perhaps with a little more time, she would eventually win the match.

Seeing that the bloody red luminance of his body was about to shatter completely, Gu Shan gritted his teeth, took a step back, and opened his hand. A tiger head war hammer abruptly appeared in his grip as he bellowed, “Little girl, summon your artifact. If you don’t, you won’t stand a chance.”

He looked determined, obviously preparing to fight to the death.

Although he had no grudges against Zhang Ruo Xi, he had been fighting in Purple Mountain City all year round and gained a renowned reputation, being spoken of as the top cultivator below the Emperor Realm. If he was defeated by a weak little girl, how could he still have the dignity to stay here?

He had no choice but to pull out his ace, his victory-securing move.

However, he still kindly persuaded Zhang Ruo Xi to summon her artifact so that they could have a fair fight.

Surprisingly, Zhang Ruo Xi shook her head slowly, replying, “I don’t have an artifact!”

“What?” Gu Shan glared at her and burst into rage, “There should be a bottom line for you to look down on others!”

He thought that he was being despised by Zhang Ruo Xi as how could a cultivator not have his or her own artifact? Given that Zhang Ruo Xi was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator with this level of strength, it was impossible that she did not possess any artifact.

He did not know that Zhang Ruo Xi was actually telling the truth.

This little girl from the Zhang Family had her strength improve too quickly, so as much as Yang Kai wanted to give her an artifact, they had yet to find one that was suitable for her and could keep up with the growth of her strength. The problem with a low-level artifact was that it could not catch up with her cultivation speed, while for the high-level artifact, she would be unable to refine it.

Furthermore, Zhang Ruo Xi had always been cultivating safely in the Small Sealed World, so there was no need for her to use any artifacts.

As a result, she had only the Pink Clouds Phoenix Robe.

However, it was humiliating for Gu Shan, seeing that his opponent was going to fight him with her bare hands despite him already summoning his artifact.

Gu Shan fumed in rage, “Don’t complain that I didn’t give you a chance. Since you are so arrogant, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

Zhang Ruo Xi pursed her red lips. She did not intend to explain anything and decided to say nothing, her face turning solemn as she looked like she was ready to go all out at any time.

After a loud roar, Gu Shan’s body suddenly expanded, turning into a giant of a man as he madly surged his Source Qi, and poured it into the tiger head war hammer.

The roar of a tiger caused the whole arena to tremble, as if the king of the jungle leaped out of a deep forest, swearing to defend his territory until its death.

“Are you still not summoning your artifact!?” Gu Shan yelled again while surging more power into his artifact.

Again, Zhang Ruo Xi shook her head slowly.

“You asked for this!” Gu Shan was maddened. He let out a breath and his bulging body shrunk down again as all his power was poured into the war hammer. The wind and clouds collided in the sky forming a storm, and following a blinding light which exploded in the arena, a gigantic tiger as vivid as a real beast, carrying a Heaven-destroying and Earth-shattering aura, pounced straight at Zhang Ruo Xi.

Zhang Ruo Xi seemed to be aware of the ferocity of this skill as her face turned solemn. She joined her palms together in a strange fashion and charged towards Gu Shan’s monstrous attack.

*Hong Hong Hong… *

The continuous sounds of explosion and dazzling light filled the arena. No one could see what was happening in the arena, but they all knew that this competition had escalated to a battle of life and death.

The tremendous impact of energy completely deformed the light curtain restrictions of the arena and the audience all cried out. They were astounded by Gu Shan’s astonishing attack, but at the same time, they were secretly looking forward to how Asura Girl fared. Did she manage to counter this skill? Or was she decimated by it?

The audiences’ eyes widened, staring at the arena.

After a long time, the terrifying energy gradually dissipated, the light vanished, and the scene in the arena captured everyone’s eyes.

“Huh… Why is Gu Shan alone?”

“Where is the Asura Girl? Where did she go?”

“Is she hiding somewhere and preparing to ambush Gu Shan!?”

“The arena is so small, how could she have escaped?”

“Look, there are fragments of clothes on the floor. It’s the clothes that Asura Girl wore before.”

“Is Asura Girl dead? Blown to pieces?”

“Gu Shan won!”

Noises from the audience came up one after another like sea waves hitting the shores. There were exclamations, excitement, regret, pity, and curses…

Asura Girl was like a brilliant comet that suddenly appeared and just as quickly vanished. It was a real pity that a rising star in Purple Mountain City could only shine for just twenty days before being blown to pieces by Gu Shan. Many cultivators who supported Asura Girl secretly cursed Gu Shan for his undeserved win and blamed him for being cruel towards a young girl by using such an artifact on her.

Gu Shan, however, just stood on the stage, his body feeling dreadfully feeble. After unleashing that skill, he was no longer able to fight.

He stood in place with a weird expression, staring blankly at the fragments of clothes over the ground, without the slightest joy in his victory.
