The World Tree Clone’s feedback was extremely potent! And this situation was when it was Yang Kai’s Small Universe, which had a very low population. It was difficult to imagine what kind of grand effect it would have in the Star Boundary which had a far larger one.

Of course, his Small Universe’s population might not be as huge as that of the Star Boundary, but because of the difference in time flow, he also had his own advantages. The Star Boundary could not compare with his Small Universe in this regard. All in all, Yang Kai’s Small Universe and the Star Boundary had their own unique strong points.

At first, Yang Kai would carefully look after the disciples who had come out of the Void Dao Temple, and guide them one by one. Before they had ascended to the Open Heaven Realm, Yang Kai had carefully prepared everything for them and even personally guarded them when they were breaking through.

However, as the number of people increased, Yang Kai found that it was too time-consuming and exhausting to do this by himself. On average, one person would leave his Small Universe every two or three years. It took months or even half a year to prepare everything for them and ensure that their breakthroughs would be smooth and successful.

Once or twice would be nothing, but doing it a few dozen times or even 100 times was not something Yang Kai could take anymore.

So, Yang Kai had left this matter to Blue Sky Pass a long time ago.

The disciples, who came out of the Void Dao Temple, were handed over to the higher-ups of Blue Sky Pass, leaving the rest to them. This was mainly due to his own indolence, but much to Yang Kai’s surprise, it was welcomed by the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters.

It was not surprising when he thought about it though, because the aptitude of these disciples was quite outstanding. Any one of them would have a chance of advancing to the Eighth Order in the future. Every Cave Heaven and Paradise would be ready to snatch up such geniuses.

Unknowingly, these disciples from the Void Dao Temple had attracted the attention of the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. The reason they had fought over these disciples wasn’t because they wanted to take them in as Legacy Disciples. They were on the Black Ink Battlefield where they could lose their lives at any moment, so taking them in as Disciples didn’t hold much meaning because no one knew how long they could live or how long their Disciples would live.

The reason why they were fighting over it was mainly because they had gotten bored over these past few years. Most of the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters had already cultivated to the utmost peak of their Martial Dao, and could not advance any further. Yang Kai still needed to cultivate in retreat to improve his own foundation, but they did not have to.

It could be said that in a situation where there was no battle, most of the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were idle. At times like these, anything could spark their interest, such as these newcomers who had just come from the Void Dao Temple.

Particularly when all these newcomers had outstanding aptitudes and were only in the Emperor Realm. They had extremely high potential, and as a result, every single one of the cultivators who had come from Yang Kai’s Small Universe was extremely popular in Blue Sky Pass.

Yang Kai was quite happy to see this. There were over 60 Eighth-Order Masters gathered in Blue Sky Pass, so no matter what field these disciples liked or what talents they had, they would be able to find a suitable Master. So now, when any disciple wanted to leave the Small Universe, Yang Kai would leave them to Zhong Liang.

At this moment, the two Emperor Realm Masters, one male and one female, were slightly taken aback by Yang Kai’s appearance. They quickly bowed to Yang Kai, “Greetings, Dao Lord!”

Yang Kai had basically not appeared in his Small Universe for the past few hundred years, so no one had seen his true appearance in that time. The ordinary disciples of the Dao Temple didn’t know about the mysteries of the Void World, but for those who wanted to leave and improve their Martial Dao, the presiding Temple Master would explain everything to them. He would tell them that the first person they meet after leaving this world would be the Dao Lord of the entire Void World, its true Master.

At the same time, he would inform them about the situation they would face after leaving the Dao Temple and advancing to the Open Heaven Realm. If these disciples still decided to go ahead, Yang Kai would bring them out. And if they were afraid of the dangers of the outside world and wanted to protect themselves, Yang Kai would not force them; after all, fighting with the Black Ink Clan was not something they could force upon someone.

Those disciples who chose to stay in the Small Universe naturally wouldn’t have another chance to break through to the Open Heaven Realm. Every choice had its pros and cons, so it was best to stick to their own choice.

For the past 1,000 years, the Void Dao Temple had raised many elite disciples. The disciples, who were eligible to leave and advance to the Open Heaven Realm, had basically all chosen to leave. Only a few of them remained in the Small Universe. Cultivators were basically obsessed with cultivation, so every one of them wanted to seek a higher Martial Dao. This kind of temptation could not be quashed by some small dangers.

Yang Kai nodded to the two disciples in response before explaining, “Since you’ve left the Void Dao Temple, I’m sure you understand what’s going on in the outside world. You’ll slowly understand everything. As for the matter of advancing to the Open Heaven Realm, someone will help you prepare for it.”

The two disciples listened quietly and repeatedly nodded.

Yang Kai turned to Zhong Liang, “Martial Uncle, this Junior will take his leave first.”

Zhong Liang didn’t even look at him and waved him away, intently gazing at the two disciples with a happy smile, “Go, go.”

Yang Kai instantly disappeared from his spot.

After he left, the two disciples glanced at each other before turning to Zhong Liang. The latter’s smile made them a little confused, so they secretly released their Divine Sense to investigate, but the next moment, they discovered that this amiable-looking Senior’s cultivation was as deep as the sea, and they were unable to gauge its depth.

[So this is an Open Heaven Realm Master!] The two of them immediately understood. They were both at the peak of the Emperor Realm, so no one in Void World was stronger than them. One had to be at the legendary Open Heaven Realm for them to be unable to detect their cultivation, and an extremely high Order one at that.

“Greetings, Senior!” The two quickly bowed.

Zhong Liang chuckled, “There’s no need to be so polite. En, what Order of materials did you use to complete your Dao Seal?”

Although he knew that those who had come out from Yang Kai’s Small Universe would at the very least advance straight to the Sixth Order, there was always a chance that one of them could break through straight to the Seventh Order, and naturally, Zhong Liang was hoping that these two were such seedlings.

The male disciple replied, “Senior, both Senior Sister and I have Sixth-Order Powers in our Dao Seals.”

[Sixth-Order, huh…] He wasn’t disappointed; after all, even in a place like Yang Kai’s Small Universe, it wasn’t easy to cultivate a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. There had only been two in the past two centuries.

Zhong Liang was still all smiles, “Great!”

While they were talking, a few figures suddenly barged in like bulls. Before the first person even stopped, a voice came from behind, “Another good seedling? It’s finally this Gou’s turn, right?”

“Hold on, this old Master has been waiting for 150 years already, it should be this Old Master’s turn!”

Someone sneered, scoffing, “Naturally, the one who strikes first has the advantage, who would want to discuss order with you, old fart?”

“What kind of nonsense are you spouting in front of the Juniors? It’s not like we’re fighting or killing enemies, so why does it come down to who strikes first? It should be all about fate!” The one who spoke suddenly turned to look at the female disciple and put on an amiable smile, “Little girl, this King thinks you and I are fated, so why don’t you join this King? This King is an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. With this King’s guidance, killing the Black Ink Clan in the future will be as easy as flipping your hand!”

“Who isn’t an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master here?” Immediately, some people became unhappy and released their Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm aura.

Before the two Void Disciples could figure out what was going on, a group of people suddenly rushed in and started shouting at each other, and the next moment, tremendous pressure fell upon them, making everything go black before their eyes.

“Damn it, these two kids fainted!”

“Senior Brother Yun, quickly withdraw your aura! They are only Emperor Realm Juniors, how can they withstand your Eighth-Order aura?”

“Damn… I actually forgot about that. It’s been a long time since I last saw an Emperor Realm brat…”

The corner of Zhong Liang’s mouth twitched, watching all the chaos that had descended into the hall. He started regretting sending a message to these idle and bored Eighth-Order fools. [These two must have been traumatized by these Eighth-Order bastards. Next time, if any good seedlings appear, I will not let them rush in at once like this.]

After leaving the two disciples for Zhong Liang to deal with, Yang Kai left and used the Universe Transference Law and returned to Blue Sky Pass.

He was not worried about the two Emperor Realm Masters advancing to the Open Heaven Realm. They would be personally guided by an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master during their breakthrough, which would be more useful than his guidance.

Not to mention, he had personally refined a batch of Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills and left them with Zhong Liang. Every single one of these disciples who had come out of the Void Dao Temple had an outstanding aptitude to begin with, and they had reached their current cultivation with slow and steady steps. So, with the help of a Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill, it would be a snap for them to advance to the Open Heaven Realm.

In fact, none of the Void Dao Temple’s disciples had failed to break through to the Open Heaven Realm. This was partly because of their solid foundations, and partly because the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill could increase the success rate of their breakthroughs. So, how could they fail?

In comparison, the future prospects of these disciples far exceeded that of ordinary Cave Heaven and Paradise disciples because their starting point was extremely high.

Nonetheless, cultivating in a special environment like the Void Dao Temple also had its drawbacks, which was their lack of real battle experience.

There weren’t many disputes in Void World right now, and even if there were some, they were minor and happened only between Sects. The status of the Void Dao Temple was special; besides sparring with fellow disciples, most of these kids had never seen blood, much less death.

Growing up in such a sheltered greenhouse was perhaps their greatest shortcoming, which might cause them to act poorly in a life-and-death situation.

Nonetheless, the Blue Sky Theatre had been peaceful for a long time, so even if they wanted to find some Black Ink Clansmen to practice with after they had broken through to the Open Heaven Realm, it was impossible.

Yang Kai had always wanted to set up a Black Ink Nest in his Small Universe and use the sub-nest to nurture some weak Black Ink Clansmen, allowing the disciples of the Dao Temple to familiarize themselves with how to fight with this enemy. Unfortunately, his attempts had all failed.

If he wanted to place the sub-nest, he would need to ensure a Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest was permanently under Human control, and Yang Kai could not do something about that.

Therefore, one could not judge these disciples based on their smooth and unhindered cultivation, because it remained unclear how much strength they could display during battle. Everything depended on their future performance.

However, there was something else that made Yang Kai quite happy.

This was these disciples’ compatibility with the Dao of Space, Dao of Time, and Spear Dao.

These three Great Daos were Yang Kai’s foundation, especially the Dao of Space. Yang Kai had mastered it the most, followed by the Dao of Time.

In his Small Universe, there were quite a lot of Dao Essences of these three Grand Daos. Dao Essence could not ordinarily be seen or touched, but it could be comprehended.

Perhaps it was because they had grown up in Void World since birth that their compatibility with these three Grand Daos were very high.
