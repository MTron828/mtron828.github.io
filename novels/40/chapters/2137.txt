Kou Wu had travelled outside the Sect with Bian Yu Qing and had also escaped from the disaster. Otherwise, with Wu Meng Chuan’s temperament at that time, no doubt that he would have killed all of them.

“Seems like you figured something out!” Bian Yu Qing suddenly sneered, gritted his teeth and said, “Little brat, if it weren’t for you, this guardian wouldn’t fall into such a situation, and now my life is still being controlled by another!”

Yang Kai’s face turned slightly, and he acted dumb, “I don’t understand what Protector Bian is saying.”

Kou Wu sighed, “Junior Brother Yang, Sect Master was released by you, right?”

There was no way for Yang Kai to deny it, so he nodded, “Yeah!”

After that, he followed by explaining, “It’s because I had no choice. When I was being locked in Bone Prison, Senior Brother Kou and Protect Bian weren’t in the Sect. Desperate times call for desperate measures, I could only make a deal with Wu Meng Chuan at that time.”

Bian Yu Qing snorted, “As a result, the Sect Master carried out a massacre after he was released, and the almost entire Blue Feather Sect was slaughtered, leaving only a few of them who were quick-witted and surrendered to the Sect Master.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “So, Protector Bian is also one of them?”

“This Queen?” Bian Yu Qing coldly snorted, “This Queen was just lucky. Kou Wu and this Queen only returned to the Sect a month after that incident. We didn’t know about his release and it was too late for us to run away when we realized it. However, the Sect Master did not take my life, maybe because he thought that killing everyone and leaving him alone was not a good idea. Indeed, he spared my life, but...” At this point, she showed hatred on her face, “He cast a seal on this Queen, so from now on, I could only be a slave to him.”

“So that’s how it is!” Yang Kai understood now.

“You, little brat, were the cause of this incident. Speak! How should this Queen punish you in order to dissolve her hatred?!” Bian Yu Qing glared at Yang Kai spookily and considered punishing him heavily.

Yang Kai smiled, “Protector Bian, since you guys have been dealing with Wu Meng Chuan for all these years, you should have understood what kind of person he is. For such a person, either you pluck out the evil by the roots, or you just don’t provoke him. Not only did you provoke, but you also imprisoned and tortured him. Did you not expect retribution?”

Bian Yu Qing frowned and stared at Yang Kai, “What do you mean?”

Yang Kai replied, “What I mean is, even without me, Wu Meng Chuan would still get out of trouble, so your tragedy has nothing to do with me.”

“Bullshit!” Bian Yu Qing was infuriated.

Yang Kai shrugged his hands, “Besides, isn’t Protector Bian in good condition now? Even though Protector Bian had a seal cast on her by Wu Meng Chuan, who is the descendant of that person, he will definitely be successful in the future and you will be blessed with fortunes. It’s just a temporary hardship for now, can’t Protector Bian wait for it?”

Bian Yu Qing looked at him coldly and snorted, “How come it sounds like this Queen has won a grand prize? Should this Queen thank you for it?”

“You don’t have to,” Yang Kai waved his hand.

Bian Yu Qing said helplessly, “Anyway, what’s done is done. Kou Wu and this Queen can only take one step at a time now.”

Seeing that she did not really have the means to take revenge, Yang Kai finally felt relieved after a time of worry.

Kou Wu smiled, “Protector Bian and I were being ordered by the Sect Master to represent the Blue Feather Sect in the Four Seasons Realm this time. We saw you on the Azure Sun Temple’s side, so we decided to call you over to ask you about something.”

The Blue Feather Sect was just a small Sect. Although they lacked an Emperor Realm Master, originally there were still a few of Third-Order Dao Source Realm with them. As such, there were two slots for them to enter the Four Seasons Realm.

After the massacre by Wu Meng Chuan, it caused a massive shortage of manpower in the Blue Feather Sect, so Bian Yu Qing and Kou Wu were the only two left who could carry this responsibility.

“Information about the Four Seasons Realm?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

“Yes.” Bian Yu Qing nodded, “Don’t tell me you know nothing. Since you are with the Azure Sun Temple, you must know more than us, right?”

Yang Kai frowned, and spoke after pondering for a while, “I do have the information, but I can’t disclose the information that is confidential to the other Sect.”

Bian Yu Qing smiled faintly, “No one will know if we keep it a secret.”

Yang Kai shook his head.

Bian Yu Qing’s face turned red, just when she was about to say something more, Yang Kai said, “I can only tell you about this... Star Seals will appear in the Four Seasons Realm this time.”

“Star Seals?” Kou Wu frowned, obviously he had no idea what they were.

On the contrary, Bian Yu Qing vaguely recalled something. After a while of pondering, she exclaimed, “You mean the ticket to enter the Shattered Star Sea?”

“Precisely!” Yang Kai nodded.

“Shattered Star Sea?” Kou Wu finally reacted to it and let out a low voice in shock.

Yang Kai smiled, “All the best to both of you. If we meet in the Four Seasons Realm, maybe we will still have a chance to cooperate with each other!”

After speaking, Yang Kai left them without turning back.

Neither Bian Yu Qing nor Kou Wu was his close friend. The information that he provided to them just now was fair enough to pay off the little favour that he owed them in the Blue Feather Sect last time.

He no longer owed either of them any favours. Nothing would happen if neither stepped on his toes. However, if one did anything malignant towards him, they should not blame him for his cruelty. After all, they were now under Wu Meng Chuan.

Yang Kai was very afraid of the descendant of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor.

At that time, Wu Meng Chuan had actually passed on to him a complete set of Heaven Devouring Battle Law, which was the Secret Art of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. It was because of this Secret Art that the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor became the number one of Star Boundary at that time.

Yang Kai would have never believed Wu Meng Chuan did not have some sort of nefarious plan. It was just that he really did not understand what his intention was by passing on the Heaven Devouring Battle Law to him.

Yang Kai did not cultivate the Secret Art but gave it to the Embodiment. During the period of cultivation, the Embodiment had strengthened a lot. Yang Kai had also discovered the Heaven defying effects of this Secret Art.

If it were not for his own concern, he would have been tempted to cultivate it himself.

Occupied by his own thoughts, Yang Kai soon returned to the Azure Sun Temple.

Everyone was quietly meditating, taking advantage of the little time they had left to restore to their perfect condition.

Only Xiao Bai Yi opened his eyes and glanced at him, but he did not say anything.

Days flew by.

As time passed, the density of World Energy in the nameless mountain valley increased gradually to a level of where Spirit Qi Mist was formed.

Looking down from above, the entire mountain valley was enveloped in a white mist. The mist was not the regular mist but was a sign of the condensation of World Energy.

The cultivating environment had reached an incredible level.

Anyone who could cultivate in such a place for a long period of time would be able to increase in strength at an extraordinary speed.

Unfortunately, the condensation of World Energy was only a sign before the opening of the Sealed World. Even a Sect like Star Soul Palace did not have such a jaw-dropping cultivating area.

Finally, at a certain moment on the fourth day after everyone arrived on this nameless mountain valley, everyone heard a faint, strange noise coming from the void.

Immediately afterwards, the World Energy suddenly trembled, and the mist rolled over madly towards a certain location – the centre of the entire mountain valley, the only empty area.

It seemed that all of the Sects knew that the entrance to Sealed World was here as there was no great force stationed here.

At this moment, all the cultivators opened their eyes together to look over.

“It’s started!” At the Star Soul Palace station, Xiao Yu Yang shouted in a low voice. All the disciples stirred up and secretly rolled up their sleeves!

“The entrance is about to open!” At the Azure Sun Temple station, Gao Xue Ting looked at the twenty people in front of her and said, “This Elder hopes that you stay together for as long as possible after you enter to avoid the situation of being alone. If someone insists on going their own way, you may ignore what this Elder said.”

After a pause, she continued, “Best wishes to all of you, and return safely!”

Xia Sheng grinned and said, “Don’t worry Elder Gao, this disciple will take good care of them.”

Gao Xue Ting nodded and said no more, then turned her attention to the place where World Energy was converging.

At this moment, the World Energy between Heaven and Earth was swarming over there, arousing the whistling of the wind that sent the sand and rocks in the mountain valley flying, but did not affect anyone’s vision.

Suddenly, all the World Energy that had converged there disappeared, as if it had fallen into a black hole, and the space suddenly became unstable at the same time.

The more World Energy poured into the void, the more unstable it became.

At a certain moment, the void opened, and a gap was visible to the naked eye.

Auras continued to pour in, and the gap was getting bigger and bigger. Looking above, it seemed as if a mighty man had opened a window in the sky. Through that window, some scenery on the opposite side could be vaguely seen, ethereal and unmarked, twisting and changing. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

This lasted for half an hour.

Half an hour later, the World Energy in the mountain valley that had been condensed into mist had all poured into the void gap.

The entire mountain valley, absent of any World Energy at this moment, had restored to its depressing state.

And the gap had become more than ten feet long and five feet high.

“The entrance is open!” Some exclaimed.

“Go!” People could not wait. They activated their Movement Skills and passed over everyone’s heads and rushed directly to the narrow entrance.

A man and a woman, probably cultivators from a small Sect like Blue Feather Sect with only two slots, had used what seemed to be a Secret Technique. They transformed into a stream of light and zapped towards the entrance as quick as lightning, ahead of everyone else.

They seemed to think that getting in earlier would give them some advantages.

It was a pity that it was unlike what they had hoped for.

Several Emperor Realms from the big Sects just looked at them coldly and silently, with no intention of stopping them.

“Aw!” Gao Xue Ting sighed, “There’s always someone desperate!”

Two screams radiated from the void just as she finished.
