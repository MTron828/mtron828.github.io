An ascension from the Seventh-Order to the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm couldn’t be achieved in a short time. Perhaps it would take days or even months; however, the spectators didn’t appear to be impatient at all as they wouldn’t miss any details.

The Samsara Pavilion was where hearts were trained, so regardless of how long a person stayed inside it, their cultivation wouldn’t increase one bit.

Luo Ting He must have reached the critical point of achieving a breakthrough 2,000 ago; otherwise, she wouldn’t have been able to achieve an ascension as soon as she got out of the Samsara Pavilion. 2,000 years of reincarnations may have even been what triggered the chance for her to achieve an ascension.

In other words, if she hadn’t dashed into the Samsara Pavilion on a whim, she would’ve become an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master a long time ago.

“Xiao Qu’er, you directly ascended to the Sixth-Order back then, so you’ll have a chance to make it to the Eighth-Order. It will be beneficial for you to observe,” Yu Xiang Die said.

Qu Hua Shang nodded with a solemn expression.

“The danger that an Open Heaven Realm Master faces when achieving an ascension is related to the strengthening of their Small Universe. There is a limit to a Small Universe’s capacity, so if the cultivator is unable to bear the sudden increase in power, their Small Universe would be at risk of collapsing. That is the kind of risk that Senior Sister Luo has to face now, and it is also the kind of risk that all Open Heaven Realm Masters have to deal with. In your case, you’re a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master who will make it to the Seventh-Order one day. The risk you will have to face at that time is that your Small Universe must materialise, which is the hardest part. It’s even more dangerous than what your Martial Aunt Luo is facing.”

Qu Hua Shang said respectfully, “Please enlighten me, Martial Aunt.”

Yu Xiang Die let out a sigh, “Brother Xu is supposed to be the one who tells you this; however, since he’s not around, I’ll do so on his behalf. During the materialisation process, your Small Universe will face an unimaginable impact. It’s just like a Monster Beast that has to condense a Monster Core in their body when their cultivation reaches a certain level. If your power is unstable, you won’t be able to achieve your goal; therefore, before you ascend to the Seventh-Order, you have to make sure that you have accumulated enough heritage. If your heritage is insufficient, your Small Universe won’t be able to materialise, and that will be a fatal disaster. Countless disciples from the Cave Heavens and Paradises have lost their lives during the process. That’s the reason there are so few High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters in the Cave Heavens and Paradises.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Since time immemorial, there were not many in the Cave Heavens and Paradises who directly ascended to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, but there must be many people who had directly made it to the Fifth-Order.

After years of accumulation, these disciples who had directly ascended to the Fifth-Order were supposed to make it to the Sixth-Order and even the Seventh-Order if nothing unexpected happened; however, if it was so easy to ascend to the Seventh-Order, there would have been more than 10,000 High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters in each of the Cave Heavens and Paradises by now.

Besides the Cave Heavens and Paradises, there should also be a lot of Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in the Second Class great forces.

Nevertheless, the truth was that none of the Cave Heavens or Paradises had a lot of High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters. There were likely other reasons for this situation as well, but the huge risk associated with crossing over to the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm was undoubtedly a big one. Those disciples who had the right to attempt an ascension to the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm either didn’t have the confidence to give it a try as they hadn’t accumulated enough heritage, or had lost their lives during the process.

The gap between the Sixth-Order and the Seventh-Order was a dividing line, and even after one made it to the Seventh-Order, it would be extremely difficult to ascend to the next realm.

Yang Kai suddenly recalled something as he asked, “In that case, the Four Great Pillars and Twelve Minor Pillars must be very useful for the Open Heaven Realm Masters when ascending to the next Order.”

Yu Xiang Die nodded, “That’s to be expected. When an Open Heaven Realm Master achieves an ascension, their Small Universe will be faced with a violent impact. The Four Great Pillars and Twelve Minor Pillars are very useful in stabilising one’s Small Universes; however, you have to understand that only the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters have the right to refine the Twelve Minor Pillars. Although those things might be useful to cultivators below the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm, they’re unable to use them. The only things that are useful to them are the Four Great Pillars. Nevertheless, those are even rarer. How is the average person supposed to get their hands on them?”

As she spoke, she shot Yang Kai a wry glance to mean that he was truly lucky.

It wasn’t a secret in the Cave Heavens and Paradises that Yang Kai possessed the World Spring, which could protect his Small Universe from external intrusion or impact. Even the Black Ink Strength didn’t have any effect on Yang Kai. The High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters were envious of him because of that.

Yang Kai initially thought that the only uses of the World Spring were to help him fend off external forces and fortify his Small Universe, so it surprised him to learn that it was also useful during breakthroughs.

With one of the Four Great Pillars in one’s body, not only could they ensure that their Small Universe would be freed from any external influences, but it could also allow the cultivator to have no worries about raising living creatures in his or her body to strengthen their heritage. Additionally, it could fend off the invasion of Black Ink Strength. Furthermore, it was very useful when the cultivator achieved an ascension.

Now, it seemed that the Four Great Pillars were indeed some of the most precious treasures in the world. They were just as precious as the Soul Warming Lotus and the Immortal Tree that Yang Kai had obtained. To the Open Heaven Realm Masters, perhaps the Four Great Pillars may even be more valuable.

“Martial Aunt Yu, there’s one more thing I’d like to ask you about,” Yang Kai said humbly.

Yu Xiang Die replied, “Go ahead.”

“I’m sure you know a thing or two about my situation. I’m a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master now, and I feel that I’m just one step away from the Seventh-Order. What would I face when I try to break through to the Seventh-Order?”

Yu Xiang Die was shocked by how fast Yang Kai could accumulate his heritage.

It had to be noted that it had only been 300 or so years since he directly ascended to the Fifth-Order outside of Shadowless Cave Heaven in the Shattered Heaven. On top of that, the 130 years he had spent in the Samsara Pavilion had to be excluded because he wasn’t cultivating at all during that period.

Not only had Yang Kai ascended from the Fifth-Order to the Sixth-Order so quickly, but he was also now just one step away from the Seventh-Order.

She had never heard that anyone was able to cultivate so quickly in the Open Heaven Realm. Accumulation was of utmost importance in the cultivation of an Open Heaven Realm Master. There were no other ways to rapidly increase one’s heritage. A long period of accumulation was inevitable for all Open Heaven Realm Masters.

Every Open Heaven Realm Master had to spend a painfully long time cultivating to reach the next Order.

It was possible for a Third-Order Open Heaven Realm Master to ascend to the Fourth-Order after 300 years of cultivating, but it was close to impossible for a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master to make it to the Seventh-Order within the same amount of time.

However, the truth was right before Yu Xiang Die’s eyes. She knew and could even feel that Yang Kai was indeed strong. In Lang Ya Paradise, he single-handedly defeated all its Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. No one was a match for him. It was apparent that the average Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master couldn’t compete against him. He must be at the peak of the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

Nevertheless, she was unable to answer Yang Kai’s question.

Usually, the most important thing when a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master ascended to the Seventh-Order was the materialisation of the Small Universe, but Yang Kai was different. His Small Universe had already materialised when he made it to the Fifth-Order, so he didn’t have to face the biggest problem that troubled other Open Heaven Realm Masters.

After giving it a thought, Yu Xiang Die shook her head, “To be honest with you, I’ve never met an Open Heaven Realm Master like you before. I’ve discussed with my Fellow Brothers and Sisters regarding your situation, and we believe that the uniqueness of your Small Universe might have something to do with the fact that you’re an expert in the Dao of Space.”

“Has no one cultivated the Dao of Space before me?”

“There were many people who had cultivated the Dao of Space before, but none had attainments as high as yours; therefore, I’m not sure what you will face when ascending to the Seventh-Order. However, I suppose you won’t face the common problems that trouble other cultivators. Moreover, you have the World Spring to protect your Small Universe, so I think that there won’t be a problem when try to reach the Seventh-Order.” She then paused for a moment before continuing, “With that said, you’d still better be careful. Look for a quiet place and cultivate in seclusion. Deduce the problems you might face when achieving an ascension so that you won’t be flustered when that time comes.”

“I understand.” Yang Kai nodded.

He already had the intention to ascend to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm a long time ago; however, his 100 year promise with Qu Hua Shang was about to be due at that time, so he put it off until now. Presently, Qu Hua Shang had gotten out of the Samsara Pavilion, so after everything was settled in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, Yang Kai planned to start cultivating in seclusion.

As he thought of the Proprietress all of a sudden, he quickly asked, “Martial Aunt Yu, has Lan You Ruo from Void Land exited seclusion yet?”

Yu Xiang Die replied, “She had already left seclusion while you were inside the Chaotic Dead Territory. Don’t worry, she’s now a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.”

Yang Kai arched his brow. He had spent several dozen years in the Chaotic Dead Territory and more than 100 years in the Samsara Pavilion. So, it had been quite a long time since the Proprietress stopped cultivating in seclusion.

Upon learning that she had successfully made it to the Seventh-Order, he was relieved. The main reason was that the Proprietress had cultivated in seclusion for a very long time, so he wasn’t certain if everything was going well for her. Even if she was facing any problems though, outsiders were unable to lend her a hand.

Since she had ascended to the Seventh-Order, she had to face the problem that the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters, who were not from the Cave Heavens and Paradises, had to deal with.

“What’s the stance of the Cave Heavens and Paradises about her?” Yang Kai asked.

Yu Xiang Die replied, “Si Tu Kong from Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven has stepped forward to vouch for her, so no one will make a move on her. Don’t worry about it.”

Because of the matter regarding the Black Ink Disciples, the Cave Heavens and Paradises were wary of the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters that emerged in other great forces. As such, they would lure those High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters to their own Sects to keep an eye on them, which caused a misunderstanding among the general public.

Some people would secretly ascend to the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm and then sneak into the Shattered Heaven.

It was the same case for Bright Sun Divine Monarch Cheng Yang, Xia Lin Lang, and the others; however, those from the Cave Heavens and Paradises were unable to explain anything about the Black Ink Clan to the public. Even the Vice Sect Master of Lang Ya Paradise, Yuan Du, was unable to resist the allure of the Black Ink Strength as he took the initiative to give a sacrificial offering to the Black Ink Clan in order to break through his own shackles. It couldn’t be guaranteed that others wouldn’t be tempted upon learning the powers of the Black Ink Strength.

After turning into Black Ink Disciples, they would no longer be restricted by their starting point in the Open Heaven Realm, which was temptation enough for a lot of people, especially those ambitious people who had a low starting point.

However, the Proprietress was originally from First Inn, which was a business backed by Si Tu Kong, who was from Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven. With his assurance, together with the connections the Proprietress had built up over the years, she could ensure her own independence. At the very least, she wouldn’t fall into the situation that the other High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters who were not from the Cave Heavens and Paradises had to deal with.

All of a sudden, Yu Xiang Die shot a meaningful glance at Qu Hua Shang, “Xiao Qu’er, you must be careful in the future. This brat is not someone who is content with his lot. He might even bring back more women in the future.”

Qu Hua Shang nodded repeatedly, “Yes, Martial Aunt.”

An aggrieved Yang Kai refuted, “Please stop slandering me, Martial Aunt Yu. I’ve never been a licentious man. I’m a well-behaved person who always stays within his bounds.”

Qu Hua Shang looked smilingly at him, “Oh, really? What’s going on with you and Senior Sister Tao then? Weren’t you supposed to tell me about that?”

Yang Kai hurriedly said, “I was just about to explain.”
