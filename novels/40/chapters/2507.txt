As soon as Yang Kai entered the Sealed World Bead, his complexion changed drastically. He looked around in befuddlement and called out in alarm, “How, h-how did it become like this?”

Although he was mentally prepared for the fact that the release of World Force would cause a certain degree of damage to the Small Sealed World, Yang Kai had not anticipated the impact would be this huge.

Currently, the Small Sealed World was in a state of devastation and chaos. Countless ravines crisscrossed in all directions on the ground, as if the battle between Duan Hong Chen and Wu Kuang had taken place here.

The flowers, plants, and lush trees that once flourished everywhere were destroyed in large swaths, and even the rich World Energy had diminished noticeably.

The entire Small Sealed World looked lifeless, just like a doomsday scene.

Yang Kai’s heart ached. Ever since he obtained the Sealed World Bead on Shadowed Star, this artifact had provided him with a lot of convenience and saved him from many crises, but he never expected it to become like this.

The Embodiment stood beside Yang Kai with a sad expression, lamenting, “Wu Kuang said World Force is a World’s Source Strength. What good results could you expect when you drew out that Source Strength from this world?”

“What happened to Liu Yan and the others? Are they okay?” Yang Kai asked worriedly, releasing his Divine Sense to investigate the situation.

The Embodiment answered, “They are fine, it’s just that Ruo Xi and Xiao Qi are still asleep, and we don’t know when they will wake up.”

Yang Kai nodded before teleporting to where Liu Yan and the others were. Just as the Embodiment said, Zhang Ruo Xi and Mo Xiao Qi were still asleep.

Mo Xiao Qi’s emotional riot caused the release of her Divine Soul Seal, which was resealed by Duan Hong Cheng with a drop of Zhang Ruo Xi’s Blood Essence. The result was that both of them fell unconscious. The two little girls had probably been thoroughly exhausted, but although they were unconscious, there should not be a problem as their breathing was smooth and peaceful.

After investigating for a while, Yang Kai felt relieved, and then transferred his Divine Sense to the medicine garden. Seeing that the Immortal Tree and Firmament Tree, as well as the exotic flowers and plants he planted in the medicine garden were not affected, only then did he truly relax.

If the Immortal Tree and Firmament Tree were affected, Yang Kai would not have enough tears to cry.

Fortunately, although the Small Sealed World was badly damaged, the important areas were not affected. It was a small blessing in all of the misfortune.

[The question is, how do I repair this damage?] Yang Kai was extremely troubled. Although he was proficient in the Dao of Space, it was not the same as mastery over World Force; he did not know where to start even if he wanted to repair this place.

The Sealed World Bead had absorbed a large amount of Source Strength in the Source Sea, which condensed thickly in the space inside the Sealed World Bead; however, the World Energy and Source Strength were escaping the Small Sealed World steadily due to the damage.

It was understood that if Yang Kai did not come up with a solution, the World Energy and Source Strength here would completely leak out sooner or later, and the Sealed World Bead would not be able to provide a decent environment for Liu Yan and the others for cultivation.

Yang Kai’s eyes suddenly lit up as he thought about the problem though.

The reason the Small Sealed World became like this was that he had extracted the World Force of this world.

Since that was the case, if he could replenish the missing World Source Strength, the Small Sealed World should be able to restore to its original form!

World Source Strength could be found in any part of the world; however, only a capable Great Emperor could perceive it, so Yang Kai was naturally not capable of this. However, he did own the Mountains and Rivers Bell, which had suppressed and contained a decent amount of World Force earlier.

What miraculous effects would there be if the Small Sealed World was flooded by the suppressed World Force?

Especially since the suppressed World Force was much richer than the amount Yang Kai had drawn out of the Sealed World Bead. If it was used well, not only could it repair the Small Sealed World, but also might restore it to a better state than before, with more complete World Principles.

Yang Kai could not help getting excited at that thought, eager to give it a try.

In any case, if he did not try, the Sealed World Bead would become a broken world sooner or later; but if he succeeded, the benefits would be self-evident.

After making up his mind, Yang Kai flickered and reappeared in the oasis. Then, he waved his hand to release the Embodiment, Liu Yan, Zhang Ruo Xi, and Mo Xiao Qi.

“What is Master’s order?” Liu Yan asked Yang Kai curiously.

Yang Kai normally would not release all of them out of the Sealed World Bead, so there must be something important for them to do.

Yang Kai solemnly disclosed, “I want to repair the Sealed World Bead, you may not be safe staying inside.”

“Repair the Small Sealed World?” A trace of confusion flashed across the Embodiment’s eyes, but he quickly reacted and asked in a small voice, “Are you going to use the suppressed World Force?”

Yang Kai nodded and quickly explained, “This is the only way. I have to try.”

The Embodiment pondered for a while before pointing out, “It’s also an opportunity.”

“But before that, I want to give Liu Yan something!” Yang Kai looked at Liu Yan with scorching eyes.

“The Phoenix True Fire?” Liu Yan’s breathing stopped slightly.

“So, you felt it,” Yang Kai grinned.

Yang Kai threw the Phoenix True Fire into the Small Sealed World after obtaining it from the Shattered Star Sea earlier, and its presence was naturally sensed by Liu Yan.

The Phoenix True Fire was the legacy of the Martial Flame Great Emperor, a Fire Phoenix’s Source. Liu Yan was originally a Fire Attribute Artifact Spirit, so there was a subtle connection between the two, not to mention that Liu Yan had also refined a Luan Feng’s feather.

The Fire Phoenix and Luan Feng were both branches of the Phoenix Clan; they shared the same origins.

Liu Yan possessed a trace of the Luan Feng’s strength after refining its feather, so it was only reasonable that she could also refine the Phoenix True Fire.

However, it was accompanied by great danger that may extinguish her Soul the moment she tried.

Yang Kai expressed solemnly, “Liu Yan, the Phoenix True Fire is a Fire Phoenix’s Source, if you succeed in refining it, you will inherit the legacy memory of a Fire Phoenix and be truly reborn. Becoming a True Fire Phoenix would also be just a matter of time, but you must be aware of the risk you would be taking. If there is even the slightest error, you will surely be burned to death. You…”

“Master, I am prepared,” Liu Yan interjected before Yang Kai could finish.

Yang Kai was slightly stunned and looked at her intently for a while before he nodded and continued, “This is your own path, it is your choice. Since you are prepared, I won’t try to dissuade you. Just… be careful!”

Liu Yan pursed her red lips, and told him softly, “If Liu Yan fails in refining, please don’t be sad for me. Liu Yan was once just an Artifact Spirit. I obtained sentience by chance, and am already very satisfied to be able to follow Master for so many years. It’s enough that this servant was able to live freely like this even for a short time.”

Emotions welled up in her, and her eyes became slightly red, but because she was a puppet, she could not shed any tears. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Yang Kai responded softly, “It has also been my honour and privilege to be able to meet and know you, and to be with you all this way. Don’t think too much, you will succeed.”

Liu Yan nodded firmly, “I will definitely not disappoint Master!”

Yang Kai’s expression turned solemn as he violently pushed the Golden Divine Dragon Source Strength in his body. Suddenly a huge golden dragon phantom appeared behind him, flashing its fangs and claws.

Stretching out his hand, Yang Kai sent a dragon claw into the Sealed World Bead, and with a firm grip, he pulled out the Phoenix True Fire.

Under the dragon’s claw, the Phoenix True Fire was like a living little phoenix, flapping its wings desperately but bound tightly by the Golden Divine Dragon Source.

“Take it!” Yang Kai shouted loudly as he slowly pushed the Phoenix True Fire towards Liu Yan.

Liu Yan took a deep breath, her face instantly turning as tranquil as an ancient well, and she inhaled the Phoenix True Fire into her abdomen in one gulp.

Immediately afterwards, she flickered and flew towards the depths of the desert at lightning speed, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

Soon, an extremely hot wave of power transmitted from that direction, and a ball of fire was blazing in the yellow, sand-filled landscape, accompanied by a clear and loud phoenix cry that echoed across the sky.

Yang Kai looked solemn and released his Divine Sense, paying close attention to the situation there.

If he had a choice, he would not let Liu Yan refine the Phoenix True Fire at this time.

He had originally planned to wait until Liu Yan was stronger before giving her the Phoenix True Fire, but the Sealed World Bead was seriously damaged right now, and could collapse at any moment, so it was no longer suitable to store the Phoenix True Fire inside it.

Only the Sealed World Bead could store the Phoenix True Fire as no Space Ring could accommodate it.

Once the Small Sealed World collapsed, the precious Phoenix True Fire would very likely be swallowed into the Void, never to be found again.

As a last resort, Yang Kai could only ask Liu Yan to refine it at this time.

However, Yang Kai was also fully prepared. It would be best if Liu Yan succeeded in the refinement, but if the process did not go as planned, he would directly intervene and suppress the Phoenix True Fire using his Golden Divine Dragon Source and the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

Presumably, Liu Yan would not need to worry about her life.

He decided not to tell Liu Yan because he did not want Liu Yan to have the thought of escaping if all went wrong, and it would be fine even if the refining failed.

Being cornered at the gates of death was the best way to force out Liu Yan’s potential.

Yang Kai looked solemn at the detection of his Divine Sense.

Liu Yan, who was refining the Phoenix True Fire, was currently on fire, and the phantom of a Fire Phoenix had emerged above her petite body. The majestic phoenix eyes stared at her coldly, obviously unwilling to be captured and refined easily.

Fortunately, Liu Yan had the body of a Spirit Puppet and was also a Fire Attribute Artifact Spirit. She had even devoured a large amount of Sun’s True Fire, so she had strong resistance and compatibility with this scorching fire.

She constantly urged her own power to resist the terrifying power of the Phoenix True Fire. Instead of hurrying to devour it though, she released her Divine Sense to communicate and comfort the Phoenix True Fire continuously.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, realizing that his worries were needless.

Liu Yan was not a child, she had her own ideas and inspirations. If she was successful in her approach to communicate with the Phoenix True Fire, it was very likely that Phoenix True Fire would recognize her as its Master and would be refined willingly without any dangers.

The key now was how to get Phoenix True Fire to recognize her.

Yang Kai stared intently, not daring to miss a single moment.
