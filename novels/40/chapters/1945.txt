Yang Kai’s brow furrowed slightly, but after a little thought, he understood and asked, “Senior came to this conclusion based on the things in our Space Rings?”

“Indeed!” the beautiful woman nodded lightly, “Only a cultivator from the lower Star Fields would have so much junk in their Space Ring!”

Having all her most precious treasures be evaluated as junk made Liu Xian Yun feel quite uncomfortable, but when she thought about her opponent’s strength, status, and methods, she could not say anything. Perhaps her possessions really were trash to this woman.

On the other hand, Yang Kai did not care at all because his Space Ring was originally designed as a type of camouflage to deceive others and really didn’t have anything precious inside it. Compared to the items stored away in his Sealed World Bead, it was not an exaggeration to say the things in his ring were trash. Smiling indifferently, he continued to ask, “In that case, are the suspicions against us cleared?”

The suspicions he mentioned were naturally related to them possibly being Daybreak Pavilion spies.

The beautiful woman smiled lightly, “En, but this Queen is curious, which Star Field are you from?”

“Grand Desolation Star Field!” Yang Kai replied without hesitation.

Liu Xian Yun felt some surprise but showed nothing on her face.

“Oh...” The beautiful woman raised her brow thoughtfully, “I have heard of that Star Field. It seems there is a Sect here in the Star Boundary that is related to them.”

“Is Senior referring to the Netherworld Sect? We are not from the Netherworld Sect,” Yang Kai didn’t know whether the other party was testing her or simply curious, so he simply responded accordingly before smiling coldly, “On the contrary, we have some grudges with the people from the Netherworld Sect.”

“Is that so?” The beautiful woman looked at Yang Kai with a faint smile, her pair of beautiful eyes exuding a strange light, as if trying to pierce into Yang Kai’s heart to see if he was being honest or not.

“En, in the Starlight Corridor, we were ambushed by people from the Netherworld Sect,” Yang Kai snorted coldly, his eyes flashing with undisguised hatred, as if the Netherworld Sect was his irreconcilable enemy.

The beautiful woman nodded and said nothing.

Pondering for a moment, she eventually said, “Since you are not spies from Daybreak Pavilion, and you are from the lower Star Fields, this Queen will give you two choices.”

“Please elaborate!”

“One, leave my Blue Feather Sect now, the further the better!” The beautiful woman put up a single jade white finger and smiled softly.

Hearing her say this, Liu Xian Yun expression could not help changing as she almost instinctually agreed, but before she spoke, she glanced over at Yang Kai subconsciously and found that his expression was actually still indifferent, so she quickly swallowed down her words.

“And the second choice?” Yang Kai asked.

“Second, join my Blue Feather Sect and become my Blue Feather Sect’s disciples. Although my Blue Feather Sect is not the biggest in the Southern Territory, it still has a stable foundation. By joining, you can gain a foothold in this land and also have a place of refuge. If you encounter any problems in your cultivation, this Queen can also answer one or two questions for you.”

“Is such a good deed really an option?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up when he heard this and seemed to be extremely excited.

The beautiful woman smiled without speaking, seemingly quite satisfied with Yang Kai’s attitude.

Yang Kai thought for a while before knitting his brow and asking, “I have another question.”

“Speak!” The beautiful woman raised her chin slightly, her expression aloof and arrogant.

“Our strength is not worth mentioning, so why does Senior want to recruit us into her Sect?” Yang Kai asked in a deep voice.

The beautiful woman covered her mouth lightly and smiled, “Because you are from the lower Star Fields. Cultivators like you are all worth training; it is just a pity neither of you is a Star Master. If you were Star Masters, this Queen would give you even more care.”

“So that’s how it is!” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

This was something Liu Xian Yun had mentioned to him before, that cultivators from the lower Star Fields all required genius-level aptitude in order to simply reach the Star Boundary. Once they arrived, they would become popular recruitment targets by big Sects, even if they weren’t Star Masters.

This beautiful woman’s explanation was reasonable.

“So, what will you choose?” The beautiful woman looked at Yang Kai and asked.

“What other choice is there? Naturally, we want to join the Blue Feather Sect!” Yang Kai did not even think about it before agreeing, immediately turning his head and asking, “Xian Yun, what do you think?”

Liu Xian Yun looked dazed, never having expected that Yang Kai would decide this matter so hastily, leaving her somewhat at a loss about how to respond.

However, after meeting eyes with Yang Kai’s briefly, Liu Xian Yun nodded, “If that is Brother Yang’s intention, I will join too!”

The beautiful woman heard this and smiled brightly before standing up from her chair and saying, “Good. From now on you will be disciples of my Blue Feather Sect, temporarily under the jurisdiction of this Queen. Kou Wu, take them down and arrange a place for them to stay. Make sure they cultivate diligently so as not to disappoint this Queen’s expectations.”

After saying what she wanted to, the beautiful woman turned around and left.

Kou Wu respectfully bowed.

After the beautiful woman left, Kou Wu looked at Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun with a smile and said, “So from now on, everyone will be fellow brothers and sisters. Senior Brother hasn’t asked you your names yet?”

“Yang Kai greets Senior Brother Kou,” Yang Kai cupped his fists with a grin, appearing quite open and friendly.

Although Liu Xian Yun felt a bit awkward, she too quickly reported her name.

After learning the names of the two, Kou Wu said, “So it is Junior Brother Yang and Junior Sister Liu. Senior Brother has offended you two a few days ago, but please don’t take it to heart. Senior Brother was simply performing his duties.”

“Senior Brother Kou is too polite. The previous incident was our fault for being careless, Senior Brother need not blame himself.”

Kou Wu nodded before beckoning to them, “Follow me, I’ll take you to your accommodations so you can get settled in and familiarize yourselves with the environment. While our Blue Feather Sect is not a peak-level existence, it’s also not bad.”

A short time later, after reaching the bottom of the mountain, Kou Wu pointed to the two adjacent wooden houses and said, “These will be your residences for the time being. Each house has a barrier protecting it and requires an Identity Token to enter and exit. As for those tokens, someone will bring them to you in two days. It would be best if you stay here until you obtain your Identity Tokens, otherwise, you might encounter some difficulties if you go out without them.”

“Understood,” Yang Kai nodded and said, “Then what should we do from now on, Senior Brother Kou?”

Kou Wu smiled upon hearing these words and said, “There’s no need to do anything specific for the time being, just cultivate well. If a mission comes up that you need to participate in, I will inform you. In addition, we are under the jurisdiction of Protector Bian, so we need not pay any attention to anyone else, just following Milady’s orders will suffice. Good, that is all for today.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Having said so, Kou Wu turned to leave.

Yang Kai suddenly remembered something and hurriedly called out, “Senior Brother Kou!”

“What else do you want to ask?” Kou Wu frowned, seemingly growing impatient.

Yang Kai leaned closer and asked in a low voice, “Senior Brother Kou, Senior Protector’s cultivation...”

Kou Wu smiled meaningfully, “Third-Order Dao Source Realm, but you need not concern yourself with that for now. Just cultivate diligently.”

“What Senior Brother says is correct!” Yang Kai nodded appreciatively.

After Kou Wu left and only Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun remained, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly turned cold as he signalled to Liu Xian Yun and walked towards one of the wooden houses.

Liu Xian Yun followed closely behind.

The layout of the house was quite simple: One bed, one table, and one chair. Although it seemed to have been vacant for a long time, it was spotless, so the barrier around it appeared to be working properly.

After Yang Kai took a seat, he released his Divine Sense and checked around to confirm no one was eavesdropping before saying, “You want to ask me why I agreed to join Blue Feather Sect, right?”

Liu Xian Yun thought for a moment before saying, “I did wonder why at first, but after some thought, I understood that this was probably the only chance we have to survive!”

“En, even though that Protector Bian gave us two choices, who knows what the consequences of choosing the first option would have been? You also saw what kind of behaviour these Blue Feather Sect people have. They’re certainly not kind people,” Yang Kai sighed.

Liu Xian Yun also smiled bitterly, “I didn’t expect it would be like this when I entered the Star Boundary. If I had only known...”

“It’s useless to regret now, we just need to take one step at a time. As long as we become strong enough, why would we need to fear anyone here?” Yang Kai sneered.

“I suppose so...” Liu Xian Yun smiled bitterly. “Since that’s the case, I’ll go take a rest first.”

“En.”

Over the next few days, everything was peaceful.

Because he had not received his Identity Token yet, Yang Kai didn’t dare to walk around at will and just remained inside his house to cultivate.

Without the seal on his cultivation, the speed at which his Saint Qi transformed into Source Qi increased greatly.

Yang Kai already vaguely felt that he was about to touch the threshold of the Third-Order Origin King Realm.

Before entering the Star Field, he had spent several years cultivating in the Dead Zone outside Shadowed Star, using the omnipresent Emperor Pressure to increase his comprehension of the Martial Dao and Heavenly Way, which benefited him greatly. Later, he had accumulated much in the Starlight Corridor, so he was now fully confident he could break through to the Third-Order Origin King Realm.

But he was not in a hurry.

After all, as newcomers that joined Blue Feather Sect, if his performance was too eye-catching, it would likely attract unnecessary trouble.

Therefore, Yang Kai chose to focus on allowing his body to absorb the starlight he had collected and transforming his Saint Qi into Source Qi instead, before striving for a breakthrough.

A few days later, Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun’s Identity Tokens were brought over by Kou Wu. With these Identity Tokens, the two of them had truly become disciples of the Blue Feather Sect, and besides a few restricted areas, they were free to walk around.

Yang Kai took this opportunity to tour around and get acquainted with a number of Blue Feather Sect’s disciples. Regardless of their temperaments, what Yang Kai was able to tell was that among the Origin Kings here, all of them were natives of the Star Boundary.

After some inquiries, Yang Kai learned some good information.

There was no Emperor Realm master in Blue Feather Sect!

There were only five Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators, of which, Bian Yu Qing was one.

This was similar to his original estimates. After learning that Bian Yu Qing was at the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, Yang Kai had figured that even if there was an Emperor here in Blue Feather Sect, there would be only one or two, and their cultivations wouldn’t be high!

Because a Protector of a Sect would normally represent the highest strength and combat power of that force.

In addition to Bian Yu Qing, there were four other Third-Order Dao Source Realm masters, one of whom was the Sect Master while the others were also Protectors. The four protectors each occupied one of the four main peaks in the Sect and generally did not interfere with one another’s affairs.
