Chapter 1878, Swaggering Away

“Senior, do you want me to continue?” Up in the air, Yang Kai, who had been silently confronting Kuang Shi Zong, suddenly smiled and asked with a leisurely expression, “If we continue this little show much longer, I am afraid Purple Star City will really be reduced to rubble... but, I suppose that’s fine too. Purple Star is so big and has thousands of cities, so even without Purple Star City, there are still others to stay in. En, maybe I should go visit those cities too. I believe I can see them all eventually if I have enough time...”

As soon as this remark came out, everyone from Purple Star trembled in fright.

If Yang Kai had said this before, most people would have laughed it off as some kind of wild joke, but after witnessing the destructive power of these strange creatures, no one dared to doubt Yang Kai’s ability anymore.

As long as he had enough patience, he could definitely level all of Purple Star with this strange army at his command!

Everyone looked at Kuang Shi Zong, and nine out of ten people had an imploring expression on their face.

They were truly frightened.

Although Yang Kai had been raising a big fuss, until now, he had not begun slaughtering people. If his hand was forced though, it wasn’t clear just how many of them would survive today.

“Enough!” Although Kuang Shi Zong felt deep anger in his heart, he still had to shout.

Yang Kai smiled slightly, “So, is Senior willing to discuss terms with me?”

“You win!” Kuang Shi Zong looked at Yang Kai with a sullen face and unforgettable hatred in his eyes, “Take those people and get out of my Purple Star quickly. If you dare to step into my Purple Star again in the future, this old master vows to kill you, no matter the cost.”

“Senior may rest assured, I won’t visit Purple Star ever again!” Yang Kai grinned, not caring one bit about Kuang Shi Zong’s threat. Anyone who had any intelligence knew that this was nothing more than empty posturing.

Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space and a Second-Order Origin King, so no one in the entire Star Field could kill him unless they managed to trap him inside a sealed space and then wore him down by sending multiple masters to face him one after another.

“This old master does not consider this matter over, and one day soon, this old master will go to the Water Moon Star in person to speak with Ai Ou,” Kuang Shi Zong looked at Yang Kai coldly as he emphasized every word.

Even now, he believed Yang Kai was a member of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce.

“Water Moon Star welcomes you any time!” Yang Kai smiled before turning to Shen Tu and saying, “Brother Shen Tu, everything has been settled, please leave first.”

“What about you?” Shen Tu frowned as he looked at Yang Kai, some faint worry on his face.

“I’ll stay here and watch them,” Yang Kai pointed down, “I’m afraid that if we try to leave together, they will try to intercept the Starship. Don’t worry, if I want to leave, they can’t stop me; I’ll join you later.”

Shen Tu thought about it for a moment before agreeing with this idea and simply cupping his fists and saying, “In that case, be careful, Brother Yang. I’ll be waiting for you aboard the Starship!”

Yang Kai nodded, “Be careful along the way.”

Shen Tu left without looking back together while the other cultivators from Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce also nodded to Yang Kai to express their gratitude before quickly following.

Down below, Xiao Xiao reverted to his small and harmless appearance and shouldered his Heaven Shaking Pillar before chasing after Shen Tu and the others, seemingly having been ordered by Yang Kai to escort them to safety.

The many masters of Purple Star stood still, not daring to act rashly, only able to watch these few Origin Returning Realm cultivators fly off right from under their noses.

A look of humiliation appeared on all their faces as they gazed hatefully towards Yang Kai.

“You’re quite the cautious one, boy,” Kuang Shi Zong suddenly said.

“Senior is too kind, it is only normal to act cautiously under such circumstances,” Yang Kai chuckled.

“The one that left just now and the one still down below, what are they? Why has this old master never encountered their kind before? Are they puppets or some kind of life form?” Kuang Shi Zong asked with squinting eyes.

“They’re living creatures, but from a very rare race. If Senior wants to find one, I’m afraid it would be a futile quest.”

Contrary to Kuang Shi Zong’s expectation, Yang Kai did not try to conceal anything, instead giving him clear and direct answers, “I obtained these two by chance and coincidence.”

Kuang Shi Zong nodded lightly before turning his attention to the twenty or so Blood Beasts with interest, “What about these? You’re not going to tell this old master these are living creatures too, are you?”

“They’re condensed through a certain Secret Technique. Does Senior want to learn it? If so, I can teach you if you want,” Yang Kai said with a harmless grin.

“Forget it!” Kuang Shi Zong coldly snapped, “This old master is afraid he won’t be able to pay the price!”

He also knew that Yang Kai was simply chatting with him to pass the time, so he simply took the opportunity to gather some intelligence. As for Yang Kai saying he would teach him this Secret Technique, he would no doubt put forward some ridiculous demands in exchange, so Kuang Shi Zong wouldn’t embarrass himself by asking.

“Alright then,” Yang Kai did not care and no longer spoke to Kuang Shi Zong.

Suddenly, Li Mao Ming stepped forward with a depressed expression, cupped his fists and called out, “Brother Yang, can you give me back my Blue Ice Flame?”

“Blue Ice Flame?” Yang Kai raised his eyes and looked at Liu Yan thoughtfully, knowing immediately what Li Mao Ming was referring to.

“En, that Blue Ice Flame is of great use to me, if I lose it...” Li Mao Ming looked embarrassed.

“Haha, Brother Li is addressing the wrong person, you’ll have to ask her if you want that thing back,” Yang Kai pointed his finger at Liu Yan.

“Brother Yang must be joking,” Li Mao Ming’s mouth twitched, “Although this Li cannot see what kind of existence that is, it’s obvious that you are its master. Retrieving the Blue Ice Flame from it would only take a word from Brother Yang... Good, I can exchange it for an Origin King Grade artifact, what do you say?”

The condition put forward by Li Mao Ming was quite reasonable, so Yang Kai thought about it for a moment before saying, “Then I’ll ask for you.”

“Many thanks, Brother Yang.”

Yang Kai turned his head to look at Liu Yan and asked, “You heard what was said just now, could you return that blue flame? If you agree, just nod, if you refuse, shake your head.”

Liu Yan cast a sidelong glance at Yang Kai before turning her gaze aside indifferently.

Yang Kai saw this and smirked, “Brother Li, as you can see, she has a bit of a bad temper and probably doesn’t want to return it.”

“This...” Li Mao Ming was speechless.

At that moment, a Starship rose up into the sky from nearby and soon began to accelerate away at an extremely rapid rate, breaking through the clouds soon after and sailing towards the distant Starry Sky.

Seeing this scene, Yang Kai cupped his fists and said, “Everyone, this Yang will say his goodbyes here, perhaps we shall meet again on some distant mountain or field!”

Saying so, he recalled his Blood Beast Army, Liu Yan, and his Embodiment before his figure flickered and he chased after the Starship.

“Brother Yang, please wait! My Blue Ice Flame!” Li Mao Ming cried out pitifully but received no response.

“Martial Ancestor, are we just going to let him leave like this?” Gong Sun Liang stood beside Kuang Shi Zong and asked despondently.

Today’s battle not only brought great shame to Purple Star, but also to Gong Sun Liang personally. In this battle, he had suffered extremely heavy losses and did not want to let things end miserably.

Kuang Shi Zong heard these words but did not answer immediately, his eyes smouldering with a burning light, as if hesitating whether to take this opportunity to pursue or not.

“Not good, not good!” Suddenly a panic-stricken shout rang out and everyone turned to see a panicked Ji Jun, the one who had always been assisting Zi Wu Ji, run out.

“Old Ji, what happened?” Zi Wu Ji did his best to ignore the pain he was feeling and asked.

“Second Young Master, that Venerable Yang ransacked the entire Purple Star Vault!” Ji Jun shouted loudly.

“What?” Zi Wu Ji and Kuang Shi Zong’s faces changed drastically at the same time while everyone else present was filled with furious indignation.

“How did that surnamed Yang enter the Purple Star Vault? Where did he get the key? Who led him to it?”

“So that’s how it is, I was wondering why Second Young Master suddenly removed all the guards from around the Vault today, so it was for this reason!” Gong Sun Liang looked at Zi Wu Ji grimly, “Were you colluding with him all along?”

“I...” Zi Wu Ji felt his chest tighten as he suddenly found that he was unable to even make a convincing argument, only uttering anxiously, “He said he only wanted a single thing, how was I supposed to know he would be so insatiable? Even so, I made Old Ji follow him to monitor it.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Becoming the focus of everyone’s attention once again, Ji Jun looked down in shame and muttered, “I was knocked out by him and did not awaken until just now...”

“You waste!” Kuang Shi Zong roared furiously as he waved his hand and sent out a surge of power that knocked Zi Wu Ji into a nearby wall, his life or death completely uncertain, before shouting, “Pursue him! No matter the cost, we must kill that boy in the Starry Sky today!”

“Yes!” Receiving their orders, everyone used their Movement Skills to fly off in a certain direction.

A short time later, more than a dozen Origin Grade High-Rank Starships were launched above Purple Star City, with a single Origin King Grade Starship leading the way, all of them soaring up into the Starry Sky a moment later.

The others may not know what kind of treasures were stored in Purple Star’s Vault, but how could Kuang Shi Zong not know?

Almost all the items inside weren’t of too much consequence and could be replaced given enough time, but that True Dragon Scale was a priceless treasure that had been in Purple Star’s possession since its founding. For thousands of years, the geniuses of Purple Star had tried to refine that Dragon Scales for their own use, with even Kuang Shi Zong having tried once, but none had succeeded so far.

In the end, it could only be stored away in the Vault.

Although no one could refine that Dragon Scale, it did not mean it had no value. On the contrary, its value was immeasurable.

Now that the Dragon Scale had been stolen by Yang Kai, how could Kuang Shi Zong let him simply swagger away? Now things had really developed to the point where either Yang Kai died, or he died.

All of Purple Star City had felt the shocking effects of today’s events. The fallout from the battle between so many Origin Kings had made many weaker cultivators panic, and now, seeing so many Starships set sail together, even a fool would know that something big had just happened to Purple Star.

However, no one knew the truth behind what was going on.

In the Starry Sky, Yang Kai quickly caught up with the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce Starship, and after sending a quite Divine Sense Message, its hatch was opened, and he flew inside where he found Shen Tu waiting for him together with everyone else.

“Brother Yang!” Shen Tu cupped his fists and with a solemn expression declared, “This Shen Tu will not forget this grace for the rest of his life. If Brother Yang has need of this Shen Tu’s assistance in any way in the future, he only needs to ask.”

Yang Kai laughed lightly, “Brother Shen Tu is too serious, we’re all one family so there’s no need to be so polite.”

[We’re all one family?] A trace of doubt flashed across Shen Tu’s face, but he did not think about it too much and just assumed Yang Kai was being polite with him.

However, Yang Kai being able to say this made him incredibly happy as it made it clear that Yang Kai did not despise him just because his strength had grown far beyond his.
