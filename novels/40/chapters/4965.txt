This was not impossible, for even the prototype Purifying Black Ink Battleship was equipped with a Universe Array. If Yang Kai really came back, he would be inside the cabin.

With that in mind, Feng Yin teleported in through the Space Array on the deck.

However, all she could see was white in the cabin; the gentle Purifying Light flowed around her body like warm water, but there was no sign of Yang Kai in this empty space.

He obviously had not returned.

Feng Ying left the cabin, now more suspicion than ever. She was perplexed when she unexpectedly noticed a stream of light that had abruptly fallen on the deck from a distance. She fixed her eyes upon him and hurriedly bowed, “Martial Uncle Zhong!”

The person who came was Zhong Liang.

“Where is Yang Kai?” Zhong Liang questioned nervously with an ashen face.

Feng Ying replied, “He said that he made some modifications to the Universe Array and needed to test it out, so he left.”

“How long has he been gone?” Zhong Liang’s expression sank.

“Less than an hour.” As soon as she said that, Feng Ying understood that something was off. Similar experiments were conducted by Yang Kai in the past, but each time he returned quite quickly. He was experimenting with the Universe Array after all, so all he needed to do was to distance himself a little from here and perform the Universe Transference Law to return. How was it even possible for him to take this long this time? The Inner Sanctum had nothing to delay him either.

“Damn it, it really is him!” Zhong Liang exclaimed. He had hurried back from the front line immediately to investigate the matter himself as soon as he received a message from the Fourth Division Mountain Battalion, wondering whether there had been a mistake; after all, why would Yang Kai suddenly sneak out? But after he arrived here, he realised that there was no mistake, Yang Kai had indeed snuck out.

Upon hearing that, Feng Ying asked, “Martial Uncle, is something wrong?”

Zhong Liang ground his teeth in frustration for a moment before sighing in exasperation and muttering, “That brat went out to the battlefield.”

“What?” Feng Ying was shocked when she heard his words, “Why would he go out to the battlefield?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“How would I know!?” Zhong Liang looked over at the main gate, worried, “I hope we’re not too late.”

After receiving the call from the Fourth Division Mountain Battalion, Zhong Liang rushed to the Inner Sanctum to investigate the matter while also ordering Mountain Battalion to turn back. Before making sure whether the person was Yang Kai, he preferred to err on the side of caution.

However, the battlefield was always in chaos, and Zhong Liang was unsure if the Mountain Battalion would be able to carry out his orders; after all, returning from the front lines was not always simple. If they were surrounded by the Black Ink Clan Army, they would have to kill their way out.

Feng Ying stood there dumbfounded. Yang Kai actually entered the battlefield. What did this brat intend to do? Furthermore, he didn’t even let her know beforehand. It was just truly absurd.

Feng Ying followed closely behind. Zhong Liang had assigned her to protect Yang Kai at all times, but the latter had deceived her and escaped. She needed to be responsible for this.

“No,” Feng Ying shook her head. She was also perplexed by this series of events, but it was clear that Yang Kai had planned this whole thing out; otherwise, he wouldn’t have to lie and claim that he wanted to go test the Universe Array to get past the gates.

“Has there been anything unusual about his recent behaviour?” Zhong Liang asked again.

Feng Ying responded in shock, “Martial Uncle are you suspecting that he… “

“He has the ability to cleanse and remove Black Ink Strength, and he has a World Spring. He has helped thousands over these past few months, and he led the effort to build the Purifying Black Ink Battleships, which is of great significance to us. I don’t think it’s possible to doubt his loyalty. He should not intend any harm by his action towards Blue Sky Pass or the Human Race. I simply don’t understand why he had to quietly leave. You spent months with him. Didn’t you notice anything?”

Suddenly recalling something, Feng Ying scowled, “Martial Uncle, if I’m not mistaken, he is trying to break through to the Seventh-Order!”

“What?”

“When he initially arrived at Blue Sky Pass, he inquired about advancing to the Seventh-Order. Later, after treating several Seventh-Order Masters, he would ask them about their breakthrough experiences. I asked whether he was getting ready for his own breakthrough and he frankly admitted that he had reached the peak of the Sixth-Order and was just looking for an opportunity to reach the Seventh-Order. You are also aware that advancing to the Seventh-Order is different for everyone. There are some who retreat to cultivate in seclusions, there are some who have accumulated over a long period of time and simply break through naturally, and then there are those who break through in life-or-death crises in battle. Yang Kai said that he tried entering retreat, but failed. He also said only the Heavens would know when he would succeed using the accumulation method. Since these two methods are useless to him, I’m afraid that he wants to try using the last one to make a breakthrough. Otherwise, he wouldn’t even have to go to the battlefield at a moment like this.”

When Zhong Liang heard the words, his face twitched, “That must be it!”

Judging by his actions, that brat must have had this idea for a long time now. He also understood that Blue Sky Pass placed an extremely high value on his own existence; therefore, he had to sneak out because he knew that they would never allow him to go to the battlefield.

After working hard to build the Purifying Black Ink Battleships and leaving enough Purifying Light to support the four Armies for this war though, Yang Kai clearly decided it was his chance to go out and seek battle.

As he began to understand this, Zhong Liang suddenly thought of something and gasped, “Oh no…”

“What’s wrong, Martial Uncle?”

“That brat is probably mentally prepared to not return; otherwise, there would be no need for him to leave so much Purifying Light behind. He’s made up his mind to succeed or die trying and cut off all responsibilities to ensure he doesn’t hesitate!” Zhong Liang replied with an ashen expression.

Feng Ying’s heart clenched. If this was the case, then she would surely be punished for failing her duties, because she didn’t even notice the signs despite being with Yang Kai for such a long time.

Zhong Liang abruptly halted their conversation and pulled out a communication artifact. After swiftly exchanging a few messages, he cursed, “That little bastard!”

Feng Ying turned to look at him.

Zhong Liang ground his teeth and said, “That brat is too slippery. He must have realised that Mountain Battalion was suspicious of him, so he actually escaped from their warship before it could retreat! Mountain Battalion currently can’t locate him either!”

“Ah!” Feng Ying’s face suddenly paled. Yang Kai was just a Sixth-Order cultivator, yet he plunged into the battlefield alone. He would definitely be in grave danger if he did not receive support soon!

“I’ll tan that boy’s hide red once I drag him back!” Zhong Liang angrily roared. Yang Kai knew that he was vital to the Human Race as a whole, yet he dared to take such a risk. How would he explain to the Old Ancestor if anything happened to him?

The Old Ancestor was still recovering in retreat, totally unaware of Yang Kai’s existence, but this incident would definitely have to be reported to him afterward. Zhong Liang would also be blamed if the key to victory for the entire Human Race over the Black Ink Clan encountered an accident right under his nose. At the very least, he would be stripped of his position as the Western Army’s Commander.

“Martial Uncle, Yang Kai… he’s not weak.” Having worked with Yang Kai to fight their way back from the Black Ink Clan’s domain, Feng Ying knew that Yang Kai’s strength was far beyond that of a typical Sixth-Order Master, and he could even assume his Grand Dragon form, which put him on par with a Seventh-Order Master.

“It makes no difference how powerful he is, how could one man stand against the Black Ink Clan army!?” Even Seventh-Order and Eighth-Order Masters perished on the battlefield, not to mention Yang Kai, a Junior in the Sixth-Order. Zhong Liang also knew about Yang Kai’s ability to transform into a Grand Dragon, which at the time, would give him Seventh-Order strength. However, Yang Kai wanted to seize this chance to break through in a life and death struggle, so he would certainly not use his Dragon Clan strength as doing so would become a mental crutch, leaving no possibility for him to use this method to achieve a breakthrough again in the future.

Zhong Liang was now merely praying that Yang Kai would not approach the Black Ink Clan Army’s core or show off his Purifying Light Secret Technique.

The last time Yang Kai used Purifying Light offensively, he instantly injured a Black Ink Territory Lord, giving Feng Ying an opportunity to kill him.

The Black Ink Clan wouldn’t think too much of it if it was only used once; but, if Purifying Light was used repeatedly, the Black Ink Clan would eventually become aware that it was the nemesis of their Black Ink Strength. Once they realized that, they would spare no effort to eliminate Yang Kai and would almost certainly succeed.

The Black Ink Clan would take whatever necessary measures to execute Yang Kai.

The both of them had hurried out of Blue Sky Pass while they were conversing, but once they were outside, all they saw was the raging battle between the two Races, with thousands of figures flying about everywhere. How were they to locate Yang Kai in this tangled mess?

Zhong Liang’s expression turned dark, and he quickly sent out a message.

Meanwhile, aboard the warship belonging to the Fourth Division Mountain Battalion on the front lines of the battlefield, the Battalion Commander frowned.

After rushing out to the battlefield to confront the Black Ink Clan, Yang Kai used the excuse of performing his secret mission to open the ship’s shields and instantly escape.

Naturally taken by surprise, Mountain Battalion hastily closed the shield to stop any Black Ink Strength on the battlefield from flowing in.

The Battalion Commander also received an order from the Fourth Division’s Commander shortly after, asking him to keep Yang Kai under strict supervision for the time being and immediately return to the Inner Sanctum.

But this message was received too late. Yang Kai had already left and was nowhere to be seen.

There was no other option than to report this issue. As a result, the Division Commander reprimanded him severely, which aggrieved the Seventh-Order Battalion Commander.

Full of grievances and nowhere to vent, he could only let it out on the Black Ink Clan. The warship shuttled back and forth, beams of light blasting out as they rammed into the Black Ink Clan Army, killing many as they went.

Soon after, a group of Seventh-Order Masters from the Battalion leapt out of the ship, activated their Secret Techniques and artifacts, and cut a swath through the surrounding enemies.

This was how the Human Race and Black Ink Clan fought.

Seventh-Order Masters were free to enter the battlefield at their own discretion, while those below the Seventh-Order had to rely on the might of their warships. Both Battalions and Squads worked in this fashion to attack and defend on the battlefield.

Meaning, elsewhere on the battlefield, Yang Kai wielded his Azure Dragon Spear recklessly, slaughtering Black Ink Clansmen wherever he went.

One reason he was currently invincible against his opponent was due to his own strength, but the more important point was that strength of those in the Black Ink Clan Army was really quite diverse, with many Black Ink Clansmen simply being too weak for Yang Kai to have any trouble with.

This was much unlike the Cave Heavens and Paradises, who only sent Sixth-Order Masters or above to the Black Ink Battlefield. In fact, the only reason there were Fifth-Order Human Masters present at all is because their cultivation had regressed from the Sixth-Order after they repeatedly sacrificed parts of their Small Universes.
