Chapter 3059, Shocking Events on Dragon Island

‘Dragon Punishment’ was the most effective way to destroy a Dragon Source, which was why it was one of the most forbidden of Dragon Clan’s techniques.

Earlier, when Yang Kai threatened to die together with Fu Chi, the Second Elder could still accept it despite her fury; however, what Yang Kai was about to do wasn’t something she was willing to see. A Dragon Clan member could lose their life, but the Source could never be allowed to be destroyed!

“Stop right there!” Zhu Yan roared, his expression turning black.

Yang Kai really stopped what he was doing as the ancient syllables ceased. As for the Thunder Dragon which was being separated from Fu Chi, it appeared slightly relieved as well.

“Great Elder, what else do you have to say?” Yang Kai asked in a serious voice as he forced his racing heartbeat to moderate. Although he appeared very reckless, he wouldn’t want to lose his life unless he had no choice. Fortunately, the Great Elder was willing to extricate him from this difficult situation by stepping forward at the right moment. Otherwise, Yang Kai wasn’t even sure if he should continue on with this suicidal path.

Things had come to a point where Yang Kai had no way out anymore. He either had to negotiate with the Dragon Clan and pay a hefty price to leave with Zhu Qing or fight with them until the end. The second scenario wasn’t what he hoped to see. As for the first scenario, he was prepared to make a huge sacrifice.

Seeing that Yang Kai had stopped the Dragon Punishment, Zhu Yan heaved a sigh of relief. Since this young man had obtained the Dragon Clan’s inheritance, and the Ancestral Dragon Source had acknowledged him and integrated with him, he couldn’t be regarded as just a Human anymore. Hence, it was useless for the Dragon Clan members to continue being so haughty in front of him.

After giving it a thought, Zhu Yan decided to say something, but just then, a sudden change shocked everyone.

A deafening buzz could be heard in the far distance, as though the entire world was shaking. Following that, a beam of light exploded and shot up into the sky. The World Energy around them kept trembling, causing everyone to feel uneasy.

The Dragon Clan’s three Elders turned their heads and looked at the source of the noise. The next moment, they turned pale at the same time.

The Second Elder Fu Zhun shouted, “Oh, no!”

Upon finishing her words, she leapt into the air and flew towards that direction at the speed of lightning. In the blink of an eye, she disappeared from everyone’s sight as she had no time to deal with Yang Kai anymore.

Hundreds of Humans were dumbfounded at the sudden change. Even Yang Kai appeared shocked as he darted his gaze around.

No one knew the reason the Second Elder left in such a hurry. Supposedly, what was going on in this place would badly affect the Dragon Clan’s honour and dignity; after all, it was deplorable of Yang Kai to try to snatch the Dragon bride on the wedding day. The Second Elder also appeared domineering as she threatened that the Dragon Clan would fight with Yang Kai until one of them died. It could be said that this was a grudge that could never be resolved.

So, what happened in the distance that made a Master like Fu Zhun turn so pale and fly off in such a panic? She even stopped caring about Yang Kai and went to handle this other matter immediately. Apparently, something shocking had happened on Dragon Island.

It was hard for everyone to wrap their heads around this idea. Then, they shifted their attention to the other Elders and realized that both Zhu Yan and Zhu Kong appeared solemn, as though they were faced with a formidable enemy.

They didn’t even show this kind of emotion on their faces when Yang Kai tore Fu Chi’s arms off just now.

On the other hand, the other Dragon Clan members appeared uneasy as they had their own speculation.

“Qing’er, where is that place? What is going on?” Yang Kai secretly communicated to Zhu Qing via Divine Sense. Feeling excited, he could sense that this might be their chance to leave.

Of the three Dragon Clan’s Elders, the Second Elder Fu Zhun was the hardest to deal with. If it weren’t because she was so unreasonable, Yang Kai wouldn’t have done such an outrageous thing, so now that she had left, Yang Kai was certainly elated.

With the Second Elder out of the way, they could talk it out with the other Elders, Zhu Yan and Zhu Kong, in a peaceful manner. After all, they were from the Zhu Clan of the Dragon Clan, so they were biased towards Zhu Qing, which was evident from their attitude just now.

Upon hearing Yang Kai’s question, Zhu Qing replied, “The Dragon Grave. That place is the Dragon Grave. It seems that something has happened there.”

“The Dragon Grave?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

Certainly, he knew what kind of place the Dragon Grave was. It was somewhere the Dragon Clan members would go before their death, so it was their Restricted Area. Previously, the main reason Zhu Qing went to the Frozen Earth was to look for the lost Dragon Source so she could bring it back to the Dragon Grave.

[Since the Dragon Grave is the cemetery for the Dragon Clan, what could have possibly happened there? The Second Elder even left the place in a hurry without saying anything. How strange…]

Zhu Qing didn’t know the reason either, as she just knew that something must have happened to the Dragon Grave.

While Yang Kai and Zhu Qing were having a chat in secret, the Great Elder and the Fourth Elder were communicating with each other as well. After Zhu Yan finished speaking, Zhu Kong suddenly turned solemn.

Yang Kai darted his gaze around before he raised his head and uttered, “Great Elder, Fourth Elder, I know I’m in the wrong today, but I have no other choice. I’m doing this because I care about Qing’er’s happiness, so I hope that you two will forgive me.”

His conflict with the Dragon Clan was mainly because of the Second Elder Fu Zhun. Now that she was gone, Yang Kai could possibly leave with Zhu Qing if he managed to persuade the Great Elder and the Fourth Elder to let them go.

However, he wasn’t sure if the Dragon Clan was willing to let him off, so he was both restless and apprehensive.

Hearing his words, Zhu Yan and Zhu Kong were torn between exasperation and laughter as they stared at Yang Kai.

Earlier, Yang Kai appeared unwavering when he confronted the Second Elder, as though he was determined to fight with Fu Zhun until the end to prove his love for Zhu Qing. Now that Fu Zhun was gone though, Yang Kai decided to negotiate. It seemed that he was a man who understood the concept of give and take.

With a grim expression, Zhu Yan uttered, “You’ve wounded our fellow clansman and damaged the Dragon Clan’s honour. You can’t get away with it by just claiming that you had no choice.”

Yang Kai raised his brow and refuted, “What do you want then, Great Elder? I’m sure you’re aware of Qing’er’s stance, so you should stop forcing her to get married to Fu Chi and stop lying to yourselves as well. Fu Chi is a Dragon Clan member, so is Zhu Qing. You should think about her well-being.”

Zhu Yan shook his head, “You’re right, but things have come to a point where there won’t be a good ending anymore.”

Yang Kai’s expression turned dark, “Since you’ve said so, I have no choice but to fight with you. If I offend you in any way, please forgive me.” His attitude towards the Great Elder was starkly different from when he dealt with the Second Elder.

He had completely offended Fu Zhun. So, if there was a chance for a turning point, he wasn’t willing to offend the Great Elder.

“Supposedly, you should be killed because you’ve humiliated the Dragon Clan and harmed Fu Chi,” Zhu Yan uttered and then shifted his focus, “However, as your Senior, I’m unwilling to bully you. Otherwise, the Dragon Clan’s reputation might be further damaged.”

Yang Kai’s gaze brightened as he asked, “Great Elder, what do you mean?”

“Release Fu Chi, and I won’t deal with you.”

“Are you serious?” Yang Kai was elated upon hearing that. Of all the Dragon Clan members, he was most wary of the Great Elder and the Second Elder, as they were both as powerful as Great Emperors. Now that the Second Elder was gone, he could just leave Dragon Island as he pleased if the Great Elder wouldn’t make a move against him. It would be difficult for the Fourth Elder to make him stay.

At that instant, Yang Kai found the Great Elder to be quite amiable, and even the latter’s solemn expression appeared warmer now. [He’s from the Zhu Clan of the Dragon Clan, after all, so he’s still biased towards Zhu Qing, which is why he’s trying to let her go.]

“Great Elder, you’re a man of your word, so I definitely believe you.” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly with a joyful expression.

The hundreds of Humans couldn’t help rolling their eyes. [He appeared suspicious of the Great Elder just now, but in the blink of an eye, he’s now praising him that he’s a man of his word!]

“Release him, then.” Zhu Yan shot him a dispassionate glance.

Without hesitation, Yang Kai tossed Fu Chi forward. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Fu Chi had turned completely pale because he had lost both his arms. He thought that he would certainly lose his life on this day, but he didn’t expect that he would be brought back from death’s door. After he landed on the ground, he picked up his torn arms and dashed off towards a certain direction.

He didn’t dare to stay there as he just wanted to look for a place to recuperate. Although his arms had been torn off by Yang Kai, as a member of the Dragon Clan, he was naturally tough, so he just needed some time to recover from the injuries.

Before he left, he shot Yang Kai a glare, as he was determined to get his revenge one day. He was an Eighth-Order Thunder Dragon and he felt that if it weren’t because Yang Kai made a sudden move by creating a diversion, he wouldn’t have been subdued by Zhu Qing so easily. Having suffered such a setback, there was no way he could forgive them.

He was injured right in front of so many people, and Zhu Qing had been snatched away from him. He would no longer be Fu Chi if he could tolerate it.

Hidden among the crowd, Li Jiao appeared grim and conflicted as he watched Fu Chi flee.

When Yang Kai taught Fu Chi a lesson by tearing off his arms, Li Jiao was extremely gleeful. If it weren’t for Fu Chi, Lu San Niang wouldn’t have endured hardship for hundreds of years. He hoped that Yang Kai would kill Fu Chi on the spot.

However, Yang Kai had come to an agreement with the Great Elder to let Fu Chi go, and while Li Jiao was disappointed, he also felt glad. He was disappointed that Fu Chi had escaped from his punishment, but at the same time, he was glad that Yang Kai didn’t kill him as the only way he could truly dispel the hatred in his heart was to kill Fu Chi himself, so the fact that Fu Chi had managed to survive had given Li Jiao a chance to get his revenge on his own.

However, in the end, Fu Chi was an Eighth-Order Thunder Dragon. Although he was severely injured at the moment, Li Jiao was still no match for him. He only had a Third-Order Mid-Rank Dragon Vein, so there was no way he could defeat an Eighth-Order Dragon, unless he could upgrade his bloodline.

At that moment, Li Jiao was racking his brain about what he could do to kill Fu Chi. He knew full well the consequences of killing a member of the Dragon Clan; however, as a man, he should determine for himself the things he should and should not do.

While he was hesitating, Fu Chi had disappeared from everyone’s sight.

Besides Li Jiao, there was another person among the crowd who stared fixedly in the direction Fu Chi was fleeing. That person had a greedy light flash across the depths of his eyes as a myriad of emotions swirled behind his gaze.

“I have released him, so I hope that you will keep your promise.” Yang Kai turned to look at Zhu Yan.

Zhu Yan nodded his head, “Of course I won’t go back on my word.”

Upon finishing his words, he shot a look at Zhu Kong before flying off rapidly.

Judging from the direction he was heading, he was headed for the Dragon Grave as well, and his speed was comparable to that of the Second Elder. In just a short moment, he disappeared from everyone’s sight.

Upon that revelation, the crowd broke into a commotion.
