“Good, it’s good that you’ve achieved an ascension so that others will stop bothering you. En, enough chatting for now. Come visit me when you’re free. The two little ones miss you too.”

Yang Kai replied respectfully, “I’ll pay you a visit when I’m done with everything.”

The head then retracted as the fog swelled up and covered up any traces of it. Mao Zhe and the others felt as though they had just escaped from death’s door and their backs were all drenched in cold sweat.

“H-Husband, what was that?” Shu Mu Dan was pale as she leaned close to Hua Yong, as though she was trying to seek a sense of security.

Hua Yong gulped and said hesitantly, “Perhaps it was a turtle’s head?”

Shu Mu Dan was torn between laughter and tears, “Is there such a huge turtle in the world?” How gargantuan must his body be since his head was already so big?

“Bi Xi!” Mao Zhe said in a bitter voice as he looked at Yang Kai, “The Divine Dragon has nine sons, and Bi Xi bears a heavy load. I can’t believe that Bi Xi belongs to Void Land.”

Upon hearing that, all of them were flabbergasted.

Yang Kai said with a smile, “You’re indeed a knowledgeable man, Brother Mao. However, Senior Bi Xi doesn’t belong to Void Land per say. Instead, he’s carrying Void Land on his back. He had been asleep for countless years, and as time passed, a Spirit Province formed on his back, which was occupied by the predecessor of Void Land. Fortunately, Senior is a kind and benevolent man who doesn’t have the heart to kill, so he has allowed us to remain.”

The corners of Mao Zhe’s brow twitched while Hua Yong gulped and asked in a raucous voice, “Senior Bi Xi carries Void Land on his back?”

This piece of news was shocking to him. Divine Spirits were famous and powerful creatures. Every mature Divine Spirit was as formidable as a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master. For an ancient Divine Spirit like Bi Xi, he was probably stronger than the average Eight-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

Since Void Land rested on his back, there was no way Bi Xi would sit back and do nothing should an existential crisis come to the Spirit Province. In other words, the presence of such a Divine Spirit was the greatest protection Void Land could have.

What puzzled Hua Yong was why Bi Xi was so cordial to Yang Kai. For such a formidable presence like him, he probably had no regard for anyone in the entire 3,000 Worlds.

On the other hand, a glint flashed through Mao Zhe’s eyes as he fell into his thoughts. Previously, Yang Kai had used his Dragon Transformation to destroy Profound Yang Mountain, which made Mao Zhe believe that he was a member of the Dragon Clan.

Now, it was obvious to him that Bi Xi’s attitude might have something to do with this. After all, Bi Xi had a Dragon Clan bloodline.

Void Land was a magnificent place with an extraordinary heritage, and it was close to a flourishing Star City, which ensured that they would never run out of resources. It was also protected by Bi Xi. It was probably the only Second Class great force in the entire 3,000 Worlds to have all these advantages.

Before coming to Void Land, all of them were wondering about what kind of place Void Land was and whether it could accommodate powerful people like them. If the heritage of Void Land was too shallow, it would only hinder the development of their potential as Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters.

However, upon their arrival, they realised that Void Land’s heritage was truly spectacular. They no longer dared to underestimate this place and instead felt honoured because they were now part of Void Land, at least in name.

The next moment, a gap appeared in the fog as two figures shot out through it and landed on the deck.

A pleasantly surprised Yue He stared fixedly at Yang Kai as she tried her hardest to suppress her excitement and saluted the man in an elegant manner, “Young Master!”

“Enough of that.” Yang Kai went over to hold her up and patted the back of her hand, “You must have been worried.”

Yue He shook her head, “I’m glad that you’ve returned safely.”

Behind her, Bai Qi looked around, but as the people he was yearning to see were nowhere to be found, he felt his heart sinking and asked anxiously, “Where is Proprietress and the others?”

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “Don’t worry, Proprietress and the others have returned as well. We parted ways halfway through because she had to head to Thousand Birds Star City.”

“Thousand Birds Star City…” Bai Qi’s expression turned milder when he heard that. He no longer felt apprehensive upon learning that the Proprietress and the others had returned safely. They were not around merely because they had parted ways with Yang Kai on the road here. Then, he quickly said, “I’ll go there now.”

“Proprietress told me to tell you to wait for her here. I’m guessing she’ll be coming over soon,” Yang Kai shouted at his back.

“I can’t wait that long!” Without turning his head, Bai Qi turned into a beam of light and shot into the distance. He could never set his mind at ease before seeing with his own eyes that the Proprietress was safe.

Seeing that Bai Qi was determined to leave, a helpless Yang Kai decided not to stop him and just watched him go.

On the deck, Mao Zhe and the others curiously examined Yue He. They had heard the woman call Yang Kai ‘Young Master’ just now but they were unable to discern her cultivation since her aura was fully withdrawn. However, they had a feeling that she was in the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm at the very least. Perhaps she was a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master just like them.

It was inconceivable that a woman with such cultivation would call Yang Kai ‘Young Master’. They couldn’t help but grow curious about Yang Kai’s background and suspected that he might have a powerful backer.

“Let’s go in for now,” Yang Kai ordered, then the ship continued moving towards Void Land.

The Grand Array had been opened as the disciples were fully aware of what was going on. No one would dare to stop the Sect Master from returning.

Before the ship even landed, Yang Kai, who was on the deck, saw a lot of people gathering together below. The person at the front was none other than the Second Manager of Void Land, Bian Yu Qing.

Soon, the ship landed and Yang Kai led the others to leap off the vessel.

The people who had gathered and had been waiting for quite some time, bowed in unison and shouted, “Welcome back, Sect Master!”

“Get up!” Yang Kai lifted his hand, “We’re all one family here, so there’s no need for such formalities.”

He swept a glance over them and realised that all the cultivators in the Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm and above from Void Land had gathered behind Bian Yu Qing. Even Mo Mei, who was stationed in the Star City, had returned.

All of them straightened up while Bian Yu Qing kept a faint smile on her face. Just when she was about to say something, a phantom-like figure abruptly appeared in front of Yang Kai. With her hands on her enchanting hips, she stared calmly at the man.

A shocked Yang Kai almost pushed out his fist, but upon realising who the person was, he took a few steps back with a helpless smile, “Senior Zhu!”

The person was none other than Zhu Jiu Yin.

Seeing that she was still in Void Land, Yang Kai was elated. Supposedly, the agreement between them had become invalid since she had escorted him all the way to the Shattered Heaven right before he entered the Shadowless Cave Heaven. In other words, she was no longer Yang Kai’s Protector and was now free to go wherever she wanted. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Some time ago, Yang Kai was still worried that this woman had really left.

It wouldn’t have mattered if she were to leave alone, but the problem was that Shan Qing Luo was cultivating under her now. If Zhu Jiu Yin really left, she would probably take Shan Qing Luo with her. By then, Shan Qing Luo wouldn’t be able to disobey her.

Seeing that she had stayed in Void Land, Yang Kai set his mind at ease. After giving it a thought though, he realised that even though she was a powerful Divine Spirit, she didn’t have anywhere else to go other than Void Land in the entire 3,000 Worlds; after all, she came from Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, and there was nowhere in the outside world that she was familiar with. Rather than wandering around aimlessly, she was better off just staying here.

Zhu Jiu Yin snorted, “It’s said that good people don’t live long while a scourge lasts a thousand years. I told you all that this brat wouldn’t die, but you wouldn’t believe me. Isn’t he back now?”

Bian Yu Qing replied with a fawning smile, “Yes, yes, yes. You’re absolutely right, Senior. We’ve been worried for no reason.”

“Hmph!” Zhu Jiu Yin snorted and shot a disdainful glance at Yang Kai. Then, after sweeping a casual glance over the people behind him, she vanished into thin air.

Yang Kai sported a helpless smile and bowed, “Good to see you too, Senior.”

Mao Zhe and the others were all stiff as boards as they were soaked in cold sweat once again.

They were unable to detect any signs before Zhu Jiu Yin’s appearance, and although the woman never released her aura, just a glance from her seemed capable of killing any one of them if she wanted. It was as though they had lost control over their own lives when she stood before them and they did not doubt that if she wanted one of them dead, they would be.

...

After a gulp, Mao Zhe asked in a hoarse voice, “Sir, who was that?”

Yang Kai placed his palm beside his mouth and said in a small voice, “She’s Heavenly Moon Demon Spider, Zhu Jiu Yin. That woman is pretty foul-tempered, so you should watch your words when you see her in the future.”

Audible gasps were instantly heard as they gazed at Yang Kai in disbelief, as though they were trying to figure out if he was joking with them. It was horrifying enough that Bi Xi was in Void Land, and now a Heavenly Moon Demon Spider was also around.

Although Bi Xi was undoubtedly more famous, he was known to be mild-tempered and amiable; therefore, when they saw Bi Xi earlier, other than being a little shocked, they weren’t too frightened. However, unlike Bi Xi, the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider was known to be a ferocious Divine Spirit that had no qualms about slaughtering people.

All of them felt like crying. When they thought about having to live alongside such a fierce Divine Spirit, they felt a crawling sensation on their scalps. The consequences would be dreadful if they accidentally offended her in the future.

“Ho? You dare badmouth this Queen behind her back, you smelly brat?! Don’t even dream about seeing Luo’er for the next ten years!” A voice boomed beside Yang Kai’s ears and shocked Mao Zhe and the others.

Yang Kai instantly sported a dejected expression, “It’s a misunderstanding, Senior! Please be magnanimous and forgive me!”

Naturally, Zhu Jiu Yin flat out ignored him.

Mao Zhe and the others looked sympathetically at him. Although they had no idea who this ‘Luo’er’ was, she should be someone important to him.

A crestfallen Yang Kai sighed, “I shouldn’t have opened my mouth. I was too foolish!”

Bian Yu Qing suppressed her laughter as she tried to change the subject, “Who are these people behind you, Sect Master?”

...

Yang Kai took a deep breath to cast away his dejectedness, then introduced them to her, “They have left the Shadowless Cave Heaven with me. Since they’re willing to join Void Land, we’re one family now.”

The eyes of Bian Yu Qing and the others lit up when they heard that. Bian Yu Qing was still too weak, so she was unable to determine these people’s exact strength; however, Mo Mei and the others could sense that the people behind Yang Kai were all strong.

Yang Kai briefly introduced them to each other. On Void Land’s side, there was Bian Yu Qing, Mo Mei, Yue He, Lu Xue, Pang Duo, Gong Yang Xi, Jin Yuan Lang, Mu Qian Xuan, and the other high-ranking members.

On the Shadowless Cave Heaven’s side, there was Mao Zhe, Geng Qing, Zhou Ya, Hua Yong, and Shu Mu Dan.

They saluted one another, and although they wouldn’t immediately become friendly with each other, it was only a matter of time before they became familiar. For now, they just needed to introduce themselves.
