Chapter 1100, Stopover

Shadowed Star was very different from other Cultivation Stars in that it had an incredibly strong gravity.

Yang Kai previously discovered that the larger the Cultivation Star, the greater the gravitational pull, there seemed to be a direct relationship between the two. The force of attraction Shadowed Star put out was particularly violent; incomparable to any other Cultivation Star Yang Kai had visited before.

Cultivating in this environment would result in greater benefits than other Cultivation Stars.

On top of that, the World Energy here wasn’t as thin as Yang Kai had expected. While it wasn’t as good as Rainfall Star or Water Moon Star, compared to Tong Xuan Realm, it was nothing short of paradise.

Yang Kai was quite satisfied with this place.

After struggling aimlessly through the Star Field for several years, Yang Kai felt he should find a place to settle down for a while and properly cultivate. Only when he was strong enough would he be able to act freely.

Wanting to find Su Yan in this vast Star Field was like finding a needle in a haystack.

But Yang Kai had come up with a feasible method to accomplish this, one he had successfully used before.

That was to make his name known, so that it echoed throughout the entire Star Field, that way, no matter where Su Yan was, she would be able to find him, drastically decreasing the amount of blind searching the two of them had to do.

Back on Tong Xuan Realm, Hu Jiao’er and He Mei’er had quickly been able to find Nine Heavens Holy Land and obtain Yang Kai’s help because of his great fame.

This process would take a long time, but it was much more reliable than flying about like a headless fly. Yang Kai was prepared to spend dozens or even hundreds of years to achieve this wish.

He doesn’t care about time, because no matter how long it was, he believed the bond between him and Su Yan would not weaken.

The same was true of Little Senior Sister. When Yang Kai was strong enough, he would return to Tong Xuan Realm and bring her and the rest of his loved ones out into the Star Field.

Shadowed Star would be the place where Yang Kai took the first steps on this endeavour.

After walking around the Hai Ke Family’s manor for a while, Yang Kai became somewhat bored and was just about to set out for Heavenly Fate City when he saw a Star Shuttle soar out from the grounds.

Yang Kai clearly saw Wu Yi’s figure standing on that Star Shuttle.

Thinking about it for a moment, Yang Kai summoned out his own Star Shuttle and followed after Wu Yi.

Yang Kai didn’t know what happened, but from Wu Yi’s look, he could tell she was in considerable distressed. Even flying a couple kilometres behind Wu Yi, Yang Kai could make out the sound of her sobs. Wu Yi didn’t seem to be flying aimlessly and after a while she landed on a barren mountain and sat down alone at its summit, curling her head down into her green dress as she held her knees with both her hands.

Yang Kai landed behind her but didn’t know how what to say to comfort her, so he simply stood there silently waiting for her to calm down.

Wu Yi’s delicate shoulders trembled, seemingly realizing that someone was approaching her, looking back to discover it was Yang Kai, then crying even louder.

Yang Kai immediately became more flustered.

It took a while, but eventually Wu Yi stopped crying and after wiping the corners of her eyes, she stared pitifully at Yang Kai and said, “Don’t tell anyone else!”

Yang Kai quickly nodded.

“It’s too unfair,” Wu Yi said, choking on her words, “So many of us died to collect that ore, yet after only a few words the family handed all of it over to that bastard Xie Hong Wen, not even preparing a decent reward for us!”

“Small families have the sad fates of small families, hasn’t this happened more than once or twice before?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Why do powerful people like to bully the weak? Is there no fairness or justice in this world? If I stood in a high position, I would never do such a thing,” Wu Yi shouted indignantly, venting the frustration in her heart, “Don’t they understand what chilling the hearts of the people mean? Once the will of the people runs cold, the family will be no more, why are they so short-sighted? Is acting so servile just to maintain their feeble existence worth it?”

“When you really stand in such a position, you may be able to appreciate that helplessness.”

“Which side are you on?” Wu Yi glared at Yang Kai in annoyance, angry that he was not agreeing with her.

Yang Kai quickly raised his hands, “Alright, alright, alright. You speak, I’ll just shut up and just listen.”

As if obtaining his permission freed her somehow, Wu Yi opened the floodgates and began talking about all the grievances and injustices she had suffered over the years, and regardless of whether Yang Kai was willing to or not, he was forced to listen to how her family was too weak, how Shadow Moon Hall was too overbearing, and how she felt such great frustration with her own weakness. She seemed to have endured a lot of pressure and torment.

After going on for quite some time, Wu Yi’s mood finally eased up, though her eyes were now swollen like peaches.

Turning to stare into Yang Kai’s eyes, she then asked, “Was that golden spear your doing?”

Yang Kai shook his head decisively.

This woman really had some suspicions; after all, she knew her subordinates’ abilities well, the only one she wasn’t clear about was Yang Kai who they had picked up halfway.

“It really wasn’t you?” Wu Yi seemed a little unconvinced, “Why do I always feel like you’re not as weak as you appear?”

Yang Kai had to admit that the intuition of this woman was quite terrifying, but he still smiled and said, “I am just a Third Order Saint, even if I have some hidden means, how much strength could I possibly display?”

Wu Yi stared at him for a moment before slowly shaking her head, “I don’t know, it’s just that when I face you, I can’t help feeling a sense of pressure. I have a feeling that If we were to fight, the one who would suffer defeat would be me, I believe my instincts.”

“You think too highly of me,” Yang Kai continued to deny, quickly changing the subject, “I actually came here to say goodbye to you.”

“Goodbye?” Wu Yi was stunned, “Where do you want to go? Do you know anyone on Shadowed Star?”

“No, but don’t try to recruit me, I won’t join your family.”

Wu Yi smiled, “Presumably my little family cannot enter your eyes. Although your cultivation isn’t high, in the end, you come from the outside and have clearly weathered your share of great storms. Good, so be it, if you insist on departing, I won’t try to detain you, but between us, we still have an agreement. Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten?”

“Of course I haven’t forgotten.”

“Then don’t leave,” Wu Yi stood up and stretched her waist exaggeratedly, letting out a sigh as she unconsciously showed off her fantastic body line, not even paying the weird look in Yang Kai’s eyes any mind, tapping her foot a few times and saying, “How about if I give you this barren mountain?”

“Give it to me?” Yang Kai was stunned.

“This Dragon Cave Mountain is part of my personal territory. It has a long history in my family, and although there are no precious treasures or rare ores, the World Energy here doesn’t lose out to other places. I often come here to enter secluded retreat. The scenery here is also very good. Yu Feng and his gang often come over as well. In any case, since you have nowhere to go, you might as well just stay here. If you want, from now on, this place is yours.”

Yang Kai frowned and observed Wu Yi for a while and after discerning that she wasn’t joking, he asked in surprise, “Are you really willing to just deliver me such a big piece of land?”

Wu Yi laughed playfully, “Clearly you don’t know, on Shadowed Star, such a piece of land isn’t worth anything at all. Shadowed Star is far too big, so even if my Hai Ke Family is just a tiny force, our territory stretches several thousand kilometres in every direction, what does a trivial mountain count as? Haven’t you encountered similar situations on other Cultivation Stars?”

Yang Kai nodded, realizing that such a piece of land was truly worthless on Shadowed Star.

“Why are you trying so hard to have me remain? You couldn’t have taken a liking to me, right?” Yang Kai became somewhat vigilant.

Wu Yi gawked for a moment before bursting into a fit of laughter.

Yang Kai’s face went dark, “What are you laughing at?”

Wu Yi waved her hands and said, “I know you have a lot of women, and those women like you, but you shouldn’t think too highly of yourself. I... I’m just thinking about supporting my family, I haven’t even considered the matters between men and women yet, but even if I did, I wouldn’t look at a man who already has many women.”

“That would be best,” Yang Kai snorted slightly, suddenly feeling a bit disgruntled.

“So it’s settled?” Wu Yi smiled at him.

“I’ll stay here for the time being. As you said, I have nowhere to go anyway,” Yang Kai shrugged.

“Actually, this place is quite good, Heavenly Fate City is only about fifty kilometres in that direction, so if you ever want to buy anything, it will be quite convenient. Right, you probably don’t have any living goods on you now; I’ll have Yu Feng bring some things over to help you set up some proper accommodations. You can live here with peace of mind. Don’t think too much about it, just treat it as a kind of stopover, when the day comes that I take command of the family, don’t try to back out!”

Yang Kai grinned and somewhat disagreed. He felt that it would take at least several dozen years for Wu Yi to take charge of the Hai Ke Family.

Yang Kai followed Wu Yi across a few mountains before coming to a deep cave where traces of someone sitting in meditative cultivation remained. Wu Yi explained that this was her handiwork.

The cave seemed quite deep and extended straight into the mountain belly. There was a small spring nearby that converged into a pool with crystal clear water inside the cave.

“The conditions here are somewhat harsh but it’s at least quiet and spacious. En, if you want, you can actually live in my house together with Yu Feng and the others.”

“No, this place is good,” Yang Kai shook his head. In any case, it was just a place to stay, so it didn’t really matter where it was. Although this cave was a bit solitary, the World Energy aura was far richer, making Yang Kai very satisfied.

“Then I’ll leave you to get familiar with this place. I have to go back, I still need to distribute the rewards I promised those guys,” Wu Yi said before flying off.

After Wu Yi left, Yang Kai carefully examined his new home.

Although the mountain spring ran through the cave, the environment was not humid or damp and was very suitable for living. This cave was formed naturally and was twisted and confused with no decent stone rooms carved out.

Releasing his Divine Sense, Yang Kai examined the surrounding thousand-kilometre radius and quickly discovered that what Wu Yi said was not an exaggeration, there were no spirit grasses, spirit medicines, or mineral lodes worthy of attention. Apart from the slightly rich World Energy aura, it was just a mountain.

No wonder she had given it away so freely.

Yang Kai knew that Wu Yi was trying to retain him because he had come from the outside and knew far more about it than anyone else she could come across. This was what Wu Yi valued the ​​most. As for his strength, she probably didn’t even think about it.

Wu Yi had great ambition to allow her family to rise to prominence, but Yang Kai also had a lofty goal, to become famous throughout the Star Field. The two had different aspirations, but both would need to work hard at them for many years to achieve results.

Yang Kai suddenly felt that this might be a good springboard, through the Hai Ke to Shadow Moon Hall, and then to Shadowed Star, then to the rest of the Star Field, he would promote his name. When that time came, he wouldn’t have to worry about Su Yan not knowing about him or coming to find him.

Thinking so, Yang Kai was suddenly filled with hope for the future.
