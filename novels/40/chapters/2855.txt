As twins, the two had been cultivating Shamanic Spells together for many years, and they had already reached the state of Heart Resonance. Therefore, although they only exchanged a simple glance, they clearly understood each other’s thoughts.

The Green Demon Poison was incurable, but since Shaman Niu mentioned that he would not die, he had no choice but to… VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“How much do you know about the Demon Race?” Yang Kai questioned again.

Yue kept her thoughts to herself and answered, “Not much. There is little information about them recorded in the ancient books. Other than the Green Demons, there are similar Red Demons. These two types of Demons were responsible for killing and maiming countless Barbarians in the last war.”

“Red Demons?” Yang Kai raised his brow and some funny figures surfaced in his mind, “Are they short and round with red skin and hair?”

“Perhaps…” Yue was not sure.

“What special abilities do the Red Demons have?”

Yue replied, “Red Demons are also called the Burst Demons. The only value and function of their existence is their explosive ability!”

“Are there really such Demons?” Yang Kai was taken aback. In the Demon Cave, Yang Kai did kill several red-skinned Demons, who were short, fat and round like a barrel. He did not feel anything when he killed them, and only learnt that they were born to explode after listening to Yue’s explanation.

Thinking about it, if they encountered an army of Red Demons without knowing about this in advance, the Barbarian Race would definitely suffer a great loss once the Red Demons got too close.

This was another extremely crucial piece of intelligence.

However, the only thing the sisters Yue and Lu knew about the Demon Race were Red Demon and Green Demon, they had no idea about anything else, not even the Sand Demons.

Therefore, they failed to provide Yang Kai with a lot of information for reference.

On the contrary, Yang Kai found out a lot of information after his trip to the Demon Cave. He disclosed everything he saw to the Shamans and asked them to inform the others, so that the clansmen could watch out for these Demons in the future.

After that, Yang Kai found an empty place, lifted his hand, and summoned a huge black figure.

It was the Demon Beast that Yang Kai had abducted from the Demon Cave.

The dark aura lingering on its body was constantly spilling out, and as soon as it appeared here, it roared, startling the dozen Shamans. They looked at the Demon Beast in disbelief, and then looked back at Yang Kai. They had no idea how he could make such a large thing appear out of thin air.

Yang Kai cast a few restrictions on the Demon Beast to seal its strength and movement. Therefore, despite its fierce appearance, it could do no harm.

“The Demon Race seems to have cavalry too, and this Demon Beast seems to be a typical mount. Study it and see if you can find any of its weaknesses. It would be best if you can find something useful, but it’s fine if you can’t just kill it directly.”

After leaving an order, Yang Kai walked to a newly built wooden house.

The group of Shamans immediately surrounded the Demon Beast and started to study it with great interest.

Time passed as Yang Kai stayed in the wooden house and did not appear for two days. No one knew what he was doing while the three thousand strong army was full of anger and fighting spirit, but with no place to vent.

In the Demon Cave, Sha Ya sat on her throne, her tight and revealing clothes showcasing the exquisite details of her beautiful figure. It was unknown what kind of Secret Technique she used, but the ‘peak’ Yang Kai had destroyed a few days ago had fully recovered and regained its majesty again.

At this moment, she was resting her chin on her palm, as if she was taking a nap.

The short Demon stood quietly below the throne, exuding no aura, like a dead man.

After a long while, Sha Ya opened her eyes and asked faintly, “What’s going on over there? Why hasn’t he come yet?”

The short Demon immediately replied, “According to the Sand Demons investigation, the Foreign Race gathered over there seem a little emotionally unstable. As for that guy, he has been in hiding the whole time and did not do anything special.”

Sha Ya sneered, “It seems that he is trying to expel the Green Demon Poison. How ridiculous. If the Green Demon Poison could be so easily cured, it will not be the trickiest poison of our Demon Race. However, I’m impressed that he can endure for two days and still not give up.”

She stood up and continued with her sharp eyes, “Pass down my order. Prepare to move out.”

The short Demon was stunned, “Madam, are we going to fight them?”

Sha Ya sneered, “Since he doesn’t want to come to me, then I’ll go to him. It’s rare to find such an interesting slave. I don’t want him to die just for nothing.”

After hearing this, the short Demon could not help feeling some pity for the scrawny Barbarian, but he still turned around and went to relay the order.

In an instant, the Demon Cave was filled with Ancient Demon Qi as many Demons gathered.

An hour later, fifty kilometres away, Shaman Niu Clan clansmen suddenly felt a strange rumbling from the ground, and at the same time, the Aerial Cavalry patrolling in the sky sounded their horns.

The Earth-shaking sound resounded across the world as all three thousand Barbarian Warriors looked solemn and took up their weapons one after another.

Yang Kai’s body was still glowing green, but he quickly walked out of the wooden house and looked over towards where the Demon Cave was located. The sky over the cave was now dark, as if it was on the eve of a storm, and this darkness was rushing over quickly, seemingly swallowing the light wherever it passed.

The corner of Yang Kai’s mouth curved up as he sneered.

The dozen Shamans standing in front of the three thousand warriors looked over at him with anxiety.

Yang Kai had been poisoned by the Green Demon Poison for two days, and although he appeared to be fine now, who knew when he would succumb? A battle was about to begin, so what if he was affected by the green poison and suddenly died?

In such a fight, once one side’s leader was killed, it would be a massive blow to morale. It may turn a certain victory into a tragic defeat in an instant.

But at this critical moment, no matter how worried they were, none dared to ask. They could only pray secretly in their hearts, while even Yue and Lu had prepared for the worst.

Yang Kai swept his eyes across the dozen Shamans, then across his three thousand warriors. After taking a deep breath, he shouted loudly, “Standing here are the most elite warriors of our Barbarian Race, the Brothers and Sisters of the Shaman Niu Clan! The Demon Race is coming for us now, and our only choice is to fight them to the death! Our opponents are the ones that ambushed us in that village a few days ago! Several of our Brothers and Sisters died that day, but this is just the beginning. If we cannot win this war, millions more will die! They will kill all our men, plunder our women, enslave our children and conquer our land!”

The breaths of the three thousand people became heavy, and their fighting spirit soared up to pierce the sky, as if it could tear the sea of clouds apart.

“This is our first real battle, so we have only one goal. To win! Not only to win! But to win decisively! Only by doing so can we wash away the humiliation suffered by our Shaman Niu Clan a few days ago! My warriors, are you ready?”

The troops roared passionately.

Even without the blessing of the Bloodlust Spell, the eyes of the three thousand warriors glowed red, like wild beasts.

Yang Kai smiled slightly and turned to point at the approaching dark cloud, “If you are ready, make them pay!”

The Giant Eagles screeched and the Aerial Cavalry took to the skies.

Under the leadership of their Captains, the ten sub-units quickly headed for the enemy without saying a word, organized and rapid footsteps shaking the ground beneath them.

The Elite Guards surrounded the dozen Shamans as obscure incantations rang out. The light of Shamanic Spells bloomed from the Shamans, enveloping the ten units, one after another.

Bloodlust Spell, Light Body Spell, Stone Armour Spell, Great Strength Spell, Life Chains…

Every warrior was covered with colourful radiance, and all of the Ancient Barbarians visibly grew in size, their muscles bulging as their faces turned vicious. Even their red eyes became a brighter shade of crimson.

Without playing any tricks, the Demon Race and the Barbarian Race seemed to have agreed to charge straight at each other.

Overlooking from a high altitude, two armies of thousands were approaching from opposite directions, and the broad flat land at the centre was where the battle would be joined.

The fifty-kilometre distance between the two groups was shortened in just a stick worth of incense.

The fighting spirit and murderous intent of the Barbarians reached a fever pitch during this several-dozen-kilometre charge.

When the dark clouds began to shroud over the land, the two armies officially met.

The Ancient Barbarians who were charging in front were slightly stunned, however, because they saw familiar faces before them, faces that belonged to the clansmen of the Barbarian Race of the past.

The vanguard of the Demon Race army was actually their demonised clansmen.

However, at this moment, these clansmen had lost their minds and gone insane. It seemed that what stood in front of them were not their former clansmen, but their sworn enemies.

The enemy mercilessly lifted their weapons and charged towards them.

“Kill!” Roars echoed.

The people of the Shaman Niu Clan were slightly stunned, but they quickly regained their composure and prepared themselves.

Thanks to the intelligence obtained by Yang Kai, everyone was aware that this situation would occur when they engaged the Demon Race.

Every Barbarian had asked himself, [If I really meet my demonised clansmen, would I be able to kill them?]

No matter what condition these people were in, they were once fellow Barbarians. They were their Brothers and Sisters, their clansmen. Perhaps, they would still have a chance to save them.

Nevertheless, they soon knew that it was a meaningless thought.

If they really encountered such people during battle, killing them would be the best mercy for them.

Hesitating would be an irresponsible act to their companions.

In front of the crowd, Ah Hu leapt ten metres into the air and slashed down with a huge axe in his hand.

Before the attack even landed, the sharp aura from the huge axe had already split the skin of the demonised clansman in front of him, and when Ah Hu’s attack was fully swung, that clansman had been split into two.

Ah Hu held up his huge axe and roared ferociously, “Kill!”
