Chapter 948, Recognizing Ancestors And Returning To One’s Homeland

Inside the former site of War Spirit Temple, the various cultivators from the Great Han Dynasty began settling in and after ten days of discussion, each force had its own place.

War Spirit Temple originally had several thousand disciples, so even though there were many cultivators from the Great Han Dynasty, it was not a problem to fit them all in.

With new homes in a new environment, everyone felt a sense of prosperity.

Yang Kai summoned the leaders of the various forces and warned them about several things, especially the passage to the Starry Sky gate inside Shattering Mystical Palace, making sure none of them allowed their people to enter it at will.

That was a place where even if Saints went in, they were almost guaranteed to die, let alone this group of people from the Great Han Dynasty.

“This world is very different from the Great Han Dynasty, here you cannot act the same as before. All of you must regard one another as one whole family. Although you may need years, or even tens of years to fully integrate into this world, and the road ahead will be challenging, the room for development here is also far greater compared to the other side,” Yang Kai said as he looked out across the crowd.

The leaders of the various forces all nodded. Since they were willing to follow Yang Kai here, they were naturally prepared for all this.

If they wanted to develop and thrive here, they would need to put aside their differences and band together, abandoning their previous Sect and Family identities to become one cohesive force.

There was no need for Yang Kai to mention such matters, this was something they all understood.

Fortunately, at present, the leaders of each force basically came from the younger generation, so their mindsets were more flexible.

The Holy Land sent over a large number of cultivation materials and evenly distributed them to everyone here, so the Great Han Dynasty cultivators had no need to worry about securing resources and could instead focus on improving their own cultivation realms.

The Holy Land could now easily collect this amount of cultivation materials as the five Grandmasters and Xia Ning Chang were constantly receiving requests for Alchemy services. With the storm of the Mysterious Small Worlds dying down, the number of people coming to the Holy Land for pills was gradually increasing again.

The Holy Land’s daily income was now enough to support ten Holy Lands, so naturally there was no issue supplying resources to the Great Han cultivators.

During these ten days, Xia Ning Chang had also come over and stayed awhile, spending time greeting everyone from High Heaven Pavilion, but because there were so many people requesting Alchemy services from the Holy Land, after a few days she had to return.

Another ten days passed by and everything had finally settled down.

In a corner of the former War Spirit Temple grounds, Yang Kai came across Ling Tai Xu standing atop of mountain peak, quietly gazing out across the world, and called out, “Grand Master!”

Ling Tai Xu looked back and nodded with a smile, “Have you grow tired after all these days of hard work?”

“Not at all,” Yang Kai smiled, “It was my greatest wish since I first came to this world to bring my family and friends here.”

Ling Tai Xu revealed a look of approval as he nodded, “This time, you have splendidly dealt with all possible issues, I believe everyone who has come here is deeply thankful to you.”

Yang Kai gently inhaled, revealing a worried look, “The only thing I worry about now is if there will be any contradictions in the future.”

Ling Tai Xu however just laughed, “There will definitely be contradiction; after all, the people who came here come from far too many forces, but you don’t have to worry about that, no one here is unreasonable, so even if contradictions arise, they will be able to find solutions on their own. As long as they have the heart to come together, after one or two generations have passed, they will truly become one family. Everything is just a matter of time.”

“I hope so,” Yang Kai nodded.

He had done what he should do, the rest would be up to the efforts of the cultivators from the Great Han Dynasty.

“Kai’er, that Soaring Heaven Sect you mentioned on the way here... Ling Tai Xu suddenly changed the subject, “Is it true that the Ancestral Founder for my High Heaven Pavilion is there?”

“En,” Yang Kai nodded sincerely, “It’s absolutely true. When disciple first came to this world, I received much care from the Ancestral Founder as well as my Martial Uncles and Martial Aunt.”

On the journey to the Holy Land, Yang Kai had spoken about the relationship between High Heaven Pavilion and Soaring Heaven Sect. At that time, the Ling Tai Xu was very interested and excited; now that he was suddenly bringing it up again, it was obvious what he was planning.

“Ancestral Founder is still alive...” Ling Tai Xu’s face showed a fascinated look, “His strength is probably quite profound, yes?”

“Among the highest level in this world!” Yang Kai quickly said.

Ling Tai Xu took a deep breath, “I wish to greet him!”

He was the former Sect Master of High Heaven Pavilion, but compared with Chu Ling Xiao, he was still several generations lower. Now that Ling Tai Xu knew that the Sect’s Ancestral Founder was still alive, naturally he wanted to meet him.

“I’ll take you,” Yang Kai said immediately.

“There’s no need for that, you have many things to attend to, just find someone who knows the way there and have them show me the way,” Ling Tai Xu waved his hand.

Yang Kai smiled meaningfully, “If I let someone else take Grand Master there, it will be at least a four-month round trip, but if disciple takes you, it will only take a few days to go back and forth.”

“Oh?” Ling Tai Xu’s brow rose, “Do you have the means to travel so quickly?”

“Grand Master will have to experience it to understand,” Yang Kai chuckled, thinking for a moment before saying, “Let’s also bring Su Mu along.”

Ling Tai Xu pondered for a bit before nodding, “Good, regardless of anything else, he is now the Sect Master of High Heaven Pavilion. Coming with me to meet Ancestral Founder is only appropriate.”

Yang Kai immediately released his Divine Sense to search for Su Mu.

An incense stick worth of time later, Su Mu rushed over, “Brother-in-law, Former Sect Master, why did you suddenly summon me?”

“To lead you to see the Sect’s Ancestral Founder!” Yang Kai grinned and summoned the Flying Heavens Shuttle, leaping aboard before beckoning to Su Mu and Ling Tai Xu.

After the two also boarded, the Flying Heavens Shuttle immediately transformed into a blue streak of light and disappeared.

Feeling the terrifying speed of the Flying Heavens Shuttle, Ling Tai Xu and Su Mu both paled.

Su Mu exclaimed, “Brother-in-law, what is this artifact? Isn’t its speed too incredible?”

He was also now a Transcendent, yet when he released his Divine Sense into the surroundings, he was unable to capture the flow of scenery around him, which meant that the Flying Heavens Shuttle could fly at least several times faster than he could expand his Divine Sense.

“It’s called the Flying Heavens Shuttle, a flight type artifact,” Yang Kai explained casually.

“This thing is amazing. At such a speed, if I ever wanted to visit Nine Heavens Holy Land in the future, I’m afraid the trip would only take the blink of an eye,” Su Mu shouted excitedly, “Brother-in-law, make one for me too!”

Yang Kai’s face went black.

Ling Tai Xu saw this and smiled, “You should give up such wishful thinking, I’m afraid this artifact is not easy to acquire.”

“En, in all the world, this is the only one,” Yang Kai nodded.

Su Mu was inevitably disappointed upon realizing just how precious and rare the Flying Heavens Shuttle was, “Brother-in-law, you being able to obtain a unique treasure like this is really the good fortunes of Heaven... Right, a moment ago you mentioned something about bringing me to see the Ancestral Founder? What Ancestral Founder?”

Yang Kai quickly explained about Chu Ling Xiao and Soaring Heaven Sect.

After listening to him, Su Mu couldn’t help looking forward to this meeting.

Along the way, Yang Kai took advantage of this opportunity to teach some knowledge about Tong Xuan Realm to Su Mu and Ling Tai Xu.

Two days later, they arrived at Soaring Heaven Sect.

Yang Kai rushed directly into Serene Resplendent Peak.

Before he could enter the mountain cave though, a tender shout reached his ears, “Little Martial Nephew!”

Turning his head towards the source of the voice, Yang Kai saw his Martial Aunt Fei Yu standing not far away, apparently having already noticed his arrival. Beside her was Cang Yan, Li Wan and Fei Jian.

Yang Kai smiled happily and rushed over with Ling Tai Xu and Su Mu.

“I was just wondering which blind bastard dared to break into my Serene Resplendent Peak, but it turns out it’s just you returning,” Fei Yu said full of enthusiasm, her beautiful eyes sweeping over Yang Kai as she angrily said, “You never send word in advance and always just appear and disappear so mysteriously.”

“I just arrived,” Yang Kai laughed, “In any case, it’s not like we’re strangers.”

“The only one who dares to come and go freely from my Serene Resplendent Peak is you. If Li Wan or the rest dared to do this, I would knock all their teeth out without question,” Fei Yu snorted.

Li Wan made a pitiful face as he complained, “Why are you pulling me into this? I’ve never come in and out of this place without letting you know.”

“These two are...” Cang Yan cast his eyes curiously towards Ling Tai Xu and Su Mu, not knowing why Yang Kai would bring these two people to Soaring Heaven Sect.

“This is my Grand Master Ling Tai Xu that I mentioned to you before, and this is my Junior Brother Su Mu, en, he is now the Sect Master of the High Heaven Pavilion.”

“High Heaven Pavilion!” The four of them were quite shocked as they asked, “The Sect Martial Ancestor created in that other world?”

“En.”

“High Heaven Pavilion’s Ling Tai Xu greets Senior Brothers and Senior Sister!” Ling Tai Xu is a cupped his fists and politely bowed. Although his appearance made him look much older than Cang Yan and the others, Ling Tai Xu knew that in terms of true age each of the four before him was much older than himself, so it was only a matter of course to call them Senior Brothers and Senior Sister.

“Su Mu greets Martial Uncles and Martial Aunt!” Su Mu also hurriedly saluted.

“Good good good!” Cang Yan laughed as he and the other three returned the courtesy, “So Junior Brother and Martial Nephew are here to recognize your ancestors and return to your homeland. Good, Martial Ancestor will be very happy when he learns of this.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“What about the others from High Heaven Pavilion?” Fei Yu kindly inquired.

“I have settled them in a place near Nine Heavens Holy Land. The journey from there to here is too far and they have only just arrived in Tong Xuan Realm so I have not led them here today.”

“That’s fine, if there is a chance in the future, you can bring them here,” Cang Yan nodded, “Come, let me take you to see Martial Ancestor. We just so happen to have something to discuss with him as well.”

“Then I’ll trouble Senior Brother to lead the way,” Ling Tai Xu’s heart pounded with excitement.

Inside Chu Ling Xiao’s secluded room, the group of people looked for a place and sat down cross-legged; after learning about Ling Tai Xu and Su Mu’s origins, Chu Ling Xiao also felt some rising emotions.

After a moment of silence, Chu Ling Xiao said, “In the past, I founded High Heaven Pavilion as a temporary plan. I could not remain forever to watch over that Demon General’s body so I casually found some disciples and taught them a few things, but I hadn’t thought that after leaving, those few disciples would continue to carry forward High Heaven Pavilion for so long. En, I was somewhat negligent in my responsibilities. If I had known things would turn out this way, I would have left some better Secret Arts and Martial Skills there. These years must have been hard for you.”

“Ancestral Founder is too serious,” Ling Tai Xu hurriedly said, “It was all thanks to Ancestral Founder that disciple can have today’s achievements. Disciple now being able to greet Ancestral Founder in this lifetime is already the greatest blessing of High Heaven Pavilion’s ancestors. If they were to learn of this in the afterlife, I’m sure they would smile happily.”

“Good,” Chu Ling Xiao gently nodded, a look of gratitude appearing on his face.
