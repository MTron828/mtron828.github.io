The Hundred Sect Alliance had deployed nearly 5,000 people, which was quite a large number. Among them were hundreds of Open Heaven Realm Masters. With such a lineup, any ordinary Second Class great force would not be an opponent at all. These people came with high morale, and under the leadership of numerous Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, they plunged into the Grand Array from multiple directions. Immediately, they were surrounded by rolling fog which obscured their vision and severely suppressed their Divine Senses. Anyone below the Open Heaven Realm became essentially blind while even the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters could only inspect the situation within a radius of 300 meters around themselves.

However, they kept in mind Kong Feng’s orders, summoned their defensive artifacts immediately, and kept moving around, sending out probing attacks to disturb the Grand Array so that Luan Bai Feng could investigate its reactions and trace its structure.

A group of people from Heaven’s Border gathered around Old Hong. He wanted them to huddle together to keep a lookout for each other. It was extremely dangerous for them to disperse given the current situation.

However, within ten breaths after rushing into the Bewildering Array, Old Hong realized that his group was getting smaller and smaller.

His heart sank, and was about to open his mouth to rally his forces when he heard a sudden outburst of screams from all directions. It was the obvious and abrupt sound of death. Old Hong, who had killed plenty of people in the past, knew these cries very well. It was obvious that his forces had been ambushed by Void Land.

“Follow me, don’t panic!” Old Hong roared loudly, but by now there were only three people left around him.

Old Hong was a Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so his Divine Sense was able to extend a few dozen meters into the surroundings; however, if they were really ambushed, such a miniscule distance would not be sufficient for them to respond effectively.

Suddenly, an unusually aggressive force rushed towards them from the side. Old Hong’s face paled and shouted, “Defend yourselves!”

At the same time, he slammed a palm towards that direction, sending out a burst of World Force.

He came in contact with the incoming assaulter lightly before quickly retreating, not stopping until he was at least several dozen meters away. His face changed abruptly, as he called out in alarm, “Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm!”

He had realized that the one who attacked him was a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master,

[My predestined time has come!] He cried out silently. He was just a Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so how was there any hope of surviving this crisis? Cursing Kong Feng silently in his heart, Old Hong did not dare to let down his guard and urged his defensive artifact to its maximum.

Another series of screams echoed, and Old Hong could not help but feel his heart bleed. Although the screams were short-lived, he could clearly distinguish that the voices belonged to the Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters from Heaven’s Border who had until recently been with him.

How could a few Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters survive the assault of a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master? They had all ended up on a one-way trip to the Yellow Springs.

Old Hong ground his teeth as he turned around to flee; however, the surging clouds and mists heavily obscured his vision. Knowing that if he did not leave this place, he would die, he fled randomly.

Not far behind him, Fan Wu Xin looked at his silhouette with a frown. Unlike Old Hong, he and the others had Yang Kai’s assistance, which allowed them to come and go freely in this Grand Array without much restriction to their senses. As such, he was able to clearly see where Old Hong was fleeing.

Fan Wu Xin had just advanced into the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm and had not fully adapted to his new strength, making it impossible for him to unleash his full potential.

Nevertheless, he was still a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. If he decided to be ruthless and pursued Old Hong doggedly, the latter would not be able to escape death. However, this would inevitably waste a lot of time. Rather than stubbornly chase after Old Hong, it would be better to kill more Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters. There were quite a lot of enemies this time, so many they could be seen wherever he looked.

Therefore, after hesitating for a moment, Fan Wu Xin rushed to the side, and another scream erupted from that direction soon after.

Old Hong was terrified and fled forward like a headless fly without knowing how far he had escaped. Suddenly, a fierce attack came from the front, at the same time a voice boomed, “Die, bastard!”

Old Hong froze for a moment but quickly recovered to respond to the blow. Unfortunately for Old Hong, he was not fast enough and was struck by the blow, sending him tumbling as his blood churned unsteadily. Without waiting for the opponent to strike again, he shouted, “Brother Qi?”

A couple kilometers away, Qi Jin stopped and called out, “Old Hong?”

“It really is Brother Qi!” Old Hong was overjoyed and rushed forward. Sure enough, after a while, Qi Jin appeared in front of him. The two looked at each other and sighed when they realized that they were alone.

Old Hong inquired, “Brother Qi, are you able to see through the mysteries of this array?”

Brother Qi shook his head, “It’s difficult. This array is extremely profound, and this Qi is not very proficient in the Dao of Spirit Arrays, how could I see through it?”

Old Hong looked aggrieved, “Does that mean we really have to wait for Warden Luan to rescue us?” Being trapped in this Grand Array, it was impossible for them to escape even if they wanted to, and the only hope was for Luan Bai Feng to crack the array as soon as possible and rescue them.

Qi Jin replied, “Warden Luan is renowned throughout the 3,000 Worlds, and Union Master Kong specially invited her to help out, so she is certainly capable. We can only trust in her for now. You and I should not separate, we need to keep a look out for each other to avoid disaster.”

Old Hong nodded deeply, “Brother Qi is right, but there are a lot of Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters in Void Land. You and I are too weak to face them, so it would be better if we could find Brother Ling and the others.”

“Good.” Qi Jin agreed.

The two immediately began moving together as they searched for Ling Chun Qiu and other allies. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But after a while, Old Hong suddenly turned pale, “Brother Qi, did you hear that?”

Qi Jin frowned and listened intently for a moment before his face changed and he sighed deeply, “I don’t know how many will survive this battle...”

The screams all around were obviously not as dense as before, but rather scattered. This situation undoubtedly meant that the nearly 5,000 people who poured into the array had already suffered heavy casualties, otherwise it would never have been the case.

The Hundred Sect Alliance suffered heavy casualties. 5,000 people rushed in, but more than half had died in less than half a stick of incense.

Although Void Land only dispatched 300 people, all of them were Open Heaven Realm Masters. Although the Hundred Sect Alliance had the numerical advantage, only a few hundred of them were Open Heaven Realm Masters, and in addition to being trapped in the Bewildering Array, they were forced into an extremely passive situation. This battle was almost a one-sided slaughter!

Void Land did not suffer much. Except for a few wounded Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters who retreated hurriedly, no one had been killed so far.

Given enough time, Void Land would certainly have no problem wiping out these invaders!

Yang Kai looked up into the sky, his eyes fixed on Heavenly Sword Union’s ship. He was not looking at Kong Feng, but rather was staring at Luan Bai Feng instead. Seeing this woman’s abnormal movements, Yang Kai figured she had cultivated some kind of profound Eye Secret Technique and was using it to spy on the mysteries of the Grand Array.

He was not afraid that Luan Bai Feng might discover something, but rather that she would not be good enough to see through any of the mysteries of the Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array. If that was the case, his next plan could not be implemented.

The Hundred Sect Alliance had the audacity to attack them this time, so if they did not retaliate fiercely, what would happen to Void Land’s reputation? How could they let the Cave Heavens and Paradises, who were watching from the shadows, know that they were not to be trifled with?

It was not Yang Kai’s intention to slaughter thousands of people; however, Kong Feng, the mastermind, had to die. If someone dared to mess with Void Land, then he would destroy them by any means necessary!

However, Kong Feng was a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. If Yang Kai wanted to kill him, he had to lure him into a trap.

The massacre in the Bewildering Array was just the first step!

Just when Yang Kai was considering whether to make it easier for them, Luan Bai Feng suddenly frowned, and the purple glow in her eyes dimmed as she let out a soft sigh.

Seeing this, Kong Feng, who had been observing her closely, quickly asked, “Junior Sister Luan, what happened?”

Luan Bai Feng pursed her lips and smirked, “Union Master Kong, order the troops to attack!”

Kong Feng was overjoyed, “Junior Sister Luan is indeed amazing, but this Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array probably has many other tricks, not just this Bewildering Array!”

Luan Bai Feng replied, “Of course I know this, but as long as this Bewildering Array is broken, it will be a simple competition of strength.”

Kong Feng pondered for a while, then nodded in agreement, “Junior Sister Luan is right.”

He no longer hesitated, amplifying his voice as he shouted, “This devil spawn’s Grand Array will soon be destroyed. Everyone, follow this Union Master to claim victory!”

Everyone was delighted when they heard these words. No one knew what was happening inside after sending troops into the Grand Array, and would naturally be worried about the safety of their disciples. Knowing that the array was about to be broken was great news to them.

While Kong Feng’s booming voice echoed across the void, Luan Bai Feng had already summoned more than ten Array Flags and Plates. Performing a set of hand seals, each and every of the Array Flag and Array Plate disappeared swiftly into the Grand Array.

Forming a final set of seals, Luan Bai Feng clapped her hands together before pulling them apart. As her hands moved, as though a great invisible force was acting, a hole was opened in the Grand Array, revealing Void Land.

The Bewildering Array of the Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array was broken!

Seeing this situation, the morale of the Hundred Sect Alliance was greatly boosted, but after seeing the situation inside the array, anger began to boil within them. This was because at this moment, there were less than 1,000 cultivators alive within the array!

Nearly 5,000 people had entered just a stick of incense ago, but in this short period of time, nearly 80% had fallen!

The fellow brothers, relatives, and lovers of the fallen who saw this were enraged. If everyone had only come here to besiege Void Land because of the pressure from Heavenly Sword Union earlier, now a true blood feud had been formed between them and Void Land.

Aboard Heavenly Sword Union’s ship, Kong Feng, who sat firmly on his seat, only uttered a single word, “Kill!”

All the ships rushed towards Void Land upon receiving the command.

Inside Void Land, Yang Kai raised his brow and sincerely praised, “This woman really has some skills. It’s likely her attainments in the Dao of Spirit Arrays are even greater than those of Grandmaster Wu Liang!”
