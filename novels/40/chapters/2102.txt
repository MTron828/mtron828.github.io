All demonic beings the three people saw in their flight had already come back to their senses, yet the one in front of them was still plagued by Demon Qi as before and he emitted an astounding vicious aura.

“Who are you?” Chen Wen Hao broke the silence and raised a question.

He really wanted to know why this demon didn’t come back to his senses like the other demonic beings, and how he turned out to be so powerful.

The person opposite him didn’t respond, and he could only hear muffled beastly roars from the mass of Demon Qi.

“Brother Chen, he has already lost his mind, so why are you still wasting your breath with him?” Feng Ming said impatiently and his treacherous-looking eyes glared at Yang Kai.

Gao Xue Ting didn’t utter a single word, but her pretty eyes shone brightly, as if she wanted to penetrate the thick Demon Qi and have a look at Yang Kai’s face.

But, it seemed as if Yang Kai had detected her actions and he turned his head suddenly to look at her. Their gazes ended up meeting and an invisible collision broke out between their gazes mid-air

“Ahh!” Gao Xue Ting’s pretty face turned pale and her body staggered, as if she had suffered the brunt of a ferocious attack.

“Let...” A muffled, indistinct, and pained roar transmitted from the Demon Qi, but they all heard it clearly and understood what the demonic being wanted to express.

An eerie glow flashed past Chen Wen Hao’s eyes and he strode forward. As he moved, a cyan sword appeared in his hand and he said calmly, “I’ll test the water and try his means. Sirs, please support me from the rear.”

As he spoke, a soft whistle echoed out. Chen Wen Hao had already turned into an illusory silhouette and appeared before Yang Kai.

*Shhing! Shhing!*

The Sword light shot out, the Sword Qi emitted a humming noise, while the torrential Sword Force left behind it a whistling noise.

*Clang!*

Sparks flew around and energy pulses ran amok in the void. The sword strike was so swift and torrential!

After a short while, Chen Wen Hao sheathed his sword and stood on his former position motionless, as if he had never moved in the first place.

On the other side, numerous web-like fissures appeared on the Demon Qi surrounding Yang Kai’s body, and one could faintly see some parts of his body through the cracks. The flesh exposed to the air was covered with dense Demon Crests. But, those cracks were instantly mended by the billowing Demon Qi.

Chen Wen Hao furrowed his brows, while Gao Xue Ting and Feng Ming were very surprised. Yang Kai was more thorny than they expected.

“Die!” It seemed like Yang Kai had been enraged by Chen Wen Hao’s attack, and he let out a roar, while the churning Demon Qi enveloping him let out jarring wails, as if the Nether King had just blown the war horn and ordered them to advance.

*Swoosh!*

He suddenly disappeared!

“What?” Chen Wen Hao was finally surprised for real. Even his strong Divine Sense wasn’t able to follow Yang Kai’s trail. His speed had already surpassed anything he knew.

He tried as hard as he could to manoeuvre his Spiritual Energy’s power and he surveyed tightly a perimeter of a hundred feet around him, trying to peer into Yang Kai’s movements.

“Be careful!” Gao Xue Ting’s expression changed drastically and she cried out aloud.

“Brother Chen, he’s behind you!” Feng Ming also let out a strange cry.

But, did he really need their warning? When Yang Kai had just appeared behind him, Chen Wen Hao had also detected him, and he instantly manoeuvred the power of the Unfettered Worldly Principle. His sword let out a dazzling radiance and he instantly thrust it behind.

*Ding!*

A crisp metallic collision sound echoed out, and Chen Wen Hao felt like he had struck something, but his attack was blocked. It wasn’t limited to just this, as his sword let out a sad cry and its light flickered intensely. He was so startled he broke into a cold sweat, and he ended up taking the wrong step out of fluster and stumbled forward.

The torrential force that erupted out behind him didn’t manage to harm him, but it still scared him greatly.

Yang Kai didn’t wait for him to regain his balance and he followed him closely like his shadow. He appeared on his right side, and he thrust his fist, which was covered by Demon Qi, into him. His fist contained indomitable destructive power!

It was a simple, yet very ferocious move, and it could be said that it was a natural move.

It was unavoidable!

Chen Wen Hao’s mind was in turmoil. He was just a First-Order Emperor Realm Master, but he had already come in touch with the real essence of the world’s Martial Dao, and even if he faced a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master, he wouldn’t be so thoroughly suppressed, he would still be able to exchange some moves against him.

Yet, this peculiar demonic being suppressed him. He depended upon his brilliant Movement Skill and ridiculously high speed to suppress him, and he wasn’t even able to fight back.

At this critical juncture, he let out a shout: “Water Source Transformation!”

As his voice echoed out, he turned semi-transparent, as if his body was made of water.

Yang Kai’s fist fell on him directly and penetrated his chest. He left a large hole in his body!

Chen Wen Hao let out a groan, and it seemed like he suffered serious injuries, but he still didn’t move back. Instead, he circulated his Source Qi and the Water Source Embodiment to condense his body and stranded Yang Kai’s arm within him.

At this moment, Feng Ming and Gao Xue Ting, who had been watching the battle, finally made a move at the same time.

A long spear with a shape resembling a flying goose appeared in Feng Ming’s hand, and arcs of lightning were dancing around it. This was obviously the fruit of his hard labor, the Emperor Artifact, Lightning Goose Spear. It was one of the Southern Territory’s famous weapons!

“Relentless Lightning!” Feng Ming let out a shout and seized the opportunity created by Chen Wen Hao to make an attack. He swung his long spear and thrust it at Yang Kai.

On the other side, a little mirror appeared in Gao Xue Ting’s palm. After she infused her Source Qi into it, it let out a dazzling radiance, and it looked like a mini sun hung in the air. The mirror fired a dazzling light beam, which enveloped Yang Kai’s body.

Gao Xue Ting wore a cold and stern look as usual, and as her white dress fluttered in the air, she looked like a goddess that had descended from heaven.

A scorching air started pervading this region, and it seemed able to burn all myriad matters.

The Demon Qi around Yang Kai’s body started wiggling, as if it had just run into its nemesis, and many of its wisps evaporated and turned into drifting smoke.

...

“Emperor Artifact: Radiant Sun Mirror!”

In the Small Sealed World, Hua Qing Si had seen everything that had occurred thanks to the projection created by the Embodiment.

The girl’s face was filled with excitement, and she shouted aloud and cheered for them.

She knew those people, and she had also heard of the artifacts used by them, and even if she didn’t hear of them, she would get an understanding of them upon observing them.

The sword in Chen Wen Hao’s hand was also no ordinary artifact, it was the Emperor Artifact, Flowing Water Sword.

Three great Emperor Realm Masters launched a joint attack with three great Emperor Artifacts in their hands. She felt like she could already foresee the Demon King, Yang Kai’s fall.

She felt like she would shortly get to take in a fresh breath of freedom...

...

In the twinkling of an eye, Yang Kai was engulfed by the Radiant Sun Barrier, and as if he had detected a deadly threat, he suddenly let out a roar and a hot yet dignified aura, completely different from his other evil and vicious aura, erupted out of his body.

In the next moment, his hand which had been stuck in Chen Wen Hao’s Water Source Embodiment started expanding and draconic scales emerged on it. His whole hand turned into a dragon claw, and he drew support from its transformation to pull it back.

Chen Wen Hao let out a soft groan, and it seemed like he wasn’t able to maintain his Water Source Embodiment any longer. Thus when Yang Kai’s hand finally broke free, it brought with it some of his blood.

Shortly after, Yang Kai turned around and stretched his hand toward the ferocious lightning.

*Sizz!*

Yang Kai’s body shook violently, but he still managed to block Feng Ming’s Secret Technique with his dragon claw. However, his body had been paralyzed by the electric current.

Gao Xue Ting’s pretty eyes turned cold and she took avail of this chance to raise the Radiant Sun Mirror’s might.

The Demon Qi on Yang Kai’s body started evaporating at a higher speed, and this brought him a great deal of pain. It wasn’t any different than inhuman torture.

“Die, all of you!” Yang Kai let out a roar and the space within a dozen kilometres suddenly changed drastically.

A World Principle power suddenly fell upon Gao Xue Ting’s body and her movement came to a sudden stop.

While on the other side, after Yang Kai had broken free and escaped, Chen Wen Hao had just raised his sword to launch another attack, yet his body suddenly turned heavy.

“Space Principle?” Gao Xue Ting let out a sharp cry and her pretty eyes trembled.

The Emperor Realm Master present here had all high attainment in cultivation, and they obviously had a unique understanding of the World Principles. They had all practised a Secret Technique or a Cultivation Method to comprehend a World Principle and advance into the Emperor Realm.

Every Emperor Realm Master had a different understanding of the World Principles and they were all specialized in different domains.

Only geniuses blessed by Heaven could comprehend the deepest and most primitive Principle of his domain.

Five Elements’ Principles, various Forces’ essences, and Divine Abilities’ mysteries. Those were all cornerstones crucial for an Emperor Realm Master’s growth into a real expert.

Among them, there were several Principle powers considered the most difficult to comprehend, and the Space Principle was one of them. It was nearly impossible to comprehend it!

In the Star Boundary’s long history, many Great Emperors depended upon their comprehension of Principle power to reach the apex, yet they never heard about anyone who could manoeuvre Space Principle power to this point.

The Space Principle was too mysterious, and even an Emperor Realm Master could only stare at it from afar.

Yet, a demonic being, which had been forcefully converted into a demon, could manipulate the Space Principle and seal this region.

Gao Xue Ting couldn’t help but hold her breath for a moment out of shock and she got into a trance, but it was precisely at this moment that Yang Kai, who bore the might of the Radiant Sun Mirror, went after her. He was as swift as lightning and his speed was already beyond comprehension.

In the twinkling of an eye, Yang Kai reached Gao Xue Ting, but he turned a blind eye to the enemy after his life and thrust his fist at the Radiant Sun Mirror.

*Roar! Roar!*

Dragons’ roars resounded out and a dozen demonic dragons’ phantom images emerged out of his fist and danced in the sky.

Even though Gao Xue Ting reacted quickly and moved away in time, she still didn’t get out of harm’s way.

*Rumble!*

As the black demonic dragons collided against the Radiant Sun Mirror, its light flickered repeatedly.

By the time Gao Xue Ting rushed to Chen Wen Hao’s side, her expression turned unsightly and she looked in pain at the fruit of her sweat and blood, her Emperor Artifact.

The Radiant Sun Mirror had been covered by a layer of faint Black Qi and its spirituality had already been damaged.

In the Sealed World Bead, Hua Qing Si observed everything in a daze with her mouth wide open. She couldn’t help but say in a low voice, “How come he’s so strong?”

Three Emperor Realm Masters joined hands and they had even used their Emperor Artifacts. She assumed that they would quickly take down Yang Kai, yet once the confrontation started, it was them who suffered one setback after another, and Yang Kai was as unstoppable as ever.

Hua Qing Si couldn’t accept this outcome!
