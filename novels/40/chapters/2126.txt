Chapter 2126, For His Own Good

Wen Zi Shan asked, “Elder Gao, wasn’t that a pick-up line usually used by a man to a woman? Especially in a particular ambience and environment, with an ulterior motive. This King would understand if this was said by this little brother to you, but coming from you... this just doesn’t seem right!”

“Shut up!” Gao Xue Ting bellowed.

Yang Kai was frozen on the spot at the sudden outburst.

Qin Zhao Yang was also dumbfounded. He looked towards Gao Xue Ting with an odd expression.

Gao Xue Ting was the First-Order Emperor Realm Master, but she was only an Elder in the Azure Sun Temple, while the one seated above was Wen Zi Shan, the Temple Master!

How dare she, just an Elder, ask the Temple Master to shut up?

Was this not treachery?

More shocking to Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang was that Wen Zi Shan really did shut up!

They looked around, but the others did not seem to be surprised by what happened and had no hint of blame for Gao Xue Ting’s insubordination. In fact, some of them threw Wen Zi Shan a look of contempt.

Yang Kai was at a loss.

His first thought was [The Wen Zi Shan sitting up there must be an impostor, for Gao Xue Ting to be able to act rude to him, while the others even threw him dirty looks.]

[On second thought, maybe not.] Yang Kai felt the fluctuation of the power in his body clearly when Wen Zi Shan waved his hand earlier.

This guy was definitely a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master!

He was the only Third-Order Emperor Realm in the whole Azure Sun Temple. Who else could be Wen Zi Shan, if he was not?

Yang Kai was perplexed and found the bunch of Azure Sun Temple executives really strange.

“You still have not replied to me. Have I seen you somewhere before?” Gao Xue Ting turned to Yang Kai and asked relentlessly.

Yang Kai muttered to himself, then said: “I am from Maplewood City, there was once when Elder Gao visited to assist Sir Xiao Yu Yang in activating the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda. I was also present at that time and entered the trial... maybe that is why Elder Gao recognized me.”

“I see...” Gao Xue Ting figured that he made sense, nodded. “That could be it!”

She stopped paying attention to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was immediately relieved.

If Gao Xue Ting had recognized him as the Demon she fought against before, he would have a terrible fate.

The crowd waited silently in the hall for a while. Chen Qian’s communication artifact suddenly fluctuated with Divine Sense.

After confirming the information given through the communication artifact, she looked up and shook her head at Wen Zi Shan and said, “Temple Master, there is no such thing as a Tribulation Fruit in our vault!”

“That makes this King very disappointed...” Wen Zi Shan spoke in a low voice.

A look of disappointment etched on Qin Zhao Yang’s face.

It would be best if the Tribulation Fruit was readily available, and there would be no need for Yang Kai to venture into the Four Seasons Realm. There was no telling what decision the Emperor Realm would make since there was none in Azure Sun Temple.

“Since there are none available here...” Wen Zi Shan said, “You may go in and search for it yourself, but what happens next is out of our hands.”

Wen Zi Shan was referring to Qin Zhao Yang when he said that.

Qin Zhao Yang was delighted at his words.

Gao Xue Ting frowned slightly. It seemed that she had something to say, but it was too late to interject after Wen Zi Shan had already spoken.

“Many thanks, Temple Master Wen.” Qin Zhao Yang bowed to the ground, “However... this Qin has one more request!”

Wen Zi Shan smiled slightly: “If it’s not too much, let’s hear it.”

Qin Zhao Yang said, “This Qin requests Sir Temple Master to give the slot for entering the Four Seasons Realm to Brother Yang!”

As he spoke, he extended his arm and gestured towards Yang Kai, looking embarrassed, “I’m sure you Sirs are able to tell that this Qin is old in age. Even though I possess the cultivation of the First-Order Dao Source Realm, I know my own strength. Just as Elder Gao had said, I may not be able to return alive with the current level of my strength. The cost of my life is a small matter, but if I fail to obtain the Tribulation Fruit...”

“Do you mean that he will be able to survive?” Wen Zhi Shan asked with great interest.

Qin Zhao Yang replied, “Brother Yang is much stronger than this Qin.”

“At least you are aware of your own condition!” Wen Zi Shan smiled gently, “Since you have such a request... this King will allow it! That Sir said to give you a slot but did not specify to whom it will be given to, so you can decide it yourself!”

“Many thanks to Temple Master Wen!” Qin Zhao Yang thanked him with great joy.

Wen Zi Shan turned to Yang Kai and said: “This King doesn’t know what kind of relationship you have with this old man, but this King has to remind you that the Four Seasons Realm is not a safe place... although you are considered an elite with a body that is rich in Source Qi, who else but elites would be permitted to enter the Four Seasons Realm? Be careful!”

Yang Kai grinned, “I would like to meet the elite disciples of the great Sects!”

“This young man is too proud and arrogant!”

“He is so naïve!”

“The First-Order Dao Source Realm is only at the bottom of the list of Elites!”

The Emperor Realm Masters present in the temples started discussing.

Wen Zi Shan laughed, “That’s the spirit! Well, I hope you will keep it up when you get inside. The both of you shall leave, someone will come for you on the day of departure.”

As he spoke, he waved his hand once more. Before Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang could react to it, they were teleported outside of the temple.

They stared at each other for a few moments. Suddenly, a stream of light appeared from afar, and when it got closer to them, they saw that it was Tao Ming, Deacon Tao that they had met before!

The current Tao Ming no longer possessed the aggressive aura he had before. He rushed towards them, flustered and covered in sweat, beckoned them with his hand, and said: “The two of you, please come with me!”

He then led the way with Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang following closely behind.

Inside the temple. After Wen Zi Shan sent away Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang, he turned to the side and asked, “Little Xue Ting, is there anything else you want to say?”

Gao Xue Ting frowned, “Temple Master, you are making this very difficult for me.”

Wen Zi Shan laughed and replied: “It’s just a slot, just make space for one.”

Gao Xue Ting snorted coldly and said: “Sure, I will send an order saying that the Temple Master wants to revoke someone’s slot, and it has nothing to do with me!”

“Okay!” Wen Zi Shan nodded, and said, “If anyone has any objections, they can feel free to come see me!”

Gao Xue Ting was stunned by his bluntness.

Chen Qian spoke up: “Honestly, I don’t think it’s necessary to give them that slot. We could ask the disciples with slots to search for the Tribulation Fruit when they enter inside. If that does not work, Sister Gao can stay at the exit of the Sealed World and buy one from anyone who comes out of the Realm. You know, there are others, other than disciples from the Azure Sun Temple who can enter the Four Seasons Realm, maybe they possess that type of spirit fruit.”

Wen Zi Shan replied “Although what Little Qian said makes sense, this is the Sir’s request. This King cannot refuse. Let us put an end to this matter, and give them a slot...” He smiled wickedly. “It depends on them as to whether they can survive. If they are unable to even keep the slot, they might as well not go, they would be sending themselves to death anyway! And this King will not be considered to have gone against the wishes of that Sir as well.”

Hearing this, Gao Xue Ting’s eyes lit and nodded, “Subordinate knows what to do now.”

Wen Zi Shan nodded lightly and disappeared with a sway of his body.

The crowd gradually dismissed until there was only Chen Qian and Gao Xue Ting left in the hall.

“Sister Gao, who do you have in mind to make a move?” Chen Qian asked.

Gao Xue Ting thought about it and said “What do you think about Xue Yi?”

“Xue Yi?” Chen Qian was not familiar with this person. She thought about it for a while and said: “He is a Second-Order Dao Source Realm. Can Yang Kai.. handle it?”

“Among the twenty people, Xue Yi’s abilities are considered to be below average. If Yang Kai can’t even handle Xue Yi, there’s no point in entering the Four Seasons Realm. That place is not to be taken lightly, and it’s not easy to obtain the Tribulation Fruit. It’s for his own good.”

“Sister Gao... has a point!” Chen Qian nodded, but still sensed that something was wrong.

...

Tao Ming brought Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang and left them at a palace on a solitary peak that was at least 600 miles away from the temple earlier.

Yang Kai explored around for a little and found that there was no one else on the solitary peak. In other words, Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang were the only people there.

It was quite tranquil.

They chatted for a while, then searched for a room for themselves.

Qin Zhao Yang wanted to regain his strength and return to Maplewood City after such a stressful and frightening journey.

Yang Kai, on the other hand, wanted to grasp this opportunity to refine the flying treasure Aunty Feng gave him, as well as the Emperor Artifact Myriads Sword.

The Myriads Sword was of an extremely high grade, it was not necessary to refine it thoroughly, he could only slightly strengthen his connection to the sword. Fortunately, he had inherited the Qin Family’s ancestral secrets of refining, it was much easier for him.

There was not much time. According to Gao Xue Ting, the Four Seasons Realm would open in a month. Including the time needed for travelling, Yang Kai estimated that he would have to depart in two weeks. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He was racing against time.

Qin Zhao Yang recovered after a speedy five days.

After giving Yang Kai some final advice, he said goodbye and departed.

Since he had already decided to let Yang Kai enter the Four Seasons Realm, there was no purpose for him to continue his stay.

Yang Kai was all alone in the palace.

On that day, while he was isolating himself in his room, he felt two strong auras from afar, charging towards him.

The intruders had no intention of concealing themselves. One of them was emitting the aura of the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, and the other was Second-Order Dao Source Realm.

“Are we departing now?” Yang Kai frowned and muttered to himself, thinking that it was a summon from Azure Sun Temple to gather for departure. He got up immediately and went out of the palace to greet the visitors.
