After being brought out from the Sealed World Bead, Su Yan headed to Pure Ice Peak alone.

Although Yang Kai did not know why Luo Li wanted to meet Su Yan, he could tell that she had no malice towards Su Yan. He even felt that this was an opportunity for Su Yan.

The strange appearance of Su Yan shocked the Ice Heart Valley Elder who had been standing guard outside the secluded room.

She never saw Su Yan enter the room, but she had no doubt walked out from it.

No matter how she thought about it, she could not figure out what was going on.

In the meantime, Yang Kai remained in the secluded room to perform Alchemy.

An Origin King Grade Spirit Pill was not something that could simply be refined at will. According to Yang Kai’s understanding of the True Alchemic Way, if one wanted to refine an Origin King Grade Spirit Pill, they needed to infuse it with an appropriate pill spirit.

Only by possessing spirituality, could a refined pill be considered a Spirit Pill.

Yang Kai used high-grade Monster Beast Monster Cores as pill spirits.

A Monster Beast’s Monster Core contained its Spiritual Essence, which possessed its own spirituality, thus satisfying the Spirit Pill conditions.

Yang Kai naturally did not possess a Tenth-Order Monster Beast Monster Core, nor did Ice Heart Valley, but Ice Heart Valley did not lack Peak Ninth-Peak Monster Beast Monster Cores, one of which they supplied among the other materials Yang Kai had requested.

For the next three days, Yang Kai secluded himself.

From time to time, strange sounds and energy fluctuations emerged from the secluded room, and before long, a potent medicinal fragrance filled the air.

Bing Long and the other Elders, who had already heard some news from Luo Li, were absolutely stunned as they stood guard outside the secluded room, their jaws unable to close.

Yang Kai turned out to be an extremely skilled Alchemist, and although they didn’t know if he could truly refine an Origin King Grade Spirit Pill, just the signs they could see were enough to prove his extensive knowledge in the Alchemic Way.

But how was that possible?

Yang Kai didn’t seem to be very old, and his cultivation had already reached an incredible height at the Third Order Origin Returning Realm, so how could he have had any spare time or energy to study Alchemy, much less possess such high attainments in the field?

It was only at this moment that Bing Long and the other Elders realized just how terrifying an existence Yang Kai was.

The looks they directed towards the secluded room gradually became ones of awe.

Over time, the abnormal movement from the secluded room became more and more obvious as thousands of rays of light shone from it and the pill aroma that filled the air became more and more intense. Simply taking a deep breath of this fragrance was enough to allow the various Elders present to feel relaxed and comfortable.

Three days passed by in a flash, but no one dared open the door to this secluded room.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s voice came from inside, “Senior Bing Long, please enter.”

Bing Long adjusted her expression and hurried forward.

A short time after entering the secluded room, she walked out again, her expression filled with both excitement and anticipation.

“Valley Master, what is the situation?” Great Elder Ran Yun Ting and the others looked at it with anxious eyes. All of them knew that Yang Kai had been refining a Spirit Pill for the Supreme Elder these days. So, naturally, they could not wait to know what the results were.

Bing Long did not respond directly and instead just showed them a white jade bottle she held in her palm before quickly storing it into her Space Ring and then flying off to Pure Ice Peak in full haste.

“He succeeded?” Ran Yun Ting muttered to herself with a pale face.

The other Elders stared at the disappearing figure of Bing Long before turning their eyes to Ran Yun Ting again, a few of them letting out obvious sighs while others showed some meaning of blame in their eyes.

They knew that if they were in the same position as Ran Yun Ting on that day, with Chi Huo and Luo Hai applying pressure on Ice Heart Valley, they would have made the same decision as her: To give up on Su Yan to save the Sect.

However, Yang Kai’s bizarre performance and his incredible potential still made them feel a deep sense of regret.

If they had desperately tried to protect Su Yan instead of abandoning her that day... how wonderful would things have been? If that were the case, they could have forged a good relationship with Yang Kai.

Just how distinguished were Origin King Grade Alchemists?

Inside the secluded room, Yang Kai closed his eyes and adjusted his breathing. The Origin King Grade Spirit Pill refining he performed this time had given him some new insights he needed time to digest, and it just so happened that Luo Li would also need some time to refine this pill and heal her wounds, so he was in no rush to exit.

Once Luo Li recovered from her injuries, it would be time to attack Brilliant Flame Sect.

Yang Kai wanted to destroy Brilliant Flame Sect partly because of their Heavenly Thunder Fire. All the peak Brilliant Flame Sect masters he had encountered before had cultivated the Heaven Scorching Thunder Fire Secret Technique which when swallowed by the Firebird Artifact Spirit gave it a massive boost in strength.

Another reason was naturally because they had touched his bottom line.

Yang Kai had several grievances with this Sect even before the most recent incident, so his impression of them was quite poor.

One day later, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes and nodded in satisfaction.

To continue improving in the Alchemic Way, practice really was a requirement. Refining a single Origin King Grade Spirit Pill had allowed him to accumulate a lot of experience, so if he had enough materials to continue practising regularly, Yang Kai felt that his Alchemy techniques would improve significantly in short order.

Feeling a gaze upon him, Yang Kai turned his head to the side and saw that Qing Ya seemingly wanting to speak to him.

“Senior Sister Qing Ya, if you have something to say, don’t hold back,” Yang Kai smiled slightly, “Do you want me to refine a certain pill for you?”

“No no no,” Qing Ya waved her hands quickly, hesitated for a while, then finally spoke, “It’s about Qian Hao.”

“Qian Hao...” Yang Kai nodded. Qian Hao was one of the former Elders of Ice Sect, as well as Qian Yue’s brother.

He had also come to Scarlet Wave Star with Qing Ya and Su Yan back then, but because he was male, he could not enter Ice Heart Valley. Fortunately, Ran Yun Ting arranged for him to enter a subordinate Sect of Ice Heart Valley and apparently, he had been doing well these past few decades.

“Do you want him to leave that Sect?” Yang Kai immediately understood Qing Ya’s intentions.

“En, Su Yan and I are no longer disciples of Ice Heart Valley, so if Qian Hao were to remain in his current Sect, there is a good chance he will become the target of discrimination. Also, since we have all reunited now, it makes no sense to leave Qian Hao to be on his own. He should come back and join us.”

“En, a simple matter,” Yang Kai smiled lightly as he released his Divine Sense and communicated with one of the Elders outside.

A moment later, he smiled at Qing Ya and said, “Qian Hao will come tomorrow, then all of Ice Sect’s members can be reunited.”

“Thank you,” Qing Ya said, full of emotion.

Ice Sect had been one of the most powerful Sects on Tong Xuan Realm, and although it did not have many disciples, it also did not have a very high public profile, any master of significance knew of its existence and that it was a silent hegemon in its own domain.

But now, only four people remained from Ice Sect.

Reflecting on the past, Qing Ya cherished the present even more.

[Su Yan had found herself a good man!] Qing Ya looked at Yang Kai with a smile of relief on her face.

Ice Heart Valley’s efficiency was great and the next day, Qian Hao arrived on Pure Ice Island. After seeing Qing Ya, he felt a sense of comfort, as if he had returned home, and after seeing Yang Kai, he was thoroughly dumbfounded, like he had seen a ghost.

Qian Hao had to rub his eyes several times before he could confirm that the Yang Kai in front of him was real and not some kind of illusion.

“Good, you’ve not met in quite some time so you should have a lot you wish to say to one another. Relax, I will send you to a place where someone is waiting for you!” Yang Kai smiled lightly as he spoke to Qing Ya and Qian Hao.

The pair did not ask any questions and immediately relaxed their guard.

Yang Kai waved his hand, enveloping the pair in an invisible force that in the next moment sent Qing Ya and Qian Hao into the Sealed World Bead.

When the brother and sister met, Qian Hao and Qian Yue cried with joy...

Ten days later, Yang Kai suddenly received Luo Li’s summon and immediately left his secluded room for Pure Ice Peak.

Luo Li’s voice sounded much better than before; obviously, the Origin King Grade Spirit Pill had played its role. Yang Kai did not know why she called him to Pure Ice Peak at this time, but he could vaguely guess that it had something to do with Su Yan.

Since Su Yan entered Pure Ice Peak that day, she had not returned.

Yang Kai was not worried because he could still sense that Su Yan was safe and sound.

A short time later, Yang Kai arrived at the summit of Pure Ice Peak. The scenery here was as simple as ever, with nothing of note except for the small, thatched shed.

Luo Li sat cross-legged inside this small hut, her aura stable, and even her complexion somewhat rosy.

Her injuries had obviously healed.

“You’ve arrived,” Luo Li motioned Yang Kai to sit down and talk.

Yang Kai turned his head around and asked with a slight frown, “Where is Su Yan?”

He did not see any trace of Su Yan here.

“Young Hero and Su Yan seem to share a kind of spiritual bond, so can’t you tell where she is?” Luo Li smiled without answering. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Was she testing him?

Yang Kai curled his lips slightly before immediately casting his eyes towards a cold pond not far away.

This cold pond was only about five metres in diameter and was filled with the purest of water; however, it was impossible to see to its bottom, so there was no telling how deep it was. Above the pond, there was a thin layer of white Qi which seemed to be composed of the purest Ice Attribute energy.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense instinctually but quickly took it back as a look of alarm filled his face, not daring to repeat his actions.

The last time he came here, he noticed this cold pond, but had not gone to observe it too closely. This time though, under his Divine Sense’s investigation, he was quite surprised.

A kind of Domain surrounded this cold pool which blocked his Divine Sense from penetrating it too far and even managed to freeze some of his Spiritual Energy the moment he tried.

Because of the Soul Warming Lotus, Yang Kai’s Spiritual Energy was comparable in intensity to that of an ordinary Origin King.

What exactly was this cold pond then, and how was it so powerful?

Even so, Yang Kai could clearly sense that Su Yan was somewhere deep inside this cold pond.

“This is my Ice Heart Valley’s Heavenly Blessings Frozen Pond!” Seeing the look of doubt on Yang Kai’s face, Luo Li took the initiative to explain, “Together with Brilliant Flame Sect’s Heavenly Thunder Fire, they make up Scarlet Wave Star’s two Heavenly treasures. Those who enter the Heavenly Blessings Frozen Pond may receive the good fortune of Heaven, assuming they can withstand its extreme cold.”

“Oh, what kind of blessings does it bestow?” Yang Kai looked towards the cold pond with curious eyes, wondering about its mysteries.

“For those who cultivate Ice Attribute Secret Arts, the Heavenly Blessings Frozen Pond is the most precious of opportunities. The reason why my Ice Heart Valley was founded in this place was precisely because of this cold pond. It can transform a cultivator’s innate physique to make it more compatible with Ice Attribute Energy. The seniors of my Ice Heart Valley have all benefited from this cold pond.”

Yang Kai nodded gently and calmly.

Luo Li continued, “Additionally, every Origin King Realm master of my Ice Heart Valley, before their predestined time of death, deposited some of their Domain into this cold pond, allowing anyone who enters it to comprehend the mysteries of Ice Domain.”
