Chapter 57 - One big, one small

“What are you talking about?” Hu Jiao Er’s face changed as she forced out a smile: “I don’t understand.”

He couldn’t have found out that she was impersonating her younger sister, right? It’s not possible. He was only at the tempered body ninth stage, how could he possibly see through her, an initial element stage practitioner’s schemes? Nonetheless, she and her younger sister looked almost the same; regardless of if it was their voices or figures, they were all similar. Even the elders in the group often mistook them for each other, how could he have such an ability?

Kai Yang looked at her indifferently, lightly laughing: “Lady, then you are unwilling to admit it?”

“Admit what? I really don’t know what you are talking about.” Hu Jiao Er insisted for the last time.

Kai Yang massaged his temples and helplessly said: “Then I shall say it clearly. Lady, you are not Hu Mei Er. I think.......you are her older twin sister.”

Hu Jiao Er looked on blankly, before recovering and chuckled: “Why do you say this?”

This time, she didn’t force it anymore, but looked at Kai Yang full of interest, she also wanted to know in what aspect she had exposed herself. If Kai Yang couldn’t give any concrete reasons why, then it would be clear that he was using words to swindle her.

It could be that he currently held suspicions, but was ultimately unsure, therefore he wanted her to admit it. This is was what Hu Jiao Er guessed was going on.

“Lady, you are now testing my observation skills.” Kai Yang didn’t get angry and he laughed. Standing up, he walked over to the table and picked up the teacup from which he had drunk from earlier and pursed his lips: “Actually, I still wasn’t sure that you really were not Hu Mei Er. Though now, I am certain that you are not her!”

Hu Jiao Er stared blankly and became really angry, to the point that she wanted to grind her teeth; it turns out that his words just then really were probing her! This infuriated her! She, a initial element practitioner, with a moment’s carelessness was played by this tempered body youngster. This was such a defeat, she had lost much face.

She held no interest in denying it further. Hu Jiao Er laughed softly, and repositioned herself on the bed, displaying her alluring body fully, while her bewitching eyes sized Kai Yang up. Her voice gentle, she said: “At what moment did you start having your doubts?”

“From the time I drank the tea.” Kai Yang lightly hit the teacup within his hands, “Although the tea was very pleasant, it couldn’t fully cover the female scent. Also, on this cup there is a faint marking of lips, and I concluded that it hadn’t been too long since someone last used it right? And that person should be Lady Hu Mei Er.”

(TLN: GG Kai Yang. What are you trying to be? Sherlock? This is xianxia not a detective/mystery novel. -_-)

“Just from that, you didn’t believe I was Mei Er?” Hu Jiao Er was amazed.

“Of course it wasn’t just from that.” Kai Yang slowly shook his head, “The second point that arose my suspicion was your temperament! I do not believe that in ten days or so, a woman’s temperament can undergo such a large change. Putting it nicely, Lady Mei Er’s charm is more young and tender, whereas your charm is more mature and developed.”

“I like the sound of that.” Hu Jiao Er started to laugh while covering her mouth, “Please continue, do you have any more reasons?”

“Thirdly, your scent and Lady Mei Er’s are very similar, but if you are to smell carefully, they are still different. Her’s is more sweet while yours possesses a more subtle elegance.”

“Stinking brat!” Hu Jiao Er’s face was a nice pink hue because Kai Yang’s somewhat straightforward answers had caused her to be unable to maintain her calm. Thinking back at how she had wanted to probe him and the self-sacrifices she had made, Hu Jiao Er couldn’t help but want to slap this confident male in front of her into a meat patty.

“Fourthly......” Kai Yang ignored Hu Jiao Er’s oppressive glare and continued to speak.

“There is more.......” This startled Hu Jiao Er. She would have never guessed that this tempered body youngster would be able to see this many holes, in her seemingly flawless plan.

“He he, the fourth point is the injury on this lady’s foot. That injury looks like it is a sprain, but it is really a self-inflicted injury, caused internally and this was the greatest clue. Although Lady Mei Er is a young lady, she is still a martial practitioner. How could it be so easy for her to sprain her ankle?”

“This was actually my own negligence.” Hu Jiao Er lightly nodded her head. Back then, she was only concerned with revealing Kai Yang’s true colours, thus she had not thought too deeply.

As she lifted up her head, she saw that Kai Yang was still deep in thought, so Hu Jiao Er said: “Don’t tell me you there were more flaws that you saw through.”

Hu Jiao Er was quite unconvinced. How could her plan, that she thought was flawless and perfect, actually be full of holes and flaws in his eyes? Not to mention all of his analysis was clear and logical, leaving no room for argument. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Looking at this stinking brat filled her with loathing.

If he dared to point out anymore flaws, this Lady would definitely show him some attitude. He completely forgot to leave others some face.

“Then I’ll say no more.” Kai Yang replied as he wrinkled his brows.

Hearing this, Hu Jiao Er became unhappy and her charming eyes turned frosty. Laughing captivatingly, biting down with her ivory teeth she spat out a single word: “Speak!”

“I better not say anymore!” He said shaking his head.

Hu Jiao Er’s anger rose: “If I want you to speak then speak. How could there be someone like you who likes leaving a person hanging.”

Kai Yang bitterly laughed: “I’m afraid that if I say it, I could cause this lady to become angry.”

Her almond eyes narrowing, she replied: “Make me angry? What is this flaw, is it an upsetting thing?”

“En.”

“Then I want to hear it even more.”

“But you must promise me that you not become angry.”

“If you don’t say it, then how will I know whether or not I will be angry or not?”

“Nevermind then.”

“You.......don’t you know that when you are arguing with a woman, you should back down a step?” Hu Jiao Er was gloomy inside. This youngster seemed shrewd, but he was actually a stubborn and cold headed youth, without a shred of sensitivity.

“If I back down a step, I would become injured. I think..........I would be unable to match you.” Kai Yang’s face was serious.

“I see that you still have some sensitivity!” Laughing proudly, Hu Jiao Er sprang up from the bed, carrying with her a sweet aroma, both from the bed and herself over to the table. Her clothes dancing around, she sat down and gracefully looked towards Kai Yang. Muttering for a while, she responded: “Okay then, I promise that I will not become angry with you.”

“And you also promise not to hit me.”

“Fine!” Biting her ivory teeth, Hu Jiao Er continued, “Tell me, what is this final flaw?”

His face stern Kai Yang answered: “Actually, it can’t really be counted as a flaw. It’s just that between you and Lady Mei Er there is a slight difference between you.”

“Where is this difference?” Hu Jiao Er looked at him oddly because she and her younger sister were both practically carved from the same mold. So where would this difference be?

Kai Yang opened and closed his mouth and hesitated for a good while before mumbling out: “It’s your buttocks, one side is smaller than the other! It is incomparable to Lady Mei Er’s well portioned one!”

As soon as he said this, Hu Jiao Er’s face suddenly became bright red and all of her initial element stage World Qi burst out, engulfing the house in a powerful gale.

“Please remember the words you just said!” Remaining calm, his heart steady, Kai Yang reminded her faintly.

Hu Jiao Er’s imposing air unexpectedly receded. She was so furious her entire body was shaking yet she could not vent her anger, she nearly shattered her ivory teeth from biting down too hard. It wasn’t till after a long time had past that she banged the table and spoke out in her sweet voice: “Utter rubbish!”

For a proper girl to utter these coarse words, one could only imagine Hu Jiao Er’s current rage.

This brat should be made into mincemeat, for he dared to evaluate her buttocks as one small and one big. Is this something a man should say? How is one smaller than the other? Aren’t they clearly well proportioned?

This stinking brat, I’m afraid that you don’t know how to write the word death right?
