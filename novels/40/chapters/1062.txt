Zong Ao never planned to monopolize such huge benefits all to himself.

These droplets were discovered by Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, and Rainfall Star was a Cultivation Star under Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce’s control. Zong Ao had relied on his aloof status to take eighty percent of the Profound Yin Sunflower Water, but this was the limit, if he were to try to take it all, he couldn’t guarantee that Ha Li Ka and the others present wouldn’t disregard his face and act against him.

Zong Ao didn’t have confidence he could deal with so many masters at or above his own cultivation realm.

As such, he took the initiative to step back, leaving ten drops of Profound Yin Sunflower Water for them!

Ha Li Ka and the others heard Zong Ao’s words and couldn’t contain their shock, soon feeling their blood boil with excitement as they cupped their fists, “Many thanks Grandmaster, although Five Coloured Meteor Essence is rare, we can still procure some.”

“Good, then you best move quickly, only Heaven knows when these Profound Yin Sunflower Water will suddenly fall down and sink to the star’s core,” Zong Ao waved his hand and walked out while holding his own container.

Ha Li Ka did not dare to delay, leaving only the middle-aged woman to stand guard here while he and Lin Mu Feng rushed back to the branch to search for Five Coloured Meteor Essence inside their warehouse.

Yang Kai followed silently behind Zong Ao all the way out of the Ancient Ruins.

Afterwards, the pair summoned their Star Shuttles and returned to the mountain valley palace.

Back inside the room, Xue Yue was still sleeping peacefully, just as Yang Kai had left her, and after confirming that nothing was wrong with her, Yang Kai immediately went to find Zong Ao.

It seemed that because he had acquired a precious treasure like Profound Yin Sunflower Water, Zong Ao was extremely jubilant, and when Yang Kai came over, he was crazily performing Alchemy inside his Pill Room to vent his excess energy.

Zong Ao poured his Saint Qi into the several dozen pill furnaces, causing all of them to hum. Magical and mysterious Spirit Arrays were constructed inside the pill furnaces by Zong Ao simultaneously as he scattered herbs from his Space Ring like snowflakes, rapidly condensing various different medicinal liquids all at once.

Yang Kai couldn’t help his eyes from widening as he stared at this incredible scene.

He had never thought such a frenzied type of Alchemy existed in this world where one person actually used more than two dozen pill furnaces, refining several dozen types of pills, all at the same time!

At this moment, he finally understood why Zong Ao could produce so many pills for Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce.

Judging from his fluid movements and obvious proficiency, Zong Ao had done this more than once or twice and had created a shocking yet systematic method of mass pill refining.

Yang Kai possessed a Conflagrated Knowledge Sea and had mastered various ancient Spirit Arrays which gave him many unique advantages in Alchemy, but he still had no way to replicate the astonishing scene in front of him.

At most, Yang Kai figure he could handle four or five pill furnaces by himself.

There are always higher Heavens and one must always strive to improve! Yang Kai felt a deep sense of inspiration and respect for Zong Ao and simply stood in the door, carefully observing this Grandmaster’s movements.

Zong Ao showed no intention of driving him away, allowing him to watch all he wanted, the excitement on his face never once fading, instead becoming more and more flushed. The delicate Spirit Arrays which he portrayed with his Saint Qi appeared in different pill furnaces, melding together with the ones already present to create even more profound designs, providing great catalytic effects to his Alchemy.

Everything was smooth and methodical, without the slightest flaw apparent.

After half a day, inside the Pill Room, various pill aromas wafted through the air, a single whiff of which could refresh a person’s spirits and warm their body.

Yang Kai’s eyes became even more focused.

“Come!” Zong Ao shouted suddenly, and the several dozen pill furnaces all trembled as their lids flew off and coloured pills shot out, each one falling like a single raindrop into pre-prepared jade bottles.

Zong Ao tossed a restorative pill into his mouth, recovering his own Saint Qi while he strode over impatiently to the jade bottles, picked them up, and began checking through them one by one.

After a long time, he finished his inspection, and a somewhat dissatisfied look appeared on his face as he grumbled, “En, only two, pills are really hard to refine!”

Saying so, he put away two pills which had formed Pill Veins into another bottle before tossing the rest away.

This scene was somewhat familiar, as Yang Kai had once seen Zong Ao perform it when he first brought Xue Yue here, causing his brow to furrow as he asked, “Is Senior’s Alchemy method attempting to increase the chance of Pill Veins appearing?”

Zong Ao turned and sat in his chair, grinning as he nodded, “You have some good eyes boy. En, this old master created such a troublesome Alchemy method just to increase the chance of forming Pill Veins!”

After a pause, he continued, “The appearance of Pill Veins is something decided by luck, even the best Alchemists cannot guarantee that the pill they refine will surely form Pill Veins, but when a skilled Alchemist refines low-grade pills, the chances of Pill Veins forming will be much greater. This old master has been studying the production of Pill Veins for hundreds of years, and it was not until a hundred years ago that he struck upon the idea of producing them by increasing the total volume of pills. If not for this, why would this old master not charge Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce anything, essentially performing Alchemy for them for free? En, if not for this old master wanting them to provide me with an abundance of herbs, how could I have let them take advantage of me for so long?”

Refining pills like Zong Ao consumed far too many spirit grasses and spirit medicines, without the vast capital of a great force behind him, it would be impossible to continue this practice for long.

Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce was the richest force in the entire Star Field so it was naturally the best choice. Zong Ao and Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce’s cooperation greatly benefited each other.

“How is Senior’s progress?” Yang Kai asked with interest.

Zong Ao sighed softly, “Difficult, far too difficult! The longer you pursue this path, the more you find how difficult refining pills really are. This old master isn’t afraid of making a little boy like you laugh, but after so long, my success rate is only one or two out of every hundred pills with Pill Veins. En, this old master means pills above Saint King Grade of course.”

One or two out of every hundred, in short, he needed to refine a hundred pills to get one or two with Pill Veins.

This percentage may seem small, but considering the entire Alchemy profession, it was already a sensational number.

Many Alchemists would spend their entire lives and only refine one or two pills with Pill Veins out of sheer luck.

But every time Zong Ao performed this mass Alchemy, he would almost always produce at least one such pill.

“This old master has even managed to refine a few Saint King Grade pills that formed Pill Clouds. Would you like to take a look, little boy?” Zong Ao spoke with a very proud and playful expression.

Pill Veins were hard to come by, but Pill Clouds were even rarer!

Zong Ao had collected tens of thousands of pills with Pill Veins so far, but he only had a handful that had formed Pill Clouds, each of which he regarded as a treasure. When he was feeling down, he would often take out these Pill Cloud pills to review, immediately lifting his spirits.

He had lived here in this dull environment for nearly a hundred years, and if it weren’t for the great obsession in his heart, delving into the profound mysteries of the Alchemic Way, even with his great strength he would have gone stir crazy.

Now that he suddenly had the young Alchemist Yang Kai here to accompany him, he naturally wanted to show off a bit.

“Junior does not dare to covet Senior’s treasures!” Yang Kai didn’t give him a chance to show off though, which caused Zong Ao to grumble in disappointment, “Ignorant child, such a great opportunity is not something easy to grasp, it looks like your accomplishments in Alchemy are bound to be limited!”

Pills which formed Pill Veins were a rarity in the world. In the Alchemy world, this kind of thing, regardless of the grade, even if it was Earth Grade or Mysterious Grade, would be considered a treasure. Excellent Alchemists, by observing and emulating, may be able to gain some insights from just observing them.

Not to mention Zong Ao’s pills which had formed Pill Cloud were all Saint King Grade pills! These few pills were the ultimate culmination of his past hundred years of work.

Today, he had taken the initiative to display them, yet was actually rejected by Yang Kai. Zong Ao immediately felt as if a bucket of cold water had been poured on his hot face, his mood immediately dampening.

How could he have known that back on Tong Xuan Realm, Yang Kai had already seen and even eaten a pill that formed Pill Clouds, and whether it was Yang Kai himself or Xia Ning Chang, when performing Alchemy, their odds of producing Pill Veins were higher than his own by several times.

“Senior, Junior has led you to the Profound Yin Sunflower Water, and Senior has reaped great gains as a result, isn’t it time you inform this Junior how to rescue my Young Lady?” Yang Kai ignored Zong Ao’s ugly expression and took the initiative to bring up the previous transaction. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Hmph! Blinded by a beauty!” Zong Ao muttered in dissatisfaction again, he obviously thought Yang Kai and Xue Yue had a deep sentiment between them, causing this boy to act so anxiously.

Although he was a little displeased with Yang Kai right now, a deal was a deal, and Zong Ao kept his promise, flatly saying, “To save her, you just need to feed her a Purple Heart Soul Restoring Pill!”

After saying this, he shot Yang Kai a mocking grin, clearly taking pleasure in his misfortune.

“Purple Heart Soul Restoring Pill?” Yang Kai frowned, thinking quickly.

While Zong Ao had gone looking for someone to build a container to receive the Profound Yin Sunflower Water, Yang Kai had flipped through the pile of ancient books inside Zong Ao’s study and learned many pill recipes, the Purple Heart Soul Restoring Pill was one of them.

Pondering for a moment, he soon remembered what grade of herbs was required to refine the Purple Heart Soul Restoring Pill.

“An Origin King Pill?” Yang Kai paled, calling out in alarm.

“Naturally it is an Origin King- Grade pill!” Zong Ao grinned, “Profound Yin Sunflower Water is among the rarest and most powerful cultivation treasures. Do you think the damage caused by it would be easy to restore? Only the Origin King-Grade Purple Heart Soul Restoring Pill can accomplish this. You should be more aware of the danger this little girl is facing than anyone else. Not only is her vitality frozen, even her Soul Avatar cannot form. Treating such a condition will be incredibly difficult, of course.”

Yang Kai’s face turned dark.

Zong Ao also said, “Boy, I advise you to give up. Let’s not even discuss how few Alchemists in the entire Star Field can refine Origin King Pills, simply finding the materials is not something you can accomplish. Finding a ten-thousand-year-old Soul Returning Flower alone is impossible.”

The Soul Returning Flower wasn’t an incredibly rare or precious herbs, and could be found on any Cultivation Star, but in order to refine the Purple Heart Soul Restoring Pill, one with a medicinal age of ten thousand years was essential.
