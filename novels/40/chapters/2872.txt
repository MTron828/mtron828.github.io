Saint Artifacts, the weapons that had the ability to shake the Heavens and shatter the Earth. These were rare treasures throughout the entire Demon Realm, and only Demon Saints were qualified to wield them.

As Demon Kings, they had seen a few Saint Artifacts before, and also felt the destructive power which radiated from such treasures, and therefore had some understanding of them.

At this moment, they were confused and in disbelief when Sha Ya claimed that she had found a Saint Artifact.

However, Sha Ya’s did not appear to be lying, and she did seem to be holding onto something.

So after a moment of hesitation, several Demon Kings rushed up, stood beside Sha Ya, and plunged their hands into the vortex, only to seemingly grasp nothing but chaotic emptiness.

A few of them turned their heads at Sha Ya suspiciously.

Sha Ya asserted anxiously, “Grab my arms!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Only then did the Demon Kings recover their senses and grab Sha Ya’s arms, their expressions turning to shock one after another as they felt a huge force in front of them that was contending with Sha Ya.

With a low roar, Demon Qi surged, and as if she had received divine assistance, Sha Ya suddenly took a step back, and immediately pulled out her arms that had been hidden in the portal.

In the next moment, dozens of shocked eyes gazed at the object Sha Ya was holding onto with all her might. Strictly speaking, the object had not even been completely withdrawn from the portal and only a section of it was exposed.

It was clearly the handle of a weapon, but no one knew what kind of weapon it was; however, it exuded an extremely pure and rich Demon Qi.

This Demon Qi was even purer than that of a Demon King.

“It really is… a Saint Artifact!” A Demon King whispered to himself, his eyes turning red in an instant. The other Demon Kings grew equally excited.

Although it was only just a glimpse of the object, and it was not completely extracted from the vortex, none of the Demon Kings present had any doubts anymore.

This was definitely a Saint Artifact, a Saint Artifact that only a Demon Saint could control!

In this shocking and stunning moment, an even more powerful force suddenly came out from the vortex. The force was so strong that it began to overwhelm the several Demon Kings. Caught off guard, they all exclaimed and pushed their Demon Qi madly.

Sha Ya let out a scream as blood spurted from her fair hands before she lurched back and fell flat to the ground. Even the Demon Kings who had just helped her staggered a few steps back.

The partially revealed unknown Saint Artifact disappeared without a trace, and the portal before them became calm again, leaving all the Demon Kings staring into the depths of the vortex in search of its traces.

Sha Ya’s gasps brought them back to their senses and immediately the surrounding Demon Kings turned to her to question her.

The bones of her palms were exposed, and in addition to her blood-stained hands, it was obvious that she suffered some injuries from the Saint Artifact just now. These injuries looked miserable, but it was not a big deal for a Demon King. What was worth paying attention to was the distinctive Demon Qi lingering in Sha Ya’s wound.

Every Demon King watched intently, with excitement etched on each of their faces. They knew that the trace of Demon Qi being left behind by the Saint Artifact was proof that what happened just now was not some shared illusion.

Sha Ya really did find a Saint Artifact inside, but unfortunately, they failed to see the entire Artifact in the end, which was a bit regrettable.

“Sha Ya, what Saint Artifact was that?” The Shadow Demon started. Even he, who had always been able to keep his calm, could not control the excitement in his voice at this moment.

Sha Ya’s eyes flashed as she recalled, “A War Hammer!”

“A War Hammer!” The Demon Kings drew a sharp breath.

Bao Qi quickly questioned, “What did you see? Was it dangerous inside?”

Sha Ya shook her head, “It wasn’t. It actually seemed like a quiet and picturesque world. After some exploration, I saw the Saint Artifact, and… the body of the Ancient Saint!”

Eyes lit up and all turned eagerly to the vortex.

Although the information that Sha Ya provided was not much, it was sufficient, and that glimpse of a Saint Artifact brought a fatal appeal to the many Demon Kings.

Bao Qi took a deep breath and continued loudly, “Since we know that there are no dangers inside…”

Before he could finish his words though, the Shadow Demon suddenly let out a peal of strange laughter. However, the Demon Kings were even more bewildered that his voice came from a different direction. When they looked towards the direction of the voice, they found that the Shadow Demon had already dived into the vortex in a flash, while the black shadow that remained outside was obviously a diversion that immediately vanished as soon as he entered the portal.

“Mo Ke Tuo!” The Bone Demon Fei Li shouted sharply, unwilling to be outdone, and chased after him instantly.

Seeing this, the other Demon Kings wasted no time listening to Bao Qi’s nonsense. Afraid that they would miss out on this opportunity, they immediately rushed into the vortex, disappearing one after another.

Standing in place, Bao Qi watched his former companions with a strange look on his face, losing all interest in trying to say anything. Only after everyone else had gone in did he turn to Sha Ya and ask, “What the hell was that?”

He did not believe that it really was a Saint Artifact, but he could not come up with another reasonable explanation for what he saw.

Sha Ya stood up, her bloody hands healing at a visible speed, very quickly becoming a delicate jade white shade again, giggling as she replied, “Didn’t you see it clearly by yourself?”

Bao Qi frowned, “But…”

But where did Sir Shaman Niu get a Saint Artifact from? There were only a few Demon Saints present during this invasion, and although they had a great battle with the foreign race’s Shaman Saints not long ago, no one had died, and no Saint Artifacts had been lost.

“Go in and take a look and you will know.” Sha Ya giggled and stepped into the vortex, entering the Sealed World Bead without any hesitation.

Bao Qi was reluctant to follow after her; after all, he was the one who led so many Demon Kings into this trap. Although it was by Yang Kai’s orders and not his own intentions, he really could not bring himself to face them. However, he still could not restrain his own curiosity, and after a moment of hesitation, he grit his teeth and walked into the portal.

In the Sealed World Bead, the group of Demon Kings were already raising a riot. They each treated everyone else present as if they were their mortal enemies. The fighting was fierce as Demon Qi surged, and powerful Divine Abilities bloomed one by one, each one more ruthless and malicious than the last.

Bao Qi, who had just entered, was startled by the situation in front of him. He could not help but feel a little dazed and instinctively thought that he was hallucinating, but when he took a closer look, he found that he was not. The Demon Kings, who were united earlier, were really mercilessly fighting amongst themselves now.

Just when Bao Qi was in a daze, his gaze was attracted to a War Hammer hovering mid-air. The handle of the War Hammer looked familiar as it was clearly the one they all saw earlier, but now the entire body of this weapon was visible. There was also confirmation of its identity as a Saint Artifact now.

Because the pure Demon Qi that pulsed from this War Hammer could not be faked.

The Saint Artifact War Hammer kept changing hands throughout the battle. Whoever got hold of the War Hammer would be attacked by the other Demon Kings, so it is impossible for someone to keep it for long. It was impossible for even the Shadow Demon, Mo Ke Tuo, or the Bone Demon, Fei Li, whose powers were at the peak of this group.

“What a bunch of fools!” Sha Ya’s sneers sounded nearby.

Bao Qi turned his head to look around, and saw Sir Shaman Niu and Sha Ya, not knowing when they appeared beside him. Sha Ya watched the battle in front of her with mockery, while Sir Shaman Niu looked indifferent as if he was watching a children’s fight.

“Sir… That Saint Artifact…” Bao Qi could not help asking the question in his heart.

“It’s real,” Yang Kai replied shortly.

Bao Qi was shocked and immediately wanted to ask more, but did not dare to open his mouth.

The Demonic War Hammer was indeed real. This was a trophy Yang Kai obtained outside Maplewood City. It was the weapon of the ancient One-Eyed Great Demon and was handed over to the Embodiment after Yang Kai refined it.

However, the Embodiment had been fusing with Divine Spirit Shi Huo’s Source and was still unconscious, so the Demonic War Hammer had not been put to use recently.

Today though, Yang Kai had turned it into the perfect bait, one that even Demon Kings could not resist, causing them all to step into this trap.

“Sir, is it okay for you to show up like this?” Sha Ya asked curiously. It was still acceptable for Bao Qi and Sha Ya to be standing by and watching. Even if doubts surfaced in the other Demon Kings, they didn’t have the time and energy to spare on them right now.

Strangely though, Yang Kai’s presence did not attract any of the Demon King’s attention at all, with none of them even glancing in his direction.

Yang Kai smiled and explained, “Since I control everything here, I naturally have a way to prevent them from sensing me.”

Sha Ya let out a sound, expressing understanding.

Yang Kai continued, “It’s time for you to do your job!”

Sha Ya responded, “Sir, please protect me carefully!”

Immediately, she drew a deep breath, and screamed, “I’m the one who found the Saint Artifact, it’s mine!” Her tender body flickered as she joined in the chaotic melee, attempting to snatch the Demonic War Hammer. But her strength was at the bottom of the many Demon Kings present, so even though she put in her best effort, she still could not make her way into the inner circle, causing ‘anxiety and helplessness’ to cover her face.

The battle of the Demon Kings was bloody and brutal, each of them stopping at nothing in order to obtain the Demonic War Hammer. It did not take long for someone to be injured, but the injury did not extinguish their fighting spirit and instead roused their ferocity. As a result, as time passed, the battle became increasingly intense.

The Demonic War Hammer was constantly changing owners, and after an initial round of confrontation, the relatively weak Demon Kings no longer dared to approach the centre of the battlefield and could only constantly wander around the edges, looking for opportunities to intervene. In this way, Sha Ya finally had a few companions, and she no longer looked out of place.

This battle of Demon Kings lasted for more than an hour before a roar echoed loudly, “Stop!”

The Demon Kings stopped their actions instinctively, and drew a distance from each other, looking towards the place where the sound came from.

Over there stood Fei Li, the Bone Demon, whose bones had become loosely attached. Every movement made was accompanied by a worn clicking sound, and the ghost fire that had been dancing wildly in his eye sockets earlier had dimmed noticeably.

The other Demon Kings were in similar states, their originally strong auras having grown significantly weaker, causing them each to pant heavily for breath.

Shadow Demon Mo Ke Tuo was the current owner of the Demonic War Hammer. Wrapping black Qi around the War Hammer, he drew away from everyone else.

Fei Li did not look at the other Demon Kings, but cast his gaze into the air, the ghost fire in his eyes gazing at Bao Qi.
