Chapter 936, Hello Shadow King

Medicine King’s Valley, Hidden Cloud Peak, in a flash of light, Yang Kai appeared.

He didn’t fly in directly, but stopped just below the peak and walked up.

This was the holy land in the hearts of this world’s Alchemists, where the first under Heaven Alchemy Grandmaster Xiao Fu Sheng lived. All who came here would pay special attention to etiquette as they ascended the mountain.

In the past, Yang Kai had spent some time in Medicine King’s Valley, and although he never studied the Alchemic Way under Grandmaster Xiao, the old man had taught Yang Kai many valuable lessons.

On the path that Yang Kai trod, these lessons had helped him many times.

Yang Kai genuinely respected the kind Grandmaster and the two beautiful women who served him; they had provided the best resources and support for him without the slightest reservation.

Yang Kai was extremely grateful for their generosity and the assistance they freely gave him.

This time, Yang Kai was preparing to bring the three of them to Tong Xuan Realm.

Xiao Fu Sheng’s lifelong aspiration was to refine a Spirit Grade pill, but he was shackled by this world, unable to achieve this simple wish.

However, as long as he travelled to Tong Xuan Realm, it would not be difficult to refine such a pill given Xiao Fu Sheng’s means.

Yang Kai began to walk slowly towards the summit of Hidden Cloud Peak, glancing around at the herbs which were growing beside the path, recalling the two months that he had lived there.

Reminiscing, he couldn’t help smiling.

Medicine King’s Valley had not changed much since he was last here. Wu Zheng had led his group from High Heaven Pavilion to the Central Capital, committing all kinds of outrage along the way, but it seems he had yet to reach this place.

A moment later, Yang Kai reached the peak.

As always, there were only a few simple huts scattered around.

Two mature beauties were sweeping the leaves and dust in front of one of the huts, their hair wrapped in silk scarves lest they be dirtied while they worked.

Upon hearing Yang Kai’s footsteps, the two women raised their heads and wiped the thin trace of sweat from their foreheads as they stared at him suspiciously.

“Aunt Xiang, Aunt Lan!” Yang Kai smiled widely and shouted.

“You’re...” Aunt Xiang gawked for an instant before her beautiful eyes filled with pleasant surprise, gently putting down the broom in her hands and hurriedly asked, “Yang Kai?”

“En, it’s me.”

Aunt Lan also hurried over and gently nodded as she looked him over, pursing her lips and smiling, “After so many years, I could hardly recognize you.”

“En, you look much stronger than before. You used to be just skin and bones,” Aunt Xiang greeted warmly, “Come in and sit down.”

“En.”

Inside the hut, at a simple table, Yang Kai, Aunt Xiang, and Aunt Lan sat down with three cups of light tea set before them.

Aunt Lan said, “We don’t have much to entertain with, but make yourself at home.”

“Aunt Lan is too polite,” Yang Kai drank the tea in front of him and smiled, “Although I haven’t seen you two for many years, Aunt Lan and Aunt Xiang haven’t changed at all; you’re both as young as ever.”

The two women looked at each other and smiled.

“On the other hand, your tongue has grown slick and learned to sweet talk others,” Aunt Xiang directed a teasing look towards him, “Have you cheated many young misses with it?”

“How could that be?” Yang Kai waved his hand.

“I heard that you left the Central Capital more than ten years ago for unknown lands. Did you just return?”

“En, I came back a few days ago.”

“It’s good that you’ve safely returned. Before, Grandmaster would often mention you, saying you were a rare Alchemy talent yet you clearly didn’t know anything about the Alchemic Way. All those years ago, when you first arrived, it was like you had cheated him.”

“At that time... I really didn’t understand anything. Why haven’t I seen Grandmaster? Is he in retreat underground performing Alchemy?” Yang Kai asked.

The faces of Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan suddenly became gloomy as the smiles on their faces converged.

Yang Kai’s heart sank as a bad feeling rose within it.

“Grandmaster, he... he passed away five years ago,” Aunt Xiang spoke haltingly, her eyes becoming slightly wet as she whispered.

Yang Kai was startled and froze up, the discomfort in his heart increasing notably. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

It was only at that moment that he recalled that the reason Grandmaster Xiao had suddenly decided to recruit disciples was because he realized that he did not have many years left, causing him to act so anxiously.

Even so, it was a shock to Yang Kai that he had already departed from this world five years ago.

“Grandmaster...” Yang Kai opened his mouth.

“He achieved his wish!” Aunt Xiang resisted her sadness and gently took out a jade box from her pocket, “Seven days before he passed on, he consumed the last of his vitality to successfully refine a Spirit Grade Pill. This was the last work he had left behind.”

Yang Kai accepted the jade box, feeling as if he was holding a great weight in his hands, like it was not a pill but a newborn life instead.

When he opened it, he saw a pristine Spirit Grade Pill with a rich fragrance and a potent medicinal efficacy. Even an excellent Spirit Grade Alchemist may not be able to produce such a good pill.

“Grandmaster’s departure was very serene,” Aunt Xiang wiped the cover of her eyes and somehow squeezed out a smile, “Therefore we don’t need to feel sad for him. Before he passed on though, Grandmaster said that Spirit Grade was not the peak of Alchemy, and that there must be a grade above Spirit Grade.”

Yang Kai’s body shook as he was secretly surprised by Xiao Fu Sheng’s astonishing vision.

At this moment, Yang Kai seemed to understand why Xiao Fu Sheng was so determined to refine a Spirit Grade Pill. His goal wasn’t to increase his own Alchemy skills, but rather to break through the shackles of this world with his own power.

And he had succeeded.

A Spirit Grade pill, which had never been seen in this world, had been refined by him.

“Where is Grandmaster buried?” Yang Kai looked up and asked.

Aunt Xiang got up and said, “Come with me.”

In a secluded area of Hidden Cloud Peak, not far from the summit, stood a small mound of earth.

It was hard to believe that such a simple grave was actually the burial place of this world’s greatest Alchemist.

“Everything was done in accordance with Grandmaster’s wishes. Grandmaster’s bones are not here, instead he was cremated and his ashes scattered across the nearby rivers and lakes, returning him to nature. There are only a few of his memorabilia buried here.”

Yang Kai knelt in worship as Aunt Xiang stood behind him and explained.

“Grandmaster would certainly be very happy if he knew you, his in-name disciple, had come here,” Aunt Xiang covered her mouth and spoke through the tears she could no longer hold back, Aunt Lan also sobbing nearby.

“This is what I should do,” Yang Kai nodded gently.

......

Half a day later, atop Hidden Cloud Peak, Yang Kai said goodbye to Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan.

“Will the two of you really not consider it? From now on it may not be peaceful here anymore. This world has already been connected to a place called Tong Xuan Realm. In the future, there may be many masters with strength beyond anything you can imagine arriving here,” Yang Kai made one last attempt to persuade.

He wanted to bring these two women who had taken such good care of him in the past back to the Central Capital and then on to Tong Xuan Realm, but they had actually refused his kindness and insisted on staying here.

“No, we have lived here all our lives and don’t wish to move anywhere else... Grandmaster is here too, we should remain here to accompany him. If we were to leave, he would be all alone.”

“You thinking so much of us is more than enough.”

Yang Kai could only sigh helplessly.

The determination of these two was firm, Yang Kai could tell. He knew that it was useless to try to persuade them anymore so he simply said, “Then in the future, when I have time, I’ll certainly come back here to visit you. Right, if someone dares to come here looking for trouble, report my name to them, perhaps it will be useful.”

“En, we know,” Aunt Xiang smiled and nodded.

“Then do take care!” Yang Kai sincerely cupped his fists and bowed before turning and descending the mountain.

“You too must act carefully. Don’t become overconfidence,” Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan waved to him from the top of the peak.

Below Hidden Cloud Peak, Yang Kai carefully placed the jade box containing the Spirit Grade Pill refined by Xiao Fu Sheng inside the Black Book space before summoning the Flying Heavens Shuttle and flying off towards the west.

His next destination was the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land.

He had left the Central Capital this time mainly to visit two places, one was Medicine King’s Valley and the other was the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land.

He was going to see Shan Qing Luo.

This bewitching woman had always been very good to Yang Kai, and during the final battle with the Demon Lord, she had provided him much assistance.

The most important point though was that Yang Kai had engraved himself on her heart, forging a bond between them that could not be erased.

Since he had finally come back, naturally Yang Kai wanted to bring her to Tong Xuan Realm, lest she be bullied here.

As for what she wanted to do once they reached Tong Xuan Realm, Yang Kai did not plan on restraining her.

Two hours later, Yang Kai arrived outside Fragrance City.

This city was arguably the most prosperous place in the entire Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land and was the territory under Shan Qing Luo’s direct jurisdiction.

When the Demon Lord and most of the six Great Evil Kings died, the entire Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land had been plunged into chaos; only Fragrance City was not affected because the Beguiling Demon Queen returned.

The stability of this city stood in stark contrast to the rest of the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land which was filled with slaughter and death.

Many cultivators who didn’t want to spend all their time fighting or running would come to Fragrance City to seek a different way of life, creating great prosperity which in turn attracted more people to come.

Upon arriving here, Yang Kai began to drag his feet as he pondered about what kind of attitude to use when he saw this enchantress again.

This seductress was simply too alluring. If she behaved affectionately and spoiled him, Yang Kai wasn’t certain he would be able to endure. If he couldn’t resist her charms, his ‘innocence’ would be at great risk.

Moreover, Yang Kai knew she would not hesitate to act this way.

After a short delay, Yang Kai arrived in front of Shan Qing Luo’s palace in Fragrance City.

At the entrance to the palace, there was a ragged beggar who was leaning against the wall, clasping his hands in front of him as he closed his eyes. His image was quite awkward, his hair was messy and his beard unkept, as if he had not groomed himself for many years.

Everyone who passed by pretended to not see him, clearly feeling it would troublesome to get involved with him.

Yang Kai glanced at him casually before his mouth curled into a strange smile. Slowly walking over while ignoring his stench, Yang Kai soon arrived in front of him.

When the noon sunlight was obscured by Yang Kai’s figure, the beggar opened his eyes slightly and looked up for a moment before soon closing them again and ignoring him.

It was as if he didn’t even see Yang Kai or was just pretending he didn’t exist.

Yang Kai however just grinned and lightly spoke, “Hello, Shadow King!”

The beggar’s body trembled as his eyes shot open, a trace of profound light flashing across the depths of his pupils. It seemed like it wasn’t until this moment that he recognized Yang Kai, his expression changing greatly and lightning surging up from his skinny body. In the next instant, his figure flickered and disappeared.
