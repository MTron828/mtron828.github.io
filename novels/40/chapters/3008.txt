Upon learning that, the conflicting emotions in Yang Kai’s heart weren’t as great as before anymore. He mulled over it for a bit before sitting down next to Lin Yun’er. Then, he listened to the bubbling sounds coming from the iron wok and appreciated the aroma in the air. He was waiting to eat!

After a while…

“It’s delicious! It’s so delicious!” Lin Yun’er was holding a large bone in her hands, exclaiming in delight as she chewed on its meat.

“Eat slowly!” Yang Kai reached up to wipe the grease from his face, “Nobody will snatch your food from you!”

Having said that, his speed wasn’t slow either. He had a small pile of bones next to him, but far less than Lin Yun’er’s as her bones were practically piled as high as a small mountain.

Truly worthy of being the descendent of a Divine Spirit, the Fire Qilin variant’s flesh contained first-rate essence. The moment Yang Kai bit into the meat, the juices flowed out and warmed his stomach.

Although there were no added seasonings, it was definitely the most delicious and scrumptious food Yang Kai had ever eaten. That iron wok seemed to have a way of making miracles happen. Despite cooking it so simply, the food turned out so delicious that one could get addicted to it. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

After eating several bites of the meat, Yang Kai scooped a big bowl and took a sip of the soup. Then, he glanced at Li Jiao, who was standing by the side, “Brother Li, do you want to have a taste?”

“N-No, it’s alright…” Li Jiao replied politely.

“Then why are you drooling? Stop speaking nonsense.”

Li Jiao laughed, “Then, I won’t hold back anymore.”

The idea was rather repulsive to him at first; after all, he, himself, was a descendent of a Divine Spirit. Suddenly cooking a descendent of a Divine Spirit in a pot might have smelt tantalizing, but it would probably spark some conflicting feelings in him. Still, he wasn’t in a position to turn down Yang Kai’s invitation. Besides, he was truly curious to have a bite; he wanted to know what it tasted like.

Walking over to the pot, Li Jiao reached out with his hand and fished out a rib. Asking for forgiveness in his heart, he took a small nibble. Then, his eyes widened in response. His speed increased significantly to the point where he was eating with the speed of a whirlwind.

“It’s delicious, right?” Yang Kai smilingly looked at Li Jiao.

Li Jiao nodded vigorously, “It’s good. It’s very good. I’m blessed with such good food when I’m with you, Palace Master Yang.”

Lin Yun’er only made a muffled sound. Taking advantage of the time Yang Kai and Li Jiao spent talking, she had already wolfed down even more of the meat and a few more bones had been added to the pile next to her.

Not to be outdone, the black puppy lay down next to the pot, grabbed a large piece of meat, and ate it with great relish.

An hour later, Lin Yun’er lay on the ground and patted her stomach with her hand. That huge Divine Spirit descendant had been cleanly devoured by the three of them. Not even a mouthful of soup was left over from their meal.

Lin Yun’er had a contented expression on her face, having finally eaten her fill. She had not eaten until she was satiated ever since she snuck out. When she was with her Master, she had never had to worry about her meals as he would take care of everything for her. She finally learned that life was not easy after leaving her Master’s side. Even eating a full meal was such a difficult task. All of a sudden, she began to miss her Master.

“Yun’er, why didn’t you use your trump card earlier?” Yang Kai had gotten a blade of grass from somewhere and was using it to pick his teeth. [I wonder what’s the story behind this iron wok, Unlimited Return. If Yun’er had summoned it from the beginning, that Sword Formation would have been taken care of easily.]

She squinted his eyes and said, “Master said the trump card can only be used if it is my last resort.”

[Her Master again… This little girl really seems to take her Master’s words as law.]

“I’ll bring you out to eat something better next time,” Yang Kai casually offered.

She was surprised, “Really?”

“En. The Ancient Wild Lands in the Eastern Territory is sure to have a lot of delicious food.”

[He even plans to target the Ancient Wild Lands!?] Li Jiao felt cold sweat breaking out on his forehead. [I heard a Divine Spirit guards that place… Palace Master Yang is too bold!]

“Thank you, Uncle Yang!” Lin Yun’er was overjoyed.

After lying down for a while, Yang Kai asked, “Where do you plan to go after this?”

Wind and Cloud Pavilion had been annihilated, so the little girl had achieved her goal. She had managed to let out the rage that had built up in her.

“I don’t know,” she shook her head. She had been bored and ran away from home without any real plans or objectives. Meeting with Yang Kai had been pure coincidence.

“Is that so…” Yang Kai pondered for a moment before saying, “Why don’t you come with me to the Northern Territory? I established High Heaven Palace there.”

“High Heaven Palace?” She immediately became interested when she heard those words. Lin Yun’er had been part of Shadowed Star’s High Heaven Sect for a while; thus, she felt a sense of familiarity when she heard the name and quickly nodded, “En.”

“Good. Then, let’s return tomorrow.” Yang Kai immediately made his decision. The matter related to Wind and Cloud Pavilion had become a rather huge deal as a top Sect had been annihilated just like that. If the two of them had been cultivators of the Western Territory, it might not have been as bad, but the key point was that none of them belonged to the Western Territory. If they remained in this place, they might attract the attention of the Sect run by the Great Emperor here. Night Shadow Great Emperor and Shadow Killer Palace were not parties that they could afford to offend so easily.

When Li Jiao heard those words, his spirits lifted. [Finally! I finally have the hope of going home after travelling with Yang Kai for such a long time!]

The night passed quietly and the next morning, Yang Kai began arranging a Space Array.

He originally wanted to find a hidden location in the Western Territory to place this Space Array, that way it would be more convenient for him to come and go in the future as he could directly access this territory. Unfortunately, he was not familiar with the Western Territory so finding such a place was not that easy. It might take up to a month or more; therefore, Yang Kai gave up on his original plans after careful consideration.

[Let’s go back first. If I need to come to the Western Territory again one day, I’ll just make some effort to come through here again.] Hence, he set about arranging the Space Array on one of the peaks of Wind and Cloud Pavilion.

Li Jiao was meditating by the side but he was also secretly paying attention to Yang Kai’s movements. As a Palace Master himself, he had sharp eyesight. Therefore, he noticed the extraordinary features of this Cross-Territory Space Array right away.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun’er had nothing to do so she played with the black puppy.

Half a day later, the Space Array was perfectly arranged; then, Yang Kai called them over. Lin Yun’er immediately ran up with the black puppy in her arms while Li Jiao also walked onto the Space Array.

Space Principles surged and enveloped the trio. Yang Kai’s expression became solemn as he circulated his Emperor Qi to power the array.

With a dazzling light, a feeling of weightlessness washed over the trio and they disappeared instantly. At that moment though, Yang Kai felt a strange power striking him. It was not strong, but incredibly masterful, actually managing to interfere with the teleportation.

Yang Kai was shocked, but before he could figure out what was wrong, a voice sounded in his Knowledge Sea, “Little brat, you’ve got some courage! How dare you try to abduct my beloved disciple? I will forgive you this once since it was not done out of malice, but the next time this happens, I’ll kill you!”

The voice sounded directly in Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea, making it clear his defences were completely penetrated, but what shocked Yang Kai even more was that he failed to notice the slightest signs of intrusion.

[How is this possible!? My Divine Sense is extremely powerful, comparable to that of a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master’s. What kind of person could seamlessly break through the defences of my Knowledge Sea and even send a message directly to my head without me noticing?]

Before Yang Kai could finish processing this thought, his vision blurred and by the time he regained his sight, he had already arrived at High Heaven Palace in the Northern Territory. He turned to the side and saw Li Jiao standing next to him, his brow deeply furrowed. It was clear that he had yet to recover from the side-effects of teleporting across domains. On the other hand, the black puppy stood by his feet with a blank expression. Only Lin Yun’er was missing!

Yang Kai’s expression changed drastically as he hurriedly tried to teleport himself back to check on the situation; however, when he poured his Divine Sense into the Space Array under his feet, he discovered that the connection with the Space Array in the Western Territory had been severed. [That’s impossible! Li Jiao and I have just teleported over! How could the connection be cut off so abruptly?!]

The Space Arrays Yang Kai arranged were all linked together, allowing teleportation between any of them freely. After teleporting about so many times, Yang Kai was certain that nothing was wrong with the array he had arranged, and it was not the kind of thing that would fail so easily. Then, he suddenly recalled the words that had sounded in his head just now and his expression changed again.

[Yun’er must have been picked up by her Master. Does that mean her Master had been following her around all this time? If that wasn’t the case, her Master couldn’t have taken her back in such a timely manner.] In other words, the reason why the connection to the array was cut off was that somebody had destroyed it on purpose. Needless to say, the person who did that was none other than Lin Yun’er’s Master.

Yang Kai cursed in his heart as this was the second time he encountered something like this. The last time it had happened in the Ancient Wild Lands. The array he left in the Ancient Wild Lands had been destroyed by Luan Feng, [I can’t believe this happened to me again!]

[Just who on Earth is Yun’er’s Master?! I can’t believe I didn’t even notice anything even though her Master had been following us for so many days.] Considering all this, Yang Kai couldn’t help leaking cold sweat.

[No! No! That’s not right!] He suddenly remembered that inexplicable sense of hostility he had felt when he was in one of the cities previously. That sense of hostility came and went quickly. At the time, he had dismissed it as part of his imagination. Now, it seemed as though it had not been an illusion but rather hostility from Yun’er’s Master!

[Why was he being hostile towards me?!] The words that had sounded in his head just now were also dyed with some prejudice. It left him feeling puzzled. [I don’t think I did anything to Yun’er that warrants such hostility…]

Upon figuring things out, Yang Kai felt relieved. As long as it wasn’t an issue with the transportation which caused Yun’er to be left behind, then it was fine. [Her Master must be one of the top existences in this world and have his own reasons for taking her back. Besides, I can tell that he cares very much about her from those words just now.]

…..

Lin Yun’er stood alone on the Space Array on the mountain peak in Wind and Cloud Pavilion, a puzzled expression on her face as she looked around. Unable to find anybody, she immediately became anxious and called out, “Uncle Yang! Uncle Yang!”

Nobody answered her so she called a few more times, but the surrounding area remained silent.

“Stop shouting,” a person’s voice suddenly rang out. As soon as the words sounded, a middle-aged man suddenly appeared on the mountain peak.

Lin Yun’er glanced in the direction of the sound and became surprised, “Master? What are you doing here?”

She ran over quickly and looked at the middle-aged man with a smile.

The middle-aged man sighed, “You would have been kidnapped if I hadn’t come. How could I not come?”

He had not planned to show up so soon. He had finally gotten himself a Legacy Disciple; moreover, one he cared about deeply. She had never disappointed him before in all the years that they had spent together and her cultivation had progressed extraordinarily quickly. Therefore, he doted on this little girl very much. All that talk about secretly running away from home was just her wishful thinking. How could she possibly escape from under his nose if he didn’t indulge in her whims?
