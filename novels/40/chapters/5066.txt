Human growth was limited, especially in the Open Heaven Realm.

How high a cultivator could eventually push their Martial Dao was decided the moment they ascended to the Open Heaven Realm.

Usually, after a person ascended to the Open Heaven Realm, they could only increase their Order by 2 regardless of how hard they cultivated.

This was the reason the Cave Heavens and Paradises spent lots of time and resources nurturing the brightest disciples from a young age. Only the disciples who directly ascended to the Fifth Order and above had the right to become High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters one day.

If a person directly ascended to the Fourth Order, the limit in their lifetime would be the Sixth Order.

However, after an Open Heaven Realm Master was corrupted by Black Ink Strength, they could break through this limitation and keep ascending to higher Orders.

This was an allure that many Open Heaven Realm Masters could not resist.

That was certainly the case for the Vice Sect Master of Lang Ya Paradise, Yuan Du. Despite his lofty status, he was still unable to resist this temptation, so he proactively sought to become corrupted and turn into a Black Ink Disciple. Ever since then, he became the source of disturbance in Lang Ya Paradise.

It was imaginable that once this news was spread, it would send a shockwave across the entire 3,000 Worlds; after all, Yuan Du wasn’t the only one who was unable to keep moving forward in the Martial Dao due to their innate limits.

However, most were not aware of the hidden dangers that came with this method. While Black Ink Strength could help an Open Heaven Realm Master achieve a breakthrough beyond their initial limitations, there was a price to pay, one that most people wouldn’t be able to bear.

Back in the Black Prison, Yang Kai had seen several Open Heaven Realm Masters who achieved a breakthrough with the help of Black Ink Strength.

Nevertheless, they all ended up in a horrible state.

The breakthrough beyond their limits and the sharp increase in their power could cause them to explode then and there, and those that did survive had their figures radically transformed, developing mishappen features and horrible tumours. In addition, their mental state deteriorated significantly, becoming far more aggressive and irrational.

The Black Ink Disciple in front of Yang Kai undoubtedly suffered such side effects.

The sarcoma on his neck, the hump on his back, and his unusually large build were all the result of the Black Ink Strength’s corruption.

In other words, this person wasn’t supposed to have ascended to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm. He broke through the limit by leveraging the Black Ink Strength. Even though he had successfully reached the next Order, his figure had also been transformed.

Yang Kai could clearly feel that even though the aura of this Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was dangerous, his foundation was unstable. Like an insect-infected building, it would fall apart when someone gently pushed it.

If this person kept cultivating to increase his strength, he would most likely explode as his body was no longer able to bear a power that was too great for him. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Countless thoughts flashed across Yang Kai’s mind as he secretly sighed. He then asked, “You are…?”

“So, it is Brother Liu,” Yang Kai nodded gently, “Is there anything I can help you with?”

Liu Zi An put on a big smile, “I heard that Sir Territory Lord personally took on a Black Ink Disciple, so I came here to have a look out of curiosity. Sir Territory Lord is powerful, so he’s usually not interested in ordinary Black Ink Disciples. I’ve not seen him taking one over the years. You’re the first one, Brother Yang.”

“I’m truly honoured, then,” Yang Kai replied humbly. He reckoned that Liu Zi An must have a reason for visiting him, so he stepped aside, “Please come in, Brother Liu.”

Without being overly polite, Liu Zi An stepped into the room.

Yang Kai then closed the door. This side hall was basically empty, so it must have been vacant for quite a long time. He hadn’t prepared anything since he had just gotten here; therefore, he fished out a table and some chairs from his Small Universe and invited the other party to have a seat.

Liu Zi An directly sat down on a chair.

After Yang Kai was seated as well, he asked, “Brother Liu, you said you’re a Black Ink Disciple under Sir Gui Liao?”

“Yes.” Liu Zi An nodded.

“How long have you been living here?” Yang Kai asked.

Liu Zi An smacked his lips and sighed, “It’s been 1,000 years. Not a short time, is it?”

“It’s indeed a very long time.” Yang Kai nodded, “I’m new to this place, so I know nothing about the Black Ink Clan. You’ll have to give me some guidance in the future, Brother Liu.”

Liu Zi An guffawed, “Of course, of course. Since we’re both working for Sir Territory Lord, you can just tell me if you need any help. Although we’re Black Ink Disciples, we’re of the same Race, after all. Let’s meet up more often whenever there’s a chance.”

“You’re right.” Yang Kai agreed with him, “Which Cave Heaven or Paradise did you come from?”

Liu Zi An waved his hand, “Since we’re Black Ink Disciples now, the past no longer has anything to do with us. There’s no need to talk about where we came from. Since you’re now within the Black Ink Clan’s territory, you should quickly try to understand your place.”

“Understood,” Yang Kai replied humbly.

Liu Zi An went on to say, “To be honest, I wasn’t used to it when I first came here; however, after coming into contact with more people, I’ve realised that the Black Ink Clan aren’t any different from Humans. You just have to get along with everyone else. If you want anyone to help you with something, or if you want to be regarded highly, you have to be on good terms with others. If you do that, you’ll be fine.”

A glint flashed through Yang Kai’s eyes when he heard that, “You have a point, Brother Liu.”

Since this guy had made it clear, Yang Kai was naturally aware of his intentions. He then rummaged through his clothes and fished out a Space Ring before pushing it towards him, “Since we’re friends now, I’d like to give you a small gift. I’ll definitely need your guidance in the future.”

Liu Zi An arched his brow and guffawed, “Well, you shouldn’t have. There’s actually no need for that.”

Despite saying that, he directly picked up the Space Ring and scanned it with his Divine Sense. The next moment, his smile froze.

There were only a few hundred thousand Open Heaven Pills in the Space Ring.

This number of Open Heaven Pills could only last him for half a month. Even though he was a Black Ink Disciple, he was still a Human; hence, the cultivation resources he needed were the same as what Humans would use.

An unfazed Yang Kai explained, “This is already half of all my current assets, Brother Liu. You should know that when Human soldiers go to war, they don’t bring a lot of resources with them.”

The same rule applied to all the Great Passes as they were worried that once a cultivator lost his or her life on the battlefield, their resources would be lost as well. Therefore, the cultivators who went out to fight would leave almost all their assets in their residences. That way, even if they were killed, their fellow clansmen could still take the resources and make use of them.

Yang Kai was aware of this rule, but those from Blue Sky Pass had never restrained him with it; therefore, all his wealth was still in his Small Universe.

Liu Zi An frowned upon hearing that as he was unable to refute Yang Kai since what he said was indeed the truth. The Black Ink Clan had obtained a lot of Space Rings from the Humans on the battlefields in the past, but there weren’t really any valuable items in those rings.

After giving it a thought, he said, “Forget it. It’s the thought that counts.”

“Many thanks for your understanding, Brother Liu.” Yang Kai cupped his fist, then said,” Since you’re Sir Gui Liao’s Black Ink Disciple, can you help me with something?”

Even though Liu Zi An had accepted the gift, he didn’t seem ready to lend him a hand; instead, he asked vigilantly, “What help do you need?”

Yang Kai replied, “Before Sir Hei Yuan entered the Black Ink Nest, he had told Sir Gui Liao to obtain a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit for me. Since you are Sir Gui Liao’s Black Ink Disciple, can you help me ask him when he’ll give me the Profound Yin Spirit Fruit?”

Upon hearing that, Liu Zi An was startled, “Sir Territory Lord ordered a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit be given to you?”

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded, then asked curiously, “What’s wrong with that?”

Liu Zi An sized him up and shook his head, “Nothing.”

Then, he rose from the chair, “I can help you ask Sir Gui Liao about it, but it’s not up to me to influence his decision.”

“Regardless, I thank you for helping me.”

“En,” Liu Zi An nodded impassively, “I’ll inform you when there’s any news.”

Yang Kai got up and saw him off, “See you around, Brother Liu.”

Liu Zi An left the place and waved his hand without turning his head.

Yang Kai sported a dispassionate expression as he watched him leave. Even though both of them were Humans, he didn’t think Liu Zi An genuinely wanted to get closer to him after their conversation.

This was different from his previous experience.

When he pretended to be a Black Ink Disciple and worked for Nu Yan back then, Yang Kai had been on good terms with B-2, D-4, and E-5. Even though they had different temperaments, they sincerely wanted to get along with him. Perhaps it was because they were all Humans.

However, Liu Zi An was different as he didn’t even seem to regard Yang Kai as someone from the same Race. Perhaps the Black Ink Strength had fully warped his temperament. Even though all Black Ink Disciples would have their thinking changed so they were completely loyal to the Black Ink Clan, the impact of Black Ink Strength was obviously more severe on Liu Zi An.

This must have something to do with the fact that Black Ink Strength had helped him achieve a breakthrough.

Yang Kai had no idea whether it was Liu Zi An’s own intention to visit him or if it was Gui Liao’s order.

It would be interesting if it was the latter. Why did Gui Liao want to probe him? He was Hei Yuan’s Black Ink Disciple on paper while Gui Liao was the designated person to handle the affairs in Hei Yuan’s territory. They basically had nothing to do with each other as they had never met prior to this, nor were there any grudges between them.

Since he was unable to figure it out, Yang Kai decided to put the matter aside. He then returned to his room and refined some Open Heaven Pills.

He wouldn’t dare to refine any resources to cultivate; after all, he had just told Liu Zi An that he was broke. It wouldn’t be sensible if he was suddenly able to fish out a set of Seventh-Order resources.

Moreover, there wasn’t any restriction around his room that could block Divine Senses. Any energy fluctuations in this place could easily be detected by anyone else.

At the same time, in a Grand Hall that was in the deepest part of the castle, Liu Zi An was standing in front of Gui Liao and reporting to him about his conversation with Yang Kai.

Gui Liao listened to it with an unenthusiastic expression.

After Liu Zi An was done with the report, he stole a glance at Gui Liao. Upon seeing that the latter was expressionless, he summoned his courage and asked, “Master, Yang Kai said that Sir Territory Lord had promised to give him a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit.”

Gui Liao grunted, “Yes, that’s true.”

Liu Zi An frowned, “Why does Sir Territory Lord treasure him so much? He’s a newcomer who hasn’t made any contributions. If he’s given such a reward right away, he’ll most likely become arrogant.”
