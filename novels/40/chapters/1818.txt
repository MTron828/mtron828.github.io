With Gui Zu’s Ten Thousand Soul Banner waiting for an opportunity, Zi Dong did not dare conceal anything and immediately said what he knew.

Collecting the nine Star Emperor Tokens would allow one to glimpse the secrets of the Great Emperor.

Although this sounded vague and mysterious, it still held an unparalleled attraction to those who pursued the Martial Dao.

Yang Kai frowned and grumbled. Yang Yan did tell him that collecting all nine Star Emperor Tokens would reveal some kind of secret, but she didn’t say what at the time, causing Yang Kai a great deal of frustration.

But Yang Yan not telling him must have been for a reason, so Yang Kai naturally did not press the issue.

Still, he already had six Star Emperor Tokens in his hand, so collecting all nine was not an impossible dream.

This may be the biggest secret in the Star Field, so how could Yang Kai not be moved?

Even Gui Zu fell into silent, solemn contemplation after listening to this.

“That’s all I know, so... can you two let me go now?” Zi Dong chose his words carefully and asked anxiously.

“Let you go?” Yang Kai coldly snorted, “You’re now just a Soul and your physical body has long been destroyed. The only reason you have not dissipated is because of this round bowl. Even if I let you go, where would you go?”

Zi Dong heard these words and was struck silent.

He wanted to escape from the hands of these two hateful people but forgot what state he was currently in. The Soul Sustaining Bowl was refined from Soul Sustaining Wood which, while sustaining his Soul, would not protect it from outside harm. If he tried to travel the Star Field in the Soul Sustaining Bowl, what was left of his Soul would soon be destroyed by the next Starry Sky Storm he encountered.

Considering all this, Zi Dong’s Soul became sluggish and his eyes grew dull as he muttered, “It’s over, it’s all over!”

Yang Kai gave Gui Zu a look, one Gui Zu understood immediately. Cackling, he taunted, “In that case, this old master has a good place for you to spend eternity.”

Saying so, he urged the power of his Ten Thousand Soul Banner, creating a suction force that tried to draw in Zi Dong’s Soul.

“Don’t!” Zi Dong came back to life and shouted, “Don’t swallow me!”

Although staying in the Soul Sustaining Bowl was a miserable end, it was definitely better than being swallowed by the Ten Thousand Soul Banner. The Yin Souls inside the banner lost all sense of self and only retained a base desire to kill. How could Zi Dong be resigned to become such a thing?

“Don’t swallow me! Please don’t swallow me...” Zi Dong struggled hard, but he was still unable to resist the suction of the Ten Thousand Soul Banner.

“Boy, stop resisting and obediently be swallowed,” Gui Zu snorted.

“No! I don’t want to!” Zi Dong shouted. Suddenly, as if thinking of something, he turned his head and looked at Yang Kai and said, “This friend, if you are willing to let me go, I can give you the Star Emperor Token Purple Star owns!”

“Wait!” Yang Kai quickly raised his hand and gestured to Gui Zu.

Gui Zu waved his hand and the Ten Thousand Soul Banner immediately fell silent.

Yang Kai stared at Zi Dong intently and quickly asked, “What did you just say?”

Zi Dong felt great fear in his heart as he glanced over at Gui Zu before quickly saying, “I said I can give you the Star Emperor Token of Purple Star. My Purple Star has its own Star Emperor Token!”

“Isn’t it this one?” Yang Kai raised the Star Emperor Token in his hand, “Does your Purple Star have two Star Emperor Tokens?”

“No,” Zi Dong shook his head quickly, “This Star Emperor Token does not belong to Purple Star. It was originally Xu Wei’s, but it fell into my father’s hand in the Severed World.”

“Xu Wei actually had such a treasure?” Yang Kai was shocked.

“According to him, he obtained it on some adventure many years ago...” Zi Dong explained weakly.

“So, your Purple Star really has another Star Emperor Token?” Yang Kai’s expression became ecstatic.

“I can guarantee with my life that it is true!” Zi Dong immediately swore, lest Yang Kai became impatient and kill him.

“You’re already dead, what use is there swearing on your life?” Gui Zu looked at him mockingly.

Zi Dong wailed, “What I said is true! Please believe me!”

“En, I believe you!” Yang Kai nodded.

“Sect Master, do you really want to gather all nine Star Emperor Tokens? No one has managed to accomplish that in ten thousand years. Just how many do you have now?” Gui Zu looked at Yang Kai and asked in confusion.

“If I told you I have six, would you believe me?” Yang Kai looked at Gui Zu sternly before waving his hand and taking out all six of the Star Emperor Tokens he possessed.

“Si...”

Gui Zu drew a sharp breath, his heart trembling wildly as his eyes bulged visibly.

“There are six in my hand, Purple Star has one, and as far as I know, Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce also has one. If I can acquire those two, only one will still remain missing!” Yang Kai licked his lips.

“The last piece... is in Sword Union’s possession,” Zi Dong spoke up softly.

Yang Kai turned a sharp stare towards him hearing this.

Zi Dong’s neck shrank as he muttered, “I’m not lying! Although few people among the top three super forces know this, I heard my father discuss it once, so this information is absolutely reliable.”

Yang Kai and Gui Zu looked at each other, and both saw the excitement in each other’s eyes.

Nine Star Emperor Tokens had been scattered across the Star Field, six were now in Yang Kai’s hand, and the whereabouts of the other three were known, which meant it really might be possible to gather all of them.

“Kid, you have promise,” Yang Kai glanced at Zi Dong and gave an approving look that gave Zi Dong great hope, which he quickly acted on.

“Don’t swallow me into that thing! I get you into Purple Star to the place where our Star Emperor Token is kept.”

“Take me to Purple Star so you can contact someone to avenge you?” Yang Kai sneered.

“How could I? I can only remain inside this Soul Sustaining Bowl now, so how could I even make contact with anyone?” Zi Dong called out about the injustice, “I just want to survive.”

Yang Kai nodded gently, “Then we can talk. Where is the Star Emperor Token of your Purple Star? How can I take it out?”

Zi Dong composed himself before explaining, “It doesn’t matter if I tell you because you two can’t gain access on your own, you need me to guide you there. The Star Emperor Token of my Purple Star is stored in a secret room that can only be accessed with the special key in my father’s Space Ring. As for the procedure to open it, only I can tell you...”

Speaking until here, Zi Dong suddenly seemed to have realized something and panicked, “Don’t compel me to tell you now! Even if I do, you’ll still need me to lead you there.”

“Rest assured, as long as you cooperate obediently, I promise not to hurt you!” Yang Kai put on a smile as he tempted, “If this matter is successful, I can let you go.”

“Don’t lie to me,” Zi Dong said dejectedly. “You killed my father, so how could you possibly let me go? All I ask now is you not extinguish my Soul.”

Yang Kai was stunned for a moment before he let out a chuckle, “Kid, you’ve suddenly become much smarter. Since you can understand your position, I can give you a guarantee. I may not let you go, but as long as you cooperate, I won’t kill you.”

“Do I have the right to refuse?” Zi Dong smiled wryly.

“It’s much easier working with smart people,” Yang Kai nodded with satisfaction before rummaging through Zi Long’s Space Ring, taking out a golden key a moment later, “Is this the key to the secret room?”

“En. Once you reach Purple Star’s Home Star, call me out again and I will tell you how to get in. I’m tired now and need to rest for a while.” Saying so, Zi Dong’s figure disappeared, obviously retreating to the innards of the Soul Sustaining Bowl.

Yang Kai put away the key and the Soul Sustaining Bowl before falling into a state of contemplation.

“Sect Master, it seems that there’s really hope this matter can succeed,” Gui Zu was also quite concerned with this plan. The reason why he didn’t care before was mainly that it was too difficult to gather all nine Star Emperor Tokens, but now that he could actually see hope, he couldn’t help feeling a little excited, “With this little brat’s help, obtaining Purple Star’s Star Emperor Token shouldn’t be difficult. As for the one Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce possess, based on your relationship with that little girl, it shouldn’t be a problem to obtain it, she’s the future successor of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, after all; as for the last piece held by Sword Union...”

“I have some friendship with Gu Jian Xin, so I can start negotiating with him!” Yang Kai said thoughtfully, “Star Emperor Tokens are indeed precious, but everything has a price. As long as I can offer a sufficient price, Sword Union shouldn’t refuse to sell it to me.”

“Then should we head to Purple Star now?” Gui Zu asked expectantly.

He also wanted to know what would happen after collecting all nine Star Emperor Tokens.

“There’s no rush! This matter is not urgent. I must go back to my homeland first and then back to the Sect. It won’t be too late to deal with this after all these other matters are settled.”

“Alright, I’ll follow you. In any case, this old master has always been a wanderer, so following you won’t make any difference,” Gui Zu grinned.

In Zi Long’s Space Ring, in addition to the Star Emperor Token and the golden key, there were many precious treasures from the Severed World, as well as his own personal collection.

The Space Ring of Purple Star’s Sect Master was simply a treasure trove!

Especially the Shattering Void Shuttle. Although it had some flaws, it was still an impressive transportation artifact.

After Yang Kai spent a few days refining it, he entered it together with Gui Zu, then set course for Tong Xuan Realm.

The reason why Yang Kai wanted to return to Tong Xuan Realm was also very simple. He wanted to arrange a Cross-Cultivation Star Space Array on his home star to connect it with Shadowed Star.

This way, if he ever wanted to return to his homeland in the future, it would be a simple task. All he would need to do is pass through a few Cross-Cultivation Star Space Arrays. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Only he could accomplish such a feat.

The Chaotic Abyss was not far from Tong Xuan Realm. When Yang Kai was a Saint, he had needed a year and a half to cross this distance, but using the Shattering Void Shuttle now, which was many times faster, after just two months he arrived above Tong Xuan Realm.

“This is your homeland?” Gui Zu frowned when he looked at Tong Xuan Realm. “The World Energy here is too thin, right? How could you have even cultivated in such a place?”

No matter how he thought about it, he couldn’t understand how a genius like Yang Kai could come from such a low-level Star.

He originally thought that Yang Kai’s homeland would be a cultivation paradise filled with natural beauty and rich World Energy.
