Lu Huai Shuang looked away as she didn’t have the heart to keep gazing at the sight. No matter how cruel he was when he killed, no matter how evil this young man was, he had just done her a great favour. If he hadn’t made a move earlier, she would’ve been injured, if not dead.

Meanwhile, Ma Chao Qun and He Wu Zui were ecstatic, and they almost couldn’t contain their urge to laugh. [The Heavenly Way is on our side! This man is being punished by the Heavens themselves!]

They traded glances and understood what was on each other’s mind without the need for a discussion. Moments later, the beams of lightning finally subsided, and the dark swirl in the sky disappeared.

The place fell into silence. The young man was still holding Ge Ming up with his hand. Nevertheless, both of them were seen with their hair standing on end, and their faces completely charred. There didn’t seem to be any aura lingering about them anymore.

No one knew the state the young man was in now, but it was apparent that the Fierce Gale Pirates’ Third Manager had left for the other world.

All of them saw how formidable the Heavenly Lightning was. It was the Heavenly Way’s method of exacting punishment. Even someone in the Third-Order Origin King Realm would’ve lost their life if they were punished in such a way, to say nothing of the fact that Ge Ming was only a First-Order Origin King. That was basically an unfortunate disaster for him. Although this young man was capable of ending Ge Ming’s life, he hadn’t really shown any intention of killing him. Instead, Ge Ming was killed by the beams of Heavenly Lightning.

Just then, two figures were seen charging forward. Like two beams of light, Ma Chao Qun and He Wu Zui came at the young man from both sides.

An enemy had to be killed with certainty to prevent future trouble. Certainly, they understood this simple principle. They had only appeared meek earlier because this strange young man showcased unfathomable power.

Now that he had been struck down by Heavenly Lightning though, they had to cut him down first whether or not he was dead. They had to make sure that this young man was truly dead so that they would stand a chance to survive. Otherwise, whether they lived or died would no longer be a decision for them to make.

Although Ma Chao Qun was fat, he was extremely agile. His bulky figure charged forward at incredible speed as the two golden orbs in his hands shone brightly. Before he even reached the young man, the golden orbs shot towards his opponent’s chest and head respectively in an overbearing manner.

On the other hand, He Wu Zui performed a hand seal and activated a frightening Secret Technique. A python appeared in mid-air all of a sudden as it opened its mouth wide in an attempt to bite the young man’s head off.

The series of actions was so rapid that Lu Huai Shuang hadn’t managed to react. With her heart jumping to her throat, she hurriedly slashed at He Wu Zui and Ma Chao Qun with her Sword Qi in an attempt to stop them from attacking the young man.

However, her action had come too late. She was doing all she could to save the young man, but it was probably useless.

*Chi, Chi, Chi…*

While the Sword Qi was slashing across the air, Ma Chao Qun and He Wu Zui suddenly stopped in their tracks, as though they had crashed into an invisible wall. At that moment, their hearts sank, and they were horrified as they stared fixedly at the sight in front of them.

What made them stop wasn’t Lu Huai Shuang’s Sword Qi, but rather the young man’s reaction. The strange young man, who had been struck by a shower of Heavenly Lightning just now, suddenly started moving again. He combed his messy hair back as his gaze turned from calm to furious, as though he was displeased with something.

It was this simple action that forced Ma Chao Qun and He Wu Zui to stop in their tracks as they had lost the courage to continue their attack.

Everyone seemed to have been restrained by an invisible hand, and time seemed to have stopped at that moment as well. All of them were rooted to the spot.

[He’s not dead? How did he survive inside that torrent of lightning?] Lu Huai Shuang couldn’t help but widen her eyes, an indescribable emotion flashing across their depths.

Meanwhile, Ma Chao Qun’s golden orbs were still shooting toward the young man at full speed and were just about to reach him.

Before the orbs could find their mark though, the young man lowered the hand he was using to comb his hair and waved it lightly.

Ma Chao Qun’s chest tightened, for he realized that he had lost the connection with his golden orbs. Upon a closer look, he felt his entire body trembling violently. In that instant, the two golden orbs had fallen into the young man’s hand. Swinging his fingers lightly, the golden orbs hovered around above his palm before they simply dropped into his grasp.

[How did he manage to snatch my Natal Artifact away so easily? What kind of Divine Ability was that? Who is he? What is he!?]

The python He Wu Zui had summoned reached the young man at that moment; however, he was so shocked that he couldn’t sustain it anymore, so it simply dissipated into a shower of light particles.

He Wu Zui gulped as his face started twitching uncontrollably.

“Uh…” Ma Chao Qun licked his dry lips as he tried to come up with an explanation, but he realized that he had lost all courage and couldn’t even speak properly.

“I didn’t kill him.” The young man finally tossed Ge Ming’s corpse away.

Ge Ming was killed by the Heavenly Lightning, so it was true in a sense that the young man didn’t murder him.

“Sir… I’m sure this is a misunderstanding,” Ma Chao Qun forced a smile, but he appeared more hideous than if he was crying.

“A misunderstanding? How so? Why don’t you explain it to me?” The young man stared indifferently at him.

Certainly, Ma Chao Qun couldn’t come up with an explanation. Normally, he would suppress others with his strength. If he fell out with someone, he would simply fight it out with them or escape if he couldn’t be victorious. Therefore, he had never been a smooth talker who could persuade other people. With sweat oozing from his forehead continuously, he had to keep wiping it away nervously. If he couldn’t come up with an explanation, he was doomed.

In the end, he opted to say nothing at all. Gritting his teeth, he turned around and ran for his life at full speed. Right now, he had no other option but to try to escape. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He and He Wu Zui only had themselves to blame for making a move on that young man. He also blamed himself for failing to realize how powerful his enemy was.

Seeing Ma Chao Qun flee, naturally, He Wu Zui didn’t dare to remain any longer. He immediately made up his mind and turned to run in a different direction. That was his instinctive reaction, as he hoped that the young man would chase after Ma Chao Qun, thus giving him time to escape. However, he was bound to be disappointed.

The young man didn’t even take a look at the fleeing pair, simply waving his hand once, sending one of the golden orbs flying out at a phenomenal speed.

“AH!!” A man screamed and fell to the ground with a loud thud.

He Wu Zui didn’t even dare to turn his head back as he put all his energy into fleeing, wishing he could grow two extra legs at this moment as he knew that the one who screamed just now was Ma Chao Qun.

All of a sudden, he felt a sharp pain on his back, and he collapsed onto the ground upon impact. He hurriedly got to his feet, but he was startled upon seeing the puddle of blood on the ground. Moreover, he felt as if he was missing something.

Lowering his head, he saw the last sight of his life. There was a large hole on his chest. Through the wound, he could see his organs squirming within his body. His vision turned dark, upon which he fell to the ground as his vitality rapidly left his body.

The atmosphere fell silent. On this unknown Dead Star, it was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop. Be it the hundreds of disciples from the Lu Family or the Star Pirates from the Fierce Gale Pirates, or the elite cultivators from the He Family, they were all shaken to the core as they stared at the unmoving young man, as though they were looking at a deity.

It couldn’t be helped, as from beginning to end, there weren’t any aura fluctuations from the young man, even when he threw out the golden orbs. In other words, he had accomplished what he did using pure physical strength. Ma Chao Qun and He Wu Zui had collapsed to the ground after a single hit each, without any chance to resist.

Both Ma Chao Qun and He Wu Zui were dead. Both of them were First-Order Origin Kings, but they were as helpless as three-year-old children in front of this young man. They couldn’t have imagined that this would be the outcome when they had plotted this venture today.

All the cultivators from these three groups were engulfed in feelings of fear, panic, and wariness. Having just witnessed this young man’s terrifying power, they knew that he could kill all of them with ease if he wanted to.

Lu Huai Shuang’s gaze appeared conflicted as she stared at the young man. Besides gratitude, there was also a sense of worry behind her eyes.

This young man had indeed saved her, but it was the first time she met him, so she wasn’t sure whether he was a righteous or wicked person. She was no longer an inexperienced little girl and she currently had hundreds of her family’s top cultivators depending on her, so she couldn’t make a decision based solely on her own preferences.

She wanted to find out the young man’s temperament, but she didn’t dare to ask him anything. While she was hesitating though, the young man turned to look at her with a faint smile on his face.

Lu Huai Shuang’s heart leapt to her throat as she felt that the smile on his face appeared ill-intentioned. Furthermore, his stare made her feel like she had been stripped bare and seen through, which was why she stiffened in an instant.

“If I were you, I would’ve come out voluntarily.”

Her expression changed when she heard that.

[What does he mean? I don’t think I’ve offended him in any way. When he was assaulted, I even offered to help him. Moreover, when the Heavenly Lightning descended, he pushed me away, so he doesn’t seem like a bad person, so why did his attitude change all of a sudden? Did I just walk out of a wolf’s lair only to enter a tiger’s den?]

Since the young man was so much more powerful than she was, she didn’t dare to disobey him. Her cultivation was essentially the same as Ma Chao Qun and He Wu Zui, but they were killed by this young man with ease. If he wanted to take her life, there was no way she could keep it.

Sighing to herself, she decided to accept her fate. However, before she could take a step forward, she suddenly felt some movement behind her. Shocked, she turned around to discover a figure whose aura suggested that he was in the Second-Order Origin King Realm standing there.

Lu Huai Shuang’s pupils contracted when she realized who he was. [Sheng Yao! The Head Manager of the Fierce Gale Pirates!]

Although it was the first time she came across this person, she could recognize him at first glance. Besides Sheng Yao, no other Master in the Second-Order Origin King Realm would appear in this place at this moment.

The Head Manager of the Fierce Gale Pirates had managed to escape unscathed after the great forces of the Star Field had joined to annihilate him in the past, but at this moment, he looked like an obedient servant as he was trotting over in an obsequious manner with a cautious smile on his face.

After moving past Lu Huai Shuang, he stopped in front of the young man and bowed his head deeply as he greeted clearly, “Greetings Senior, this humble one is called Sheng Yao. I am astonished by your incredible power and am willing to follow you and serve as your subordinate. Senior, please accept my obedience!”
