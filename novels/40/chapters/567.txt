Majestic Desert Splendor

From these words, it was obvious these five Great Evil Kings had enormous confidence in Yang Bai.

Yang Bai wore an indifferent expression and casually replied, “Then let’s see it.”

In truth he too was a bit interested in this barrier artifact that could block five Evil Kings.

Arriving outside Yang Kai’s mansion, Yang Bai stared at the transparent Heavenly Palace, probing it with his tyrannical Divine Sense over and over again, not showing any intention of attacking.

All six of the Great Evil Kings stood by quietly and watched, they weren’t in a hurry anyways.

After a while, Yang Bai simply shook his head, “I can’t handle this thing.”

“What?” The crowd behind him exclaimed in shock.

All of the Great Evil Kings had personally witnessed the awe inspiring power of Demon Lord Yang Bai and each of them had no doubt he was the most powerful master in this world, so hearing such an answer from his mouth was almost unthinkable to them. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Even their Lord couldn’t break this barrier?

“Interesting, this artifact is beyond the scope of this world. It’s not something people from our realm should be able to possess. Who does it belong to?” Yang Bai showed a faint smile on his face and asked.

“That man.” The Poison King hurriedly pointed towards Meng Wu Ya.

Yang Bai immediately cast his gaze towards Meng Wu Ya. The two men stared at each other across the distance, but what was strange was that the Demon Lord actually let out a sigh, his eyes filled with respect and yearning while on the other hand, Meng Wu Ya remained carefree and indifferent, as if he was standing above the clouds staring down at an ordinary mortal.

Yang Bai turned his head again and stared at Old Demon, a grin appearing on his face as he nodded gently, “Greetings!”

“Jie jie jie jie...” Old Demon cackled lightly.

No one knew what this brief dialogue meant; it was almost as if these two were somehow old acquaintances. Only Yang Kai somewhat understood.

If his guess was right, Demon Lord Yang Bai’s Demonic Secret Art had been acquired from the Devil Lord’s body, which had been trapped under the Coiling Dragon Stream.

During those long years he had been imprisoned in the Coiling Dragon Stream, Yang Bai was able to glean some profound insights from the old Devil Lord’s body which was also why his strength had made such rapid progress, allowing him to have his current awe inspiring power.

However, the old Demon Lord’s corpse had now been taken over by Old Demon’s Soul, who had then proceeded to absorb all the Demonic Qi within the Coiling Dragon Stream.

One of them had inherited the Devil Lord’s methods; the other had taken possession of his body. The source of their current strength was the same so naturally there would be some subtle connections between them.

Yang Bai turned his head once more, his expression becoming serious as he bowed slightly and quickly said, “Master!”

In response, Ling Tai Xu snorted, his expression quite bad, “I’m not your master.”

Yang Bai straightened himself up and replied faintly, “A master for a day is a master for life. Whether you are willing to acknowledge it or not, this Yang Bai has only ever had you as his master in this life.”

Everyone in Yang Kai’s house suddenly remembered that Ling Tai Xu and the Demon Lord were actually master and disciple.

Although being able to raise such a disciple was more than enough for one to take pride in, anyone could hear just how much remorse and anger Ling Tai Xu’s voice contained.

If that day he could have been ruthless enough to directly execute him instead of crippling his cultivation and imprisoning him in the Coiling Dragon Stream, countless innocent lives could have been spared a cruel and gruesome death.

“When I heard that Master’s heart knot had been solved, this Yang Bai was very happy.” The Demon Lord stared at Ling Tai Xu and said calmly.

“Such was the gift you gave me; fortunately, this old master was able to turn misfortune into blessing.” Ling Tai Xu replied coldly.

“Master taught this disciple for many years, so naturally disciple should also bestow some gifts to Master.” Yang Bai said, not showing the slightest regret or remorse for his past actions, causing everyone from High Heaven Pavilion to frown unhappily.

Ling Tai Xu just coldly snorted and glared back at his former disciple coldly.

In the past, he had great expectations for his Second Disciple and had even secretly thought that along with his First Disciple, the two could reach the peak of the Martial Dao and had thus cultivated them diligently, but today, he had nothing but extreme disappointment for this Second Disciple.

“You must be my young Martial Nephew, yes?” Yang Bai suddenly stared at Yang Kai, his eyes flashing brilliantly, “Come to think of it, this should be our first meeting.”

“Martial Uncle, I’ve heard much about you.” Yang Kai grinned at him.

Yang Bai nodded gently, “How is your father?”

Yang Kai sneered, his eyes as frigid as ice as he coldly replied, “Many thanks for Martial Uncle’s concern, my father is currently quite well.”

“Very good.” Yang Bai nodded and said no more.

Having greeted those he should greet, and having no way of breaking through this barrier, Yang Bai apparently felt there was no need to continue wasting time here.

“Qing Luo, you stay here and monitor them. Everyone else, come with me.” Yang Bai casually said, hurriedly bowing once more towards Ling Tai Xu before leading the other five Evil Kings away.

Only Shan Qing Luo remained behind, her expression slightly awkward.

She didn’t know if Yang Bai arranging for her to remain here to monitor this place had a deeper meaning or not.

Soon, all the cultivators and Monster Beasts from the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land gathered inside War City had assembled and under the leadership of Yang Bai and the five Great Evil Kings, charged towards the Central Capital, apparently wanting to press their advantage before the Eight Great Families could rally their defences.

After everyone had left, Shan Qing Luo glanced towards Yang Kai and began walking towards the Heavenly Palace’s barrier.

At some unknown point Bi Luo had also appeared and quickly followed behind Shan Qing Luo.

Yang Kai’s people, whether they were men or women, old or young, couldn’t help staring at this world famous Beguiling Demon Queen. Even if she wasn’t using her Seduction Technique, her fascinating charm was not something ordinary people could resist.

Many young men had dull expression, as if their souls had been sucked away while the women couldn’t help compare themselves to the peerless beauty before them, giving birth to subtle inferiority complexes.

Inside this mansion, only Su Yan’s stunning appearance could be placed on par with Shan Qing Luo’s.

Perhaps Xia Ning Chang could also stand even with them, but no one here had ever seen her true face. Even Yang Kai hadn’t, so naturally they had no way to compare them. But with regards to allure, no woman here could compare with Shan Qing Luo.

“This little vixen!” The Hu Sisters both spat disdainfully, the two of them both quite aggrieved. Although they hadn’t met this woman before, they immediately classified her as a country destroying disaster.

Her soft, supple, seemingly boneless waist that swayed and twisted like an enchanting snake stirred the hearts of everyone who saw her, mesmerising them, causing them to be unable to peel their eyes away from her perfect figure, her fiery red clothes seemingly igniting passion in the souls of everyone present.

Shan Qing Luo simply smiled though as she arrived outside the barrier and glanced elegantly towards Yang Kai.

“Treasurer Meng, let her in.” Yang Kai said.

Meng Wu Ya turned to stare at Yang Kai with amazement.

“I’m old friends with her, she won’t harm us.” Yang Kai explained.

In that instant, countless pairs of eyes fixed on Yang Kai, none of them able to believe that Yang Kai had such a close relationship with such a woman.

“Why you little brat...” Meng Wu Ya said with praises equivalent to his own life time as he spoke waving his hand and opening a small gap in the barrier.

Shan Qing Luo and Bi Luo didn’t hesitate at all and walked straight in, the barrier quickly closing behind them.

In front of everyone, Shan Qing Luo gracefully bowed, “Greeting Senior Ling.”

Ling Tai Xu raised his brow slightly and hurriedly said, “There’s no need to be polite. The Beguiling Demon Queen is a famous master herself. You and I are both Above Immortal Ascension Boundary cultivators, this Ling doesn’t dare claim seniority!”

He was quite wary of the Evil Kings who followed Yang Bai, so although Shan Qing Luo wasn’t showing any hostility, Ling Tai Xu was still quite alert towards her.

Shan Qing Luo however smiled warmly and shook her head, “Senior Ling is Yang Kai’s Grand Master, therefore he is also my Senior, Yang Kai and I... our relationship is... hehe...”

Shan Qing Luo didn’t finish her words, but the deep meaning contained within them was quite intriguing.

Everyone in the house, one by one, suddenly wore ambiguous expressions, as if they had just heard some unimaginable secret. Meanwhile, Huo Xing Chen and Dong Qing Han’s faces contorted to become more ridiculous than most.

“Don’t say such misleading words.” Yang Kai wrinkled his brow.

Shan Qing Luo couldn’t help pouting lightly, her luscious red lips puffing attractively.

Meanwhile, behind her, Bi Luo clenched her jaw and made threatening gestures towards Yang Kai.

“What exactly is all this about?” Yang Kai asked in a slightly raised voice.

“What’s all this about? It’s exactly as you saw.” Shan Qing Luo replied innocently.

“Why is the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land suddenly launching an all-out attack?”

This time’s events had happened too suddenly, catching everyone by surprise.

Shan Qing Luo let out a light sigh, “It’s you that created such a good opportunity for Sir Demon Lord, and you can’t push the blame onto others.”

“You mean the Inheritance War?”

“En, the development of this Inheritance War lead to the strength of the Eight Great Families being split in two, not to mention last time you encircled the Holy Land, your side’s losses weren’t small. Now, before you’ve had a chance to recover, of course Sir Demon Lord will try to seize this once in a lifetime opportunity.”

“Can you succeed?” Yang Kai sneered.

“I don’t know if we can succeed or not.” Shan Qing Luo shook her head, “But I know that with Sir Demon Lord’s currently cultivation, no one in your Eight Great Families can stop him.”

Yang Kai’s expression darkened slightly as he turned and asked, “Just how strong is he?”

“First under Heaven.” Meng Wu Ya replied flatly, his expression also quite dim.

“Also, your Eight Great Families aren’t a monolithic force and the Central Capital is far too big. The Eight Great Families each occupy one of the Central Capital’s eight corners. If the Holy Land’s forces launch a concentrated attack on one family, will the other seven rush to their aid without hesitation?” Shan Qing Luo glanced towards Yang Kai and grinned, her expression slightly mischievous.

Yang Kai coldly snorted in response, “The Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land isn’t exactly a solid piece of iron!”

Shan Qing Luo readily nodded, “True, the people of the Holy Land are indeed more selfish than your Eight Great Families. If it wasn’t for Sir Demon Lord coordinating them now, the Holy Land’s Six Great Evil Kings would likely be fighting amongst themselves, but with Sir Demon Lord things are different. Yang Kai, you shouldn’t think optimistically about this situation. Sir Demon Lord is utterly determined to destroy the Central Capital this time, he won’t care how many of the Holy Land’s cultivators need to die in order to accomplish this. Even the life or death of us Evil Kings is meaningless to him. If necessary, I don’t doubt he’ll sacrifice all of us without hesitation as long as you can defeat your Eight Great Families.”

“Are you all willing to be used like this by him?”

“Even if we’re not willing, we can’t resist!” Shan Qing Luo shook her head helplessly.

Yang Kai stared at her and hesitated for a moment before saying, “Stay here. In this place, Yang Bai can’t do anything to you.”

However, Shan Qing Luo just smiled bitterly, “If I stay here, I really would be safe, but what about the people in my palace, in Fragrance City?”

Yang Kai was startled, immediately remembering about the three women who had taken care of him when he had stayed in Shan Qing Luo’s palace. The mature beauty Yun Li and the two beautiful girls Ruo Yu and Ruo Qing.
