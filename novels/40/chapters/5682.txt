“Indeed, we old fogeys are still as sharp as ever, but those little brats still have much room to grow. We need to give them a chance to shine.” The Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master knew well that Ou Yang Lie was a stubborn mule and wouldn’t challenge him.

Ou Yang Lie remained silent for a long time, then finally spoke with a harsh tone, “When I return home someday, I’ll twist Big Head Mi’s head off and use it as a chamber pot!” He then thought of Yang Kai and added, “And that Yang Boy, he’s not a good thing either! He dared to trick me like this. I’ll give him a beating when I see him!”

“Good. Us fellow brothers will help you!” The Eighth-Order Master responded with a big smile, “With our combined strength, that brat won’t stand a chance.”

Ou Yang Lie looked at him and sighed heavily, his face full of sadness. It had come to this, and there was nothing he could do about it.

Soon, tens of thousands were dispersed by the Eighth-Order Masters to explore the area nearby for resources.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai had already used the Space Beacons to return to the Blue Sky Theatre, still feeling guilty. He could understand Ou Yang Lie’s mood, but this was Mi Jing Lun’s arrangement, so he could not intervene. Moreover, he hoped from the bottom of his heart that veterans like Ou Yang Lie could retire from the battlefield.

The number of Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters was now significant, and many rising stars were active on various battlefields. It was no longer a time when veteran warriors with countless scars had to bear the brunt of the harsh conditions.

The younger generation was now capable of taking on the heavy responsibilities of the Seniors!

However, as Mi Jing Lun worried, the problem that plagued Human development was still the resources. The emergence of a large number of High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters meant a massive demand for resources.

Sending some manpower to the Black Ink Battlefield to mine resources was one way to solve the problem, but exploration and extraction always took time, so Yang Kai planned to look for solutions elsewhere.

Resources were something that the Black Ink Clan did not lack. After his last experience at the No-Return Pass, Yang Kai was well aware of this fact as they didn’t even hesitate to hand over a massive amount of materials as compensation.

Since the Black Ink Clan didn’t lack resources, Yang Kai decided to just steal some.

Yang Kai decided to become a Hunter! Ever since he heard about the Hunters, he had been fascinated by their existence. If he was still a Sixth or Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he would have immediately become one and lived a carefree life raiding enemy convoys.

However, he was no longer the insignificant person he once was. His strength and status had both elevated him to a position where each of his words and actions had a significant impact on the overall situation. While Yang Kai still yearned to become a Hunter, he couldn’t risk the unpredictable consequences of such a move.

But, on this Black Ink Battlefield, he did not need to worry at all. When the Black Ink Clan and the Human Race signed their peace agreement years ago, it only applied to the 3,000 Worlds. It did not include the Black Ink Battlefield.

Hunting was also a time-intensive activity that often required patience and careful planning, but since Yang Kai had nothing else to do and was free from the need to cultivate, he could use this time to accumulate resources for the Human Race. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Months later, inside the Main Hall of the No-Return Pass, the Royal Lord sat on the throne of bones, with Mo Na Ye seated to his left. Territory Lords lined both sides of the hall, with their eyes fixed on the Royal Lord.

They were all confused, and even Mo Na Ye was puzzled as well.

Due to Yang Kai’s existence, the Black Ink Clan could not afford to let their guard down, even with a new Pseudo-Royal Lord on their side. Mo Na Ye could not leave the No-Return Pass at will, lest Yang Kai found an opportunity to destroy more Black Ink Nests here.

Since the Royal Lord could not protect everything on his own, they could only ensure the safety of the Black Ink Nest by joining forces.

That was why the Royal Lord had been staying here all these years, rarely making an appearance. Even when he did come out, he looked gloomy, obviously still upset about Yang Kai’s last visit.

But with Mo Na Ye as a capable assistant, the Royal Lord completely became an arm-flinging shopkeeper, leaving all major and minor matters of the Black Ink Clan war effort to be handled by him, so he was able to relax.

However, at this moment, the Royal Lord’s expression looked… exceptionally joyful. It was unclear if something had happened on the Great Territory Battlefields, or if there had been some breakthrough development in the Black Ink Clan.

Then, as they recalled the tone in which the Royal Lord summoned them to this conference hall earlier, the Black Ink Clan elites secretly anticipated good news.

The Royal Lord remained silent, and the Territory Lords dared not speak without permission either. Instead, it was Mo Na Ye, a Pseudo-Royal Lord, who smiled and asked, “Sir Royal Lord, is there good news you have to share with us today?”

The Royal Lord chuckled and looked approvingly at Mo Na Ye. Although he had many loyal followers, only Mo Na Ye was quick-minded and able to read his intentions. This was also why he was willing to delegate power to Mo Na Ye. There was no possibility of a power struggle in the Black Ink Clan, as Mo Na Ye’s Pseudo-Royal Lord status meant that he could never surpass the real Royal Lord’s authority, so there was no concern over infighting even if so much power was given to Mo Na Ye.

After nodding in approval at him, the Royal Lord announced the great news, “There is news from the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction!”

With that announcement, the room erupted in surprise.

The Territory Lords widened their eyes in excitement, while Mo Na Ye jumped up from his seat, exclaiming, “Sir, has the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction been broken?”

Since the battle outside the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction and its subsequent sealing and Mo’s slumber, the Black Ink Clan had been unable to contact them. However, now the Royal Lord claimed that there was news from the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, indicating that the Supreme One had awakened and the Grand Restriction had been broken.

If this was true, the day when the Black Ink Clan would rule all under the Heavens would soon arrive! Even Mo Na Ye, who was usually calm and composed, was overcome with excitement and could not help but shed tears.

But the Royal Lord waved his hand and said, “It’s not what you think. The Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction is still there, and the Supreme One is still asleep.”

The excited Territory Lords were suddenly silenced like a bucket of cold water had been thrown on them.

Then, Mo Na Ye asked, “If that’s the case, how did news come from the other side?”

“I’m also unsure, and due to the interference of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, the message is not very clear. All I know is that the Humans still have some control over that place and that someone deliberately opened a gap, like before,” the Royal Lord replied.

“Someone is controlling the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction?”

“But it can’t be Cang, can it? How can anyone control the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction?”

“Who is this person?”

The Territory Lords were clamouring and asking questions. They were all Innate Territory Lords who came from inside the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, so they knew about the situation there very well. They knew that Cang was the last Human Race Master who could control the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, and after his death, no one should be able to do so.

But now, the Royal Lord was saying that someone was in control of that place. If this message did not come from the Black Ink Clan inside the Grand Restriction, they would never have believed it.

While the Territory Lords were concerned about who was controlling the restriction, Mo Na Ye picked up on a different piece of information and asked, “Sir, when was the gap opened?”

The Royal Lord answered, “It should have been some 100 years ago.”

Mo Na Ye murmured with a frown, “Around 100 years ago… Sir, back then, Yang Kai led several hundred Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters of the Human Race through the No-Return Pass and into the Black Ink Battlefield. Considering the timeline… could it be that the person who controls the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction now is Yang Kai?”

This was not a wild guess, as Yang Kai often accomplished things that others couldn’t. If he was really the one controlling the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, Mo Na Ye wouldn’t be surprised.

The Royal Lord, however, shook his head and said, “It’s not him. Although the information from the Grand Restriction is not complete, I’ve inquired carefully. The person who controls the Grand Restriction now does not resemble Yang Kai at all. It must be someone we don’t know about.”

Mo Na Ye didn’t doubt him and only sighed, “The Human Race still has such a heritage!”

After Cang’s death, it was assumed that there would be no one who could control the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction again. This was good news for the Black Ink Clan, as they could easily break it once the Supreme One awakened.

However, it was different if someone was guarding it. Even the Supreme One couldn’t underestimate the power of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, or else it wouldn’t have been trapped for so many aeons already.

Mo Na Ye continued to ask, “But if the Human Race has someone who can control the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, why did they take the initiative to open a gap?”

The Royal Lord replied, “Those inside the Grand Restriction can sense that the Human controlling it now is much weaker than Cang, so their control over the Grand Restriction is far inferior. This person must have opened the gap to alleviate the pressure he was facing. This is clearly something the Human Race had planned to do long ago. When Yang Kai passed through the No-Return Pass with those hundreds of Eighth-Order Masters, it was to go to the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. Now, there is an elite Human Race Army and a Divine Dragon, Fu Guang, fighting against those who are rushing out. This has been happening for over 100 years.”

Mo Na Ye suddenly realised, “Curse those Humans!”

When the Territory Lords below heard that their clansmen were being constantly killed at the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, they immediately started clamouring again.

A Territory Lord even stepped forward and bowed, saying, “Sir Royal Lord, please let me lead a large army to the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction to coordinate with those inside and crush those Humans.”

Mo Na Ye immediately stopped him, “That would not be appropriate!”

Although the Territory Lord was intimidated by Mo Na Ye’s Pseudo-Royal Lord authority, he couldn’t help but ask, “Why is it not appropriate?”

Mo Na Ye explained, “When Yang Kai passed through the No-Return Pass, he had as many as 400 Eighth-Order Open Heaven with him, and that’s just what we could see on the surface. Although there were suspicions at the time, we couldn’t be sure. Now that we have first-hand information, we can confirm that those 400 we saw that day were not the entire Human force. Many more must have been staying in their Small Universes, which is why they were able to form a large army at the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction!”
