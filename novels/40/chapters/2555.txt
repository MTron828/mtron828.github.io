“My Netherworld Sect… Will not spare you!”

A murmur-like voice came from nearby. Yang Kai turned his head and looked towards the source. He noticed Hua Fei Chen, who was hanging by a breath, lying on the ground, staring in his direction with wide-open eyes that were grey and devoid of any lustre, like those of a fish that had been dead for many days.

After having said his piece, his head slumped to one side as his vitality completely disappeared.

It was already a pretty impressive feat that he had remained alive till now after having been struck by the Time Flies Seal.

Naturally, Yang Kai didn’t attach importance to a threat from the dead, simply reaching out and taking Yin Le Sheng’s ring before throwing it into his pocket.

He was the top disciple of the Netherworld Sect, so he definitely had many treasures on him. How could Yang Kai miss such a prize?

Before he could turn and deal with Hua Fei Chen, Yang Kai’s expression drastically changed and he hurriedly threw away the Emperor Authority Bead in Yin Le Sheng’s hand.

*Peng…*

With a deafening clap, the Emperor Authority Bead suddenly exploded, reducing into dust before scattering in the air.

Yang Kai’s expression rapidly changed as his good mood suddenly turned bad, gritting his teeth as he murmured, “So, there was a restriction!”

He had no idea what restriction was placed on the Emperor Authority Bead, but it must have been related to Yin Le Sheng’s life; after all, it was a treasure bestowed to Yin Le Sheng by the Netherworld Sect’s Sect Master. Such a restriction must have been set to trigger upon Yin Le Sheng’s death, rendering the Emperor Authority Bead useless.

Yang Kai was saddened, but now that it had already happened, it was pointless to brood over it; all he could do was collect himself then walk over to Hua Fei Chen and take his Space Ring as well.

As for the out-of-control Ghost King, Yang Kai was totally unconcerned about it. Countless Soul Devouring Insects were gnawing on it, treating it as a delicious meal, so presumably, it would not be long before it would be completely devoured.

With over twenty fresh corpses lying around, there was a pungent bloody smell lingering in the air.

Yang Kai was injured as well. The wound caused by Ghost King’s slash hadn’t healed even now and pitch-black energy was lingering around the edge of the wound, continuously corroding his flesh and skin.

Yang Kai stretched his hand out and made a gesture, immediately drawing a small swarm of Soul Devouring Insects towards him and directing them to his wound.

Since the Soul Devouring Insects could devour a being like the Ghost King, it shouldn’t be a problem for them to deal with its Yin Qi. Yang Kai had summoned them to deal with his injury, and as he expected, just as the Soul Devouring Insects landed on his wound, they started devouring the lingering energy.

In just a few moments, that pitch-black energy was devoured clean and without the corrosion and interference of the Yin Qi, the strong restorative properties of Yang Kai’s Golden Blood came into play. His flesh and skin started squirming, and Yang Kai estimated that his wound would fully heal in just a few days.

Only now did Yang Kai finally turn his head, looking at the red-robed girl.

As soon as their eyes met, Lin’er couldn’t help but nervously gulp. She might have put up a brave front, but she was still scared to death in her heart. She had never seen someone as fierce as Yang Kai, who could kill all his opponents even when he was so heavily outnumbered. Furthermore, he didn’t murder ordinary people, but two Emperor Realm Masters from the Netherworld Sect plus a group of Dao Source Realm Masters who had laid out the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array.

The huge wound on Yang Kai’s chest gave him an even more ferocious appearance.

Seeing Yang Kai looking in her direction, it would be a lie if she said that she wasn’t in a panic. Lin’er was currently regretting a little. Had she known, she would have escaped with Old Fu earlier. What could she even do by putting up a brave front and remaining here?

It never crossed her mind that with Yang Kai’s skill, she wouldn’t have been able to escape even if she wanted to. Unless she and Old Fu escaped back to the Ancient Lands Passageway where they could throw Yang Kai off with the help of the strange fog.

*Sha Sha Sha…*

Yang Kai walked towards her, step by step, his eyes completely cold, putting a lot of pressure onto Lin’er.

Old Fu earnestly tried to protect Lin’er, his figure flickering and standing before her, a wary look on his face.

“You are pretty obedient!” Yang Kai stood just ten metres away from them and coldly stated, pointing his sword at them, “For your honesty and compliance, this Young Master will give you a quick and painless death. Tell me, how do you want to die?”

Old Fu grew anxious upon hearing this. Was he serious? There were only a few people in this world who would dare to point their swords at his Young Lady and ask how she wanted to die, and judging by the murderous look on this young man’s face, he really was not planning to let the two of them go.

This was only natural, however, as his Young Lady had used an Emperor Artifact to bind him in a life and death fight, almost causing him to die at the hands of the Netherworld Sect’s people. Anyone would be enraged if they were in his place.

But how could he let his Young Lady die? If she died, the entire world would be thrown into chaos.

Old Fu quickly intervened, “Young Master, enmity should be resolved rather than settled. We were in the wrong today, please show mercy on us this time. In any case, nothing happened today, yes?”

“Nothing happened!?” Yang Kai, who was burning with fury, looked sidelong at him as he snorted as he rebuked, “Do you think this Young Master is faking his injuries? How can you say nothing happened?”

His wound had still not healed and his bones could be seen quite clearly. How could it be treated as nothing?

Old Fu’s face sank as he justified, “This Old Master is also doing this for your own good. If you refuse to realize your errors, you will be facing a huge disaster.”

Yang Kai laughed in anger and stated, “This Young Master knows that you have strong backing and there is someone big behind you, but so what? Since you have fallen in this Young Master’s hand, your life or death is for me to decide. Losers should act like losers, yet you still dare to shamelessly boast like this! Do you really believe I won’t run you through with my sword!”

While speaking, Yang Kai thrust his sword, resting it straight on Old Fu’s chest and with a flick of his wrist, he tore Old Fu’s shirt apart, scaring him to the point that he hurriedly backed away. His bold front instantly vanished in a puff of smoke and his puffed up chest shrivelled like a wilted eggplant.

He was utterly afraid that Yang Kai would stab him in a rage. If his Young Lady died, this young man would suffer a deadly crisis, but if he was killed, no one would stand up for him.

In the end, he was just a guard, responsible for protecting his Young Lady. But how was he supposed to protect her if he couldn’t even protect himself now?

They had really run into a true madman!

Old Fu was filled with hatred, but he knew very well how strong Yang Kai was now. Had he known that the Netherworld Sect disciples were such wastes, why would he have gone to look for them and actively cooperate with them, provoking Yang Kai with his Young Lady time and time again?

But then again, how could he have known that a mere First-Order Emperor Realm Master could be so overwhelmingly powerful?

“Th-then what do you want?” Old Fu softened his stance and weakly asked.

At present, he was the fish on the chopping block, facing Yang Kai’s blade. He had no choice but to lower his head, throw his pride and humiliation aside, and look for a way to survive this. Ten years wasn’t too late for a gentleman to take his revenge.

Yang Kai’s face sank as he stated, “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. This Young Master can let things go once or twice, but certainly not thrice. Your Young Lady obstinately insists on her foolish actions and will cause a catastrophe sooner or later. Why doesn’t this Young Master clean up your Sect on behalf of the Sir behind you and save him from future worries?”

Old Fu was greatly shocked, feeling like he was trying to make a clever speech to a cow. Yang Kai’s murderous intent hadn’t been reduced at all and he seemed dead set on his Young Lady. What was he supposed to do?

He didn’t dare to hesitate anymore and hurriedly added, “Do you know who we are? Who my Young Lady is? She is…”

“Shut up!” Yang Kai kicked him before he could finish.

Old Fu was caught unprepared and helplessly watched himself get kicked right in the face, letting out a miserable scream as he was sent flying. His nose was broken from this kick and he crashed to the ground, not getting up no matter how much time passed.

After kicking away Old Fu, Yang Kai finally turned his gaze at the red-robed girl and quickly said, “Girl, this Young Master let you go back in that desolate city, and instead of feeling grateful and seeking ways to repay me, you actually joined forces with the Netherworld Sect to try to attack this Young Master. Today, this Young Master will take your life to let you know that there are some people in this world you cannot provoke!”

Lin’er was greatly shocked and her pretty face turned pale as she cried, “How dare you!?”

She had not even finished her words though when Yang Kai lifted his sword and swung it at her.

In a flash, Lin’er pretty face went as pale as paper as the aura of death enveloped her. She broke into a cold sweat and her hands and feet froze up.

She had never experienced something like this. She had been completely spoiled since birth, with everyone at her beck and call. Wherever she went, no one would dare disobey her every command, much less dare to kill her.

But now, she had encountered someone who wanted to take her life, and he wasn’t just trying to intimidate her, he meant what he said and was actually trying to do it.

She was just a Third-Order Dao Source Realm, who was exhausted from using her Emperor Artifact. Now, she couldn’t even smoothly walk, much less defend herself from a blow like this.

[So, this is what death feels like!]

[He really intends to kill me!?] Lin’er stood in a daze, as if a petrification spell had been cast on her.

Emperor Qi surged as the Myriads Sword horizontally slashed at her. Yang Kai hadn’t held himself back at all. Even Old Fu would be cut into two by this slash, not to mention a tender girl like Lin’er. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

But just when the Myriads Sword was about to cut her, a black pendant on Lin’er neck suddenly cracked and turned into a black barrier, covering her completely.

*Hong…*

A crisp and reverberating clang immediately rang out. The Myriads Sword struck the barrier, but it couldn’t damage it even a bit. Instead, Yang Kai retreated a few steps from the recoil.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, but he didn’t look surprised at all. It appeared as if he had expected this and just stared at the black barrier while letting out a cold snort.

After protecting Lin’er, the black barrier turned into a streak of black light as it shot out and sank into Old Fu, who was still lying on the ground.

*Weng…*

The surrounding world suddenly trembled as an unimaginable pressure spread into the surroundings, a pressure which clearly originated from Old Fu.

*Hualala…*

The birds and beasts within a hundred kilometres fled, as if they had sensed the approaching danger.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but nervously gulp as he raised his vigilance.

He couldn’t be any more familiar with the phenomena before him. This was clearly a powerful Master’s Soul Descent.

Feng Xi had also resorted to this technique back in the Shattered Star Sea, so the experience was still fresh in Yang Kai’s memories.

The elites of top Sects seemed to have many tricks up their sleeves, with Emperor Authority Beads being the most common. The Soul Descent was undoubtedly an even stronger form of protection as a wisp of a true Master was able to manifest itself through it. Although this Master was unable to bring out their full strength in a borrowed body, it still wasn’t something an ordinary person could deal with.

The manifestation of a Master’s Soul not only put tremendous pressure on the opposite party, but also deterred the enemy with prestige and reputation.

There were only so many top Masters in the world, but once one of their Souls appeared, who would dare to disregard them?

Since even Feng Xi had a Soul Descent of his father placed on him in the Shattered Star Sea, of course this Young Lady Lin’er could have a similar technique protecting her.

Yang Kai had already expected this, so he didn’t expect to be able to really kill Lin’er at all. Still, being unable to vent his anger vexed him greatly.
