Back in the Starlight Corridor, Yang Kai had used his Space Force to destabilize the passage, resulting in him being separated from Xiao Xiao and Liu Yan. Since then, Yang Kai had been quite worried about their safety, but unfortunately, he had no way to find them.

Xiao Xiao looked like a living puppet at first glance, which would be enough to draw people’s interest, and if he were to expose his strength in front of people, he would definitely be targeted.

However, Xiao Xiao’s escape methods were extremely profound. Belonging to the Stone Puppet Race, Xiao Xiao’s ability to bury through the earth made him almost impossible to catch.

Liu Yan was different. She didn’t have profound escape methods like Xiao Xiao but her existence carried the same level of attraction to all cultivators. If she could be caught and integrated into an artifact, it would be equivalent to obtaining an artifact which had formed a real Artifact Spirit, raising its power significantly!

Not only that, some cultivators who were proficient in Fire Attribute Secret Arts would even be able to directly refine Liu Yan to strengthen themselves.

Even if she had no use whatsoever to a person, they could still sell her for a high price!

As such, Liu Yan’s situation was actually much more dangerous than Xiao Xiao’s.

So, at this moment, after Yang Kai heard the information provided by the middle-aged man, he couldn’t help feeling anxious. If the Firebird that appeared in Clear Jade Mountain was really Liu Yan, then her current situation was dire.

With so many cultivators rushing over, Liu Yan would not be able to protect herself and would sooner or later be caught.

Understanding this, Yang Kai also quickly displayed his Movement Skills to chase after the crowd.

A distance of thirty thousand kilometres was nothing to a cultivator at the Origin King Real, so after just half a stick of incense, Yang Kai reached the outskirts of Clear Jade Mountain.

There were already many cultivators gathered here, roughly two hundred people in total.

But what made Yang Kai feel a little at ease was that the cultivations of these people were not high, most just Origin Returning or Origin King Realm. Dao Source masters were extremely rare.

It seemed that the overall level of cultivation in this Maplewood City was not very strong, or at least Yang Kai speculated so.

The cultivators gathered here did not even seem to be in a rush to enter the mountain to search and instead were busy trying to form alliances with one another, probably wanting to take advantage of superior numbers to ensure safety and success.

Some people looked battered and bruised. Burns were also especially common. There were even a few dead bodies on the ground, which looked terribly scorched.

“That Firebird is really ferocious, although from its aura fluctuations it doesn’t seem to be any stronger than a Third-Order Origin King, its flames are extremely difficult to resist. Brother Zhao and Brother Zhang were both veteran Origin Kings, but all it took was a single attack for them to be burned to death. Fortunately, we ran quickly, otherwise...”

The speaker was sitting next to the corpses, dealing with his own injuries while explaining to others as a look of lingering fear covered his face.

Many people had gathered around him to gather information as well as to inspect his injuries to infer just how strong the Firebird was.

It was precisely because of the experiences and explanations of various groups that the Origin Kings present who weren’t too strong gave up the idea of trying to capture the Firebird alone and instead tried to form groups.

Yang Kai naturally heard these words, and he couldn’t help feeling excited in his heart.

Third-Order Origin King Realm power and terrifying flames, the characteristics really matched Liu Yan! If Yang Kai had previously been wondering whether the Firebird in Clear Jade Mountain was really Liu Yan or not, now he was almost eighty percent certain.

Liu Yan had an aura on par with an ordinary Third-Order Origin King, but because she had swallowed and refined many exotic flames as well as a large amount of Sun’s True Fire, her flames were extremely terrifying, to the point that even Yang Kai did not dare touch them easily.

“Several friends, if that’s the case, did all of you actually see what that Firebird looked like?” Yang Kai pushed aside the crowd and stepped forward to ask.

“Naturally we saw it,” The speaker raised his head and glanced at Yang Kai with a wry smile, “Otherwise, how could we have wound up in such a miserable state?”

“Then dare I ask what exactly does that Firebird look like?”

“It’s a bit difficult to describe actually. It did have a long tail but wasn’t very big itself, maybe ten metres across.”

Yang Kai was stunned when he heard this. If Liu Yan was using her innate appearance, she should be far larger than that.

“Then was that Firebird able to change its form?” Yang Kai continued to ask.

The man suddenly laughed, “What, were you hoping it could transform into a cold-faced red-haired beauty in a high exposure dress?”

The crowd laughed suddenly as they looked at Yang Kai with various levels of amusement and disdain, wondering if his head was empty or just damaged.

“Many thanks,” Yang Kai chuckled wryly before withdrawing from the crowd.

Although he was not able to obtain much information, it was still somewhat rewarding.

Whether the Firebird in Clear Jade Mountain was Liu Yan or not, he would only be able to tell after entering. First though, he silently stimulated a certain Soul Imprint in his Knowledge Sea.

There was a Soul connection between him and Liu Yan which he had planted when he first subdued her, so as long as they weren’t separated by too great a distance, they would be able to perceive each other.

But to his disappointment, he did not feel Liu Yan’s response.

It seemed that entering and searching was his only option.

Just when he made up his mind to enter Clear Jade Mountain, suddenly a person approached him quietly from behind. Yang Kai frowned, looked back, and saw a petite girl with a rather full figure looking at him with a smile.

This girl should be a great beauty, but on her cheek, there was a rather large brown crescent-shaped birthmark. This ugly birthmark greatly harmed her countenance, causing all the men who saw her to let out a sigh of disappointment.

She was wearing a green dress that while loose, could not disguise her proud peaks while around her thin waist, there were a number of cloth pouches that all seemed to be filled with something.

With a pleasant expression on her face, and a completely innocent and harmless smile, she called out to Yang Kai timidly, “Uncle, could I have a moment of your time?”

Yang Kai’s face instantly turned black as he said in a gloomy tone, “Who is your uncle? Do I look that old?”

Although Yang Kai’s age was indeed not young from a mortal’s point of view, for a cultivator, he was still quite young, and simply judging from his outward appearance, he looked like he was in his early twenties.

Suddenly being called uncle by a young girl naturally caused Yang Kai’s mood to sink.

Seemingly a bit frightened by Yang Kai’s fierce expression, the young girl couldn’t help falling back a few steps with an aggrieved expression on her face.

Yang Kai swept his eyes over this girl, pausing ever so briefly on her rich peaks, before he muttered in surprise, “Third-Order Origin King?”

He was stunned to discover that this girl, who seemed to be only fifteen or sixteen years old, actually had a cultivation on par with his own.

However, Yang Kai was not sure how old this person really was. This ‘girl’ might actually be an old grandma who had lived thousands of years. Yang Kai was definitely not naive enough to believe that the frightened and aggrieved expression on her face was genuine.

Acting out like this was commonplace for these old witches, so no matter how realistic the performance, Yang Kai would not be fooled. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

However, at that moment, Yang Kai could not help thinking of a certain individual.

Lin Yun’er!

When he was back in High Heaven Sect, this little girl would always call him uncle in a delighted tone, making Yang Kai inexplicably feel a lot older.

He didn’t know where that silly little girl was now, only that at that time Yang Yan had left behind everyone and everything, including Ye Xi Yun, but had actually taken Lin Yun’er with her. Apparently, it was all because of Lin Yun’er’s Tyrant Strength Body Special Constitution.

The expression on Yang Kai’s face gradually became softer and the girl patted her chest in relief before boldly saying, “Then this big brother, could you spare me a moment to chat?”

[A great actor indeed!] Yang Kai sneered repeatedly in his heart as he wore a calm look on his face and said, “What do you want to talk about?”

The ‘young girl’ glanced left and right cautiously before her red lips wriggled, sending a message to Yang Kai’s ear.

Yang Kai frowned and quickly asked, “Are you lying to me?”

“I have no grievances with you, why would I lie to you?” The girl looked wronged.

“Lead the way then,” Yang Kai gestured.

The girl smiled immediately and walked off.

She didn’t show the slightest caution or vigilance towards Yang Kai, making him wonder if she was just acting or was that confident in her strength.

Yang Kai was more inclined to believe the latter.

After a short walk, they left the crowd. In a relatively remote location, two other people seemed to be waiting, and when the girl came back, these two wore happy smiles.

Yang Kai observed the situation carefully and quietly released his Divine Sense to scan these two, quickly discovering that they were both Third-Order Origin Kings as well. The two were a man and a woman. The man looked stalwart and had a kind smile on his face that seemed as refreshing as a spring breeze while the woman was quite pretty and had an enchanting figure, a pair of watery eyes that seemed to contain an endless attraction as well as faintly pouting lips that looks sweet and delicate to the touch.

A man with weak will who looked at this woman would probably quickly lose himself to her charms.

Even Yang Kai showed a slightly dull expression before quickly regaining his composure.

His performance was naturally seen by this woman who couldn’t help smiling ever so slightly, as if very satisfied with her own charms.

“Little Sister Xiao Qi, did you manage to find someone?” The woman asked with a smile.

The girl nodded when she heard these words and said happily, “This big brother should be okay; he’s also very interested in our plan.”

As she spoke, she pointed at Yang Kai.

The man smiled at Yang Kai and nodded, cupping his fists and saying, “This one’s name is Xu Qing, dare I ask how this friend is called.”

“Yang Kai!” Very few people in the Star Boundary knew him anyway, so Yang Kai felt no need to make up a fake name.

“Yu Ruo Mei greets Brother Yang,” The woman elegantly bowed to the side.

Yang Kai quickly returned the greeting.

“My name is Mo Xiao Qi,” The girl who led Yang Kai also introduced herself.

Yang Kai nodded and said, “Sister Xiao Qi, just now, when you said you knew where the Firebird was. Is that true?”
