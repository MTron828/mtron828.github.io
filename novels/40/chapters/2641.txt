In just a brief moment of confrontation, an Emperor Realm Elder of Seeking Passion Sect had his head smashed to pieces and died on the spot. All the nearby cultivators gasped in disbelief at the brutal scene.

That was an Emperor Realm Master, how could he be killed in just one hit? Could this Xiao Bai Yi possibly be that powerful? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Following his successful attack, Yang Kai once again released a Moon Blade towards the other First-Order Emperor Realm Master while at the same time grabbing towards Nanmen Da Jun.

“Little animal, it’s you!”

Instead of fear and panic though, the remaining First-Order Emperor’s eyes flashed brightly at the death of his companion, as if he had discovered an incredible secret. Grabbing towards Yang Kai with his hand, this Master’s cultivation suddenly soared upwards.

“A Third-Order Emperor Realm Master?” Yang Kai’s eyes widened, and immediately exclaimed when he noticed this person’s aura, “Feng Xuan! So you were hiding here!”

He had received news before that Feng Xuan was in Ice Moon City, but now, he realized that Feng Xuan was not in the rear taking command, but had actually been waiting by Nanmen Da Jun’s side while camouflaging his own appearance and hiding his cultivation, disguising as an ordinary First-Order Emperor Realm Master.

Since he was the Sect Master of the Seeking Passion Sect, it wasn’t surprising he had a Secret Technique capable of at least this much.

The reason for his actions was to have safety measures against Bing Yun; however, contrary to Feng Xuan’s expectations, the one who appeared before him was actually Yang Kai.

A few years ago, Feng Xi fought against Yang Kai in the Shattered Star Sea, the battle ultimately ending with Feng Xi’s defeat and his death. At the end of that battle, Feng Xuan used a Soul Descend to possess his son’s body, but even after fighting a battle with Yang Kai, Feng Xuan failed to save his son.

When the Moon Blade appeared, Feng Xuan instantly recognized Yang Kai’s true identity.

“It’s too late to realize it now! This King already knows who you are! I didn’t expect you to fall into this trap by yourself. My target just served himself on a platter for me, I don’t even need to put in any effort to search for you. Now die!” Feng Xuan sneered as he pushed his Emperor Qi and Principle Strength madly, condensing them into a thick chain that shot towards Yang Kai in an attempt to bind him.

Yang Kai’s face changed drastically and was forced to withdraw the hand grasping towards Nanmen Da Jun in order to rapidly form a series of hand seals as he shouted, “Time Flows on Infinitely, Like a Mighty Stream, Like an Unending Dream!”

A seal shrouded Feng Xuan from above.

“Time Flies Seal!” Feng Xuan was horrified when he felt the great power contained in this Divine Ability. Even a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master like him could not help feeling frightened as an odd sensation overwhelmed him.

Time itself seemed to slow to a crawl as he watched this seal form.

“Time Principles!” Feng Xuan’s face darkened.

Yang Kai used the Time Flies Seal in the Shattered Star Sea back then as well, and it was thanks to this Divine Ability that Feng Xuan’s son had perished. Because of this, Feng Xuan had spent some time over the past few years investigating the mysteries of this Divine Ability.

And his hard work had paid off because he finally had a good understanding of this Divine Ability.

This Time Flies Seal was the unique Divine Ability of the Flowing Time Great Emperor. A single seal not only made time flow rapidly, but also involved Time Principles. It was definitely a powerful Secret Technique that all Emperor Realm Masters would be envious of.

Now, Yang Kai was using the Time Flies Seal again, which he undoubtedly had become more proficient with than a few years ago.

Feng Xuan, who was shrouded by the distorted Time Principles, became sluggish for a moment.

Right at that moment, Yang Kai flashed by him and sprang towards Nanmen Da Jun like a tiger hunting its prey.

Nanmen Da Jun retreated quickly in horror, pushing his Emperor Qi at the same time to protect himself.

But just like Yang Kai, he was only a First-Order Emperor, so how could he resist? He did not even have time to summon any Emperor Artifacts before Yang Kai grabbed his neck. In the next moment, a fierce wave of force invaded Nanmen Da Jun’s body, flooding his meridians and physique. Nanmen Da Jun suddenly gave a cough, his face white as a sheet as cold sweat beaded on his forehead.

“Don’t force me to kill you! It’s not easy to be an accomplished Array Master, it would be a shame for you to die here!” Yang Kai declared coldly when he saw Nanmen Da Jun still trying to struggle.

Nanmen Da Jun sighed dejectedly and dispersed his Emperor Qi, allowing Yang Kai to lift him up.

At that moment, there was a soft cracking sound.

Yang Kai looked back and saw that Feng Xuan, who was under the influence of the Time Flies Seal, had broken free.

“I expected nothing less from Sect Master Feng!” Yang Kai complimented.

Although the Time Flies Seal was exceptional, Yang Kai’s cultivation was still far from Feng Xuan’s, so it was something of a fluke to even be able to trap him for a moment.

*Xiu xiu xiu…*

A group of silhouettes rose into the sky from all directions, and waves of Emperor Qi surged towards this direction violently. Naturally, these auras belonged to the Emperor Realm Masters from the Seeking Passion Sect and those who had accepted the Recruitment Order. They must have sensed something wrong and rushed to help.

At a glance, there seemed to be at least thirty Emperor Realm Masters approaching, an extremely terrifying force.

Although it was not as good as the thirty-two Monster Kings and eight Great Kings from the Ancient Wild Lands, it was still dreadfully shocking that a single Sect could gather so many Emperor Realm Masters.

“Yao’er, I’ve got him, withdraw!” Yang Kai shouted sharply, calling out to Ji Yao who was fighting against the Second-Order Emperor Realm Master guard.

Yang Kai did not want to be entangled here a moment longer. Since he had already achieved his goal, which was to capture Nanmen Da Jun, the wisest course of action was to leave now.

Ji Yao nodded and used her Pear Flower Ice Snow Sword Technique. Pear blossoms bloomed and swirled around her opponent, locking him in place for a moment as she took the opportunity to escape and fly towards Yang Kai.

“Trying to escape? Since you’ve come, this King insists you stay!” Feng Xuan was boiling in anger, like an erupting volcano. Pushing his Seeking Passion Supreme Art to its limit, he released a mystical domain that covered the entire surrounding region.

In this domain, everyone’s emotions and desires seemed to be infinitely magnified, shaking their minds and making it difficult for them to control themselves.

This was the horror of the Seeking Passion Supreme Art. Once it was deployed, it could arouse the emotions and desires hidden in the heart of the enemy, playing an important role of restraint in a battle of life and death; after all, even a small mistake in such a battle could result in death.

Activating his Secret Art, Feng Xuan stretched a hand out and summoned a spear that seemed to pulse with Blood Qi. Whistling wind and booming thunder was heard as Feng Xuan poured his Emperor Qi into the spear.

“Go!” Feng Xuan growled in a low voice as he threw the spear in his hand towards Yang Kai ferociously.

*Kacha… *

The spear turned into a violet bolt of lightning, soaring like a dragon through the Heavens, radiating an astonishing destructive power.

“The inheritance of the Seeking Passion Great Emperor, Wind and Thunder Divine Spear!”

Many Emperor Realm Masters were shocked, and many knowledgeable cultivators recognized the origin of this spear.

It was known that the Seeking Passion Sect was founded by a Great Emperor, and the Seeking Passion Supreme Art was also the cultivation technique created by the same Great Emperor at the time. It was this supreme Secret Art that assisted in his rise to become a Great Emperor.

Apart from the Seeking Passion Supreme Art, the Seeking Passion Great Emperor had left many other relics to his descendants before he passed on.

The Wind and Thunder Divine Spear was the original Natal Emperor Artifact of the Seeking Passion Great Emperor when he was alive, so its power and lethality was naturally immense!

One could see Feng Xuan’s determination to kill Yang Kai when he summoned the Wind and Thunder Divine Spear to fight against him, who was merely a First-Order Emperor Realm Master.

Pressured by the approaching Wind and Thunder Divine Spear, Yang Kai’s expression turned solemn. He felt a sense of crisis that he had never felt before, as if he was about to die the next moment.

Ji Yao’s face also paled slightly.

At the critical moment, Yang Kai stretched out his hand, and a simple little bell materialised before him.

This small bell that seemed to be thoroughly worn by time was engraved with many mysterious patterns. In an instant, it expanded to the size of a house, shielding Yang Kai and Ji Yao behind it.

Mountains and Rivers Bell!

As soon as this Ancient Exotic Artifact appeared, a wave of aura that could suppress the Heavens and Earth filled the air, causing the numerous Emperor Realm Masters who were rushing over to suddenly stagnate, their chests tightening as if they were being crushed by a large mountain.

Its Desolate Aura was released instantly.

Things did not end here though as Yang Kai slammed his palm forward and patted the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

*Hong…*

The ringing of the bell shot straight into the sky and the suppressive force suddenly multiplied. At this moment, countless cultivators hovering in the air dropped like dumplings, unable to resist. Even the Emperor Realm Masters could barely resist this suppressive force.

“What the hell is that?!” Feng Xuan staggered, realising the formidability of this bell. He was shocked that even someone as powerful as him felt his aura tumbling at a mere knell of this bell.

*Hong…*

There was another loud clang in the next instant, caused by the Wind and Thunder Divine Spear striking the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

The moment the two artifacts touched, the original form of the Wind and Thunder Divine Spear reappeared, its brightness dimmed somewhat as it bounced away. On the contrary, the Mountains and Rivers Bell remained exactly where it was, without even a single scratch, as sturdy as a mountain.

Yang Kai, however, spurted a mouthful of blood.

Unlike the last time when he was pretending to be injured by Ji Yao’s sword strike by biting his tongue, he was really injured this time.

The Mountains and Rivers Bell was an Ancient Exotic Artifacts and naturally not afraid of the Wind and Thunder Divine Spear, but as it was linked to Yang Kai, part of the impact of the attack was transferred to its owner still.

The power of the inheritance left by the Seeking Passion Great Emperor was truly extraordinary.

“Let’s go!” Yang Kai bellowed, retrieving the Mountains and Rivers Bell and enveloping Ji Yao and Nanmen Da Jun with his Space Principles before vanishing from the spot.

Silence descended where Yang Kai had just fled.

Bewilderment etched on their faces, the Emperor Realm Masters who had originally planned to rush to the rescue stood frozen on the spot, unable to move an inch.

Although the previous battle was short, the earth-shattering fluctuations displayed the intensity of the fight. No one could have imagined that a trivial First-Order Emperor Realm Master could compete against a Master like Feng Xuan, and was even able to retreat successfully.

“Where did he go?”

“Where is that little brat?”

“Who was he?”

Doubts arose in the Emperor Masters’ hearts, but no one was able to answer them. Perhaps the Seeking Passion Sect knew the identity of that person, but at this time, who would dare to speak? Feng Xuan looked extremely aggrieved, as if someone had just killed his parents and stolen his wives, so no one wanted to touch his nerves…
