The reason why the Cave Heavens and Paradises wanted to borrow the Good Fortune Divine Furnace was to create more Yin and Yang Element materials in the Sixth-Order and above, so how could they use those materials to exchange for the right to use the Good Fortune Divine Furnace?

Yang Kai’s statement had undoubtedly rendered everybody else speechless.

“I just came back to the Star Boundary, so I have many affairs to deal with. Please excuse me,” Yang Kai said and departed with a flash, leaving behind many Open Heaven Realm Masters looking at each other perplexedly.

Dong Su Zhu looked up into the sky from the top of a certain Spirit Peak. Hua Qing Si had immediately sent a message to inform the two Elders about Yang Kai’s return as soon as he arrived in the Star Boundary. Overjoyed to learn that her Son had returned, Dong Su Zhu had specially come out here to wait for his arrival.

Yang Ying Feng walked out of the bamboo building behind her, his arms clasped behind his back, and snorted, “He doesn’t even come back to visit his Parents as soon as he returns. We truly wasted our time raising this Son.”

Although he said those words, his eyes would glance around from time to time with an earnest expression.

Dong Su Zhu turned around to glare at him, “You talk too much! Our Son has a different status now. High Heaven Palace is so enormous and he has not returned for so many years; I’m sure he has many things to discuss with Manager Hua. You can go back if you’re upset. Nobody is forcing you to wait here.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Yang Ying Feng sighed and muttered, “Defeated by a loving Mother!”

During their conversation, space nearby rippled. Immediately after that, a figure emerged. It was none other than Yang Kai, whom these two Elders had been yearning all day and all night to see.

Dong Su Zhu hurriedly went forward to greet him, “Son, you’re back!”

“Mother!” Yang Kai nodded in greeting before he turned to look at Yang Ying Feng nearby, “Father!”

Yang Ying Feng grunted sullenly in response, then he turned around and entered the bamboo building.

Dong Su Zhu took Yang Kai’s hand and examined him carefully. After a while, she finally said in satisfaction, “You didn’t get thinner. In fact, you’re gotten stronger. You must have suffered a lot outside all these years.”

Yang Kai smiled and shook his head, “I’m used to it.”

He carefully perceived her aura and raised his eyebrows in surprise, “Mother, have you already advanced into the Open Heaven Realm?”

She nodded, “That’s right. I’m also in the Open Heaven Realm now.”

It all felt like a dream whenever she recalled everything that she experienced over the years. Starting from the Yang Family in the Great Han Dynasty up until now, it was difficult to imagine that she would advance into the Open Heaven Realm one day.

“Which Order?” He looked concerned.

She smiled, “Fifth-Order.”

Yang Kai breathed a sigh of relief, “That’s great.”

Thanks to the feedback from the World Tree in the Star Boundary back then, his Parents had been lucky enough to condense their Dao Seals. Yang Kai had personally examined them once, and with his Parents’ original aptitude, the Third-Order Open Heaven Realm would have been their limits even if they managed to advance into the Open Heaven Realm. It was only thanks to the Star Boundary’s World Tree that they had hopes of a better outcome.

With a two-pronged approach involving the Divine Dao Water and the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills, Dong Su Zhu managed to advance into the Open Heaven Realm in recent years.

“What about Father?” Yang Kai asked.

“He is also in the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm!” Dong Su Zhu laughed.

Speaking of which, there had been some risks involved when the two Elders advanced into the Open Heaven Realm. Their aptitude had barely been enough after all. Advancing into the Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm would have been the safest choice. Be that as it may, they both knew that their future limit would be in the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm if they could advance into the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm. That was why they decided to take the risk.

It was not purely for their own future achievements of course. They had been living under Yang Kai’s protection all these years; hence, they wished that there would come a day when they could help their Son instead of simply staying at home in retirement.

A Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was bound to have some qualifications, right? That was why the two Elders had been working hard on their cultivation after their advancement. In any case, there was no shortage of resources in High Heaven Palace. Not to mention, Hua Qing Si strongly supported their cultivation and freely gave them whatever resources they needed.

“Come come. Let’s go inside and talk.” Dong Su Zhu led Yang Kai into the bamboo hut by the hand.

The family of three spent a joyous and harmonious time together as they casually chatted with each other.

Dong Su Zhu suddenly said, “By the way, how are Xiao’er and Xue’er doing?”

Yang Kai replied, “They’re both doing well. Before I came here, Xiao’er followed a Senior to the Divine Spirit’s Ancestral Land. The environment in that place will be highly beneficial for his cultivation. Xue’er couldn’t follow him, so she stayed behind at Void Land to cultivate in retreat.”

Dong Su Zhu complained, “That little girl… Why doesn’t she know to come back and visit us?”

Yang Ying Feng stroked his neatly combed beard and quickly said, “Speaking of Xiao’er and Xue’er, there’s something we need to discuss.”

Yang Kai asked in confusion, “Father, what do you wish to discuss?”

Yang Ying Feng and Dong Su Zhu exchanged a glance with each other. In the end, Dong Su Zhu was the one to speak, “The two children can be said to have grown up together. Disregarding their hierarchy in the family, they can be said to be childhood sweethearts. Moreover, they spent so many years living and cultivating together. I’m sure they’ve secretly developed feelings for each other by now. As their Big Brother and Foster Father, you’ve always been running around outside all the time, so I have no idea whether you noticed anything, but it is as plain as day to the two of us.”

“But, there is a generational gap between them in terms of seniority and hierarchy. Xiao’er is your Adopted Son. When it comes to honorifics, he has to call Xue’er ‘Little Aunt’ by right.” Yang Ying Feng elaborated, “Kai’er, you’ve always been assertive. How do you think this matter should be handled?”

Yang Kai pondered in silence for a moment.

The truth was that he had given some thought to Yang Xiao and Yang Xue’s matters in the past. When a man and a woman lived and cultivated together for hundreds of years, starting from when they were just little children, it was only natural for feelings to grow between them. It was just that the two little ones had never expressed anything to him, so he did not wish to speak rashly. Nevertheless, it was time to make up his mind now that his Parents had brought up this matter.

A short while later, he answered, “In terms of seniority and hierarchy, there is no denying that Xiao’er is one generation younger than Xue’er, but if we look at it from the perspective of them as Disciples under the same Master, they share a Senior Brother and Junior Sister relationship. What I’m trying to say is that we should let nature take its course. We can leave this matter to them. If something really does come of this, then they each have their own seniority over the other. It’s not a big deal anyway. Cultivators don’t really care about these minor details. Besides, there is no real blood relationship between them. Even if they were to marry each other, it would be an auspicious matter.”

Yang Ying Feng and Dong Su Zhu exchanged a glance with each other, with Yang Ying Feng asking worriedly, “Even if that’s the case, will outsiders say anything?”

Yang Kai laughed, “Just let them follow their hearts. Why should we care what other people might say? If they can’t even withstand a few unsolicited remarks, then there is no need for them to be together.”

Dong Su Zhu nodded, “That’s true… To cultivators, age and seniority are not very important. Even among our Daughters-in-Law, many of them are much older than you. If we really had to follow honorifics, then we would have to call her ‘Senior’.”

Needless to say, she was referring to Yu Ru Meng.

As one of the Demon Race Demon Saints, Yu Ru Meng was countless times older than Yang Kai. Even Xue Yue, Shan Qing Luo, and Ji Yao were also much older than Yang Kai. There was no need to even mention Zhu Qing in this regard. Only Xia Ning Chang and Su Yan were of similar age to Yang Kai.

Yang Ying Feng also nodded, “Putting it this way, then we have nothing to worry about. We only need to clarify the two children’s intentions.”

“That’s right!” While speaking, Yang Kai laughed again, “By the way, Mother, Father, I came back to ask you for a favour.”

Dong Su Zhu smiled, “You are our Son. Just speak up if there’s something you need from us. Why would you need us to do you a favour?”

With a wave of his hand, two figures suddenly appeared out of nowhere. One was a stunning beauty, and the other was a slightly foolish-looking man. These two had been in the middle of doing something when they were summoned from the Small Universe by Yang Kai without any warning, so they were a little confused at first.

After looking around their surroundings and seeing Yang Kai, both of them quickly bowed in greeting, “Honoured Master!”

“Honoured Master?” Dong Su Zhu looked at Zhao Ya and Zhao Ye Bai in surprise, “Kai’er, did you take on Disciples?”

Yang Kai nodded and made the introductions, “This boy with the silly look on his face is Zhao Ye Bai; this smart and quick-witted girl is Zhao Ya.” Then, he turned to those two and added, “These two are your Master’s Parents!”

Zhao Ye Bai immediately became dumbstruck and asked in a panic, “Master, you have Parents too?”

Yang Kai kicked Zhao Ye Bai, “Nonsense! Why wouldn’t I have Parents? Did you think I popped out of a rock!?

Zhao Ye Bai quickly waved his hand and responded in embarrassment, “No no no, Master! That’s not what I meant!”

Zhao Ya tugged at Zhao Ye Bai and knelt on the ground with a thud. She bowed respectfully, “Zhao Ya greets Grand Masters!”

Only then did Zhao Ye Bai return to his senses and hurriedly bow in greeting, “Zhao Ye Bai greets Grand Masters!”

Dong Su Zhu smiled brightly, waving her hand to help the two up as she called out, “What good children. Stand up, stand up.”

A gentle force wrapped around Zhao Ya and Zhao Ye Bai, and they stood involuntarily.

“Oh my, this little girl is really quite pretty.” Dong Su Zhu examined Zhao Ya and did not hesitate to praise the girl.

Zhao Ya smiled sweetly and shyly said, “Thank you, Grand Master.”

Dong Su Zhu quipped, “I wonder which smelly brat will be so lucky to have you in the future.”

Zhao Ya blushed slightly and glanced at Zhao Ye Bai. On the other hand, Zhao Ye Bai was standing with his hands clenched tightly into fists, his head straight, and his chest raised slightly. It was obvious that he was very nervous. There was even a sheen of fine sweat covering his forehead.

[Numbskull!] Zhao Ya pouted to herself.

Seeing this scene, Dong Su Zhu immediately understood the situation. She then beckoned Zhao Ya over. When Zhao Ya approached, she took the young woman’s small hand, took off one of the bracelets on her own arm before placing it in Zhao Ya’s hand, “Since this is our first time meeting each other, you can consider this a gift from your Grand Master.”

Zhao Ya looked down. Although she could not identify the Grade of the bracelet, she knew that it was an extraordinary item; thus, she quickly shook her head and said, “Grand Master, this is far too precious. I can’t accept this.”

“Just take it. It is the first time your Master has ever taken a Disciple. As your Grand Master, how can I fail to show some sincerity?”

Helpless, Zhao Ya turned to look at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded, “The gifts from your Elders cannot be refused!”

Upon hearing what her Master said, she finally pursed her scarlet lips and said, “Xiao Ya thanks you for the gift, Grand Master!”

“Good girl!” Dong Su Zhu smiled and patted Zhao Ya’s head.

Seeing this, Yang Ying Feng could only dig out a chainmail-like Artifact Armour from his Space Ring and hand it to Zhao Ye Bai, “This isn’t a particularly expensive item, but it suits your current cultivation. Consider this a meeting gift from your Grand Master.”

Having learned from Zhao Ya’s previous experience, Zhao Ye Bai did not refuse; instead, he cupped his fist and shouted in a deep voice, “Zhao Ye Bai thanks Grand Master for the gift!”

He took two steps forward and reached out to take the Artifact Armour with both hands. It was almost as though he was carrying a supreme treasure as he respectfully stepped back.

Although it was only the first meeting, the performance of the two children was enough for the two Elders to obtain an idea of their personalities.

Zhao Ya was undoubtedly more likeable thanks to her cheerful personality. On the other hand, Zhao Ye Bai was relatively slow-witted in comparison. He also had a simple and honest temperament. What’s more, these were the Disciples that Yang Kai took in. Regardless of their aptitude, there was definitely nothing wrong with their characters.
