“When will the Dragon Pool open?” Yang Kai asked again.

“The Dragon Force of the Dragon Pool has recently surged, indicating that the opening of the Dragon Pool will be in the coming months; however, the opening of the Dragon Pool is a significant occasion for the Dragon Clan, so they are still in preparation.”

Yang Kai only feared that he would have to wait for several dozens to hundreds of years. If so, there was no point as the crusade would have already started or even ended by then. Such a situation wasn’t impossible either because, for Races with as long a lifespan as the Divine Spirits, several dozen to hundreds of years was just like a snap of the fingers to a mortal.

If it was only a matter of a few months, Yang Kai could still afford to wait.

After pondering for a while, Yang Kai asked, “Since the Bloodline Talent of the Phoenix Clan is the Dao of Space, why didn’t the Human Race come to you for help to repair the Universe Temples in the 3,000 Worlds during the early years when they were only damaged and not yet disabled?”

In the end, he was asked to solve this particular problem, causing him to spend a lot of time studying the Universe Array in the Universe Temple in order to repair those abandoned Universe Temples.

Yang Kai previously believed that the Human Race was helpless because there wasn’t anyone proficient enough in the Dao of Space until his appearance. But now that he was aware of the Phoenix Clan’s ability, it made him question this conclusion.

“It is true that those in my Phoenix Clan are naturally skilled in the Dao of Space, but this is a Bloodline Talent that we innately possess, which is very different from the Human Race’s mastery over the Dao of Space through rigorous training and studies. So, the way members of the Phoenix Clan interpret and use the Dao of Space is quite different from the way Humans do, which makes our methods and knowledge somewhat incompatible. Additionally, repairing the Universe Temple not only requires knowledge of the Dao of Space, but also of the Dao of Spirit Arrays, so it wasn’t an issue that the Phoenix Clan could easily resolve. Besides, both the Dragon and Phoenix Clans are restricted by the Great Ancestral Bloodline Oath to not leave the No-Return Pass.”

“Oh,” Yang Kai plainly remarked. To think of it, though the Phoenix Clan members were proficient in the Dao of Space, it didn’t mean that they knew how to repair the Universe Arrays.

On top of that, there was the Great Ancestral Bloodline Oath. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Yang Kai didn’t know much about what this Great Oath mentioned, but since ancestral bloodlines were involved, it was clearly something quite serious.

He also inquired about some Dragon Clan information that wasn’t confidential, so Huang Si Niang answered him honestly.

After half a day, Yang Kai stood up sincerely to show courtesy, “Many thanks, Si Niang, for dispelling all of my doubts.”

He would still be perplexed at this point if Huang Si Niang hadn’t explained so much to him. Even though there would always be a path to the destination, it would be preferable if he had known what he was about to encounter sooner so he could prepare himself.

Looking at it now, the Dragon Clan and the Ninth-Orders Old Ancestors must have reached an agreement. The Dragon Clan would uphold its end of the bargain as long as Yang Kai did not willingly withdraw. Regardless, Yang Kai was unsure if there would be any obstructions along the way.

“It’s nothing. It has always been boring living in the No-Return Pass all these years. It’s unusual for something interesting and fun to happen, so it was quite nice being able to watch the show just now,” Huang Si Niang said honestly. As to whether her words would offend the Dragon Clan, they clearly wouldn’t; they were prideful, but not neurotic.

“I have another request, and I hope Si Niang will agree to it,” Yang Kai bowed with a sincere attitude. He had to humble himself as he requested help. It didn’t matter because Huang Si Niang might appear to be a young woman, but she should already be quite old.

“Tell me. Then, I’ll decide.” Since Huang Si Niang was not a fool, she didn’t agree immediately.

Yang Kai chuckled upon her reply and said shyly, “This is this Junior’s first visit to the No-Return Pass, and I have nowhere to stay. The Dragon Clan doesn’t seem to have the intention of welcoming me either. I’m part of the Dragon Clan nevertheless, so it is sad to see them treating me like an outsider. Can I temporarily stay here at Si Niang’s place since there is still some time before the Dragon Pool opens? You won’t let me live on the streets, will you?”

“You want to borrow a place at my residence?” Huang Si Niang looked at him and chuckled.

“It’s not for nothing. Si Niang, do tell me if you need any help. Or perhaps I can pay for it?” Added Yang Kai hastily.

“What do you have that would benefit me?” Huang Si Niang spat disdainfully.

Putting aside that Yang Kai wouldn’t be very wealthy as he was only a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, even if he had anything valuable, Huang Si Niang might not be interested because Divine Spirits like her had acquired many great things over the course of their long lives.

Yang Kai hurriedly took out a set of Yellow and Blue Crystals and handed them over, “Si Niang, are these good enough?”

He had a lot of wonderful things in his possession, but Yang Kai surmised that the only items that could impress a Phoenix were the Yellow and Blue Crystals; after all, these things came from the Chaotic Dead Territory and were the condensed power of Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan.

The Sun’s Burning Light and Moon’s Serene Glimmer were the common ancestors of all Divine Spirits, so these Crystals should be quite alluring to the Divine Spirits.

However, he was somewhat unsure as the Yellow and Blue Crystals, which he always regarded as resources to generate Purifying Light, didn’t hold any special meaning to him. He took them out just to give it a try.

What surprised him was when Huang Si Niang saw the Yellow Crystal and Blue Crystal, her eyes lit up and she swiftly snatched them up. After some examination, she looked up and asked, “Are these from the Chaotic Dead Territory?”

“You’re right!” Yang Kai gave a big thumbs-up to Huang Si Niang, “Si Niang’s eyes are as sharp as a hawk’s. You have excellent observation skills!”

Huang Si Niang did not react to his obvious toadying.

She put away the crystals as she turned her palm, saying, “Good. You really do know how to show your sincerity. I’ll let you temporarily live here.”

“Many thanks, Si Niang!” Yang Kai rejoiced, “Then, this Junior shall go take a rest. It has been a tiring journey here. I won’t be disturbing Si Niang for now.”

With that being said, he rushed away in a blink of an eye.

The inner space of the Phoenix Nest was actually really large.

Watching his leaving figure, Huang Si Niang shook her head and said, “That slippery brat.”

Feng Liu Liang, who had been silent the whole time, said suddenly, “You normally don’t like to interact with Humans. You sure were acting very differently today.”

The arrival of Humans was not rare at the No-Return Pass as it was the only transit point between the 3,000 Worlds and the Black Ink Battlefield, so fresh manpower was sent here quite frequently.

Still, over the years, Huang Si Niang never had such interaction with any Human.

Huang Si Niang glanced at him and pointedly stated, “I don’t believe that you didn’t feel it.”

Feng Liu Lang replied, “It seems like it’s not my imagination. That kid has a Phoenix Clan’s aura on him.”

“This is also what I find to be unusual,” Huang Si Niang replied with a nod, “He already possesses a Dragon Source, so he couldn’t possess a Phoenix Source as well, right?”

“The coexistence of Dragon and Phoenix Sources in a single body is impossible; it should be that he has recently been in close contact with someone from our Clan.”

Huang Si Niang shook her head, “As far as I know, he has been on the Black Ink Battlefield for hundreds of years and has had no chance to come into contact with anyone from our Clan. Even if he had, the aura would have quickly dissipated. I’m not sure why this is happening either.”

“Those from the Phoenix Clan are rare, and most of them are currently living within the Immortal Parasol Tree. However, there are still some who wander outside. I have no idea if they are still living or not, but perhaps we can locate one of them if we identify who he interacted with,” he replied.

“That’s why I want to keep him here.”

By keeping Yang Kai close, they could observe him more easily. Although Yang Kai had taken out a set of Yellow and Blue Crystals, which contained the essence of the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer from the Chaotic Dead Territory, they were actually quite useless to Huang Si Niang.

Just when they were talking here though, the entire Phoenix Nest shook abruptly, making Huang Si Niang’s beautiful face pale.

…..

Atop a mountain, some distance away, Yang Kai was sitting cross-legged.

His World Force surged, and Space Principles rippled, resonating with the rich Space Dao Essence contained in this Sealed World.

When Yang Kai entered the Phoenix Nest, he saw that the Universe’s ancient aura was still preserved here. Additionally, because it was a Phoenix Nest of the Phoenix Clansman, Space Dao Essence was incredibly rich and abundant.

With the help of these Space Dao Essences, the Phoenix Clan members could continue to cultivate and become stronger in their own Phoenix Nest, which was why it was said that the Phoenix Nest was the root of every Phoenix.

If someone else came to a Phoenix Nest, they would only get to experience the ancient aura of the Universe.

But it was different for Yang Kai as he benefited greatly from the incredibly rich Space Dao Essence present in this place. His mastery over the Dao of Space could be made stronger by absorbing and refining these Dao Essences. At the same time, comprehending the differences of the Grand Dao of Space between ancient times and now would further enhance his mastery.

In addition, as this Dao Essence was preserved in its most primitive form, it made it simple for Yang Kai to refine it as it was extremely pure, without any trace of impurity.

To Yang Kai, that place was a cultivation paradise!

This was an unexpected gain. He had intended to cultivate and better his Dragon Clan Bloodline in the Dragon Pool when he arrived at the No-Return Pass, but before he had even entered the Dragon Pool, he gained advantages from the Phoenix Clan.

Fate was truly unpredictable.

On his side, Yang Kai devoured and refined the Space Dao Essence in the Phoenix Nest eagerly, while on Huang Si Niang’s side, her beautiful face paled due to how quickly the Space Dao Essence in her Phoenix Nest was dissipating.

She needed to cultivate like him too, and although the Immortal Parasol Tree would gradually replenish the Dao Essences even if they dissipated completely, Yang Kai’s method of cultivating was akin to him drying out the lake to catch all the fish.

It was not beneficial for her if the Dao Essences here were all consumed; after all, replenishment took time, and if the balance in the Phoenix Nest was disrupted, the entire structure would be at risk of rupturing.

Yang Kai’s action right now was comparable to him stealing all of her family’s property.

To be honest, Huang Si Niang knew that once Yang Kai started to cultivate, the Space Dao Essence in her Phoenix Nest would definitely decrease, but she never expected such a situation.

She and Feng Liu Lang both greatly underestimated Yang Kai’s mastery over the Dao of Space; he might even be a level higher than them.

With the suction force emerging from Yang Kai, the Phoenix Nest experienced a world-trembling shock.

[Is he even Human?] Huang Si Niang and Feng Liu Lang felt that they were incomparable to Yang Kai when it came to cultivating the Dao of Space at this point.

A loud cry echoed throughout the Phoenix Nest as Huang Si Niang shot into the air quickly rushing over to Yang Kai.
