Yang Kai mulled this over for long, yet couldn’t come up with an answer.

He had arrived at the Star Boundary not long ago and he had met only a few Emperor Realm Masters. If he had really seen this red-robed woman, then he would have an impression of her.

Then, there were only two explanations for the current situation. One of them was that the woman was handling some matters here, and Qin Zhao Yang and him stumbled upon her by mistake.

As for the second one, she had been waiting for him and Qin Zhao Yang here...

The second explanation was very unlikely, so it could only be the first one.

As Yang Kai racked his brain over this, the red-robed woman suddenly opened her rosy mouth and spoke in an indifferent, yet pleasant voice. “You are talking to me, yet you still dare to hide within the ship? Daring!”

The woman wore a faint smile at the corners of her mouth, but her eyes were as cold as ever.

After she spoke, she slowly raised her lily-white hand and snapped her fingers. A scorching force suddenly emerged and formed a fist-sized fireball in front of her. That fireball shivered lightly then flew toward the ship.

The faces of Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang fell and they decisively flew outside.

*Bang*

A deafening explosion sound echoed out and the large ship had been engulfed by raging flames. Qin Zhao Yang had been swept by the explosion’s terrifying might and lost consciousness on the spot. to only be thrown onto the ground.

Yang Kai had also felt a scorching pain on his back, as if several of his ribs had been broken.

When he regained his balance, he turned his head to take a look and he found out that his ship had been quickly turned into ashes by the raging flames.

“My artifact!” Yang Kai shouted out of distress.

He had gotten a means of transport such as a Flying Artifact only with great difficulty and it was still an artifact of a pretty good grade, yet it had been destroyed by an Emperor Realm Master for no reason on his first trip.

Upon hearing him, the red-robed woman curled the corners of her lips and smiled with her cold eyes. She said calmly, “Lad, shouldn’t you worry over your life rather than your artifact?”

“Senior, who are you and why are you assaulting us?” Yang Kai turned his head to face her and shouted. Flames of anger were raging up in his heart!

The opponent was at least a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master and she had already destroyed his artifact at a slight disagreement, yet it looked like she still didn’t plan to let him off the hook and she wanted to attack him. How could he bear this any longer?

“You don’t have to know who I am.” The red-robed woman revealed a mesmerizing smile and spoke, then took light steps. She had used some unknown Divine Ability and closed in on Yang Kai with only two or three steps. When they were only thirty feet apart, she raised her hand and pointed it at Yang Kai then said, “You’re just an eyesore.”

After she spoke, she swatted the air with her fair hand. The World Principles were suddenly frozen and a formless wave of pressure assaulted Yang Kai’s body. His bones let out a snapping noise, as if they would shortly be crushed by the terrifying wave of pressure.

“Are you sick?” Yang Kai’s expression was unsightly. He never imagined that he would one day suffer such undeserved misfortune. She planned to kill him only because she found him an eyesore.

As he spoke, he used his Source Qi and a three-inch-wide sword appeared in his hand. He shouted, “Myriad Sword Move, a Single Man Guards the Pass.”

As Sword Light shone brightly, the Sword Qi let out a humming noise.

*Sizzle*

At this moment, it looked like the Myriads Sword had turned into innumerable swords that covered Yang Kai’s surroundings and they all shot out like a swarm of locusts.

“Huh? An Emperor Artifact?” Surprise flashed past the red-robed woman’s pretty eyes. But, she didn’t take him seriously and she only said mockingly, “How much of its might can you release with your weak cultivation base?”

*Rumble!*

As she spoke, many sparks broke in the air. It was a result of the innumerable Sword Qi’s collision against the formless wave of pressure.

But, Yang Kai had refined the Myriads Sword for only a short period and his cultivation base was still low. The Sword Qi was impressive-lookinghonourable but pretty weak, and it had been quickly extinguished by the boundless wave of pressure.

The terrifying wave of pressure swept Yang Kai and engulfed the region around him.

“It doesn’t matter how much of its might I can release, as I didn’t count on it to stop your Divine Ability.” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly reverberated behind the red-robed woman.

He held the sword with both hands and exerted all of his brute power and thrust it at the red-robed woman’s long neck.

The red-robed woman shouted in surprise, “Teleportation? Space Force? Interesting...”

As she spoke, she turned around and stared at Yang Kai with a smile. She didn’t plan to dodge his strike.

The sword fell upon her neck and cut her body into two halves, but Yang Kai couldn’t rejoice over this, and he suddenly retreated quickly as if he had been struck by a scorpion tail.

Meanwhile, the red-robed woman suddenly appeared next to his former place and tapped the afterimage left by him.

“You can dodge even this?” The red-robed woman furrowed her brow and mumbled, “It looks like I have underestimated you...”

As her voice fell, her expression suddenly changed and she observed the surroundings with furrowed brows.

A pitch-black hole suddenly appeared next to her and a terrifying suction force emanated from it.

On the other side, Yang Kai weaved hand seals and shouted through gnashed teeth: “Banishment!”

“Do you plan to deal with me...” The red-robed woman revealed a smile. “Through such means?”

The woman only waved her hand and the black hole immediately disappeared.

Yang Kai chuckled bitterly and stood in his place motionless then collected the Myriads Sword.

“Huh? Do you plan to give up?” The red-robed woman observed Yang Kai with great interest and spoke mockingly.

“I can’t beat you, so why would I continue fighting?” Yang Kai said with an indifferent look plastered on his face.

“Then, are you ready to die?” The red-robed woman laughed in response.

Yang Kai replied, “It doesn’t matter! In any case, I’ll only suffer more if I fight back, please give me a quick death. But, I still want to ask you, why did you attack me? How did I offend you?”

“Didn’t I tell you already... I found you an eyesore,” the red-robed woman replied.

“Crazy woman!” Yang Kai said resentfully.

“Pff....” At a certain region in the void, a person was drinking tea slowly, yet he suddenly splurted a mouthful of tea upon hearing Yang Kai’s words and he had almost sprayed it on the face of the young girl opposite him.

The young girl was oblivious to this and she was still observing Yang Kai and the red-robed woman nervously, entreating the man anxiously, “Uncle Li, please let go of me. I’ll go back with you to the island. Why are you making trouble for Brother Yang, he’s only a First-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivator and he’s no match for you.”

“That’s not true,” the man called ‘Uncle Li’ by the young girl shook his head and corrected her, “It isn’t me who is causing trouble for the young lad, but your Aunty Feng and it has nothing to do with me. I’m only drinking tea here...”

“Why? Aunty Feng has never seen Brother Yang, so why is she making trouble for him?” The young girl asked anxiously.

“Xiao Qi...” Uncle Li wore an experienced look and said meaningfully, “The outside world is... very complex, and the outside world’s men are all cunning and shrewd. Your Aunty Feng is doing this for your own good.”

Upon hearing this, Mo Xiao Qi pouted then snorted and said, “I don’t care, if you don’t call back Aunty Feng, then I’ll... I’ll tell her that you peeped while she was bathing.”

Upon hearing this, Uncle Li’s expression changed and his face turned deathly pale, while beads of sweat streaked across his forehead. He said, “Xiao Qi, you can eat whatever you want, but you can’t say whatever you want. I’m a just and honorable gentleman and I have never done such a despicable thing... Fine, fine, it was only one time, a single time and I was caught by you before I could see anything. Young girl, you really have a good memory. You were only four years old at that time.”

“Don’t try to change the subject, I’m asking you, will you do it or not?” Mo Xiao Qi snorted and said, “If you dare to refuse, then I’ll add interesting details to that story and turn that single occurrence into dozens and dozens then tell them to Aunty Feng one by one...”

“Ah! Spare me! Please!” Uncle Li’s expression turned bitter. “Let me off the hook, why are you making life hard for me...”

“Then will you agree or not?” Mo Xiao Qi looked coldly at Uncle Li.

Uncle Li sighed and said, “If it had been a while ago, then I could still do you a favour, but now...”

“But now, what?”

“The young lad dared to call your Aunty Feng crazy, he’s done for!” Uncle Li spoke, taking pleasure in Yang Kai’s misfortune!

“Ah... No!!” Mo Xiao Qi was scared and she turned her head to take a look. As expected, Aunty Feng had been infuriated and her pretty eyes shone with a cold glint. Those were clear signs she had gotten angry for real, and even Mo Xiao Qi was afraid to see her in this state.

“Lad, what did you just say?” The red-robed woman revealed a sweet smile, but Yang Kai could clearly discern that her voice had turned bone-chilling.

However, the current situation was already bad enough, and Yang Ka had thrown caution to the wind. If the woman dared to attempt killing him for real, then he would open the Golden Silver Seal in his belly and give her a great surprise. At that time, even if he wasn’t a match for her, he could still escape, probably.

But, the sole issue was that he didn’t have enough power to seal the Demon Sense and boundless Demon Qi again. The Firmament Tree still needed more time to accumulate enough Sealing Power.

“Crazy woman!” Yang Kai raised his head high and stared at the red-robed woman.

“Hehe...” The red-robed woman didn’t get angry, but rather laughed in response. However, her voice suddenly turned sharp, “Do you think I won’t kill you right now?”

Yang Kai raised his brows and said in surprise, “Huh? Does this mean... You didn’t plan to kill me?”

As he spoke, his tense nerves relaxed and he said with a smile, “I already found this strange, you’re a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, yet you let go of everything and ran over here to block our path. What are you up to? I have never seen you and don’t have any grievances with you.”

The red-robed woman sneered and said, “You think you’re clever?”

But upon hearing Yang Kai’s next words, the red-robed woman’s expression changed.

“Ah. Hello, Aunty Feng!”

A startled look appeared on the red-robed woman’s face. She didn’t expect that Yang Kai could see through her identity and disclose it. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

She quickly looked toward a certain region in the void. Uncle Li could only spread his arms in response, expressing that this had nothing to do with him.

“Aren’t you Aunty Feng?” Even though Yang Kai was questioning her, he spoke in a confident and sure tone, and he also cast a glance at the region observed by the red-robed woman a while ago. He waved his hand at the void and shouted with a smile. “Xiao Qi!”
