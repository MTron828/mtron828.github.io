Chapter 2294, Humiliation

Upon raising this question, Du Xian revealed a bewildered look. He didn’t know why this stranger, Yang Kai, was with Ye Jing Han, but he still didn’t show any animosity toward him, and it was the same for the other disciples of Thousand Leaves Sect. They were just sizing up Yang Kai curiously.

Yang Kai revealed a smile and cupped his fist at him, then spoke, “Yang Kai greets Brother Du.”

Ye Jing Han said, “Young Master Yang is my distinguished guest. I planned to bring him back to the Sect to discuss a certain matter with my father, but I was dispatched by him to Sky Crane City midway. Junior and Senior Brothers, you must never slight him!”

She spoke solemnly, as if Yang Kai had some kind of prominent status, so Du Xian and Wu Ma couldn’t help exchanging strange glances, some doubt welling up in their hearts.

Upon releasing their Divine Senses, they discovered that Yang Kai was just a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator. He was also not clad in luxurious robes and did not look like a disciple from one of the top Sects, so why was Ye Jing Han being so cautious around him?

They had many doubts about this, but they still didn’t raise any questions and just nodded lightly in response.

“Since everyone has arrived, let’s enter the city. That old thing’s wedding ceremony is tomorrow, isn’t it?” Ye Jing Han looked at Du Xian and asked without providing any further explanation about Yang Kai.

After all, she had invited Yang Kai to repair the World Crossing Space Array, which was an extremely delicate matter which was best kept secret. She didn’t even notify and report it to Ye Hen yet.

At this moment, Du Xian finally averted his attention from Yang Kai and spoke with a grave look, “Ye’er, watch your tongue.”

Ye Jing Han spat out her tongue in response, “It’s already polite of me to call him an old thing, he’s already got half a foot into the grave, yet he’s still taking in new concubines. I wonder which ignorant girl had been deceived by him this time?”

Wu Ma revealed a bitter smile and spoke, “She might not have been deceived, but rather forced. These past years, the City Lord has been taking in new concubines over and over again, yet he still hasn’t gotten any male descendants... I wonder if his body can keep up with this for much longer... Hehehe...”

“It’s divine retribution!” Ye Jing Han said with a pleased look.

Du Xian rubbed his forehead, “Fine, you have already vented your frustrations so leave it there. We have come to congratulate him, not stir up trouble. Before setting off, Master warned me repeatedly and he urged me to not cause any trouble; after all, the representatives of all the big Sects and forces in the area will be attending.”

Ye Jing Han just pouted in response with a displeased look on her face and didn’t say anything else.

Du Xian smiled at Yang Kai, “Brother Yang, we must have made a mockery of ourselves in front of you.”

“It’s fine,” Yang Kai waved his hand in response.

“Let’s tidy up and enter the city,” Du Xian shouted at the other people.

The crowd straightened out their clothes a little then went toward the city gate under the lead of Du Xian.

The gifts the Thousand Leaves Sect brought were all stored in their Space Rings, so they didn’t really have anything to ‘tidy up’. Only people trying to openly flatter Luo Jin would use carriages to carry their goods. This way, as soon as they arrived at the City Lord Mansion, everyone would be able to clearly see the gifts they brought.

There was a long line of people in front of the city gate and the members of Thousand Leaves Sect did not plan to cut the line, so they just joined the queue and waited for their turn to enter the city.

Meanwhile, Ye Jing Han started apologizing to Yang Kai, as she was afraid to incur his displeasure.

The others didn’t know what kind of power and means Yang Kai had, but she was clear.

Just ten days ago, the Blood Dagger’s Four Ghosts had been slaughtered by Yang Kai, the scene of which was still vivid in her memory. If Yang Kai didn’t want to line up, he could just force his way into the city and no guard would be able to obstruct him, but doing so would incur a calamity for Thousand Leaves Sect.

Fortunately, it looked like Yang Kai was quite relaxed and didn’t seem irritated.

Upon seeing this, the expressions of Du Xian and Wu Man turned even more doubtful. They both couldn’t understand why Ye Jing Han treated Yang Kai so prudently, as if she was dealing with an Emperor Realm Master.

The line advanced quickly, and in less than half a cup of tea’s time, it was their turn.

At the city gate, the man in charge of checking goods and visitors grinned upon seeing Ye Jing Han and cupped his fists at her, “So it is Thousand Leaves Sect’s Young Lady, excuse our disrespect for not offering a proper welcome.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He was an average-looking middle-aged man clad in festive clothes with a smile plastered on his face, a very fake one at that.

He could be considered to be decent in strength, a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, and it looked like he held some important position in Sky Crane City.

Usually, it wouldn’t be up to such an expert supervising the gates, but this wasn’t an ordinary time. All the factions in the nearby area were gathering at Sky Crane City to congratulate the City Lord, so someone of status needed to be present to welcome them.

He was that man!

As per what he had just said, he had recognized Ye Jing Han, which wasn’t really strange by itself, as Ye Jing Han had already stated that Sky Crane City’s Lord got his position only thanks to the support of Thousand Leaves Sect. The residents of Sky Crane City had obviously gotten a lot of chances to interact with the members of Thousand Leaves Sect, so the daughter of Thousand Leaves Sect’s Sect Master was a well-known figure.

Ye Jing Han replied calmly with an ice-cold look plastered on her face, “Elder Si Ming, just do your job, there’s no need for false courtesy!”

Upon hearing this, the middle-aged man called Si Ming smiled, “Young Lady Ye, thank you for your understanding. Our Sky Crane City is honoured by your presence at the wedding of our City Lord. If Sir City Lord learns of it, he’ll be surely pleased. Please come in!”

Saying so, he beckoned at her and invited her into the city. He didn’t try to embarrass Ye Jing Han.

Ye Jing Han didn’t stand on ceremony and she just walked into the city directly.

But, when Du Xian, as well as the other people behind Ye Jing Han were about to enter the city, Si Ming suddenly raised his hand and blocked Du Xian’s way then shouted coldly, “What are your intentions here, are you trying to force your way into the city?”

Upon hearing this, Du Xian furrowed his brow, while Ye Jing Han who had been walking ahead stopped midway and turned over to gaze at them.

Si Ming shouted arrogantly, “Bold! You haven’t obtained my permission, yet you want to enter the city? Are you looking down on my Sky Crane City?”

Du Xian said with a displeased look on his face, “Elder Si Ming, are you blind or has your brain gotten worse with age? Didn’t you see that we came here together with our Sect’s Young Lady?”

“A brat like you still dares to curse at me?” Si Ming flew into a rage and snorted coldly, saying, “Do you think I don’t dare to arrest you right now?”

Du Xian squinted his eyes and sneered, “Elder Si Ming... What is your meaning here?”

Si Ming snorted and replied, “What do you think?”

Du Xian took a deep breath, trying hard to curb his anger, “We have come under our Sect Master’s order to congratulate City Lord Luo, are you trying to bar our way at the gate and make a joke of yourself in front of the masses?”

“You’ve come to congratulate our City Lord?” Si Ming said with feigned surprise then started sizing up Du Xian, his mouth curling into a sneer, “You’re clad in such cheap rags, which Sect do you belong to?”

“You... old dog, how shameless can you be!?” Upon hearing him, Wu Man flew into a rage. As long as one wasn’t blind, he would have noticed that they came with Ye Jing Han and they were all disciples of Thousand Leaves Sect, yet Si Ming still acted as if he didn’t recognize them. He didn’t just obstruct Du Xian and his companions, he openly mocked and disdained them.

He obviously wanted to humiliate Thousand Leaves Sect!

Upon seeing this, the cultivators lining up behind them to enter the city had also understood the other party’s intentions and they started whispering to each other.

Upon hearing the whispers of the crowd, the expression of the members of Thousand Leaves Sect turned ashen and unsightly.

They had just followed orders and came to congratulate the City Lord, yet they had been insulted so viciously at the city gate. No one would be able to bear this humiliation in silence and the few disciples of Thousand Leaves Sect had all started circulating their Source Qi, as if they were prepared to start a fight right here.

Si Ming jumped back in fright and spoke warily, “What are you doing? Are you trying to resort to violence? This is Sky Crane City, not the desolate wilderness you have come from. Even bumpkins like you dare to wreak havoc here?”

He shouted so solemnly, as if everything he said was pure truth, and the cultivators behind him couldn’t help but laugh in response. They all understood that this old man was playing the fool to shame Thousand Leaves Sect, but the latter still couldn’t fight back.

“Elder Si Ming!” Ye Jing Han cast a glance at him with the same cold look as before and spoke, “Elder Si Ming, have you already gone amnesiac? Can you not recognize our Thousand Leaves Sect’s emblem? Does my father have to come here in person to tell you this?”

Upon hearing this, Si Ming revealed a surprised look and looked at Ye Jing Han then said, “Young Lady Ye, what you are saying is...”

Saying so, he turned his head to observe Du Xian and the others and glanced at the Thousand Leaves Sect’s emblem on their robes. He then struck his forehead and said sheepishly, “Ah! Young Lady Ye, forgive my mistake, I didn’t notice it. So, those are the talented youths of your Thousand Leaves Sect. When my eyes fell upon them earlier, I thought they were just some bumpk... Cough... Cough...”

He put on such a serious act, as if he had just realized this for real and he kept apologizing to Ye Jing Han, as if he had just realized that Du Xian and the others were disciples of the Thousand Leaves Sect.

“Hmph!” Ye Jing Han had been infuriated by this and her pretty face went dark then flushed red. It was frustrating and she couldn’t even vent her pent-up emotions.

“Since you are the talented youths of the Thousand Leaves Sect, then you just have to register to enter the city. This has just flown out of my mind, please don’t take offence.” Si Ming beckoned at Du Xian and the others with a bright smile on his face.

“Register? What should we register for?” Ye Jing Han was surprised by what she had just heard.

Si Ming said with a smile, “Your name, Sect, as well as some other basic information. Young Lady Ye, you’re also aware that the City Lord’s wedding will be held tomorrow and it’s a very important event. These days, not just anyone can enter the city and any person who enters the city has to register. This is an important matter regarding the city’s order.”

Ye Jing Han spoke coldly, “Then why didn’t I see any of the people before us registering?”

Si Ming said with a smile, “Young Lady Ye, you have such sharp eyes. Those people... I recognize them all and I know of their backgrounds. So, they don’t have to register.”

“Are you implying that you don’t recognize our Thousand Leaves Sect’s disciples?” Ye Jing Han spoke through gnashed teeth with her fury apparent on her face. Si Ming had been embarrassing the Thousand Leaves Sect repeatedly and she couldn’t help but get angry. She didn’t even want to visit Sky Crane City and attend the wedding in the first place, yet she still suffered a lot of trouble for it. She couldn’t help but be filled with regret and hatred for coming here even more.

What was even more infuriating was that Si Ming was deliberately shaming her precious Thousand Leaves Sect in front of the whole crowd.
