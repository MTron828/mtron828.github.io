Sometimes, fortune arrives when one least expects it.

While Mo Huang was powerless to lift this Dragon Clan Secret Technique, Yang Kai was able to break it with ease. At that instant, Mo Huang was over the moon. Initially, he was biased against Yang Kai because of Mo Xiao Qi. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been so harsh towards someone who was his Junior. However, at this moment, he felt extremely grateful towards Yang Kai, thinking that he should return this favour one day.

The removal of the Binding Dragon Seal meant that Fu Xuan was no longer a criminal, so she didn’t have to be thrown into the Dragon Grave again.

Mo Huang shifted his attention to Zhu Yan and Fu Zhun as he had made up his mind. No matter what would happen, he had to leave with Fu Xuan on this day. If the two Elders insisted on stopping him, he would have no choice but to fight it out with them.

He had been longing for Fu Xuan while also blaming himself for all the years they have been apart. So this time, he was determined not to leave her behind again.

Then, he heaved a sigh of relief, as he realized that both Zhu Yan and Fu Zhun didn’t react to the fact that Binding Dragon Seal had been removed. Instead, they were just gazing at the narrowing Void Corridor in silence.

At the same time, Zhu Qing was also looking at the corridor.

After the corridor disappeared a moment later, Zhu Yan turned to look at Mo Huang and uttered, “Wu Kuang has fled. We have to inform the others about it so that they can prepare, especially those within Star Court.”

Mo Huang nodded, “En, I’ll go to Star Court later and discuss with Iron Blood on how to deal with it.”

Zhu Yan continued, “The Dragon Clan is responsible for the fact that Wu Kuang has fled. Brother Mo, just tell us straight away if you need any help.”

“Great Elder, since you’ve said so, I’ll ask for your help whenever I need it in the future. I’ll take my leave for now.” Upon finishing his words, Mo Huang was ready to leave with Fu Xuan.

Fu Zhun suddenly demanded, “You can leave, but Fu Xuan must stay!”

Mo Huang frowned, “Second Elder, do you still want to fight with me?”

[This woman is so unreasonable.] Mo Huang was truly infuriated. If Fu Zhun insisted on making things difficult for his wife and him, he was ready to turn Dragon Island upside down.

Nevertheless, Fu Zhun uttered dispassionately, “Fu Xuan’s foundation has been damaged after years of imprisonment. We have a Secret Technique to help her recuperate; does your Spirit Beast Island have such a technique? If you have one, you can bring her with you. I won’t stop you.”

Mo Huang was startled for a moment before he became elated. With a grin, he replied, “I see. That’s what you meant.”

Fu Zhun questioned coldly, “What do you think I meant, then?”

Mo Huang coughed and nodded lightly, “That’s alright, then… Xuan’er, you’ll stay here. I’ll go to Star Court now. After that, I’ll come here again with Xiao Qi to see you.” As he spoke, he stole a glance at Fu Zhun. Seeing that she frowned but didn’t show any sign of disagreement, he became ecstatic.

It seemed that what Yang Kai had done on this day had dealt a heavy blow to her. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have gone through such a transformation. Although she didn’t agree to let him bring his daughter to Dragon Island, she didn’t object to it at the very least.

In the past, Fu Zhun wouldn’t have reacted in such a way.

At the mention of Mo Xiao Qi, Fu Xuan’s gaze brightened as she nodded, “En.”

“Wait for me.” Mo Huang stroked her face, but he didn’t have the nerve to kiss her in front of everyone just like Yang Kai had done. [That brat was just too brazen!]

Then, he turned around and left the Dragon Temple with light steps.

Zhu Qing stepped forward to support Fu Xuan then as the latter was still weak. Both of these Dragon girls shared similar fates, so they naturally became closer to each other.

Countless stars were twinkling in the vast Starry Sky where a black Starship was navigating through the darkness like a giant beast. The Starship was about 300 metres long with a sleek design. Although it was a behemoth, the speed at which it was moving was quite fast.

The Starship was surrounded by an innumerable number of asteroids of different sizes that were passing it by. Sometimes, some asteroids would hit the Starship and cause some sparks, which spread across the surface like a ripple. However, the smaller asteroids couldn’t cause any damage to the Starship as its armour and defences would fend them off and break them into pieces should they come into contact.

Only the larger asteroids could cause the Starship to shake, but there hadn’t been any real danger on the way to its destination.

Inside the Starship, humming sounds could be heard coming from different arrays. In the control room, a group of cultivators appeared solemn as they looked out the transparent window that was made from crystals. Seeing those asteroids that were passing them by, they were all drenched in sweat.

[It’s an Asteroid Sea!]

When navigating through the Star Field inside a Starship, travellers were most afraid of two things. One was an Asteroid Sea, and the other was a Starry Sky Storm.

The former was still alright because most Asteroid Seas could be avoided by plotting appropriate courses in advance. With that said, some of the larger scale Asteroid Seas were unavoidable. However, the chance of coming across such Asteroid Seas was small in the vast Star Field.

On the other hand, a Starry Sky Storm was a more terrifying phenomenon in the Star Field as it was a disaster that could literally kill. If this 300-metre Starship was dragged into a Starry Sky Storm, it would be doomed.

Over the years, Asteroid Seas and Starry Sky Storms had destroyed many Starships and killed countless people.

Nevertheless, it had been an unlucky day for this particular Starship. There were many Masters aboard this Starship, and their Star Chart Master had charted a good navigation route for them. Supposedly, they shouldn’t fall into any danger as they just needed some time to reach their destination; however, they were now confronted by an Asteroid Sea that was coming from the front. It was already impossible for them to evade it the moment they discovered it.

Left with no choice, they had to keep moving forward and pass through the Asteroid Sea with caution.

A woman in an imperial dress was standing in the centre of the cabin. She appeared to be in her 20s, had long black hair, and a beautiful face. At the moment, she was giving orders with a solemn expression, her nose moist with sweat caused by her anxiety.

At the same time, the fragrance wafting from her body permeated the place. All the cultivators in the Starship, both men and women, were breathing more rapidly than usual, as though they were trying to breathe in the fragrance and imprint it in their minds so that they would never forget it.

“How much longer?” The woman suddenly looked in a different direction, where an old man was studying the Star Chart in his hands. A three-dimensional picture was displayed there, obviously a map of the region in Starry Sky in which the Starship was navigating.

Nobody knew how this old man had managed to draw this Star Chart, in which a small dot of light, which represented this Starship, was moving forward slowly. Countless smaller light dots, which represented the asteroids that might pose a threat to the Starship, were passing by as well.

Upon hearing the woman’s question, the old man gave it some thought and replied, “We’ll pass through this Asteroid Sea in one hour. We’re already halfway through it.”

The woman nodded upon hearing his reply, “Very good. Please continue to guide us.”

Apparently, this woman was the one in charge of this Starship. Although her cultivation was incredible, she was still respectful to this old man surnamed Chen. It couldn’t be helped, as this old man surnamed Chen was one of the most famous Star Chart Masters in the Star Field, whom she had paid a hefty price for helping them in this journey.

Star Chart Masters were highly reputable in the Star Field. They were just as important as the Alchemists and Artifact Refiners because, in order to navigate through the Star Field, a Start Chart was indispensable, and a good Star Chart Master could help a Starship evade unforeseen dangers.

With an embarrassed expression, Old Chen uttered, “Lady Lu is too polite. This Old Master should have noticed the existence of this Asteroid Sea. It was my fault that we fell into danger in the first place.”

“Life is full of unexpected circumstances,” Lu Huai Shuang replied.

Just then, she thought of something as her alluring gaze dimmed. With a forced smile, she uttered, “Old Chen, please don’t blame yourself. You’ve already helped us a lot. Without you, we’d have encountered countless crises already. It’s thanks to you that we’ve come so far.”

Old Chen said, “Many thanks for your high praise. This Chen will never forget this favour of yours.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

As they spoke, someone could be heard exclaiming, “Young Lady, we have a problem!”

Lu Huai Shuang’s expression changed as she turned to look at that person, “What happened?”

At this critical moment, she was most afraid of learning any bad news, which was why she was slightly nervous.

“An asteroid is approaching us, distance 100 kilometres.”

“How large is it?”

“It isn’t big, but… it’s giving off an unusually large energy signature.”

As they spoke, Lu Huai Shuang had already approached that person and taken a closer look, upon which she realized that there was indeed a light dot on that Spirit Array Star Chart that was coming at the Starship at incredible speed. In just a short moment, the distance between the asteroid and the Starship had been shortened by half.

After taking a glance at it, Lu Huai Shuang knitted her brows together while astounded, Old Chen uttered, “That’s strange. This asteroid isn’t very large, so why does it give off such a powerful energy fluctuation?”

He was an experienced man, but it was the first time he came across such a strange thing, which was why he was puzzled.

“Charge the Crystal Cannons!” Lu Huai Shuang yelled.

Then, she quickly added, “All ten!”

It was inevitable that they might fall into such a dangerous situation when navigating through the vast Starry Sky. When confronted by an unavoidable threat, the best option was to destroy it, and Crystal Cannons were the most effective means.

They wouldn’t use Crystal Cannons easily because a lot of Crystal Stones were consumed for every shot made; it was almost akin to burning piles of money.

It had to be said that although Lu Huai Shuang was a woman, she was more resolute than most men. It took a firm resolve to give the order to prepare all ten of the Starship’s cannons.

Her order was executed without delay and all ten Crystal Cannons emerged from the Starship’s hull before aiming at their target. Dazzling white lights were agglomerated as an astonishing energy fluctuation began spreading out.

The next moment, a jarring sound could be heard and a heavy blowback could be felt from one side of the Starship, causing the entire ship to shake. Ten beams of white light shot out in a particular direction into the void and accurately converged in a single spot.

The light exploded and illuminated the Starry Sky, as though a new Sun had been born all of a sudden, causing all in the cabin to narrow their eyes.

*Hong…*

Following that, a thunderous explosion rang out, stinging all of their eardrums. The asteroids around their target, be they big or small, were vaporized in an instant and disappeared.

Everyone heaved a sigh of relief seeing this. Although they knew how powerful their Crystal Cannons were, they were still reeling from the shock after witnessing the power of ten being fired all at once at a single target, rendering them unable to speak for a long time.

No matter what kind of asteroid was coming at them, it should have vanished into thin air by now.

Silavin: Yo, so starting the next arc, we are going to go back to the Star Fields. The distances of everything is quite a mess. Not consistent at all. I tried to correct them but I most likely missed some stuff…

Some things are supposed to be further and others, not so much. Some things are supposed to be bigger but, later on, not so much…
