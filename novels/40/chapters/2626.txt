“Tian He,” Ji Yao said calmly, “Stand behind Ancestral Founder.”

“Yes!” Shi Tian He didn’t say any more, hurriedly ducking behind the impostor Ancestral Founder that was Yang Kai.

At that moment, the people pursuing them could be clearly seen, just as how the waves of their Emperor Qi could be clearly felt. The group, however, was slightly different from what Shi Tian He had expected. While the leader was indeed a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master, most likely, Profound Thunder Pavilion’s Pavilion Master Bai Yu, he was only followed by four First-Order Emperor Realm cultivators instead of five.

Yang Kai recalled that there had been a fellow named Yan Qing accompanying the Young Pavilion Master Bai Lu, who had his arm wasted in one strike by him. That Yan Qing was probably also an Elder of Profound Thunder Pavilion, and Yang Kai surmised that he was still recovering from his injuries at the moment, and thus unable to come along.

Even so, Profound Thunder Pavilion had sent out almost all of their Emperor Realm Masters, which showed just how important Yang Kai and Ji Yao were to them.

*Shua shua shua…*

With the sound of rushing wind, five figures came to a stop some distance away from Yang Kai and Ji Yao.

Their leader was fair-skinned and beardless, bearing some resemblance to Bai Lu. He was probably the Profound Thunder Pavilion’s Pavilion Master, Bai Yu.

Two middle-aged men and two elderly men made up the other four. Their expressions were impassive yet stern, gazing menacingly towards Yang Kai’s group.

“The leftmost one is Serenity City’s City Lord Yan Dong, and the other three are Elders of Profound Thunder Pavilion,” Shi Tian He conveyed to Yang Kai, “Senior, you and Third Martial Aunt need to be careful.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

“So, you are Bing Yun’s Third Disciple, Ji Yao?” The leader Bai Yu suddenly shouted. He did not know Ji Yao’s identity because he had seen her before, but because people had heard Shi Tian He address her as Martial Aunt Ji Yao when they were at Serenity City’s gates.

“How dare you refer to Honoured Master by name!?” Ji Yao snapped through gritted teeth, her beautiful eyes filled with anger.

“Hahahaha!” Bai Yu laughed scornfully, “Even Bing Yun has hidden herself inside Ice Heart Valley with her tail between her legs, not daring to come out. Yet her Disciple here has quite the temper. I wonder where you get the guts to wander about the Northern Territory!”

The four people behind him also laughed mockingly, and it was clear from their attitudes that they were confident in beating Yang Kai and Ji Yao.

It was not at all strange for them to be so confident; after all, Bai Yu was a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master, just like Ice Heart Valley’s First and Second Elders, An Ruo Yun and Sun Yun Xiu.

As the Third Disciple, Ji Yao’s cultivation was at best also Second-Order Emperor Realm, equal to Bai Yu.

If they were to battle, Bai Yu did not fear her in the slightest. Not to mention, he also had four First-Order Emperor Realm Masters with him. When it was time, they just had to take care of Yang Kai first before ganging up on Ji Yao, and there would not be much that she could do against them.

“Honoured Master, I want to tear his mouth off and rip his corpse into ten thousand pieces!” Ji Yao was evidently incensed, as her chest heaving in anger.

“Alright, go on. Leave the others to me,” Yang Kai nodded.

At his command, Ji Yao’s slender form immediately leapt above Bai Yu and she launched a barrage of attacks at him with her sword.

“Arrogant slut!” Bai Yu roared, reaching out and summoning a long spear into his hand. He channelled his Emperor Qi into his spear and instantly deflected Ji Yao’s attacks before sending a wide sweep towards her. Ji Yao’s expression remained unchanged as, with a flourish of her sword, she met his attack head on.

The two of them were immediately entangled in a fierce battle, with Emperor Qi surging and Principles colliding as they fought.

As he was battling Ji Yao, Bai Yu shouted to the others, “Go kill the other two and then come assist me!”

“Yes!” At his order, Yan Dong and the three Elders were immediately on the move, spreading out to surround Yang Kai and Shi Tian He.

“Madame Dong…” Yan Dong’s gaze fell coldly on Shi Tian He as he said, “I really didn’t expect you to be a disciple of Ice Heart Valley. What lengths have you gone to in order to conceal this from me, the City Lord?”

Shi Tian He grit her teeth, “I was expelled from Ice Heart Valley a hundred years back, so I don’t count as a disciple anymore.”

Yan Dong chuckled, “Still, you once belonged to Ice Heart Valley. I heard you’re also An Ruo Yun’s disciple?”

“So what if I am?”

Yan Dong sighed and said, “Many years back, when I was still touring the world, I had become acquainted with a disciple of Ice Heart Valley. That person… She was clear as ice and pure as jade, with a lovely face and a sharp mind, much like Madame Dong. I greatly admired her, yet my feelings went unrequited. That woman thought I wasn’t good enough for her, and it was such a regrettable thing that even now, I feel quite heated when I think of it.”

“There was such a romantic encounter in City Lord Yan’s past?” One of the Profound Thunder Pavilion’s Elders could not help but chuckle, “This is news to me.”

“Indeed, if that woman had accepted City Lord Yan back then, then you would’ve been dragged down for the crime of associating right now. Luckily, City Lord Yan is blessed with good fortune!” Another Elder laughed.

Yan Dong waved a hand dismissively, “This all happened many years ago, don’t laugh at me. Still, even though such a long time has passed, I still remember that woman was named Yu Dan. I wonder if you know her, Madame Dong?”

“Senior Sister Yu Dan?” Shi Tian He was astounded, “You actually know Senior Sister Yu Dan!”

From her expression, it was evident that she knew this Yu Dan too.

Yan Dong chuckled, “As expected, you know her because you were both An Ruo Yun’s disciples. Good, very good!” He nodded repeatedly as he spoke before a dangerous glint flashed across his eyes.

The Profound Thunder Pavilion Elder who had not spoken up until then looked thoughtfully at him, then asked, “City Lord Yan, you’re not thinking of making up for that past regret now, are you?”

Yan Dong smiled, “Why can’t I?”

The others were taken aback by his words. Then, the same Elder commented, “City Lord Yan has unique tastes indeed. This Madame Dong… Has been married for many years, you know?”

“I’m very fond of charming and beautiful women. Besides, she was Sister Disciples with Yu Dan. Since I can’t get the Senior Sister, then it’s not too bad to have some fun with her Junior Sister instead. Now then, when you, Elders, are attacking later, please be a little more careful to not hurt her.”

The Profound Thunder Pavilion Elders had no idea what to say to that, but they knew that Yan Dong bore a grudge in his heart for what happened in the past. If he could get Shi Tian He today, then he could resolve that grudge. Thinking this wouldn’t be any extra trouble, they all nodded and agreed, “Since City Lord Yan has said so, then of course we have to comply.”

Yan Dong chuckled, “Many thanks in advance.”

Shi Tian He’s face was crimson with embarrassment as she shouted furiously, “Yan Dong, I never thought you could be so despicable and shameless! To think Dong Hai spent all these years doing your bidding and obeying your orders!”

“Dong Hai?” Yan Dong coldly snorted, “Why bring up that dead man? Rest assured, he didn’t cherish you, but I’ll make sure to cherish you thoroughly in the future.”

“Dead… man…” Shi Tian He’s pretty face went pale, and she cried out, “What did you do to him?”

Yan Dong smiled coldly, “He was the Dong Family Patriarch, yet he married an Ice Heart Valley disciple, what do you think happened to him? Now that he’s been ripped into ten thousand pieces by me, the Dong Family is no more.”

Shi Tian He’s slender form trembled as she was completely stunned.

Even though she already knew that nothing good would happen to the Dong Family after her identity was exposed, when she actually heard the news, she still found herself unable to accept it immediately.

That was the man who had been her husband for a hundred years, the man she had been willing to leave her Sect for, and now… Just like that, he was dead.

“I’ll kill you, you vile beast!” Shi Tian He’s eyes reddened, gripping her sword in her hand and drawing up all the strength she had as she prepared to charge at Yan Dong.

But before she could even move, she felt a light tap on her shoulder and was instantly frozen in place, completely unable to move. If not for Yang Kai’s Emperor Qi supporting her as well, she would have most likely fallen out of the sky right then.

Yan Dong looked coldly at Yang Kai, and snorted, “Little brat, your own death is upon you, yet you still want to stick your nose into other people’s business?”

Yang Kai grinned, “Are you all really so confident that you can kill me?” As he spoke, he pulled Shi Tian He behind himself and made sure she had a firm footing.

He looked so calm that it made Yan Dong and the three Elders frown a little, wondering where he was getting all his self-confidence from.

They knew Ji Yao’s identity but had absolutely no idea who this man was, or what kind of power he held. That made them rather wary of him.

“Just who may you be? Right now, within the Northern Territory, Ice Heart Valley is hated by all and will be destroyed any day now. If you’re a smart man, you shouldn’t get involved in this mess!” Yan Dong said, looking coldly at Yang Kai.

“Indeed, if you can find your way back from this wayward path, it’s not impossible for us all to be friends!” One of the Profound Thunder Pavilion Elders said, nodding his head.

“Friends like you people… Are a little too far beyond my reach, I’m afraid.” Yang Kai grinned, “Let’s just get to the actual fight, shall we?”

“What are you dawdling for? Hurry up and deal with him!”

Just then, Bai Yu’s furious yell was suddenly heard.

His allies quickly turned their heads towards him, and they could not help but look alarmed when they realised that Bai Yu, a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master, was actually clearly on the losing side of the battle. An ice-cold domain had spread through the air, filling up a large region as Bai Yu struggled to fend off Ji Yao’s attacks, his face looking a little pale.

From the looks of it, he could not hold on much longer.

The others were all shocked as they realised they had underestimated Ji Yao’s strength.

Though she was also a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master, she was far more powerful than Bai Yu.

“If you don’t go and help out soon, your Pavilion Master’s going to die,” Yang Kai smiled as he looked at them while also letting out his Emperor Qi with the intention of showing his cultivation, “Rest assured, I’m not that strong, just a First-Order Emperor Realm. Don’t be afraid now, you can all come at the same time!”

“First-Order Emperor!”

“So, he’s just a First-Order Emperor!?”

“What the Hell!? A mere First-Order cultivator dares to pretend he’s some big shot to intimidate me!?”

Yan Dong and the three Profound Thunder Pavilion Elders all started yelling. They were wary earlier, because they were afraid that Yang Kai had a higher cultivation than them. That was why they did not dare to attack recklessly and had originally intended to probe his strength before doing anything. What they did not expect was for him to reveal everything himself.

What was there to fear from a First-Order Emperor Realm Master? The four of them were all First-Order Emperors as well. Even if one of them could not match him alone, they couldn’t possibly be outmatched if they all attacked together.

“Go!” One of the Elders shouted, and in the next moment, the four of them were lunging at Yang Kai, Emperor Qi surging as they each attacked with their Secret Techniques, full of confidence in their swift victory.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com
