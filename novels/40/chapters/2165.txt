“You, kill me?” Xiao Bai Yi sneered fiercely, “Shameless boasting!”

“Brother Xiao Bai…” Yang Kai spoke earnestly and eloquently, “I believe it best to calm down and carefully search for another way out of this damned place…”

“No need, before you came, I searched this place thoroughly. Between you and I… there can only be battle!” Before Yang Kai could finish speaking, Xiao Bai Yi interrupted him coldly, “To be honest, with your strength, being able to defeat Xue Yi and snatch his spot was already quite surprising. You do have the qualifications to enter the Four Seasons Realm… But this Xiao is a disciple of Azure Sun Temple, and Xue Yi’s Senior Brother, so I cannot stand back and watch him be bullied. Junior Brother Xue’s grievance from that day will be avenged today by this Xiao. However, you may rest assured, given the difference in cultivation between you and I, this Xiao will not use his full strength. Sixty percent will be enough, and… if possible, I won’t kill you!”

As soon as these words fell, Xiao Bai Yi slashed his sword towards Yang Kai’s head, sending out a dazzling blast of Ice Attribute Sword Qi.

Yang Kai grinned in response and said, “Since this battle is inevitable, I ask Brother Xiao Bai to not take offence for what happens next!”

Saying so, the place where Yang Kai stood was covered in sword light and his body was pierced through, but oddly, no blood flowed out and the faint smile on his lips remained.

Xiao Bai Yi’s expression changed drastically as he pushed his Source Qi madly, creating a swirling snowstorm around himself while quickly lifting up his sword and condensing a giant sword light onto it, which he slashed out violently.

In the direction he slashed, Yang Kai’s figure appeared strangely, but instantly disappeared once more.

*Hong…*

The giant sword wave stirred up the surrounding aura as Xiao Bai Yi stood in place, his eyes darting around, tracing Yang Kai’s flickering figure.

“As I thought, you’re a little strange, it was no fluke that you beat Xue Yi!” Xiao Bai Yi quickly said.

Yang Kai smiled slightly, “Brother Xiao Bai, was that sixty percent of your power just now? If so, I advise you to use your full strength as soon as possible, otherwise…”

“Don’t worry, that was only thirty percent just now!” Xiao Bai Yi said proudly.

“Thirty percent…” Yang Kai murmured before nodding lightly and saying with some admiration, “As expected of an elite from Azure Sun Temple, you’re vastly different from the Dao Source Realm cultivators I’ve faced before!”

“It’s not too late to admit defeat now!” Xiao Bai Yi exhaled lightly as he lifted his sword once more, gathering sword light onto its blade before stabbing it out towards Yang Kai’s chest.

This thrust was fast, accurate, and ruthless, inspiring Ice Principles around it as it flew forward, causing a thin layer of frost to cover the stage. At the same time, any icy chill filled the air, once that caused all within its range to shiver slightly.

“Ice Principles!” Yang Kai commented as he felt these Principles began to affect his movements. The space around him became solidified, forcing him to release his Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi to restore his freedom while also summoning the Myriads Sword into his hands.

With a wave of this broadsword, Yang Kai shouted, “Myriad Sword Arts, One Man As A Mountain!”

A thousand blades of Sword Qi fell from the sky like a waterfall, blocking Xiao Bai Yi’s incoming attack.

“That Emperor Artifact again!”

Amidst the clash of sword lights, Xiao Bai Yi coldly snorted as he did not try to dodge the incoming wave and instead pushed his own Sword Qi harder, attempting to smash through this curtain-like defence.

*Chi chi chi chi…*

The wall of sword light from the Myriads Sword was pierced through, leaving Yang Kai exposed.

*Hu…*

Xiao Bai Yi’s figure reappeared suddenly, his eyes flashing a sharp light as an astonishing aura burst from his body and he swung his sword towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai grinned fiercely and moved his own sword to parry this blow.

With a clang, a fierce shockwave burst out and the space above the battle stage collapsed as tiny blades of Sword Qi splashed out and disappeared in a flash.

Xiao Bai Yi’s figure froze up for a moment, but he quickly escaped from the suppression of the Emperor Artifact, leaving behind an afterimage as he swiftly cut towards Yang Kai’s from a dead angle.

Even now, he had the spare capacity to shout, “Although an Emperor Artifact is strong, just how much of its power can you exert with your cultivation? Xue Yi’s defeat at your hands was due to his own carelessness!”

Yang Kai responded like a fierce dragon, wielding his Myriads to block all assaults as he smiled and said, “Brother Xiao Bai seems to have a lot of opinions about this sword!”

Even as the two talked, their movements did not slow down, the clashing of metal adding a kind of grating music to their conversation…

“Hmph, is relying on the power of an artifact something impressive?”

“If that’s what you think… I can change swords!” As soon as Yang Kai’s voice fell, the Myriads Sword in his hand suddenly disappeared and was replaced by a Dao Source Grade Mid-Rank sword.

Xiao Bai Yi frowned as he withdrew from the engagement, speaking in a cold tone, “Changing your weapon mid-battle, what are you trying to say…”

“It’s nothing really,” Yang Kai tilted his head and looked at him. “I just don’t want you to complain after I win that you only lost because I used my Emperor Artifact!”

“Are you looking down on me?” Xiao Bai Yi was so angered that his white robes began fluttering despite there being no wind. Slowly rising up into the air, he spat coldly, “If you change back now, I will pretend I never say anything, if not, it will be too late to regret it.”

As he spoke, he pointed his sword towards the sky. Suddenly, a swirling blizzard appeared, one that rapidly grew in intensity as it released Heaven destroying energy into the surrounding, overlapping with Xiao Bai Yi’s explosive momentum.

A cold, indifferent voice called out from inside the blizzard as Xiao Bai Yi shouted, “This is sixty percent of my strength. If you can’t block it, you’ll die! I advise you to withdraw!”

Having delivered his warning, he shouted, “Mortal Sword, Swirling Destruction!”

The vortex blizzard suddenly condensed into a swirling Ice Dragon that flew out with unstoppable force towards where Yang Kai stood.

Yang Kai finally straightened his carefree expression upon facing this technique. Feeling the power contained in this killing move, he couldn’t help commenting, “As expected of Azure Sun Temple’s second strongest disciple, Brother Xiao Bai lives up to his name. If this is just sixty percent of your strength, Brother Xiao Bai’s full strength must be even more astonishing…”

Although he was offering praise, Yang Kai’s hands did not remain idle. Lifting his sword, Yang Kai’s expression became solemn as he murmured, “Three Thousand Sword Dao, Flowing Flames Raging Fire!”

Instantly, Yang Kai’s sword turned crimson red, and as he thrust it out, a giant Firebird manifested from it, its figure identical to Liu Yan’s Firebird form. With a piercing cry, the Firebird and Ice Dragon met head-on.

*Hong Hong Hong…*

The Ice Dragon evaporated while the Firebird was annihilated.

Xiao Bai Yi was forced back a few steps as he uttered a low voice, “How is that possible?”

Staring at Yang Kai in a state of shock, he asked in a solemn tone, “What is the relationship between you and Senior Chen Wen Hao of Heavenly Martial Holy Land?”

As an elite disciple of Azure Sun Temple, Xiao Bai Yi naturally knew about Chen Wen Hao. The Three Thousand Sword Dao was a Sword Art that Chen Wen Hao had spent his lifetime comprehending, but now it was being displayed by Yang Kai.

Although the technique Yang Kai executed seemed slightly different, it was still incredibly powerful.

“None really!” Yang Kai flicked the sword in his hand and replied casually, “I just fought him once, and after witnessing his Three Thousand Sword Dao, I thought it was a pretty good technique, so I tried using it.”

Yang Kai was telling the truth…

When he was being corrupted by the Demon Spirit that day, he had really fought Chen Wen Hao. In fact, not only did he fight Chen Wen Hao, he also fought Gao Xue Ting and Feng Ming. Each of those three Emperors had executed their finest techniques, so they were naturally still fresh in Yang Kai’s mind, allowing him to gain some slight comprehension of them.

However, the Three Thousand Sword Dao Yang Kai displayed at this moment took a completely different form from Chen Wen Hao’s due to their different comprehensions. In order to display this technique, Yang Kai had used his Fire Sword Qi from his Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi and Liu Yan’s form as a basis while the Three Thousand Sword Dao only served as a type of reference to execute the technique.

How could it be that easy to understand an Emperor Realm Master’s Sword Art? Only another Emperor could be able to slowly comprehend and display this Sword Art’s complete prestige.

However, this was more than enough to deal with the current situation. Xiao Bai Yi had only heard about the Three Thousand Sword Dao and had never witnessed it personally, so how could he judge whether Yang Kai’s technique was real or not?

“Enough!” Xiao Bai Yi yelled, enraged, “There should be a limit to shamelessness! Spouting such nonsense, who do you think will believe you? No matter what relationship you have with Senior Chen, nothing can save you today!”

His aura suddenly climbed, seemingly feeling that sixty percent of his strength wasn’t enough to win against Yang Kai. Xiao Bai Yi was now determined to use his full strength.

*Chi chi chi…*

Flashes of lightning suddenly emerged from Xiao Bai Yi’s body, and soon the battle stage was transformed into a terrifying storm of thunder and lightning.

“Even after comprehending Ice Principles, you can also use a Thunder Attribute Secret Technique?” Yang Kai was extremely surprised, “Brother Xiao Bai is really quite extraordinary. In time, you will certainly be an overlord in the Star Boundary!”

“Flattery is useless! Xiao Bai… Xiao Bai… happily shouting that damned name over and over again… Earth Sword, Falling Thunder!”

Lightning gathered at the tip of Xiao Bai Yi’s sword from all around before he slashed down and unleashed a torrent of violent arcs that submerged the place where Yang Kai stood. The power of this Falling Thunder was both sharp and violent, seemingly completely sealing off the surrounding space, leaving no path of escape.

Yang Kai’s heart moved as he shouted loudly, “So that’s how it is… It’s all because being called Brother Xiao Bai makes you feel so uncomfortable…”

As soon as these words fell, Yang Kai was wrapped up in a sea of lightning and a burnt smell soon filled the air.

Xiao Bai Yi blinked as he stared down from above, frowning as he declared, “Remember, my name is Xiao Bai Yi!”

“I just thought… calling you Brother Xiao Bai would be more cordial. Brother Xiao doesn’t need to be so angry, right?” Yang Kai’s voice leisurely responded from below, as if he wasn’t experiencing the slightest hardship.

Xiao Bai Yi’s eyes bulged as he gawked at the sight below him.

Inside the sea of lightning, Yang Kai’s whole figure seemed to have undergone a tremendous change. On the surface of his body, a five-coloured radiance that carried with it an aura of all five primary elements had appeared and was resisting the swirling lightning. At the same time, both his hands were now covered in a layer of golden scales, making them more closely resemble dragon claws.

Even on the exposed parts of Yang Kai’s skin, golden scales which exuded an intimidating aura had appeared.
