“Brother Yang, please accompany me to Azure Sea Palace. With my Old Ancestor around, you’ll be sure to achieve great success in the future!” Yan Luo passionately invited him.

Yang Kai put on a faint smile, “Patriarch Yan, many thanks for your invitation, but I don’t intend to join Azure Sea Palace. We’ll part ways now, and let’s hope that we won’t meet each other again.”

When Duan Mu Qi, who was whispering something to Chen Chui Ling, heard that, his gaze darkened. He had no regard for Yang Kai whatsoever. The reason he came with Yan Luo to help him out this time was that they were on good terms. As for the grudges between the Yan Family and this young man, he couldn’t care less.

However, he had never expected that the young man would reject joining Azure Sea Palace, and it was apparent that the latter had no respect for his Sect. Displeased, he uttered, “Boy, Azure Sea Palace is one of the great forces in the Ancestral Domain. Most cultivators wouldn’t have a chance to join us even if they wanted to. Now that you’re given a chance, you’d better appreciate it. If you miss it, you might regret it in the future.”

Without uttering a word, Yang Kai shook his head slowly.

Duan Mu Qi’s expression darkened as he snorted, “What an ungrateful brat!”

[How dare a bumpkin from the Lower Star Field be so arrogant in front of me!]

Thinking so, he released his Dao Source Realm aura in an attempt to pressure Yang Kai.

Seeing that, Yang Kai almost burst out laughing.

Duan Mu Qi was just a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, so where did his sense of superiority come from? How could he dare act so haughty in front of an Emperor Realm Master? If Yang Kai unsealed all of his cultivation pressure right now, everyone present would immediately be forced to their knees.

“Duan Mu Qi, what are you doing?” Just then, another Dao Source Realm aura silently clashed with Duan Mu Qi’s and neutralised it. The person was a muscular man whose face also oozed masculinity, he appeared to be a forthright character, and since his cultivation was the same as Duan Mu Qi’s, he wasn’t afraid of him, “Don’t you know the rules? Are you trying to snatch him by force?”

“That’s right. He’s expressed his unwillingness to join Azure Sea Palace, so why are you still harping on about it? Follow the customs, otherwise, he might despise all of us in the Ancestral Domain.”

“Come on, young lad. You don’t have to be afraid of him. Not joining Azure Sea Palace is a wise choice, they have nothing worthy of note. Why not join my Holy Mountain Peak? Your future will be bright with us, and you’ll receive many benefits.”

“Nonsense, you should come to Nine Stars Palace. As long as you’re talented enough, I guarantee that you’ll reach the Dao Source Realm within ten years!”

“Haha, Little Brother, rather than those stuffy places, you should join Elder Sister’s Yin-Yang Sect. As long as you join us, you can take home one of our Senior Sisters or Junior Sisters. Moreover, the lady behind you is as beautiful as a peach blossom. Just the lovely countenance of her face proves that she is perfectly suited to cultivate our Sect’s Secret Arts.”

…

He Yun Xiang was dumbstruck. She watched dazedly as these people in a realm above the Origin King Realm invited Yang Kai and her to join their respective Sects.

[Are they all really in the realm above the Origin King Realm? Where’s their majesty? Where is their aloofness?] He Yun Xiang felt like she was a wealthy woman with a lot of cash who had accidentally stepped into a food market, causing all these people to call out to her passionately to hock their wares.

[What’s going on? Why are they so hospitable? Something must be amiss.]

In just a short moment, these Masters had all invited them to join their forces, more than a dozen of them at once.

After everyone else had made their appeals, an old man with a smoking pipe approached them, but he walked up to He Yun Xiang instead of greeting Yang Kai. Then, in a serious manner, he stuffed something into her hands and said in a low voice, “Come join Eternal Life Pavilion. As long as you can make a single contribution, there will be many more of these in your future.” The old man seemed to be taking an indirect approach. As long as he could persuade the woman beside Yang Kai, he was sure that Yang Kai would join them.

Lowering her head, He Yun Xiang took a look at her palm and saw a familiar-looking Spirit Pill.

[Isn’t this a Source Condensing Pill?] She had consumed a lot of Source Condensing Pills recently, so she was familiar with it and could recognise it at first glance. However, the pill in her hand appeared inferior to those given to her by Yang Kai. The pill wasn’t as fragrant, its size was small, and the colour appeared dull. Apparently, it was poorly made.

At that instant, she realised that those Source Condensing Pills given to her by Yang Kai were in a realm of their own, so the pill in her hand wasn’t comparable to them.

She was torn between tears and laughter, but at the same time, she grew more confident in Yang Kai. Judging from this pill alone, she was certain that the heritage of these people wasn’t comparable to that of Yang Kai.

On the nearby hill, Azure Sea Palace’s Duan Mu Qi and the two people from the Yan Family were extremely displeased. Yan Luo was especially anxious because he thought that he could rely on his Old Ancestor to teach Yang Kai a lesson after he arrived in the Ancestral Domain so that Yang Kai would understand the consequences of offending the Yan Family. However, he didn’t expect such an unforeseen event.

He understood what the Old Ancestor was wary of, as the latter couldn’t possibly make a move on Yang Kai in front of all these Masters.

If Yang Kai joined another Sect, then it would be hard for them to retaliate against him in the future, so he turned to look at his Old Ancestor in hopes he would have a solution. Unfortunately, Yan Ren Hao just shook his head, which hinted that he was powerless to do anything as well.

Yan Luo clenched his fists in resentment as he couldn’t get the fury off his chest.

“Everyone, many thanks for your kind invitations,” Yang Kai cupped his fists and put on a faint smile, “But I apologize as we do not intend to join any great force at the moment.”

All of them fell silent in an instant and stared at Yang Kai as though the latter was a fool.

The alluring lady from Yin-Yang Sect uttered in a small voice, “Little Brother, I don’t know what grudges you have with those from the Yan Family, but if you don’t seek refuge now, it will be hard for you to move around in the Ancestral Domain in the future.”

The old man with a smoking pipe also whispered, “A wise man should be able to adapt to his circumstances. As a man, you should know when to yield. It doesn’t matter if you take a step back temporarily to take two forward later.”

Yang Kai still shook his head, “Again, many thanks, but we have made our decision.”

He Yun Xiang immediately passed the pill back to the pipe-smoking old man. Since she wasn’t going to join his Sect, she didn’t feel right accepting this reward.

The pipe-smoking old man, however, waved his hand, “Since it is fate that brought us together today, just take it as a gift.”

He wouldn’t mind giving her a single Source Condensing Pill as he could just treat it as an investment, possibly making them change their minds in the future.

He believed that after He Yun Xiang took the pill, she would definitely want to join his Sect.

“Farewell,” Yang Kai said and walked away with He Yun Xiang who hurriedly summoned a flight type artifact and boarded it together with him. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared from everyone’s sight, leaving these people sighing in the same spot.

Yan Luo nearly failed to contain his laughter. [He has basically just refused the easy way out and headed to Hell instead. He could have joined a great force and left this place safely, but he’d chosen to walk into a dead end. Isn’t he trying to induce me to retaliate against him? Certainly, I wouldn’t let this chance slip through my fingers.]

Then, he traded glances with the Old Ancestor as they understood what was on each other’s minds.

Yan Ren Hao uttered, “Senior Brother Duan Mu, we should probably forget it. Let’s go back to Azure Sea Palace.”

“Good.” Duan Mu Qi played along and nodded his head. Then, he hurled a small boat forward, upon which it expanded along with the wind and transformed into a flying ship that could accommodate five to six people.

The four people from the Azure Sea Temple then boarded the boat and rose into the air, after which they headed in the direction Yang Kai had left without trying to hide their intentions.

“That boy…”

“He’s basically asking for death.”

“I think he must be out of his mind.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I don’t think so. Everyone coming from the Lower Star Field is haughty because they were overlords in their respective homes. Now that you want him to join a great force and work under someone else, it’s expected that he’s not willing to do so. Certainly, there’s nothing wrong with his brain since he has cultivated to this point. It’s just that he thinks too highly of himself. I guess he’ll have to suffer a few setbacks before he’ll face reality.”

The others present agreed with such sentiments, because that was the path that many of them had gone through before, so they understood that it was important to adjust their mentality. It meant nothing that someone was able to rule over a Star Field, only if they could gain a solid footing in the Ancestral Domain would they be considered powerful.

[Unfortunately, it seems that he won’t live to see the sunrise tomorrow.]

“That poor girl…” The woman from Yin-Yang Sect heaved a sigh. She didn’t exaggerate when she said that, given He Yun Xiang’s alluring face, it was suitable for her to cultivate Yin-Yang Sect’s Secret Art. Before she could promise her any benefits or show her the Yin-Yang Sect’s power and heritage though, she had already left this place, making this woman quite displeased with that young man.

Nevertheless, she didn’t want to bother about it anymore since the young man was about to lose his life.

…

The view around them was quickly flowing past them as Yang Kai and He Yun Xiang took in the Ancestral Domain’s magnificence while riding her artifact.

The World Energy here was indeed more abundant than any place in the Star Field, but it still wasn’t comparable to the Star Boundary. There was a large difference between the two. Moreover, Yang Kai could feel that the World Principles here weren’t as perfect as those of the Star Boundary.

In other words, Dao Source Realm was probably the limit in the Ancestral Domain while it was practically impossible for anyone to reach the Emperor Realm here.

If the incident earlier hadn’t happened, He Yun Xiang would’ve been more than happy to enjoy the splendid view around her; however, she wasn’t in the mood to do so now as obviously there were multiple auras relentlessly tailing them.

She didn’t even need to give it a thought to know that they must be those from Azure Sea Palace and the Yan Family duo. She wanted to ask Yang Kai about his plan, but she gulped down her words in the end. In her heart, she consoled herself that there was nothing to be afraid of. Since Yang Kai was so confident, he must have a way to deal with them.

“Cultivators from their respective Star Fields who have managed to come here are all top talents, so their futures are naturally bright. That is why those from the Ancestral Domain were waiting at that portal to invite us to join their forces,” Yang Kai suddenly said something puzzling.

He Yun Xiang replied in shock, “Is that so?”

“Why do you think they’ve been staying there? Isn’t it better for them to meditate and cultivate if they have the time?”

He had a similar experience in the past. After he entered the Star Boundary, he was taken in by Bian Yu Qing.

However, it seemed that Ancestral Domain and Star Boundary were slightly different in a way. There were no fixed entrances to the Star Boundary. After he passed through the Starlight Corridor, he landed in a random place. However, judging from what happened earlier, he could see that the entrances to the Ancestral Domain were fixed.

That seemed to be a fixed passageway that connected the Ancestral Domain and the Star Fields, which gave those people a chance to keep watch in that place.

Yang Kai even felt that he could open the passageway in reverse and return to Unending Star Field.

The discovery made him excited. If he could find the corridor that connected to Heng Luo Star Field, he would be able to return to his homeland.
