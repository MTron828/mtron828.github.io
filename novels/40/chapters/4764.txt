After a short wait, several figures passed by overhead. Their Divine Senses surged as they searched for any suspicious traces.

Yang Kai frowned slightly, [Why are there Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters mixed among this team? Aren’t they looking down on me a little too much? How can I tolerate this!?]

Thus, he rose straight into the sky and sped towards the group of four!

Among those four people, two were Sixth-Order and two were Fifth-Order. They were spread out in an awl formation to search their surroundings.

All of a sudden, a violent aura swept towards them from below like a tsunami and they immediately turned pale from shock.

Before they could get a clear grasp of the situation, Yang Kai had already charged straight into their ranks like an arrow released from the string. An overwhelming World Force swept outward at the same time.

The two Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were instantly slammed by the impact. Their figures swayed and staggered unsteadily like small boats caught in the middle of a storm. When they hastily stabilised their figures and looked over, they saw that one of their Senior Brothers in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm had been punched in the chest. The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master immediately coughed up fresh blood, and his complexion turned pale.

[Isn’t that... too harsh?] Although they could tell that this punch would not endanger the life of their Senior Brother, injuries were inevitable.

The Senior Brother who was punched in the chest tried to fight back, but the attacker punched him again and again. After that, he dropped out of the sky like a broken paper kite. The World Force lingering around his body also became incredibly chaotic. That was a clear sign that his Small Universe had been shaken violently.

A powerful Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master instantaneously lost all combat capability. It could be seen that the attacker’s strength was horrifying indeed!

The reaction of the other Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was not slow. He quickly blasted various Divine Abilities and Secret Techniques at the enemy, but he was not in time to change the fate of his comrade. Watching his Fellow Brother collapsing to the ground immediately flooded him with a mixture of fear and rage. Hence, he did not dare to hold back his strength whatsoever.

Be that as it may, his efforts were in vain. In less than ten breaths, he too screamed in agony and followed in the footsteps of his comrade.

Standing in the void alone, Yang Kai looked absolutely dominant. All of a sudden, he turned around to look at the two Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. Both of these two immediately turned pale as they felt like the abyss itself was staring at them!

“Run!” One of them shouted. Then, they immediately split up to the left and the right as if they had discussed it in advance. Even their two Senior Brothers in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm were not Yang Kai’s opponents, so how could two Fifth-Order Masters like them possibly resist? At this point, their only option was to escape. Nevertheless, how could they manage that?

Yang Kai raised a hand and slapped his palm towards the two Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters as though he was swatting at mosquitoes.

A short while later, Yang Kai happily stood in front of the four battered people and said with deep concern, “Your injuries are terrible!”

The four of them were speechless. [Why are you mentioning the obvious? Besides, who gave us these injuries? I can’t believe he is shedding crocodile tears and pretending to be concerned! What a jerk!]

Even though their hearts were filled with grief and resentment, their strength was certainly incomparable to the other party; therefore, there was nothing they could say in return. They never imagined that a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master could have such terrifying strength. It could be said that today they witnessed an eye-opening sight indeed.

One of the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, who seemed to be the group’s leader, coughed lightly and spoke, “Junior Brother Yang, your skills are amazing and your heritage is extraordinary, we admit defeat!”

Admitting defeat meant that they would be eliminated from this training event, and the chance to enter the Five Lights World for training would have nothing to do with them anymore. Although it was a pity, there was no helping it since they were weak.

As Lang Ya Paradise disciples, they had their own pride; therefore, they admired Masters like Yang Kai to a certain extent.

“My respects!” Yang Kai cupped his fist. Then, with a flip of his palm, a jade bottle suddenly appeared in his hand and he smiled and said, “This Yang has some good healing pills. Please give them a try!”

While speaking, he gave a flick of his wrist and four Spirit Pills flew out, stopping in front of these four.

The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master who spoke earlier nodded lightly, “Many thanks!”

He thought that Yang Kai took out these healing pills due to a sense of guilt for hurting them, so he did not think too much about the other party’s intentions. They each stuffed one Spirit Pill into their mouths without a second thought.

“Hmm? This healing pill is pretty good!” He raised his brow in surprise.

One of the other Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters added, “The taste is also quite nice...”

Yang Kai suddenly reached out his hand, “That will be one set of Sixth-Order materials or items of equal value!”

“W-Wha…?” The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was taken aback.

Yang Kai’s expression became grim, “What’s wrong? Are you refusing to pay after buying something from me? Senior Brother, are you planning to rob me? This Yang might be alone, but I am not easy to bully!”

The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was confused, “What did I buy from you?”

[Besides, who bullied who? It’s obvious that the four of us were bullied by you!]

The other Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master looked at Yang Kai with a strange expression and asked hesitantly, “Junior Brother Yang, you can’t be referring to the healing pill, right?”

“What else could it be?” Yang Kai responded matter-of-factly.

The group of four were rendered speechless for a time, but in the end the first Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master eventually asked, “Junior Brother, were these healing pills not a gift?”

Yang Kai glanced sideways at the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, “When did I ever say I’m giving them to you? This item is extremely valuable. I was planning to sell it from the start!”

[A single healing pill is extremely valuable? There should be a limit to acting shameless!]

“Hurry up now! Even Senior Brother Zhao and the others bought this healing pill at this price, so you are no exception. This Yang has always been reasonable and fair when doing business!”

The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was stunned, “Even Senior Brother Zhao bought this Spirit Pill?”

Yang Kai nodded, “En! The Gongsun siblings also bought a healing pill each from this Yang. If you don’t believe me, you can contact them and ask. I’m sure you have each other’s contact information, right?”

Judging by his expression, he did not seem to be lying. The two Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters questioned in their hearts. [Could it be that Senior Brother Zhao, Senior Brother Gongsun, and Senior Sister Gongsun really bought these healing pills? How can the Senior Brothers and Senior Sister tolerate something like that?]

“Ahem, wait a moment please!” The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master who started speaking first took out a Communication Bead. His Divine Sense surged as he tried to contact the other party.

“Senior Brother Zhao, this Junior Brother has a question!”

“Oh? Junior Brother Yu? What is it?”

Yang Kai claimed that you bought a healing pill from him. Is that true?”

There was no reply from Senior Brother Zhao.

“Senior Brother Zhao? Senior Brother Zhao, are you still there?”

“I’m here!”

“Is this true?”

“Uhh... That’s the gist of it!”

[What does he mean by ‘That’s by the gist of it’?] Junior Brother Yu could not understand the meaning behind Senior Brother Zhao’s words. Just as he was about to ask more questions, Senior Brother Zhao sent another message, “You should just buy the healing pill, Junior Brother Yu. Exchanging money to avoid disaster is better than being hung on a tree and put on display for all the Junior disciples to see. You can earn more wealth if it is lost, but you can never pick up your face if you lose it.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

[Hung on a tree?] In the midst of his confusion, he saw that Yang Kai had taken out a bare tree trunk that was a couple dozen metres tall at some point in time. Moreover, Yang Kai would occasionally glance over at them while fiddling with some rope, as though trying to figure out the most convenient way to hang them from the tree.

He couldn’t help shuddering in fear and quickly replied to the message, “Many thanks, Senior Brother Zhao! Please recuperate well, Senior Brother Zhao. This Junior Brother will visit you later!”

“You should recover from your injuries first!”

Putting the Communication Bead away, Junior Brother Yu looked at Yang Kai speechlessly. Then, he smiled bitterly and said, “Junior Brother Yang, you sure are good at doing business!”

Yang Kai looked proud, “Of course! How else could I have provided for my family if I was not? Have you understood the situation, Senior Brother?”

Junior Brother Yu nodded. Even Senior Brother Zhao had admitted defeat, so what else could he do? Helpless, he could only bring out resources that were worth a set of Sixth-Order materials and give them to Yang Kai.

Seeing this, the other Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master could only do the same.

Yang Kai happily received the resources, then he turned around to look at the two Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters.

Those two nearly burst into tears!

One of the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters that looked older said, “Senior Brother Yang, even if I gather all of my wealth, I don’t have that much! I haven’t swallowed the Spirit Pill. Why don’t I return it to you!?”

After saying so, he spat out the Spirit Pill onto his palm and tremblingly handed it back to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s expression darkened, “It’s all covered in your spit now. Who would want this? This Yang does not have a policy of accepting returns for goods I have sold!”

The Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master wailed, “But, Senior Brother Yang, I really don’t have that much wealth! This healing pill of yours... I simply can’t afford it!”

Ordinary Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters would be considered extremely wealthy if they had resources worth a few tens of millions of Open Heaven Pills in reserve; after all, they needed to cultivate constantly, so it was hard to retain any balance after buying cultivation resources.

Although a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master from a Cave Heaven or Paradise would be in better condition and have more wealth than average, it was still impossible for them to have over 100 million Open Heaven Pills worth of resources just lying around. That was the wealth that belonged only to Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters and above.

“That’s right, Senior Brother Yang! We are not trying to deceive you!” The other Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master joined in.

Yang Kai sighed, “I know you are not lying to me, and I also believe that you don’t have that much wealth. But, if you don’t have enough yourself, I’m sure you can borrow some...”

While speaking, he shot a sharp glance to the two people standing beside the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters.

All four of them were shocked! [Can you really do that!? Isn’t that a little too much!?]

“I don’t have much time. If you’re not willing to pay up, then I won’t force you either; however, I can’t say what kind of consequences you will face as a result!” Yang Kai quickly said when he saw that those two Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were hesitating.

The younger Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master asked weakly, “Dare I ask, Senior Brother Yang, what are the consequences?”

Yang Kai grinned, “Have a guess!”

Although Yang Kai did not say anything specific, both of them had an extremely ominous feeling. If they did not buy this healing pill, something very bad would be waiting for them.

The older Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master said, “Senior Brother Yang, our cultivation is not as high as our Senior Brothers. We are only in the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm. Can you... lower the price of this healing pill?”

“You get what you pay for, no? What does this have to do with your cultivation!?” Yang Kai glared.

[Don’t you feel embarrassed saying ‘you get what you pay for’!? Where in this world would you find such an expensive healing pill!?] Despite the retorts in their hearts, they did not dare to say a word. The two Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters glanced towards the two Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters hesitantly, “Senior Brothers, these Junior Brothers are in trouble. Please help us, Senior Brothers!”

The two Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were having a headache. Unfortunately, things had already reached this point. In order to settle this matter, they could only provide a loan to their Junior Brothers. They could not watch without doing anything as Yang Kai hung their two Junior Brothers up on the tree like an offering to the Heavens, right?

“Many thanks for the generosity!” Yang Kai kept his things and smiled brilliantly, “Please focus on your recovery. I won’t disturb you any longer.”

After saying that, he turned and left!

Not long after Yang Kai departed, Senior Sister Zhou, who was dressed in fiery-red robes, rushed over with a group of people. She was shocked to see the four of them with bruised and swollen faces. Not to mention, they looked as depressed as grieving widows, “What happened to you?”

The older Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master wept bitterly, “Senior Sister Zhou, why did you only come now...”

“What happened?” She asked with a frown.

Junior Brother Yu sighed, “Yang Kai wounded us, then forcibly sold us a healing pill each!”

Senior Sister Zhou was livid, “How dare he do something like that!?”

However, thinking about it again, it seemed plausible. When she went to cause trouble for him previously, he had not held back either. If that was the case for a woman like her, it only went to show Yang Kai’s brutal nature.
