The Bone Devouring Clan was one of the four strongest Ancient Barbarian Clans and even had a Shaman Saint assuming command. The Bone Devouring Clan was also the cruelest and most violent of all the Clans.

Before the invasion of the Demon Race, no Barbarian Clan was willing to start a conflict with the Bone Devouring Clan, even though everyone hated this Clan and did not want to recognize them as a part of the Barbarian Race.

But it was undeniable that the Bone Devouring Clan played a great role in this war to resist the invasion of the Demon Race. The entire eastern front line was braced by the Bone Devouring Clan who marched forward step by step, slowly reclaiming most of the lost lands while slaying countless Demons.

The Bone Devouring Clansmen had proved the unyielding spirit and bravery of the Barbarian Race, and their ferocity and penchant for violence became an excellent weapon at this time. Many Masters of the Demon Race learned of their existence and always paid close attention to their movements.

Cang Er Mountain Valley was one of the fortresses of the Bone Devouring Clan, and there were more than a hundred thousand clansmen here, including five Shaman Kings. It was one of the most important locations to the Bone Devouring Clan, as well as to the whole Barbarian Race, because it was near the frontlines of the warzone.

Since the Bone Devouring Clan garrisoned more than a hundred thousand troops here, it had fought with an army of Demons hundreds of kilometres away more than six times. The Bone Devouring Clan won more times than it lost, achieving a remarkable record and results in the war.

However, for some unknown reason, the Demon Race seemed to be a lot quieter these past few months, resulting in some idleness in the Bone Devouring Clan.

But today, the whole Cang Er Valley became lively. Almost all of the hundred thousand Barbarians had gathered at the centre of the valley to look at the newly built stage with scorching excitement.

The clansmen of the Bone Devouring Clan would only show such an expression when they saw the most delicious and novel food.

On the high stage was a thick wooden stake to which a tall figure was bound using various Shamanic Spells. There were complex and strange patterns engraved on the stake and from time to time, lightning would burst from those patterns like a torrent and flow through the bound figure. The tall figure would twitch from the electrocution, looking miserable, as if he was suffering tremendous pain.

All the clansmen in the Bone Devouring Clan looked at the tall figure with exhilarated faces, and some even licked the corners of their lips occasionally. If not for knowing the true identity of this person, perhaps someone would have already rushed up and torn a piece of flesh out of this man to taste it.

It was a Demon King! A powerful Demon King!

It was captured by several of the Shaman Kings of the Clan, and although the Bone Devouring Clan had no taboo on cannibalism and in fact had practised it frequently for many years, no one dared to have the same thought for a Demon King.

No one knew whether they would be corrupted by the Demon Qi and turn into a Demon if they took a bite of the Demon King‚Äôs flesh, but this ‚Äòworry‚Äô still could not suppress their inner curiosity and desire.

The more they thought about it, the more they wanted to taste the Demon King‚Äôs flesh and wondered what would happen to them after eating him.

But it was pointless for those ordinary clansmen to fantasize because a Shaman King was standing beside the Demon King.

That person was Yang Kai‚Äôs ‚Äòold acquaintance‚Äô, Shaman Chi!

Shaman Chi held a dagger made of unknown material in his hand, his face filled with a ferocious and crazy expression. He took the dagger and sliced the Demon King‚Äôs flesh again and again, his bulky hands moving with extreme precision. With each slice, only a thin piece of flesh was cut, no more, no less.

Many clansmen in the Bone Devouring Clan were quite particular about eating people alive because, for these people, fresh meat was more delicious than dead, rotten meat. If they could enjoy the struggling and crying of their prey in the process of their feast, it would undoubtedly be the most enjoyable meal.

As one of the strongest among them, Shaman Chi was particularly fond of this practice.

Bao Qi remained indifferent when the first piece of his flesh was sliced off, simply standing there glaring at Shaman Chi coldly, as if the slice of meat did not belong to him. As a Demon King, he naturally possessed strong willpower and sufficient determination. Back then, he also only submitted to Yang Kai because he was forcefully branded by a Soul Imprint and had no way to resist it. ViiSiit nùíêvelbùíä/n(.)c/(ùíê)m for lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvels

He was not afraid of this Shaman King‚Äôs tricks.

But Bao Qi knew too little about the Bone Devouring Clan.

When Shaman Chi excitedly put the piece of meat into his mouth, revealing an ecstatic look after devouring it, Bao Qi‚Äôs face finally changed.

It was nothing to cut his bones and flesh off, but Shaman Chi‚Äôs practice of eating his flesh raw was obviously beyond Bao Qi‚Äôs expectation. He watched as his own flesh was munched noisily in the mouth of the Shaman King. Even in the Demon Race, this was not a common practice.

More than a hundred thousand clansmen of the Bone Devouring Clan stared eagerly at Shaman Chi, gulping down their own saliva. They were yearning to know whether the flesh of a Demon King was delicious, or how it was different from those they had eaten before.

The euphoric look on Shaman Chi‚Äôs face did not fade as it seemed that he was enjoying the best food in the world with his eyes closed.

After a while, he gulped down the chewed meat, and shouted, ‚ÄúDelicious!‚Äù

The clansmen jumped in excitement, and cheered crazily, as if hot chicken blood was flooding their veins.

Shaman Chi turned to Bao Qi with a grim smile, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt die so easily. A Demon King is such a rare catch, you have to let all our clansmen taste your flesh before you perish!‚Äù

Bao Qi‚Äôs face twitched slightly.

Although he did not make a precise head count, he knew that there were at least a hundred thousand Bone Devouring Clansmen standing here. In other words, this Shaman King would need to cut more than a hundred thousand slices of his flesh before he would be allowed to die.

A Demon King‚Äôs resilience was incomparably strong, so even if he did have a hundred thousand pieces of flesh sliced from his body, Bao Qi would not die; however, it was obvious that such torture would bring him long and unbearable pain.

Shaman Chi grinned and cut off another piece of Bao Qi‚Äôs flesh before throwing it out and shouting, ‚ÄúThis is the punishment for your Demon Race. Our Bone Devouring Clan will devour all your clansmen, so that you will never dare to set foot in our territory again!‚Äù

That thin piece of flesh was thrown into the crowd, which immediately led to chaos. Many of the Bone Devouring Clansmen fought for the piece of flesh, and finally it landed in the hands of a particular female clansmen. She stuffed it into her mouth without hesitation before crouching down while holding her head down, enduring the beating of the other clansmen, shouting excitedly the whole time, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tasty. So tasty!‚Äù

‚ÄúSee? These are the clansmen of our Bone Devouring Clan. Your Demon Race is nothing!‚Äù Not only did Shaman Chi not mind about the riots below, but instead he grinned proudly.

Bao Qi was silent. If he stood in the position of the Demon Race, he would refute Shaman Chi with a few words, but he had long been subdued by Yang Kai, so although he was a Demon King, he had been working for the Barbarian Race.

Sadly, he was caught by these other Barbarians and had to die by a hundred thousand cuts. It was not that he did not try to explain, but no one in the Bone Devouring Clan believed him.

‚ÄúEndure, you must live on!‚Äù Shaman Chi raised his dagger again, ‚ÄúYou cannot die too easily. You are a Demon King after all; don‚Äôt disgrace your Demon Race!‚Äù

Another piece of flesh was sliced off and thrown into the crowd by Shaman Chi, causing another riot.

After that, Shaman Chi sped up his actions. He did have good technique and the rate at which his dagger flashed, slicing off pieces of flesh, was almost faster than the eye could see. With each new morsal, the crowd would be stirred up into a frenzy as the Bone Devouring Clansmen competed for the prize.

In less than half a stick worth of incense, half of Bao Qi‚Äôs arm was gone, exposing his white bones. During this period, he suffered at least three thousand cuts.

Even if he was a powerful Demon King, he could not help shaking as cold sweat dripped from his forehead and he clenched his teeth tightly to endure the severe pain.

Several tens of metres away, from where more than one hundred thousand clansmen of the Bone Devouring Clan gathered, twenty thousand people were watching quietly. These people were obviously different from the Bone Devouring Clan, because they appeared to be detained. They were surrounded by some Masters of the Bone Devouring Clan, and any unusual movement would lead to a beating.

These people were the clansmen of the Shaman Niu Clan, led by the twins, Yue and Lu. They looked at the wooden stage, and many had an unbearable look on their faces.

They all knew that Bao Qi had submitted to Yang Kai, and the former had contributed a lot in many previous victories. Although the clansmen were unable to recognize him as their companion due to his identity as a Demon, they had still once fought side by side.

At the moment, many of them could not bear to see Bao Qi suffer such torture. It was just the blink of an eye to kill a person, but the practice of the Bone Devouring Clan Shaman King was too cruel.

Yue walked towards a Bone Devouring Clan Shaman Grandmaster, stood behind him and gritted her teeth as she shouted, ‚ÄúI want to speak to a Shaman King!‚Äù

The Shaman Grandmaster turned around, looked at her, and sneered without answering.

‚ÄúI must speak to your Shaman King!‚Äù Yue bellowed again.

The Shaman Grandmaster looked at her coldly, ‚ÄúGo back!‚Äù

Yue did not move and continued, ‚ÄúBao Qi is a subordinate subdued by Sir Shaman Niu. He is now working for our Barbarian Race. You can‚Äôt kill him!‚Äù

The Shaman Grandmaster sneered, ‚ÄúHe is a Demon King. A Demon king can‚Äôt be subdued by Shaman Niu. You‚Äôve all been deceived by him.‚Äù

‚ÄúSir Shaman Niu will explain everything. Please release him first. When Sir Shaman Niu comes, you will understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúShaman Niu?‚Äù The Shaman Grandmaster smiled with disdain, ‚ÄúWho is that? I have never heard of him.‚Äù

‚ÄúSir Shaman Niu is the Shaman Grandmaster of our South Barbarian Clan. He‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúSouth Barbarian Clan?‚Äù The Shaman Grandmaster pretended to take her seriously for a moment and showed a sudden realization, ‚ÄúBut the South Barbarian Clan perished!‚Äù

‚ÄúSouth Barbarian Clan has not perished. We are still here!‚Äù Yue gritted his teeth as she bellowed.

‚ÄúThe South Barbarian Clan has not perished!‚Äù A group of people shouted from behind, all looking outraged. They stood behind Yue one after another and glared at the Shaman Grandmaster.

It had been a month since the appearance of the Black Brilliance and word of the destruction of hundreds of thousands of people from the South Barbarian Clan had spread widely. Everyone in the Shaman Niu Clan naturally knew about this, and although they may be the only group left in the South Barbarian Clan, as long as they lived, the South Barbarian Clan would never die.
