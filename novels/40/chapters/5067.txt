Gui Liao shot him a glance, “What’s wrong? Are you not happy with it?”

Liu Zi An quickly said he wouldn’t dare to, but he was evidently unresigned.

In the past, he had done everything he could to defend the Humans. After he was corrupted by Black Ink Strength on the battlefield, he sacrificed a part of his Small Universe; therefore, when he became a Black Ink Disciple, his Small Universe was incomplete.

Then, it took him 300 years to gain enough contributions on the battlefield before Gui Liao gave him a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit to repair his Small Universe.

The treatment he had received was totally not comparable to what Yang Kai could enjoy now, which was why he was unresigned; however, he wouldn’t dare to express his true feelings in front of Gui Liao now.

Upon seeing his expression, Gui Liao snorted, “You heard what Zha Gu said earlier. That guy is strong. That’s why Sir Territory Lord regards him highly. How are you comparable to him?”

A sense of haughtiness flashed across Liu Zi An’s face, “We’ll only find out about it after he and I fight.”

Gui Liao said impassively, “He’s Sir Territory Lord’s Black Ink Disciple. If you really dare to do anything to him, Sir Territory Lord will not let you off when he’s done recuperating.”

Liu Zi An grinned, “Don’t worry, Master. I’ll only teach him a lesson when there’s a chance. It’s not like I’ll kill him. I won’t make things difficult for you.”

Gui Liao nodded, “Good, just don’t go too far.” After giving it a thought, he shook his head, “Actually, you’d better not complicate the matter. Even though Sir Territory Lord is recuperating in the Black Ink Nest, he’ll come out one day.”

Liu Zi An frowned, “Do we give him a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit just like this?”

Gui Liao sneered, “Sir Territory Lord only ordered me to get him a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit. As for when I’ll find one, that’s up to me. I’ll also see if he’s tactful enough before I’ll decide whether I’ll give it to him.” He tapped on the table, “I guess he’ll look for you again. I’m sure you know what to do then.”

“I get it, Master. Don’t worry about it,” Liu Zi An replied respectfully.

“You may leave now,” Gui Liao waved his hand, then Liu Zi An left the place.

Yang Kai cultivated silently in his room. More than 10 days later, the Profound Yin Spirit Fruit was still nowhere in sight.

Logically, there should be all sorts of resources in the Territory Lord’s territory. When he came to this place with Hei Yuan, he witnessed the prosperity firsthand. Even though Profound Yin Spirit Fruits were rare, the demand for them among the Black Ink Clan should be far smaller than that among the Humans, so there should be a reserve of them in the castle.

Moreover, Hei Yuan had given the order in public, and Yang Kai had asked Liu Zi An to help him ask Gui Liao about it; hence, Gui Liao should’ve sent a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit to him by now.

Yang Kai felt that something was off as he still hadn’t got his hands on a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit up until now. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

After giving it a thought, he decided to look for Gui Liao and ask about it.

Yang Kai directly stopped him and asked, “Excuse me, where is Sir Gui Liao?”

The Black Ink Clansman was startled for a moment as he swept a glance over Yang Kai with surprise. It had to be noted that Black Ink Disciples were lowly slaves in the Black Ink Clan’s territory and had to be subservient whenever they saw any Black Ink Clansmen. It was the first time this Black Ink Clansman came across a Black Ink Disciple who dared to stop him like this.

However, he soon recalled that this Black Ink Disciple was personally corrupted by Sir Territory Lord, so he was unlike the other Black Ink Disciples. He supposed that was the reason this Black Ink Disciple was this audacious.

While suppressing his fury, he shook his head, “I have no idea.”

Upon finishing his words, he stopped responding to Yang Kai and left.

With no other choice, Yang Kai went on to ask several Black Ink Clansmen about it, but none of them knew where Gui Liao was. Perhaps they were aware of Gui Liao’s whereabouts, but they just were not willing to tell him.

This made Yang Kai furrow his brow.

Since he was unable to find Gui Liao, how was he supposed to ask about the Profound Yin Spirit Fruit?

After giving it a thought, he decided to release his Divine Sense to scan the entire castle.

The powerful Divine Sense swept across the castle like a tide, which prompted everyone in the place to react.

There were many Feudal Lords in the castle, so it was only natural that they were furious at Yang Kai who had the gall to scan the place with his Divine Sense.

Nevertheless, Yang Kai retracted his Divine Sense a brief moment later. Before the Feudal Lords could counterattack, his Divine Sense had returned to him.

During the momentary inspection, he was unable to detect Gui Liao’s aura. It seemed that those Black Ink Clansmen were not lying when they said they didn’t know where Gui Liao was.

After pondering on it for a moment, he headed in a particular direction.

A moment later, he arrived at a courtyard where there was a restriction set up. He directly flicked at the restriction and caused a layer of ripples to spread.

Soon, the restriction was turned off. After the door was opened, Liu Zi An’s furious-looking face came into Yang Kai’s sight.

It wasn’t because of luck that he found Liu Zi An’s residence. When he scanned the castle with his Divine Sense just now, the restriction in this place was triggered. For a brief moment, Liu Zi An revealed his aura to ascertain what was going on. That was how Yang Kai found out his whereabouts.

“Brother Liu!” Yang Kai took a step back and cupped his fist.

Fury was written all over Liu Zi An’s face. Upon seeing Yang Kai, he snapped, “It’s you! I was wondering who had the gall to do such a thing.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “I’m sorry, but I had no other choice.”

“What’s wrong?” Liu Zi An asked in a grim voice.

Yang Kai nodded, “There’s something I need to ask you about.”

After thanking him, Yang Kai entered the courtyard with him.

As he looked around, he arched his brow. This courtyard was definitely much better than the room assigned to him by Gui Liao as it was more suitable for Humans to live in. It was apparently because Gui Liao regarded Liu Zi An highly.

On the other hand, even though Yang Kai was Hei Yuan’s Black Ink Disciple, he wasn’t close to Gui Liao. That was the reason Gui Liao didn’t give him the same treatment and settled him down in a random room.

Even if Hei Yuan found out about it, he wouldn’t be displeased; however, it showed how little Gui Liao cared about Yang Kai.

There was only a table and a chair in the courtyard. Liu Zi An directly took a seat.

Yang Kai stood in front of him and looked around. He felt as if he was here to report to him regarding work-related matters.

“Whatever you have to say, just say it,” Liu Zi An said impatiently.

With a smile, Yang Kai fished out a chair from his Small Universe and took a seat across from Liu Zi An before replying, “Brother Liu, I’m here to ask you about the matter I had mentioned previously. Is there any update?”

Liu Zi An shot him a glance, “What matter are you talking about?”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, “Are you playing dumb, Brother Liu? I had only mentioned one thing.”

He felt frustrated in his heart. The last time they met, he already realised that Liu Zi An was haughty and aggressive, but there wasn’t much hostility between them. However, this time, he could feel that Liu Zi An was hostile towards him. He wondered what had happened as Liu Zi An also spoke in a weird tone.

In any case, both of them were Black Ink Disciples, so what was the point of him acting standoffish? Moreover, he had previously asked him to inquire about the Profound Yin Spirit Fruit, but the latter played dumb now.

Although he didn’t need the Profound Yin Spirit Fruit, Yang Kai had to get his hands on it to cover up the secrets in his Small Universe; hence, he was determined to obtain the fruit.

An unfazed Liu Zi An remained seated and said impassively, “Are you talking about the Profound Yin Spirit Fruit?”

Yang Kai nodded, “You finally recalled it.”

Liu Zi An replied, “I asked Sir Gui Liao about it on your behalf, but he didn’t say anything. It’s not up to me to influence Sir’s decision.”

Yang Kai knitted his brows together, “Where is Sir Gui Liao, then?”

Liu Zi An snorted, “This Liu is a Black Ink Disciple under Sir Gui Liao. Since he’s the Master, it’s not like he has to tell me where he’d go whenever he heads out. How am I supposed to know where he is?”

Yang Kai was rendered speechless as he had the urge to summon Azure Dragon Spear and kill him.

Upon noticing the gloomy expression on the other man’s face, Liu Zi An changed the topic by saying, “Brother Yang, do you remember what I told you previously?”

Yang Kai replied, “You told me many things at that time. Which one do you mean exactly?”

Liu Zi An grinned, “Since you’ve forgotten about it, this Liu will tell you one more time. The Black Ink Clan and the Human Race are not so different. You just have to get along with everyone. If you need someone’s help, you can obtain it by being on good terms with them.”

Instantly, Yang Kai appeared to be in a dilemma, “Brother Liu, I only have a small number of Open Heaven Pills. I gave you half of them, so I’m left with very few now.”

Liu Zi An snorted, “No one is coveting your pathetic number of Open Heaven Pills.”

A puzzled Yang Kai asked, “What do you want then, Brother Liu?”

Liu Zi An replied impassively, “It’s not what I want. I have no say when it comes to the Profound Yin Spirit Fruit.”

Upon realising his meaning, Yang Kai leaned closer and asked in a small voice, “What does Sir Gui Liao want, then?”

This guy had been beating around the bush in order to make Yang Kai understand that he had to gain Gui Liao’s favour. It was up to Gui Liao to make a decision regarding the Profound Yin Spirit Fruit, and Liu Zi An was Gui Liao’s Black Ink Disciple. Yang Kai was certain that Liu Zi An must have gotten Gui Liao’s permission to do all this.

[So, he’s waiting for me to take the initiative to contact him.]

Yang Kai finally understood why Gui Liao didn’t immediately give him the Profound Yin Spirit Fruit even though it was Hei Yuan’s order. He hadn’t expected that there was such a practice in Black Ink Clan.

He thought that it was a terrible inconvenience.

Then, he went on to say, “Brother Liu, I’m sure you’re aware that I have nothing valuable with me. I’m worried that I can’t give Sir Gui Liao anything he would want.”

Liu Zi An put on a meaningful grin, “Don’t worry, you have plenty of what Sir Gui Liao likes the most.”

Upon finishing his words, he started sizing Yang Kai up. Yang Kai’s expression slowly turned cold as he narrowed his eyes, “Please make it clear to me, Brother Liu.”

It had come to a point where there was no longer a need to beat around the bush.

Liu Zi An said, “I’m sure you know that Black Ink Clansmen are able to consume World Force. This doesn’t just help increase their power, but it’s also a kind of hobby for them. Sir Gui Liao’s hobby is slightly different from others, though I suppose it’s not accurate to say that. Perhaps many Black Ink Clansmen have this hobby. They love consuming fresh World Force.”
