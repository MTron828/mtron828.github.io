“Piercing Light, Nine Frozen Heavens!” The middle-aged man was a decisive person, so seeing that there was no room for negotiation, he decided to strike first. Swiftly summoning a snow-white sword into his hand, he held it up and condensed a frigid light around it, one that seemed capable of penetrating deep into one’s Soul and freezing the world around it.

The complexions of the disciples of Eight Paths Sect changed slightly as they hastily retreated. Obviously, they understood how powerful this move was.

Qin Zhao Yang hurriedly grabbed Qin Yu and retreated with her while the Qin Family guards and servants also cleared out in an instant, not wanting to get involved in this fight.

Sword Qi swirled and with a flick of his wrist, the middle-aged man surrounded himself in sword light and charged straight towards Yang Kai, freezing the air he passed through into ice.

“Hahahaha!” Yang Kai stood on the spot, grinning mockingly as he stared down his approaching opponent with utter contempt, not even attempting to dodge.

Seeing Yang Kai acting so confident and arrogant, the middle-aged man could not help feeling stunned as a faint unease filled his heart.

“How dare a small fly like you act so presumptuous in front of this Young Master!” Yang Kai’s grin turned into a sneer and with a flicker, he disappeared. The next instant, he reappeared right in front of the middle-aged man and stretched out a finger towards him.

On the tip of his finger was a flash of golden light, one condensed from extremely dense and pure Source Qi.

*Dang...*

With a soft ring, the middle-aged man’s face changed wildly as he froze mid-air, his eyes bulging as he stared in horror as his full-powered strike was blocked by his opponent’s finger.

Even more horrifying was that Yang Kai’s finger, made of flesh and blood, was completely unharmed despite it clashing with a sword artifact. In fact, looking closely, it was the middle-aged man’s sword that appeared to be dented from this clash.

As the middle-aged man stood flabbergasted, his sword gave a final tremble before the ice-cold aura surrounding it finally dissipated.

“How can that be?” The middle-aged man exclaimed, his eyes threatening to pop out of their sockets.

He released his Divine Sense once again to investigate Yang Kai’s cultivation, but he could only sense he was a First-Order Dao Source Realm Junior, a Minor Realm lower than himself. However, this power shown by Yang Kai was definitely not what a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator should have.

Yang Kai’s mind-boggling abilities completely left him at a loss as he felt he was now in deep trouble.

“Luo Yuan was one thing, but you’re not my opponent!” When Yang Kai snorted coldly, the intensity of the Source Qi on his fingertip suddenly increased drastically, releasing a golden flash of light as it shot forward.

“You know Junior Brother Luo?” The middle-aged man trembled as he stared at Yang Kai in amazement. All of a sudden a realisation dawned on him as he exclaimed, “You’re Yang Kai! Yang Kai from the Four Seasons Realm!”

He seemed to finally recall something and yelled in surprise.

As soon as this shout rang out, the golden light swallowed him, and the middle-aged man screamed in agony as he was shot out and smashed into the ground, opening up a giant pit inside of which he writhed in pain.

“Yang Kai?”

“The same Yang Kai from the Four Seasons Realm?”

“Yes! It’s him! It’s definitely him! No wonder he looked so familiar!”

Nearby, the disciples of Eight Paths Sect all yelled in panic.

It was only at this moment that they finally recognized Yang Kai, who outsmarted and overpowered all the Southern Territory’s geniuses with his Extraordinary Treasure Pills in the Four Seasons Realm. During the incident in Four Seasons Realm, while Yang Kai was carrying out his exchange, some of them had been watching from a distance.

They did not dare to get too close because Luo Yuan was already present at that time, and therefore, it took them until now to recognize his face.

It was not until the middle-aged man’s realization that everyone else realized Yang Kai’s identity.

At once, all of them paled and began leaking cold sweat.

Although they had never fought against Yang Kai, they knew what happened in the Four Seasons Realm.

Even rising stars like Wu Chang, Luo Yuan, and several others were unable to touch a single hair on Yang Kai’s, so it need not be mentioned what their chances were.

The most recent opening of the Four Seasons Realm had been the debut of two new rising stars. One of them was Luo Yuan from their Eight Paths Sect, who was an equal match against Wu Chang of Heavenly Martial Holy Land, a genius whose strength could not be underestimated.

The other was Yang Kai.

Possessing only a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation, he was also a Dao Source Grade Alchemist who had refined the Extraordinary Treasure Pills and toyed with all the masters in the Four Seasons Realm like they were children.

It was safe to say that even if the reputations of these two rising stars weren’t on par with those of Xia Sheng, Wu Chang, and Xiao Chen, they were not far behind.

This was also the reason that while other small families in Maplewood City were hosting disciples from two or three Sects, the Qin Family only hosted Eight Paths Sect.

Because of Luo Yuan, the cultivators from other Sects dared not to provoke them. Luo Yuan wasn’t even afraid of Wu Chang. In this world, besides Emperor Realm Master, who else would he fear?

“Hai hai...” The middle-aged man from Eight Paths Sect was knocked over by Yang Kai but did not suffer any mortal injuries, so he stood up quickly as he coughed and looked over at Yang Kai in fear, gritting his teeth as he cupped his fists “This one had failed to recognize Grandmaster Yang! Please do not take offence!”

His cultivation was higher than Yang Kai’s, and he was also older than Yang Kai, so addressing Yang Kai as Senior or Sir would be too humiliating to himself; however, concerned that Yang Kai would be displeased if addressed him as brother, the middle-aged man settled on calling him ‘Grandmaster’. In any case, the other party was a Dao Source Grade Alchemist, so it wasn’t an inappropriate title.

“What?” Qin Zhao Yang was shocked as he stared at the middle-aged man, amazed at how this man could be so arrogant before but changed his attitude so quickly and was addressing Yang Kai so respectfully in a blink of an eye, even calling him ‘Grandmaster’...

There was a strange light glimmering in Qin Yu’s beautiful eyes as it seemed she was thinking of something.

“What’s so strange...” Yang Kai grinned.

“Grandmaster Yang, please be forgiving...” The middle-aged man smiled.

Yang Kai changed his tone, and said coldly, “Is there a need to be forgiving with a dead man?”

The smile on the middle-aged man’s face froze as a chill crept up his spine. Hurriedly, he said, “Grandmaster Yang, what happened today is indeed my Junior Brother Lin’s fault...”

“Of course he is in the wrong!” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

“But please, Grandmaster Yang, please consider that Junior Brother Lin has learned his lesson and give him a chance to repent!” He pleaded earnestly.

“A life for a life. I only knocked him out just now, and you call that a lesson?” Yang Kai sneered sarcastically, “Are the lives of others only worth this much to you?”

Sweat beaded on his forehead as he saw Yang Kai’s unrelenting posture. Gritting his teeth, the middle-aged man painfully and anxiously said, “Just so Grandmaster Yang knows, Junior Brother Lin Yun... is the nephew of Vice Sect Master, Lin Rui!”

He brought up Lin Rui, in hopes that Yang Kai would be aware of the dangers of pushing the situation further and would thus spare Lin Yun’s life. However, Yang Kai just snorted, “Lin Rui? What thing is he? Why should I care what he thinks!”

The middle-aged man turned pale, realizing that matters would not end well today.

“In any case, I will have to kill someone today, it can either be you, or that guy over there who fainted,” Yang Kai flicked his wrist and summoned the Myriads Sword into his hand. Instantly, the air filled with Emperor Pressure as the Emperor Aura sword rippled with intimidating energy.

Lifting the large Myriads Sword towards the middle-aged man, Yang Kai shouted, “You choose!”

As he spoke, he raised the corner of his mouth slightly and sneered, “Would you like to die in place of that guy? Since he’s the nephew of your Vice Sect Master, if you die for him, perhaps your precious Vice Sect Master will take good care of your family after you’re gone!”

“This, this... I, I, I...” The middle-aged man backed away as he babbled incoherently, trembling at the mere sight of the Myriads Sword in Yang Kai’s hand. Although he had never seen an Emperor Artifact before, he knew that this great sword was an extraordinary weapon. He also knew that Yang Kai was not joking. The murderous intent in Yang Kai’s eyes was clear and unmistakable. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

However... Although Lin Yun held great status in Eight Paths Sect, how could he be willing to die in his place?

“If you refuse to choose, I’ll decide myself,” Yang Kai snorted lightly before he turned to Qin Zhao Yang, “Patriarch Qin, they killed one of your clan, I will consider it as revenge for the clan by using the Qin Family’s artifact for the execution, is that alright?”

“Absolutely!” Qin Zhao Yang shouted heavily, “Please go ahead, Brother Yang!”

Yang Kai nodded lightly and he lifted up the Myriads Sword, just as he was about to perform a strike though, his expression changed and he turned his eyes towards the sky and curled his lips, “Since you’ve come, you should just show yourself, why bother hiding?”

“There’s someone else?” Qin Zhao Yang’s complexion changed as he quickly looked in that direction, but saw nothing, becoming somewhat suspicious.

A moment later, a wave of ripples appeared in the void and two figures suddenly appeared.

It was a man and a woman, the man was a youth with a cold, aloof face, as if everything and everyone was beneath him. The woman was petite and cute, with a round face. She stood quietly behind the young man, her beautiful eyes were always on his back, as if there was nothing else in the world apart from him in her world.

“It’s him!” Qin Zhao Yang’s expression turned gloomy.

He immediately recognized this man and woman as the lead disciples of Eight Paths Sect and the one who brought this middle-aged man and the other disciples of Eight Paths Sect to the Qin Family.

Since the day they arrived, this young man had entered closed-door cultivation and it was rumoured in the Qin Family Residence that he was cultivating frantically without even taking any time to rest.

Qin Zhao Yang also knew that this person was named Luo Yuan, one of the rising stars, just like Yang Kai, who appeared in the Four Seasons Realm.

The round-faced woman, on the other hand, seemed to be the daughter of Eight Paths Sect’s Sect Master and she was hopelessly enamoured with Luo Yuan. Since they arrived, she had been guarding his courtyard, never taking a step away. It was a pity that this was just unrequited love, however, as it was quite clear from Luo Yuan’s attitude he did not return her affection.

“Junior Brother Luo, Young Lady!” The middle-aged man was overjoyed when he saw these two people appearing, but soon he seemed to have thought of something and became horrified.

Luo Yuan glanced at him lightly and frowned, “You’re quite noisy!”

His words silenced all the members of Eight Paths Sect, their faces paling, as if they were extremely afraid of Luo Yuan.
