Yang Kai was treading through the Void like he was walking on the ground, completely ignoring the ubiquitous turbulence.

This place might be dangerous to others, but to Yang Kai, it was like a walk in his own backyard. When he first began cultivating the Dao of Space, he had entered this place countless times to sense the mysteries of Space Force, experiencing its mystical nature, so he was extremely familiar with the characteristics of this place.

Less than an hour after having separated from Lan He, Yang Kai suddenly felt a slightly hot sensation coming from the back of his hand. Naturally, it was the induction between Star Seals. His expression immediately changed as he rushed in a certain direction.

His current Star Seal was six-pointed, which could be considered a very high level, so it could sense the position of most other cultivators from far away.

After a short while, Yang Kai arrived at a certain location, but when he looked around, the subsequent sight made him frown.

Because a bloody picture was before him; countless mutilated limbs and gory pieces of flesh were floating. There was no living being in sight.

But in that place, there were eight ownerless Star Seals floating quietly.

Eight Star Seals meant that eight people had lost their lives here. They weren’t killed by anyone. Rather because they fell into the Void Crack and were either swallowed by the Void Turbulence or were slivered by the chaotic Space Principles here.

When Yang Kai came over, those ownerless Star Seals seemed to receive some kind of pull as they shot straight toward the back of his hand, transforming into specks of starlight before entering inside the Star Seal on the back of his hand. Immediately, his six-pointed Star Seal grew brighter and hotter.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but be a little worried.

Everyone was pulled in when space collapsed, their futures quite uncertain. He didn’t care about the life and death of others, the only one he was worried about was Yin Le Sheng. He shouldn’t die before Yang Kai found him, for if he did, Yang Kai wouldn’t be able to extract any information from him.

He was still getting a little response from the front.

Yang Kai didn’t stay longer and continued ahead.

The farther he went, the more dead bodies Yang Kai encountered, leaving only Star Seals in their place.

Without doing anything at all, Yang Kai had already collected more than twenty Star Seals along the way.

In other words, out of forty or so Dao Source Realm cultivators who were pulled in, about half of them had already died. And judging by what Yang Kai had observed along the way, the survivors should have all rallied together, probably wanting to go in this direction to find a way out, but unfortunately for them, they didn’t understand Space Principles and couldn’t break the barrier of space to find an exit.

In light of this, they would die sooner or later.

Suddenly, Yang Kai heard a faint shout. His eyes lit up as he quickly flew towards the source of the sound.

After a while, he came to the front of a surging Void Turbulence.

Apparently, the person, who had shouted before, seemed to have sensed Yang Kai’s arrival and hurriedly shouted, “Friend, save me, don’t leave me, please save me!”

Yang Kai remained indifferent. When he had scanned with his Divine Sense, he had already recognized who this guy was. Yang Kai also knew that the opposite party was already trapped in the Void Turbulence and would be devoured after a short while.

“Where is Yin Le Sheng?” Yang Kai suddenly asked.

The opposite party was slightly startled after hearing Yang Kai’s voice, he then asked in a low voice, “Yang Kai!?”

Obviously, he had also heard Yang Kai’s voice.

“Where is Yin Le Sheng?” Yang Kai asked again.

That man bitterly smiled and stated, “Brother Yang, please save me first, the rest we can talk about later.”

Yang Kai coldly snorted and stated, “Zhang Hao didn’t rescue you, why should I then?”

Surprisingly, this guy was none other than Brahma Holy Land’s Zhang Xian. He and Zhang Hao were the Holy Sons of Brahma Holy Land. Their cultivations were both impressive, but no matter how powerful they were, they were still just Dao Source Realm cultivators. Only death was waiting for Zhang Xian after falling in the Void Turbulence, and the more he struggled, the faster he would die. However, there was no sign of Zhang Hao here, so it seemed that Zhang Hao had abandoned him.

“Zhang Hao!” The mere mention of Zhang Hao’s name seemed to have touched Zhang Xian’s nerves and he gritted his teeth all of a sudden, snarling, “Don’t mention that scumbag’s name before me! I will kill him sooner or later!”

Who knows what happened between the two Holy Sons, but Zhang Xian seemed to hold deep hatred towards Zhang Hao.

Yang Kai didn’t care to get to the bottom of this either and just sneered, “First you have to get out of here.”

Zhang Xian’s anger suddenly hit the rock bottom as he begged, crying, “Brother Yang, someone as great and generous as you doesn’t need to care about this lowly me. If you rescue me from here, I, Zhang Xian, will always remember this gratitude and surely repay you in the future.”

“Tell me first, where did Yin Le Sheng go!” Yang Kai indifferently looked at him.

Zhang Xian asked, “If I tell you, will you save me?”

Yang Kai countered, “What do you think?”

Zhang Xian became enraged and shouted, “Then why should I tell you!?” Just as he said this, he suddenly realized that he didn’t have the room to get angry at this moment and hurriedly corrected himself, “Brother Yang, don’t be angry. I, Zhang Xian, just put a foot in my mouth.”

Yang Kai stated with a snort, “I don’t want to save you, so I won’t save you. No matter what you say, it’s useless!”

Zhang Xian flustered and the flames of fury in his heart burned hotter, but he didn’t dare to show it. His mouth was filled with bitterness as if he had eaten a bitter gourd.

“Although I won’t save you, I can avenge you!” Yang Kai sneered, “Zhang Hao and Yin Le Sheng are together, am I right? If you tell me where they went, I will help you kill Zhang Hao.”

“Kill Zhang Hao…” Zhang Xian was momentarily stunned, pondering for a long while before finally breaking into madness-filled laughter.

Yang Kai didn’t urge him and just coldly glanced at him from the side.

After a moment, Zhang Xian stopped laughing as he replied with a ferocious look on his face, “If you find Zhang Hao, rip his corpse into ten thousand pieces for me!”

“I can do that. I promise you!” Yang Kai nodded, thinking that there must be some unknown vendetta between the two Holy Sons, otherwise Zhang Xian would not hate Zhang Hao this deeply.

“They went in that direction,” Zhang Xian pointed.

Yang Kai turned to look, then nodded. He then slightly moved his hand as a Moon Blade shot straight toward Zhang Xian. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Zhang Xian was shocked. Although he felt the energy fluctuations approaching him, he was trapped in a Void Turbulence; even if he wanted to escape, he couldn’t, all he could do was ask in a shock, “What are you doing?”

With a soft squish, Zhang Xian felt a slight pain coming from his arm.

Yang Kai coldly stated, “I am taking your Star Seal. It’s the interest for previously attacking me. As for what happens next, I will leave it to luck.” While speaking, he reached out and collected the Star Seal on Zhang Xian’s severed arm before flying towards the direction Zhang Xian had previously pointed at.

“Bastard, bastard!” Zhang Xian covered the wound with his other hand as he angrily roared, a hideous look covering his face.

But Yang Kai had long disappeared.

After continuing forward for about half a day, Yang Kai finally sensed the location of other people, but most of them were already dead, pulled into the Void Turbulence. The corpses were mutilated and in pieces. Only their Star Seals remained that flew towards Yang Kai, one after another.

Another day later, Yang Kai had already collected the Star Seals of almost all of over forty cultivators.

After the six-pointed Star Seal on the back of his hand had absorbed thirty or so Star Seals, it finally changed and became a seven-pointed Star Seal, allowing him to sense others from a greater distance.

Rumour had it that if a Star Seal could be upgraded to the most advanced nine-pointed Star Seal, one could find the inheritance of Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. Who knows whether this was true or false, but Yang Kai wasn’t interested in that inheritance at all; therefore, he didn’t try to pursue it.

At some point, Yang Kai suddenly noticed the fluctuations of several Star Seals in front of him. After a little thought, Yang Kai knew that the Masters of these Star Seals were the last ones alive.

And that Yin Le Sheng must be there, because Yang Kai had found the corpses of the other two Netherworld Sect disciples, but he hadn’t found Yin Le Sheng’s.

[This guy’s life is pretty hard, he actually made it this far in the Void. How did he do it?]

Yang Kai didn’t hesitate any longer, his figure flickering as he shot towards that direction.

After the time it would take to burn a stick of incense, Yang Kai arrived at the place where these survivors were.

Scanning with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai found that only four people were still alive. Yin Le Sheng and Zhang Hao were impressively among them while the other two seemed to be the top Dao Source Realm Masters, but Yang Kai didn’t recognize them.

And it was not just those who were here. Even the Mountains and Rivers Bell that had disappeared into the Void was also here.

This exotic artifact from the Wild Lands had given rise to a Great Emperor, witnessed the war between Great Emperors, and after tens of thousands of years of silence, was now quietly lying somewhere lost in the Void. All its radiance was completely converged and it didn’t have the slightest bit of spirituality, as if it was broken. It seemed to be waiting for the arrival of its new master.

“You’re still alive!” When Yang Kai arrived, Yin Le Sheng fiercely turned around and looked at him in shock.

Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space, and Yin Le Sheng was well aware of this. When the two had fought in the Starlight Corridor, Yang Kai had used his mastery of Space Force to shatter the Starlight Corridor.

Yin Le Sheng was surprised by the fact that Yang Kai withstood the shock wave from the Mountains and Rivers Bell at such a close distance. Furthermore, it appeared that not only had he survived, but he was still brimming with energy.

Yang Kai pursed his lips and stated, “Since you are still alive, why should Brother Yin be so surprised that I am too.”

Yin Le Sheng’s eyes lit up instead as he nodded and gratefully said, “Great, awesome, it’s good that you’re alive.”

He looked like he was happy for Yang Kai, but who knows what he was really happy about.

Yang Kai suspiciously looked at him and stated, “Brother Yin, your tone might very easily cause misunderstandings. Everyone will think that we have a very good relationship.”

Yin Le Sheng burst into laughter, “No matter what the relationship between us is, it’s still great that you are alive.”

Yang Kai’s face turned cold as he stated, “I’m alive, but you will definitely die.”

Yin Le Sheng remained calm and composed as he spoke, “There is no true grievance between you and me. How about we forget our past enmity and become friends?”

Yang Kai’s eyes widened as he snapped, “This, am I… hearing it right? Brother Yin, you actually want to forget the past enmity and be friends with me? Is there something wrong with your head?”

Zhang Hao and the other two also had a weird look on their faces; after all, they had personally witnessed the clash and grievance between Yang Kai and Yin Le Sheng. Both of them couldn’t wait to kill each other, so why had Yin Le Sheng’s attitude changed so drastically in the blink of an eye?
