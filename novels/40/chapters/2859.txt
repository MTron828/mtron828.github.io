From what Sha Ya could see, Yang Kai did not seem suspicious but was genuinely curious about the Demon Heart.

Sha Ya smiled lightly and unexpectedly threw the Demon Heart to him as she instructed softly, “Be careful, don’t break it.”

Yang Kai took it over and played with it.

Yue was so nervous that she could even hear her own heartbeat. She looked at Yang Kai with expectation and temporarily forgot that he was her sister’s murderer. There was only one thought screaming in her mind now, [Crush the Demon Heart!]

If Yang Kai could crush the Demon Heart and kill the Demon King in front of him, Lu’s death would not have been in vain. If Yang Kai really did so, everything that happened earlier would have been just for show and worth it. The purpose of him joining the Demon Clan would have been just to find an opportunity to kill this Demon King. Even if Lu died because of this, she still could forgive him.

To her disappointment though, Yang Kai simply examined the Demon Heart in his hand for a long time, not showing any signs of making a move.

“What are you hesitating about? Just crush it!” Yue finally could not help crying out.

Sha Ya glanced at her with a grin, and her eyes full of ridicule.

Yang Kai tilted his head and tossed the Demon Heart back, “What now? Did you take your Demon Heart out just for me to see?”

Seeing this scene, Yue’s face immediately turned pale and she collapsed to the ground as if she had lost all her strength.

Shaman Niu really submitted to the Demon Clan, and Lu had died in vain. It was ridiculous that she still had any expectations for this coward just now, and she felt shameful to even have such an idea.

The moment Sha Ya took back her Demon Heart, she beamed and looked quite satisfied, “Of course, it’s not just for you to see.”

As she spoke, without making any actions, the Demon Heart in her hand leaked a drop of black blood that seemed to be filled with unimaginable power. Sha Ya sent the drop of blood floating towards Yang Kai and ordered with a smile, “Drink it, and from now on, you are mine.”

Without hesitation, Yang Kai drank the Demon Blood, grunting as the dark aura on his body became richer.

Sha Ya chuckled and praised Yang Kai, “You made a wise choice.”

“Many thanks for giving me this chance!” Yang Kai replied indifferently.

“Now…” Sha Ya stepped forward and looked at the chaotic battlefield. At this time, the army of the Demon Clan was about to collapse and even the prided cavalry under her command was unable to turn the tide. However, Sha Ya’s eyes did not show even the slightest fluster and instead were filled with confidence in her victory. She raised her hand and remarked, “Let’s end this ridiculous battle!”

The commander of the Barbarian Race army had surrendered to her already, so although there were many enemies left, Sha Ya was not worried at all. As long as she joined hands with her newly recruited slave, victory would not be a problem.

“By the way, I don’t know your name yet.” Sha Ya asked without looking back.

“Shaman Niu! My name is Shaman Niu!” Yang Kai replied.

As he spoke, power overflowed from his body and a golden light suddenly bloomed from his feet and shot deep into the ground. The next moment, several dull thuds rang out from below the surface.

In that instant, all the Sand Demons hidden underground were killed by Yang Kai without any chance to resist.

Sha Ya was stunned, but before she could turn around, she felt a sharp pain in her chest. Looking down, she saw the tip of a broad sword piercing through her full bosoms, spilling a copious amount of blood.

Sha Ya’s beautiful eyes quivered violently, unable to believe what she was seeing.

Yue too, exclaimed in surprise, shocked by the sudden changes in front of her eyes.

“Madam, how do you feel?” Yang Kai’s casual voice came from behind, as if he was asking her how the weather was.

Sha Ya choked a few times, and blood overflowed the corners of her lips as she questioned viciously, “How can you disobey my will after drinking my Demon Blood?”

If this was even a possibility, she would never have been so careless and rashly exposed her back to Shaman Niu.

Shaman Niu had already passed all her tests perfectly.

When she demanded he show her sufficient sincerity, he had unhesitantly captured two of his Shaman subordinates and even killed one in front of her.

Although Sha Ya had seemingly thrown her Demon Heart to him next without wariness, that too was a test. If Shaman Niu revealed his true intentions at that time, Sha Ya still had a way to resolve the situation. She would not die even if her Demon Heart was really crushed. Nevertheless, he did not show any signs of betrayal at all and simply returned the Demon Heart after examining it for a while.

If he really was planning to betray her, that would have been the best time to do it.

Therefore, from that moment on, Sha Ya truly believed him.

Drinking her Demon Blood was the last assurance, because after that, he would be under her control and she could order him to do anything while he would not have even the slightest power to resist.

That was why she confidently turned her back to him.

But what she received in return was actually a betrayal, a devastating blow. There were no previous signs of treachery, as if it was just in that moment that he decided to change his mind, but such a decisive move was obviously premeditated.

Her Demon Heart was in excruciating pain and Sha Ya could clearly feel that it had been pierced by a sharp weapon. Even as a Demon King, she could not help trembling and almost collapsed to the ground.

“Hahaha!” Instead of being angry though, Sha Ya laughed as she turned her head with some difficulty to glance sideways at Yang Kai and sneered, “In order to win my trust, you were even willing to kill one of your subordinates?”

“Everything has a price,” Yang Kai replied lightly.

Sha Ya looked up at Yue who was not far away and stated, “Did you hear that? You are just a tool in his eyes. He can sacrifice all of you when necessary.”

Yue frowned, but her emotions didn’t fluctuate much. When she saw Yang Kai suddenly attack Sha Ya, she knew that her guess was correct.

Sure enough, Sir Shaman Niu really behaved the way he did just to get close to the Demon King, even going so far as to kill her sister without the slightest hesitation.

[Was Lu’s death… not worthless anymore?]

“Don’t try to sow dissension. Don’t forget that your life is in my hands now.” Yang Kai sneered lightly.

Sha Ya continued with a resentful look, “How did you do it?”

What she could not understand was that Yang Kai was able to go against her will. In theory, after drinking her Demon Blood, all of Yang Kai’s inner thoughts would not be able to escape her perception. She would have known the moment the other party had even the slightest thought of rebellion.

However, she did not realize his ill intention until he pierced her Demon Heart. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

How could the blood of her Devil Heart not work on him?

“No comment!” Yang Kai replied, pushing his Spiritual Energy madly and engulfing Sha Ya in it in the next moment.

Sha Ya instinctively wanted to resist it, but with a slight tug of Yang Kai’s Myriads Sword, the severe pain made her give up.

A seemingly invisible whirlpool surged, and Sha Ya suddenly disappeared into the revolving vortex.

Yang Kai shook the blood off the Myriads Sword and sighed lightly.

The Shadow Demons who had been guarding Sha Ya were all dumbstruck and even now had not come out of their daze.

Yang Kai wiped the Myriads Sword with two fingers, inspiring its sword light before releasing it in all directions, causing a great spurt of blood as all the Shadow Demons were instantly killed.

Yue regained her freedom at that moment and looked at Yang Kai with a complicated expression, trying not to hate the person in front of her. However, the image of his sister’s tragic death was constantly replaying in her mind, making such a thing impossible.

“Lu isn’t dead!” Yang Kai grinned at her.

“What?” Yue was stunned, “What did you say?”

[Did I hear wrong? Or did he make some kind of mistake? Lu… Lu exploded right in front of me, how could she not be dead?]

Yang Kai tilted his head and pondered, “I thought you twins had a Heart Resonance and should be able to feel something. I didn’t expect you to be unable to sense anything. But… I suppose it can’t be helped with a World Barrier between you at the moment.”

Yue did not understand what he was talking about, but what she saw the next moment brought tears to her face.

Yue only saw Yang Kai silently waving his hand, and Lu, who was supposed to have exploded into a blood mist, suddenly reappeared in front of her.

“What I crushed was another dead body.” Yang Kai explained.

In the previous action, he turned his back to Sha Ya, so Sha Ya did not see some details clearly. The moment before he ‘crushed’ Lu, Yang Kai actually threw her into the Sealed World Bead while summoning a dead body that he had conveniently collected from the battlefield.

This was a risk, as any small mistakes would be enough to let Sha Ya see through his deception.

Fortunately, although Yang Kai was only a Shaman Grandmaster, he had the experience and methods of an Emperor Realm Master, so he was pretty proficient in this kind of little trick.

“Lu…” Yue’s eyes instantly filled with tears.

Lu was still a little confused. She did not know what happened, only remembering that Shaman Niu lifted her by her neck just now and then, in a flash, she had entered a quiet, mysterious world.

In that world, she was trapped in an empty place with an area about thirty metres wide, unable to leave. When she attempted to escape, she would immediately find herself back in her original place.

After hearing her Elder Sister’s voice though, Lu’s first reaction was to move closer before turning a vigilant look to Yang Kai.

Yue declared, “Sir Shaman Niu didn’t betray us. Everything just now was an act in order to win the trust of the Demon King.”

Lu was stunned, “That was all just an act?”

When Yang Kai grasped her neck and lifted her up, she was certain she was about to die because the emotionless look in his eyes really seemed like he was going to kill her.

Yue nodded, “Yeah, thanks to Sir Shaman Niu, that Demon King was… killed?”

Sha Ya disappeared for no reason, so Yue did not know what her fate was.

Yang Kai smiled at them and explained, “She suffered a little loss from our first two encounters, so if I didn’t find a way to win her trust, she never would have let her guard down around me. She also had the help of her Sand Demons and would have been able to escape at any time. I don’t know what other tricks she had, so I could only use this bad plan. In short, I’m sorry for frightening you two.”

The twins shook their heads together, and Yue replied, “It’s nothing, but I had some misunderstandings about Sir before…”

Yang Kai waved his hand, “It’s normal for you to have doubts in such a situation. En, enough talk we should put an end to this battle now.”
