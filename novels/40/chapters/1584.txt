Chapter 1584, You Look Down On Me Too Much

The risk was great, but by using their Monster Core, the strength a Monster Race cultivator could display would greatly increase.

Xue Lian spitting out his Monster Core at this time showed just how blinded by rage he had become, so it was no wonder Ba He and the others became panic-stricken.

Xue Lian’s identity was extraordinary, so if he used his Monster Core and still lost to Yang Kai, Blood Flood Dragon Tribal Lord would never let this matter drop. The anger of a top master no less powerful than Chi Yue could affect all of Monster Emperor Star!

On the other hand, if Xue Lian won in his crazed state, how could Yang Kai’s end be good?

How could Ba ​​He, Yu Xiong, and Shan Qing Luo simply stand by?

No matter what, they had to stop Xue Lian before he could display the power contained in his Monster Core! Only by doing this could they possibly make big things small and make small things nothing.

The movements of the trio were swift. They were only a few thousand metres from the battlefield to begin with, and with their strength, such a distance could be covered in a flash.

Ba He opened his mouth and was just about to try to act as a peacemaker, persuading the two to stop, but before he could say anything, a deafening roar resounded from Yang Kai’s body while simultaneously an overwhelming force spread out.

Even with his great strength, Ba ​​He couldn’t stop his heart from trembling at that moment.

The words he wanted to say caught in his throat as his eyes stared towards Yang Kai in utter shock.

If he wasn’t mistaken, the roar just now was...

“A dragon roar!” Inside her chamber, Chi Yue’s beautiful face paled as she instantly got to her feet and her beautiful eyes glowed with a strange brilliance, as if she had discovered something extraordinary. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Even with her Second-Order Origin King cultivation, when this roar resounded, she still felt a chill run up her spine. She was struck with an instinctive awe that had nothing to do with strength.

Chi Yue had a trace of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider’s bloodline in her, which was what allowed her to cultivate to the Origin King Realm. This was also the reason she was so optimistic about Shan Qing Luo who had actually absorbed the Source of a true Heavenly Moon Demon Spider, accepted her as an adopted daughter, and cultivated her vigorously.

Chi Yue was looking forward to the day when Shan Qing Luo could bring out the full power of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider and revive its long lost ancient glory.

The Heavenly Moon Demon Spider was a Variant Ancient Divine Spirit, one of the most terrifying Monster Beasts to have ever lived.

However, compared to true legendary Ancient Divine Spirits, there was still somewhat of a gap.

Amongst Ancient Divine Spirits though, the dragon and the phoenix were hailed as sovereigns!

Unfortunately, all powerful Divine Spirits had long ago disappeared, with only obscure references in the oldest ancient books aggrandizing their might remaining today.

The Ancient Divine Spirits were thought to only exist in legends, and although they technically belonged to the Monster Race... they were born as emperors and were existences that every Monster Race would have to bow before and worship.

Chi Yue also thought that the Ancient Divine Spirits had long ago disappeared.

But now, in her palace, she actually heard a genuine dragon roar.

As this deafening roar rang out, shaking the Heavens, the faint trace of Heavenly Moon Demon Spider blood in Chi Yue’s veins trembled in fear.

Not daring to hesitate, Chi Yue’s figure flickered as she shot out from her chambers and rushed towards the battlefield.

She knew that Xue Lian was in terrible trouble this time!

Outside the palace, Yang Kai wore a cold look as he took a deep breath and gave up suppressing the rampaging mysterious power in his body and allowed it to fully erupt.

The dragon roar shook the sky as golden light exploded outwards then condensed into a massive golden figure that swam about Yang Kai’s body. Its figure was obscuring the heavens as an imposing majesty pulsed from its form. Its two eyes, which were bigger than houses, also flashed with the purest golden light, awing all those who saw them.

Shaking its head and waving its tail, as soon as it appeared, it rushed towards Xue Lian without pause.

Xue Lian was dumbfounded and the rampaging, flame-like aura around his body seemed to instantly be doused with a basin of cold water and was all but annihilated.

In the instant Xue Lian fell absent-minded, the golden dragon’s figure opened its mouth wide, chomped down on his Monster Core, then swallowed it into its abdomen before immediately returning to the top of Yang Kai’s head to stare down at everyone below.

“Impossible!” Mi Tian screamed out as he stared at the golden dragon blankly, unable to contain his shock at its sudden appearance.

“A Divine Dragon!” Yu Xiong almost bit his tongue as he shivered violently.

Ba He simply stared at the astonishing scene in front of him speechlessly, as if he had lost the ability to even form coherent thoughts.

Shan Qing Luo’s beautiful eyes flashed with a brilliant splendor as a giant silver spider phantom with a crescent moon pattern on its head manifested behind her to resist the thick Dragon Pressure. This spider was bigger than a house and was so lifelike it could easily have been mistaken for a living creature.

Heavenly Moon Demon Spider!

Of all those who were present, only Shan Qing Luo’s situation wasn’t so embarrassing.

Firstly, she was born a human, so the Dragon Pressure brought the least amount of suppression to her. Secondly, she had absorbed the Source of a Heavenly Moon Demon Spider, so she was able to partially resist the powerful Dragon Pressure.

Even so, she too was thoroughly shocked by the Golden Dragon that suddenly emerged from Yang Kai’s body.

The entire audience felt silent as the bloody battle came to an abrupt end, leaving only the laboured breathing of one of the fighters to fill the void.

Yang Kai glanced upwards as a strange look flashed across his face before turning to Xue Lian and saying faintly, “Sorry, this guy seems to be very interested in your Monster Core, I couldn’t suppress him anymore!”

Xue Lian’s expression had become extremely dispirited and the once thick pride that covered his eyes had seemingly been crushed to dust.

In this battle, from beginning to end, Yang Kai had thoroughly wounded him both inside and out, leaving him in a battered and broken state!

Under the terrifying Dragon Pressure, Xue Lian failed to even think about taking back his Monster Core.

“Enough!” A shout suddenly rang out as a beautiful woman suddenly appeared and swept a fierce glance around the audience before finally fixing her sight on the giant Golden Dragon. Taking a deep breath, her rich peaks heaved exaggeratedly.

“Adoptive Mother!” Shan Qing Luo and Yu Xiong shouted quickly.

“Milady!” Ba He saluted respectfully.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed as he swept his Divine Sense across this beautiful woman but was shocked to discover he was unable to sense her depths at all.

An Origin King!

The identity of the other party was easy to guess, this was undoubtedly the master of this palace: Chi Yue!

This was not the first time Yang Kai had seen an Origin King as he had been around Gui Zu for some time, but the pressure he felt from Chi Yue was much stronger than the one he felt from Gui Zu.

After all, Gui Zu was only a First-Order Origin King while Chi Yue had reached the Second-Order.

The gap between one Minor Realm and the next at the Origin King Realm was like the difference between Heaven and Earth.

“Junior Yang Kai, greets Senior Chi Yue!” Yang Kai cupped his fists and shouted loudly.

Only then did Chi Yue cast her eyes towards him and gently nodded, “You are also a guest in my palace, no need to be overly polite.”

Yang Kai grinned and said freely, “Junior has long admired Senior’s resounding reputation and should have taken the initiative to visit to pay his respects, but Junior’s status is low so he did not have the face to disturb Senior. Please forgive this Junior as he meant no disrespect.”

“It doesn’t matter, this Queen also had not planned to see you,” Chi Yue replied lightly.

“Adoptive Mother, this time...” Seeing that Chi Yue’s attitude towards Yang Kai seemed lukewarm, Shan Qing Luo couldn’t help panicking, thinking that she was blaming him and hurriedly tried to defend him.

“There’s no need to say anything, I know,” Chi Yue interrupted her with a wave, not giving her a chance to speak. With her phoenix eyes narrowed, Chi Yue looked down at Yang Kai before opening her lips lightly and said, “The battle has been concluded, shouldn’t you return his Monster Core now?”

“You want me to give it back?” Yang Kai raised his brow as he showed a look of surprise.

“You’re not thinking of killing ruthlessly are you?” Chi Yue slowly shook her head, “You’re a smart man, you should know what the consequences will be if you do this.”

“Junior is truly ignorant and hopes Senior Chi Yue will enlighten him!” Yang Kai stared back at Chi Yue leisurely, not showing the slightest fear.

Ba He was sweating all over while Mi Tian felt like the soles of his feet were cramping. Yu Xiong was simply shivering to the side...

Someone actually dared speak to Lady Chi Yue like this! This little brat really didn’t know how high the Heavens were or how thick the Earth was!

What good would enraging a Monster Race Tribal Lord do for him? Didn’t he understand the concept of sparing those who you could afford to spare?

“Little bastard!” Even if Chi Yue’s temperament was quite good, she couldn’t help feeling exasperated by Yang Kai’s nonsense, but after thinking about it for a moment, her expression became gentle and she said, “This Queen is giving you face, so you should give this Queen some as well. Suffice it to say, I am many years your elder, saying too much is tiresome for me.”

“Is Senior old? Junior feels that Senior is still a full flower not inferior in any way to a young maiden,” Yang Kai said with astonishment.

Ba He and the Monster Race master present immediately gawked...

Everyone stared at Yang Kai like he was some kind of freak.

Did this brat just sexually harass Lady Tribal Lord? He did, didn’t he?

In this world, someone actually dared sexually harass Lady Tribal Lord?

Looking at Chi Yue cautiously, Ba He and others discovered to their further astonishment that Lady Tribal Lord didn’t show the slightest anger, instead flashing a strange smile as if she was simply enjoying the compliment. A moment later, however, she coldly snorted and said, “You’re quite glib even for a human, no wonder Qing Luo is so deeply in love with you. You must have deceived her like this, right?”

“Senior has spoken incorrectly, Junior conquered Qing Luo with his personal charm, not some honeyed words,” Yang Kai shook his head with a serious face.

“Wild!” Chi Yue pursed her lips and smiled, but she quickly calmed herself and put on a serious expression, “Regardless, you may not act too presumptuous in my palace. If Xue Lian has some kind of accident here, this Queen won’t have a way to explain to Xue Jiao. Return his Monster Core and treat it as this Queen owing you a favour.”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes slightly as he glanced over at the pale Xue Lian, a slight look of reluctance on his face.

“He doesn’t need to do anything!” Xue Lian suddenly shouted, “A trivial Divine Dragon remnant image can’t restrain this Young Lord’s Monster Core!”

Saying so, he opened his mouth and inhaled sharply.

A soaring dragon roar sounded again as a blood-red light suddenly shot out of the Golden Dragon’s body and was swallowed by Xue Lian.

He had easily taken back his Monster Core!

The Golden Dragon was furious at its snack being stolen and bared its fangs in anger for a time.

“Human, this Young Lord acted carelessly just now, allowing you to seize the advantage, but do you really think you can beat this Young Lord with this kind of faded afterimage? You look down on me too much!” Xue Lian said with a competitive look on his face, but all of his prior contempt was now gone and a trace of dread still flashed across his eyes.

Whether he admitted it or not, Yang Kai’s strength was not inferior to his at all.
