Zhu Lie had been sitting in the same place, not moving an inch, but the Dragon Pressure radiating from him had already been pushed to the limit. The Demon Kings standing before him were sweating buckets while the ones with the lower cultivation were shivering, their faces pale. They felt as if a huge mountain had been placed on their chests and they were having a hard time breathing.

Although the battle between Yang Kai and the Blood Demon was very short, without Zhu Lie’s deterrence, other Demon Kings would not have just stood by and watched. In any case, they were all Demons, so it was impossible for them to idly sit while their clansman was being killed.

In fact, several Demon Kings wanted to make a move as soon as the Blood Demon made his, but they were suppressed by Zhu Lie before they could act.

The red-haired young man had put a lot of pressure on the Demon Kings, but the pressure the strange Human was giving wasn’t any weaker. They weren’t confident that they could survive under his attacks, so they remained obedient after being suppressed, secretly praying that they would not draw fire upon themselves.

Now that the dust had settled, it became apparent that the Blood Demon had suffered serious injuries, and while he may be alive, he was as good as a walking corpse. This chilled the other Demon Kings even further, making them all worry about what kind of fate was awaiting them.

“What are you trying to do?” Zhu Lie frowned and impatiently stared at Yang Kai.

First, he went to Demon Fury City to look for Demon Kings to inquire about some strange beast, and now, he had attacked without a word. It would have been nothing if he had killed the Blood Demon, but Yang Kai actually just put him into a half-dead state, which was rather baffling.

“You will know later,” Yang Kai indifferently replied. At this moment, he noticed Zhu Qing flying over, with Li Jiao a half step behind her. Who knows what kind of brown-nosing he was doing, but it was clear he was nodding and bowing with a big smile on his face. However, he couldn’t get any response from Zhu Qing.

After the two flew closer, Li Jiao hurriedly greeted Yang Kai.

“What happened here?” Zhu Qing curiously looked around. She was puzzled about what had happened as she noticed the traces of fighting and could tell that they were fresh.

“Nothing much,” Yang Kai gave an arbitrary reply before he looked at the black puppy in her arms and asked, “How is it doing?”

“It’s getting better, but it seems a little weak,” Zhu Qing caressed the little black puppy’s head.

Its situation had indeed improved. When Yang Kai left, the black puppy was still frozen in a block of ice, but now, although there was still frost on its body, it was obviously much better.

Right at that moment, it looked as if it had smelled something delicious and it raised its head to look at the nearby Demon Kings, drooling from the corner of its mouth.

Being stared at by this small beast, many Demon Kings felt as if they had encountered their nemesis and their hands and feet went cold as they promptly looked away.

“Want to eat?” Yang Kai smilingly asked.

“Woof!” The black puppy’s bark immediately rang in his mind as it struggled to get up from Zhu Qing’s arm.

“Don’t just indiscriminately eat things,” Zhu Qing frowned as she scolded it. She wanted to say it when she saw Ah Wang swallow the two Demon Race members before, but the situation had changed so abruptly that she wasn’t able to. Now that she saw it wanting to do the same thing, she immediately knocked its head.

The black puppy aggrievedly whimpered.

Yang Kai picked up the black puppy from Zhu Qing’s arm and said, “Qing’er, if we want to leave this place, we’ll have to let it eat more.”

“Huh?” Zhu Qing furrowed her brow, wondering what Yang Kai meant.

The next moment, she saw Yang Kai throw the black puppy straight toward the absentminded Blood Demon.

In the air, Ah Wang was in high spirits, practically glowing with vigour. His pair of black eyes burst with a fearsome glow as it suddenly opened its mouth, which grew to the size of a door as it swallowed the Blood Demon in one bite.

*Ssii…*

Immediately, gasps escaped from the Demon Kings’ mouths as they dumbfoundedly stared at the black puppy’s sudden transformation. Their eyes were ready to pop out of their sockets. The frightening things Yang Kai had been talking about earlier were gradually confirmed by what they were seeing before their eyes, bringing them all to a horrifying conclusion.

“Abyssal Returner!”

The Charm Demon’s scream reverberated throughout the sky as her face, which had just regained a bit of its complexion, turned completely pale once again. She seemed to have lost all her strength as she crumpled down to the ground.

Although the other Demon Kings fared better than her, they were greatly frightened for sure. Panic immediately spread among the Demon Kings, making all of them extremely uneasy as their emotions were thrown into chaos.

The legendary monster that they thought was long dead had suddenly appeared in front of them. They simply couldn’t believe this; after all, in the records of the Demon Race, the Abyssal Returner was described in the most terrifying of ways, portraying it as the living embodiment of catastrophe and destruction. Almost a third of the Demon Realm was destroyed by its demonic hunger, and the current harsh environment of the Demon Realm was inextricably linked to it.

They couldn’t figure out how the Abyssal Returner was still alive. Wasn’t it killed by the Great Demon God of the time? Could it be that the rumours they spoke of earlier were actually true? That the Abyssal Returner had escaped by feigning death, hoping to make a comeback, and when it was prepared, it would definitely go looking for the Great Demon God for revenge. The current shattered Demon Realm couldn’t withstand any more destruction.

With so many Demon Kings here, it was impossible to misidentify the Abyssal Returner. Although the Abyssal Returned seemed very ordinary at a glance, when it transformed, its characteristics couldn’t be any more obvious.

In other words, this seemingly docile black puppy was definitely the Abyssal Returner, the very same horrifying existence that destroyed the Demon Realm and fought a life and death battle with the Great Demon God back then.

[No wonder, no wonder this Human wanted to learn everything about the Abyssal Returner.]

It turned out that what he said about raising an Abyssal Returner was really true!

Just as this thought crossed their minds, many Demon Kings’ faces turned as black as the bottom of a pot.

They seemed to have revealed a lot of information that shouldn’t have been revealed, especially the part about the strength of the Abyssal Returner, which was simply life-threatening information.

In a flash, all the Demon Kings felt regret, especially the Demon Kings who had revealed more sensitive information, wishing to tear their mouths off for their foolishness.

While the Demon Kings had lost their wits in shock and horror, the little puppy had already swallowed the Blood Demon in one bite, and its enormous mouth had already returned to its original shape. There was a satisfied look on its face, and its belly was moving up and down. The frost covering its body surprisingly began to melt at speed visible to the naked eye. Wisps of Cold Qi slowly flowed out of its body, assimilating into the surroundings and causing the temperature to drop sharply.

Moreover, under Yang Kai’s keen perception, the moment the black puppy ingested its latest food, its aura soared, reaching to the level of Sixth-Order Monster Beast before returning to its original level after the black puppy returned to its native state.

In just a short dozen breaths, the black puppy had already returned to its original size, but it wasn’t as weak as before; its vitality was as vigorous as a dragon and it was walking in large strides. It was now eagerly looking at the Demon Kings, making them shiver in horror.

“Hmm?” Zhu Qing looked at the black puppy in astonishment, as if she hadn’t expected that swallowing a Demon King would be this helpful.

Yang Kai explained, “This little thing is a Demon Realm Exotic Beast. It also seems to be very famous over here. There is a kind of void space in its belly, which allows it to devour everything, so anything related to the Demon Race makes it stronger.”

Zhu Qing thoughtfully asked, “Speaking of which, was the Yin Wind it had swallowed before swallowed into that unknown space too?”

Yang Kai replied, “It should be so. I guess the size of that space has something to do with its strength. If it’s not strong enough and the space in its belly is too small, it can’t handle it after swallowing it to a certain extent.”

“It’s really amazing,” Zhu Qing looked surprised, sizing up the black puppy as if she wanted to re-assess it. The Yin Wind they had encountered on Yin Wind Mountain was too terrifying. The Cold Demon Qi that became heavier as they walked further was something even Yang Kai and she couldn’t resist, was swallowed by the black puppy in its strange space, carrying them more than a thousand meters up Yin Wind Mountain. This kind of ability was shocking.

“Do you want to make it stronger, strong enough to take us deeper into the Yin Wind Mountain?” Zhu Lie asked, furrowing his brow. Yang Kai’s intentions couldn’t be any more obvious now, so if he still couldn’t guess it, he would really be a fool.

“That’s right.” Yang Kai nodded his agreement, “Ah Wang is our only chance now. As long as it is strong enough, and the space in its belly large enough, then it can definitely lead us outside.”

Zhu Lie thought for a moment before agreeing, “This is indeed an opportunity. However… before that, it needs a lot of food.” While speaking, he glanced at the Demon Kings.

Many Demon Kings’ faces turned bitter. They had the will to resist but were powerless to do so. They felt wronged.

The Charm Demon sat down on the ground in despair. She hadn’t expected that such a destiny awaited her. She racked her brain, trying to come up with ways to survive. If there was no Blood Demon, she could have tried to seduce Yang Kai, but the previous battle had left her in a sorry state that would take at least a month or two to recover from. How could she get so much time to recuperate now?

Yang Kai added, “Of course, this is just my guess. I don’t know if it will work. In order to confirm this, I have to go and do a little experiment.”

“How are you going to experiment?” Zhu Qing asked.

Yang Kai slightly smiled before he reached out and grabbed the black puppy. The black puppy looked confused; it had no idea how it would be treated next.

“Take good care of these guys, none of them are allowed to leave,” ordered Yang Kai before his figure disappeared from the spot.

Zhu Lie thoughtfully gazed in Yin Wind Mountain’s direction.

After a while, he retracted his gaze and firmly sat.

The Charm Demon was flabbergasted. She wanted to escape but didn’t have the guts to try it. Obviously, she could only stand up and walk toward the other Demon Kings.

She gingerly glanced at Zhu Lie and noticing that he didn’t have any intention of stopping her, she secretly heaved a sigh of relief. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Many Demon Kings gathered around as their Divine Senses surged. Apparently, they were discussing ways to save their lives. Occasionally, a faint murderous intent would emerge, obviously wanting to give it a try.

After all, they weren’t weak. If they were really fish in the net and had no chance to live, it would have been a given that they would become food for the Abyssal Returner.

Demon Fury City had stood in the Revolving World for hundreds of thousands of years and had been constantly at war with Human Imperial City, but it had never faced this kind of crisis.

This strange Human Boy, who had appeared out of nowhere, was beyond what they could contend with.
