Chapter 1763, Illusionary Void Butterfly

Just when Yang Kai and Xue Yue were about to withdraw quietly though, Kong Fa, who was flying over, shouted, “Is that Senior Ni of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce?”

He obviously recognized Ni Guang, but even so, he didn’t try to avoid him, instead taking the initiative to greet him. This scene was very unusual because both Kong Fa and Xu Wei’s past actions included spilling much blood from Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce. Under normal circumstances, encountering Ni Guang would prompt them to immediately escape, so how could they suddenly call out to him and even rush over on their own?

Ni Guang froze for a moment and frowned slightly, thinking about whether the other party was plotting something. Silently signalling Luo Lan to act cautiously, he coldly snorted and called out, “You’re right, I’m Ni Guang!”

Kong Fa suddenly became overjoyed and immediately shouted, “Wonderful! If Senior Ni can offer his assistance, this Kong will certainly offer generous compensation in the future!”

“Assistance?” Ni Guang was stunned, but suddenly realizing something, his eyes shrank, and he turned his gaze to what was behind Kong Fa and Xu Wei. The next moment, his expression paled, and he called out in alarm, “Not good!”

He finally understood what had happened to Kong Fa and Xu Wei, and why they still dared to approach despite knowing he was here.

These two were being chased by a group of ancient beasts!

It was also at this moment that Yang Kai and the others noticed what was happening.

Since the appearance of Kong Fa and Xu Wei, they had not made any particularly alarming moves, but from the looks of it, they were quite dishevelled, as if they had just gone through a tough battle. The two of them were even slightly injured.

At first, Yang Kai was quite puzzled, wondering what could cause two Origin Kings to suffer such injuries, but when Kong Fa called out for help, Yang Kai finally noticed a strange multi-coloured light flashing about three kilometres behind the pair. This light was quite dazzling, and it was impossible to discover its true form at first glance, but as it drew closer, Yang Kai realized that it turned out to be a large swarm of butterfly-like insects.

The fluttering of their multi-coloured wings made their movements quite difficult to discern, and every time they flapped their wings, it was as if they teleported a short distance, slowly but surely shortening the distance between them and Kong Fa and Xu Wei.

From Yang Kai’s group’s perspective, Kong Fa and Xu Wei were being pursued by at least a thousand or so of these butterfly-like insects.

“What are those?” Luo Lan’s pretty face paled. Although she did not know what these strange butterflies were, she could tell from how distressed Kong Fa and Xu Wei were, that these insects weren’t to be provoked easily.

“Illusionary Void Butterflies!” Ni Guang replied quickly, “They are Exotic Ancient Insects that are born proficient in Space Force, their bodies are stronger than steel and they are extremely ferocious. Once they find prey, they swarm like locusts and never...”

Before he could finish his words, a broader region behind Kong Fa and Xu Wei filled with multi-coloured light as more and more Illusionary Void Butterflies appeared.

From the looks of it, there were several thousands, possibly several tens of thousands of them...

At least tens of thousands of Illusionary Void Butterfly were swiftly flying toward this side, a terrifying scene to behold. Every time these butterflies flapped their wings, the surrounding space would ripple slightly, as if it was being disturbed.

“Run!” Ni Guang shouted before promptly wrapping his Saint Qi around Xue Yue, turning in the opposite direction, and flew off.

He was different from Luo Lan in that he had done a lot of preparation before entering the Severed World, and thus knew about the existence of the Illusionary Void Butterflies. Knowing that these ferocious and unrelenting insects were chasing after Kong Fa and Xu Wei, Ni Guang did not hesitate to run.

Seeing Ni Guang behave like this, Yang Kai and Luo Lan deeply understood how serious the matter was and immediately used their own Movement Skills to flee.

Luo Lan was an Origin King Realm so her escaping speed was naturally not slow, and although Yang Kai’s cultivation was lower, he had unique advantages when it came to speed. In terms of physical strength and Saint Qi purity, Yang Kai was far above ordinary Origin Realm cultivators, so his pace was no slower than Luo Lan’s.

“Senior Ni!” Kong Fa shouted from the rear, “I hope that Senior Ni can help this Kong and Brother Xu escape this calamity!”

Ni Guang was furious when he heard this and as he fled shouted back without even looking, “Scram! If you dare to follow this old master, I’ll kill you!”

He had a stomach full of grievances encountering this kind of disaster through no fault of his own. What’s worse, the guilty party was now shamelessly chasing after him, clamouring on and on about helping them. If it were not for Ni Guang also dreading these Illusionary Void Butterflies, he would certainly turn around and kill Kong Fa.

This was undoubtedly a good chance to kill Kong Fa.

“Does Senior Ni insist on being so unkind?” Kong Fa’s voice suddenly became cold.

“This old master does not need to show you any kindness!” Ni Guang coldly snorted.

Kong Fa grinned strangely hearing this and said, “Since Senior Ni is so unkind, don’t blame this Kong and Brother Xu for being impolite.”

Saying so, he and Xu Wei exchanged a glance before each condensing their Saint Qi and releasing an attack towards Ni Guang.

Powerful fluctuations filled the air as two bright lights flashed across the sky like meteors, bombarding the path in front of Ni Guang. Facing this situation, Ni Guang had no choice but to slow down and alter his path, turning his head at the same time and angrily cursing, “Two bastards, this old master will remember this!”

“Despicable! Shameless!” Luo Lan also cursed.

These two Origin Kings belonged to the most hated forces in the Star Field and were now determined to drag Ni Guang and Luo Lan into this muddy water because that was the only way they could reduce the pressure these tens of thousands of Illusionary Void Butterflies gave them.

The short diversion allowed Kong Fa and Xu Wei to pull much closer, along with the Illusionary Void Butterflies behind them.

While continuing to curse, Ni Guang did not dare to remain or even fight back, simply continuing to flee forward with Xue Yue.

Yang Kai’s face also became gloomy as he realized that they had run into a difficult situation this time. Judging from how things were progressing, it was almost inevitable that Ni Guang and Luo Lan would become entangled with these Illusionary Void Butterflies, and from what Yang Kai could tell about the power these ancient Monster Beasts, he and Xue Yue would definitely be thrown into danger.

What’s more, there were also two insidious and cunning foxes, Kong Fa and Xu Wei, who were eager to stir up trouble, making the situation even more dangerous.

“Senior Ni, why act like this? Wouldn’t it be better to first join hands and take care of these Monster Beasts before discussing what to do next?” Seeing that his little trick had worked, Kong Fa put on a look of desperate entreaty and once again proposed cooperating with Ni Guang.

Ni Guang did not respond, his face extremely sullen, only sparing a moment to glance over at Xue Yue with a little worry. With his powerful Second-Order Origin King cultivation, he was not actually too worried about these Illusionary Void Butterflies. Even if he were to be surrounded by them, he had about eighty percent confidence he could escape, but with Xue Yue, the situation was different.

Realizing this, he quickly sent a Divine Sense Message to Xue Yue, “If we become separated, you must protect yourself well!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Xue Yue nodded imperceptibly.

At that moment, Kong Fa and Xu Wei used their Secret Techniques again to further delay Ni Guang and Luo Lan. In order to draw in these two Origin King Realm helpers, both Kong Fa and Xu Wei used their full strength to launch their strongest attacks.

After Ni Guang and Luo Lan fended off these attacks, Kong Fa and Xu Wei were less than three hundred metres away with the swarm of Illusionary Void Butterfly not far behind.

“This old master swears, one day, he will grind you two bastards into dust!” Ni Guang saw that he could no longer escape, waved his hand, pushed Xue Yue out, turned, and roared.

“Why are you so angry, Senior Ni? We should be discussing how to overcome this calamity before us,” Kong Fa continued to call out, only to change complexion greatly in the next moment when he saw Ni Guang actually attack him.

Kong Fa let out a panicked cry as he stretched out his hand and summoned a blood-red shield for protection.

*Hong...*

There was a great explosion as the violent attack hit the shield. The shield flashed brightly, and although Ni Guang’s actions had been hasty, the impact of his strike had sent Kong Fa flying backwards.

With a horrified look in his eyes, Kong Fa fell directly into the encirclement of the Illusionary Void Butterflies.

The multi-coloured swarm of butterflies soon engulfed the area, completely shrouding Kong Fa. Only the strange screams and violent energy fluctuations which came from the swarm served as proof Kong Fa had not died.

Soon after, a figure shot into the sky as Kong Fa managed to escape.

However, in the few breaths of time he had been trapped, Kong Fa had suffered serious injuries and was covered in blood. Half of his nose had been sheared off and there were now pits in his face, as if something had melted parts of it away, giving him a terrifying appearance and illustrating just how dangerous these Illusionary Void Butterflies were.

Countless Illusionary Void Butterflies swarmed forward, their multi-coloured halos filling the sky as they ruthlessly pursued their prey.

Kong Fa reaped what he had sown and was instantly put into a bad situation while Ni Guang and Luo Lan, who had been dragged into this mess by him, also had nervous expressions, both summoning their defensive artifacts and mobilizing their Secret Techniques one after another to fiercely bombard the surrounding Illusionary Void Butterflies.

*Ding ding dang dang...*

The Origin King Realm masters’ attacks hitting the Illusionary Void Butterflies created clinking metallic sounds, as if they had struck some kind of metal. Swaths of Illusionary Void Butterflies fell from the sky to their death, but they were soon replaced by even more of their companions, forming an air-tight encirclement around them.

Xu Wei’s situation was not any better.

The four Origin Kings could only fight independently, striving to protect themselves.

As for Xue Yue, who had been forewarned by Ni Guang, she joined up with Yang Kai at this moment. She knew that in this scenario, only by joining hands with Yang Kai would she have a chance to survive.

A bracelet shaped artifact exuding a powerful energy fluctuation appeared in Xue Yue’s hand, and once she poured her Saint Qi into it, it rapidly transformed into two bracelets, then four, then eight. Soon there were hundreds of bracelets filling the sky.

This was obviously an Origin King Grade artifact!

With Xue Yue’s status and talent, it was only natural for her to have an Origin King Grade artifact. It would be strange if she did not possess one.

Unfortunately, because her cultivation was too low, even if she had an Origin King Grade artifact, it was only an Origin King Grade Low-Rank.

Under the urging of her Saint Qi, the phantom bracelets flickered before shooting off like arrows from a bow and the Illusionary Void Butterflies that were flying towards Yang Kai and Xue Yue at that moment were knocked flying.

Xue Yue frowned after her first attack failed to have the desired effect, muttering to herself, “These things have such strong defences!”
