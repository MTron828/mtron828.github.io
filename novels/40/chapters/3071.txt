“Is it worth it for you to do this?” A gentle voice was heard asking as Fu Xuan looked up at Mo Huang. His thick beard felt ticklish on her forehead, but she was yearning for this feeling, so she moved her forehead a little to rub his beard against her skin, as though she was trying to imprint this feeling in the deepest part of her soul.

Despite Mo Huang’s masculine face, he appeared gentle as he stroked her face and put on a smile, “No matter how beautiful the world is, you’re the only one I love.”

Fu Xuan’s gaze brightened up when she heard that.

Mo Huang grinned, “I heard Li Wu Yi, that brat, say this before. So, I’m just borrowing his words.”

Fu Xuan giggled, “So, those are Wu Yi’s words.”

After a sigh, Mo Huang uttered, “I’m sorry for what you’ve had to endure all these years.”

Fu Xuan shook her head and replied, “I had already expected this, and I deserved this kind of punishment. In any case, we’ve reunited today.”

In a serious manner, Mo Huang swore, “I’ll never let you leave me again!”

“But you’ll have to go against all of Dragon Island.” Fu Xuan pressed her head against the man’s broad chest. As she listened to his heartbeat, it was as though it was the most melodious music in the world and despite her words, the smile on her face suggested that she was truly happy.

Mo Huang snorted, “The day we met, I was already prepared to oppose Dragon Island.”

At the time when they chanced upon each other, they were both young and free-spirited. At first glance, Mo Huang could recognize that the arrogant-looking woman was a Dragon Clan member, and as the Martial Beast Great Emperor, whose Dao was that of Beast Taming, he had conquered many in this world, but he had never tamed a Dragon before. As his mind was filled with this thought, he couldn’t control his urge anymore. Repeatedly, he tried to approach her, forcefully at times. Eventually, he managed to subdue her, but he didn’t expect that he could never free himself from her after having a taste of her gentleness. Since then, grudges that were unknown to the outside world had been formed between the Dragon Clan and him.

As he reminisced about the past, he put on a warm smile and thought that it was the wisest decision he had ever made.

“How is Xiao Qi now?” Fu Xuan suddenly asked.

“She’s grown-up now, but she’s still acting like a spoiled child. You should go back to Spirit Beast Island with me to discipline her.”

Fu Xuan questioned, “She hasn’t found out about her identity, right?”

Mo Huang shook his head, “I haven’t told her about it. Hmm, that girl has been giving me some trouble recently though.”

“What happened?” Fu Xuan was shocked. After all, that was her own daughter. Although she had never met her daughter after giving birth to her, they were still mother and daughter, so naturally Fu Xuan was concerned about her. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“She’s been longing for a certain brat recently,” Mo Huan replied with a dark expression.

Fu Xuan was startled for a moment before she burst out laughing.

“What are you laughing at?”

Fu Xuan stopped laughing and explained, “Well, Xiao Qi has already come of age, so it’s expected that she’d be fond of one or two boys.”

Mo Huang shook his head repeatedly, “No, no. She’s still too young, so she shouldn’t even think about such things yet!”

Fu Xuan said gently, “Although I’m her mother, I have never had the chance to discipline her. You’re right to be concerned about her, but make sure that you won’t make her hate you because of this.”

Mo Huang was stunned, “She’ll hate me because of that brat?”

Fu Xuan pressed her lips together and smiled, “I don’t know. She’s grown up now, and women are generally more outgoing.”

Mo Huang’s expression darkened when he heard that. All of a sudden, he became worried about his daughter.

“Alright. We should go over to have a look now.”

With a frown, Mo Huang said, “We’d better not go. We’ll just have a chat here until the two old farts are done settling their problems.”

Fu Xuan looked up at him, “Please bring me there to have a look. They’re my fellow clansmen, after all.”

Mo Huang could never say no to her whenever she pleaded with him, so he immediately nodded, “Alright, alright. Since you’ve said so, we’ll go over now.” He paused for a moment and smiled, “If we’re lucky, we might even see that brat.”

Upon finishing his words, he carried Fu Xuan up and flew towards the sky.

Fu Xuan was startled for a moment before she grasped the meaning behind his words, “You mean, the boy Xiao Qi is fond of is on Dragon Island as well?”

“En. It’s thanks to him that I was able to sneak into this place without anyone noticing.” Mo Huang nodded his head. If it weren’t because Yang Kai had made a scene on Dragon Island and attracted the attention of Zhu Yan and Fu Zhun, Mo Huang would not have been able to sneak into this place unnoticed.

Normally, if he were to enter Dragon Island, Zhu Yan and Fu Zhun would immediately discover him.

“Is he a member of the Dragon Clan?” Fu Xuan frowned. She was a Dragon Clan member herself, so she knew that those male Dragons were all promiscuous people. If her daughter had fallen in love with a male Dragon, things would become thorny.

“No, he’s not a Dragon. He’s Human,” Mo Huang shook his head and replied.

“A Human?” Fu Xuan was puzzled, “How did a Human enter Dragon Island? What is he here for?”

Mo Huang pursed his lips and uttered, “He’s here to snatch a bride.”

Fu Xuan was shocked, and after she pestered him about it for a while, she finally found out what crazy things Yang Kai had done on Dragon Island. At that moment, she was astounded and thought that this young man was far too rash and brazen. However, after a change of thought, she realized that this boy called Yang Kai was in a similar situation as Mo Huang.

Both of them were Humans, and they had both married Dragon women. Naturally, the Dragon Clan was against their marriages, so they were forced to go against the Dragon Clan.

At that instant, Fu Xuan felt sympathetic towards Yang Kai.

Mo Huang was one of the Ten Great Emperors, but even he couldn’t bring Fu Xuan out of Dragon Island at that time. Certainly, Yang Kai couldn’t do that either. This love story between a Human and a Dragon was bound to have a tragic ending, as the Dragon Clan’s obstinacy was legendary.

…..

All of a sudden, a figure shot up from the sea, which attracted the attention of Yang Kai and the others. Upon a closer look, the Embodiment had shrunk to become as tall as an ordinary Human again. Steam was rising from its body as it flew towards the sky.

Zhu Qing and Fu Ling sized it up in shock and wondered where this thing had come from. However, the Divine Spirit aura on this stone man was conspicuous, so they immediately recognized that it was a Shi Huo.

What shocked them was that Yang Kai’s aura also lingered on this Shi Huo. If they scanned the stone man with Divine Sense instead of looking at it with their eyes, they would have thought that it was Yang Kai.

In a doubtful manner, Zhu Qing turned to look at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai uttered gently, “He’s with me.”

His Embodiment was a combination of his Soul Clone and a Stone Spirit. Although it had integrated with Shi Huo’s Source and become the Divine Spirit Shi Huo, it had not changed fundamentally.

It had been battling a Dragon Clan member earlier, but it was now returning to this place alone. Apparently, its opponent had fled, but none of them were certain what the outcome of the battle was.

Just when Yang Kai was about to ask this question, he was rooted to the spot upon hearing what the Embodiment said.

“Wu Kuang is here!”

Yang Kai asked in shock, “How do you know?”

Zhu Qing asked with a frown, “Wu Kuang? Which Wu Kuang?”

Fu Ling said with a smile, “Who is that? Why does he share the same name as Heaven Devouring Great Emperor?”

Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was a legend. More than 20,000 years had passed since his ‘fall’, but no one had surpassed him in terms of achievements and power. That was why even the haughty Dragon Clan members still remembered this name and were wary of him.

The Embodiment replied, “I wasn’t supposed to wake up today. I was awakened by a special force.”

“What kind of force?”

“A resonance from my cultivation technique!”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai was finally able to connect the dots. His Embodiment’s cultivation technique was the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, which was a Secret Art created by Wu Kuang. In the past, Heaven Devouring Great Emperor had no equal in this world because of this Secret Art. During the Great Emperor War, he had even managed to kill a number of Great Emperors despite being completely outnumbered.

If there was anyone in this world who could sense Wu Kuang’s presence, it was the Embodiment.

It was no wonder the Embodiment would awaken in advance. It wasn’t that Yang Kai’s calculations were wrong, but a special circumstance had taken place.

“Why is he on Dragon Island? If he’s here, does it mean that Senior Duan has come as well?”

After the battle in the Shattered Star Sea, the Souls of Wu Kuang and Duan Hong Chen were forced to co-exist in one body. After that, in the Divine Ascension Mirror of Azure Sun Temple, Wu Kuang took control of the body and fled from the temple. No trace of him had appeared since then.

Yang Kai had never expected that Wu Kuang would come to Dragon Island. As he thought about it, his chest tightened all of a sudden. The reason the Embodiment could sense Wu Kuang’s presence was that Wu Kuang must have used his Heaven Devouring Battle Law. It was impossible for Wu Kuang to use his Secret Art for no reason. When Yang Kai recalled the sight of the Fallen Dragon Rain earlier, a horrifying idea sprang into his mind.

Yang Kai turned to look in a particular direction and yelled, “Damn it! Come with me!”

Upon finishing his words, he flew off in that direction. While in the air, cracking sounds could be heard from all over his body as he returned to his original form.

After they flew off, all the remaining Dragon Clan members, who had been defeated, traded glances with each other before they raced after them.

Wu Kuang had arrived on Dragon Island and even used his Heaven Devouring Battle Law. On top of that, a Dragon Clan member had died, so the possibility it was Wu Kuang’s doing was high. He possessed the foundation and heritage of the strongest Great Emperor in history, so if he wasn’t stopped immediately, no one knew how much damage he would inflict here.

Yang Kai didn’t care about the Dragon Clan’s safety, but Liu Yan and Jiu Feng were over there. If they came across Wu Kuang, they might not be able to deal with him.

In just a short moment, Yang Kai had returned to the previous battlefield and upon closer inspection, he couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief. Liu Yan and Jiu Feng were fine, while the Dragon Clan members, who were battling against them, had stopped as they gathered together with dark expressions on their faces. Apparently, the fall of a Dragon Clan member had dealt an unimaginable blow to them, so they were not in the mood to keep fighting.

Furthermore, all the Dragon Clan members in this place were unharmed, which meant that Wu Kuang didn’t make a move here.

Seeing Yang Kai, Liu Yan hurriedly flew towards him. Yang Kai stroked her head and asked with care, “Are you hurt?”

Liu Yan shook her head. She had learned a great deal from this battle; after all, it was hard to have a chance to fight with a member of the Dragon Clan. After this battle, her strength and experience had increased significantly.

“Brat, did you do it?” Jiu Feng looked at Yang Kai and asked with a frown.

If Yang Kai was the one who killed a Dragon Clan member, he was doomed, which was why Jiu Feng couldn’t help but ask him about it.

Yang Kai shook his head, “It wasn’t me.”

Jiu Feng asked curiously, “Who was it, then? Did Zhu Yan or Fu Zhun really… never mind.”

She turned to look in a different direction, where two beams of lights, one green and one white, were approaching at incredible speed. In the blink of an eye, they landed on the ground in front of everyone. They were none other than Zhu Yan and Fu Zhun.
