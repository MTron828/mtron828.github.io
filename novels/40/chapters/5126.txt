3,000 Grand Daos, the ultimate truth of the Martial Dao, and the mysteries above the Emperor Realm, this was far too attractive for the residents of Void World.

There was no cultivator who didn’t yearn for a higher Martial Dao, especially the Emperor Realm Masters.

They had been stuck in this Realm for many years. Had this been the end of the Martial Dao, then it would not have mattered, but the crux of the issue was that they could feel that the Emperor Realm was not the peak of the Martial Dao. There were even more profound Realms ahead, but they had no idea how to break through to those Realms.

There were rumours that the Ancestor of Seven Stars Sect had a cultivation that surpassed the Emperor Realm, but he was quite elusive; even the higher-ups of Seven Stars Sect couldn’t easily meet him, let alone outsiders like them.

Now that the Void Dao Temple bestowed by the World had appeared out of thin air, containing the mysteries of what lay beyond the Emperor Realm, how could these Emperor Realm Masters not be tempted?

Be that as it may, they had all tried to approach it before, but no matter how hard they tried, they were unable to reach it, except for Miao Fei Ping.

“Elder Miao, what must we do to ascend to the Void Dao Temple?” An Emperor Realm Master from another Sect humbly asked.

Miao Fei Ping replied, “Aptitude, only those with outstanding aptitude can reach the Void Dao Temple. It has nothing to do with cultivation.”

Immediately, someone indignantly asked, “Does Elder Miao mean that your aptitude is better than everyone else here?”

These words were undoubtedly quite revolting to everyone present; after all, everyone standing here was an Emperor Realm Master. Furthermore, all of them were extremely confident in their own aptitude. However, if they were to admit that admittance to the Void Dao Temple was based solely on aptitude, it would mean admitting that Miao Fei Ping’s aptitude was far better than theirs.

Shang Guan Ji glanced over at the Emperor Realm Master who had just spoken and replied, “Elder Miao is a member of our Seven Stars Sect and reached the Emperor Realm before turning 100. With such aptitude, who can compare to him?”

His words immediately made the questioning Emperor turn silent. A 100-year-old Emperor Realm Master was truly unprecedented. Such cultivation speed was far better than any of the other Emperor Realm Masters present.

Another person asked curiously, “Elder Miao, how do you know all this?”

One had to know that Miao Fei Ping had only been in that hall for the time it takes for half an incense to burn, so how could he have obtained so much information?

Miao Fei Ping cupped his fist slightly, “This untalented Miao has been acknowledged by the Void Dao Temple. From today onward, I will be the first Temple Master of the Void Dao Temple, that is why I have obtained some information about this Void Dao Temple.”

As soon as these words left his mouth, the entire audience fell silent. All of the Emperor Realm Masters stared at him blankly. Even Shang Guan Ji and the others from the Seven Stars Sect were shocked.

A palace had appeared out of nowhere; then, Miao Fei Ping declared that it was the Void Dao Temple and was bestowed by the World itself and contained the 3,000 Grand Daos, the highest truths of the Martial Dao, and the mysteries above the Emperor Realm. Now, he even proclaimed that he had obtained the recognition of the Void Dao Temple and had become its first Temple Master?

This revelation was really shocking, so shocking that the Emperor Realm Masters couldn’t immediately respond.

Miao Fei Ping pondered for a moment before replying, “The purpose of the Void Dao Temple is to teach the 3,000 Grand Daos. As the Temple Master, I am responsible for guiding the Dao Temple’s disciples’ cultivation.”

“As long as one’s aptitude is sufficiently high, anyone can enter the Dao Temple to cultivate, regardless of their cultivation. Even a child who has never cultivated before may gain entrance if their aptitude is sufficient!” While speaking, Miao Fei Ping cupped his fist, “Sect Masters, Elders, if you have any disciples with outstanding aptitude in mind, please send them to the Dao Temple. If they can pass the test of the Dao Temple, they may enter and comprehend the mysteries of the Grand Dao.”

The Emperor Realm Sect Masters and Elders all looked at each other in dismay upon hearing this. Finally, one of the Sect Masters sneered, “In that case, this humble one understands. Void Dao Temple… hah, I’ll take my leave now!”

Saying so, he turned and left, followed by the Emperor Realm Elders under him.

With someone taking the lead, the others quickly left as well.

Some even sneered before leaving, “Brother Shang Guan, if Seven Stars Sect wants to take in all the geniuses in the World, there’s no need to use such a clumsy method. This Void World is not that small, and a single Seven Stars Sect cannot swallow it all. Brother Shang Guan, please take care of yourself!”

Shang Guan Ji slightly furrowed his brow but didn’t try to explain.

Right now, he also had no idea what this was all about. He vaguely felt that this Void Dao Temple was related to the Ancestor, but it was not appropriate to ask with so many people around.

The Sects that left first were all top Sects in Void World. These Sects were not weak, so they naturally regarded the strongest, Seven Stars Sect, as their competitor, hoping that one day their Sect’s strength would surpass them and become the overlord of Void World.

After listening to Miao Fei Ping’s explanation, everyone thought that this Void Dao Temple was created by the Seven Stars Sect to attract talents from all over the world. If they let all the good seedlings be taken away by the Seven Stars Sect, they would not have any successors. Perhaps Seven Stars Sect would really be able to dominate Void World in less than 100 years if they could accomplish this plot.

Since the Emperor Realm Masters of the top Sects had taken their leaves, the small and intermediate Sects didn’t stay any longer and quickly took their leave as well.

When only the higher-ups of the Seven Stars Sect remained, Guan Qian Xing finally spoke, “Fei Ping, this Void Dao Temple…”

Shang Guan Ji immediately interrupted him, “Let us return first.”

Guan Qian Xing understood that Shang Guan Ji stopped him because he was afraid that someone was trying to spy on them, so he didn’t ask any further.

After everyone had returned to Seven Stars Sect, Shang Guan Ji finally asked Miao Fei Ping, “Is what you said about the Void Dao Temple true?”

Miao Fei Ping earnestly nodded his affirmation, “It’s true. I did not speak a single lie to those people.”

A solemn look took over Shang Guan Ji’s face, “Is this related to the Ancestor?”

“En, it is indeed related to the Ancestor. It was also Ancestor who appointed me as the Temple Master.”

As soon as these words came out, all Seven Stars Sect Emperor Realm Masters were thrilled. Since it was the Ancestor’s handiwork, there was no need to doubt or worry. Previously, Shang Guan Ji had also suspected that the Void Dao Temple was created by the Ancestor, but now he had confirmation.

“Why did the Ancestor create this Void Dao Temple?” Guan Qian Xing hurriedly asked.

Miao Fei Ping replied, “Ancestor intends to take many of Void World’s geniuses under his tutelage and teach them about the Grand Dao.”

Shang Guan Ji and the others’ eyes lit up.

The Ancestor had long passed down the method to condense one’s Dao Seal to the Seven Stars Sect and had given them many resources to do so with. Some of them had even already begun to form their Dao Seals, while Miao Fei Ping was far ahead of his peers in this regard and had even begun refining Element Powers. Nonetheless, the Void Dao Temple was still extremely attractive to them.

Shang Guan Ji couldn’t help but awkwardly cough at those words.

He had also tried to ascend to the Void Dao Temple before, but unfortunately, he was unable to do so. In other words, his aptitude wasn’t high enough to be recognized by the Dao Temple.

Regardless, their Ancestor had already taught them the method to form their Dao Seal, so as long as they diligently cultivated, they could break through the shackles of the Emperor Realm someday.

Right now, the Void Dao Temple was a turning point for others.

Fixing his expression, Shang Guan Ji stated, “Since the Void Dao Temple is Ancestor’s handiwork, the Seven Stars Sect will naturally cooperate unconditionally. Fei Ping, since you are the Temple Master and have received the Ancestor’s favour, you must be diligent in the future.”

“Yes!” Miao Fei Ping replied respectfully.

“Regarding the matter of the Dao Temple, how do you want my Seven Stars Sect to cooperate?”

“Please give the order to all disciples to present themselves to the Dao Temple. It only takes an incense stick for those with appropriate aptitude to receive the blessing of the Dao Temple and enter it to cultivate the Grand Dao!”

Shang Guan Ji lightly nodded as a look of admiration appeared on his face, “As expected of Ancestor’s work. If that’s the case, I will arrange for it immediately.”

Soon, the Seven Stars Sect began moving. All of Seven Stars Sect’s disciples, regardless of their cultivation, received orders from the higher-ups to step out from their abodes or places of cultivation and present themselves to the palace in the sky for the time it takes for an incense stick to burn.

The disciples didn’t know why they were asked to look up and observe the floating palace, but since it was an order of the higher-ups, they just had to follow it. In any case, it was just an incense stick’s worth of time, so it wasn’t like it was a burdensome task.

Even the Emperor Realm Masters, who had tried to ascend to the Dao Temple before, found a secluded place and secretly focused on the palace, hoping for a miracle to occur.

The dozen or so giant squares in Seven Stars Sect were soon filled with people, all of them gazing up at the Void Dao Temple.

Time slowly passed.

After the time it took for an incense stick to burn, a five-coloured beam suddenly descended from the palace that had been quietly floating in the sky and landed on one of the disciples.

The next moment, something shocking happened. The disciple’s body slowly floated up, and as the beam of light rapidly withdrew towards the Void Dao Temple, the disciple’s cry rang out from midair.

After the first beam of multi-coloured light, several more descended. Each of these beams seemed to have some kind of restraining power, taking away a disciple who was currently observing the Dao Temple.

These rays of light were not all the same though. They were divided into three colours, five colours, and seven colours.

In just a short period of time, more than 30 disciples had been taken away by the colourful beams. Among them, the seven-coloured beams numbered the least, just two, followed by the five-coloured and then the three-coloured beams.

As for the disciples who had been taken away by the beams, all of them were excellent seedlings with outstanding aptitudes. The greater their aptitudes were, the more colourful the beam that fell on them had been.

The higher-ups of the Seven Stars Sect could vaguely tell that these light beams were related to the aptitude of the disciples. The disciples who were taken away by the seven-coloured beams obviously had the best aptitude, while the three-coloured beams represented lower levels of talent.

The Ancestor’s means were truly marvellous!

Everyone in Void World could clearly see the strange Void Dao Temple and the commotion in Seven Stars Sect.

The Emperor Realm Masters, who had just returned to their residences, were also stunned. They had no idea what Seven Stars Sect was up to now.

There were also some who were secretly anxious. Miao Fei Ping had said that the Void Dao Temple contained the 3,000 Grand Daos, the ultimate truth of the Martial Dao, and the mysteries above the Emperor Realm. Naturally, they were also looking forward to it; however, the matter of the Void Dao Temple was too strange. Many people suspected that it was Seven Stars Sect’s ploy, so for now, they wanted to get a clear picture of the situation before deciding what to do.

But now, Seven Stars Sect had already started moving. If Miao Fei Ping had told the truth, and the Void Dao Temple was really bestowed by the World and Seven Stars Sect would gain an advantage by acting first. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Seven Stars Sect was already the most powerful Sect, and now that they had entered the Void Dao Temple before all others, everyone was worried about who would be able to compete with them in the future.
