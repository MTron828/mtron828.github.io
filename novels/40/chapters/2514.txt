The thought of never accepting defeat lingered in Yang Kai‚Äôs mind. He researched the blue stone day and night, neglecting everything else.

At the very beginning, Zhang Ruo Xi, who lived next door, would come over to see Yang Kai from time to time, wanting to ask when they were leaving Purple Mountain City. However, as time passed, she assumed that Yang Kai‚Äôs seclusion meant that he was cultivating something of importance, so she dared not bother him.

Bored, and with nothing to do, she decided to leave the inn to take a walk around the city.

With her Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation, she was not afraid of wandering around, even if there were other cultivators in the same realm as her. During her walk, she found something novel so she decided to pluck up the courage to give it a try and instantly fell in love with it. During this period when Yang Kai was still researching the stone in retreat, she would go to this location everyday, and stayed there for a long time before returning to the inn.

Time flew and one month soon passed.

At a certain moment, Yang Kai took a deep breath, lifted his head with a face as tranquil as an ancient well, and withdrew his Divine Sense from the stone.

Blood vessels were prominently covering both of Yang Kai‚Äôs eyes, as if he was dreadfully exhausted, but his gaze was still bright like the stars.

After a month of sleepless research, Yang Kai finally absorbed all the mysteries contained in the stone. He witnessed Li Wu Yi‚Äôs growth with his own eyes and gained a lot from it.

He had made a huge step forward in the attainments of the Dao of Space.

Only now did he realize that the various Space Secret Techniques that he had comprehended previously were imperfect and there was still room for improvement. Yang Kai was ecstatic; being able to improve meant that he could still enhance the power of his own Space Secret Techniques, which was exactly what he needed now.

As an Emperor Realm Master, he would definitely encounter stronger enemies in the future. Space Techniques had always been one of his most important weapons, so any enhancement to them was of pivotal importance.

*Kacha!*

The blue stone in his hand suddenly broke apart and turned into dust, slipping through Yang Kai‚Äôs finger like a pile of sand.

The stone was packed with countless Void Cracks and a tiny black hole. During the process of researching, Yang Kai unceasingly released his Divine Sense to investigate the stone and it had finally reached its limit.

Fortunately, Yang Kai had absorbed all the essence that Li Wu Yi left in the stone, and felt no regrets at it being broken.

Suddenly, Yang Kai slapped his forehead and muttered, ‚ÄúOh no!‚Äù

He has just realized that he was too engrossed in the mysteries of the Dao of Space and had completely forgotten about the time and the initial purpose of coming here.

After calculating the days, Yang Kai was surprised that one month had passed during this retreat.

He hurriedly released his Divine Sense to inform Zhang Ruo Xi to get ready to leave Purple Mountain City with him.

However, the room next door was empty.

There was still a cup of hot tea on the table, producing steam.

With a flicker, Yang Kai leapt across space and appeared directly in the next room. He felt the temperature of the cup of tea with his hand and muttered to himself, ‚ÄúShe should have left not too long ago. Where did that little girl go?‚Äù

He had spent one month in retreat, so it was natural for Zhang Ruo Xi to go out for a walk.

But since he confirmed that she was not in danger, Yang Kai was not too worried.

He released his Divine Sense, and enveloped the entire Purple Mountain City in the blink of an eye.

Shortly after, Yang Kai found the figure of Zhang Ruo Xi on a high platform in the city, but her figure was moving around vigorously.

‚ÄúHuh‚Ä¶‚Äù Yang Kai was bewildered. After a thought, he dropped some Source Crystals on the table for the inn fees and teleported out of the room.

Subsequently, Yang Kai‚Äôs figure reappeared beside a fighting arena in Purple Mountain City, named Rising Dragon Arena.

Except for a few cultivators nearby, no one noticed his sudden appearance.

They glanced at him with a puzzled look but immediately turned away afterwards.

This arena was well built; it was surrounded by light curtain barriers, allowing the cultivators to fully enjoy the fights within.

Such arenas existed in many cities. Every cultivator strived to improve themselves, and where there was camaraderie, there was often also hatred, and it was natural that conflicts would arise.

If it was in the wild, cultivators would just fight to the death and the winners would trample on the losers.

But in a place like a city, one could not simply take others‚Äô lives unless it was unlawfully.

Each city had its own set of rules. Without rules, there would be chaos. Although Purple Mountain City was located on the edge of a desert, it was still inevitable that there would be conflicts between the cultivators in the city. In order to settle their conflicts, they could go to the arena, sign a consent form and fight with each other to the death.

Furthermore, one could compete with others in the arena even if there were no grudges between them.

As time passed, the arena gradually became a recreational place for various cultivators. Cultivators would compete with each other to improve their fighting ability in the arena.

For those who did not fight on the stage, they could still watch the battle from the seats around and learn from the experience.

When Yang Kai arrived, the seats in Rising Dragon Arena were all occupied, and many were without a seat. The cultivators who had no place to sit simply watched the battles in the arena while standing around the edges.

At least tens of thousands of people gathered here, all of them completely absorbed in the competition between two cultivators who were currently fighting with each other in the arena. Cheers and hurrahs rose from the audience from time to time, other times expletives and jeers were hurled.

A battle between normal cultivators would never attract such a large audience. Only the battles of those cultivators with high prestige and great reputation would attract the interest of tens of thousands of people. ùíÇll new stùíêries at n0ve/lbi/ùíè(.)cùíêm

At this moment, one of the two competitors in the arena was Zhang Ruo Xi.

However, unlike the soft and weak image that she usually presented in front of Yang Kai, Zhang Ruo Xi seemed more independent and resilient now, revealing the delicate curves of her well-developed body with her hair tied up behind her head, giving her a vigorous look.

Her aura was extremely ferocious, like a beast released from a cage, permeating a malevolent spirit all over her body.

Her opponent was a middle-aged man, who also had Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation. The middle-aged man had cultivated some unknown Secret Technique that shrouded himself in a blood-red radiance, giving him a strong and domineering appearance.

The both of them were fighting fiercely in the arena. Loud clangs erupted with each collision of their Source Qi, and the barriers surrounding the arena flashed crazily from the fallout of their attacks.

This little girl from the Zhang Family actually came to a fighting arena.

If Yang Kai did not see it with his own eyes, he would not have believed it.

Where did her courage come from? She was the kind of girl who blushed even when talking to a stranger, so since when did she have the guts to come to this kind of place and be in the spotlight of such a large crowd?

Furthermore, her aura was completely different from usual, which seriously concerned Yang Kai. Yang Kai understood that Zhang Ruo Xi‚Äôs Bloodline Power was profound, and all her changes were related to that bloodline.

Her opponent seemed to be a powerful and famous character in Purple Mountain City. Otherwise, how could he attract such a large audience?

As expected, when Yang Kai was secretly speculating, he overheard some comments from the crowd.

‚ÄúToday is pitting a dragon against a tiger, I wonder who will win in the end!‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no doubt about it, the winner will definitely be Bloody Hand Gu Shan. Although Gu Shan doesn‚Äôt hail from a Sect, he has been dominating Purple Mountain City for fifty years with a notably high reputation and strength, especially in the arena. He defeated all his enemies who challenged him and has never lost a single match until now. He is like a golden signboard of Purple Mountain City.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow could a Sect-less cultivator reach the Third-Order Dao Source Realm? This Gu Shan is really amazing. If he ever joins a big Sect, wouldn‚Äôt it be just around the corner for him to break through to the Emperor Realm?‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh heh, I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt know about this. I heard that Gu Shan found an ancient cave mansion in the Purple Mountain Range and obtained an extremely mysterious inheritance, that‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt need to join any Sect. A few years ago, a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator from Ahan Temple passed by here and had a conflict with Gu Shan. The two of them fought in the arena, and guess what?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat else could it be? Gu Shan won! He completely beat the senses out of the cultivator from Ahan Temple and knocked him out of the arena in less than ten moves.‚Äù

‚ÄúTsk‚Ä¶ Is Gu Shan that strong? Even a disciple of Ahan Temple was no match for him?‚Äù

Ahan Temple was one of the top Sects of the Eastern Territory, its status second only to the Serene Soul Palace. The cultivators who came from such a Sect were undoubtedly strong, let alone an elite disciple with a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation.

‚ÄúOf course! Since he defeated that elite disciple from Ahan Temple a few years ago, his strength seems to have improved greatly in the following years. How hard would it be for him to take down this weak little girl? Why do you think there are so many spectators here? Everyone came here for Gu Shan‚Äôs reputation.‚Äù

‚ÄúWeak little girl?‚Äù Another person snorted, ‚ÄúFriend is really funny. Do you dare call her a ‚Äòweak little girl‚Äô directly in front of the Asura Girl? If you dare, I will call you my ancestor.‚Äù

‚ÄúAhem ahem‚Ä¶‚Äù The Gu Shan fan coughed so hard that he almost cried.

‚ÄúAsura Girl?‚Äù Someone turned to the speaker after hearing this unfamiliar name and questioned in a confused manner, ‚ÄúIs this young lady famous?‚Äù

The third person glanced at him and asked, ‚ÄúFriend, are you new to Purple Mountain City?‚Äù

That man grinned, ‚ÄúI arrived three days ago. I heard that there are a lot of opportunities in Purple Mountain Range, so I came here to try my luck and was just in time for this event, so I just joined the crowd.‚Äù

‚ÄúThree days, no wonder you have no idea about her,‚Äù the third person nodded lightly, ‚ÄúThe lady in the arena is not simple. I don‚Äôt know her real name but everyone calls her the Asura Girl.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs she strong?‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄòStrong‚Äô is an understatement!‚Äù The third person snorted coldly, ‚ÄúShe is invincible! She suddenly appeared in the arena twenty days ago and beat the life out of a cultivator in the same realm as her. He was knocked out in just three moves, coughing up a pool of blood. Her moves were simple but brutal.‚Äù

‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt that‚Ä¶ a crushing victory?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. It was crushing alright!‚Äù
