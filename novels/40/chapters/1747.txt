“Someone wants to go with me? Who?” Yang Kai frowned. He hadn’t heard anything about this beforehand.

Gu Jian Xin glanced to the side and after following his line of sight, Yang Kai saw three familiar faces.

“Young Master Yang!” Yue Xi walked over slowly and stood not far away.

“Big Brother Yang,” He Zao and He Miao also called out cheerfully.

Yang Kai looked at Gu Jian Xin, who shrugged his shoulders and smiled, “I’ve expelled them from Sword Union. As the Young Union Master, I have such rights.”

Yang Kai’s expression changed.

“Then, I asked them what they plan to do in the future, and they all said they wanted to follow you. I wonder if you’d be willing to take them in?” Gu Jian Xin added with a grin.

“Many thanks for your kindness, Brother Gu,” Yang Kai said seriously.

With his shrewdness, how could Yang Kai not notice that Gu Jian Xin was doing him a favour? After all, he was just a lone wanderer on Azure Tree Star, and although he was strong, there were always some matters that would be inconvenient for Yang Kai to handle in person, so having competent assistants was a necessity.

With Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao following him, the situation would be different. Some of the trivial matters that needed to be attended to could be left to them, and if it was ever inconvenient for Yang Kai to handle something personally, he could ask one of these three to manage it.

This move also spared Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao from enduring some awkward situations in Sword Union in the future. As Yang Kai said before, after the matter regarding Qin Qi Yang was dealt with in such a manner, Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao would find it difficult to remain in Sword Union. No matter where they went, they would be accused of ingratitude.

Now that they had been expelled from Sword Union though, this would no longer be an issue.

Gu Jian Xin was a sharp individual and was trying to make the best impression he could on Yang Kai, so he had not hesitated to make this move.

This was a kindness to him, so Yang Kai naturally had no reason to refuse.

Turning to Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao, Yang Kai asked solemnly, “Are you willing to follow me?”

“As long as the Young Lord is willing to give us shelter, this Yue Xi is willing to do her best to serve him!” Yue Xi quickly replied.

“We are willing!” The two sisters said in unison.

“Good, then from now on, you will follow me,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Many thanks, Young Lord!” Yue Xi elegant bowed, her face overflowing with joy.

“Little brother...” Luo Lan, who was standing next to him, only spoke up now and said, “As for the Space Spirit Crystals you need, for the time being, this Queen is unable to gather much, but she will do her best to collect some and have them sent to you later. Would that be acceptable?”

“En, I’ll have to trouble Senior with this matter then.”

After Yang Kai chose Twin Shark Island as his site, he asked Gu Jian Xin and Luo Lan to acquire a large amount of Space Spirit Crystals for him, but these things were too scarce, so Luo Lan was unable to acquire a large quantity of them in such a short span of time. However, with her promise, Yang Kai was assured he would get some sooner or later.

Afterwards, Yang Kai took Yue Xi, He Mao, and He Zao, summoned his Star Shuttle, and left the Azure Tree Palace.

Gu Jian Xin and the others watched Yang Kai leave before returning to the palace.

Going to Twin Shark Island would take half a month despite using the Space Arrays on Azure Tree Star.

Fortunately, Yang Kai had the token given to him by Luo Lan, and with it, all the Space Arrays of the major cities on Azure Tree Star were open to him.

Following the route given to him by Luo Lan, Yang Kai travelled through various Space Arrays for half a month before arriving at Twin Shark Island.

Although Twin Shark Island was remote, it still had a Space Array used to connect with the outside world, and when the figures of Yang Kai and his group appeared on the platform, the cultivator responsible for guarding this place immediately came forward and swept his eyes over them before performing his routine duties, “Travelers, what business do you have here on Twin Shark Island?”

Yang Kai glanced at him and found that this person was only a Third-Order Saint King while the other cultivators responsible for guarding this place also were not very strong.

From the level of these cultivators, it could be inferred that the total strength of Twin Shark Island was not very high.

Yang Kai did not answer directly and instead took out the token given to him and showed it to this guard.

“What’s this?” The cultivator’s eyes narrowed slightly as a blank expression appeared on his face.

“You don’t know?” Yang Kai frowned, “Well, it doesn’t matter if you don’t know what it is, what is your Island Master’s name and where is he? Take me to see him.”

The cultivator was shocked by Yang Kai’s aggressive questioning and domineering attitude. Although he did not recognize what this token represented, he could faintly guess that Yang Kai had a powerful background.

Immediately fixing his previous careless attitude, he replied suspiciously, “Island Master’s name is Zhu Liang. Dare I ask where these friends come from and how they know Sir Island Master?”

Before Yang Kai could answer, Yue Xi coldly snorted, “Are you qualified to ask about my Young Lord’s identity? Hurry up and lead the way!”

As she spoke, she intentionally released a bit of her Shi, causing the guard to change in complexion and realize that this man and three women were not people he could contend with. As such, he quickly bowed and guided them.

This was another advantage of having confident subordinates. Yue Xi speaking up there would raise Yang Kai’s identity and status and avoid some troublesome inquiries.

Yang Kai shot Yue Xi an approving look, to which the latter responded with a smile.

The strength of Twin Shark Island’s Island Master Zhu Liang was not very high, only First-Order Origin Returning Realm. On such a remote island, it was quite rare for powerful cultivators to appear.

After Yang Kai showed him the token and Luo Lan’s handwritten note, Zhu Liang immediately acknowledged Yang Kai as this place’s new master.

Being able to assume command of Twin Shark Island so smoothly satisfied Yang Kai greatly.

“En, you will remain as Island Master in the future, and you will manage Twin Shark Island as before. I will not interfere in any of your affairs. If there are any problems you cannot handle, you can inform Lady Yue and she will convey it to me.”

“I understand!” Seemingly realizing Yang Kai was easy to get along with, Zhu Liang gradually became less nervous.

“Island Master Zhu...”

“I am just a subordinate,” Zhu Liang responded quickly, “Sir should simply call this Zhu Liang by his name.”

Yang Kai gently nodded, “Okay, tell me about the situation on Twin Shark Island.”

“Understood!” Zhu Liang gathered his thoughts for a moment before explaining, “Twin Shark Island is approximately one hundred thousand kilometres across and has fairly rich World Energy; however, it doesn’t produce any notable resources, making supplies a slight problem. Currently, there are roughly two hundred thousand residents on the island. The average cultivation level here is not high. Despite his lack of talent, your subordinate here is actually the strongest master on Twin Shark Island at the First-Order Origin Returning Realm. In addition to me, there are three other First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators on the island who serve as the Deputy Island Master and Elders. This lowly one has set up an Elder Council to manage the matters of Twin Shark Island with several elders...”

“Five hundred thousand kilometres east of Twin Shark Island there is a city which is connected via Space Array. In the surrounding million-kilometre region, there are many other islands with similar situations to Twin Shark Island, and the relationship between the islands is fairly peaceful with only occasional contact. The biggest danger here comes from sea beasts. Every year, sea beasts will attack the island, resulting in much damage and loss of life; however, Twin Shark Island will certainly be much safer and more peaceful in the future with Sir here!”

While explaining, Zhu Liang also took the opportunity to flatter Yang Kai.

Yang Kai paid this no mind though.

Zhu Liang continued, “The biggest output of Twin Shark Island and the nearby islands are the Monster Cores from sea beasts. Every year, many foreign cultivators come to Twin Shark Island to hunt these sea beasts...”

After half an hour of questioning, Yang Kai had a cursory understanding of the situation on Twin Shark Island.

Overall, he was quite satisfied with this place and found it very suitable for his next plan. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

However, he needed to find an appropriate location before implementing that plan.

Yang Kai decided to handle this personally.

After dismissing Zhu Liang, Yang Kai assigned Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao some tasks before flying off on his Star Shuttle alone to investigate the terrain of Twin Shark Island.

This survey took Yang Kai eight days to complete.

In the end, Yang Kai chose an area in the southeast that was close to the sea and had excellent scenery. Most importantly though, there was a large amount of open space here with few traces of cultivators ever visiting.

Yang Kai found Zhu Liang again and asked him to recruit some cultivators from Twin Shark Island to build a palace there.

Yang Kai naturally was not going to let others work in vain and offered Saint Crystals as payment.

Would Zhu Liang refuse this golden opportunity? Even if Yang Kai did not pay, he would still do his best to fulfil Yang Kai’s request.

There were two hundred thousand people on Twin Shark Island, so Zhu Liang casually gave an order to recruit a thousand people and had them begin constructing a large palace at the place Yang Kai designated.

The cultivators began immediately and worked at an incredibly fast pace. Within half a month, a magnificent palace was built that stretched across a more than ten-kilometre-wide area.

Zhu Liang even paid out of his own pocket to add some furniture and decorations to the palace.

Once it was finished, Yang Kai moved in with Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao.

The palace was huge and seemed quite quiet and lonely with only four people inside of it.

Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao did not understand why Yang Kai had built such a huge palace here, but knowing it wasn’t their place to ask, they simply obeyed his instructions and served him with dedication.

That night, Yang Kai called them into his room.

“What orders does Young Lord have for us?” Yue Xi asked curiously.

“It’s nothing so serious. Have a seat first,” Yang Kai motioned to them.

After the three women were seated, Yang Kai continued, “Since you have chosen to follow me in the future, then I will not mistreat you. Having said so, I will inform you now that I have a Sect called High Heaven Sect, of which I am the Sect Master. The Sect’s headquarters is on a very remote Cultivation Star. Would you like to join High Heaven Sect?”

The Master and Disciples glanced at each other before looking at Yang Kai and without hesitation nodding together, “Of course we would.”

“En, then from now on, you are members of High Heaven Sect,” Yang Kai smiled and said, “The Sect headquarters is a long way away, so you won’t have an opportunity to visit it in the short term, but rest assured, a day will come when I bring you to see it. High Heaven Sect... in the future, it will not be weak.”
