At that instant, Yang Kai felt that his Small Universe had become closely knitted and impenetrable.

He already had a World Spring, one of the Four Universe Pillars, which protected his Small Universe from any external influences. When dealing with powerful enemies, his Small Universe wouldn’t be impacted one bit regardless of the difference between their strength unless the disparity was insurmountable. Now that he possessed the World Tree, his Small Universe became even firmer.

It surprised him to learn that the World Tree had the same effects as the Four Universe Pillars.

Such a notion never crossed his mind before. He had a feeling that even without the World Spring, he still wouldn’t be invaded by Black Ink Strength, for he now had the World Tree inside his Small Universe. This clone was also able to protect and stabilize his Small Universe, possibly to a greater extent than even the World Spring.

In that case, he could let someone else have the World Spring so that there would be one more powerful Master who wouldn’t need to fear Black Ink Strength. If one of the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters could acquire the World Spring, he wouldn’t have to worry about anything when dealing with the Black Ink Clan.

Besides that, Yang Kai soon realised another benefit of the World Tree.

The World Tree was now closely connected to every corner of his Small Universe. Like a living creature, every time the tree breathed, it would affect his Small Universe as his World Force would be refined. Although the effects wouldn’t be conspicuous in the short term, his World Force would undoubtedly become purer in the long term.

In other words, Yang Kai would be able to unleash more powerful attacks even though he would be using the same amount of World Force.

There were already innumerable living creatures inside his Small Universe to begin with and the flow of time was four times faster than the outside world. Even if Yang Kai never cultivated, the increase of his heritage would still be on par with any other cultivators; hence, he didn’t have to worry about increasing his heritage.

With the World Tree in his possession now, the quality of his heritage would also be improved.

Quality and quantity of World Force were what determined whether an Open Heaven Realm Master was strong or weak. If both measures of a person could surpass those of the cultivators of the same generation, the achievements he or she would make in the future would be unimaginable.

Other than the conspicuous benefits that Yang Kai would enjoy, the Humans inside his Small Universe would also benefit from the World Tree’s nourishment. In fact, the instant the World Tree became connected to his Small Universe, all the Emperor Realm Masters from the major Sects could feel that a great transformation had taken place in the Void Continent; however, they couldn’t tell what the transformation was despite instinctively looking in the World Tree’s direction.

With the World Tree’s nourishment, countless geniuses started appearing in the Star Boundary generation after generation. Certainly, the same thing would happen to the Humans living inside Yang Kai’s Small Universe. Due to the quicker flow of time, the effects would be seen in just several dozen years.

By then, Yang Kai could select talented people from his Small Universe and let them cultivate in Blue Sky Pass. Even if his Grand Daos were not suitable for these people, there were a lot of powerful Masters from the Cave Heavens and Paradises in Blue Sky Pass that could teach them. When these geniuses ascended to the Open Heaven Realm, they would be a considerable force when dealing with the Black Ink Clan.

In other words, his Small Universe had practically become the second Star Boundary as it was also an Open Heaven Realm Cradle now.

These were the benefits of the World Tree he was currently aware of. However, Yang Kai had a feeling that a wonderful treasure like a World Tree clone would have even more uses. He just hadn’t discovered the other benefits yet. Regardless, he could only take things slowly. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

In a joyful mood, Yang Kai examined his Small Universe one more time, and upon making sure that there were no problems, he slowly opened his eyes.

Right then, he saw several burly figures staring at him in silence. They were none other than Zhong Liang and the other Army Commanders.

He had no idea when they arrived at this place, but it was apparent that they hurriedly came over upon detecting some kind of anomaly.

Yang Kai replied respectfully, “Everything is fine. I’ve fully isolated the World Tree’s clone from the Sealed World and it is now closely integrated with my Small Universe.”

Ding Yao arched his brow, “Are there any benefits so far?”

After giving it a thought, Yang Kai replied, “I’ve detected three benefits so far. First of all, the World Tree’s clone has the same effects as the Four Universe Pillars. It might even be superior to them. With the clone around, my Small Universe has become completely impervious to outside influence.” At this point, he cupped his fist, “Sirs, since I have the World Tree’s clone with me, I no longer need the World Spring. I’m willing to let someone else have it for the greater good of the Human race.”

Upon hearing that, the Army Commanders exchanged glances as they were evidently surprised. They had never expected that the World Tree’s clone had the same effects as the Four Universe Pillars. They wouldn’t have found out about it if Yang Kai never told them.

With a frown, Zhong Liang said, “That’s very generous of you, but are you sure the clone can resist the Black Ink Strength after you lose the World Spring? If you can’t resist the influence of the Black Ink Strength after giving up your World Spring, you’ll never be able to leave Blue Sky Pass again.”

Yang Kai replied, “Although I’m unable to verify it, the clone can indeed protect my Small Universe from any external influences. Its protection feels even sturdier than the World Spring’s. Even if what you’ve said is true, I’ll just stay inside Blue Sky Pass, so that I won’t come into contact with the Black Ink Clan.”

Zhong Liang chuckled, “Good, don’t forget what you’ve said.” He would rather let Yang Kai stay in Blue Sky Pass forever to ensure his safety so that he wouldn’t have to worry about him whenever the latter left the Inner Sanctum.

“In any case, there’s no rush to handle this issue. Even though you’re willing to give up the World Spring, we’ll need to have a discussion on who will take it over. Moreover, after you lose the World Spring, your Small Universe will no longer be complete. By then, you’ll have to consume a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit to repair your Small Universe. All of that takes time.”

“I’ll leave the details up to you, Sirs.”

The issue of giving up the World Spring was set aside for now, so Liang Yu Long asked, “What is the second benefit?”

Yang Kai replied, “The second benefit is that the clone is able to refine my World Force. With the clone in possession, the World Force in my Small Universe will become increasingly pure.”

“That’s a wonderful benefit!” Ding Yao tutted. Given Yang Kai’s current strength, he was already peerless among the cultivators in the same Order. If the heritage in his Small Universe could be further refined, his strength would be significantly enhanced. In time, not only would he be more powerful than all other cultivators in the same Order, but he would also be able to fight against cultivators that were an Order above him.

After pondering on it for a moment, Zhong Liang said, “Even though the benefit is amazing, it won’t have any conspicuous effects in the short term.”

With that said, Open Heaven Realm Masters enjoyed a very long life. As a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, time was on Yang Kai’s side.

“The third benefit has nothing to do with me, but it is still significant. There are many Humans currently living in my Small Universe. With the World Tree’s nourishment, many rare talents and geniuses will start appearing within two or three generations.”

Upon hearing that, Liang Yu Long was surprised and confused, “What kind of talents and geniuses are you talking about?”

Yang Kai explained, “Sir may not be aware of it yet, but there is also a World Tree clone planted in my homeland, the Star Boundary. A few hundred years ago, I planted it there because my homeworld was at risk of collapsing after suffering too much damage in a great war. I only wanted to save my homeworld by planting the World Tree there, but to my surprise, several generations later, the average aptitude of the cultivators living in the Star Boundary had improved dramatically. The Cave Heavens and Paradises have all set up Dao Temples there to take on more disciples and raise some of their own from outside the Star Boundary. Before I came to the Black Ink Battlefield, there were already a lot of talented youths who had the aptitude to directly ascend to the Sixth-Order and even the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm.”

“Directly ascending to the Seventh Order?” All the Army Commanders were astonished.

If a person directly ascended to the Seventh Order, it meant that their upper limit would be the Ninth Order. If such a person wasn’t accidentally killed, they had a chance to become an Old Ancestor.

“And you say there are many such people?” Zhong Liang asked in a solemn tone.

Yang Kai nodded, “There are many who are able to directly ascend to the Sixth Order. Though only a small number of people can directly make it to the Seventh Order, I suppose every Cave Heaven and Paradise will have at least one to two such people every 1,000 years. In the past, there had been some commotion as the Cave Heavens and Paradises tried to take on disciples in my homeworld.”

Even though they were all in the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm, they couldn’t help but gasp upon hearing that.

Now, every Cave Heaven and Paradise had one to two such geniuses in Yang Kai’s homeland within the same time frame. That was truly inconceivable.

It would suggest that several thousand years later, there would be an additional 100 to 200 Old Ancestors.

When these powerful cultivators arrived on the Black Ink Battlefield, they would send a shockwave across the Black Ink Clan.

These Army Commanders were stunned as they could envision the bright future ahead of them. When the time came, with so many powerful Human cultivators around, they might be able to destroy the Black Ink Clan once and for all.

Yang Kai went on to say, “The population in my Small Universe is not comparable to my homeworld, so there wouldn’t be a lot of geniuses being born right away. With that said, there would still be quite a number of them. I plan to let them ascend to the Emperor Realm in my Small Universe first, then they can continue cultivating in the Inner Sanctum until they make it to the Open Heaven Realm.”

Zhong Liang and the others finally came to their senses and Ding Yao promptly said, “By then, you have to look for a young person with an outstanding aptitude for me. This King will personally teach them.”

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “That person will be extremely lucky to have Commander Yao’s personal guidance.”

Zhong Liang coughed, “I’ll reserve one as well.”

Liang Yu Long and Shen Tu Mo exchanged glances, and then expressed that Yang Kai must not be biased. They would have to take on their own Disciples as well.

Certainly, Yang Kai wouldn’t object to it.

All of a sudden, Zhong Liang said in a solemn voice, “Yang Kai, since this is a matter of those living inside your Small Universe, you have to address the issue of the small population. Since the World Tree’s nourishment can enhance the Humans’ aptitude, it’s certainly better to have more Humans inside your Small Universe so that there will be even more talents.”

Shen Tu Mo nodded repeatedly, “That’s right.”

Yang Kai was torn between tears and laughter, “How am I supposed to resolve the issue of a lack of population?”
