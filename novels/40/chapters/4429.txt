They were unable to see clearly in the mist, and even their Divine Senses were greatly restricted. Also, there seemed to be a great danger lurking in the mist, waiting to burst out.

Rumbling sounds were suddenly heard as a world-shaking force undulated. The force far surpassed the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm and reached the Sixth-Order in scale.

Other than the Old Ancestor who had been in seclusion for a long time, Golden Rainbow Province didn’t have Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. The reason they were able to unleash such an attack was that they had made use of the Grand Array.

Exclamations were heard as some of the cultivators from Void Land, who were inside the mist, were struck. Some of the Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters were instantly killed due to negligence.

As the Grand Array’s power blossomed, Yang Kai sported a solemn expression and released his Divine Sense. The next instant, his expression changed drastically as he yelled, “There are some weird creatures in the mist. Be careful!”

He could detect that there were a lot of tiny insects hiding in the mist that were not visible to the eye. While they were unsuspecting, these insects snuck into their bodies through the pores and began draining their Blood Essence.

As Yang Kai spoke, he surged his Golden Crow’s True Fire. In an instant, a layer of black flame started burning around his figure as though he had turned into a fireball, illuminating a radius of 1,000 metres around himself.

Crackling sounds were continuously heard as the Golden Crow’s True Fire burned the tiny insects in the mist.

Yang Kai flew forward, and wherever he went, the insects were instantly killed. However, due to the fact that his Divine Sense had been restricted, he was unable to find out the enemies’ whereabouts. At the same time, he had to be careful not to accidentally hurt his companions, so his movements were rather restricted.

It wasn’t until this moment that he had a taste of what the Hundred Sects Alliance went through when they barged into the Bewildering Array of Nine Heavenly Layers, and it was certainly awful.

Although the Grand Array of Golden Rainbow Province wasn’t as abstruse as the Nine Heavenly Layers, there were indeed some similarities.

A Second Class great force like Golden Rainbow Province was able to ward off Yang Kai’s powerful subordinates using their accumulated heritage. In the entire 3,000 Worlds, basically every great force had their own Grand Array.

Now, Yang Kai realized if he rashly decided to invade a Sect’s Headquarters, he might still suffer a setback even though there was a huge gap in power between both parties.

The reason he was able to easily take down Boundless Altar some time ago was that they were unprepared for what was about to befall them. Before they could even activate their Grand Array, Yang Kai had broken through it and barged into the Sect. If Boundless Altar had prepared in advance and activated their Grand Array, there would have been an intense battle.

Rumbling sounds were continuously heard as more people shrieked, and it wasn’t certain whether it was the enemies or Yang Kai’s subordinates who were screaming.

Yang Kai was incensed as he had come with a large group of Open Heaven Realm Masters in an imposing manner. If he wasn’t even able to take down Golden Rainbow Province, he would become a laughing stock in the future. As he shook his figure, the Golden Crow was heard cawing.

A Great Sun leaped into the sky from behind him with a three-legged exotic bird seeming flying around within it.

In an instant, a dazzling Sun hung above the sky of Golden Rainbow Province. Regardless of how thick the mist was, it was unable to block out the Sunlight.

Under the scorching Sunlight, the mist instantly evaporated, and the tiny insects hidden within were all killed.

Golden Crow Casts the Sun was a Divine Manifestation that Yang Kai had comprehended that was extremely powerful. In order not to accidentally hurt his companions, he was unable to fully activate its power; therefore, he had been careful when using it.

Despite that, after the mist dissipated, many of his subordinates were seen with reddened faces, and their skin that was exposed to the air was covered in blisters. The weaker cultivators were more severely affected while cultivators in the Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm and above were less impacted.

With the mist gone, they were able to see their enemies clearly.

Certainly, Mao Zhe and the others, who were quite frustrated already, wouldn’t miss this opportunity and instantly charged towards the exposed Array Nodes.

Soon, people were heard shrieking as the disciples of Golden Rainbow Province, who were in charge of the Array Nodes, were completely powerless to stop Mao Zhe and the others and were directly killed.

In just over ten breaths of time, the Grand Array of Golden Rainbow Province was completely destroyed.

On the main Spirit Peak, Chang Qi Shui shuddered in fear as though he had been struck by lightning. He watched as the disciples were slaughtered, but there was nothing he could do to help them. He let out a sigh, thinking that Golden Rainbow Province would be destroyed on this day if the Old Ancestor still didn’t appear.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai had retracted Golden Crow Casts the Sun as he stared coldly at Chang Qi Shui, his eyes filled with murderous intent.

Without moving his figure, he raised his hand and pushed out his palm towards Chang Qi Shui.

He had given the other party a chance. If those from Golden Rainbow Province gave up on resisting like those from Boundless Altar had done, he wouldn’t have decided to kill them ruthlessly. Since they were still so obstinate though, they only had themselves to blame.

Faced with the pressure from a Sixth-Order’s Open Heaven Realm Master, Chang Qi Shui was forced to lower his figure as he felt the aura of death engulfing him.

Just then, Yang Kai suddenly narrowed his eyes and balled up his fist instead as he summoned his Azure Dragon Spear then thrust it out.

Before the spear even reached Chang Qi Shui, a slender hand abruptly appeared in front of him like a phantom. The fingers curled up, then nonchalantly flicked at the spear three times.

An immense force burst forth and Yang Kai felt as though a mountain had crashed into his spear. He almost lost grip of his weapon as his figure shook and moved backwards. His face had also turned pale.

At the same time, Mao Zhe and the others noticed this and looked over in the direction where the slender hand appeared.

There a woman with a delicate brow and long hair that hung over her shoulders appeared. Her purple dress with a belt around the waist fluttered in the wind. She looked like she was about twenty-eight years old, which was the prime age for a woman. Her peaks were tall and her waist was slender.

If they came across such a woman somewhere else, they would have thought that she was a young woman who had just come of age.

However, presently, this woman was exuding an aura that no one could ignore. That was the aura of a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master!

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, “A Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master?”

Other than a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, no one else could so easily ward off his attack, and the woman’s aura proved his point. There was no doubt that she was a newly advanced Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

Yang Kai had previously gone through such a stage. After he ascended to the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm, he was unable to curb his aura since his cultivation hadn’t stabilized yet.

This young woman was in exactly the same situation.

Mao Zhe and the others sported solemn expressions as they exchanged glances in disbelief.

It was inconceivable that Golden Rainbow Province had a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master with them. They wouldn’t have believed it if they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes. At that instant, they felt their hearts sinking. Although she was clearly a newly promoted Seventh-Order Master, she was still a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master.

High-Rank and Mid-Rank were two completely different realms. It could be said that the gap between them was like the difference between the Heavens and Earth.

On the other hand, Chang Qi Shui had just escaped from death’s door as he fell into a dazed state for a moment. Then, he snapped out of his trance and widened his eyes before falling on one knee. With an excited expression, he said, “37th Sect Master of Golden Rainbow Province, Chang Qi Shui, greets Martial Ancestor Li!”

The person before his eyes was Old Ancestor Li Luo Shui, who started cultivating in seclusion 3,000 years ago.

The disciples of Golden Rainbow Province were dumbfounded. They initially had no idea who this young woman was, but upon hearing the Sect Master’s words, they were shocked to learn that she was their Old Ancestor.

It never crossed their mind that Golden Rainbow Province had such a powerful Master. At that instant, they were all energised as they fell on their knees and shouted, “Greetings, Martial Ancestor!”

Many men secretly examined the woman and thought that not only was the Old Ancestor alluring, but she also had an intoxicating figure. They couldn’t help but admire her, thinking that they could die with no regrets should such a woman actually become interested in them.

Without even turning her head, Li Luo Shui darted her gaze around and scanned the surroundings, then sighed, “I can’t believe Golden Rainbow Province has declined so much.”

...

An embarrassed Chang Qi Shui apologised, “I’m sorry for disappointing you, Martial Ancestor. I’m truly useless.”

Li Luo Shui scoffed, “All of you are indeed useless. Not only have you squandered away the heritage of our ancestors, but you also can’t even repel the enemies at our gates. Disgraceful!”

Chang Qi Shui was covered in cold sweat as he almost fell on all fours. Although the Old Ancestor looked like a sweet young girl, she clearly had no qualms about fiercely reprimanding them.

“I suppose I can’t blame it all on you though. Get up,” Li Luo Shui replied.

“Yes,” Chang Qi Shui answered before slowly getting to his feet. As he hid behind Li Luo Shui, he looked in Yang Kai’s direction as a sense of resentment flashed through his eyes, then he reported, “Martial Ancestor, it’s these people who are trying to destroy our Sect.”

Li Luo Shui shot a dispassionate glance at Yang Kai, then said, “Seven Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters and fifteen Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters… It’s no wonder that you can’t stave them off.”

Yang Kai stared at the young woman and asked, “What’s your name?”

Li Luo Shui replied impassively, “What point is there announcing this Queen’s name to a dead man?”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai was amused, “You’re pretty arrogant, aren’t you. Do you think you can definitely defeat us just because you’re a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master?”

Li Luo Shui replied, “Isn’t that the case? You won’t understand the difference between the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm and the Sixth-Order until you experience it yourself.”

Yang Kai asked, “Judging from your aura, you’ve just ascended to the Seventh-Order. I wonder how much strength you can actually use?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

...

Li Luo Shui let out a breath as her chest heaved, “All of you are bound for death since you’ve forced me to ascend to the Seventh-Order. If you don’t want to suffer, kill yourselves now. When this Queen makes a move, I’ll make you beg for death.”

“Shameless boasting!” Yang Kai yelled and pointed his spear forward, “I have never killed a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master before. I guess I’ll give it a try today!”

Li Luo Shui shot him a cold glance, “It’s the first time I’ve come across someone as reckless as you are.”

“Enough nonsense! Taste my spear!” Yang Kai bellowed and thrust out his weapon. He had no reservation as he infused all his strength into the spear. A thunderous Dragon Roar reverberated across the sky. A dazzling light glistened from the tip of the Azure Dragon Spear and as the Dragon Pressure erupted, a Great Dragon seemed to have come to life as it bared its fangs and brandished its claws.

At that instant, the entire world seemed to have paled as the spear became the only thing that shone brightly.
