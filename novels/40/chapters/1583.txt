Chapter 1583, Great Shame

“This little boy Xue Lian’s Flood Dragon Transformation has already reached the grand accomplishment level,” In Chi Yue’s chambers, she muttered to herself softly while observing the situation more and more intently.

As one of the Ten Great Tribal Lords, she would not run over to watch the excitement like Shan Qing Luo and Yu Xiong; such behaviour was beneath her status. However, with her powerful Divine Sense, secretly watching from afar was not a problem.

In all honesty, she had greatly appreciated the battle between Yang Kai and Xue Lian.

Xue Lian was the son of Blood Flood Dragon Tribal Lord, a successor personally cultivated by Blood Flood Dragon Tribal Lord, and the future master of the Blood Flood Dragon Territory, yet even with his powerful Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation, Xue Lian had failed to defeat Yang Kai.

If Yang Kai had been able to match an ordinary Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, he would already be a Heaven-sent genius, but his opponent was actually Xue Lian.

Chi Yue hadn’t expected that Yang Kai, as a human, could actually force Xue Lian to use his Flood Dragon Transformation in order to win a contest of raw physical power.

Even amongst the masters of the Monster Race, few people could accomplish this.

But Yang Kai was able to do so as a human!

This was unprecedented in Monster Emperor Star’s history. The Human Race cultivators on Monster Emperor Star were always suppressed by the Monster Race, especially when it came to cultivation resources, so humans even reaching the Origin Realm was extremely rare, let alone someone who could fight Blood Flood Dragon Tribal Lord’s favoured son head-on!

A look of shock filled Chi Yue’s face as she felt she had been mistaken before, and was unable to see Yang Kai’s true strength.

All that was left... was to determine what his accomplishments in other fields were like. If his overall strength was also as impressive, he would make a good enough match for Shan Qing Luo and Chi Yue wouldn’t have any reason to stand in the way of them becoming a couple.

If this was the case, not only would Shan Qing Luo feel relieved staying with her, but Chi Yue could also add another powerful supporter, achieving two goals with one stone.

After the incident with Ba He two hundred years ago, Chi Yue no longer dared object too forcefully, as she was afraid of pushing Shan Qing Luo away or even causing a repeat of that year’s mistakes.

“I hope you won’t disappoint this Queen!”

Thinking so, Chi Yue continued monitoring the battlefield with her Divine Sense, paying close attention to how the situation developed.

Outside the palace, Yang Kai frowned as he looked at Xue Lian strangely.

At this moment, Xue Lian gave off a terrifying aura and had an even more terrifying appearance, his skin covered in blood-red scales and his body radiating an ominous red light. With renewed fighting spirit, Xue Lian cast Yang Kai an indifferent look and laughed triumphantly, “Human, are you afraid now? If you are, it’s not too late to beg for mercy!”

“Do you only know how to talk big?” Yang Kai curled his lips as the strange expression on his face became stronger.

The moment Xue Lian used his Flood Dragon Transformation, Yang Kai felt a certain force in his body stir as if wanting to escape his control and rush out into the open.

This surprised him greatly.

After figuring out what exactly it was that was making him restless though, Yang Kai immediately relaxed.

Yang Kai didn’t allow this mysterious power to erupt, but instead suppressed it while simultaneously emitting a five coloured light, which seemed to possess its own spirituality, from his figure.

Yang Kai’s already powerful momentum soared upwards once more!

“What is this?” Ba He was shocked and quickly craned his neck towards Yang Kai.

“Damn, he really hasn’t been using his full strength! Isn’t he a bit too much of a freak?” Yu Xiong’s eyes were about to pop out of their sockets as a look of astonishment filled his face.

Mi Tian, ​​who had been watching from a distance, was also stunned. He thought that after Xue Lian showed his Flood Dragon Transformation, Yang Kai would immediately lose, but on the contrary, in the blink of an eye, Yang Kai also used a magical Secret Technique to increase his strength.

[The Human Race’s Secret Techniques are truly broad and profound!] Mi Tian was excited as he stared at Yang Kai without blinking, as if trying to figure out just what effect this strange five-coloured light possessed.

Streams of yellow, blue, white, red, and golden light wove together around Yang Kai, each one giving off a distinct aura; however, these five auras did not conflict with one another but instead were perfectly blended together.

Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi!

Yang Kai having such extremely high attainments in physical strength was first because he had a strong foundation and second he had refined a large amount of Life Revitalizing Jade Cream to replace most of his original blood with pure Golden Blood which had astonishing vitality.

Now, after cultivating the Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art, his physical strength had risen to a new height.

This was a heaven defying Body Tempering Secret Art.

When Yang Kai cultivated it, the five supreme elemental treasures he used were all of extremely high grade, so the effect was naturally remarkable.

Yang Kai had reached the minor accomplishment stage in the Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art now, so he could use it in battle!

Seeing Yang Kai shrouded in this five coloured light, Xue Lian was stunned for a moment, but soon he grinned fiercely, “Amazing! Human, it seems that you also have a trump card left to play; now, let’s see whose is stronger, yours or mine!”

As soon as his words fell, his figure flickered and transformed into a blood-red streak of light that blasted towards Yang Kai.

This red light, like a cloud of blood, descended directly on top of Yang Kai’s head, then split apart like a giant mouth that tried to engulf Yang Kai, swallowing him whole. A thick blood mist filled with a violent and malevolent aura filled the air and stimulated the base instincts in Yang Kai’s heart, causing his eyes to turn bloodshot.

Yang Kai gave a long exhale as he transformed the five-coloured rays of light around him into a kind of energy armour before concentrating a dazzling golden radiance onto his fists. In an instant, Yang Kai’s hands seemed to be covered with countless tiny golden needles. Clenching his fists, Yang Kai sent out a barrage of punches towards the approaching blood mist.

Of the Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qis, the Metal Attribute was the sharpest and possessed the strongest lethality.

The dense blood-red scale armour on Xue Lian’s body appeared very strong at first glance, so Yang Kai naturally intended to use his Metal Attribute Indestructible Sword Qi to counter-attack.

The masters who were paying attention to this battle overtly and secretly held their breaths at this moment, wondering who would emerge victorious between Yang Kai and Xue Lian after they had both used their Secret Techniques.

The result was shocking!

Instead of the intense struggle between two evenly matched opponents that had occurred before, this time, after Yang Kai and Xue Lian collided, Xue Lian immediately suffered a clear loss.

From inside the bloody light, Xue Lian roared fiercely while Yang Kai remained silent; however, everyone could detect that he was launching an intense and merciless assault.

Blood splashed out as broken scale-like objects were sent flying. Naturally these were Xue Lian’s blood scales.

Ba He’s eyes shrank.

It wasn’t until this moment that he finally realized he had been greatly mistaken before. Yang Kai’s accomplishments in Body Tempering and physical strength had surpassed the Blood Flood Dragon lineage which was famous for its tenacity and intrepidity.

In his mind, Ba He placed himself in Xue Lian’s position and tried to think of a way to resolve this immediate crisis if he was the latter.

The result of his analysis caused him to pale.

Helpless! He was absolutely helpless!

The true strength of this Second-Order Origin Returning Realm human wasn’t inferior to any master at the Third-Order; in fact, this body was fiercer than most Third-Orders! Even if Ba He were the one fighting him, he was likely the one who would be defeated in the end.

A fine sweat oozed from Ba He’s forehead as he groaned in his heart, completely dumbfounded as he wondered just where Yang Kai had come from.

Even if one searched the entire Star Field, they would likely not find a second genius of this level!

“Little Sister, which Cultivation Star did you say my brother-in-law came from?” Yu Xiong asked blankly.

“A backwards low-level star,” Shan Qing Luo smiled, “You wouldn’t know it even if I told you.”

[A low-level star...] Yu Xiong felt like he had lost the ability to think.

Could a human who emerged from a low-level star have such frightening strength? This monster was strong enough to make all the so-called geniuses of the Star Field commit suicide with grief.

“En, now can you make a report to Adoptive Mother? I believe Adoptive Mother will be very satisfied with this result,” Shan Qing Luo glanced at Yu Xiong, with a smile that could enthrall any living creature.

“I can...” Yu Xiong nodded repeatedly. If such a human was unable to satisfy their adoptive mother, then it was likely no one would ever be able to.

In this battle, this newfound brother-in-law of his had proven his strength to everyone.

Shan Qing Luo stopped talking and instead focused all her attention on the battle, immersing herself in Yang Kai’s overwhelming display of strength, unable to extricate herself.

After confirming that Yang Kai had the upper hand, she was no longer worried about him and instead began to appreciate the fight.

A fierce roar rang out suddenly as Xue Lian retreated from the engagement, his eyes flashing with horror as he stared at Yang Kai tremblingly.

His aura was sluggish, and many of his blood-red scales had been destroyed. Even the two horns on his forehead seemed to have become a little dim, no longer emitting the dazzling luster from before.

Shame! He was showing such a shameful display!

Being forced into this state by a human cultivator a Minor Realm lower than him was a stain Xue Lian would never be able to remove from his life!

He could not accept such a result.

On Monster Emperor Star, Xue Lian was famous and feared no cultivator beneath the Origin King Realm; he had not even put Mi Tian in his eyes, but now this human, with an unknown background, had forced him to suffer such a big loss. It was nothing short of a humiliation to him and his entire bloodline.

How could he accept it? How could he be willing to give up?

“Human, you’ve forced me to do this!” Xue Lian roared, and after speaking, a decisive expression appeared on his face as he spat out a round, blood-red bead from his mouth.

This round bead was about the size of a baby’s fist, and it contained a terrifying power. Vaguely, one could even see a tiny snake-like creature swimming about inside this blood read bead.

“Has Xue Lian gone mad!?” Yu Xiong was shocked as he screamed in disbelief, “He actually brought out his Monster Core!”

“Not good, Xue Lian is going all out!” A look of horror flashed across Ba He’s face and he hurriedly shouted, “Stop him!”

Saying so, he rushed towards the battlefield.

Shan Qing Luo seemed to have finally recovered as well and hurriedly followed after Ba He.

Monster Race cultivators, whether they were Monster Beasts that assumed human form, or were born in human form, each had a Monster Core in their body. A Monster Core was the most important treasure of a Monster Race and was tied directly to their life.

In battle, unless a Monster Race cultivator had no other recourse, would never summon their Monster Core, because once it was even slightly damaged, the consequences would be disastrous.
