If a Third-Order Origin King acted with all their strength, they could destroy a small Cultivation Star.

And in this region of the Starry Sky, a total of six Third-Order Origin Kings and one Second-Order Origin King were gathered. The seven of them taking action together, just how spectacular of a scene was that? If such a massive burst of energy were to be sent out, it could definitely vaporize everything within a million kilometres, turning this region of the Starry Sky into a shattered space.

But nothing close to that happened. The eight-pointed array formed by the gathering of all nine Star Emperor Tokens seemed to have transformed into some kind of bottomless pit at this moment, swallowing all the Saint Qi that these seven masters could pour out with ease.

Everyone’s complexion changed drastically as they realized that they had deeply underestimated the methods of the Great Emperor.

These Star Emperor Tokens were refined by the Great Emperor over ten thousand years ago, yet they still had such power even today. It was difficult to imagine just how astonishing the Great Emperor’s strength was.

Exchanging a quick glance, everyone silently understood what they needed to do and simultaneously pushed their strength even more fiercely into the formation.

As time passed, the light of the eight-pointed array became brighter and brighter, and the array itself also expanded out from its original washbasin size to become as big as a large dinner table.

By now, each of the Origin Kings wore a dignified expression as they madly poured out their Saint Qi like this was actually quite taxing on them.

However, they also felt somewhat inspired at the moment, because it had been many years for them since they had gone all out. Having stood at the pinnacle of the Star Field, who was qualified to make them exert their fullest?

The current eight-pointed array, this entrance, was a perfect target for them to let loose their strength!

Gu Cang Yun couldn’t help but laugh as he ignored the passing of his own strength and desperately squeezed out as much strength from his body as he could, as if trying to see where his limits were.

Naturally the others weren’t about to be outdone and each began using their own methods to add even more energy into the eight-pointed formation.

Some time later though, everyone’s expression became a bit difficult.

Because they found that even if they kept pushing their Saint Qi madly like this, there were no signs at all of the road to the Star Boundary opening. The only change that could be seen was that the eight-pointed array was steadily expanding.

All of them couldn’t help glancing over at Yang Kai, hoping to glean some clues from his face, but all they could see was his calm demeanour as he continued to pour out his strength at a rate and intensity no worse than anyone else present.

His composure allowed everyone to feel at ease and after each of them popped a restorative Spirit Pill into their mouths, they continued on.

This situation actually lasted for three days and three nights, and during this period, the several Origin Kings lost track of just how many pills they had taken in order to maintain their power. Finally, on the third day, a dull hum suddenly rang out from the Starry Sky.

The shining eight-pointed array suddenly expanded greatly at this moment before shrinking down to the size of a house and stabilizing in place.

As a profound and mysterious light flowed out from the eight-pointed array, it stood silently in the void like the open mouth of a great beast. As for the Star Emperor Tokens, they had all seemingly vanished.

Everyone withdrew their hands and stood staring at the entrance the eight-pointed array in front of them had transformed into, none of them able to say a word for a long time.

“Is this the passage?” After a long silence, Gui Zu finally asked. He could feel the power of the Void coming from this entrance, similar to that of a Void Corridor, but also completely different. It seemed far more dangerous, causing even someone as strong as him to feel some chills.

“Do we enter or not?” Gu Cang Yun swept his gaze around.

No one was able to give him an answer though.

Quickly, everyone’s eyes landed on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai frowned as he said, “I’m definitely going to enter, but... Let’s restore ourselves first.”

“Yang Kai is right,” Chi Yue nodded sincerely, “There may be some danger inside.”

“Then, we’ll take half a day to restore ourselves. None of us knows how long this entrance will remain open, so if we delay too long and it disappears, the benefits will not be able to make up for the loss,” Wu Dao said with some slight concern.

No one had any objections and quickly took out some Spirit Pills before finding a location to sit down, meditate, and recover.

Yang Kai directly took out a mountain of Saint Crystals from his Space Ring and crushed them, allowing their energy to flood the surrounding area to help everyone quickly restore themselves.

Half a day later, everyone gathered again in front of the entrance.

Yang Kai took the initiative without any fear and said, “Leave the vanguard up to this Junior, Seniors please bring up the rear!”

“How could we allow that?” Ai Ou snorted in objection. Yang Kai was his son-in-law, and as Xue Yue’s father, certainly couldn’t let Yang Kai take such risks. What if something happened? Wouldn’t that leave Xue Yue as a widow?

Saying so, he stepped forward, determined to enter first.

Yang Kai, however, quickly stretched out his hand to stop him and said lightly, “I am proficient in Space Force, and as this is a type of Void Corridor, it would be best if I take the lead.”

“Yang Kai is right. Ai Ou it’s best if you back down here, his mastery of Space Force makes him far more suited to this role,” Chi Yue nodded in agreement.

Ai Ou hesitated for a moment before nodding, “Then, act cautiously kid.”

Yang Kai smiled lightly at him before turning back to Long Tian Shang and saying, “Senior Long, I’ll have to trouble you to watch over Shadowed Star while we’re gone.”

“You may rest assured; I will come here from time to time. In any case, it’s quite convenient to travel around now. As long as my Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce has not fallen, Shadowed Star will surely be safe and sound!” Long Tian Shang quickly pledged.

“Many thanks, Senior!” Yang Kai cupped his fists before turning around and plunging into the entrance.

Following him, Gu Cang Yun, Wu Dao, and Gui Zu all stepped inside one by one.

Chi Yue followed suit.

Ai Ou bid farewell to Long Tian Shang before he brought up the rear.

In the blink of an eye, only Long Tian Shang was left. Staring at the glowing entrance before him, his eyes showed a look of incomparable yearning, but he simply sighed, turned around, and flew back towards Shadowed Star, in the end.

....

After Yang Kai crossed the threshold, he was immediately stunned by the sight in front of him.

He had expected that he would be greeted by the sight of a Void Corridor, an empty chaotic nothingness.

But on the contrary, when he walked inside, things were very different.

Instead of black chaos with vast emptiness, there was actually a rich and pure flow of mysterious energy.

There were also little fluorescent wisps of light all around, making people feel like they were being surrounded by an ocean of starlight. These wisps behaved almost like fireflies, moving as if they had their own sentience.

Looking around, to the front, rear, left, and right, everywhere was filled with a similar starlight scene.

It was really like staring at the starry sky reflecting on the calm surface of a lake.

Yang Kai couldn’t help taking a deep breath. Breathing out comfortably, it felt like the exhaustion he had built up over the past few days from opening the Star Boundary channel had simply faded away.

In the next instant, the little wisps of starlight were somehow drawn towards his body and soon sank into his form.

The pure energy contained in these wisps of starlight quickly began to penetrate into his flesh and bone, rapidly recovering Yang Kai’s strength.

Yang Kai was overjoyed, never having expected such a thing to happen.

“This is...” An exclamation came from behind, one filled with obvious shock from what the voice’s owner was seeing.

Yang Kai didn’t have to look back to know it was Sword Union’s Gu Cang Yun who had called out.

Immediately afterwards, the exclamations from Wu Dao, Gui Zu, Chi Yue, and Ai Ou followed, all of them tossing aside the aloof images they had built up over the years as Third-Order Origin Kings as they were unable to contain their shock and awe.

“Such rich World Energy... it’s so pure and clean. It can be absorbed directly even without trying to refine it.”

“If one cultivated here for a day, wouldn’t it be the same as cultivating for a year outside?”

“What is this place? Have we already reached the Star Boundary?”

“This shouldn’t be the Star Boundary!” Yang Kai shook his head.

“How do you know?”

“I’m not clear,” Yang Kai explained with a wry smile. “But I can somehow tell that this is a place between the Star Field and Star Boundary. Only after passing through here can we truly enter the Star Boundary.”

“The environment here is already so astonishing. How much better must the Star Boundary be?”

As such thoughts swirling in their heads, none of them was able to calm themselves. If everything they speculated was true, then breaking through to the next realm was just around the corner for them. Anyone able to cultivate to the Third-Order Origin King Realm was a genius among geniuses, so if they could find a suitable environment, they could steadily raise their cultivation.

“I don’t know what the Star Boundary’s situation is, but this place... we probably can’t stay here for too long,” Yang Kai didn’t get dazzled by everything in front of him and calmly analyzed.

“Why do you say so?”

“In the end, this is a passageway, so who can guarantee that it will remain stable forever? If some kind of turbulence happens, we may be lost here forever.”

Hearing what he said, everyone couldn’t help being shocked, only then realizing they were actually in danger.

Ai Ou nodded and said, “Yang Kai is right, this likely isn’t a place we can remain for an extended period.”

Yang Kai smiled and added, “But there’s no need to be too nervous. Since we need to pass through this place, it’s only natural to harvest as much benefit as possible along the way. It seems like the starlight here can not only restore Saint Qi but also cleanse and temper one’s physique and Soul. Everyone should try their best to absorb as much as possible.”

“A cleaning effect on the body and Soul!” Wu Dao’s eyes lit up and laughed, “If that’s the case, we certainly cannot miss it!”

Hearing this news, how could any of them not be moved? Hurriedly circulating their own Secret Arts, all of them began trying to gather the dense wisps of starlight around them.

But soon, everyone noticed an anomaly.

Among the group of six, the speed at which Yang Kai and Ai Ou were able to absorb this starlight seemed to be more than ten times faster than the others, with Yang Kai’s performance being particularly conspicuous. The wisps of starlight seemed to be naturally drawn to him, like moths to a flame, causing the path he walked along to be devoid of any wisps at all.

Although Ai Ou’s situation wasn’t bad either, there was still a noticeable gap between him and Yang Kai.

As for the others, their performance was even worse. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

All of them had to work hard and use their own Saint Qi to draw in these wisps of starlight.

In terms of efficiency, they were a hundred times worse than Yang Kai!

“What Secret Technique are you two using?” Wu Dao asked curiously. Among the six people here, Yang Kai and Ai Ou weren’t the strongest, especially Yang Kai, who was only a Second-Order Origin King in terms of cultivation. Technically, it made him the weakest here, but he was actually able to absorb more of this starlight than anyone else, eliciting some confusion.
