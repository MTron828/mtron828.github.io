Now, what those from Dawn had to do was extract the resources left behind in these Universe Worlds. This was a difficult process as there were only some 30 of them while there were several dozen Universe Worlds in this area. They wouldn’t be able to fully extract the resources in a mere few decades.

Mining everything of use here would take several hundred years.

They wouldn’t be able to shorten the time needed unless Blue Sky Pass could send more people over to help out; however, Blue Sky Pass was of critical importance, so the vast majority of people had to be stationed there to prevent the Black Ink Clan from attacking. It would not be possible for them to send a lot of people over to help extract resources.

They had already reached the limit by mobilising an Army to the four resource harvesting areas.

“Squad Leader, even though we’ve chased the Black Ink Clan out of this area, we can’t guarantee that some of them won’t come back to harass us. I think we’d better stick together rather than scatter everywhere. If anything really happens, we’d be able to support each other as soon as possible.” Feng Ying offered a suggestion, considering that Yang Kai was unfamiliar with these affairs. Such incidents had happened before, though the probability was low; however, once it happened, a lot of their members could die.

“I’ll leave it up to your judgment,” Yang Kai nodded, “Where do you think we should start first?”

After looking around, Feng Ying pointed at the largest Universe World, “We’ll start from there, then. I’ve taken a look and found traces that suggest the Black Ink Clan had been mining there before. In that case, there should be a lot of resources in that Universe World.”

“Let’s take a look at it, then,” Yang Kai waved his hand, after which Dawning Light headed towards that Universe World.

A moment later, Dawning Light landed on a barren mountain. After looking around, Yang Kai realised that this Universe World was desolate and void of any vitality. Not only were there no living creatures, but there was also not even a tiny bit of greenery.

The World Force of the Universe Worlds on the Black Ink Battlefield had been sucked dry by the Black Ink Clan. A Universe World without World Force was like a tree without roots or a river without a source. It was expected that they wouldn’t survive.

There were indeed some traces in this place which suggested that the Black Ink Clan had extracted resources here before. A lot of the places appeared shattered in this Universe World.

The sight reminded Yang Kai of the Black Prison.

The Black Prison was also full of materials, but they were all hidden in Ore Stars. Many people were required to mine Black Stones from the Ore Stars and use the World Force to melt the Black Stones in order to extract various materials.

Most of the time, even though a person exerted themselves, there still wouldn’t be a single thing inside a piece of Black Stone. Even if there was a reward, the Order of the material they would get depended on their luck.

Extracting materials in the Black Prison was just like gambling.

If one was lucky, they could easily obtain a Sixth-Order, Seventh-Order, or even Eighth-Order material. If one was unlucky, there wouldn’t be anything for them at all.

Previously, in order to deal with the Royal Lord trapped in the Black Prison, all the Cave Heavens and Paradises joined forces and mobilised a lot of manpower. They spent 100 years mining out all the Ore Stars in Black Territory in order to crack the Super Array’s suppression so that they could have a final battle against the Royal Lord. The materials obtained during that period of time were simply incalculable.

Those materials had all fallen into the hands of those from Void Land and High Heaven Palace. It could be said that the Cave Heavens and Paradises had worked for free for them; otherwise, given Void Land, High Heaven Palace, and Luan Bai Feng’s available manpower, they wouldn’t have been able to fully extract the materials in Black Territory even if they spent thousands of years doing it.

It was a huge boon to Yang Kai’s forces. With that said, Yang Kai was trapped in the core of the Black Prison together with a Royal Lord for 100 years. The materials from Black Territory could be seen as compensation for his efforts from the Cave Heavens and Paradises.

Now, the Universe Worlds in this resource harvesting area were essentially no different from the Ore Stars in Black Territory, aside from the fact that there were no Black Stones. The resources they extracted were what they got, and no luck was needed.

As Yang Kai recalled Black Territory, an idea suddenly sprang to mind. In the past, in order to help Luan Bai Feng’s subordinates mine the Ore Stars with peace of mind, he created an artifact that could move the Ore Stars across vast distances, the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors.

The situation in Black Territory was similar to that which he was facing now.

While Yang Kai was lost in his own thoughts, he heard Feng Yin saying, “Squad Leader, there’s a rule in the Inner Sanctum. Whoever extracts the resources can use them as they please as long as it’s for their own cultivation. Only when there are extra resources should they be handed in to the War Materials Hall. Most importantly, we can’t keep the extra resources to ourselves. There are more members in Dawn than in other Squads, so I reckon that we can extract the resources in small groups. While some people are mining resources, the others can stand guard.”

Yang Kai was absent-minded as he replied, “En, you make the arrangements. I have something I need to look into.”

Upon finishing his words, he shot into the sky.

If his idea was feasible, they wouldn’t have to stay here and extract resources. He just had to move these Universe Worlds to somewhere near Blue Sky Pass, and the resources could be fully extracted in no time; after all, there were more than 20,000 people in Blue Sky Pass, so it would naturally be more efficient to get them to mine these Universe Worlds than just the members of Dawn alone.

All the members were shocked as they had no idea where Yang Kai was going.

Shen Ao even muttered, “Squad Leader is acting so mysterious. What is he going to do this time?”

Feng Ying shook her head, “I have no idea, Squad Leader can be a bit careless at times. Ignore him for now,” After she finished speaking, she divided more than 35 people left into six groups, each of them led by a Seventh-Order Master. They would take turns to stand guard to prevent the Black Ink Clan from launching a sneak attack on them. With one of the groups on patrol, the rest could extract resources with peace of mind.

They would spend decades in this place, so those who kept guard could also cultivate and strengthen themselves so that no time would be wasted.

After Feng Ying was done with the arrangements, they all got to work. She, on the other hand, went to look for Yang Kai in order to find out what he was doing.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai had already arrived at a nearby Universe World.

He had some experience in moving Ore Stars in the Black Prison, so he was pretty skillful at it; however, he wasn’t certain if Void Yin-Yang Mirrors could send one of these Universe Worlds to Blue Sky Pass, which was very far away from this place.

Regardless, he had to give it a try.

The Void Yin-Yang Mirrors consisted of a total of 16 artifacts. They could be divided into Yin and Yang sets with 8 artifacts in each. Yang Kai had personally refined the prototype for these artifacts, and after that, Grandmaster Ma Fan of Great Evolution Paradise helped him enhance them so they were stabler and more powerful.

While he was scanning the surroundings, Yang Kai noticed a ray of light approaching him from a distance. When he turned his head, he saw that Feng Ying was coming over.

After Feng Ying arrived, she asked curiously, “What are you doing here?”

Yang Kai replied, “I have an idea. You’ve come at just the right time. Stay here for a moment.”

Feng Ying nodded.

It was then that Yang Kai fished out 8 artifacts of Void Yang Mirrors and started setting them up.

Two hours later, he was done with arranging the artifacts. Feng Ying’s expression became increasingly solemn as she observed his actions.

Although she had no idea what Yang Kai was doing, the 8 artifacts he scattered around the Universe World seemed to have created some kind of spatial lock around it. It was apparent that something big was about to happen.

The next instant, Yang Kai abruptly appeared in front of her, “Just stand here and monitor the situation. I need to head back to the Inner Sanctum.”

“Huh?” Feng Ying was shocked, “Why are you going back to the Inner Sanctum?”

“For something good!” Yang Kai kept her in suspense, “If this works, we won’t have to stay here to extract resources.”

After he finished speaking, he performed a hand seal and activated the Universe Transference Law.

Just when Feng Yin was ready to ask more questions, the Array had already appeared beneath Yang Kai. He was engulfed in a dazzling light, and when the light dissipated, he was nowhere to be found.

Feng Ying couldn’t help but shake her head as she had no idea what Yang Kai was up to. This was the best chance to mine resources, and any wasted time would result in fewer resources for them. Nevertheless, she knew that Yang Kai wouldn’t act for no reason, so she decided to wait patiently.

However, she didn’t understand why he said they wouldn’t have to mine resources if he succeeded. If they didn’t do anything, would the resources just float into their pockets?

In the meantime, Yang Kai’s figure appeared in the prototype Purifying Black Ink Battleship in Blue Sky Pass.

The other Great Passes only had four Purifying Black Ink Battleships respectively, stationed with their Eastern, Southern, Western, and Northern Armies.

Only Blue Sky Pass had five Battleships. That was because the prototype of the Purifying Black Ink Battleship was created in this place. The Purifying Black Ink Battleships produced later were all modelled on the first.

There were four resource harvesting areas now, and each had a Purifying Black Ink Battleship. The first Purifying Black Ink Battleship stayed in the Inner Sanctum so Yang Kai could use it to move around easily.

After stepping out of the Battleship, Yang Kai headed straight to the Western Army Headquarters.

Zhong Liang was handling work-related affairs when he saw Yang Kai land nearby and asked in shock, “Brat, what are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be in the fourth forward base?”

As he spoke, his expression changed slightly, “Has something happened over there?”

Yang Kai was surprised and asked, “Haven’t you received any information from there, Army Commander?”

Zhong Liang replied, “Of course I have. Last I heard you all successfully occupied that place.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Indeed. They’re extracting resources over there right now.”

Zhong Liang let out a sigh of relief, “You scared me. I thought something had happened. Since you’ve occupied the area, aren’t you supposed to be mining it? Why did you come back?”

Yang Kai replied, “I can’t explain it clearly now. Please accompany me out of the Inner Sanctum, Army Commander. If this matter is successful, it will be of great benefit to us all.”

Zhong Liang arched his brow, “What do you mean?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “It won’t be useful to talk about it if it fails; however, if it succeeds, you’ll be able to observe it in person.”

“How do you even have the nerve to act mysterious in front of me?” Zhong Liang snorted and rose from the chair, “Fine, fine. I’ll go with you.”

If it had been someone else speaking, Zhong Liang would have made him explain everything first. As an Army Commander, he was swamped with work, so he didn’t have any time to waste; however, considering the shocking achievements Yang Kai had made over the years, and the fact that the death of two Territory Lords at the fourth forward base had something to do with him, he decided to be a bit more patient.

Soon, they left Blue Sky Pass and arrived at the void on the outside.

Zhong Liang looked around and frowned, “What do you want me to see? You can show me now.”

“Please give me a moment, Army Commander,” Yang Kai replied, then started setting up the Void Yin Mirrors.
