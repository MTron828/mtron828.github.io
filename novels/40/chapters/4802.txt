On the other side of the Territory Gate, more than ten High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters still steadfastly watched over the Chaotic Dead Territory, just like they had been doing for a long time.

As Yang Kai had speculated, the fallout from the fight between the Sun’s Burning Light and Moon’s Serene Glimmer was too horrifying and would affect the neighbouring Great Territories. Once that happened, the entire Great Territory would become a part of the Chaotic Dead Territory.

Therefore, the Cave Heavens and Paradises would always empty the adjacent Great Territories to prevent too many casualties due to the fight. They had been doing this for many, many years now.

When the fight between the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer expanded previously and affected new Great Territories, they would already be empty to begin with; therefore, even though countless Universe Worlds would be destroyed, no casualties had been reported.

That was the reason the cultivators in this Great Territory fled decades ago.

When Giant Spirit God Ah Er dashed out of the Territory Gate, these High-Rank Masters didn’t try to stop him and simply watched him leave. In fact, they were unable to stop him even if they wanted to. Even though there was an Eighth-Order Ancestor around, there was no way they could challenge a Giant Spirit God.

As they watched the Giant Spirit God leave, a Seventh-Order woman suddenly let out a sigh, “It’s unfortunate that such a talent passed away at such a young age.”

The person beside her nodded, “You’re right. A rising star like him was killed just like that. Life is full of uncertainties, isn’t it?”

Another person said, “An ignorant person knows no fear. I suppose he wasn’t aware that he was entering the Chaotic Dead Territory; otherwise, he wouldn’t have the guts to tag along with the Giant Spirit God.”

“I heard that the young man was engaged to a Core Disciple from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. Now that he’s dead, I suppose the engagement has been annulled.”

“I heard from the Sect that he had made a significant contribution in the fight to destroy the Black Ink Disciples in Lang Ya Paradise. It was thanks to him that those from Lang Ya Paradise could find and eliminate all the Black Ink Disciples. They had even found some clues that led to the true Black Ink Clansman hiding behind the shadows.”

They were naturally talking about Yang Kai.

When Yang Kai barged into the Chaotic Dead Territory alongside Ah Er in the past, many of these High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters witnessed it.

At that moment, all of them were shocked.

First of all, no one had ever worked with a Giant Spirit God before, so the people who saw Yang Kai thought that they were just seeing things.

Secondly, the Chaotic Dead Territory was an extremely dangerous place. Even though Yang Kai had entered alongside a Giant Spirit God, they reckoned that his fate would be miserable. He would most likely be killed by the shockwaves of the never-ending fight.

Therefore, after Yang Kai dashed into the Chaotic Dead Territory alongside the Giant Spirit God, they started looking into his identity.

Although they had been monitoring the movements of the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer for many years as it was their duty, they still had ways to communicate with the outside world.

Upon asking around, they found out that the young man who entered the Chaotic Dead Territory alongside the Giant Spirit God was a famous figure, not a nobody.

His titles included Star Boundary Great Emperor, Void Land’s Lord, Yin-Yang Cave Heaven’s Son-in-Law and so on.

Previously, the incident regarding the World Tree had spread like wildfire. Even though they were stationed here, these Masters had heard of it. It was already shocking enough that Yang Kai, as a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, was able to kill a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. During the Dao Theory Assembly, he defeated all other Core Disciples from the Cave Heavens and Paradises and won first place. That was why they were also aware that he was a Yin-Yang Cave Heaven Son-in-Law.

Additionally, it was thanks to Yang Kai’s contribution that those from Lang Ya Paradise were able to root out the Black Ink Disciples and kill them all, which prevented a disaster from happening.

Yang Kai had done many things that were of great concern to the Cave Heavens and Paradises, so he was no longer a nameless figure. That was why they could easily find out his identity by just asking around.

After some calculations, they reckoned that he had come to the Chaotic Dead Territory with the Giant Spirit God after leaving Lang Ya Paradise.

Regardless of how many achievements Yang Kai had made in the past, which included killing a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he was still just a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master in the end. There was no way he could survive in the Chaotic Dead Territory.

They believed that it was the truth. Decades had passed, and the Giant Spirit God finally left; however, the young man that had tagged along was nowhere to be seen now.

No one could survive in the Chaotic Dead Territory for long, not even the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, to say nothing of the fact that Yang Kai was just a Sixth-Order Master.

Although they felt sorry for Yang Kai’s death, they were not close to him after all; therefore, after a moment of silence, they soon talked about other matters.

“Speaking of the Black Ink Clan, how’s the situation in the Shattered Heaven now?”

All of them shook their heads, including the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Ancestor, who supposedly knew a little more than the rest, “Although we’ve been looking into it for decades, we haven’t found the whereabouts of the Black Ink Clansman in the Shattered Heaven. They seem to be very well hidden.”

“Have they found other Black Ink Disciples in our forces?”

“No.”

“I suppose the situation is not that bad yet. I wonder how those Black Ink Disciples from Lang Ya Paradise became connected to the Black Ink Clan.”

Just when the Eighth-Order Ancestor was about to speak, his expression changed drastically as he turned to look at the Territory Gate.

Fluctuations could be felt coming from the Territory Gate. It wasn’t the first time they experienced this. The same thing happened when Giant Spirit God Ah Er shot out of the Chaotic Dead Territory. It would also happen when the fallout from the fight between the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer spread.

Now that the Giant Spirit God was gone, there were no other living creatures in the Chaotic Dead Territory other than the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer.

The Eighth-Order Ancestor felt his heart sinking, thinking that the fight between the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer would soon affect the next Great Territory. The same thing happened barely 100 years ago.

Why would it come so soon?

Without the need for him to give the order, more than ten High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters drew on the powers of their Small Universes to protect themselves while raising their vigilance to the highest.

According to past experiences, the Territory Gate wouldn’t be destroyed too quickly, so they still had time to flee. Once the Territory Gate was destroyed, if they still hadn’t left this Great Territory, they would be killed despite being High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters.

Under their pointed watch though, a figure strolled out of the Territory Gate.

All of them were rooted to the spot as though they had been hit by some kind of binding technique. Even the seasoned Eighth-Order Ancestor widened his eyes as he looked dazedly at the young man, who had stepped out of the Chaotic Dead Territory totally unscathed.

When Yang Kai shook off his dizziness from crossing the Territory Gate, he saw that more than ten people gazing at him as though he was a ghost. He frowned, knowing that they must have misunderstood something.

However, he didn’t intend to explain anything and simply saluted them respectfully, “Void Land’s Yang Kai greets Seniors.”

[It’s really him!]

Although they already found out Yang Kai’s identity and knew that he was Void Land’s Lord, they hadn’t verified this fact as there was simply no way to do that. It wasn’t until this moment that they could confirm it.

These people exchanged dumbfounded glances as they couldn’t believe their eyes. They had always believed that Yang Kai was long dead, and the Cave Heavens and Paradises that received the news must have shared the same sentiment.

A Seventh-Order woman, who spoke earlier, asked doubtfully, “You’re still… alive?”

[What on Earth is she talking about?] A speechless Yang Kai gaped at her and nodded, “Yes?”

Another High-Rank Open Heaven Realm asked in shock, “How are you still alive?”

Yang Kai sported a dark expression, wondering why these people seemed to want him dead when there were no grudges between them.

The Eighth-Order Ancestor seemed to realise what Yang Kai was thinking and explained, “They’re curious about how you survived in the Chaotic Dead Territory. Did the Giant Spirit God protect you?”

Upon hearing this, the others finally realised what was happening. It would only be possible for Yang Kai to survive in the Chaotic Dead Territory with the Giant Spirit God’s protection.

However, after giving it a thought, they realised that something was off. The Giant Spirit God had left some time before Yang Kai came out of the Chaotic Dead Territory, yet he was still alive and kicking even though he didn’t have the Giant Spirit God’s protection for the past incense or so.

Yang Kai nodded his head, “Your insight is truly sharp, Ancestor. It was indeed thanks to the Giant Spirit God that I survived. However, it’s no longer dangerous inside as one can enter and leave without fear.”

All of them were stunned as some of them asked doubtfully, “Are you serious?”

Without going into the details, Yang Kai replied, “I’ve found a… game for the two powerful beings inside to occupy their time with. Now that they’ve switched to a different method of competing, it’s no longer dangerous inside.”

All of them stared fixedly at Yang Kai as though they were trying to figure out whether he was lying.

After pondering on it for a moment, the Eighth-Order Ancestor said in a weird tone, “You said you’ve found a game for the powerful beings inside?”

Yang Kai nodded seriously.

The Ancestor’s expression became more awkward, “Do you know who they are?”

“Of course, I know.” Yang Kai nodded again.

At that, the Ancestor was speechless.

The other High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters traded glances. Some of them even suspected that Yang Kai had gone mad.

The beings inside were the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer, who had been fighting against one another since the dawn of time. They had destroyed innumerable Great Territories along the way. No one knew what the cause of the fight was, but they speculated that they were simply incompatible with each other’s existence.

This was a truly irreconcilable feud.

Nevertheless, there was now a young man who said that he had found a new game for these two beings to kill time with so they changed the way they fought?

Was this whole thing some kind of child’s game? Certainly, they wouldn’t believe it.

They would probably find it to be even more inconceivable if they found out that Yang Kai had played this child’s game with them for quite a long time.

“Well…” The Ancestor tried to measure his words as he also believed that Yang Kai had gone mad. Even though Yang Kai had stayed in the Chaotic Dead Territory for decades and eventually stepped out of it safely, which was a feat no one had pulled off in history, it didn’t mean that what he said was true.

The Ancestor asked seriously, “What kind of game is it?”

After giving it a thought, Yang Kai replied, “Will you believe me if I say it’s a kind of strategy game?”

Yang Kai had naturally noticed the Eighth-Order Ancestor’s doubt, and there was something off about the way the other High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters looked at him, as if they felt sympathy for him.

The Eighth-Order Ancestor fell silent.

It wasn’t that he wasn’t willing to believe Yang Kai, but the latter’s words were just too inconceivable.

Could a so-called strategy game make the two powerful beings forget about the grudges between them that had spanned across the ages? If it were so easy, these people wouldn’t have had to keep guard in this place for so many years.

“It’s expected that you don’t believe me, so why don’t you come with me to see for yourself? You’ll believe me when you witness it in person.” Yang Kai invited him to enter the Chaotic Dead Territory with him.

The Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Ancestor instantly put up his guard. If he hadn’t known that Yang Kai had the World Spring, which protected his Small Universe from any external invasion, he would’ve suspected that the young man had been stained with Black Ink and was trying to kill him.

Not just anyone could barge into the Chaotic Dead Territory. Even though Yang Kai had left safely, he might have some special way of achieving it. On the other hand, the Eighth-Order Ancestor wouldn’t dare to put his guard down.
