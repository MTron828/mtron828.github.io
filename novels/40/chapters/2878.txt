Sword light swept through everything as several self-confident Demon Great Generals were cleaved in half by Yang Kai, flesh and blood spewing wildly, and the residual force of the Sword Qi clearing out a wide area, crushing all the Demons around into paste.

In the middle of this carnage, only one tall, strong Barbarian remained standing.

He was shimmering with the light of the Shield Spell, but it could not hide the horrifying state of one side of his body, which had seemingly been liquified. Before Yang Kai’s arrival, this Barbarian had already killed dozens of Demon Generals and Demon Great Generals with his Shamanic Spells. Only the last flames of this man’s burning vitality were supporting his mutilated body.

Their eyes met, and the man grinned as he called out, “Heh heh, Shaman Niu…”

“Shaman Tu…” Yang Kai looked at the Shaman Grandmaster in front of him with an unreadable expression.

Just a few months ago, the two had some conflicts in the South Barbarian Clan’s King City. Shaman Tu was provocative and dissatisfied with Yang Kai; and even after a few months, the expression on this Shaman Grandmaster was still ever so unkind, even a faint trace of competition in his gaze.

“I thought you wouldn’t come, but you’re here.” Shaman Tu chuckled lowly, and did not mind the half of his body that had liquified at all, which was obviously caused by the Black Brilliance from earlier. His bones were exposed, and even his internal organs were clearly visible, which continued to dissolve into liquid and dripped onto the ground.

“I just arrived,” Yang Kai gave a small nod.

“Very good!” A smile crept onto Shaman Tu’s face. The pain did not make him lose his mind and instead seemed to be keeping him more sober than ever, “In the past few months, more than seven thousand Demons have died at my, Shaman Tu, hands and the hands of my subordinates’. How about you?” He asked with a solemn face.

“Not as many as you.” Yang Kai replied.

Shaman Tu guffawed, “Then I win! Hahahaha!”

He remembered the bet he had with Yang Kai before departing King City.

Yang Kai agreed, “You are right, you’ve won.”

Only after a short silence did he ask, “Can you still hold on?”

Shaking his head, Shaman Tu replied, “No, as you can clearly see. My clansmen are all dead anyway, I am the only one left in the Shaman Tu Clan. I should go look for them now.”

“Farewell!” Yang Kai nodded and placed his fist across his chest in respect.

Shaman Tu crossed his skeletal hand over his chest in return, and stated sternly, “Find Sir Shaman King! The South Barbarian Clan must not perish here today!”

After that, he turned around and took large strides towards the dense group of Demons. He slurred an incantation jerkily, and a dazzling light that resembled a ball of flame burst out of his body, enveloping him.

Life Sacrifice!

This was the most forbidden Shamanic Spell among all Shamanic Spells; however, at this moment, Shaman Tu used it to illuminate the last brilliance of his life.

In this Ancient Era, the Barbarian Race believed that they would return to the embrace of the Barbarian God after death, and their souls would travel to the Shaman Divine Temple to be reincarnated. Death was not the end for them, only a new beginning.

The only kind of people who did not qualify would be the Shaman Masters who used the forbidden spell, Life Sacrifice. Therefore, under normal circumstances, even if a Shaman Grandmaster was at the brink of death, they would not use this spell. Once it was cast, one would lose their qualifications to return to the embrace of the Barbarian God and have their soul rest in Shaman Divine Temple. It was an intolerable fate.

But in the face of the Demon Race, who invaded their homeland, Shaman Tu did not hesitate to make such a choice. Even if he would become a lonely ghost, even if he was abandoned by the Barbarian Gods, he had to contribute his last bit of strength to his clansmen.

The clueless Demons surrounded him while Shaman Tu cackled loudly, allowing the sharp weapons to slash him freely, but his body only burned more and more vigorously.

The Demons gathered around him finally realized something was wrong, but it was too late when they wanted to turn around to escape.

With a loud explosion, as if someone had lit a brilliant firework, Shaman Tu’s whole body exploded into a cloud of flaming blood, and the Demons surrounding him also vanished in an instant.

All Demons within a radius of one thousand metres were wiped out!

By now though, Yang Kai was already making his way to the centre of the battlefield.

He could sense a familiar aura over there. It was a Shaman King’s aura, but the aura was clearly weak and fluctuating. It seemed like Shaman Dang was in extremely poor condition.

There were only tens of thousands of people left of the South Barbarian Clan after the outbreak of the Black Brilliance, and that number was rapidly declining under the attack of the Demon Race. Barbarian Warriors were dropping one by one, and the Shamans could hardly execute their roles effectively after losing the protection. Their relatively weak bodies were clearly incapable of turning back the tides with such a huge gap in numbers, even if they cast their most potent Shamanic Spells without rest.

Under such desperate circumstances, Shaman Tu was not the only one who executed the Life Sacrifice. In fact, many other Shaman Grandmasters chose to make this final stand, igniting the last of their vitality in hopes of dragging as many Demons down with them as possible.

The scattered Barbarians were slaughtered, while the only Barbarians left were the ten thousand or so gathered at the centre that still maintained an orderly defence. Various Shamanic Spells dyed the Barbarians in vibrant colours while fearless and dauntless looks covered their faces as they fought the Demon Race to the death.

The line of defence was pushed back step by step, and the ten thousand warriors were steadily dwindling in number.

In the midst of this chaos, everyone was stunned at Yang Kai’s sudden appearance, including the Demons, who stared at him in a daze, watching him carve a bloody path to join the encircled Barbarians.

As he reached the centre of the group, Yang Kai quickly saw Shaman Dang.

“Sir!”

Shaman Dang looked terrible. He was blind in one eye, from which thick liquid flowed out, and his body was mangled and misshapen as a result of the terrible erosion of the Black Brilliance, just like Shaman Tu. Meanwhile, the other Shaman Grandmasters’ conditions were even worse than Shaman Dang’s.

Shaman Dang raised his remaining eye and found that it was Yang Kai who called him, and he could not help but flash a wry smile and ask, “Why are you here?”

Yang Kai knew what he was worried about, and quickly explained, “The Shaman Niu Clan didn’t come, I came by myself.”

Shaman Dang was immediately relieved, nodding repeatedly, “Good, good, very good!” While speaking, he took out an object that resembled a piece of carved wood. It was made of unknown material, and there was nothing special about it either, but Shaman Dang regarded it as a treasure, and solemnly stuffed it into Yang Kai’s hand, “This is the Sacred Treasure of our South Barbarian Clan! Take it and leave, the South Barbarian Clan cannot perish!”

In the Barbarian Race, each Clan has its own Sacred Treasure. These Sacred Treasures were a kind of spiritual pillar, but were themselves not rare or powerful items. However, the Sacred Treasure symbolized supreme authority and power, while the one who held the Sacred Treasure could command the entire Clan.

In general, the Sacred Treasure was always in the possession of the most powerful Shaman King of the Clan.

Shaman Dang was the sixth Shaman King, so the Sacred Treasure wouldn’t fall into his hands under normal circumstances. In this situation, there was only one explanation for this, the other Shaman Kings were dead!

Shaman Dang was the last Shaman King of the South Barbarian Clan, but he knew he was not going to live long.

On the field, Yang Kai was the only Shaman Grandmaster who remained uninjured, so Shaman Dang had no choice but hand over the South Barbarian Clan’s Sacred Treasure to him.

“Can you do it?” Shaman Dang grabbed Yang Kai’s shoulder and gazed at him solemnly.

Yang Kai nodded and promised, “The South Barbarian Clan will never die!”

Shaman Dang gave a small smile, “That’s all you need to say.” He immediately regained the mighty aura he had when Yang Kai first met him and the power of a Shaman King instantly awakened in his body as he declared in a deep voice, “We will create an opportunity for you to escape here. After you leave, take your Shaman Niu Clan to find other great Clans and tell them of what happened to the South Barbarian Clan today, so that they can learn from it.”

Yang Kai opened his mouth and wanted to tell him that there was another Demon Saint here. Shaman Dang probably was not aware that this was the work of a Demon Saint and expressed confidence in creating the opportunity for Yang Kai to escape.

If he knew it, he would not be that assured.

But Yang Kai closed his mouth. If it was possible, he would use the Sealed World Bead to take away all the survivors here.

However, he could not do that even if he wanted to, because all the Barbarians in sight were just like Shaman Tu, dissolving slowly under the aftereffects of the Black Brilliance, including the most powerful Shaman King.

Yang Kai would only be taking away puddles of liquified bodies if he brought them into the Sealed World Bead.

The Life Chains blessing on them could not save their lives, only postpone their deaths.

Clenching the Sacred Treasure tightly in his hand, Yang Kai vowed with a seriousness that he had never had before, “The South Barbarian Clan will one day rise from the ashes, stronger than ever before, I promise!”

Shaman Dang gave a boisterous laugh, then suddenly asked, “Yue and Lu…”

“They’re both fine.” Yang Kai replied, “The war has allowed them to grow a lot. It should not be long before they become Shaman Grandmasters themselves. Sir, is there any message you need me to pass on to them?”

“There’s no need!” Shaman Dang waved his hand, “They know their responsibilities, I don’t need to worry about them.” He took a deep breath and continued, “Are you ready?”

Yang Kai nodded.

Shaman Dang immediately waved his hand, and a bolt of lightning flashed at his fingers. In the blink of an eye, it turned into a vivid lightning python, which blasted into the mass of Demons ahead.

There were sounds of stabs and slashes, followed by the Demons falling on their backs.

The lightning python swam through the swarm of enemies, guiding the way forward for the remaining South Barbarian Clansmen. The incantations of Shamans and the roars of Barbarian Warriors were intertwined into a tragic requiem. All the remaining clansmen converged to form a rope of Barbarians with Shaman Dang as the centre, and advanced forward fiercely, as if to dig out an escape route.

Even facing an enemy ten, or twenty times greater than themselves in number, the South Barbarian clan cut open a path and pushed forward with unstoppable force.

Unfortunately, this momentum could not be maintained for long. When several Demon Kings arrived, their progress was blocked.

Shaman Dang flew into the air, his Shaman Strength fluctuating madly, facing the menacing Demon Kings single-handedly, and at the same time, he shouted to Yang Kai, “Find your way out of here!”

He was unable to provide Yang Kai with any more protection, so everything completely depended on Yang Kai’s own abilities to whether he could escape or not. Although hope was still, Shaman Dang could only pray for the best.

Yang Kai nodded at him, not intending to expose any more of himself at this place.

He had felt a pair of eyes watching him silently ever since he set foot on this battlefield.

Undoubtedly, the owner of that gaze was Demon Saint Mo Duo.

Therefore, he had been hiding his true strength the whole time. He had never experienced the power of a Demon Saint before, but he knew that he was definitely not a match for such a Master. If he managed to provoke the Demon Saint, he may not be able to escape from here.
