Chapter 49 - Victory

Cheng Shao Feng died! With no warning, he died just like that under Kai Yang’s hand.

Last time when Kai Yang had fought with the Storm House disciples, Hu Mei Er had watched from start to finish. So although she knew that Kai Yang’s power was great, she hadn’t thought that he would be as strong as this just a few days after the previous fight after !

Initial element first stage Cheng Shao Feng, he had only faced Kai Yang for a few moments and died from a single poke to the head!

What martial skill was that? How could there be such a powerful martial skill? The hole in Cheng Shao Feng’s forehead alluded to the fact the skill utilised a strong yang attributed qi in some manner to burn through the skull.

At this point, Hu Mei Er’s heart was in a state of panic, for when she learned of Kai Yang’s thunder-like murder methods, she finally knew that Kai Yang’s previous words were no joke.

He really dared to kill others, whilst also having the ability to do so!

Nu Tao was also very shocked, for he had just exchanged one fist with Kai Yang and before he could commence his second attack, his junior brother had died in front of him. This unforeseen accident really made him flabbergasted.

“You actually killed junior brother Cheng!” Nu Tao shrieked, “What method did you use!”

(TL: Well you did threaten to kill him. I vote self-defence.✋)

That single finger’s power was far too tyrannical, it was definitely some extremely rare martial skill. Nu Tao was a bit afraid, afraid that even he would unable to resist that technique.

“You also need to die!” Kai Yang knew that to destroy the branch, he must destroy the root. The reason why these two people followed him here was because they wanted to kill him. To this these types of enemies, how could Kai Yang possibly lenient.

The circumstances now were different to before, last time it was a group fight, so Kai Yang’s hand would naturally be more lenient. But currently, these two people wanted his life, to these enemies he mustn’t be merciful, otherwise he was just asking to die later.

Seeing Kai Yang hurriedly charge over, Nu Tao suddenly laughed out maliciously: “Don’t bluff, come and get it!”

As he shouted, he threw out two fists to greet Kai Yang. The opponent was only at the tempered body stage, so how much World Qi could they possibly store inside them? The martial attack just then was extremely powerful, so it should have used quite a lot of his World Qi. In other words, he couldn’t possibly use that type of method again.

That’s why Nu Tao had nothing to fear!

When those fists collided, Nu Tao knew that he had made a mistake. This Kai Yang could still use his World Qi, and every time they collided, he could feel a blistering hot energy seeping out from Kai Yang’s fist. This energy caused Nu Tao to shrivel up, although he was at a higher stage of cultivation than Kai Yang, he was unable to suppress him.

Nu Tao came up with many countermeasures, jumping from left to right, he didn’t dare confront Kai Yang straight up. He only wanted to prolong the fight until Kai Yang used up all of his World Qi, and at that moment, it would be like Kai Yang was a fish on a chopping board.

Nu Tao’s tactics and thoughts weren’t wrong, to deal with ordinary tempered body stage disciples this method was the most effective, allowing one to suffer the least in return for taking down the opponent. But Kai Yang was different, for he had just fully absorbed all of the Bright Yang Stone’s Yang qi and his meridians were brimming with energy. If things really continued, it would possibly be Nu Tao who ran out of strength first.

Very soon, the fight became unfavourable for Nu Tao. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

At the beginning, Kai Yang truly acted like a typical martial practitioner at the tempered body stage. Regardless of his fists, or power, although they were stronger than a typical tempered body stage practitioner, the strength he displayed didn’t go past that of a tempered body stage practitioner. But as time went on, as various types of wounds started to appear on his body, Kai Yang’s strength started to climb up bit by bit. Each fist was faster than the last, his strength also grew stronger and stronger, but the most fearsome aspect wasn’t either of these, but rather that the blistering hot energy his fists released was growing stronger and more abundant.

It appeared that as the fight drew on Kai Yang’s strength rapidly grew in relation to the passing of time and the injuries he sustained.

What was going on? When a martial practitioner battled, as time went on and the more World Qi they used, a martial practitioner would only become weaker and weaker. How could it possibly be the complete opposite?

In the time to took to drink a cup of tea, it became harder and harder for Nu Tao to dodge and escape Kai Yang’s attacks. With one failed dodge, he was punched in the stomach by Kai Yang.

This fist caused Nu Tao to be unable to breathe, and the fiery energy that invaded his body was also quite ferocious as it wrecked havoc.

Looking at the blood red eyed Kai Yang, Nu Tao began to consider retreat!

With a feint move, Nu Tao retreated and sped far away, and while he gasped for breath he howled out: “Kai Yang, since you have killed junior brother Cheng, you are doomed!”

Initial element fifth stage, even if they couldn’t defeat the enemy, if they wanted to escape, their opponent couldn’t do anything. And of this, Nu Tao was highly confident, because in the previous battle he had discovered that Kai Yang didn’t cultivate any bodily martial skill.

If Nu Tao wanted to run, Kai Yang couldn’t block him and could only helplessly watched as he ran away. But suddenly Kai Yang thought of an idea, and the last drop of Yang Liquid within his dantian winked out and zoomed to his fingertips.

Shortly after Kai Yang reached out with his other hand and pulled on his fingers and a sensational scene appeared.

This drop of Yang Liquid, in the blink of an eye morphed into a blood red blade as thin as cicada wing. Just as the blade was formed, under Kai Yang’s urgings, it flew out.

“Sou” it sounded, a graceful red colour pierced the air and embedded itself into Nu Tao’s back.

Nu Tao’s running figure immediately became rigid, and with a pu tong, he fell to the ground.

The silence of the forest was broken by a songbird’s cry, meanwhile Kai Yang gasped for breath, his whole body battered and exhausted.

Hu Mui Er’s pair of legs trembled, her entire body ice-cold, even her heart was cold. She had never left, waiting for the moment when Kai Yang couldn’t take it anymore and had to ask for her help and then she would be able to achieve her own goal.

But no matter what, she would have never imagined that those two Storm House disciples who had come to kill Kai Yang, would be killed by Kai Yang instead.

These two people were both at the initial element stage, one at the first stage and the other at the fifth stage. Together they battled against a tempered body stage practitioner, Kai Yang, and in the end not only did they lose, they also paid with their lives.

All of this seemed too unreal, too mind baffling.

Suddenly, Hu Mei Er’s face became startled. She saw Kai Yang turn his head over to face her with an expression that looked like he wanted to eat her. Within his eyes, glinted a deep and murderous light.

Hu Mei Er unconsciously retreated a few steps.

“If you dare move, then die!” Kai Yang’s icy-cold voice travelled over.

“I won’t move......” Within Hu Mei Er’s voice was sounds of sobbing, a warm wet patch appeared on her lower abdomen, in that moment she had forgotten all her manners.

She really was scared, and she wasn’t certain whether or not Kai Yang really wanted to kill her. In life or death, what could she, a young lady do?

Kai Yang no longer paid her any attention, but went to Cheng Shao Feng and Nu Tao’s side to take their possessions. In a moment, Kai Yang had found some taels and two bottles of immortality pills.

Two bottles of immortality pills couldn’t be considered a lot, but they were still worth something.

It wasn’t a loss! It was just a shame, for he had been forced to expend those hard earned drops of Yang Liquid, leaving his dantian empty. After this great battle, the Yang World Qi within his meridians had been consumed to such a degree that just a bit less than half remained.

“Are you short of money?” As Hu Mei Er saw Kai Yang looting the two corpses, she mustered up her courage to speak out. “I can give you money, as long as you don’t kill me.”

Looking at Hu Mei Er who still dared to flirt, is she showing off her beauty? Even when she spoke, it was cautiously and carefully.

Kai Yang enthusiastically looked at her: “It’s not like I am a bandit, what will I do with your money? If I lack money, I will earn it myself!”
