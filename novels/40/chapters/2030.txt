Yang Kai also had some dealings with Zhou Ning Si, specifically on the day he went to Spirit Pill Plaza and signed a Soul Contract with Kang Si Ran. At that time, Zhou Ning Si wanted to poach him for her Pill Pavilion, but he refused.

As such, Yang Kai naturally had an impression of this charming woman.

Her decision to bid for the Black Jade Furnace was understandable; after all, she was the shopkeeper of Pill Pavilion, so buying the Black Jade Furnace would be of great use to her.

Kang Si Ran, hearing Zhou Ning Si’s bid, instantly grew angry. It seemed that he had recalled the various injustices he had to go through over the past few months and that fueled his rage.

On the other side, the man with the thick eyebrows inside the Jiang Family, distinguishing Zhuo Ning Si’s identity, furrowed his brow and said, “Shopkeeper Zhuo, my Jiang Family and your pavilion enjoy a cooperative relationship and have some friendship with one another. Is this really necessary?”

Zhou Ning Si chuckled and said, “Uncle Jiang, while you’re right, friendship is friendship and business is business. Little Sister is just itching to get her hands on this treasure, so naturally she has to offer a bid. Uncle Jiang, how about you be the magnanimous one and give this Black Jade Furnace to Little Sister? Little Sister will definitely host a banquet tonight to entertain Uncle Jiang in return for his favour. Hehe, I just don’t know whether you have the stamina to attend.”

She was blatantly seducing the Jiang Family master in front of thousands of cultivators.

Many cultivators in the hall snorted contemptuously upon hearing this.

“Slut!” Kang Si Ran was also filled with righteous indignation as he despised Zhuo Ning Si’s debauchery.

Inside the Jiang Family private room, the man with the thick eyebrows snorted coldly but remained unmoved and said indifferently, “Is Shopkeeper Zhou insistent on opposing my Jiang Family?”

“Oh, how could I dare? After this incident, Little Sister will personally come to the Jiang Family to apologize, but still, Little Sister can’t give up on this Black Jade Furnace,” Zhou Ning Si declared loudly, as if she was inhumanely wronged, her voice was filled with grief at the injustice she suffered. Everyone couldn’t help feeling some pity for her upon hearing this, but they also realized her last words were filled with determination, as if she was on a crusade that was simply unavoidable.

The Jiang Family man let out a cold snort and snapped, “In that case, let’s see who wins in the end. 4.3 million!”

Zhou Ning Si smiled and continued, without flinching for even a moment, “4.4 million!”

Before the Jiang Family could raise the bid, another voice called out from a different private room, “4.5 million!”

The Jiang Family’s man was stunned and Zhou Ning Si too was taken aback while Yang Kai, who was sitting in room B9, turned to Kang Si Ran in amazement and asked sceptically, “Shopkeeper Kang, are you...”

It was actually Kang Si Ran who had called the bid just now, joining the race for the furnace.

Kang Si Ran smiled and said, “I’m just making some trouble for that slut.”

Yang Kai nodded in understanding.

“I was wondering who was poking his nose into my business, so it is Shopkeeper Kang. En, so you were still alive you old fogey?” Zhuo Ning Si spoke with obvious ridicule.

Kang Si Ran broke out into laughter and replied, “Many thanks, Shopkeeper Zhou, I’m very much alive and well.”

“So, it is Shopkeeper Kang.” Obviously, the Jiang Family master heard Kang Si Ran’s voice and recognized it, laughing as he commented, “Since your two chambers of commerce are interested in this Alchemy Furnace, my Jiang Family will withdraw; after all, we are not an opponent of your two forces.”

Apparently, he mistakenly believed that Zhuo Ning Si and Kang Si Ran were bidding on behalf of the chambers of commerce behind them, so he immediately and swiftly retreated. He could afford to offend Zhuo Ning Si for the Black Jade Furnace, but offending both major chambers of commerce together was not an option for the Jiang Family.

What he didn’t know was that Kang Si Ran was just bidding maliciously while it was uncertain whether Zhuo Ning Si was representing Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce.

“Many thanks.” When Kang Si Ran saw him misunderstand, he didn’t try to explain himself and just cupped his fists instead.

Zhuo Ning Si quickly cut in, “Shopkeeper Kang, now only you and I remain, I wonder what Shopkeeper Kang’s bottom line is.”

“No comment, just make your bid, if you don’t, this Black Jade Furnace will belong to this old master,” Kang Si Ran let out a cold snort.

Zhou Ning Si, having met with gruff rebuff, became annoyed and stopped trying to talk to Kang Si Ran, instead just bidding again.

For a time, only these two competed for the Black Jade Furnace, each of them raising the price by 100,000, soon bringing it to 5 million.

Only at this moment did a meaningful grin appear on Kang Si Ran’s lips as he generously said, “Shopkeeper Zhuo, seeing you persist like this, this old master has no choice but to relent. En, this old master will withdraw here.”

“Damn Old Ghost!” From Zhuo Ning Si’s room, the sound of cursing and grinding teeth could be heard. Although her voice wasn’t loud, many could still hear her clearly.

Kang Si Ran broke out into laughter with a look of satisfaction on his face.

Atop the stage, Drunkard smiled at the sight of this, taking a step forward to announce the winner of the Black Jade Furnace when suddenly, a male voice resounded from a private room in the A Block, “You’re finished, right? If both of you are done, then... 6 million!”

As soon as this bid was called out, the entire auction hall fell silent, while even Drunkard paused in place, turning to the source of the sound in astonishment.

Zhuo Ning Si, who thought that she finally obtained victory, had her pupils shrink sharply as her pretty face distorted in anger.

“6 million? Did I hear that right?”

“Who is this guy? He raised the bid by a million Source Crystals! Is he crazy?”

“Shhh, keep your voice down! Whoever he is, he’s sitting in the A Block so he must be a Dao Source Realm master. If he hears you, you’re dead!”

“So what if he’s a Dao Source master? Do Source Crystals not mean anything to him? A million... if they were given to me...”

After a moment of silence, the hall broke out into an uproar, with all the cultivators whispering amongst themselves; after all, it was truly frightening for someone to increase the price by a million Source Crystals all at once.

After giving it a bit of thought, Drunkard seemed to have realized the identity of the bidder and a trace of fear flashed across his eyes before he stepped back and stood quietly in place.

Inside her private room, Zhou Ning Si’s mood couldn’t be worse; after all, she had the fruit of victory snatched by some troublemaker at the last moment. No one would be in a good mood after encountering such a thing.

While she was just a Third-Order Origin King, she still represented Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce so after a moment of silence, she asked in a cold voice, “Dare I ask what Your Excellency’s honoured name is?”

The bidder in the A Block’s room didn’t seem to have any intention to answer her.

Zhou Ning Si was annoyed and snapped, “Showing the tail but hiding the head, Your Excellency, don’t you dare to reveal your name?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

After she said this, the bidder finally sneered, “What a farce, this one is only participating in the auction according to its rules. What’s wrong, do I have to report my name before I call a bid? What kind of auction house has such rules? Vice City Lord, does your Maplewood City’s auction house have this custom?”

His last question was addressed to Drunkard.

Drunkard furrowed his brow, but after pausing for a moment, he cupped his fists and said, “Friend, you must be joking! Maplewood City’s auctions don’t have such a rule.”

“Good! Shopkeeper Zhuo, I will let this offence go this time because you belong to Seven Glories of Chamber of Commerce, but if you dare use such an arrogant tone with me again, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” A vast and intense Divine Sense suddenly spread from the A Block private room and assailed Zhuo Ning Si at that moment.

Zhuo Ning Si couldn’t help but turn pale as she immediately realized that this man did not care at all about her identity or status and that if she kept pestering him, he might really get annoyed and act against her.

And judging by the strength of this Divine Sense, the other party didn’t seem to be just a First-Order Dao Source Realm master but rather a Second-Order Dao Source Realm master!

Maplewood City’s Lord, Duan Yuan Shan, was a Second-Order Dao Source Realm master and was an overlord in the surrounding hundred thousand kilometre region, so who knew where this man who was on par with him suddenly appeared from?

Even if Zhuo Ning Si had the backing of the Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce, with this man’s strength, killing Zhou Ning Si silently wouldn’t be any trouble.

After realizing this, Zhuo Ning Si quickly backed down, squeezed out a smile, and said, “Since Senior is interested in this Black Jade Furnace, then this Mistress will withdraw. Congratulations, Senior.”

Let alone the fact that 6 million Source Crystals had already exceeded Zhuo Ning Si’s bottom line, this man was a master she could not afford to offend. If she competed with him, she would be the only one to suffer. Understanding this, Zhuo Ning Si judged it best to offer some polite words and retreat.

No one had expected that the Black Jade Furnace, which was fought for by so many Sects and families, would eventually fall into the hands of a mysterious person who only offered one bid.

After Drunkard came to the front of the stage and called for other bids thrice, the ownership of the Black Jade Furnace was settled.

“How surprising! I didn’t expect that the Black Jade Furnace itself would go for 6 million, there’s even the Dao Source Fruit still left to auction off...” Kang Si Ran said with some depression in his voice. Although he had brought a lot of Source Crystals this time, seeing the intensity of the previous bidding, the Dao Source Fruit would probably have nothing to do with him, so he couldn’t help feeling frustrated.

Yang Kai also had no idea how to comfort him, so he just maintained his silence.

The next item auctioned was a Spirit Pill. Atop the stage, Drunkard put on a meaningful grin and said, “Regarding this Spirit Pill, please let this old man explain a little bit.”

While he was introducing the item, a maid had already arrived with a display tray.

After he lifted the red cloth covering the item, everyone immediately saw a navy blue, longan-sized Spirit Pill lying quietly on the jade place.

This Spirit Pill wasn’t inside a jade bottle, as if the auctioneer wasn’t worried about the medicinal efficacies dissipating from improper storage.

When a sharp-eyed cultivator saw the Spirit Pill, he immediately cried out in shock, “Pill Veins! This Spirit Pill actually formed Pill Veins!”

“What!? Let me see... you’re right, it’s really Pill Veins! So, Pill Veins look like this...”

“It’s not just that, take a good look, this Spirit Pill seems to be quite aged, wouldn’t that mean...”

Many cultivators started discussing the pill while Drunkard was all smiles, looking extremely satisfied with the effects of his actions.

Although some Spirit Pills had appeared already during the auction, no Spirit Pill had formed Pill Veins. This was the first.

Furthermore, many cultivators had never even seen a Spirit Pill with Pill Veins, so everyone found it extremely marvellous and kept gawking at it.
