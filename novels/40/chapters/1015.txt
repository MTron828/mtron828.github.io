Chapter 1015, You’ve Actually Possess Such An Ability?

Gui Zu, while still holding up Yang Kai, stared at He Zao strangely.

He Zao was obviously afraid of death, her tender body shivering noticeably, yet she still refused to turn her eyes away from Gui Zu’s.

Everyone was astonished.

Sword Union’s Yue Xi covered her mouth in shock and quickly called out, “What are you doing? Sit down and be quiet this instant!”

He Zao remained motionless though. Rather, she couldn’t sit down even if she wanted to. In the face of Gui Zu’s imposing manner, she didn’t have the strength to move a finger, cold sweat dripping down her pale face.

Suddenly, Gui Zu grinned smugly, his eyes wandering back over to Yang Kai and asking, “What’s your relationship with this little girl?”

“Chance acquaintances!”

“Did she fall in love with you at first sight then?”

“I don’t think so,” Yang Kai shook his head and turned his eyes to He Zao, his expression becoming somewhat subtle.

“Then why is she trying to help you now?” Gui Zu smiled even more meaningfully.

“He... he saved both me and my sister’s lives!” He Zao trembled and answered Gui Zu’s question.

“En, good, good! You’re quite clear about your gratitudes and grudges little girl... But if this old master were to let him go, would you be willing to take his place?” Gui Zu looked at He Zao and grinned wickedly.

He Zao’s face became paler and her trembling became fiercer, unable to immediately answer this question.

Yang Kai couldn’t help staring at her as well, wondering how she would answer.

Lu Gui Chen, Bi Ya and everyone else all watched He Zao with rapt attention while Yue Xi kept trying to silently warn her not to act impulsively.

Suddenly, He Zao drew a sharp breath and her eyes became firm, seemingly having arrived at a decision.

Opening her lips to speak her answer.

“There’s no need,” Yang Kai frowned and cut in, “Senior, you don’t need to pay her any attention, just get on with it!”

Gui Zu stared thoughtfully at Yang Kai for a moment before nodding, “Seems you still have some guts left, not allowing a woman to face danger for your sake. But don’t worry, this time, none of you can escape, all of you must go in!”

When this statement comes out, everyone abruptly went pale.

They had thought that this situation was the same as before, that Gui Zu would throw someone into the Void Corridor then be done with it. They thought that after Yang Kai died, they would be able to live on dishonourably for at least a little longer, none of them had anticipated that bad luck would actually fall on their heads so quickly.

Gui Zu had obviously decided to stake everything on today’s attempt.

After understanding this, everyone looked extremely bitter, feeling that this time they could not escape and that they would be following in the footsteps of their dead comrades soon enough.

The seven coloured sky surrounding them seemed to cloud over at this moment, making all of them feel incredibly gloomy.

“Brother Yang, walk slowly. Brother here will soon be accompanying you, at least you won’t be alone on the way!” Facing impending and inescapable death, Shen Tu didn’t forget to get in the last word with Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gently nodded.

“Little brat, go in!” Gui Zu didn’t want to waste any more time, attaching a wisp of his Spiritual Energy to Yang Kai’s body before tossing him into the swirling Void Corridor.

As he perceived the information transmitted back to him from that wisp, he lifted his hand towards He Zao who was still standing nearby and drew her over, laughing as he said, “Don’t be anxious little girl, this old master will send you to accompany your saviour soon enough. I hope your luck is good and you don’t die inexplicably like everyone before!”

“Old monster, one day someone will make you pay for all your evil deeds!” He Zao gnashed her teeth and spat.

“Less idle chatter!” Gui Zu didn’t pay her any mind, attaching another wisp of Spiritual Energy to her.

Just as he was about to throw He Zao into the Void Corridor though, Gui Zu suddenly went stiff, his pair of gloomy eyes shrinking up, a look of shock filling his face, seemingly having discovered something unbelievable.

The next moment, he shouted loudly, “Boy, you actually possess such an ability?!”

Saying so, he tossed away He Zao while letting out a burst of riotous laughter and disappeared from sight.

Even as he flew far away, everyone was still able to hear his mad laughter.

Atop the mountain, He Zao’s face was ashen as she sat there motionless, staring off in the direction Gui Zu left, not understanding what just happened.

He Miao rushed over, tears filling her eyes as she worriedly asked, “Elder Sister, are you alright?”

“I’m fine,” He Zao shook her head. Besides being wrapped up in Gui Zu’s Spiritual Energy wisp, making her feel slightly cold, she really was alright.

Gui Zu hadn’t done anything to her.

“What happened? Why did that strange old monster suddenly fly off?” Yue Xi also rushed up and asked.

Lu Gui Chen, Bi Ya, Shen Tu, and all the others quickly gathered around, each of them staring towards He Zao, hoping she could provide them with some kind of answer.

All of them thought that as the one standing closest to Gui Zu, she would have noticed some clues.

“I don’t know,” He Zao shook her head.

“You really don’t know?” Lu Gui Chen asked suspiciously.

“I really don’t know!”

“This is too strange, why did Senior just suddenly leave?”

“Could it have something to do with Yang Kai?” He Miao asked innocently, “Those words that old fogey shouted before he flew off were clearly referring to him.”

Hearing her say this, everyone suddenly thought back to what had just transpired and felt it was possible. As if Yang Kai had some kind of profound method that attracted Gui Zu’s attention.

However, Yang Kai had already been thrown into the Void Corridor by that point, so why did Gui Zu fly off in a completely different direction?

“Could that old guy have finally gone insane?” Shen Tu’s mouth twitched, only able to come up with such a reason for Gui Zu’s strange actions.

“It would be best if he forgets about our existences altogether!” Lu Gui Chen prayed self deprecatingly.

Somewhere above the Floating Continent, a tear in space suddenly opened and Yang Kai’s figure appeared from inside it.

Glancing around for a while, a deep frown appeared on Yang Kai’s face and he couldn’t help but curse.

He discovered that he was still in the strange continent.

Before he could even catch his breath though, Yang Kai sensed Gui Zu’s aura approaching him at lightning speed, and in the blink of an eye, a dark figure appeared on the horizon. Before he even arrived though, streams of resentful spirits rushed out from Gui Zu’s body and rushed over towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s face changed and he immediately tore space again, diving back into the turbulent flow of The Void.

When he appeared again, he was already several hundred kilometres away!

Gui Zu rushed over, spread out his Divine Sense, accurately locked onto Yang Kai’s current position, sneered deeply then continued the chase.

“Little brat, you certainly know how to conceal yourself, but regardless of how you try to run, you can’t escape from this old master’s palm!” Gui Zu spared no effort to pursue, vowing solemnly to capture Yang Kai.

Yang Kai, in turn, continued to flee, his heart filling with deep bitterness.

Since a year ago, when he had first been chosen by Gui Zu to enter the unstable Void Corridor, Yang Kai had been concealing his ability to tear space, not even hesitating to severely damage the Soul Clone he had been cultivating for ten years in order to not expose this method.

He had regarded it as his last life-saving method and was secretly counting on being able to leave this damned place by tearing space and returning to the Chaotic Abyss, thus escaping Gui Zu’s control.

However, today, when he had finally been forced to use this card, Yang Kai discovered that his thoughts had been too naive.

It seemed that because Gui Zu had built his unstable Space Array and haphazardly tested it over and over again, the space around the entire continent had become incredibly turbulent, making The Void in the surrounding area more dangerous than ever.

Even if Yang Kai had certain accomplishments in the Space Principle, he didn’t dare stay in that turbulent Void for too long.

This in turn meant that he couldn’t even catch his breath under the relentless pursuit of Gui Zu.

If not for these unfortunate circumstances, he could always hide in the Void and wait until Gui Zu thought he had died before quietly beginning to act.

Now he could only continue to tear space in order to flee from Gui Zu with great difficulty.

Every time he tore space, it would consume a massive amount of Yang Kai’s Saint Qi and Spiritual Energy, and displaying this Divine Ability four or five times had already made him breathless.

Yang Kai had a near-endless supply of Saint Qi, and even if he used all of it up, the Divine Tree could provide him with more, but supplementing his Spiritual Energy was not so easy.

Yang Kai gradually despaired, feeling like it was impossible for him to escape today.

“Junior, stop trying to run. As long as you’re still on this continent, you can’t escape!” Gui Zu’s voice sounded from far away but still rang clearly as if he was speaking right next to Yang Kai’s ear.

Yang Kai remained undeterred and continued to tear space, reappearing hundreds of kilometres away each time.

Gui Zu’s voice continually rang in his ear.

“Little brat, don’t refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a loss. If you dare continue to flee, when this old master finally catches you, you will pay the price!”

“Damn you, since you insist on opposing this old master, let’s see how long you can continue to hold out!”

“This old master knows you lack the ability to accomplish your objective! A tiny First-Order Saint like you, after tearing space so many times, how much power do you have left? Surrender without a fight and this old master won’t make things difficult for you.”

“Good good, stop! This old master won’t chase you any further, this old master swears to the Heavens he won’t harm a hair on your head, this old master means what he says!”

His attitude and words gradually began to change as he grew more and more surprised by Yang Kai’s performance, his confidence in being able to capture him beginning to waver.

Yang Kai expression finally changed, stopping in place and taking the opportunity to quickly swallow a few Saint Pills to supplement his Spiritual Energy while drinking a drop of Myriad Drug Milk in order to quickly refill his drained Knowledge Sea.

Gui Zu appeared a few dozen meters away in the next moment and gloomily stared towards Yang Kai, his expression filled with bitterness.

Grinning wickedly, he said, “Little brat, you really can surprise this old master. I didn’t think you could possess such means.”

“There’s much more you can’t think of,” Yang Kai tore space and hid half his body inside The Void, preparing to step inside at a moment’s notice.

“Don’t be so anxious, let’s talk about this,” Gui Zu raised his hands and wore his best smile on his face, trying to appear harmless to humans and animals alike, “This old master has seen your method quite clearly, but do you really believe this old master has no means to stop you? Don’t forget, this old master has also studied the Space Principle for a thousand!”

“Since you have such ability, why haven’t you used it yet? What are you worrying about?” Yang Kai said indifferently.

Gui Zu curled his lips, “If this old master really wants to stop you, he can, but whether you’d survive or not, this old master can’t guarantee, that’s why I’ve allowed you to carry on like this for so long. Don’t get too full of yourself.”
