Hei Yuan was moving across the void at the speed of lightning as he headed straight to a particular battlefield. When he finally arrived at his destination, what came into his sight were corpses and broken limbs scattered all around. They were the Black Ink Clansmen who were killed.

Many of the horribly injured Black Ink Clansmen groaned in pain. The battlefield was like a living Hell. After sweeping a glance over the place, Hei Yuan estimated that more than 100 Black Ink Clansmen were dead.

He sported a grim expression. Since he started chasing after Yang Kai, he had encountered the same sight many times. Whenever he received the news and rushed over, he would see the same sight. On the other hand, Yang Kai would always run away before he arrived, leaving no chance for him to act.

He had never come across a Human who was as skilled as Yang Kai when it came to fleeing. Despite his burning fury, he had no way to vent it out.

The surviving Black Ink Clansmen wouldn’t dare to go near Hei Yuan upon his arrival. Recently, Hei Yuan had killed many of their companions. If Hei Yuan blamed them for not doing their best and decided to kill them, they would be wronged.

In fact, they had tried their hardest to stop Yang Kai earlier; however, how were they supposed to make him stay behind when they were no match for him? They could only watch as Yang Kai went on a killing spree and then left.

Since no Black Ink Clansman took the initiative to tell him what happened, Hei Yuan asked grimly, “Where did he go?”

A High-Rank Black Ink Clansman closest to him pointed in a particular direction with caution.

Hei Yuan turned to look in that direction and frowned.

That was because his territory was in that direction. Although a large area of the void could be considered his territory, his foundation was where his Black Ink Nest was located. That was his direct territory.

Upon that realisation, Hei Yuan felt his chest tightening. As he recalled the route Yang Kai had been moving around, he suddenly had a bad premonition. It seemed that Yang Kai wasn’t aimlessly wandering around anymore, he was heading towards a particular goal.

Just then, a Feudal Lord rushed over from afar. Upon reaching Hei Yuan, he said anxiously, “Sir Territory Lord, something terrible has happened!”

“What makes you so nervous?” Hei Yuan turned to look at him, the ominous feeling in his chest strengthening.

This couldn’t be helped, as this Feudal Lord was in charge of the Fief that was closest to his Black Ink Nest. This Feudal Lord was also responsible for monitoring the perimeter. He must have received some shocking news, so he rushed over and informed Hei Yuan about it.

As expected, the Feudal Lord replied, “We’ve received word that Yang Kai is invading your territory, Sir.”

Hei Yuan’s head started buzzing as though it had been struck by a hammer. While feeling dizzy, he also instantly figured out Yang Kai’s plan and roared, “How dare he!”

He had never expected that Yang Kai, who was all on his own, didn’t have the intention of fleeing at all. Instead, he wanted to raise hell when most of the Black Ink Clan had left for war.

It had to be said that Yang Kai was truly audacious and his move caught Hei Yuan off guard.

Many of the Territory Lords who worked for Mu Guang had left their domains to deal with the Human Army from Yin-Yang Pass; therefore, there was a serious lack of soldiers in their home territories right now. That was also the reason Hei Yuan was unable to capture Yang Kai after such a long time.

Now, Yang Kai was heading straight to his territory. Although there were a lot of Feudal Lords left behind, Hei Yuan wasn’t confident that they could repel Yang Kai; after all, he had witnessed the latter’s capabilities during this pursuit.

On the other hand, it was apparent that Yang Kai was aiming for his Black Ink Nest.

The foundation of a Feudal Lord or Territory Lord’s territory was their Black Ink Nest. Without a Black Ink Nest, they couldn’t be considered a real Feudal Lord or Territory Lord.

This was what Zha Gu taught Yang Kai back then.

A massive amount of resources had to be consumed to grow a Black Ink Nest. For a Feudal Lord’s Black Ink Nest to hatch and fully mature, it required a colossal amount of resources, not to mention a Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest. In comparison, the resources needed to grow a Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest were many times more than what would be required to nurture a Feudal Lord’s Black Ink Nest.

If his Black Ink Nest was destroyed, Hei Yuan’s foundation would be gone for good. That would be an unbearable blow to him. Although he could still get a new sub-nest from the Royal Lord and hatch it, it would be a heavy burden on the Royal Lord’s Black Ink Nest. Furthermore, it would also cost the Royal Lord a lot of time and energy to do this.

Also, after such a catastrophic failure, it wasn’t even certain whether the Royal Lord would still give him a new sub-nest.

Throughout the war against the Humans, it wasn’t rare for Feudal Lord Black Ink Nests to be destroyed. However, only a tiny number of Black Ink Nests belonging to Territory Lords were ever destroyed. It was a great humiliation to the Black Ink Clan for a Territory Lord Black Ink Nest to be destroyed, and the only way to wash this shame away was by killing many more Humans.

With a great roar, Hei Yuan flew straight towards his home territory. At the same time, he prayed that the Feudal Lords who stayed behind could stop Yang Kai. He also hoped that Yang Kai didn’t really intend to destroy his Black Ink Nest.

However, it was apparent what Yang Kai’s plan was by him heading straight to his territory. It was likely that he had his eyes on the Black Ink Nest; after all, he had pretended to be a Black Ink Disciple and lived in this place for years, so he might have heard of the Black Ink Nests’ secrets from somewhere.

While feeling worried, Hei Yuan was moving forward at full speed.

Given that he was a Territory Lord, it would usually take him half a day to return to his territory from the previous location, but in his haste, he managed to arrive in just four hours.

When he finally arrived at the universe fragment where his direct territory was located, what came into his sight made him feel cold all over.

That was because the universe fragment had been shattered and traces of the battle could be seen everywhere. The originally flourishing city was nothing but a disaster zone now. Every part of the place had been turned into ruins, and innumerable Black Ink Clansmen had lost their lives.

All of that was inconsequential though compared to what happened to the Black Ink Nest, which was originally in the centre of the city. The Black Ink Nest, which had always looked like a giant flower bud, was starting to wither. Black Ink Strength was leaking out of the Black Ink Nest like fresh blood, and its roots had clearly been cut off by a violent force.

What Hei Yuan dreaded had become a reality, and he could not accept it.

The Black Ink Nest was withering, and it couldn’t be saved. In other words, his foundation had been destroyed. In order to rebuild his foundation, he would need a new Black Ink Nest.

Even if the Royal Lord was magnanimous enough to give him another sub-nest from her Black Ink Nest, it would take Hei Yuan at least 100 years to nurture it and cost him an enormous amount of money and manpower.

To make matters worse, the Feudal Lords working for him would all experience the same problem.

In other words, he and his subordinates had to rebuild everything from scratch, which would take a very long time.

“Sir!” A blood-soaked Feudal Lord detected Hei Yuan’s aura, so he quickly shot into the sky.

“Where is Yang Kai?” Hei Yuan growled through clenched teeth.

He couldn’t detect Yang Kai’s aura, so he could only hope that the Feudal Lords had killed him. With that said, he knew that it was unlikely to be the case.

“We did not see that Human named Yang Kai!” The Feudal Lord replied.

Hei Yuan snapped, “You didn’t see him? Then what happened to my territory!? What happened to the Black Ink Nest!? Did you all destroy it!?”

The Feudal Lord shuddered and quickly replied, “Sir Hei Yuan, we really didn’t see Yang Kai. Everything was destroyed by a Grand Dragon.”

He then hurriedly gave an account of what had happened.

According to this Feudal Lord, a Grand Dragon which was far more than 20,000 metres long had appeared out of nowhere. It was overbearing, and its entire figure radiated a golden glow. As soon as the Grand Dragon appeared, a lot of Black Ink Clansmen were killed by its opening Dragon Breath. Strangely, the Grand Dragon was holding a huge spear in its claws. With this weapon, it smashed the universe fragment to pieces and destroyed the Black Ink Nest, leaving the entire city in ruins.

What was even more outrageous to the Black Ink Clansmen was that the Grand Dragon had even robbed their shops and snatched up their resources.

Although the Feudal Lords tried their best to resist, they couldn’t possibly defeat the Grand Dragon. After kicking up a storm, the Grand Dragon nonchalantly departed, leaving this mess behind.

The Black Ink Clansmen knew nothing about Grand Dragons as they had never seen such creatures before. Fortunately for them, the Black Ink Disciples had some ideas.

“Grand Dragon? How could there be a Grand Dragon here?” Hei Yuan appeared puzzled.

The Feudal Lord replied cautiously, “According to the Black Ink Disciples, Yang Kai is probably not a Human, but rather a member of the Dragon Clan. That Grand Dragon was his true form.”

Hei Yuan roared, “I don’t care whether he’s a Human or a member of the Dragon Clan! Find him! I must rip him to pieces!” Only by doing so could he vent his fury. He was so enraged that he had even forgotten about the Royal Lord’s order, which stated that Yang Kai had to be captured alive.

“But Sir…” The Feudal Lord spoke in a shaking voice, “Since the Black Ink Nest is destroyed, we can’t send any messages.”

Hei Yuan grabbed him by the collar and yanked him towards himself, his eyes practically spitting fire as he snarled, “Since the Black Ink Nest is gone, go out and inform everyone yourself! Mobilise all the clansmen in the territory! Leave him nowhere to hide! If you can’t do that, all of you must die!”

“Yes!” The Feudal Lord replied anxiously.

After the Feudal Lord flew off, Hei Yuan turned to look in a different direction.

There seemed to be a mysterious force that was dissipating in the void. The energy fluctuations were consistent with what Yang Kai would leave behind each time he used Instantaneous Movement; therefore, Hei Yuan speculated that Yang Kai had fled in that direction.

Previously, he already didn’t have a way to capture Yang Kai, and now that his Black Ink Nest was gone, he knew it would be even harder to locate him. Nevertheless, he had to get his revenge after his foundation was destroyed.

Despite his slim chances, he had to hunt Yang Kai down. Regardless of the cost, he had to capture that damn Human and bring him to the Royal Lord to make up for his mistakes.

At this moment, in a place that was far away from the universe fragment, Yang Kai was hiding inside a Black Ink Cloud and recuperating.

After assuming his Grand Dragon Form and making a scene in Hei Yuan’s territory, not only did he shatter the universe fragment, but he also destroyed Hei Yuan’s Black Ink Nest. It was expected that he would be pleased with himself.

However, he had paid a hefty price to achieve this victory.

There were indeed a lot of Feudal Lords who had stayed behind, and there were also innumerable High-Rank and Low-Rank Black Ink Clansmen around. Although he could easily kill more people when he was in his Grand Dragon Form, it also made him a huge target. While Yang Kai destroyed the Black Ink Nest, he also inevitably got struck by the Black Ink Clansmen’s attacks.

To the Black Ink Clansmen, he had made a scene and left the place in a nonchalant manner; however, only Yang Kai knew that he wasn’t as nonchalant as he appeared to be when he left. In truth, he just didn’t dare to remain; otherwise, he would most likely be captured.

Presently, his entire figure was covered in wounds. Every time he moved, he would grimace in pain. Three wounds on his back were so deep that one could even see his bones.

Fortunately, these injuries didn’t injure his foundation, and given his intrepid physique and astonishing restorative powers, he would recover in no time.
