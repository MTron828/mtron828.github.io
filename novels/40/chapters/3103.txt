Yang Kai didn’t race after Yan Luo not because he was magnanimous, but because…

All of a sudden, a net shot out of a nearby forest towards Yan Luo. Yan Luo was caught off guard and swiftly captured. Shocked, he hurriedly pushed his Saint Qi to resist it, but he soon plunged into despair because he realised that the harder he tried to struggle, the tighter the net became. In just a short moment, he was wrapped up like a rice dumpling. The thin threads, which seemed to contain some sealing power, even dug into his flesh, causing him to be unable to use his Saint Qi.

At the other end of the net, an old man with a sallow face appeared. There was a smoking pipe in his hand as he gazed at Yang Kai with a conflicted expression.

After a moment of hesitation, he approached Yang Kai with his pipe in one hand and the bound Yan Luo in his other hand. Then, he sized up the young man and asked, “What is your cultivation realm?”

Although he was rejected by Yang Kai earlier, he wasn’t willing to give up so easily. Thinking that it would be a waste of talent if someone from the Star Field was killed by those from Azure Sea Palace, he secretly followed them. His intention was to save Yang Kai from trouble and make the young man owe him a favour, thereby luring him to join the Eternal Life Pavilion.

However, instead of reaching his goal, he watched a hair-raising show.

The two First-Order Dao Source Realm Masters were killed by this young man with ease, which meant that it also wouldn’t take him much effort to end his life either. What horrified this old man though was that he couldn’t even see through Yang Kai’s cultivation.

Even if Yang Kai had an artifact that could cover up his cultivation, he couldn’t possibly hide it after taking action; however, from beginning to end, his cultivation had remained a mystery.

“How should I address you, Elder?” Yang Kai smiled at him.

The old man replied, “Xu Hou Tu.”

Yang Kai uttered, “Elder Xu, many thanks for lending me a hand.”

In a helpless manner, Xu Hou Tu shook his head. Yang Kai was able to kill two Dao Source Realm Masters with ease, so there was no way a trivial Third-Order Origin King could turn the situation around. Even if he didn’t make a move, this man called Yan Luo would never have been able to escape. Given how he immediately changed the topic though, it was apparent Yang Kai was unwilling to answer the old man’s question.

After giving it a thought, the old man said, “There are about ten Dao Source Realm Masters in Azure Sea Palace. What’s more, the Palace Master is in the Second-Order Dao Source Realm. Since you’ve killed two of their people, they won’t let you off.”

Yang Kai replied, “I’m not interested in slaughtering an entire Sect, but if they insist on asking for death, I won’t be magnanimous.”

Xu Hou Tu was shocked upon hearing that. He was just telling Yang Kai some information about Azure Sea Palace, but at the same time, he was also trying to probe him. Seeing that the young man had no regard at all for a Second-Order Dao Source Realm Master, he knew that he had still underestimated him.

As such, he gave up the idea of inviting him to join the Eternal Life Pavilion. Even if a Master like Yang Kai was willing to join his Sect, he would bring immense pressure and worry to everyone else.

But, how was this possible? He had personally seen Yang Kai arrive from a Lower Star Field, so how could the latter possess such incredible strength? Which Star Field could nurture this kind of monster? There was no precedent like this in the past.

“Little Friend, why have you come to the Ancestral Domain?”

Since he couldn’t lure him to join his Sect, the old man reckoned he could at least strike up a relationship with him. Perhaps this friendship would be useful in the future.

After a moment of deliberation, Yang Kai replied, “I came here because I wish to travel to a different Star Field through the Ancestral Domain.”

Yang Kai knew that Xu Hou Tu wasn’t a wicked person judging from the fact that the latter had followed him to this place. Moreover, he knew nothing about the Ancestral Domain, nor could he rely on He Yun Xiang since she was as clueless as he. So, he might achieve his goal faster with the help of a local.

“I am not originally from Unending Star Field. I just happened to be stranded there and want to return to my native Star Field.”

Hearing that, Xu Hou Tu finally understood what was going on, “I see.”

The Ancestral Domain was supposedly connected to all Star Fields. Many Masters had discussed before the feasibility of using the Ancestral Domain as a terminal to head to other Star Fields. Their conclusion was that it was possible, but they would have to pay a hefty price, and it required them to be extremely powerful.

“But I’m not sure how I can go home. Elder Xu, do you have any suggestions?” Yang Kai asked.

Xu Hou Tu replied, “Little Friend, I’ll have to ask which Star Field you want to go to first. It’s not that I want to boast, but I’ve lived in the Ancestral Domain for many centuries now and have come into contact with many cultivators from different Star Fields. So perhaps I know someone from your Star Field.”

Yang Kai’s gaze brightened, “Elder Xu, then, have you heard of Heng Luo Star Field before?”

Xu Hou Tu gave it a serious thought, but to Yang Kai’s disappointment, he shook his head, “No.”

Then, he consoled the young man by saying, “However, the Ancestral Domain is extremely vast. People from my Sect have been guarding only five Star Road Portals, so I can at least tell you that these portals do not connect to Little Friend’s Heng Luo Star Field.”

Yang Kai asked curiously, “You mean, there are many such portals like the one just now?”

“Haha. There are hundreds of them.”

Yang Kai was astounded.

Xu Hou Tu went on to say, “Your best option would be to visit other Star Road Portals and ask the ones waiting at them about it. If the people from your homeland have come to the Ancestral Domain, you will surely obtain some useful information from those at the portals.”

“Where are all these portals?”

Xu Hou Tu pondered on it for a moment before flicking his wrist, upon which two Space Rings flew towards him. The rings belonged to the deceased Yan Ren Hao and Duan Mu Qi. He forcefully erased the seals on those rings and then searched them.

Then, he took out something that looked like a scroll and tossed it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai took it and looked doubtfully at him.

Xu Hou Tu uttered, “Try infusing your Divine Sense into it.”

Hearing that, Yang Kai unrolled the scroll open and poured his Divine Sense into it. The next moment, dots of light suddenly lit up on the scroll.

Yang Kai his brow and poured more Spiritual Energy into it, upon which the light dots appeared closer now.

These light dots were mostly very far from his current location, but there was one that looked like it was quite a nearby place.

Xu Hou Tu explained, “This is a Star Road Chart. All the portals that have been discovered in the Ancestral Domain are recorded here. The closest portal to you is the one you just passed through to reach the Ancestral Domain.”

Yang Kai withdrew his Divine Sense and stored the scroll. Elated, he said, “This is indeed a good thing.”

With a smile, Xu Hou Tu uttered, “This thing isn’t that valuable in the Ancestral Domain. Almost any Sect or individual with a little background can afford to buy a similar Star Road Chart.”

With a solemn expression, Yang Kai cupped his fists, “Many thanks for your guidance, Elder Xu.”

With this Star Road Chart, he could go to different Star Road Portals to ask for more information. At that instant, Yang Kai’s plan for the future had been set.

“It was just a minor matter, so there’s no need to thank me. I hope that you’ll achieve your goal soon.”

“I’ll take advantage of your auspicious words.”

“En, please carry on then, I’ll help you handle the situation here.”

Yang Kai bowed his head, “I’ll be troubling you then, Elder Xu. Farewell.”

Then, he beckoned to He Yun Xiang, upon which they left the place on the Star Shuttle.

Just as they left, something flew through the air. Xu Hou Tu reached out and caught a round object in his hand, and upon a closer look, he was astonished.

It was a Spirit Pill that he had never seen before, but he could feel that the pill contained medicinal efficacies that were beyond his imagination. Excited, he began fantasizing about what kind of transformation he would go through after he took this pill.

He had intended to gain some benefits in the future by helping Yang Kai, but he didn’t expect that the reward would come so soon.

Then, he took a look at the sobbing Chen Chui Ling and the bound Yan Luo. After that, he lit up his pipe and drew in a deep breath. Following that, he puffed out the smoke and it soon covered a large area. When the smoke disappeared, there was no longer anyone at the scene.

…

“Sir, where are we going now?” He Yun Xiang asked while she flew the Star Shuttle.

Having just witnessed that Yang Kai had killed two people who were in the realm above Origin King Realm, she grew even more respectful of him.

Yang Kai tossed the Star Road Chart to her and replied, “Visit every place that’s recorded on this.”

He didn’t know where the portal that connected Heng Luo Star Field and the Ancestral Domain was. He didn’t even know whether such a portal existed. Since he knew nothing, he had no choice but to investigate each portal one by one.

Although it was quite a silly and time-consuming method, it was the best way he could think of for now.

He Yun Xiang nodded before she took the Star Road Chart and infused her Divine Sense into it. Upon confirming their location and destination, she steered her Star Shuttle towards a particular light dot. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Five days later, they reached a desolate swamp area. There was a huge puddle of water somewhere in the swamp, and in the water, lights of different colours undulated. Looking at it from above, the puddle of water appeared quite mysterious.

The colourful lights were vivid and flowing, swirling in a particular pattern that was clearly a Star Road Portal!

Around the puddle, there were some cultivators standing guard. Some of them exuded an aura that suggested that they were in the Dao Source Realm as they sat in place to meditate and adjust their breathing.

Although they were waiting for new people here, it was quite a boring task. So, they spent most of their time cultivating. By doing so, they wouldn’t slow down their progress. Nevertheless, the environment here was hostile.

The flash of light in the distance had attracted the attention of those guarding this place and those cultivators, who were meditating, opened their eyes in displeasure in an attempt to find out who had the guts to disturb them.

The light faded, upon which a Star Shuttle was revealed. All of their gazes brightened when they saw an alluring lady piloting it. She was standing at the front of the Star Shuttle, and behind her was a young man. What made them displeased was that the young man was lying on the Star Shuttle with his head resting on his arms while his legs had crossed, appearing carefree.

[Who is this arrogant man?]

After they scanned the young man with their Divine Sense, they were all shocked, because they couldn’t find out whether he had cultivated before or not.

Standing on the Star Shuttle, He Yun Xiang put on an elegant smile and said in a soft voice, “Pardon me for disturbing all of you. There’s something I need to ask.”

A beautiful woman naturally had an advantage when it came to negotiations. Moreover, she was quite polite, so it was hard for them to feel repulsed by her.

“What do you want to ask?”

“Have you heard about Heng Luo Star Field before?”

One of them replied, “Yes.”

He Yun Xiang’s gaze brightened as she didn’t expect that they could gain some useful information on their first stop. With a joyful expression, she gazed at the person and asked, “Can you tell me more about it?”

It was a burly man whose muscles were bulged up noticeably. Upon hearing that, he replied with a meaningful smile, “Good. Why don’t you follow me to a quiet place? I’ll tell you everything you want to know.” As he spoke, he winked at her.

In an instant, He Yun Xiang’s face fell. Meanwhile, at the back of the Star Shuttle, Yang Kai closed his eyes again, seemingly going to sleep.
