Worried about this very possibility, Mo Yu immediately added, “Of course, if you Sect Master Yang feels this is inappropriate then just pretend this old master had not asked.”

“Inappropriate?” Yang Kai shook his head slowly while saying casually, “Since Senior Mo is the Honoured Master of Sister Chen and Sister Lu Ying, this Junior certainly won’t refuse. Not to mention departing for the Emperor Garden from here, if Senior Mo likes, you are free to wait here in my High Heaven Sect until the day arrives.”

As soon as this statement came out, Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying, who had been standing behind Mo Yu, both had a brilliant light flash across their beautiful eyes as they cast grateful looks towards Yang Kai.

Mo Yu also wore a look of joy on his face, not previously expecting Yang Kai to agree so easily. He had still been considering whether he should have Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying ask personally if Yang Kai refused, but it seems there was no need to do so at all now.

Mo Yu deeply admired Yang Kai’s forthrightness; after all, this kind of matter was not something to be casually decided upon. Clearly, the other party so readily agreeing was completely because of Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying’s face.

Although these two disciples of his did not have the best of aptitudes, their luck was quite good and they had made a very good friend. Mo Yu immediately felt relieved and offered his sincere thanks. As for Yang Kai inviting him to remain here in High Heaven Sect, Mo Yu naturally had not taken him seriously as it was obvious that this was simply Yang Kai being polite.

High Heaven Sect had only just been founded, and certainly had many matters to attend to, having Yang Kai agree to let Clear Sky Sect use it as a staging ground on the day the Emperor Garden opened was already more than Mo Yu could have expected, so how could he be brazen enough to remain and take advantage of the latter’s hospitality as well?

“En, Elder Qian and Shadow Moon Hall’s contingent are also welcome to set out for the Emperor Garden from my High Heaven Sect!” Yang Kai turned his head to Qian Tong and spoke.

“If that’s the case, this old master will offer his thanks in advance,” Qian Tong grinned meaningfully, not bothering to be polite. Yang Kai had already agreed to allow Clear Sky Sect to enter the Emperor Garden from here, so he definitely would not refuse Shadow Moon Hall doing the same; Qian Tong understood this well.

“Sister Dai Yuan, if you’re interested, you can also set out from here,” Yang Kai looked over at Dai Yuan and said, adding afterwards, “But the others from Coloured Glass Sect may not.”

Although Yang Kai was good to his friends, that did not mean he was charitable to others. Allowing these people to enter the Emperor Garden from High Heaven Sect was all because he had personal friendships with them, but that did not mean he would extend the same courtesy to Coloured Glass Sect. He had no friendship with anyone else in Coloured Glass Sect, and even had a grudge with Yin Su Die. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Dai Yuan’s face became gloomy as she smiled bitterly, “Dai Yuan thanks Junior Brother Yang for his kindness, but... I probably won’t have an opportunity to enter the Emperor Garden.”

Yang Kai frowned but soon understood why she said this. In Coloured Glass Sect, Dai Yuan was not thought of very highly. If there really was a disciple from the younger generation eligible to enter the Emperor Garden, it would be Yin Su Die, not her; after all, the quotas for entering were simply too precious.

Qian Tong, however, grinned meaningfully and said, “Dai Yuan, there’s no need to belittle yourself so. If it was before, I’d agree that you really don’t have a chance to enter the Emperor Garden, but now... heh heh, although this old master doesn’t dare make a guarantee, there’s probably at least a seventy percent chance you will be able to, as long as that old fogey Gong Xing He hasn’t gone senile yet.”

Dai Yuan’s brow furrowed slightly as she turned to look at Qian Tong in surprise, seemingly not understanding why he would make such an assertion.

However, she was not a fool and quickly understood after some thought!

Indeed, if it were before, she would not have a chance to enter the Emperor Garden, but now, the only one who had any kind of relationship with Yang Kai in Coloured Glass Sect was her. They could even be considered close friends. If Coloured Glass Sect really wanted to be on good terms with Yang Kai, they would not mistreat Dai Yuan.

And did Coloured Glass Sect want to be on good terms with Yang Kai? Absolutely.

Without even mentioning that High Heaven Sect was the best place to enter the Emperor Garden from, the Origin King Grade Starship in Yang Kai’s possession was not something Coloured Glass Sect’s Sect Master Gong Xing He could ignore. He was also a master at the peak of the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm and wanted to break through to the Origin King Realm!

To break through to the Origin King Realm, one needed to leave Shadowed Star to escape the shackles of the World Principles here.

The only way to do this, however, was by travelling aboard Yang Kai’s Origin King Grade Starship.

As such, Gong Xing He definitely wanted to be on good terms with Yang Kai and High Heaven Sect, which would lead to Dai Yuan having an opportunity to obtain an Emperor Jade in turn.

Considering all this, Dai Yuan could not help feeling excited as she cast her beautiful eyes towards Yang Kai with gratitude.

Although this matter was far from certain, she now had a chance to enter the Emperor Garden at least, and it was all because of Yang Kai.

When a person’s ability and resources reach a certain level, they can affect the destiny of others, both subtly and overtly! Before now, Dai Yuan had not really given such sentiments much thought, but now she was able to experience it personally, astonishing her somewhat.

With Dai Yuan immediately understanding the crux of this matter, Yang Kai naturally wasn’t ignorant of it either, grinning as he said, “Sister Dai Yuan, after returning to your Sect, please mention to Senior Gong that if Coloured Glass Sect’s delegation is lead by you, this Sect Master would have no reason to not allow them to depart for the Emperor Garden from High Heaven Sect!”

As soon as this remark came out, Dai Yuan’s tender body shivered as she bit her thin lip, not knowing what to say, only able to wear a look of gratitude on her face that everyone was able to understand.

Yang Kai’s words just now were tantamount to forcing Coloured Glass Sect to give her an entry quota!

Although his remarks may have sounded somewhat overbearing, Coloured Glass Sect would obviously make a smart choice; after all, Dai Yuan was a disciple of Coloured Glass Sect, so if she obtained some benefits from the Emperor Garden, it would also increase Coloured Glass Sect’s strength.

Taking a deep breath, Dai Yuan slowly got up and elegantly bowed to Yang Kai. Although she did not speak any words, this gesture was enough to express her attitude.

Qian Tong and the others present all observed this with thought-provoking smiles.

In truth, the few old men present did not quite understand why a young man like Yang Kai cared so much about a woman like Dai Yuan; after all, she was unattractive!

Unattractive was putting it politely, ugly was really the only way Dai Yuan’s face could be described!

However, as a result, their evaluations of Yang Kai rose further, thinking this boy was not someone who judged others by appearance, placing more importance on sentiment and friendship.

After Dai Yuan excitedly took her seat again, Yang Kai suddenly had a thought and grinned as he asked, “Several Seniors, if you can, I’d like you to help this Junior with a little something.”

“Oh?” Qian Tong looked at Yang Kai with a surprised look, “Boy, your means and methods are now extraordinarily high. What do you need our help for? Well, whatever it is, feel free to mention it, it’s a chance for we old masters to do you a favour.”

Fei Zhi Tu and Mo Yu also nodded, turning to Yang Kai curiously.

Yang Kai smiled treacherously and whispered a few words to them.

After Qian Tong and the others heard what he said, they all exchanged a somewhat blank glance before grinning themselves, Qian Tong putting on a forced smile, “Boy, you’re seriously quite crafty. If this kind of news gets out, you’ll likely be able to achieve your objective in short order!”

“Exactly. High Heaven Sect now occupies this incredible geographical advantage, so not using it to your advantage to do some business would be a shame!” Fei Zhi Tu grinned fiercely.

“I’m simply making use of local resources, drinking fresh water from the local stream. Several Seniors don’t need to taunt this Junior,” Yang Kai quickly waved his hand.

“Rest assured, after this old master leaves here, he will definitely spread the word for you, and... even if we don’t say anything, those people outside will probably come here on their own to ask. In fact, I’m sure they’re impatiently trying to figure out a way to do just that right now,” Mo Yu chuckled.

Yang Kai’s eyes flashed as he could not help somewhat looking forward to the future.

This was understandable though. Just now, he had asked Qian Tong and the others here to spread word that High Heaven Sect intended to sell several spots to outside Sects to depart from inside the Flowing Flame Sand Field on the day the Emperor Garden opened.

However, there would only be three such spots, and as for the price, Yang Kai did not mention one, simply implying that whichever great force bids the highest would win the best starting position.

The best spot and the worst spot would mean a difference of three to four hours extra distance from the Emperor Garden.

If anyone was willing to offer up an Emperor Jade, their Sect would even be allowed to set off directly from High Heaven Sect’s Front Court.

Yang Kai currently only had two Emperor Jades, but High Heaven Sect required at least three. He and Yang Yan needed to enter the Emperor Garden, and Ye Xi Yun would certainly need to accompany them as well; after all, she was one of, if not the, strongest master on Shadowed Star, having her by their side would increase their safety margin greatly. Lacking this last Emperor Jade, Yang Kai had been somewhat worried, but now there was a good chance for him to solve this problem.

Departing from High Heaven Sect’s Front Court to enter the Emperor Garden had an incredible appeal, one strong enough that trading an Emperor Jade might be worth it.

Qian Tong and the others praised his proposal, but also warned Yang Kai to remain cautious and not let the people he sold these spots to take advantage of him.

Yang Kai naturally nodded. Since he had decided to do this, he would certainly not make any careless mistakes, planning on having Yang Yan arrange several powerful Spirit Arrays at the designated departure spots so as not to let outsiders wander about freely in his territory.

If anyone dared to leave the designated spots, he would show them no mercy!

As such, this danger was not difficult to avoid.

Afterwards, Yang Kai politely asked Qian Tong and the others for their insights about breaking through to the Origin Returning Realm, a request to which everyone freely offered their own experiences and comprehensions, allowing Yang Kai to benefit greatly.

In particular, the opinions of Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er were extremely helpful to Yang Kai; after all, these two had only broken through recently, so many of their experiences and insights were still quite fresh in their mind. Although their overall comprehension of this matter fell behind Qian Tong and other masters’, they won out in terms of familiarity and understandability.

Dai Yuan also listened very seriously!

Like Yang Kai, she was a peak Third-Order Saint King and would enter retreat to break through to the Origin Returning Realm after returning to Coloured Glass Sect. She also had the Origin Condensing Pill that Yang Kai had given her a while back, so she was completely confident in succeeding.

After half a day, Yang Kai got up and saw his guests off from the reception hall. Outside, Wu Yi personally escorted them out of the Flowing Flame Sand Field via the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle.

Sitting in the reception hall, Yang Kai sank into contemplation for a moment before taking out his communication artifact and pouring his Divine Sense into it.

A moment later, Yang Yan arrived.

Yang Kai told her about his idea of selling departure spots, causing Yang Yan to nod in praise and immediately set off to start making preparations. After all, this news would draw the attention of countless forces and would no doubt set off intense competition.

Silavin: Dang. This was really an unexpected plan. Quite creative.
