If it was before, she would never dare to rush over like this no matter how much she wanted to, but now it was different. She had the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal in her hands that had millions of Monster Beast Souls sealed inside, including many at the Twelfth-Order. As such, Zhang Ruo Xi believed that with the help of this artifact, she would certainly be helpful.

Even the slightest force could have some effect as long as it could appear and contribute at the right moment.

But just as her figure rose up, she felt her ankle being tightly grabbed by someone before she was pulled back down.

After falling down on the trunk again, Ruo Xi angrily shouted, “Third Senior, what are you doing?”

The one to pull her down was none other than the Ice Heart Valley Third Elder, who was still with her. Had it not been for the Third Disciple helping her out with her strength and camouflaging ability, it would have been impossible for Zhang Ruo Xi to get this close.

After all, she was just a Third-Order Dao Source Realm while right now, Mid Twelfth-Order Monster Race Masters could be found everywhere. Only the Third Disciple could bring Zhang Ruo Xi here without anyone noticing them with her mystical camouflaging technique.

The Third Disciple looked terrified seeing Zhang Ruo Xi angry, but she kept waving her hands as she pointed in the direction of the battlefield before bringing it back closer to her neck and sliding across it, at the same time, she also stretched her tongue out…

Ruo Xi grimly stated, “I know that it’s dangerous over there, and my life might even be in danger…but Sir is on that side. I need to help him.”

The Third Disciple grabbed Zhang Ruo Xi’s hands and shook her head like a rattle; it didn’t look like she was going to let her go.

Ruo Xi heaved a sigh and gently added, patting the back of Third Disciple’s hand, “Sir has taught and raised me. Ruo Xi has never gotten any chance to repay him for so many years of kindness. Now, Ruo Xi finally has some power to help Sir. I can’t keep watching from here. Senior, please let me go. Even if I die, Ruo Xi will never regret it!”

Who knows whether the Third Disciple understood her or not, but regardless, she tightly held Ruo Xi’s hand and wasn’t planning on letting it go.

“Third Senior, I will hate you if you keep this up!” Ruo Xi grew anxious.

The Third Disciples pursed her lips, grinning at her. Her teeth were white as jade, forming a sharp contrast with her dirty face.

At the Blood Gate, Elder was waiting with a solemn look on his face. His hand on his cane nervously clenched.

Although the eight Great Kings had decided to cooperate after his persuasion, there were still thirty-two Monster Kings apart from the eight Great Kings. The thirty-two Monster Kings weren’t much weaker than the eight Great Kings.

If the thirty-two Monster Kings also rushed over, the Stone Spirit Clan might not be able to block them with their strength alone. At that time, all the Stone Spirits could only form a circle around Yang Kai, protecting him in the middle. They would then have to try to defend him as long as possible before withdrawing once there was no more hope.

But something happened that surprised him.

The thirty-two Monster Kings, who were rushing over, all stood at a distance after being ordered by the burly Great King, seemingly planning to enjoy the show with no intention of intervening in the fight.

[I guess…the temptation of the Blood Gate is pretty big.]

Elder knew the reason why the thirty-two Monster Kings were standing by. It wasn’t because the prestige of the burly Great King was extraordinarily high, nor was it because the Stone Spirit Clan was extremely strong, rather it was because they were also interested in the Blood Gate being opened. They hoped that the Stone Spirit Clan could break the seal on the Blood Gate, allowing them to reap the reward without doing anything.

Elder suddenly felt a burden lift off his shoulder. But soon, Elder secretly began worrying again.

In this situation, if Yang Kai could tear the space barrier and crack the Blood Gate seal, it was all fine and well. At that time, all the Monster Race Masters would move together and they would all charge straight into the Blood Gate.

But if Yang Kai failed…

Not to mention the Eight Great Kings would no longer hold themselves back, even the thirty-two Monster Kings would not let the Stone Spirit Clan go after being disappointed. At that time, nearly forty peak Twelfth-Order Masters would attack them together, and the Stone Spirit Clan would have no power to fight back!

Thinking of this, Elder’s expression turned serious and even his mood grew heavier.

“Elder!”

At this moment, Yang Kai suddenly shouted.

“Yes!” Elder hurriedly responded. As he turned his head to look, he noticed that the space around the Blood Gate was distorted but there were no signs of the seal breaking.

“Are you sure the painting you showed me was really a prophecy left by the Wood Spirit’s previous Matriarch at the cost of her remaining life?” Yang Kai kept moving his hands, but his face was darker than the bottom of a pot.

“Indeed, why? What’s wrong?” Elder felt a pang of guilt. Nevertheless, he answered very confidently, as if he didn’t know the meaning of lying.

“Is this Young Master really the one in the revelation?” Yang Kai continued asking.

Elder had a faint premonition in his heart as he forced himself to answer, “It must be so!”

“Prophecy my foot!” Yang Kai angrily shouted, “This damn seal, this Young Master can’t crack it!”

“Ah? How come!?” The Elder’s heart jumped, but how could he let Yang Kai back down, immediately persuading, “The Blood Gate seal is extraordinary and not that easy to crack. Honoured Guest, why don’t you try a bit more. There is no hurry.”

“It’s not a question of time,” Yang Kai heaved a sigh before withdrawing his hands, allowing the distorted space to stabilize once again. He then turned to the Elder and stated, “Everything I’ve tried is completely ineffective, I can’t even sense the spatial barrier, so how am I supposed to crack the seal? It’s futile to continue. Elder, I think we should withdraw, taking advantage of their cooperation. If we delay any longer, the four Divine Venerables might return.”

The Elder asked in surprise, “Weren’t those four lured away by Honoured Guest’s brilliant plan?”

Yang Kai stared at him with a sidelong glance as he replied, “They aren’t fools. They will definitely notice something is amiss, and once they do, they will immediately return. Three thousand kilometres is nothing to those four, and if we don’t leave now, we won’t be able to when they return.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Elder sunk into silence. Although he knew that Yang Kai was right, he felt that it would be a shame to give up now since things had reached this point.

His face turned serious as he requested, “Guest, please step aside, let this Elder and Shi Jiu give it a try.”

Yang Kai knew that he was unwilling to give up, but he didn’t stop him either, instead just angrily stating, “The previous Wood Spirit Clan Matriarch has landed me in big trouble.”

Had it not been for the nine ancient paintings in the tree cave, Yang Kai would have never agreed to the Stone Spirit Clan’s request this easily. Because he really believed he might be the saviour of the two clans, he came to give it a try, but from the start, he was unable to do anything.

He couldn’t figure out why the last Wood Spirit Clan Matriarch left those nine paintings before she died. [The Human in those paintings is clearly me, but why can’t I open the Blood Gate?]

While he was filled with unwillingness, the Elder and Xiao Xiao were already giving out a war cry together.

Xiao Xiao, who was originally ten metres tall, swelled again as he became a fifteen metres tall stone giant.

And the Elder, who had always given the impression of being extremely old and feeble, looked like he had suddenly been given a second life. His rickety waist became completely straight as he turned into a stone giant that was taller than Xiao Xiao with cracking sounds. Not only that, but the layer of rocks on him was like an extra layer of muscles, filled with explosive power.

They looked at each other before Xiao Xiao raised the Heaven Shaking Pillar and smashed it down hard.

*Hong…*

A deafening clap immediately followed. The strike that was strong enough to destroy Heaven and shatter the Earth actually caused the Blood Gate to flicker a little, but very soon, it regained its calm.

As Xiao Xiao withdrew his Heaven Shaking Pillar, Elder punched straight at the Blood Gate.

Struck by the giant fist, a deafening clap rang as the Blood Gate shook, but it remained as strong as a sheet of iron.

*Hong hong hong…*

A series of deafening claps rang as Xiao Xiao and the Elder kept bombarding the Blood Gate one after another. The Stone Spirit Clan’s explosive power was being completely unleashed at this moment. Even if it was a thousand-metre tall mountain, these two could flatten it with just one blow, but the Blood Gate wasn’t showing any signs of breaking.

“That Human was unable to break the seal. Do they want to break it with brute force?” Hu Li, seeing what was happening now, had naturally guessed what the Stone Spirit Clan wanted to do.

“But it seems useless!” Another Monster King stated, furrowing his brow.

“The Stone Spirit Clan’s brute strength can be considered the strongest in the world. Even the Divine Spirits fall behind in that particular aspect. If they can’t break it, then the Blood Gate…”

The mood of the group of Monster Race Masters suddenly sank to the bottom, realizing that there was little hope of breaking the seal.

Before, they were filled with anticipation, looking forward to the moment the Blood Gate seal was broken, but at this moment, this anticipation had slowly turned into a deep disappointment.

The Monster Kings were only disappointed, but the eight Great Kings were also angry.

They had been putting on a show with the Stone Spirit Clan, turning a blind eye to their actions and allowing them to do whatever they wanted at the Blood Gate.

How could they have known that the Stone Spirit Clan would be unable to do anything at all? All their anticipation had gone to waste.

If the Divine Venerables found out about this later, they would definitely not be pardoned.

Furthermore, after such a big commotion, the Divine Venerables would definitely notice something soon and come to investigate.

*Hong…*

Another deafening clap rank as the Heaven Shaking Pillar in Xiao Xiao’s hands was reduced into fragments as its pieces flew in all directions.

The Heaven Shaking Pillar was something Yang Kai had obtained when he had ventured into the Emperor Garden on Shadowed Star. It had been Xiao Xiao’s weapon since then, but it finally broke today.

Xiao Xiao was shocked by the shattering of the Heaven Shaking Pillar.

Immediately afterwards, Elder’s punch was also unsuccessful, and a sliver of despair slowly appeared in his eyes.

“Elder, it’s time to leave,” Yang Kai, observing the eight Great Kings’ expressions and bearing, noticed that they were both becoming increasingly ugly. He secretly felt that their patience was reaching the limit, so he couldn’t help but urge.

The Elder didn’t answer, and kept punching at the Blood Gate with Xiao Xiao, giving rise to deafening claps.

“Elder!” Yang Kai shouted, “Where there is life, there is hope. If we don’t leave now, the Stone Spirit Clan will surely be annihilated today!”

This sentence finally woke the Elder from his daze, and he loosened his fist with a heavy look on his face, unwillingly shouting, “Let’s go!”

“You think you can come and go as you please? How can there be such an easy thing in the world!” The burly Great King’s voice turned colder as he attacked, showing no restraint this time. Terrifying Monster Qi surged from him as he punched straight at the Stone Spirit’s chest right before him.

The Stone Spirit had failed to react in time and was knocked back several dozen metres, flipping through the air.

The muscular Great King was extremely angry too. He felt that he had been tricked, so, naturally, he didn’t want the Stone Spirit Clan to leave so easily.
