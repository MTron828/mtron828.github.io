More than half a month ago when Nanmen Da Jun returned to High Heaven Palace from Azure Sun Temple, Yang Kai passed him the Thousand Illusions Butterfly for him to bring back. The reason Yang Kai attached so much importance to the Thousand Illusions Butterfly was that he himself was able to benefit greatly from his adventures inside it.

The Thousand Illusions Dreamworld was sure to become one of High Heaven Palace’s foundations. Compared to it, the Heavenly Tone Temple, which was set up with the Heavenly Music Treasure Box as the core, seemed much less useful.

But the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld was not a static thing. Each cultivator that entered it may encounter a different illusion, and not only were those illusions real enough to pass off as genuine, they were also born out of reality, so truth and falsehood were almost indistinguishable. However, the benefits they are able to gain in the illusion were enough to allow a person’s strength to receive a significant boost.

In particular, the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld had the amazing ability to distort time, which was simply invaluable. Chi Yue and the others were Yang Kai’s elders and relatives, so Hua Qing Si chose them to be the first group to enter the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld. As proven by facts, each one of them was able to gain something from inside.

The Thousand Illusions Dreamworld was a huge treasure, and it was impossible for them to extract everything about it at once, so they could only take it step by step and uncover its mysteries gradually.

After a few words with Hua Qing Si, Yang Kai set off with Zhu Lie.

Moving quickly in the Flowing Clouds Shuttle, one man and one Dragon sat inside and shuttled through the air.

Zhu Lie was puzzled by Yang Kai’s actions.

“If Zhu Qing is trapped in the Frozen Earth, why are we going to Fire Dragon Palace?”

While controlling the Flowing Clouds Shuttle, Yang Kai glanced at him, “Have you been to the Frozen Earth before?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Zhu Lie shook his head, “I’ve rarely left Dragon Island ever since I was born; members of the Dragon Clan aren’t allowed outside very often. I’ve heard of the Frozen Earth before, but I’ve never been there before.”

“Me neither.” Yang Kai laughed and asked, “Then, do you know where we should go to find your Elder Sister?”

Zhu Lie shook his head again, “I don’t. I tried to contact her these past few days, but I never got a response. I’m afraid she may really be…”

Yang Kai interjected, “If they’re alive, see the person, if they’re dead, see the corpse. Reserve your conclusions for after you see her.”

“That’s how the saying goes, but…”

“There are no buts!” Yang Kai swept him a stern look, “Neither you nor I have been to the Frozen Earth, not to mention the fact that we don’t even know where to begin searching for her, but there is someone who should be able to help.”

Zhu Lie thought for a moment, “And that person is in Fire Dragon Palace?”

“I guess you still have some brains!” Yang Kai grinned, “A chef should sharpen his knife before he begins to make a meal. Even though it will delay us for a bit to seek him out, it will at least be better than diving into the Frozen Earth and searching blindly.” After a pause, Yang Kai said, “But that person’s status is not ordinary. So I may need your help when the time comes.”

Zhu Lie snickered, “Can’t you beat him?”

Yang Kai shook his head slowly, “It’s not a matter about who is stronger or weaker, but a matter of cooperation. I want that man to accompany me to the Frozen Earth, but he definitely won’t be willing. If I use force, then I’m afraid it will create conflict and he would try to resist or revolt, which would not help in finding your Elder Sister at all. But if you can make an appearance, then things will be much easier to settle.”

“Oh?” Zhu Lie was now curious. He had no idea what sort of person would be as Yang Kai described, but he didn’t ask too much. He would find out when they met regardless.

Fire Dragon Palace, which had been established for tens of thousands of years in this part of the Northern Territory, was one of the four top Sects alongside Ice Heart Valley, Seeking Passion Sect, and Full Sky Sect. The reason it could be a top Sect was that it always had a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master assuming command.

And Fire Dragon Palace’s Palace Master Li Jiao was even a Half-Monster Master with a trace of Dragon Clan bloodline in him. In its most prosperous years, Fire Dragon Palace used to dominate the other three Sects, so their influence was second to none.

But ever since High Heaven Palace emerged in the Northern Territory, Fire Dragon Palace’s days had not been easy.

No one knew how their Palace Master offended High Heaven Palace, but since last year, eighty percent of the Sect’s annual revenue had to be handed over to that abominable place, leaving them with only a meagre twenty percent.

Fire Dragon Palace was a large Sect with many industries under its command, but its disciples numbered more than ten thousand, and a trivial twenty percent would only equate to ten million High-Rank Source Crystals. How could that amount be enough for their consumption? In the Sect, from Li Jiao at the top to the common disciples at the bottom, they suddenly fell to the ground at once from enjoying all sorts of benefits. All of them had to tighten their belts to live on these days.

Because of this, many of Fire Dragon Palace’s Elders were very dissatisfied with High Heaven Palace and would try to fan the flames by Li Jiao’s ear from time to time, hoping for him to bring them over to High Heaven Palace in order to avenge their past shame.

But how could Li Jiao have such guts? The Elders and disciples under him had no idea what sort of heritage High Heaven Palace possessed, but he couldn’t be clearer. The last time he followed Ji Ying over to watch a good show, he ended up losing almost all of the Sect’s business. Now, even hearing mention of High Heaven Palace was enough to get his heart pounding, so how could he dare to knock on their door?

Fortunately, Fire Dragon Palace wasn’t the only Sect to suffer this misfortune. Full Sky Sect was also in a similar situation. The two top Sects could now be considered brothers in misfortune, and there was nothing they could do but huddle together for warmth.

On this day, inside Fire Dragon Palace’s main hall, many Elders were gathered. As usual, the hall was filled with noise as many Emperor Realm Masters, completely throwing away the calm temperament and mild demeanour Masters of their station should have, made the room as noisy and foul as a vegetable market.

This situation was not common in the past, but since last year it had been happening often. Many Elders were fighting for nothing more than a single word: Benefits!

Fire Dragon Palace’s annual revenue was about fifty million High-Rank Source Crystals, and if there were no special circumstances, such a large amount would have been more than enough to cover the Sect’s expenses. Even after meeting the needs of each Elder and department, there was still a surplus saved to expand the Sect’s reserves in case of future needs.

But since last year, fifty million had been reduced to ten million, and a problem was then exposed. Each Elder wanted to secure more benefits for the spirit peak or hall they controlled. Alchemy required Source Crystals, Artifact Refining required Source Crystals, and even cultivating required Source Crystals. Who was willing to eat a loss?

But there were only ten million Source Crystals in total now to go around, and they had to last for the whole year. With each hand that reached out and snatched a crystal, one crystal would be missing from the pot.

If the storehouse still had a surplus, then it would be fine. At most, they just had to open the treasury and take out the Source Crystals from there to ease the crisis, but the problem was, Fire Dragon Palace’s storehouse was practically empty. Almost all the reserves the Sect had been accumulating for so many centuries had already been given to High Heaven Palace to pay off their debts, and the situation would not be improving within the next fifty years.

In view of all this, the Elders gathered in the hall refused to back down half a step. Each of them argued until their faces were red and their veins bulged, all so they could argue for the greatest amount of benefits for their side.

Li Jiao sat at the head of the room, listening to the noise below with a grim expression, not saying a word or showing any intention to intervene.

He could only blame himself for following Ji Ying to High Heaven Palace back then. If he had simply stood by and watched, that would have been that, but he actually had to make that accursed bet with Yang Kai. Not only did he make a bet, he even gambled so much of the Sect’s resources.

[I must have been possessed!] Li Jiao sighed and slowly closed his eyes.

But all of a sudden, the noise below stopped. An elderly man with an all-white beard cupped his fists and declared, “Palace Master, Spirit Pills cannot be removed from the cultivation of our disciples. The operation of my Pill Room is a top priority for the entire Sect, so I would like to please ask the Sect Master to allocate three million High-Rank Source Crystals for the Pill Room’s Alchemy use each year.”

“Three million? Elder Xu, aren’t you trying to take the lion’s share!? The palace only has ten million source crystals available to spend each year, and you’re actually asking for three million? What do you expect us to do? Drink the northwestern winds?”

“He’s right! Three million is too much. I think half a million sounds better. One can cultivate even without pills, the speed will only be slower. We just have to make it through these next fifty years.”

“Fifty years? The younger generation will have been ruined in those fifty years! Without enough pills to support them, how can their potential possibly be tapped? Our Fire Dragon Palace’s younger generation will definitely reveal an enormous fault line. Once our Sect’s foundation is weakened, who will take responsibility?”

“Brother Xu, don’t make it sound so serious. It’s only fifty years. Who out of us here has not already cultivated for more than a thousand years? When you were young, did you always have plenty of pills to take? Weren’t you able to cultivate to the Emperor Realm all the same?”

“That is why this Old Master is only in the First-Order. If this Old Master had enough pills available to me when he was younger, then this Old Master definitely wouldn’t be merely at this level.”

After a short moment of silence, a new argument broke out.

Li Jiao finally could not take it any longer. He slammed his fist down in anger, crushing the arm of his chair into dust.

The bustling hall suddenly fell silent and all eyes were turned towards Li Jiao.

With their Palace Master angry, none of them dared to act recklessly anymore.

“Enough!” Li Jiao swept his eyes across the bottom and finally gritted his teeth, “Every single day I sit here, listening to you bicker, but you never come up to me with a solution! You are all Elders of my Fire Dragon Palace, Emperor Realm Masters! This constant bickering is highly improper! If the lower disciples were to see this, would we have any dignity left!?”

All of them felt embarrassed being admonished by the Palace Master and lowered their heads.

The Pill Room’s Elder Xu pondered for a moment before saying, “Palace Master, the matter of Source Crystals must be resolved as soon as possible. Otherwise…”

“You think I don’t know that?” Li Jiao glared at him impatiently, “This King was negligent that day and fell into the trap of that petty thief, involving everyone in my Fire Dragon Palace.”

Elder Xu said, “Palace Master does not have to blame himself too much. Sect Master Mi was also unable to see through the truth on that day. We can only blame that little brat from High Heaven Palace for being too cunning. As long as our Fire Dragon Palace’s Palace Master survives, then we will surely be able to rise up again.”

The group of Elders nodded their heads in approval.

Li Jiao said, “As things have come to this, this King has a proposal. I hope that all Elders can cooperate with it to their best ability. If it can be done, then our Fire Dragon Palace will definitely be able to make it past these difficult times.”

Elder Xu asked, “May I ask what wonderful plan Palace Master has come up with?”

Li Jiao glanced around and lightly coughed before announcing, “Everyone present is an Emperor and has been an Elder of my Fire Dragon Palace for more than just a year or two. Surely you must have some personal savings on hand. What this Kind means to say is… he hopes you can first take out your savings for the Sect’s public use, as a loan to the palace. After fifty years, you will be paid back with interest. This King will definitely not let any of you suffer a loss. I wonder what everyone thinks about this idea?”

No one responded, and wherever Li Jiao’s eyes swept past, the Elders would lower their heads.

Li Jiao coldly snorted, “Do none of you have any savings? It’s not possible that every honourable Elder of my Fire Dragon Palace is actually a poor beggar, is it?”
