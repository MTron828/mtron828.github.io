News of Yang Wei’s announcement circulated around the world.

Although there was no news from Yang Zhao, his situation was undoubtedly the worst in everyone’s eyes.

When Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu were killed in front of Yang Zhao, the forces that supported Yang Zhao shrank drastically. Many of them forfeited their participation right to the Inheritance War entirely. The forces had left only half an hour after the battle against Yang Kai, leaving Yang Zhao’s Mansion’s front door cold and desolate.

At the moment, Yang Zhao’s remaining forces were less than half the number they were yesterday. In comparison to the number of cultivators under any of the Yang Family Young Masters, Yang Zhao has fallen from the most to the last.

Moreover, Yang Zhao’s strength wasn’t comparable to Yang Kai’s even at Yang Kai’s current mastery level.

It was even rumoured that Yang Zhao had lost his former vigor since that day. It was as though he had lost his soul and like the walking dead, losing all motivation.

All the cultivators that were left in Yang Zhao’s mansion were languid, listless and without fighting spirit.

The Inheritance War, which had gone on until now had broken down into a one sided battle!

Just as Yang Wei had concluded on that day, any continuation to fight was pointless. There was no need for any of their brothers to further pursue the position of Yang Family’s Patriarch.

Most people in the Central Capital and War City had already concluded that Yang Kai would be the next patriarch of the Yang Family, leading the Central Capital Eight Great Families and holding the power to control the world.

Over the next few days, Yang Kai’s mansion was lively and bustling. The guests were coming and going in countless numbers, running like a river.

All of these guests were people trying to forge ties with Yang Kai at the last minute.

Although they did not help in any battles during The Inheritance War and some even belonged former enemies of Yang Kai, as the Inheritance War comes an end. These people naturally wanted to reap some benefits.

Whether or not Yang Kai reached any agreements or allied himself with the forces that had visited him, he had to, at the very least, be familiar with them.

So when Yang Kai became the head of Yang Family in the future, it would be easier for him to solve matters diplomatically.

All the guests had brought a lot of gifts in hopes of meeting with Yang Kai and exchanging a few words with him.

There were many people who were trying to be a matchmaker. Which one of these forces did not have a few thousand beautiful women? Yang Kai was a young man, and what kind of young man doesn’t like a beautiful woman, this was the unchanging truth.

In the unlikely event that Yang Kai had taken a fancy to one of the forces’ many women, she would be married into the behemoth known as the Yang Family in the future! Who would not be jealous of such a thing?

Yang Kai’s mansion was almost filled to the brim with guests from other forces. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Qiu Yi Meng was not prepared to host the sudden influx of guests, thus was overwhelmed. She hated speculative people who change their faces faster than turning pages on a book.

After Yang Kai was made aware of the influx of guests, he had placed Qiu Yi Meng in charge of the guests. Although she did not know why, she could only comply.

All forces arrived with gifts and Qiu Yi Meng had to personally welcome all of them into the mansion: conversed with them politely, took their gifts, and then sent the guests on their way.

The people who were trying to matchmake did not want to leave the mansion unceremoniously, so they blocked the door and refused to leave without speaking to Yang Kai.

In just a few short days, Yang Kai’s mansion had welcomed more than a hundred forces, gathering a lot of wealth and materials at an incredible speed.

Qiu Yi Meng was deeply shocked.

Even if she was the First Young Lady of the Qiu Family, she was still shocked by the quantity and quality of these gifts!

Five days later, the bustle surrounding Yang Kai’s Mansion gradually calmed down.

Everyone in the mansion suddenly felt a strong energy fluctuation wash over them coming from the depths of the mansion. This energy was mixed with someone’s energy fluctuations. Everyone couldn’t help but have a change of expression and look towards the source of the energy.

Within only a moment, many people had gathered together.

“What is going on!?” Huo Xing Chen yelled, he had just got a new artifact from Treasure Instrument Sect but had not have the time to refine it. He couldn’t help but be amazed.

“It seems that someone has broken through.” Qiu Yi Meng frowned, “and it’s more than one person.”

“I also felt that two people had broke through at the same time...” Dong Fatzi nodded gently, the shockwave of energy then blended and entangled, seeming to not belong to one person.

“But why do I feel...Young Lord Kai’s aura?” Huo Xing Chen didn’t understand. Yang Kai had just broken through to Immortal Ascension Boundary a few days ago. Even if his aptitude was outstanding and his ability amazing, it was impossible to breakthrough after only a few days, wasn’t it?

Does that mean there will be even more people that are going to promote?

“Let’s go check it out.” Qiu Yi Meng couldn’t help but be curious and led a group of people over to the source of the energy.

A short walk later, Qiu Yi Meng’s group arrived in front of Xia Ning Chang’s room and reached to knock on the door, but the door was already opened.

Yang Kai emerged from the room, followed by Su Yan, who held a cold temperament, as usual. Although they looked calm, anyone can see the undisclosed joy and excitement in their eyes.

“What? Why are there so many people outside my room.” Yang Kai frowned.

“Who was the one that broke through here?” Qiu Yi Meng looked around curiously inside the room, but did not see anything. She could not help but use her weak Divine Sense to sweep over Yang Kai, suddenly her face changed colour, “You actually...”

Among the people in this group, not only Qiu Yi Meng but also several others had broken through to the Immortal Ascension Boundary, they noticed the abnormality of Qiu Yi Meng’s tone. So they also swept over Yang Kai to check.

Yang Kai was already at the second stage of the Immortal Ascension Boundary!

That is to say, the wave of energy that was set off during the breakthrough was indeed caused by him.

Everyone’s eyes instantly went round with shock as they looked at Yang Kai incredulously.

“It’s only breaking through a minor realm, what’s with all the fuss?” Yang Kai said.

“What’s the fuss?” Huo Xing Chen screamed. “Young Lord Kai Do you know when you broke through last time?”

Who doesn’t know the answer to this question?

They were all standing guard while Yang Kai breakthrough last time, while holding back the eight Above Immortal Ascension Boundary Elders.

That happened only a week ago.

Only a week had passed since Yang Kai had broken through to the Immortal Ascension boundary, this cultivation speed could not be described as talented but simply monstrous.

“Did she break through with you?” Qiu Yi Meng asked as she turned and looked at Su Yan slyly.

Yang Kai nodded. During this round of dual cultivation, the growth was tremendous. Yang Kai broke through to Immortal Ascension Boundary Second Stage and Su Yan broke through to Immortal Ascension Boundary Fourth Stage, while their foundations were instantly stabilized.

Su Yan’s harvest was even bigger than Yang Kai’s. After all, he had only just broken through a Great Realm.

Huo Xing Chen suddenly said wretchedly, “In the days you’ve been staying in the room, weren’t you...”

Before he could finish his words, Su Yan stared at him with cold eyes.

Huo Xing Chen stammered. Although he held great interest towards noble and tempered woman, Huo Xing Chen could not help but feel an instinctive sense of fear whenever he faced Su Yan.

[This woman is not normal...] Huo Xing Chen thought that even Liu Liu Yao of Liu Family, was not her opponent.

He didn’t know why but Huo Xing Chen was convinced of his guess.

What’s more, he would consciously avoid harbouring thoughts about the women who admired Yang Kai, let alone Yang Kai’s woman.

“Since you have time to ask so many pointless questions, go back and cultivate.” Yang Kai reprimanded. Although his breakthrough was too abrupt this time, it was due to the immense accumulation of experience and growth that was allowed to explode out after he promoted a Major Realm.

Everyone was ashamed, and they quickly scattered. They all began to worry about their own cultivation and bottlenecks that they’re facing.

Qiu Yi Meng’s face started to blush a reddish hue. She still had heart to cultivate, but she did not have time with everything in such a mess.

“Little Lord, I have something to say.” Xiang Tian Xiao did not leave and looked at Yang Kai seriously.

Since the last battle, Xiang Tian Xiao has been looking for opportunities to speak with Yang Kai, but he had always been busy, finally an opportunity had arisen at this moment.

Looking at him, Yang Kai nodded lightly.

“I am going to look for Junior Sister Xia.” Su Yan said as she turned and left. Su Yan did not want to intervene in Yang Kai’s affairs.

Only Yang Kai, Qiu Yi Meng and Xiang Tian Xiao were left.

The atmosphere had turned tense. Qiu Yi Meng seemed to suddenly realize that Xiang Tian Xiao wanted to say something. she quickly said, “Young Master Xiang, I hope that you can carefully consider what you’re about to say.”

Xiang Tian Xiao looked at her indifferently and nodded slightly.

“Tell me, what’s the matter?” Yang Kai asked as he looked at him.

Xiang Tian Xiao took a soft breath and said in a concise manner, “I wish to leave and quit the Inheritance War.”

Qiu Yi Meng deeply sighed. Although Xiang Tian Xiao has been reminded, but he still said this sentence, Qiu Yi Meng could not help but feel a little sad.

“You’ve considered everything?” Yang Kai didn’t seem to be surprised, and seemed to already have known that this was coming.

“ En.”

“Since you’ve considered everything... then it’s okay. Go.” Yang Kai didn’t mince any words.

Qiu Yi Meng was shocked and stunned, “Yang Kai!”

Yang Kai glanced at her and faintly said, “I killed his older brother, if he is to stay in my mansion it will reflect badly on him. I am afraid that he will be criticized. It is in his best interest to leave here.”

Xiang Tian Xiao expression changed, he could not help but reveal a look of gratitude.

The battle between the two brothers was an open secret. Although Xiang Chu was his eldest brother, Xiang Chu was trying to get rid of him. But in the end, they were still brothers.

Xiang Chu died at the hand of Yang Kai. If Xiang Tian Xiao still stayed here it would be really inappropriate. Even if the people following Yang Kai understood his reasoning for staying, who would know if everyone would understand his reasons? There were so many people under the sun could they all understand and accept his reasoning.

Listening to Yang Kai, Qiu Yi Meng had an awkward look and did not know what to say.

Others now break their own heads wanting to squeeze into Yang Kai’s followers, but they didn’t have this opportunity at all, they simply can’t get in.

At the juncture of victory of The Inheritance War, Xiang Tian Xiao chose to leave here. At first glance, such a choice is quite irrational.

But Yang Kai knows that Xiang Tian Xiao has his own reasons. He is not the kind of person who lives for profit.

If he was such a person, he wouldn’t have relied on himself when he was most desperate. The number of people he brought was small, and his strength was not high. But in battles both big and small, they had put in their efforts.

“Thank you, for this last half year you’ve helped me.” Yang Kai said to Xiang Tian Xiao who gently nodded.

Xiang Tian Xiao who always had a meticulous look, gently smile and said, “Thank you for taking care of this one this past half year, Young Lord!”

The pills supplied from the Pill Room, and the artifacts supplied in by the Treasure Instrument Sect, these were shared with the Xiang Family’s cultivators. The level of the Xiang Family’s people had risen several levels.

The smile gradually disappears, and the cold face returns. Xiang Tian Xiao says in a low voice, “Young Lord, when we see each other again, we will be enemies, then I will not be your follower... farewell.”

“I will see you off!”
