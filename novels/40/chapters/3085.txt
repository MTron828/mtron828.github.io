A few days later, Lu Huai Shuang and Sheng Yao suddenly sensed something as they looked up at the peak of the mountain. The young man, who had been sitting cross-legged the whole time, finally got to his feet and stretched his back before yawning for a bit. As though he had just awakened from a long dream, he placed his hands behind his back and looked into the distance with his deep gaze.

Lu Huai Shuang and Sheng Yao traded glances before they dashed forward to the peak of the mountain. In the blink of an eye, they reached the top.

When they landed on the ground, they were startled for a moment because at this moment, the young man was giving off an ethereal feeling. Although he was standing there, it was as though he was some elusive smoke. If they hadn’t seen him with their eyes, they wouldn’t have known he was there even if they swept the area intensively with their Divine Senses.

[Did he sit cross-legged on the same spot for so long just to conceal his aura to the point where no one could notice it? What’s the point of doing this?]

Not daring to appear disrespectful, Lu Huai Shuang bowed slightly and uttered, “Lu Huai Shuang thanks Senior for his assistance the other day. It was all thanks to Senior that my Lu Family remains safe. I am forever grateful.”

The young man replied, “It was a minor matter. Just see it as the compensation for damaging your Starship.”

[So he really was the one who damaged our Starship!] Although she had somewhat guessed it before, Lu Huai Shuang was still astounded when this young man admitted it himself. In a respectful manner, she bowed and said, “I wouldn’t dare.”

She was a powerful Master in her own right, but when facing this young man who seemed only slightly older than she was, she lost all confidence as an Origin King Realm Master. Standing in front of him, she felt like a toddler who was just starting to learn how to walk. It was as though he could knock her down with just one finger.

She wanted to ask why he was so powerful, and how he ended up being unconscious. However, she decided to keep her mouth shut as she was worried that she might accidentally offend him.

Sheng Yao was more experienced and flexible than Lu Huai Shuang was, so he put on a fawning smile and asked, “Senior, how may I address you?”

Lu Huai Shuang’s gaze brightened up as she turned to look at the young man.

“Yang Kai. My name is Yang Kai,” the young man replied.

A glint of shock flashed across Sheng Yao’s eyes, as he had never heard this name before. He was certain that this young man wasn’t one of the Overlords of the Star Field. Astounded, he thought, [Does he come from ‘that’ place? If that’s the case, then everything makes sense now, including why he was struck by Heavenly Lightning some time ago. It’s because even the Heavenly Way cannot tolerate his presence here!]

Agitated, Sheng Yao felt that he was right to yield the other day. He might be rewarded handsomely in the future for his wise decision. Apparently, Lu Huai Shuang realized something as well, causing her gaze to brighten further.

“Where’s this place?” Yang Kai asked.

“We’re on… A Dead Star?” Sheng Yao replied cautiously. If anyone else asked him such a ridiculous question, he would have slapped him across the face. There were countless Dead Stars in this Star Field that had existed since ancient times, so it was impossible to name all of them. The young man’s question was indeed unreasonable.

“I mean where is ‘this’ place!” Yang Kai pointed at the vast Heavens and drew a circle. His movement was light, but it was as though he could embrace the entire Starry Sky.

Suppressing the excitement in her heart, Lu Huai Shuang replied, “This is Unending Star Field!”

“Unending Star Field?” The light in Yang Kai’s gaze went out as he heaved a sigh secretly. He was disappointed that he hadn’t returned to Heng Luo Star Field.

Although the Void Corridor in the Dragon Temple was connected to a Lower Star Field, Yang Kai knew that there were a vast number of such Star Fields. The chances he would return to Heng Luo Star Field through the Void Corridor were far less than one percent, and he didn’t know how to go there either. After entering the corridor, he could only chase after Wu Kuang’s aura. Unfortunately, he lost him halfway through.

Now, he wasn’t even sure if Wu Kuang was in this Star Field. Maybe Wu Kuang had found somewhere to hide, waiting for the right chance to rise again.

“Senior… Are you not from this Star Field?” Sheng Yao mustered enough courage and asked as his heart pounded against his chest, while Lu Huai Shuang stared fixedly at the young man.

“No,” There wasn’t a need for him to hide this fact. Moreover, they must have realized this as well, so they were just asking this question to confirm their speculations.

Upon hearing this, Sheng Yao and Lu Huai Shuang turned solemn. Sheng Yao was so agitated that his lips started trembling as he asked in a shaking voice, “Then, where is Senior Yang from?”

Yang Kai shot him a cold glare, upon which Sheng Yao immediately shut his mouth. He was overly excited and had forgotten about the young man’s power. He regretted asking that question now.

Lu Huai Shuang uttered, “There’s nothing of any worth on this Star. Why doesn’t Senior accompany me to my home to have a chat?”

Since he wasn’t from Unending Star Field, he must have many questions to ask, and if that was the case, there was a chance for Lu Huai Shuang to strike up a relationship with him. As long as she could satisfy him, the Lu Family would gain tremendous benefits.

Yang Kai nodded, “Good.”

With a faint smile on her face, Lu Huai Shuang made a ‘please’ gesture, upon which Yang Kai walked forward to go down the mountain.

Just when he reached Lu Huai Shuang, his left foot suddenly tripped over his own right foot as he staggered and dazedly fell forward. He instinctively tried to stabilize himself by reaching out his hands, but he happened to grab some plump flesh. At that instant, he could feel the amazing elasticity in his hands.

The air seemed to have frozen in an instant. Time seemed to have stopped flowing, and all of them were rooted to the spot. Lu Huai Shuang’s face turned visibly red as though it was burning with fire. The squeezing sensation on her peak made her feel uncomfortable, and she almost couldn’t contain her urge to draw her sword.

Given her power and reflexes, she could have avoided it when Yang Kai was falling toward her. However, she was wary of this young man, so she didn’t dare to react in an agitated manner. Therefore, she decided to remain standing there, and this was the result.

It was the first time her sensitive parts were grabbed by a man, and it was even one she had just met and didn’t know anything about. At that moment, her eyes turned bloodshot. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Sheng Yao widened his eyes as he stared at Yang Kai with a weird expression. [Even if he couldn’t wait, he shouldn’t have done it here. How did he even trip over his own foot? What’s wrong with him? Is he really the same Master with unfathomable cultivation who killed two Origin King Realm Masters with ease?]

Yang Kai was equally shocked as he retracted his hands slowly and straightened up. Then, he spread his palms and took a look with a frown.

When Sheng Yao and Lu Huai Shuang saw that, they misunderstood that Yang Kai might be reminiscing about something.

“It wasn’t intentional,” Yang Kai gazed at her with a sincere expression, but his explanation sounded unconvincing.

Lu Huai Shuang pressed her lips together and lowered her head, “It’s fine.”

Certainly, she wasn’t fine with it, as her reputation was involved. However, there was nothing she could do because she was less powerful than he was. It wasn’t like she would ask him to take responsibility. Even if he was willing to do so, she would still reject him.

After a sigh, Yang Kai spoke up, “Let’s go.”

It was useless for him to explain anything. Only he knew what truly happened. Then, he turned around and walked down the mountain.

Sheng Yao was astounded and thought that this man’s temperament was strange. Given the young man’s incredible power, he could have flown over, so why did he choose to walk? Since he couldn’t figure out what was on the young man’s mind, he could only follow him.

Lu Huai Shuang remained on the same spot for a while to calm herself down before she clenched her teeth and followed him.

“Head Manager, you don’t have to keep following me. You can return to wherever you came from.” Yang Kai suddenly said without turning his head.

More than half a month had passed, so he was no longer interested in killing Sheng Yao. Moreover, he had never had such intentions in the first place as he quite disdained making a move against a mere Second-Order Origin King.

Whether or not the Fierce Gale Pirates were a bunch of evildoers, they were natives of Unending Star Field, so it had nothing to do with Yang Kai.

Upon hearing that, Sheng Yao felt humiliated as his face started flushing, “Senior, I’m a man of my own words. Since I’ve sworn to serve you, I will not simply back down now.”

Yang Kai suddenly stopped in his tracks and turned his head to look at him, a faint smile forming on his face as he asked, “A ‘man’ you say?”

Sheng Yao’s face twitched, but he wasn’t sure what to reply to him.

“Suit yourself,” Yang Kai kept walking forward, upon which Sheng Yao hurriedly followed him.

Lu Huai Shuang couldn’t help but knit her brows together as she despised this Head Manager of Fierce Gale Pirates. [How could he still be fine after being humiliated like that?] At the same time, she was amazed at how thick-skinned he was. If she were in his place, she couldn’t have done this.

Although the speed at which Yang Kai was walking was leisurely, and there wasn’t any trace of him using any Movement Skill, as though he was simply strolling, both Sheng Yao and Lu Huai Shuang had to push their Saint Qi to keep up with him, and in just one hour, they managed to return to the Starships.

The two Starships were parked on this sandy plain, looking like two twin giants. Lu Bing was just standing outside the Starship when he spotted Lu Huai Shuang, so he quickly approached her. As someone with sharp vision, he immediately understood what was going on upon seeing Sheng Yao and Lu Huai Shuang walking behind the young man. Bowing slightly, he greeted, “Greetings, Senior, this one’s name is Lu Bing from the Lu Family.”

After a nod, Yang Kai moved past him and stepped onto the Starship. Lu Huai Shuang walked past Lu Bing and spoke to him via Divine Sense, “We’ll talk about it later.”

After that, she followed Yang Kai into the Starship. She was the head of the Lu Family, so she had to arrange everything for Yang Kai first before she could worry about other things.

Sheng Yao wanted to board as well, but Lu Bing and the others stopped him as they stared at him with hostile gazes.

Sheng Yao shouted, “I’m Senior’s escort, so I have to follow him. Make way!”

Then, he circulated his Saint Qi and pushed the crowd apart. He managed to push them away with ease due to his powerful cultivation, and instead of feeling ashamed, he appeared proud when he announced his status as a servant, which shocked Lu Bing and the others.

[The Head Manager of Fierce Gale Pirates, a Master in the Second-Order Origin King Realm, is willing to serve as someone’s escort? What’s wrong with this world?]

The Starship’s interior was spacious. Lu Huai Shuang led the way and walked along the corridors, bringing Yang Kai to a certain room before pushing open the door and beckoning, “Sir, please.”

Upon entering the room, Yang Kai caught a whiff of a pleasant scent. That wasn’t the smell of perfume, but the natural bodily fragrance of a woman.

The room was luxuriously designed, as there were some Luminous Pearls that were as large as fists dotting the walls. The pearls cast a gentle glow in the room. A thick and soft red carpet was placed on the floor and to his left was a big bed with pink curtains around it.

On his right was a large bathtub with flowers floating on the water. Although Yang Kai hadn’t sunk himself into it, he knew that the water must be at the perfect temperature.

There was also a dressing table to the side, and although there were no cosmetic products on it, its purpose was apparent.

Obviously, this was a woman’s room!
