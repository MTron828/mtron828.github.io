Yang Kai retracted his gaze and let out a soft breath.

He had seen the result of this Two Races Great War, and as expected, the Ancient Barbarian Race won after paying a huge price, and the invaders were exterminated. As for the two escaped Demon Saints, even if they were exceptionally powerful, there was no place for them to hide in this world.

Taken as a whole, this training experience was very successful. Yang Kai had gained a lot, especially his understanding of Shamanic Spells from Ancient Times, which was incomparable to anything recorded in the ancient books.

The only flaw was that Shaman Niu died, but in that situation, Yang Kai, as Shaman Niu, could not think of a better way to resolve the Great Demon God’s last attack.

Now, there was only one last question left…

Yang Kai turned to the petite woman beside him and asked seriously, “Who are you? What should I call you, or should I just call you like before… Tiea!”

Tiea smiled, as if she was aware of the dissatisfaction in Yang Kai’s heart, and responded gently, “I am a witness and recorder of history. What you have experienced is only a drop of water in the ocean that I have recorded.”

“Did you create this dreamworld?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

Tiea shook her head, “I’m only responsible for witnessing and recording. What kind of dreamworld one encounters here entirely depends on his own choice.”

Yang Kai frowned, “I don’t remember choosing anything.”

After he entered here, he woke up as Ah Niu in Blue South Village. Since when did he ever have a choice?

Tiea smiled lightly, “Something in you made the best choice for you.”

Yang Kai thought for a while, before positing, “The Ancient Demon Qi?”

Only the Ancient Demon Qi had something to do with the dream world of the Two Races Great War.

As soon as he spoke, he was suddenly shocked as he recalled breaking the gold and silver seal in his Dantian. He had used his Demon Transformation, but now did not feel much discomfort. He wanted to check his state, but he did not even have a body now, only a form similar to a Soul Avatar that allowed him to communicate with Tiea, so he could not check his situation at all.

Tiea seemed to be aware of his thoughts and reassured him, “Don’t worry. What you’re experiencing now is just a moment in time. You can deal with your difficulties after you go out.”

Yang Kai nodded and pondered for a moment before he continued, “You said that you are a witness and recorder of history. I assume that you are the dreamworld itself?”

Tiea’s eyes flashed as she looked at him appreciatively, “You’re quite sharp. Yes, I am the manifestation of the dream world itself.”

Yang Kai pressed on, “Everyone who comes here will experience a different dream world, right? What I have experienced is the invasion of the Demon Race, the Two Races Great War. If other people come, they may experience something else, yes.”

“Correct,” Tiea smiled gently, thinking it was easy to talk with smart people. “This time you experienced the Two Races Great War. Perhaps the next time you enter, you will experience something completely different. Everything has a cause and effect.”

“Does this Sealed World have a name?” Yang Kai asked curiously.

“Thousand Illusion Dreamworld!” Tiea answered, her petite body suddenly transforming into a flash of light.

Yang Kai was slightly shocked but soon calmed down as he saw a massive butterfly gently floating in front of him.

The place where Tiea originally stood was now occupied by a colourful butterfly as big as a house. The bright patterns on Tiea’s butterfly body exuded a sense of extreme beauty as she gently flapped her wings, creating a fluttering of fluorescence, looking exceptionally mesmerizing.

Tiea’s voice echoed from the butterfly, “I am the Thousand Illusions Butterfly, the ruler of this Sealed World!”

“So you are the key to open this Sealed World!” A sudden realization dawned on Yang Kai.

Princess Lan Xun told Yang Kai once before that many of the Sealed Worlds in the fifty layers of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda could only be opened with a specific key. For example, the Grand Illusion Realm she once mentioned could only be unlocked with the Golden Armour Heavenly Book. Since Star Soul Palace’s Tan Jun Hao was killed by Yang Kai in Flowing Shadow City and the Golden Armour Heavenly Book fell into the latter’s hands, a number of disciples of Star Soul Palace who were training in the Grand Illusion Realm had become trapped and were unable to leave.

In order to reclaim the Golden Armour Heavenly Book, Star Soul Palace had to agree to Yang Kai’s request to enter the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda for a one-month training.

The key to the Grand Illusion Realm was the Golden Armour Heavenly Book, and the key to the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld that Yang Kai experienced was Tiea, which was also the Thousand Illusions Butterfly that she had transformed into!

Tiea giggled, “Key? I’m not just the key. As I told you just now, I’m the dream world itself.”

Yang Kai did not know the difference, but instinctively felt that the so-called Thousand Illusion Butterfly seemed to be higher grade than the Grand Illusion Realm mentioned by Lan Xun and nodded, “I’ve roughly understood, but since you are in control of this Sealed World, why did you appear next to me as Tiea? Were you watching me?”

Tiea replied, “I can easily know everything in the Sealed World without actively monitoring anything. As for why… You can think of it as a whim. I’ve been sleeping for a very long time and only awoke after you arrived.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his brow and continued excitedly, “So what’s special about me to you? Can I take you away with me?” After a pause, he rephrased, “Would you like to come with me?”

If he could take Tiea with him, he could control this Sealed World. Moreover, it was a Sealed World that was changeable and suitable for all Realms of cultivators to enter and train. As Palace Master of High Heaven Palace, Yang Kai had to consider many things for the future.

Every great Sect had its own heritage and foundation, such as the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda of Star Soul Palace, the Divine Ascension Mirror of Azure Sun Temple, the Outer Astral Wind of Orthodoxy Temple, and the Martial Intent Temple of Heavenly Martial Holy Land. Each of these played its own irreplaceable role and contributed unimaginable benefits to the development of its respective Sect.

The strength of a Sect was not just based on the few Masters who oversaw it, but also the future development and the growth of its disciples.

High Heaven Palace was not short of Masters now, with several Monster Kings as High-Rank Guest Elders under Yang Kai’s command, an Emperor Array Master, an Emperor Alchemist, an Emperor Artifact Refiner. There were also the Cross-Territory Space Arrays that connected the North and South Territories, so cultivation resources would not be a problem in the near future. Yang Kai was also still thinking about Tian Yan. If he could help Tian Yan obtain a physical body, allowing him to leave the Divine Ascension Mirror, there would be a Master as strong as a Great Emperor protecting High Heaven Palace. Even if it was not a real Great Emperor Sect, by that point it would not be much worse than one.

What High Heaven Palace lacked now was assets that could assist the growth of the disciples of future generations.

The Thousand Illusions Dreamworld was undoubtedly an excellent choice in this regard.

Therefore, Yang Kai wanted to take it away. The Thousand Illusions Dreamworld was one of the many Sealed Worlds on the fifty layer of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, while Tiea was the Sealed World itself and the key too. As long as he could take Tiea away with him, High Heaven Palace would have its own Sealed World in the future.

As for whether he would be found out or stopped by Star Soul Palace, Yang Kai did not think that he had to be worried about it.

There were so many Sealed Worlds in the fifty layer of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, some of which could not even be opened or found by the people of Star Soul Palace. Therefore, Star Soul Palace definitely would not notice even if he had ‘borrowed’ one from it.

In any case, would it matter if they really noticed? This was something Yang Kai gained from his experience here, so Star Soul Palace could not bully and force him to leave it here. That would soil the reputation of Star Soul Palace.

With this in mind, Yang Kai asked this question while at the same time he started thinking of ways he could persuade Tiea if she refused him, though he was not sure what he was supposed to offer to entice her.

“Sure!” Tiea answered softly.

“Wha… What?” Yang Kai was flabbergasted. He did not expect Tiea would agree so easily. The words of persuasion that he prepared in his mind immediately rotted in his stomach.

“I said sure,” Tiea repeated.

Yang Kai was stunned for a moment, because he could not react to Tiea’s sudden agreement.

On the contrary, Tiea noticed his concerns and continued with a smile, “I sense that history will be transformed around you, so I need to record that. Therefore, it’s inconvenient for me to stay in this place.”

Yang Kai grinned, “I don’t know what the future looks like, but I think my future should be very interesting. You may be able to record a lot of things.”

“I hope so.”

Yang Kai reached out his hand to Tiea, who gently flapped her colourful wings as her beautiful body suddenly turned into a stream of light and landed on his palm.

Yang Kai held her gently and as he looked down, saw a small and dainty butterfly hairpin in his hand, one that looked exactly like the Thousand Illusions Butterfly that Tiea transformed into, only many times smaller.

Tiea disappeared, turning into a key in the shape of a butterfly in Yang Kai’s hand. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Everything around him suddenly distorted and became blindingly bright. Then, Yang Kai felt an irresistible force pulling him in an unknown direction, as if trying to draw him out.

He could not resist this force, so he could only be vigilant about it.

With a rumbling sound, Yang Kai felt that his Soul seemed to be travelling across an endless space-time tunnel and suddenly came to a familiar residence.

He opened his eyes, and the first thing he did was to check if his Soul had returned to his flesh.

But his physical condition was truly looking quite bad.

He was currently wrapped in a rich Demon Qi that gave off an extremely malevolent aura. This wicked aura impacted his Soul and psyche and threatened to demonize him at any moment.

Although he used his Demon Transformation in the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld, his body in real life responded in the same way too. In other words, although the training in that Thousand Illusions Dreamworld was only an elaborate illusion of sorts, there was still an inextricable link between what happened there and his real body. For example, in this situation, Yang Kai’s actual physique had used his Demon Transformation when he did so in the dream world.

There was no time to worry about the details though as Yang Kai hurriedly pushed the power of the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus in his Knowledge Sea to shield his Soul and consciousness before he immersed himself in the Small Sealed World, drawing out the sealing power of the Firmament Tree in the medicine garden and pouring it into his body.

The two gold and silver lights rapidly gushed out and flowed through the meridians of his whole body.

Under the miraculous gold and silver sealing power, the Demon Qi surging in every part of his body seemed to have encountered its nemesis and rushed back into his Dantian, as if it were a panicked rabbit avoiding the pursuit of a falcon.
