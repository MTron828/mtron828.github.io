Chapter 32 - True Yang Tactics

Who put the poison in Kai Yang’s hut? Why did they poison this hut, was it meant for them?

Just as he was thinking about these matters in a confused state, his ears picked up a sudden and surprised voice. “Huh?”

It’s Kai Yang’s voice! Su Mu hated Kai Yang down to his bones, naturally he would be able recognise his voice.

It’s him. It turned out that it was Kai Yang who had poisoned them! Bastard! We had only intended to come and teach you a lesson, yet you were this murderous! Isn’t this too cruel, isn’t it?

In his heart Su Mu cursed Kai Yang, however he had rapidly begun to lose consciousness.

Fuck. Could it be that this master will die this muddle headed? This poor young master who was full of ambitions, and before these ambitions could be fulfilled, he will die an early death. The heaven’s were jealous, the heaven’s were jealous ah!

Stepping lightly, Kai Yang walked over to the the group of fallen disciples. Crouching down, he took off their face masks, only to discover that they were all people he was familiar with.

Thinking for a bit, Kai Yang realised what they had wanted to do. It was probably because he had tortured them too miserably these past few days, so they had come for revenge during the night.

But they really had some bad luck.

Playing with the incense burner in his hands, Kai Yang didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

This really was an accident, but they were really too unlucky. Usually he would have long since recalled the incense burner back into the black book, but today’s training was too exhausting. So by accident, he had fallen asleep. And before the remainder of the herbs had been burned, Su Mu and his group had unfortunately come and ended up inhaling the incense.

The incense that came from within the burner was very powerful, and when Kai Yang had first been subjected to the effects, he could only manage to take three steps before collapsing onto the ground. And this was with the golden skeleton within his body, so how could Su Mu’s group hope to withstand it?

They didn’t have the support of the golden skeleton for recovery, so he estimated they would need to cultivate for a couple of days before they would regain their strength.

Although, through his negligence, he must bear some responsibility for the current situation, it was also because of their arrogance. If the moment they had smelled the incense and stopped breathing, then they wouldn’t be in this pitiful state.

“Hey, why did you come?” Sighing loudly, Kai Yang stored the incense burner back into the black book, while looking at the pile of bodies strewn about his floor awkwardly.

Pondering for a moment, Kai Yang decided to drag all of them to a random area and leave them there.

When he returned to his wooden hut, he went back to sleep.

Because of that incident, Kai Yang became more vigilant. He must quickly breakthrough into the next tempered body stage. Currently he could only use the incense burner outside of the black book, but if he quickly broke through and neared the Kai Yuan stage, then it would no longer be so inconvenient to use. At that time, even if the incense burner was still inside the black book, he would be able to use it. The only requirement would be that he still had energy to channel into the black book.

The next few days, Kai Yang trained bitterly, despite using the two herbs sparingly, they decreased steadily everyday.

On the third morning, after he had completed his daily tempered body record training, he faced the east to breathe in the rich qi. While doing so the atmospheric energy in his meridians suddenly stirred and rose rapidly. It was like they were little insects scuttling about his meridians.

His face straightening, Kai Yang quickly paused to check his body.

The scuttering of his atmospheric energy also caused his muscles and blood to tingle, numbing his entire body. He didn’t know how long this numbing feeling persisted for, but suddenly Kai Yang felt his body lighten, while his abdomen began to heat up. The mad scuttering of his atmospheric energy immediately dissipated.

The warm feeling in his abdomen seemed to come to life, meanwhile Kai Yang was in ecstasy.

Vitality! He had finally stepped up, he was at tempered body seventh stage now and had started to develop his vitality. Vitality was a clear sign of this.

In your life, the first bit of vitality that you develop comes from within your dantian, but this vitality was very nominal amount. It was unable to support the usage of even one martial skill in a battle. This was because as soon as you used this strand of vitality, it would disappear. In order to regain it, you must expend a large amount of energy.

But because of this little strand of vitality, a practitioner could now be able to start their cultivation of martial skills.

The Sky Tower basic fists and kicks were not comparable to the might of a martial skill. A martial skill called upon one’s vitality in order to be executed, and they were the foundation of strength for all martial practitioners.

For a simple punch, the power that came from the tempered body seventh stage was far superior than the sixth stage. If the tempered body sixth stage punch could produce a power of 200 jin, then with the aid of vitality, the punch from the tempered body seventh could produce 500 jin or even 1000 jin of power.

Of course, when you were in the tempered body stage, a practitioner wouldn’t easily use martial skills because it wasn’t easy to recover your vitality. Only when you reached the Kai Yuan Stage, could you freely use martial skills as you pleased in battles. When you reached that stage, vitality was quickly recovered.

The main issue was how fast one could recover their vitality.

So once you entered the tempered body seventh stage, a practitioner must use that small stand of vitality to create their foundations and slowly increase their vitality.

A common method was to cultivate martial skills!

Every martial skill required several strands, or even dozens of strands or even the strands from various meridians to execute. With different paths and orders, one can form many different martials skills.

While you were cultivating martial skills to increase your vitality, you would open your body’s zhou tian and naturally progress to the Kai Yuan stage. Every practitioner would do this.

Kai Yang was no exception.

Once he knew he had reached the tempered body seventh stage, Kai Yang immediately calmed his beating heart and rushed back into the wooden hut to call out the black book.

He flipped directly to the fourth page and earnestly scanned the page.

During these past days, as soon as he had broken through, he would try to unlock the fourth page. Unfortunately he had never succeeded. Kai Yang guessed that he needed the tempered body seventh stage to unlock it, as soon as he reached the tempered body seventh stage the fourth page began to morph.

His guess was indeed correct!

After floating around for a short while, the wisps of golden light covered the page. Separating from the page, these gold beams of light directly entered Kai Yang’s mind.

Within his mind, new information appeared suddenly, True Yang Tactics! This was the reward that the black book had bestowed upon Kai Yang for breaking through. Going over the information, his expression became distorted.

This True Yang Tactics was slightly different from common martial skills. Normal martials skills had set paths of sequences, and although they could change, they were only superficial changes; they didn’t change the base of the skill. They didn’t stray from their base, if they did, then it would a completely different skill altogether.

But this True Yang Tactics didn’t. It didn’t have set activation sequences and changed constantly. It could be described as arbitrary or you could say that it actually didn’t have any singular form.

This was the first difference.

The cultivation method for the True Yang Tactics was also quite simple, but there were conditions to cultivate it. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

You must cultivate in an environment with plenty of yang energy to cultivate the True Yang Tactics.

But through this secret method, once the cultivated yang vitality reached a certain point, it could be condendensed into a liquid form and stored within the dantian.

This was something no martial skill or secret art could achieve. Because there will always be a moment when one’s body would be filled. Once a martial practitioner was filled with vitality, there was no way to increase the amount, unless you broke your limit.
