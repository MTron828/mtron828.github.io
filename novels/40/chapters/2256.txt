“Silence!” The round-faced woman who kept standing behind Luo Yan suddenly frowned and yelled at Yang Kai, “Don’t speak ill of Senior Brother Luo.”

“Brother Yang...” Luo Yang bellowed at Yang Kai, “Let’s fight!”

Yang Kai facepalmed, feeling speechless about this man.

At this moment, the surrounding atmosphere changed again.

With the sound of whistling in the air, the figures of many Masters appeared from all directions and all of them cast their eyes on Yang Kai’s Myriad Sword as soon as they arrived. After their attentive observation, their eyes glowed in greed.

They were certainly alerted by the Emperor Pressure of this Emperor Artifact, so they all came from their places to examine it and after seeing the Myriads Sword, they naturally coveted it.

The people who came here were basically Third-Order Dao Source Realm Masters while there were no Emperors present. Even if a cultivator of their level had seen an Emperor Artifact occasionally, it was still just a glimpse and none ever had a chance to possess one.

But now, to their surprise, an Emperor Artifact appeared in a small Maplewood City, and it was a sword-type artifact that specialized in killing!

They scanned with their Divine Senses and could not help feeling delighted when they found Yang Kai was just a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator.

Luo Yang frowned involuntarily, displeased at the sight of newcomers. Pushing his Source Qi, he created a visible ripple in the air with him as its centre that served as a warning blast to the surroundings.

“All of you, scram!” He let out a burst of anger at these people who were interfering with his battle with Yang Kai.

*Deng deng deng...*

Those people who came, regardless of cultivation or age, were deterred by this display of power and presence and quickly retreated a certain distance away in fear.

Not to mention that everyone recognized Luo Yuan due to his recent rise in fame, even if they did not, and after seeing the power he just released, they knew that he was not an ordinary Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, so why would they play with fire?

However, two among them remained where they stood, unintimidated by Luo Yuan.

The two were both elderly men, one of them looked as if he was meditating with his eyes closed, completely ignoring the presence of Luo Yuan, turning a deaf ear to him, while the other just sneered as a light flashed across his eyes, as if mocking Luo Yuan for his overconfidence.

These two were Flying Saint Palace’s Left and Right Protectors, Gao Shan and Liu Shui.

The two Protectors had been staying in the City Lord’s Mansion earlier, guarding Young Palace Master Ning Yuan Shu, but as soon as they sensed the Emperor Pressure released by an Emperor Artifact, they asked Ning Yuan Shu for permission and hurried over. They just happened to arrive just as Luo Yuan was unleashing his anger.

“Young man, you should not become angered so easily...” Protector Liu Shui grinned at Luo Yang with a proud and aloof attitude fitting for a Senior, “You’ll be hurt if you act so recklessly.”

“Hmph!” Protector Gao Shan opened his eyes and snorted coldly, “Youngsters nowadays really don’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth. They don’t put the heroes of the world in their eyes just because they have a little capability. One day, that arrogance will get you in trouble.”

“Two Seniors are wise!” Yang Kai looked at them with a humble face and nodded repeatedly, cupping his fist as he greeted them, “This Junior couldn’t agree more with the words two Seniors spoke. I believe these two Seniors must not be ordinary men to be able to speak like this.”

“It’s nothing, it’s nothing,” Liu Shui smiled at Yang Kai, finding this little brat quite pleasing to his eyes.

“Those who are willing to be taught will be successful!” Gao Shan did not hesitate to praise too.

“May this Junior ask for these two Seniors’ honoured names?” Yang Kai asked with a respectful look.

“Old Master Gao Shan!”

“Old Master Liu Shui!”

The two of them answered one after another, then spoke in unison, “We are the Left and Right Protectors of Flying Saint Palace!”

Their introduction seemed to have gone through many drills, and they spoke their lines proficiently, without any pauses.

“Flying Saint Palace...” Yang Kai’s face changed as he responded in amazement, “I can’t believe these two Seniors are the famous Protectors Gao Shan and Liu Shui who are famous throughout the whole Southern Territory!”

Looking at the face of Yang Kai, Gao Shan and Liu Shui were pleased with his flattery, with Gao Shan smiling faintly and asking, “So you have heard about our names?”

“Of course, two Seniors’ names resound like thunder across the land!” Yang Kai started spewing nonsense while looking completely earnest.

“HAHAHAHA!” Gao Shan and Liu Shui looked at each other and laughed out loud.

Everyone else who was listening couldn’t help glaring at Yang Kai with utter contempt for his flagrant bootlicking.

At the same time, they also secretly despised the two old fools, Gao Shan and Liu Shui. These two had lived for so many years yet only possessed Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivations and could be so easily won over with a little sweet talk from a mere brat. How could these two old fools possibly be the two Protectors of Flying Saint Palace?

It seemed that everyone was meeting Gao Shan and Liu Shui for the first time though, so they kept looking at each other with exasperated faces.

“But...” Yang Kai’s face suddenly turned solemn, about to say something but stopping just short.

“But what?” Gao Shan frowned, curiously looking at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai forced a smile and replied, “But it seems that some here do not respect two Seniors. Before two Seniors came here, this Junior happened to hear some unflattering remarks about you!”

“What? Who dares disrespect us Old Masters?” Gao Shan was infuriated and swept his cold eyes across the crowd.

When those cultivators met eyes with Gao Shan and Li Shui, they flinched and looked away. Although these two old men were indeed a bit foolish, there was no doubt about them being strong, otherwise, it would be impossible for them to seize the City Lord’s Mansion.

Therefore, the other Sects could only seek out other families to stay at as they were afraid of the strength of these two old men and dared not to compete with them for the City Lord’s Mansion.

“Was it you?” Gao Shan suddenly stared furiously at a shifty-eyed middle-aged man and yelled.

“No no no!” That middle-aged man quickly waved his hands and explained with cold sweat on his forehead, “This one arrived after you two, how could it have been me?”

“En,” Gao Shan did not suspect him, then he turned to another person, “Then what about you?”

“There is no such thing, this humble one has long admired two Seniors, why would I utter any words of disrespect?” The man singled out answered seriously.

“Who was it then!? Speak now so this Old Master can teach them some proper manners!” Liu Shui was mad too and asked Yang Kai with a glare. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Yang Kai stuttered slightly as he hesitated, “This Junior doesn’t dare to say... This Junior is weak and afraid of being killed after speaking!”

“Say it, don’t be afraid. Who has the courage to touch you when you have these two Old Masters here to protect you? Whoever dares to hurt you, these Old Masters will slaughter his entire family!” Gao Shan ensured Yang Kai’s safety and puffed up with pride.

“With the words of Senior, I can feel relieved,” Yang Kai acted thrilled and swiftly pointed with his finger and shouted, “It was him! It was this boy! Before two Seniors came, he boasted that Gao Shan and Liu Shui, who were supposed to be the strongest in Maplewood City right now, were just some ants in his eyes and he could easily crush them with just his finger. He also said Flying Saint Palace was nothing but a gathering of trash that shelters evildoers, and that all the cultivators in it were not born from their fathers and mothers, but from... “

“From what?” Gao Shan was completely incensed and his clothes began flapping despite there being no wind.

“It’s better for this Junior to not say it, it’s too humiliating!” Yang Kai said in a depressed tone.

“Why you!” Gao Shan was boiling mad and burst out in anger,

“Good, good, good!” Liu Shui also glared at the person pointed out by Yang Kai and sneered, “Young man, you seem to have a foul mouth. Why don’t you show me how you plan on crushing these two Old Masters with just one finger!”

Luo Yuan frowned and looked at Yang Kai, “You’re pointing at me?”

Yang Kai yelled, “Luo Yuan, be a man! Do you want to deny your own words? Masters Gao Shan and Liu Shui are present now! I dare you to say what you just said again! Let’s just see if these two Old Masters beat you to death!”

“En, I understand,” Luo Yuan lightly nodded, surprisingly, he made no attempt to explain himself.

Seeing him not deny the charge, Gao Shan and Liu Shui started to believe Yang Kai more and more.

Gao Shan reprimanded, “Boy, you’ve only earned a bit of fame yet you already think you’re invincible? You need to be taught that there is always someone better than you and have your attitude corrected, for your own sake.”

“Why bother speaking any nonsense with him? He must suffer death for insulting both of us!” Liu Shui snorted coldly as he looked scornfully at Luo Yan, “Little Brat, will you surrender yourself to be executed, or do you prefer we Old Masters come take your head? Let me say this first, if it’s the former, you will suffer less, but if it’s the latter, heh heh... you’ll beg for death before we’re done!”

Listening to Liu Shui’s words, Yang Kai was feeling on top of the world for successfully roping Luo Yuan into this mess.

As he expected, a person as arrogant as Luo Yuan would not sit there doing anything after being threatened. Forget about the fact that he hadn’t said anything insulting about these two old men, even if he did, he would still not have compromised at this moment. Raising his eyes, Luo Yuan revealed a wild and intractable face as he pushed his Source Qi and grinned, “Two old dogs want to take my life? Do you have the ability?”

“You’re only one step away from your grave, yet you’re still speaking boastfully. Take this, boy!” Gao Shan finally lost his temper completely and palmed towards Luo Yuan.

In an instant, the clouds up in the sky began to swirl as the flow of the surrounding Principles began to change and condense into a gigantic palm print that smashed down from above and enveloped Luo Yuan.

The faces of all the cultivators present turned pale.

Given that Gao Shan was a Protector of Flying Saint Palace and had a solid cultivation at the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, his strike was exceptional. Everyone was thinking of a way of defending or evading the attack that could possibly come in their way.

Their faces turned ugly as they kept thinking about it as they realized that they could only dodge this attack while counterattacking would only result in their defeat ...

However, Luo Yuan remained standing where he was without any thoughts of evading, as if he were paralyzed in place.

The round-faced woman who was standing behind him, too, stood frozen, her beautiful eyes fixed on Luo Yuan’s heroic back, not even the noises of the crowd entering her ears.

*Hong long long... *

The gigantic palm print which was formed from a combination of Source Qi and Principles slammed down, causing space around Luo Yuan to shake and wicked winds to be kicked up. Even the threads of Divine Senses which were monitoring the situation were being swallowed up in this massive current, making it impossible for others to see what was happening inside.

Several houses in the Qin Residence were also flattened by this explosion and turned into ruins.
