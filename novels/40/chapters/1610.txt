Chapter 1610, Send You On Your Way

Xue Lian’s face sank, “Boy, are you really not going to give this King face?”

“What thing are you?” Yang Kai smiled contemptuously.

“Good, you are one of the few who dare talk to this King like this other than that old ghost Tian Jiu, but you will die here today so, it matters not!” Xue Lian roared and released a blood-red mist from his body, enveloping him to the point where his figure disappeared and only a cloud of blood remained.

Immediately, this blood cloud flew forward at an extremely fast speed and enveloped Yang Kai.

Inside this blood mist, a terrifying and astonishing energy fluctuation broke out as blood-red rays shot towards Yang Kai like a living creature, trying to entangle him.

At the same time, a mysterious power surged around him.

Yang Kai suddenly felt that moving became difficult and the Saint Qi in his body was slightly suppressed.

Domain!

Yang Kai released his Shi madly, causing the surrounding space to twist and collapse.

However, his Shi was completely suppressed by Xue Lian’s Domain and could only extend a finger length outside his body.

“Your Shi is close to the grand accomplishment stage!” Xue Lian commented in surprise, “You have the capital to back up your arrogance, boy. A mere Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation, yet Shi condensed to such a level, however... you’re still not good enough!”

With a wide grin, Xue Lian released a large amount of Blood Qi filled with malice from his body, transformed it into flood dragons, and sent them hurtling towards Yang Kai from all directions.

This Evil Qi was filled with Mad Crocodile Monster King’s malevolent aura, and an average cultivator that was contaminated with it would immediately become deranged.

Although Yang Kai did not completely understand the mysteries behind this attack, how could he just stand there and allow it to get close?

Hundreds of Golden Blood Threads flew out from his body, like hundreds of tiny arms, waving and shuttling about his figure.

The pressure from Xue Lian’s Domain was instantly reduced!

Golden Blood Threads had the miraculous ability to cut apart Shi. Domain was an evolved form of Shi, so these Golden Blood Threads were able to restrain it somewhat. One or two may not have been enough to make a difference, but with hundreds working together, they could display some positive effects.

Yang Kai’s Shi spread a metre beyond his skin in an instant.

With a wave of his hand, the giant dark-green dragon transformed into a green glow and flew back to his hand, assuming its normal Dragon Bone Sword shape.

A loud dragon roar sounded from the sword as Yang Kai held it in one hand, poured his Saint Qi into it, and swung it forward.

A green sword wave tore through space and ripped the blood-red aura around him in half before soaring towards Xue Lian who was still hidden inside the blood mist.

Xue Lian could not ignore this attack and was forced to dodge, but before he could regain his stance, a burly figure suddenly emerged from the ground.

Stone Puppet!

The Stone Puppet at this moment suddenly transformed into a stone giant while the Heaven Shaking Pillar in its hand also grew to a terrifying size, nearly five metres long. The jet-black stick carried a Heaven destroying and Earth-shattering momentum with it that caught Xue Lian off guard as it smashed towards him.

Xue Lian was stunned and did not dare take a blow from the Heaven Shaking Pillar, so with a flicker of his figure, he dodged once more while simultaneously sending out a fierce punch.

There was a terrifying power contained in the fist that struck the Stone Puppet’s chest.

With a bang, Xiao Xiao was forced back several steps and several stone chips blew off from his chest.

The Stone Puppet was obviously taken aback.

Since its birth, it had never been hurt by anyone; today was the first time!

Even if it was only a few stone chips, it was still an injury.

Xiao Xiao’s round eyes suddenly filled with a ferocious light as it stretched out its free hand and pounded its chest loudly. Immediately after, the Stone Puppet’s body filled with a shocking, blazing hot energy.

A hot aura burst from Xiao Xiao’s body, one seemingly capable of burning all creation.

The body of the Stone Puppet also seemed to melt, and its entire figure turned fiery red!

Yang Kai was dumbfounded, not knowing what happened to Xiao Xiao. He had never seen such a change in the Stone Puppet before and fell back in a flurry to avoid a frontal confrontation with Xue Lian so he could pay close attention to Xiao Xiao’s condition.

He was not sure whether this sudden change was good or bad for the Stone Puppet.

Soon, the Stone Puppet’s body had become covered in a molten magma-like substance. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

At a glance, it appeared like Xiao Xiao was now wearing a lava armour! The heat radiating from this lava armour was so intense that even Yang Kai did not dare to approach easily.

“Sun’s True Fire!” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up.

He felt the aura of the Sun’s True Fire coming from this lava armour!

In a flash, Yang Kai suddenly understood.

Xiao Xiao had swallowed the Sun’s True Essence many years ago, but since then, he had never used this power; as a result, even Yang Kai did not know he was capable of this.

But today, Xue Lian’s punch undoubtedly infuriated the Stone Puppet and forced him to utilize his full strength!

Wearing his lava armour, Xiao Xiao suddenly transformed into a lava giant, and while carrying the unbelievably heavy Heaven Shaking Pillar in one hand, he clenched his other into a fist as a fiendish grin appeared on his always simple and honest looking face, a strange sight indeed.

*Deng deng deng...*

Xiao Xiao charged forward into the cloud of blood mist without fear, swinging his huge burning fist towards Xue Lian.

Xue Lian let out a strange roar as the thick blood mist rapidly became thin, as if it was being evaporated by the power of the Sun’s True Fire.

After a couple dozen punches, Xue Lian’s figure was exposed again.

His complexion was blue as he stared at the lava giant that was constantly approaching him with great dread, and his eyes filled with a look of shock.

Even with his vast knowledge, he had never even heard of a creature like the one in front of him now.

The first time it attacked him, it was only half the height of a regular person, looking quite small and delicate. The second time it attacked it had suddenly grown into a mighty giant. Now, it seemed to have transformed again into a giant made from molten lava.

Xue Lian retreated again and again, not daring to meet Xiao Xiao head-on.

The Firebird took advantage of this situation to launch a new barrage of fireballs

These fireballs not only contained scorching heat but also arcs of lightning.

The Firebird had also swallowed several Sun’s True Fire wisps, allowing it to achieve incredible growth. It had also swallowed several Heaven Scorching Thunder Fires, which let its flames take on a violent Thunder Attribute aura.

Its flames were even more terrifying than the Stone Puppet’s, and what it lacked compared to Xiao Xiao’s sheer power, it made up for in agility and flexibility.

Yang Kai’s two great helpers, one on the ground and the other in the sky, joined forces to completely suppress Xue Lian.

Yang Kai could not help grinning.

With the Firebird and Stone Puppet alone, Xue Lian could not act freely. Even if he had been a Monster King ten thousand years ago and could even still use a bit of his Domain, his current body greatly limited his strength in the end.

If he had been at his peak, Xue Lian would have been able to deal with Yang Kai with a wave of his hand.

Any Third-Order Origin King was not to be trifled with.

However, a great dragon trapped in a shallow pond could not create any big waves.

“Scram!” In a distressed state, Xue Lian roared and sent a fierce punch towards the Stone Puppet, the huge force behind it forcing Xiao Xiao back a hundred metres or so.

However, Xue Lian’s fist was also severely burnt as a result.

In the next instant, he charged forward, dodging the Firebird’s bombardment, and leapt straight towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was the key to this battle. So long as Yang Kai was killed, the Stone Puppet and Firebird that listened to his orders wouldn’t be able to cause Xue Lian any trouble. As such, he made up his mind to launch an attack with his full strength in hopes of executing Yang Kai in a single blow.

Domain surged forth, consuming Yang Kai as Xue Lian pounced forth.

Yang Kai pushed his Shi madly to resist this Domain, but it was clearly being overwhelmed and was soon suppressed back into his body.

Xue Lian closed in, a fiendish look upon his face as he roared madly.

This roar was piercing like a sword that sank into the heart of anyone who heard it, penetrating Yang Kai’s Soul and causing his movements to freeze up.

“Boy, you’re dead!” Xue Lian yelled frantically as he reached out to grab Yang Kai.

“Oh really?” A strange smile suddenly appeared on Yang Kai’s face as his body suddenly shook and a low growl erupted from his throat, “Dragon Transformation!”

A glorious golden light burst forth as golden scales suddenly emerged from Yang Kai’s right arm, covering his skin in a kind of impenetrable armour.

Golden light flashed from his hand as it transformed into a giant dragon claw.

The overwhelming aura of a Divine Dragon filled the air.

Xue Lian’s eyes instinctively flashed with fear and his seemingly unstoppable momentum rapidly deflated.

The pressure of an Ancient Divine Spirit had a suppressive effect on any Monster Race, let alone the ruler of those Divine Spirits!

Whether it was Xue Lian’s body or Mad Crocodile Monster King’s Soul, both were distant descendants of Variant Ancient Divine Spirits, incomparable to a Golden Divine Dragon.

Yang Kai struck with his right hand; his five fingers grouped together like a sharp sword he thrust out fiercely.

A splash sounded.

Xue Lian’s body, which seemed as solid as iron, was directly pierced by Yang Kai’s right hand like it was tofu.

A beating sound echoed from Xue Lian’s chest as Yang Kai’s right hand gripped his heart.

Xue Lian froze in place, his big hand which was grabbing towards Yang Kai’s head stopped motionless mid-air, his eyes trembling violently.

“Let me send you on your way!” Yang Kai grinned and squeezed his right hand, directly crushing Xue Lian’s heart.

“Boy, you’re still too naive!” Xue Lian laughed strangely before he died, the light in his eyes fading after his heart was crushed.

Yang Kai’s complexion darkened as he faintly realized that something was wrong. Just as he was about to pull out his arm though, he saw a blood-red light suddenly fly out from Xue Lian’s forehead and without pause, rush directly into his head.

This blood-red light radiated an extremely strange aura, one that broke through Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea defences as easily as crushing dry weeds or smashing rotten wood.

“So that’s what you were plotting!” Yang Kai immediately understood and immediately sent his consciousness into his Knowledge Sea.

Inside his Knowledge Sea, the flames of his Conflagrated Knowledge Sea tumbled.

A strange figure stood mid-air, looking at everything around him in shock and surprise.

He found that his situation was a little different from what he had imagined!

“If you planned on seizing my body, I’m afraid I’ll have to disappoint you,” Yang Kai looked at the strange figure and sneered.
