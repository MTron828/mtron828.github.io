Before this, this man had thought that there would be no Masters in this remote place. Therefore, he did not really care about showing a haughty attitude. After realizing that Yang Kai was a Shaman Grandmaster, however, he dared not act impudently.

“Greetings to Sir and Madame!”

Tiea supported Yang Kai to stand up and looked at this newcomer with a frown, only nodding after a short pause, “You don’t need to be so polite.”

After hearing this, the Shaman Master straightened up and asked curiously, “May I know… which village Sir and Madame are from?”

He did not know who Yang Kai and Tiea were, but since they were Shaman Grandmasters, they must be people of great status. This was especially important to him, who was sent as a messenger of his Clan to connect with their other smaller villages. He might not be familiar with all the Masters of the surrounding Clans, but he should at least know of them.

“Blue South Village!” Yang Kai answered.

“Huh?” The Shaman Master was stunned, staring at Yang Kai doubtfully, as if he could not believe his words, “Blue… Blue South Village?”

Since when did Blue South Village have two Shaman Grandmasters? From what he remembered, the Village Chief of Blue South Village was just a trivial Low-Rank Shaman Apprentice. Therefore, Yang Kai’s words were a little unbelievable to him, but there was also no reason for a Shaman Grandmaster to lie.

He then asked in a daze, “Is Sir from Blue South Village?”

“That’s right.” Yang Kai looked at him, “What’s the matter?”

“Then where is Shaman Li?”

Shaman Li was the name of the Village Chief, so when he asked, Yang Kai immediately understood that this man knew the Village Chief and he probably was here for the Village Chief too.

Yang Kai’s face slightly darkened as he replied, “The Village Chief is not here anymore. From now on, this Shaman is the Village Chief!”

“Shaman Li…” The man was slightly stunned, but he did not dwell too much on it. After all, Shaman Li was already old, and his cultivation was not high, so he was not destined to live long anyway. Perhaps his time had arrived and he had returned to the arms of the Barbarian Gods. Thinking so, the man changed the topic swiftly, “How may I address Sir?”

“Shaman Niu!”

The man nodded, and declared loudly with a solemn face, “Shaman Niu, I was ordered by Sir Shaman King to inform you to order all the villagers of Blue South Village to gather in King City within five days!”

“An order from the Shaman King?” Yang Kai was dumbfounded.

Although the South Barbarian Clan was a powerful force amongst the Ancient Barbarian Race, it still had a Shaman King presiding over it. As far as Yang Kai knew, this Shaman King was a High-Rank Shaman King, and with his protection, King City held the same position as the Frost and Snow City of Frost and Snow Clan. All the small villages and Village Chiefs of the South Barbarian Clan lived under the jurisdiction of King City, with the Shaman King having absolute authority over these small villages.

Yang Kai sensed something unusual about this sudden order and vaguely felt that big things were about to happen.

“Yes, it is a direct order from Sir Shaman King.” The man replied solemnly, “At first, I came here to inform Shaman Li, but since you are the Village Chief of Blue South Village now, telling you would be the same.”

Yang Kai slightly narrowed his eyes as he asked, “Is there a Clan at war with us?”

During the ancient times, it was common for the Ancient Barbarian Race to fight amongst themselves in order to compete for the land and for their own Clan’s interests.

Moreover, once this happened, all personnel and troops would be included, no one could avoid this draft.

So, as soon as he heard this order, Yang Kai subconsciously felt that some Clan wanted to wage war against the South Barbarian Clan, and the first Clan that came to his mind was the cruel and inhuman Bone Devouring Clan. In that case, Yang Kai did not mind getting involved.

Yang Kai regretted that he could not kill Shaman Chei today after all.

The messenger smiled wryly, then shook his head slowly as he responded in a low voice, “It wouldn’t be such a big deal if it’s only a Clan War.”

Yang Kai was stunned, “What could be more serious?”

After a moment of hesitation, the messenger answered, “This matter is supposed to be confidential and should not be leaked; however, since both Sir and Madame are Shaman Grandmasters and would definitely be summoned by Sir Shaman King when you reach King City, it will do no harm to inform you in advance.”

After saying so, he suddenly lowered his voice and declared solemnly, “The Demon Race has invaded!”

“Wha—what? Can you say that again?” Yang Kai thought he had heard wrongly.

“The Demon Race has launched an invasion!” The messenger repeated with an extremely solemn expression.

Yang Kai was stupefied for a long while, and only after a long silence did he ask with shock still visible on his face, “Seriously?”

The messenger replied, “Yes. Three major Clans have already been destroyed.”

Yang Kai’s face turned solemn in an instant. Although the Ancient Barbarian Race was sparsely populated, there should still be at least a few hundred thousand members of a major Clans. Three Clans being destroyed meant that a million people might have already died. This was truly Earth-shaking news.

The invasion of the Demon Race.

This sentence was not strange to Yang Kai, yet it was not familiar either. He learnt from the knowledge inherited by Senior Qing that this land had been invaded by the Demon Race more than once. The most recent incident was thirty thousand years ago. At that time, Senior Qing was just an Evergreen Tree that had gained consciousness and was working hard to absorb nutrients from the Earth to cultivate.

He witnessed the world-changing transformation of the land after the invasion of the Demon Race, where countless people died before his eyes. He also saw that many mighty people of this land sacrificed their lives to stop the progression of the invasion of the Demon Race, and countless later generations took up the positions of the fallen. They continued to fight with their precious lives for nearly a hundred years before eventually triumphing over the Demon Race.

Wails and cries filled the land during that hundred-year war, and it took another a thousand years after it ended for the vast mountains and rivers to gradually restore their vitality.

But now, the scene of thirty thousand years ago was happening again, and no one knew what was going to happen this time.

The Demon Race was just a general term and Yang Kai did not know what they looked like, only that they had a different form from humans or barbarians and were dreadfully violent. In comparison, the Bone Devouring Clan were like gentle lambs.

However, it was rumoured that the reason why the Bone Devouring Clan was different among the Barbarian Race was that they were descended from Demons. During the war thirty thousand years ago, some Demons defiled women, who gave birth to offspring. These were the ancestors of the Bone Devouring Clan.

Rumours were just rumours, however, so no one knew whether they were true or not. Especially in this era, when such rumours had all but been lost to the long annals of history. The truth remained unknown to even the descendants themselves, with only one, Monster Tree Senior Qing, who had stood for tens of thousands of years, knowing the truth.

Nevertheless, the rumor did not start from nothing. Perhaps, countless Ancient Barbarians had proposed to exterminate the Bone Devouring Clan because of this. It was just that until now, the descendants had no idea why they had to destroy the Bone Devouring Clan and simply thought it was because they were vicious cannibals.

The invasion of the Demon Race was definitely a catastrophe for the world!

No one knew where the Demon Race came from. Even Senior Qing, who was the most knowledgeable, had no clue about this. Thirty thousand years ago, the Demon Race seemed to just appear overnight. They were fearless and unscrupulous, doing whatever they pleased and killing as if it was their sole purpose in life.

The arduous war that lasted for a hundred years had severely damaged the foundation of this beautiful world, and nearly wiped out all sentient life.

And now, thirty thousand years later, another Demon Race invasion was happening. Yang Kai could foresee the incoming catastrophe, where bodies would pile up like mountains and rivers of blood would flow.

The grudges between him and Bone Devouring Clan were nothing compared to this.

“Sir…Sir…?” Seeing that Yang Kai was lost in thought, the messenger called him several times while smiling helplessly.

Yang Kai took a deep breath and replied, “Within five days, I will take the villagers of Blue South Village to King City!”

The messenger was overjoyed and saluted with a fist over his chest, “Many thanks, Sir. I have to inform the other surrounding villages, so I will leave first.”

Yang Kai nodded and did not try to keep him. After seeing him off, he turned to Tiea and asked, “How much do you know about the Demon Race?”

Tiea replied, “I don’t know anything, what do you know?”

Thinking about it, she was only a teenager, so even if she was raised by Senior Qing, she couldn’t know too much; after all, why would Senior Qing tell her about the Demon Race when it was basically irrelevant history? Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Rest in the village for today. Tomorrow you will be returning to Senior Qing,” after delivering this order, Yang Kai turned around and walked towards the village.

The Demon Race invasion would cause a huge wave that consumed the entire world. If there was still a peaceful land in the world, it would be the Frost and Snow City that was guarded by Senior Qing. It was perhaps the last safe haven.

“Are you trying to drive me away?” Tiea retorted with an angry stare, “Are you really driving me away?”

“Think what you like!” Yang Kai did not bother to pay attention to her, “By the way, gather Ah Hu and the others here. I have something to say to them.”

Tiea stomped her feet angrily and left with her teeth clenched.

After a while, the villagers returned to the village and were delighted to see that Ah Niu was safe, though his face was pale.

But not long after they were relieved, Yang Kai announced solemnly, “Everyone, listen. A messenger from King City has just informed me that the Demon Race has begun an invasion. Three Clans of our Barbarian Race have been destroyed already and Sir Shaman King has ordered all the villagers of our Blue South Village to gather in King City within five days to wait for orders.”

As soon as he made the announcement, the two hundred villagers fell silent.

“What is the Demon Race?” Ah Hu questioned.

Everyone wanted to know too, because they had never heard this term before.

Yang Kai answered, “I don’t really know much about the Demon Race. I only know that they are an enemy that are a hundred, or even a thousand times more violent than the Bone Devouring Clan. They are a living disaster, and the greatest enemy of our Barbarian Race, one that we cannot coexist with beneath the same sky!”

[A thousand times more violent than the Bone Devouring Clan?]

The villagers’ faces changed at his words. They knew how ferocious the Bone Devouring Clan was because they were caught by them before, so was it not crazy that someone was even a thousand times more violent than them?

“Although it was the order from King City, I won’t insist that you come! I will be departing for King City tomorrow, so whoever wants to join me, I will bring you with me tomorrow. For those who don’t, just stay in the village.” Yang Kai’s voice was not loud, but it resounded strongly in everyone’s ears, “I will not lie to you. This will be very dangerous, and chances are those who come will not come back! Think carefully before you decide.”

After his speech, Yang Kai didn’t wait for the villagers to respond before going straight to his house and stuffing a handful of healing pills into his mouth.

Although the battle with Shaman Chei was dangerous, his injuries weren’t too severe. It should not be a problem after recuperating overnight. Moreover, he benefited a lot from this high-intensity battle. If this kind of battle was repeated several times, it would be much more effective than him cultivating in retreat.

He readily accepted the order of King City because he intended to meet the so-called Demon Race in battle to enhance his own growth.
