Yang Kai had returned to Blue Sky Pass from the forward base for various matters over the years, but he had always returned alone while Dawn had always been guarding the front lines. He might be the Squad Leader, but Dawn was strong enough to carry out various missions without him.

Dawn had not returned with him this time either, so Yang Kai didn’t understand why Feng Ying and Bai Yi were here.

After pondering for a moment, Yang Kai walked to the left wing and gently touched the restriction. Soon, Feng Ying appeared in front of Yang Kai.

“Squad Leader, you’re back?” Feng Ying immediately commented.

Yang Kai nodded in response, “Why have you also returned?”

Feng Ying answered, “The Pass ordered us to return, so we have.”

“Ordered?” Yang Kai was a bit astounded. He originally thought that Feng Ying and Bai Yi had returned for some reason, but after knowing that it was an order from the Pass, there was nothing left to say.

Feng Ying, after hesitating for a moment, finally added, “Not just our Dawn Squad has been recalled, even Junior Brother Chai’s Squad was recalled, along with several other Squads.”

“Senior Brother Chai is also back?” The corner of Yang Kai’s brow twitched. The so-called Senior Brother Chai was none other than the Old Turtles Squad Leader Chai Fang.

Feng Ying pursed her lips as a smile bloomed on her face. “Junior Brother Chai came looking for you earlier.”

“Why is he looking for me?” Yang Kai cautiously asked.

Feng Ying replied, emphasizing each word, “‘Junior Brother Yang took great care of this Chai on the battlefield, so this Chai should naturally treat Junior Brother Yang well and express my gratitude.’ Well, these are Junior Brother Chai’s original words.”

This was obviously a threat! As the Old Turtles’ Warship was slow, it was easier for them to be robbed of Military Merits on the battlefield, and Dawn had done this the most. Chai Fang had naturally marked this loss down.

The Gadfly Squad’s moniker was not just for show.

But then again, it wasn’t that Dawn Squad enjoyed snatching others’ Military Merits; rather, when they saw other Squads entangled with the Black Ink Clan Squads on the battlefield, there was nothing wrong in eliminating the enemies. Who would even care about Military Merits in that kind of situation? After all, the priority was to kill Black Ink Clansmen.

But obviously, Chai Fang didn’t think so. When they were fighting on the front lines, it wasn’t the right time to quibble with Dawn over this, but now that they had been recalled, he naturally wanted to settle accounts.

Of course, he was not planning to fight it out with Yang Kai or Dawn. He also knew that Dawn was trying to help them many times. Nonetheless, as Special Operations Squads, there was always some competition between them. Since they could not beat Dawn in kills, he naturally had to find something else to regain his face.

Yang Kai immediately spat in disgust, “He can go to Hell!”

Feng Ying stated, pursing her lips, “You should tell Junior Brother Chai this yourself.”

“Forget it, let’s just ignore him. I’ll be going into retreat and cultivate. Senior Sister, you should also rest.”

Saying so, Yang Kai turned around and entered his room.

Be that as it may, Chai Fang was not going to let Yang Kai have his way. Who knew how he got the news, but the very day Yang Kai returned to his residence, Chai Fang rushed over.

Although the courtyard had privacy restrictions, they were unable to withstand Chai Fang’s all-out harassment. He also knew that Yang Kai and the others would not have entered life-or-death close-door cultivation at this moment, so he acted without scruples.

Alarms kept blaring as the restrictions activated. Whether it was Yang Kai, Feng Ying, or Bai Yi, none of them were able to peacefully cultivate.

Helpless, Yang Kai had no choice but to come out. He deactivated the restriction and looked at Chai Fang with a look of disgust, who was making a ruckus outside the courtyard, “Senior Brother Chai, why are you here instead of cultivating?”

Chai Fang maliciously grinned as he palmed his fist, “Didn’t Senior Sister Feng tell you? Why does Little Brother ask when you already know the answer?”

Yang Kai helplessly asked, rubbing his forehead, “Does Senior Brother want to fight?”

Chai Fang decisively replied, “No! Although we’re not from the same Sect, we’ve fought side by side on this battlefield for so many years, so how can we fight? This Chai doesn’t know how to control his strength. What if I injure you, Junior Brother?”

Of course, he was just being stubborn and unwilling to admit defeat!

The main reason Chai Fang was refusing was because he felt that he was definitely not Yang Kai’s opponent. Yang Kai could even kill a Territory Lord. Although there were circumstances, such as taking advantage of the situation, few Seventh-Order Masters in the entire Human Race had ever killed a Territory Lord.

Chai Fang had witnessed Yang Kai fight with his own eyes. A Feudal Lord was no different than a chicken before Yang Kai; his terrifying strength had long surpassed the Seventh Order. In terms of combat strength, Chai Fang admitted that he was far inferior to Yang Kai, so how could he fight him? He would simply be digging a pit for himself.

“Then, what does Senior Brother want?” Yang Kai asked.

Chai Fang meaningfully grinned as he swiped his Space Ring and took out a jug of wine, “This Chai did not lie when I said I wanted to express my gratitude. Look, I’ve brought everything.”

Yang Kai immediately understood. Since the Old Turtle Squad had lost to Dawn on the battlefield, he wanted to regain face in a drinking competition.

Looking at the wine jug in Chai Fang’s hand, Yang Kai immediately felt frustrated.

He had once engaged with Chai Fang in a drinking contest back at the forward base. In the end, Yang Kai lost and became completely inebriated. He was ridiculed by the other Squad Leaders as a result.

Men were very strange creatures. In the eyes of almost all men, one’s alcohol capacity was also a standard of their worth. If one’s alcohol capacity was as vast as the sea, they would naturally be able to drink to their heart’s content. If a man got drunk after just three glasses, he was simply not a man.

Yang Kai was now a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master with a robust foundation and strong physique. Not to mention a single jug of wine, even a hundred or a thousand jugs wouldn’t be enough to make him drunk. If his World Force was taken into account, he could easily detoxify any amount of wine.

But since it was a drinking competition, they naturally would not be using any of their strength. There would be no point in competing if they really used their World Force.

During the drinking competition, everyone would seal their strength and compete with their innate capacity.

In this aspect, Chai Fang seemed to have a higher capacity than Yang Kai.

“Senior Brother, I still need to cultivate. How about this, I’ll just accept this wine as…”

Before Yang Kai could finish speaking, Chai Fang pushed him into the courtyard, “Enough with the nonsense, since this Chai has come today, I don’t plan on leaving.”

Yang Kai staggered back, helplessly watching Chai Fang take out a set of chairs and a table. He then took his seat and gestured to Yang Kai to take the seat across from him. He was staring at Yang Kai very fiercely, assuming the posture that either you die or I perish.

Yang Kai reckoned that he was most likely doomed today!

“Sit! Why isn’t Junior Brother sitting? If you don’t sit, I’ll think that you’re looking down on this Chai!” Chai Fang glared angrily.

Yang Kai forced a laugh, “Senior Brother, there’s no need to go this far.”

Helpless, he sat down opposite Chai Fang.

The moment he sat down, Chai Fang instantly pushed the jug of wine to Yang Kai. Afterwards, he took out another jug, opened the lid, and poured it down his throat.

The corner of Yang Kai’s brow twitched staring at this. Chai Fang had completely emptied the jug in less than a dozen breaths. He then wiped his mouth and stated, “Good! Junior Brother, please help yourself. This Chai will first drink a few jugs to moisten my throat.”

Saying so, a small mountain of wine jugs appeared beside him with a wave of his hand, and he started drinking them like they were water.

[Damn it!] Yang Kai’s heart was gripped with apprehension. If this continued, he would definitely lose. The only choice he was left with was to call for reinforcements!

Taking advantage of the other party’s drinking, Yang Kai secretly sent a message.

A short while later, Yang Kai finally finished his jug, but Chai Fang had already finished four or five. They were on completely different levels.

Fortunately, a figure rushed in from outside at that moment. Seeing the oncoming figure, Yang Kai called out enthusiastically before anyone could understand what was happening, “Fei Ping, you’re here? Come, let me introduce you. This is the Old Turtle’s Squad Leader, Chai Fang!”

Chai Fang shot him an annoyed look, “Why are you introducing me? Do you think that I don’t know everyone in your Squad?”

After so many years of competing with each other, how could he not know who was who?

Yang Kai defended with a smile, “Fei Ping has admired Brother Chai for a long time and has praised Brother Chai many times to me, saying that Brother Chai’s Squad always took the lead and fought bravely when in battle. Fei Ping, now that Squad Leader Chai is here, why don’t you offer him a few toasts.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Hearing Yang Kai’s suggestion, Miao Fei Ping didn’t dare act disrespectfully and had no choice but to pick up a wine jug and respectfully offer, “Squad Leader Chai, this Junior offers you a toast.”

Chai Fang didn’t refuse and simply glanced at Yang Kai, “Treacherous bastard!”

*Gulp gulp gulp…* Miao Fei Ping quickly downed the entire jug of wine.

Just as he was finished drinking, someone else came in.

Yang Kai called out enthusiastically once again, “Senior Brother Qi, you are here? What a coincidence, Squad Leader Chai is here as a guest. He was worried about no one being able to accompany him, but Senior Brother Qi, your capacity is like the sea, come here and drink with Squad Leader Chai.”

Qi Tai Chu chuckled, “That’s exactly what I was thinking.”

A moment later, Yang Kai shouted again, “Senior Brother Shen is here…”

One by one, the members of Dawn kept arriving. After seven or eight of them arrived, Chai Fang couldn’t stand it any longer. He slapped his hand on the table and angrily shouted, “Bullying me with numbers, are you?! You Gadflies are too much! As expected, if the foundation is crooked, the house will be too! Yang Kai, you have reinforcements, but do you think that this Old Master doesn’t?”

Saying so, he took out a communication artifact and sent a message with his Divine Sense.

Not long after, several figures flew over from all over Blue Sky Pass. Yang Kai didn’t back down either and quickly summoned the remaining Dawn members.

A moment later, some 90 people were gathered in the small courtyard, bustling with noise and excitement. Because of all the noise, Feng Ying and Bai Yi were unable to remain in seclusion.

Yang Kai and Chai Fang, who were sitting across from each other at the table just as before, were now completely surrounded by members of their respective Squads.

Chai Fang fiercely glared at Yang Kai and shouted, “Brothers, Sisters, Squad Leader Yang has taken care of us quite a lot on the battlefield! He has saved us so many times, but we never got a chance to repay him! Let’s show him proper gratitude today!”

Yang Kai bitterly smiled, “Squad Leader Chai, you’re really too polite, it would be impolite not to repay your gift in return. Since Squad Leader Chai is such a good drinker, let’s let him drink to his heart’s content today!”

At first, whether it was Yang Kai or Chai Fang, both of them were conscious and could drink themselves, but soon their vision became blurry and stars began to shine before their eyes.

Nonetheless, the other members of the Squads were not willing to let them go and opened their mouths and poured wine into them.

*Gulp gulp…*

*Gulp gulp…*

Feng Ying and Bai Yi stood together, watching from afar, the former sighing, “A pyrrhic victory indeed, sacrificing 800 soldiers just to slay 1,000 of the enemy!”

Bai Yi vigorously nodded like a chicken pecking rice.

At one point, Yang Kai’s body went limp and slid under the table.

The drunken Chai Fang on the opposite side broke into loud laughter, “This Old Master won!”

Saying so, he also collapsed onto the table.

Silavin: Haha. Really enjoy these kinds of chapters. But, the drinking part is true. Seriously annoying.
