In the sky, two figures flew forward at the speed of lightning.

Yang Kai led the way while the injuries on his fists were gradually healing thanks to his powerful restorative ability. He was secretly shocked by this young woman’s brute force. It was unknown where this young woman came from. He swept his Divine Sense over her and saw that she was actually carrying her hands behind her back, following him closely like a shadow without leaving a single step further behind him, her face calm and unpretentious.

It was like she was out for a stroll and then casually decided to fight him.

Yang Kai was instantly exasperated and took in a gentle breath. The irritation and anger in his heart gradually calmed down and his expression regained serenity. Although the other party seemed young and unreasonable, her strength was beyond question.

Although there was no grievance nor enmity between the two of them as this was truly the first time they ever met, since the other party held murderous intent towards him, Yang Kai would not back down.

[If you want to kill me, I will kill you. We will see who dies first.]

They travelled a few tens of thousands of kilometres away from Flowing Shadow City into a stretch of barren mountains.

Yang Kai suddenly stopped and turned around.

The young woman’s figure also halted three hundred metres away from him. Looking around, she pursed her pink lips and mocked, “Is this the burial location you chose for yourself? Your taste is quite bad.”

“Ha!” Yang Kai snickered, “Ignorant woman, thinking that you’re so great with just a little brute force, you still don’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth!”

This was something other people would tell him, and it was his first time ridiculing others the same way. He felt uneasy for having a feeling of being a wicked person, and generally speaking, the people who dared talk to him like that had all ended miserably.

The young woman continued mocking, “It doesn’t matter whether you pick a wasteland or a paradise to die on, since you dared to refine those things, I will rip them from your body then shred your corpse, letting you die without a burial!”

While she was talking, she extended her scarlet tongue and licked her red lips as though she was looking at a delicious feast, a shade of coquettish charm appearing on her pure and na?ve face. Yang Kai was startled as his heart rate elevated as he wondered how that little tongue would feel on him.

[Damn it, that’s an enemy right in front of you, how could you be seduced by her beauty? Is it because of the abstinence I endured since coming to Star Boundary?] Yang Kai scolded himself and immediately circulated his Secret Art to clear his mind.

“Are you ready?” The young woman raised her eyes and asked with a feigned harmless sweet smile.

Yang Kai burst out in a laugh and answered in equal arrogance, “Come! This Young Master will teach you a good lesson on behalf of your pare…PFT…”

Before he could finish, Yang Kai felt a huge force on his abdomen. There was no trace of the young woman three hundred metres away, only a faint afterimage left in the same spot where she once stood while her petite figure had long closed the distance between them and threw out a punch.

As if an Emperor Realm Master self-destructed in his face, Yang Kai felt a spasm in his stomach and he opened his mouth to douse the young woman’s head and face with a mouthful of blood. The impact sent him flying backward like a sac, directly colliding with a mountain peak.

*Hong long long…*

Rubble flew everywhere as the thousand-metre peak caved in. A huge hole appeared on the mountainside, but Yang Kai was nowhere to be seen.

The young woman retrieved her fist and straightened her back to stare at the hole and sneered, “Overconfident.”

With her strength, even a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master would find it difficult to resist, so could a trivial First-Order Emperor Realm be impudent in front of her? He really did not know how to write the word ‘death’.

This time, she had come to the Southern Territory to investigate the whereabouts of her clan’s treasure on orders from her Elder. She had no clue after searching many places until she encountered Yang Kai when she passed through Flowing Shadow City.

Had he been an ordinary Emperor Realm Master, she would have ignored him like air, but Yang Kai actually refined something taboo, and as a member of her clan, she naturally had the responsibility and obligation to erase him.

It was funny that this Human was arrogant enough to challenge her alone without knowing her true identity. His courage was worth complimenting, but his intelligence was sorely lacking.

Lifting her pink little hand up and wiping the blood from her face, she stared at it for a moment as she frowned and muttered, “It’s golden…”

It was her first time encountering a Human with golden blood, and the vitality contained in this blood was quite shocking even to her.

Sticking out the tip of her tongue to lick the golden blood, the young woman’s face changed slightly as she mused, “Demon Essence… with spirituality, how strange.”

She tasted an absolutely repulsive aura in this blood, but at the same time felt a sense of intimacy with it.

Yang Kai’s Golden Blood originated from the Demon Mystic Tome he obtained at the beginning of his cultivation journey. He had used the power contained in the black book to refine his blood into pure Golden Blood, which was why it emitted a rich Demon Essence. He also refined the Golden Divine Dragon Source though, which carried a pure spirituality that provided an extraordinary restorative ability to his blood.

The two had perfectly combined and blended with each other over time.

The Demon Essence refined from the Demon Mystic Tome should not be able to withstand the spirituality of the ever-strengthening Golden Divine Dragon Source at all, but the pure Ancient Demon Qi sealed within Yang Kai had subtly affected his physique after being unsealed several times, leading to a delicate balance being achieved.

A thunderous explosion blasted from the hole made on the side of the mountain, followed by a stream of light flying out from it which turned into Yang Kai’s figure, appearing in front of the young woman again.

“You…” The young woman was taken aback and looked forward in astonishment. She thought that Yang Kai would be severely injured even if he did not die after taking her punch. How could she have anticipated that the other party still had the ability to move? On top of that, he returned with high morale, his Emperor Qi surging as his eyes shone with a terrifying light.

“It hurts!” Yang Kai exclaimed, but a lofty look instead of a pained one was shown on his face, gritting his teeth as he shouted, “Woman, I underestimated you! It would be impolite to not reciprocate your gift, so take a punch from this Old Master in return!”

As he spoke, his aura condensed, like a volcano about to erupt as he concentrated all of his power on his fist. Space Principles fluctuated and he reappeared right in front of the young woman while throwing a punch towards her chest.

If the punch was not evaded, this pair of voluptuous peaks would definitely rupture. Yang Kai did not mean to take advantage of her, but her figure was so small that the punch Yang Kai threw could only strike her chest, just as she did not deliberately choose to attack Yang Kai’s abdomen.

In the face of a life or death threat, there was no doubt that Yang Kai would throw this punch no matter how soft and tender the enemy’s skin was, or even if she was a stunning beauty dancing in front of him.

Five coloured rays bloomed around his fist as his Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi swirled, strengthening the blow.

Inexplicably, Yang Kai felt invigorated and unspeakable pleasure filled his heart. This type of simple and crude battle was truly able to unleash a man’s ferocious instincts.

The vortex of strength suddenly appeared and space cracked. What was thrown out was no longer just a fist, but a lifelong perception of the Martial Dao, a condensation of Yang Kai’s will and cultivation. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The young woman narrowed her eyes slightly, obviously a little surprised. She did not expect that Yang Kai, a trivial First-Order Emperor Realm Human, could unleash such violent power. Combined with the vitality of the golden blood, the young woman suspected that Yang Kai should have cultivated some incredible Body Tempering Art, otherwise, it would be impossible for him to achieve this.

Sneering secretly in her heart, she mocked how he dared to address himself as Old Master in front of her at his young age. Despite her youthful appearance, she happened to have a very long growth cycle, so in fact, she was a few hundred years old already.

“You will regret that you didn’t die easily just now.” The young woman’s crimson lips parted slightly. She stood still on the spot, simply raising her hand and thrusting out her palm to meet Yang Kai’s fist. The small, tender hand was like an exquisite piece of artwork carved from the finest jade thrown into a raging storm at sea that could shatter it to pieces in the next moment.

*Pa… *

Fist met palm, and the only thing about the young woman that moved was her dress as she successfully blocked Yang Kai’s confident, incredible blow, as though the punch was nothing more than a headless fly instead of a violent, fatal attack.

The young woman stood tall as her beautiful eyes filled with a mocking light.

“Fuck!” Yang Kai was accustomed to engaging in strong, incredible fights, but could not help but drop his jaw at that moment. The conflict between what he imagined would happen and reality at the critical moment was too abrupt and somewhat unacceptable to him.

Even though he knew that the power of this young woman was immense, Yang Kai did not expect it to be so great. It felt like her strength was completely out of his league.

“My turn!” The young woman smiled with a laugh very much resembling the sweet-sounding chime of a silver bell, but that sweet sound was like a horrifying knell to Yang Kai. The palm that blocked Yang Kai’s punch closed around his fist was soft and supple, but Yang Kai instantly felt that his fist was firmly locked, unable to move.

Immediately afterwards, the young woman pulled back her free arm as if she was pulling a bowstring, and her figure leaned slightly backwards to support the action, her light blue dress almost failed to contain her ample peaks as her movement threatened to rip apart its fabric.

*Hong… *

The bowstring was at full tension and the arrow was released, sending the flying tender fist that was wrapped in an aura of pure destructive energy forward.

Yang Kai’s eyes widened dramatically as he gathered all the strength he could in his free hand and punched out, creating a barrage of fists shadows.

Explosions blasted one after another, accompanied by Yang Kai’s muffled grunts.

*Chi… *

Yang Kai staggered back, his Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi collapsing. His attacking fist was distorted and bloody, and the flesh on the knuckles of the other fist was completely scraped off, exposing his bones.

The vitality in his chest rolled, and Yang Kai could not stop himself from coughing up another mouthful of blood. Desperate to save some face, he raised his head with difficulty and spat, “Mediocre!”

“Really?” The corner of the young woman’s mouth curled up into a sneer as she thought to herself, [Humans were really pathetic, he still doesn’t repent when he is about to die, even daring to speak contrary to his own thoughts. He probably regrets it now and is scared to death. Maybe he will kneel down and beg for mercy later.]

[He might just turn around and run away now; after all, he knows that defeat is inevitable, no one would be stupid enough to continue resisting stubbornly in the face of an undefeatable enemy.]

“Again!” Yang Kai roared as he gathered his strength again. Before the young woman could answer, he shot towards her.

[He actually… Came head-on!] The young woman’s heart jumped, feeling that the matter was progressing a little differently from what she had imagined. Could she have already punched him senseless and he was now acting like a madman?
