Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain & Dhael Ligerkeys

Star Ascendance Peak was extremely high and had many barriers surrounding it. It was the highest level Restricted Area of ​​Star Emperor Mountain so it was naturally well-protected. If one wanted to arrive here, they could only do so by foot as the powerful Flight Inhibiting Array arranged here was enough to ground any cultivator.

On the trail between the peaks, Yang Kai and Ye Xi Yun advanced swiftly and quickly climbed to the top of the peak.

The Origin King Grade Starship parked halfway up the mountain, ready to charge in at any time.

The tens-of-kilometres-long walk was nothing to the two of them, so it only took them about half an hour to reach their destination.

As the winds whipped about, the pair’s robes rustled lightly.

“Great Elder, it seems someone has come to welcome us,” Yang Kai’s eyes instantly focused on the old man and the middle-aged man in front of him, a grin creeping onto his face.

Ye Xi Yun narrowed her phoenix eyes as she stared at the old man with a slightly complicated expression, calling out a low voice, “Qi Tian Che!”

“Senior Sister Ye!” The old man made a light smile which seemed quite refreshing, as if there was no ill will between the two of them at all. “With your temperament, Junior Brother had not expected that there would be a day you would actually return to Star Emperor Mountain.”

“There are a great many things you didn’t expect. Junior Brother Qi, are you prepared?”

“And what is it Junior Brother should be prepared for?” Qi Tian Che maintained his smile.

“Prepared to fall here. I hope you’ve made appropriate funeral arrangements!” Ye Xi Yun coldly snorted.

“Senior Sister does not need to worry, Junior Brother has already made all the necessary arrangements. Today, whether you die or I die, this boy will ensure that a proper burial is held,” Qi Tian Che gestured to the side where the indifferent faced Leng Qing nodded gently.

“In that case, Senior Sister will send Junior Brother on his way,” Ye Xi Yun gently nodded.

“Haha, Junior Brother feels that Senior Sister’s chances of losing are greater.”

The two failed to agree upon a single word. The Senior Sister and Junior Brother pair knew a fight was unavoidable so they were simply launching psychological attacks before they began exchanging blows. After the verbal confrontation, the atmosphere suddenly became solemn, as the expressions of both of them turned extremely serious, staring at one another like they were the greatest of enemies.

Suddenly, the two figures flickered, disappearing from where they stood at the exact same moment.

When they reappeared, the two were only separated by a couple dozen or so metres.

An indescribable force surged from both their bodies and enveloped one another.

In an instant, the space around the pair distorted. The invisible forces which filled the air were so condensed they were nearly tangible and observable to the naked eye as they surged and crashed into each other as the Senior Sister and Junior Brother pair tried to overwhelm one another.

Yang Kai’s brow twitched while Fang Peng’s jaw went slack. Even Leng Qing who was standing in the distance opened his eyes wide.

All three were shocked.

Clearly, both Ye Xi Yun and Qi Tian Che had cultivated their Shi to the grand accomplishment stage and had touched upon the threshold of Domain.

In the first confrontation, the pair were evenly matched!

Whether it was Ye Xi Yun or Qi Tian Che, both showed looks of surprise, the two obviously not having expected that the other party had reached such a level.

But soon, the two of them started to move again. The Bone Incinerating Flame Lamp was summoned by Ye Xi Yun and the Heaven rending flames were gripped with her bare hands as she sent a blast after blast towards Qi Tian Che, occasionally mixing in her own Secret Techniques.

Qi Tian Che naturally didn’t back down, summoning a golden wheel-like artifact above his head, like a small sun. As this wheel rotated, dazzling golden light lased from the artifact, each beam containing might equal to the bone incinerating flames.

Muttering words under his breath as he continued to form complex hands seals, Qi Tian Che launched a fierce assault that matched Ye Xi Yun’s blow for blow.

[Sun and Moon Golden Wheel!] Yang Kai looked at the artifact Qi Tian Che summoned and his eyes lit up.

He could recognize this artifact because Ye Xi Yun had informed him about it beforehand.

This was one of the two Origin King Grade artifacts left on Star Emperor Mountain and was of extremely high grade. It seemed this artifact was refined by the Great Emperor thousands of years ago and could absorb the essence of the sun and the moon, contain it, then release it endlessly when confronting an enemy.

There were two forms to the Sun and Moon Golden Wheel. Currently, it was displaying the first, where it radiated the scorching sun’s divine light.

When it assumed its second form, it would take on the appearance of a crescent moon and the beams it would release were extremely cold, enough to freeze the soul of a person.

In terms of power alone, the Sun and Moon Golden Wheel was actually above the Bone Incinerating Flame Lamp, but as with any artifact, the stronger the power, the more Saint Qi it required to operate.

Ye Xi Yun and Qi Tian Che both stood at the apex of Shadowed Star cultivators, so even if their respective artifacts had a gap in power, a battle between them would not be decided quickly.

As Yang Kai was watching attentively though, he suddenly frowned, stretching out his hand and summoning his Purple Shield to protect himself in the next instant.

*Hong...*

With a loud bang, Yang Kai’s body shook slightly and his expression became gloomy.

Glancing over, he saw Fang Peng standing there sneering at him.

“Sect Master Fang, launching a sneak attack at such a time isn’t in good taste, is it? If you want to fight, just say so, this Sect Master will gladly accompany you to your end!” Yang Kai snorted.

“Enough nonsense, Boy, since you dared come to this Star Emperor Mountain, don’t even dream of leaving alive. Today, this will be your burial place!” Fang Peng roared.

Because of Yang Kai, he was forced to abandon Thunder Typhoon Sect’s ten thousand year foundation, and even use that very foundation to set a trap to try to extinguish this boy. Now, since Yang Kai had appeared here unharmed, it was obvious his previous plot had failed, not only destroying his Sect’s headquarters in Thunder Typhoon Canyon but also wasting the lives of his five Martial Seniors.

If Yang Kai did not die here, today, Thunder Typhoon Sect would never be able to rise again.

Only by killing him could Thunder Typhoon Sect make a comeback.

“Your words are bold, Old Dog. If you want my life, you’ll have to come get it yourself, though I doubt you have the ability!” Yang Kai snorted as he stretched out his hand and summoned his Firebird Artifact Spirit.

A loud dragon roar also rang out as Yang Kai summoned the Verdant Dragon Bone Sword and transformed it into a giant dark green dragon floating above his head.

*Chi chi chi...*

A series of Space Blades appeared beside Yang Kai and flew towards Fang Peng rapidly under the control of his Divine Sense.

Fang Peng’s complexion changed drastically. Although he had spoken both aggressively and confidently, he was by no means underestimating Yang Kai. After witnessing Yang Kai’s many methods, he naturally didn’t dare to be negligent.

His body flashed brilliantly and a majestic looking Artifact Armour appeared.

Defending before attacking showed that Fang Peng was lacking in confidence.

At the same time, his wrist shook and a long whip suddenly appeared, the aura it pulsed with indicating it was an Origin King Grade artifact.

Thunder Typhoon Sect was one of the two giants of Shadowed Star, so it had a hallowed treasure of this grade. This Thunder Fire Seven Birds Whip was the most precious artifact Thunder Typhoon Sect possessed and had been part of its core inheritance for thousands of years.

Normally, it was never used, but Fang Peng had taken it away with him when he withdrew from Thunder Typhoon Sect. Now that he was confronting Yang Kai, he summoned it without hesitation.

This long whip was discovered by one of Thunder Typhoon Sect’s ancestors in an Ancient Ruin when he was out for life experience. It was said that it was also quite famous in ancient times. Refining it had consumed countless rare materials and there were even the Souls of powerful bird-type Monster Beasts sealed inside it, allowing the whip to transform into the appearance of these monster birds.

Finally, it had been tempered in a Ten Thousand Year Thunder Fire Pool, which allowed it to absorb the power of thunder fire.

Any artifact below Origin King Grade couldn’t withstand its lashing as once it was contaminated by this powerful thunder fire, the spirituality of any lesser artifact would be greatly damaged.

As the long whip lashed, faint sounds of thunder resounded.

At that moment, the Firebird rushed to the top of Fang Peng’s head, opened its beak wide, and shot out a fireball larger than the washbasin towards him.

Holding the Origin King Grade artifact in his hand, Fang Peng was unafraid of this fireball and he simply waved the Thunder Fire Seven Birds Whip viciously towards the Firebird.

A sad, piercing cry rang out from the Firebird as it failed to evade this blow and its body suddenly dimmed, seemingly suffering some trauma.

Yang Kai’s expression changed greatly when he saw this, but he soon calmed down. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He could sense that the Firebird was injured, but that it wasn’t a major problem and had only ignited its anger.

The series of Space Blades reached Fang Peng at this time. Facing this strange, esoteric force, Fang Peng did not dare confront it head-on, his body flickering as he dodged, reappearing an instant later only a dozen or so metres from where Yang Kai stood.

The Thunder Fire Seven Birds Whip traced a beautiful and sinister arc as it lashed towards Yang Kai.

Worthy of being a master at the peak Third-Order Origin Returning Realm and the Sect Master of one of Shadowed Star’s greatest Sects, both Fang Peng’s strength and skill were far above that of an average cultivator. His Saint Qi was especially pure and dense, nearly exceeding the normal bounds of the Third-Order.

The opponent’s attack was timed and aimed perfectly, making it impossible to dodge, so Yang Kai could only resort to using his Purple Shield to defend himself.

However, the Thunder Fire Seven Birds Whip changed direction mid-air, avoiding the position of Purple Shield as if it had its own intelligence. Fang Peng shook his wrist and the long whip stiffened straight and thrust out like a long spear towards Yang Kai’s heart.

At that moment, the long whip transformed into the figure of a demon bird as it let out a faint cry.

This bird somewhat resembling an eagle with sharp claws and a wingspan of several tens of metres which could obscure the sun’s light.

A Heavenly Peng!

Yang Kai stared at this attack indifferently, as if he was unaware that disaster was approaching him, not even showing any intention to dodge.

A lofty dragon roar resounded from above as the dark green dragon shook its head and waved its tail as it intercepted the Heavenly Peng. In the next moment, the two collided together, dragon roars and bird cries filling the air along with violent energy fluctuations that distorted the surrounding space.

The Heavenly Peng’s manifestation dimmed at visible rate while on the contrary the giant dark green dragon only became more and more ferocious.

“Impossible!” Fang Peng was shocked as he stared at the giant dark-green dragon in a daze, unable to believe what he was seeing.

He knew that the Verdant Bone Sword in Yang Kai’s hand was quite powerful, but he never thought that it was an Origin King Grade artifact!

If it weren’t, there was no way it could clash with the Thunder Fire Seven Birds Whip for so long. Moreover, the thunder fire of the whip, which could corrode the spirituality of an artifact, did not affect the giant dark green dragon. Instead, it was the Thunder Fire Seven Birds Whip that seemed to be taking damage.

Yang Kai’s giant dark green dragon was actually an extremely poisonous and corrosive existence!

Fang Peng’s face changed drastically as he desperately urged his Saint Qi and Spiritual Energy.

The Heavenly Peng phantom immediately disappeared, transforming back into its long whip form, breaking away from the entanglement of the giant dark-green, dragon-like snake, and returning to Fang Peng’s hand.
