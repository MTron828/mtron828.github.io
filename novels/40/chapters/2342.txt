With an imposing expression on his face, Yang Kai also took a step forward and said while withstanding the Emperor Pressure, “Liu Yan, bring them into the Sealed World. I’ll deal with this old man!”

Qiu Ze was a mere Emperor Realm Master who had just broken through recently and had not stabilized his cultivation yet, so Yang Kai wasn’t afraid of him.

In Thousand Leaves Sect’s Sealed World, he had even encountered a Third-Order Emperor Realm Corpse Puppet and battled against it. Even though he had to use up all his cards and also got the help of Embodiment and Liu Yan, at least he had experience against an even stronger opponent than Qiu Ze, so why should he be afraid of someone in the First-Order Emperor Realm?

Now that he had a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation, Yang Kai was actually eager to use this opportunity to test his strength.

The heavy Emperor Pressure was dense like a solid mass as it gushed over furiously, giving one the illusion that they were drowning, unable to catch their breath.

Ye Hen and the others were already in bad shape. If Yang Kai had not been in front of them blocking it, then they may have fainted on the spot.

“Master, if you feel confident enough, how about delaying him for a while and leaving the rest to me?” Liu Yan suddenly whispered from behind him.

Yang Kai was stunned. He had no idea where Liu Yan got this confidence from. Even though she survived unscathed after taking a blow from Qiu Ze, and the toughness of a Spirit Puppet’s body was clear to see, there were so many Masters here after all. What’s more, how could an Emperor Realm Master like Qiu Ze be easy to deal with?

Yang Kai himself wasn’t confident he could completely defeat all of them and originally planned to go for their ringleader to crush their fighting spirit. It would be best if he could kill Qiu Ze, but seriously injuring him would work too. As long as he was able to defeat Qiu Ze, then the rest of them would become like a handful of loose sand, nothing to be scared of.

But Liu Yan’s calm and confident tone intrigued Yang Kai.

He wondered what sort of trump card Liu Yan’s Spirit Puppet body came with, for her to have such guts to look down on all these Masters.

But this was clearly not the time to ask that question. Yang Kai could only respond by asking, “How sure are you?”

Liu Yan sneered, “One hundred percent!”

Yang Kai twisted his head around to look at her in astonishment. Only when he realized she wasn’t joking at all did he nod his head, “Fine, then I’ll be waiting and watching!”

“One cup of tea’s time!” While saying that, Liu Yan suddenly sat down cross-legged and shut her eyes tightly.

None of them knew what she was planning to do, and Ye Hen was feeling even more anxious. He kept on signalling to Yang Kai with his eyes to tell him to escape. Seeing this, Hua Qing Si pondered for a moment before assuring him, “Rest assured, Sect Master Ye. Young Master Yang has his own plans, he won’t let anything happen to us.”

Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space, and this was where the Space Array was located. Even if they were defeated, they could still teleport to the Sealed World through the array, so there was nothing for them to be afraid of.

What’s more, she was curious to see what Liu Yan wanted to do.

Hearing her say so, Ye Hen could only compromise with them helplessly and hope for a miracle in his heart.

“Sister Hua, take care of them. If things go sour, then activate the Space Array and enter the Sealed World.” After advising her, Yang Kai’s aura suddenly surged. A clear layer of Principle Strength was lingering around his body, ignoring the suppression of Qiu Ze’s Emperor Pressure as if it was nothing, instantly cutting it apart like a sharp knife.

“You really do have some skills. No wonder you dare to be so arrogant!” Qiu Ze said in surprise.

He had already advanced to the Emperor Realm, so he knew how great the disparity was between the Emperor Realm and Dao Source Realm. His own strength had swelled by more than ten times since advancing, so he was confident he could take care of any Dao Source Realm cultivator within three moves.

He originally thought that nobody would be able to move freely under the suppression of his Emperor Pressure, and everyone would be at his mercy, but he knew he was wrong as soon as he saw Yang Kai move. He could have never imagined a Dao Source Realm cultivator existing in this world that could break through his Emperor Pressure.

The Principle Strength lingering around his body was pure and mysterious, making it hard to ascertain its properties.

Qiu Ze instantly realized that Yang Kai was no ordinary Dao Source Realm. Coupled with Hua Qing Si’s performance earlier, he was even more convinced that the two of them came from some top Sect and had a special heritage no one else had.

As he spoke, Qiu Ze became angry out of shame. He quickly formed hand seals and the might of his Emperor Pressure was further enhanced.

As an Emperor Realm Master, it would be a joke if he needed a Dao Source Realm cultivator like Yang Kai to rush over to him, so he spared no effort as soon as he made the first move.

In fact, his Emperor Pressure proved effective very soon. As he formed his hand seals, Yang Kai’s body was stopped in place and the calm and relaxed expression on his face had become difficult, his movements slowing to a crawl.

Right at that moment, a figure suddenly rose into the air. With fierce rage, Luo Jin held the Jade Sceptre-like artifact in his hands and poured his Source Qi into it, shouting with all his might, “Die, you brat!”

As he said that, he fiercely swung his sceptre down at Yang Kai.

He followed Qiu Ze on this trip in order to seek revenge on Yang Kai and knew he had little chance of killing him with his own skill. At that time, with just a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation, Yang Kai was able to beat him to the point where he could not resist. Now that Yang Kai had reached the Third-Order, the gap between them had certainly grown even larger, making it even more impossible for him to fight him.

If he wanted revenge, Luo Jin would need to borrow Qiu Ze’s power.

Now was, without a doubt, the best time to strike. Yang Kai was being suppressed by Qiu Ze’s Emperor Pressure and was likely unable to bring out even half of his full strength. Once Yang Kai was hit by his artifact, he would surely die.

Qiu Ze did not care whether Yang Kai lived or died anyway. All he needed was his corpse to boil it into medicinal soup. That’s why Luo Jin figured this move would be unlikely to offend him.

At this moment, Luo Jin struck boldly and without hesitation or looking back. The shame and humiliation he suffered by Yang Kai’s hands before this all burst out at this moment.

With a single blow, the air caved in. The Jade Sceptre seemed to contain Heaven destroying and Earth-shattering might, and its destructive aura was rushing straight towards Yang Kai.

The smile on Luo Jin’s face was becoming fiercer and fiercer, and a vague thirst for revenge could also be seen in his eyes, as if he could already see Yang Kai dying from his blow.

Even Qiu Ze was cooperating with Luo Jin’s actions at that moment, concentrating his Emperor Pressure into a binding force to restrict Yang Kai’s movements.

*Hong...*

As the Jade Sceptre fell, a dark hole appeared where Yang Kai was, leaving nothing behind in a ten-meter radius.

Luo Jin landed on the ground and looked at the hole that swallowed up everything in front of him like the open mouth of a beast and couldn’t help but laugh.

“This is bad!” Qiu Ze shouted, his face changing abruptly. He had been binding Yang Kai’s movements with his Emperor Pressure the whole time, but in the instant before Luo Jin’s Jade Sceptre came smashing down, Qiu Ze could sense that Yang Kai had mysteriously disappeared. He had no idea how it happened, but he seemed to have lost all trace of Yang Kai after a moment of oversight.

“There was a path to the Heavens but you refused to take it, and no door to Hell but you just had to throw yourself at it!” An eerie voice suddenly sounded from behind Luo Jin, causing his hair to stand on end, his blood to flow backwards, and his feet to cramp up.

“City Lord Luo, watch out!”

“Behind you!”

Ruan Hong Bo and Mu Zheng shouted in unison, both of them looking behind Luo Jin in horror as if they had seen something unbelievable.

A cold sweat fell along Luo Jin’s forehead. At this moment, Luo Jin’s perception was infinitely amplified and he could clearly feel the cold and murderous intent coming from behind him.

Almost without hesitation, he tried to escape, but before he could do anything, he felt a slight sting on his chest and his whole body froze in place. The blood and Source Qi running through his body completely froze in an instant.

Eyes widening in horror, he looked down at his chest, only to see the broad tip of a sword penetrating through his chest, with red blood coating the blade.

“City Lord Luo did not appreciate it when I spared his life. In that case, die early and reincarnate early!” Yang Kai coldly snorted, the Myriads Sword in his hand shivering as Source Qi poured into it.

Without even a single cry, Luo Jin directly exploded into a mist of blood, spilling onto the ground.

To Yang Kai, Luo Jin was extremely ungrateful. He had allowed him to live because of Luo Bing, but not only did he not know when to stop, he even repaid his kindness with enmity, joining Qiu Ze and the others in the fight against Thousand Leaves Sect. Naturally, Yang Kai would not forgive him again.

Yang Kai reached out and grabbed Luo Jin’s Space Ring and Jade Sceptre-like artifact and shoved them into the Sealed World Bead.

In the biting cold breeze, Yang Kai wielded the Myriads Sword, clothes flowing behind him as his murderous intent flared.

Breaths of cold air being sucked in could be heard. Mu Zheng, Ruan Hong Bo, and the others involuntarily backed away, all of them looking completely horrified and dumbfounded. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn’t have believed that Luo Jin would die just like that.

Luo Jin was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master and his strength was equal or slightly greater than theirs. Not one of them was confident they could win against him in a one-on-one fight, but now, he was killed by Yang Kai in just a single blow.

And this had happened under Qiu Ze’s suppression. If he were not suppressed by Qiu Ze, then wouldn’t Luo Jin have died even faster?

[Who is this little brat? He can’t be some Emperor Realm Master hiding his cultivation to toy with us, right?] Mu Zheng and the others all had ugly looks on their faces. They all had the vague thought that perhaps it was not the wisest idea for them to have followed Qiu Ze over to Thousand Leaves Sect to look for trouble.

Yang Kai was able to do this much at just the Third-Order Dao Source Realm. If he rose to the Emperor Realm one day, how were they going to survive? For a moment, the Sect Masters from the local big Sects all began feeling worried and anxious.

On the other hand, Ye Hen was similarly shocked, but even more than that, he was excited.

Even though he had heard of Yang Kai’s strength from Ye Jing Han before, hearing about it and seeing it for himself were two different matters. [The Thousand Leaves Sect... may be saved!]

A faint light of hope was rekindled in Ye Hen’s originally dim eyes. He gently patted Ye Jing Han’s hand and said weakly, “Jing Han, you have good judgment. If this disaster can be avoided, then in the future... You should follow Young Master Yang more often.”

If not for Ye Jing Han and Du Xian being childhood sweethearts that have long grown deeply in love, then he would’ve liked for his daughter to marry Yang Kai.

If such a promising young man could be tied to Thousand Leaves Sect, it would be a great blessing.

“Yes, Father!” Ye Jing Han’s beautiful eyes were also bright and covered in joy. A few days ago, at the City Lord’s Mansion, Yang Kai performed a miracle and suppressed many Masters to the point where they could hardly catch their breaths. He then strutted out of the city with the new bride. But could he still perform another miracle in the Thousand Leaves Sect with an Emperor Realm Master in attendance?
