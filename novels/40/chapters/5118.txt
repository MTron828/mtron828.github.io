Ancestor wants to eat pancakes…

Ancestor wants to drink tea…

Ancestor wants…

Almost every other day, a new decree would be issued, sending the entire Seven Stars Sect into a flurry of activity. The Sect Master, Shang Guan Ji, was in charge of coordinating their response, leading the various Emperor Realm Elders to work together. Every time a decree was issued, all of the Sect’s manpower would be mobilized, completing the request in the shortest time possible no matter what the Ancestor demanded.

After completing several of Ancestor’s decrees, an Emperor Realm Elder suddenly asked, “Sect Master, what is the Ancestor doing?”

Shang Guan Ji’s expression turned solemn, “How can we understand the Ancestor’s thoughts? Don’t think too much about it, meticulously completing every task is more important.”

The Elder nodded repeatedly in agreement, “Naturally, we can’t fathom the Ancestor’s thoughts. It’s just that, I think that the requests Ancestor has raised aren’t something he needs personally.”

Shang Guan Ji glanced at him, immersing deep into his thoughts, “You mean…”

The Elder continued, “Sect Master, you must be aware that I became a grandfather a few years ago. My grandson is now six years old and is very playful and gluttonous. When I’m free, he makes all kinds of requests, similar to the decrees issued by the Ancestor. If this Old Master may make a bold presumption, I think that the Ancestor is doing the same thing as this Old Master… coaxing a child!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As soon as these words left his mouth, it resonated with many of the Elders’ hearts as a few even nodded in agreement.

To be honest, many decrees had been passed down over the last few days, so everyone had been able to infer some things from them. Nonetheless, none of them had the courage to ask questions, or make any assumptions, until this Elder boldly spoke.

Shang Guan Ji raised his brow upon hearing this, “Coaxing a child? You might be right, but does that mean the Ancestor has an heir? This is joyous news!”

The Elder replied, “Of course, it’s joyous news, but if he’s really coaxing a child, we can be more proactive in supporting him. It’s extremely hard to fathom a child’s temperament, but as long as they are happy, they will become obedient.”

“What plan do you have?” Shang Guan Ji asked.

The Elder stroked his beard before replying, “If it’s regarding eating, we’ve already prepared a lot of snacks for the Ancestor, so the direction we should be focusing now should be entertainment! To tell you the truth, my grandson is very fond of a certain toy, and he enjoys playing with it quite a lot. If we can give a similar object to the Ancestor, perhaps we can resolve the Ancestor’s predicament.”

“Oh?” Shang Guan Ji became interested, “What is it?”

The Elder stroked his beard with a smile before giving its name.

Shang Guan Ji lightly nodded his acknowledgement, “An interesting proposal. In that case, we should quickly make one and hand it over to the Ancestor.”

The Elder readily accepted the order.

After the time it takes to boil a cup of tea, Yang Kai suddenly reached out as something appeared in his hand, handing it to the Old Ancestor on his neck, “Here, this is for you!”

The Old Ancestor glanced at it before smacking Yang Kai’s head and angrily asking, “Do you think I’m a child?”

Yang Kai’s neck shrank back.

Be that as it may, the Old Ancestor took the object in his hand with a light snort before she started shaking it in satisfaction.

It was a rattle-drum.

After they gifted Yang Kai the rattle drum that day, the frequency with which the Ancestor issued new decrees greatly decreased. Although they still needed to prepare some food from time to time, it was not as frequent as before. After the initial hustle and bustle, Seven Stars Sect was able to quickly and effectively complete the Ancestor’s orders.

The Ancestor was obviously very satisfied with their performance, even bestowing them with some materials and many insights about condensing their Dao Seals. The Seven Stars Sect’s higher-ups were naturally very grateful.

A month passed in the blink of an eye…

After travelling non-stop, Yang Kai was already close to Yin-Yang Pass. He didn’t run into many Black Ink Clansmen on the way, so the journey was quite smooth and uneventful.

On this day, Yang Kai saw the towering Yin-Yang Pass from afar, but just as he had expected, it was surrounded by the Black Ink Clan’s army.

It had been over half a year since the Black Ink Clan’s army had engaged Yin-Yang Pass’ army. During this time, both sides must have clashed on quite a few occasions already. When Yang Kai arrived, both sides were in a heightened state of tension, but not much fighting was happening.

This also made sense.

Every time the Black Ink Clan army besieged a Great Pass, the battle would last for an extremely long time, ranging from a decade or two to a century. During this time, the Black Ink Clan army would constantly replenish their own forces until their casualties were too many for them to bear.

When the Black Ink Clan army retreated, the Humans would finally have some precious time to rest and recover

Yin-Yang Pass was right ahead, and if Yang Kai was alone, he could have used the Universe Transference Law to return directly. Every Great Pass had four Purifying Black Ink Battleships, and all of them had a Universe Array that Yang Kai had personally installed, so it was only natural that he had left his Imprint on them.

But as he also had the Old Ancestor with him, he was unable to use the Universe Transference Law.

The Old Ancestor’s cultivation had been completely exhausted, so if she were to encounter any danger, she would be powerless to defend herself. If he wanted to return to the Inner Sanctum, he would have to plan his every step very carefully.

The Old Ancestor, on the other hand, seemed to want nothing more than to see the world plunge into chaos. She urged Yang Kai to press on. According to her, if Yang Kai were to appear, the soldiers of Yin-Yang Pass would definitely come to support him. At that time, they might find a chance to safely return to the Inner Sanctum by working together, especially since Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space.

Yang Kai decisively refused the Old Ancestor’s proposal.

The child version of the Old Ancestor was too reckless. Although her proposal did have a chance of success, it carried a huge risk.

As it concerned the safety of the Old Ancestor, Yang Kai didn’t dare to be careless.

“Then, what do you suggest we do?” Having her proposal rejected, the Old Ancestor was obviously upset.

“Let’s wait. It’s impossible for the two sides to continue staring at each other peacefully. When the fighting really starts, we’ll find a place with weak defences and break through.”

It was not the first time Yang Kai had done something like this, but the last time he did it, he had hundreds of others accompanying him. This time, he could only rely on himself.

Having made his decision, Yang Kai immediately found a universe fragment and settled down.

This universe fragment wasn’t very big, and there were traces of mining on it. Possibly, Yin-Yang Pass had used Void Yin-Yang Mirrors to transport a Universe World back here, mined it, and then discarded the leftovers.

The Black Ink Clan probably didn’t expect any Humans to stop over in such a place, so they did not have any intention of investigating it.

For the next few days, although the two Races clashed with each other, it was only some small skirmishes, nothing too big.

Yang Kai patiently waited.

Finally, after half a month, Yang Kai, who was cultivating, suddenly felt powerful energy fluctuations coming from the direction of Yin-Yang Pass. When he looked up, he saw the Black Ink Clan army attacking Yin-Yang Pass in a frenzy. The entire battlefield was shrouded in rich Black Ink Strength and he could see countless Black Ink Clouds of all sizes spanning over the entire battlefield.

This was his chance!

Yang Kai stood up and started paying close attention to the battle. The Old Ancestor also climbed onto his shoulder and sat down in her special seat, staring at the battle with widened eyes.

Facing the frenzied attacks of the Black Ink Clan, the Humans basically left everything to Yin-Yang Pass’ strong defences. So long as Yin-Yang Pass remained standing, the Black Ink Clan was basically unable to do anything to the Human Race. All of their attacks were just a waste of energy.

On the other hand, the Spirit Arrays and artifacts set up around Yin-Yang Pass could effectively kill the incoming Black Ink Clan.

This assault lasted for three full days before the Black Ink Clan’s momentum weakened all of a sudden. At that moment, Warships suddenly appeared from the gates of Yin-Yang Pass one by one. Immediately after, figures charged straight at them one after another, attacking them.

The soldiers of the two Races were instantly locked into another heated confrontation on this massive battlefield. Countless Black Ink Clansmen instantly lost their lives, whereas many Human Race Warships were reduced to shambles.

“Let’s go!” Yang Kai shouted and rushed towards Yin-Yang Pass.

Riding on his shoulders, the Old Ancestor tightly gripped his hair with one hand, while pointing ahead with the other, looking all excited as she shouted, “Charge!”

In the chaotic battlefield, no one on either side noticed a pair of figures charging towards them from the rear, until a Dragon Roar reverberated across the battlefield and a golden glow flashed, followed by the majestic appearance of a 30,000-metre-long dragon.

There was a giant spear no smaller than its body in one of the Grand Dragon’s claws, and the moment it appeared, it swept this spear out along the battlefield, cleaving through the unsuspecting Black Ink Clansmen just like a violent gust of wind sweeping away fallen leaves. The Black Ink Clan suffered massive casualties in the blink of an eye and when the Grand Dragon whipped its tail, countless more perished.

On such a battlefield, the destruction a Grand Dragon could cause was simply unimaginable, not to mention the long spear held in its Dragon Claw.

Many of the Black Ink Clansmen turned pale in fright and tried to dodge, but it was still difficult for them to avoid the oncoming death.

Soon, the appearance of the Grand Dragon attracted the attention of both sides. The Masters of both Races quickly converged. One side wanted to intercept the Dragon, while the other wanted to rescue it, which naturally resulted in a fierce clash. The resulting battle shook the universe and caused the void to collapse.

The Old Ancestor’s small figure stood atop Yang Kai’s Dragon Head, rocking along the Grand Dragon’s movements. She was surrounded by intense murderous intents, storming from every possible direction, but she still remained steadfast.

Suddenly, a burly figure broke through the rows and rows of enemies and landed on the Dragon Head, bowing and cupping his fist, “Welcome back, Old Ancestor!”

The Old Ancestor lightly nodded, “You’ve worked hard!”

The person who had arrived was none other than the Southern Army Commander, Wu Qing. In the entire Yin-Yang Pass, he was the strongest Open Heaven Realm Master besides the Old Ancestor. He also possessed one of the Four Universe Pillars and was a future hope of the Human Race as rumour had it that he was not far from advancing to the Ninth Order.

If he could really break through to the Ninth Order one day, the Human Race would have another Old Ancestor!

Along with Wu Qing’s arrival, many Open Heaven Realm Masters soon gathered around the Grand Dragon. Even a few Eighth-Order Division Commanders had arrived, escorted by numerous Warships.

Surrounded by the elites of the Human Race, Yang Kai and the Old Ancestor were escorted back to Yin-Yang Pass.

The Black Ink Clan had obviously also discovered the situation here. Although they didn’t quite understand why the Humans were defending the Grand Dragon so heavily, since the enemy was paying so much attention to it, it must be important. As such, the Black Ink Clan rushed in, but no matter how many of them tried, they failed to block the Humans’ advance.

A moment later, Yang Kai and the Old Ancestor were brought to one of Yin-Yang Pass’s main gates under Wu Qing’s lead.

Wu Qing summoned his strength and wrapped it around the Old Ancestor before quickly entering the Inner Sanctum while Yang Kai turned around and joined up with the army to fight back against the Black Ink Clan.
