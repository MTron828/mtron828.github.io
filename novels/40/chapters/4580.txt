This was the first official confrontation between Heavenly Sword Union and Void Land, and it was also a battle that was destined to be fruitless.

For Heavenly Sword Union’s side, as long as Yang Kai does not show up, Zuo Quan Hui’s scheme would be impossible to achieve. As for Void Land, they could not reveal the hidden strength in their hand before they had a certain degree of confidence in killing Zuo Quan Hui.

There were now 20 Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters participating in the battle and over 1,000 Masters were below the Sixth-Order. Across the million kilometres wide battlefield, everyone was locked in a heated melee and bathed in blood.

Yang Kai, who was sitting on the shattered Spirit Province, gazed over the battlefield and issued a series of orders. More and more Open Heaven Realm Masters below the Sixth-Order rushed to the front to solidify Void Land’s advantage.

Since Heavenly Sword Union had decided to follow Zuo Quan Hui’s lead, they couldn’t blame Void Land for not showing any mercy. If they could take advantage of this opportunity to kill all of Heavenly Sword Union Open Heaven Realm Masters below the Sixth-Order, it would be a great victory. At that time, Zuo Quan Hui’s group of Sixth-Order Masters wouldn’t be able to accomplish much.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s eyes focused on a certain spot on the battlefield. After he observed carefully for a moment, he raised his hand and called out, “Lu Xue!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Reporting.” Lu Xue, who had been standing beside him as the messenger, came forward.

“Go deal with that Myriad Demons Heaven disciple!” Yang Kai directed her in a certain direction.

Lu Xue followed the direction of his finger and soon caught sight of her target. Although she didn’t know what was so special about this Myriad Demons Heaven disciple, since Yang Kai had personally ordered her to do so, she could only faithfully obey.

“Yes, Sir!” She quickly replied, but just as she was about to head out, she suddenly received Yang Kai’s voice transmission and nodded in response, “Rest assured, Sir.”

Her figure flickered as she transformed into a streak of light and sped across the battlefield.

A moment later, Lu Xue arrived in front of her target and slashed her sword towards the Myriad Demons Heaven disciple.

The Myriad Demons Heaven Disciple was a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master with extraordinary strength. He was currently locked in a fierce battle with Jin Yuan Lang. Seeing Lu Xue join the battle, not only did he not become afraid, he even licked his lips as if he had seen some delicious food.

Lu Xue couldn’t help but shudder as an inexplicable sense of dread filled her heart. Still, she followed Yang Kai’s instructions and sent him a message without a moment of hesitation!

The Myriad Demons Heaven Disciple’s face, which was beaming with fighting spirit, suddenly went stiff. He pushed his Demon Qi madly as he retreated 100 kilometres before raising his eyes and looking towards the distant shattered Spirit Province.

Lu Xue and Jin Yuan Lang could care less about what he was thinking, and attacked from the left and right. But the Myriad Demons Heaven Disciple only parried the attacks, seemingly no longer having any intention of fighting back.

In a two against one, with both of them being Fifth-Order Masters, the Myriad Demons Heaven disciple quickly fell into a disadvantageous situation. However, no matter how dangerous the situation was, he was always able to find a way to survive. After fighting for a long time, Lu Xue, and Jin Yuan Lang both sighed in amazement. The two of them had almost killed this man several times, but he still managed to stay alive and kicking.

If it weren’t for the fact that he was clearly a Fifth-Order Master, the two of them would have suspected that he was concealing his cultivation; otherwise, how could he be so lucky every time?

Lu Xue and Jin Yuan Lang didn’t fight with the Myriad Demons Heaven disciple for too long. After the time it took for an incense stick to burn, a streak of light suddenly shot out from the Heavenly Sword Palace, shooting towards the void.

Seeing this, the Open Heaven Realm Masters of Heavenly Sword Union all used their Divine Abilities to push back the enemies and then used this opportunity to quickly retreat.

Many Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters fought while retreating, bringing up the rear for the retreating lower Order Open Heaven Realm Masters.

Void Land Masters chased after them, but they didn’t pursue them too far. The deterrent force of the Heavenly Sword Palace was too strong, so no one dared to get too close.

“A cornered enemy should not be pressured!” Yue He was the first to stop, and only then did the people behind her come to a half, calmly watching Heavenly Sword Union disciples flee back to the Heavenly Sword Palace.

After a brief period of silence, the Void Land Open Heaven Realm Masters broke into cheers. No matter what, Void Land had won this battle. Although they hadn’t been able to kill any of the enemy’s Sixth-Order Masters, they had killed many below the Sixth-Order, greatly weakening Heavenly Sword Union’s strength.

Under Yue He’s orders, the cultivators below the Sixth-Order began to clean up the battlefield. Void Land was currently lacking in supplies, and many people had died in this battle. Naturally, the spoils of war had to be collected to replenish their consumption.

Under the leadership of Yue He, the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters flew towards Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue. The sudden appearance of these two fearsome Sixth-Order Masters had provided them with timely help. If they had not stopped Pei Wen Xuan and Luan Bai Feng, a portion of Void Land’s hidden power would have been exposed.

“Greetings, Senior Sister Su.” Yue He respectfully bowed. Su Ying Xue had spent some time in charge of Yin-Yang Heaven’s Dao Temple in Void Star City and was also the one who had told Yang Kai about the Dao Theory Assembly, so Yue He naturally recognized her.

“Junior Sister Yue He!” Su Ying Xue returned the greeting.

“May I ask who this is…” Yue He looked towards Qing Kui curiously. Although she had some guesses in her heart, she couldn’t be certain.

After Su Ying Xue introduced the man, Yue He finally smiled and thanked, “So it is Senior Brother Qing Kui. Many thanks for taking care of Young Master when he was in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven.”

“It’s nothing.” Qing Kui grinned, “Junior Brother Yang is now a son-in-law of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, so naturally we have to take care of our family. Hmm, is Junior Brother Yang on that Spirit Province?”

Yue He nodded her affirmation, “Yes, it’s just that it’s not convenient for him to show his face for the time being. I’m sure Young Master is very happy to see the two of you. Please follow me!”

While everyone was talking, the battlefield had been cleaned up and the Open Heaven Realm Masters returned victoriously.

Inside an impromptu hall hurriedly built on the shattered Spirit Province, Yang Kai stood up and greeted everyone. Yang Kai introduced Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue to everyone, which immediately caused an uproar, but after exchanging greetings, both sides sat down calmly.

“Senior Brother Qing, Senior Sister Su, why are you here?” Yang Kai asked in confusion. Worry was clearly written on his brow, “Furthermore, wouldn’t stopping Pei Wen Xuan cause trouble for you? Will it implicate Martial Uncle Xu?”

If everything went smooth, Pei Wen Xuan would be able to advance to the Eighth-Order! In any Cave Heaven or Paradise, he would be a future pillar of the Sect.

Qing Kui on the other hand was lost in shock as he wondered, [Where did these people come from?]

He was so shocked that he didn’t even hear Yang Kai’s question clearly.

“Senior Brother!” Su Ying Xue gently elbowed him.

“Hmm?” Qing Kui was momentarily stunned, but he quickly came to his senses and calmly replied, “Oh, Junior Sister and I have already been expelled from the Sect by Honoured Master, so there’s nothing to worry about!”

After he finished speaking, his eyes swept over Iron Blood Great Emperor and the others, as if he was trying to figure out what was going on.

“What?” Now it was Yang Kai’s turn to be shocked, “Expelled?”

Being expelled from the Sect was not a trivial matter. Generally speaking, only those who had committed grave mistakes would receive such a harsh punishment. The disciples who were expelled from the Sect would be scorned, and they might even be hunted down.

Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue were both in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm and could be considered Xu Ling Gong’s left and right arms. Even if they had made a terrible mistake, how could they be expelled from the Sect?

But soon, Yang Kai understood and smiled bitterly, “Martial Uncle Xu has put in a lot of effort!”

The so-called expulsion from the Sect was definitely just an excuse to the outside world, just like Zuo Quan Hui’s rebellion from Thousand Crane Paradise. What’s more, since Xu Ling Gog could expel them from the Sect, he could naturally find an excuse to have them return.

Any ordinary High-Rank Open Heaven Master would care a great deal about their face and reputation and might not be able to do this, but Xu Ling Gong didn’t care about such things.

Su Ying Xue indifferently stated, “Honoured Master said that Junior Brother Yang was in trouble and we couldn’t personally help, so he felt uneasy. Moreover, he also had a certain responsibility for this matter, so he sent Senior Brother and myself here to help!”

Yang Kai cupped his fist and bowed his head, “Many thanks to Martial Uncle Xu, many thanks, Senior Brother Qing and Senior Sister Su.”

Qing Kui waved off and stated, “There’s no need to be so polite with us. Originally, Honoured Master wanted to come here personally, but… the Sect didn’t agree.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but laugh, “I wouldn’t dare trouble Martial Uncle Xu!”

Originally, he had some complaints about Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. Although he was the one who killed Zhao Xing from Thousand Crane Paradise, since the rules of the Dao Theory Assembly had been set long ago, Yin-Yang Cave Heaven should have helped him resolve this problem.

Under the pressure of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, Thousand Crane Paradise was unable to publicly and justifiably target Void Land, but Zuo Quan Hui, who had ‘rebelled’, had still caused Void Land to suffer greatly.

Now though, Xu Ling Gong had sent Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue to assist him. And if it weren’t for Yin-Yang Cave Heaven’s disapproval, Xu Ling Gong would have personally come to assist him. The resentment in Yang Kai’s heart immediately disappeared.

In the end, it was all because his strength was insufficient, and because Void Land’s reputation was insufficient!

If he was strong enough and had enough prestige, Thousand Cranes Paradise would not have dared to say anything for the death of a mere Zhao Xing.

“We can achieve great things with your assistance!” Yang Kai said excitedly.

Qing Kui smiled bitterly, “I thought the two of us were delivering charcoal in a frigid winter, but who would have thought that we were just adding flowers to a brocade. Even if we didn’t appear today, with your Void Land’s foundation, it should be enough to deal with Heavenly Sword Union.”

As far as they knew, Void Land had nine Sixth-Order Masters, including Yang Kai, so when they saw Pei Wen Xuan and Luan Bai Feng appear, they immediately appeared to intercept them. But apparently, Void Land still had seven newly advanced Sixth-Order Masters in reserve, so they could have handled it with or without them.
