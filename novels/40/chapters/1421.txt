Chapter 1421, Emperor Jade

“Why do you all look so distressed?” Yang Kai suddenly probed, even though he knew exactly why. Grinning, Yang Kai continued, “It’s just that Dragon Cave Mountain is now gone, there’s no need to agonize over it.”

“But that was our home,” Wu Yi sighed deeply.

“There’s a saying that if one does not let go of the old, they will never be able to obtain the new!” Yang Kai smiled at her, “Even if Dragon Cave Mountain is gone, we have another place to settle down, and its environment is thousands of times better than Dragon Cave Mountain.”

Wu Yi and others looked over at Yang Kai suspiciously, clearly not believing him.

Although Dragon Cave Mountain had originally been just a small hill with half-decent World Energy aura density and unsuitable for long term residence, it had been transformed into a well-known cultivation paradise over the past few years that many cultivators without Sects or families were eager to join.

Unfortunately for these people, Dragon Cave Mountain never accepted outsiders and had refused all of them. If this were not the case, Dragon Cave Mountain would not have remained at its current scale and would likely be a small Sect with thousands of members already.

Yang Kai saying that they had another place to go and that it was thousands of times better than Dragon Cave Mountain naturally elicited doubt from Wu Yi and the others.

“Even the headquarters of Shadow Moon Hall couldn’t possibly be thousands of times better than Dragon Cave Mountain,” Wu Yi pouted, subconsciously thinking that Yang Kai was just trying to comfort them.

“And if that place is far superior to even Shadow Moon Hall’s headquarters?” Yang Kai looked at her with a smile. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“How could that be? If there was really such a good place out there, how could it not already be occupied by some great force? On Shadowed Star, the great Sects and other powerful forces have already occupied all the places with rich World Energy auras. How could we possibly take one for ourselves?” Chang Qi argued despondently.

“What Old Chang said is indeed correct, but the place I’m speaking of cannot be occupied by those who wish to. In fact, besides us, others who wish to even visit it are completely incapable of doing so,” Yang Kai said mysteriously, “Even if this battle had not occurred, Yang Yan and I were planning to move everyone over to the new site. This incident simply moved up our schedule so you all don’t have to feel so sorry about Dragon Cave Mountain.”

“Big Sister Yang Yan, is what he said true?” Wu Yi turned her head to Yang Yan in amazement.

Yang Yan gently nodded, indicating that what Yang Kai was saying was true. Seeing Yang Yan nod, everyone showed an astonished look.

“Where is this place? And if the environment there is so good, why is it not already occupied by some great force?” Wu Yi understood even less.

“It’s just as I said. Even if those forces want to occupy that place, they do not have the ability to,” Yang Kai smiled lightly, “Because that place is inside the Flowing Flame Sand Field!”

“Inside the Flowing Flame Sand Field!?” Wu Yi and the others exclaimed.

However, upon hearing this, the woman surnamed Ye wore a thoughtful look on her face and asked, “The Supreme Profound Sect ruins?”

“Oh? Senior actually knows about it?” Yang Kai was a little surprised. Him knowing that place was the former headquarters of the Supreme Profound Sect was because Yang Yan had told him, but this woman surnamed Ye knowing about it as well was a bit unexpected.

“Naturally, I know about it. I have seen records of it in ancient books before; after all, that was the force that Ma... the Sect that the Great Emperor formerly supported,” The woman surnamed Ye’s eyes flashed slightly as she glanced over at Yang Yan seemingly unintentionally.

“So that’s how it is,” Yang Kai gently nodded. Although he didn’t ask much about her relationship with Yang Yan, it was obvious that this woman surnamed Ye knew Yang Yan’s true identity, otherwise, it would simply be impossible for her to show so much respect towards Yang Yan with her strength and status.

It seemed that this woman knew many profound secrets.

However, it was not convenient to inquire about this right now. Yang Kai could simply ask Yang Yan about it in the future.

Meanwhile, Chang Qi and the others listened to the conversation between the woman surnamed Ye and Yang Kai and could not help showing looks of surprise. It seemed that none of them even knew there were ruins of a Sect inside the Flowing Flame Sand Field.

“You’ll understand when we arrive. For now, let us end the discussion here. Just keep monitoring the Starship’s operations. I’ve already laid the course, so we just need to maintain the current speed,” Yang Yan said lightly.

Chang Qi and others all nodded before withdrawing.

Soon, only Yang Kai, Yang Yan, the woman surnamed Ye, and Ge Qi remained in the hall.

Yang Yan shot a faint look towards the woman surnamed Ye, who instantly understood her meaning and waved to Ge Qi, “Xiao Qi, you also draw back.”

“Yes, Martial Ancestor!” Ge Qi bowed slightly before leaving the hall.

After only three people remained, Yang Yan hurriedly extended a hand to Yang Kai and said, “Show me that thing you obtained.”

Yang Kai was surprised for a moment before quickly nodded, taking out the Jade Token from his Space Ring, and tossing it over to Yang Yan. The latter caught it and after a brief examination mutter, “It really is an Emperor Jade!”

“Emperor Jade?” Yang Kai frowned, “What’s the use of this thing?”

“It’s used to resist Emperor Pressure and serves as an entry pass to the Emperor Garden. Without this, no one can enter the Emperor Garden.” Yang Yan explained quickly. “When the Emperor Garden opens, only those holding an Emperor Jade will be able to safely enter.”

“Oh? Does that mean that many of these Emperor Jades will soon appear?” Yang Kai immediately grasped the key point.

If the Emperor Garden truly opened, only one person being able to enter would clearly not make sense, and since this Emperor Jade was an entry pass, that meant there should be many Emperor Jades appearing in the near future.

“En, this piece of Emperor Jade landing on Dragon Cave Mountain ahead of time is likely related to my presence; however, more Emperor Jades will begin appearing soon,” Yang Yan frowned, seemingly thinking about something.

After a moment, she raised her and met eyes with Yang Kai, the two of them immediately understanding the other’s plans.

They needed to snatch more Emperor Jades!

No matter what, they needed to obtain more Emperor Jades; otherwise, when the Emperor Garden opened, if they didn’t possess enough entry passes, it would be impossible for Yang Kai and Yang Yan to both enter the Emperor Garden.

Moreover, there was also this woman surnamed Ye joining Dragon Cave Mountain now, so she would also need to enter the Emperor Garden. In other words, they needed at least three Emperor Jades before they could relax.

At that moment, a rumbling sound suddenly echoed from outside, breaking the silence surrounding the Starship.

Yang Kai hurriedly released his Divine Sense, and after a quick investigation, his face sank. “More Emperor Jades really are appearing.”

At the same time, the Emperor Garden directly above Dragon Cave Mountain suddenly ejected several dozen streams of light. These streams of light were white and flawless, and they seemed to be shot out without any kind of distribution or destination in mind. Their speed, however, was incredibly fast and they had all crossed the horizon in the blink of an eye.

The masters who had just evacuated from Dragon Cave Mountain were also attracted by this bizarre scene, and after a moment all hurriedly summoned their Star Shuttles to pursue these white lights.

None of them knew that these were Emperor Jades, but just because they had come from the Emperor Garden, these masters naturally did not want to miss them.

Only a lucky cultivator was simply standing still when an Emperor Jade happened to land nearby. Rushing over, this cultivator joyfully picked up this Emperor Jade, but before he had a chance to even see what it was, someone stronger arrived and immediately began fighting him for it.

Some cultivators put their all into tracking these Emperor Jades but soon lost sight of them as the latter simply flew too fast.

Still others desperately used various Secret Techniques to follow the flying Emperor Jades, determined to snatch it for themselves.

All Shadowed Star was instantly thrown into chaos as masters from all the great forces were dispatched to hunt down and obtain these Emperor Jades.

Yang Kai, Yang Yan, and the woman surnamed Ye left the Starship immediately after they noticed the emergence of these Emperor Jades. Standing outside the Starship, Yang Kai’s eyes fixed on a certain spot in the sky as a look of joy flashed across his face. One of the white beams of light just happened to be flying towards their direction.

It seemed their luck was truly quite good!

Not only did Yang Kai show a joyful look, but the woman surnamed Ye also had a face filled with smiles as she summoned an ancient-looking lamp above her head that had a terrifying blue flame burning atop it.

The Origin King Grade Bone Incinerating Flame Lamp! An artifact famous throughout Shadowed Star.

In an instant, the white light which had come from the Emperor Garden arrived within a thousand metres of the trio, and seeing that it was about to rush past them, the woman surnamed Ye stretched out her hand gracefully and tapped her Bone Incinerating Flame Lamp, sending out a burst of blue flames and condensing it into a light curtain to block this Emperor Jade’s path.

This light curtain had only just formed when the Emperor Jade ran into it and silently pierce a hole straight through it.

The woman surnamed Ye’s face changed slightly when she saw this and hurriedly sent her Saint Qi into the Bone Incinerating Flame Lamp, condensing a series of light curtains from its blue flames in the path of the Emperor Jade.

Puncturing sounds rang out one after another as the white light of this Emperor Jade displayed a terrifying power, piercing through the barriers the woman surnamed Ye set up with ease.

This time, her face changed dramatically.

Without waiting for her to act again, Yang Kai stepped up, sending out his Firebird Artifact Spirit to block this Emperor Jade.

Unfortunately, the Firebird Artifact Spirit was also unable to stop this Emperor Jade’s advance and its body collapsed the moment it came into contact with the jade.

Despite being unable to stop this Emperor Jade though, the woman surnamed Ye and Yang Kai’s efforts had still managed to slow its pace significantly.

A strange look flashed across Yang Yan’s face as her beautiful eyes lit up and she flicked her wrist lightly, transforming the crimson ring bracelet she was wearing into a ring of flames she sent out to cover the Emperor Jade.

Three Blazing Flame Rings!

This artifact belonged to the Starry Sky Great Emperor and its grade could not be understood with common sense. The Flowing Flame Sand Field was one of Shadowed Star’s Three Great Forbidden Zones yet its true form was this Three Blazing Flame Rings.

Although Yang Yan had only managed to collect a single one of these flame rings and was unable to display its full power, as an Emperor Artifact, it was not to be underestimated.

The Emperor Jade, which could not be blocked by the combination of the Bone Incinerating Flame Lamp and the Firebird Artifact Spirit, seemed to encounter its nemesis the moment it came into contact with this flame ring and halted mid-air. The flame ring then quickly shrank and wrapped up the Emperor Jade tightly.

A buzzing sound rang out as the Emperor Jade seemingly tried to escape from the Three Blazing Flame Rings’ suppression, but having already been caught, how could it be so easy to flee?

Yang Yan quickly poured her Saint Qi into the Three Blazing Flame Rings and bound this Emperor Jade tightly, decisively capturing it.
