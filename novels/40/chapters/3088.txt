“Why are you standing here?” Upon learning that this woman was the Head Manager of the Fierce Gale Pirates, Lu Huai Shuang stored her azure longsword and curbed her hostility.

“Sir is taking a bath now. I’m a woman, so it’s not appropriate for me to stay inside.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Oh?” Lu Huai Shuang nodded and stood to the side, as she didn’t dare to knock on the door.

The place fell into silence for a moment as He Yun Xiang was still putting on make-up. All of a sudden, she hurled the rouge box away in exasperation and reached out her hand, upon which a crystal clear water ball appeared on her palm.

After removing the make-up with the water ball, she was then seen with her natural countenance. Then, she let out a breath and uttered, “Forget it.” She looked as though she was resigned to her fate, and that she was heading to the execution ground.

Lu Huai Shuang commented, “You look beautiful in your natural state.”

“You think so too?” He Yun Xiang suddenly found this Young Lady from the Lu Family amiable. Then, she sized her up and compared herself to her. [We’re both beautiful in our own ways, so we’re equally matched in this regard. However, our temperaments are starkly different. I wonder if Sir prefers seductive or elegant ladies. As for our figures…]

She then took a glance at Lu Huai Shuang’s chest, upon which she felt very proud of her own figure.

“What are you looking at?” Noticing her stare, Lu Huai Shuang appeared awkward. Then, she lamented in her heart, [What did she eat when she was growing up? How did she manage to make them so big?]

All of a sudden, the door opened silently. The ladies traded glances and turned solemn.

He Yun Xiang crossed her arms lightly to emphasize her bosom, making the deep valley between her mountains appear all the more profound and mysterious before she sashayed into the room.

Lu Huai Shuang was struck speechless. Still, she checked her appearance to make sure it was in order before she too stepped into the room.

“Sir!” He Yun Xiang approached Yang Kai and bowed her head in an attempt to showcase her assets.

Yang Kai nodded without even batting an eye. Apparently, he knew that she had turned back into her original form, so he wasn’t surprised at all.

“Senior!” Lu Huai Shuang performed a salute as well, but in a more restrained manner.

“Have a seat. There’s something I need to ask you two.” Yang Kai beckoned with his hand.

He Yun Xiang covered her mouth and giggled, “There’s no need for Sir to be so polite with us. Please just ask whatever you wish to. I’ll be sure to tell you everything I know.”

Lu Huai Shuang shot her a strange glance as this was the first time she witnessed someone playing up to a person in power so deftly.

“Sir, do you need me to help tie your hair?” He Yun Xiang gazed at Yang Kai’s shoulder-length hair and offered to help, “I’m fairly confident in my skills.”

“Good, then please do.” Yang Kai flashed a light smile at her.

“Pardon me then,” He Yun Xiang immediately moved behind him and summoned a comb into her hand before she got to work. At that moment, she looked like an obedient woman who had just gotten married.

Seeing that, Lu Huai Shuang moved her hand suddenly, upon which a complete tea set appeared on the table. Then, she took some Spirit Spring Water and started boiling it in a meticulous manner. She couldn’t make those seductive moves like what He Yun Xiang had done, so she thought she could start with making tea. Fortunately, she had mastered the art of tea since young, so she was skilful in this field. Her movements were so elegant that anyone would be mesmerized when watching her.

Soon, the aroma of tea permeated the room.

He Yun Xiang never stopped what she was doing as she asked, “Is that Spirit Mist Tea from Cloud Mountain?”

Lu Huai Shuang replied, “It appears Head Manager has broad knowledge and sharp vision.”

With a smile, He Yun Xiang said, “It’s not that I have sharp vision, but rather that this tea is truly famous. It’s thanks to Sir that I’m able to have a taste of one of the top three teas of the Star Field.”

Yang Kai just continued smiling lightly without uttering a word, which made Lu Huai Shuang feel dejected. It cost the Lu Family a hefty price to obtain this tea, and she only had a small sachet of it. Normally, the Lu Family wouldn’t even consider drinking it, but it seemed that even with this tea she couldn’t obtain the results she was hoping for.

After giving it a thought though, she reckoned that if Yang Kai really came from ‘that’ place, then this top tea in Unending Star Field might not even be good enough for him to moisten his throat. With this thought in mind, she pulled herself together and continued steeping the tea in a serious manner.

When the tea was ready, Lu Huai Shuang filled one cup with it and pushed it towards Yang Kai in a respectful manner, “Senior, please.”

Yang Kai nodded and directly picked it up to take a sip. After allowing the taste to linger on his tongue for a moment, he gulped it down and nodded, “Very good indeed!”

For a Lower Star Field, this tea was indeed quite good.

Upon receiving his praise, Lu Huai Shuang finally put on a smile.

“You should take a seat as well,” Yang Kai turned his head and said to He Yun Xiang. Although his hair had been tied, she didn’t take a seat immediately. Instead, she stood to his side.

“Yes,” Only then did He Yun Xiang take a seat with a smile without appearing uneasy.

After having three rounds of tea, Yang Kai suddenly spoke up, “There’s something I need to ask you two.”

The ladies put down their teacups at the same time and straightened up.

“Is Unending Star Field connected to other Star Fields?”

Upon hearing that, they shook their heads at the same time.

In an instant, Yang Kai’s heart sank, but he still asked, “Are you sure it’s not?”

He didn’t think these women would lie to him, but the answer was truly disappointing.

Lu Huai Shuang replied, “Senior, as far as I know, we have no direct contact with other Star Fields.”

Realizing something upon hearing Yang Kai’s words, He Yun Xiang asked carefully, “Sir, do you want to go to another Star Field?”

Yang Kai replied, “En.”

He Yun Xiang uttered curiously, “Then, why didn’t you go to your desired Star Field through the Ancestral Domain? Why did you come here instead?”

Yang Kai stared at her blankly and asked, “What is the Ancestral Domain?”

He Yun Xiang batted her eyes, “Sir, aren’t you from the Ancestral Domain?”

“I have never heard of it before.”

Lu Huai Shuang’s jaw dropped slightly as she took a look at He Yun Xiang. Both of them could see the shock behind each other’s gaze.

[How can this be? If he isn’t from the Ancestral Domain, why does he have such powerful cultivation?] They had always believed that Yang Kai came from the Ancestral Domain, but this speculation turned out to be wrong.

Both of the ladies were dumbfounded. If he wasn’t from the Ancestral Domain, why was he repelled by the Heavenly Way? How did he manage to kill two Origin King Realm Masters with ease?

“Sir, I’m sorry, but could you inform us where you hail from?” He Yun Xiang looked dazedly at him.

After hesitating for a bit, Yang Kai replied, “The Star Boundary.”

“The Star Boundary?” The ladies were puzzled.

It was Yang Kai who was shocked this time, “You’ve never heard of it before?”

He Yun Xiang and Lu Huai Shuang shook their heads at the same time. At that instant, they found it a little funny, as they didn’t seem to understand what the other person was saying. It was as though they were talking past each other entirely.

“Alright. I guess you can’t go to the Star Boundary from here. It’s not like there isn’t such a precedent.” Yang Kai thought of a possibility. Many Star Fields were completely sealed off, so not all cultivators could head to the Star Boundary from their own Star Fields. Unending Star Field must be one such example.

“We have never heard of the Star Boundary, but we can go to the Ancestral Domain from Unending Star Field,” Lu Huai Shuang explained.

“What is the Ancestral Domain?” Yang Kai’s interest was piqued as they kept mentioning this place.

“The Ancestral Domain is the ancestral land of all Star Fields!” He Yun Xiang wouldn’t let go of this chance to leave a good impression on Yang Kai, so she started explaining it to him before Lu Huai Shuang could, “There are countless Planes in this boundless universe, as well as innumerable Star Fields. However, have you ever wondered how these Star Fields were born?”

“No.”

He Yun Xiang smiled and waved her hand, upon which the World Energy in front of her surged and turned into a washbasin-sized orb. She pointed at this World Energy Orb and uttered, “This is the Ancestral Domain, where the Heavens and Earth were born!”

Yang Kai nodded and motioned for her to go on.

He Yun Xiang waved her hand again, upon which some streams of World Energy separated from the orb and stretched out. While using her technique, she explained, “No one knows what happened when the universe was born, but in the early days of the Heavens and Earth, a certain Plane was formed, a Star Field.” As she waved her hand, those streams of World Energy formed into fist-sized orbs and hovered around the first orb.

Then, she moved her hand again, after which more and more World Energy orbs appeared. In just a short moment, countless World Energy orbs floated in the air. They came in different sizes and levels of brightness. Their proximity with the first World Energy Orb varied too.

Some World Energy orbs would burst, but at the same time, more World Energy orbs would be born. However, none of these World Energy Orbs was comparable to the first one.

Upon realizing what she was trying to convey, Yang Kai exclaimed, “Fascinating!”

If that was the case, how was Star Boundary born, then? What was the position the Star Boundary occupied in this amazing theory?

He Yun Xiang went on to explain, “Although the countless Star Fields are not interconnected, they’re all somewhat related to the Ancestral Domain. I heard that some Star Fields are closer to the Ancestral Domain, and when cultivators from those Star Fields reach a certain level of strength, they can head to Ancestral Domain to pursue a higher Martial Dao.”

Lu Huai Shuang then added, “That’s why we all believed Senior was from the Ancestral Domain.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “I’ve never been there, nor have I heard of this place before.” He paused for a moment, “Can we go to the Ancestral Domain from Unending Star Field, then?”

Since that was the case, he might still have a chance to return to Heng Luo Star Field, as he could just regard Ancestral Domain as a terminal. According to He Yun Xiang, all Star Fields were related to the Ancestral Domain, so it must be the same for Heng Luo Star Field as well.

“Yes, we can.” He Yun Xiang forced a smile, “But we don’t know where the entrance is.”

“Have none of the Masters in Unending Star Field headed to the Ancestral Domain before?”

“There were some who travelled to the Ancestral Domain.” Lu Huai Shuang nodded in a solemn manner. Only the top Masters could enter the Ancestral Domain, and only people like them had the right to survive and prosper in that place. Although the two ladies were both Origin Kings, they did not yet stand at the peak of the Star Field, so they didn’t know how to go there.

“Those who have entered the Ancestral Domain have never returned, so we’re guessing that there may be no way back to our Star Field from there.”

Her speculation was sensible, but Yang Kai thought that the main reason was the Heavenly Way’s rejection. Also, those people might not be interested in returning to a Lower Star Field anymore after they obtained even stronger power.

It was the same for himself. If possible, he wouldn’t want to go to any Star Field, as he would rather stay in Star Boundary to further his cultivation.
