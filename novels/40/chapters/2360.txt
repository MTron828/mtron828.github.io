If one were able to look down at the Solitary Void Mountain Range from a high altitude, they would see that it was currently spinning madly like a vortex. And, with a certain point as its centre, the entire Solitary Void Mountain Range looked as a huge funnel with powerful suction force coming from the centre, affecting every living thing within it.

Countless fleeing birds and other beasts were being sucked into the centre of that funnel-shaped vortex, disappearing in just the blink of an eye. Meanwhile, even more creatures and cultivators training and foraging for resources exploded into a bloody mist devoid of even bones.

The cultivators who were lucky enough to be moving about at the outer region were not as unlucky. They were fortunate enough to escape as soon as the changes began to happen, but when they looked back, all of them were pale, their hearts palpitating.

Many of them had no idea what was going on, but some knew about the infamous Solitary Void Great Maelstrom. Word spread and soon, everyone found out about this chaotic event. While they marvelled at the horrors of nature, they were also filled with anticipation.

That was because the Solitary Void Mountain Range would be reshaped every time the Solitary Void Great Maelstrom appeared, and the precious treasures that were originally in the depths of the Solitary Void Mountain Range would flow to the outer region.

In other words, once the Solitary Void Mountain Range’s movements came to a halt, a large number of precious treasures would appear outside, so how could they not look forward to it?

“I seemed to have seen Sir City Lord enter the Solitary Void Mountain Range’s depths, but I have no idea if it was just my eyes.”

“No, you’re right. I saw him too. The City Lord seemed to be in a hurry, as if he’s chasing after someone.”

“He’s in trouble now. We don’t even know if Sir City Lord can return safely.”

“The chances are not great, the depths of the Solitary Void Mountain Range are extremely dangerous. Even if the City Lord is an Emperor Realm Master, he still won’t be safe if he goes in too deep, and to have met with the Solitary Void Great Maelstrom as well, I’m afraid things aren’t looking too good!”

Many cultivators gathered around the far side of the Solitary Void Mountain Range, engaged in fervent discussion. If Pang Guang really was lost to the Solitary Void Mountain Range, then the great forces of Marsh City would have to be reshuffled again. This was not bad news for many people. For a while, joyful emotions were mixed with the sad in a complicated mix.

Meanwhile, in the depths of the Solitary Void Mountain Range, Yang Kai was protecting Liu Xian Yun and struggling to resist the terrifying suction force coming from the vortex. His clothes had been ripped into tatters from the force and cuts formed on his skin, drenching him in blood and turning him into a sorry state.

He had no idea where this suction force came from or what was creating it, but the more he tried to resist it, the more terrifying it became. The force on top of Yang Kai was getting harder and harder for him to bear.

If not for his intrepid physique, Yang Kai would have already burst apart and died just like everything else.

“Senior Brother, don’t worry about me and just run.” Liu Xian Yun was also struggling, but she was in a better situation than Yang Kai since he was protecting her. Seeing him like this now, she felt guilty and knew that she was dragging Yang Kai down.

As she said that, she lowered her feet to the ground, about to move away from Yang Kai.

But Yang Kai caught her with his arms and shook his head, “Don’t worry, I’ll tell you if I really can’t hold on any longer.”

Even in a life or death situation, he did not give up on her, filling Liu Xian Yun’s heart with warmth and moving her greatly. It was easy to find a friend who would share your wealth, but difficult to find a friend willing to face danger with you. The best time to find out a person’s character was during a crisis.

Liu Xian Yun felt that the luckiest thing to happen to her in this lifetime was meeting Yang Kai in the Star Boundary.

She had completely given up resisting and revealed a sad smile, “Senior Brother, take care of yourself in the future!”

“What are you doing?!” Yang Kai’s face changed. He could sense her intentions and quickly shouted, “Don’t give up, I have another way!”

Liu Xian Yun slowly shook her head, allowing herself to be taken away by the terrifying force.

Yang Kai was incredibly anxious. He knew that Liu Xian Yun was determined not to drag him down anymore and was going to toss aside everything else in order to throw her into the Sealed World Bead when Liu Xian Yun’s face suddenly changed. The expression on her face was one of pure confusion.

But in the next moment, she exclaimed, “Senior Brother, stop resisting! If you don’t, there is no danger at all.”

Hearing her say that, Yang Kai looked carefully and found that sure enough, Liu Xian Yun wasn’t being hurt at all, so he knew she was right. He quickly dispersed the energy around his body and allowed the terrifying suction force to envelop him.

The force originally suppressing him and causing great damage to his body was gone in an instant.

Indeed, it was as Liu Xian Yun said. The more one resisted here, the more uncomfortable it became.

But if any average person were to encounter this situation, who would not try to resist? They would definitely be desperate to escape, and once they started struggling, they would not be too far from death.

After giving up on resisting, the powerful suction force swept up both Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun, quickly drawing them to the centre of the Solitary Void Mountain Range. The turbulent force made Yang Kai feel as if he were a lone boat in the middle of a stormy sea, in danger of capsizing at any moment.

“Senior Brother, look!” Liu Xian Yun, whose body was being held tightly by Yang Kai and did not mind that her tall peaks were being squeezed out of shape by his arms, suddenly let out a cry of surprise.

When Yang Kai turned over to look, his face turned dark as well. He discovered that there was an enormous dark funnel right in front of them where the suction force was coming from. In its vicinity, the earth could be seen spinning and tumbling as countless birds and beasts were sucked in, their fates unknown.

He wanted to release his Divine Sense to investigate the situation inside, but it shattered as soon as it left his body, causing his Knowledge Sea to throb. He didn’t dare to try this a second time.

Liu Xian Yun was also becoming more and more nervous, her tender body quivering like a shaking quail without a nest in winter. She had no idea what their fates would be if they were sucked into that vortex. She had not been in the Star Boundary for long, so she was naturally unwilling to die like this.

Looking up at Yang Kai though, she found that despite his expression looking grave, he wasn’t panicked in the slightest.

That helped to ease her up considerably. Even if she died, she felt that it would not be a bad thing if she were able to die together with Yang Kai. Considering all this, her body suddenly eased up a lot.

“Protect yourself.” Yang Kai lightly patted Liu Xian Yun’s back.

As soon as he said this, both he and Liu Xian Yun were sucked into the vortex. All of a sudden, a dizzy feeling washed over him, disorienting him as the entire world turned dark without the slightest hint of light.

Yang Kai felt his body spinning and falling as if the vortex was a bottomless pit, a fearful and unsettled feeling.

But Yang Kai was slightly reassured by the fact that this fall did not prove to be dangerous.

Liu Xian Yun hugged him even tighter, her body turning as stiff as a block of wood.

None of them knew how long it had been, but Yang Kai suddenly saw a glimmer of light up ahead; however, under the power of the vortex, he was unable to probe ahead and see the situation around them.

*Peng...*

A large noise erupted and Yang Kai felt great pain all over his body. It was as if his entire being was going to break apart; however, he was surprised to find that he had actually landed on solid ground at this moment, and that spinning force that enveloped his body had also disappeared. Now there was just a lot of ear-splitting noises coming from around him.

*Peng peng peng...*

Things were constantly crash-landing around them, some even splashed onto them. From the smell, it seemed to be bits of dirt mixed with bodily remains and smelled extremely bad.

Yang Kai did not dare to move about recklessly lest something bad were to happen. He carefully pushed his Source Qi in order to protect Liu Xian Yun and himself and found that his Source Qi was working freely. The strange backlash earlier from the inexplicable suction force had disappeared, relieving him greatly.

Liu Xian Yun seemed unconscious and wasn’t moving in the slightest. However, from the smooth flow of her breathing and her steady aura, it was clear she did not suffer any great harm.

After a full hour, their surroundings finally settled down. Yang Kai waited a little while longer to ensure there weren’t any dangers before pushing out his Source Qi, blasting away all the mud and debris that were covering him and rising up from the mound.

He landed lightly and checked Liu Xian Yun’s condition first, discovering that she was in fact unconscious. Only then did he begin taking in his surroundings.

At this first glance, Yang Kai was dumbfounded.

He discovered that he was actually atop an island at the moment.

The island was not very big, only a few kilometres in circumference, and looking at the colour of the land and some of the debris, it was clear that this island had just been formed.

That was because the soil here was exactly the same as the soil from the Solitary Void Mountain Range’s depths, and there were also chunks of blood and flesh left by various creatures around the island, causing the ground to appear a bizarre crimson colour.

This island must have formed because of the changes in the Solitary Void Mountain Range. That vortex-like power actually brought the earth from the Solitary Void Mountain Range here and formed an island!

All around the island was an endless sea with rough waves.

But what shocked Yang Kai even more was the appearance of strange waterspouts on the surface of the sea. The pillars of water sprung up from the surface of the sea, reaching into the clouds, merging Heaven and Earth in a magnificent sight!

There were countless waterspouts on the surface of the sea of all different sizes; however, each one emitted a very strong suction power that gave off a dangerous feeling.

They were not stationary but rather moving constantly, their speed varying from fast to slow with a great difference. There were even waterspouts moving as fast as lightning, passing by Yang Kai’s field of vision while lifting up huge waves. Their destructive power was astonishing.

He felt the World Energy around him, which was extremely dense; however, Yang Kai could sense that the World Energy here was different from other places, but he couldn’t tell what about it was different.

What is this damned place?

How did they get here after entering that maelstrom in the Solitary Void Mountain Range’s depths?

It was simply impossible to say that this was under the Solitary Void Mountain Range as well; after all, this place looked so vast and presented itself as an ocean. How could this possibly be underneath the Solitary Void Mountain Range?

Could this be a Sealed World? Yang Kai was shocked.

But the more he thought about it, the more it made sense. When he was swallowed up by that vortex, Yang Kai could clearly feel traces of Space Principles, so that huge vortex was most likely the entrance to this Sealed World!

If this was a Sealed World, then things would be troublesome. How was he going to find the exit in this vast ocean?
