Chapter 5453: Compensate

With Fu Guang’s help, the Remnant Army led by Yang Kai escaped its immediate crisis. A large Human army in the distance also noticed the commotion and was quickly making their way over to support them.

With a thought, Yang Kai sent a transmission to Ou Yang Lie and the others, “I’ll leave the rest to you.”

Ou Yang Lie, who was bringing up the rear, was startled and quickly asked, “What are you going to do?”

However, Yang Kai was no longer aboard the Purifying Black Ink Battleship when he looked over. Apparently, he had disappeared as soon as he left those words.

Ou Yang Lie frowned slightly. He could vaguely guess what it was Yang Kai planned to do. He was a little worried about it, but there was no point in fretting now. Yang Kai had already run off and he could not stop him either. Helpless, he had no choice but to hurry over to assume command of the Purifying Black Ink Battleship in Yang Kai’s place, continuing to lead the Remnant Army towards the approaching Human Army.

After killing several Black Ink Clansmen who were blocking the way, the two Human Armies met and the Eighth-Order Masters in charge communicated with each other through their Divine Senses. The Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was both surprised and delighted to hear of Ou Yang Lie’s retelling of the Remnant Army’s origins.

Everyone knew that there were survivors still trapped on the Black Ink Battlefield, but they couldn’t rescue those remnant soldiers. They never thought that these rag-tag soldiers they believed were destined to perish under siege by the Black Ink Clan would actually be able to break through the No-Return Pass.

Only now could the Remnant Army be considered safe, unlike the precarious situation they were facing before.

Looking back, Ou Yang Lie did not see any sign of Yang Kai, but he knew he must have headed back towards the Territory Gate.

At the same time, on another battlefield far away in the Barren Territory, several women were positioned in a Battle Formation, their graceful bodies shuttling back and forth like a spinning whirlwind, a seemingly uncountable number of Black Ink Clansmen perishing at their hands as they continued charging forward.

Their strength wasn’t particularly impressive, all of them only being in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm; however, after spending countless years together, they had created a tacit bond with each other and were also imparted a profound Formation from a Senior Expert, allowing them to even resist Territory Lords if they combined strength.

One white-robed woman among them wielded a crystal sword, her own temperament cool like ice itself. Suddenly, she raised her hand, holding her chest as she looked in a certain direction.

“Elder Sister, what happened?” Asked a woman in green robes anxiously, thinking that the white-robed woman was injured.

“Husband…” The white-robed woman muttered softly.

In that instant, she got a feeling she had not felt in a very long time.

It had been more than 1,000 years since she felt it, but it pulled at her heart just as before.

Though her voice was soft, the contents of her muttering cracked like the sound of thunder in their ears. All the women looked shocked, and the beautiful eyes of one whose enchanting body was covered in Demon Qi lit up at the sound of it, “Which direction?”

The white-robed woman immediately pointed to the depths of the void.

“Let’s go!” As the Demonic woman’s voice sounded, she led the others off. She served as the Formation Core of their Battle Formation, so as soon as she moved, everyone followed along with her.

All of their hearts were burning with anticipation and anxiety.

The unnatural movement on their side immediately caught the attention of a certain person.

That person moved over to block the womens’ path, frowning, “What are you doing? It’s dangerous over there.”

Each group had its own region to defend, so if they left and were unable to obtain reinforcements, then there was a high possibility of them falling into the danger of being encircled by the Black Ink Clan Army.

The Demonic woman in the lead gave this person who was blocking their way a deep look before not sparing her any semblance of respect as she gritted her teeth and shouted, “He has returned!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Who?” The person blocking the way asked with a frown; then, as if realising something, her spirits were roused, “Yang Kai has returned?”

“Yes!” The Demonic woman responded.

The person blocking their path was both shocked and delighted, “How did you find out?”

Even she had no idea of the full situation on this chaotic battlefield, so how did these women obtain such shocking news?

What was more, she and the other Old Ancestors had already speculated that Yang Kai had fallen; after all, there was no word from him for over 500 years after he was pursued by the powerful Royal Lord, so how could he have survived?

It was only after returning to the Barren Territory and obtaining some information from the members of Void Land that they concluded that Yang Kai was actually still alive. Only, nobody knew where he was.

The Demonic woman had no patience to explain; however, she knew that she had no choice but to do so at this moment, “He and Su Yan have cultivated a profound Dual Cultivation Art for many years, so they have formed a connection between their Souls. It allows them to sense each other as long as they are not too far away.”

The person blocking the way immediately turned towards the white-robed woman and asked, “You felt his presence?”

Su Yan nodded and pointed in a certain direction, but just as she was about to speak, she suddenly frowned, “He’s gone again!”

The Demonic woman was furious and ground her teeth at the person who was blocking their way, “If it turns out you made us lose our man again, you must compensate us!”

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

She had heard similar words many times over the past few centuries, despite her being a powerful Ninth-Order Old Ancestor. She had spent countless years overseeing the Black Ink Battlefield, rendering meritorious service. All of her Juniors and subordinates always treated her with the utmost respect, but this woman from the Demon Race showed no such inclination. When she learned that Yang Kai had been serving under her all this while for so many years but ended up missing, she made a huge uproar about making her compensate for this.

But, what kind of compensation could she possibly offer? She did not even have the slightest idea where Yang Kai was.

The battle on the Barren Territory was currently raging. The Human soldiers from the Great Passes had suffered heavy casualties; so, after retreating to the Barren Territory, they had a discussion with the Cave Heavens and Paradises and decided to recruit soldiers from the Second Class forces to form a new Army to bolster their ranks.

There were countless Second Class forces in the 3,000 Worlds, and there were many Masters among these great forces who were in the Fifth and Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. All of them were qualified to join the battle against the Black Ink Clan.

In the past, these Second Class forces were kept from this war because the Cave Heavens and Paradises were there to oversee the Black Ink Battlefield.

Now that the Black Ink Battlefield had been lost to the enemy, the Barren Territory had become their last line of defence. If they failed to defend even here, then the 3,000 Worlds were doomed.

Facing such a crisis, the Cave Heavens and Paradises had to abandon their old conventions.

Void Land was also considered a Second Class great force; so naturally, it was unavoidable that some of them would be conscripted.

With her connection to Yang Kai, Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao took command of Void Land’s Open Heaven Realm Masters, intending to shelter them as best she could.

Yet, she never expected that this Wife of Yang Kai’s would be so bold.

Even more difficult for Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao to understand was how much of a womaniser that little bastard actually was. To have attracted so many women to his side, yet all of them were so attached to him, Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao was stupefied, but more so, impressed.

To be honest, when Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao found out that Yang Kai’s Wives, plural, were coming to the Barren Territory to join the fight, she was quite surprised. Without thinking much of it, she immediately took the reinforcements sent from Void Land under her wing.

However, when these alluring women came to report to her, Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao was flabbergasted.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5… There were a total of 9 women!

Human, Demon, Monster, Divine Spirits… A variety of Races were included among them.

[That brat! He is truly uninhibited! How was he able to bear such a load?]

But what made Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao even more speechless was the fact that apart from the 9 Wives who had already married him officially, there seemed to be a good many women still back in Void Land who shared an ambiguous relationship with him.

At first, Old Ancestor thought that there must have been a mistake, but upon closer questioning, she realized that there was no mistake at all.

She suddenly felt as if her understanding of Yang Kai was lacking.

That brat gave the impression of an upstanding and earnest man all those years on the Black Ink Battlefield. She had never seen any semblance of such philandering from him. Even Feng Ying and Bai Yi, two women of exceptional beauty and strength, who were in his Squad, were only regular comrades to him.

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao could not help but criticize him inwardly. Sure enough, one cannot judge a book by its cover! If one were to peel back that bastard’s prim and proper skin, then one would surely find a flowery bunch of innards inside.

“Compensate us!” The Demonic woman was still shouting, while the other women wore indignant expressions on their faces.

Helpless, Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao turned her head and looked in that direction. After some thought, she turned to ask Su Yan, “Could there be any mistake with your senses?”

Su Yan replied coldly, “I have never been mistaken.”

“In that case, what would the sudden loss of that sensation imply?” Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao then asked.

Su Yan explained, “He has either died or left the range of our connection. I cannot sense him across Great Territories or over extremely large distances. However, my cultivation is now far higher than it was before. As long as he remains in the Barren Territory, I should be able to sense him.”

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao nodded, “That direction is where the Territory Gate is located. He must have fought his way here from the Black ink Battlefield. Since you lost the connection, then he must have gone back. I will go and check it out. None of you are allowed to make any rash moves while I am gone.”

Saying so, she dashed off in that direction.

The women were left to look at each other, not knowing what to do.

Xue Yue looked at Yu Ru Meng, “Elder Sister, what should we do?”

Yu Ru Meng’s face was gloomy for a while before she grit her teeth and shouted, “We wait!”

Just now, she had been too agitated and was about to lead her Sisters over in the heat of the moment, but even though they were no longer as weak as they were in the past, it was still not wise for them to run around on such a chaotic battlefield.

All these years, they never knew what happened to Yang Kai until the Human Race Army retreated to the Barren Territory. Only then did they hear about Yang Kai from some of the soldiers who fought alongside him.

All of them were heartbroken and wished for nothing more than to fight side by side with their Husband.

Now that their Husband had finally returned, as the Eldest Sister, Yu Ru Meng would not be able to explain to Yang Kai if anything were to happen to any of them.

Even though she wanted to rush over to see what the situation was herself, she had no choice but to resist that urge. Clenching her fists, she led the others towards a group of Black Ink Clansmen, venting their endless rage on them. The Black Ink Clansmen that they fought were filled with grievances, wondering just what had come over these madwomen for them to act so viciously.

On the other side, Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao transformed into a stream of light that swept across half of the battlefield, heading straight for the Territory Gate.

Her ostentatiousness naturally attracted the attention of many Royal Lords.

Neither the Old Ancestors nor the Royal Lords would move casually on this battlefield, forming a kind of mutual restraint towards each other.

A rash move from either side could precipitate a major battle.

However, Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao couldn’t care less about the bigger picture at this moment. Frankly, she blamed herself for losing Yang Kai, and she had been feeling guilty about it all these years.

However, with so many soldiers dying on the battlefield, she had no way of protecting all of them even if she was in the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

There was no helping it if there was no news of Yang Kai, but now that she had a solid lead, she naturally wanted to look into it.

Before Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao could reach the Territory Gate though, a Royal Lord swooped in to stop her. Naturally, the two of them promptly engaged in a shocking battle.
