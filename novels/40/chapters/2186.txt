“All of you flatter me too much, I just happen to know a little something about this spirit flower, that is all,” Lan Xun responded modestly, without any arrogance or complacency after being showered with praise, her tone calm and steady. At this point, her beautiful eyes turned to the budding lotus flower and with a solemn expression, she quickly said, “If I am not mistaken, this spirit flower is... the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus!”

Hearing this, Yang Kai raised his brow and couldn’t help silently praising Lan Xun for her extraordinary breadth of knowledge.

If he hadn’t obtained Gong Sun Mu’s jade slip, it would have been impossible for him to recognize the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus. In this world, there weren’t many who could recognize this kind of spirit flower or know its effects.

“As I thought!” Zhuang Bu Fan gently nodded to the side. It seemed that he too had guessed this before, but was uncertain until after he heard confirmation from Lan Xun.

Among the crowd of onlookers, most still had blank expressions while only a few had drastic changes on their faces after hearing the words ‘Extraordinary Treasure Lotus’, apparently having at least some knowledge about it.

“Princess, what exactly is this Extraordinary Treasure Lotus good for? Can we eat it?” Xia Sheng suddenly asked with a smile on his face.

“You moron!” To the side, Xiao Bai Yi face-palmed as he shook his head, ashamed of Xia Sheng outburst as he muttered, “If you don’t know anything, don’t speak. The Temple’s face is always being completely lost by your shamelessness.”

Murong Xiao Xiao also blushed and nodded vigorously, seemingly trying to distance herself from Xia Sheng.

The performance of their Eldest Senior Brother really embarrassed the two of them.

“Xiao Bai, do you know something?” Xia Sheng immediately turned his head towards Xiao Bai Yi before clapping his hands, “Right, in the Temple, you would always read a lot of old books, so maybe you do know something! Quickly tell me about this... what was it... Extraordinary Treasure Lotus! Right, what kind of mythical effects does it have?”

Xiao Bai Yi stared at him fixedly before taking a deep breath to calm his mood and slowly speaking, “The Extraordinary Treasure Lotus is born from the pure essence of the Sun, Moon, and Earth, a supreme treasure that appears only randomly throughout history in all different kinds of environments. There are no specific conditions for its appearance or growth and it can appear anywhere, whether there is rich World Energy or none at all. However... in this world there will only ever be a single Extraordinary Treasure Lotus in existence at any one time. If one appears, another will not appear until the first disappears...”

Upon hearing this, Xia Sheng couldn’t help blowing a whistle as he said in surprise, “It’s really precious then...”

Xiao Bai Yi ignored him and continued, “As for its function, it has an astonishing benefit for cultivators like us. It can permanently increase the chances of one breaking through to the Emperor Realm without any side effects or drawbacks! In other words, if you, Wu Chang, or Brother Zhuang were to refine this Extraordinary Treasure Lotus, you would be able to break through to the Emperor Realm in less than five years! As for someone like me... ten years would suffice!”

“I am here as well!” Xiao Chen was ignored by Xiao Bai Yi and clearly felt unpleasant.

Xia Sheng, however, just grinned and said, “Even without this thing, I can still break through to the Emperor Realm. It doesn’t seem that precious to me!”

“What do you know?” Xiao Bai Yi glanced at him coldly, “Throughout the ages, countless geniuses like you have tried to break through to the Emperor Realm, only to fail at the last moment or become stuck at the final hurdle, unable to cross it for the rest of their lives. Furthermore! In this world, no one dares to claim that they can absolutely break through to the Emperor Realm, and those who do often end up failing. Of course, there are others out there who have lesser aptitude and talent, but through pure hard work and effort manage to reach the Emperor Realm... But to all cultivators like us, the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus is akin to a guarantee of breaking through to the Emperor Realm!”

When Xia Sheng heard Xiao Bai Yi’s explanation, he couldn’t find anything to object about and immediately sank into contemplation.

All around, the cultivators who were watching and waiting heard Xiao Bai Yi’s explanation and showed fiery looks on their faces. They now looked at this Extraordinary Treasure Lotus not as some special spirit flower, but as a broad and clear path to the Emperor Realm!

The cultivators that entered the Four Seasons Realm were all in the Dao Source Realm, and many of them had reached the Third-Order. These cultivators were just a few steps away from the Emperor Realm, so with such a huge opportunity appearing before them, how could they not be tempted?

If it weren’t for the top Sect’s Masters all standing by acting as a deterrent, someone by now would not have been able to hold back and run up to snatch this lotus, leading to this mountain top turning into a chaotic battlefield filled with blood!

In front of such a precious spirit flower, no one would be able to keep their calm. Once greed took over, even fellow brothers from the same force would trample each other to obtain this prize!

“I understand the preciousness and purpose of this Extraordinary Treasure Lotus now, but... Princess has yet to explain why she prevented me from obtaining it just now,” Wu Chang suddenly said coldly, seemingly still hung up on the fact that Lan Xun had stopped him from touching it a moment ago and demanding a satisfactory explanation.

Lan Xun smiled slightly and said, “Brother Xiao Bai has already explained much, so Junior Sister will be succinct.”

On the other side, Xiao Bai Yi’s mouth twitched as he felt a deep sadness in his heart, thinking that the name ‘Xiao Bai’ could not be erased for a lifetime. Even someone as famous and respected as Princess Lan Xun was now calling him by that name, so it was basically set in stone. With tears forming at the corners of his eyes, Xiao Bai Yi lifted his head towards the Heavens and silently asked just what he had done to deserve such a cruel fate...

Meanwhile, Lan Xun continued to speak, “Although the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus is extremely precious, it is fundamentally still just a spirit flower, so it is quite delicate and fragile. Right now, this Extraordinary Treasure Lotus has yet to mature, so its medicinal efficacies have not yet fermented. If Brother Wu Chang had rashly picked it just now, its medicinal properties would definitely be greatly damaged and it would lose all of its Heaven-defying effects. I believe Brother Wu Chang would not want to see that happen, right?”

With her last sentence, she turned to Wu Chang with a smile and asked.

Wu Chang heard this and responded in a cold, flat tone, “Since your Highness has said so, I will wait... but I must ask, how long will it be until this Extraordinary Treasure Lotus fully matures?”

Lan Xun went silent for a while as she observed the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus before saying, “It should be a day or so!”

“Just before the exit closes...” Wu Chang muttered to himself before immediately shouting, “Fine, then I will wait until then. Before the time comes, if anyone dares have ideas about this Extraordinary Treasure Lotus idea, don’t blame this Wu for not showing mercy!”

As he spoke, he turned his gaze around, a strange red and white light flashing from his eyes, causing those who met them to shudder.

Hearing this, Yang Kai couldn’t help breathing a sigh of relief...

Although Wu Chang wanted to take the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus for himself, his declaration just now had also calmed all the waves and guaranteed that before this spirit flower matured, no one would act recklessly. As for afterwards, everyone would need to rely on their own methods in the scramble for the prize.

“Junior Sister would also like to request everyone wait until after this Extraordinary Treasure Lotus matures before asking,” Lan Xun said sternly, “I should also inform everyone that... after this Extraordinary Treasure Lotus does mature, if it is not consumed within three hours, or refined into a pill, its medicinal efficacies will pass completely!”

“Is that true?” Wu Chang frowned.

“The Extraordinary Treasure Lotus is a Heaven defying treasure after all, so with such effects, the Heavenly Way puts appropriate constraints on its birth and life!” Lan Xun smiled slightly.

“Then it’s simple. When it matures, I just need to eat it!” Xia Sheng grinned.

Xiao Bai Yi turned his head, glanced at him coldly, and snapped, “Why is it all you can talk about today is eating!”

Xia Sheng scratched his cheek awkwardly.

Lan Xun suddenly sighed again and said, “If possible, it would be best to refine it into an Extraordinary Treasure Pill. There’s only one spirit flower, and in the scramble to follow, swords and fists have no eyes...”

She was the daughter of Bright Moon Great Emperor, so in many situations, she needed to consider things not just from her own perspective, but from the perspective of the entire Southern Territory, similar to when she took away the Pseudo Emperor Artifact from the Flowing Time Temple despite it being the least valuable treasure for her. At this moment, although she was delighted that an Extraordinary Treasure Lotus had appeared in the Four Seasons Realm, she was also wracked with worry about the battle which it would surely set off.

Everyone present here was an elite among the Southern Territory’s Dao Source Realm cultivators, and heavy casualties due to the fight for this spirit flower would definitely be a major loss for the Southern Territory...

“Princess must be joking. If you want to refine such a Heaven defying spirit flower into pills, surely it would require an Emperor Grade Alchemist! According to the Princess, this spirit flower must either be swallowed or used in Alchemy within three hours after it matures; how could that be enough time to find an appropriate Emperor Grade Alchemist?” Wu Chang coldly snorted. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Lan Xun shook her head though and said, “An Emperor Grade Alchemist is unnecessary, a Dao Source Grade one would be sufficient... But, we are all cultivators who have focused on the Martial Dao, so how could we have had time to delve into the Alchemic Dao? A Dao Source Grade Alchemist is still not easy to find... “

She shook her head and smiled bitterly, secretly feeling a little headache. She felt that the current crisis could not be resolved, and that a great opportunity was about to be missed. There was only one spirit flower, so only one person could take it, but if it could be refined into pills, it would be a completely different story.

At that moment, a voice suddenly sounded, “If your Highness is willing to trust me, how about letting me give it a try!”

As soon as these words came out, everyone looked startled and turned towards their source.

Lan Xun also hurriedly turned her eyes, but after seeing who the speaker was, she couldn’t help showing a surprised expression as she murmured, “Brother Yang...”

“You?” Xiao Chen also looked at Yang Kai with a shocked expression, one that soon turned into a sneer, “Do you know what you’re talking about? What the Princess said just now... did you not hear it clearly?”

“Naturally, I heard her clearly,” Yang Kai smiled slightly, still calm and relaxed under the attention of the crowd.

The cross-legged Zhuang Bu Fan also looked over at Yang Kai at this moment with a thoughtful look on his face.

Xia Sheng suddenly stretched out his hand to pull at the corner of Yang Kai’s clothes as he whispered in a low voice, “Brother Yang, I don’t think this is a good idea... If you really want to monopolize the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus, you might as well think of another way. Pretending to be a Dao Source Grade Alchemist won’t help you in any way...”

He obviously thought that Yang Kai was lying in order to gain some kind of initiative in the coming battle, so he hurriedly whispered to persuade him, otherwise, he would not just lose face but would also become the target of public criticism. Once that happened, no one would be able to save him.

Silavin: BTW, for those who don’t understand the Xiao Bai thing... it can be translated to idiot...

There is also Xiao Bai Lan... (in Chinese) Which means boy toy. But the main thing here is that the poor sap is being called an idiot...

On another note. Xiao Bai is probably the character everyone wrote in essays when they were children. Haha.

Not because it meant idiot to the children but because the name is so easy to write that teachers use it as their example, and kids just follow.
