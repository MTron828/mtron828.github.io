“The birth of Artifact Spirits has much more to do with fate and coincidence than with the grade of the artifact itself. Of course, some say that the higher the grade of the artifact, the higher the chance of an Artifact Spirit emerging from it. Perhaps it is true; after all, it takes a long time for an Artifact Spirit to appear, possibly even tens of thousands of years, so if an artifact’s grade is too low, it cannot survive that long...” Yang Kai did not say a word as Grandma You went on, listening intently.

“And, this Divine Ascension Mirror... possesses its own Artifact Spirit!” When she said this, Grandma You stared deeply at Yang Kai.

“Is that the Mirror Soul that you speak of, Granny?” Yang Kai raised a brow.

“Indeed!” Grandma You nodded lightly, “This Queen has been studying the Divine Ascension Mirror for thousands of years since discovering it, but this Queen has never been able to refine it and use it for herself. But once, long ago, I chanced upon the will of this world, the Mirror Soul! Without subduing the Mirror Soul, it is simply impossible to refine this world, but how easy can it be to subdue such an entity? Even this Queen with her Soul Avatar cultivated to this level is unable to achieve such a feat. Forcibly collecting this Mirror Soul will only destroy my own Soul since the strength of the Mirror Soul... is something that even a Great Emperor level cultivator might not be able to accommodate.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel roused and said, surprised, “So, you thought of using something else to carry the will of this world?”

Grandma You coldly snorted, “Is there any other way? But the requirements for this idea are also too harsh. Just how many divine objects are able to achieve this?” Speaking up to here, she suddenly gazed hotly at Yang Kai and said, “The Soul Warming Lotus you possess, however, is one such item.”

“So, that’s how it is!” Yang Kai nodded his head, enlightened.

“As long as this Queen can obtain the Soul Warming Lotus, this Queen will be able to use it as a carrier for this precious treasure. Together with the Mirror Soul of this Divine Ascension Mirror, this Queen can completely refine this world, and when that time comes, this Queen’s Soul will be able to soar up to the level of a Great Emperor. As for a petty little Wen Zi Shan...” She grinned from ear to ear and shrieked, “He would be worth nothing!”

“Grandma You, you have... quite a deep resentment towards Temple Master Wen,” Yang Kai said, exasperated.

“Don’t mention that bastard to me!” Grandma You suddenly burst out into a rage, “If it weren’t for him, this Queen would have been able to study this Divine Ascension Mirror quietly, and then this divine treasure would be mine in the end! But eight hundred years ago, he suddenly came to Azure Sun Mountain Range, beat this Queen, then demanded I hand over this treasure! This Queen couldn’t stand it!”

“Is that so...” Yang Kai said casually.

Grandma You glanced at him, gradually restraining the fury on her face. Her tone also began to soften as she said, “Boy, this Queen has told you everything you need to know, so the time has come for you to pass the Soul Warming Lotus to this Queen. Rest assured, this Queen only wishes to deal with Wen Zi Shan. After this wish is fulfilled, you may do whatever you wish.”

“Many thanks, Grandma You,” Yang Kai smirked before saying, “But this... is quite a difficult situation.”

Grandma You’s face turned cold as she watched Yang Kai grimly, gloomily snapping, “You mean to go back on your word, boy?”

“No no no...” Yang Kai denied immediately, “Only, even if I agree to this... Temple Master Wen would not. Isn’t that right, Temple Master Wen!”

At the last sentence, he suddenly turned his eyes towards a certain spot in the corner.

“What?” When Grandma You heard this, her face changed and shouted while looking around her, “Wen Zi Shan is here?”

She was like a mouse that had seen a cat, seemingly terrified of meeting Wen Zi Shan.

But in the next instant, she realized she had fallen for Yang Kai’s trick. There was no Wen Zi Shan standing anywhere and instead, Yang Kai had darted out while she was caught in a moment of panic.

“You damned brat!” Grandma You was furious, her pretty face turning ferocious and with a flicker of her body, she rushed out to pursue Yang Kai.

Even though Yang Kai used his teleportation ability, he was still unable to escape from Grandma You’s pursuit. Grandma You had already caught up with him as soon as he left the palace and blocked his path.

Grandma You pointed a finger at Yang Kai and a vortex of energy surged at her fingertip, seemingly containing a vast amount of power.

Yang Kai was horrified and his face changed.

But without thinking, he shouted, “Blossoming Lotus!”

With these words, a white lotus suddenly blossomed around his body.

Unlike the Blossoming Lotus Secret Technique he performed in the outside world, when he displayed this unparalleled Soul technique directly with his Soul Avatar, the lotus bud was directly exposed, allowing Grandma You to see it clearly.

“The Soul Warming Lotus!” Grandma You smiled happily when she saw this and her hands moved slightly.

Right at that moment though, the lotus flower bud shook slightly and then suddenly disappeared, turning into a stream of light that shot directly into Grandma You’s body.

“Nn!” Even someone as strong as Grandma You couldn’t help letting out a stifled grunt as her body shook. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

In the next moment, her beautiful face lost its colour.

Because she could feel her strength being sapped rapidly, as if something inside her was eating away at it. And, following the dissipation of her Spiritual Energy, a flower bud blossomed around her, giving off an intoxicating fragrance.

Yang Kai was able to catch her off guard with this attack and did not dare delay in the slightest. Wielding his Soul Splitting Saber, he slashed it straight towards Grandma You.

Even though his opponent was slightly affected by the Blossoming Lotus Secret Technique, she was not defenceless, blowing a sudden gust of wind towards Yang Kai and forcing him back with a slight lift of her hand.

The difference in strength between them was too great, so despite using all the tricks up his sleeve, Yang Kai was still not Grandma You’s opponent.

He cursed and dared not stay any longer. Teleporting away, Yang Kai instantly moved a few thousand metres and escaped straight out of the palace.

The sound of Grandma You’s angry roar came from behind him.

Everyone was shocked silent in the palace. Zhou Dian, Yu Man, and Yuan Qing were all looking towards the source of the noise with shocked faces.

A few moments later, outside the palace, Yang Kai’s body shot out like a shooting star.

He had no idea what he was going to do now, but he knew that if Grandma You caught him again, he wouldn’t be as lucky as he was just now. When that time came, Grandma You would definitely suppress him with absolute strength and forcibly extract the Soul Warming Lotus from his body.

Now though, he could only take things one step at a time.

In the middle of these thoughts, an amazing pressure suddenly appeared from behind him and pressed down on his body like a mountain.

Yang Kai stumbled and almost fell down, and when he looked back, he saw Grandma You several dozen kilometres behind him, chasing after him at incredible speed as she hurled threats, “Little brat, this Queen will make you beg for a quick death!”

But how could Yang Kai pay her any attention? Pushing the Space Principles around him to his limit and running for his life was all he cared about right now.

But the difference in power was too great so his efforts were merely delaying the inevitable.

Even Zhou Dian was able to capture him, let alone Grandma You herself.

Even though both were Third-Order Emperors, Grandma You had been studying the Divine Ascension Mirror for thousands of years, so even if she was unable to refine it, she could still borrow some of its powers to enhance herself.

It was no more than three breaths of time before Grandma You’s figure caught up to him.

From a short distance away, she laughed at him, locking onto him with her Divine Sense while using her Spiritual Energy to blockade the space around Yang Kai’s body, making it impossible for him to teleport away.

This time, she obviously had no intentions of beating around the bush with Yang Kai and flew straight towards him, reaching out her hand to capture and suppress him.

Yang Kai’s face turned black as he tried to think of some way out of this situation, but he was unable to come up with a way to resolve the crisis before his eyes.

The Soul Warming Lotus probably wouldn’t be able to stop Grandma You, and it was also his last resort, so Yang Kai really did not dare to use it until the true critical moment arrived.

Seeing that he was about to be captured, Yang Kai prepared himself to fight Grandma You to the death.

But at that moment, there was a sudden change.

From the west, a stream of light arrived in a flash in front of Yang Kai.

A beautiful figure emerged and radiated cold murderous intent.

A peerless beauty with bitingly cold Sword Qi.

Looking at this person’s beautiful back, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up and he called out softly to her, “Elder Gao!”

This person was Gao Xue Ting who separated from them shortly after their arrival in this world!

For some reason, she suddenly arrived and stood in front of Yang Kai at the critical moment.

Yang Kai noticed that she was carrying a longsword that had a sharp blade and a staggering energy fluctuation.

It was an Emperor grade Soul-type artifact!

But from the appearance of this Emperor Artifact, it seemed to have just finished being refined...

But soon, Yang Kai realized that something was wrong and shouted, “Elder Gao, you are not her opponent, quickly run!”

Gao Xue Ting was only a cultivator at the First-Order Emperor Realm, so even though she had entered the Divine Ascension Mirror World four times, and her Spiritual Energy’s cultivation was slightly stronger than that of her physical body, she was still no match for Grandma You. Her coming here would not help at all.

Faced with Yang Kai’s shout, Gao Xue Ting was unmoved, simply standing before him calmly as she indifferently said, “Don’t worry.”

On the other hand, Grandma You obviously recognized Gao Xue Ting as well, her expression fluctuating a few times before she stopped and shouted, “Get out of the way!”

She seemed to be afraid to lay a hand on Gao Xue Ting, her expression twisted into knots.

But Gao Xue Ting ignored her and instead turned to Yang Kai and asked with concern, “Are you injured?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “I’m fine.”

“Where are Xia Sheng and the others?”

“They’re being held in the Divine Prison, but Brother Xia and the others are suffering from some shock to their Souls right now. Fortunately, they are not in any life-threatening danger.”

“Good!” Gao Xue Ting was visibly relieved.

“Elder Gao, why did you come?” Yang Kai looked at her, surprised.

“I went to Heavenly Monster Mountain earlier, thinking I would check up on your training in secret, but on the way there I learned some unsavoury news and rushed back. Luckily I arrived just in time.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai showed a look of understanding.

Gao Xue Ting really did arrive just in the nick of time. If she had been just a step too late, Grandma You would have caught him.
