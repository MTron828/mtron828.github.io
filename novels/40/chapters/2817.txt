Creating medicines with Alchemy was Yang Kai’s forte. For that reason, Alchemy was the best choice for him if he wanted to earn enough for his use in an unfamiliar environment with limited financial resources.

Inside Frost and Snow City, those wounded Ancient Barbarian Warriors stopped suddenly. Their leader turned his head to look around him before looking down at Yang Kai with a malevolent aura, “Were you… speaking to us?”

Yang Kai smiled warmly to indicate that he was harmless, “That’s right!”

That Ancient Barbarian Warrior frowned. Even though he barely understood what Yang Kai had said just now, he understood the last sentence easily enough. [This guy has something to give me!]

There was no reason to turn down something that was given freely. Even so, he couldn’t help feeling distrustful upon seeing this scrawny person’s attitude; thus, he shook his head and turned to leave.

Yang Kai hurriedly said, “Wait, strong warrior!”

“What do you want?” The Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior was starting to get impatient.

Yang Kai continued, “Your injuries are rather severe, and it just so happens that I have some healing medicine and would like to give some to you. Please use it to treat your wounds!” While speaking, he pointed with his finger.

The Ancient Barbarian Warrior widened his eyes and glanced over at the stone pots in front of him before he scowled and asked, “You call this… Medicine?”

“Indeed!”

The Ancient Barbarian Warrior sneered with a look of disdain on his face. Meanwhile, the neighbouring stall owner couldn’t bear watching any longer. He packed up his stuff and prepared to leave this place, lest he hurt his eyes watching this farce.

“Just give it a try; you won’t lose anything from it. It’s not like you’re paying for it anyway. Won’t it be great if it works? If it doesn’t work… You can always come and destroy my stall,” Yang Kai said with a smile.

“Is this really a medicine?” The Ancient Barbarian Warrior could tell that Yang Kai was being serious and not simply talking nonsense. Thus, he couldn’t help becoming a little curious.

“It’s high-quality medicine!”

“If it doesn’t work, I will really destroy your stall!” Even though the other party appeared to be a Shaman, he did not take those words to heart. This was Frost and Snow City; moreover, they were clansmen of the Frost and Snow Clan, so if a Shaman from the outside were to break the rules and provoke them, they would not go easy on that person.

“What are you still hesitating for? Hurry up and give it a try!” Yang Kai urged energetically.

The Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior nodded. Crouching down in front of Yang Kai’s stall, he involuntarily frowned at the foul smell that assaulted his nose and he couldn’t help but hesitate, wondering if he should really try something so suspicious.

Yang Kai earnestly explained as if he was teaching a young student, “Good medicine tastes bad. My medicine might smell a little, but the effects are indisputable.”

“I hope it’s as you said.” The Ancient Barbarian Warrior revealed a determined expression while saying that, looking as if he had made a huge decision about something. Reaching out his hand, he scooped some of the paste out of one of the stone pots. Then, he carefully and evenly applied the paste to the wound on his abdomen under Yang Kai’s instructions.

That wound was an arm’s length long and cut very deep into the flesh. An injury like that was not considered life-threatening to an Ancient Barbarian, but it would still be bad if it were left untreated.

When that stinky paste was applied to his body, the warrior raised his brow abruptly. Simultaneously, a look of astonishment appeared on his face. Throughout it all, his companions stared at him curiously, wondering if the medicine was effective.

A cooling sensation spread out from the Ancient Barbarian Warrior’s abdomen, alleviating the pain, and in the next moment, he let out an exclamation of surprise and hurriedly lowered his head to look, as if he felt something changing. Then, his eyes widened in shock.

The flesh around the wound on his abdomen was slightly squirming. Following those wriggling movements, new flesh began to grow in his wound. That deep injury was healing at a speed visible to the naked eyes and forming a scar…

It was apparent that the rest of his companions had noticed the change going on too as they made exclamations of shock as they watched the changes happening to the wound in disbelief.

The neighbouring stall owner that had been preparing to leave was also staring stupidly with eyes as large as saucers. He looked like he wanted to dig out his eyes and stick them to the other party’s abdomen just to see the changes more closely. This strange behaviour attracted many others who were passing by, and when these people learned what was going on, they all stopped to spectate the changes in the wound out of curiosity.

An hour later, the Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior that had tried the medicine touched his abdomen dumbly. The remains of the medicine and remnants of dried blood fell off cleanly, revealing a scar about an arm’s length to the crowd. Although it was not completely healed, the miraculous effect was enough to make everybody gasp in amazement; after all, the wound had been a bloody mess just an hour ago.

“It really worked!” When that Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior that had tried the medicine looked up again, he gazed at Yang Kai with blazing eyes, his expression filled with both gratitude and admiration.

Yang Kai simply smiled without saying anything. [Of course the medicine I created works.]

Unfortunately, this medicine’s effects were limited to the Ancient Barbarian Race that had robust vitality and high amounts of Blood Qi. If it were applied to cultivators in the present day, it would not have been as effective. That was because a large part of the medicine’s efficacy came from stimulating the Blood Qi around the wound and speeding up the process of self-regeneration. Therefore, only the Ancient Barbarian Race could bring about such immediate effects after applying the medicine.

“Are you a Herbalist?” That Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior asked.

“I guess so.”

When the onlookers heard those words, they suddenly put away the contemptuous expressions on their faces. No matter how weak Yang Kai might look, a Herbalist was an existence worthy of respect.

Then, Yang Kai raised his head and looked at the people crowding around them. He smiled and said, “Warriors often face fierce battles, and if you receive an injury while in the wilderness, it will surely affect your fighting abilities. However, if you carry this medicine on you, you don’t need to worry about that anymore! As long as my medicine is applied to your wounds, it can make you as fit as a tiger again in an instant. This is my first time coming to Frost and Snow City, so I’m selling it cheaply as a sign of goodwill.”

Before that Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior tried the medicine, nobody would have bothered to listen to what Yang Kai said; however, nobody doubted the effectiveness of the medicine anymore after witnessing the miraculous scene with their own eyes.

Besides, what this Herbalist said was right; it was very troubling when Warriors from the Ancient Barbarian Race were injured in battle in the wilderness. Even though everybody knew how to provide first aid to a certain extent, how could it compare to this healing medicine? If they could carry some of this paste on them, they could treat their wounds at any time. Moreover, the healing effect was shockingly fast and complete.

“How much are you selling it for?!” Someone asked immediately.

“Ten Green Coins for one pot!” Yang Kai had prepared for this a long time ago and immediately named his price.

Ten Green Coins was neither high nor low, so any adult Ancient Barbarian Warrior could afford it. This would allow Yang Kai to maximize his gains.

Sure enough, countless people immediately yelled ‘I’ll take one!’ upon hearing those words.

Looking at the people in front of him, Yang Kai grinned widely, staring out at all his new money sources!

The few pots of medicine were cleanly sold out within a quarter of an hour. Those that managed to buy some were overjoyed while those that failed to buy some were highly depressed and remorseful.

Yang Kai packed up his stuff and smilingly announced, “The medicine is sold out for today! If there are any who wish to buy some of this medicine, please come by early tomorrow!”

As he turned to leave, the neighbouring stall owner glanced at his back enviously. For some reason, his back suddenly seemed so tall and imposing…

Selling the medicine once was enough to increase Yang Kai’s assets by more than tenfold.

Yang Kai proceeded to spend all his Green Coins to buy out all the herbs at several stalls in Frost and Snow City before returning to his Tree Cave to refine medicine again.

When he came to set up his stall the next day, he saw many customers had already gathered. Some were those that failed to obtain the medicine yesterday while some came after listening to the rumours.

A strange Herbalist had appeared in Frost and Snow City. Moreover, the medicine he made could make external wounds heal quickly. Word of this had spread across the entire city overnight. Furthermore, it received the approval of many Ancient Barbarian Warriors from the Frost and Snow Clan.

The people of this era were relatively simple and hardly engaged in schemes and plots. Therefore, no one believed this news to be fake. For that reason, even though Yang Kai brought more than ten times the amount of medicine compared to yesterday, it took less than half a day for him to finish selling it all. Incidentally, his financial assets began snowballing just as he had expected.

That was the case for five consecutive days. The momentum behind that mad rush to purchase his medicine showed no signs of stopping and the situation made Yang Kai very happy.

Yang Kai silently calculated the money he had in his hands and estimated that he could stop doing this in another half a month’s time. By then, he would have enough Green Coins to buy all the Monster Cores he wanted. As long as he could raise his realm from a Low-Rank Shaman Warrior to Shaman Master, he would be set for life. His cultivation would smoothly rise with all the resources he had accumulated.

On that day, Yang Kai finished selling his medicine and prepared to wander the streets of Frost and Snow City to procure more raw materials when, all of a sudden, he frowned as he instinctively felt that something was wrong. Reaching out his hand to check his waist, his expression immediately darkened as the animal skin bag he used to hold his Green Coins was gone.

That animal skin bag contained thousands of Green Coins he gained from selling his medicine today. Fortunately, he had stored most of his wealth in his Tree Cave, so security was not an issue and he hadn’t lost everything, but this was still a frustrating event for Yang Kai.

[A thief?! There are thieves in this era?!] If not for the empty feeling in his hands telling him that it was not an illusion, Yang Kai would not have believed his own judgment. Ever since he entered this Sealed World, all the Ancient Barbarians he met, whether they were friendly or unfriendly, had been simple-minded and straightforward. Hence, he never expected to meet a thief in this place.

In a moment’s carelessness, Yang Kai had failed miserably at something he should never have failed at. [What a great disgrace! An Emperor Realm Master like me, actually allowed somebody to swipe my money from me without me noticing! This shame is so deep that I will never live it down for the rest of my life!] DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

His expression turned solemn, and his gaze rove across the crowd. He quickly locked on to a beefy Ancient Barbarian who was weaving between the crowds. That person was dressed in a tightly wrapped robe that covered up their features to the point where it was impossible to tell whether they were even male or female, making them incredibly conspicuous.

With a snort, Yang Kai quietly followed behind that person, having no intention of alerting the people around him. That person was rather careful, zigzagging through the crowds. Only after circling about for an hour did this individual finally slip into a remote area off the bustling streets.
