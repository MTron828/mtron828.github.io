Chapter 946, Twin Spirit Pavilion

The strength of these several thousand cultivators was not high, only the couple dozen or so who had reached the Transcendent Realm were worthy of a little attention, while the rest were only at the Immortal Ascension and True Element Boundary.

This caused Sun Yu and the masters from Dragon Phoenix Palace to be quite curious, wondering where all these people had come from and what kind of relationship they had with Yang Kai.

“They’re all my friends and family,” Yang Kai explained casually before his expression turned serious, “In any case; I must offer you my thanks for this time.”

Because of a few words from Yang Kai, Sun Yu had actually done his best to have Dragon Phoenix Palace seek out news of his homeland and after obtaining a lead, had personally led a team of masters here.

This alone made Yang Kai very grateful.

At that time, Yang Kai had exhausted all his personal connections in the faint hope that they would discover something.

Yang Kai could just imagine what it was like when Sun Yu insisted on going out this time. The masters from Dragon Phoenix Palace must have vehemently objected but he still had not hesitated to come.

This young man had a character of gold!

“Shi Kun, after we return, speak with Great Elder and let him announce that from now on, our Holy Land will be close friends with Dragon Phoenix Palace,” Yang Kai said seemingly thoughtlessly.

“Yes!” Shi Kun quickly responded.

“This...” Chen Zhou wrung his hands nervously as a smile blossomed on his face, at somewhat of a loss for words, finally managing to stammer out, “I don’t know what to say.”

Dragon Phoenix Palace was not at all formidable now yet Nine Heavens Holy Land’s was among the most powerful and famous Sects in the world and had a profound and mysterious Alchemy Grandmaster within its ranks; which Sect did not want to establish ties with Nine Heavens Holy Land? Once they were able to forge such a relationship, the benefits they would receive would be enormous, at the very least; they would never have to worry about obtaining Saint Pills in the future.

Chen Zhou had never expected that this Holy Master Yang would be so congenial, causing his heart to shake and his thoughts to spin.

His face blushing bright red with excitement, Chen Zhou hastily said, “This Chen sincerely thanks Holy Master Yang for his kind intentions, just as you said, Dragon Phoenix Palace will advance and retreat together with Nine Heavens Holy Land in the future!”

Chen Zhou was not an inexperienced character and had seen his fair share of great storms, but his heart was still thrown into chaos because of these few words from Yang Kai.

“Palace Master Chen is too polite. Right, since you’ve come, I have a favour to ask of you,” Yang Kai suddenly thought of something.

“Please speak it, Holy Master Yang,” Chen Zhou replied sincerely.

“As Palace Master Chen has surely seen, the cultivations of my friends and family are not very high and the distance from here to Nine Heavens Holy Land is quite far. Perhaps there will be accidents on the road like this. If it is convenient, could I request Chen Palace Master to help me escort them home?” Yang Kai smiled and said, “Of course, when we arrive at the Holy Land, I will provide a generous reward.”

Hearing these last words, the eyes of all the Dragon Phoenix Palace masters lit up.

Sun Yu quickly waved his hand, “Senior Yang need not be so polite with us, whatever matter it is you need our assistance with, please feel free to speak it and we will surely comply. As for a reward, there is no need for such a thing.”

Chen Zhou hurriedly composed himself and nodded, “Indeed, Holy Master Yang does not need to treat my Dragon Phoenix Palace as outsiders.”

Yang Kai gently nodded, “Then... I’ll have to trouble you all for a time.”

Sun Yu smiled happily, “Very good, it seems I’ll have another chance to learn from Senior Yang.”

The people from Dragon Phoenix Palace immediately dispersed under the arrangements of Chen Zhou to patrol the surrounding area.

They hadn’t brought a lot of people here, only about thirty or forty in total, but most of them were Transcendent, so with such a group of masters joining them, the caravan would definitely be safer. After all, these masters were natives of Tong Xuan Realm and were very familiar with how things worked here, unlike the Great Han Dynasty cultivators who essentially knew nothing about this place.

Ling Jian quietly pulled Sun Yu aside and whispered, “Little disciple, when did you become acquainted with Holy Master Yang? From how you spoke just now, it was almost as if you had studied with him for a time? Why don’t I, your Master, know anything about that?”

Sun Yu didn’t dare speak the truth so he just left Ling Jian guessing.

Two days later, everything was ready and the several thousand people convey set out for Nine Heavens Holy Land.

These cultivators from the Great Han Dynasty were filled with excitement, all of them staring around curiously, pointing out various new and interesting things from time to time, gathering together in small groups and whispering amongst themselves.

The people from Dragon Phoenix Palace had also become incredibly popular with each of them constantly being surrounded by countless cultivators, all of them asking questions about Tong Xuan Realm.

The Dragon Phoenix Palace’s masters did not dare to neglect these relatives and friends of Yang Kai, answering anything they were asked all day long, their moods somewhat confused, not knowing whether to laugh or cry about this group of country bumpkins.

They had found that these people were ignorant of even the most basic common sense things.

Many of them were curious what kind of backwater Mysterious Small World these people used to line in.

At the back of the caravan, Yang Kai and Sun Yu walked side by side. Sun Yu would ask questions about the Martial Dao from time to time, and Yang Kai would happily teach him.

Not far away, Dragon Phoenix Palace’s Palace Master Chen Zhou actually had his gaze fixed on two pretty figures who were walking slightly ahead of him, a pensive look upon his face.

Perceiving this, a thought came to Yang Kai and he took the initiative to ask, “Has Palace Master Chen discovered something interesting?”

Chen Zhou smiled and said, “It’s not a big deal, I just found it strange how similar those two girls in front are. Not only do they share identical appearances, but even their life auras and True Qi fluctuations are exactly the same. The only difference between them is their temperaments. If Holy Master Yang had not said they had just come to Tong Xuan Realm, I would have thought they came from a certain Sect.”

Yang Kai raised his brow and shouted, “Jiao’er, Mei’er!”

The Hu Sisters, who were walking not far ahead, heard this shouts and hurriedly turned around. After approaching Yang Kai, Hu Jiao’er asked, “What is it?”

Yang Kai ignored her and instead turned to look at Chen Zhou, “Which Sect did Palace Master Chen think they came from?”

Chen Zhou stared at them for a moment before replying, “Twin Spirit Pavilion, I don’t know if Holy Master Yang has heard of it.”

[Just as I thought.]

Yang Kai nodded, “Naturally I have heard of it, I also heard that this Twin Spirit Pavilion and your honoured Sect have been on good terms for a long time.”

“En, the relationship between our two Sects truly is quite good, but there are many complicated reasons for that,” Chen Zhou smiled bitterly and said.

These two Sects had been close for many generations going back thousands of years.

Just as Yang Kai had suspected, Dragon Phoenix Palace and Twin Spirit Pavilion had both once been extremely powerful Sects, standing at the peak of the Human Territory, comparable to today’s Nine Heavens Holy Land.

But for some unknown reason, the top masters of Twin Spirit Pavilion had at some point disappeared along with the Dragon Emperor and Phoenix Empress, causing their core inheritances to become lost and their Sects to decline.

The two Sects had originally been close, and after suffering similar hardships, had only grown more intimate over the years.

“Our Dragon Phoenix Palace is still better off though thanks to Sun Yu successfully obtaining the Dragon Emperor’s inheritance. Now, so long as he can find an appropriate Phoenix Empress candidate, my Dragon Phoenix Palace will surely be able to reproduce the glory of its past. But Twin Spirit Pavilion... haa... there is still no word on the location of their core inheritance,” Chen Zhou said with a complicated expression, somewhat happy yet somewhat sad.

Sun Yu, who was nearby, lowered his head, not daring to say anything.

“Twin Spirit Pavilion?” Hu Jiao Er, who had been listening up until now, suddenly showed some reaction, a slightly excited look appearing on her face as she asked, “What kind of Sect is this Twin Spirit Pavilion?”

Chen Zhou chuckled, “It is a very special Sect because they only recruit twin brothers or sisters. As such, all this force’s disciples form pairs, en, actually this point is quite similar to our Dragon Phoenix Palace, but they cultivate a shared life Secret Art while we specialize in a life partner dual cultivation art.”

“A force that only recruits twins?” The Hu Sisters’ beautiful eyes lit up. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Yes, on top of that, all their disciple pairs give off a feeling that they are the same person, quite similar to the two of you. After cultivating their Secret Art, each pair of twin brothers or sisters have their True Qi fluctuations and life auras gradually become the same, allowing the two to join forces and multiply their respective strengths; however, the two of you seem to be even fiercer than them. I have also travelled to the Twin Spirit Pavilion many times and met many of their disciples, but none of them were comparable to you two.”

“Senior, do you know what the name of the Secret Art they cultivate is?” Hu Jiao Er hurriedly asked, a look of expectation flashing across her beautiful eyes.

Yang Kai glanced over at her, knowing what she was suspecting.

“Their Secret Art seems to be called the Twin Qi Shared Spirit Divine Art... but it is now incomplete. Although after so many generations the section which was lost has been made up, somewhat through their own efforts, they have still been unable to reproduce the glory of their ancestors,” Chen Zhou said casually; a Sect’s cultivation technique should not be leaked out, but having its name be known wasn’t a big deal.

“It really is!” Hu Jiao’er’s tender body trembled as her beautiful eyes practically glittered with brilliance.

“Elder Sister...” Hu Mei’er also covered her mouth and whispered incredulously, “Isn’t that the name of the Secret Art we obtained?”

“You managed to obtain it?” Chen Zhou called out in alarm as he stared at the Hu Sisters with great shock.

Hu Jiao’er sincerely nodded, “The name of our two sisters’ cultivation technique is the Twin Qi Shared Spirit Divine Art, and it could be related to Twin Spirit Pavilion?”

“How could it not be related?” Chen Zhou said excitedly, “Surely that was the lost inheritance of Twin Spirit Pavilion. I never expected it would be obtained by you two; no wonder your auras are so consistent!”

Saying so, Chen Zhou suddenly burst into laughter, “If Wu Fa and Wu Tian learned of this matter, I’m afraid they would be too excited to even sleep.”

“Wu Fa and Wu Tian?” Yang Kai asked.

“En, the two Sect Masters of Twin Spirit Pavilion are called Wu Fa and Wu Tian, they are twin brothers,” Chen Zhou explained quickly.

“Such names... Yang Kai was secretly amazed and couldn’t help chuckling to himself. These two names were far too arrogant and could easily provoke hatred. If some short-tempered master was to bump into them and they announced themselves, it would surely lead to a fight.

(Silavin: Wu Fa – The Law, Wu Tian – The Sky. Something like claiming they are the heaven)

“Originally that Secret Art came from that Twin Spirit Pavilion,” Hu Jiao’er wore a complicated look.

Since she and her sister obtained the Twin Qi Shared Spirit Divine Art, their destiny had undergone a great change. The rate at which the two of them improved their strengths was now many times greater than an average cultivator, allowing them in just over a decade to break through to the Transcendent Realm, becoming some of the strongest masters in the entire Great Han Dynasty.

The two of them were naturally very grateful to this profound Secret Art and to the Senior who had left it behind for them to discover.

Now that they knew the source of this Secret Art, both of them couldn’t help thinking about paying Twin Spirit Pavilion a visit to take a look at the Sect from which it originated as well as to see other twin brothers and sisters who cultivated the same Secret Art as them.
