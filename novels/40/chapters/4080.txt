The strange snake’s right head said in the human language, “We are too far away and you are too slow. At your pace, by the time you arrive at the Primordial Land, everything will already be over.”

“But...” Qu Hua Shang was extremely troubled, “You’re too ugly...”

She could not stop sighing in her heart. The Divine Spirits of the others were all majestic or beautiful as paintings, yet her own was so ugly that she could hardly bear to look at him.

The strange snake fumed, “Me, ugly? You must be blind, little girl. How could you call me ugly? You’re the ugliest one!”

Qu Hua Shang’s face went dark, but she was unwilling to argue with him about this further.

Many millions of kilometres away, a man riding on a leopard spirit beast was laughing and shouting, “Faster, faster! I can’t wait to meet the heroes of this world. I want to see whether they’re greater or if this one is greater!”

The Human-faced leopard Divine Spirit grumbled, “Stinking brat, I’m your Protector, not your mount, so don’t think you can order this Great Aunt around! I’ll throw you down if you keep making noise!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The man laughed again, “Go ahead and throw me off! If you throw me off, then there will be no one to grab the Innate Spirit Fruit for you!”

The Human-faced leopard Divine Spirit fumed.

.....

One by one, the Divine Spirits moved out, bringing their chosen Bearers with them towards the Primordial Land. The World Energy was in chaos, and only now did the cultivators who fell into the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary realize that there were actually so many powerful existences in this world, so they could not help but tremble.

They had been living here for more than ten years, but only a few of them had encountered Divine Spirits. They never knew that the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary could actually be so dangerous.

Fortunately, most of these Divine Spirits lived in seclusion, not bothering to harm others before. Otherwise, how could anyone still be alive today? Any one of these Divine Spirits was not a being that any of those Humans could fight against.

The Primordial Land was about to open, and a Heavenly Manifestation was emerging. The Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary was boiling with excitement. Countless cultivators were converging towards the Primordial Land from all directions.

In just ten short days, no less than 3,000 people gathered outside the Primordial Land, and this was merely the first group to arrive. More would come as time passed.

A month later, no less than 200,000 people had already gathered outside the Primordial Land. At this point, no more people were coming. Even if there were, they were only a few scattered cultivators here and there.

In other words, almost all of the cultivators who were still living now in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary were gathered here.

When the Star City was swallowed up by the Grand Ancient Ruins Rolling Fog, there were naturally more than just 200,000 people swept up. There were at least three or four times this amount, possibly more. After ten years had passed though, only so many people remained alive, which showed how dangerous the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary was.

Now that the Primordial Land was opening, how many would return safely?

Outside of the Primordial Land, cultivators gathered in groups. They were all setting up their own camps, and the Divine Spirits also released their powerful auras without any trace of politeness to claim territories and deter others out of respect and fear.

Everyone looked up at the sky in awe, staring at the ever-changing seven-coloured glow, which was said to be the gateway to the Primordial Land. Only, it had yet to fully open at this moment, so no one could enter. The day the glow became completely stable was the day when this secret land opened.

Qu Hua Shang, Gu Pan, Lin Feng, Xu Zhen, and Ning Dao Ran were all present and gathered in one place, laughing and talking about their encounters of recent years.

Behind the five of them, the five Divine Spirits watched them from afar, not only looking after the safety of their Bearers, but also coveting the lives of the others.

If they could kill a few more Bearers here, then it would mean less competition later.

The extremely faint sense of hostility was pervasive, but under mutual deterrence, none of them dared to strike.

The two-headed strange snake slithered over, silently spitting out its forked tongues before retracting them quickly.

Qu Hua Shang turned her head in anger, “If you dare eat him, then I will leave immediately!”

The strange snake’s left head said, “Eat what? What’s there to eat?”

Qu Hua Shang gritted her teeth, “Open your right mouth.”

The strange snake’s right head turned its head aside and looked up at the sky with its two snake pupils.

“I’m leaving!” Qu Hua Shang got up decisively.

“I won’t eat them anymore, I won’t!” The left head shouted. Then, as the right head opened its mouth, a wet cultivator was spat out. The cultivator had a bewildered look on his face after landing on the ground, not knowing when he had been scooped up into this Divine Spirit’s mouth. As soon as he realized what had happened, his face paled and he shrieked before turning into a stream of light and flying far away.

The strange snake coldly snorted, “You really are troublesome, you ugly girl. There are so many people here, what does it matter if I eat one or two of them!”

The faces of the cultivators nearby paled in an instant and all moved away from the strange snake.

“Watch it, I’ve got my eye on you!” Qu Hua Shang pointed at her eyes and glared viciously at the strange snake.

The corner of Xu Zhen’s mouth twitched, “Uh... Senior Fei Yi is quite interesting.”

The strange two-headed snake was the Divine Spirit, Fei Yi. Xu Zhen could not help but feel envious of Qu Hua Shang for having such a firm hold of this Divine Spirit. His experience in speaking with Zhu Yan had not been as smooth. During the years he spent with this Divine Spirit, he had experienced a fair share of beatings.

“So unbearably ugly!” Qu Hua Shang said with a look of disgust on her face before she changed the subject, “How come Brother Yang isn’t here yet? He should have arrived long ago.”

Qu Hua Shang had been furthest away from the Primordial Land’s entrance, and even she was able to arrive three days ago, yet she saw no sign of Yang Kai, so she could not help but wonder.

Xu Zhen answered, “I contacted Brother Yang earlier, but something seems to be hunting him down!”

Qu Hua Shang was shocked, “Hunting him down? Who?”

Xu Zhen responded, “The Heavenly Moon Demon Spider’s enemies teamed up to ambush them on their way here, which held them back for quite some time.”

Qu Hua Shang was stunned.

“Huh? Here he comes.”

Xu Zhen suddenly turned towards a certain direction. There, a fierce aura could be seen rapidly approaching. In the blink of an eye, it had already arrived in front of them, taking the form of a gorgeous young girl that was holding onto someone in her hands. Who could it be but Yang Kai?

Yang Kai was latched onto the woman’s body at this moment like an octopus, holding onto her for dear life and complaining incessantly, “Why do you have so many enemies? How did you survive all this while, woman?”

Zhu Jiu Yin sneered, “Do you really think a few pitiful weaklings like them can fight against this Queen? If it were one-on-one, then this Queen would have killed them off ruthlessly already!” As she said that, she stared coldly at Yang Kai, “Aren’t you going to let go?!”

Yang Kai suddenly came to his senses and let go of her. Standing next to her, he tidied up his own clothes, and he could not help but sigh as he thought back to their previous encounters on their way here.

In this one month, they had encountered at least five ambushes. Several Divine Spirits had been lying in wait for them on their way here, and they fought more than a dozen battles, both big and small. The worst fight was when they were being ganged up on by three Divine Spirits. Zhu Jiu Yin was also amazing to have been able to hold off those attackers and get them here safely; however, they did waste a lot of time on the way.

They had just arrived when another five powerful auras rushed over behind them. They were five Divine Spirits who had been chasing after them all this way, and all of them had taken on Human forms. There were both male and female, young and old. All of them were looking over with eyes filled with hatred as if they could not wait to skin Zhu Jiu Yin alive.

Yang Kai’s heart was pounding, “Senior, they’re here. Are you able to hold them back?”

Zhu Jiu Yin responded crisply, “No!”

“Then, we’re in danger.”

Yang Kai had a grave expression, “We’d better avoid them for now and come back when the Primordial Land opens.”

“Don’t worry.”

Zhu Jiu Yin reassured him, “Since we are here, they won’t try to attack us anymore.”

“Why?” Yang Kai did not understand.

“They also have enemies. Starting a fight here will only be troubling themselves!” Zhu Jiu Yin sneered.

Just as she said, after these five chased them to this place, even though all of them were filled with fury, none of them tried to attack Zhu Jiu Yin. Yang Kai could also keenly sense that there were strong auras locked onto these five Divine Spirits. Those seem to be their enemies as Zhu Jiu Yin was talking about.

“Even though they won’t dare to strike at me so simply, you should still watch out. Better not let them hurt you.” Zhu jiu Yin reminded Yang Kai, “Remember their auras. If you encounter their Bearers in the Primordial Land, then kill them for me!”

Yang Kai frowned, “They have Bearers, too? Why don’t I see them?”

Zhu Jiu Yin smirked, “Naturally, they are hiding among the other Humans and unwilling to show themselves. But since they came here, that must mean they have already chosen their Bearers. There is no way they would come here empty-handed.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Understood.”

Turning around and looking behind him, Yang Kai was stunned. The portal to the Primordial Land was magnificent. The seven-coloured glow twisted and turned as if a great mystery was hidden behind it.

Around the outer periphery of the Primordial Land, Divine Spirits with powerful auras occupied different pieces of territory. Some hid their Bearers in the crowd while others stayed close to protect them.

Yang Kai was shocked. At a glance, there were at least fifty Divine Spirits gathered here!

How terrifying a force was that? These fifty Divine Spirits were equal to fifty High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters. Perhaps only a few of the Cave-Heavens and Paradises had such a powerful heritage.

Most of these Divine Spirits had taken human form, but there were also those who maintained their true bodies, each one as big as a mountain, appearing majestic and powerful.

Yang Kai saw Kun Sha, who was glaring coldly at him, not at all hiding his murderous intent.

There was also Fei Yi, Kui Niu, Zhu Yan, Bi Fang, Nu Fang...

Yang Kai had only heard of these Divine Spirits but never seen them before. Today, Yang Kai had an eye-opening experience.

These Divine Spirits were not all the Divine Spirits that could be found in this Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. Zhu Jiu Yin had told him before that some Divine Spirits were satisfied with the situation and had no intention of leaving the Grand Ancient Ruins. Naturally, they would not come to interfere in this chaos.

However, Yang Kai was surprised that he saw neither Dragons nor Phoenixes among the Divine Spirits. He was able to obtain an Earth Attribute Great Dragon Bead previously in the Crouching Dragon Mountains, so he thought that Dragon Clan members existed in this Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. However, now it seemed that the Great Dragon that passed away was the last of its kind.

This made him feel slightly sad. Yang Kai never made a contract with Zhu Jiu Yin through these days because he was hoping to find a Great Dragon. If he could find a Dragon here, then he would have better options.
