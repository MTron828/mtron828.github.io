And with that, the thirty or so Dao Source Realm cultivators who came after being alarmed by Yang Kai’s Emperor Artifact left the Qin Residence in a flurry.

Except for one, who was still hovering mid-air.

Yang Kai looked at that person with his eyes squinted and found that it was a well-dressed young woman with a graceful figure and fair complexion. Her hair was flowing down her back like a waterfall and she was wearing a turquoise dress. Her beautiful eyes shone brightly and although she kept a distance from Yang Kai, fear could not be seen in her eyes.

The cultivation of this young woman was not high, but not low either, Second-Order Dao Source Realm. It seemed she was from some second-class Sect or big family.

“Why didn’t you leave?” Yang Kai turned solemn when he noticed that she was not leaving.

The young woman replied after hearing it, “Little Brother, may I ask if you are Grandmaster Yang?”

Yang Kai frowned and started to secretly raise his guard, asking instead of answering, “Who are you?”

The young woman hurriedly introduced herself, “This Mistress is Thousand Leaves Sect, Ye Jing Han.”

“Thousand Leaves Sect?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes. He vaguely had some impression about this Sect, but nothing deep; however, he was certain that it was not some big Sect, probably similar to Blue Feather Sect, which did not have an Emperor Realm Master commanding it.

Across the entire Southern Territory, there were numerous Sects like this, each claiming some territories in order to live and multiply. Perhaps, some of their ancestors had achieved some glorious accomplishments, but afterwards, they suffered from a decline over the generations.

Blue Feather Sect was one such Sect. The ancestors of Blue Feather Sect’s Sect Master Wu Meng Shan was a peak level figure in the Star Boundary in the past, Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. This was a man able to cover the Heavens with only one hand, so powerful that the wind and the clouds were under his command. But in this generation, Wu Meng Shan was just a Sect Master of a small Sect and possessed only a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation.

In this world, no Sect endured forever, no family that would not decline and die out. Only Star Soul Palace and some of the greatest Sects could maintain their prominence for ten thousand years or more.

“Are you really Grandmaster Yang?” Ye Jing Han asked eagerly.

“You’ve got the wrong person,” Yang Kai replied without hesitation.

A few people from the Qin Family and the Eight Paths Sect disciples could not help staring at him weirdly when he made this response.

“You’re right, he is Grandmaster Yang Kai!” The round-faced woman who was infatuated with Luo Yuan suddenly shouted happily. After she spoke, she turned a grin to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai immediately gave her a fierce glance.

“So, you really are Grandmaster Yang!” Ye Jing Han could not help feeling a little thrilled after confirming Yang Kai’s identity.

“I already said you’ve got the wrong person. There are many people with the same name in this world, so please hurry up and leave, otherwise, I may be rude to you,” Yang Kai swung his hands impatiently, like he was trying to drive away a fly.

Ye Jing Han bit her lip lightly as she looked at Yang Kai pitifully, “Grandmaster Yang, can you please just listen to a few words from this Mistress? This Mistress will leave after speaking.”

“No thanks!”

“You...” The round-faced woman seemed to be unable to stand it anymore and rebuked, “She is already begging you like this, so why can’t you just listen to her speak? Don’t you know anything about being caring and considerate towards women?!”

Yang Kai glared at her, “No, I don’t! Also, everyone came here just to steal my treasure, so why should I bother indulging her? If this happened to your Luo Yuan, what would you do?”

“What do you mean my Luo Yuan...” The round-faced woman’s face blushed and started to be restless again. But after a while, she returned to her cold face and snorted coldly, “If anyone dared to touch Senior Brother Luo, I’d kill them!”

She put on a murderous face that shocked Yang Kai greatly as he didn’t imagine she had such a vicious side to her.

“Patriarch Qin, send this guest off,” Yang Kai spoke to Qin Zhao Yang, then waved to Qin Yu, “Sister Qin, follow me!”

“En,” Qin Yu hurriedly moved towards Yang Kai.

To the side, Qin Zhao Yang pondered for a moment before he flew up into the air and started talking to Ye Jing Han. It seemed that he was trying to convince Ye Jing Han to leave but she kept refusing and begging.

“Oh right!” Yang Kai turned around when he was about to leave and sneered at the disciples of Eight Paths Sect, “Behave yourselves, if any of you dare to cross the line again, I’ll make sure you answer to me!”

The few disciples of Eight Paths Sect had cold sweat beading on their foreheads when they heard this and none dared to ignore Yang Kai’s order, nodding one after another. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

After they clearly saw how Yang Kai slew Qu Huai Ren and robbed the middle-aged man’s artifact just now, they understood that they were no match for him, and if they did provoke him, they would not end well.

The round-faced woman smiled, “Relax, I will look after them to make sure they don’t cause a fuss.”

“That would be best, otherwise, don’t blame me for not giving Luo Yuan any face!” Yang Kai snorted lightly, turned, and left.

Yang Kai led Qin Yu all the way to a secret room where he had her take a seat. Qin Zhao Yang rushed in hurriedly a moment later, seemingly having settled the matter with Ye Jiang Han. He gazed at Yang Kai hopefully, and asked restlessly, “Little Brother Yang... About the trip to the Four Seasons Realm... Did you get it?”

Ever since Yang Kai returned, he did not have the time to ask about the matter of the Tribulation Fruit. Now that he was finally free, it was natural that Qin Zhao Yang couldn’t wait to know the result.

Qin Yu’s tender body also could not help trembling as her breathing became a bit hurried, seemingly unable to control her emotions.

After all, this was a matter of life or death to her. How could a young girl, who was still not eighteen, who had not fully seen the beauty of the world or experienced its various wonders, meekly accept death?

Yang Kai glanced at both of them and smiled faintly, “Fortunately, I have not failed my mission!”

While speaking, he took out a jade box from his Space Ring and opened it with a flick, showing an ice-carved jade-like spirit fruit that immediately attracted their eyes.

Qin Zhao Yang observed it attentively with his eyes wide-open while Qin Yu could not help but stretch her fair neck and look at it dumbfounded.

“This is... It is, it is! It’s the Tribulation Fruit!” Qin Zhao Yang burst into laughter after observing it for a while, tears of joy flowing down from his eyes, “That Senior once showed me a projected image of this spirit fruit and it matches perfectly.”

Qin Yu immediately covered her lips with her hands after hearing this, a weight finally lifting from her shoulders, her whole body going limp with relief.

“There were a lot of twists and turns in obtaining this spirit fruit, that’s why I couldn’t come back immediately. I’m sorry to have made you wait so long,” Yang Kai explained briefly.

Qin Zhao Yang said through his tears, “Don’t worry, don’t worry. This time, thanks to Little Brother Yang, Yu’er has hope to survive!”

“By the way, Patriarch Qin, did that Master back then say anything about how this should be consumed by Sister Qin? Does it need to be refined into a pill? If so, I can help with that,” Yang Kai asked solemnly.

“There is no need to refine it!” Qin Zhao Yang shook his head, “That Senior said we only need to find the Tribulation Fruit and let Yu’er eat it directly. Her World Tribulation Body is rejected by the Heavens and Earth, causing her vitality to be cut off, so the Tribulation Fruit will act as a medicine that could act as a formless bridge in order to reconnect her broken vitality and ultimately keep Yu’er from suffering from her physique in the future!”

“Then, let’s not delay this matter, let Sister Qin eat it immediately,” Yang Kai hurriedly passed the jade box to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu received the Tribulation Fruit from Yang Kai, gazed at it, then lifted her head again to look at Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang. Seeing their encouraging faces, she did not hesitate anymore. Stretching out her beautiful and delicate fingers, she took out the Tribulation Fruit from the jade box, put it into her mouth and chewed it slowly.

The spirit fruit was ingested into her stomach just like that.

Qin Zhao Yang looked at Qin Yu anxiously, and asked worriedly, “Yu’er, do you feel any discomfort?”

Qin Yu shook her head, “No, I just feel a bit cold... “

Just after she spoke, her face abruptly changed. Her pretty face was almost twisted as she seemed to be suffering from tremendous pain, but at the same time, an extremely extraordinary power began to emerge from her body, forming a layer of bright and transparent white light, enveloping her entirely.

Yang Kai’s expression changed slightly. He used his Divine Sense and saw that the original condensed black Qi around Qin Yu’s body was slowly dissipating into the bright light. Qin Yu’s expression gradually eased as the black Qi slowly disappeared, and a trace of vitality was born from her tender body, diffusing over her limbs.

Witnessing this scene, Yang Kai nodded lightly as he knew that this should be the right solution and Qin Yu would definitely be cured with this.

“Little Brother Yang, this, this, this...” Qin Zhao Yang was in a state of utter stupefaction.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, “Patriarch Qin, let’s go out first. Sister Qin should be fine here, she will just need some time.”

“Are you sure, Little Brother Yang?” Qin Zhao Yang was worried, but he realized he should not question him so he hurriedly explained, “It’s not that this Qin doesn’t believe in you, it’s just... “

“I understand,” Yang Kai smiled. “Patriarch Qin, excessive worrying would cause panic. Just scan Qin Yu’s body with your Divine Sense.”

Qin Zhao Yang immediately acted as he said, and after a while, he sighed in relief.

“So now, can we leave without worry?” Yang Kai slightly smiled.

Qin Zhao Yang was a little embarrassed by his teasing and replied awkwardly, “Yu’er has had a difficult life since her childhood. Her parents passed away in her early years, leaving her the only remaining bloodline of our Qin Family, and she stuck with this Old Master through the difficulties for more than ten years. If she also... “

“I understand,” Yang Kai nodded solemnly.

Both of them left the secret room while talking.

With a flick of his wrist, Yang Kai drew out the Myriads Sword and handed it to Qin Zhao Yang with both hands, “Patriarch Qin, I am returning this sword to the Qin Family. Please accept it.”

Qin Zhao Yang gazed calmly at the Myriads Sword, after a long time reaching out to gently brush its blade as he said, “The Myriad Sword is the legacy of my Qin Family’s ancestors, and also the treasure of my Qin Family. For thousands of years, our ancestors had taken regaining the family’s prestige as their responsibility, with their first goal being gaining enough strength to wield the Myriads Sword once more. However, there were only a few of them who had managed to achieve this, and by the time it was this Old Master’s generation...”

He sighed heavily and continued, “The sword has been covered in dust for centuries now, not seeing the sun nor the sky. If my ancestors in Heaven knew of this, I’m sure they would put all the blame on me.”

Yang Kai responded, “Sister Qin has an extraordinary talent as she has already reached the Origin Returning Realm at only eighteen. After being set free from her suffering this time, she will definitely stand out as a rising star in time.”

Qin Zhao Yang smiled faintly, “This Old Master has pinned all his hopes on Yu’er, so this Old Master would like to ask Little Brother Yang to keep this sword first!”
