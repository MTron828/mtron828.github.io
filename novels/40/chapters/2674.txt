After pausing for a moment, Ying Fei asked, “Which word?”

He was puzzled at the young woman’s words and had no clue what he had said that triggered her. However, Ying Fei was not frightened, for he was also one of the thirty-two Monster Kings of the Ancient Lands. Even if the young woman before him had impressive strength, was he someone who was easy to deal with?

If they really had to fight, Ying Fei was not afraid of her.

At the same time, he scanned the young woman with his Divine Sense to see what her real cultivation was.

Yang Kai was doing the same, but to their great surprise, their Divine Senses were unable to glean anything from the young woman despite the fact that she stood right in front of them. Not to mention her cultivation, they could not even detect her presence.

There were only two possibilities for this. First, the young woman’s cultivation was much higher than Ying Fei and Yang Kai’s, or second, she had a treasure that hindered others from detecting her.

The first possibility was unlikely. Given that Ying Fei was already a Monster King, only a Divine Spirit or Great Emperor could be stronger than him. However, this young woman was too young for her cultivation to have reached such a level. As such, they concluded she had some kind of artifact which shielded her from their perception.

[The background of this young woman is not simple.] Yang Kai thought to himself, wondering where she came from.

“You will know when you speak it again.” The young woman sneered, not answering Ying Fei’s question directly, as if she did not put him in her eyes. Then, she turned to Yang Kai and asked, “What’s your name?”

She seemed to insist on inquiring about Yang Kai’s name.

But before Yang Kai could answer, she suddenly waved her hand, “Forget it, forget it, don’t need to answer.”

“Are you playing with me?” A few veins on Yang Kai’s forehead began to bulge as he thought to himself that this young woman must have some mental problem. For no reason, she blocked their way and kept blabbering like an idiot, which successfully angered Yang Kai.

The young woman snorted coldly, “What worth is there for this Queen to play with the likes of you?”

Yang Kai’s face darkened, “Then who might this illustrious Queen before me be?”

He had seen a lot of arrogant and domineering people, but he had never seen someone like her. She could no longer be described as a person who did not put others in her eyes, but rather someone so arrogant that she ignored the very existence of others.

“The one who wants your life.” The young woman replied coldly.

Yang Kai was stunned, “You want to kill me? Isn’t this just the first time we met? What kind of grievance do you have against me?”

The young woman frowned seriously and nodded, “It’s true that we only meet for the first time, but… you have something that doesn’t belong to you. Something you should not have dared to refine, but since you have, you must die!”

“What?” Yang Kai was bewildered.

“You’ll know after I break all your bones.” After announcing this, the young woman instantly punched towards Yang Kai, her fist seemingly small and delicate, as white as jade with just a hint of pink. This fist moved lightly, as if it was a playful tap that might be used between flirting lovers.

However, as the one facing this punch, Yang Kai’s expression changed drastically as he felt the power behind it.

Space cracked beneath the weight of this blow and a raging vortex of power spiralled towards Yang Kai, pulling him in as it tried to rip him to pieces.

Previously, when the young woman punched Ying Fei, Yang Kai did not feel too much of her power, only noticing that this young woman had incredible strength despite her small size, but when he really faced her himself, he realized that he had greatly underestimated her.

This kind of power was simply beyond what a young woman should be capable of. It would not surprise Yang Kai if Monster King Xi Lei unleashed such power while in his true form, but he could not believe that this power was released by a young woman who appeared only seventeen or eighteen years old.

Yang Kai was astonished as he secretly thought to himself that there were indeed a large number of talents in this world. This young woman who came out of nowhere was already so amazing that it made Yang Kai wonder how many more mighty people could be hiding in this big world.

“Young Master Yang, be careful!” Ying Fei’s face changed drastically. At the same time, he reached out his hand in order to grab the young woman’s fist.

“It’s useless!” Yang Kai’s face turned solemn as he channelled all his strength into his own fist to meet the enemy head-on.

The shadows of two gigantic fists collided in the sky, resulting in a shocking explosion. After a grunt, Ying Fei came to a halt after being forced back several dozen metres. His hand was slightly twisted as his arm shook. Yang Kai also felt that his blood was churning in his chest while his arm clearly had several fresh fractures.

The two of them together failed to stop the raging power of their opponent even with their combined force.

The young woman did not give up after a single punch though and instead threw another towards Yang Kai’s head with a flicker. Looking at her stance, she really wanted to take Yang Kai’s life with this next blow. Although her moves were vicious, her expression was as tranquil as an ancient well, lacking any murderous intent, an extremely unusual sight.

Nevertheless, this did not mean that the little young woman did not want to kill Yang Kai, but rather that her current performance required little effort from her.

When a butcher killed a sheep, would he release murderous intent?

A powerful vortex spun up again, causing Ye Jing Han and Du Xian to scream in terror as they were involuntarily pulled towards the young woman’s fist, as if they were asking for death.

They were not acting of their own will. Rather, this young woman’s cultivation was too high compared to their own, so when she let out her punch, she did not care about their lives and involved them even though they were innocent.

Their Source Qi would not circulate, and they found themselves trapped inside the powerful vortex just like drowning children, unable to escape no matter how hard they tried.

Seeing that their bodies were about to hit the pink fist and to be broken to pieces the next moment, another fist passed by them from behind. The fist was covered in a five coloured light, and it was filled with piercingly cold Sword Qi.

Yang Kai had pushed his Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi to its limits while unleashing all of his Emperor Qi in a rage.

*Hong… *

Yang Kai was thrown back through the air after a loud explosion. His fist was badly mutilated, exposing his bones through his broken flesh. However, when the two punches met, the repulsive force of the collision successfully pushed Ye Jing Han and Du Xian back to him.

*Hua la… *

The terrifying shockwave that hit Yang Kai shredded his clothes into dust, revealing his rippling muscles. Not only that, the towering City Lord’s Mansion was razed to the ground in an instant, and the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect disciples who remained in it were either killed or severely injured.

“Crazy bitch!” Yang Kai glared at the young woman.

The young woman frowned at this sight and did not immediately pursue Yang Kai. She just glanced at his bloody fist with a look of disdain, the corners of her mouth curling upwards slightly.

“Young Master Yang!” Ying Fei immediately returned to Yang Kai’s side, murderous intent flashing across his eyes.

His job in following Yang Kai to the Southern Territory this time was mainly to ensure his safety; after all, Yang Kai was a critical person and if something happened to him, all the Monster Kings in the entire Ancient Wild Lands would not forgive Ying Fei.

He had never imagined that someone would actually wound Yang Kai right in front of his face.

If Xie Wu Wei and Xi Lei learned of this, they would not sit idle and would definitely give him absolute hell.

“Protect them!” Yang Kai tossed Ye Jing Han and Du Xian to Ying Fei before he looked around to check the surroundings.

The recent incident attracted the attention of many Emperor Realm Masters, all of whom flew over and were now watching from a distance. When they saw that it was Yang Kai who was involved in a conflict and was also injured, they all looked delighted and cheered in their hearts.

Because of the arrogant behaviour of Yang Kai at the city gate just a short time ago, many felt resentment towards him. Therefore, they rejoiced to see Yang Kai suffering, especially the old man and the middle-aged man who were humiliated by Yang Kai openly before; they were overjoyed.

However, what puzzled them the most was the identity of the young woman. Despite her youthful appearance, she could actually hurt Yang Kai, astounding everyone who was watching.

“If you want to fight, let’s fight outside.” After a short pause, Yang Kai declared and flew out of the city.

This was still inside Flowing Shadow City after all, and judging from the young woman’s strength, if he really fought with her here, they would certainly hurt the innocent people in the city. Moreover, Yang Kai did not want to expose too much of his strength in front of so many people.

“Good, I can at least let you choose where you want to die,” the young woman nodded in acceptance before following Yang Kai.

“Young Master Yang!” Ying Fei’s face darkened and he started to move to chase after him.

But Yang Kai’s voice came from afar at that moment, “Don’t follow me and don’t allow anyone to come near. It’s just one woman, this Young Master will come back as soon as he settles things with her.”

Ying Fei immediately stopped as he could sense the anger in Yang Kai’s words. This wasn’t surprising though as no one would be in a good mood after being offended for no reason.

However, Yang Kai’s order was tough for him. He was afraid that something would happen to Yang Kai if he did not follow him, but he was also afraid that Yang Kai would not be happy if he disobeyed his instructions.

While he was hesitating, a lot of Emperor Masters began moving in order to catch up with Yang Kai because they did not want to miss the exciting show. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Seeing this, Ying Fei snorted coldly and pushed his Monster Qi.

“Ssii…*

“A Monster King!”

The faces of the Emperor Realm Master all changed drastically, many of them freezing in place as if hit by some kind of petrification technique.

Most of the people here were First-Order Emperor Realm Masters, so it was natural for them to be frightened by the sudden appearance of a Monster King in the city. Monster Kings were comparable to Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters, so if this sharp-eyed man really wanted to initiate a massacre, perhaps no one in the whole Flowing Shadow City could stop him.

“You can try to follow them if you want to die,” Ying Fei swept his eyes across the crowd coldly. Whenever Ying Fei’s gaze fell on them, the Emperor Realm Masters would panic and dared not to make any noise.

As for the Emperor Realm Masters who had a grudge with Yang Kai, they were even more terrified. Previously, at the city gates, this Monster King had been following behind Yang Kai without doing anything, like a servant, but it was only now that they understood that this man was the reason for Yang Kai’s arrogance.

Fortunately, they did not really engage in a fight with Yang Kai, otherwise, they would already be dead.

“Damn…” In a hidden corner, Wu Ming stared in Ying Fei’s direction with a frown, “Why is there a Monster King here?”

The target of the Flowing Shadow City’s auction this time was Yang Kai, and if it was just him, a lone First-Order Emperor, Wu Ming believed that his Honoured Master’s plan would work perfectly. Nevertheless, everything had changed with the sudden emergence of a powerful Monster King.

After a moment of pause, Wu Ming hurriedly turned back to report this finding to his Honoured Master to see what adjustments to the plan would be necessary.

He could not simply ignore the existence of a Monster King.

“This… Sir!” Ye Jing Han and Du Xian were dumbfounded.

Although they had been with Ying Fei for a few days, they never thought that this man who had been like a bodyguard around Yang Kai was actually a Monster King.

Only now did they understand why Yang Kai was so confident to break into the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect alone. It seemed that his biggest dependence was not his own strength, but this Monster King.

With the help of a Monster King, there really was nothing to worry about.
