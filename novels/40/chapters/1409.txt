“What your Junior Sister said is right,” Gong Ao Fu snorted, “A Junior revealing such potential is not a good thing. The tallest tree in the forest is the first to be toppled by the wind. If this boy does not fix his character, he will certainly meet an untimely death. From now on, your Master forbids you to have any further contact with him so as not to implicate my Coloured Glass Sect in any future trouble.”

“Honoured Master!” Dai Yuan was shocked and wanted to say something, but before she could Gong Ao Fu glared at her solemnly, “What’s wrong, are you refusing to listen to your Honoured Master’s command?”

Dai Yuan silently bit her lip, and only after a long pause did she respond, “Disciple will obey Honoured Master’s instructions.”

Seeing this, Gong Ao Fu turned away with satisfaction.

At a different location, two young women stood together staring at Yang Kai, one of them exuded a seductive charm while the other radiated a sense of purity and innocence. But currently, both were frowning, seeming somewhat worried.

These two were not strong, just Saint Kings, and they were standing amongst this big crowd, so it was natural for Yang Kai not to have noticed them. If he were to spot them though, he would be able to recognize them as they were none other than Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying from Clear Sky Sect.

Yang Kai had several encounters with Chen Shi Tao in the past and she had even extended an invitation to him to join Clear Sky Sect, an invitation Yang Kai had politely refused.

It was also thanks to Chen Shi Tao that Yang Kai was able to meet Qian Yue in Black Raven City, redeem her, and bring her back to Dragon Cave Mountain.

These two Clear Sky Sect disciples had followed their Master to Heavenly Fate City to participate in the recent auction and had originally planned on visiting Yang Kai at Dragon Cave Mountain, but had been delayed due to various other matters. Today, they followed their Master to see what all the excitement was about only to discover that Yang Kai was at the centre of this commotion.

Seeing the worrying situation of Dragon Cave Mountain, Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying naturally felt anxious.

Both of them had a very good impression of Yang Kai as he had even saved their lives back in Grand Burial Valley, but despite feeling immense gratitude towards him, their strength was too low so they didn’t possess the right to speak in this situation.

“Senior Sister, it seems he’s in big trouble this time,” Lu Ying said softly.

“En,” Chen Shi Tao nodded unconsciously. She possessed more foresight than Lu Ying, so she understood that if Dragon Cave Mountain did not handle this matter well, it would result in disaster.

“Do you think he can escape this catastrophe?” Lu Ying asked again.

“How am I supposed to know?” Chen Shi Tao smiled bitterly. If she had enough strength, she would not hesitate to help Yang Kai, but as a mere Saint King, she was unable to provide him with any assistance at this time. Nibbling her red lips, she remarked thoughtfully, “His luck has always been good, so perhaps he will again be able to escape unscathed.”

Although the two young women spoke softly, they were still clearly heard by the middle-aged man standing in front of them. This man’s cultivation was exceptional, a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master like Qian Tong and the others present. His distinctive features were his long black hair that would make many women jealous, robust figure, and short cut robes, all of which combined to give him a bit of a wild and uninhibited style.

Turning around with a gentle smile on his face, he beckoned to both Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying.

The two girls exchanged a glance before quickly stepping forward and saluting respectfully, “Honoured Master!”

This man was Clear Sky Sect’s Great Elder Mo Yu, a well-known figure on Shadowed Star comparable in fame to Qian Tong or Fei Zhi Tu. Originally, Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying were not eligible to worship him as their Master, but after achieving great merits in the Flowing Flame Sand Field and bringing immense benefits to the Sect in the form of over a hundred million Saint Crystals, Mo Yu had made an exception and accepted them as disciples. This was a great good fortune for them as the short time Mo Yu spent directing their cultivation had allowed both to rapidly improve their strength.

In fact, the defensive artifact Chen Shi Tao used in Grand Burial Valley, the Nine Palace Heavenly Silk Parasol, was something Mo Yu had given her.

“Do you know that young man?” Mo Yu inquired benignly.

Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying exchanged a nervous glance but didn’t dare lie to their Honoured Master so the former promptly replied, “Yes, Honoured Master. He is the friend I mentioned to you before, the one with blessed with good luck.”

“Oh? Is he the one you mentioned having a great destiny?” Mo Yu raised his brow, showing a look of interest.

“Yes, it’s him!”

“Haha, interesting. Luck and destiny are ethereal concepts, not something a person can decide. Every person encounters good and bad fortune, and it is impossible for one to continuously experience only good luck, similar to how one believes it to be darkest before dawn. Such things are simply frames of mind,” Mo Yu seemed to be speaking to himself but also educating Chen Shi Tao, the latter not daring to interrupt, listening respectfully from the side.

Mo Yu glanced at her lightly and chuckled, “Do you want your Master to speak a few favourable words for him?”

Chen Shi Tao’s tender body shook, but she quickly denied, “Disciple does not dare. Although disciple is a woman, she understands propriety and would not dare ask Honoured Master to interfere in this turbulent situation.”

“Good, very good,” Mo Yu nodded lightly, “The present situation is indeed quite tense, so this old master naturally will not easily wade into these muddy waters.”

While Mo Yu looked middle-aged, he had lived many years longer than that, so claiming to be an old master was not inappropriate. Mo Yu soon said with a smile, “But this old master is quite curious. If his luck is as good as you claim, perhaps he will be able to turn danger into safety here. If he can accomplish it, this old master will believe he really holds a great destiny, and you can interact more frequently with him in the future.”

“Yes,” Chen Shi Tao smiled happily, but when she remembered how dire the current situation was, her pretty face could not help showing a trace of worry.

Regardless of anything else, she owed Yang Kai a live-saving grace, but now she was only able to stand back and wait while he was in danger, causing her to feel both uneasy and ashamed.

“However, if he is unable to overcome this calamity... En, there’s not much more to say. For now, just stay here and watch the situation with your Master.” Mo Yu chuckled.

Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying looked at each other helplessly, only able to do as Mo Yu said.

In Dragon Cave Mountain, Yang Kai stood behind the outermost layer of the Mountain Defending Array and cupped his fists slightly, “With several Senior arriving here today, in principle, Junior should invite you inside to offer some hospitality, but my small mountain has just experienced a battle so Junior has many things he must deal with. Therefore, I will have to ask the many Seniors to forgive my lack of courtesy. Please leave!”

Yang Kai didn’t want to bother with any more nonsense, so he directly told everyone who had gathered here to leave.

Everyone understood what he meant, but none of them had any intention of moving, especially Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng, both of whom were glaring at Yang Kai as if they wanted to tear him to pieces. In fact, if not for having scruples about Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, the two of them would likely have immediately attacked.

Still, it was impossible for them to simply leave like this; after all, their two Sects had suffered heavy losses this time. If they were to back down now, what face would they have in the future? Yang Kai also understood this truth, but he had to make his situation and intentions clear regardless, and that was, if these two moved rashly, he would occupy the righteous position and Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu would be able to intervene without damaging Shadow Moon Hall’s reputation.

Seeing that no one left, Yang Kai sneered and said out loud, “What’s wrong? Could it be that the several Seniors have taken a liking to this Junior’s little hill, like the Xie Family?”

“Boy, don’t try to make false accusations. Since we old masters have gathered here, shouldn’t you invite us inside, as a Junior? That is the appropriate way to treat guests,” Jin Shi coldly snorted.

Many masters hearing this also nodded lightly. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Although they had no grievances with Yang Kai or Dragon Cave Mountain and had purely come here to seek some entertainment this time, after learning about the power of Dragon Cave Mountain’s Spirit Arrays, they all wanted to go in and take a closer look.

So even if Jin Shi had ulterior motives, they were willing to agree with him for now.

As long as they entered Dragon Cave Mountain, with just Yang Kai’s ability, could he stop them from examining the various Spirit Arrays and barriers? As for whether Dragon Cave Mountain would be allowing disaster into their home, why should they care?

“Old Ghost Jin, you still want to act shamelessly? The other side has already said that they have many things to process and it is inconvenient to entertain guests right now, even going so far as to apologize for their lack of hospitality, so how is your insistence anything but trying to bully others with your status? If you are really so desperate for entertainment, Heavenly Fate City is just fifty kilometres from here, this old master will host you there,” Qian Tong shot Jin Shi a disgruntled look as he spat.

This place was still well inside Shadow Moon Hall’s jurisdiction, so Jin Shi not giving Yang Kai any face was equivalent to not putting Shadow Moon Hall in his eyes, an idea that greatly annoyed Qian Tong.

“Naturally, I will visit Heavenly Fate City, but this boy’s pretentious attitude bothers me greatly. It’s like he doesn’t put us in his eyes at all,” Jin Shi shot back, seemingly unwilling to give up.

“Stop trying to find a pretext to act. If you’re intent on causing trouble, this old master will accompany you!” Qian Tong snorted, his expression becoming gloomy.

Perceiving how resolute Qian Tong’s stance was, Jin Shi could not help frowning. He did not know what kind of relationship Qian Tong and Yang Kai had that would make the former not hesitate to offend him, but it seemed that if he continued to push the issue, it would end poorly for him.

However, leaving like this was also inappropriate.

Intentionally or unintentionally, Jin Shi glanced over at Old Woman Feng and saw that the other party’s face was gloomy, and her eyes were filled with murderous intent as she stared at Yang Kai. But just as he was about to drag Old Woman Feng into this dispute, a shocking aura suddenly appeared on the horizon and rapidly closed in on their position.

Jin Shi’s complexion changed dramatically, and he hurriedly choked down his words as he turned to face this newcomer.

Everyone else also did the same.

Of the masters present, nearly twenty of them had reached the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, but even with their great strength, they could tell that the approaching master was not someone affable, causing them to reveal looks of amazement and wariness.

Only Old Black-Face Yan Pei showed a confused look on his face as he muttered to himself, “Why did she come?”

He would have never thought this person would show her face here.

In the distance, a blue light quickly approached, and a moment later, this blue light flashed and stopped a dozen or so metres from the gathered crowd, dispersed, and revealed two figures.

One male, one female.

The woman was clearly the leader of this pair and wore a deep green dress. Her long hair was done up in a delicate bun, revealing her slender white neck, giving her graceful and elegant bearing while her pair of sharp phoenix eyes exuded an innate, commanding majesty, making others not dare stare into them for too long.

This woman had the aura of a mature thirty or forty-year-old, but that did not make her any less alluring. Although slightly older, she had maintained her appearance impeccably with delicate white skin, slender figure, and an enchanting body line that could easily provoke the hidden desires of any man.

But at this time, none present dared belittle or blaspheme this woman, because the pressure she gave off alone was enough to deter such thoughts.

Compared to an ordinary Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, this woman was clearly far more powerful.
