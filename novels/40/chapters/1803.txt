As if he was struck by lightning, Lu Gui Chen’s body flew backwards suddenly as he coughed up a mouthful of blood, falling to the ground in the next moment like a dead fish.

After landing, he quickly got up, looked at Yang Kai in terror, and trembled, “You... impossible!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He had not checked Yang Kai’s cultivation before because, in his opinion, Yang Kai was definitely not as strong as himself; after all, this little brat was only a Saint the last time they met, and he had enjoyed a rich cultivation environment on this floating continent for all these years. The aura here was incredibly dense and there were countless precious treasures, so Lu Gui Chen’s rate of cultivation had been terrifying. He was countless times stronger than this little brat back then, so how could this boy be his opponent now?

He had dismissed Yang Kai from the start!

But when he was counterattacked by Yang Kai just now, Lu Gui Chen instantly realized he was mistaken.

This little brat’s Saint Qi was more powerful and purer than his own by many times. If his own Second-Order Origin Returning Realm Saint Qi was like a firefly, this brat’s Saint Qi was akin to the bright moon!

This was simply unacceptable to Lu Gui Chen!

[Could this brat already be an Origin King?]

Only now did he use his Divine Sense to check Yang Kai.

“Third-Order Origin Returning Realm!” After confirming Yang Kai’s realm, Lu Gui Chen’s complexion changed drastically and he fell to the ground again, losing all ability to think and only muttering “How is that possible?” over and over again.

He couldn’t believe what he felt. It had only been a few dozen years, yet this boy had jumped all the way from the Saint Realm to the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm!

Such terrifying cultivation speed and aptitude!

Was time slowed down in this damned place? Had the several dozen years he spent here actually been hundreds of years on the outside? If that weren’t the case, how could this boy have such terrifying cultivation?

All kinds of bizarre thoughts flashed across Gui Chen’s mind as he was left in a state of complete shock.

Seeing Lu Gui Chen in such a bereaved condition, Yang Kai could not help but sneer, “Ignorant fool!”

Lu Gui Chen was not highly ranked in Purple Star, so the information he had access to was limited. In fact, it was not just Yang Kai, even Gu Jian Xin and Zi Dong had similar cultivation speeds.

Of course, if a comparison was really made, even they were inferior to Yang Kai.

After all, they had great forces backing them, with no need to worry about cultivation resources or masters to teach them.

On the contrary, Yang Kai had made his way all on his own, relying on himself to obtain his resources and the occasional hint from some noble elders. Simply regarding this, Yang Kai felt that the Young Masters from these great forces were not comparable to him. On top of that, because he had to constantly rely on himself and his own explorations, his understanding of the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao was much deeper.

Narrowing his eyes, Yang Kai curled his lips and said, “I didn’t kill you back then, but now, I regret it a bit.”

Lu Gui Chen could not help shivering as his dazed expression focused again and he coldly snorted, “What do you want?”

Even if Yang Kai’s cultivation was one Minor Realm higher than his own, so what? Lu Gui Chen felt that Yang Kai might not be able to kill him easily if he tried his best, so after he recovered, his tone became firm.

“Judging from your aura, you must have taken a lot of precious treasures over these years, right? Tsk tsk... But from the quality of your Saint Qi, it is clear there are many impurities in your body. It seems you have been swallowing those herbs raw. Don’t you know that doing that will waste their medicinal efficacies and slowly poison you?”

Listening to Yang Kai speak, Lu Gui Chen’s eyes flashed with some slight panic, because he found this boy’s analysis absolutely correct.

These years, he had been all alone on this floating continent with nothing to do other than cultivate. His first few years had been spent looking for a way to escape, but as time passed, he gave up on this idea. Even a master like Gui Zu had been trapped here for two thousand years, so how was he supposed to escape?

After thinking about it for a time, Lu Gui Chen focused himself on improving his strength, hoping to one day reach a point where he could shatter space and escape this damned place.

And to enhance the strength, he thought of using those precious herbs.

But he was not an Alchemist, so even if he managed to collect the herbs on the floating continent he couldn’t refine them into pills and could only swallow them raw like a Monster Beast.

The result of this practice was that the medicinal efficacies of the herbs piled up in his body, and they became challenging to purge over time. Now, these leftover impurities had begun to affect his cultivation, causing his meridians to feel sore every time he circulated his Saint Qi.

He did not know what the consequences of this would be in the long run, but he could at least understand that it was not a good sign.

Now that his situation had been exposed by Yang Kai, Lu Gui Chen’s eyes could not help lighting up, “Since you know about my condition, do you know a way to resolve it?”

“So what if I do?” Yang Kai snorted, clearly not putting Lu Gui Chen in his eyes.

“Teach me!”

“Haha!” Yang Kai laughed, “Are you trying to make a joke? I haven’t even settled accounts with you yet.”

He had been captured by Purple Star’s cultivators, and Lu Gui Chen had sealed his Saint Qi, almost causing him to die. Yang Kai could never forgive this slight.

“It’s been so many years since then, why bother bringing up such trivial matters? What’s more, didn’t you survive? Teach me how to resolve this issue and there will be benefits in it for you,” Lu Gui Chen said anxiously.

Yang Kai snorted, swept his eyes over him, and frowned slightly, “Where’s your Space Ring? You’ve been here for so many years so you must have collected a lot of rare herbs, right? Where are they?”

“Space Ring? What damned Space Ring!?” Lu Gui Chen exclaimed, “Don’t you remember that Gui Zu took away everyone’s rings back then?”

“Ah... Right, that happened. I forgot,” Yang Kai suddenly realized that in order to refine his Space Array, Gui Zu had confiscated everyone’s Space Rings to extract the little bit of Space Spirit Crystal they were refined from.

In the end, his experiment ended in complete failure though...

“Since you have no Space Ring, you must have hidden all the good things...” Yang Kai looked at Lu Gui Chen.

“What do you want...” Lu Gui Chen’s complexion sank, looking at Yang Kai’s expression as if he was looking at a robber, vigilant to the extreme. “I’ll tell you this now: Those things have indeed been hidden by me, and in a very safe, secretive location. Without me, you’ll never be able to find them no matter how long you search.”

“Now, now, don’t be so nervous,” Yang Kai chuckled. “Let me guess. In this place, the only available residence is that cave mansion left behind by Gui Zu. You should have lived there all these years, so those herbs...”

Lu Gui Chen remained perfectly calm, not showing the slightest panic, staring at Yang Kai with a light sneer.

“Naturally, they can’t be there,” Yang Kai continued.

The smile on Lu Gui Chen’s face diminished in that instant as he became a little startled, not having expected Yang Kai to be so sharp.

“A cunning rabbit has three burrows, you certainly wouldn’t place all your treasures in one place,” Yang Kai laughed.

“Hmph, you think you’re so smart? So what if you know I didn’t hide them there? Although this place isn’t that big, it’s still vast enough to easily hide something. If you do not tell me how to solve my problem, don’t even think about getting anything from me. Let me say this now, all the useful herbs on this continent have been collected by me. If you want to reap any gains here, it will be at least a hundred years before it becomes possible again,” Lu Gui Chen explained, saying pointedly, “You stayed here for a while back then so you should know just how many Origin King Grade herbs grew here. Those herbs were too powerful for me to digest with my current strength, so I preserved them all instead. As long as you agree to my requirements, all of those things can be yours.”

“Are you threatening me?” Yang Kai looked at him faintly and coldly snorted, “No matter, I won’t waste my time with you. I don’t want those precious herbs to go to waste, but since you refuse to cooperate... just die.”

There were, admittedly, a lot of good things on the floating continent, and Yang Kai really did not want to see them all go to waste, but he decisively gave up on them after seeing Lu Gui Chen’s attitude.

In any case, his harvest in the medicine valley of the Severed World was already big enough, so the herbs on the floating continent were just icing on the cake.

As soon as his words fell, Yang Kai stretched out his hand to eject two Golden Blood Threads, which quickly transformed into two strange Monster Beasts.

These were Blood Beasts, the Tail Crown Snake and Star King Turtle that Yang Kai had condensed in the Severed World.

These two Monster Beasts were both at the peak of the Ninth-Order, and although their strength had fallen a bit after becoming Blood Beasts, they had solid foundations so it would not be a problem for them to deal with a trivial Second-Order Origin Returning Realm Lu Gui Chen.

As soon as the Blood Beasts appeared, they rushed towards Lu Gui Chen fiercely.

“What are those?” Lu Gui Chen was shocked as he stared at the two ferocious Blood Beasts in amazement. He couldn’t recognize what kind of creatures these two Monster Beasts were and shouted, “Little brat, do you really want to kill to the last? Aren’t you afraid that those precious herbs will disappear from this world with me?”

“You treat them as treasures, but in my eyes, they’re just disposable items,” Yang Kai chuckled lightly, not caring.

Lu Gui Chen was really panicked right now. He thought that Yang Kai would be tempted by those Origin King Grade herbs, so he dared to negotiate terms without fear, but now it seemed that his life-saving card was useless. Facing the terrifying aura emanating from these two Blood Beasts, how could he remain calm?

He would not be a match for either of these two Blood Beasts.

“Young Hero, please wait! I have something to say!” Lu Gui Chen retreated quickly, avoiding the attacks of the Tail Crown Snake and Star King Turtle as he shouted, “This Lu is willing to offer those things freely to Young Hero, just spare my life please!”

“Isn’t it a bit late now?” Yang Kai remained unmoved and spat lightly, “Kill him!”

*Sisi...*

*Hou...*

The Tail Crown Snake and Star King Turtle flanked Lu Gui Chen from left and right as they charged towards him. Seeing himself trapped, Lu Gui Chen cried out in horror, “Don’t kill me, I can tell you a big secret about this continent. One that will allow your future achievements to be limitless!”

Yang Kai frowned, and the movements of the two Blood Beasts stopped under his command.

At this time, the Tail Crown Snake’s fangs were less than a metre away from Lu Gui Chen while the tail of the Star King Turtle continued to sweep over him but just barely changed direction in time to miss his head.

The strong wind blew past Lu Gui Chen, causing cold sweat to drip from his forehead.

He had nearly crossed the threshold of the gates of death just now!
