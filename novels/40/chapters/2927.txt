“Still, Senior Brother Qiu and the others are there!” Yang Kai said.

Gao Xue Ting wasn’t so sure, “Senior Brother Qiu and the others may be strong, but what I’m worried about is that they might fall for the Demon Spirit’s tricks since they don’t know about them. We can’t get in contact with them now, and we have no idea what the situation is at the temple. You said you saw Gong Yue on Spirit Sword Peak, but why would he be there?”

“I’m curious about that too,” Yang Kai shook his head. Azure Sun Temple had many spirit peaks, but Gong Yue had to choose Spirit Sword Peak among all of them. Yang Kai even suspected that he was purposefully getting revenge on him because he had hindered the resurgence of the Demon Spirits inside the Ancient Cave Mansion.

But that didn’t seem right either. If it was purely for revenge, then Gong Yue couldn’t take such a huge risk.

“Senior Sister, what did you mean when you said that Temple Master was occupied with something?”

Gao Xue Ting was silent for a moment, as if she was deliberating, and only answered after a short pause, “Since you’re already a temple Elder, there’s no reason not to tell you. Do you still remember when you tried to use the Divine Ascension Mirror last time, but I stopped you?”

“Of course I remember. What does that have to do with this though?” Yang Kai didn’t understand.

“It’s Temple Master.” Gao Xue Ting explained, “I told you at the time that someone was using the Divine Ascension Mirror, and that he was not to be disturbed. Do you know who it is?”

This was also something that perplexed Yang Kai when it happened. The Divine Ascension Mirror was considered Azure Sun Temple Sect’s Supreme Artifact, and the core of its heritage and foundation. It was precisely because of the existence of the Divine Ascension Mirror that the Masters in the temple had stronger Soul cultivation than ordinary; however, it wasn’t so easy for one to enter the Divine Ascension Mirror to cultivate. Generally, disciples needed to attain great achievements to obtain a chance to go as a rare reward. Even as an elder, one had to pay 3,000 Elder Contribution Points to enter, and no one was exempt.

Elder Contribution Points were hard to come by, and 3,000 wasn’t a small amount either. Moreover, as a newly conferred Elder, Yang Kai naturally had no such points.

Now though, it seemed Gao Xue Ting did not stop him because his Elder Contribution Points weren’t sufficient, but because someone was using the Divine Ascension Mirror.

Yang Kai was curious who it was back then, but since he wasn’t in a rush, he didn’t pursue the matter.

However, he didn’t expect Gao Xue Ting to bring up this matter at this time.

“Who?” Yang Kai asked with a frown. He had the vague feeling that this person was probably someone very important.

“That person is closely related to Temple Master. It can even be said that he raised Temple Master and trained him personally.” Gao Xue Ting glanced sideways at Yang Kai, not mentioning the person directly by name.

But Yang Kai’s body shook and the image of a person immediately came to mind as he exclaimed in realization, “So it’s him!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Gao Xue Ting looked curiously at him, “You’re much calmer about this than I expected.”

Yang Kai vaguely realized what was going on and asked, “Did that Sir enter the Divine Ascension World to try to separate their Souls?”

Gao Xue Ting’s tender body trembled as he turned to Yang Kai in astonishment, “How do you know about that?”

Even she did not know too much about this secret. It was only because Wen Zi Shan had inadvertently leaked a few words about it in front of her that she was able to guess it. However, she didn’t expect Yang Kai to make this connection in a single go. No one could have such a terrifying deduction ability, unless Yang Kai knew something about it beforehand.

Yang Kai smiled bitterly, “The reason that Sir became like that actually has a little to do with me.”

“With you?” Gao Xue Ting was even more confused and stared at Yang Kai as if she were a tireless student seeking to learn about a domain she had never stepped foot in before.

Yang Kai briefly described what happened in the Shattered Star Sea to her, then he added, “It was by coincidence that I encountered what I did, and luck that I made it out alive, but as a result of many those many twists and turns, that Sir now seems to have a firm connection ‘that’ Sir’s Soul, forcing them to share one body. I didn’t expect him to come back to the temple… no, that’s right, the Divine Ascension Mirror is a world of Souls, and Senior Tian Yan is also there. They may really be able to find a way to separate their Souls in there.”

“So that’s how it is!” Gao Xue Ting was stunned. All the things she couldn’t understand before became clear after receiving Yang Kai’s explanation, but she never thought that this matter would be related to him, and that he had the honour of being involved in a battle between two Great Emperors. Even though both Great Emperors were not at their peak during that fight, it still wasn’t an opportunity that just anyone could encounter.

The most shocking part was that Yang Kai also played a role in it. If not for his efforts, then that Sir’s Soul may have been extinguished and perished along with the enemy. Even though the current situation didn’t look good, at least their lives were retained. As long as they were alive, they were bound to be able to find a way to separate.

It was because of that person’s sensitive identity that Yang Kai was not able to use the Divine Ascension Mirror during that time.

Gao Xue Ting went on, “It seems they haven’t made much progress though, so Temple Master himself went in to help. Right now, Temple Master’s Soul is in the Divine Ascension Mirror and he knows nothing about what’s going on outside. If Gong Yue really silently infiltrated the temple, the others may not have been able to notice at all.”

“So that’s how it is!” Yang Kai nodded, understanding Gao Xue Ting’s worries.

After ending his Divine Sense conversation with Gao Xue Ting, Yang Kai opened his eyes and declared, “I’m going to use my teleportation technique to speed up, please do not resist if you feel any discomfort.”

Chen Wen Hao and Feng Ming gently nodded at his words and looked curiously towards Yang Kai.

Even though they had long heard that Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space, just like that Sir from Spirit Beast Island, they had never seen it with their own eyes. This sort of mysterious power wasn’t something that could be witnessed casually, especially from a Master like Yang Kai.

So, they all looked on with great interest and waited in silence.

Space Principles surged from Yang Kai and enveloped the entire Flowing Clouds Shuttle. If the others had not been warned about it beforehand, then Chen Wen Hao and Feng Ming definitely would have resisted after sensing this change; however, they were informed and knew what Yang Kai was trying to do, so they relaxed and did not interfere with the flow of his Principle Strength.

The Flowing Clouds Shuttle seemed to shake slightly, and in the next moment, a sense of vertigo washed over Chen Wen Hao and Feng Ming, as well as a kind of desolate fear, like they had suddenly fallen into a bottomless abyss where they could neither hear, see, nor touch anything.

But that feeling was very short-lived, disappearing in just the blink of an eye.

At the same time, the Flowing Clouds Shuttle re-emerged a thousand kilometres away.

Chen Wen Hao and Feng Ming exchanged glances, both of them clearly seeing the astonishment in the other’s eyes.

They had heard rumours that cultivators proficient in the Dao of Space were unmatched when it came to escaping, and now it seemed that the rumours were true. They were both Second-Order Emperors, but it was still impossible for them to move a thousand kilometres in an instant. Perhaps with the help of some special artifacts they could achieve a similar feat, but it definitely wouldn’t be as smooth as what Yang Kai just did.

With such a Divine Ability, as long as he wasn’t trapped inside a sealed space, who in the world could stop Yang Kai from coming and going as he pleased?

No wonder Flower Shadow Great Emperor failed to take down that man from Spirit Beast Island despite far exceeding his strength during her pursuit. Masters of the Dao of Space were as slippery as a loach. If the first strike misses, then it would be impossible to catch their tracks after that.

The Flowing Clouds Shuttle constantly shook, vanishing and then reappearing a thousand kilometres into the distance after each tremble.

The three other Masters in the shuttle were increasingly in awe of Yang Kai’s Space Technique.

At the beginning, Yang Kai’s aura was strong and steady, his face calm and collected, but he gradually began to struggle as time went on. The amount of energy drained from him to instantaneously move three Emperor Realm Masters and an Emperor Artifact at the same time was immense.

But they were in an urgent situation right now, so Yang Kai couldn’t care too much about this excessive consumption. His only thought was to rush back to the temple as soon as possible.

Half a day later, he stuffed a handful of Spirit Pills into his mouth before signalling Gao Xue Ting to take over control of the Flowing Clouds Shuttle. Then, he sat down cross-legged to adjust his breathing.

Chen Wen Hao and Feng Ming could see clearly that all of the Spirit Pills Yang Kai stuffed into his mouth were Emperor Pills. Each one of them was worth a fortune, but he chewed them just like candy before swallowing them all down.

Even if the two of them had always been in high positions, seeing this still made their faces twitch as they cursed this black sheep in their hearts.

Their gazes next turned to the Flowing Clouds Shuttle they were riding, which was clearly a flight type Emperor Artifact of immeasurable value. Even they did not possess such a treasure.

They couldn’t figure it out no matter how they racked their brains. How did this boy manage to amass such a huge fortune despite being so young? Compared to him, they were simply no different from poor country bumpkins. Where was their dignity as Second-Order Emperors?

The three people took turns to control the Flower Clouds Shuttle, so the consumption was not too big and they were able to maintain their peak state so that they could deal with any possible dangers.

Once Yang Kai was done recovering and able to use his Space Principles again, their speed once again rapidly increased.

With that, the four of them arrived at Azure Sun Mountain Range after three days.

Sweeping through the mountain range with their Divine Senses, they didn’t find anything unusual. It looked just like usual, with many disciples of the temple doing their jobs around the staggered peaks. There were simply no signs of an attack having been made.

This allowed Yang Kai and Gao Xue Ting, who were anxious the whole time, to finally breathe a sigh of relief.

The Flowing Clouds Shuttle stopped in front of the Sect Defending Array, and the four exited. But instantly, Gao Xue Ting noticed something wrong.

A strange barrier had appeared right outside the Sect Defending Array. The barrier wasn’t very strong, and was very well-hidden, so if not for Gao Xue Ting’s understanding of the Sect’s protective barrier, she may not have been able to tell it was there at all.

And, from the traces of the barrier, she could see that it was clearly set up just a few days ago.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment before taking out his Jade Elder Token and pouring his Divine Sense into it. After some probing, he quickly said, “It was Gong Yue’s doing. It was this barrier that blocked our connection with the temple.”

“That abominable bastard!” Gao Xue Ting gritted her teeth, the Radiant Sun Mirror appearing above her head and releasing a blazing ray of light towards the barrier.

With a bang, the ground began to shake, and the thin and weak barrier was immediately broken.

“Which bastard dares… uh, Elder Gao, Elder Yang?”

A disciple flew out from inside in an aggressive state; however, he immediately shrivelled up as soon as he saw Gao Xue Ting and quickly bowed.

“Has there been anything unusual about the temple these past few days?” Gao Xue Ting asked the disciple.

The disciple didn’t dare to look at her and he had no idea why he was asked this question, but still answered promptly, “Everything is as usual.”

Gao Xue Ting didn’t ask anything more. She knew this disciple knew nothing, so she quickly urged, “To Spirit Sword Peak!”

As she turned around and rushed out, she sent a message into her Jade Elder Token to alert the others.
