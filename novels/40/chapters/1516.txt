[A strong enemy!] Qu Zheng secretly thought. He had heard about this strange creature and how even a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master could not take a head-on attack from it, but he didn’t know whether this was true or not though.

Before he could finish his thoughts, Yang Kai raised his hand again and the Verdant Dragon Bone Sword appeared. Pouring Saint Qi into the bone sword, a giant dark-green dragon quickly manifested and floated beside Yang Kai, it’s two giant eyes staring down imposingly at the crowd below.

The Dragon Pressure that instantly covered the hall caused everyone to tremble.

Golden Blood Threads appeared next, releasing a dazzling golden radiance.

A loud bird cry rang out as the Firebird Artifact Spirit flew out and spread its wings, raising the temperature in the hall significantly.

Yang Kai was going all out!

Although the people in front of him had already lost their will to fight, Yang Kai didn’t dare to underestimate them. In a one-against-many scenario, Yang Kai could not afford to let his guard down, especially since Qu Zheng was still unharmed.

Yang Kai had never fought Qu Zheng personally, but he had witnessed the latter’s power in Fallen Emperor Mountain.

That Great Sun Radiant Seal had particularly impressed him.

As such, once he decided to take action, Yang Kai had brought out eighty percent of his methods.

“Union Master Qu, when you plotted against this Junior, did you ever think the situation would wind up like this?” Yang Kai looked down at Qu Zheng coldly, “You and I had no meaningful grudge between us, but Union Master Qu insisted on embarrassing me, so he should be prepared to face my revenge. En, I’ll quickly send you to meet with Qu Chang Feng. Fathers and sons should be together, after all, and I think Qu Chang Feng should be quite lonely right now!”

“Arrogant little brat!” Qu Zheng’s expression suddenly became ferocious, like a mad beast.

The death of Qu Chang Feng was the greatest pain his heart had ever had to bear! Naturally, he knew his child best, and although Qu Chang Feng was a little domineering and flippant, his aptitude was first-class and he would surely have become a true hegemon if given time.

Yet before such a bright future could come to pass, Qu Chang Feng had been brutally killed by Yang Kai in Fallen Emperor Mountain.

At this moment, with the murderer casually standing before him, even a stoic man wouldn’t have been able to control their rage, let alone Qu Zheng who had a naturally fiery temperament.

“Good, good, good, you go too far, little brat! If this old master doesn’t kill you today, he would no longer be a man!” Qu Zheng yelled.

Mo Xiao Sheng felt the situation deteriorating. A battle between masters was always extremely dangerous, but now, Union Master Qu had been completely provoked and thrown into a rage with just a few words; how was he going to exert his full strength in such a state? But as things were, the only thing Mo Xiao Sheng could do was endure the severe pain from his wound and shout, “Yang Kai, you look down on my Heaven Battling Union too much! Since you dared to break into this place alone, it shall be your burial place. Everyone, with me! Today, either he dies, or we perish!”

With these words, the rest of the people summoned their artifacts one after another, filling the room with a dazzling glow as the ambient energy began to churn.

Liang Yong’s movements were the fastest, summoning a long, sword-like artifact into his hands and madly pouring his Saint Qi into it. Staring at Yang Kai fiercely, he roared, “Boy, suffer death!”

As he shouted, the long sword in Lian Yong’s hands glowed a cyan light and shot a wave out towards Yang Kai.

At the same time, the others also displayed the power of their artifacts one after another, firing them towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai remained indifferent though, not even attempting to dodge, simply observing coldly as if he didn’t feel any threat at all.

*Peng peng peng...*

Xiao Xiao struck his chest repeatedly, causing a dull sound to ring out as he opened his mouth and growled like a mad gorilla. As he struck his chest, Xiao Xiao’s small figure suddenly grew larger, and a several-dozen-metre tall giant stood before Yang Kai in an instant.

In the next instant, the various artifact attacks landed on Xiao Xiao’s body and burst into dazzling explosions of light, the clanging and clattering sounds constantly echoing, but not only did Xiao Xiao not show any intention to retreat, he even remained essentially uninjured. All that happened under this bombardment was Xiao Xiao being forced to take a single step backwards.

Stone Puppets’ innate Divine Ability was to swallow ore, which they could then smelt and refine into their purest form. However, they could also absorb these essences and use them to strengthen themselves.

Over the years, Xiao Xiao had swallowed countless ores, most of which were extremely rare and high-quality. Not only had he provided great assistance to Yang Yan with her Artifact Refining, but he had also obtained great nourishment and growth.

Although these attacks were terrifying, using them against Xiao Xiao was completely ineffective.

The hardness of Xiao Xiao’s body was as tough as an Origin King Grade defensive artifact.

Suddenly, among the clattering explosions, Qu Zheng’s muffled cough and enraged roar rang out.

Everyone frowned, wondering what happened to Qu Zheng.

Even Yang Kai was at a loss.

As the glow from the explosions dissipated, Yang Kai gazed past Xiao Xiao’s giant body and looked towards Qu Zheng, his expression turning somewhat strange in the next instant.

He found that Qu Zheng’s chest had half a sword sticking out from it, obviously having been run through from behind. Covered in blood, Qu Zheng couldn’t help staggering forward, his face extremely pale.

The sword which pierced him was clearly of extraordinary quality, definitely an artifact at or above Origin Grade Mid-Rank. The blade of the sword was covered in a brilliant cyan light that continuously burst with terrifying power as it destroyed the inside of Qu Zheng’s body, rapidly worsening his condition.

Now far from Qu Zheng, Liang Yong wore a complicated look on his face, as if feeling a little guilty.

“Liang Yong, you dare betray us?” Mo Xiao Sheng turned and stared at Liang Yong in disbelief, shouting out mournfully as he did.

Qu Zheng also turned a sullen look to Liang Yong and coughed as he grit his teeth and asked, “When did he buy you over? Was it back on Fallen Emperor Mountain?”

Liang Yong’s face twitched as he glanced over at Yang Kai for an instant before saying in a bitter voice, “Sect Master Yang never bought This Liang, but... A wise man knows when to submit to the circumstances. Union Master and Great Elder insisting on fighting against the tide has brought disaster to the Union. This Liang, as Third Elder, cannot sit by and watch everything our ancestors worked so hard for be destroyed at your hands!”

“Self-righteous nonsense. Seeking personal gain so shamelessly, this King never knew you were such a person, Liang Yong,” Qu Zheng sneered.

Qu Zheng never imagined that he would actually be stabbed in the back by his own Third Elder at this critical moment. If Liang Yong’s signature long sword artifact had not still been sticking out of his body, Qu Zheng might still not believe this was really happening.

“It doesn’t matter if you didn’t know this before, Union Master should be able to understand it today,” Liang Yong’s face was red with embarrassment, but if he wanted to survive, this was his only option.

The others here might not know how terrifying Yang Kai’s strength was, but he did.

Regardless of how many people were on their side, if they really fought here, it would not be an easy battle, and even if they could defeat Yang Kai, they couldn’t kill him.

The means Yang Kai already showed were appalling enough, so just how much was he still holding back? The last time he experienced Yang Kai’s methods, Liang Yong was lucky enough to survive, but he didn’t want to try his luck again.

“Promising!” Yang Kai grinned suddenly. He hadn’t expected the situation to develop this way either, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t to his liking. Although he was confident he could kill all the people here, it would definitely be difficult and require him to use most of his means and methods. Now that his enemies were actually fighting amongst themselves, the problem became much easier to solve.

“Sect Master Yang is too kind,” Liang Yong cupped his fists with and said with a flattering look covering his face. Immediately after, Liang Yong looked around at the others present and shouted, “Smart birds choose the best trees to roost on, I believe this Liang does not need to teach you all this. As for what you should do now, you should also understand!”

The remaining Heaven Battling Union cultivators wore ugly expressions as they glanced around at each other, temporarily falling into a dilemma.

However, no one treated their life as expendable, so all of them turned their gazes towards Qu Zheng and Mo Xiao Sheng in the end while silently condensing their Saint Qi.

“Excellent!” Qu Zheng laughed, “I didn’t expect that my Heaven Battling Union had raised a pack of white wolves. This Qu was blind to have never seen your true colours.”

“Why must Union Master put it like that?” Liang Yong slowly shook his head, “The winner is the king while the loser is the villain. What do you want to do, Great Elder? This Liang has always admired Great Elder’s wisdom and fortitude, if Great Elder is willing to...”

“Do you think this old master is as shameless as you? All of you should not shame this old master,” Mo Xiao Sheng sneered, interrupting Liang Yong before he could even finish speaking.

“In that case, I must ask Great Elder and Union Master to depart together!” Liang Yong’s eyes became sharp as he waved his hand and in the next moment, all the attacks which had originally been targeting Yang Kai were now directed towards Qu Zheng and Mo Xiao Sheng.

Without any suspense, after a half cup of tea’s time, the battle was decided.

Mo Xiao Sheng had lost an arm, and although such an injury was not life-threatening, it still had a significant impact on the strength he could display. As for Qu Zheng, he had suffered a sneak attack from Liang Yong, a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master, and had only survived this long thanks to his great strength.

Both of them were wounded, so how could they withstand the attacks of Liang Yong and the others?

Yang Kai didn’t even need to take action as Heaven Battling Union’s Union Master and Great Elder were killed before him.

Naturally, Yang Kai didn’t relax his vigilance, keeping the giant dark-green dragon floating beside him with the Firebird Artifact Spirit circling above while the Stone Puppet protected his front.

As soon as the battle was over, Liang Yong sent a signal with his eyes to a certain cultivator who immediately understood and pounced towards another of their companions, a Second-Order Origin Realm Protector, and swiftly killed him.

Yang Kai simply observed with a smile, not showing any intention to intervene.

“Reporting to Sect Master Yang, Protector Liu was a close friend of the Union Master, so although he had outwardly surrendered, he must have been holding a grudge in his heart. No one knows whether he would simply wait for an opportunity to avenge Union Master in the future, so we’ve taken the liberty to deal with him now,” Liang Yong took the initiative to explain.

“Cruel and merciless!” Yang Kai smiled and nodded, “It seems I looked down on you, Elder Liang.”

“Sect Master Yang is too polite,” Liang Yong let out a hollow laugh.

“What about these remaining people?”

“These people should be fine.”

“En,” Yang Kai stared at him deeply, an ambiguous smile creeping onto his lips as he said, “Did Elder Liang not consider that this Sect Master would simply take advantage of this opportunity to rid himself of all of you now that you no longer have any value?”

Liang Yong’s face changed slightly, and even the remaining survivors wore wary expressions.

Squeezing out a smile, Liang Yong said, “Sect Master Yang must be joking. We have already demonstrated our intentions clearly. We simply ask Sect Master Yang to not punish us too severely and spare our lives!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Why should I let you keep your lives? You even betrayed and killed Qu Zheng and Mo Xiao Sheng. If I let you survive, how can I guarantee that one day you won’t treat me the same way?” Yang Kai looked at him coldly, his tone of voice cold and sharp. Meanwhile, as if affected by his mood, the giant dark-green dragon behind Yang Kai also assumed a threatening posture.

The Dragon Pressure also became heavier!
