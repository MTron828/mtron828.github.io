After half a month, the doors of First Heavenly Palace suddenly opened and Yang Kai stepped out with a calm expression.

After half a month of research, he finally figured out what mysteries were hidden inside this stone tablet.

Star Refining Art! This was not a Secret Art, nor was it a Martial Skill, but rather a Secret Technique that allowed a cultivator to refine a Star Source!

When he figured this out, Yang Kai was taken aback, never having expected the stone tablet to contain such an incredible secret.

Refining a Star Source was extremely difficult and only Origin King Realm masters were qualified to even attempt it. Once one successfully refined the Star Source of a Cultivation Star though, they would become that Cultivation Star’s Star Master!

Yang Kai learned of the powers of a Star Master soon after entering the Star Field. The Star Field itself was incredibly vast, but there were very few Star Masters. The reasons for this were quite simple: First, it required extremely high cultivation. Second, there were significant risks involved.

A Star Source was the core essence of a Cultivation Star, so refining it meant linking one’s destiny to that star, sharing both benefits and risks. If one managed to succeed, they would naturally gain unimaginable benefits, but if they failed, the only possible result was death.

Throughout the ages, innumerable masters wanted to conquer Cultivation Stars and refine their Star Sources. Each of these masters was a shocking character, geniuses among geniuses, masters among masters.

However, those who successfully managed to refine Star Sources and become Star Masters were a rarity!

It was difficult to imagine just how many powerhouses had fallen in the process of refining a Cultivation Star’s Star Source.

Of the Star Field’s super forces, Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce was the one Yang Kai was most familiar with and he was aware that it controlled some seven or eight Cultivation Stars while also possessing more than a dozen Origin King Realm masters, but for Star Masters, it only possessed one!

None of the others dared to refine a Star Source.

After all, this was no different from trying to balance oneself on a knife’s edge. If they managed to succeed, it would be a glorious feat that earned them the admiration of the entire Star Field, but the slightest mistake in the process would result in death and disgrace. These powerful Origin King Realm masters would not dare treat their lives so casually.

No wonder Xue Yue said that this stone tablet was useless for Origin Realm masters and was only useful for Origin Kings.

Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce was a super force in the Star Field and had several masters capable of becoming Star Masters, so it had a method for refining Star Sources; however, their method was no doubt vastly inferior to the Star Refining Art recorded in the stone tablet.

The Star Refining Art could be considered the highest-grade Secret Technique possibly for refining Star Sources.

Xue Yue entering the Emperor Garden this time was entirely to acquire the Star Refining Art. Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce’s President Ai Ou’s cultivation had been stuck at the peak of the Second-Order Origin King Realm for many years and he was unable to make any further progress, but if he could refine a Star Source, he would easily break through his current bottleneck and reach the Third-Order.

It was unknown how Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce learned that such a powerful Secret Technique resided inside the Emperor Garden, but they apparently had enough confidence to have Xue Yue personally lead a group of elites in search of it. If this was not the case, how could Xue Yue have engaged in such a risky venture considering Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce’s wealth and resources?

Unfortunately for her, when the Star Refining Art finally appeared, Xue Yue had failed to acquire it. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Kai did not recognize the three ancient words engraved on the stone tablet, but Xue Yue did, which explained why she was so willing to compromise at the time.

It would be a long time before Yang Kai could make use of this Star Refining Art; without even mentioning his lacking cultivation realm, even if he was strong enough, he wouldn’t dare try to refine a Star Source without complete assurance.

As such, after studying it for a while, Yang Kai simply put it away.

Outside First Heavenly Palace, before Yang Kai could even take a few steps, he encountered several High Heaven Sect disciples. After seeing Yang Kai, these disciples hurriedly bowed, “Greetings, Sect Master!”

“En, is everything well in the Sect?” Yang Kai asked casually.

“Reporting to Sect Master, there have been no changes in the Sect since Sect Master entered retreat. All disciples are currently cultivating diligently and Great Elder has returned from the sixth layer.”

“Oh? She’s back?” Yang Kai was a little surprised at first but soon understood. Yang Yan would likely be asleep for at least ten more years, so there was no point in Ye Xi Yun remaining there the entire time. It was only natural to return to High Heaven Sect under the circumstances.

After all, she was instructed by Yang Yan to assist Yang Kai with all her strength, and how was she supposed to do so if she simply remained in the sixth layer? To say nothing of how inconvenient it was to simply meet like that, even communication across the fifth layer Flame Area was extremely difficult.

“Alright!” Yang Kai nodded lightly before ordering, “Tell Huang Juan to bring Lin Yun’er and meet me at the Great Elder’s residence.”

“Yes!” Although the few disciples did not know why Yang Kai wanted to see Huang Juan and Lin Yun’er, they didn’t ask any questions and immediately went about their assigned task.

Hundred Flowers Peak, where Yang Yan and Ye Xi Yun lived before.

Although the flowers here were still blooming in all their beauty, Hundred Flowers Peak now only had Ye Xi Yun living on it. When Yang Kai arrived, he found Ye Xi Yun sitting outside the stone pavilion as if she was lost in thought, so much so that she didn’t even notice him at first.

It was not until Yang Kai gave a light cough that Ye Xi Yun suddenly woke from her reverie up, looked up, and said lightly, “So Sect Master has come, subordinate greets Sect Master.”

Saying so, she elegantly got up.

“There’s no need to be too polite,” Yang Kai waved his hand before walking over and sitting opposite her. Pouring himself a cup of fragrant tea and taking a sip, Yang Kai asked casually, “How is Yang Yan?”

“En, Madam is fine, but she will continue to sleep for some time. Sect Master need not worry about her.”

“That’s good,” Yang Kai nodded lightly before suddenly asking, “What does Great Elder plan to do from now on?”

Ye Xi Yun glanced at him suspiciously for a moment before brushing her hair behind her ear and replying, “What is Sect Master referring to?”

“Why must Great Elder ask something she already knows the answer to? You remain here only because of the Great Emperor’s existence. I don’t know why you are so devoted to the Great Emperor but I’d like to confirm if you plan on simply waiting here until she awakens.”

“That’s right,” Ye Xi Yun gently nodded, “Is there any problem with that?”

“There’s no problem,” Yang Kai smiled lightly, “I was only wondering if Great Elder is willing to idle here instead of trying to take a step further beyond the Origin Returning Realm?”

“A step further?” Ye Xi Yun’s eyes shrank slightly as they flashed a strange brilliance, “If Sect Master has something to say, why speak in riddles to this subordinate?”

“You’re still my Senior, please stop referring to yourself as a subordinate, it’s disconcerting,” Yang Kai’s mouth twitched, “Alright, it’s like this. The current High Heaven Sect does not need to worry about being attacked as its defences are nigh impregnable. As long as the disciples don’t go out, they won’t be at risk. On top of that, there are plenty of cultivation resources here for everyone to use, so I was planning on leaving this place.”

“Leaving this place?” Ye Xi Yun frowned slightly, not understanding what Yang Kai was talking about.

“On a long-distance voyage away from Shadowed Star!” Yang Kai stared at her.

Ye Xi Yun could not help sitting up, “Sect Master means...”

“I just wanted to ask if you wish to leave with me!” Yang Kai grinned, “You should have reached the limit of the Origin Realm, no? The reason you have not yet broken through to the next realm is simply because of the suppression of Shadowed Star’s World Principles. If you were to free yourself from these shackles though, with your strength and aptitude, breaking through to the Origin King Realm should not be difficult. What’s more, we now have the ability to fulfil these conditions, so what does Great Elder think?”

“Leave this place...” Ye Xi Yun’s beautiful eyes filled with anticipation, but they soon regained their tranquillity as she turned to Yang Kai and asked, “Will Sect Master return here?”

“Of course I will return,” Yang Kai nodded, “To be honest with you, my desire to leave is primarily to find some people. After I find them, I will come back. Although the Star Field is big, wanting to find a place to stay and establish a home is not easy, so I have no plans to abandon High Heaven Sect.”

“So that’s it!” Ye Xi Yun said with some relief, “Although Sect Master’s offer is tempting, please forgive this subordinate for refusing.”

“Can you tell me your reason?” Yang Kai looked at her with a smile.

“Madam is still asleep, so I can’t leave. Besides, if Sect Master and I both leave at the same time, there will be no one here who can preside over the overall situation if something happens in the Sect.”

“Yeah, as I thought.” Yang Kai nodded lightly, seemingly knowing this was the response he would get.

Ye Xi Yun rolled her eyes and said in amazement, “Sect Master making this offer yet knowing my response must mean you weren’t really asking me to accompany you, yes?”

“Heh heh...” Yang Kai chuckled, “The choice is yours, whether you decide to go or not. I will not try to convince you. After all...”

Yang Kai did not continue as his expression suddenly turned solemn. With a serious tone, he spoke up once again, “Thank you.”

Being able to resist the temptation of reaching the Origin King Realm and insisting on staying to defend High Heaven Sect while Yang Kai was away, Ye Xi Yun was deserving of his sincere gratitude.

Both understood the other’s unspoken meaning here, so Ye Xi Yun didn’t make any attempt to deny it and simply nodded lightly.

Suddenly, she looked over in a certain direction and asked softly, “Did Sect Master call those two?”

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and soon nodded, “Yes.”

The two Ye Xi Yun spoke of were naturally Huang Juan and Lin Yun’er. The little girl was being led by Huang Juan, but when she saw such a large field of beautiful flowers, Lin Yun’er’s wild instincts took over and she rushed into the garden.

Huang Juan was shocked and quickly ran to catch Lin Yun’er before half-dragging her over to the stone pavilion.

Caught like this, Lin Yun’er looked unhappy as her mouth pursed into a flat line.

“Greetings Sect Master, greetings Great Elder,” Huang Juan saluted while quietly observing Ye Xi Yun. It had been some time now since Huang Juan had arrived at High Heaven Sect, so she knew who the Great Elder was, but it wasn’t until she received Yang Kai’s summon today that she had the honour of actually meeting Ye Xi Yun.

“Sit down!” Yang Kai motioned before beckoning to Lin Yun’er in a friendly manner.

The little girl, however, just narrowed her eyes slightly before hiding herself in Huang Juan’s embrace, shooting Yang Kai a vigilant look every now and then, causing the latter to become speechless for a while.

“Have you gotten used to living here yet?” Yang Kai turned to Huang Juan and asked.

“Many thanks for your concern, Sect Master, subordinate and Yun’er are doing well here.”

“Great, if you lack for anything just tell Wu Yi, she will take care of everything. Remember, you’re not outsiders here, so do not hesitate.”

“Many thanks, Sect Master,” Huang Juan said with a moved look.

“Right, this is an Origin Condensing Pill, take it and enter retreat for a while and you should be able to break through to the Origin Returning Realm. Remember to use one of the cultivation rooms in Rising Dragon Hall for your breakthrough; the Ten Thousand Year Incense and Nine Branch Jade Crystal Tree are placed there and can help you overcome heart demons while sensing the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao, which will greatly improve your odds of success.”
