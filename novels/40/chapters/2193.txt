As Wu Chang’s anger boiled over, a figure suddenly shot out.

It was not Wu Chang that moved first, but Luo Yuan.

Using some kind of extremely profound Movement Skill, Luo Yuan approached the region affected by Space Principles and stood mid-air, looking down coldly as he lifted his hands up high, clenched them into a double hammer-fist, and smashed down.

Violent energy surged.

Behind Luo Yuan, a phantom image several dozen meters high suddenly appeared. This figure was humanoid in shape, but indistinct in features. Raising its two great hands, it mirrored Luo Yuan’s actions perfectly.

*Hong...*

After a breath, there was a loud noise as the huge phantom fists slammed into the shattered space.

Yang Kai’s face darkened.

The swirling Void Cracks around him were collapsing rapidly as the region of shattered space he had created was broken open at that moment.

Before he could react, Wu Chang leapt out from a blind spot in Yang Kai’s field of vision behind Luo Yuan. In Wu Chang’s hands were two swords, one flawlessly white, one fiery red.

The swords crossed and created a brilliant radiance.

Just as Wu Chang crossed his sword, a surge of Sword Qi burst forth and he shouted, “Sword Prison, Sealing Four Poles!”

*Chi chi chi chi...*

A sword wave visible to the naked eye flooded out, forming an invisible field that sealed off the surrounding space.

Everyone was shocked and awed.

Wu Chang and Luo Yuan were two of the Southern Territory’s top elites and the little interaction they had before had only resulted in friction between them, but at this moment, they were working together flawlessly. As the first to move, Luo Yuan had broken through Yang Kai’s Space Principles, after which Wu Chang followed up by sealing Yang Kai’s actions.

In this way, even if Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space, he would be reduced to a turtle hiding in its shell.

The two had executed their techniques with near-perfect timing. Even blood brothers who had lived their entire lives together may not have been able to achieve such a level of coordination.

But these two cultivators from different backgrounds did just that with only their innate judgments and fighting instincts.

“This is bad!” Xia Sheng’s expression changed as he shouted.

On the other side, Wu Chang sneered, “Now you die!”

As he spoke, the swords in his hands trembled as a storm of red and white sword light shot towards Yang Kai.

He didn’t show any mercy, obviously planning to kill Yang Kai in one strike.

In front of everyone’s eyes, the storm swallowed Yang Kai directly and shattered his body. Even the Black Jade Furnace beside him was shattered...

“What!?” Just as everyone was lost in amazement, they saw this terrible scene and couldn’t help letting out pained cries.

Although Yang Kai’s death had nothing to do with them and they didn’t care one bit about it, if the Extraordinary Treasure Pills were destroyed in the process, it was a result no one could accept. Now, Wu Chang would become the greatest sinner rather than Yang Kai!

As for Wu Chang though, he didn’t show the slightest joy after his strike went well and instead just stood there frowning.

Luo Yuan was the same as he raised his eyes and looked around as if he was searching for something. The phantom giant behind him also gradually faded away.

“My patience is limited...” a voice suddenly came from the side.

After hearing this voice, everyone turned to see Yang Kai standing mid-air a short distance away, completely unharmed, holding the Alchemy Furnace in his hands. Sweeping a gloomy glare around, Yang Kai shouted loudly, “Just now, I’ll consider your actions a test of whether I am qualified to discuss terms with all of you. Now that the results are clear though, if someone still doesn’t know their limitations and dares to attack me... I’ll eat all the Extraordinary Treasure Pills in this furnace!”

“Madman, madman!”

“This guy is insane!”

“Brother Yang, aren’t you afraid eating so many pills will be bad for you? Why not give one to me so I can share your burden?”

Wu Chang frowned as he muttered in a low voice, “Like I thought, he can teleport!”

He had already guessed earlier that since Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space, he could leap across space and teleport, which was why he tried to seal the region around him in order to catch him.

He had coordinated with Luo Yuan flawlessly to achieve this, but they still weren’t able to trap Yang Kai.

In fact, Wu Chang didn’t even notice when Yang Kai had teleported away.

From this point alone, he knew that no one here could capture Yang Kai.

It seemed the rumours about cultivators who were proficient in the Dao of Space being unrivalled when it came to escaping and tracking were true!

If someone wanted to kill or capture Yang Kai, only three methods were valid. Either invite a cultivator with a huge enough advantage in strength over Yang Kai that they could crush him in one blow instantly to act, so there was no chance the latter could use teleport away, lure Yang Kai into an independent space that he could not escape from, or set up a barrier to seal space to trap him inside.

In the Four Seasons Realm, no one could do this.

In here, Yang Kai could come and go as he pleased!

“So Brother Yang’s intentions are... to negotiate with us?” Lan Xun raised her brow as she read between the lines of Yang Kai’s words just now.

“Princess is correct!” Yang Kai grinned, “Or at least, half-correct.”

“Please elaborate!” Lan Xun smiled.

“The ones I need to negotiate with are them, not with you, Princess.” As Yang Kai spoke, he reached into his Alchemy Furnace and took out a round, longan sized, pure white Spirit Pill.

A refreshing aroma immediately diffused.

“An Extraordinary Treasure Pill!” A cry of excitement came from the crowd as everyone stared at this Spirit Pill fiercely, all of them identifying it as the legendary pill which could help them reach the Emperor Realm!

“One of the key herbs used to refine these Extraordinary Treasure Pills was provided by Her Highness, so this Yang will deliver one to her in accordance with our previous agreement. Please accept it!” Yang Kai held the Spirit Pill out towards Lan Xun.

“Oh? Brother Yang is willing to fulfil that agreement?” Lan Xun looked at him with some surprise. She thought Yang Kai would renege on this promise, but now it appeared things were a little different from her expectations.

Yang Kai said in a serious tone, “This is only natural. These Extraordinary Treasure Pills could only be successfully refined thanks to the Jade Blood Mushroom provided by Princess. Without that Jade Blood Mushroom, there would be no Extraordinary Treasure Pills at this moment, so naturally giving one to Princess is appropriate... As for the others, without contributing anything or putting in any effort, they want to swallow these pills?” Snorting disdainfully, “They must be dreaming.”

“Brother Yang’s reasoning is fair,” Lan Xun nodded lightly before saying seriously. “If that is the case, then Little Sister will accept.”

Saying so, she lightly stepped towards Yang Kai.

Not long after, she arrived in front of Yang Kai, took the Spirit Pill in hand, and quietly whispered, “Many thanks!”

“Princess is too polite,” Yang Kai responded with a smile. “It would be best if Princess can take this Spirit Pill immediately. The Extraordinary Treasure Pill is different from ordinary Spirit Pills in that its effects are permanent and cumulative. The sooner one takes it, the better its efficacy will be. When Princess attempts to break through to the Emperor Realm, the Extraordinary Treasure Pill will still provide the maximum benefits!”

“Then... I’ll eat it now!” Lan Xun said and popped the Extraordinary Treasure Pill into her delicate mouth before swallowing it down.

*Gudong...*

The gulping sound did not come from Lan Xun, but from the onlookers below. Everyone watched Lan Xun take this Spirit Pill and unconsciously swallowed their saliva.

“Princess is extremely talented, so with the help of this Spirit Pill, reaching the Emperor Realm is surely just around the corner. This Yang wishes Princess prosperity and a swift ascension to the peak of the Martial Dao!”

“I’ll accept your kind words,” Lan Xun smiled lightly.

“Are you finished with your flattery?” Wu Chang suddenly interrupted the conversation between the two with an unhappy expression, glaring at Yang Kai coldly as he said, “I understand what you’re doing now.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his brow and looked at Wu Chang, “Let’s hear what Brother Wu Chang’s guess is then.”

“Hmph!” Wu Chang coldly snorted, “The Extraordinary Treasure Pills have been refined, and you are proficient in the Dao of Space, so you could leave here at any time, but you didn’t. Instead, you stayed here and chattered on endlessly; you even deliberately took out an Extraordinary Treasure Pill to seduce everyone. Obviously, you want to exchange these Extraordinary Treasure Pills for something from the people here...”

After a short pause, he continued, “You’re quite shrewd too. You know that even if you leave the Four Seasons Realm with the Extraordinary Treasure Pills, you may not be able to protect yourself. As long as the cultivators here bring this news back to their forces, the Emperor Realm Masters outside won’t let you leave easily. They may not go so far as to use their strength and status to snatch things from you, but they will surely make you hand over the Extraordinary Treasure Pills while giving you some meagre compensation...”

“However, instead of passively accepting whatever compensation they offer, it would be better to take the initiative and seize as many benefits as you can here!” He finally concluded.

“Am I right?”

Yang Kai looked at Wu Chang in amazement, seemingly dumbfounded.

After a while, he applauded loudly and nodded, “I really didn’t think Brother Wu Chang was such a sharp-minded person.”

His remarks undoubtedly acknowledged what Wu Chang said.

In fact, this was precisely Yang Kai’s plan.

The Extraordinary Treasure Pills were extremely precious, and if it were possible, Yang Kai would have preferred keeping them all for himself. In the future, he might be able to use them to exchange for some precious items he needed. Yang Kai was certain that once they heard the three words ‘Extraordinary Treasure Pill’, no individual or Sect would refuse to trade with him, not even Star Soul Palace.

However... Just as Wu Chang said, even if he brought the Extraordinary Treasure Pills out from the Four Seasons Realm, it would be absolutely impossible to bring them away with him. The Emperor Realm Masters waiting outside the exit, would certainly not let him just leave.

The best-case scenario would be the Emperors dividing up his Extraordinary Treasure Pills and then paying him a few Source Crystals or treasures as compensation.

This was not what Yang Kai wanted to see.

He would settle things on his own terms. Even if it meant suffering a slight loss, he wouldn’t let others interfere.
