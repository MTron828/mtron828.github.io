Chapter 1426, Quite Lively

Now that High Heaven Sect had formally been established, as Elders and disciples seeing the Sect Master, they needed to salute him. Even Ye Xi Yun, the strongest master present, nodded in acknowledgement towards Yang Kai.

However, her eyes soon turned back to continue staring at Yang Yan’s movements with a kind of fanaticism.

This woman really regarded Yang Yan as her idol, Yang Kai thought to himself with slight amusement.

He did not blame her for this, as the reputation of the Starry Sky Great Emperor was worthy of such devotion. The only reason Yang Kai could treat Yang Yan so casually was that he had become very familiar with her over the past few years.

“What’s happening?” Yang Kai turned his attention to the sky and asked in a puzzled voice.

“Reporting to Sect Master, Vice Sect Master Yang is opening the Flowing Flame Sand Field’s barrier so we may once again see the sun, moon, and stars,” Ning Xiang Chen quickly replied, his tone filled with respect as his old eyes sparkled with vigour, seemingly unable to conceal his respect for Yang Yan.

In this world, who else could manipulate the Flowing Flame Sand Field’s flame barriers? Only Yang Yan could achieve such a feat, so it was only reasonable for Ning Xiang Chen to show her great respect.

Hearing what he said, Yang Kai gently nodded. Knowing what Yang Yan’s plan was in his heart, he no longer continued asking.

Although everyone was happy they had moved to this Supreme Profound Sect ruin and established High Heaven Sect, with the Three Blazing Flame Rings constantly blocking out the sun, moon, and stars, they had become a bit depressed with the living environment.

As such, Yang Yan was intending to open the flame barrier that covered the sky so that High Heaven Sect could feel reconnected with the outside world.

This was a good deed that only Yang Yan could do, so Yang Kai naturally did not have any intention of stopping her, simply standing together with the rest of the crowd and waiting.

Pure Saint Qi continued pouring from Yang Yan’s tender body, transforming into thin streams and shooting off into the sky before disappearing in the next instant.

As time passed, a vortex appeared in the fiery red sky. This vortex was still small in the beginning but gradually became larger in scale.

The swirling vortex was quite visually shocking and caused the people down below to shudder as they had the illusion that they were about to be sucked up into the sky.

After another half an hour or so, the red ring on Yang Yan’s wrist buzzed and flew up into the sky along with her soft shout and transformed into a giant ring nearly a dozen kilometres in diameter.

This ring slowly floated upwards and eventually touched the flame barrier that covered the sky before coming to a halt as it wrapped around the massive swirling vortex.

Immediately, the vortex began to pull back, as if being drawn in by some kind of incredible suction and, with a low rumbling, the flame barrier that covered High Heaven Sect withdrew like a tide, revealing a circular patch of sky more than a dozen kilometres wide.

Sounds of cheering burst out as the disciples jumped for joy.

Yang Kai also grinned, showing a look of happiness on his face, but soon, his eyes were attracted to something high up in the sky and his expression turned to one of shock.

“Sure enough...” Yang Yan muttered softly, her beautiful eyes staring up into the sky, her brow wrinkling slightly as she flicked her wrist again and retrieved the first of the Three Blazing Flame Rings.

However, the flame barrier did not close when Yang Yan did this, instead remaining open, allowing sunlight to pour down as well as granting a view of the blue sky and white clouds outside.

However, at this moment, in addition to the long-lost blue sky and white clouds, there was another clearly noticeable object within view.

A huge and grand palace!

The Emperor Garden!

“Why is that thing here?”

“Wasn’t it floating over Dragon Cave Mountain?”

“When did it arrive here?”

A burst of chatter erupted from the several dozen disciples as they all became somewhat worried. Once bitten by a snake, fearful of ropes for ten years, as the saying goes. Last time, Dragon Cave Mountain encountered great difficulties and ultimately met its end thanks to the appearance of the Emperor Garden.

Originally, after leaving Dragon Cave Mountain and finding a new place to settle down, one that was a thousand times better than Dragon Cave Mountain at that, the haze which had plagued everyone’s heart had been swept away, but never had they imagined that the original source of their calamity, the Emperor Garden, had actually appeared directly above them again.

This was a reality that was somewhat difficult to accept.

The Emperor Garden, one of Shadowed Star’s Three Great Forbidden Zones, seemed to be following them around, unwilling to leave them in peace.

What’s more, no one knew when the Emperor Garden had made the long journey from Dragon Cave Mountain to the sky above High Heaven Sect; after all, High Heaven Sect had been enveloped by the Three Blazing Flame Rings until now, cutting it off from the outside world.

Only Yang Kai and Yang Yan knew why it was here, while Ye Xi Yun had some faint ideas why but was not quite sure.

Yang Yan flew down from the sky and landed lightly next to Yang Kai, her expression calm and indifferent.

After glancing at her, Yang Kai asked softly, “Did you realize this thing had arrived here and decided to open the barrier?”

“En, I had a feeling but I wasn’t sure. Regardless, opening the barrier to expose the sky was always part of my plan so I simply took advantage of this opportunity to confirm my theory,” Yang Yan gently nodded.

Yang Kai understood clearly and pondered for a moment before turning his head to the unsettled disciples and shouted, “Settle down. Since the Emperor Garden has appeared here, there must be a reason for it, so there’s no need to make a fuss about something we can’t control. Just attend to your own affairs.”

After hearing Yang Kai’s words, the commotion amongst the crowd calmed down.

After the lower strength disciples left, Yang Kai thoughtfully said, “We may not know when the Emperor Garden transferred here, but since it has, I think it should be quite lively outside the Flowing Flame Sand Field right now!”

The Emperor Garden had all but played a practical joke on all of Shadowed Star. When it first appeared, it had suspended itself directly above Dragon Cave Mountain, causing countless great forces to gather in Heavenly Fate City.

But who could have anticipated that it would suddenly move away one day?

Now that it appeared above High Heaven Sect, the masters from Shadowed Star’s various great Sects must have chased after it. There was no doubt about this either as, now that the Emperor Jades had appeared, there was certainly not much longer before the Emperor Garden officially opened. No one wanted to miss such a good opportunity.

“Would you like to go out and take a look?” Yang Yan asked.

“En,” Yang Kai nodded lightly. Knowing that there were so many ‘guests’ at his door, Yang Kai naturally wasn’t about to just sit back and watch.

“I’ll come with you,” Yang Yan said immediately.

Yang Kai glanced over at her but did not raise any objections, simply nodding, “Good.”

After a brief discussion, Yang Yan immediately summoned the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle and the two of them quickly boarded. Ye Xi Yun, who refused to leave Yang Yan’s side, naturally accompanied them as well.

The place High Heaven Sect was located was originally in the fourth layer of the Flowing Flame Sand Field, but now that the First-Layer Flame Area had disappeared, only the Third-Layer Flame Area stood between High Heaven Sect and the outside world.

A short while later, the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle passed through the fourth layer and entered the third, but with Yang Yan here, the extreme heat and rolling Flame Attribute Energy posed no threat to the trio at all, all of it simply moving aside as if it had a mind of its own, allowing them to pass through unhindered.

The Flying Shark Battle Shuttle appeared outside the Third-Layer Flame Barrier sometime after.

The door opened, and Yang Kai flew out, but just as he stood firm, he could not help raising his brow as he swept his eyes around and grinned.

At this moment, there really were a lot of cultivators gathered outside the Flowing Flame Sand Field. There were small scattered groups of two or three as well as large contingents that had set up organized camps, but one thing all of them had in common was that they were gazing towards the Flowing Flame Sand Field with anxiety.

Yang Kai recognized a couple of these forces, some of which he shared enmity with, while others he was friendly with; all in all, almost every big and small force on Shadowed Star had assembled here.

It could be said that all the cultivators who had originally been staying in Heavenly Fate City had come here chasing the Emperor Garden.

When the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle emerged from the Flowing Flame Sand Field and Yang Kai appeared, everyone instantly focused on him, many showing shocked and dumbfounded expressions.

Since the Flowing Flame Sand Field was known as one of the Three Great Forbidden Zones, it was naturally an extremely dangerous place to enter.

During the time when it was in a closed state, no one should have been able to step into it. There had been no shortage of Origin Returning Realm masters who were extremely confident of their strength that had tried to force their way into the Flowing Flame Sand Field, but the instant they entered the First-Layer Flame Area, they were vaporized without exception.

The Flowing Flame Sand Field in its closed state was not something Shadowed Star’s cultivators could resist. Only during the period when it opened could those below the Origin Realm enter.

But now, Yang Kai had casually appeared from inside. Did that mean he had some method to safely traverse this Forbidden Zone and even remain inside?

How could that be?

Many masters present almost thought they had been imagining things as they were unable to believe their own eyes, causing them to feel both dread and envy. Although they did not know what method Yang Kai used to freely enter and exit the Flowing Flame Sand Field, this method was undoubtedly extraordinary.

Moreover, with so many benefits hidden inside this Forbidden Zone and only Yang Kai being able to enter and exit it, didn’t that mean that all these treasures were his to do with as he pleased?

For those masters who had forged a grudge against Yang Kai, each and every one of them wore gloomy expressions and were so depressed they nearly coughed up blood.

Yang Kai was still just a Junior, yet he was already this difficult to deal with. If they really let him occupy all the resources in the Flowing Flame Sand Field for an extended period of time, who on Shadowed Star could possibly oppose him when he fully matured?

Realizing this, many masters present secretly exchanged glances as murderous intent welled up in their hearts.

However, not everyone directed killing intent towards Yang Kai. Shadow Moon Hall’s Great Elder Qian Tong and Heavenly Fate City’s City Lord Fei Zhi Tu both simply wore looks of surprise and joy when they saw Yang Kai. After hesitating for some time, Qian Tong finally called out, “Yang Kai, it was rumoured that you settled down here, could those rumours be true?”

After the incident on Dragon Cave Mountain, when Yang Kai and the others had arrived here, they had expelled a group of treasure hunters and declared that a ten thousand kilometre radius around the Flowing Flame Sand Field was now a restricted area. Naturally, word of this event had spread out.

The masters on Shadowed Star also caught wind of these rumours, but none of them took it seriously.

No one had believed that Yang Kai and his trivial Dragon Cave Mountain could establish themselves inside the Flowing Flame Sand Field, most of them were simply thinking that this little brat was spreading nonsense to boost his reputation. Even Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu had laughed when they heard this, thinking that Yang Kai was just venting his anger after his Dragon Cave Mountain had been destroyed.

But now, no one dared to think like this. Yang Kai had clearly come out from the Flowing Flame Sand Field inside his extremely small Starship. Seeing was believing, so no one doubted this truth anymore.
