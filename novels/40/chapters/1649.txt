Zhou Yun Xuan picked herself up from the snow with difficulty while covering her cheek with her hand, her face dull as she stared at Yang Kai in a daze.

She never expected that Yang Kai would dare to slap her in front of the Valley Master and so many Elders.

“Apologize!” Yang Kai continued glaring at her coldly.

Zhou Yun Xuan’s tender body trembled. Being insulted in front of so many of her fellow Sect Sisters, as an Origin Returning Realm master, how could she bear it? Her face twisting in anger, she screamed, “You dare hit me?”

*Pa...*

With another loud smacking sound, Zhou Yun Xuan flew out again.

Her other cheek this time went numb.

“Apologize!” Yang Kai’s voice sounded again coldly, without any emotion, causing all who heard it to shudder.

Zhou Yun Xuan climbed up from the ground for a second time with a look of horror on her face. When she turned to look at Ran Yun Ting, as if begging her to uphold justice, Zhou Yun Xuan felt a chill run from the soles of her feet straight to the top of her head, her shock so great she stopped being able to think for a moment.

Great Elder’s face was sombre and still, and although she was glaring at Yang Kai fixedly, she did not say a word.

The other Elders present had similar expressions, and even the Valley Master was frowning with difficulty.

No one was going to seek justice for her!

Zhou Yun Xuan was shocked! She knew that she had done something wrong and should not have insulted Su Yan as she had, but there had to be other reasons why she was being abandoned here.

It was as if everyone here feared this young man!

“Apologize, or... die!” Yang Kai issued an ultimatum and his murderous intent reappeared, locking onto Zhou Yun Xuan. Having failed to kill Ran Yun Ting had made him extremely annoyed, so this Zhou Yun Xuan happened to be an easy target to vent on.

Bing Long finally spoke, frowning as she said, “Yang Kai, let us end this here. Although this disciple was indeed rude, you have already punished her, let her go.”

Zhou Yun Xuan was also a disciple of Ice Heart Valley, so Yang Kai slapping her twice in front of everyone was the limit to what Bing Long could tolerate. If Yang Kai insisted on continuing with his aggressive stance, Bing Long would not stand idly by.

If she really allowed him to do as he pleased, it would only cause all the disciples present to lose faith in the Sect.

“Junior Brother, forget it,” Su Yan also pleaded for Zhou Yun Xuan. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

To her, Zhou Yun Xuan’s insult did no harm, and now that Yang Kai had also slapped her twice, all the resentment she felt was relieved.

Instead, Yang Kai acting for her without any hesitation had caused Su Yan to feel some sweetness in her heart.

“Since Senior Sister says so... I won’t kill her,” Yang Kai’s expression eased as he turned to Bing Long and said, “Make her apologize and I’ll spare her!”

Bing Long was speechless, wondering if this could even be called a concession while feeling a little annoyed.

At this time, all the leaders of Ice Heart Valley inclined their heads towards a certain direction, as if they had suddenly received some kind of message, their expressions becoming solemn.

Yang Kai frowned as he too vaguely sensed some Divine Sense fluctuations from nearby, but was unable to locate the exact source.

He immediately understood, though, that Ice Heart Valley’s Supreme Elder was speaking to Bing Long and the other Elders.

Not bothering to act rashly again, he simply waited quietly.

The faces of Bing Long and the others became cloudy and uncertain, but after some time, they exchanged a solemn glance as they all vaguely felt that a great storm was approaching.

It seemed that something big had transpired in Ice Heart Valley.

“Apologize to Su Yan, then this matter will end!” Bing Long suddenly turned to Zhou Yun Xuan and said with a somewhat irritable expression.

Zhou Yun Xuan’s expression was blank, never having expected that Valley Master would also favour Yang Kai and Su Yan. Although she was filled with confusion, with the last chance she could rely upon gone, she could only reluctantly say, “Junior Sister Su, Senior Sister made an indiscreet remark just now, please don’t take offence!

After speaking, she grit her teeth hard and her eyes flickered with hatred and madness, like a vicious snake.

She knew that in the future, she would become a laughing stock in Ice Heart Valley, the topic of gossip between her Sisters from morning till night! She had never been more disgraced.

“Withdraw,” Bing Long waved to Zhou Yun Xuan and dismissed her.

Zhou Yun Xuan bowed and walked away, but before leaving she shot Yang Kai and Su Yan a vicious look, as if wanting to burn their appearances into her heart.

“Everyone else is to disperse as well!” Bing Long shouted softly.

The spectating Ice Heart Valley disciples retreated as ordered.

Soon, only the top executives of Ice Heart Valley, Yang Kai, and Su Yan were left atop the open expanse. Qing Ya stood far away, paying attention to what was happening with a worried expression.

“Yang Kai, follow me!” Bing Long looked at Yang Kai with a complicated expression.

“Who wants to see me?” Yang Kai asked, already having a vague guess as to what had happened.

Bing Long sighed, “Supreme Elder wants to see you... not only that, but Sir Luo Hai, Star Master of Green Mountains Star and Chi Huo, Supreme Elder of Brilliant Flame Sect also wish to see you!”

“Luo Hai is here?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes.

“Indeed!”

“What if I refuse to go?” Yang Kai grinned.

“I’m afraid you have no choice. You should know what will happen if you refuse,” Bing Long sighed, “Although you are very strong, it is still meaningless in front of Sir Luo Hai.”

Yang Kai stroked his chin, nodded and said, “It seems that I have to go. Good, I’ll go with Senior. It’s time to put an end to this matter.”

Bing Long was stunned, but did not ask much, glancing towards Su Yan who was still standing next to him, and sighed, “I’ll lead you there.”

The other Elders followed closely, with Ran Yun Ting staring at Yang Kai sullenly, her expression never losing its ferociousness.

Although she did not know why Sir Luo Hai wanted to meet Yang Kai so badly, even using Brilliant Flame Sect to find him, it was obvious that the grievances between them were not shallow.

This little animal really did not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth, actually daring to provoke Sir Luo Hai! [Now it is just a question of how you die] Ran Yun Ting cursed hatefully in her heart.

The next moment, she saw Su Yan and Yang Kai holding hands while whispering something to each other in low voices, and could not help feeling a surge of anger, wishing she could rush up and separate them now.

Recalling Yang Kai’s unfathomable methods, Ran Yun Ting forced herself to endured, just coldly snorting and chasing after Bing Long and the others Elders

“Senior Sister, you should wait here for me, I’ll be right back.”

“No, I’m going together with you!” Su Yan shook her head, and her beautiful eyes became firm, obviously worried Yang Kai might have some kind of accident and wishing wholeheartedly to share that burden with him.

“Very well then...,” Yang Kai did not continue to persuade her, raising his head towards Qing Ya.

Qing Ya immediately said, “I’ll wait for you here!”

She knew that she was not qualified to participate in this matter, so she wisely decided to stay put.

Xiao Xiao stood quietly beside her.

Yang Kai gently nodded and left with Su Yan.

Bing Long was waiting not far away, but after seeing this pair, which seemed ignorant of everything around them, following her, her brow couldn’t help wrinkling somewhat. However, she did not take their conduct to heart at the moment and instead stared at Yang Kai meaningfully while asking, “Now that things have gotten to this point, shouldn’t you honestly tell us what kind of grievances you have with Sir Luo Hai?”

“Senior wants to know?” Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

Bing Long nodded.

“Then ask Luo Hai, if he is willing to tell you, you will naturally know.”

“You...” Bing Long became angry, “Are you still unclear about your situation? Sir Luo Hai and Senior Chi Huo have come to Pure Ice Island together and called to see you. They must be here for you, and the only one who can provide you shelter is my Ice Heart Valley’s Supreme Elder. Are you so determined to keep hiding things that you are willing to die in exchange?”

“Your Ice Heart Valley’s Supreme Elder is only a First-Order Origin King, no? If Luo Hai really wanted to do something to me here, could she stop him?” Yang Kai spat disdainfully.

Bing Long was instantly struck speechless.

In the Origin King Realm, every Minor Realm was separated by a vast gap, and the difference in strength was dramatic! It was precisely because of this that no one could stop Luo Hai and Chi Huo from trespassing onto Pure Ice Island, nor could Luo Li refuse when they demanded to see Yang Kai.

If this weren’t the case, how could Luo Li have allowed them to set foot on Pure Ice Island? In fact, if it had only been Chi Huo, Luo Li would have already beaten him back.

“What’s more, I have no friendship with your Ice Heart Valley, so even if your Supreme Elder did have the necessary ability, why would she take the initiative to protect me?” Yang Kai sneered, “Or what? Do you simply want to know what Luo Hai wants from me so you can bargain for a piece of it from him?”

Bing Long was stunned, but immediately said with a wry smile, “Since you understand, why would you still agree to meet with him? If I were you, I would have done my best to disappear!”

“And go where?” Yang Kai coldly snorted, “I was chased by him through the Star Field for days until I finally managed to hide on Scarlet Wave Star. Now that he has found my trail again, I am afraid I can’t get away. Having said that, it is time I settled this grievance with him, otherwise I will have to worry about him suddenly coming after me for the rest of my life. If he wants to use his strength to bully me, he must have the necessary ability!

As he spoke, Yang Kai’s face flashed with brutality and a strong light flashed across his eyes. Instead of retreating in fear of Luo Hai’s strength, he looked like he was eager to fight.

Bing Long stared at Yang Kai dumbfounded, only after a long silence shaking her head and muttering, “Lunatic!”

With only a Second-Order Origin Realm cultivation, Bing Long felt there was something wrong with Yang Kai’s head for daring to speak so wildly.

Yang Kai just laughed carefreely.

Su Yan did not say a word from beginning to end, just snuggling beside Yang Kai, holding hands with him, as if she never wanted to be separated, a quiet and content smile on her face.

Bing Long let out another exasperated sigh. In normal times, such a golden boy and jade girl would definitely be a match made by the Heavens.

However, with Yang Kai being stared at by Luo Hai, his future was filled with uncertainty. Su Yan on the other hand, as a core disciple of Ice Heart Valley who had cultivated the Ice Jade Secret Art, was doomed to fall from grace and become miserable if she could not break free of these emotional fetters.

Bing Long gradually became indifferent.

This group moved extremely fast and soon arrived in front of a magnificent ice palace on the Inner Island.

The ice palace seemed to be carved out of a single, pure ice crystal, and gave off a feeling of elegance and detached majesty.

Inside the ice palace, there were several extremely powerful auras.

When Yang Kai arrived in front of this white jade Ice Palace, three powerful Divine Senses instantly locked onto him, one of which far outstripped the other two.

Luo Hai!
