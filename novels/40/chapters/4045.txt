As a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, Zhong Fan had a deep foundation. When the Sword Formation broke, he had also suffered heavy backlash, but his injuries weren’t as severe as Luo Qing Yun’s. If he had escaped in advance, he might have had a chance to survive, but for some reason, he had stayed here and watched as Thunder Light and Sword Pavilion’s disciples were destroyed one after another.

When Yang Kai arrived in front of him and looked down at him, Zhong Fan coldly snorted, “Junior, don’t act so arrogantly. You’ve committed a heinous crime. Once you leave the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, you’ll die!”

Yang Kai’s brow wrinkled as he faintly felt that his words were hinting at something, but he couldn’t be bothered to ask, coldly snorting, “This King likes stubborn people like you, it’s more interesting to pinch them to death!”

Saying so, he sent a palm strike towards Zhong Fan.

He showed no mercy and was completely ruthless!

Zhong Fan’s expression remained indifferent. When the giant hand was almost upon him, his eyes suddenly flashed and a crack appeared between his eyebrows. From that crack, a stream of sword Qi shot out.

In this moment of life and death, he suddenly used his last trump card to defend himself, sending out a strike powered by his Dao foundation and Blood Essence itself.

Unless it were absolutely necessary, no one would do such a thing as this was in essence a sacrificial technique, damaging one’s own foundation in exchange for a burst of power. If things went wrong, one would become crippled after releasing such a strike.

Zhong Fan had no other choice though. Yang Kai had managed to obtain his Golden Crow Casts the Sun Divine Manifestation and possessed the terrifying Yuan Magnetic Divine Bottle Gourd, a terrifying killing weapon. Other than resorting to this move, he had no other hope.

In this desperate struggle, success or failure depended on the will of the Heavens!

A lifetime of cultivating the sword focused on attacking and killing allowed Zhong Fan to condense all his remaining strength into a small forearm-length sword. It was extremely sharp and seemed capable of cutting through anything.

“I knew you would do this!” Yang Kai coldly snorted as he stretched out his hand and actually grabbed at the approaching sword.

However, he soon furrowed his brow and looked down. The next moment, he saw a dazzling sword light shoot out from his palm, heading straight towards his forehead.

In the end, he still underestimated the power of a desperate Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Even with his powerful Half-Dragon physique, Yang Kai was unable to resist the power of this small sword-shaped attack and it pierced straight through his palm. Furthermore, Sword Qi was lingering around the wound, making it impossible to heal.

Taking a deep breath as Yang Kai’s entire body doubled in size. His chest swelled up and he became taller. Immediately after, Yang Kai breathed out, spewing the Golden Crow’s True Fire at the approaching sword.

The raging flames distorted the world itself.

Looking from afar, the small sword flew against the Golden Crow’s True Fire like a small fish swimming against the current. Nonetheless, it was still being eroded by the Golden Crow’s True Fire.

Zhong Fan’s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets as he roared and pushed his strike to its limit, determined to kill Yang Kai here and now!

Bit by bit, the small sword pushed forward, inching closer to Yang Kai’s forehead. Its speed was extremely slow despite its sharp threat.

Yang Kai, however, remained still and continued to breathe out the fearsome Golden Crow’s True Fire.

The small sword glowed brighter as it shook violently.

Ten breaths later, when the small sword arrived in front of him but could no longer hold on and collapsed.

Zhong Fan spat out a mouthful of hot blood as his aura suddenly plummeted. At this moment, it was as if all of his blood and essence had been sucked out of his body, leaving only skin and bones.

As the wind blew, his hair fluttered in the wind.

With his Dao foundation destroyed, Zhong Fan’s cultivation was crippled!

In the Star City, countless people were shocked. Many couldn’t help but feel a sense of grief. Although they had heard that once one’s Dao foundation was destroyed, a cultivator would die, this was the first time 99% of them were witnessing it. The change in Zhong Fan’s appearance from before and after was astonishing.

Yang Kai stepped forward and flew past Zhong Fan, showing no interest in taking action against someone who was destined to die.

In a few steps, he arrived in front of Lu Xue and grabbed her by the collar, staring down at her indifferently as he demanded, “Where is the Headquarters of Sword Pavilion?”

When Zhong Fan heard these words, his head drooped down as his aura rapidly dissipated.

Lu Xue happened to be coughing fresh blood to no end. It was boiling and mixed in with fragments of her internal organs. Her entire body was abnormally red, like a cooked crab.

Before the battle began, Yang Kai had planted the Golden Crow’s True Fire in her, preventing her from participating. At first, Zhong Fan had helped her suppress the scorching energy running amok in her body, but after he left, she was unable to resist the burning Golden Crow’s True Fire on her own and could only wait for death.

Fortunately, the foundation of a Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master wasn’t bad, and the battle between Yang Kai, Sword Pavilion, and Thunder Light hadn’t lasted long, so even now, she was still alive, though half-dead. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

If left alone, it wouldn’t even take an incense stick of time before she ended up dying.

Seeing Yang Kai standing before her, Lu Xue’s tender body trembled violently. She had never thought that one day she would be so afraid of an Emperor Realm Junior!

Outside the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, she would not even bother to raise her head to take a glance at an Emperor Realm cultivator.

But today, Yang Kai’s actions had deeply shocked her. One man had destroyed Sword Pavilion’s Sword Formation and then eradicated Thunder Light. Nobody could match what he had done.

At this moment, Yang Kai was holding her in his hand like a little chick. She couldn’t help but tremble in fear. A shadow had appeared in the depths of her heart.

The person in front of her had become her heart demon.

Even if she could leave the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary alive, if she were to encounter Yang Kai outside in the future, she probably wouldn’t have any thoughts of opposing him unless she could break through this heart demon.

Hearing Yang Kai’s question, how could Lu Xue not know what he wanted to do? He wanted to sweep Sword Pavilion’s headquarters clean.

[Can he do it?] As soon as she asked this question, her heart gave an affirmative answer. Sword Pavilion had only sent three hundred people this time, which was less than a third of their forces. There were nearly a thousand disciples, two Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters back at their Headquarters, including their Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Pavilion Master.

However, based on the methods Yang Kai had displayed today, the Sword Pavilion simply could not resist.

Putting everything else aside, just the Yuan Magnetic Divine Bottle Gourd alone was enough to suppress Sword Pavilion completely.

Sword Pavilion was able to surpass Thunder Light and Scarlet Star because of its Sword Formations; however, once the Yuan Magnetic Divine Light appeared, how could the disciples form a Sword Formation? At that time, they would be completely scattered, and without the power of the Sword Formation or even their swords, they would be no match for Yang Kai.

Apart from the Pavilion Master, who could barely resist him, no one else would be able to survive.

To her, Yang Kai was like a Demon straight from Hell. When she looked at him, Lu Xue was so frightened that she couldn’t speak.

“Lead me there and I’ll spare your life!” Yang Kai claimed as he reached out and patted Lu Xue’s abdomen with his other hand. With a thought, the Golden Crow’s True Fire that had invaded Lu Xue’s body and made her suffer a fate worse than death, which no one could forcefully expel, was immediately withdrawn.

Lu Xue coughed lightly. Although her foundation had been greatly damaged, without the Golden Crow’s True Fire in her body, at least her life was no longer in danger. As long as she rested well, there would be a day she would recover.

“If you dare say no, I’ll send you to see your companions in the next world right now!” When Lu Xue didn’t reply after a long time, Yang Kai became slightly impatient.

“I’ll take you there,” Lu Xue lightly nodded.

Yang Kai nodded, grabbed Lu Xue, and soared into the sky, transforming into a streak of light and disappearing from everyone’s sight.

He deliberately didn’t suppress his voice when he was talking with Lu Xue just now. That small hill wasn’t too far from the Star City, so anyone with a bit of strength inside could hear him loud and clear.

Seeing Yang Kai leave just like that, everyone was shocked.

[Does he want to kill to the last?]

This time, Sword Pavilion had lost three hundred disciples, and even two of their Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters had died. This was already a great loss to them, yet Yang Kai still wanted to attack their headquarters directly. Just how cruel and merciless was he?

On top of that, he had just experienced a great battle. Even his Divine Manifestation had been broken. Could it be that he did not need to rest and recover first?

Yue He couldn’t help showing a look of worry, but it was already too late to chase after him. Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space, so it was impossible for her to catch up to him with her strength.

The entire world went silent. All that remained was a nauseating smell of blood lingering in the air. Outside Scarlet Star’s city, rivers of blood flowed and corpses littered the ground like a purgatory.

In the distant void, a little fatty stared at the scene and sighed lightly, “How sinful!”

The Yuan Magnetic Divine Bottle Gourd had come from him after all, so he was half responsible for the people who had died.

After a sigh, the figure disappeared.

Inside Yang Kai’s mansion, Meng Hong and the others stared with their mouths agape.

As Great Moon Province’s Chief Disciple, Meng Hong’s aptitude was extraordinary. Previously, he had been forced to refine Third-Order Elements due to the lack of resources, hoping to achieve the Third-Order Open Heaven Realm in the future.

After suffering a great change in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, Meng Hong decided to start over and refine a Fifth-Order Sun’s True Fire. Originally, he had thought that his future would be bright and his heart was filled with pride and ambition. Still, after seeing what Yang Kai had done today, he realized that even if he could really achieve the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm, he would still be inferior to Yang Kai.

This was quite a blow to him, but after thinking about it for a moment, he realized that the other party had his own opportunities and abilities. As long as he believed in himself, there was no need for him to compare himself with others. [In this world, there are always some people who defy the Heavens. A Great Peng spreads its wings and soars into the sky, but the Cloud Soaring Tree from where it starts is already pretty high.]

Thinking of this, his thoughts became clear, and his spirits lifted.

“Since we have nothing better to do, let’s go clean up the battlefield,” Yue He’s voice came from beside him, “With so many people dead, there must be some good stuff left behind.”

“En!” Meng Hong quickly replied, leading his two Junior Brothers outside. Even Chen Yue followed closely behind, staring at Meng Hong’s back with a complicated expression.

Meanwhile, from inside the Star City, several dozen people, led by Guo Zi Yan, also rushed forward to help. Although they looked miserable, at this moment, all of them couldn’t be in higher spirits.

Silavin: I think I mentioned this before. Great Peng – A large bird. Well, legendary bird.
