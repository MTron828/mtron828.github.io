Suppressing her displeasure, He Yun Xiang uttered, “If any of you can tell me any useful information about Heng Luo Star Field, I’ll give you a reward.”

The burly man asked with a smile, “What kind of reward can you give us?”

It was apparent that she had just reached the Third-Order Origin King Realm not long ago, so it was impossible that she had any treasures on her. However, if she was willing to spend a night with them, they might help her find out more about Heng Luo Star Field.

At the very least, the burly man was willing to do so. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have teased her.

With a faint smile, He Yun Xiang fished out something and replied, “This is the reward.”

It was an ordinary-looking round mirror that looked like something a woman would use. It appeared simple and dated, but when He Yun Xiang infused her Saint Qi into it, a glint flashed across the mirror. At the same time, an amazing energy fluctuation propagated from it.

Everyone down below was immediately attracted to the mirror as their gazes were filled with greed and desire.

[It’s a Dao Source Grade artifact! Moreover, it’s Mid-Rank… No, High-Rank!]

Although they were not sure about the uses of the mirror, they couldn’t ignore the fact that it was a High-Rank Dao Source Grade artifact. All of those guarding this portal were merely First-Order Dao Source Realms. Although they had Dao Source Grade artifacts themselves, those were just Low-Rank items. None of them even had a Mid-Rank artifact, much less a High-Rank one. In fact, none of them had even seen a Dao Source Grade High-Rank artifact before.

Even the Sect Masters of their Sects didn’t possess such a treasure! Normally, only the strongest Sects in the Ancestral Domain had such artifacts, and they were seen as Supreme Artifacts in their respective Sects.

*Gudong…* All of them gulped.

It was said that everyone only acted for benefits. To cultivators, good pills and high-grade artifacts were unspeakably attractive. By obtaining either one of these treasures, they could significantly increase their power and reach a higher realm.

“I know some information about Heng Luo Star Field. Let me have a look at the mirror first. If it’s good, I’ll tell you all you need to know.” The burly man spoke as he leapt into the air. At the same time, he covered He Yun Xiang in his Dao Source Realm aura. With his fingers forming into a claw, it was apparent that he intended to snatch the treasure.

The other Dao Source Realm Masters were shocked and cursed at the burly man. They had been staying together in the same place for far too long, so they knew each other’s temperament well. This burly man was reckless and unreasonable. If he managed to snatch the treasure, it would be hard to make him cough it out.

At that instant, all of them shot into the air and pounced on He Yun Xiang, targeting the mirror.

After a sigh, He Yun Xiang looked pitifully at these people who were coming at her.

Faced with so many Dao Source Realm Masters, not only was she, a Third-Order Origin King, not afraid, she even put on that kind of expression. Some of her attackers were amazed upon seeing this while at the same time, they felt that something was amiss.

Just then, a fist appeared mysteriously and came at the burly man at an incredible speed. It was so rapid that a scar in space was formed where the fist passed.

Before the fist even reached him, the burly man’s expression drastically changed as he widened his eyes. He opened his mouth to shout something, but before he could utter a word, his face was struck by the fist.

Like a watermelon that had been dropped from a hundred metres up, his blood exploded out while the momentum of the fist sent his headless corpse flying backward for some time before it landed in the swamp and caused a giant splash.

Everyone gasped as they froze in place. They hovered in mid-air as all their blood seemed to have been frozen over, even having difficulty gulping.

Their focus was now on the carefree-looking young man, who was lying on the Star Shuttle. Their gazes were filled with horror.

Just now, they clearly saw this young man make a move, after which the burly man was killed.

They knew the burly man’s power very well and none of them had the confidence to defeat him in a one-on-one fight. However, just now, a single fist was all it took to end his life. He was killed as easily as though he were an ant.

[Who is this man!?] Feeling fearful, they even quieted their breathing, afraid they would displease him by being too loud while he relaxed.

He Yun Xiang kept a smile on her face as she swept a glance over them, “Has no one heard about Heng Luo Star Field before?”

None of them dared to reply to her now, as they were worried that they would be killed as soon as they spoke.

He Yun Xiang went on to say, “Sir is a man of his word. If any one of you can provide any information about Heng Luo Star Field, this mirror will belong to you. Of course, it’d be best if you could also point out the Star Road Portal that leads to Heng Luo Star Field. Sir has said that he’ll give you an additional reward if you can provide such information.”

Only after some time did an elderly man muster enough courage to reply, “Madam, we know nothing about Heng Luo Star Field, and we have never heard of it before.”

He just wanted them to leave as quickly as possible, as they felt pressured with these two people around.

“That’s a shame,” He Yun Xiang didn’t expect to get any useful information on their first stop. Perhaps they wouldn’t even get a lead after visiting all the Star Road Portals; however, they still had to work hard and make the attempts.

“I swear it is the truth.” The elderly man said sincerely.

He Yun Xiang replied with a smile, “It’s fine. I believe you, but since all of you are guarding this place, please keep an eye on it for us. If anyone comes out of this portal, please ask where they’re from. If they come from Heng Luo Star Field, tell them to head to Azure Dragon City after three years. Tell them that Yang Kai will be waiting for them.”

Azure Dragon City was one of the top cities in the Ancestral Domain, so everyone knew about it, which was why it was a suitable gathering place. As for the timeframe, Yang Kai had calculated that they would need three years to visit all the Star Road Portals in the Ancestral Domain. It would be great if they could find a clue by then, but if they couldn’t, then they’d have no choice but to wait in Azure Dragon City.

“Yes, yes,” the elderly man hurriedly agreed.

He Yun Xiang uttered, “If possible, please help escort the person to Azure Dragon City when the time comes. All of you will be rewarded for your efforts.” Then, she raised the mirror with a smile, “Sir has many such things after all.”

All of them were shocked and became excited.

This was indeed some incredible news. By just escorting a person to Azure Dragon City, they would be able to obtain a Dao Source Grade High-Rank artifact. They probably couldn’t find such a good deal anywhere else in this world. Of course, the prerequisite was that a cultivator from Heng Luo Star Field would come out of their portal.

They silently memorized Yang Kai’s name, as this might be their opportunity to rise. At the same time, they speculated that this young man must have some powerful background, otherwise, he wouldn’t have told them his name even after he killed someone. Apparently, he wasn’t afraid that the force behind the burly man would retaliate against him.

Moreover, judging from the young man’s single move just now, his cultivation was profound. Anyone who wanted to take revenge on him would basically be asking for death.

The Star Shuttle then turned into a beam of light and disappeared from everyone’s sight.

…

For the next period of time, the pair visited more Star Road Portals and left behind the same reminder and request. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Some greedy men were killed while most made sure to remember Yang Kai’s name before promising to bring any cultivator from Heng Luo Star Field to Azure Dragon City three years later.

Just like that, half a year had passed. During this period of time, Yang Kai and He Yun Xiang tirelessly visited every Star Road Portal they could. He Yun Xiang knew that this matter was important to Yang Kai, so she had been very meticulous when carrying out her duty. Besides driving the Star Shuttle, she spent most of her free time cultivating, and she never complained.

Although it had been half a year since she arrived in the Ancestral Domain, she hadn’t been able to take a proper look at the sights and scenes of this place as she spent most of her time on the road, looking for people from Yang Kai’s homeland.

“Sir, we’ll arrive at the next portal soon.” The Star Road Chart in her hands played an important role, without which it would be akin to looking for a needle in a haystack if they were to aimlessly search around the Ancestral Domain.

As she spoke, she took a look at a little girl who seemed to only be about seven or eight years old with a weird expression.

One day about half a month ago, after He Yun Xiang finished her meditation, she opened her eyes and turned around, only to be shocked to see this little girl riding on her Star Shuttle. The girl’s facial features were delicate and adorable. There was no impurity behind her clear gaze, which seemed to sparkle with the radiance of a spring river.

Hearing how Yang Kai addressed her, she knew that her name was Liu Yan.

However, she failed to notice how Liu Yan appeared on her Star Shuttle. Moreover, this little girl was as strange as Yang Kai. There were no aura fluctuations around her, as though she had never cultivated before.

Nevertheless, when facing her, He Yun Xiang could feel an immense pressure that was just as intense as when she was facing Yang Kai.

[Is she as powerful as Sir?] He Yun Xiang couldn’t believe she would have this thought. After a person began cultivating, they would age slower, so it was difficult to tell a cultivator’s age by looking at their appearance. However, this was just a little girl, so how powerful could she be?

She had asked Yang Kai where Liu Yan was from, but all he told her was that he had picked her up from somewhere, which caused her to be torn between tears and laughter.

Moreover, she was puzzled as to how Liu Yan addressed Yang Kai. The little girl kept calling Yang Kai ‘Master’ without feeling ashamed. He Yun Xiang even suspected that he had a special fetish, which was why he wasn’t interested in a charming lady like her.

At this moment, Yang Kai was sitting cross-legged on the Star Shuttle, while Liu Yan was lying in his embrace as she fiddled with her own long and smooth hair. Both of them appeared bored as Yang Kai yawned and grunted.

Then, he suddenly turned to look in the distance and said with a grin, “It’s certainly bustling down there.”

Liu Yan immediately said, “Let’s go over and have a look!”

“No. What’s the point of watching a group of ants fight? Focus on our task.”

Liu Yan pouted.

“Alright. Alright. We’ll take a look.” Feeling helpless, Yang Kai pinched her face.

It was then that Liu Yan beamed at him. Her temperament seemed to have changed significantly during her time of cultivating in seclusion on Spirit Beast Island. After acquiring her Phoenix Bloodline, she really seemed to have turned into a child. Perhaps it was due to her inheritance.

Without waiting for his order, He Yun Xiang changed direction and headed for the crowd. At the same time, she used her Secret Technique to hide their figures and auras.

It was truly bustling below them. Hundreds of people were using their own Movement Skills as they charged forward at a speed that was as swift as the wind. A small number of people were leading the way at the front as their sleeves flapped in the air. Their auras were stable and powerful, apparently Dao Source Realm Masters. The most powerful one was even in the Third-Order Dao Source Realm. Besides him, there were five others in the Second-Order Dao Source Realm.

He Yun Xiang could feel immense pressure coming from these people.

Her concealment technique naturally couldn’t fool the senses of these people so they shot her a glance before looking away. Apparently, there was a more urgent issue at hand for them.
