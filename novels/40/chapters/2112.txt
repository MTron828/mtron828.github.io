Chapter 2112, Inquiry

“Let’s leave this discussion for another time.” Yang Kai stood up and observed her from above. He couldn’t help but curl his mouth into a faint smile and say, “Actually, if you want to regain your freedom, then it’s easily achievable.”

“What do you mean?” Hua Qing Si shivered and looked warily at Yang Kai. She said, “What are you up to?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yang Kai burst into laughter and said, “Relax, relax. I’m not after your body. But, if you really want to regain your freedom, then you have to hand over your Soul Imprint and I’ll give it some consideration. After all, a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivation is pretty good...”

“Keep daydreaming!” Hua Qing Si said through gnashed teeth and interrupted Yang Kai’s speech.

“Then... Farewell,” Yang Kai waved his hand at her then left the Small Sealed World.

He left the dumbstruck Hua Qing Si alone, sitting there in a trance for a long while before she came back to her senses and let out an aggrieved cry, “Come back, come back, come back...”

...

In the room, Yang Kai’s body appeared once again. He stood there in contemplation for a little while before his body turned into a light beam and flew out of the Zhang family’s residence. He was leaving for Maplewood City!

After a short moment, Yang Kai reached Maplewood City, but he didn’t seek Mo Xiao Qi or Kang Si Ran. Rather, he went toward the Qin family’s home.

He had already visited the Qin family once and knew its location. Moreover, after he swept the area with his Divine Sense, he immediately found Qin Yu’s location.

Yang Kai didn’t plan to hide his aura and he just casually walked toward her. In a short while, he reached a room and knocked on its window.

“Who is it?” a shout sounded from behind the door.

Yang Kai responded, and the person inside quieted for a while, then light footsteps echoed as she walked to the window and opened it.

Qin Yu looked in surprise and confusion at Yang Kai. She asked, “Yang... Senior Yang, why are you seeking me so late in the night?”

“Hmm, I have some questions for you,” Yang Kai replied and stuck his head inside to take a look at the room and said. “Can I come in?”

Qin Yu’s face got flushed and she said, “Senior, please come in.”

By the time her voice fell, Yang Kai had already jumped into the room through the window.

Upon seeing this, Qin Yu’s face reddened further. Yang Kai sneaked into her room through the window so late in the night, and if a person oblivious to the truth witnessed this, it would give rise to some awkward misunderstandings.

But, Qin Yu was still at ease as she trusted Yang Kai. After all, if someone with his power had any malicious aims, he could achieve his aims stealthily; he didn’t have to expose himself to her.

The room setting was refined and comfortable, while a pleasant fragrance was present here. This was Qin Yu’s personal room.

Yang Kai was aware that his actions were quite presumptuous, but he didn’t care.

After Yang Kai sat down, Qin Yu offered him a cup of tea and asked, “Senior, what questions do you have for me?”

Yang Kai took a sip of tea and said, “Miss, you are both pretty and exceptionally smart and you’re the most knowledgeable person I have ever known. I have come here hoping that you can dispel some of my doubts.”

Qin Yu pursed her lips and said with a smile, “Senior, I don’t deserve such high praise, I have only read more books than your average cultivator. But, if I can be of any help to you, then just go ahead and ask.”

Yang Kai smiled and said, “I’ll go right to the point, but I hope that today’s discussion...”

“I’ll take a Soul Oath that I won’t divulge it to anyone,” Qin Yu said sternly.

Yang Kai cast a glance at her, thinking, [it’s so easy to converse with smart people], then said, “I have been corrupted by the Demon Qi outside the city and I almost turned into a demon. You must have seen this, correct?”

Upon hearing him, fear flashed past her pretty eyes and she nodded, “That’s right, but Heaven helps the worthy and you have crossed this crisis with no mishap.”

“When I was corrupted by the Demon Qi and was on the verge of turning into a demon, many strange scenes emerged in my mind,” Yang Kai started making things up.

Qin Yu said in surprise, “Many strange scenes?”

“That’s right,” Yang Kai nodded and said. “At that time, we had cast a Secret Technique and we peered into the Ancient Great Demon’s silhouette within Jiang Chu He’s Knowledge Sea, which is likely a remnant will of the Ancient Great Demon hidden within the Demon Qi, and it has retained that demon’s memory and knowledge. After I was corrupted by the Demon Qi, I got a chance to peer into some affairs.”

“You’re not mistaken, and I agree with you,” Qin Yu said, gratified, as if she had just found a soul mate.

“But, what I have seen is completely different from what Jiang Chu He saw. Those scenes were also fragmented and intermittent, and didn’t have the Ancient Great Demon’s silhouette.”

“Huh? What kind of scenes?” Qin Yu got interested in this subject.

Yang Kai revealed a pensive look and said in a low voice, “There were numerous scenes and I have only seen two clearly. One of them has a golden and silver seed, with each colour taking up roughly half of its surface. After that seed had been planted, it grew into a Golden Silver Exotic Tree after innumerable years. The tree emitted overlapping silver and golden radiance and it looked quite mighty!”

“A golden and silver, two-coloured exotic tree?”

Upon hearing this, amazement showed up in her pretty voice, and she let out a cry, covering up her mouth.

“That’s right.” Yang Kai nodded and looked at her. He said, “I wonder whether you know that Golden Silver Exotic Tree?”

“I vaguely remember reading some records about this Exotic Tree.” Qin Yu furrowed her brows and tried to recall some information about it.

A stunned look appeared on Yang Kai’s face and he looked at her expectantly.

But, Qin Yu didn’t provide him with an answer even after a long while, and she only shook her head and said, “Senior, I’m sorry. I have seen records about it, but I can’t recall them in a short while. Please give me a few days and I’ll go to look up some ancient books I read before and look for some relevant records about it.”

“It’s fine, I’m not in a hurry. I’m only a little curious about it,” Yang Kai chuckled in response. He was quite disappointed, but he didn’t let it show up on his face.

“Senior, what’s the second scene you have seen?” Qin Yu asked.

“It’s a token, a pocket-sized token with a strange texture, neither wooden nor metallic. A ‘dragon’ word was carved on its surface and it looked like some ancient script, while the picture of a True Dragon soaring into the sky was carved on its back.”

When Yang Kai finished describing it, Qin Yu gave an answer. She said, “It’s the Dragon Island Token!”

“Is it really the Dragon Island Token?” Yang Kai was quite delighted.

Hua Qing Si had already told him so, but he didn’t trust her completely. Besides, Hua Qing Si couldn’t affirm that it was a genuine one. But, since even Qin Yu had as much, then it was likely genuine.

“If your description is accurate, then that’s the Dragon Island Token.” Qin Yu was so excited that her face turned flushed. “It’s said that only five Dragon Island Token appeared since ancient times, and three had already been used, while only two were left...”

She had recounted the same story as Hua Qing Si, and all details, including the number of the Dragon Island Tokens, their usage date, and locations, were the same.

It could be seen that Hua Qing Si didn’t lie and deceive Yang Kai.

“But...” As Qin Yu continued talking about it, a confused look appeared on her face. She asked in confusion, “Why has a Dragon Island Token appeared in the memory of the Ancient Great Demon’s remnant will.”

“Why wouldn’t it appear?” Yang Kai asked back.

“It’s because it doesn’t make sense time-wise. When the Ancient Great Demon was sealed, the Dragon Island Tokens hadn’t appeared yet... So, why does the Great Demon know of them?”

Qin Yu revealed a bewildered look.

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai lamented inwardly about his awful decision. He had just come to get an answer to his questions from Qin Yu and didn’t expect her to be so shrewd. She had quickly spotted a clear flaw in his story.

“I’m not sure about that, maybe it’s because the Ancient Great Demon detected that the Dragon Island Token posed a threat to it,” Yang Kai said and chuckled.

“That is possible,” Qin Yu didn’t dig into it. After all, those were all matters of the ancient past and she couldn’t get any concrete evidence about them.

“Fine, I have come here just to get an answer to those questions. It’s already so late and I won’t disturb your rest. Farewell,” Yang Kai said and stood up.

Qin Yu also stood up to bid farewell to him and she said, “I’ll quickly look into the Golden Silver Exotic Treem’s matter, and I’ll notify you the moment I find anything.”

“Got it!” He nodded and his body disappeared out of sight shortly after he walked out of the main door.

After a short moment, Qin Zhao Yang appeared suddenly next to the door to Qin Yu’s room and he gazed toward where Yang Kai had just been. He said with a strange look plastered on his face, “Yu’er, why did Brother Yang seek you?”

“It’s just to ask about some matters,” Qin Yu replied.

“What matters?” Qin Zhao Yang asked with a startled look.

Qin Yu stuck out her tongue and said, “It’s a secret!”

Qin Zhao Yang was taken back and he shook his head then said with a bitter smile, “Little girl, are you keeping secrets even from your Old Ancestor?”

Qin Yu said helplessly, “It isn’t up to me, I can’t tell you. But, I can still tell you that what Senior Yang asked isn’t related to Maplewood City or the Qin family.”

Qin Zhao Yang understood her implication and nodded. He said, “Then it’s fine.”

He quieted for a moment, then let out a sigh and said, looking at Qin Yu, “How is your body?”

“Alright!” Qin Yu replied.

“Don’t lie to me!” Qin Zhao Yang’s expression turned solemn. “Do you think I don’t know how much effort you have put into repairing the seal last time? I know that your body can’t keep on any longer.”

Qin Yu didn’t reply and kept her silence.

Qin Zhao Yang sighed and said, “If you didn’t have that constitution... someone with your talent may rise to the same height as our Qin family’s ancestor. But... It’s so frustrating, I’m so weak and can’t do anything to prolong your life or cure you. I’m really ashamed to face you.”

Qin Yu’s eyes turned flushed and she said in a low voice, “Old Ancestor, don’t disparage yourself, if I didn’t have your help, I would have died three years ago. I’m already happy to live for three more years and my sole regret is that I can’t stay by your side and help you, and I have even troubled you.”

“You can set your mind at ease, I’ll come up with a solution, I won’t let you die in your early years,” Qin Zhao Yang said in a deep voice before his body flickered and disappeared.

Qin Yu had just opened her mouth to speak, yet Qin Zhao Yang had already disappeared from her sight.

After she mulled this over for a moment, her pretty face fell, as if she had realized what Qin Zhao Yang was up to.
