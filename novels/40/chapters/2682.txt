The next day, Yang Kai was meditating when someone knocked on his door.

After scanning with his Divine Sense, he found that it was Ye Jing Han and Du Xian.

Yang Kai opened the door and looked at the two of them, “What is it?”

Ye Jing Han answered in a trembling voice, “Young Master Yang, Flowing Shadow Sword Sect sent my father here. He is outside the inn now.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Sect Master Ye?” The image of Ye Hen surfaced in Yang Kai’s mind as he nodded lightly, “Looks like Li Qing Yun knows how he should act. Since he sent him to us, just accept it.”

“Master was delivered here by Li Qing Yun himself,” Du Xian remarked embarrassingly.

Li Qing Yun was a First-Order Emperor Realm Master, while Ye Jing Han and he were just Dao Source Realm cultivators; they did not have the qualification to talk face to face with him. Furthermore, they had no clue what Flowing Shadow Sword Sect was up to with this gesture, so they could only ask Yang Kai to face him for them.

After listening to the situation, Yang Kai nodded in understanding, “Then I’ll go with you.”

“Many thanks, Brother Yang!” Du Xian expressed his gratitude.

“It’s nothing,” Yang Kai smiled, but he actually sighed in his heart. If he was right, the extermination of Thousand Leaves Sect this time must have something to do to him.

The three of them strode outside, and Ying Fei also came out of nowhere, following behind Yang Kai.

When they arrived outside the inn, they saw that Li Qing Yun was indeed standing there. He was styled exactly like a swordsman, dressed in white and carrying his sword on him.

Standing in front of him was Ye Hen. Although he looked a little depressed, there was no sign of torture on him. He probably just felt deflated due to the extermination of his Sect and the death and injuries of so many of his disciples.

“Father!”

“Honoured Master!” Ye Jing Han and Du Xian shouted together and quickly glared at Li Qing Yun.

Ye Hen lifted his head and looked at them with a wry smile.

Thousand Leaves Sect had endured for over ten thousand years, but now it had been destroyed under his leadership. He felt ashamed of himself for failing the trust of his ancestors; however, seeing his daughter and his Eldest Disciple again after one year brightened his mood somewhat.

Li Qing Yun did not say anything as he lightly cupped his fists towards Yang Kai, then walked away without looking back.

It seemed that his purpose for this trip was only to send Ye Hen back.

As he said, the mastermind behind the scenes had gotten what he wanted and it did not matter to him anymore whether Ye Hen lived or died. It was also because of this that Ye Hen could keep his life after being captured by Flowing Shadow Sword Sect, otherwise he would have just been killed on the spot.

“Father!” Ye Jing Han rushed forward and carefully checked Ye Hen. After making sure his arms or legs were still intact, only then did she release a sigh of relief.

“Sect Master Ye!” Yang Kai went forward and greeted him with his fists cupped.

“Young Master Yang!” Ye Hen and Yang Kai were acquaintances, so seeing him together with his daughter and Eldest Disciple, Ye Hen’s heart filled with gratitude knowing that he could only get out of trouble this time thanks to Yang Kai’s help.

“Let’s talk inside,” Yang Kai beckoned.

Ye Hen nodded, and walked into the inn step by step with the support of Ye Jing Han and Du Xian.

After entering the room, Yang Kai asked for a meal to be prepared as the few of them sat cross-legged, drinking as they talked.

Ye Jing Han asked about Ye Hen’s recent treatment out of concern, and learnt that he was not tortured in Flowing Shadow Sword Sect, just detained. Hearing this, her hatred for the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect was reduced slightly.

But after this tragedy, Ye Hen seemed to have aged a lot all of a sudden, acting like he was being weighed down by heavy burdens. He downed one cup of wine after another, looking truly dispirited.

He had remained in the Third-Order Dao Source Realm for a long time, but back then, when Yang Kai retrieved the long-lost inheritance of Thousand Leaves Sect from Emperor Heaven Valley, Ye Hen gained the confidence to break through to the Emperor Realm in his lifetime. However, before he could achieve his ambitions, his Sect was destroyed by powerful enemies.

Sure enough, the world was unpredictable.

After bearing such a heavy impact, Ye Hen was not sure if he would still stand a chance of becoming an Emperor Realm Master in his lifetime.

Yang Kai lowered his cup as he said solemnly, “Sect Master Ye, the incident of Thousand Leaves Sect this time may have something to do with me.”

Flabbergasted, Ye Hen glanced at him, thinking he had misunderstood something. After a short silence, he replied with a wry smile, “It has nothing to do with Young Master Yang. This matter is because of Senior Hua.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “Sister Hua is just an added incentive. Chi Yue, Ai Ou and my other Seniors were their real targets.”

Ye Hen was surprised, “Why do you say so?”

Ye Jing Han and Du Xian also looked at Yang Kai, bewildered.

Yang Kai took a moment to collect his thoughts before continuing, “I don’t have a complete explanation yet, so what I say now is just my own conclusions. I believe this is all a conspiracy aimed at me, with Thousand Leaves Sect just happening to be involved. The ultimate purpose of everything was to draw me to Flowing Shadow City.”

Ye Hen was dumbstruck. If it was like what Yang Kai said, the Thousand Leaves Sect was really unlucky.

“Forgive me!” Yang Kai looked at Ye Hen and apologized sincerely.

Ye Hen laughed wryly, “Young Master Yang, you don’t have to feel guilty. This was an inevitable disaster our Thousand Leaves Sect had to face. This Ye will never dare to forget the kindness Young Master Yang showed for our Thousand Leaves Sect. Even if Young Master Yang was involved in this incident, this Ye will not utter a single word of blame or rebuke. If anyone is to blame, it is Thousand Leaves Sect for being so weak that it could not resist when confronted with its enemies.”

Yang Kai continued, “Sect Master Ye may rest assured that no matter who is the mastermind behind all of this, I will obtain justice for your Thousand Leaves Sect.”

Ye Hen smiled lightly, “With the words of Young Master Yang, this Ye is relieved. But… the enemy is hiding in the dark, while we walk in the light. Young Master Yang, are you really that confident?”

Ye Jing Han glanced at Ying Fei, then leaned towards Ye Hen and whispered in his ear.

Ye Hen was taken aback when he heard the words she spoke and immediately turned to Ying Fei, “So, this is Sir Monster King. Please forgive this Ye for his lack of respect.”

A heavy stone was lifted from Ye Hen’s heart when he heard this. Given the great strength of Yang Kai and the additional assistance of a Monster King, there was nothing more for him to worry about.

Ying Fei waved his hand with a faint smile.

Yang Kai announced, “The auction is the time when everything will come to light. When it comes, the mastermind will surely show his fangs, and the truth behind this matter will be revealed. At that time, I will kill him.”

Ye Hen straightened up, and declared with a solemn face, “Young Master Yang, please accept my bow.”

Thousand Leaves Sect did not have the ability to avenge itself anymore. If Yang Kai could take revenge for the Thousand Leaves Sect, he would be a true patron to the Thousand Leaves Sect.

Yang Kai shook his head while lifting Ye Hen up with his hands, “Sect Master Ye, don’t be like this. At this point, I can’t stay out of this matter anymore. All that’s left now is to see who is stronger.”

Then, they continued to drink for a while before Yang Kai said goodbye and returned to his room.

Everything was peaceful for the next half a month.

As expected, Zhu Qing stopped coming to disturb him, like she had totally vanished from the world, which actually pleased Yang Kai greatly.

Although that woman was a great beauty, extremely pleasing to the eyes, and a brand new experience to ‘have fun’ with, she was still a Dragon Girl after all. Yang Kai was really unwilling to take things too far with her.

During this period, plenty of Emperor Realm Masters arrived in Flowing Shadow City for the Heaven Grade Puppets of Thousand Leaves Sect. After all, every Heaven Grade Puppet was equivalent to an Emperor Realm Master, so it would never be a bad idea to buy one and bring it back to guard one’s Sect. The Star Source in Ai Ou’s body was extremely tempting as well.

Yang Kai had investigated Flowing Shadow City numerous times, but he still could not find any trace of Chi Yue, Ai Ou or his other Seniors. He had no choice but to give up on this approach.

Nevertheless, it was obvious that the enemy was not stupid enough to give Yang Kai chances. By the looks of it, the enemy would not expose their cards before the auction started.

On this day, the Flowing Shadow City that had been quiet for so long suddenly became lively, especially at the entrance of Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce, which was bustling with heavy traffic.

As one of the two top chambers of commerce in the Southern Territory, the Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce had naturally opened a branch in Flowing Shadow City, and the auction was held at this branch of the Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce.

All the Emperor Realm Masters who received invitations arrived as scheduled.

There were two rows of young girls waiting respectfully in front of the chamber of commerce, and whenever an honoured guest arrived, they would greet them with welcoming smiles before ushering them into the auction house. These girls were as beautiful as flowers and their graceful figures could be vaguely seen through their tulle dresses, attracting the eyes of the crowd.

Without a doubt, they were professionally trained, each one of them wearing a warm smile that made people feel at home while their soft voices lifted the spirits of those who heard them.

Li Qing Yun, the Sect Master of Flowing Shadow Sword Sect, also stood outside the chamber of commerce. He was like a statue, his hand on the grip of the Jade Illusion Sword, his eyes closed shut. He withdrew his Sword Intent, appearing just like an ordinary commoner. However, people who knew him would know that he was not someone who they could mess with. At this moment, he was just like a sword in its sheath. Once the sword was drawn, the whole world would fill with his murderous intent.

Suddenly, Li Qing Yun opened his eyes and looked forward, a trace of fear and helplessness flashing across his sharp eyes.

In front of him, a group of five advanced in a confident manner, barging in like they owned this place. All the guests around glared at them, but once they recognized the faces of these people, they immediately retreated to one side with fearful expressions and their heads lowered, as if they were avoiding meeting eyes with these tigers.

This group of five was led by a young man. Among them was a man with a sinister face and a hooked nose, a young couple, and an elderly man.

It was Yang Kai and his group.

When they reached the front of the chamber of commerce, Yang Kai looked at Li Qing Yun with a grin, “Is Sect Master Li here to welcome the guests? What an honour!”

The expression of helplessness on Li Qing Yun’s face intensified as the corner of his mouth twitched, revealing a speechless look.

“Hahaha, this must be Young Master Yang Kai. Young Master Yang’s arrival is truly a great honour for me. Please come inside quickly!”

A hearty and enthusiastic laugh came from the side.

Yang Kai turned to the source of the voice and saw an ordinary-looking middle-aged man walking out from the side to greet him with a smile. This smiling look caught Yang Kai’s eyes and caused him to frown.

“Who are you?” Yang Kai questioned.

“It’s you!” Ye Jing Han and Du Xian gave out a low cry as they stared at the middle-aged man fearfully.

Ye Hen’s body also trembled as flames burned in his eyes.

“Do you know him?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

Ye Jing Han replied with her teeth gritted, “He was the one who suppressed our Thousand Leaves Sect’s Heaven Grade Puppets! And he was also the one who came looking for Senior Hua!”

“This one is Wu Ming!” The middle-aged man smiled lightly and continued to address Yang Kai, ignoring the three people from Thousand Leaves Sect, for these three trivial ants did not really deserve his attention.

Yang Kai’s eyes turned cold and he responded faintly, “So, is it you who is behind all these good deeds?”

Wu Ming beamed, “Young Master Yang jests. How could this one… What do you think you’re doing!?”

Before he finished, Wu Ming was taken aback because Yang Kai suddenly swung his hand to slap him. Emperor Qi surged and the surrounding World Energy shook. Although he was a Minor Realm higher in cultivation than Yang Kai, Wu Ming was shocked to find that he had no chance to avoid this blow.

He did not expect Yang Kai to be so dauntless and rush at him as soon as he appeared. He had not taken any precautions at all, and it was a bit too late when he reacted to the incoming slap.
