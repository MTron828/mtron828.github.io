Origin King Grade artifacts were extremely powerful, and Xue Yue was not an ordinary cultivator. Her personal strength was extraordinary, but even this attack from her was unable to kill all the Illusionary Void Butterflies, which only showed how terrifying their resilience was.

At the same time Xue Yue took action, Yang Kai did as well.

With a single thought, more than twenty Golden Blood Threads exuding a golden red light shot out and transformed into the appearance of Blood Beasts.

Thunder-Flame Flying Lizard, Tail Crown Snake, Steel-Flame Ghost Spider, Silent Vermillion Bird, Star King Turtle, Eight-Eyed Demon Toad, Purple-Thunderbolt Sky Leopard, and many more. These Blood Beasts spread out as soon as they appeared, surrounding Yang Kai and Xue Yue in a strong protective circle. Soon, under the control of Yang Kai’s Divine Sense, they used their own methods to attack to deal with the surrounding Illusionary Void Butterflies.

Blood Beasts inherited most of the abilities of these Monster Beasts they were condensed from, and although their actions were a bit dull compared to their living counterparts, they were undoubtedly an excellent boost at this time.

As soon as the twenty or so Blood Beasts of different sizes were dispatched, they immediately formed a solid defence, greatly reducing the pressure Yang Kai and Xue Yue were facing.

*Weng weng weng...*

The sound of fluttering Illusionary Void Butterfly wings was endless, and not only did they not seem to fear death, but they also seemed driven by some primal instinct to kill living creatures that weren’t part of their swarm.

The Blood Beasts, which exuded a strong Blood Qi, instantly became the most attractive targets for the Illusionary Void Butterflies.

As such, Yang Kai and Xue Yue, who were in the middle position, were temporarily safe.

Seeing this, Xue Yue could not help relaxing slightly and focused her attention on attacking, using her artifact to kill the surrounding Illusionary Void Butterflies.

Yang Kai was not idle either, using the dozens of remaining Golden Blood Threads to slash through the air, cutting one Illusionary Void Butterfly in half after another.

However, as time passed, he found that their situation was not improving. The four Origin Kings were still fighting on their own, surrounded by countless Illusionary Void Butterflies, and the corpses of Illusionary Void Butterflies had already formed a thick layer on the ground.

Yang Kai frowned deeply.

The situation around him made him realize that it was impossible to kill these Illusionary Void Butterflies completely, and if they continued to fight like this, everyone would eventually exhaust their strength and become food for these ancient insects.

On top of that, Yang Kai’s Blood Beasts had also taken damage. Although they were all transformed from his Golden Blood Threads and were not real living creatures, as the Illusionary Void Butterflies continued to attack, they wore down their energy and the vitality fluctuations emanating from the Blood Beasts were growing weaker and weaker.

“Xue Yue, we have to leave this place,” Yang Kai whispered to Xue Yue beside him.

“But Uncle Ni...” Xue Yue hesitantly looked towards Ni Guang but was unable to even see his figure as he was entirely wrapped in a multi-coloured cloud. Only the violent energy fluctuations radiating from there served as proof Ni Guang was still fighting.

“Senior Ni’s cultivation is profound, you don’t need to worry about him. As long as we can escape, he should be fine,” Yang Kai comforted.

“Then are you sure we can escape from here?” Xue Yue asked, turning her head.

Yang Kai quickly said, “Even if I’m not, we have to try. In any case, it’s better than just sitting here waiting to die.”

Hearing him say this, Xue Yue nodded, grit her teeth, and agreed, “Fine, I’ll follow you!”

She had received Ni Guang’s warning in advance and had a foreboding feeling at the time that this would happen, so she didn’t hesitate much.

“Then come with me,” Yang Kai declared solemnly, his thoughts flashing as he ordered the Blood Beasts to focus their attacks on a particular spot, instantly opening a gap in the Illusionary Void Butterflies besieging them.

“Go!” Yang Kai shouted in a low voice as his figure flickered and he pulled Xue Yue’s arm while rushing out from the gap.

In the next moment, the twenty or so Blood Beasts twisted and returned to their golden and red Golden Blood Threads before disappearing into Yang Kai’s body.

Suddenly losing their targets, the Illusionary Void Butterflies seemed to be taken aback for a moment, but soon they began flapping their wings and chasing after Yang Kai and Xue Yue.

At this time, Yang Kai did not have the liberty to conceal his strength anymore and pushed his Space Force, allowing him to race forward at an impressive speed.

Using his Space Force, his speed suddenly increased, and Xue Yue was stunned for a moment as she realized what moving as swiftly as the wind really meant.

But soon, Yang Kai frowned because he discovered that his Space Force was greatly restricted in this Severed World.

This damned place was filled with Void Cracks, causing the ambient space to be unstable. In addition, the Illusionary Void Butterflies interfered with the surrounding space when they moved, hindering his use of Space Force.

This discovery made Yang Kai’s face sink, but what made him truly angry was that after he escaped from the encirclement, someone else chased after him.

It was Elder Xu Wei from Abandoned Lair!

Xu Wei also seemed exhausted at the moment and was being chased by countless Illusionary Void Butterflies, but he didn’t pay any of this mind and instead desperately pursued Yang Kai and Xue Yue. Even if he was attacked by the butterflies, he did not try to fight back and instead focused on dodging. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“What’s he trying to do?” Xue Yue faintly realized what was wrong.

Yang Kai coldly snorted, “He wants to overtake us then use us as bait while he runs away!”

There was a saying that when being chased by an invincible enemy, what matters most was not being the fastest among your companions, but instead not being the slowest!

Although Yang Kai and Xue Yue were not Xu Wei’s companions, he clearly intended to use them to his advantage. As long as he could use Yang Kai and Xue Yue to delay the Illusionary Void Butterflies chasing him, he would have a good chance to escape from these annoying ancient insects.

On the other hand, even though Ni Guang had discovered what Xu Wei was trying to do, he was unable to stop him. At this moment, Ni Guang had to focus on defending himself so he could only roar furiously towards Xu Wei’s back.

“Despicable and shameless!” After understanding Xu Wei’s intentions, Xue Yue ground her teeth and shouted, a fierce look filling her face.

Yang Kai, however, just sneered, “One’s actions will always be judged by the Heavens. If he wants to plot against us, he’ll need to have the ability first.”

Contrary to the others, Yang Kai was not concerned with Xu Wei’s actions.

In just a few breaths, Yang Kai and Xue Yue had rushed out several dozen kilometres, with Ni Guang and the others having long disappeared from their field of vision. Only a large swarm of Illusionary Void Butterflies and Xu Wei were following behind.

Xu Wei was also being pursued by more Illusionary Void Butterflies.

While fleeing, Yang Kai constantly scanned his surroundings with his Divine Sense.

Soon, he found what he was looking for and rushed towards a certain direction with Xue Yue.

In that direction, there was a Void Crack that was invisible to the naked eye and Yang Kai believed that Xu Wei would not be able to sense it even if he released his Divine Sense.

As long as he followed them closely, there was a chance Xu Wei would hit this hidden Void Crack and even if he didn’t die, he would certainly be wounded!

Yang Kai deliberately brought Xue Yue extremely close to the invisible Void Crack to interfere with Xu Wei’s judgment.

However, what Yang Kai had not anticipated was that the countless Illusionary Void Butterflies chasing them could also sense the existence of this Void Crack and flew around it.

This scene naturally was not missed by the pursuing Xu Wei.

Xu Wei was still an Origin King with extremely rich experience and a cautious personality. Although he could not detect the Void Crack himself, he could infer its existence from the behaviour of the Illusionary Void Butterflies.

As such, he followed the path the Illusionary Void Butterflies took and managed to avoid the Void Crack unscathed!

Yang Kai almost could not stop himself from cursing, never having imagined that Xu Wei would actually be saved by the Illusionary Void Butterflies in this situation.

As time passed, both the Illusionary Void Butterflies and Xu Wei behind them drew closer and closer, and the situation seemed to be verging on Yang Kai and Xue Yue being surrounded again.

By now, Xu Wei had relaxed a lot, because the Illusionary Void Butterflies, which had been chasing him and Kong Fa had now been dispersed into several smaller groups. At this moment, there were not many chasing behind him.

With his means, if he were to fight hard, he might even have a chance to kill off all the Illusionary Void Butterflies chasing him.

However, if he did that, he would consume a great deal of his strength and would likely suffer injuries. In this Severed World, he had to always maintain his peak condition to cope with possible dangers, so this was only an option of last resort.

As such, he came up with the idea of sacrificing ​​Yang Kai and Xue Yue.

The speed of these two young men surprised him a bit, but when he recalled Xue Yue’s identity, he was not too concerned. He thought that the speed of Yang Kai and Xue Yue being so fast was all thanks to Xue Yue. Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce’s Young Master certainly had to cultivate some incredible Secret Techniques.

But... that was all it was.

Looking at the two figures that were only a few kilometres ahead of him, Xu Wei’s eyes flashed a vicious light.

Immediately, he activated a Secret Technique by forming a series of mysterious seals with his hands.

In the next moment, Xu Wei’s body suddenly released a brilliant red light and a kind of blood mist burst from his pores. The moment this light appeared, Xu Wei’s speed suddenly increased to an incredible level.

The short distance of a few kilometres was closed in an instant and Xu Wei easily overtook Yang Kai and Xue Yue.

This was not the end of his plot though as Xu Wei condensed his Saint Qi and sent a palm towards Yang Kai and Xue Yue behind him.

There was no murderous intent in this palm because he didn’t want to take the lives of these two, instead planning on wounding them so they would be caught by the Illusionary Void Butterflies and delay them for him.

“Damn!” Xue Yue shouted angrily as she threw out her artifact to meet Xu Wei’s attack.

*Hong...*

With a loud bang, and a fierce energy explosion, a shockwave struck Yang Kai and Xue Yue, forcing them to reduce their speed in order to stabilize themselves.

“Haha!” Xu Wei laughed wildly as he looked back at Yang Kai and Xue Yue jokingly, “Little brats, don’t die too easily!”

At this moment, he wore a victorious and treacherous grin on his face.

“You want to run?” Yang Kai’s expression became cold as his eyes fixed onto Xu Wei’s, his left eye suddenly becoming golden as a lotus bud appeared in its pupil!
