Below the Two Worlds Passage, Demon Saint Mo Duo’s sudden appearance next to the Evergreen Divine Tree instantly extinguished any glimmer of hope that the Barbarian Race had. No one could stand against the Demon Saint unless the Evergreen Divine Tree fought him personally, not even Yang Kai.

But how could Senior Qing spare any attention or energy to fight against a Demon Saint now? All his concentration was being used to seal the Two Worlds Passage, shutting out all other distractions from the external environment. Senior Qing was now burning his life essence and had no way to stop and focus on other tasks.

“I’m just a Shaman King. Does Sir Mo Duo have to bully the weak?”

“Haha…”

Mo Duo laughed softly, revealing a harmless smile. If one did not know his identity, they would think he was an amiable man, completely different from the other vicious Demons, “You’re not weak at all.”

Yang Kai pursed his lip, “But I’m still weaker than you. You have your battle and I have mine. Let’s mind our own business and not interfere with each other, shall we?”

Mo Duo replied with a helpless look, “I’m afraid I can’t. This big tree of yours is a little strange. If we let it continue to grow, I’m afraid our connection to the Demon Realm will be completely cut off, so I have to destroy it. Sorry.”

Yang Kai remained calm while listening to his words, but was secretly overjoyed.

Because Mo Duo inadvertently disclosed information, confirming that Senior Qing truly had the ability to seal the Two Worlds Passage. Now what he needed to do was to buy enough time for Senior Qing to finish his work.

Yang Kai sighed and continued helplessly, “I understand what Sir means.”

Mo Duo remained smiling, and asked as he nodded, “Are you ready to die?” After a pause, he pressed on, “Actually, you can take refuge under me, then we wouldn’t have to fight each other.”

Yang Kai answered solemnly, “Many thanks, Sir, this Shaman Niu truly appreciates it, but… this Shaman Niu was born a Barbarian and will die a Barbarian. I can’t take refuge under the Demon Race.”

His proud declaration was heard by the people of the Shaman Niu Clan below, and everyone looked at Yang Kai in awe.

Mo Duo shrugged, “I have no choice then. Alright, enough nonsense, you can die now.”

He spoke with a calm and relaxed tone, as if a butcher were facing a chicken.

When the words fell, he reached out to grab Yang Kai.

This move may have seemed casual, but the World Principles trembled as Mo Duo extended his hand. Yang Kai inexplicably felt that the surrounding space became viscous, like he had fallen into a quagmire. The more he struggled, the deeper he sank.

Demon Saints and Shaman Saints were comparable to the Great Emperors of modern times. These Masters had reached the point where they could communicate with the World itself and had touched upon the threshold of the Grand Dao. Therefore, even the most ordinary of attacks they used contained a profound and overwhelming power.

Space Principles around Yang Kai fluctuated, and after a short pause, he suddenly disappeared.

A soft thud on the ground where he stood before was heard, as if something was broken open. After the sound, everyone could clearly see signs of collapse in the local space.

Mo Duo tilted his head and looked over, his eyes twinkling with interest as he mused, “Space Techniques are indeed amazing. I’m more and more reluctant to kill you. If you could assist the Great Demon God, it would be far easier for us Demons to establish connections to other Great Worlds. Perhaps the Great Demon God would even be able to personally descend to these Great Worlds.”

“If you’re reluctant to kill me, then don’t,” Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and forced a smile, “Why don’t we just stop all this violence and have a nice civilized discussion instead; let the others worry about the war.”

Mo Duo shook his head, “My task is to kill you or capture you, so I’m afraid that I can’t continue to chit chat with you.”

He flicked his fingers as he finished his sentence, and a pitch-black beam of energy suddenly launched towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai countered with a Moon Blade. The two attacks collided in mid-air and vanished in an instant.

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, “Sir, this is not your full strength. Are you holding back on me?”

“Haha…” Mo Duo smiled lightly without stopping his hands, his Demon Qi surging as a huge black blade flew at Yang Kai without warning. At the same time, he declared, “This is my full strength now. I’m not holding back.”

Yang Kai frowned slightly and instinctively did not want to believe it, but he could sense that Mo Duo was not lying. Although the power that he unleashed was quite strong, it did not seem to be strong to a degree that Yang Kai could not handle.

Right now, it seemed as if he had the same strength as when he first arrived in this world.

When Mo Duo arrived into this world two years ago, he had paid a steep price in order to cross the Two Worlds Passage. As a result, his strength was greatly reduced, and that was why Yang Kai could escape from him with his teleportation technique.

Mo Duo’s strength should have been restored to its peak after these past two years, but now his performance was not much different from what it was two years ago. The only difference was that he did not have the same frail feeling as before.

The power of a Demon Saint should not be like this. Therefore, Yang Kai couldn’t help being on guard.

He teleported again to dodge Mo Duo’s attack.

But just then, Mo Duo’s eyes suddenly flashed, gazing into the endless Void.

He immediately caught a trace of Yang Kai. Space Techniques were not all-powerful. Although Yang Kai could enter and exit the Void freely in order to move great distances in an instant, he would still reveal some traces of his movements to peak-level Masters.

Mo Duo was exactly this kind of Master, and with a wave of his hand, he sent an impact into the Void.

With a bang, space tore apart and Yang Kai’s figure appeared with a stagger.

At the same time, a large pitch-black net emerged to enclose this region, seemingly wanting to capture Yang Kai inside it.

Yang Kai’s face changed as he raised his hands and used his Time Flies Seal with all his strength.

Following an explosion, the large pitch-black net halted for a moment, allowing Yang Kai to slip away, avoiding capture. When he straightened up again, his back was already drenched in a cold sweat.

Mo Duo had launched two strikes but failed to produce the desired effect, so he could only sigh helplessly, “Looks like fifty percent of my strength is really not enough.”

“Fifty percent?” Yang Kai glared at him angrily, “Didn’t you just say that you were using all your strength. Now you say it’s just fifty percent? Which statement is true?”

Mo Duo answered indifferently, “Both.”

He raised his hand and waved in a certain direction. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Yang Kai stiffened in vigilance as he thought that Mo Duo was going to use another Divine Ability or Secret Technique, but after Mo Duo waved, he did not notice any sign of attack. Instead, a pitch-black light shot out from that direction and rushed into Mo Duo’s body before disappearing.

Mo Duo’s aura, which was already strong enough to give Yang Kai a headache, suddenly soared. A trace of ferocity was added to Mo Duo’s usual warm smile as if the surge of power seemed to affect his mentality, drawing a grin from his lips as he commented, “This is seventy percent!”

Yang Kai gritted his teeth, “You’re a Soul Clone?”

Mo Duo responded, “I am who I am. There is no clone or original. I am also over there!”

His ‘over there’ obviously referred to the battlefield of the Saints.

Only now did Yang Kai realize that the Shaman Saints did not allow Mo Duo to inadvertently escape because Mo Duo was still fighting against the Shaman Saints on that side while this figure was just a clone of sorts.

This Soul Clone was obviously an emergency means of the Demon Race, and it had proved to be useful. Without Mo Duo’s intervention, the Evergreen Divine Tree could not be disturbed, but Yang Kai had to be as careful as walking on thin ice because of Mo Duo’s sudden emergence.

What made it more difficult for Yang Kai was that Mo Duo’s strength seemed to be able to freely transfer between his primary body and his Soul Clone.

He could not stop Yang Kai’s teleportation ability with just fifty percent of his strength, so Mo Duo had boosted his Soul Clone’s power to seventy percent. If his strength on one side was increased, his strength on the other side would naturally be reduced.

“I know what you’re plotting,” Mo Duo spoke with a casual tone, “It’s nothing more than delaying time with me so that you can seal the passage that connects the two Great Worlds. However, you won’t have this chance now, because you’re no longer… a match for me!”

When he finished his sentence, Mo Duo suddenly appeared in front of Yang Kai, raised his hand, and stabbed at his chest.

Yang Kai’s face changed drastically. The residual figure of Mo Duo was still present in his vision, but his attack was already close at hand.

In panic, Yang Kai instinctively tried to teleport away, but he found that the surrounding space was completely confined, and he could not move at all.

The corner of Mo Duo’s mouth curved into a cruel smile, and his hand, which was covered in rich Demon Qi, penetrated through Yang Kai’s chest.

Unexpectedly though, no blood spurted. There wasn’t even a tactile feeling that he was supposed to feel, so Mo Duo frowned. Only then did he realize that Yang Kai’s body had turned into a dim illusory phantom, and that his hand had directly passed through this phantom without any resistance.

Yang Kai revealed a terrified look, as if he was enduring great pain. He leapt back with his faint-looking body, almost vanishing into thin air, and broke free from Mo Duo’s control.

When his body solidified again, Yang Kai spewed a mouthful of blood; he was badly hurt.

He took out a handful of pills and stuffed them directly into his mouth to chew, cold sweat dripping from his head like a waterfall.

“Is this also a Space Technique?” Mo Duo frowned slightly. The fatal blow he had delivered was actually resolved by this Shaman Niu in a way he could not understand, and although the latter still looked injured, it was a far cry from Mo Duo’s expected result.

This was not what Mo Duo wanted to see.

“Space Techniques aren’t limited to just instantaneous movement,” Yang Kai swallowed the pills in his mouth and once again struck up a conversation with Mo Duo in order to give himself some time to recover, “I call the skill Nihility.”

“Merging with the Void in order to avoid powerful attacks,” Mo Duo praised him with his eyes lit up. “A good ability.”

Yang Kai responded, “But you’re too strong. Although most of your strength simply passed through me, some of it still shook the Void and was transmitted to me, almost killing me.”

“I see!” Mo Duo was enlightened, then put on a thoughtful look as he continued, “It seems like killing you will not be so easy.”
