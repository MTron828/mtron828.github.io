“Take care, Brother-in-Law. Come back soon to pick us up!”

Zhang Ruo Yu’s voice sounded from behind, causing Yang Kai who was flying towards Maplewood City to almost dive headfirst into the ground when he heard.

The Zhang Family seemed to have decided that something was going on between Ruo Xi and him.

Yang Kai didn’t bother to argue with them either, so after discussing with the Old Madam of the Zhang Family, he told them to pack their bags and be ready to leave. However, Yang Kai still had some business to settle, and he naturally couldn’t leave right away, so he asked the Zhang Family to wait for him to finish up before he brought them back to his Sect.

Before leaving, Yang Kai left eight Blood Beasts at the Zhang Family just in case anything happened.

These Blood Beasts were refined when he wasn’t that strong, and with the improvement of his strength, he basically had no use for them anymore, but they still had Dao Source Realm-level strength, so they would be a big help when placed in the Zhang Family.

As long as no Emperor Realm Masters came to start trouble with the Zhang Family, these Blood Beasts could protect them for now. But of course, Yang Kai also left the Zhang Family a way to contact him in case of any accidents and also so he could contact them when he was finished with his business.

After being gone a few years from Maplewood City and coming back, things really had changed.

Take, for example, Spirit Lake City. Dao Source Realm cultivators were already a common sight now, while Emperor Realm Masters flew to and fro through the sky, the law enforcement teams not even daring to meddle with them.

Yang Kai headed towards where the Qin Family resided.

A young servant wearing a round cap stood at the entrance, and when he saw Yang Kai walk over, he asked respectfully, “Sir, may this little one ask whom you are seeking?”

“Qin Yao Zhang, Patriarch of the Qin Family. Please pass on the message for me,” Yang Kai responded.

“You’re here to see the Patriarch?” The servant was a little stunned and asked carefully, “May I ask for your name?”

“Just tell him that someone surnamed Yang has come to visit.”

The servant nodded his head, excused himself, and headed into the residence.

Yang Kai stood outside with both hands behind his back, but seeing no movements for a long while, he frowned and probed into the Qin Family with his Divine Sense.

From what he could see with his Divine Sense, things were not much different from when he left back then. The Qin Family did not seem to have gained much from Maplewood City’s rise, but that was not hard to understand. The Qin Family was just a small family to begin with, so although Maplewood City had expanded rapidly, it was too difficult for the Qin Family to reap any significant benefits.

But overall, the cultivators in the Qin Family had improved in strength, likely due to the now rich World Energy in Maplewood City.

[Qin Yu!]

Suddenly, Yang Kai noticed Qin Yu’s figure inside one of the secret rooms. After not seeing her for a few years, this little girl had actually reached the Second-Order Dao Source Realm. Her weak self in the past had been cast off, and her figure had matured quite a lot, with a rosy complexion now adorning her face instead of a pale one. From the looks of it, she was currently in retreat inside a cultivation room.

As expected of the World Tribulation Body, even though she had been facing a fatal disaster, after overcoming it she had received a giant opportunity.

Qin Yu, who was cultivating, suddenly opened her eyes as if she had sensed something, and her beautiful gaze suddenly looked towards Yang Kai’s direction through the many layers of obstructions. A mysterious light flashed across her eyes as if they could pierce through space to see into the very essence of things.

Fated Fortune Heavenly Pupil!

Yang Kai was stunned and quickly used his Divine Sense to isolate himself and conceal his presence as he stood there awkwardly, scratching his nose.

If Qin Yu, who was only a Second-Order Dao Source Realm, really found out that he was spying on her, he would have no face left at all.

But Qin Yu’s changes still shocked Yang Kai. Not to mention her cultivation shooting up, that Fated Fortune Heavenly Pupil also seemed to have become far stronger and more profound. He was an Emperor Realm Master with extremely strong Soul cultivation, but he was still discovered by Qin Yu when he secretly probed the residence. If Qin Yu were to fully mature, one could imagine how powerful she could become.

Divine Sense shifting away, Yang Kai continued looking around other places in the Qin Family.

Inside the secret room, Qin Yu frowned a little, a suspicious look on her face.

She clearly felt a spying gaze just now, but when she chased after it, it suddenly disappeared. There were two possibilities in this situation. Either it was just a misconception, or the cultivation of the person probing around was far higher than her own.

Qin Yu figured that it was the latter. Masters often come and go from Maplewood City, and it was normal for them to inadvertently sweep across this place with their senses. The main point was that Qin Yu didn’t feel any malice from that probe, and since that was the case, there was no problem.

“Sir Luo, this Qin really can’t help it. Please, could you please be lenient for another few days?”

When Yang Kai’s Divine Sense swept over a certain room, he suddenly found Qin Zhao Yang’s trail, but at this moment, the latter had a bitter look on his face and was pleading about something to a luxuriously-dressed man.

Next to him, two maidservants stood there, pale-faced and trembling.

“Can’t help it?” The young man surnamed Luo sneered at Qin Zhao Yang, “Even if you can’t, find a way to get it done! It doesn’t matter if you have to steal or rob to get it done! I don’t need to teach you something as simple as that, do I?”

Qin Yao Zhang’s face changed, and he exclaimed, “How could I possibly do such a thing!”

“You can’t?” The man surnamed Luo grunted before suddenly pointing at the two maidservants to the side and shouting, “Open your dog eyes wide and take a look at these two harlots you sent over today! You think these lowly whores are worthy of serving this Young Lord?”

The two maidservants with low cultivation paled instantly when they were pointed at by this man and kneeled down instantly, bodies trembling all over, seemingly very afraid of him.

Qin Yao Zhang had a bitter face. For a man as old as him to have spittle sprayed over his face by someone who could be his grandson made him furious, and yet he could not vent that anger. In fact, the two maidservants he brought over were by no means bad in appearance. They looked quite delicate actually, but the requirements of this young man surnamed Luo were simply too high and he would accept nothing short of excellent. What’s more, he demanded a different woman each day.

All the prettier maidservants of the Qin Family had already been ravished by him, and Qin Zhao Yang had also brought a number of outside maidservants into the Qin Family, but he still could not meet the needs of this youth.

“It seems like your Qin Family doesn’t need to be sheltered by this Young Lord anymore. Fine, this Young Lord also can’t be bothered, but I’m sure Patriarch Qin knows what the end of the Du Family was better than I,” saying that, the young man surnamed Luo began to walk out.

Qin Zhao Yang’s face changed and he hurried to stop him, “Sir Luo, please wait!”

The young man coldly snorted, “What else do you have to say?”

Qin Zhao Yang said with a look of difficulty, “Please, Sir Luo. Give me two days… No, one day! This Qin will definitely think of a way to satisfy Sir Luo!”

Upon hearing this, the young man surnamed Luo sighed, “Patriarch Qin, it has not been a short time since this Young Lord came to your Qin Family, and since this Young Lord took up residence here, what sort of people dared to find trouble with you or your family?”

“Not a one!” Qin Zhao Yang quickly answered. This young man was not easy to serve, and his lust was simply bottomless. He would not be pleased without a woman every day. Even though the Qin Family was not one of those big families, they still had the ability to find some beautiful maidservants, but the main issue was the fact that this guy changed women too quickly. They could send over two beautiful maidservants, but he would ask for new ones in just a few days. Just like a breeding horse, this young man seemed to only live for enjoying himself.

But what he said was undoubtedly true. No one had come to find trouble with the Qin Family since he arrived. On the other hand, the Du Family offended a Master some days ago, and they were completely uprooted. A family of over a hundred people were exterminated overnight, from their Patriarch right down to their servants.

The rules in Maplewood City were not as strict as Spirit Lake City, and even though there existed a City Lord’s Mansion to maintain order, how could a few weaklings deter the gathered masses? Many Masters had no regard for the City Lord’s Mansion and acted however they pleased in the dark despite seemingly obeying the law on the surface.

And it was for that reason that the large families in Maplewood City had all invited someone with strength and status to protect the peace of their family. But of course, the price they had to pay wouldn’t be small. What the Qin Family had to pay was still on the light side. All they had to do was send a few beautiful maidservants to take care of the young man surnamed Luo every few days. On the other hand, some families had to surrender seventy percent of their annual earnings to their protectors, which was simply a nightmare.

“ Patriarch Qin is also an understanding man,” the young man surnamed Luo smiled and patted Qin Zhao Yang’s shoulder. “This Young Lord has a proposal, I wonder if the Qin Family Patriarch is willing to accept it.”

Qin Zhao Yang’s heart jumped as he couldn’t help but have a bad feeling in his gut hearing this; however, he could only grit his teeth and say, “This Qin is willing to listen.”

The cultivator surnamed Luo grinned meaningfully and whispered, “Doesn’t Patriarch Qin have an outstanding granddaughter? As long as…”

“Absolutely not!” Qin Zhao Yang was shocked and quickly refused. The extreme lust of this cultivator surnamed Luo was precisely the reason why he had Qin Yu enter retreat in that secret room, telling her not to come out for any reason. He didn’t expect that this incarnation of lust would still have his eyes on her even after that.

Ever since Yang Kai returned from the Four Seasons Realm and brought back the Tribulation Fruit, resolving the danger of Qin Yu’s World Tribulation Body, Qin Yu had shown extraordinary aptitude for cultivation. In just a few short years, she had already reached the Second-Order Dao Source Realm, and in time, there may even be the possibility of her ascending to the Emperor Realm.

The Qin Family’s future rested on Qin Yu’s shoulders. Not to mention his most precious granddaughter, Qin Zhao Yang couldn’t use any of his descendants as a bargaining chip.

As for the maidservants he bought in order to serve that cultivator surnamed Luo, Qin Zhao Yang explained the situation to them and only took them back to the Qin Family after they themselves agreed.

Qin Yu would never agree to such a thing, and Qin Zhao Yang would never consider it either.

“Why not?” The young man’s face turned dark as if his majesty was being challenged.

“This won’t do. Anything but this…” Qin Zhao Yang waved his hands repeatedly.

His staunch refusal angered the young man instantly and he shouted, “You say no, but this Young Lord doesn’t see any problem with it! Rest assured, as long as your granddaughter can commit her body to this Young Lord, anything is negotiable with the Qin Family! I will go and look for her now, you need not get involved!”

While speaking, he began to walk out as if he had long known where Qin Yu was.

Qin Zhao Yang was shocked and appalled. He wanted to stop that cultivator surnamed Luo, but he ended up grabbing empty air as the latter slipped away like a loach.

When the cultivator surnamed Luo opened the door to leave though, he was stunned to find someone blocking his path.

“Make way!” The young man surnamed Luo was in a hurry to look for Qin Yu, so how could he still have any mind to stay here? As such, without hesitation, he thrust his palm out.

The man blocking his path, however, didn’t even try to dodge, instead lifting his hand lightly and poking out with the tip of his finger towards the cultivator surnamed Luo’s palm.

A piercing pain suddenly filled the young man surnamed Luo’s body, and as if he had been struck by lightning, he shivered and leapt back, finally looking up in shock and horror and shouting, “Who?!”

Qin Zhao Yang was also stunned at the sudden situation, and it wasn’t until the smell of blood reached the tip of his nose that he came back to his senses. Looking up, he was dumbfounded as he called out, “Little Brother Yang!”
