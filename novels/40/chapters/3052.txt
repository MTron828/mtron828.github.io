However, what awaited Zhu Qing was the tempest she had never expected. Not long after her cultivation had been sealed and her Dragon Vein suppressed, she was engaged to Fu Chi, and her wedding was scheduled to be next month. Everything happened too suddenly.

She would rather perish in the Dragon Grave on her own than marry another Dragon Clan member. There were only a small number of Dragons, so she knew what Fu Chi was like. In the past, he already had his eye on her and repeatedly asked the Elders to get her engaged to him. He even harassed her from time to time.

Zhu Qing had always ignored him, but she didn’t expect that he would succeed in getting her one day. She had already made up her mind. If there came a time when she was left with no choice, she would fight with them even if she had to lose her life.

Just then, footsteps could be heard approaching her. Zhu Qing raised her gaze and saw a beautiful woman in a white imperial dress.

The woman looked like she was in her late twenties. Her figure was curvy, and her face was strikingly beautiful. Her silver hair, which looked like snow-white silk, was tied into a bun. However, there seemed to be a layer of eternally frozen ice on her alluring face. By just looking at her face, one would feel cold and terrified in their heart.

“Second Elder.” Although Zhu Qing hated her for her despotic behaviour, she still had to be polite to her.

Fu Zhun asked impassively, “Have you changed your mind?

With a calm expression, Zhu Qing replied, “You already know my decision, so what’s the point of you asking this question?”

Fu Zhun uttered, “That’s fine. The wedding will be held in a few days regardless. You have plenty of time to think about it. After you change your mind, the Great Elder and I will set you free.”

With a frown, Zhu Qing asked, “Forcefully squeezed melons are not sweet. Why insist on forcing me when you know I am unwilling?”

Fu Zhun replied, “Sustaining the bloodline is the most important thing for the Dragon Clan, so your opinion doesn’t really matter. Moreover, how could you even consider being with a Human? You’re a disgrace to the Dragon Clan!”

Zhu Qing refuted, “That is my personal choice, what does it have to do with the Dragon Clan?”

Fu Zhun’s expression turned even colder, “Since the blood that flows in your veins belongs to the Dragon Clan, every decision you make affects our reputation. That’s why I won’t allow you to be reckless.”

Zhu Qing cried, “In your eyes, is there nothing more important than sustaining the bloodline for the Dragon Clan?”

Fu Zhun flung her sleeve, “There are only a small number of Dragon Clan members, and the ratio of men to women is imbalanced. If everyone is as disobedient as you are, our clan will go extinct one day. As a Dragon Clan member, you have to think about our future.”

Zhu Qing laughed in self-mockery, “I didn’t expect that the responsibility of sustaining the Dragon Clan’s bloodline lay on my shoulders. I’m flattered.”

“I know you’re resentful of me, but that doesn’t matter. I don’t mind being cursed by you as long as you can give birth to a Dragon baby.” Fu Zhun stared at her, “Don’t even think about doing anything silly. Before Fu Chi and your child is born, I won’t let you have any chance to kill yourself. I will speak no further. Think about it. Rather than spending the rest of your life in misery, you should quickly change your mind.”

Upon finishing her words, Fu Zhun turned around to leave.

Zhu Qing’s body trembled as she said through gritted teeth, “Second Elder, don’t you regret what you did ten years ago? She’s still suffering in the Dragon Grave. It’s not too late to release her now. However, it’ll be too late for you to regret it after she passes away.”

The Second Elder stopped in her tracks and replied without turning around, “No one can leave the Dragon Grave after they enter it. She only has herself to blame.”

After the Second Elder was out of sight, Zhu Qing put on a bitter smile. It was then she realized the Second Elder was truly stone-hearted, as she wasn’t affected one bit at the mention of the incident more than ten years ago. Now, Zhu Qing understood that she could never persuade the Second Elder.

A few metres away, a burly man came over with a fawning smile. After cupping his hands together, he greeted, “Greetings, Second Elder.”

Fu Zhun stared at him with a frown, “Why are you here?”

Cautiously, Fu Chi replied, “I’m here to visit Qing’er. You’ve just met her. What did she say?”

Fu Zhun uttered, “Regardless of what she’s said, she’ll be yours in a few more days.”

With a grin, Fu Chi asked, “You’re right, Second Elder. Can I go in to see her? She might change her mind if I could just talk to her.”

“She’s in a bad mood now, so things will only get worse if you meet her now.” Fu Zhun moved past him and went on to speak, “Rather than trying to persuade her, you should get prepared yourself.”

“Understood.” Fu Chi replied respectfully.

He didn’t dare to insist on his request after he was rejected by the Second Elder. He just wanted to visit Zhu Qing on this day and find out whether her attitude had changed. After hearing what the Second Elder said, he knew that Zhu Qing remained the same.

Upon that realization, he was exasperated. [I’m a Dragon, a genuine Eighth-Order Thunder Dragon, I’m superior to any Human in every way; however, not only has Zhu Qing rejected the Elders’ demand for her to get married to me, but she’s still longing for that Human! His name was Yang Kai, right?]

Fu Chi remembered Yang Kai’s name and was ready to find fault with him when the time was right. He hated the fact that Yang Kai had taken Zhu Qing’s innocence away. Unlike Fu Ling, Zhu Qing had a stainless reputation on Dragon Island, which was why he coveted her so. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He had pursued her before, but he had never managed to gain her favour. Unexpectedly, she left the island some time ago and got together with a Human. That fact made Fu Chi resentful.

However, it didn’t matter anymore, as the wedding would be held in a few more days. By then, Zhu Qing would become his woman. Furthermore, the Second Elder had announced that she wouldn’t release Zhu Qing’s seal before Zhu Qing gave birth to a child.

Although Zhu Qing was now a Ninth-Order Dragon, Fu Chi didn’t need to fear her with her strength sealed. After the wedding, he could do whatever he wanted to her. Even though he had many playthings on this island, they were not comparable to Zhu Qing.

Hence, he looked forward to the wedding. After dawdling on the ice island for a while, he flew back to his Spirit Island. To ensure that his wedding would be held on time, he had to make sure that the palace would be built before the deadline.

…..

Inside the Small Sealed World, Yang Kai opened his eyes, upon which a glint flashed across his gaze as his Dragon Pressure permeated.

He had consumed more than a hundred Dragon Blood Pills and even consumed all the remaining Mid-Rank Dragon Blood Flowers. Now, only Low-Rank Dragon Blood Flowers were left in his Space Ring.

After he did some calculations, he realized that the time had come. Then, he stopped circulating his Dragon Transformation Secret Art and turned back into his Human form. Upon checking the Small Sealed World with his Divine Sense, he located Li Jiao and Lu San Niang.

Both of them seemed to have dissolved their old grudges as they were now chatting with each other. Appearing to be timid, Lu Yu Qin was hiding somewhere and watching them from afar.

Li Jiao and Lu San Niang were shocked when Yang Kai appeared all of a sudden, and their expressions instantly turned awkward. After all, they were caught flirting with one another, which was quite embarrassing for them. At that moment, Lu San Niang was blushing.

Trying to shift the focus, Li Jiao asked, “Brother Yang, where is this?”

He, Lu San Niang, and her daughter had been staying here for some time, and upon realizing that this was a Small World, Li Jiao was astounded.

It was then he understood how he could escape the Demon Qi’s invasion when he was in the Revolving World. At that time, Yang Kai had repeatedly knocked him out, and every time he did that, it was when the World Principles changed.

Now, Li Jiao understood he must have been thrown into this Small World by Yang Kai at that time, which was why he could evade the Demon Qi’s invasion. Apparently, Yang Kai didn’t trust him enough in the past, which was why he kept knocking him out. Now, however, he must have gained Yang Kai’s confidence.

Without answering his question, Yang Kai spoke, “I have to teach Fu Chi a lesson.”

Li Jiao was startled for a moment before he said through gritted teeth, “I’ll assist you in any way I can.”

Previously, he didn’t know who Fu Chi was; however, through his contact with Lu San Niang recently, he had learned that Fu Chi was the culprit who had harmed her in the past, so Li Jiao now hated him greatly. Now that Yang Kai mentioned it, Li Jiao couldn’t hold back his anger anymore. He needed to get his revenge because Fu Chi had snatched his wife from him.

Fu Chi was an Eighth-Order Thunder Dragon, so Li Jiao was indeed no match for him. He would be rendered powerless if Fu Chi used bloodline suppression on him. Nevertheless, with Yang Kai’s help, things would be different. He didn’t expect to defeat Fu Chi. He just hoped that he could at least bite off a piece of Fu Chi’s flesh to vent his anger.

Lu San Niang’s expression changed drastically when she heard that, so she shouted, “No!”

With a gentle expression, Li Jiao looked at her and put on a smile, “Wait for me. I’ll take revenge for you.”

“You can’t go!” The colour drained from Lu San Niang’s alluring face as she grabbed Li Jiao’s arm. She was determined not to let him go.

Li Jiao didn’t have the heart to make a move on her, so he turned to look at Yang Kai. Understanding his hint, Yang Kai stretched out his hand and landed a finger on Lu San Niang, upon which she turned limp and collapsed to the ground.

“Mother!” Lu Yu Qin yelled as she ran over and supported Lu San Niang’s weight.

“Don’t worry. She’s fine.” Li Jiao patted her head and spoke after a sigh, “Take care of your mother. It’ll be all good if I can come back, but if I can’t…” He paused for a long time, “Tell your mother to bring you back to Dream Gate.”

“Uncle Li…” Realizing something, Lu Yu Qin gazed at Li Jiao with bloodshot eyes.

Although she didn’t know what his relationship with her mother was, she had been observing their interaction for the past few days. She had never seen her mother so happy before, so she knew that Li Jiao must be an important person in her mother’s heart. Hence, she was on the brink of tearing up when she had to part with him.

With a faint smile, Li Jiao uttered, “If we meet again, next time, you must call me father.”

In his current situation, considering what he was about to attempt, Li Jiao wasn’t even certain he would live to see tomorrow’s sunrise, allowing him to finally at this moment untie the knot in his heart and completely feel relieved. Instantly, he felt more energetic as all his troubles seemed to melt away.

In the blink of an eye, Li Jiao and Yang Kai disappeared from sight, leaving Lu Yu Qin rooted to the spot with only one thought in her mind, [I have a father now?]

Dazed, she sat on the ground with her mother in her embrace. A long time later, she became torn between tears and laughter, “Mom, I have a father now. Wake up. I have a father now!”

Anyone would have laughed at her if they heard that, for all people in this world had a father of some kind; however, having a father had been this little girl’s greatest wish for more than ten years.
