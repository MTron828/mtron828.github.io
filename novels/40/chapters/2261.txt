Aware of the bad intentions of the other party, Ning Yuan Shu was shocked and the light under his feet flashed as his figure receded rapidly.

But where could he go?

Before Ning Yuan Shu could move, Yang Kai had already stretched out his hand, grabbed his collar, and sent slap after slap across his handsome, sinister face.

*Pa... pa...*

After the crisp sound, Ning Yuan Shu was completely beaten up.

When Yang Kai ceased his action, both of Ning Yuan Shu’s cheeks were already swollen, giving him the look of a pig’s head that had been soaked in boiling water for several days.

The surrounding cultivators all went silent, avoiding eye contact with each other as they wore horrified expressions.

Previously, Yang Kai had acted out at the Qin Family and killed the Vice Valley Master of Evil Moon Valley and injured another unnamed middle-aged man. Neither Qu Huai Ren nor the middle-aged man were born into big Sects though, and none had an Emperor Realm Master standing behind them, so as long as Yang Kai was strong enough, there was no need for him to worry about being retaliated against.

However, Ning Yuan Shu was different. He was the Young Palace Master of Flying Saint Palace.

Flying Saint Palace was ranked quite highly amongst the second-class Sects and Ning Yuan Shu’s father, Ning Bo Yang, was a First-Order Emperor Realm Master. There were also many masters in Flying Saint Palace, including Protectors Gao Shan and Liu Shui.

How could Flying Saint Palace let it slide when their Young Palace Master was beaten to a pulp?

Everyone looked at Yang Kai with not only a strong sense of fear, but also taking pleasure in his misfortune, thinking that a man as bold and boundless as him was destined to get into trouble.

“You... you dare hit me?” Ning Yuan Shu, who was still held by Yang Kai, his cheek so swollen the pain was numbing, ogled at Yang Kai and muttered in disbelief.

Yang Kai sneered, “Dare? I’ve already hit you.”

“This Young Master is... “

“I know. The Young Palace Master of Flying Saint Palace!” Yang Kai cut him off and continued slapping him. He smiled at Qin Zhao Yang, “This boy is quite interesting. He doesn’t forget about his home even after being beaten silly. It’s as if he doesn’t have any identity without his background.”

While speaking, he lifted Ning Yuan Shu high and shouted “Come one, come all, everyone have a look, this is the famous Flying Saint Palace Young Palace Master Ning Yuan Shu. Remember his face well.”

The cultivators around thought, [Everyone saw you beating him to a pulp, how could we not remember?]

Ning Yuan Shu roared as his blood seemed to flow backwards from his rage, resulting in him coughing up large mouthfuls of it.

He had an extraordinary background and was spoiled and doted on since he was a child, never suffering the slightest insult. But today, he had been slapped across the face repeatedly by Yang Kai in front of a massive crowd. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Although he spat blood, he did not faint, which at least proved his will wasn’t weak.

Qin Zhao Yang smiled bitterly and did not know what to say to Yang Kai, but secretly sighing, he felt that young people today were indeed high spirited and uninhibited. It almost reminded him of his own youth.

*Xiu... *

Two beams of lights suddenly flew over from up ahead. These two newcomers were giving off slightly unsteady auras, as if they were escaping from a battle.

“Ah... Young Palace Master!” The lights stopped a short distance away from Yang Kai and the others, revealing Protectors Gao Shan and Liu Shui.

The two Elders of Flying Saint Palace looked quite embarrassed at the moment, their white hair and beards frazzled, their clothes torn. Gao Shan held a Guqin-like artifact in his arms, but the light coming from it was quite dim. It seemed the spirituality of his artifact had taken damage. The same was true for Liu Shui’s flute on his waist.

The two of them could not fathom what happened as they came from the opposite direction and were shocked to see the state of Ning Yuan Shu.

“Left and Right Protectors...” When Ning Yuan Shu saw Gao Shan and Liu Shui, his eyes flashed with madness as he ground his teeth and shouted, “Quickly avenge this Young Master! Kill this bastard!”

“You did this?” Gao Shan stared at Yang Kai coldly.

Liu Shui’s face was gloomy as lifted up his flute and without saying a word poured his Source Qi into it.

Yang Kai turned a deaf ear to these two old men and instead looked at their backs with his squinted eyes, a moment later his expression turning into a solemn frown.

“Release the Young Master!” Seeing Yang Kai ignoring them, Gao Shan shouted in furious anger. At the same time, Liu Shui flickered and appeared suddenly beside Yang Kai, his flute artifact in hand.

“Brother Yang, be careful!” Qin Zhao Yang was shocked.

With his cultivation and eyesight, he could not see exactly how Liu Shui approached Yang Kai, and it was far too late to warn him about it.

Yang Kai laughed and ignored Liu Shui’s attack, however, simply moving Ning Yuan Shu in his hand in the direction of the incoming strike, completely using the Young Palace Master as a shield.

Liu Shui furrowed his brow and withdrew his attack before swiftly returning to Gao Shan’s side.

Gao Shan wore a gloomy look as he slowly strummed the Guqin in his arms with one hand. A clear and uplifting melody instantly spread out, forcing the nearby cultivators to circulate their Source Qi to protect themselves from the sound waves.

“Boy! What has Flying Saint Palace done to you to provoke such a vicious assault against the Young Palace Master?” Gao Shan asked while strumming his Guqin.

“That’s what I’d like to know,” Yang Kai held Ning Yuan Shu in front of him, only poking half his head out from behind him as he snickered. “You’ll have to ask your Young Palace Master about this. He just suddenly attacked me, so I just fought back.”

Ning Yuan Shu’s eyes were filled with hatred as he wanted to resist, but found himself completely suppressed, unable to even circulate his Source Qi. Gritting his teeth, he shouted, “Left and Right Protectors, this person is that brat surnamed Yang who might have killed my Eldest Brother. We must capture him and bring him back to the Sect for interrogation!”

“Huh? He’s the boy surnamed Yang?” Gao Shan and Liu Shui were shocked when they heard this, suddenly recalling they had not asked his name when they saw Yang Kai in the Qin Family earlier.

“I killed your Elder Brother?” Yang Kai asked, his mind turning quickly and quickly realizing Ning Yuan Shu why attacked him, “Believe it or not, the death of your brother has nothing to do with me!”

Although he destroyed Ning Yuan Cheng’s body, the true culprit behind his death was the Wood Spirit. The Wood Spirit Seed had exploded in Ning Yuan Cheng’s body, causing him to completely lose his vitality. What Yang Kai killed was nothing more than a shell for the Wood Spirit Soul Clone.

So, Ning Yuan Cheng’s death really had nothing to do with him.

“This is not something you can settle with a single statement! If you are smart enough, you will follow us back to the Sect and obediently submit to Sir Palace Master’s judgement!” Gao Shan shouted.

Yang Kai sneered, “And I should follow you just because you said so? How disgraceful would that be? And... is it really okay for you two to stand here leisurely? The one pursuing you is about to arrive!”

Many people were confused by his words.

Gao Shan and Liu Shui’s faces, however, changed drastically as they turned to look back quickly.

*Weng... *

There was a sudden tremor in space as a powerful coercion arrived from the horizon, sweeping across the crowd, anchoring all the cultivators present in place, as if a giant mountain had been dropped on their shoulders.

The rubble and soil on the ground slowly rose up amongst the inexplicable pressure, the scene simply unimaginable.

“What is this...”

“Could it be that an Emperor has come?”

“Ah, this is bad, we’re going to die...”

Ning Yuan Shu was wounded, and he was bleeding terribly, his white clothes now dyed red by his own blood, making for a shocking scene.

“This is...” the round-faced woman, together with the other disciples from Eight Paths Sect who had followed after Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang, stared off into the distance, their faces warping in fear.

At the edge of the sky, a figure appeared.

He was wrapped in an indescribable energy and a powerful, violent aura rumbled around him, causing all present to shudder.

The world collapsed and turned upside down wherever this person passed.

This newcomer’s aura was so intense that it was in no way inferior to an Emperor Realm Master’s. Amidst the chaotic energy, only a pair of bright eyes shone through with cold excitement, making those who were gazed upon feel as if they had been thrown into a winter blizzard.

This person, surprisingly, was Luo Yuan from Eight Paths Sect!

It was unknown what had happened between Gao Shan, Liu Shui, and Luo Yuan when the three of them flew out of the city to fight, but now Luo Yuan was chasing after Gao Shan and Liu Shui like they were stray dogs.

“Tsk tsk, this aura!” Yang Kai made a sound with a look of admiration, “It is rare to not lose one’s consciousness after releasing such power. Whatever Secret Technique he was cultivating is impressive. I wonder if he succeeded in mastering it now.”

Previously, Luo Yuan said that he was trying to comprehend some kind of Secret Technique, but had run into a bottleneck. As such, he wanted to fight with Yang Kai, but Yang Kai had instead pushed this trouble onto Gao Shan and Liu Shui. At this stage, Luo Yuan should not be far from successfully comprehending this new Secret Technique. Even Yang Kai had never seen a profound technique that could allow one’s aura to rise to the level of an Emperor despite still being a Dao Source Realm cultivator.

Luo Yuan was still far away, but in the blink of an eye, he arrived. No one was able to see how he moved.

“Not good!” Gao Shan and Liu Shui must have suffered a big loss at Luo Yuan’s hands, otherwise, they would not have fled in embarrassment. At this moment, they were so afraid that they would, obviously, not wait quietly for this madman to show up in front of them.

The two exchanged a knowing glance before one raised his flute to his lips and the other plucked his Guqin, sending out shocking music from their instruments.

The Souls of many cultivators present were sent into a daze.

Gao Shan and Liu Shui flanked Yang Kai on the left and right in an instant.

Liu Shui raised his flute horizontally and directed it to Yang Kai’s head before blowing into it. Gao Shan strummed his Guqin sharply at the same time with all five of his fingers, unleashing an invisible slash towards Yang Kai.

“Hahaha!” Yang Kai laughed sarcastically, “Since you want this back so badly, I’ll return it to you!”

As he spoke, his hand shook slightly and he threw Ning Yuan Shu, who was still in his grasp, towards the Guqin’s slash.

“How is that possible?!”

“Not good!”

Gao Shan and Liu Shui exclaimed in shock, their faces palling abruptly.
