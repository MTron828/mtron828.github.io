The vicinity of the Blood Gate was like a raging fire, filled with loud explosions and flashes of light. Naturally, all this commotion had drawn the attention of the Monster Kings in the outer region, and curious, all of them ran over to check the situation.

In a short while, more than a dozen Monster Kings had gathered about five kilometres away from the Blood Gate, and all of them were quite shocked after seeing the enemies of the Eight Great Kings.

“The Stone Spirit Clan? Why are they here?”

“How is that possible? We have been defending the perimeter the whole time, it’s impossible for them to appear here out of thin air!”

“Did they come from underground?”

“What do they want to do? Do they want to break into the Blood Gate!?”

…..

The Monster Kings broke into a lively discussion, but soon, their faces changed. Although they had always been thinking of breaking into the Blood Gate, they really didn’t dare to act upon this impulse, yet at this moment, seeing the Stone Spirit Clan appear out of thin air and stand against the eight Great Kings, admiration and fury rose in their hearts.

They admired their courage, their lack of fear about angering the Divine Venerables afterwards, and were angry at these guys for being so foolish. These Monster Kings would also be inevitably punished because of the Stone Clan’s actions.

At this point, many Monster Kings looked at each other, wanting to rush and help out.

The entire Ancient Lands residents recognized the fact that the Stone Spirit Clan were extremely difficult to deal with. Although the eight Great Kings were strong, they may not be able to take on the entire Stone Spirit Clan alone. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Only if they worked together could they reign in the insolent Stone Spirit Clan.

“Great Kings, we have come to aid you,” a Monster King loudly shouted as he shot straight towards the battlefield with surging Monster Qi.

The pupils of the burly Great King, who was fighting Shi Yi, immediately contracted before he refused in a heavy voice, “No!”

The rushing Monster Kings abruptly halted with a confused look on his face. In the Ancient Lands, although the thirty-two Monster Kings and eight Great Kings were almost on par with each other, when it came to status, the Great Kings were obviously higher. Being the confidants of the four Divine Venerables, following them left and right, they could be regarded as the heralds of the Divine Venerables.

Under normal circumstances, their words were equivalent to the Divine Venerables’ words.

So as soon as the burly Great King spoke, no Monster King dared to disobey his order. However, they were all filled with doubt, wondering what the Great King meant.

“Continue to guard the periphery. Prevent anyone from coming to their aid. If anyone dares to rush over, kill them without mercy!” While guarding against Shi Yi’s earth-shattering-like attack, the burly Great King shouted.

“Yes!” The Monster Kings acknowledged the order, one after another, but the expressions on their faces were extremely strange.

Under normal circumstances, everyone should work together to deal with the Stone Spirit Clan as soon as possible; after all, the Blood Gate was very important and there was no room for any negligence. But now, the Great King was asking them to continue to guard the periphery, preventing them from intervening in the fight.

The eight Great Kings certainly couldn’t handle the Stone Spirit Clan alone.

The Monster Kings glanced at each other as doubts arose in their hearts, unable to understand whether this was the Great Kings’ own intention or the Divine Venerables’ orders.

If it was the Divine Venerables’ orders, it was quite possible as well; after all, the Divine Venerables had been wanting to subdue the Stone Spirit Clan for themselves. Unfortunately, each of these Stone Spirits was as dull and inflexible as a rock. The Divine Venerables had tried many times to convince them, but to no avail. This time might be an opportunity. It was just that, no matter how much the Great Kings wanted to subdue the Stone Spirit Clan, they would never take the matter of Blood Gate lightly.

“Huh!? There is also a Human over there. What’s he doing?” Suddenly, a Monster King noticed something and stared in Yang Kai’s direction.

Hearing this, the other Monster Kings focused their gaze in that direction as well, and what they saw next caused their faces to drastically change.

“That Human is cracking the Blood Gate seal!”

“What!? That’s absurd! What are the eight Sirs thinking? Why are they calmly watching that Human break the seal? Why aren’t they stopping him? If the Divine Venerables came to know about this, it’s going to be really horrible!”

“Oh, no! While the eight Sirs are stopped by the eight Stone Spirits, that Human is really acting outrageously!”

“What should we do?”

“What are you all fretting about? Maybe…the eight Sirs are deliberately allowing it?” A seemingly shrewd Monster King’s eyes suddenly flashed with an intelligent gleam.

Another Monster King turned his head and indifferently criticized, glancing at him, “Hu Li, you can eat anything you want, but you can’t say anything you think!”

The Monster King called Hu Li chuckled and stated, “This King just made a casual remark, that’s all, you brothers are free to ignore it.”

But some words can’t be ignored after they have been heard. The burly Great King stopped them from approaching the battlefield, and even asked them to continue to guard the perimeter. This made these Monster Kings suspicious, and after listening to Hu Li, their hearts were crazily shaken; they faintly felt that this was probably the truth of the matter.

All of a sudden, everyone Monster King felt their scalp tingle as a chill ran down their spine.

[The Eight Great Kings…are they planning to go against the Divine Venerables? If that’s the case, the entire Ancient Lands will probably descend into chaos!]

Thinking so, when they looked at the fiery battle again, many Monster Kings discovered that something wasn’t right. The battle might seem fierce at first glance, with the eight Great Kings and the Stone Spirit Clansmen trying their best to tear each other into pieces, attacking without holding anything back…

But when their attacks actually landed on their targets, no one received any injuries, not even a minor one.

This situation was obviously strange.

Hu Li narrowed his eyes again and asked in surprise, gazing in a certain direction, “Where did the four Divine Venerables go? Why is there no sign of them?”

He couldn’t sense the four mighty presences where they should have been.

Immediately a Monster King added, “I heard that the four Divine Venerables had left in a hurry after receiving a certain piece of news. I don’t know where they went.”

“Received a certain piece of news?” A surprised look flashed across Hu Li’s eyes, “What piece of news is more important than the Blood Gate that the four Divine Venerables left in a hurry?”

“I’m not clear about it either,” that Monster King shook his head.

“Interesting! Lure the tiger from the mountain and enter the tiger’s den taking advantage of its absence, burning one’s boat… I never knew the Stone Spirit Clan had such intelligence!” Hu Li softly smiled.

Although his voice wasn’t loud, the other Monster Kings heard him loud and clear. At this moment, how could the Monster Kings fail to notice that something underhanded was going on around the Blood Gate?

Suddenly, everyone’s mood became complicated. They were both anxious and worried.

Anxious because the Human had been cracking the seal for a long time, but there had been no result at all; it was simply a waste.

Worried because… if the four Divine Venerables returned, the battle at the Blood Gate would immediately end. Of course, the Stone Spirit Clan was pretty strong, but before the four Divine Venerables, they still weren’t strong enough. And once the battle was over, the Blood Gate’s seal couldn’t be cracked.

“What should we do now?” The Monster King, who had spoken before, approached Hu Li and asked in a low voice.

Other Monster Kings focused their gazes on Hu Li, one after another; they seemed to be ready to follow his lead.

Why wouldn’t they? Hu Li was the one gifted with the sharpest mind among all the Monster Kings. No matter how complicated the situation was, or what convoluted conspiracy was taking place, he could easily see through it.

This was also why he could be one of the thirty-two Monster Kings despite only being a Mid-Twelfth-Order Monster Race.

In the entire Ancient Wild Lands, only Hu Li wasn’t a peak Twelfth-Order Monster Race. In a one-on-one fight, other Monster Kings would not put him in their eyes, but when it came to schemes and trickery, the other thirty-one Monster Kings were not even in the same class as him.

At this delicate moment, all the Monster Kings naturally hoped that he could come up with something.

Hu Li smiled upon hearing this before he replied in a calm and composed manner, “Everyone is asking me what we should do, but who should I ask?”

A certain Monster King let out a cold snort and rebuked, “A straightforward person does not resort to insinuations. Hu Li, we are brothers who have shared life and death in the Ancient Lands for so many years. If you have something in mind, just lay it out in the open, no need to hide it.”

“Yes, Hu Li, now is not the time to play tricks.”

The group of Monster Kings stared fixedly at him, indicating that they wouldn’t let him go until he spoke.

Hu Li spread his hands and replied with a wry smile, “You really shouldn’t be asking me about this, it’s meaningless!”

As soon as he said this, the other Monster Kings looked unhappy and secretly felt that this sly guy wasn’t playing by the rules, making them somewhat angry.

Hu Li smiled again and added, “Didn’t Sir just order us to guard the perimeter and prevent anyone from approaching? We should just follow that order!”

His words seemed to imply something as the Monster Kings’ eyes lit up after hearing this.

One of the Monster Kings clenched his fist and palmed it hard, creating a loud thump as he declared, “Indeed, we only need to do what we are ordered. If the sky falls, there will naturally be someone above to hold it.”

“Yes, yes!”

After everything was clarified, all the Monster Kings finally relaxed. They stood in their spots, watching the fierce and extraordinary battle. From time to time, they would point and comment about the fight; all while feeling completely at ease and leisurely.

As Hu Li had just said, all of them were just following orders and guarding the periphery. Even if the Divine Venerables blamed them afterwards, they had their excuses ready. Only the eight Great Kings would be punished, it had nothing to do with them.

But if the Human broke the seal before the Divine Venerables returned…

At that time, all the Monster Kings and the Great Kings would definitely rush into the Blood Gate the first chance they got. No one would care about the Divine Venerables objections.

“The Stone Spirit Clan has made such big plans, so they must be quite confident in succeeding, yes?” Hu Li, standing among the Monster Kings, furrowed his brow as he stared towards Yang Kai. As far as he knew, ever since the Blood Gate Restricted Area had appeared, no one seemed to have been able to crack it. Generally, it was impossible to even get close to it. If it weren’t for the abnormal changes in the Blood Gate this time, perhaps the area within ten kilometres of it would have been an impassable barrier.

In the dense canopy of a towering big tree some distance away, a small head poked out. It was Zhang Ruo Xi, who was hiding there.

Her eyes widened as she looked ahead, noticing the battle in the vicinity of the Blood Gate and also seeing Yang Kai who was pushing his Emperor Qi madly while constantly moving the local Space Principles.

The situation seemed very dangerous, and from time to time, a fearsome Monster Race’s Secret Technique would brush past Yang Kai.

[Sir is in trouble!]

Ruo Xi felt anxious and her tender body flickered, ready to fly out to help Yang Kai.
