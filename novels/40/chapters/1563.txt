Chapter 1563, Return to Spider Mother’s Den

Xia Ning Chang did not enter the Sealed World Bead; she was now in the First-Order Origin Returning Realm, and would not hinder Yang Kai. As she had just made a breakthrough, there were a lot of things to learn, so Yang Kai allowed her to follow him. It was convenient to teach while they travelled.

What’s more, travelling with a beauty was very pleasing to the eye.

Listening to Yang Kai, she immediately asked, “Who are you looking for?”

“Old Man Li!” Yang Kai looked at her.

Xia Ning Chang suddenly came over, gently nodded, closed her beautiful eyes, and started to search.

Now that she was the Star Master of Tong Xuan Realm, having refined the Star Source, she could travel back and forth anywhere in the mainland with a single thought. On Tong Xuan Realm, she was the master!

It was a simple task for her to find someone.

She communicated with the Star Source of Tong Xuan Realm with her mind and sensed the messages sent by the flowers and trees on the mainland, distinguishing the traces of the person she was looking for. In less than half a day, she opened her beautiful eyes and whispered softly, “Found him!”

Yang Kai was shocked and stepped forward and grabbed Xia Ning Chang’s little hand, “Take me to him.”

Xia Ning Chang gave a gentle nod and aimed the index finger of her jade white hand in front of her. From the void, a dark whirlpool appeared immediately, as if to swallow everything. The two stepped into it and disappeared.

Atop an unnamed barren and desolate mountain, there stood several thatched huts.

No one would have thought that this was where the reclusive Old Man of Heaven’s Keep, Li Rui, who was famous throughout the continent, lived.

Yang Kai held great respect for Old Man Li, not only because he was the longest-lived wise man in the entire continent, having lived for thousands of years under the cultivation of Saint Realm, but also because of how Old Man Li had generously taught Yang Kai.

Old Man Li once came to Nine Heavens Holy Land and helped Yang Kai greatly. At the time when the Bone Race recovered, Old Man Li managed to call on the whole human race to unite with his great reputation.

Upon returning to Nine Heavens Holy Land this time, Yang Kai had not found Old Man Li and his Disciple Di Yao.

Obviously, with Old Man Li and Di Yao’s personalities, it was probably impossible for them to stay in one place for a long time, so they left Nine Heavens Holy Land.

Now that Yang Kai was going to return to the Star Field, of course he wanted to take Old Man Li with him.

“It’s here?” Xia Ning Chang had brought Yang Kai to this barren mountain that was less than a thousand feet high, and Yang Kai could not help but frown.

“En.” Xia Ning Chang nodded gently. “But I didn’t sense Old Man Li’s aura. Only Senior Brother Di’s...”

After hearing what she had said, Yang Kai had a bad feeling. He looked up and saw the simple thatched houses. In front of the thatched houses were a few medicine fields. However, what was planted was not the spirit grasses used for cultivation, but simple ordinary medicinal herbs.

These herbs were effective for treating ordinary people, but they were of no use in cultivation.

There was one person. He was taking care of the herbs in the middle of the Medicine Garden, watering, and fertilizing, repeating the monotonous movements with a meticulous expression.

Yang Kai stepped towards him.

“Here to see a doctor?” The man who was watering heard movement and asked casually without raising his head.

“Brother Di, it’s been a long time!” Yang Kai looked at him with a smile as he greeted him.

Di Yao’s movements paused, as if he realized something. He slowly straightened up and looked at Yang Kai. After seeing Yang Kai’s face clearly, he could not help grinning.

A smile filled with flawless white teeth, coupled with his jade, flowery face that almost made any women jealous. The round sunset behind him poured on him, giving off an afterglow, a sputtering golden halo.

Di Yao took two steps forward and gave Yang Kai a strong hug.

“Brother Yang, when did you come back?” He did not seem surprised at all, as if he knew Yang Kai would return safely.

“It’s been almost two months.”

Di Yao gently nodded, shook off the dirt on his hands, and greeted enthusiastically, “Come on, today we drink to celebrate!”

“Yeah!” Yang Kai responded readily.

In front of the thatched hut, the two sat on the ground. There was no food, only the shining stars in the sky and the oncoming breeze as dishes to go with the drink. Xia Ning Chang sat to the side, holding a jug in her hand, and poured wine for Yang Kai and Di Yao.

The sky was full of stars, and in front of a thatched house, friends had finally gathered after a long parting. It was a happy occasion.

“Master, he passed away more than 20 years ago.” Di Yao suddenly blurted out.

Although he had guessed as much, when Yang Kai heard the news, the hand with which he held the wine glass slightly shook.

Di Yao grinned and said, “His last moments were very peaceful. After all, Master was already so old. It was time.”

With the cultivation of Saint Realm, living for thousands of years was simply not something others could do. Old Man Li had been proficient in pharmacology and used elixirs to regulate his body to live so long.

“Brother Di!” Yang Kai thought for a while but didn’t know what to say.

Di Yao smiled and said, “Master is still here. He continues to live in my heart.”

Yang Kai looked at him, and laughed, relieved.

“Brother Yang, for you to come all this way. Did you have something to ask Master?” Di Yao asked.

“It’s nothing, it’s just that I’m leaving again and wanted Old Man Li and Brother Di to join me.”

“Into the Star Field?” Di Yao narrowed his eyes.

“Yup.” Yang Kai nodded.

Di Yao fell silent for a long time before shaking his head and saying, “The master raised me and taught me, treating me with kindness as great as that of the mountains. I can’t let him be here alone.”

Yang Kai opened his mouth, but before he could persuade him, Di Yao smiled and said, “Brother Yang doesn’t need to say more, I have decided!”

Seeing him so insistent, Yang Kai could only sigh.

They continued to drink, binge, and get drunk!

When dawn came, Di Yao lay on the ground, slumbering. Yang Kai and Xia Ning Chang found a simple tomb at the top of the mountain and worshipped it devoutly. After leaving some cultivation resources for Di Yao, he left silently.

“Are you really going to leave Senior Brother Di there alone?” Xia Ning Chang asked with a little unease.

“It’s his own decision.” Yang Kai responded lightly.

“But...” Xia Ning Chang seemed to want to say something.

“It is not necessarily a bad thing. Once your cultivation enters a higher realm, you will be rejuvenating the mainland. At that stage, it would be inconsequential for Brother Di to leave.”

Xia Ning Chang nodded, indicating that she understood. After thinking about it, she asked, “Where are we going now?”

“There should be a shortcut to Star Field from our original world. We are looking to find someone we both know!” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

After a while, the two came to the site of the Free and Unfettered Spirit Temple, and through the Void Corridor, they entered a place not far from the High Heaven Pavilion.

After the seal set by the Great Demon God was lifted, Tong Xuan Realm and their original world were connected.

This was the starting point of his life.

After arriving, when Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense through, he immediately noticed that there were many more people in the original High Heaven Pavilion, and he did not know which family or Sect occupied it. However, it felt quite prosperous.

Yang Kai chose not to bother them. The cultivators here were as weak as children to him.

He did not go to Central Capital either. The original Central Capital was Eight Great Families. The three families close to him were all in the Sealed World Bead, and the only remaining five families were now thriving there. Yang Kai was too lazy to bother with them.

He took Little Senior Sister and flew directly towards Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land.

Although Little Senior Sister was the Star Master of Tong Xuan Realm, in this world, which had its own World Principles, she could not travel thousands of kilometres in a flash.

Yang Kai did not know how this world was formed, but after witnessing Tong Xuan Realm’s process from birth to prosperity to decline, he vaguely felt that this world should be related to the ancient powerful cultivator.

It might have been created by someone who cultivated to a Heaven defying level. After all, the one who created this place does not necessarily mean that they are the same ones who develop it.

Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land was as chaotic as ever. In the past, several Evil Kings ruled and suppressed it. Although this land had bred filth and evil, there were still some rules to follow.

But since the death and disappearance of the Evil Kings, Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land has become an even more chaotic and evil land.

Everyone understands innately what it means to be a decent person. Nonetheless, they burn, murder and pillage. Anything can happen here, and there was no reason to anything. Only one law existed: the one with the bigger fist makes the law.

The two of them continued to walk without stopping, what they saw and heard was nothing but horrible.

Yang Kai could maintain his indifference, his heart was unmoved by their actions, as though it was still water. However, Little Senior Sister was different. She could not help but teach a lesson to those who only knew to bully the weak.

Fragrance City, originally a city under the jurisdiction of Beguiling Demon Queen Shan Qing Luo, and the last piece of pure land in Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land.

Unfortunately, ever since Shan Qing Luo’s disappearance, this last piece of pure land had also been corrupted, and the city has been dark and chaotic.

When passing by, Yang Kai could not help but miss it.

Back then, he had known the devilish woman of this land, but after Yang Kai returned from Tong Xuan Realm, he could not find her.

He had thought it would be impossible to find Shan Qing Luo ever again.

He would have never thought that he would meet her in the Emperor Garden, learn about her current whereabouts and fight together with her.

Yang Kai felt that he could not forget about this extremely charming devilish woman...

The place he was going to on this trip was Spider Mother’s Den. According to Shan Qing Luo’s maidservant, Bi Luo, she and Shan Qing Luo had been taken to the Monster Emperor Star when they accidentally activated the altar in Spider Mother’s Den.

So, Yang Kai also wanted to use the altar. If he succeeded, not only could he stop by to see how the devilish woman was doing, but also save a lot of time.

He did not want to spend years on Starship; he just wanted to hurry.

Spider Mother’s Den was not too far from Fragrance City, only a few tens of thousands of kilometres. At Yang Kai’s current speed, it would only take half a cup of tea’s time to arrive.

Spider Mother’s Den, was in tatters; after it collapsed that year, no one had cared about this place.

Upon arriving, Yang Kai walked into the huge spider statue with ease and found a strange altar.

The altar was only about the size of a person but had many mysterious and complicated patterns carved on it. Some of these seemed to form a wonderful Spirit Array, and others were like ancient characters.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense but did not notice anything abnormal from it.

On the altar, there were still some dark black stains.

These were, naturally, the blood Shan Qing Luo shed that day!
