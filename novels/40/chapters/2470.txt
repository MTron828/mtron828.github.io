After a long time, Yang Kai breathed out slowly and changed into a clean set of clothing. The corroded wounds on his body healed at a speed visible to the naked eye, and the scabs quickly fell, revealing brand new skin.

*Gudong!* Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The man who had been mocking him just now couldn’t help but gulp in shock.

Yang Kai turned to the man, and with a flicker appeared in front of him.

This person was a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, slightly weaker than the average person in this place, neither high nor low in strength. He had a very quaint appearance, his features suggested he was cunning and ruthless. A person unworthy of trust.

He was startled by Yang Kai’s sudden appearance and stumbled back two steps, asking in astonishment, “What… what do you want?”

Yang Kai looked at him in displeasure, and snorted coldly, “Did you just say that this is the Source Sea?”

“Yes, yes! This is the Source Sea!” The man seemed to be tongue-tied as he replied frantically.

“What is the Source Sea? Explain it to me clearly.”

The man looked bitter, “It is what it is, the Source Sea… There is a large amount of Source Strength gathered here. Also, it looks like an ocean, so everyone calls it the Source Sea. There’s nothing special to the name.”

“How did you find this place? Why are there so many people here?” Yang Kai gazed at him coldly.

“I came with a Senior Brother from the same Sect, that Senior Brother was summoned by someone once we arrived… Friend, what do you really want to ask?” The man relaxed after seeing that Yang Kai did not seem to have any malicious intent and questioned him curiously.

“Tell me more about the Source Sea. Tell me everything you know.”

The man immediately asked in doubt, “Friend, have you never heard of the Source Sea?”

Yang Kai slapped him angrily, “Would I still ask you if I already knew about it?”

The man withdrew his head after getting slapped, hiding his annoyance as he replied with some surprise, “How can that be… with your cultivation, how could you possibly never have heard of the Source Sea? This place should be included in the ancient books of every big Sect.”

“This is a well-documented place?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

“Yes, the Source Sea is a very famous place in the Shattered Star Sea due to the large amount of Source Strength here for us to absorb and refine. As long as we find this place, we won’t need to search for those Shattered Star Sources. However, the Source Sea does not always appear and its location always changes. On average, it manifests once every three openings of the Shattered Star Sea, but each time it does it becomes a Cultivation Paradise for us cultivators!”

“Is there only Source Strength here? What is the faint blue halo then? Why does it have such a strong corrosive power?” Yang Kai asked in a deep voice. He just suffered from the effects of the faint blue halo that looked like seawater because his Divine Sense had not detected the slightest danger from it. However, the moment he jumped inside, the extremely strong corrosive force rapidly melted his clothes and skin. Had Yang Kai had not retreated quickly, he would have suffered more serious injuries.

“No one knows what this faint blue halo is exactly. It has always existed together with the Source Sea and is extremely dangerous. Anyone who dives into it will die for sure…” At this point, he suddenly remembered that Yang Kai was still alive, and immediately smiled in embarrassment, “Friend, you must be quite powerful to be able to escape from there.”

“Many thanks for your praise!” Yang Kai chuckled eerily.

This man had just watched Yang Kai dive into danger from afar without warning him. Although they were not acquainted, it was still a bit much to have just stood by and watched.

Other weaker cultivators would have lost their lives rushing in like how Yang Kai did; however, he could not blame this man, as he had no obligation to help strangers.

The man could not help but smile awkwardly as he sensed that Yang Kai was blaming him.

“Keep going!” Yang Kai snapped.

The man quickly cleared his throat and continued, “There are a lot of benefits that can be obtained from the Source Sea. The people who find this place generally choose to stay here to absorb Source Strength and refine it until the Shattered Star Sea closes. Friend, you have seen it too, this Source Sea is as vast as a real sea, so even if there are many people here, it is impossible to deplete the Source Strength. And… there are rumours that not only scattered Source Strength is present in this Source Sea, some people even claim to have found complete Star Sources, or even Five Element Sources!”

“Complete Sources?” Yang Kai’s expression changed.

He was a Star Master himself, and was well aware of the huge gap between the shattered Source Strength and a complete Star Source. A complete Star Source could greatly help one sense the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao while shattered Source Strength only provided some slight assistance in this regard.

Yang Kai did not expect that there were not only complete Star Sources in this Source Sea, but also Five Elements Sources.

Although the Phoenix True Fire he obtained before was also a Fire Attribute Source, it’s true form was the remnant essence of an Ancient Divine Spirit, not really a Five Elements Source. There was still a difference between the two.

The incompleteness of World Principles inside Yang Kai’s Sealed World Bead was the reason why nobody could break through Great Realms inside it. Source Strength was indispensable to perfect these World Principles.

If Yang Kai could find a complete Star Source here and have the Sealed World Bead absorb it, perhaps the World Principles of the Small Sealed World would become complete, allowing breakthroughs to occur inside without any disturbances.

As such, the information of complete Star Sources in the Source Sea caught his attention.

Soon, his face darkened again, “The Source Sea is so dangerous, so how can we absorb Source Strength and refine it safely? Are you lying to me?”

“I wouldn’t dare to,” the man shouted with a pleading expression on his face, “Friend, you have never entered the Source Sea before, so you wouldn’t know the situation inside. There are many small islands inside the Source Sea for people to refine Source Strength atop without being corroded by the Source Sea’s power.”

“Oh? There is such a thing?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up. He had not really gone deep enough into the interior earlier when he tried to rush in the Source Sea, so he had not seen any of these islands.

However, from his manner of speech, this man did not seem to be lying.

“Friend, you will see when you take a look from above. Everything will be fine as long as you don’t rush into the thing that looks like seawater anymore.” The man seemed to be giving him a friendly warning, and then looked at Yang obsequiously “I’ve told you everything I know, you see… “

“Hmph!” Yang Kai continued to question sternly, “Since this Source Sea has so many benefits, why are you still waiting outside? Is there any other danger?”

“I’m waiting for my fellow disciples,” he responded hurriedly, “My Eldest Senior Brother told me to wait here. Why else do you think I would stay here? I also want to go in to absorb and refine that Source Strength.”

He had an aggrieved expression on his face, probably scolding his Eldest Senior Brother in his heart.

Yang Kai nodded, turned around, and flew over to the Source Sea.

The man shouted at his back, “Be careful, there are several Emperor Realm Masters in the Source Sea now, and no one can save you if you provoked them.”

Yang Kai’s heart sank as he heard it, realizing that things were as he had thought. Zi Yu and Feng Xi were not alone; many had already broken through to the Emperor Realm in the Shattered Star Sea.

This was just the situation in the Source Sea, so what about the other Masters scattered around the Shattered Star Sea?

Perhaps, there are more than a few who have broken through to the Emperor Realm.

The Shattered Star Sea was indeed an incredible Sealed World.

Yang Kai’s expression became dignified as he flew over the Source Sea and looked down, suddenly feeling strangely out of place.

At this moment, he felt like he was soaring over a vast ocean with azure sea waves and surging tides. On the sea, there were indeed islands of various sizes. The small ones could only fit one standing person, while the big ones permitted up to four to five individuals to sit comfortably.

All of these islands were occupied by cultivators sitting cross-legged, absorbing and refining the Source Strength released by the seawater.

The surface of the sea was unpredictable, the tides were sometimes violent, sometimes calm and peaceful.

In such a scenario, cultivators couldn’t refine the Source Strength on the sea peacefully.

It seemed that a shelter was necessary. Yang Kai had suffered from the seawater before, and he knew how lethal it was. He would not be able to refine the Source Strength here at all if he could not settle on an island.

Yang Kai thought of this as his eyes swept over the sea beneath him, looking for a suitable location.

There were a lot of cultivators looking for a place to settle on just like him. They were all flying in the air, but none of them showed hostility towards him. The Source Strength here was incredibly strong and would definitely be greatly beneficial if one could absorb it steadily. There was no point in fighting here unless it was a fight for territory.

And some fights for land were indeed taking place. Yang Kai saw at least a dozen groups of people in battle as he soared through the air. Corpses of cultivators were constantly dropping down into the sea below without a sound, not even creating a single wave when they landed.

After wandering above the Source Sea for an hour, Yang Kai still could not find a place to land as every place seemed to already be occupied.

This made him feel helpless.

He was not the type to seize a spot from others for no reason, so he could only search patiently. Fortunately, the Source Sea was vast, and there were still places he had not explored.

He believed that he should be able to find a good spot.

Looking up ahead, the sky was dark and explosions rang out as a group of people were fighting for territory.

Yang Kai wanted to go around to avoid the battlefield, but at this moment, he suddenly heard a low groan.

“Earth Sword… Falling Thunder!”

The voice rang out, together with a burst of crackling sounds as a blue lightning bolt suddenly pierced the sky and struck towards a certain place.

Yang Kai’s expression changed as he quickly looked over in the direction the voice had come from.
