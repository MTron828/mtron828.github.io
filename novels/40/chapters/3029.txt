Who could have known that the Half-Monster would be such a kind and warm-hearted man? Despite not being acquainted with Yang Kai, he was willing to risk his life to help him; after all, his actions could easily offend Yuan Wu. Going by their current situation, what good would there be to offend Yuan Wu?

Therefore, this man’s actions made Yang Kai’s perception of him improve by leaps and bounds. Still, it was rather strange. This vicious-looking man had blatantly interfered in the matters between them, and although Yang Kai did not know what he was talking to Yuan Wu about, Yuan Wu did not seem upset at him. Rather, Yuan Wu leaned in closer. It would seem that the ingratiating and fawning expression on this vicious-looking man’s face was very pleasing to Yuan Wu.

Afterwards, Yuan Wu did not bother Yang Kai, Lu San Niang, or her daughter again for the remainder of the journey.

Yang Kai stared into the distance and narrowed his eyes. He had been hesitating over the idea of revealing his identity so that he could search for Zhu Qing; after all, he and Zhu Qing were already husband and wife, so it was only natural for him to come and find her. Besides, he also had the Dragon Island Token in his possession.

However, after meeting Fu Qi and Fu Ling, he had a vague feeling that acting rashly in that manner was not a good idea. He might not only fail to meet Zhu Qing if he did that, but it might also cause some unpredictable consequences. Hence, Yang Kai decided to act according to the situation and opportunity. [Let’s find Zhu Qing first.]

Night arrived. A cool wind blew, and the sky was full of stars. An island suddenly appeared in everybody’s field of vision. It was difficult to see clearly, but the size of the island was not small. Furthermore, the World Energy on that island was incredibly rich and pure, extremely suitable for cultivators to cultivate.

Yang Kai observed the island, secretly feeling surprised that the cultivating environment in Dragon Island was this good. [No wonder none of the Dragons I’ve met before were below the Emperor Realm in terms of strength.]

Putting aside the strength of Fu Qi and Fu Ling’s Dragon Vein, their cultivations put them on par with Human Emperors. That was not strange since the Dragon Clan were Divine Spirits though; moreover, they occupied such an abundant Small World so it would be stranger if they were weak.

“Mother…” Lu Yu Qin’s soft voice suddenly came from nearby.

Yang Kai turned at the sound and frowned at what he saw. He discovered that Lu San Niang’s condition was strange. She was shivering uncontrollably and pursing her lips tightly, her face completely pale and bloodless.

Lu Yu Qin had called out in concern upon noticing her mother’s abnormality and asked softly, “Mother, what’s wrong?”

“I-It’s nothing,” Lu San Niang shook her head.

“Mother, are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere? Why is your body so cold?”

“It’s nothing. It’s probably just the wind.” She reached out to hug her daughter tightly.

Lu Yu Qin looked at her mother in confusion but decided to believe her mother despite her doubts. She did not know what was wrong with Lu San Niang for her to be trembling so hard, and it was only getting more noticeable.

Yang Kai had clearly noticed this too. It was obvious that Lu San Niang’s explanation was nothing more than an excuse. Her cultivation was First-Order Emperor Realm, so how could she shiver this badly just because of some wind? That explanation could only fool an ignorant child like Lu Yu Qin.

Observing her silently, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed for a moment as he looked in the direction of that island not far away. He had a rough guess as to why she had such a reaction. She had been kidnapped by a member of the Dragon Clan, brought to Dragon Island, and confined for 200 to 300 years. It wasn’t until a few years ago that she was expelled when Lu Yu Qin was born. For that reason, the place where the Dragon Clan member who had captured her lived must be a nightmarish place in her memories.

Along the way, they had passed by several islands; however, Lu San Niang’s reaction had not been so strong. In contrast, her mental state changed so much that it was strange when the island in front came into view. The reason for that change couldn’t be more obvious; that was where she had been imprisoned for the past 200 or 300 years!

More than ten years had passed, but seeing the land of her nightmares again would inevitably bring back the painful memories from her past. Thus, it was normal to have some reaction. Her emotions were all over the place, so much so that even her flight became unsteady. Her body swayed, scaring Lu Yu Qin so much that she turned pale with fright.

Yang Kai pushed his Emperor Qi at that moment, wrapping both mother and daughter in it. Only then did their flight path stabilize.

“Many thanks!” Lu San Niang nodded gratefully.

To which Yang Kai replied, “Li Jiao entrusted the two of you to me. It’s only natural that I take care of you, so don’t worry too much about it.”

Lu San Niang fell silent for some time, but a short while later, she asked, “I haven’t asked you for your name, Little Brother.”

“Yang Kai,” He smiled.

Nodding, she asked, “I see, so it is Brother Yang. Are you very close to Big Brother Li?”

Yang Kai nodded lightly, “We are very close, like Brothers. That’s why his affairs are my affairs too. You don’t need to be so reserved, Elder Sister Lu.”

He knew the right things to say at the right time. Her love for Li Jiao was deeply rooted, not having faded even after centuries of forced separation; therefore, Yang Kai could not embarrass Li Jiao in front of her. He couldn’t tell her that Li Jiao had suffered greatly at his hands, right? That would be awful of him. Besides, they were only words. It didn’t cost him anything to say them.

Upon hearing that, she smiled, “Big Brother Li might have some Dragon Clan blood running through his veins, but he is an upright and righteous person. He likes to fight against injustice and is also very kind to others.”

Those words seemed to remind her of something from the past and brought a soft smile to her face. After distracting her like this, her situation improved greatly and she wasn’t shaking as badly as before anymore.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai felt speechless. [Is someone like Li Jiao even worthy of such appreciation? It seems love truly is blind. She thinks that he is perfect in every way. I bet she even thinks that his farts smell like roses. Seriously; when he came to High Heaven Palace with Ji Ying not that long ago, he was running around causing trouble left and right. Where was the kindness that she spoke of? I was so tempted to slap him to death back then!]

Needless to say, Yang Kai would never say such things in front of her. He simply followed her lead in the conversation and replied, “En, you’re right, Elder Sister Lu. Brother Li and I might not have known each other for long, but he has been a true friend, helping me with a number of issues.”

Saying that Li Jiao had helped him was the truth. Be it searching for Zhu Qing or coming to Dragon Island, Li Jiao had contributed a lot. That was something he could not and would not deny.

Lu San Niang smiled in response, “He has always been one to suppress the bullies and help the weak. If he had not acted out of righteousness back then, I would have died a long time ago. I would not be able to live until this day.”

The corners of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched. He knew that he was simply one of the recipients of Li Jiao’s ‘helping the weak’ acts in her eyes. It wasn’t hard to understand why she thought that way. His cultivation was only in the First-Order Emperor Realm, just like hers. On the other hand, Li Jiao was a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, so if they ever encountered anything as a group, Li Jiao would be the one they relied on. That was the normal understanding most people would have. Since she had assumed this to be the case, Yang Kai couldn’t be bothered to explain either.

After chatting with her like this, her mood had stabilized significantly and she no longer felt anxious in front of Yang Kai. Their cultivations were similar in terms of realm, so she was able to relax more around him. On the other hand, she felt ashamed, timid, and cautious whenever she stood in front of Li Jiao.

[She is such a pitiful person…] Yang Kai sighed in his heart.

While they were conversing, Lu San Niang suddenly shut her mouth tightly and did not say another word. At the same time, she began trembling uncontrollably again as her gaze shakily looked forward.

Yang Kai looked forward as well, feeling a little speechless. That was because Fu Qi was flying directly towards that particular Spirit Island, marking it as their destination.

[Isn’t this a little too much of a coincidence?] There were countless Spirit Islands spread out across this sea; moreover, the Dragon Clan were scattered and lived far apart from each other. Nobody could have predicted that Fu Qi would lead them to the island Lu San Niang once stayed.

Having guessed the reason for her reaction, Yang Kai couldn’t let it go just like that. Hence, he secretly sent a transmission to her, “Elder Sister Lu, follow me closely when we get on the island. Do not separate from me.”

He did not know whether she heard what he said, but in any case, she showed no reaction whatsoever. The closer they got to the island, the worse her complexion became.

Finally, the group of people following Fu Qi landed on the island. Yang Kai’s previous observation had been accurate, Fu Qi’s destination was indeed this island.

A member of the Dragon Clan probably lived here as there were many palaces on the other side of the island. Although it was late into the night, the lights were flickering in the palaces. Nobody knew what the people were doing inside those homes. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When they arrived, Fu Qi beckoned with his hand and Yuan Wu immediately ran over eagerly, nodding and bowing respectfully. Then, Fu Qi coldly issued some instructions in a low voice, took out a Space Ring, and tossed it to Yuan Wu. Contrarily, Yuan Wu’s expression became as bitter as a bitter gourd. He obviously looked troubled; however, Fu Qi couldn’t care less and flew into the sky, transformed into a Green Dragon that was some 80 metres long, plunged headfirst into the sea, and disappeared.

“Senior Fu Qi! Senior Fu Qi!” Yuan Wu shouted.

“If you don’t finish it within a month, you will all die!” A Dragon Roar rang out from the depths of the sea, causing everybody’s expression to change. Nobody knew why they had been brought here or what they had to do, so how could they remain calm after hearing such a threat?

[One month? What does he mean by one month? What do we have to do within a month?] Nobody knew and all were silent for some time. A short while later, the crowd began chattering among themselves.

Now that Fu Qi was gone, all that were left were residents of Half-Dragon City. There was nothing to worry about now, so several of the more powerful Emperor Realm Masters gathered around Yuan Wu.

“Brother Yuan, why did the Dragon Clan gather us here? What do they want?”

“That’s right. What do they want us to do?”

“What did he mean by ‘a month’?”

“Brother Yuan, do you know something? If you do, please hurry up and give us an explanation.”

“Brother Yuan, you can’t keep it a secret from us. We are all in the same boat. We need to work together to get over this.”

“Good. If we can’t complete the task the Dragon Clan gave us, the consequences will be disastrous.”

…..

That group of people clamoured endlessly and Yuan Wu’s head was about to burst from it all. There was no helping it; it was a matter of life and death after all. Who would dare to take things lightly? Since Fu Qi mentioned a month, then it was a month. If they failed to fulfil his request within that time, forget the 500 people standing here, he might even kill 5,000 people in his wrath. The Dragon Clan had always meant what they said, especially when it came to threats.

Yuan Wu’s face was extremely distorted while at the same time he deeply regretted his actions. [If I had known this would happen, it would have been better to follow Fu Ling to water the Dragon Blood Flowers! Just great. I’m stuck with something troublesome now, something worse than merely bleeding for those damned flowers! What a blunder! Why is my life so difficult?!]
