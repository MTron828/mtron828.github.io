Three days later, Yang Kai was still in a lotus position when he opened his eyes with a grim expression.

He had consumed all the Dragon Blood Pills, which helped grow his Dragon Form from 45 metres to 50 metres. However, after three days of cultivation, there still hadn’t been any progress. He knew that his cultivation had reached a bottleneck and without any special opportunity, it was impossible for him to reach the Second-Order Emperor Realm.

Nevertheless, Zhu Qing’s wedding was just around the corner. He eagerly wanted to increase his power, so he still gave it a try anyway. Unfortunately, he had just wasted three days of what little time he had. He couldn’t improve his cultivation anymore, and all Dragon Blood Pills had been consumed.

[Is there really no other way?]

The Golden Divine Dragon Source within his body was a treasure trove. If there were more Dragon Blood Pills, he could have fully activated his Dragon Source’s potential. If he could just grow his Dragon Form to 100 metres, he would have the confidence of leaving with Zhu Qing. However, it was an extremely difficult task to grow that much.

He had cultivated the Dragon Transformation Secret Art for a long time now, but even with the help of Zhu Qing’s Primordial Yin and more than ten Dragon Blood Pills, he had only managed to grow his Dragon Form to 50 metres, which was just half of 100 metres. If he could grow 5 metres with ten Dragon Blood Pills, he would need at least fifty pills to grow an additional 50 metres, which translated into more than ten Dragon Blood Flowers. This didn’t take into consideration that the difficulty would increase in the later stage of his cultivation. Taking that into consideration, he would need at least twenty Dragon Blood Flowers.

[But where do I get twenty Dragon Blood Flowers?] As Yang Kai thought about it, he was startled all of a sudden. Then, he smacked his own head as he realized how foolish he was. Although it was hard to get Dragon Blood Flowers in the outside world, he was now on Dragon Island, which was the only place where Dragon Blood Flowers were produced. As long as he could find the place where Dragon Blood Flowers were nurtured, he could easily get his hands on twenty of them.

At that moment, he couldn’t believe how foolish he was. If he had thought of it earlier, he wouldn’t have wasted three days of time. With the wedding just around the corner, every breath was crucial, and the three days wasted might determine his success or failure.

Upon that realization, he stopped hesitating and left the Small Sealed World. The Sealed World Bead was now sleeping on the bottom of the sea, so right after Yang Kai got out of it, he immediately felt the immense pressure as though he would be crushed into pieces at any moment. He circulated his Emperor Qi to form a layer of protection around his body to offset the sea-level pressure. After retrieving the Sealed World Bead, he shot up to the surface.

Half a day later, a beam of purple light arrived and landed on the island where Yang Kai had a discussion with Zhu Lie at night some time ago. The purple light turned into a beautiful lady, who was none other than Fu Ling.

She looked around cautiously but couldn’t find anything that felt amiss. Then, she called out gently, “Brother-in-law… Brother-in-law…”

She appeared to be stealthy as though she was doing something scandalous.

“I need more Dragon Blood Flowers.” Yang Kai’s voice was heard behind Fu Ling all of a sudden, which shocked her greatly. Turning around, she realized that Yang Kai was right before her eyes.

Upon hearing that, she put on a bitter expression, “I have none left. I already gave you all the Dragon Blood Flowers I had. If you don’t believe me, you can search me.”

She felt apprehensive when she received Yang Kai’s summoning, but it had never crossed her mind that Yang Kai would make such an outrageous request right after they met up. She was already resentful of him for snatching her three Dragon Blood Flowers previously, so she didn’t expect that he would demand even more.

However, her life was now in his hands, so she wouldn’t dare to show any displeasure on her face. Then, she asked in shock, “Where are the three Dragon Blood Flowers I gave you? Have you used them up?”

Yang Kai replied, “You think it’s a lot? They’re totally not enough.”

Disbelief was written all over Fu Ling’s face as she gasped and widened her eyes, “They’re not enough?”

A Sixth-Order Dragon like her would need ten days to refine a Low-Rank Dragon Blood Flower, and it would take her at least twenty days to refine a Mid-Rank Dragon Blood Flower. In other words, she would need more than a month to consume those three flowers. However, Yang Kai managed to use them up in just a few days.

[Wait… aren’t I a member of the Dragon Clan? Why does he seem more suited to be in the Dragon Clan instead? Is he able to defy the law of nature just because he’s gotten the Ancestral Dragon Source?]

Amazed by the revelation, she sized Yang Kai up as though it was their first encounter.

Displeased, Yang Kai uttered, “I need more Dragon Blood Flowers!”

Fu Ling spread her palms and replied, “I really don’t have any left. Oh, you can get some from Zhu Lie. I believe he still has some flowers left. Do you want me to help you contact him?”

“That’s still not enough.” Yang Kai pursed his lips, “I need the Dragon Blood Flowers of Dragon Island.”

Fu Ling was startled for a moment as she didn’t understand him, but her expression soon changed drastically. She yelled, “W-W-What do you mean?”

“You know what I mean. Stop wasting time. Lead the way. Now.” Yang Kai snorted.

Fu Ling took a few steps back and shook her head repeatedly, “No! If the Elders find out about it, I’ll be thrown into the Dragon Grave!”

[This man must be out of his mind! How dare he try to steal the Dragon Blood Flowers on Dragon Island!? Moreover, he wants me to lead the way! That’s like sending me to Hell. How despicable!]

Yang Kai stared at her with narrowed eyes, “You might still survive in the Dragon Grave, but you should know the consequence if you dare to disobey me.”

Fu Ling’s expression changed and she looked pitifully at him, “Brother-in-law, I can help you with other matters, but this… AHH!”

Before she could finish her words, she suddenly felt excruciating pain in her head, so she couldn’t help but grip her temples with her hands. As she shrieked, her tender body trembled uncontrollably.

With a cold expression, Yang Kai pushed his Divine Sense even harder.

Fu Ling screamed louder as she collapsed to the ground. With her body curled up like a shrimp, she wailed and called out, “Brother-in-law… Please… Stop…”

Ignoring her, he continued.

“AHHH!” Fu Ling looked up at the sky and growled. Following that, a purple light exploded as she transformed into a more than 80-metre-long Purple Dragon. With her body writhing about aimlessly, she plunged deep into the sea.

A moment later, she shot up from the waters, which caused a huge splash. Her Dragon Roar was extremely mournful as though it could shake the sky. She kept alternating between Dragon Form and Human Form.

The unbearable pain and torture she was going through made her unable to sustain either form properly, so she kept changing between the two. In her Knowledge Sea, her Soul seemed to have been seized by a big hand with the intention of crushing it.

Fu Ling couldn’t even utter a word to beg for mercy. She was being subjected to the cruellest torture in this world as she sank into the chasm of pain and despair. Every breath was an endless torment for her.

After the time it would take to boil a cup of tea, Yang Kai finally stopped and looked down at her coldly.

Fu Ling was lying at his feet, her clothes so soaked in sweat they stuck to her tender body and perfectly outlined her luscious figure. Her body was convulsing still and her eyes seemed to have lost focus. Drool was leaking out of her mouth, and her hair was completely dishevelled.

Even a Dragon like her couldn’t endure having her Soul directly tortured. There were countless times when she felt she was on the brink of death. This ordeal would remain her nightmare for life.

“This is just a lesson for you. You won’t get so lucky next time.”

“Y-Y-Yes…” Fu Ling gasped for air as her plump chest heaved. With all her energy drained from her, she lay down on the beach.

After she went through the ordeal Yang Kai imposed on her, reality finally dawned on her. What she was about to do might harm Dragon Island’s interests, and if the Elders found out about it, she would undoubtedly be thrown into the Dragon Grave. However, if she disobeyed Yang Kai now, she would suffer unimaginable agony before dying a cruel death.

Her future Brother-in-law wasn’t a man who would treat women gently, and he didn’t regard her as his family at all, so he had no qualms about torturing her. After weighing her options, Fu Ling knew what choice she had to make.

Members of the Dragon Clan indeed had incredible restorative abilities though, and it only took Fu Ling a stick of incense worth of time to go from lethargic to energetic. After adjusting her clothes and wiping away her saliva, she looked timidly at Yang Kai, “Are we really going?”

After the incident just now, she was instinctually fearful of Yang Kai, which was a feeling she didn’t have previously. Although she knew that her life was in his hands, it was just a vague notion before. Now, she finally realized that Yang Kai indeed had the power to kill her instantly and make her go through an ordeal worse than death.

“Hm?” Yang Kai glared at her with a ruthless expression.

“Good…” Knowing that she should shut her mouth and obey for now, Fu Ling leapt into the air immediately, “I’ll lead the way. Please follow me. If we come across other Dragon Clan members on the road, you have to hide somewhere first.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Without uttering a word or making any move, Yang Kai followed after Fu Ling closely.

The incident just now made Fu Ling resentful of Yang Kai, so she never uttered a word on their way to their destination, unlike her active and passionate self a few days ago. She also appeared to be cautious whenever she took a look at him.

“Where are the Dragon Blood Flowers planted on Dragon Island?” Yang Kai asked.

Despite her grudge, Fu Ling replied, “It’s on an island as well. That island is only used for nurturing Dragon Blood Flowers. It’s one of the most important places for the Dragon Clan.”

“How many Dragon Clan members are guarding the place?”

“There’s only one…” Fu Ling uttered hesitantly.

“What Order is he?”

“Sixth-Order…”

That was basically the same as Fu Ling, so Yang Kai wasn’t afraid of the guard. After giving it a thought, he said, “When we reach there, you’ll distract that guard, and I’ll deal with him. We mustn’t give him any chance to react.”

Embarrassed, Fu Ling replied, “Brother-in-law, we don’t have to do anything.”

“What do you mean?”

Fu Ling pointed at herself and replied, “I’m the guard…”

The corners of Yang Kai’s eyes twitched as he looked at her in a daze. A moment later, he started laughing.

This would mean that he could get all the flowers he wanted without taking much effort, so the plans he had come up with earlier were all rendered useless. [What a coincidence. It seems that they deserve to have their flowers snatched by me.]

Fu Ling laughed with him, albeit awkwardly, and as she gazed at him, she appeared to be embarrassed.

“The Dragon Clan are simply too arrogant,” Yang Kai said with a smile as he was pleased with this unexpected outcome, so he stopped caring how fawning Fu Ling now looked, “They’ve only assigned one member to guard such an important place? Also, it seems that you’re not very dutiful at all.”
