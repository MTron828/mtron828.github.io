Even a Shaman shouldn’t be this weak. The young man in front of him looked like an underage child, his arms and legs thin and frail, a truly ugly appearance. He seemed so weak the Raging Flame Barbarian was worried a single flick of his finger would kill him.

“Ah Niu’s strength is not something you have the honour of knowing!” Ah Hu sneered. Similarly, many of the villagers looked at the Raging Flame Warrior mockingly.

In the past, they, too, had believed that Ah Niu was so weak that he was no better than a ten-year-old child; however, the Beast Tide a few days ago changed their perspectives greatly. The terrifying power and invincible bravery Ah Niu displayed back then was hardly something they had expected. If they had not seen it with their own eyes, it would have been difficult for them to imagine how much power could be hidden in such a thin body.

The Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior from the Raging Flame Clan sneered mockingly and said nothing in reply; it was obvious that he did not find Ah Hu’s words to be a threat. He simply turned around and said, “Shaman Ya is waiting for you inside. Please, come with me.”

While speaking, he walked ahead and led the way.

Yang Kai stepped forward and followed. Similarly, the rest of the villagers followed along.

Upon entering the canyon, Ah Hu and the others looked around and saw that the archers of the Raging Flame Clan remained on the cliffs on both sides of the canyon like shadows. Their bows and arrows never left their hands, an obvious warning that any rash actions would lead to terrible consequences.

Not long after that, that group walked into the deepest part of the canyon where hundreds of Raging Flame Clansmen looked savage and terrifying in the firelight.

The Raging Flame Warrior leading the way came to one of the bonfires and whispered to a burly man sitting on the ground. That man raised his eyes slightly and looked at Yang Kai, as well as the villagers behind him.

[So, this is their Shaman!] Yang Kai had seen him once in the Eagle Eye Spell and immediately recognized him.

Ya studied Yang Kai quietly, an expression of surprise flitting across his eyes. It was clear that he, just like the Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior from before, felt that Yang Kai looked too weak even though Shamans generally did not focus on cultivating their physical strength. Most Shamans spent their time in meditation, so it was a given that their physical toughness would be much lower than their fellow clansmen. Even so, Yang Kai’s tender body was still a first for Ya.

“How should I address you?” Ya asked after observing Yang Kai seriously.

“Ah Niu!” Yang Kai smiled slightly. His expression was neither humble nor overbearing.

“Well then, Shaman Niu… What is your purpose for coming to this place?”

He replied, “We came to bring back my war trophies!”

Ya frowned in response, “Your war trophies?”

Yang Kai gestured around with his hand, “The ones you are roasting above your bonfires, as well as the ones placed over there… All of these are my war trophies!”

Many of the Raging Flame Clansmen, who had been looking at Yang Kai mockingly, immediately became livid upon hearing those words. They stood up and glared at Yang Kai, burning with the intent to beat him up.

Ya frowned for a moment before bursting into laughter, “You claim that these dead beasts are your spoils of war? Do you have proof?”

Yang Kai shrugged, “I don’t have any special evidence!” Pausing for a moment, he continued, “It’s just that our village suffered from a Beast Tide a few days ago. It was difficult, but we finally managed to repel the Beast Tide. After that, I pursued them to this mountain valley and slaughtered all of them. Unfortunately, I couldn’t bring all these supplies back with me since I was all alone. I had no choice but to return and ask for help. I did not expect you to arrive earlier than us.”

Ya’s expression became rather fascinating all of a sudden. He glanced at Yang Kai in astonishment and said, “Did you say… that you chased the giant beasts all the way here and slaughtered every single one of them after that?”

“Of course!” Yang Kai nodded before adding, “Oh, there was also a Barbarian Beast at the time.”

“There was also a Barbarian Beast?” Ya’s expression became even more fascinating.

“Hahahaha!” The Raging Flame Clansmen in the surrounding area burst out laughing, acting as if they heard the best joke in the world. Similarly, Ya couldn’t help but laugh and shake his head repeatedly.

If Yang Kai had claimed that he had worked with the rest of his village to defeat all the beasts in the canyon, then, the story would have been believable. However, he claimed that he alone had killed more than three hundred wild beasts and a Barbarian Beast on top of that! No sane person would ever believe such words.

The Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior that had led the way previously suddenly glanced at Ah Hu disdainfully and said, “Is your Shaman an idiot?”

“What did you say?! I dare you to say that again!” Ah Hu exploded with rage.

Shamans were the leaders of their villages; therefore, a Shaman was the supreme symbol of that village. Insulting a Shaman was akin to insulting the village the Shaman lived in, as well as the entire clan itself! How could Ah Hu and the others possibly accept such a thing?!

“Ah Hu!” Yang Kai shouted and shook his head at Ah Hu.

Only then did Ah Hu grit his teeth and swallow his anger.

“Alright, I have grasped the general idea regarding your purpose in coming here,” Ya smiled slightly, appearing calm and unruffled. He had met many other insolent youngsters like Yang Kai, who were overconfident in their abilities, “Let’s see… Seeing as we are both from the same race and you travelled a long way to get here, I will not make things difficult for you…” Turning to the Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior of the Raging Flame Clan, he commanded, “Give them ten of the beasts and let them leave peacefully!”

When the Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior heard those words, he looked very reluctant. Even so, he had no right to refuse since the Shaman had already said so. Thus, he could only obey.

“Ten… Shaman Ya, you certainly are generous,” Yang Kai smiled mockingly, clearly not appreciating Ya’s kindness.

“Young man, don’t test my patience.” Ya’s expression suddenly became solemn, “I’m sure you are not unfamiliar with my Raging Flame Clan. If it were in my younger days, you would have been lying on the ground by now. So, don’t push your luck!”

Yang Kai nodded, “Ah Niu will take your teachings to heart, Shaman Ya. However… I insist that you return all my war trophies to me. These things do not belong to you!”

As soon as those words left his mouth, he glared at Ya with a burning gaze.

Ya stood up in response, his tall and broad figure casting a shadow over Yang Kai. Looking down at him, he sneered, “You’re asking for trouble!”

The two Shamans were suddenly staring daggers at each other. Subsequently, the villagers responded in kind.

The sound of weapons being drawn rang out. Archers on both sides drew their bows and aimed their arrows at the other party’s strongest warriors while at the same time, Ah Hu and the rest took out their stone axes and stone spears. They were raring for a fight, and their fighting spirit was unbelievably high.

A huge battle was about to break out.

“You will die!” Ya warned.

“You won’t fare any better,” Yang Kai smirked as though he didn’t care who would live and who would die in this battle.

“Are you determined to go to war?”

“I told you that these are my war trophies. You refuse to believe me and are only willing to give me ten of these beasts. However, you know the truth. The wild beasts had been dead for several days by the time you arrived here. Hence, they don’t belong to you either!”

Ya raged, “These are ownerless goods! It’s finders’ keepers!”

“But, the owner has now come back!”

“Give me evidence!”

Yang Kai replied, “I don’t have any! There’s no way to prove my claims!”

Ya laughed mockingly, but before he could reply, Yang Kai continued, “Then, there is only one solution before us. With the Barbarian Gods as our witnesses, let us resolve this dispute the Shaman’s way.”

Ya’s pupils contracted abruptly, staring at Yang Kai in disbelief, “Are you challenging me?”

Yang Kai smilingly replied, “It’s the only solution, unless you want to see our clansmen on both sides suffering heavy losses? Winter is fast approaching. If they were injured here, they will have a hard time surviving this winter.”

Ya considered it for a moment and nodded, “That’s true. But…” He broke out into a savage grin, “Do you think you have a chance of winning?”

“Who knows? We haven’t fought yet, have we?” Yang Kai chuckled

“Good. Since you insist on doing this, then I, Shaman Ya, will accept your challenge in the name of the Barbarian Gods!” After saying that, Ya commanded his men, “Stand down!”

All of the Raging Flame Clansmen put away their weapons and fell back upon receiving his command.

Then, Yang Kai turned back and shouted, “All of you will stand down too!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ah Hu and the others looked at Yang Kai worriedly. Despite confronting the other party just now, they had heard Yang Kai’s words clearly. They might not have seen a Shaman’s battle before, but they were not unfamiliar with the concept. In a Sacred Battle witnessed by the Barbarian Gods, one fought with their life and reputation on the line. The victor would take all the spoils while the defeated party generally received a miserable fate.

“Ah Niu…” Ah Hu opened his mouth to speak. He wanted to persuade Yang Kai otherwise, but he knew that it was too late. Shaman Ya had already accepted the challenge; this battle could not be avoided anymore. Backing out of the challenge at this point was an act of blasphemy against the Barbarian Gods. Nobody could tolerate an act like that. In the end, all the words he wanted to say became one simple sentence, “Be careful!”

In response, Yang Kai nodded and gave him a look that seemed to say, ‘Don’t worry’.

Even so, Ah Hu and the others looked troubled. How could they not worry? Just a few days ago, Ah Niu was still a good-for-nothing, and although his performance during the Beast Tide had been extraordinary and he later became a highly-respected Shaman, it had not been long since that happened. On the other hand, the other party’s Shaman was in his prime. He might not be as old and experienced as their Village Chief, but his aura was many times stronger than the Village Chief. Did Ah Niu have any chance of winning?

Contrary to the worried expressions of the Blue South Village’s villagers, the clansmen of the Raging Flame Clan looked relaxed, as if just waiting for the good show to begin. Gathering in small groups, they pointed at Yang Kai and ridiculed him with mocking smiles as if laughing at his overconfidence.

Anyone with a discerning eye could see that Shaman Niu was not Shaman Ya’s opponent. He would surely suffer a miserable defeat.

Soon, the place was cleared out, and only Yang Kai stood facing Ya in the depths of the huge canyon. They stood approximately thirty meters apart, a commonly used distance in Shaman battles.

The bitterly cold winds were blocked by both sides of the canyon, but they made a whistling sound similar to that of war-horns. Random bursts of crackling sounds also came from the surrounding bonfires.

Ya smiled and asked, “Shaman Niu, I am a Mid-Rank Shaman Warrior, while the aura around you is not very dense. You should be a Shaman Apprentice, right?”

Yang Kai replied, “You have a good eye, Shaman Ya. The Village Chief told me that I am a High-Rank Shaman Apprentice at the moment!”

Ya nodded at those words, “Your courage is commendable. Moreover, you are still very young. If you worked hard, you might have had a better future ahead of you. It’s a pity that you are too arrogant for your own good!”

Yang Kai said, “Shaman Ya, you will have a lot of time to preach later. I’m going to make the first move if you don’t attack!”

Ya sneered. Apparently, he was unwilling to bully the weak, so he simply beckoned for Yang Kai to make the first move. Seeing this, Yang Kai did not hesitate, stomping his feet as he rushed towards Ya like a whirlwind. In response, Ya’s mocking expression froze on his face. [What the hell?! Why is he suddenly charging me?]
