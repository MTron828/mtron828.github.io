“How was it?” Yang Kai looked at the woman with a smile.

“Ah, well…” The woman scratched her head and shifted her gaze away, laughing dryly, “This warship is… well… certainly not bad… hahaha…”

Nanmen Da Jun smiled in response, “Xiao Hou, do you remember what you said before?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

She glared at him fiercely, striking a defiant but resigned posture before she glanced over at Yang Kai and declared, “Fine! Even though I have some minor shortcomings in my character…”

“Minor shortcomings?” The veins in Yang Kai’s forehead throbbed visibly.

“I also have my strong points! My greatest strength is my willingness to accept my losses!” She looked at Yang Kai and unreservedly said, “Since that’s the case, when do we tie the knot?”

“Marriage won’t be necessary,” Yang Kai lifted his hand in refusal, “Grandmaster Hou, you are an Artifact Refining Grandmaster, and I am here to recruit you into my High Heaven Palace. I hope you will take on the position of Chief Artifact Refiner. I apologize if I offended you with my words earlier, Grandmaster Hou.”

“Hehehe…” She covered her mouth and giggled, “Little Brother, you sure know how to talk.” Her expression suddenly became stern, “Let’s make this clear; you’re the one that doesn’t want me to fulfil our agreement. I did not go back on my word. I cannot allow my reputation to be tarnished.”

“Da Jun can testify for your reputation.” Yang Kai smiled slightly and added, “The prerequisite being that you willingly return to High Heaven Palace with me, Grandmaster Hou.”

When she heard those words, her expression became solemn as she turned to look at Nanmen Da Jun before carefully considering Yang Kai’s offer, eventually saying, “If it wasn’t for Da Jun, I wouldn’t even consider it regardless of how many benefits High Heaven Palace offered, but since Da Jun has already joined… I’ll join in on the fun too.”

“I will not disappoint you, Grandmaster Hou!” Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

“Hold on!” She lifted a hand and said, “Before that, I have a condition.”

Frowning, Yang Kai nodded, “What is it?”

She turned around and moved back to the rock she was sitting on before, lifting her leg and pulling up her floral skirt before she placed one foot on the rock. Her actions exposed half of her leg, but she didn’t care. Furthermore, a dice cup had appeared in her hand at some point. She shook it vigorously, and a rattling noise came from inside the cup. After that, she placed it face down on the rock and shouted, “Make a bet with me! The wager will be that warship!”

“That’s your condition?” Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

“Good!” She nodded.

Yang Kai was rendered speechless. He had heard from Nanmen Da Jun that she was addicted to gambling, but he had yet to experience it for himself. [I can’t believe I’d see it for myself before we leave. The Origin King Grade warship refined by Yang Yan must be very attractive to her, which is why she wants me to wager it in our bet.]

“Fine!” Yang Kai had no problem with her suggestion. It was just a small bet after all, “What do I get if I win? What is your wager?”

“Of course, I have something to pay you with!” She snorted and shouted, “What do you choose, big? Or, small?”

Yang Kai glanced at Nanmen Da Jun. The latter said, “Just pick whichever you want, Palace Master. You don’t need to worry about her cheating in this regard. She is always serious when it comes to gambling. She won’t cheat.”

“I’ll choose big then,” Yang Kai casually said. It didn’t matter whether he won or lost anyway. Besides, he would only lose an Origin King Grade warship if he lost the bet.

Following that, Nanmen Da Jun silently took out a Space Ring and tossed it onto the rock, “I’ll choose big too.”

The woman shot a sneer at him, “Careful, you might lose everything you have.”

“Don’t worry! I can beat you with my eyes closed.”

“Alright! The bets have been placed!”

…..

A moment later, the woman grabbed her right wrist with her left hand with all her strength. She looked as if she was staring at her nemesis as she wailed in agony, “No way! How can it be ‘big’?!”

Nanmen Da Jun calmly retrieved his Space Ring and replied, “Adding it all up, you now owe me a total of fifty million Source Crystals, Xiao Hou.”

“Put it on my tab!” She glared at Nanmen Da Jun angrily. Then, she looked at Yang Kai and sighed, “Since I lost, I’ll give you something.” While speaking, she reached into her clothes, grabbed an object, then tossed it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai caught the item unsuspectingly, but when he fixed his gaze on it, he nearly had a nosebleed on the spot.

She chuckled, “It’s my undergarment. And, it’s still warm…”

Yang Kai’s expression darkened as he shouted, “What am I supposed to do with this?!”

She meaningfully replied, “Who knows?”

He sighed. Just as he was about to return the delicate undergarment to her, he frowned suddenly. Unfurling the undergarment, Yang Kai lifted it up and began to study it carefully.

The woman initially wanted to tease him; however, she felt her heart skip a beat when she saw his reaction and secretly sent a Divine Sense transmission to Nanmen Da Jun, “Da Jun, is the Palace Master a virgin? Will he devour me if I play tricks like this on him?”

“Devour you? You of all people?” Nanmen Da Jun sneered contemptuously.

“What’s wrong with me?” She immediately became insulted.

On the other hand, Yang Kai seemed to have spotted a clue and lifted his head in surprise to stare at the woman, exclaiming in astonishment, “Are you the Monkey Grandmaster?”

The woman was taken aback for a moment before blinking and replying, “En, my last name is Hou, and my given name is Yu!”

“So, you are Monkey Grandmaster!” Yang Kai laughed heartily, pointing at the monkey head symbol on her undergarment with his finger.

Only then did Hou Yu understand what he was talking about and smiled faintly, “I see; that’s what you’re talking about. That’s right. I am the mysterious and elusive Monkey Grandmaster!”

“I can’t believe it’s you!” Yang Kai widened his eyes in shock but immediately nodded to himself lightly, “I should have realized earlier.”

He had seen a monkey head sculpture on Nanmen Da Jun’s flying boat previously, and at the time, he had the vague feeling that it looked familiar. Unfortunately, Yang Kai’s thoughts had been interrupted before he had the time to mull over it. Seeing the monkey head symbol on her undergarment again, Yang Kai immediately understood the situation.

When he brought Qin Yu to the auction in Maplewood City a short time ago and spent a lot of High-Rank Source Crystals to buy her the Flowing Clouds Butterfly Hairpin which had a similar monkey head symbol engraved on it.

According to what Qin Yu said at the time, Monkey Grandmaster was an extremely mysterious Artifact Refining Grandmaster whose very gender wasn’t even known. Nevertheless, any artifact refined by Monkey Grandmaster was a magnificent item, and each item could be sold at an exorbitant price.

The name ‘Monkey Grandmaster’ enjoyed a stellar reputation in the Southern Territory, but unexpectedly, the true identity of the Monkey Grandmaster turned out to be a woman. Moreover, it was a strange woman who loved drinking and gambling. In addition, she lost every single bet she made!

[This is such an unexpected surprise. Regardless, Hou Yu’s Artifact Refining skills are already extremely impressive. Combining that with the grand reputation of Monkey Grandmaster, High Heaven Palace has certainly received a stroke of luck!]

At the moment, High Heaven Palace had gathered an Emperor Alchemist, an Emperor Array Master, an Emperor Artifact Refiner, and even had a number of practitioners of the Dao of Puppetry. Furthermore, three Monster Kings oversaw the Sect and there was even a Cross-Territory Space Array that linked both the Eastern and Southern Territories. At this rate, nobody could stop the rise of High Heaven Palace anymore.

Yang Kai’s mood brightened immensely as he waved his hand and said, “I’ll give this Origin King Grade warship to you. It only holds some nostalgic value to me anyway.”

“Seriously?!” Hou Yu was overjoyed. Smiling widely, she bowed to Yang Kai elegantly and gently replied, “I thank Palace Master for his gracious gift.”

Her sudden change in attitude left Yang Kai feeling a little unaccustomed, but she relapsed back to her original behaviour in the blink of an eye, rushing over to the Origin King Grade warship as she opened her arms wide and hugged it as if holding a priceless treasure.

After that, Yang Kai dispelled his Soul Imprint on the warship and she immediately started to refine it. Soon, Hou Yu solemnly placed it away before walking over to him and saying with a stern expression, “Palace Master, I hope you can introduce me to the person who refined this warship if the opportunity arises.”

“I’m sure the opportunity will come.” Yang Kai nodded slightly, “Do you have anything you need to pack? If not, let’s be on our way.”

She threw her head back and laughed, “I don’t have much.”

Years of gambling had made her lose almost all of her assets, so even though she was an Emperor Artifact Refiner, she was actually very poor.

“Let’s go then,” Yang Kai said, “Please don’t resist.”

Having given them notice, Yang Kai wrapped the other two in his Emperor Qi then pushed his Space Principles. With a flash, they disappeared from the cave in an instant. Their field of vision instantly changed as the three of them reappeared in the sky above the island.

Nanmen Da Jun had been mentally prepared, so he didn’t feel anything about it; however, Hou Yu was shocked and exclaimed in amazement, “Teleportation?!”

They had moved from the cave to this spot in an instant, effectively breaking through various obstacles such as barriers and Spirit Arrays around her cave mansion. Even so, she could not detect any traces of Yang Kai using an artifact; therefore, there was only one explanation for that, “Palace Master, are you proficient in the Dao of Space?”

“Palace Master’s abilities are vast and unfathomable. You will be very surprised in the future,” Nanmen Da Jun grinned meaningfully.

Hou Yu was already quite surprised. At the same time, she quietly rejoiced that she had not fallen out and fought Yang Kai head-on previously. [I don’t think my strength is enough to take him on. Even though we are both First-Order Emperor Realm Masters, an opponent proficient in the Dao of Space is terrifying!]

“Oh no, this is bad!” Her pretty face paled suddenly as she hurriedly urged Yang Kai, “Let’s leave quickly. It will be too late if we don’t leave now.”

Needless to say, Yang Kai knew what she was worried about and motioned lightly to her, “High Heaven Palace will become famous across the Star Boundary one day and it will be impossible to conceal the fact that you are our Chief Artifact Refiner forever. Rather than having these people chase you all the way to High Heaven Palace to collect on your debts, ruining High Heaven Palace’s reputation, I might as well settle everything now.”

“Palace Master, you…” Hou Yu looked touched, but unfortunately, Yang Kai’s next sentence shattered her good feelings completely.

“All the payments made today will be deducted from your salary from now onward.”

“You damn woman! You finally appeared! You won’t be able to escape today!” A furious roar sounded while at the same time, a stream of light flew towards the trio at high speed from the distance. At the same time, a kind of flare exploded in the sky, alerting everyone else nearby.

A short while later, the streak of light appeared before the trio and dispersed to reveal the middle-aged man that Yang Kai and Nanmen Da Jun had met when they first arrived on the island two days ago. This man was a Second-Order Emperor and had good strength. The moment he arrived, he locked his Divine Sense onto Hou Yu in order to ensure she did not escape.

When he came closer, he grabbed her with a large hand. Following that, an incredibly powerful pressure pressed down on Hou Yu like a large mountain and she couldn’t help turning pale with fright. Even Nanmen Da Jun shuddered in response. Both of them were only First-Order Emperors; therefore, it was only natural that they had a hard time standing up to this enraged Second-Order Emperor. Even breathing was difficult for them.

Silavin, Okay. So, Hou is the Chinese character for Monkey.
