One had to know that all sorts of hidden dragons and crouching tigers lurked in Maplewood City and Spirit Lake City now. Any random person may well have a distinguished identity and strong backing, so they might end up kicking an iron plate if they were unlucky.

But for someone like Bian Yu Qing, even if she were able to find some help, that help wouldn’t be too strong. Yang Kai was also visibly quite young, so it was hard not to underestimate him.

“Junior Brothers, kill that little brat, then come help your Senior Brother. If we get the Entry Token today, then even advancing to the Emperor Realm in the future will be nothing difficult!” The middle-aged man pointed to Yang Kai and gave instructions to the two men beside him.

The two Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators nodded, a fierce glint in their eyes. In the blink of an eye, their bodies had already moved to each side of Yang Kai.

“Yang Kai, be careful!” Bian Yu Qing warned him.

The middle-aged man could not help but snicker at those words, “Still have the heart to worry about your little lover? Worry about yourself first!”

As soon as those words were spoken, a sword light flashed over along with a figure lunging towards Bian Yu Qing. The middle-aged man was preparing to unleash a fierce slash to start off the battle.

Right at that moment though, two pitiful screams suddenly rang out at the same time.

The middle-aged man’s face changed drastically and turning his head towards the direction of the sounds, his eyes widened into circles.

His two Junior Brothers who had lunged towards Yang Kai suddenly had large holes passing through their chests, ones that could be seen clear through. Even the wriggling five viscera and six organs could clearly be discerned.

“What happened?!” The middle-aged man was utterly confused. His two Junior Brothers were fine just a moment ago, so how did they end up like this in just the blink of an eye? The terrible wounds passing right through their chests had seemingly evaporated their hearts and organs. In other words, his two Junior Brothers had no chance of survival. They were definitely going to die.

They were both Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators and their strength wasn’t that much lower than his own, so how could they be killed in an instant?

Who did it?

The middle-aged man’s first reaction was that a Senior Expert was hiding nearby. At that thought, his lunging movements towards Bian Yu Qing stopped, and the light on his sword also dimmed.

Bian Yu Qing was also stunned. She had planned to kill this man today even if she had to die as well in order to avenge Kou Wu’s death. As long as Yang Kai could delay the other two for a while, she was confident she could do it.

Even though she had not been able to advance into the Emperor Realm, she was still a top existence among Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators after remaining in this realm for so many years.

But now, the two opponents whom Yang Kai was supposed to be holding back actually received critical injuries, and from the looks of things, they weren’t going to live much longer.

Everything happened in a flash, so fast that none of their minds could keep up.

At that moment, an astonishing aura spread out from Yang Kai’s body. Merely by raising his hand and clenching it hard, he was able to explode those two Junior Brothers into a bloody mist, leaving no bones behind.

*Ding dang…*

Two Space Rings fell to the ground, making an extremely light noise, but the noise was deafening like noon bells, shaking everyone back to their senses.

“Emperor Realm!” The face of the middle-aged man twisted in panic as he almost bit his own tongue.

This helper that appeared out of nowhere actually turned out to be an Emperor Realm Master!

And not just any ordinary Emperor at that! Even a First-Order Emperor could not possibly exterminate his two Junior Brothers in just a flash. This young-looking man was definitely a terrifying existence in the Second-Order Emperor Realm, possibly even the Third-Order!

At that thought, the middle-aged man was immediately filled with terror and dread.

He really kicked an iron plate this time.

He couldn’t help but feel desperate enough to cry, yet unable to shed any tears, and that was because he had thoroughly investigated Bian Yu Qing before this. She came from a Sect called Blue Feather Sect, but after the disappearance of its Sect Master, that Sect became disorganized and dissolved soon after. On top of that, there didn’t seem to be any Emperor Realm Masters that Bian Yu Qing was familiar with, so how did such a terrifying helper suddenly appear?

Stricken with fear, he didn’t dare to attack Bian Yu Qing again. All he could think about now was how he could keep his life. This unknown young man was able to kill his two Junior Brothers so casually, so it was likely his own death could also come as simply as blowing a puff of air.

“Yang Kai, you…” Bian Yu Qing was completely dumbfounded.

She never would have thought that Yang Kai could actually grow to the Emperor Realm in just a short few years. It was the Emperor Realm after all! A realm she had been striving towards for so many years but had been unable to even touch. And yet, Yang Kai was able to achieve it so easily! Was this still that little brat that had just joined Blue Feather Sect back then and needed her care? Were all cultivators that came from the lower Star Fields this terrifying?

For a moment, Yang Kai felt like a complete stranger to Bian Yu Qing.

“Protector Bian, didn’t you wish to avenge Kou Wu?” Yang Kai looked solemnly at Bian Yu Qing, “If not now, how long are you going to wait?”

His words brought her back to her senses. Bian Yu Qing focused her eyes and pushed her Source Qi, causing a light to suddenly blossom from the hand which had been grasping the bracelet the whole time. The bracelet swelled as thick as a person’s waist in the next instant, and forming seals with her hands, Bian Yu Qing sent the enlarged jade bracelet shooting towards the middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man was still panicking, so he wasn’t able to react in time when Bian Yu Qing suddenly made her move. By the time he was able to circulate his Source Qi and raise his sword, hurriedly blocking in front of him, the enlarged bracelet had already come crashing over.

There was a loud bang.

The bracelet seemed to have the force of ten thousand kilograms, and it actually managed to bend the Dao Source Grade sword when it hammered down onto it. The residual impact passed through the sword and smashed onto the middle-aged man’s chest, directly shattering the Source Qi layer protecting his body.

The middle-aged man’s face went pale as he seemingly hadn’t anticipated Bian Yu Qing to strike with such thunderous force. He had previously fought Bian Yu Qing with his two Junior Brothers, but that had been bullying using numbers rather than a life or death battle. He didn’t think Bian Yu Qing had any notable skill, but now that he was fighting her one-on-one, he finally realized how terrifying this beautiful woman was.

What’s more, an Emperor Realm Master was watching them from the side, so he couldn’t bring out his full strength with such a distraction.

[I’m not their opponent!]

But before he could even finish that thought, the bracelet that hit him suddenly bounced away, stored up some power, and came whistling over again.

The middle-aged man had already eaten a loss from this artifact once, so how could he not be afraid when he saw it returning for more? He quickly brandished his sword and used a Sword Art to keep his body well protected without any gaps.

But one false step always led to another, eventually leading to ruin. He had already reacted too slowly when Bian Yu Qing first attacked and had now fallen into the enemy’s rhythm. Again and again, Bian Yu Qing’s artifact smashed down on him until his fingers had gone numb and he almost dropped his sword.

More flaws were revealed in the Sword Arts that he had polished all his life.

Bian Yu Qing saw her opportunity and closed in. Wind and clouds gathered in her palms, containing a terrifying destructive force as she thrust it out straight towards the middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man was caught off guard. While worrying that Yang Kai would make a move, he was also on guard about the bracelet’s fierce attacks. He was distracted and could only barely send a sword wave at Bian Yu Qing, but it wasn’t powerful enough and was easily nullified by her.

Her palm landed right onto the middle-aged man’s chest, knocking the blood straight out of his mouth.

It was at the critical moment that the middle-aged man shifted to avoid receiving a fatal hit. Otherwise, that blow alone would have been enough to send him to the afterlife.

Even so, he wasn’t in good shape now. After he was sent flying backwards, the bracelet artifact followed him like a shadow, smashing against him over and over again. Being careless for just a moment would be enough to kill him.

Terrified, he shouted, “Senior! This lowly one had eyes but failed to see! Please have mercy and spare my life! The Broken Mountain Sect will surely grant you a large gift for your generosity!”

He was smart enough to know that his life or death was in Yang Kai’s hands. Even though Yang Kai did not intervene in the battle between him and Bian Yu Qing, he was sure that Bian Yu Qing would definitely be unable to kill him if he could convince Yang Kai to spare him.

And, he had also pointed out his origins on purpose in order to intimidate Yang Kai. At the very least, it was well known that an Emperor Realm Master was commanding the Broken Mountain Sect.

But how could he have known that Yang Kai did not even recognize the name Broken Mountain Sect?

The Southern Territory was vast and had countless Sects, so how could Yang Kai know all of them? However, even if Yang Kai did know about Broken Mountain Sect, he probably wouldn’t put it in his eyes. The Sects that he was in contact with now were all top Sects of each territory. Even those Sect Masters don’t dare to boast in front of him, and Li Jiao and Mi Qi had even been swindled by him for two and a half billion High-Rank Source Crystals! So what was a trivial Broken Mountain Sect worth?

Yang Kai grinned, “This King is not the one who wants to kill you, so what’s the use of pleading with this King?”

The middle-aged man’s face was filled with despair at those words. He knew that Yang Kai wouldn’t let him go, so he turned to Bian Yu Qing instead, “Elder Sister, you’ve lost one of your fellow disciples, and both my Junior Brothers are dead. Why don’t we just consider the matter settled? This one will offer an apology to Elder Sister!”

“In your dreams!” Bian Yu Qing gritted her teeth, her beautiful eyes seeing red as if she had gone insane. Source Qi was pouring out of her body like a tide and it seemed like she would not settle for anything less than killing him ruthlessly.

The middle-aged man fumed and shouted, “Then I’ll fight you to the death!”

As he said that, he was barely able to condense a layer of Source Qi around his body to protect himself. Raising his sword in front of his nose, he ran his finger over the blade and opened his mouth, recklessly coughing up a large mouthful of Blood Essence.

The sword suddenly hummed as if it would shoot to the sky at any moment as an extremely fierce Sword Intent spread out from the blade.

“Protector Bian, you better watch yourself,” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes slightly and warned her, but he didn’t have any intention of intervening. Yang Kai could easily kill this middle-aged man, but revenge was something that had to be obtained by one’s own hands for it to be of any significance.

There was actually no need for Yang Kai to warn her as Bian Yu Qing herself knew that this middle-aged man was ready to throw away his life for this fight. Her expression turned serious as she clapped her palms together and shouted, “Divide!”

As she finished speaking, the bracelet artifact suddenly split into two, then two became four, four became eight…

In the blink of an eye, enlarged bracelets covered the sky in all directions and all crashed towards the middle-aged man. Each one of the bracelets appeared extremely vivid, as if they were all real, and a very strong aura was being emitted from them.

But Yang Kai could tell that only one of these bracelets was real while the rest were merely illusions.

This was not a bad artifact, but it was still just Dao Source Grade.

The middle-aged man felt confused when he saw these changes, and he felt at a loss of what to do, but very quickly, he regained his senses and shouted, “Even if I die today, I won’t let you feel any better!”

Sword light flashed as man and sword united into a stream of light, penetrating through the bracelets and aiming for Bian Yu Qing.
