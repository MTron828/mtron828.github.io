Just then, a seemingly thin and powerless sword light appeared and slashed across the Royal Lord’s head, a palm pushed forward gently, a bamboo cane tapped on the Royal Lord’s skull, and several other Divine Abilities of different forms appeared.

The smug Royal Lord was frozen in place. After he was struck by the Divine Abilities, his body started trembling violently; then, the bamboo cane tapped on his skull again and formed a black bloody hole. As the sword light faded, what was left of the Royal Lord’s head was sent flying away before extremely thick Black Ink Strength that mixed with black blood gushed out of the fresh corpse.

A Royal Lord had been killed! Before the Royal Lord even stepped out of the gap, he had been struck by over 10 Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters and killed.

It wasn’t that the Royal Lord wasn’t powerful, it was just that the Humans had devised such a plot in advance and their reaction was swift. Furthermore, the Royal Lord had to step through the gap if he wanted to leave; hence, he was unable to dodge the attacks from the Ninth-Order Masters.

Any Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master would have suffered the same fate if they were faced with the attacks from a dozen Royal Lords.

The gap was the greatest edge that the Humans could make use of, so it was expected that the Old Ancestors would try to maximise the advantage.

Before the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters could rejoice though, more Royal Lords stepped through the gap.

Their companion’s sudden death didn’t deter them from advancing. Despite knowing that they were faced with mortal danger, they still boldly streamed out of the gap.

Certainly, the dozen or so Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters outside the opening wouldn’t go easy on them. They cast their Divine Abilities in quick succession and killed another two Royal Lords the moment they stepped through the gap.

Regardless, even more Royal Lords rushed out of the opening. Leveraging the sacrifices of their companions, they soon broke through the Ninth-Order Masters’ defences and charged towards the battlefield, ignoring the Human Old Ancestors behind them.

There were even more Royal Lords who had to leave the gap, so the Black Ink Clan knew the battlefield couldn’t just be at the mouth of the opening. That was the reason the Ninth-Order Masters had to be lured away.

More Ninth-Order Masters flew out of the Great Passes to meet the Royal Lords who had broken through the first defence line.

Royal Lords continued to be killed at the opening, but even more of them managed to break through the siege.

In such a situation, even the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters had to go all out, directly using their most powerful moves to try to stem the flow of enemy reinforcements.

Everywhere on the battlefield, magnificent auras appeared in battles that the average cultivator wouldn’t have a right to approach.

Within just half a day, over 100 Royal Lords had rushed out of the opening, and even though 20 of them had been killed before they could do anything, there were still about 80 of them who had managed to break through.

It required the same number of Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters to restrain these 80 Royal Lords.

There were only a small number of Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters left in the Great Passes at this point, and all of them sported solemn expressions because there were still Royal Lords flooding out of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction.

One hour later, the defence of the dozen Ninth-Order Masters at the opening was finally broken. All of them were wounded and powerless to stop the enemies from leaving the opening, so while they were retreating, more than ten Royal Lords bolted out of the gap and chased after them.

At this moment, the Humans had reached their limits as all the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters had left the Great Passes to engage in life-and-death battles with the Royal Lords. The Humans were unable to deal with more Royal Lords.

If another five Royal Lords appeared, the balance on the battlefield would be shattered, so Cang was ready to seal the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction at any moment.

At this point, Mo had released quite a lot of the power that it had accumulated over the years, but while Cang felt less pressured, it still wasn’t enough. Even so, that was the last of his concerns now. If the Humans were destroyed, his efforts to guard the Grand Restriction over the past few millions of years would all be wasted.

To his surprise though, no more Royal Lords emerged from the opening, causing him to furrow his brow. He didn’t think Mo had released all of its Royal Lords as Cang could still feel some powerful auras lurking in the dark. Apparently, quite many Royal Lords remained hidden.

Nevertheless, Mo didn’t release any more Royal Lords at this moment, and after giving it some thought, Cang realised the other party’s intention.

Presently, he wasn’t the only one who wanted to retain the balance of the battlefield; Mo shared the same sentiment. It was fully aware of Cang’s intentions, and knew that once it released even more Royal Lords, the Humans would lose any hope of winning the war, and the gap of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction would be closed. By then, it would no longer be able to escape.

While Cang wanted to maintain a balance, Mo was trying to do the same. Even though more and more of its servants were killed, it seemed it thought the sacrifice was worth it.

[But… What’s the point of Mo doing all this? This kind of balance won’t help it get out of the trap. What is it really up to?] Cang was unable to figure out the reason behind it.

Initially, Mo was indeed as gullible as a young child, but certainly, Cang wouldn’t really regard Mo to be a child after the latter was imprisoned for millions of years. Although Mo had been trapped inside the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, it was able to make use of the Black Ink Nests to find out everything that was going on in the outside world.

Millions of years had passed, so even the most gullible child would have grown cunning.

Since Cang was unable to figure out Mo’s intention, he decided to push it to the back of his mind. At any rate, things were still within his control.

Even though no more Royal Lords stepped out of the gap, there were still a large number of Black Ink Clansmen, including Territory Lords and Feudal Lords, emerging.

Despite their best efforts, the Humans were unable to gain the upper hand on the battlefield, for the Black Ink Clan Army was continuously replenished. The human race couldn’t hope to reclaim their advantageous position if they were unable to cut off the enemy’s flow of reinforcements.

However, this war’s objective was to alleviate some pressure on Cang. Although a large number of Black Ink Clansmen had lost their lives, Cang still hadn’t closed the Grand Restriction; in other words, it still wasn’t time to do so yet.

Left with no choice, the Humans could only grit their teeth and soldier on.

At this moment, Yang Kai was in a difficult spot as well. It seemed that because of his frequent use of Purifying Light, he had been targeted by a female Territory Lord with a curvy figure.

It had come to a point where the Territory Lords streaming out of the gap were no longer clad in the same bone armour as before; they now came in all different shapes and sizes.

Unlike the Territory Lords in bone armour who had an impenetrable defence, these Territory Lords in different forms had their own unique characteristics.

This alluring Territory Lord who had targeted Yang Kai had a special trait; she was extremely agile. She was able to move at lightning speed, and even though Yang Kai had repeatedly used Instantaneous Movement to dart around the battlefield, he was unable to shake her off.

The Territory Lord ignored everyone else as she locked onto Yang Kai and relentlessly pursued him.

If Yang Kai was still at peak strength, he could have transformed into his Ancient Dragon Form and fought it out with her. Unfortunately, he had exhausted himself by moving around the battlefield earlier, so he wasn’t a match for this alluring Territory Lord at this point.

Powerless, he repeatedly fell into danger. Seeing that the situation he was in was increasingly perilous, Yang Kai clenched his teeth and charged towards a particular direction.

Then, Yang Kai turned around and glared at the Territory Lord who had followed him to this place.

Cang teased him, saying, “Does she have her eyes on you or something?”

Yang Kai grinned, “Well, she has fine taste when it comes to men.”

Cang was stunned, for he hadn’t expected this little brat to be so thick-skinned.

“Kill her, Senior!” Yang Kai urged.

Hearing that, the Territory Lord appeared flustered and instinctively took a few steps back as she warily stared at Cang. If someone like Cang made a move on her, she wouldn’t be able to resist.

Nevertheless, Cang shook his head, “I can’t. I can only make a move within the bounds of the restriction. Anything outside the restriction is beyond my control.”

Yang Kai widened his eyes in disbelief, “Is there such a restraint?”

Cang appeared helpless as well, “There’s no choice. I’ve practically become part of the Grand Restriction. The restriction is me, and I am the restriction. Only by doing so could I maximise my control over it. That’s the trade-off.”

Upon hearing his explanation, Yang Kai replied, “I see. It’s fine then, I’ll just get some rest here and kill her later.”

The reason he came all the way here was that Cang had sent a Divine Sense transmission some time ago saying that he could seek his help when he was in danger. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Cang was unable to help the Human Army kill their enemies, but he could make use of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction’s power to protect some of them.

It was because of Cang’s assurance that Yang Kai had the guts to act recklessly on the battlefield. If he didn’t have a nearby sanctuary, he wouldn’t have been so audacious.

Then, Yang Kai turned to glare at the Territory Lord and ran his fingers across his neck, “Wash your neck and wait for me!”

He conveniently ignored the fact that he was just a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master and that even if he was at full strength, he couldn’t defeat the other party.

Enraged by Yang Kai’s arrogance, the Territory Lord sported a dark expression and lifted her hand to summon her Black Ink Strength, which turned into a dark Flood Dragon. As it widened its jaws, it came charging towards Yang Kai.

“Idiot,” Yang Kai snickered, was unfazed. As he was now protected by Cang’ in the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, no one else could harm him. Therefore, he didn’t even bother to blink when he was faced with this ferocious strike.

All of a sudden, Cang chuckled and performed a different hand seal.

About 10 metres before Yang Kai and Cang, the dark Flood Dragon was stopped by an invisible barrier.

A turn of events took place suddenly.

The dark Flood Dragon instantly turned around. As its body expanded, it reached for the Territory Lord and opened its mouth wide. While the Territory Lord was flabbergasted, the Flood Dragon swallowed her before shaking its head and flicking its tail smugly.

Yang Kai was equally astounded.

The next instant, Yang Kai shot out with his spear in hand as a Great Sun rose from behind him. This time, no Golden Crow was heard cawing, nor was there any scorching heat for this Great Sun was formed from flawless Purifying Light.
