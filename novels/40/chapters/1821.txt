After having relieved the uneasiness in his mind, the young man asked in a raised voice, “Friends, can I have the pleasure of knowing your honoured name?”

Having come to realize that it wouldn’t be in his best interest to provoke Yang Kai and Gui Zu, he immediately lowered his posture. He was no longer as aggressive as before.

Just as he finished speaking, a figure appeared before him in a flash. It was the very same person who suddenly fell from the air. A vicious face was almost sticking nose to nose with his face. The young man couldn’t help but feel a little flustered in the face of Yang Kai’s gaze. He backed away in fright.

“Who are you? Where did you come from?” Yang Kai asked in a cold voice.

Only two of the men in black robes were in the First-Order Origin Returning Realm. The rest were all in Saint King Realm. Yang Kai didn’t care about cultivators of these levels.

What he wanted to figure out most was the background of these people and how they came to Tong Xuan Realm.

The two Origin Returning Realm masters guarding the young man didn’t see how Yang Kai appeared before the young man. But they immediately knew that this man was even more horrifying than they had guessed. Their hearts started pounding. The more courageous of the two smiled and answered cautiously, “Reporting to Young Lord. We are members of Spirit Devouring Sect. This is our Spirit Devouring Sect Young Sect Master, Young Lord Mu Cheng Feng!”

While answering, he pointed at the young man and introduced him to Yang Kai.

Mu Cheng Feng straightened his chest as if he had come to realize that his performance just now was a bit unsightly. He tried to calm himself down to save his face.

“Spirit Devouring Sect!?” Yang Kai furrowed his brow and glanced back at Gui Zu.

“This Old Man has not heard of such a sect either. I’m afraid they aren’t that famous.” Gui Zu indifferently replied.

When Mu Cheng Feng and the two Origin Returning Realm masters heard Gui Zu’s remark on their sect, they immediately became a little angry. Be that as it may, their fists weren’t bigger than the opposite party; they didn’t dare to act rashly.

“Is this damned Spirit Array your work!?” Yang Kai stretched his hand out and pointed at the Hexagonal Array behind him.

“Yes...” The Origin Returning Realm master, who had just answered earlier, replied quickly as he furtively wiped the cold sweat off his forehead. “This Bi Zong had spent a lot of time and energy to lay this Array.”

“Very good!” Yang Kai sneered. “Since it was your handiwork, then...”

“Little Brother!” As if he knew what Yang Kai was going to say next, the Origin Returning Realm master interrupted him in horror. “Little Brother, you know that there is not just this one Spirit Array arranged on this world! Led by our Sect Master, all disciples of my Spirit Devouring Sect are on this planet, planning for something big. I request Little Brother to be accommodating.”

“More than one!?” Yang Kai’s face blackened with rage. Furious, he retorted with a smile, “No wonder the World Energy has gotten worse. So it was your damned work. Great, absolutely great!”

That Origin Returning Realm master smiled in embarrassment. “Little Brother, you can’t say that. The cultivation of the cultivators of this continent is too low. Even if we leave the World Energy and let them cultivate, they would not amount to anything in their lives. But it would be completely different if my Spirit Devouring Sect obtained this World Energy. My Sect Master is in the Origin King Realm. His strength would advance by a huge leap if he could devour this world’s World Energy, and if he refines this world’s Star Source, it would bring a ray of life to this place. This dying star would be reborn. Little Brother is so powerful, I think you understand this truth.”

He deliberately brought to notice that the Spirit Devouring Sect Master was an Origin King Realm master, trying to make Yang Kai retreat.

After hearing this, Yang Kai grew even more furious. “You guys also want to refine the Star Source!?”

“Naturally!” Mu Cheng Feng straightened his back. “My Father has already taken the sect elites to the Cultivation Starplanet’s core. I’m afraid he will refine the Source there.”

Mu Cheng Feng was filled with confidence when he recalled that his father was an Origin King Realm master.

He believed that these two guys before him would not dare to kill him without a shred of doubt, even though Mu Cheng Feng had no idea of their origins, let alone their strengths. Anyone with a brain would not be willing to be an enemy of Origin King Realm master.

Therefore, he returned to his former leisure and confident manner.

But after speaking, he found that Yang Kai was staring at him with an even more terrifying gaze. Mu Cheng Feng was taken aback. He immediately screamed, “What do you want to do?”

Yang Kai pursed the corner of his lips into a grim smile. “What else can I do apart from killing you!?”

Just as the last of Yang Kai’s words fell, all the Spirit Devouring Sect disciples in black robes were struck simultaneously as a few swishes rang through the air. They fell down one after another. They were killed right then and there; they didn’t even have the chance to scream.

“Ah!” Mu Cheng Feng screamed in horror. His eyes bulged and quivered in shock and fear. He pointed at Yang Kai and rebuked, “How...how dare you make an enemy of my Spirit Devouring Sect?”

“Make an enemy!?” Yang Kai sneered. “Don’t overestimate yourself. You guys aren’t even fit to be my enemy. Since you dare to act so wantonly in my territory, you can never go back.”

Not only was the Spirit Devouring Sect unscrupulously extracting the Tong Xuan Realm’s World Energy and enslaving its cultivators, but they were also aiming for its Source. How could Yang Kai not get angry?

[Since the Star Source had been taken by Little Senior Sister, there is no need to worry about the Spirit Devouring Sect getting their hands on it. But their reckless behaviour should have caused some damage to Little Senior Sister.]

“You... you... My father is an Origin King. How dare you attack me!?” Mu Cheng Feng was scared silly. Originally, he believed that after he brought his father up, the opposite party would take caution before taking any action. But how could he have known that the young man before him would not care about this at all?

“Origin King, hmph! I have killed more than one. I’ll take your father’s head later!” Yang Kai sneered as he pressed towards Mu Cheng Feng, step by step.

Mu Cheng Feng was so scared that he stumbled on the ground as an obnoxious smell wafted from his crotch. He looked as if he would cry at any moment.

Yang Kai frowned at the sight of this. He hadn’t expected this little kid to wet his pants. After a second thought, he waved his hand and shot a streak of Saint Qi, sealing his cultivation. He then turned to the cultivators of Shrouded Heaven Mansion and said, “He is all yours. You can kill him as you like.”

Over a thousand cultivators, who had been maintaining the Spirit Devouring Array, were watching from the sidelines since Yang Kai and Gui Zu’s appearance. The sight of Yang Kai killing the Spirit Devouring Sect disciples, against whom they were completely powerless, as easily as lifting his hands had left them in complete shock.

Some cultivators had seen Yang Kai’s portrait and immediately understood Yang Kai’s origins and identity.

They didn’t show any hesitation after hearing Yang Kai’s words. Over a thousand men, young and old, men and women, swarmed at Mu Cheng Feng with a murderous look on their faces.

“You... you group of ants...” Mu Cheng Feng was afraid of Yang Kai but not of these Shrouded Heaven Mansion cultivators. He warned them harshly, “If you dare to hurt even a single strand of my hair, I guarantee that you will beg me to kill you!”

The swarm of thousand or so cultivators paused for a moment before they rushed at Mu Cheng Feng even faster.

In the blink of an eye, Mu Cheng Feng was completely surrounded to the point that not even a drop of water could escape.

One after another, kicks and punches struck Mu Cheng Feng. The Shrouded Heaven Mansion disciples at the centre seemed to have a tacit understanding of not using their Saint Qi. They only attacked Mu Cheng Feng just with their physical strength. This way, Mu Cheng Feng would last longer and taste even more painful torture.

“Asshole, how dare you kill our Sect Master! I will make you pay for it!”

“Vengeance for Seventh Elder!”

“I will avenge Senior Sister Liu... Boohoo, Senior Sister Liu, I hope your spirit in the Heavens is watching this. I will avenge you!”

“Make way, make way! Let me smash this bastard’s balls!”

The sight of thousands of people beating one person was especially spectacular. In a flash, a cloud of dust rose around Mu Cheng Feng’s position as constant sounds of thrashing with miserable wails of Mu Cheng Feng echoed in the surroundings.

But after a while, Mu Cheng Feng’s voice slowly started weakening. And after another while, there were no more movements.

“Are you... Holy Master Yang!? Are you truly Holy Master Yang!?” As Yang Kai watched on with a cold look in his eyes, a girl’s voice rang in his ear.

Yang Kai turned to the source of the voice and found that it was the very same girl who was caught and humiliated by Mu Cheng Feng before. Her face was smeared in mud; she looked like a cat. And the torn baggy clothes still on her shapely figure gave her the impression of a grass bearing the brunt of wind and rain. She looked rather pitiful. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

(Ash: She looked like a cat here means that her makeup was all ruined. It’s not a derogatory term. Think of it as when someone’s mascara is ruined after crying.)

“Do you know me?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“You really are Holy Master Yang!?” Suddenly, a sliver of red glow appeared on her beautiful face as she stared at Yang Kai in a daze. The bright glow in her pair of eyes seemed to speak for itself. Tears soon filled her eyes as if she saw her saviour. She immediately knelt down before Yang Kai. “I beg Holy Master Yang to uphold justice on behalf of fellow cultivators across the world!”

“Get up and speak!” Yang Kai was startled. He quickly stretched his hand out and raised it up. The girl immediately felt a gentle force lifting her up, preventing her from kneeling down.

“Don’t cry!” Yang Kai was in a pinch. She kept choking, looking at Yang Kai with teary eyes. Tears kept falling down her cheeks just like pearls from a broken necklace. Just as she wiped off the tears, another round of tears would trickle down her cheeks.

Slowly, her beautiful face was brought to light.

Sure enough, she was extremely beautiful. Mu Cheng Feng might be a bit deplorable but his experience in checking a girl’s features was pretty good.

“If you have something to say, please speak.” Yang Kai heaved a sigh and comforted. “Please stop crying.”

“Yes!” The girl immediately wiped the tears off the corner of her eyes. She could barely hold her excitement. Her plump chest heaved up and down a few times before she could finally calm herself down, “Holy Master Yang is all-knowing and omnipotent. Only you can save our world from this disaster. I beg Holy Master Yang to show mercy on our generation and save the world from misery!”

“We request Holy Master Yang to show mercy and save the world from misery!” All of a sudden, thunderclaps-like shouts reverberated through the sky.

Yang Kai turned to look and suddenly found that the thousands of Shrouded Heaven Mansion cultivators had gathered around him and looked at him with pleading looks in their eyes.

On the other side, Mu Cheng Feng had been whacked to the point that his figure had lost all resemblance to a human figure. His battered and broken corpse was lying in a puddle of blood.

Yang Kai touched his nose in embarrassment and said, “Don’t be so serious. Um, I know a little about the current situation but I just came back. I don’t have that much of an idea. How about you tell me in detail. What’s happening in the world currently? When did these people come?”

“Let me answer Holy Master Yang’s question. These people came to Tong Xuan Realm a year ago...” The girl slowly parted her lips as her beautiful eyes fell into reminiscence. As she narrated, the look in her eyes gradually changed to panic and anger as she recalled the horrifying days and the tragic sight of her fellow disciples being killed.
