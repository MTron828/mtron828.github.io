“Heh heh...” The Embodiment suddenly grinned at the Mountain-titled cultivator.

The Mountain-titled cultivator started sweating profusely, and he couldn’t help but gulp nervously. “Wind, something feels off. This doesn’t look like an illusion.”

The Wind-titled cultivator’s face turned black and he shouted sharply, “Steady your mind, don’t let it affect your senses.”

Even at this moment, he still believed that everything before his eyes was a mere illusion, and it was simply because as far as he was concerned, no one should be able to summon a giant stone man and a young woman out of thin air, not even one of the Ten Great Emperors.

Upon hearing this, the Mountain-titled cultivator took a deep breath and quelled his emotions.

At this moment, Yang Kai revealed a queer smile at the Wind and Thunder-titled cultivators then spoke, “Can you guess how many strikes that Mountain guy can take?”

The Thunder-titled cultivator snorted coldly, “Can’t you live without cheap tricks? Even if an Emperor Realm Master arrives, Mountain would still be able to stand his ground against him for ten breaths, let alone a mere illusion.”

The Wind-titled cultivator also spoke, “Little brat, don’t look down on Blood Dagger’s Four Ghosts!”

Yang Kai laughed then said, “You’ll shortly turn into real ghosts then.”

Saying so, he shouted at the Embodiment, “Did you hear him? He’s claiming that Mountain guy can stand his ground against an Emperor Realm Master for ten breaths of time.”

“Ten breaths...” The Embodiment revealed a nasty smile and shouted, “Three breaths is enough for me.”

Saying so, he thrust his fist at the Mountain-titled cultivator. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

From the moment the Mountain-titled cultivator had shown himself until now, he had never moved away from his current position, and this might have been some sort of restriction put on him by the Formation Technique. He had always been sitting cross-legged mid-air, taking charge of defence and sealing this region. It also looked like he was the one in charge of maintaining the group’s formation like some kind of core node.

Therefore, upon seeing the fist of the Embodiment approaching him, he didn’t plan to dodge the strike at all. Instead, his expression had already turned grave and he pointed his hand ahead of him, summoning Mt. Xumi again.

This time, it looked like the shining Mt. Xumi had almost taken a complete physical form, as if a real mountain was sitting in front of him.

“You’re overestimating yourself!” The Embodiment coldly said and thrust his hill-like fist forward.

*Hong...*

A loud rumble reverberated and the land shook. When the Embodiment’s fist fell upon Mt. Xumi, it gave rise to a shockwave of luminous energy waves that spread to the surroundings.

The Mountain-titled cultivator’s grave expression instantly turned pale and he sprayed out a thick mist of blood, while his aura turned feeble. As for Mt. Xumi standing between him and the Embodiment, it was shattered apart and turned into dispersing specks of light.

“What!” The Wind-titled cultivator’s expression changed.

“That’s impossible!” The Thunder-titled cultivator cried out in alarm.

They both couldn’t believe what they had just seen.

The Mountain-titled cultivator had been known for his innately strong defence, yet his impenetrable barrier had been broken by a single strike from the Giant Stone Man. Mt. Xumi had been shattered, while the Mountain-titled cultivator sustained heavy injuries. The two of them couldn’t help but question themselves again. [Is this also an illusion? If so, then isn’t it too realistic?]

The scent of the Mountain-titled cultivator’s blood pervaded the air and the bodies of the Wind and Thunder-titled cultivators couldn’t help shivering when it reached their noses.

The Embodiment didn’t stop with just a single move though, and soon thrust his other fist out.

*Hong...*

A deafening explosion echoed. This time, the Mountain-titled cultivator didn’t protect himself with Mt. Xumi and resorted to a different method. He revealed more of his Divine Abilities as Earth Attribute energy surged around him. At the same time, Earth Principles lingered around him, transforming into a giant shield that protected him.

*Kachaca...*

As cracking noises echoed out, a luminous membrane covering a perimeter of several hundred metres appeared. But this membrane was already covered with cracks like a shattered mirror and it didn’t take more than a blink of an eye for it to burst open and turn into specks of light, shortly dissipating.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai found that his body became lighter, as if he had just been freed from some kind of shackle. He grinned at the Wind and Thunder-titled cultivators, “It looks like the seal has been broken. Are you still so sure that this is just an illusion?”

The faces of Wind and Thunder-titled cultivators turned gloomy and confused. They were clearly dismayed by what they had just witnessed and heard. They were no longer certain that it was an illusion.

*Pu...*

On the other side, the Mountain-titled cultivator spouted another mouth of blood with his face as pale as paper, and his aura turned even more feeble and unstable. He gazed over at the Wind-titled cultivator and Thunder-titled cultivator and spoke with great difficulty, “Save... me!”

The Embodiment laughed wantonly and thrust his fist for the third time.

At this moment, the Mountain-titled cultivator couldn’t put up any more resistance and had to helplessly watch as the hill-like fist descended. He felt his body go cold, while his limbs cramped up.

The fist fell upon the Mountain-titled cultivator, and his body burst into a blood fog which then sprinkled lightly on the ground, his aura disappearing completely.

“See, it has been just three breaths of time.” After the Embodiment settled the fight, he grinned at Yang Kai.

In response, Yang Kai gave him a thumbs up.

The Wind and Thunder-titled cultivators exchanged a glance. They both realized that the current situation was anything but reassuring and they couldn’t bother with paying heed to the Void Cracks around them any longer. They both pushed the Principles around them to break through the Space Principle blockade and escaped in two different directions.

“Since you’ve come, don’t even dream about leaving!” As Yang Kai let out a chuckle, his body flickered and appeared suddenly in front of the Wind-titled cultivator, stretching his Dragon Claw toward him.

The Wind-titled cultivator’s face turned pale from fright and he raised the dagger in his hand, trying to parry Yang Kai’s claw with it. Wind Principles swirled around the dagger and it gave off a domineering might.

A vicious glint flashed past Yang Kai’s eyes as he directly caught the dagger with his Dragon Claw, leading to a jarring metallic reverberation.

“What the hell is this...” The Wind-titled cultivator’s eyes all but popped out of their sockets. He discovered in shock that his opponent had managed to block his strike with his flesh body without sustaining any injuries.

His dagger was a Dao Source Grade Artifact, one that even an Emperor Realm Master wouldn’t dare to catch with their bare hands, yet this boy managed to do so.

The Wind-titled cultivator had fallen into a trance for a short moment, but this short moment had been more than enough for Yang Kai to place his other palm on his chest. Yang Kai’s berserk Source Qi erupted and flooded the Wind-titled cultivator’s body.

As a splurting sound echoed out, the Wind-titled cultivator’s blood burst from his body like he had been struck by lightning, while the wind shrouding his body quickly weakened.

Yang Kai shortly closed in on him and weaved a series of hand seals, suppressing the Wind-titled cultivator’s cultivation.

Even though a disheartened look was plastered on the Wind-titled cultivator’s face, he still looked at Yang Kai coldly and said aggressively, “If you want to kill me, then just do so. Blood Dagger’s headquarters will shortly obtain word about our failure and they will send more powerful people after you next time.”

“If I kill all of you, then who will divulge any information about me?” Yang Kai sneered coldly in response.

The Wind-titled cultivator replied, “Thunder’s Movement Skill is second to none in the world, you won’t be able to catch him.”

“Did you lose your mind from fear?” Yang Kai smiled in mockery.

“Wind...”

At this moment, a dispirited shout echoed out near him. Upon hearing it, the Wind-titled cultivator turned his head around to see the Thunder-titled cultivator. He was trapped in mid-air between countless pitch-black buzzing Moon Blades, not daring to make any rash movements.

“How did you...” The Wind-titled cultivator looked in disbelief at the Thunder-titled cultivator. He didn’t expect that the Thunder-titled cultivator would also fail to escape.

“I was outmatched!” The Thunder-titled cultivator sighed and looked at Yang Kai with a complex gaze, saying, “Our superiors underestimated him, we aren’t... his opponent.”

“So, that’s how it is...” The Wind-titled cultivator revealed a miserable smile.

“I’ll be going on ahead,” The Thunder-titled cultivator suddenly spoke in a deep voice and weaved a series of hand seals, his body’s Source Qi fluctuating wildly as his body started swelling up.

Yang Kai’s expression changed and he shouted, “You dare!?”

The Thunder-titled cultivator revealed a mocking smile, “I’m not a match for you, but I can still choose how I want to die.”

Saying so, his body blew up, not leaving anything behind.

After he was trapped, he decisively chose to self-destruct. He was a decisive man with a firm resolve and Yang Kai couldn’t obstruct him in time.

The might of a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator’s self-destruction was dreadful!

An unstable black hole opened, causing chaotic currents to flood the surrounding region. Even though Yang Kai was still far from the explosion, he was knocked off balance because of the shockwaves. As for the Wind-titled cultivator, whose cultivation base had been sealed, he just let out a soft groan before breathing his last breath. His bones had been shattered and he bled to death through his seven orifices.

As for Ye Jing Han, her pretty face had turned deathly pale. She had been sent flying by the shockwaves and had to use all her Source Qi just to defend herself.

After a long while, the shockwaves finally died out.

As Yang Kai’s body flickered, he went to check in the Wind-titled cultivator only to find his body lifeless. He couldn’t be any more dead than this.

“Damn it!” Yang Kai couldn’t help but curse out loud as he raised his head to gaze at Hua Qing Si and shouted, “Sister Hua, don’t take his life!”

Yang Kai had no idea what kind of organization Blood Dagger was nor why they were looking for him. If he could capture one or two of them alive, then he might be able to extract some information from them.

He didn’t kill the Wind-titled cultivator and instead sealed his cultivation mainly for this purpose; however, even Yang Kai didn’t expect that he would end up dead due to the Thunder-titled cultivator’s self-destruction.

The Mountain-titled cultivator had already been turned into a blood fog, so the sole survivor was the Fire-titled cultivator. As such, Yang Kai couldn’t afford to have him die too.

But shortly after he shouted those said words, he stood in a daze.

Hua Qing Si standing next to her bright-coloured ribbon turned her head and looked with a bitter smile at him while shouting, “That... won’t be easy!”

Not too far from her, the Fire-titled cultivator was laughing nastily with his mouth overflowing with blood and his dagger plunged into his heart. Great pain was apparent on his face, but he still laughed heartily, “Once Blood Dagger makes a move, it won’t stop until its target is dead. Hahaha!”

It looked like he had chosen to kill himself after witnessing his companions’ deaths. He obviously realized that he wouldn’t get a chance to escape, so he did not hesitate to stab himself through the heart.

Even an Emperor Realm Master wouldn’t live for long after receiving this kind of mortal injury, let alone the Fire-titled cultivator who was just a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator. If Yang Kai simply did nothing, then he would soon die.

The ashen face of Yang Kai changed colour several times before he gritted his teeth and snapped, “Trying to seek death without my permission? In your dreams!”

Saying so, his body flickered and he arrived in front of the Fire-titled cultivator before tapping his body with his palm, sealing his cultivation. If this man self-destructed like the Thunder-titled cultivator, then Yang Kai wouldn’t be able to reverse the situation and save him.

“You... what are you doing?” Even though the Fire-titled cultivator had already heard death’s call, he still got scared by Yang Kai’s malicious look.

Yang Kai sneered. “Isn’t it obvious? I’m trying to save you, no need to thank me.”
