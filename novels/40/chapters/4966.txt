Chapter 4967 – Over There

The Black Ink Clan was different. Anyone from their army could freely roam the battlefield. There were the Territory Lords and Feudal Lords, who were the strongest in the Black Ink Clan besides the Royal Lords, but there were also Black Ink Clansmen who were only as strong as First-Order Open Heaven Realm cultivators. How could such weaklings be Yang Kai’s opponent?

Therefore, even though there was a huge disparity in numbers between the two clans, with the Black Ink Clan Army always being many times larger than the Human Race Army, the latter had not yet been defeated. Each time, the Black Ink Clan Army would be forced to retreat. With their army diminished, they had to return to their territory to recover, and then made a comeback after dozens or hundreds of years.

Thus, the cycle repeated.

World Force shook wherever Yang Kai’s spear passed, and several Black Ink Clansmen would die. The death of each Black Ink Clansman would cause Black Ink Strength to leak out, which would condense on the battlefield, eventually forming Black Ink Clouds.

Black Ink Clouds would not do any harm to the Black Ink Clan; in fact, they provided them with a tactical advantage as they served as both a form of protection and deterrent.

Before Yang Kai came to Blue Sky Pass, the Human Masters would normally avoid the Black Ink Clouds on the battlefield, both to avoid being ambushed and to avoid being corrupted by the Black Ink Strength.

This sort of ambush happened quite frequently on the battlefield, as the Black Ink Clan would often attack passing Humans while sheltering in the Black Ink Clouds.

However, after the arrival of Yang Kai and his Purifying Light Secret Technique became well known, the Human Masters became unconcerned with the Black Ink Clouds.

When a Black Ink Clansman was injured in the past, he would look for a way to flee into nearby Black Ink Clouds in order to survive as no human would have the audacity to follow him in.

But things had changed now. Even if they took cover inside the Black Ink Clouds, the Human Race Masters would still pursue and attack, catching many Black Ink Clansmen off guard and increasing the number of their losses greatly.

The Black Ink Clan was also confused by this sudden change and couldn’t understand why the Humans from Blue Sky Pass had suddenly become so aggressive.

As Yang Kai fought, attacking all the enemies he encountered, he saw a group of Human Masters fighting nearby. These Masters were all in the Seventh-Order, as only such Masters could effectively play a role without the protection of a warship.

He had arrived here immediately after rushing out of the Mountain Battalion’s warship and received little attention from these nearby Seventh-Order Masters as they were all engaged in battle and could not spare him too much thought at the moment. If one was careless in this place, they could end up dead, so who would not focus all their attention on the enemies in front of them?

However, the Seventh-Order Masters in the area soon took notice of Yang Kai. This was unavoidable though, as it was clear from Yang Kai’s aura that he was the only Sixth-Order. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It was not that Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters would not appear on the battlefield, but in most cases when they did, it indicated that a warship had been destroyed, exposing the Sixth-Order and Fifth-Order Open Masters who were sheltering inside it.

So, after realising Yang Kai’s cultivation, the Seventh-Order Masters assumed that he belonged to that scenario and began to move to protect him.

However, the Seventh-Order Masters were a little taken aback when they witnessed the might of Yang Kai’s spear thrusts. No ordinary Sixth-Order Master could possess such strength.

There were a total of four Seventh-Order Masters close to Yang Kai. The leader of this small group seemed to be an elderly man as his cultivation was clearly the strongest of the four. As for the other three Masters, they were a lanky middle-aged man, a young man who appeared to be around Yang Kai’s age, and a beautiful woman.

These four Masters and the warship which was accompanying them must have belonged to a certain Battalion. Yang Kai, who was already familiar with the distribution of forces in Blue Sky Pass, quickly determined this.

“Little Brother, which Battalion are you from? Why did you come here?” The lanky middle-aged man slashed out a shocking sword wave, dispersing the Black Ink Clan Army in front of him and giving him a moment to ask Yang Kai amidst the chaos.

“Fourth Division Mountain Battalion!” He simply said.

Technically he wasn’t lying as he indeed came out of Blue Sky Pass with the Fourth Division Mountain Battalion.

The middle-aged man sighed, subconsciously believing that the Fourth Division Mountain Battalion’s warship had been destroyed. Due to this, the boy in front of him was forced onto the battlefield alone, so he said, “Get back on board. You’re not qualified to be out here.”

Coincidentally, their Battalion’s warship was coming up on them. Although Yang Kai did not belong to their Battalion, they were all fighting for the same cause; therefore, taking him aboard their ship was not an issue.

Yang Kai turned to look at this man, raised his spear, and began condensing a scorching power which filled the surrounding void. The cry of the Golden Crow rang out as a Great Sun appeared.

The surrounding void was suddenly illuminated as this Great Sun rose.

The Golden Crow cried out ecstatically as it circled around the Great Sun.

The Great Sun perched itself atop the long spear and Yang Kai thrust it out into a nearby mass of Black Ink Clansmen.

A massive halo suddenly erupted within the Black Ink Clan Army and ignited a region 1,000 kilometres in radius. The blazing force of the light blanketed the landscape, the space itself began warping under the force. A great number of Black Ink Clansmen yelled and wailed before disintegrating into ash under the light of the Great Sun.

With a single strike, at least 10,000 Black Ink Clansmen were obliterated.

The nearby old man’s brow rose as he and the young man looked at Yang Kai in great shock while the beautiful woman exclaimed, “Divine Manifestation?”

They had witnessed the Great Sun’s brilliance, and they knew that it was no ordinary Divine Ability or Secret Technique. It was undoubtedly a Divine Manifestation.

But… how could a Sixth-Order Master have a Divine Manifestation? How was that possible? The four of them almost thought they had seen wrong.

Only Seventh-Order Masters were capable of using Divine Manifestations, and not every Seventh-Order Master had comprehended one. Despite the fact that all four of them were Seventh-Order Masters, only the old man and the middle-aged man who spoke to Yang Kai just now had their own Divine Manifestations, the other two had yet to fully comprehend one.

The young man and the lovely woman exchanged glances as they both noticed the astonishment in each other’s eyes and simultaneously felt somewhat ashamed.

Unlike the two of them, this Sixth-Order Junior could cast a Divine Manifestation, which was simply unprecedented in their opinion.

Although Yang Kai didn’t say anything, his message was clear as he cast a quick glance at the middle-aged man who spoke to him earlier on. [Though I’m an Order lower than you, I’m not that weak. There’s no need for me to fall back.]

The middle-aged man instantly understood as he grinned, though his brow twitched slightly as he spoke, “Since that’s the case, do as you please. Just be careful, kid. On the battlefield, you can only rely on yourself, don’t count on anyone saving you if you find yourself in trouble.”

With that said, he re-focused his attention on his own battle.

Although the Great Sun eliminated a large number of enemies, the Black Ink Clans soon regrouped. These enemies, surrounding by Black Ink Strength, seemed almost inexhaustible.

Back near Blue Sky Pass’ defence line, Zhong Liang and Feng Ying strained their eyes as they scanned the battlefield.

As a result, Zhong Liang had gotten no useful information up to this point. He only knew that after Yang Kai escaped the Fourth Division Mountain Battalion, he flew off into the battlefield alone. Nobody knew his whereabouts now.

Suddenly, somewhere out on the battlefield several tens of thousands of kilometres away, a distinctive explosion of light occurred.

Zhong Liang’s expression changed as he immediately looked over.

He remembered the first time he saw Yang Kai casting Purifying Light on the battlefield; the bright and pure white light was a sight never before seen in this war.

With the eruption of that white light, the Black Ink Territory Lord who battled against Zhong Liang was badly injured and subsequently killed by Feng Ying.

Right now, what caught their eyes was not a pure white light though, but a dazzling orange-red light like a small Sun.

Zhong Liang felt both relieved and disappointed.

He was relieved that it wasn’t the Purifying Light as he was concerned that Yang Kai might reveal it again in the heat of battle. It would be too obvious that it could suppress the Black Ink Clan once that happened, and the leaders of the Black Ink Clan wouldn’t naturally not ignore such a threat, putting Yang Kai into a risky position.

However, he was disappointed as it didn’t provide any clues about Yang Kai’s whereabouts.

On the other hand, Feng Ying’s eyes lit up as she shouted, “Martial Uncle, over there!”

She pointed to where the little Sun erupted.

“That was created by Yang Kai?” Zhong Liang frowned.

“Golden Crow Casts the Sun! That’s his Divine Manifestation!” Feng Ying said, nodding.

“Divine Manifestation? He has a Divine Manifestation?”

“Although it is unbelievable, he does. I saw him use it once as we were making our way back here,” Feng Ying confirmed.

Due to this event, Feng Ying was able to locate Yang Kai, making it a stroke of luck in this chaotic battlefield.

Zhong Liang gaped, unsure what to say.

A Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master possessed a Divine Manifestation? This was something never heard of or seen before. What sort of Heaven-defying aptitude did it require for Yang Kai to possess a Divine Manifestation in the Sixth-Order? But the words came from Feng Ying, so it shouldn’t be a mistake.

“Why didn’t you tell me sooner?” Zhong Liang raged.

[Well, you never asked…]

Everyone was drawn to Yang Kai’s Purifying Light when he arrived at Blue Sky Pass; they knew he had mastered the means of restraining Black Ink Strength and thus had great hopes for this method.

Who would have paid attention to Yang Kai’s own strengths and aptitude at that point?

Forget about if Yang Kai was a Heaven-defying talent, even if he was a mediocre individual, Purifying Light was all that was necessary to make him critical to the Human Race and someone who had to be protected at all cost.

“Adjutant!” Zhong Liang abruptly yelled.

A Seventh-Order Open Heaven young woman rushed over, cupped her fist, and shouted, “Sir!”

“What’s the situation with the Eastern, Northern, and Southern Armies?” Zhong Liang asked anxiously.

The woman quickly replied, “The Three Army Commanders have responded and agreed to cooperate with the operations here!”
