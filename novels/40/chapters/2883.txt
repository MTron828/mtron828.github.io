Yang Kai’s figure suddenly appeared, as if he had been hiding nearby all the time.

The eight Demon Kings with Fei Li as their leader all turned solemn and bowed together, “Sir!”

Yang Kai nodded, and instead of praising or greeting, he declared, “I want Fort Torrent to writhe in torment!”

After the words fell, he waved his hand, and the eight Demon Kings were thrown out of the Sealed World Bead, returning them to the hall.

Fei Li, Mo Ke Tuo, and the others looked at each other, each of them feeling a chill from the bottom of their hearts so cold that it threatened to freeze their blood. The eight Demon Kings knew that this was Sir Shaman Niu’s revenge toward their clansmen. The curse that he declared a month ago was no idle threat, but rather an oath he was determined to fulfil, and now, they were the most powerful tools in Sir Shaman Niu’s hands.

“Let’s discuss it.” Fei Li had a slight headache. Although he had only a skeleton frame instead of flesh and blood, he still felt a throbbing pain in his neck he was unfamiliar with. Sir Shaman Niu truly gave them a difficult task.

Their strength was indeed outstanding, but given that there were about a hundred thousand Demons in Fort Torrent, they couldn’t kill all of them with their own strength. If they were to complete this task, they needed to employ other means.

The only advantage they had now was that the Demon Kings who originally garrisoned in Fort Torrent were gone. There were no leaders in Fort Torrent, so if the eight of them operated properly, they may be able to control Fort Torrent and find a way to complete the task.

The eight Demon Kings gathered in the hall and began to discuss seriously. The content of their meeting was not about dealing with the foreign race, but rather how to kill the Demons in Fort Torrent.

Brainstorming, they soon came out with a set of plans and dispersed.

A day later, rumours came up in Fort Torrent and began to spread wildly amongst the Demon soldiers. Some rumours claimed that an army of the foreign race was coming, while some said that the Demon Kings had joined the enemy; still others said that the Demon Race was about to lose tragically.

No one knew where the rumours came from, but they seemed to only grow wilder by the day.

The Demons garrisoned in Fort Torrent had nothing to do while they all yearned to rush out to battle, so with natural tension and the lack of an outlet, their emotions became quite unstable. Therefore, the emergence of these rumours only amplified their anxiety, causing Fort Torrent to be shrouded in a strange atmosphere.

In the beginning, the effect of these rumours was not so obvious, but with the passage of time and without any clarification from the Demon Kings, many Demons started to believe them.

After three days, the anxiety which was aroused by the various rumours finally exploded. Every Demon was affected, whether it was directly or indirectly. Their thoughts were clouded and they could no longer behave rationally.

Fei Li and the other Demon Kings acted at that moment, each of them gathering a group of Demons under them, carving up the hundred thousand soldiers in the city into individual camps.

Soon, a civil war broke out.

In Fort Torrent, various groups of Demons fought each other for no reason in every corner of the city. Many Demons fell, and Fort Torrent almost overflowed with blood. These clansmen who were friends just a few days ago had now turned into sworn enemies.

No one knew what this was about, only that it was the orders of the Demon Kings, and they only had to obey.

No one would have thought that the honourable Demon Kings would betray them, and no one would have thought that these Demon Kings would point their swords at their own people.

Some Demon Great Generals and smart Demon Generals began to suspect something was amiss, but they were unable to live long because Fei Li and the other Demon Kings had been keeping an eye on them. Once someone started doubting, they would execute them for some made-up reason or excuse.

Fort Torrent seemed to have turned into a huge meat grinder, trapping more than a hundred thousand Demons in it, crushing and dismembering them.

The civil war raged without end, and at the late stage of the war, every Demon had already lost their mind, their eyes turned bloody red. They simply raised their weapons like drones and slaughtered all seemingly suspicious enemies.

The war lasted for three days and three nights, with the more than one hundred thousand Demons divided into eight camps slaughtering each other. Countless bodies were stacked in the streets and alleys of Fort Torrent, where flies and maggots invaded, and a foul stench penetrated the air.

Three days later, less than ten thousand people had survived, but all of them were injured. All of them were mutilated to various degrees, groaning in pain.

The eight Demon Kings looked down silently from the air at the purgatory before them.

Then, they took action together and sent the remaining ten thousand disabled Demons, together with the entire Fort Torrent, to Hell, leaving nothing left of that base.

With a flash, Yang Kai appeared like a ghost.

The eight Demon Kings bowed.

“You’ll follow me from now on,” Yang Kai announced. After this incident at Fort Torrent, Fei Li and the others could never return to the Demon Race again.

The eight Demon Kings nodded in acknowledgement with mixed feelings.

Yang Kai opened the gate of the Sealed World Bead, and the Demon Kings filed in one by one before he turned and flew off in a certain direction.

Ten days later, Yang Kai arrived atop a certain jungle and searched below him with concentration. A moment later, he seemed to have found something and rushed down to a certain place.

After landing, he looked in a certain direction and shouted, “Come out!”

A graceful figure appeared leisurely from behind a big tree, and after seeing Yang Kai, she immediately revealed a look of pleasant surprise and called out, “Sir, it’s really you. I thought I heard wrongly.”

While talking, she rushed towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai looked at her coldly.

Sha Ya immediately stopped about ten metres away from Yang Kai, as if she had noticed something. Her beautiful face turned a little bloodless and she hurriedly explained, “Sir, I didn’t betray you, really. Please believe me.”

Yang Kai replied coldly, “You would already be a dead woman if you had even thought of betrayal.”

Sha Ya’s face turned even more pale as she looked at Yang Kai fearfully, the joy from reuniting with him disappearing entirely.

“Tell me, what happened? Why are you here alone? Where’s Bao Qi? What about the Shaman Niu Clan?” Yang Kai asked several questions in one go.

He could sense that Sha Ya and Bao Qi were not together, which bewildered him, so he came here straight away. At first, he thought that one of the two Demon Kings, either Bao Qi or Sha Ya, had betrayed him and escaped from the Shaman Niu Clan, but he now found that he was wrong after seeing Sha Ya.

Sha Ya did not betray him, but she was indeed a little frightened, like a lost rabbit.

“Bao Qi is with all of them,” Sha Ya hurriedly replied, “They were all captured.”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, “Captured? Who captured them?”

There were twenty thousand people in the Shaman Niu Clan, including several dozens of Shamans, a thousand in cavalry, and several dozen Aerial Cavalry. It was a great force in this war, and although it was incomparable to the Demon Race in Fort Torrent before, it was extremely outstanding for a Barbarian Race army.

Who had the ability to capture twenty thousand warriors?

“It was your own Barbarian Race, it seems to be a Clan called… The Bone Devouring Clan!” Sha Ya recalled.

Yang Kai’s face changed, “Are you sure it’s the Bone Devouring Clan?”

“I don’t know what the Bone Devouring Clan looks like, but that’s what Tiea said. She said those guys were from the Bone Devouring Clan.”

“Why did the people from the Bone Devouring Clan pick on my Shaman Niu Clan, did they…” Before he finished, Yang Kai suddenly realized the problem.

Sha Ya continued, “Bao Qi and I were discovered by them. They seemed to think that the Shaman Niu Clan was controlled by us, so they started a fight. The twins tried to persuade them, but it was to no avail. Instead, they were hurt by those Shaman Kings. Bao Qi and I couldn’t beat them, then Bao Qi ended up being captured while I found an opportunity to escape and hid here all this time.”

Sha Ya really wanted to cry. A few months ago, she was still a Demon King who was in charge of an army of thousands of Demons, but now, she had fallen into this situation like a lost dog, chased down by everyone.

The Barbarian Race did not accept her identity and would definitely attack her whenever they saw her, while on the Demon Race side, she did not dare to go back because she was afraid of being caught by Mo Duo. As a Demon King, she actually had to live like a mouse, hiding everywhere to avoid being found.

“Were there any casualties in the Shaman Niu Clan?” Yang Kai asked.

Sha Ya shook her head, “Everyone else was fine, only Yue and Lu were slightly injured. Tiea ordered everyone not to resist.”

“It was the right choice not to fight them.” Yang Kai nodded. If the Shaman Niu Clan really fought back, they would never be able to convince them of their innocence. It was reasonable for the Bone Devouring Clan to suspect them because it did not make sense for the Barbarian Race to work with two Demon Kings. Everything still could be solved if they did not start a fight, otherwise, the two Clans would certainly start a war.

On top of that, given that the Bone Devouring Clan managed to capture Bao Qi and force Sha Ya to retreat, they must have sent out many Masters, and the Shaman Niu Clan definitely stood no chance of winning.

“They were all taken to the Bone Devouring Clan’s camp, and I don’t know what their situation is now.” Sha Ya finished worriedly and quietly observed Yang Kai’s reaction, “Sir, are we going to save them?”

Yang Kai answered, “Of course, it is my Shaman Niu Clan that we’re talking about.”

“But I…” Sha Ya muttered.

“You don’t need to show up. Just stay still.” While speaking, Yang Kai reached out his hand and grabbed her. Sha Ya did not resist and was directly thrown into the Sealed World Bead.

Yang Kai turned around and looked in the other direction.

He did not require Sha Ya for guidance, because he could feel Bao Qi’s presence thanks to the Soul Imprint in the latter’s mind, which resulted in a connection that could not be easily cut off.

Without delay, Yang Kai rushed off at full speed.

He was not sure whether or not it was fate that the twenty thousand people of his Shaman Niu Clan fell into the hands of the Bone Devouring Clan, but regardless he was quite worried. The Bone Devouring Clan was originally different from other Ancient Barbarian Clans, and if not for it being protected by a Shaman Saint, it would have been wiped out by the other Ancient Barbarians long ago. Furthermore, Yang Kai had some conflict with the Bone Devouring Clan, so this alone was enough for Yang Kai to worry about the safety of his twenty thousand subordinates.

The Bone Devouring Clan never forgave and always sought revenge for the slightest grievance. Back then, a Shaman Chi escaped after being injured by Yang Kai, so a grudge had already been formed between them. If it were not due to the invasion of the Demon Clan, the Bone Devouring Clan would certainly have tried to take revenge against Yang Kai already.
