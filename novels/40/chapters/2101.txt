“Stone... Stone Giant?”

After a long while, Hua Qing Si finally managed to utter those few words with great difficulty.

This sight was too incredulous. It was a giant silhouette with a height rivalling a dozen storey building, yet he was endowed with a good figure of clearly defined muscles, and his simple-looking head had a pair of bright and intelligent-looking eyes, unbefitting his rough look.

His every move and action seemed able to shake the whole world!

He seemed like one of the Giant Mountain Domain foretold in ancient legends, and his presence alone had shaken up Hua Qing Si.

“A Stone Giant? Hehe, you can call me so,” The Embodiment let out a chuckle, a deafening chuckle despite trying his best to lower his voice.

“Are you alive? Are you self-conscious?” Hua Qing Si asked in surprise. She was no ordinary woman and was from the Divine Star palace. She had come in touch with many secrets unbeknown to people, thus she quickly got over her shock and came back to her senses. But despite this, she couldn’t associate this being with any creature in existence after racking her brains for so long.

“Did you assume I was dead?” the Embodiment looked in mockery at Hua Qing Si.

Hua Qing Si’s pretty face got flushed and she laughed out of delight. She asked back, “Then this means I’m alive, too... By the way, you said that he has brought me here. Where are we?”

The Embodiment quietened for a while, then squinted his eyes and asked, “Are you sure you want to know?”

Hua Qing Si furrowed her brows and unease welled up in her heart, as if she was already aware she wouldn’t end up anywhere good for her, but she still couldn’t curb her curiosity and she revealed a longing look.

“Fine, there is no harm in telling you. In any case, since he has already brought you here rather than killing you, you won’t ever get to leave again.”

Upon hearing him, Hua Qing Si’s pretty face darkened and she realized that her worries turned out to be true. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“This is a Small Sealed World, the Emperor Artifact Sealed World Bead’s Sealed World.”

“An Emperor Artifact? The Sealed World Bead?” Hua Qing Si cried out in alarm and she said in surprise, “Are you implying that it has formed a world, and it’s a treasure equal to our Star Soul Palace’s Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda?

“More or less,” the Embodiment nodded. Seeming tired from speaking so much, it sat down on the ground cross-legged, and said while looking at Hua Qing Si, “But, comparatively speaking, each of them has its pros and cons. The Star Soul Palace’s disciples can enter the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda for practice, and it also has many marvellous functions, while the Sealed World Bead is quite different. First, it was refined from an almighty being’s body and it’s pretty small, which makes it easy to carry around. Is that understandable?”

Hua Qing Si nodded numbly. As a member of the Star Soul Palace, she had obviously discerned and understood the Embodiment’s unspoken implication.

The Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda was the Star Soul Palace’s best treasure, and it was its foundation, mainly because numerous disciples could train in it, make advancements, study World Principles, and absorb remnant World Principles’ power.

This was the best Emperor Artifact in the whole Star Boundary!

As for the Sealed World Bead, it was obviously equal to the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, and even though people couldn’t train and get various benefits in it, it was still more practical than the latter.

This was a priceless treasure, yet it was in the hand of a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator.

It wouldn’t be easy even for an Emperor Realm Master to get an Emperor Artifact, and even such experts couldn’t easily craft an Emperor Artifact. Every Emperor Artifact’s birth was preceded by innumerable years gathering of resources, as well as many experts’ blood and sweat.

An Emperor Artifact was a lot more precious than a Dao Source Grade artifact, yet this said treasure was in the hand of a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, and it wasn’t even an ordinary Emperor Artifact, but rather one equal to the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda.

If news spread out, then the whole Star Boundary’s experts would go into an uproar and hunt down Yang Kai to snatch his treasure.

“Can you just forget I heard this secret...” The corners of Hua Qing Si’s mouth twitched.

She had already been placed by Yang Kai into the Sealed World Bead, and after learning such a secret, it was impossible for anyone to let her leave. In other words, she would be imprisoned by Yang Kai for a lifetime!

She had been still rejoicing over her survival, yet she got upset by this news.

“Hehehe...” The Embodiment laughed heartily, “Your fate was doomed from the moment you got sent here.”

Having said this much, the Embodiment’s voice turned gloomy. He said, “He hasn’t killed you only because you saved his life once, but his current state is far from good and he can’t control his murderous impulses, this is why he was forced to opt for this solution.”

“Is that true?”

“Actually, you still have a chance to leave this land.”

“What’s it?” Hua Qing Si rejoiced and questioned him right away.

“Die... Or vow loyalty to my main body and offer him your Soul Imprint.”

Hua Qing Si’s pretty face fell and she shouted, “That is out of the question!”

“Nothing in the world is out of the question. Young girl, you don’t have to be so dead-set against it! Do you really want to spend the rest of your life here?” The Embodiment questioned her.

Hua Qing Si got lost in her thoughts and her inner struggle was apparent on her face, but she suddenly got over it and said, “That little bastard can’t even protect himself now, let’s leave this until he overcomes his crisis.”

The Embodiment nodded and said, “You’re right, you should discuss it with him, I have only offered a suggestion.”

Hua Qing Si’s expression suddenly changed and she said, “By the way, why are you here?” As she spoke, she suddenly thought of something and said excitedly, “Were you thrown here by him, too? Did he force you to offer him your Soul Imprint?”

Hua Qing Si seemed excited, as if she had suddenly found a fellow sufferer.

The Embodiment wore a strange look on his face and mumbled, “I have already been imprisoned by him for more than a million years...”

“He’s really scum,” Hua Qing Si said through gnashed teeth, but she suddenly noticed a weird detail and looked at the Embodiment suspiciously. She said, “How old is he? How come it’s a million years?”

The Embodiment scratched his face with his large and thick finger and said, “Don’t pay heed to those insignificant details. He’s already in trouble. Have a look at those people, do you know them?”

As the Embodiment spoke, he waved his hand.

In the empty space between him and Hua Qing Si, ripples visible to the naked eye appeared and were followed by a strange screen, which appeared out of nowhere.

Hua Qing Si gazed over there and said in wonder, “This is...”

Hua Qing Si had noticed that the scene displayed in the sky was Yang Kai’s current location. He had been engulfed by thick black Qi, and only his eyes still shone with a golden, yet evil radiance.

In his vicinity, three people were surrounding him in a triangular formation.

Those three people were all composed and had outstanding bearings.

The middle-aged man in the left was clad in plain hemp clothing, which despite not looking bright and new, was tidy and neat, while he was also endowed with a pair of bright and shining eyes.

The one on the right side was a short old man with white hair and a beard, yet still rosy face. He observed Yang Kai with furrowed brows and his apprehension was apparent on his face.

As for the one in the middle, it was a dignified and cold-looking pretty woman with an icy expression plastered on her pretty face. She was clad in a white dress, which gave her a special mature charm.

After Hua Qing Si had been thrown into the Sealed World Bead by Yang Kai, those three people appeared suddenly out of nowhere and surrounded him.

Everyone was a famous Emperor Realm Master of the Southern Territory and Yang Kai had seen all of them once.

“Those are several Great Forces’ big shots.” Hua Qing Si cast a glance at them and recognized them right away.

“Can you elaborate further?” The Embodiment next to her said.

“The one on the left is the Heavenly Martial Holy Land’s Senior Chen, Chen Wen Hao. As for the one on the right side, it’s the Orthodoxy Temple’s Elder Feng, Feng Ming, and the last one is the Azure Sun Temple Senior Gao, Gao Xue Ting.”

“It’s unexpectedly those people.” The Embodiment came to a realization.

More than a year ago, those three people had once dropped by Maplewood City to pursue a Luan Feng’s trails in Clear Jade Mountain. Later on, the Star Soul Palace’s Xiao Yu Yang had also come and cast a magical art to create a long-distance portal to the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda to take the city’s cultivators into it.

At that time, Yang Kai had also seen those outstanding people, and since Yang Kai knew them, then the Embodiment had also heard about them.

Upon hearing their status from Hua Qing Si, a worried look appeared on the Embodiment’s face.

Even though in his current state, Yang Kai was endowed with great and unstoppable power, he was facing three Emperor Realm Masters from outstanding backgrounds, and he might not be a match for them.

Moreover, the more Yang Kai maintained his current state, the worse his situation. If he got held up by those people, then his mind might end up corrupted by the Demon Spirit, and he would then turn into a real demon.

“There is still hope left!” Hua Qing Si didn’t notice the Embodiment’s worries and shouted in delight. She still didn’t forget to shout at the Embodiment. She said, “Big Stone, once that little bastard gets subdued by those three seniors, we’ll get to leave.”

The Embodiment nodded repeatedly, wearing the same indifferent look as usual.

In the outside world, Chen Wen Hao and others stood in silence and didn’t make a move.

They came here because someone had used Maplewood City’s Teleportation Array to leave and notify them.

The three Great Forces had heard that an Ancient Great Demon’s seal got damaged and pure Demon Qi leaked out, which didn’t leave a single living soul in Maplewood City’s vicinity. Thus they didn’t take it lightly and dispatched Emperor Realm Masters to investigate its ins and outs.

Chen Wen Hao and the others, who had once visited Maplewood City a year ago, were obviously their best choice, and they had also undertaken this task willingly.

They had all hurried up from their sects and used countless Space Arrays on the way to reach Maplewood City in the shortest time possible.

When they had reached Maplewood City, the Demon Qi had already started dispersing and the Demonic Beings were coming back to their senses.

They were all bewildered and they followed the trails to get into this event’s source, and they ended up intercepting Yang Kai’s way here.

At this moment, they were all confused and puzzled!

A Luan Feng had first emerged in the little Maplewood City only to be followed by an Ancient Great Demon’s seal a year later, as if any major event was bound to happen in this little city, and they all found it incredulous.

Opposite them, Yang Kai’s facial features were indistinct and they couldn’t discern his identity prior to his transformation, while the pure Demon Qi engulfing him gave them a stifling feeling, as if this Demon Qi could pose a deadly threat to Emperor Realm Masters.
