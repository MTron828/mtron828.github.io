In the peaceful and quiet world, Sha Ya flew forward with a frown. The seemingly fatal stab wound on her chest had already disappeared without a trace, but there were still some bloodstains on her clothes.

The Demon Race’s durability had always been exceptionally strong, especially for Masters like Sha Ya. Her statement of ‘as long as the Demon Heart remains, the Demon Race will not die’ was no joke.

However, she had now been stuck in this strange world for days.

There were no Sun, Moon, or Stars here, but there was sufficient light, and the environment was also exceptionally beautiful with incredibly rich World Energy.

However, this did not make her feel better. After she was attacked from behind by that despicable fellow named Shaman Niu a few days ago, she inexplicably found herself in this beautiful world filled with the songs of birds and the scent of flowers.

Sha Ya thought she had fallen unconscious and was dreaming.

But the wound on her chest and the pain it brought her made her realize that this was reality.

[What is this place? How did I come here?] Sha Ya was puzzled and found no clues even after careful investigation, so she could only keep moving forward in hopes of finding a way out.

Despite her strength as a Demon King though, she still could not find an exit after days of searching.

This world was like an endless cage, and she was a beast trapped inside. No matter how hard she tried, she had no way to escape from this place.

Sha Ya was in an extremely bad mood now, and every time she thought of the bastard who stabbed her in the back, she would grind her teeth in fury.

She could not understand how Shaman Niu could betray her after drinking her Demon Heart Blood, and how she could not even perceive his treacherous thoughts.

Going by the standards of the Demon Clan, the aura of this Shaman Niu was equivalent to Demon Great General, a whole Great Realm lower than her, a Demon King, so how was it possible for him to resist her Demon Heart Blood?

There were too many things she could not understand! She found that she had suffered losses everywhere ever since she met that damnable fellow named Shaman Niu a few days ago, and now, she did not even know where she was.

Nevertheless, she had to report information about Shaman Niu no matter what. This little bastard was so tricky that even she had suffered a huge loss at his hand, so the other Demon Kings needed to be warned to remain extremely cautious if they ever encountered him.

While thinking so, Sha Ya came to a halt and frowned slightly.

She suddenly felt like she was being watched. This had never happened in the last few days, making it seem like she was the only sentient being in this world.

Sha Ya furrowed her delicate brow before sweeping her eyes around doubtfully. The next moment though, anger and hatred erupted from her beautiful eyes as she charged at a figure quietly hovering in mid-air to her left, bellowing madly through gritted teeth, “Shaman Niu!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Yang Kai smiled back at her in a friendly manner and called out in a cheerful voice, “Good morning, Madam Demon King.”

“Good morning my foot!” Sha Ya lost her temper and could not help cursing. She did not even know if it was morning or night in this damned place where there was no Sun or Moon. Of course, this was not the point. The point was that she was particularly triggered upon seeing her mortal enemy.

Although her wound had healed, Sha Ya could still clearly feel the aching pain in her Demon Heart at the sight of Shaman Niu. The previous stab wound seemed to have torn open again, causing her extreme pain.

Yang Kai did not care much about her rudeness and just returned a smile to her, “It seems that I guessed correctly. Even if I really destroy your Demon Heart, you won’t die. Are all Demons so difficult to kill?”

Sha Ya’s face turned cold and indifferent, not answering his question and instead asking, “What is this place? What do you want, bringing me here?”

“This place…” Yang Kai looked up slightly, his gaze seemingly penetrating through the void, as if he could see the ends of the world before he turned back and opened his arms, “This is my world. Here, I control everything!”

Sha Ya chuckled, thinking that Yang Kai was talking nonsense. [How dare a trivial Demon Great General weakling claim to control a world? Even Sir Demon Saints don’t have such ability.]

“As for why I brought you here,” Yang Kai smiled gently, “Of course, it’s to teach you a lesson.”

“Teach me a lesson?” Sha Ya was stunned before she giggled pleasantly, “Interesting. This is the first time I’ve heard someone saying that to me.”

She had always been the one to say such words to others, so it was a new and refreshing experience to be in the opposite position for the first time.

“You think I’m joking?” Yang Kai looked at her seriously.

Sha Ya pursed her lips, “I just think you are too free and have nothing else to do.”

Yang Kai shook his head lightly, “You should be glad that you are still valuable in my eyes, otherwise you’d be a corpse already.”

“Oh?” Sha Ya stroked her hair coquettishly, leisurely displaying her charms as she looked at Yang Kai with her mesmerizing eyes and asked, “I wonder what value you think I have?”

“Definitely not the kind of value you’re thinking of,” Yang Kai curled his lip. “I already told you, I’m not interested in used goods, especially a piece of rotten meat like you that wild dogs would not even want to sniff.”

The flattery on Sha Ya’s face retracted in an instant and was replaced by a bone-chilling cold.

Yang Kai’s insults obviously touched her nerves and she found them wholly unacceptable.

Sha Ya opened her mouth and released a terrifying scream, causing an incomparably pure Spiritual Energy to ripple out violently, sending a huge impact rushing into Yang Kai’s mind, while a soft whip suddenly appeared in her hand and she lashed towards him.

Her movements seemed gentle, but they actually contained an incredible force.

The attack of an angered Demon King was truly extraordinary, even causing the surrounding World Energy to ripple.

Yang Kai, however, just stood still in place with a cynical smile on his face. Lifting his hand, he made a flicking motion with his thumb and middle finger, as if he were flicking away a mosquito.

This casual act caused Sha Ya to suffer a huge injury. Her lower abdomen caved in visibly as she was sent flying by a huge force, blood spewing from her mouth as she tumbled through the air uncontrollably.

It took Sha Ya quite some effort to stabilize herself, but when she did, the calm and composed look on her face had completely disappeared. Her eyes were now filled with panic as she stared at Yang Kai in shock, her beautiful eyes quivering violently.

[How is that possible?] Just now, she was certain this bastard did not use any strength at all, but she was still sent flying with just a simple flick of his fingers. The force was also just right, enough to cause her pain and draw blood, but not damage her foundation.

Did he have such a powerful ability?

That should be impossible!

Although she only fought Shaman Niu once, Sha Ya knew his capabilities. He was undoubtedly strong, but his strength still had a limit.

The scene just now befuddled her completely. Even the Demon Saint would not be able to achieve such a feat, so how was it possible for this foreign race Demon Great General?

The blow that Sha Ya just received was completely beyond her ability to understand.

Forcing herself to calm down, she examined Yang Kai again, looking for clues that could answer her doubts.

Yang Kai flicked his finger again at that moment, and Sha Ya’s face changed drastically. Completely by reflex, she pushed her Demon Qi madly, shielding herself from all angles.

But the next moment, she was still hurled back, spinning in the air as if she was hit by a falling star. The huge force of the impact caused her to be completely unable to stabilize herself.

Sha Ya gradually felt that the force weakened after she tumbled backwards for some distance, and after a huge effort, she managed to stop and stand firm once more. Hot, sweet liquid filled her mouth and dripped from her nose that she only recognized as blood when she reached out to touch it.

Her forehead was also so numb that she could barely feel her head, as if her skull had been bashed in.

When she looked up again, the foreigner in front of her had disappeared.

Before she could relax though, a terrifying voice came from right behind her, “I already said, I control this world! Even if your Great Demon God came here, he would have to kneel down to me!”

Sha Ya pursed her lips and wanted to refute, but she did not know what to say.

She was horror-struck by his two attacks. She thought that with her personal strength, Shaman Niu would not be her opponent, but now it seemed to be the opposite. She was no match to him, unable to even comprehend how he was attacking her much less react or resist his abilities.

Don’t fight the enemy, there’s no way to win! That was the conclusion she quickly reached in her heart.

The only choice she had now was to escape.

Thinking so, Sha Ya did not hesitate anymore. Without saying a word, she gathered whatever strength she had left and shot off in no particular direction, disappearing over the horizon in the blink of an eye.

It was only after Sha Ya could not sense Shaman Niu’s aura with her Divine Sense anymore that she relaxed, thinking that she had escaped death.

As a Demon King, there were only a few things or people in the world that she feared. Even facing the Demon Saints, she would only show sufficient respect and caution.

But Shaman Niu truly terrified her, with a type of fear that she had never experienced before in her life.

Although the Demon Saints were strong, Sha Ya knew their strength and how strong they could be. But there seemed to be no limit to Shaman Niu’s strength.

His wild words echoed in her ears again at that moment, and Sha Ya could not help wondering, [Is he really able to control this world?]

[How is that possible? Who can control a world?]

Sha Ya, who was escaping, suddenly widened her eyes and stared ahead of herself in complete shock. The very figure that frightened her so greatly was standing there quietly in the void, an unreadable grin on his face. When he saw her fleeing, he did not show any intention to stop her, simply folding his hands behind his back and enjoying the show.

[Damn!]

[I’m sure I didn’t feel any fluctuation of power, so how did he appear in front of me?]

Startled, Sha Ya hurriedly stopped, turned around and fled in the opposite direction.

After a stick of incense worth of time though, a scene that made Sha Ya despair appeared again.

Shaman Niu stood in front of her again, in the exact same posture, as if he had never moved, and when Sha Ya looked at the scenery around herself… It all looked oddly familiar.

There were bloodstains on the ground nearby.

It was the blood she coughed up earlier.

[Why did I come back to the same place? I escaped in a straight line, so how did I end up back here?]

The foreign race bastard smiled like a great devil at her, causing Sha Ya, a Demon King, to shudder uncontrollably. Her blood began to run cold as her face paled. Immediately, she turned around and ran away again, not even having the courage to face this strange enigma.
