Li Jiao did not answer. It was as if he had not heard what Lady Hong said. His expression kept changing constantly, and his gaze seemed conflicted.

Lady Hong glanced at him, walked over, and straightened his clothes, then said gently, “I remember what you once said to me years ago, Palace Master.”

“What?” Li Jiao subconsciously asked.

“You told me that the greatest wish in your life was to set foot on Dragon Island. You wanted to see the place where your bloodline originated from. You said that if you could just take a single look, you would be able to die without regrets.”

“Hong’er, you…” Li Jiao turned to look at her in shock. He did not expect her to recall something he mentioned so many years ago while drunk. Moreover, she remembered it so clearly.

“Go, I will wait for you.” She looked at him with eyes that were full of reluctance, but her expression was full of smiles.

The struggle in his eyes became more apparent and all of a sudden, he stretched out his arms, wrapping them around Lady Hong’s waist and back as he lowered his head and kissed her red lips.

“Mmph…” She moaned and slowly closed her beautiful eyes, her long eyelashes fluttering slightly.

He kissed her deeply and held her tightly as if trying to merge her alluring body with his so that they would never separate again. A moment later, he parted his lips from hers, turned around, and spoke in a low voice, “If I don’t return … You… should remarry as soon as possible.”

After saying that, he rushed straight into the sky and chased in the direction Yang Kai had left just now. His aura was so imposing that even tens of thousands of people couldn’t stop him!

Staring in the direction Li Jiao was leaving with teary eyes, Lady Hong cupped her hands around her mouth and shouted, “Hong’er will wait for you to return! If you don’t return, I will go to the underworld to find you!”

Li Jiao paused for a moment, but after a brief hesitation, he sped up and disappeared from Lady Hong’s field of vision.

…..

Yang Kai set off on his journey alone. His entire mind was filled with thoughts of how to enter Dragon Island.

Dragon Island was an extremely mysterious place. Although it was famous and had many rumours about it concerning the Dragon Clan living there, practically no one knew where it was located. All that was known about Dragon Island was that it was located somewhere on the East Sea in the Eastern Territory. Needless to say, Yang Kai was clueless as to where it was actually located.

He came to Fire Dragon Palace to ask Li Jiao, hoping that he might get lucky. Since Li Jiao was a Dragonborn and a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master at that, Yang Kai thought he might know something about Dragon Island’s location.

However, Yang Kai was greatly disappointed after asking. [If Li Jiao doesn’t know, then I have to think of another way. Fortunately, I have another plan, so I’m not totally unprepared.]

Just as he was considering his options, his brow furrowed slightly and he turned to look back. A figure was chasing after him at a high speed. Before that person came closer, Yang Kai had already detected that person’s familiar aura with his Divine Sense and he frowned even deeper, a strange look appearing on his face as he waited in place for that person to arrive.

A moment later, Li Jiao appeared in front of Yang Kai with a complicated expression.

Yang Kai scoffed, “Why did you chase after me, Brother Li?”

“Are you really going to Dragon Island?” Li Jiao scowled and answered Yang Kai’s question with a question of his own.

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded gently.

“For Young Lady Qing?”

“Yes.” He nodded again.

Li Jiao smiled bitterly and cupped his fists, “Palace Master Yang, this Li deeply admires your courage.”

“Enough with the nonsense. Why did you chase after me?” Yang Kai looked at Li Jiao curiously.

Li Jiao scratched his face and apologetically stated, “I came because I wanted to help you, Palace Master Yang.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai lifted his eyebrows slightly.

Li Jiao continued, “I know the approximate location of Dragon Island…” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Hmm?” Yang Kai lowered his eyes.

Li Jiao observed Yang Kai’s expression. [This is bad. I vehemently denied knowing anything just now, yet now, I am admitting that I lied. My actions might have angered this guy…] Thus, he hurriedly explained, “I honestly only know the approximate location. I don’t know exactly where it is, so I didn’t dare to mention it before. I was worried I might cause trouble for you, Palace Master Yang.”

“Is that so?” Yang Kai walked over with a smile.

Li Jiao paled in response. [I’ve made this walking disaster mad after all! I shouldn’t have chased after him… Wasn’t living peacefully with Hong’er in Fire Dragon Palace nice? Why did I have to invite trouble to myself? Now, I’m riding on a mad tiger and I don’t even know why!]

He watched as Yang Kai walked over to him and raised a hand, causing Li Jiao’s heart to leap into his throat. [It’s impossible to win against him in a fight. Even if I resist, I’ll still end up being crushed. I might as well close my eyes and get this embarrassment over with!]

He believed that Yang Kai wouldn’t kill him. At most, he would be beaten up to allow Yang Kai to vent his anger.

*Pa…*

Li Jiao shuddered, but the attack he imagined did not come. Rather, he only felt an arm being placed on his shoulders.

Opening his eyes, Li Jiao saw Yang Kai had put his arm around his shoulders and was actually laughing in delight, “Hahaha… I knew you’d have a way, Brother Li! As expected, I didn’t come to the wrong person. Good, good! Let’s barge into Dragon Island and see what kind of lion’s den it is!”

Li Jiao wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, “I’m just going to take a look.”

“Rest assured; with me around, you won’t suffer any losses.”

The corners of Li Jiao’s mouth twitched, “Then, I’ll have to depend on your protection, Palace Master Yang.”

He did not believe those words. [Yang Kai might be powerful, but once we enter Dragon Island, even he will be forced to crawl on all fours in that damn place. What kind of waves can I expect him to make?]

“Leave it to me. This matter cannot be delayed any longer; let’s set off now.” While speaking, Yang Kai summoned the Flowing Clouds Shuttle. The two of them boarded, then the shuttle turned into a stream of light and left this place at an even faster speed.

Inside the Flowing Clouds Shuttle, Li Jiao hesitated for a long time before he cautiously said, “Palace Master Yang, I’m doing you another favour, so about the debt…”

“Debts are debts and favours are favours. The debt you owe me and the favour I owe you are two different things altogether. How can we confuse them together?”

Li Jiao sighed, he didn’t even know whether he would return from this trip alive, so why was he worried about mere Source Crystals now? He should just consider it a win as long as he returned alive.

“Palace Master Yang, how were you planning to enter Dragon Island if I had not come? Did Young Lady Qing tell you anything about Dragon Island’s location before she left?”

“Nope.” Yang Kai shook his head. He answered the question while controlling the Flowing Clouds Shuttle, “I was planning to go to Spirit Beast Island and ask Martial Beast Great Emperor for directions. The location of Dragon Island is hidden, but I’m sure Martial Beast Great Emperor knows where it is.”

“Spirit Beast Island?!” Li Jiao was absolutely shocked as he asked in horror, “Palace Master Yang, are you acquainted with Martial Beast Great Emperor?

“Nope!”

Li Jiao was instantly dumbfounded, “If you are not acquainted with Martial Beast Great Emperor, how were you planning on asking him for directions?”

“I have my ways,” Yang Kai replied nonchalantly. He might not be acquainted with Martial Beast Great Emperor, but he was acquainted with Martial Beast Great Emperor’s daughter! He had not seen Mo Xiao Qi since they separated after the Shattered Star Sea closed, which was some time ago, so he wondered how that silly little girl was doing now.

Spirit Beast Island might be hard to find, but at the very least, it wasn’t as secretive as Dragon Island. His initial plan was to go to Spirit Beast Island first and head to Dragon Island after that. The two Great Islands were both located in the East Sea, so even if there was some distance between them, they shouldn’t be that far apart from each other. As long as Mo Xiao Qi gave him directions, wouldn’t finding Dragon Island be a simple matter?

However, Yang Kai’s casual answer shocked Li Jiao so much that he began to sweat profusely and wonder, [Just who on Earth is Palace Master Yang!?]

He had not known Yang Kai for long, but their relationship wasn’t short either; however, the more Li Jiao learned about Yang Kai, the more terrifying this youth became. [It’s bad enough that his relationship with Dragon Island is ambiguous, and just recently, I found out that he has a very close relationship with the Disciple of Iron Blood Great Emperor, but now he is also connected to Spirit Beast Island?!]

Li Jiao was utterly confused. He found that it was getting harder and harder for him to figure Yang Kai out. After pondering for a moment, he asked, “Palace Master Yang, if… I’m just saying; if we really manage to enter Dragon Island… No matter what you want to do on that island, never mention your relationship with Spirit Beast Island.”

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai looked at Li Jiao in astonishment.

Li Jiao explained, “Dragon Island and Spirit Beast Island… Are as incompatible as fire and water with each other.”

Yang Kai’s mouth was agape with shock as he exclaimed in shock, “Where did you hear that from?”

He had never heard of such a thing before; thus, his first reaction upon hearing what Li Jiao said was disbelief. The two Great Spirit Islands were considered to be among the top existences across the entire Star Boundary. If they were in conflict with each other, everyone would have known about it, so how was it possible he had not even heard a rumour to that effect?

Li Jiao wiped his sweat and continued, “This isn’t mere gossip, Palace Master Yang. You probably don’t know because you are too young. Besides, it has not been long since you became an Emperor Realm Master. It’s only natural that you don’t know many of the secrets between the Star Boundary’s top forces. In time you surely would have come to learn about it.”

Yang Kai frowned, “The two forces are at odds with each other? Is it that serious?”

Li Jiao solemnly replied, “More or less.”

“Why?” Yang Kai suddenly became interested. A secret like that wasn’t something ordinary people had the chance to hear about. Li Jiao could understand; it was most probably because Yang Kai had the Dragon Clan’s blood in him.

Li Jiao explained, “Among the ten Great Emperors, Martial Beast Great Emperor’s Dao is that of Beast Taming. There are countless different exotic beasts on Spirit Beast Island and I’ve even heard there are one or two Divine Spirits there. Cultivating such a Dao naturally drove Martial Beast Great Emperor to want to control the most powerful Monster Beasts in the world. Think about it; what is the most powerful Monster Beast in the world?”

Yang Kai widened his eyes, “The Dragon Clan!”

Li Jiao slapped his thigh and said, “Exactly! The Dragon Clan claims to be the head of the myriad spirits, the leaders of the Divine Spirits, but when it comes down to it, they are still Monster Beasts. On the other hand, Martial Beast Great Emperor’s greatest dream is to control the Dragon Clan. Can he really have a good relationship with the Dragon Clan? You can even say that the reason why Spirit Beast Island is located in the Eastern Territory is that Martial Beast Great Emperor wanted to stay close to the Dragon Clan.”

“Are you serious?”

“Of course!” Li Jiao looked solemn, “Not many people know about this, but there is no impenetrable wall in the world.”

“This news is absolutely shocking.” Yang Kai looked lost. [Martial Beast Great Emperor wants to control the Dragons, but the Dragon Clan’s pride would never allow such a thing. Putting it that way, it’s no surprise they have a poor relationship with each other.]

Li Jiao continued, “Recently, the relationship between Martial Beast Great Emperor and Dragon Island deteriorated drastically and it is said that the Great Emperor caused a ruckus on Dragon Island some twenty years or so ago.” Then, Li Jiao added, “Of course, nobody knows if this information is real or fake. The only thing we can be certain about is that Martial Beast Great Emperor and the Dragon Clan are on bad terms with each other.”

Yang Kai nodded, “I understand. If we really enter Dragon Island, I will not mention Martial Beast Great Emperor.”

“That would be for the best.” Li Jiao was relieved.

“By the way, why did you chase after me?” Yang Kai tilted his head to look at Li Jiao and smilingly added, “It’s not like I forced you this time.”

Li Jiao smiled wryly and answered, “Everyone has something they yearn for in their heart. Dragon Island… To visit that place has always been my deepest desire.”

Those words sounded sorrowful, but Yang Kai understood what Li Jiao was trying to express. Stretching out his hand, he patted Li Jiao on the shoulder and said, “Rest assured. We will definitely reach that place, and if you are lucky, you might even be able to improve your bloodline”

Li Jiao burst into laughter, “I’m not aiming for such heights. This Li will be happy enough just to get to see Dragon Island.”
