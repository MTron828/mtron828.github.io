At a certain moment, the middle-aged man suddenly turned around and stared into the distance with bulged eyes, as if he just noticed something astonishing, his anger quickly calming and being replaced with trembles of excitement.

“Hahahaha!” He burst into laughter, “The seed is ripe! Finally, the seed is ripe! Who!? Who is it!?”

He yelled like a madman as he flailed about in uncontrollable excitement. Soon, he summoned a ship like artifact and flew off towards the depths of the Shattered Star Sea. If one were to observe from the outside, one would notice that he was flying towards the Source Sea.

…..

Time continued to pass.

Although Yang Kai left a portion of his attention to monitor his surroundings and planned to put away the Embodiment and Sealed World Bead as soon as he found someone approaching him, his rate of absorption and refinement of Source Strength was not delayed at all.

The Sealed World Bead and Embodiment were also absorbing Source Strength more and more furiously, to the extent that it even frightened Yang Kai.

One day, two days, five days, ten days…

The size of the Source Sea had been greatly reduced from its original size. Not only that, the Source Strength in the remaining Source Sea was countless times thinner than it had been at the beginning.

Now, not just the cultivators at the edge of the Source Sea realized this problem, even the cultivators in the deeper parts found something was wrong.

In the deepest part of the Source Sea, in the territories occupied by Emperor Realm Masters, the red-haired young man who attacked Yang Kai first suddenly frowned and looked up into the sky at a person who was standing there staring at him coldly.

The red-haired young man grinned and looked back at the person dauntlessly.

“Is this one of your tricks?” The visitor asked flatly after examining the red-haired young man for a while.

The red-haired young man pondered for a while and replied, “I, too, want to know who is playing tricks!”

Both of them exchanged glares before simultaneously turning their eyes in the same direction.

The red-haired young man continued, “Source Strength seems to be continuously flowing towards there.”

The visitor agreed with a nod and responded solemnly, “That direction is where Yao Si is!”

“Yao Si!” The red-haired young man narrowed his eyes after hearing this name and a trace of fear flashed across his face, as if this Yao Si had an enormous background that even he, an Emperor Realm Master, dared not take lightly.

“Are you going to take a look?” The visitor asked.

The red-haired young man smiled with contempt, “So, this is the reason that you came for me. Why are the cultivators of the Southern Territory all cowards?”

The visitor snorted faintly without denying, “Yao Si is the descendant of a Great Emperor after all!”

The red-haired young man sneered, “Doesn’t the Southern Territory also have a descendant of a Great Emperor here? Why didn’t you find her instead of this Young Master?”

The visitor snorted, “She hasn’t broken through to the Emperor Realm yet, it’s useless to look for her. If you’re scared, I’ll check the situation alone.”

“Who said I’m scared?!” The red-haired young man snarled and stood up in anger before continuing fiercely, “I don’t care if it’s a descendant of a Great Emperor, whoever dares to snatch Source Strength from this Young Master will have to spit it out for me.”

He immediately flew straight in the direction of Yao Si, followed by the other newcomer hurriedly.

After a moment, the two discovered an abnormal situation somewhere not too far away; three newly promoted Emperor Realm Masters were gathered on a single island that covered a vast area, and Yao Si, who they were looking for, was among them.

Standing in front of these three Emperors was surprisingly a Third-Order Dao Source Realm young man.

The pair had no idea what these four people were doing at the moment, as they were just staring at each other without taking any action. What amazed them the most was that the young man with only a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation was actually facing three Emperors without the slightest fear on his face.

“It’s him!”

The red-haired young man could not help shouting.

The other person asked in astonishment, “Do you know him?”

The red-haired young man’s face darkened as he replied, “That guy passed by where this Young Master was half a month ago and took a blow from me without receiving any damage.”

Hearing this, the face of the other person changed slightly, as if it was hard for him to believe. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The red-haired young man continued, “This Young Master did not hold back his strength at that time. This guy is quite interesting, if he can break through to the Emperor Realm one day, his future will surely be limitless. I don’t know where he is from, but he’s definitely not from my Eastern Territory.”

The other person did not give any response, being overwhelmed in shock and unable to calm down in a short time, his eyes fixing on the Dao Source Realm cultivator.

“Let’s go down and take a look,” the red-haired young man proposed and flew towards the island first.

On the island, Yang Kai looked displeased.

Previously, while he was enjoying absorbing the Source Strength here, he suddenly felt that someone was approaching him and hurriedly put away the Sealed World Bead and the Embodiment. Before he could recover from the fluster, three Emperor Realm Masters already arrived in front of him, all of them glaring at him with a gloomy face, as if they were about to eat him.

These three Emperors had undoubtedly just broken through in the Shattered Star Sea as their auras were still a bit unstable; however, they were still Emperors in the end, each one extremely powerful.

Yang Kai could guess the reason these three were here. They were obviously alarmed by the tremendous amount of Source Strength that was flowing towards and disappearing here.

This was inevitable though. Yang Kai did not expect that the Sealed World Bead and the Embodiment would raise such a fuss. Them being able to continue for half a month was already beyond his expectations.

Over the past half a month, whether it was the Embodiment, the Sealed World Bead, or Yang Kai himself, they had received indescribable benefits.

The total amount of Source Strength absorbed by the cultivators in the entire Source Sea might not be as much as Yang Kai had absorbed.

And at this moment, the Source Strength contained in Source Sea had noticeably tinned.

Another pair of people flew over, they landed together with the other Emperors.

Yang Kai glanced at these newcomers and his eyes instantly lit up as he greeted one of them, “Hey, Brother Wu Chang, long time no see.”

Of the red-haired young man, Yang Kai still had some impression; after all, half a month ago, he was once attacked by this red-haired young man who seemed to be named Chi Gui! As for the man who followed Chi Gui here, it was actually Wu Chang of Heavenly Martial Holy Land, one of the top rising stars in the Southern Territory.

It was not a surprise to Yang Kai that Wu Chang had broken through to the Emperor Realm, but meeting him here was a bit of a shock.

When Chi Gui heard this, he immediately turned to Wu Chang and asked, “You know this little brat?”

“I don’t know him, I have never seen him before, don’t ask me!” Wu Chang answered with a cold face.

Although he did not have any grudges with Yang Kai, they were not friends either. At this point, Yang Kai seemed to have agitated everyone and Wu Chang did not want to get caught in the crossfire.

Yang Kai was exasperated, “Why is Brother Wu Chang acting so heartless? Remember how we worked so well together, resulting in a happy ending in the Four Seasons Realm for both of us? Even if Brother Wu Chang doesn’t miss our old memories, you don’t need to be so cold to me!”

Wu Chang snapped back indignantly, “What cooperation? It was nothing more than a trade between you and me. Stop exaggerating.”

Yang Kai grinned, “Our trade was a very important cooperation though. Didn’t Brother Wu Chang benefit greatly from it? Shouldn’t you give me some credit for you being able to break through to the Emperor Realm so quickly? Even Xia Sheng is still working hard on making a breakthrough now.”

He looked at Wu Chang with a meaningful grin and twinkle in his eyes.

Wu Chang naturally knew that Yang Kai was talking about the Extraordinary Treasure Pill, and immediately snorted coldly, “A trade is a trade. The goods were delivered and the bill was cleared, we have nothing to do with each other anymore.”

“Brother Wu Chang, why don’t you just change your name to ‘Heartless’!?” Yang Kai sighed in disappointment.

Chi Gui questioned in surprise from the side, “Little brat, speak clearly. What kind of trade did you two do that could help someone break through to the Emperor Realm?”

The other three Emperors who came earlier also showed an interested look. Even though they had just recently broken through and naturally did not need such a mysterious thing anymore, any treasure that could help one reach the Emperor Realm was not ordinary and if they could gain some of it, it would be of great benefit to their Sects.

All of these new Emperors were heirs or descendants of top Masters, and certainly had great forces supporting them from behind.

“What little brat!?” Yang Kai’s face darkened and he glared at Chi Gui, “You, red-haired punk, can you not speak any polite words?!”

“You… you dare call me a ‘red-haired punk!?” Chi Gui was so mad that his eyes almost popped out of their sockets.

The others were shocked again as they stared at Yang Kai with puzzled expressions.

Among the six people here, only Yang Kai was a Dao Source Realm cultivator, while the rest were all Emperor Realm Masters; however, Yang Kai did not show any fear towards them at all, even daring to speak impolitely to Chi Gui.

They could not believe this was happening.

One of the three Emperors with a muscular body suddenly laughed, “Chi Gui, you’re being underestimated.”

Chi Gui stared at Yang Kai with a grumpy face, and snorted, “It’s not that this Young Master is being underestimated, but rather that he does not underestimate himself!”

When they heard this, they immediately understood what Chi Gui meant. Yang Kai did not feel that he was inferior to them despite his lower cultivation, so he did not have scruples when speaking.

“I heard that he took a blow from you before?” The brawny young man spoke again.

Chi Gui snorted, “That’s right. This Young Master landed a blow using seventy percent of his strength, but he completely dispersed it.”

“Oh?” Another young man, whose whole body was lingering with black Qi, raised his brow and inspected Yang Kai again, as if he needed to re-evaluate him.

Taking seventy percent of Chi Gui’s strength was not something an ordinary Dao Source Realm cultivator could do. Even an outstanding Dao Source Realm genius should have suffered severe injuries from such an attack, but Chi Gui actually said Yang Kai was able to completely disperse his strike.

“Haha, looks like you people from Ahan Temple are nothing much,” the brawny youth laughed again.

Chi Gui felt annoyed and he unhesitantly reprimanded, “As if you can do something to him, don’t tell me that this little brat didn’t pass through your territory before.”

The brawny young man snorted disdainfully right away.

This brawny young man was the Emperor Realm Master who used a spear of light to attack Yang Kai, one of the only two people who had tried to block his path.

Chi Gui waved his hand, “Let’s not get entangled with trivial matters. What I wanted to know is, what are you guys doing here?”

The last Emperor Realm Master, who looked chubby and na?ve, responded, “Didn’t you all realize something abnormal about this Source Sea?”

This man had an extremely fat figure, his face stretched so wide that his eyes were barely visible. He was not tall, so if someone saw him from a far distance, they would think that he was just a giant winter melon.

However, despite his funny appearance, this man was also an authentic Emperor Realm Master.
