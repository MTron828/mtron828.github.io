Half a month later, outside Fragrance City.

This place’s prosperity was no less than any of the great cities in the outside world. It was also the place where the Beguiling Demon Queen lived.

The Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land covered a vast area but was roughly divided into six territories, each one belonging to one of the six Demon Kings.

With Fragrance City as a center point, all the land within a radius of several thousand kilometers belonged to Shan Qing Luo.

For the past two weeks, Shan Qing Luo, Yang Kai, Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man had passed through the territories of the other Great Evil Kings, forcing them to be constantly on alert.

Now stepping into Fragrance City, no matter whom it was they couldn’t help feeling relieved.

After two weeks of traveling together, not only had Yang Kai’s impression of the Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land changed, even Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man had their previous impressions completely subverted.

From the rumors they had heard, the Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land was filled with evil cultivators, where demons rampaged about, and every person they encountered was some kind of heinous criminal.

But after accompanying Shan Qing Luo, they found that the Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land was far different compared to the rumors about it! At the very least, the site which she occupied wasn’t that kind of infernal hell.

It was undeniable that there were indeed many evil cultivators in the Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land, but many of the people here were actually just ordinary people.

There was no lack of cultivators around who had committed some kind of crime within their Sect and had been forced to flee to the Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land. There were also some who had offended large forces that they could not afford to and had sought refuge in the Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land. Still others were here because the Secret Art or Martial Skills they practiced were eerie and they had been classified as demon by the world and expelled from their homes like plague rats.

It could be said that the majority of the Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land cultivators simply had their own bitter pasts but were not necessarily evil.

“This world only recognizes their so called righteousness, shunning any kind of darkness within their hearts, labeling such practices and feelings as evil... It’s all just sophistry!” Shan Qing Luo said certain helplessness apparent in her tone.

Although she was one of the six Great Evil Kings and governed a vast land that stretched across thousands of kilometres, she still couldn’t do anything about this world’s deep-rooted prejudices.

Yang Kai couldn’t help suddenly remembering the words Old Demon had once said to him.

What is a man, what is a devil? Men and Devils are all one in the same!

Everyone had demons within their hearts.

As they continued forward, Yang Kai quickly noticed how vibrant the city was, a fact that amazed him to no small degree.

It he wasn’t clearly aware that they hadn’t left the Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land, Yang Kai would have sworn that this Fragrance City was just another town in the outside world.

Everything here was no different from the grant cities in the outside world. The streets were filled with ordinary shopkeepers and people pawning their goods. Cultivators swam through the crowds like carp, and most of whom didn’t engage in any wanton bullying in their interactions with these ordinary people. Occasionally there was a cultivator exuding a thick Demonic Qi, but even they were for the most part following the rules of Fragrance City and didn’t make the slightest bit of trouble.

From time to time, Yang Kai would spot cultivators dressed in black uniforms patrolling about. These were apparently the law enforcement teams charged with maintaining order. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Whenever someone acted out and disrupted the public order in Fragrance City, they would swiftly and mercilessly be attacked by these law enforcement teams.

As a result, throughout the entire Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land, Fragrance City was about the safest city and under the effective management of Demon Queen Shan Qing Luo, and it was also the most prosperous. There were actually very few people here who committed crimes.

At the moment, this very Demon Queen was concealing her face with a black veil and leisurely strolled about as she led their small group forward.

Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man followed close behind her while secretly observing the scenes within this city. A deep sense of admiration welled up in their hearts.

Allowing this great city to be so peaceful, Shan Qing Luo’s means were clearly not simple.

As they continued walking, Yang Kai’s pace suddenly paused.

Aware of this, Shan Qing Luo turned to look at him, “Is something wrong?”

Yang Kai grinned helplessly, “Beauty, as the saying goes, ‘The world is filled with infinite wonders, one must not always remain in one place and further explore’.”

Although receiving the favour of this beauty was quite enjoyable, Yang Kai still couldn’t help feeling nervous that one day Shan Qing Luo wouldn’t be able to restrain herself from ‘eating’ him.

Also, it had been quite some time since he had been separated from Su Yan, so he wanted to quickly investigate her current situation.

Listening to him say as such, a light flickered across Shan Qing Luo’s eyes, and she immediately saw through all the thoughts that were in his heart. Quickly wearing a smile as she slowly walked back and grabbed Yang Kai’s arm, she let out a light fragrant breath, “Do you think you can just walk away?”

“Please try to restrain yourself!” Yang Kai’s expression became bitter. This was exactly what he was most worried about.

He had constantly been worried that Shan Qing Luo wouldn’t let him go. On the way back here he had also tried multiple times to escape, but each time before he even had a chance she would see through him.

Given the height of Shan Qing Luo’s true strength, if she was set on keeping him here, he really had no hope of getting away.

“Outside there is chaos everywhere. If you went out by yourself, it wouldn’t necessarily be safe, it’s best if you just stay here for now.”

“For how long?”

“Depends on my mood, haha...”

Yang Kai’s expression instantly became gloomier, [Damn it, if I’m stuck here won’t I eventually become prey for this devilish woman?]

Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man nearby both watched this farce play out with smug grins on their faces, indulging in a moment of pleasure at Yang Kai’s expense.

He was thoroughly restrained by Shan Qing Luo, his True Qi unable to circulate, but on top of that, this seductress also put on a well-behaved devoted lovers appearance and gently linked arms with Yang Kai as she affectionately snuggled up next to him.

Fortunately, she had concealed her face with a veil. If she were to expose this appearance to the inhabitants of Fragrance City, there would certainly be chaos.

Within a short while, the four of them arrived at Shan Qing Luo’s palace.

This grand palace exuded magnificence, covered a vast region, and was filled with jade statues, dragon carvings and phoenix images, which gave it an elegant yet domineering air.

Once inside, Yang Kai unexpectedly discovered that this huge palace was exceptionally peaceful. It seemed like not many people lived here.

Glancing around, he saw numerous wide corridors, and the sounds of small streams flowing nearby reached his ear. It was quite a picturesque feeling.

“Within my palace, in addition to a few maidservants, there are no other people, it has always been deserted like this so there’s no need for you to be overly cautious!” Shan Qing Luo softly explained. Having made it back to her palace she also completely relaxed and casually removed her veil before slowly stretching, putting her wondrous curves on full display.

“Who goes there!” A melodious voice soon called out as a purple dressed figure quickly approached.

“It’s me!” Shan Qing Luo replied leisurely.

After the figure paused for a moment, it suddenly flew forward even faster. In the blink of an eye, a sweet, petite girl appeared in front of everyone.

“My Queen, you’ve finally come back!” The girl appeared to be around twenty years old. A beautiful young lady who was at the height of her youth, and upon seeing Shan Qing Luo, clear lights of joy and relief flashed across her eyes.

Because she was so happy, her eyes actually began overflowing with tears, which rapidly became a veritable flood, as her proud snow white rabbits heaved up and down as she cried.

With only a faint glance, Yang Kai found that this girl was also an exceptional beauty.

She had long freely flowing hair, elegant thin eyebrows, and a pair of bright enchanting eyes. Her nose was perfectly proportioned, and her face was slightly flushed. Every time she breathed, her petal like lips fluttered softly, like flowers adorning her glamorous face. Her creamy snow white skin seemed to glisten under the light. All of this coupled with her graceful posture and exceptional figure, she was extremely enchanting.

Seeing her, Yang Kai couldn’t help nodding in approval, only such a beauty was worth of being the Beguiling Demon Queen’s maid.

Lightly sweeping her with his Divine Sense, he was surprised to find that this girl was actually a True Element Boundary Seventh Stage cultivator. Although she was not as strong as Qiu Yi Meng, it was clear that she was also younger than her by a year or two.

Being probed by a thread of Divine Sense, the girl’s expression suddenly became serious, and her eyes darted about before quickly glaring coldly towards Yang Kai.

[Ho... her senses are quite sharp!] Yang Kai chuckled lightly and carelessly ignored her gaze.

Her brow slightly wrinkled. This young girl obviously didn’t understand why Shan Qing Luo had brought these three people here, but instead of probing further she instead quickly ignored Yang Kai and eagerly asked, “Mistress, I heard that the Beast King and his people ambushed you! You’re not hurt are you?”

“I’m perfectly fine,” Shan Qing Luo shook her head lightly, “Nothing to worry about.”

“Thank goodness! That Beast King is really despicable! The Elders almost ran out to fight with him over this matter. Also, right now those Eight Great Families are rallying all the outside world’s major Sects to attack the Holy Land. Fragrance City has dispatched a lot of people to intercept them, the Elders said...”

“Leave such things for tomorrow, I’m feeling a bit weary right now.” Shan Qing Luo interrupted her. “Tell the Elders they have full discretion on these matters.”

“Yes Mistress.” The girl nodded seriously before once again suspiciously looking at the three newcomers, “These three...”

Shan Qing Luo also frowned slight as she glanced towards Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man before suddenly laughing happily. She flicked her wrist and sent two faint lights towards them.

Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man both trembled slightly, but before they could react, they instantly discovered that their True Qi had been sealed.

“What meaning does Elder Sister Shan have?” Qiu Yi Meng asked with a wry smile on her face.

“Oh nothing much,” Shan Qing Luo giggled, “Bi Luo, bring these two girls to the Fragrance Guest House.”

“En.” Bi Luo glanced curiously at Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man and wondered how these two had provoked her mistress, even causing her to go so far as to keep them under house arrest in the Fragrance Guest House.

Although she was puzzled by this, she did not bother asking and instead just clapped her delicate hands twice.

Soon after, a few young women arrived. Each one of them was as beautiful as a flower, and their cultivation was also not low. All of them were dressed up as maids.

“Show them to the Fragrance Guest House,” Bi Luo swiftly ordered.

“Yes!”

“Take good care of them, do not let them suffer any grievances!” Shan Qing Luo quickly added.

Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man both wore helpless smiles, not even attempting to revolt, but simply allowing these few maids to lead the way.

“What about him?” Bi Luo pointed towards Yang Kai and asked, confusion and doubt filling her thoughts. After all, she had never seen her mistress bring a young man into the palace before. Even when one of the other Demon Kings came to visit, she would arrange a separate location for them. This quiet place had never had a man set foot in it before.

“About him...” Shan Qing Luo smiled meaningfully and also sent a stream of light into Yang Kai body.

Yang Kai’s complexion subtly changed, and he stealthily circulated his True Qi only to discover that it had not been blocked, but instead finding that a mark had been left on his body, one that he had no way to resolve.

“Bring him to the Tranquil Phoenix Pavilion to rest!” Shan Qing Luo smiled sweetly as she looked towards Yang Kai.

Although Yang Kai maintained a calm expression, his stomach quickly filled with grievances.

“The Tranquil Phoenix Pavilion...” Bi Luo exclaimed. Her bright eyes filled with a look of surprise.

That place was located in the deepest part of the palace and was no doubt the best pavilion in the palace grounds. It was also where her mistress had stayed when she was growing up.

The mattress, curtains, and pillows were all things her mistress had used before, and many of which still carried her lingering scent.

Most importantly, it was filled with Shan Qing Luo’s childhood memories.

How could such an intimate and private place suddenly be given to a man to live in?
