These two teams were clearly different from ordinary Small Stone Race members. Their bodies were several times larger and their appearances were even more ferocious.

A small figure was also riding the leading Small Stone Race member of both teams.

“Ah, why are there two little children here?” Liu Mu exclaimed in surprise.

One of the two children suddenly shot a look at him. This casual glance caused Liu Mu to feel as if he had been struck by lightning. His entire body went stiff as cold sweat dripped down his back.

Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan were personally commanding their most elite teams on the battlefield to fight right now.

Fortunately, these two were only supervising and had no intention of taking action; otherwise, the fallout of their clash would be unimaginable. If these two were to battle, the Spirit Province would be reduced to nothing in an instant.

One after another, the Small Stone Race fell to the ground as pieces of rocks blanketed the battlefield. The battle quickly reached a conclusion. In less than the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, the remaining troops of their respective armies slowly retreated.

Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan, on the other hand, remained on the battlefield.

Big Brother Huang calmly looked at Big Sister Lan and arrogantly asserted, “You lost!”

Big Sister Lan disdainfully stated, “You lost!”

Big Brother Huang sneered, “What’s the point of haggling with me every time? Your Small Stone Race has more casualties.”

Big Sister Lan countered, pursing her lips, “But your personal guard has already been defeated by me. If we kept fighting, you would have definitely lost!”

Big Brother Huang shook his head, “It’s useless, no matter how you fight, you still won’t be able to defeat me. Even if I don’t have my elite guard, I can still defeat you.”

“Stop bragging!” Big Sister Lan made a face at Big Brother Huang, “You lost all your guards, who will you use to fight me!?”

Both of them glared at each other as if there was an irreconcilable blood feud between the two. Suddenly, both of them looked up toward the sky and asked in unison, ““Who do you think won?””

Yang Kai didn’t even have time to hide.

For a moment, Yang Kai had a huge headache. The last time he left, he had given these two the Small Stone Race for the two to rear and use to compete with each other. The loser would have to satisfy the other party’s desire to become the Big Brother or Big Sister.

By the looks of it now, these two were having a great time playing this game and were still in high spirits even after so long, but there was no accurate standard to determine the winner.

Yang Kai had a bad feeling when the two started arguing, and his premonition really came true.

Summoning up his courage, Yang Kai flew down from the ship and greeted with a smile, “Big Brother Huang, Big Sister Lan, we meet again.”

Six Wood Divine Monarch and Clear Horizon Divine Monarch followed closely behind Yang Kai. With his past experience, how could Liu Mu not be able to guess the identities of these two children? After all, how could two children survive in the Chaotic Dead Territory?

He was filled with anxiety at first, but after hearing how Yang Kai addressed them, his eyes could not help but widen in shock.

Da Yi had already experienced this shock once before, so his expression remained the same this time.

Liu Mu stepped forward and respectfully bowed, “Golden Antelope Paradise’s Liu Mu greets two Seniors.”

These two might look like little children, but they were actually Seniors amongst Seniors. Even an Old Ancestor from the Cave Heavens and Paradises would lose out in terms of seniority to them. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The two ignored him and simply stared at Yang Kai, as if they didn’t hear Liu Mu at all and all that mattered was Yang Kai’s answer.

Liu Mu suddenly felt somewhat awkward.

No matter what, he was still an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, an Ancestor-level figure in the Cave-Heavens and Paradises. He would be admired and respected by everyone no matter where he went. It had been millennia since he had last encountered this kind of situation and for a moment, he didn’t know what to do.

It was Yang Kai who helped him out, quietly nudging him and stating, “What Senior? Don’t call them Senior, call them Big Brother and Big Sister!”

Liu Mu’s eyes widened even more, staring at Yang Kai in surprise. Obviously, he was asking with his eyes, ‘Is that okay?’

Yang Kai might have called them Big Brother Huang, Big Sister Lan, but he didn’t dare act rashly in front of these two. Addressing like this violated the order of seniority, and if this offended them, the entire Golden Antelope Paradise wouldn’t even be able to fill the gaps between their gnashing teeth.

Just as he was hesitating, Da Yi had already accepted Yang Kai’s suggestion and cupped his fist toward Big Brother Huang, “Big Brother!”

He then turned to Big Sister Lan, “Big Sister!”

Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan both turned to look at him, nodding slightly. There was a kind look in their eyes, as if they were exchanging greetings.

[It’s really okay!?] Liu Mu was stunned! He had never seen such a strange thing in his long life. Nonetheless, he called them Big Brother and Big Sister without any hesitation, his attitude genial and tone sincere. This finally made the two acknowledge his existence.

Just as he was feeling comforted in his heart, Yang Kai suddenly betrayed him and Da Yi, “Big Brother and Big Sister are quite worried about their battle, but Little Brother’s vision is too poor to judge the winner here. It would be better to ask these two as they are much stronger than Little Brother and their vision is much more profound.”

Saying so, he swiftly took a step back.

Clear Horizon Divine Monarch and Six Wood Divine Monarch stood out at once, which made their facial muscles twitch.

Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan, on the other hand, shifted their gazes and intensely stared at them, causing the two of them to feel uncomfortable as if swords were being poked into their backs.

“Speak, did I win?” Big Brother Huang asked, looking at the two. Although his tone was calm, whether it was Liu Mu or Da Yi, both of them could faintly sense the threat in his tone. They could tell that if they were to say no, they would not be alive to see the sun tomorrow.

“It’s me who won, isn’t it? You’ve been watching from above for so long, you must have noticed.” Big Sister Lan’s tone wasn’t threatening, but the look in her eyes was obviously not.

Cold sweat dripped down the backs of the two Eighth-Order Ancestors. This was the first time they ever felt that life was so difficult.

Liu Mu secretly cursed to himself, [I should have stayed in Black Territory. Why did I follow Yang Boy here?]

He couldn’t afford to offend either of these two. It was impossible for him to achieve a perfect answer no matter what, but he had no choice but to give one. Being stared at by those two, Liu Mu was under a great deal of pressure.

He secretly glanced at Da Yi through the corner of his eyes, but he noticed cold sweat dripping down his temple too, causing him to secretly laugh in his heart, [It turns out I am not the only one suffering here.]

Liu Mu suddenly became much more relaxed, and after a moment of deliberation, he finally spoke, “When I was watching the battle, I thought that it was as if the Heavens themselves were commanding those soldiers. The soldiers were moving and fighting in an orderly manner. This… Little Brother, truly admires you!”

He then turned to Da Yi, and shot him a look.

Da Yi immediately understood and continued, “However, the outcome of this battle has yet to be decided, so it is difficult to say who won and lost. There are many factors that determine the outcome of a battle, such as the timing, location, and soldiers, all of which are indispensable. Any slight change in circumstances can change the entire course of the battle, so it is difficult to determine the winner…”

Seeing the unhappy faces of the two, Liu Mu quickly interrupted Da Yi, “However, based on the number of casualties your subordinates have suffered, it should be a tie, so in my opinion, this battle… is a draw, right?”

He didn’t dare to answer too confidently. He kept observing their expressions, preparing to say something else if this did not satisfy them…

Da Yi immediately nodded like a chicken pecking at rice, “Yes, yes, yes, a draw!”

Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan fell into deep thought. Both of them were clearly unsatisfied with this answer, but it was still acceptable. As far as the two were concerned, it was a win as long as they did not lose.

Big Brother Huang raised his head and suggested, “Then let’s call it a draw.” He suddenly turned to Big Sister Lan and assertively declared, “Next time, I’ll definitely beat you until you call me Big Brother!”

Big Sister Lan was not to be outdone, “If you think you have what it takes to defeat me, then you come at me anytime! But first, ask if my army of 30 million agrees!”

Brother Huang sneered, “It’s obviously just 18 million, yet you insist on saying it’s 30 million, you really like boasting!”

The two broke into another argument, but Da Yi and Liu Mu both let out long sighs of relief. They felt as if they had just escaped a disaster.

Suddenly, the two stopped bickering and looked at Yang Kai together. Big Brother Huang then stated, “You seem to have brought a lot of disgusting people with you this time!”

The last time Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan noticed the Black Ink Strength inside Yang Kai, both of them showed faces of revulsion.

The thousands of Black Ink Disciples on the ship might have their energy suppressed and sealed, but how could the Black Ink Strength escape Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan’s senses?

In fact, they had already noticed everything as soon as the ship entered the Chaotic Dead Territory. It was just that the two were more focused on the outcome of their battle so they didn’t bother to ask anything.

Yang Kai stepped forward and cupped his fist, “Little Brother is actually here for this reason. The people on the ship have been corrupted by the Black Ink Strength and have been turned into Black Ink Disciples. They have lost their sense of self. I would like to ask for Big Brother and Big Sister’s help to save them.

Big Brother Huang furrowed his brow, “There are so many of them.”

Yang Kai added, “In the vast Universe, only Big Brother and Big Sister can expel the Black Ink Strength. If you two don’t do anything, they will definitely die!”

Big Brother Huang hesitated for a moment before suddenly glancing at Big Sister Lan, who happened to look at him too.

Their eyes met, and both of them seemed to be thinking the same thing.

The next moment, Yang Kai and the two Divine Monarchs saw the two little children squat down and leaned closer, whispering to each other.

Big Brother Huang asked, “Have you noticed a problem recently?”

Big Sister Lan asked, “You also noticed?”

Big Brother Huang nodded in acknowledgment, “The number of Small Stone Race under our command is increasing, so it’s getting harder to command them.”

“En, they’re too stupid, sometimes they don’t even understand what we want them to do.”

“En, Little Brother Yang also said that their intelligence is not high, so they cannot understand complex orders.”

“That’s why we need some generals who will follow our orders and lead our armies into battle!”

“En en, I’ve thought about it before, but I couldn’t find anyone.”

“We couldn’t find them before, but don’t we have them now? And they’ve even delivered themselves to us.”

While speaking, Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan both turned to look up at the ship, then at Six Wood Divine Monarch and Clear Horizon Divine Monarch with deep and profound gazes.

The two Divine Monarchs’ felt their faces immediately twitched.

A strange look also appeared on Yang Kai’s face as he kindly reminded the two, “Big Brother Huang, Big Sister Lan, we can hear everything you’re saying.”
