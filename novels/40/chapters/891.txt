Martial Peak – Chapter 892, Having Fun

The Divine Tree’s actions only agitated the Shimmering Moon Grass even more, and after a moment, it plunged into the small pond of Myriad Drug Liquid trying to hide.

However, the instant the Shimmering Moon Grass entered the pool of Myriad Drug Liquid, it relaxed greatly and began absorbing it at a rate visible to the naked eye, its three leaves releasing a brilliant glow as it did so.

Seeing this, Yang Kai’s face went black and was just about to viciously pluck the Shimmering Moon Grass out of the Myriad Drug Liquid pond, but the Divine Tree somehow managed to beat him to it.

Wrapping the three-leaved grass up in an invisible Spiritual Energy, the Divine Tree hurriedly pulled it from the pond.

Immediately after, Yang Kai felt that the Divine Tree was using its divine Sense to communicating with the Shimmering Moon Grass.

Calming down, Yang Kai slowly wore a light smile.

After a short silence, the Divine Tree spoke, “I’ve already reprimanded it and will carefully watch over it to make sure it doesn’t misbehave again. However, this little fellow’s consciousness is similar to mine was before I met you and hasn’t fully formed yet, so communicating with it is somewhat difficult. Is this one of the World Spirit Treasures you told me about before?”

“En,” Yang Kai chuckled, “Take your time, as long as you persist you’ll one day be able to communicate with it smoothly. If I have an opportunity, I’ll try to find some more World Spirit Treasures for you so you can have more companions.”

“Yay!” The Divine Tree responded happily.

When Yang Kai recalled about the promise he made with the Divine Tree to look for some World Spirit Treasures to keep it company, he asked Xu Hui to make an announcement saying that anyone willing to part with such a treasure would be granted three free pill refinements, thinking he might get lucky and one day come across someone with a World Spirit Treasure.

What Yang Kai hadn’t expected was that one of the customers outside the Holy Land really had a World Spirit Treasure on him and was willing to part with it, a stroke of good luck.

After observing for a while and confirming that there were no problems, Yang Kai took back his consciousness from the Black Book space and began practising Alchemy again.

For the past month, he had been performing Alchemy, not taking even half a step outside this room.

Countless Spirit Grade Top-Rank and Saint Grade Low-Rank pills had been refined by him since then, none of which had ever failed.

The biggest reason for this phenomenal success rate was his Conflagrated Knowledge Sea which allowed him to have much greater control over the Alchemic Spirit Arrays inside his pill furnace. Using his Conflagrated Spiritual Energy also greatly accelerated the speed at which he could perform Alchemy.

With his current accomplishments in the Alchemic Way, Yang Kai was capable of refining a Spirit Grade Top-Rank pill within a quarter of an hour and a Saint Grade Low-Rank pill within only half an hour.

With such speed, finishing ten pills a day was actually remarkably relaxed.

The rest of his time was spent restoring himself while meditating over the insights he obtained during the repeated Alchemy refinements.

In short, he was having fun!

There was not the slightest bit of annoyance or agitation in Yang Kai’s mood at all.

He now had an abundant supply of high-grade herbs to practice with, which allowed him to rapidly explore, test and prove his previous conjectures about the promotion of forming Pill Veins.

Yang Kai had now concluded that Pill Veins could indeed be artificially produced, but the process was by no means simple or easy. At the moment the pill was about to be successfully refined, numerous complex Spirit Arrays had to be portrayed, merged, and infused into the pill.

Once this process succeeded, Pill Veins would form and the pill would no longer lose any of its medicinal efficacies over time as long as it was stored properly.

Yang Kai could not produce Spirit Grade Top-Rank pills with Pill Veins at will, while, because the difficulty in executing this technique increased exponentially with each grade, an element of luck was still required to produce Saint Pills with Pill Veins.

In the process of Alchemy, Yang Kai was constantly using his Conflagrated Knowledge Sea but after an entire month of this, not only was he not feeling tired, Yang Kai even faintly felt that his Spiritual Energy had increased in both density and purity.

The sentiments he obtained from immersing himself in the Alchemic way also boosted his comprehension of the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao, allowing Yang Kai to further consolidate his foundation and improve his strength. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The Alchemic Way and Martial Dao complimented one another; making progress in either of these fields would lead to progress in the other, a truly gratifying experience.

Even without deliberately cultivating, Yang Kai felt his cultivation steadily making progress and if this kind of momentum was kept up, he felt it would not be long before he touched the threshold of the Saint Realm.

If he managed to come across some kind of opportunity, this process could be even further shortened.

The Third Order Transcendent was just a stone’s throw away from the Saint Realm.

Different from a True Element Boundary breaking through to the Immortal Ascension Boundary or stepping from the Immortal Ascension Boundary into the Transcendent Realm, entering the Saint Realm required crossing an even greater watershed.

The Thousand-Year Demon Flower’s medicinal liquid could assist a Transcendent in achieving this breakthrough, and Yang Kai still had two drops of it left from when he first visited the Starry Sky.

At that time, Yang Kai had condensed a total of six drops of this precious medicinal liquid, four of which were given to Cang Yan for his Martial Seniors back in Soaring Heaven Sect. The remaining two were still inside the Black Book space.

The Thousand-Year Demon Flower’s medicinal liquid did not have any side effects either, so Cang Yan and Fei Yu using it to break through to the First Order Saint Realm would not cause any flaws to appear in their foundation which may affect their future cultivation.

However, Yang Kai did not intend to use any kind of outside boosts to help him as he always felt that only by using his own strength to achieve each breakthrough would he gain the maximum amount of benefits.

Alchemy was the best auxiliary cultivation method. Yang Kai had obtained many insights and unexpected gains while studying the Alchemic Way, allowing his body and soul to obtain a kind of profound sublimation.

The days passed by.

Thanks to the astonishing Alchemy results it produced, Nine Heavens Holy Land’s name now echoed loudly throughout all of Tong Xuan Realm.

Some cultivators would spend months travelling tens of thousands of kilometres just to ask the mysterious Alchemy Grandmaster of the Holy Land to refine pills for them.

Outside the nine peaks, the lineup of cultivators seeking Alchemy services now stretched for miles with no less than a hundred people arriving every single day to join the queue.

The mysterious Grandmaster of Nine Heavens Holy Land’s Alchemy achievements were nothing short of astonishing. From the first time he took action until now, he had not once failed a single refinement and had even produced many pills that formed Pill Veins.

Gradually, some people began comparing this hidden Grandmaster to The Old Man of Heaven’s Keep, wondering who would win if the two were to compete.

However, The Old Man of Heaven’s Keep was a legendary figure, one that even those of the Demon Race and Monster Race would treat with the utmost respect, a figure revered by every sentient being in Tong Xuan Realm.

With just this alone the Grandmaster of Nine Heavens Holy Land could not be compared.

As the Holy Land’s Grandmaster’s reputation spread, not just Spirit Grade Top-Rank and Saint Grade Low-Rank pills, but even Saint Grade Mid-Rank pills were confirmed to have been refined by him.

Each guest that visited Nine Heavens Holy Land to ask for Alchemy services left with a big smile of satisfaction on their face.

Every time a pill was refined successfully, the Holy Land would receive remuneration equal to that pill’s value.

These days, Xu Hui and the other Elders would always have big grins on their faces, as if all their previous worries and misfortune were nothing but a distant memory.

The Treasury of Nine Heavens Holy Land was now almost overflowing with Crystal Stones and a wide variety of cultivation materials.

This trend only accelerated after the mysterious Grandmaster changed his policy of only refining ten pills a day to refining twenty pills a day.

Many who came to ask for Alchemy services would not only provide compensation equal to the value of the pill they requested but would leave additional gifts as thanks.

Xu Hui now also began to wonder whether there was more than one Alchemy Grandmaster hidden in the Holy Land.

If that wasn’t the case, how could a single person refine twenty pills in a single day?

To accomplish such a feat, there had to be three Saint Grade Mid-Rank Alchemy Grandmasters at the very least! Xu Hui secretly speculated.

The Great Commanders of the Ancient Demon Clan were quite clear that the current prosperity of the Holy Land was Yang Kai’s handiwork; however, without Yang Kai’s permission, they didn’t reveal such secrets to Xu Hui and the others.

Now that the Holy Land had an abundance of resources, the Ancient Demon Clan had no need to run outside the nine peaks to seek for cultivation supplies, so naturally, they did not cause any trouble with the public.

Regarding the cultivation supplies provided to the Ancient Demon Clan, Xu Hui showed no ill-treatment at all; on the contrary, what was portioned for them was extremely generous. Whatever the Ancient Demon Clan needed, he would freely provide, earning him Li Rong’s gratitude.

......

Outside the nine peaks, there is a newly built stone pavilion.

There were several exquisite stone benches and stone tables inside this new building with a fresh pot of tea steeping nearby.

Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong sat inside the stone pavilion, watching the crowds lined up in the long queue, sipping tea while chatting quietly.

With so many guests coming each day to request Alchemy services, it was necessary to have at least two Saint Realm Elders posted to maintain order. Today was Elders Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong’s turn.

These two women had vastly different temperaments, but their graceful figures, full peaks, thin waists, long slender legs, and well-rounded bottoms were undeniably charming and added a splash of colour to the otherwise dull jungle scenery outside the Holy Land.

The customers who had come here and were now idly standing in line, extremely bored from all the waiting, couldn’t help directing stares towards the two beautiful female Elders in order to comfort their souls.

Noticing the strangeness of the various gazes upon them, though Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong weren’t exactly pleased, they were helpless to stop it. The most they could do was order the Holy Land disciples to circle the stone pavilion to somewhat block these prying eyes.

Although their job was supposedly to maintain order, in fact, there was rarely a need for them to do anything.

Most people who came here behaved extremely prudent and didn’t dare cut in line or stir up trouble.

Occasionally, when someone with an overinflated ego that wanted to take advantage of their own status or strength to try to act out, before the Holy Land’s disciple could even take action, the various masters who were patiently waiting in line would clean them up.

Most of the people who came to request Alchemy services here were Transcendents, but there was no shortage of Saints among them.

Provoking all of these powerhouses by trying to cut in line naturally never led to good results.

As such, Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong only had to drink tea and relax in the stone pavilion while chatting, as if they were taking a leisurely break.

Near the end of the snaking line, a group consisting of two young women and a middle-aged man were.

The middle-aged man looked slightly impatient as he shot glances towards the front of the line from time to time and let out a slight sigh.

There were currently hundreds of people waiting in front of him, and the Grandmasters of the Holy Land would only refine twenty pills a day, so it would be at least a month before his turn came.

One of the two young women was also glancing towards the nine peaks, a complicated look upon her face.

After waiting in line for quite some time, the middle-aged man suddenly whispered, “Xuan’er, aren’t you acquainted with that new Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land? Couldn’t you ask a favour of him so your father can have his pill refined faster? That Grandmaster belongs to Nine Heavens Holy Land so shouldn’t he obey the Holy Master’s orders?”

“I was only casually acquainted with him, there’s no deep friendship between us. How could I shamelessly ask him for a favour now? Perhaps he has even completely forgotten about me,” The young woman said with a forced, bitter smile.

Just after she spoke these words though, the other woman next to her couldn’t help snorting loudly as she muttered, “There’s not much friendship between you? Did I hear that wrong? Didn’t you and him...”

“Xin Yu!” The first young woman glared over at her companion, the latter raising her hands in surrender, “Fine fine, pretend I didn’t say anything, it’s your own destiny, you have the right to choose. Just don’t regret it in the future!”

The middle-aged man, seeing this, couldn’t help chuckling awkwardly, “Xuan’er, no matter what how brief your friendship was, there’s no harm in trying right? Regardless of anything else, that Holy Master used to be part of my Bold Independent Union, right? Surely he hasn’t completely forgotten his roots.”

“I told you before he was only visiting Bold Independent Union, why do you keep trying to say he was a Bold Independent Union disciple?” The young woman stamped her foot angrily, “It’s fine if you want to say such things in private but don’t make such claims in public or people will begin thinking we’re just shamelessly boasting.”
