Space Beacons were a useful tool that could connect two distant places, and upon Yang Kai’s activation, the Space Beacons’ power was magnified. The Black Ink Disciples sucked into the black holes were sent to a place that was billions of kilometres away.

Although the Black Ink Disciples could return, it would take them several days to do so. That was the only thing Yang Kai could do in this situation.

The silent Black Ink Disciples suddenly dispersed and blindly charged forward again.

More Space Beacons exploded and turned into black holes as they drew those Black Ink Disciples into them; however, the trick was no longer as effective.

Yang Kai kept darting around as he forcefully transferred more Black Ink Disciples inside his Small Universe and suppressed them.

However, his stamina was not infinite. Although he had made prior arrangements and fully exerted himself in the moment, he still couldn’t stop all these Black Ink Disciples from killing themselves. Eventually, one Black Ink Disciple broke through the blockade and crashed into the periphery of the Grand Array where the Black Ink Clansman was imprisoned.

The Grand Array’s power erupted and turned the Black Ink Disciple into dust. His Small Universe collapsed, and his World Force dissipated.

Although Yang Kai had previously seen batches of Black Ink Disciples killing themselves, he hadn’t originally understood their intentions. It wasn’t until he heard Luan Bai Feng’s explanation that he found out the reason.

As he observed the situation more carefully, he realised that the World Force which leaked from the dead Black Ink Disciple was drawn to the centre of the Black Prison by a mysterious force.

There was no doubt that the sleeping Black Ink Clansman was absorbing that World Force.

A second Black Ink Disciple soon crashed into the Grand Array.

More and more Black Ink Disciples broke through the blockade and sacrificed themselves to the Black Ink Clansman.

All the Space Beacons were used up by now, and Yang Kai had become noticeably sluggish and was no longer as agile before.

Luan Bai Feng, who had been hiding in her Spirit Arrays, finally appeared. Gazing at Yang Kai, she guffawed, “How much longer can you persevere?”

She could see the problem that Yang Kai was facing, so she was no longer afraid that he would harm her.

There was no way he would kill her here; otherwise, it would be akin to providing nourishment to the Black Ink Clansman. On the other hand, he was unable to put her inside his Small Universe as she was a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. He could only keep Open Heaven Realm Masters that were below the Sixth-Order inside his Small Universe.

Furthermore, his Small Universe must have reached its limit.

So far, Yang Kai had sucked around 2,000 Black Ink Disciples into this Small Universe, which was about half of the total number of Black Ink Disciples here.

There was a limit to his Small Universe’s capacity unfortunately, and for every Black Ink Disciple he swallowed, the capacity would be reduced by a little. It was impossible for him to keep infinitely imprisoning these Black Ink Disciples in his Small Universe.

In fact, it was already inconceivable that he had managed to gobble up 2,000 Black Ink Disciples.

With such a large number of Black Ink Disciples inside his Small Universe, it was expected that it would be hard for Yang Kai to mobilize his strength, not to mention that he had to divert a large part of his energy to suppress these Black Ink Disciples so that they wouldn’t be able to harm him from the inside.

It was because of these hidden dangers that High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters wouldn’t keep other Open Heaven Realm Masters inside their Small Universes despite being able to do so. They wouldn’t do this unless it was absolutely necessary.

First of all, it would affect their abilities to use their powers by keeping other Open Heaven Realm Masters inside their Small Universes.

Secondly, if some ill-intentioned people made a move inside their Small Universes, they would be faced with great danger.

Now, Yang Kai had reached his limit.

The fact that the Black Ink Disciples were able to brush past him and his sluggishness were the best proof.

A sense of hesitation flashed through Luan Bai Feng’s eyes as she pondered on whether she should seize this chance and kill Yang Kai. Now, he was unable to fully activate his power. Perhaps he could only use half of his strength, so this was a great opportunity.

Nevertheless, she soon gave up on that tempting idea.

Although killing Yang Kai was important, she had to help her Master restore his power as soon as possible. As long as the Master could awaken, Yang Kai would no longer pose any threat to them.

As the leader of these Black Ink Disciples, Luan Bai Feng activated her Divine Sense and prompted all the others to madly charge forward. They were no longer bothered by Yang Kai’s presence.

Yang Kai let out a sigh and performed a hand seal with one hand. The next moment, the power of a Divine Spirit swirled around him.

Luan Bai Feng’s chest tightened as she suddenly had a bad feeling.

“Dragon Transformation!”

As soon as Yang Kai growled, a Dragon Roar was heard reverberating across the void. A huge Golden Dragon Head appeared behind him and a rich Dragon Pressure materialised and engulfed the surrounding space. Without stopping, the Dragon Head plunged into his body and disappeared.

The next instant, a series of cracking sounds were heard coming from Yang Kai’s body and soon a colossal creature came into the Black Ink Disciples’ sight.

It was a Golden Grand Dragon!

The Dragon was covered in thick scales and there were two intimidating Dragon Horns on his forehead. His Dragon Claws could be seen flickering with cold light, and the beard under his chin could be seen flapping in the non-existent wind. His huge eyes were like two Suns that dazzled everyone’s eyes.

Yang Kai’s 20,000 metres figure hovered in the void, as though marking a boundary between life or death.

Luan Bai Feng narrowed her eyes.

She knew that Yang Kai had a Dragon Clan bloodline, and a very pure one at that. Additionally, she had seen him using his Dragon Transformation before.

However, that happened several hundred years ago and after using his Secret Technique, he only transformed into 3,000 metres Half Dragon.

Several hundred years had passed, and now a 20,000 metres Grand Dragon stood before her.

A horrifying Dragon Pressure seemed to have materialised as all the Black Ink Disciples were stunned in place. As the leader of all Divine Spirits, the Dragon Clan’s presence was naturally intimidating to all other living creatures. This wouldn’t change even though they had turned into Black Ink Disciples.

Nonetheless, Luan Bai Feng soon came to her senses.

Yang Kai’s power had been affected because he had swallowed too many Black Ink Disciples, so he had no choice but to transform into a Grand Dragon in an attempt to deal with so many Black Ink Disciples head on.

It was actually good news for them.

“Ignore him! Our lives are all for the glory of our Master!” Luan Bai Feng bellowed.

The Black Ink Disciples shot forward again. Even though a 20,000 metres creature was colossal, it was still tiny when compared to the expansive void.

Like the rising tide coming into contact with a rock, these Black Ink Disciples dispersed right in front of the Grand Dragon.

Certainly, Yang Kai wouldn’t let them succeed. As the distance between them shortened, he lifted his Dragon Head and the next moment, a deafening Dragon Roar reverberated out.

This Dragon Roar was actually a chant in the abstruse Dragon Language, one of the Secret Techniques unique to the Dragon Clan.

All these Black Ink Disciples seemed to have crashed into an invisible wall as they were forced to stop in their tracks. The weaker ones directly passed out upon impact while the stronger ones saw blood streaming out of their ears and noses as they staggered in the void.

In the blink of an eye, several hundred of the remaining Black Ink Disciples had passed out.

Luan Bai Feng’s expression instantly turned livid.

The Dragon Roar still hadn’t stopped yet, so the still conscious Black Ink Disciples hurriedly activated their powers to resist its influence.

A moment later, the Dragon Roar gradually died down and the conscious Black Ink Disciples once again charged forward without hesitation.

This time, they scattered even further away from each other.

A sense of helplessness flashed through the Grand Dragon’s eyes. Yang Kai had already done his best, but he still couldn’t stop these Black Ink Disciples from sacrificing themselves.

He could only continue trying to stop them and let the Heavens decide their fate.

As Space Principles undulated, he used Near Distant Horizon and caused the void to contort.

After these Black Ink Disciples were engulfed in Near Distant Horizon, they were unable to move forward at all even though they were seemingly charging ahead.

The Grand Dragon dashed forward as he swung his Dragon Tail and wielded his Dragon Claws. Even the Dragon Horns on his forehead had turned into weapons as he knocked these Black Ink Disciples unconscious.

Yang Kai wouldn’t dare to kill them, as any dead Black Ink Disciple would help to restore the Black Ink Clansman’s power.

Even though a lot of Black Ink Disciples had passed out, more of them had broken through his blockade and crashed into the Grand Array.

After one or two days of intense battle, more than 1,000 Black Ink Disciples had been knocked out by Yang Kai while several hundred people had brushed past him and gotten themselves killed.

This made Yang Kai feel helpless.

Now, he was faced with an even more difficult situation.

The Black Ink Disciples that were transferred away by his Space Beacons should be returning soon, which would mean at least 1,000 more enemies to deal with.

The Black Ink Disciples had become familiar with the way Yang Kai fought, so he was no longer able to stop so many of them on his own.

Realizing this as well, Luan Bai Feng flashed a victorious smile at him.

Yang Kai had no idea what would happen if so many people managed to move past him. Perhaps the sleeping Black Ink Clansman would get enough nourishment and awaken from his slumber.

In front of the centre of the Black Prison, a Grand Dragon was silently hovering in the void. His own body was the last barrier. In a place that wasn’t far away from him, Luan Bai Feng was humming a song as she was apparently in a good mood.

Besides the two of them, the unconscious Black Ink Disciples scattered around the void.

Luan Bai Feng attempted to persuade him by saying, “You’re incredible enough to have achieved all this on your own, Yang Kai. Give up now. It’s still not too late to submit to Master.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The Grand Dragon shook his head, “I’ll never side with you.”

“What side do you think you are on? What are you looking for in life? Whatever it is you desire, Master can give it to you.”

“He can’t.”

“He definitely can.” Luan Bai Feng spoke in a gentle voice as though she was coaxing a child.

“I think you’re sick of living!”

“Oh, you’re right.” Luan Bai Feng covered her lips and giggled, “Even I’d like to perish now; but, do you have the guts to kill me?”

As she spoke, she suddenly turned her head to look in a particular direction from which a ray of light was seen rapidly approaching them.

She put on a smile, “Look, my companions are back while you’re on your last legs. How are you going to fend them off this time?”

Yang Kai fell silent as he looked solemnly at the first ray of light that was coming from the distance.

There seemed to be even more rays of light behind it.

Luan Bai Feng’s smile became brighter, “The Black Ink Clan will eventually rule over the entire universe. Stop being so obstinate, Yang Kai!”

Yang Kai’s expression suddenly turned awkward as he questioned, “Are you sure about that?
