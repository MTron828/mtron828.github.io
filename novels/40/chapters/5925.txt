Chapter 5926: Suppressing Black Ink Army

| Martial Peak | Next Chapter>>

Two Innate Territory Lords stayed back to keep an eye on things while the other Masters from the Black Ink Clan left as quickly as they came.

Yang Kai, who was still in hiding, cocked his brow and transmitted to Wu Kuang, “What a… unique nickname you have there.”

“I interacted with the Royal Lords here a couple of times when I was bored,” Wu Kuang quipped, “I made a strong impression on them!”

Yang Kai had nothing to say to that.

Standing guard over the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction for thousands of years was indeed a lonely, monotonous task. Making contact with the Royal Lords would not only relieve some stress but would also be a chance to glean useful information.

“I’ll take you over to the Suppressing Black Ink Army. Don’t resist,” Wu Kuang’s voice rang out.

Yang Kai hummed in acknowledgement.

At the very next breath, he felt a strange energy enveloping him and whisking him through the endless Black Ink Strength.

Yang Kai was moved silently and unnoticeably. Occasionally, he could sense strong auras flitting past him. These belonged to the Royal Lords, but somehow, with the help of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction’s power, he could move past them without being detected.

At last, Yang Kai felt as if he had broken through a layer of some sort and entered a different space.

The darkness disappeared at once.

This space was not filled with Black Ink Strength. It was a fairly small area where speckles of light could be seen.

Yang Kai followed the light and saw the Suppressing Black Ink Fortress. Glowing pearls hung atop the Suppressing Black Ink Fortress and gave off the soft light that Yang Kai saw.

A group of people was waiting expectantly on the Suppressing Black Ink Fortress. They had heard the news from Wu Kuang in advance and knew Yang Kai was coming.

Yang Kai moved over to the Suppressing Black Ink Fortress and soon, he landed in front of the group. He let out a small exhale of relief as his eyes took in the crowd; then, he bowed in greeting to the silver-haired man in front, “Senior.”

Wu Kuang borrowed the strength of the Grand Restriction to create this space. It was largely protected from the Black Ink Clan’s eyes, and that was why the Suppressing Black Ink Army was able to remain inside for so long without being annihilated.

As it was a small space, Fu Guang did not use his Dragon Form but remained in his Human Form instead.

Fu Guang raised his hand and said, “We can skip the formalities. It is unfortunate that you had to see us in this awkward predicament.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “It is I who failed to plan properly. All of you have suffered greatly for the past few years, Senior.”

“We all share the responsibility of vanquishing the Black Ink Clan,” Fu Guang waved his hand before asking, “How are things out there?”

Wu Kuang had informed them that Yang Kai was coming, but he did not give them an update about the situation beyond the Grand Restriction, so Fu Guang could not help but feel a bit concerned.

The Suppressing Black Ink Army was in charge of standing guard over the opening in the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. They had been sucked into the Grand Restriction during an earlier commotion, and without them, a large number of Masters from the Black Ink Clan had escaped from the breach. That would surely be a blow to the Humans in the 3,000 Worlds.

“We have reclaimed the 3,000 Worlds,” Yang Kai declared, “All of the Black Ink Clansmen there have been wiped out. The Human Race Army is currently making its way over and will arrive at the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction in about a month.”

“Oh?” Fu Guang’s spirits soared at once, “We have reclaimed the 3,000 Worlds?”

Everyone else was thrilled by the news.

They had been positioned outside the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction for years now and never got a chance to make contact with the others back home, so they were completely unaware of what was happening. The lack of information was torturous for the Suppressing Black Ink Army.

They did not know how much longer they had to stand watch here…

Now that they heard the 3,000 Worlds had been reclaimed, they felt a heavy burden lifted off their shoulders.

“A large number of Masters escaped from the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, so we realised that something must’ve happened at the Grand Restriction, which is why I came over first to see what the situation was,” Yang Kai added.

Fu Guang nodded, “A few years ago, the Grand Restriction had a sudden burst of instability. The Suppressing Black Ink Army failed to withdraw in time so we were sucked inside. We’re only able to survive this long thanks to Wu Kuang’s protection.”

Nevertheless, even though Wu Kuang used the power of the Grand Restriction to hide the Suppressing Black Ink Army’s tracks to keep them out of sight from the Black Ink Clan, they were still doomed if they could not think of a way to escape this predicament.

Wu Kuang could keep them safe for now, but he could not do so forever.

This was Mo’s domain, and it was filled with its energy and creations. Now and then, the Suppressing Black Ink Army would inadvertently let out a trace of their existence and the Black Ink Clan would mount a siege.

In fact, it had happened just a while ago and Wu Kuang had to rush over to rescue them.

All of a sudden, Wu Kuang’s voice rang out, “Once the Human Race Army comes along to keep the Black Ink Clan occupied, I’ll find a chance to deliver all of you out of here.”

He could not make an attempt now. For one, there were over 10 million Black Ink Clansmen outside the Grand Restriction so the Suppressing Black Ink Army would be slaughtered the moment they showed up.

Furthermore, within the Grand Restriction, a large number of Masters from the Black Ink Clan were lying in wait near the opening as well.

The Black Ink Clan knew that there was a Human Race Army inside the Grand Restriction, and there was also only one opening that allowed passage out of the Grand Restriction. By guarding that spot, they made it impossible for the Humans to escape.

If the Suppressing Black Ink Army wanted to leave safely, they had to wait until the Human Race Army arrived. Once the battle broke out, they would get their chance to leave.

Before that, they would have to remain under Wu Kuang’s watchful protection.

After getting more information about the outside world from Yang Kai, Fu Guang began to feel more assured.

“Oh, right. I brought some resources, Senior.” Yang Kai took out a small pile of Space Rings from his Small Universe.

After seizing the No-Return Pass, the Humans managed to restock their supplies. The Black Ink Clan had gathered a great number of resources during their occupation and failed to destroy them in the hasty battle, so the resources naturally fell into the Humans’ hands.

Yang Kai had stored a lot of resources in his Small Universe for his own ease of use, so he could now pass them over to the Suppressing Black Ink Army.

Fu Guang accepted the Space Rings and nodded lightly, “Resources are indeed in short supply, so I’ll take these.”

Yang Kai felt ashamed, “I should’ve dealt with this issue sooner, but something unexpected happened a while back and I could no longer come over anytime I wanted.”

Fu Guang nodded once more. He then glanced at Yu Ru Meng at the others who were standing to the side and thoughtfully announced, “I’ll go and hand out the resources to the others first.”

“Many thanks, Senior.”

Soon, the only ones remaining were Yang Kai and his Family.

He looked at the women and saw Yu Ru Meng, Su Yan, Shan Qing Luo, Zhu Qing, Xue Yue, Ji Yao, Qu Hua Shang, and Tao Ling Wan.

Everyone was here apart from Xia Ning Chang, who had to remain in the Star Boundary as a Great Grandmaster Alchemist.

“You all must have had a hard time,” Yang Kai said, ashamed.

When the Suppressing Black Ink Army had been formed, Mi Jing Lun wanted these women to join it. At the time, intense fights were happening across the Great Territory Battlefields and the situation out there was incredibly dangerous. On the other hand, the Suppressing Black Ink Army was only in charge of standing guard over the Grand Restriction, so the risks were much lower.

Mi Jing Lun had done so as a favour to Yang Kai.

Alas, even Mi Jing Lun could not predict the changes that would happen many years later. He did not expect the Suppressing Black Ink Army would end up in such a crisis. He never would have thought that they would be sucked into the Grand Restriction and run the risk of being exterminated if they did not have Wu Kuang’s protection.

Mi Jing Lun had been under a lot of pressure when he heard that the situation at the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction had changed and the Suppressing Black Ink Army could be in a disastrous situation.

He did not know how he was going to face Yang Kai if the Suppressing Black Ink Army had been annihilated.

“Everyone is having a hard time right now, not just us,” Yu Ru Meng took Yang Kai’s hand and gently held it. Her voice was soft as she soothed, “You don’t need to worry about us. We’re all together and we can look out for one another. You just need to focus on what you have to do.”

Su Yan spoke up next, “That’s right. We are a part of the Army and doing our part to eradicate the Black Ink Clan. We’re not weak flowers that need constant protection. You don’t need to worry too much about us.”

Shan Qing Luo smiled, “As long as you don’t think that we’re a burden, Husband!”

Yang Kai chuckled, “Why would I think you’re a burden? You’re all my most precious treasures!”

Ji Yao and the more reserved women immediately blushed at how frank Yang Kai was, but their gazes softened with affection.

Yang Kai’s three Legacy Disciples were gathered nearby as well. Xu Yi was looking at Yang Kai with a look of admiration as he exclaimed, “That’s our Honoured Master, alright! He’s indeed amazing. Looks like I’ll have to work hard to follow in his footsteps.”

A sharp hiss suddenly rang out.

Xu Yi hastily turned around, “What’s the matter, Eldest Senior Brother?”

Zhao Ye Bai had been the one who gasped.

Zhao Ye Bai was rubbing his waist as he stared innocently at Zhao Ya, “Why did you pinch me, Xiao Ya?”

“No reason. I just felt like pinching you!” Zhao Ya huffed.

“Oh…”

Xu Yi eyed Zhao Ye Bai pitifully, but in the end, he could not resist giving a reminder, “Eldest Senior Brother, as Honoured Master’s First Disciple, you should learn from him and live up to his expectations!”

Zhao Ye Bai gave it some serious thought and nodded, “You’re right. I’ve reached a bottleneck in my cultivation of the Dao of Space. This is a rare opportunity. I must ask Honoured Master for some guidance later.”

Xu Yi gaped and realised his Eldest Senior Brother was a hopeless case as he muttered, “The Grand Dao isn’t the only thing you can learn from Honoured Master, Eldest Senior Brother…”

“Why did you pinch me again, Xiao Ya?”

“It makes me happy!”

“En…”

There were endless thoughts and feelings of longing to express now that the long-awaited reunion had finally occurred.

Still, it was not the time or place to dwell on such things. The women were wise and sensible enough, so once they all had a brief chat with Yang Kai, Yu Ru Meng led them away.

Yang Kai fell into a reverie as he watched them leave.

“Big Brother,” Yang Xue’s voice called out next. She and others like Zhao Ye Bai had been waiting to the side the whole time and only came over once Yu Ru Meng and the other Wives left.

“A-Adoptive Father!” Yang Xiao called out as well.

Yang Kai turned around and smiled at Yang Xue. He stroked her head as he said, “Your Big Brother has spent all this time running around everywhere and rarely had a moment to stop to take a break. I’ve always considered it a pity that I couldn’t spend time with you when you were young. Please don’t hold it against me.”

Yang Xue grinned and said, “I wouldn’t, of course. Ever since I was a child, I knew that you were destined for great things, Big Brother. Mother and Father praised you all the time, and when I was young, I dreamed about becoming someone like you. Based on cultivation alone, I think I’ve done well enough,” then, she lifted her chin slightly and added, “You need to work harder, Big Brother. Don’t let your Little Sister surpass you.”
