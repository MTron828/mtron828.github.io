Chapter 741, Grand Sea Ship

Atop the ocean, an iceberg the size of a small room drifted along with the waves. Atop this iceberg, Yang Kai sat comfortably cross-legged.

After having found Su Yan and learning that Meng Wu Ya and Little Senior Sister were safe and sound, he felt a lot easier.

Although he had not taken Su Yan away with him and instead left her in Ice Sect, with the help of Qing Ya, Su Yan would only grow stronger. The next time they met, Yang Kai figured Su Yan’s strength would have noticeably increased. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Feeling happy, Yang Kai didn’t hurry along and simply let the iceberg drift wherever it wanted to, pushing his True Qi only enough to make sure it stayed upright.

Now that he had no immediate worries, Yang Kai figured he should return to Soaring Heaven Sect and quickly improve his Alchemy proficiency so he could refine the Saint Pill needed to free the Ancient Demon Clan before finally returning to Coffin Slave Senior’s hiding place in the Snow Mountain Range.

After receiving guidance from Old Man Li, Yang Kai’s understandings and insights into the Alchemic Way had improved notably. He also fully realized the superiority of using his Conflagrated Knowledge Sea to perform Alchemy rather than his True Qi.

On top of that, after having dual cultivated with Su Yan, his Soul had undergone a kind of sublimation, coupled with the various experiences he had absorbed thanks to the Demon Eye of Annihilation, Yang Kai had gained some new and significant insights.

Sitting atop the iceberg, Yang Kai immersed himself in comprehending the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao, various thoughts and ideas flitting across his consciousness.

As these thoughts intertwined and combined together with his own experiences, Yang Kai’s expression and mood gradually became reflective.

The sea was vast and boundless, and Yang Kai did not encounter any interruptions, so he gradually forgot the passage of time and even where he was or where he was going and became immersed in his own thoughts.

Beneath the iceberg, gigantic marine animals would swim by now and then, but Yang Kai had completely concealed his aura so all these beasts could sense was a small floating chunk of ice; naturally they didn’t cause him any trouble.

In the sky up above, scattered clouds drifted about, down below, the ocean waves undulated rhythmically. This was the first time since arriving in Tong Xuan Realm that Yang Kai truly felt content and connected with this world.

After a month or two, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes and let out a long breath, a big smile upon his face.

This period of enlightenment had brought him an improvement to his strength that was not small, while also allowing him to realize just how difficult it was to break through to the next Order of the Transcendent Realm.

It could be said that every Transcendent Realm master had experienced all kinds of hardships and struggled on the edge of life and death. Only after overcoming all of these challenges had they achieved a cultivation level that separated them from mere mortals.

Those who had failed to surpass these challenges had either been forever unable to break through that barrier or had died trying.

Among the new improvements Yang Kai had achieved this time was the various magical uses of his Conflagrated Knowledge Sea.

His Conflagrated Knowledge Sea was a type of mutation or evolution of an ordinary Knowledge Sea and was superior in almost every way, whether it was regarding offense, defense, or even investigating and deceiving others.

Yang Kai’s Spiritual Energy was powerful enough that once he covered his body in it, he could fool outsiders who tried to investigate him regarding his strength, thus causing them to underestimate or ignore him. This ability was an unexpected harvest that made Yang Kai pleasantly surprised.

After a little experimentation, Yang Kai found that this new ability was quite convenient to use, he only needed to restrain the flow of his True Qi and then use his Spiritual Energy to create some illusionary auras to deceive others.

However, Yang Kai estimated that this method would only be effective against those with weaker Spiritual Energy than him, those who had significantly more powerful Divine Senses would be able to see through this camouflage.

Still, Yang Kai was quite satisfied with his newfound ability.

Standing up atop the iceberg, Yang Kai stretched lazily before sweeping his eyes over the surrounding ocean.

Seeing nothing in every direction he looked, his expression immediately became grim as he cursed silently.

Although he had unconsciously avoided the dangers from sea beasts while he was in his state of enlightenment, Yang Kai had also been so completely absorbed in his contemplations that he had lost track of where he was.

Originally, his intention was to go back to Water Spirit Temple and see Shui Ling. This time, Shui Ling had helped him a great deal, and as one of Yang Kai’s few friends in this world, he had intended to thank her personally.

Afterwards, Yang Kai had planned to use Water Spirit Temple as a transit point on his journey back to Soaring Heaven Sect.

But now, he obviously couldn’t use that plan anymore.

Standing on the iceberg, after venting his annoyance for a while, Yang Kai eventually regained his composure and calmed down.

As long as he came across someone and obtained directions from them, he could understand where he was and where he needed to go. Considering this point, Yang Kai simply sat down, made himself comfortable, and stared out across the rolling sea.

The schools of fish swimming beneath the surface seemed full of vigor and vitality.

Yang Kai also spotted some colourful coral clusters as he swept his eyes around.

Three days later, as Yang Kai was staring lazily up at the clouds, he suddenly detected some life auras at the extreme range of his released Divine Sense.

Immediately perking up, Yang Kai stood up and stared off in the direction he had sensed the auras.

On the far horizon, a small black spot several kilometers away seemed to be slowly traveling forward.

Naturally, this black spot was a grand sea ship and even though it was far off, Yang Kai could still see the extraordinariness of it.

This grand ship was not solely comprised of wood and metal; instead, it also seemed to be refined from many precious ores in a manner similar to that of an artifact and obviously had impressive offensive and defensive abilities. Only such a vessel could withstand the violent attacks of giant sea beasts.

Yang Kai had seen many such boats back at Water Spirit Temple.

However, this particular ship was the most magnificent one Yang Kai had seen yet, its bow like a great dragon head that rose above the rough seas, breaking through the waves as it sailed forward at incredible speed.

Atop the big ship, many brightly colored flags fluttered in the wind.

Yang Kai estimated the speed and direction of the ship as well as that of the iceberg beneath his feet, soon figuring that the two would soon pass within a dozen kilometers of each other at this rate.

Increasing the output of his True Qi, Yang Kai sped his iceberg up in order to intercept the ship.

A moment later, Yang Kai took back his Divine Sense. Although he didn’t dare probe too much, he had basically confirmed that there were no Saint Realm masters on board the ship, there were however several Transcendents including a few Third Order masters.

With his Soul Devouring Insects in hand, Yang Kai stood atop his iceberg without any fear, calling out to the approaching ship, trying to attract the attention of the other party.

Sure enough, a short time later, a few figures appeared at the bow of the ship, staring and pointing in his direction, apparently having noticed Yang Kai’s presence.

However, from their indifferent demeanors, it was apparent they did not intend to pay Yang Kai any mind nor alter the speed or course of the ship they were riding.

Yang Kai’s brow wrinkled and watched as the big ship passed by him. Of course, he did not give up so easily. He was now lost at sea so he really had to find someone to ask directions from.

Hesitating for only a moment, Yang Kai made his decision and pushed his True Qi once more, rapidly increasing the speed of his iceberg and charging straight towards the ship.

The people on the ship’s deck immediately reacted, calling out in alarm.

Atop the big ship, the crew who were alerted by these calls ran up on deck to see what the matter was, including a Transcendent Realm powerhouse.

After learning what was going on, the Transcendent master angrily shouted, “A mere brat from who knows where acting so recklessly. Destroy the iceberg under his feet this instant! Actually daring to have ideas about my Holy Land’s ship? He really must not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth! En, don’t kill him yet, capture him so we can interrogate him first!”

With the order of the Transcendent Realm master being given, the disciples also struck out with righteous indignation, several of them standing at the ship’s bow immediately displaying their Martial Skills and artifacts.

*Shua Shua Shua* Several beams of light shot from the ship’s bow in the next instant.

Yang Kai was stunned, never having expected the other party to react so violently, quickly leaping off his iceberg to avoid the barrage.

With a loud bang, the iceberg that had carried Yang Kai across the sea for the past two months was reduced to dust.

As they watched small chunks of ice scatter across the surface of the sea, all the people onboard the boat looked around carefully for Yang Kai’s figure, but no matter where they looked they saw nothing put blue ocean.

“Where did he go?” The Transcendent Realm master also lost track of Yang Kai at that moment and unable to immediately find where he had disappeared, his expression became ugly.

Everyone else on the deck also shook their heads.

One of the disciples spoke up, “Wasn’t he killed in that explosion? From what I could see, he looked quite young and probably wasn’t very strong.”

“Nonsense!” The Transcendent shouted, “Since he dared to wander the sea alone, he must at least have an Immortal Ascension Boundary cultivation. On top of that, if he was really killed, why is there no blood on the surface? That brat is hiding somewhere, look more carefully.”

“There’s no need for that,” A slightly annoyed voice suddenly came from the side of the ship, and in the next moment, a wet Yang Kai jumped up onto the deck, frowning unhappily at the people on the boat as he muttered, “There is no enmity or grudge between us, so why did you suddenly attack me?”

“We didn’t attack you, we simply destroyed the iceberg you were floating on!” The Transcendent Realm master coldly snorted, “If we really wanted to harm you, do you think you’d still be able to stand here safely?”

Yang Kai frowned and didn’t say anything.

The few attacks a moment ago, he had seen clearly, so he knew they really weren’t aimed at him and possessed not killing intent. Perhaps it was his actions had been misunderstood by these people resulting in this situation.

Of course, Yang Kai never intended to hit their ship with his iceberg.

But there was also no use in explaining this now, so Yang Kai simply didn’t bother saying anything.

“Brat, I’ll ask you a few questions, you answer honestly, if you dare to deceive me, I’ll throw you overboard to feed the fish,” The Transcendent Realm cultivator quickly said.

Yang Kai nodded, circulating his True Qi slightly to dry his clothes before trying to make himself appear as docile as possible.

“Who are you, why are you floating on an iceberg above the sea?”

“This Junior is just a nameless person, I accidentally lost my way at sea and had no choice but the settle down on that iceberg or else it would have drowned long ago.”

“Hmph!” The man coldly snorted, Yang Kai not replying to his question directly obviously made him feel somewhat unsatisfied.

“Then why did you seeking out my Holy Land’s vessel just now?”

“I had no choice; I have been drifting for many days so when I saw your ship, I wanted to ask for directions. En, actually, if it is convenient, could you possibly let me sail along with you until we reach dry land?”
