Occupying someone else’s headquarters without even informing them was a very serious issue. Although the Nine Heavens Holy Land had been empty for many years, it didn’t mean that one could occupy it at will. In case Yang Kai chose to look into it, Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai would not be able to compensate for it with their deaths, no matter how many lives they had.

So, after they came to know Yang Kai’s identity, Lin Yu Hao had immediately decided to withdraw.

“Why? You don’t have to leave,” Yang Kai chuckled.

But Lin Yu Hao looked horrified. He immediately tried to explain, “Holy Master Yang, Brother Yi and I had no idea that you were still in Tong Xuan Realm. We thought you had...”

“You don’t have to explain. Well, I don’t mean to make trouble for you,” Yang Kai waved his hand and interrupted him before adding in an indifferent manner. “If you like this place, I can gift you the Nine Heavens Holy Land.”

“Gift us!?” The two were really dumbstruck this time. They had no idea what Yang Kai was cooking. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“That’s right, gift you.” Yang Kai nodded. “But you have to do something for me.”

Lin Yu Hao sunk into silence for a moment before asking cautiously, “I wonder what we can do for you. Holy Master Yang, can you please elaborate.”

“It’s nothing big. You don’t have to be so nervous.” Yang Kai smiled kindly. “You just have to keep watch on this place, stopping any outsiders from coming in at will. I will be arranging a Spirit Array here, and you just have to guard that Spirit Array in the future.”

“So simple!?” Yi Zheng Kai was extremely surprised.

“It’s just that simple.” Yang Kai nodded. “Of course, I don’t like forcing anyone. If you don’t want to, then forget it. I will find someone else.”

Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai glanced at each other. They were finding it rather difficult to make up their minds.

Even though Yang Kai looked calm and relaxed when he mentioned this, they knew that the Spirit Array should be of absolute importance. If they couldn’t guard it well, they would just be offending Yang Kai for no reason, and judging by the strength Yang Kai had just displayed, it was not a responsibility they could bear.

The two exchanged glances and conversed with their Divine Senses for a long time, but they couldn’t reach an agreement.

“Oh, you two seem reluctant. If that’s the case, then forget it, I’ll look for someone else. It doesn’t matter if their cultivation is low, I will give them some artifacts, pills, and Secret Arts. That will be enough to guard this place,” While speaking, Yang Kai turned around to leave.

“Wait!” Lin Yu Hao stopped him at once. A serious look appeared on his face as he said, “Holy Master Yang, please wait. We have already decided.”

“Really?” Yang Kai turned and looked at them.

“Yes,” Yi Zheng Kai hurriedly nodded his agreement. “Back then, Holy Master Yang commanded the masters of three races and confronted the Bone Race, defending the continent. Although our cultivation is low, we have received Holy Master Yang’s guidance. We don’t want to just drag out our ignoble existence anymore. We would like to contribute to the peace of this continent.”

“We might not have an idea what Spirit Array Holy Master Yang wants us to guard, but since it’s laid by Holy Master Yang, it must be related to the safety of the continent. It’s our duty, and we can’t decline it, so please leave it to us, Holy Master Yang!” Lin Yu Hao said in a loud and sonorous voice.

“You don’t need to force yourselves.” Yang Kai rubbed his forehead, “I don’t like to force others. It will be very boring to guard the Spirit Array here. You might even need to guard it for generations.”

“Why would that be difficult?” Yi Zheng Kai proudly said, “Brother Lin and I don’t like to hustle and bustle, we like to keep away from distracting thoughts and desires. The Holy Land is beautiful and rich in World Energy. It would be a great honour for us to stay here, so how can it be boring?”

“Brother Yi is right.” Lin Yu Hao nodded with an earnest look. “This seems to be very important. If Holy Master Yang has no candidates, I hope Holy Master Yang can consider us two brothers.”

“But your cultivation is a little low.” Yang Kai rubbed his chin as if he was being picky.

“We aren’t that old. Also, we have broken past the Saint Realm. We will grow stronger as long as we keep on cultivating.” Lin Yu Hao eagerly looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai pondered for a long while before he heaved a sigh and said, “Forget it! Since you insist so much, this Holy Master would entrust you with this important task. I hope you don’t take it lightly, you must guard this place well.”

“Holy Master Yang, don’t worry. As long as we two are alive, no outsider can set foot in Holy Land. If anyone dares to force themselves in, we will stop and kill them within five steps!” Lin Yu Hao said in a low and deep voice.

“Great! I like this kind of determination. Then, I will leave the Holy Land to you two, I hope you will pay more attention to it.”

Yi Zheng Kai and Li Yu Hao were overjoyed upon hearing this. The former put a grin on his face and said, “Holy Master Yang, you mentioned gifting some Secret Techniques and pills. I...”

“And Secret Arts... Cough Cough...” Lin Yu Hao coughed in embarrassment.

“I’ll find something suitable for you,” having said this, Yang Kai rummaged through his Space Ring.

There were many things in his Space Ring, looted after killing his enemies. Naturally, there was no shortage for Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai. After a while, Yang Kai took out a few Saint King Grade artifacts and numerous Spirit Pills. He also taught them two suitable cultivation techniques and few Secret Techniques and Martial Skills.

The two had never seen Saint King Grade artifacts and pills, or the Secret Arts and Secret Techniques that seemed to be tailor-made for them. They could not hold their excitement.

Although they pursued free and easy life, every cultivator yearned for stronger and higher Martial Dao.

Yang Kai seemed to have opened another door for them.

After rejoicing, Yi Zheng Kai seemed to have thought of something. He immediately notified in a solemn voice, “By the way, Holy Master Yang, many things have happened in Tong Xuan Realm this year. A group of foreign cultivators had been wreaking havoc. I wonder whether Holy Master Yang would get rid of them?”

“You don’t have to worry about this. I have already punished their leader. As for the remaining trash, my companion is cleaning them up. Peace and order will return to the continent in a few days,” Yang Kai calmly said.

Having heard Yang Kai speak of it in such a dismissive manner, Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai were extremely shocked.

They might not have any idea about how powerful these outsiders were, but judging by the fact that they could destroy and enslave those great forces, Tong Xuan Realm cultivators definitely could not resist these outsiders. But much to their surprise and horror, these very outsiders were completely powerless before Yang Kai and would be wiped clean in just a few days.

The two immediately realized Yang Kai’s strength in disguise.

“Hmm, you two have just advanced. If you don’t know anything about your current realm, you can ask me. I will explain it to you.” Yang Kai wasn’t in a hurry to arrange the Cross-Cultivation Star Space Array. Since he wanted Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai to guard this place, he would naturally make them stronger. Therefore, he intended to help them.

Lin Yu Hao was taken by surprise. He immediately asked, “I hope Holy Master Yang can explain to us what realm we are actually in? Although we can feel that we have already surpassed Saint Realm, we are still at a loss.”

“Mhmm, due to Tong Xuan Realm thin World Energy, Saint Realm is the highest anyone can generally reach and it’s natural that you don’t understand this. Your current realm is called the Saint King Realm, a realm above the Saint!”

“Above the Saint Realm!” Both were dumbstruck.

Over the next few hours, Yang Kai systematically taught Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai of the division of upper realms in the Martial Dao, and also explained to them the matters they should pay attention to during cultivation. The two kept nodding over these hours. They had received a lot of benefits.

Only after half a day did Yang Kai ask them to withdraw and consolidate their current realm. Meanwhile, he began to look for a suitable place to arrange the Cross-Cultivation Star Space Array.

More than ten days later, the Cross-Cultivation Star Space Array had taken shape in the Holy Land. Yang Kai, after making the final adjustments, poured his Saint Qi into it. The Array immediately started running, shining with dazzling white light and overflowing with an intense Space Force.

“It can really connect to Azure Tree Star!” Yang Kai looked surprised, “It looks like these Space Spirit Crystals from the Severed World are indeed extraordinary.”

He wasn’t sure that the Cross-Cultivation Star Space Array would connect to the one in the Azure Tree Star Palace, but after finishing it, he discovered that it was powerful enough to do so. The two Cross-Cultivation Star Space Arrays resonated with each other as they established a mysterious connection in the void.

All of this was due to those pure Space Spirit Crystals. If he didn’t bring them from the Severed World and look for them outside, perhaps he would not have been able to achieve this.

“Isn’t this a Space Array?” Gui Zu appeared beside Yang Kai like a ghost. His eyes were glued to the Array before him, incredibly surprised.

“Mhmm, it’s a Space Array.” Yang Kai nodded his affirmation.

In fact, Gui Zu had arrived at Nine Heavens Holy Land a few days ago, it was just that Yang Kai was busy, so the former didn’t bother him until now.

After circling around the Space Array a few times, Gui Zu shook his head and praised, “It’s really amazing. I’m afraid this Old Man will never be able to understand its mystery! This Old Man deserved to be trapped on the floating continent for two thousand years. Where can this Array teleport?”

“Azure Tree Star.”

“What!?” Gui Zu stood slack-jawed. “You mean... Azure Tree Star? The same Azure Tree Star of the Sword Union!?”

“Indeed!”

“We are hundreds of millions of kilometres away from Azure Tree Star. Can just this one Space Array...?”

“There is not just this one. There are other Space Arrays in-between the two, that’s why the connection could be achieved,” Yang Kai explained a little, but Gui Zu still couldn’t believe it.

That was billions of kilometres away. Even with his cultivation, it would take almost a year to fly there, but now, this distance was narrowed to zero by two Space Arrays.

“Well, what’s the result of Elder’s action?” Yang Kai looked at Gui Zu and asked.

“All killed.” Gui Zu grinned. “I also seized an Origin Grade High-Rank Starship! This Spirit Devouring Sect is really rich.”

“Excellent! What about the Spirit Devouring Crystals!?” Yang Kai looked at him with a happy smile.

Gui Zu immediately grew vigilant and said, “What do you mean? Those are this Elder’s trophies. Even if it’s Sect Master, you can’t ask for it like this.”

“Don’t be so serious, Elder. The energy in these Spirit Devouring Crystals belongs to this continent, it’s reasonable to return it. Be good and give me those Spirit Devouring Crystals. Besides, they won’t be of much help to you. They might improve your strength but I’m afraid it would make your foundation unstable, and I don’t think Elder would like that.”
