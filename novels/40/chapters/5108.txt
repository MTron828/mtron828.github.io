The instant Yang Kai was attacked, he responded with his sabre. Hei Yuan’s consciousness promptly backed off, but he couldn’t be as quick as the sabre light.

Struck by the sabre light, Hei Yuan groaned in pain like an injured beast. His powerful consciousness weakened in an instant and it was obvious that he was wounded.

As horror overwhelmed him, thinking that he was doomed, Hei Yuan heard something crack. As his consciousness refocused, he realised that the sabre in the hands of Yang Kai’s Avatar had shattered upon impact.

An elated Hei Yuan roared at the Feudal Lords who were running away, “His weapon has been destroyed! Do not fear!”

Upon hearing that, the Feudal Lords turned around and realised that, just like what Hei Yuan had said, the sabre in Yang Kai’s hands had fallen apart for some reason. In an instant, they become energised.

The consciousnesses were all essentially naked, so the Feudal Lords were stunned when they saw Yang Kai summoning a sabre.

After Hei Yuan was done barking, he madly activated his power and charged towards Yang Kai. Seeing that, the Feudal Lords promptly assisted him.

At that moment, Yang Kai was immensely pressured.

In the end, the Soul Splitting Saber was just an Emperor Artifact. Although it had been nurtured in his Soul over the years, its original quality couldn’t be changed. It couldn’t bear the power of Yang Kai’s Spiritual Energy, so three strikes had been its limit. Therefore, before Yang Kai could kill all of his enemies, the sabre broke apart.

Presently, with Hei Yuan leading the charge, the attacks from the Feudal Lords’ consciousnesses came right at Yang Kai in a continuous manner from all directions. Regardless of how powerful Yang Kai’s Soul was, he couldn’t possibly bear such a bombardment.

Seeing that Yang Kai’s consciousness became immobile, as though it had been suppressed, the Feudal Lords struck their opponent harder, determined to take him down.

Yang Kai was aware that he was in an unfavourable position. It had to be said that the Black Ink Clan had come up with a brilliant method to deal with him. In such a place, Space Principles were practically useless. This was purely a contest of the strength of their Spiritual Energy.

He had to quickly come up with a solution; otherwise, he would be doomed.

At the most critical moment, Yang Kai realised that since he could summon the Soul Splitting Saber to this place, what about the Soul Warming Lotus? The Soul Warming Lotus was a Supreme Treasure, so if he could summon it, there wouldn’t be any suspense regarding the outcome of this battle.

However, he had never summoned the Soul Warming Lotus to fight his enemies before. Usually, he would only counterattack when others attempted to invade his Knowledge Sea, so the idea of summoning it hadn’t crossed his mind.

As he thought about this, a seven-coloured light burst from his figure.

When the Feudal Lords, who were bombarding Yang Kai with their attacks, saw the light, they were bewildered. Hei Yuan had no idea what was going on either, but through his battles with Yang Kai, he came to realise that this Human had all sorts of tricks up his sleeve; therefore, the moment the seven-coloured light appeared, he felt that something was off and promptly shouted, “Take him down, now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he focused all of his power and charged towards Yang Kai. At this moment, he had no choice but to ignore the Royal Lord’s order that Yang Kai had to be captured alive. Whether Yang Kai could survive this strike would depend on his luck.

Invisible attacks came right at Yang Kai from all directions and drowned him; however, the seven-coloured light only became brighter and soon filled the space.

A moment later, the storm subsided as the originally noisy space fell silent. A lotus that radiated a light of seven colours abruptly appeared in the place where Yang Kai previously stood. The lotus spun gently, exuding an aura that the Black Ink Clansmen coveted.

“What is that?” One of the puzzled Feudal Lords asked. Although he had no idea what this seven-coloured lotus was, he could clearly feel that it was hugely beneficial to any Black Ink Clansman who could possess it.

“Where is he?” There was another Feudal Lord who was concerned about Yang Kai’s whereabouts. Other than the seven-coloured lotus sitting in the place where Yang Kai previously stood, the Human himself was nowhere in sight.

“I suppose he’s dead. Although he is strong, he couldn’t possibly survive that bombardment.”

“Well done! That Human was too arrogant as he had no regard for us. He deserved his death!”

…..

Besides these Feudal Lords, Hei Yuan also believed that Yang Kai had perished. Yang Kai had indeed showcased powerful Spiritual Energy, but regardless of how formidable he was, he couldn’t possibly stave off the joint attack of all the Feudal Lords and Hei Yuan.

However, if Yang Kai was really killed, how was Hei Yuan going to explain himself to the Royal Lord?

This was giving Hei Yuan a headache. Also, what was this seven-coloured lotus that Yang Kai had left behind?

While he was puzzled, the flower petals of the spinning seven-coloured lotus started to unfurl, and as that happened, a figure revealed itself. Seated among the stamens, this person radiated a vague glow.

Upon making out the person’s face, Hei Yuan was shocked.

That was because not only wasn’t Yang Kai dead, he wasn’t even wounded!

[How can this be?]

He might have been lucky enough to have survived the bombardment of attacks, but how was it possible that he wasn’t injured at all? Could the strange lotus have blocked all their attacks?

Before Hei Yuan could figure it out, Yang Kai’s Soul power burst forth. The power of this Soul was as magnificent as the ocean and as profound as the abyss. As the mass of Spiritual Energy increased in intensity, the special space started trembling.

“It wouldn’t be polite if I didn’t offer a gift in return! Please accept this!”

The moment the clear voice reverberated across the space, clearly discernible Spirit Energy turned into visible sabre lights that pointed in all directions as they hovered above Yang Kai’s head.

Faced with the sabre lights, the Feudal Lords felt chills running down their spines.

As soon as Yang Kai finished speaking, the Spiritual Energy sabre lights shot out in all directions and mercilessly rained down on them.

The Feudal Lords were horrified as they all scrambled to escape or defend themselves.

Nevertheless, their efforts were futile. As the sabre lights swept across the space, half of the Feudal Lords’ consciousnesses were destroyed. Even Hei Yuan was struck by two sabre lights and roared in pain. The surviving Feudal Lords’ consciousnesses all trembled in fear.

Hei Yuan knew that if they let Yang Kai attack again, all of the Black Ink Clansmen here would be killed. Yang Kai’s Soul was unimaginably powerful. Besides that, he had a lot of special offensive skills when it came to the Soul, something that the Black Ink Clan were not aware of previously.

The attacks of Hei Yuan and the Feudal Lords were all blocked by the seven-coloured lotus. As a result, Yang Kai wasn’t harmed one bit.

Now, Hei Yuan could confirm that the reason Yang Kai was safe earlier was that the latter had this strange seven-coloured lotus. He wondered what kind of treasure it was that could defend against so many Spiritual Energy attacks. Even a Territory Lord like him was unable to hurt Yang Kai despite having personally made a move.

The defensive strength of the seven-coloured lotus was simply impenetrable. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

With the protection of the seven-coloured Soul Warming Lotus, Yang Kai had no more worries. As his Spiritual Energy condensed into another attack, he slashed out at the surviving Black Ink Clansmen.

More and more of the Feudal Lords’ were eliminated, and inside the Feudal Lord Black Ink Nests in Kong Chan’s territory, numerous bodies passed out and collapsed to the ground. These Feudal Lords no longer reacted regardless of how loud the other Black Ink Clansmen called out to them.

Within moments, fewer than 5 of the original 30 Feudal Lord remained. These consciousnesses were running about madly as Yang Kai relentlessly chased after them, completely powerless to counterattack. Hei Yuan’s aura was also weakening by the breath.

It was not possible to use any kind of technique in a pure clash of Spiritual Energy, so in such a place, it was hard for Hei Yuan to use his formidable strength.

Finally, one of the Feudal Lords shouted, “Sir Hei Yuan, we can’t persevere any longer. Please open this space; otherwise, all of us will die!”

Hei Yuan was unperturbed though, for he firmly believed that the seven-coloured lotus wasn’t as impenetrable as it seemed. He thought that by exerting more force with his attacks, he could shatter the lotus’ defence. However, his goal was still not achieved after so many of the Feudal Lords’ consciousnesses perished.

Regardless, their defeat in this place didn’t mean that the Black Ink Clan had lost. They still had a chance to turn things around.

That was because the moment Yang Kai entered this space through the Black Ink Nest’s power, Hei Yuan managed to ascertain his whereabouts.

This could be achieved easily, for Yang Kai made use of a Feudal Lord’s Black Ink Nest to come into this space. Just by finding out which Black Ink Nest it was, Hei Yuan could effortlessly discover where Yang Kai was.

After all, the Fiefs and Black Ink Nests of the Feudal Lords were fixed.

Therefore, the moment Yang Kai’s consciousness entered this space, Hei Yuan ordered more than 10 Feudal Lords to rush over to Yang Kai’s location.

Hei Yuan’s initial plan was to damage Yang Kai’s consciousness so that this team could easily capture him in a weakened state.

However, things were not going to plan. Not only was Yang Kai not injured, but he had also made use of a seven-coloured lotus to commit a massacre. They were not in a favourable position in this special space, so it was inevitable that so many Feudal Lords’ consciousnesses were wiped out.

Nevertheless, as long as Yang Kai’s consciousness was trapped here, he couldn’t return to his body, and the team that Hei Yuan had sent would soon capture Yang Kai.

That was the reason Hei Yuan refused to open this space despite the fact that so many Feudal Lords were injured or dead.

There was still a ray of hope for them to turn things around.

With that said, regardless of how swift the team of Feudal Lords were, it would take them at least four hours to arrive at the Black Ink Nest where Yang Kai was located.

Could Hei Yuan persevere for another four hours?

He had no idea, but he knew that there were not a lot of Feudal Lords’ consciousnesses left. Once they were all dead, he would have to face Yang Kai alone.

Despite the fact that a lot of Feudal Lords were killed, Hei Yuan continuously channelled his power to attack the seven-coloured lotus in the hope that he could shatter its defence.

There was no doubt that the outcome was disappointing for him, as the Seven-Coloured Soul Warming Lotus was so impregnable that even a Territory Lord like him couldn’t hope to destroy it.
