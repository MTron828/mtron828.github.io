Back in the medicine valley, Zi Dong had been humiliated by Yang Kai three times, but Zi Dong had nowhere to vent his anger because the Seven Coloured Radiant Light everywhere.

Anger, however, was just like wine: The more it fermented over time, the stronger it became...

Zi Dong could not wait to drink Yang Kai’s blood and eat Yang Kai’s flesh...

Sitting in the Shattering Void Shuttle, Zi Dong was already imagining the wonderful scene where he caught Yang Kai and tortured him to death. Just thinking about it caused a peal of low laughter to leak from his lips and a crazy light to flash across his eyes.

When this laughter entered Xu Wei’s ears, he could not help but shiver. He did not know what this idiot Zi Dong was thinking to cause him to make such a disgusting laugh, and he didn’t dare to ask, simply turning his head away and focusing on pouring his Saint Qi into the Spirit Array below him.

“What the hell is that?” Yang Kai, who had been fleeing a few thousand kilometres ahead, also noticed the anomaly behind him at this moment.

Although he could not see the Shattering Void Shuttle itself, it was obvious that his pursuer’s purple light had disappeared, but the distance between them was closing!

Less than ten breaths later, the gap had narrowed a thousand kilometres!

If things continued like this, it would not take less than a stick of incense before he was caught. Yang Kai was startled, and a gloomy look appeared on his face.

In this situation, he could only rely on his Space Force, but Space Force was not inexhaustible, it was similar to Saint Qi and Divine Sense, needing time to restore after being overdrawn.

At this moment, Yang Kai was still trying to restore himself.

But seeing Zi Long quickly catching up, how could Yang Kai just sit and do nothing? Gritting his teeth, Yang Kai took a Space Spirit Crystal out of the Sealed World Bead, held it in his hand, and began to draw energy madly from it.

This Space Spirit Crystal was one of the ones he found in The Void of the Severed World, a true Space Spirit Crystal. It was the product of The Void and completely different from the ones found in mineral lodes.

A stream of pure and profound power poured into Yang Kai’s body, giving him a sense of euphoria.

His Space Force, which had originally been used up, was replenished at an extremely rapid speed.

“Trying to compete with me in speed? Eat my dust!” Yang Kai felt that there was nothing wrong with him besides his chest wound, which would take some time to restore, so he quickly pushed his Space Force and flickered forward a few hundred kilometres.

Repeating the process, he teleported another few hundred kilometres.

Now that his understanding of Space Force had reached a new high, the distance he could cross instantly was countless times higher than before.

After mobilizing his Space Force several times, the distance between the two parties had increased once again.

“What?” Inside the Shattering Void Shuttle, Zi Dong, who had been soothing his rage by thinking of how he would torture Yang Kai, was taken aback and almost bit his tongue as he was shocked to find the distance between them had pulled apart again.

“Even the Shattering Void Shuttle can’t keep up with his speed?” Zi Long was also shocked.

The refining method of the Shattering Void Shuttle was obtained by an Ancestor of Purple Star from the Great Emperor personally, and although their skills in Artifact Refining weren’t high enough to complete this shuttle properly, it was still one of the Great Emperor’s designs. How could it possibly be inferior?

Zi Long was certain that the Shattering Void Shuttle was the fastest artifact in the entire Star Field, nothing else should be comparable.

But now, reality had slapped him in the face.

In front of Yang Kai, who was proficient in the Dao of Space, even if they used the Shattering Void Shuttle, they could still only eat his dust from afar...

No, they may not even be able to east his dust.

“This boy must be killed as soon as possible! Otherwise, he will only bring us endless troubles!” Zi Long’s heart shook as a determined look appeared on his face.

The next moment, he shouted at Xu Wei, “Xu Wei, why are you still holding back? Why aren’t you using your full strength?”

Xu Wei’s face twitched as his heart filled with bitterness.

Just sitting on this Spirit Array made him feel as if his life was being drawn away, that his Saint Qi was flowing from his body like a raging river.

But now, Zi Long actually told him to pour all his strength out; how was that different from killing him?

“Xu Wei, so you’ve been holding back this whole time. Do you want to die!?” Zi Dong roared furiously as he glared at Xu Wei.

“Mercy, Young Master! Mercy! Old Servant will go all out!” Xu Wei caught the look in Zi Dong’s eyes and began leaking cold sweat. He knew that he would really lose his life if he dared to talk back.

This little bastard was not someone who could be reasoned with.

Not daring to hesitate, Xu Wei pushed his Saint Qi madly into the Spirit Array.

With a hum, the Shattering Void Shuttle’s speed increased sharply.

“Hah, so quick! Let’s see that little bastard escape this time!” Zi Dong madly shouted.

A few thousand kilometres ahead, Yang Kai frowned, “It can actually speed up? Interesting, if that is the case, it might actually be able to keep up with me. Hm, looking at it from up close though, it looks somewhat familiar... like the small Starship refined by Yang Yan.”

Deep down in his heart, he was puzzled, obviously not knowing that the refinement method for the Shattering Void Shuttle really did stem from Yang Yan’s hand.

However, Purple Star’s ability really was far inferior to Yang Yan’s, making the Shattering Void Shuttle incomparable to the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle.

The Starships refined by Yang Yan could truly shatter The Void after all.

For a time, a grand chase played out across the Star Field.

As time passed, Yang Kai’s injuries gradually healed.

His physique was already extremely powerful, and his Golden Blood had a terrifying restorative ability, so even if he did not do anything, the wounds he suffered from the Divine Bird slowly repaired themselves.

Yang Kai was a unique case in this sense. If it had been any other cultivator, even if they did not lose their life, such injuries would have left them at least half-crippled.

After his injuries healed, Yang Kai became more relaxed. He used his Star Shuttle in an unhurried manner, and when he noticed the Shattering Void Shuttle drawing too close, he would simply skip across space a few times to open some distance before using his Star Shuttle again, slowing down and allowing his pursuers to catch up.

This obvious fishing behaviour almost caused Zi Long and Zi Dong to cough up blood in anger.

After so many days of pursuit, both father and son had blue veins throbbing on their foreheads.

As for Xu Wei, his figure now barely looked like a living human!

Only after some time did he realize that what was being extracted by the Spirit Array was not just his Saint Qi, but also his very essence!

A cultivator’s essence was similar to a Cultivation Star’s Source. Once this essence was consumed, their vitality drained, it would be extremely difficult to supplement!

Xu Wei had wanted to give it up a long time ago, but because of Zi Dong’s despotic power, he did not dare to leave the Spirit Array and could only grit his teeth and persist. Constantly taking pills to supplement his losses, Xu Wei accepted the Spirit Array’s wanton extraction.

The current Xu Wei no longer looked like a healthy middle-aged man, but instead like a malnourished beggar, his black hair now grey, making him look old and senile.

He never dreamed that an Origin King like himself would fall into such a desolate state.

His resentment towards Zi Long and his son was overwhelming!

Even so, Zi Dong was still not satisfied with his performance and constantly cursed him as trash and a waste.

From Zi Dong’s point of view, the reason why the Shattering Void Shuttle was unable to catch up to Yang Kai was all because Xu Wei was useless. If it were not for Xu Wei being so weak, they would have already succeeded and returned to Purple Star to celebrate rather than being stuck following behind Yang Kai’s ass.

“Xu Wei, take this,” Zi Long suddenly took out a pill from his Space Ring and tossed it to Xu Wei.

Xu Wei opened his turbid eyes, took a look, and couldn’t help trembling slightly as he reflexively asked, “What pill is this?”

This pill was a blood-red colour and had a strong bloody aura coming from it. The aura of this pill was somewhat nauseating and there seemed to be a violent force contained within it.

Xu Wei did not dare to take it lightly. Right now, he was akin to a dried-up oil lamp, so any accident now could kill him.

“You were told to take it so take it. Why utter so much nonsense?” Zi Dong yelled, but when he saw the pill itself, his eyes flashed with imperceptible reluctance.

Xu Wei noticed this change though and immediately understood that this pill was likely something quite precious.

“Sovereign Blood Pill!” Zi Long quickly answered.

The next instant, Xu Wei’s eyes bulged before he snatched the Sovereign Blood Pill and stuffed it into his mouth without any hesitation.

Xu Wei let out a cough as a wave of vitality burst from his thin body and it gradually began to swell up.

His originally sallow skin began to become ruddy and his white hair turned black again at a speed visible to the naked eye.

“Haha!” Xu Wei let out a loud laugh as he suddenly became vigorous again, like he was several hundred years younger in an instant.

“Xu Wei is extremely grateful for Senior Zi Long’s generosity. Senior and Young Master may rest assured, Old Servant will go all out!” Xu Wei said in a deep voice before immediately pushing his Saint Qi into the Spirit Array below.

Zi Long nodded lightly, a satisfied look appearing on his face.

The Sovereign Blood Pill was an Origin King Grade Spirit Pill that could only be refined by the single Origin King Grade Alchemist that belonged to Purple Star. Even as the Sect Master of Purple Star, Zi Long only ever obtained two in his lifetime, and this was the only one he had for the past hundred years. The other was used long ago to save Zi Long’s life at a critical moment.

Although the effect of this Spirit Pill was not on par with the legendary Immortal Source Liquid, it was still a Heaven-Defying treasure, which was apparent from the changes Xu Wei had just undergone.

If it weren’t for the urgency of the situation, how could Zi Long be willing to give Xu Wei such a precious Spirit Pill?

However, Xu Wei was indispensable to powering the Shattering Void Shuttle, so Zi Long could only give up this precious pill out of desperation.

Zi Long believed that, with the support of the Sovereign Blood Pill, Xu Wei would be able to persist for some time, and as long as he could catch Yang Kai, this sacrifice would be paid a million times over.

“Xu Wei, put your best into it. If this matter is successful, this King will have his son return your Soul Brand,” Zi Long said lightly.

Xu Wei’s body shook as a look of intense desire appeared on his face. Nodding, Xu Wei put even more effort into his task. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He was an Origin King, but now he was nothing but a slave to this little brat Zi Dong, completely destroying any face he had and ruining all his future prospects, but Zi Long’s words no doubt gave him new hope. As such, Xu Wei really no longer held back, just hoping he could catch up with Yang Kai as soon as possible to complete his task.
