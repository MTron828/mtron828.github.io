After leaving these words, Yang Kai closed his eyes and focused, making the best out of his time to restore his own strength.

Previously, when he swallowed a bunch of Spirit Pills, the medicinal effects were condensed inside his physique and meridians, but they had yet to be dissolved, causing a hindrance to his Source Qi circulation. What he needed to do right now was to refine all the medicinal effects completely and channel them into every part of his physique.

The Artifact Spirit was still outside the scope of the black flames, busy hammering itself with its War Hammer.

Time passed slowly, and after an hour, the Artifact Spirit had finally extinguished the clusters of flames on his body.

However, after experiencing them first-hand, the Artifact Spirit seemed to realize that these black flames were not something to be trifled with, so it simply stood outside roaring impatiently in an attempt to provoke Yang Kai, not daring to rush in.

Yang Kai ignored it and continued adjusting his breathing while meditating.

After another hour, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes, his face glowing a bit brighter, no longer looking weak and exhausted like before.

He straightened his body up and grinned at the Artifact Spirit, “You’re dead!”

“Hou!” The Artifact Spirit roared ferociously.

Yang Kai instantly teleported out of the black flames and pounced towards the Artifact Spirit, his eyes flashing as they stared directly into his opponent’s scarlet gaze.

“Look at me!” Yang Kai bellowed.

It wasn’t clear if the Artifact Spirit had understood him or not, but it instinctively lifted its head and looked at Yang Kai.

Their eyes met, and golden light flashed from Yang Kai’s left eye as he activated his Demon Eye of Annihilation, suppressing the Artifact Spirit.

The Artifact Spirit was paralyzed.

The illusionary shape of a sabre appeared abruptly in Yang Kai’s eye in the next moment, and soon this phantom blade was floating above the Knowledge Sea of the Artifact Spirit. The sabre was precisely crafted – with dragons and phoenixes carved onto its body, exuding a shockingly powerful aura.

It was the Soul Splitting Sabre!

This was the first time Yang Kai had used this Emperor Artifact after refining it.

The Artifact Spirit was an Emperor Artifact assuming human form, after all, so Yang Kai did not dare to underestimate it and quickly used his strongest Soul attack.

The Soul Splitting Sabre hummed as it released a brilliant halo from its blade and countless mysterious runes whirled around its body.

Yang Kai shouted, “Heaven Severing Slash!”

Just after his shout, the Soul Splitting Sabre slashed down fiercely.

“Hou!” The Artifact Spirit roared in pain, as if it had suffered a great deal of damage and its whole body flickered wildly, showing signs that it may collapse at any moment.

The Heaven Severing Slash was a Soul Secret Technique that Yang Kai learned from Tian Yan after all. During this time, he had been slowly nourishing the Soul Splitting Sabre according to the methods described in this Secret Technique, so the first blow he struck was extremely powerful.

However, due to the short time he had been nourishing the blade, and his own low cultivation, not to mention the fact that the Soul Splitting Sabre had yet to be fully refined by him, the power of this strike still had a lot of room for improvement.

But it was enough for now.

The Artifact Spirit stumbled and retreated with just one blow, without any strength to resist. The light that formed its body dimmed noticeably and began to crack apart.

However, it did not have the slightest fear and instead grew wilder, raising its War Hammer up high and charging towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and secretly felt that the situation was turning bad. In desperation, a lotus bud as white as snow emerged from his left eye.

“Blossoming Lotus!” The lotus bud flew out and appeared in the Artifact Spirit’s Knowledge Sea, slowly absorbing its Spiritual Energy in order to make itself bloom.

Yang Kai seemed to have played his last remaining card with the combination of the two Soul Secret Techniques and the Soul-type Emperor Artifact, finally halting the Artifact Spirit in place.

A line of golden blood slowly trickled down from Yang Kai’s left eye.

As the lotus flower gently bloomed, the light of the Artifact Spirit’s body grew dimmer and dimmer and its body became transparent in a blink of an eye.

Soon, only the phantom of the blooming lotus was left in the place where the Artifact Spirit originally stood. When the lotus fully blossomed, it exploded with a bang, leaving behind a familiar War Hammer in front of Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gasped with his pale face, but before he could move, the War Hammer shook slightly and attempted to escape.

“Still not dead?” Yang Kai exclaimed. This Artifact Spirit had taken his two Soul Secret Techniques without dying on the spot; its tenacity was beyond his expectations.

But it was clearly nearing its end. Seeing the War Hammer trying to escape through the air, Yang Kai quickly took out his Sealed World Bead and performed a hand seal. Space Principles swirled from the Sealed World Bead and a Void Crack soon appeared on its surface.

“Stop it!” Yang Kai shouted.

The giant arm of the Embodiment reached out from the Void Crack with its fingers spread widely as it fell towards the War Hammer like a huge mountain, suppressing it.

Then, it immediately grabbed the War Hammer in its hand and retreated back into the Small Sealed World.

After that, the Void Crack gradually disappeared.

Yang Kai fell to the ground as he felt ill once more. The little power that he had barely managed to recover was depleted again, and he felt like he could see stars circling around his head at this moment. He tried to stand up again but found he was unable to rise to his feet.

A fragrant wind flew over at that moment and held him. Yang Kai turned his head with difficulty and saw the face of Liu Yan.

“Master, are you okay?” Liu Yan asked nervously.

Yang Kai shook his head arduously, then turned to look around, soon finding that Hua Qing Si was also here. He immediately understood that the two of them should have arrived long ago and hidden nearby in preparation to assist him after sensing the situation here. However, they did not expect that the battle would be over so quickly.

In fact, if Yang Kai had not spent too much of his Spiritual Energy in collecting the Source Crystal lode earlier, he would not have been bothered by the Artifact Spirit for so long.

Although the Artifact Spirit was an Emperor Artifact assuming human form, it could be restrained by Soul attacks, and the Soul Secret Techniques mastered by Yang Kai were extremely powerful, so as long as he restored enough Spiritual Energy, it was not difficult for him to deal with the Artifact Spirit.

“I’m fine!” Yang Kai shook his head and asked weakly, “Where is Ruo Xi?”

Liu Yan answered, “It’s too dangerous here, so I had her follow that woman named Ye Jing Han.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Yang Kai nodded, “Good! Let me restore my strength first. Liu Yan, you should try to absorb the black flames of the Luan Feng here. They will be helpful to your growth if you can.”

“I was thinking that as well!” Liu Yan’s eyes flashed with a fiery light, staring at the World Extinguishing Black Flames which were flickering around them, as if she was looking at some Heavenly delicacy, licking her lips with her dainty scarlet tongue.

Yang Kai then looked at Hua Qing Si, “Big Sister Hua, take care of this Sealed World Bead!”

“You actually... called me Big Sister Hua...” It was Hua Qing Si’s first time hearing Yang Kai addressing her this way, and she could not help but be stunned for a moment. When she regained her composure, Yang Kai had already moved into the Small Sealed World and tossed the Sealed World Bead over towards her.

“Smelly brat, pretending to be young!” Hua Qing Si spat disdainfully, very dissatisfied with what Yang Kai called her, but she was soon distracted by the Sealed World Bead, examining it closely in curiosity.

Although she had been staying in the Small Sealed World all this time, it was her first time seeing its true appearance up close. She could not help being curious about it, wondering what mighty expert had such profound ability to refine such a world into a bead.

Soon, she set her dissatisfaction aside and started to study it with enthusiasm.

After all, this was an Emperor Artifact. If she could comprehend anything from it, it would be of great help to her growth.

She secretly guessed that the reason why Yang Kai was so proficient in the Dao of Space was that he had comprehended the mysteries of this Sealed World Bead.

In fact, she was wrong. Yang Kai had actually cultivated the Dao of Space before he obtained the Sealed World Bead, and it was exactly because of this that Yang Yan had passed him the Sealed World Bead. If that wasn’t the case, Yang Kai may not even have had the chance to possess this Sealed World Bead.

However, Yang Kai did comprehend a lot of mysteries about Space Principles inside the Sealed World Bead.

...

Inside the Small Sealed World, Yang Kai appeared leisurely. He was startled for a moment then exclaimed, “Why is the World Energy so rich here!?”

He did not realize until this moment that the World Energy inside the Small Sealed World was five to six times richer than before.

After that, he heard a muffled laugh, “Then, where do you think the World Energy that was previously absorbed in that Spirit Spring go?”

Yang Kai glanced at the Embodiment and responded with a speechless face, “It’s just that... I didn’t expect that so much World Energy had been absorbed. I’m afraid the cultivation environment here is now about the same as those first-class Sect cultivation paradises.”

The Embodiment nodded, “It’s really not bad, but... after all, the World Energy here is a river without a source, a tree without roots. If a way to replenish it is not found, it will be consumed one day.”

Yang Kai sighed, “The World Principles in this Small Sealed World are still imperfect. Even though it is an independent world, it was unable to produce its own World Energy, so I still need to find a way to make its World Principles evolve once more!”

While speaking, Yang Kai lifted his head and glanced at the Embodiment with his eyes squinted, “Why are you leaning on the Source Crystal lode?”

The Embodiment looked solemn, with his one hand performing a hand seal while the other gripped the Demonic War Hammer tightly. Sitting down close to the Source Crystal lode, he replied, “I’m cultivating the Heaven Devouring Battle Law!”

The corner of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched, “This Source Crystal lode produces Mid-Rank and High-Rank Source Crystals, don’t eat them all.”

The Heaven Devouring Battle Law could devour everything beneath the Heavens, including the essence of a cultivator’s physique; therefore, the Source Crystal lode here was no exception.

Under the operation of the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, pure World Energy was streaming steadily from the Source Crystal lode into the body of the Embodiment, like a river returning to the sea.

The Embodiment continued, “Relax, I divided this Source Crystal lode into two and left you the other half.”

Yang Kai nodded, “That is for the best. If you have time, break the other half into pieces, I might need to use those Source Crystals someday... I need to recover first though, I’ll talk to you about the details later.”

After saying so, Yang Kai went to the nearby medicine garden in a flash and sat down cross-legged.

There was the Immortal Tree in the medicine garden, providing unlimited vitality, so although Yang Kai had not suffered too great a physical injury from the battle before, he had still consumed a lot of his strength and he could use the rich vitality here to recover faster.

With a single thought, the World Energy in the Small Sealed World gathered towards the place where Yang Kai was sitting, and in the blink of an eye, it began to liquefy around him.

Yang Kai opened up his mind and body, circulating his Secret Art while absorbing the World Energy as quickly as possible, his dispirited aura rapidly recovering as he did so.
