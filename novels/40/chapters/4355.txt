Everyone had their own sense of greed, especially when it came to their Martial Dao. Once a person had experienced their first breakthrough, they would want to continue. Yang Kai was the same. He was not willing to waste his high starting point with all the rare materials he had condensed. Although he knew that his journey would be full of thorns and tribulations, he still had no intention of backing down.

Fang Yue was no different.

If it wasn’t for the rise of Void Land, if it wasn’t for Yang Kai using the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills to increase the Star City’s popularity and make the fame of the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills spread throughout the 3,000 Worlds, Fang Yue would probably have been resigned to his fate. He would settle for the Third-Order Open Heaven Realm; otherwise, he would lose everything and disappear due to the backlash of trying to break through to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

However, when he heard that there were Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills in Void Land, it was like a ray of light had pierced through the fog of darkness. Fang Yue felt a glimmer of hope.

That was why he had taken the liberty to visit Yang Kai.

However, Yang Kai’s Void Land already had a mighty army with the finest arms. What advantages could he, a trivial Half-Step Open Heaven Realm Master, offer Yang Kai in return for such a precious treasure? The only thing he could rely on was the small friendship all of them had in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary.

Now, it seemed as if this trip had not been in vain. Thinking about it, Yang Kai was not a narrow-minded person. He brought out all the Bearers from the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, disregarding their former status as enemies. Instead, it was Fang Yue who had been overly skeptical and pessimistic.

Reflecting on this, Fang Yue couldn’t help but feel a little ashamed.

“I naturally welcome Brother Fang if you want to join my Void Land, but does Brother Fang know the current situation of my Void Land?”

Fang Yue replied, “I’ve heard a little bit about Senior Brother’s intention to reach the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm directly, which seemed to have touched the nerves of certain powerful figures, leading to targeted discrimination and suppression.”

Yang Kai looked at him with a smile, “That’s right, the Hundred Sects Alliance was formed to attack us because of this. When the time comes, my Void Land might face trouble. Does Brother Fang still want to join knowing this?”

Fang Yue said, “If I enter Void Land, this Fang will live and die together with Void Land. It’s better to die a glorious death than live a life filled with regrets!”

“Good!” Yang Kai laughed loudly, “If after Brother Fang has expressed such an intention, how can this Yang refuse? From now on, you will be a member of my Void Land.”

Feeling overjoyed, Fang Yue got up and saluted, “Disciple Fang Yue, greets Sect Master!”

Yang Kai came forward to help him up, “No need to be polite, you and I will call each other Fellow Brothers in the future!” Fang Yue had condensed Sixth-Order Powers, and would sooner or later advance to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. At that time, he would become a powerhouse of Void Land, so Yang Kai did not want their relationship to stiffen due to their different positions.

Fang Yue said gratefully, “Many thanks, Senior Brother!”

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Since you have joined my Void Land, you should practice well and tell me when you are about to break through to the Open Heaven Realm, I will help you then.”

Fang Yue said in reply, “I am not going to lie to Senior Brother. Right now, I am only one step away from advancing to the Open Heaven Realm. I only need to condense my last Element to break through, but I want to cultivate in retreat for some time to solidify my foundation first, so that I can have a better chance of success.”

“That is for the best.” Yang Kai nodded his head.

When he was in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, Fang Yue had already reached the Half-Step Open Heaven Realm with the help of the Solid Earth Black Tortoise. It had been a few years since he had left the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, so it was not surprising that he was only one step away from breaking through.

“I’ll have someone arrange a place for you to live, so you can cultivate inside the Sect without worry.”

Fang Yue thanked him and hesitated for a moment before saying, “Senior Brother, do you remember Xiang Ying and the others?”

Yang Kai turned his head to look at him and asked curiously, “Junior Brother what do you…”

Fang Yue answered, “There were many Bearers in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. I believe that there are quite a few people who are facing the same predicament as me, such as Xiang Ying and Ding Yi. If Senior Brother offers them the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills, I think they would not refuse joining you. Since they were chosen by the Divine Spirits as Bearers in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, they should have condensed at least Fifth-Order Elements. If they can successfully break through to the Open Heaven realm in the future, they will definitely become a great help to Senior Brother!

Yang Kai nodded and said, “While that is true, the 3,000 Worlds is vast. No one knows where they could have gone after leaving the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary.”

Fang Yue said with a smile, “I too have no way to contact them, but Senior Brother does not need to worry about that. Even if Senior Brother may not know where they are right now, they certainly know where Senior Brother is. I believe that sooner or later, they will come to you on their own initiative, just like me. All Senior Brother needs to do is to sit back and wait.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly, “That’s true!”

In the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, the number of people chosen by the Divine Spirits to be Bearers was quite large, 50 at least. While the number of people that did not belong to any sect may not be that great, as long as that number reached thirty percent, that would translate to 15 to 20 people. These people had at least condensed Fifth-Order Elements. Furthermore, people such as Fang Yue and Ding Yi had condensed Sixth-Order Elements. As long as they had a Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills as an auxiliary, there was a great chance that all of them could break through to the Fifth or Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

These Bearers already owned Yang Kai a life saving grace, so if he offered them a Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill now, delivering charcoal to them in the frigid winter, then Void Land should have no problem recruiting them.

That would mean, in a relatively short span of time, Void Land could have 15 to 20 more Masters in the Fifth and Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm! That was a terrifying force!

From the situation Fang Yue pitched, it could be seen that the Bearers from the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary needed Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills much more than others. The closer they were to breaking through, the more urgent their need would be.

Thus, what Fang Yue was saying had promise indeed.

“If what this Fang said assured Senior Brother, please let me handle this matter. If I act as an example, I believe they will be more assured.” Fang Yue volunteered. Since he had just joined Void Land, he needed to do something to prove his worth, not just silently cultivate.

“What does Junior Brother plan to do?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

Fang Yue smiled and said, “I would like to ask Senior Brother to allocate a store to me. This Junior Brother can open a ‘Grand Ancient Ruins Shop’ in the Star City, not to sell anything, just to allow people to be able to find and come to this Junior Brother.”

Yang Kai laughed, “Is Junior brother trying to ‘fish’?”

Fang Yue winked at him and said, “The ones who need it will take the bait.”

If Fang Yue personally ran the Grand Ancient Ruins Shop, Yang Kai believed that those who came out of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary would be much less wary, and it would be much easier to recruit them.

Yang Kai had no reason to refuse, anyway. It was only a single store, and it didn’t matter even if he could not recruit people. He immediately called Bian Yu Qing in, and asked her to cooperate with Fang Yue.

Soon, a store called ‘Grand Ancient Ruins Shop’ opened in the center of the Star City, near Void Auction House.

Grand Ancient Ruins Shop sold numerous goods, but none of the items were particularly valuable. In other words, it was a general store. There were also only a few shop-hands in the Grand Ancient Ruins Shop.

The sudden appearance of such a shop in such a prime location naturally aroused the interest of many, who came to investigate, but after ascertaining the circumstances of Grand Ancient Ruins Shop, many people sighed, thinking that the Shopkeeper was simply stupid. It was an unwise decision to open the Grand Ancient Ruins Shop in such an area, which was a waste of money.

Therefore, the popularity of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary quickly died out a few days after it opened. The few shop-hands had nothing to do all day long, and Fang Yue just sat behind the counter and cultivated in silence.

However, the Grand Ancient Ruins Shop had its first harvest after just ten days.

A young man called Li Ye approached Fang Yue, talked with him in a secret room, and was quickly introduced to Void Land! Li Ye was also one of the Bearers from the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. Just like Fang Yue, he was a rogue cultivator; however, he was a little bit inferior when compared to Fang Yue as he had only condensed Fifth-Order Elements.

Still, even Fifth-Order Elements was beyond his limit.

When Fang Yue heard about the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill, he took the initiative to come to the Star City, which Li Ye had also done. However, Li Ye had no relationship with Yang Kai whatsoever, except for the fact that he was brought out of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary by him. Thus, he did not take the liberty of visiting Yang Kai due to the fear that he would be ignored.

Moreover, he could not be sure that Void Land’s Lord was the Yang Kai he met in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. If this Yang Kai was not the one that he knew, and they just had similar names, then he would be put in an awkward spot.

When Li Ye was at a loss for what to do, he passed by the Grand Ancient Ruins Shop and saw Fang Yue. He was not familiar with Fang Yue, but he had met face to face with him before, so he naturally remembered him. Li Ye felt surprised and delighted and decided to talk to him.

Fang Yue was waiting for this moment, so he didn’t hesitate, and immediately led Li Ye into the secret room.

Getting to know that he could obtain a Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill when he was about to break through to the Open Heaven Realm as long as he joined Void Land made Li Ye feel overjoyed. He nodded in agreement without any hesitation.

To him, this was a life-saving straw he found when drowning, so why would he not grasp onto it firmly?

With his successful recruitment of Li Ye, Fang Yue became even more confident. He believed that as long as those Bearers from the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary heard news of the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills, they would look for Void Star City sooner or later. All he needed to do now was wait patiently.

While Fang Yue was staying in the Grand Ancient Ruins Shop, Manager Zhou from Asura Heaven visited Void Land again.

He and Yang Kai had bargained before, each putting forward their own conditions, but Manager Zhou was unable to make a decision and had sent a message to his superiors. This time, he had come to deliver Asura Heaven’s answer.

Yang Kai needed a High-Rank Yin Element treasure, which Asura Heaven insisted was not possible. This was their respective bottom lines, and there would be no negotiations.

Even though Yang Kai had expected it, he was still slightly disappointed.

Asura Heaven also failed to buy any Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills from Yang Kai. Yang Kai’s attitude towards this matter was quite simple. They did not sell something he wanted, so naturally, he would not sell them what they wanted. If they wanted Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills, they could go to the auction that happened once every three months and bid for it themselves.

The final results of the negotiations were that Void Star City would set aside a large plot for a new Asura Arena to be built. Void Land would take a 30% share of the profits, but the rent and taxes would all be free.

Void Auction House was already established now, so with the 30% stake in the Asura Arena, two giant money trees had been planted.
