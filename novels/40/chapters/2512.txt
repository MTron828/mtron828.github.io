While Yang Kai was communicating with Li Wu Yi and Jiu Feng via Divine Sense transmission, Mo Xiao Qi and Zhang Ruo Xi could only see Yang Kai’s lips moving. The two top Emperor Realm Masters reacted to Yang Kai’s messages with a broad mixture of different expressions flipping across their faces; shock, surprise, curiosity, horror, solemnity, respect and pity…

From time to time, Li Wu Yi and Jiu Feng would interject with a question, to which Yang Kai answered patiently.

“What are they talking about?” Mo Xiao Qi asked Zhang Ruo Xi secretly.

Zhang Ruo Xi shook her head, indicating that she had no clue either.

Mo Xiao Qi continued, “I’m actually very curious about what happened in the Shattered Star Sea after I fainted. Do you know anything?”

Zhang Ruo Xi still shook her head, whispering, “I also fainted at almost the same time as you. When I woke up, I was already here.”

The two little girls looked at each other as a subtle feeling of sympathy for each other grew inside them.

“How could there be such a thing?” After a long while, Li Wu Yi finally voiced out with a solemn face.

Jiu Feng looked awe-inspired too, “We really have to tell our Sir about this matter because that Sir’s condition doesn’t look optimistic. His life will be difficult in the future, having to share his body with the Soul of that devil.”

Yang Kai sighed, “Senior Duan has just left, but he didn’t say where he was going. It would be good if Sir Martial Beast could find him. This Junior really respects Senior Duan for his willingness to sacrifice his life for the common people of the world and cannot bear to watch him be tortured for the rest of his life.”

Jiu Feng replied solemnly, “Don’t worry. Our Sir won’t sit back and do nothing. When we return to Spirit Beast Island, I will report this matter to him in detail.”

Yang Kai was overjoyed, “Many thanks, Senior.”

They should be able to find Duan Hong Chen with the help of Martial Beast Great Emperor, and perhaps, the latter could find a solution for Duan Hong Chen’s current awkward condition.

“I didn’t expect that such a bizarre thing could have happened in the Shattered Star Sea. No wonder the elite disciples of the four territories were all suddenly ejected out of the Shattered Star Sea. Our Sir had already said that there must have been some unforeseen incident in the Shattered Star Sea before we left, but I didn’t expect that it would be this serious,” Li Wu Yi sighed.

“It is fortunate that they are all safe. If all of them died because of this…” Goosebumps filled Jiu Feng’s skin as she was unable to finish her sentence.

In the next moment though, her scorching eyes fixed on Yang Kai as she abruptly changed the topic, “Boy, just now, when we arrived here, there was one thing that made this Queen very concerned…” She pointed her finger in the direction of the Phoenix egg, and continued with a deep voice, “Why does this Queen sense the aura of the Phoenix True Fire from there!?”

Li Wu Yi was taken aback, in amazement, “Phoenix True Fire?”

After speaking, he instantly turned to the Phoenix egg and failed to suppress a gasp when he saw the mysterious patterns on the Phoenix egg, exclaiming, “The Phoenix Clan Inheritance!”

“Senior knows of it?” Yang Kai looked at Li Wu Yi in surprise.

He was only able to confirm this was the Phoenix Clan Inheritance when he tried to spy on the patterns on the egg and suffered an attack by a Soul Technique on his Knowledge Sea. He could not believe that Li Wu Yi could recognize it with just a glance.

Li Wu Yi stared at the Phoenix egg dumbfounded for a while, but when he regained his senses, he explained, “Spirit Beast Island has records about the Phoenix Clan, and…” Having said that, he stole a glance at Jiu Feng and stopped talking.

Jiu Feng questioned, “Is it really the Phoenix True Fire?”

Yang Kai nodded, “It is.”

“I heard that there was a remnant of Phoenix True Fire in the Shattered Star Sea, which was possessed by the Martial Flame Great Emperor back then… and you just happened to come out of the Shattered Star Sea. Could it be…” Jiu Feng thought carefully and quickly came up with a conclusion.

“Senior is correct. The Phoenix True Fire is indeed from the Shattered Star Sea, a relic left behind by the Martial Flame Great Emperor,” Yang Kai did not try to conceal it.

Although it was as expected, Jiu Feng still could not help gasping at Yang Kai’s confirmation. She looked at the Phoenix egg in admiration and envy as she remarked, “This Queen has also visited the Shattered Star Sea to search for the Phoenix True Fire, but it was all in vain. I can’t believe that I would have a chance to see it now.”

After a pause, she frowned, “Since it has become a Phoenix egg, it means that someone refined the Phoenix True Fire. Who is this person that could convince the Phoenix True Fire to acknowledge his existence?”

Before Yang Kai could speak, Mo Xiao Qi interjected, “It’s Big Sister Liu Yan.”

“Oh?” Jiu Feng’s beautiful eyes lit up, murmuring, “That Artifact Spirit?”

Judging from her expression and tone, it seemed that Mo Xiao Qi had told her about Liu Yan, and she also knew that Liu Yan was an Artifact Spirit.

She could not help praising, “It must be fate for a trivial Artifact Spirit to actually be acknowledged by the Phoenix True Fire. Once she is reborn in nirvana, she will inherit the Phoenix Clan Inheritance in its totality and have the opportunity to become a member of the Phoenix Clan.”

“Senior Jiu Feng seems to be very knowledgeable about the Phoenix Clan,” Yang Kai was enlightened.

“Very knowledgeable?” Jiu Feng glanced at Yang Kai with a contemptuous look.

Flustered by her reaction, he asked “Did I say something wrong?”

Mo Xiao Qi smiled faintly, “Big Brother Yang, Aunty Feng possesses an extremely pure Phoenix Clan Bloodline. Other than those from the original Phoenix Clan, no one else would know the Phoenix Clan better than her.”

“What?” Yang Kai was appalled, “Senior Jiu Feng has the Phoenix Clan’s bloodline!?”

This was the first time he learnt about this, but when he thought about it carefully, the ‘Feng’ in Jiu Feng’s name actually meant ‘Phoenix’, and her scorching power was notably compatible with the Fire Phoenix’s, moreover, she came from a place like Spirit Beast Island…

Yang Kai was ecstatic and he hurriedly queried, “Senior, since you have the bloodline of the Phoenix Clan, may I know when my friend will be hatched from her egg and reborn again?

Jiu Feng frowned, “This is hard to say, but may I ask… If this Queen didn’t come here, what did you plan to do?”

“What did I plan to do?” Yang Kai was stunned for a moment before answering frankly, “I was just going to wait.”

“Wait?” Jiu Feng looked at Yang Kai with a weird face, “Wait for one or two years here?”

“One or two years? That long?” Yang Kai nearly jumped.

“Whether it is long or not, the whole process may take just a year, or even up to eight to ten years,” Jiu Feng sneered, “Do you think it is that easy to refine the Phoenix True Fire? Your friend’s success in being acknowledged by the Phoenix True Fire and turning into a Phoenix egg is just the beginning of her journey. To truly refine and master the Phoenix True Fire, one would need to pass through some dire challenges. If your friend can’t endure them, she will be burned to death; even if she perseveres, she will not succeed in a short time.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Even if she succeeds, it is still questionable if she will comprehend how to control the Phoenix True Fire. At the same time, would she know of the Phoenix Clan’s Secret Techniques from just the inheritance alone?”

Yang Kai listened with a heavy face.

He realized that he was too na?ve. He was hoping that it would not take long for Liu Yan to reappear in front of him, but after listening to Jiu Feng, only then did he realize how much he had underestimated the risks.

Since Jiu Feng had the bloodline of the Phoenix Clan, she was certainly extremely knowledgeable of the Phoenix Clan, and what she said could not be wrong.

“Senior, this Junior asks for your advice,” Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat.

Jiu Feng answered, “Even if you have my advice, you still can’t help her. You know nothing about the Phoenix Clan, or about the mysteries of the Phoenix True Fire. You can’t help her.”

Yang Kai pressed on, “Senior, please explain it clearly. This Junior should be able to understand.”

Jiu Feng rolled her eyes at him, and snorted coldly, “Can you cook a table of delicious food even if I give you the ingredients?”

Yang Kai wiped the cold sweats on his head, and replied unconfidently, “I think I still can make sure that they are cooked.”

Mo Xiao Qi approached Jiu Feng and shook her arm, “Aunty Feng, Big Sister Liu Yan is a very good person. If you can help, please help.”

Jiu Feng glared at her fiercely and smouldered, “Quiet, I’m still not done with you. All you want to do is run around and play and have fun, never paying attention to your cultivation at all. If it weren’t for me and your Uncle Li who came to look for you this time, weren’t you planning to run away again?”

Mo Xiao Qi pursed her lips, “How about this… If you help Big Sister Liu Yan this time, I will follow you back to the island to cultivate and will not leave until I break through to the Emperor Realm.”

“Oh?” Jiu Feng’s beautiful eyes brightened, checking Mo Xiao Qi with her scorching eyes, “You said it yourself.”

Mo Xiao Qi revealed a look of frustration, but she closed her eyes and declared, “Yes, I said it.”

“Deal!” Li Wu Yi chuckled slightly.

Jiu Feng chortled as well, and shared, “Since you’ve said so much, Aunty Feng would definitely not sit back and watch.”

Mo Xiao Qi growled, “Aunty Feng, you are so mean! You won’t do anything without benefits!”

Jiu Feng chuckled and looked at her with a cheerful face, “It’s okay even if you regret it now. Your Uncle Li and I can still take you back by force. The end result would be the same.”

Mo Xiao Qi stomped in fury, “I hate the both of you!”

Jiu Feng put her smile away and turned to Yang Kai, “If you are alright with it, I will take the Phoenix egg back to Spirit Beast Island and cast a Secret Technique from the Phoenix Clan to protect her.”

“Take her back to Spirit Beast Island?” Yang Kai felt slightly lost, and could not help glancing at the place where the Phoenix egg was.

Jiu Feng continued, “You can also follow us to Spirit Beast Island. Although Spirit Beast Island does not have many visitors, since you are Xiao Qi’s friend, it should be fine for you to live on the island for a while and I believe Sir will not refuse you.”

Mo Xiao Qi’s eyes instantly lit up and she squealed, “That’s right, Big Brother Yang! Come with me to Spirit Beast Island. Our Spirit Beast Island is really beautiful.”

Her face overflowed with expectation and her beautiful eyes glowed with hope.

Yang Kai did not look at her though as he could not bear to let her down. He instead turned to Jiu Feng and asked, “Based on Senior’s estimation, how long will it take for Liu Yan to refine the Phoenix True Fire?”

Jiu Feng disclosed, “At least a year. According to the legend, the Martial Flame Great Emperor spent five months refining the Phoenix True Fire, so one year is just the most conservative estimate, and this is still on the premise that everything goes well.”

“One year…” Yang Kai sighed, “Then Senior, please take her with you. About Spirit Beast Island… This Junior will visit another time because I still have something to deal with right now.”

After hearing this, disappointment was written on Mo Xiao Qi’s face.

Jiu Feng nodded in agreement, “You can rest assured that since this Queen has promised you to protect her, I will not snatch her away from you. This Queen just wishes to witness if the refining of the Phoenix True Fire by an Artifact Spirit would have any strange transformations!”

When she finished her sentence, she revealed an expectant and exhilarated face, together with an extremely dangerous brilliance in her beautiful eyes.

She performed a skill with her arm stretched and drew the Phoenix egg that was far away directly to her, wrapping it with her Emperor Qi. The Phoenix egg seemed to sense something, as the runic patterns on its surface started to move vividly, and a vague cry came out from it.
