Certainly, if a Star Field Guardian didn’t want the Star Field to be damaged, he shouldn’t showcase a power that was too strong. Only someone like Wu Kuang whose intention was to swallow everything would be so reckless.

Outside the bamboo hut, Liu Yan was sitting on the Star Shuttle as she rested her delicate face on her palms. Every detail of the solitary mountain was reflected in her clear gaze.

“Were you really picked up by Sir?” He Yun Xiang stroked the little girl’s head. It was hard not to take a liking to such an adorable young girl. She especially liked to run her fingers through the young girl’s long and silky hair. She probably wouldn’t get bored even if she had to do it all day.

“Yes,” In a way, Liu Yan was picked up by Yang Kai. If she hadn’t come across Yang Kai, she would still be an Artifact Spirit that was trapped in an Artifact Refining Furnace. She considered herself extremely lucky that she had gotten her own body and the inheritance of the Phoenix True Fire.

“Who is the person inside that Sir is meeting?”

Liu Yan shook her head, for she also didn’t know who the person inside was. However, she could feel that the person was so powerful that even if she and Yang Kai joined forces, they might not be able to defeat him. Suddenly, she looked up at He Yun Xiang and asked, “Do you want to be my Master’s woman?”

“What?” He Yun Xiang started blushing. [This is not something a kid should ask about!]

Then, she crouched down and uttered solemnly, “Who taught you this?”

Liu Yan replied, “I don’t think you’ll stand a chance, because my Master already has several women.” Then, she turned her head and looked at the front.

Yang Kai pushed the door open and stepped out of the house. Rubbing his own chin, he fell into his thoughts on the same spot for a long time before he leapt into the air and landed on the Star Shuttle.

“Sir, shall we continue?” He Yun Xiang asked.

“En, let’s go.” Yang Kai waved his hand and sat down on the Star Shuttle with his legs crossed. Seeing that Liu Yan was staring longingly at him, he felt helpless and pulled her into his embrace.

It was then that Liu Yan beamed at him and sat properly. After that, the Star Shuttle turned into a beam of light and disappeared from the place.

Then, voices could be heard from inside the bamboo hut.

“My reputation has always been excellent, but I’ve never expected that I’d partner up with someone like you to do such a thing in the end.”

“Hmph. You shouldn’t bother about trifles if you want to achieve success. When that day comes, you’ll understand that you’ve made the right decision.”

“I hope so…”

The bamboo hut fell into silence again, as the person inside it had disappeared.

…

“This way!” One day later, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes and pointed in a particular direction. His gaze appeared excited.

All of a sudden, he caught a faintly discernible trace. It was like a thread that would break apart at any moment, or a flickering fire amidst the rain that was shining faintly. It was this faint and almost imperceptible connection that pointed in the right direction for him. The direction that led to the Heng Luo Star Field!

There was no doubt that the Star Chart in his Knowledge Sea was its Source. However, it was impossible to refine it in one day. Despite that, Yang Kai had attempted to communicate with it multiple times, and now he had gotten something in return.

By just following this faint induction, he would surely find his way back home. It was like a kite that was high above the sky, but the thread was still firmly held by the kite runner.

Just then, different faces flashed across his mind. Su Yan, Xia Ning Chang, Shan Qing Luo, Xue Yue, his other friends and family… and even those whose names he had forgotten. However, at this moment, all of them sprang into his mind as though they were trying to tell him something.

All of a sudden, a subtle but intoxicating feeling rose within him. It was as though a warm stream was filling his chest and penetrating his heart. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Liu Yan seemed to have noticed the change in him, so she lay in his embrace and touched his chest to feel the vigorous heartbeat.

The induction coming from the Star Chart was faint and intermittent. While Yang Kai kept giving directions, He Yun Xiang drove the Star Shuttle and executed his orders.

One month later, they arrived at a deserted stretch of land. There was a vividly colourful Star Road Portal that was tens of metres above in the sky. Some cottages were scattered around the place, and there were some cultivators who were meditating in those houses. Apparently, they were the cultivators from different Sects that had been stationed here to attract newcomers if anyone emerged from the portal.

Almost every Star Road Portal in Ancestral Domain looked like this. These Sects seemed to be in favour of the cultivators that came from Lower Star Fields. Those cultivators who came from Lower Star Fields themselves would even proactively take up this task. This way, they would be in an advantageous position to attract newcomers if they came across those from the same Star Field.

With that said, while some Star Road Portals were bustling, some were quiet. The reason for that was that the number of Star Fields these Star Road Portals were connected to varied. Some portals were connected to a dozen and even more Star Fields, while some portals were connected to only one or two Star Fields, so the number of cultivators that would walk out of these portals would be different too. That was why some portals were viewed as more important than others.

The portal before their eyes was obviously the latter, so Yang Kai reckoned that it was probably only connected to a few Star Fields. Moreover, the cultivators that had been stationed here were all Origin Kings, none of them being in the Dao Source Realm, which went to show that this place wasn’t regarded as important.

However, in Yang Kai’s eyes, this portal was the most beautiful thing in this world. He pulled himself together and communicated with the Star Chart again, upon which he realised that the induction really pointed to the deepest part of the entrance.

[This is it!]

He was truly surprised that there was a portal that was connected to Heng Luo Star Field in the Ancestral Domain. In the past, before he left the Star Field, he had never heard of the Ancestral Domain, not even a rumour.

Just then, the doors of the cottages opened, upon which some cultivators walked out and looked up at Yang Kai and the others. One of them cupped his fists and asked, “Friend, where are you from? And where are you going?”

Yang Kai was in a good mood, so he waved his hand and uttered, “I’m just passing by, no need to concern yourself with me.”

The person frowned as he was disgruntled with Yang Kai’s attitude, but he didn’t utter another word.

The next moment, Yang Kai activated his Divine Sense and probed the Star Road Portal. Although the portal must be connected to Heng Luo Star Field, it would still take him some effort if he wanted to return to his Star Field through this portal.

Others might need immense power to break through the Void, but Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space, so he would just have to grasp the proper path to take and he’d be able to go home with ease. He was already used to passing through the Void anyway.

A moment later, he made up his mind and clapped He Yun Xiang’s shoulder, “You have two options now. First, you could stay here in the Ancestral Domain. This is a good place. If you stay here, you’ll also have a bright future. I’ll give you some pills and supplies for your cultivation.”

“I’ll choose the second option,” He Yun Xiang declared without hesitation. If the recent incidents hadn’t happened, she would have chosen to stay in the Ancestral Domain; however, she had experienced many eye-opening events with Yang Kai, so she knew that the Ancestral Domain wasn’t the greatest world out there, and Third-Order Dao Source Realm wasn’t the peak of the Martial Dao.

She had followed Yang Kai all the way from Unending Star Field to this place, so she wouldn’t want to stop here. Before Yang Kai even told her the second option, she had already made a decision.

“Good.” Yang Kai nodded. It wouldn’t be a burden for him to bring along one more person.

Just when he was about to step forward, he suddenly stopped and looked down at the people below him, “Friends, have you ever met someone from Heng Luo Star Field?”

During this period of time, he would ask this kind of question every time he reached a new portal. Now, he was just habitually asking this question, so he didn’t expect any positive reply. Since he was going back to his Star Field, he would be able to meet his loved ones soon anyway.

“Why are you asking this question?” One person suddenly appeared vigilant as he stared at Yang Kai with a frown. It was the person who talked to Yang Kai earlier.

Shocked, Yang Kai blinked and asked, “You’ve really met someone from that Star Field?”

“No,” The person shook his head.

Naturally, Yang Kai wouldn’t believe him, so he extended his hand, upon which the person felt an immense power of attraction as his body flew uncontrollably forward. After his neck was clenched, his face reddened in an instant, and he realised that he couldn’t use his Saint Qi at all, so he couldn’t help but be horrified.

Appearing ferocious, Yang Kai demanded, “What I hate most is when others lie to me. You either have or have not seen anyone from Heng Luo Star Field. I’ll give you one last chance. Think it through before replying to me.”

Sometimes, being overbearing was more effective than appearing kind.

The other cultivators turned pale upon seeing how powerful Yang Kai was. It was then they realised that the young man was able to kill them with a wave of his hand.

“Y-Yes!” The person tried his hardest to squeeze out one word.

[Really?] Yang Kai couldn’t believe his ears as he slightly relaxed his grip and questioned, “When did you see that person? What did that person look like? Where did they go? Tell me everything in detail. If you dare hide anything from me, today next year will be the anniversary of your death!”

“I couldn’t remember exactly when it was, but it was about 20 years ago. At that time, I wasn’t the one who was responsible for welcoming her, but I heard that Senior Sister came from Heng Luo Star Field.”

“Senior Sister?” Yang Kai turned solemn, “What’s her name?”

“Su Yan!”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai was shaken to the core. The name of the woman he had been longing for was uttered by a stranger all of a sudden, and it was revealed that she was in the Ancestral Domain! The revelation had an unimaginable impact on him, which caused his mind to turn blank and all his thoughts to stop.

If any Master were to attack him now, they would certainly be successful.

Then, Liu Yan asked, “Are you sure she’s from Heng Luo Star Field?”

“Yes. Because Senior Sister Su has never tried to hide her background. Instead, she intentionally made it known to everyone. My fellow Brothers paid attention to her at that time.” They didn’t just pay attention to her background but also to her stunning, world-shaking beauty.

Yang Kai was dumbfounded. He was still doubtful earlier, but now, there was basically no doubt that Su Yan was here in the Ancestral Domain.

Her name wasn’t that special. In fact, it could even be said to be ordinary, so there must be many people with the same name; however, there was only one Su Yan in this world who was from Heng Luo Star Field and would be able to pass through that portal.

[Twenty years… It means that a few years after I left the Star Field, Su Yan arrived in the Ancestral Domain. How did she find the entrance to this place? She has never been one to speak carelessly though, so the reason she told everyone her background must be because she wanted me to hear about her! She didn’t know where she was or what place the Ancestral Domain was, which was why she did that to increase the chances of meeting me. If I were in the Ancestral Domain, I would’ve looked for her upon learning about her. She was venturing into this totally unfamiliar world on her own…]

At that instant, Yang Kai felt sorry for her, and at the same time, he felt extremely guilty.
