Seeing that Bing Yun and the others were about to leave, Valley Master Chen of Green Wind Valley opened his mouth, attempting to say something but stopped. He seemingly wanted to admit his mistakes and beg for forgiveness, but, from the look on his miserable face, when he thought of his actions in helping a tyrant abuse the innocent, he swallowed his words.

He knew that at this point, it was useless for him to say anything.

He regretted it. If he had known that Ice Heart Valley could bring in such strong allies, he would not have gotten involved with the Seeking Passion Sect from the beginning. Now, not only was Seeking Passion Sect the one who was worried about being exterminated, he was worried for his Green Wind Valley too.

He could not open his mouth because he felt ashamed, but someone else did.

“Junior Sister An, please wait! For the sake of our relationship in the past, please forgive this Elder Sister! This Elder Sister is truly sorry, I beg Junior Sister to let me live.”

Elder Yu cried out in panic.

Previously, during the mighty arrival of all the Masters from the Seeking Passion Sect, she quarrelled against An Ruo Yun to bootlick the Seeking Passion Sect by reprimanding the latter for not appreciating her kindness and stating that she was destined to end miserably today if she refused to realize her mistakes.

But Elder Yu did not expect that the tide would turn in less than a stick’s worth of incense.

Everyone looked at the thick-faced Elder Yu in disdain.

However, it was better to lose face than to lose her life. She would not mind peeling off the skin of her face for it if it could save her life.

Nevertheless, An Ruo Yun definitely did not care about a turncoat like her. Although Elder Yu often came to Ice Heart Valley as a guest and she had a considerably close friendship with An Ruo Yun in the past, she had become her eternal enemy the moment she chose to fight for the Seeking Passion Sect.

Despite hearing her pleas, An Ruo Yun ignored her. She did not even bother to reply a single word and instead rushed towards the valley under Bing Yun’s orders.

“Junior Sister An…” Elder Yu’s face was ashen, calling out even harder, but to no avail.

Knowing that it was useless to plead to An Ruo Yun, Elder Yu immediately moved her gaze to Yang Kai, begging with a forced smile, “Little Brother, this Mistress is not part of the Seeking Passion Sect, and this Mistress really knows her fault now. This Mistress shouldn’t have gone against Ice Heart Valley. This Mistress understands now and feels deeply regretful about it. Little Brother, please be kind-hearted and forgive this Mistress. This Mistress is willing to pay any price.”

While speaking, her tear-glistened eyes fluttered as she pressed her red lips lightly, putting on a pitiful look.

She noticed that the three Monster Kings who arrived seemed to obey Yang Kai’s instructions; therefore, as long as she could persuade Yang Kai, she would surely be able to save herself.

She was certainly not young, but she was good at maintaining her beauty and looks, making her appear no older than thirty while possessing a mature and graceful bearing. With the soft and gentle demeanour she presented, her charm would still be able to capture the hearts of many men.

But Yang Kai simply spat disgustingly, “An old cow still wants to chew young grass? Disgusting! Kill her so she does not defile this Young Master’s eyes further!”

Elder Yu’s pretty face changed drastically at his words. She did not expect that Yang Kai would be so hard-hearted and cruel. With a scream, she used all her strength to retreat, attempting to escape from this place.

Although she was fast, Ying Fei was faster. A beam of navy blue light flashed and Ying Fei already appeared in front of her, his fingers turning into blades that fiercely stabbed into her chest.

The protective Emperor Qi of a First-Order Emperor Realm was like paper to Ying Fei as his swordlike fingers pierced into Elder Yu’s chest. A moment later, a fresh heart was resting in his palm..

Following up, Ying Fei knocked Elder Yu to the ground, which led her to fall to her death on the spot.

“Kill!” At this time, there was no need for Yang Kai to give any more instructions. After a roar, the two Monster Kings, Xi Lei and Xie Wu Wei charged towards the formation of the Seeking Passion Sect while Ying Fei turned back and attacked from the rear.

The three Monster Kings were like tigers pouncing into a flock of sheep, instantly slaughtering the people of Seeking Passion Sect and sending the latter into a total rout. Everywhere the Monster Kings passed, no one could resist them, and no one could escape. It would be a dream for these people to escape before Ying Fei’s exceptional speed.

Mutilated corpses fell from the sky one after another, blood splashing everywhere like blooming scarlet flowers. The gruesome scene was mixed with terrifying murderous intent.

After only ten breaths of time, the fourteen Emperor Realm Masters had fallen.

It was unknown if it was intentional, but the three Monster Kings did not attack Feng Xuan at all, and he was still unscathed while everyone else around him was already dead. On the other hand, Feng Xuan did not interfere when the three Monster Kings were slaughtering his people, instead just watching the tragedy coldly, hovering in mid-air.

Feng Xuan sighed after everyone’s death, his face seemingly growing much older in the blink of an eye.

The Seeking Passion Sect had fallen!

The Seeking Passion Sect, which was inherited from the hands of the Seeking Passion Great Emperor and had deep roots in the Northern Territory for tens of thousands of years, did not fall at the hands of Ice Heart Valley, but rather a young man in the First-Order Emperor Realm.

No matter how hard Feng Xuan thought about it, he still could not figure out who this young man really was, and why he was like a nemesis to his Seeking Passion Sect!

Back then, Yang Kai’s emergence sabotaged the marriage between the Seeking Passion Sect and Ice Heart Valley. Afterwards, Yang Kai had killed his son, and now, the Seeking Passion Sect was about to be destroyed at his hands.

“Who wants the last one?” Xi Lei asked faintly while staring at Feng Xuan.

As Monster Kings of the Ancient Wild Lands, Xi Lei and the others had their own pride too. Previously, they joined hands to kill the enemies because they were outnumbered, but now that there was only one enemy left, they no longer needed to fight together.

Choosing who to finish off this man was a tough decision.

These three Monster Kings knew that this was a chance for them to prove themselves in front of Yang Kai, so they naturally were unwilling to let go of this golden opportunity.

“Me!” Xie Wu Wei immediately replied. With a surge of his Monster Qi, a giant scorpion phantom appeared behind him. The scorpion was gleaming with shiny green brilliance and flailed its obviously venomous tail about.

“Why you?” Ying Fei looked at him reluctantly.

“Then do you want to go?” Xie Wu Wei snorted coldly with his lip curled.

“Why not?” Ying Fei raised his brow, taking a step forward and preparing to take action.

“How about letting this King do it?” Xi Lei grinned, joining in the fun.

“What nonsense are you spouting!?” Ying Fei and Xie Wu Wei stared at him simultaneously.

At this moment, followed by a glare, Feng Xuan, who had been silent the whole time, suddenly emitted an astonishing radiance. His powerful Third-Order Emperor Realm cultivation burst out at once, infusing into the Wind and Thunder Divine Spear in his hand, causing the relic of the Seeking Passion Great Emperor to tremble violently and turn into a purple thunderbolt.

“Die!” Feng Xuan roared. With a flicker, he leapt towards Yang Kai and thrust out his spear.

Xi Lei and the others did not have the time to argue anymore. The moment Feng Xuan carried out the sudden attack, the three of them immediately reacted. Ying Fei was the fastest and pounced directly towards Feng Xuan. With a screech, his hands turned into eagle’s claws and left a trail of numerous afterimages in the sky, trying to seal off Feng Xuan’s movements.

At the same time, Xie Wu Wei and Xi Lei condensed their terrifying Monster Qi and struck towards Feng Xuan from the left and right respectively, unleashing their strength without any reservations.

*Hong Hong Hong… *

A loud explosion sounded as Emperor Qi and Monster Qi collided. The purple thunderbolt permeated a will that could destroy everything, tearing space itself as it collided with the three Monster Kings.

Ying Fei was knocked back with a groan, staggering to regain his footing. His hands were covered with blood, and even his fingers were slightly twisted and burnt, as if he had been struck by lightning.

Xie Wu Wei had lifted his head to spurt a mouthful of fresh blood while his face turned pale and the giant scorpion phantom behind him rapidly shattered. He seemed to have suffered a serious injury.

Xi Lei, who had the toughest physique among them, was sent flying hundreds of metres away, and it took him some effort to finally stabilize himself, leaving him flabbergasted.

Three Monster Kings acting together were actually all wounded by Feng Xuan alone.

*Chi chi chi… *

Just like the last radiance of the sunset, the purple thunderbolt extinguished after a few final flashes.

Feng Xuan stood less than ten metres in front of Yang Kai, holding the Wind and Thunder Divine Spear, glaring at him with his teeth gritted.

These last ten metres now seemed like an unsurpassable valley that Feng Xuan could not cross no matter how he tried. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Yang Kai did not move an inch, simply staring back at him with cold eyes.

“Little bastard! This King will still kill you even if he must turn into a ghost to do it!” Feng Xuan grinned hideously, blood oozing from his mouth.

While speaking, his Third-Order Emperor Realm aura rapidly weakened while even his black hair turned grey in the blink of an eye.

Although he forced back and even wounded the three Monster Kings in the last exchange of blows, Xi Lei and the others were not to be taken lightly. In exchange for suffering some injuries, they had delivered fatal wounds to Feng Xuan.

“Then we shall see if you have the chance to become a ghost!” Yang Kai sneered and with a stretch of his arm, a black banner appeared in his palm. The black banner was filled with austere gloominess while cries and howls could be heard coming out of it from time to time.

Netherworld Purgatory Banner!

It was the relic of the Netherworld Sect Elder Hua Fei Chen, an Emperor Artifact that could devour Souls and twist them for its owner’s own use.

Yang Kai lifted the Netherworld Purgatory Banner in his hand, “After you die, this Young Master will keep your Soul in this banner. Heh heh, a Third-Order Emperor’s Soul will make a fine primary Soul for this artifact.”

*Pu… *

Hearing this, Feng Xuan could not hold on anymore and spurted a mouthful of blood into the sky, including the pieces of his internal organs.

With Yang Kai possessing such an evil thing, Feng Xuan probably did not have the chance to be a ghost even if he died, as ultimately, he would be collected by Yang Kai as a puppet.

With this as the final blow, after spurting a mouthful of blood, Feng Xuan’s eyes dimmed and the vitality of his body quickly dissipated. After a tremble, he crashed down to the ground.

Yang Kai watched coldly, but he did not really collect his Soul into the Netherworld Purgatory Banner; after all, he had not refined this thing before and he did not know how to collect a Soul yet.

Before Feng Xuan’s body reached the ground though, Yang Kai sent out a burst of Emperor Qi with a palm strike, smashing the body into a mist of blood instantly.

Then, Yang Kai stretched out his hand and seized the Wind and Thunder Divine Spear.

“That guy was quite amazing!” Ying Fei and the others gradually moved closer, looking below with lingering fear on their faces.

“Not him, it’s this thing that’s amazing!” Yang Kai played with the Wind and Thunder Divine Spear for a moment before stuffing it into his Space Ring.
