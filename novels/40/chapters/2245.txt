“Elder Gao!” Yang Kai cupped his fists in salute.

Gao Xue Ting gently nodded, and said with concern, “How did your retreat go?”

“Thanks to Elder Gao’s blessings, it was successful.”

“Glib-tongued flattery!” Gao Xue Ting glared at him, “Your retreat had nothing to do with me.”

“Uh...” Yang Kai did not expect Gao Xue Ting to be so blunt about his thoughtless flattery, and could not help feeling a little embarrassed.

“Tell me, why are you looking for me?” Gao Xue Ting restored her look of indifference.

“Oh, it’s like this,” moving on to the main reason he was there, Yang Kai quickly got up and continued. “I want to ask Elder Gao if there is any Facetless Profound Grass in Azure Sun Temple?”

“Facetless Profound Grass?” Gao Xue Ting’s brow wrinkled.

“It’s a kind of Dao Source Grade Mid-Rank spirit grass, it’s not a rare thing.” Yang Kai was an Alchemist himself, and he was deeply knowledgeable with spiritual flowers and exotic herbs.

“What do you want this for?” Gao Xue Ting asked curiously.

“Alchemy,” Yang Kai said insincerely, looking away, and continued. “Elder Gao, you know that I am an Alchemist, and I obviously want spirit grass for Alchemy...”

The corners of Gao Xue Ting’s lips raised slightly, her smile barely noticeable, but did not further question Yang Kai’s clumsy denial. She took out her communication artifact, transmitted Divine Sense into it, and said indifferently, “Let me ask. We should have it in the storehouse if this spirit grass is not a rare thing.”

“Many thanks, Elder Gao.” Yang Kai quickly thanked her.

There was a long period of silence.

Yang Kai felt extremely ill at ease standing in the secluded cave mansion. He wanted to break the silence by starting a topic with Gao Xue Ting, but worried that she might prefer him keeping his mouth shut, therefore decided to continue the awkward silence.

Gao Xue Ting did not engage in a conversation. She just closed her eyes and meditated, completely unaffected by Yang Kai’s presence, as if he did not exist.

After a while, the communication artifact in Gao Xue Ting’s hand started to hum.

She opened her beautiful eyes, transmitted information with the communication artifact, and said to Yang Kai, “There is Facetless Profound Grass in the storehouse, a lot of it. How much do you want?”

“The more, the better!” Yang Kai was pleased.

“It looks like you’re planning to refine a lot of pills,” Gao Xue Ting snorted.

Yang Kai laughed shyly.

“What are you going to exchange for them?”

“Huh?” Yang Kai was stunned.

Gao Xue Ting said, “The Facetless Profound Grass belongs to the temple, it can’t be given to you for free, can it? What are you going to exchange for them?”

“Is Elder Gao doing business with me?” Yang Kai was surprised. He had never thought Gao Xue Ting had such a side of her.

“You can say so.” Gao Xue Ting nodded, “Were you planning to take them for free?”

Yang Kai said quickly, “How is that possible?! I was planning to buy them.” After a pause, he asked timidly, “Will you accept Source Crystals?”

“We’re not short of Source Crystals.” Gao Xue Ting replied without expression.

Speechless, Yang Kai said, “What do you use, if not Source Crystals, in business deals?”

“Hmph!” Gao Xue Ting sneered, giving him a thoughtful look before saying, “Forget it, I’ll ask Junior Sister Chen for their price.”

“Many thanks...” Yang Kai wiped the sweat on his forehead.

For some reason, he was always under great pressure whenever he was with Gao Xue Ting, a phenomenon that never happened even when he was with Wen Zi Shan, and he had no idea why.

A moment later, Gao Xue Ting looked at Yang Kai again, “Junior Sister Chen informed me that the Facetless Profound Grass cost a thousand Source Crystals a piece.”

“It’s a reasonable price,” Yang Kai was overjoyed.

“High-Rank Source Crystals!” Gao Xue Ting added.

Yang Kai was stunned for a moment, then jumped up and said, “Are you trying to rob me?”

Gao Xue Ting was indifferent, “Junior Sister Chen is responsible for the temple storehouse, and she decides everything for the storehouse. If she said it’s a thousand High-Rank Source Crystals, then a thousand High-Rank Source Crystals it is.”

Then she said, “What’s wrong? Are you too poor?”

“Not really,” sweat was beading and dripping down Yang Kai’s forehead as his face twitched slightly, “It’s just that... the price is not right. Elder Gao, have you made it clear to Elder Chen that Facetless Profound Grass is a Mid-rank Dao Source Grade spirit grass, and it’s not some rare spirit grass? It can be easily cultivated by any big Sect, so how could it cost so many Source Crystals?”

“Who do you think this Queen is? Your messenger? If you want to know, ask her yourself,” Gao Xue Ting’s already cold face became colder.

Yang Kai was embarrassed by her sudden outburst, he did not know what she was angry about, and was helpless.

“But...” Gao Xue Ting changed her tone. She kept her eyes on Yang Kai, making him shiver. He thought to himself, [Elder Gao looks cold as ice on the surface, but in fact, could she be as hot as fire on the inside?]

That idea scared him, making him anxious.

“Junior Sister Chen said that if you don’t have the money to buy it, you can... pay with your body,” Gao Xue Ting said meaningfully.

*Gudong... *

Yang Kai could not help gulping as cold sweat dripped down his cheeks.

“Don’t misunderstand,” Gao Xue Ting explained. “Junior Sister Chen meant that if you join the temple and become a disciple, you can enjoy a big discount, you can even have those Facetless Profound Grass for free, and you can refine as many pills as you wish”

“Become a disciple of the temple?” Yang Kai looked at her in amazement.

“Are you not willing?” Gao Xue Ting looked over coldly, her voice dropping a few degrees, “Are you looking down on the temple? Is it not good enough for you?”

“No, absolutely not,” Yang Kai waved his hands frantically. “It’s just that Azure Sun Temple is such a big Sect. Is it really okay to recruit someone without any procedures?”

Gao Xue Ting snorted, “Normally you’d have to pass all kinds of examinations and tests to become a disciple. To put it bluntly, the temple only recruits new disciples once every ten years. At that time, several hundred thousand people participate in the trials in Azure Sun Mountain Range and no more than three hundred are ever accepted. Even among these three hundred disciples, only half will become true disciples while the others will remain outer disciples who never have an opportunity to enter the Inner Sect, but you...” she slanted her eyes towards Yang Kai, “We might be able to make an exception.”

She looked at Yang Kai as if she just offered him a great deal, and it would be a great loss if he were to refuse.

“Hehe...” Yang Kai laughed dryly. “Then many thanks to Elder Gao and Elder Chen for their good intentions.”

“So, what is your decision?” Gao Xue Ting questioned further, not giving Yang Kai time to think at all.

Yang Kai cleared his throat, fully aware of the seriousness of this question. He appeared to be calm, but his mind was spinning.

Soon, he replied, “Elder Gao should know that Junior is used to wandering freely and has never joined any Sect before...”

“What about the Blue Feather Sect?” Gao Xue Ting interrupted him directly.

Yang Kai stared at Gao Xue Ting and asked, “Elder Gao, did you secretly investigate me?”

Gao Xue Ting said lightly, “We performed a casual check, and this information wasn’t hard to obtain. As you said, our Sect is a great Sect and has many connections, it’s not a difficult task at all to investigate a few people.”

The corners of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched and said, “Then how much does Elder Gao know about this Junior?”

Gao Xue Ting said, “Apart from the colour of your underwear, this Queen knows everything, including that you’re not a native of the Star Boundary.”

Yang Kai was sweating profusely as he wiped his forehead, “Elder Gao is really well-informed.”

On the inside, he was cursing out Bian Yu Qing. If he was not mistaken, Gao Xue Ting’s source of information was definitely her.

Bian Yu Qing was just a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator. If Gao Xue Ting really wanted information from her, there was no way Bian Yu Qing could refuse.

Yang Kai just wondered when Gao Xue Ting had done this.

“Since Elder Gao knows about Junior’s past with Blue Feather Sect, Elder Gao must also know why I joined and what happened after,” Yang Kai knew he could not hide it any longer and could only tell the truth.

“En,” Gao Xue Ting nodded.

“I was quite unhappy during those months in Blue Feather Sect!” Yang Kai said seriously.

“Oh, don’t worry, the temple is different from those small Sects like Blue Feather Sect. You will feel at home here. If you want, this Queen can even take you as her Disciple and teach you how to cultivate,” Hearing this, Yang Kai gaped at Gao Xue Ting in surprise.

Her making such a proposal showed that Gao Xue Ting really wanted to recruit him into Azure Sun Temple.

However, even from an objective standpoint, Yang Kai did have such potential.

He was young and had good cultivation, an obvious target for all major Sects to compete for.

Moreover, he was a Dao Source Grade Alchemist and also a cultivator from the Lower Star Fields. He was strong and had a strong foundation, having also taken an Extraordinary Treasure Pill. In other words, it was only a matter of time before he broke through to the Emperor Realm.

Azure Sun Temple did not want to let go of a potential Emperor. His qualifications were enough for Gao Xue Ting to want to recruit him.

Of course, with Gao Xue Ting’s aloof personality, this was not a task she would normally take up unless someone had directed her, and who other than Wen Zi Shan could be the person behind that?

Yang Kai figured everything out very quickly and was honestly quite tempted.

Gao Xue Ting’s proposal was not very shrewd, but it was very sincere. During this period, Yang Kai also felt the sincerity and concern of the few Azure Sun Temple Elders and he got along well with Xia Sheng and the other disciples.

It was not a bad idea to be a disciple of Azure Sun Temple.

There would be all kinds of advantages to joining a great force like Azure Sun Temple and few would ever dare to challenge such a disciple.

However, Yang Kai had his own concerns.

His biggest concern was the Demon Spirit sealed in his body.

When he was possessed by the Demon Spirit and was reduced to a Demon that day, he had battled against Gao Xue Ting. If he really joined the temple, in the case that this information was disclosed, he was unsure what Gao Xue Ting would do to him.

The Demon Spirit of the Ancient Great Demon was not something that could be ignored.
