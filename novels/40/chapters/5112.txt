After giving it some thought, Yang Kai soon realised what the other man was talking about, “That arm ring?”

Certainly, he was aware that there was an arm ring on Hei Yuan’s right arm; after all, he had frequently come into contact with him. Although Yang Kai knew that it was an artifact made by a Human Artifact Refiner, it never crossed his mind that it was crafted by Wang Si Bo.

As expected, Wang Si Bo nodded, “Indeed. It was an arm ring. Back then, Hei Yuan found me and told me to make a defensive artifact for him; therefore, I specifically made the arm ring for him. Although the defensive artifact isn’t very strong, it’s not weak either. It might save his life at a critical moment. Since you’ve seen it before, it means that he’s still wearing it.”

Yang Kai nodded, “En.”

“It will be easy, then,” Wang Si Bo put on a smile, “Junior Brother, you’re an Artifact Refiner yourself, so you know that we have a habit of leaving unique marks on the artifacts we make to show that they are our works.”

Certainly, Yang Kai was aware of this custom. Just like Wang Si Bo had said, many Artifact Refiners had a habit of leaving their unique mark on the artifacts they refined. Of course, they wouldn’t leave a mark on every artifact they crafted, only the special and unique ones. The reason Artifact Refiners did such a thing was that they wanted to make a name for themselves. On the other hand, an artifact with a unique mark of an Artifact Refining Grandmaster would be costly.

The marks could either be conspicuous or hidden, it was fully at the Artifact Refiner’s discretion.

In fact, Yang Kai had done such a thing as well; however, he didn’t leave a unique mark but instead a kind of hidden restriction. He left such a restriction in every artifact he refined for the Feudal Lords. When he dealt with Zha Gu, he activated the corresponding restrictions, disrupting the flow of energy in the artifacts on Zha Gu’s body, rendering them brittle and useless. That was how he managed to kill him with one strike back then.

Therefore, he could easily understand what Wang Si Bo was talking about at this moment, “Did you leave a mark in that arm ring?”

“En,” Wang Si Bo nodded. There was no doubt that the arm ring he made for Hei Yuan was valuable, which was why he left his unique mark on it, “I can make something to trace that mark. Perhaps it will allow you to find Hei Yuan. However, if he’s hiding in a Sealed World or if he’s too far away, it won’t work.”

If Hei Yuan was hiding in a Sealed Would, he couldn’t be traced as the signal from the mark couldn’t be traced across a World Barrier. On the other hand, if he was too far away, they simply would be able to connect to the mark.

With that said, it was worth giving it a try and Yang Kai promptly said, “In that case, please do what you can, Senior Brother Wang. It would be best if we can seize this chance to kill Hei Yuan, but if that’s not possible, we can just return to the Inner Sanctum.”

Certainly, Wang Si Bo wouldn’t turn him down.

However, he wasn’t able to freely use his power in Yang Kai’s Small Universe. Left with no choice, Yang Kai could only look for a safe place first.

Fortunately, there were a lot of Sealed Worlds within the Black Ink Clan’s territory. While Yang Kai was raising chaos, he discovered a lot of hidden portals to Sealed Worlds, but he didn’t have time to explore them; hence, it wasn’t hard for him to find a Sealed World now.

It only took him a day to locate a Sealed World, and after opening the portal, he entered and let Wang Si Bo out from his Small Universe. He had already prepared all the materials needed for Artifact Refining.

It wasn’t difficult to craft a tracker, but it would still most likely take Wang Si Bo several days. Yang Kai thus released Wu Xing He and the others so that they could protect Wang Si Bo while he searched around the Sealed World for any potential dangers. By doing so, he could explore this place as well.

If there were any rare Spirit Herbs or Profound Yin Spirit Fruits, he could pick them.

As he explored the Sealed World, Yang Kai pondered on where Hei Yuan was hiding.

Although Wang Si Bo could craft a tracker, it wouldn’t be useful if Hei Yuan was too far away; therefore, Yang Kai had to speculate where Hei Yuan was so that they could make better use of the tracker.

Since Hei Yuan’s Soul had been badly injured, he must be recuperating now.

A Black Ink Nest would be the best choice if a Black Ink Clansman wanted to recuperate. As a Territory Lord, Hei Yuan certainly had to go into a Territory Lord Rank Black Ink Nest to properly heal; however, Yang Kai was causing a storm in Mu Guang’s Royal Domain, targeting Mid-Rank Black Ink Nests. Hence, Hei Yuan might not have the guts to enter one. If he was cornered by Yang Kai in a Black Ink Nest, he would be in hot water.

Hence, Yang Kai was 80% sure that Hei Yuan wasn’t in any Black Ink Nest.

He believed that Hei Yuan would be hiding in a region where those Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest had already been destroyed. That was because there were no longer Black Ink Nests in such a place. Judging from what Yang Kai had been doing, he wouldn’t revisit such a place; thus, it would be considered a safe zone for Hei Yuan.

He might even be hiding in his own territory to fool his opponent.

A few days later, Yang Kai returned from the depths of the Sealed World. There were no valuable items in this Sealed World. He had picked a few herbs, but there were no Profound Yin Spirit Fruits.

During this period of time, Wang Si Bo had finished making the tracker.

Seeing Yang Kai, he passed something that looked like a compass to him and explained, “With the help of this thing, you’ll be able to detect the arm ring as long as it’s within range. You should find Hei Yuan when you detect the arm ring’s presence.”

“Got it.” Yang Kai nodded.

“Be cautious, Junior Brother. Although Hei Yuan has been weakened, he’s still a Territory Lord. Run away if you can’t defeat him,” Wang Si Bo said with concern.

Yang Kai replied, “Don’t worry, Senior Brother. I have to bring all of you back to the Inner Sanctum, so I won’t take any big risks.”

After moving Wang Si Bo and the others back inside his Small Universe, Yang Kai left the Sealed World. Upon identifying the direction with the help of his Universe Chart, he headed straight towards Hei Yuan’s territory.

Yang Kai held the compass in his hand, and he would take a look at it from time to time. Nevertheless, it didn’t react along the way.

Whenever he ran into a group of Black Ink Clansmen, he would directly kill them all. There wasn’t even a single Feudal Lord among the Black Ink Clansmen that he came across, so how were they supposed to stop him?

It seemed that his speculation was right. All the Feudal Lords had headed to the neighbouring Mid-Rank Black Ink Nests to help and waited for Yang Kai to arrive; therefore, there wasn’t a single Feudal Lord among the Black Ink Clansmen on patrol.

Yang Kai went on a killing spree for the next seven to eight days before he arrived at Hei Yuan’s territory.

He headed straight to Hei Yuan’s home territory, since he speculated that Hei Yuan was trying to deceive him by hiding in the least likely spot for him to look. This place also made sense for Hei Yuan though as this was where his foundation was. If he wanted to recuperate without relying on a Black Ink Nest, this place would be the best choice.

However, when Yang Kai arrived at the universe fragment and took a look at the compass, he realised that there was no reaction.

[Is Hei Yuan not here?]

Yang Kai frowned.

He certainly had trust in the thing Wang Si Bo crafted. This compass wasn’t a complicated artifact and Wang Si Bo was an Artifact Refining Grandmaster, so the items he refined couldn’t possibly be useless.

Since the compass didn’t react, it suggested that Hei Yuan wasn’t here.

It seemed that Yang Kai’s speculation was wrong, so he was disappointed.

Nevertheless, since he was already here, he wouldn’t want to go back without achieving anything. As he took a glance at the shattered universe fragment, he activated the power of his Dragon Vein and roared. The next instant, he turned into a 30,000-metre-long Dragon.

Life hadn’t been peaceful for the Black Ink Clansmen living on this universe fragment.

When the Human named Yang Kai appeared as a Grand Dragon previously, not only did he destroy the Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest and kill a lot of Black Ink Clansmen, but he also shattered the universe fragment. As a result, the city was ruined, and a lot of the resources in the shops were stolen.

There was originally a Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest that continuously produced Black Ink Strength here, which was the foundation that the Black Ink Clansmen relied on to survive. Now that the Black Ink Nest was destroyed, the Black Ink Strength around the universe fragment became thinner and thinner. A long time had passed, but the injured Black Ink Clansmen still hadn’t managed to recover.

It was imaginable that the remaining Black Ink Strength would be gone for good in no time. When that happened, the situation here would only exacerbate.

On the other hand, Hei Yuan was missing. Initially, there were still some Feudal Lords in this area, but they had left soon after. It seemed that they had headed out to protect other Mid-Rank Black Ink Nests.

The Black Ink Clansmen living on the universe fragment were apprehensive about their future. Although some High-Rank Clansmen assured them that Hei Yuan wouldn’t abandon them, and that he would get another Black Ink Nest to rebuild their foundation, their efforts did little to assuage these fears.

Just as the Black Ink Clansmen on the universe fragment were lost in their own anxiety, they heard a Dragon Roar coming from the distance, and it sounded familiar.

The Black Ink Clansmen looked up and saw that there was a colossal Grand Dragon with a golden glow descending from the sky, shaking its head and flicking its tail as it swam towards them.

[Why is he here again!?]

The Black Ink Clansmen on the universe fragment were stunned. It was said that this Grand Dragon had been targeting Territory Lord Rank Black Ink Nests, but since the Black Ink Nest in this place had been destroyed, why was he here now?

Before they could figure out the reason, the Grand Dragon was upon them. Wherever he went, Black Ink Clansmen would die.

When Yang Kai arrived at this place as a Grand Dragon previously, he faced resistance from a lot of Feudal Lords; however, this time, the most powerful opponents were just High-Rank Black Ink Clansmen. Faced with Yang Kai’s intense Dragon Pressure, these Black Ink Clansmen were so terrified they ran away at first sight, not daring to clash with him.

The Grand Dragon destroyed everything in sight as though there was no one else in this place. As he breathed out his Dragon Breath, the Black Ink Clansmen screamed in terror and pain.

When Yang Kai left two hours later, the entire universe fragment was thoroughly shattered.

Countless Black Ink Clansmen had lost their lives during the carnage. It was estimated that over 100,000 Black Ink Clansmen had perished. Although there wasn’t a Feudal Lord among them, these High-Rank and Low-Rank Black Ink Clansmen were still part of the Black Ink Clan’s foundation. Their deaths could potentially affect the Black Ink Clan’s survival as a whole.

What’s more, all the resources in all the shops had been snatched up.

Although Yang Kai had previously looted several shops, he didn’t obtain everything as he was in a hurry. This time, he could pillage without any worries, so he picked the Black Ink Clan clean.

The entire universe was shattered, and innumerable Black Ink Clansmen had lost their lives. It could be said that Hei Yuan’s home territory was thoroughly destroyed.

This was probably the first Territory Lord territory to be completely wiped out by a Human in history.
