“Then you’d better open your dog eyes wide and watch!” Yang Kai pointed his spear at Zuo Quan Hui and coldly shouted, “Kill!”

But the people around him remained motionless.

Yue He nervously looked at him nervously, “Young Master!”

If everyone failed to understand what just happened before, why were they suddenly together when they were clearly separated, how could they not understand after hearing what Zuo Quan Hui said?

Much to their dismay, Yang Kai had actually manifested his Small Universe inside Zuo Quan Hui’s Small Universe World, endangering himself. It was really reckless of him, and just as Zuo Quan Hui said, both of their Small Universes now shared the same fate, whatever happened to one, would happen to the other as well. If they were to really attack, it would not only destroy Zuo Quan Hui’s Small Universe, but also Yang Kai’s Small Universe. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Unless they could find a place where their Small Universes weren’t overlapping, only then could they have a chance to only affect Zuo Quan Hui. But as things stood, how could Zuo Quan Hui allow them to do so? He was more than happy to see Yang Kai’s fate tied to his.

No one dared to act rashly in this current situation.

“What are you all waiting for? Attack!” Yang Kai shouted, “This is a Heaven-sent opportunity! If we don’t act now, we won’t get another chance in the future!”

Yue He’s eyes turned red as she grit her teeth and shouted, “Young Master, you must hold on!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she took the lead and charged straight towards Zuo Quan Hui, closely followed by the other Sixth-Order Master!

Zuo Quan Hui was extremely stunned, “Boy, you’re insane!”

Before Zuo Quan Hui could finish cursing, he was forced to flee as a series of destructive Divine Abilities came shooting at him, his heart filled with shock at Yang Kai’s ruthless determination.

A series of explosions reverberated as the ground and the sky cracked at a spot where the Small Universes overlapped.

Yang Kai spurted a large mouthful of blood as he felt his Soul violently trembling. What he was doing was akin to sacrificing 800 of his soldiers to kill 1,000 of the enemy’s. Now, it all came down to who fell first, Zuo Quan Hui or him.

Suddenly, Yang Kai turned his head and cursed, “Wu Kuang, you bastard!”

Wu Kuang didn’t attack Zuo Quan Hui, but instead sat down sitting cross-legged, madly using the Heaven Devouring Battle Law to devour the surrounding World Force!

Yang Kai was so angry that he almost coughed up blood. Wu Kuang’s act of devouring World Force like this might be harming Zuo Quan Hui, but Yang Kai couldn’t escape from it either. Furthermore, he was so brazen that he actually sat down next to Yang Kai, as if he wanted the latter to protect him.

Yang Kai could not wait to take out his Azure Dragon Spear and plunge it right into his heart!

However, Wu Kuang shamelessly raised his head and added with a serious look on his face, “You should not divert your attention during this life and death battle!”

Yang Kai suppressed the boiling blood in his heart and quickly took out a Low-Rank World Fruit and swallowed it, forcefully calming his nerves.

He then turned his head, avoiding looking at him. What the eyes did not see, the heart did not grieve.

Before refining the World Fruit’s medicinal efficacy, Yang Kai stuffed another one into his mouth.

After eating two World Fruits, Yang Kai finally had the confidence to drag Zuo Quan Hui down to his death. He raised his head, looking at the battle that was raging on the other side; Zuo Quan Hui was at the end of his rope, though he was still desperately struggling.

It wasn’t that Yang Kai didn’t want to step forward to help, but since the two Small Universes were stacked together now, he needed to exert all of his strength to interfere with Zuo Quan Hui’s control over the surrounding World.

Had he not been suppressing Zuo Quan Hui here, how could the latter be so weak? Zuo Quan Hui had to divert some of his attention to deal with the attacks of a dozen or so Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters while enduring the backlash caused by the destruction to his Small Universe, while at the same time resist Yang Kai’s interference, so how could he not be at a disadvantage?

With time, Yang Kai could clearly feel his Small Universe’s foundation rapidly depleting! Fortunately, he had eaten two Low-Rank World Fruits, allowing him to slowly replenish what he was losing, but he was still unable to make ends meet.

Zuo Quan Hui’s situation was even worse. His body was covered in blood and his hair was disheveled. It looked as if he had reached the end of his road, and as he unleashed his Divine Abilities one after another, he no longer bore the awe-inspiring might of a Seventh-Order Master.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s brow twitched as a look of joy appeared on his face. He could feel Zuo Quan Hui’s Small Universe rapidly shrinking. Zuo Quan Hui was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so his Small Universe was much bigger than Yang Kai, but now, it was actually getting smaller.

This way, it would be easier for him to suppress Zuo Quan Hui.

Sure enough, when their Small Universes broke that critical point, Zuo Quan Hui’s performance became much worse.

As if this old man realized that he was doomed, his attacks became fiercer. It looked like he wanted to take a few people down with him before dying!

How could Yang Kai allow him to do as he pleased? With a single thought, Yang Kai used his own Divine Abilities and coordinated with everyone else’s attacks.

In an instant, Zuo Quan Hui’s figure came to a halt as his imposing momentum suddenly plummeted and he staggered, spurting out a mouthful of blood.

At the same time, over a dozen Divine Abilities bombarded Zuo Quan Hui, sending him flying like a paper kite before heavily crashing to the ground.

It had not been that long, but he was now gasping for breath.

However, no one dared to lower their guard as all of them gathered around him and waited.

Yang Kai kicked Wu Kuang, who was sitting next to him motionlessly and was only focused on swallowing energy, to the ground, “Stop! Your table manners are beyond unsightly!”

After cursing and venting his anger, Yang Kai covered his mouth and lightly coughed, covering his palm in golden blood.

Wu Kuang had obtained a great bargain, so he couldn’t be bothered to argue with Yang Kai over his rude actions. He simply stood up and patted his butt, a look of dissatisfaction appearing on his face.

Shouldering the Azure Dragon Spear, Yang Kai stepped forward and asked in a low voice, “Zuo Quan Hui, do you have any last words?”

Zuo Quan Hui, who was loudly wheezing, stared blankly into the void.

Yang Kai stood not far from him, looking at him indifferently, “Don’t have any unrealistic fantasies. Your cultivation has already fallen to the Sixth-Order, and your Small Universe has become unstable. There is no hope for you to advance again in this life even if you survive, so why not just die?”

When the surrounding crowd heard this, they discovered that Zuo Quan Hui’s omnipresent aura was rapidly fading. Furthermore, the surrounding scenery was also distorting. It was obvious that Zuo Quan Hui’s cultivation had fallen to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm and his Small Universe was no longer able to maintain its solid form.

Everyone let out a sigh of relief!

They were extremely wary of this Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master; after all, Zuo Quan Hui was a veteran powerhouse, so who knew what kind of trump cards he was still hiding? If Zuo Quan Hui really managed to drag some of them down with him, their losses would outweigh the gains.

But since he had fallen to the Sixth-Order, the threat he posed was greatly reduced, making him look like a tiger without its fangs.

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, Zuo Quan Hui moved and slowly sat up straight, crossing his legs as he stared at Yang Kai indifferently, “I’m afraid the future will be quite exciting with a monster like you appearing in the 3,000 Worlds.”

“You flatter me!” Yang Kai maintained a stoic face.

“Unfortunately, this Old Master won’t be able to see it.” Zuo Quan Hui sighed, “After I die, that disciple of mine won’t be able to escape death either, right?”

Yang Kai raised his chin, “Don’t worry, I’ll let her reunite with you as soon as possible. Well, maybe she’s already waiting for you on the road to the Yellow Springs.”

Zuo Quan Hui nodded, “It’s up to you, the winner is the King, and the loser is the villain. If you had lost, your fate wouldn’t be any better than this Monarch’s.”

Yang Kai clapped his hands and scoffed, “You’ve got quite a vivid imagination!”

Zuo Quan Hui smiled at him, “There will come a day when you will understand.”

Saying so, he suddenly made a hand seal and asked, looking at Yang Kai, “Do you know why a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master won’t easily open their Small Universe to kill their enemy, even if it is a trump card that every High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master can use?”

Yang Kai slightly furrowed his brow, “Please enlighten me!”

Zuo Quan Hui replied, “Because if we do this, even if we successfully kill the enemy, there will be no end to the trouble, just like this!”

The next moment, Zuo Quan Hui’s figure shook. Yang Kai could clearly feel the aura of a Small Universe collapsing as World Force spread out!

Everyone watching was shocked, Zuo Quan Hui’s action would undoubtedly disintegrate and collapse his Small Universe. The Small Universe World was the foundation of an Open Heaven Realm Master. Once the Small Universe collapsed, the Open Heaven Realm Master would not be far from death.

Zuo Quan Hui had fallen to the Sixth-Order, so even if he still had the strength to mount up a fight, he would only be humiliating himself. Rather than losing his life to the enemy, he preferred to end his own life!

Not everyone possessed such courage.

Zuo Quan Hui, who had shattered his own Small Universe, started loudly laughing, “Boy, this Monarch will teach you a lesson with his life! You should cherish it!”

While he was laughing, Zuo Quan Hui’s head drooped down as he died!

An Inner Sect Elder of Thousand Crane Paradise had fallen!

Yang Kai’s expression changed drastically as he stomped his feet and cursed, “Why can’t this old dog just die peacefully!?”

Yang Kai’s figure shook and his World Force was mobilized, sealing the surrounding region! With them as the center, everything within a 10,000-kilometres radius was completely sealed.

Yang Kai finally understood what Zuo Quan Hui meant when he said there would be no end to the trouble.

The old man had broken his own Small Universe and poured his World Force into Yang Kai’s Small Universe. Not only was this energy not beneficial to Yang Kai though, it was akin to a kind of impurity as it was wholly incompatible with his own body. In short, this foreign energy was corroding his Small Universe.

Had Yang Kai not quickly reacted and sealed off the surrounding 10,000-kilometres, and allowed this energy to fill his Small Universe, it would have been difficult for him to remove it. He would have had to spend a great deal of time and energy in retreat.

In other words, although High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters could use this trump card to kill enemies, and it was their most powerful trump card at that, it could not be used lightly.

Regardless of whether the enemy committed suicide or was killed, once their World Force leaked out, it would be akin to swallowing a mouthful of poison.

The price Zuo Quan Hui had to pay to teach this lesson was not small, and the price to receive this lesson for Yang Kai was not small either!

Yang Kai promptly turned his head to Wu Kuang, whereupon the latter snapped at him, “What!?”

He still had not forgotten that Yang Kai kicked him before. The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor had never been a magnanimous person; otherwise, he wouldn’t have caused so many deaths!

Yang Kai snorted, “If you’re willing to take action, then do it. If you’re not, then I won’t force you. At worst, I’ll just cut off this region. In any case, it’ll only damage some of my foundation.”

Wu Kuang pretended to be slow-witted before he agreed, “Since you are asking for help, I’ll help!”

As Wu Kuang activated the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, the World Force within the 10,000-kilometres radius madly flowed into his body.

The group of Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master watching from the side instantly felt an instinctive sense of dread.

Although they had seen Wu Kuang use the Heaven Devouring Battle Law before, everyone had been fighting with Zuo Quan Hui so they hadn’t paid much attention to it. Now, when they got to see it so closely, they were all shocked.
