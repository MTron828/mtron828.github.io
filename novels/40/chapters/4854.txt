“Sold!” Luo Ting He landed her palm on the armrest. She was so forceful that the armrest directly turned into dust.

“Senior Sister!” Yu Xiang Die was torn between tears and laughter. They were talking about marriage, not an auction. Why did her Senior Sister even say it like that?

With that said, she was still stunned by the figures that Yang Kai had brought up. 1,000 Sixth-Order and 100 Seventh-Order Yin and Yang Element materials were worth countless Open Heaven Pills.

In fact, Sixth-Order and Seventh-Order Yin and Yang Element materials often couldn’t be bought with Open Heaven Pills, not to mention that those were a staggering number of strategic resources given the current situation in the world.

There was no doubt that even Yin-Yang Cave Heaven didn’t have so many materials.

It could be said that this kind of fortune was tempting enough for all the Cave Heavens and Paradises. With these resources in possession, those from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven wouldn’t have to worry about the ascension of their disciples for the next 1,000 years at least.

Yu Xiang Die soon came to her senses, “Is this the way you’re able to help create more Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters for Yin-Yang Cave Heaven that you’ve mentioned to the Sect Master?”

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “En.”

With so many resources in possession, coupled with the World Tree’s nourishment in the Star Boundary, a lot of disciples who could directly ascend to the Sixth-Order and the Seventh-Order would emerge in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. These people would have the potential to slowly make it to the Eighth-Order.

Yang Kai was unable to create more Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters directly, for he was only a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. However, the resources he had mentioned were necessary for creating Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters.

In comparison, it wasn’t unacceptable to let Qu Hua Shang marry Yang Kai.

A precedent could be created as long as he was willing to pay a good enough price.

When the leaders of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven heard about this news, they would give it a serious thought.

“Where did you get so many Sixth-Order and Seventh-Order Yin and Yang Element materials?” Disbelief was written all over Yu Xiang Die’s face. She knew a thing or two about the situation in Void Land and High Heaven Palace. Even though the New Great Territory was mysterious, it couldn’t possibly give Yang Kai so many good things.

She soon realised something after asking the question, “The Chaotic Dead Territory!”

If there was anywhere in the world that was abundant in Yin and Yang Element materials, it had to be the Chaotic Dead Territory. That was the battlefield where the Sun’s Burning Light and Moon’s Serene Glimmer unendingly clashed with each other. The war had been ongoing for countless years, so an unimaginable number of Yin and Yang Element materials must have been created.

However, it was extremely dangerous in the Chaotic Dead Territory. Even the Eighth-Order Ancestor, who had been keeping guard in front of the Territory Gate, could only enter the periphery temporarily, and his life would be at risk if he stayed too long.

Yu Xiang Die had never entered the Chaotic Dead Territory before. The Eighth-Order Ancestor who was guarding the Chaotic Dead Territory was from a different Cave Heaven, but he wasn’t stationed there forever. The Cave Heavens and Paradises would take turns to send their Ancestors to that place, so an Ancestor from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven had been there as well.

According to the Ancestor, he had tried entering the Chaotic Dead Territory and seen a lot of yellow and blue crystals from afar. The fluctuations coming from the crystals suggested that they were the Yin and Yang Element materials that people craved; however, he was unable to obtain them because he wasn’t powerful enough. That remained a regret in his heart.

After Yang Kai followed the Giant Spirit God to enter the Chaotic Dead Territory, everyone thought that he was doomed to die.

The Cave Heavens and Paradises were already astounded that he was able to leave the Chaotic Dead Territory safely, so no one could have expected that he had gained a lot of benefits from that place.

Since Yang Kai was able to offer 1,000 Sixth-Order and 100 Seventh-Order Yin and Yang Element materials, it suggested that he had obtained a lot more than that from the Chaotic Dead Territory.

Yu Xiang Die thought that he might have even gotten several dozen times more than he was offering.

However, she had no idea that the rewards Yang Kai had acquired from the Chaotic Dead Territory were simply incalculable. 1,,000 Sixth-Order and 100 Seventh-Order Yin and Yang Element materials were like a mere drop in the ocean to him.

To put it bluntly, given his wealth now, he could make everyone go mad by leaking out a bit of what he possessed.

“En, the Chaotic Dead Territory.” Yang Kai didn’t deny it. Since he was able to offer so many valuable materials, anyone who wasn’t a fool was able to figure out where he obtained them. There was no way he could hide it.

“You’ve been to the Chaotic Dead Territory?” Luo Ting He was astonished, “How did you even survive?”

“It’s a long story…” As Yang Kai recalled the time he spent dealing with Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan in the Chaotic Dead Territory, a somewhat shameful experience he’d rather not look back on.

It wasn’t like he could tell others that he had been playing games with those two for years, which was how he survived and acquired a large sum of wealth.

Swiftly changing the topic, he asked, “Martial Aunt Luo, you said it was a deal. Does that mean that you think my plan is feasible?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“It’s totally feasible.” Luo Ting He nodded repeatedly, “I can’t even contain the urge to agree to it right now; however, Qu’er’s matter is important to the Sect, so I’ll have to discuss it with those old farts. Regardless, you don’t have to worry about it. I’m sure I can reason with them since you’re able to offer so many precious materials.”

“Many thanks for the help, Martial Aunt Luo.” Yang Kai saluted her.

“Good, I’ll go over to persuade them now. Wait for me here.” Upon finishing her words, Luo Ting He directly dashed out of the place.

Yu Xiang Die put on a helpless smile and shook her head as she watched Luo Ting He leave. Then, she turned to Yang Kai and said, “You don’t have to worry about it since you’ve shown enough sincerity. I would’ve been tempted if I were one of the Sect’s Managers. Rules are dead, and they can be broken at an appropriate time. Moreover, with Senior Sister Luo around, I’m sure she’ll be able to persuade them.”

She paused for a moment, “Also, you’ve made a huge contribution for Yin-Yang Cave Heaven by bringing Senior Sister out of the Samsara Pavilion. Even if they have nothing to give you to express their gratitude, there’s no reason for them to make things difficult for you.”

“It would be good if everything goes well.” Yang Kai nodded.

“En, just wait here. I’m sure a decision will be made soon,” Yu Xiang Die said, then left as she didn’t want to keep bothering them.

As expected, a decision was soon made. Luo Ting He came over again the next day.

Qu Hua Shang had already prepared a lot of Luo Ting He’s favourite spirit fruits and swiftly served them to her.

Instead of eating though, Luo Ting He frowned with a worried expression.

Upon seeing that, Yang Kai felt his chest tightening as he had a feeling that things didn’t go as he had hoped. Forcefully calming himself down, he asked, “Martial Aunt Luo, has a decision been made?”

After letting out a sigh, Luo Ting He looked apologetically at Yang Kai, “I’ve done my best, but those old farts are too obstinate. I’m not their match.”

Instantly, Qu Hua Shang’s face turned pale. Yang Kai took her hand and gave her a comforting look before saying, “Why aren’t the Ancestors agreeing to it? Do they have other demands? Please tell me, Martial Aunt. I won’t refuse as long as I am able to comply.”

“That’s what he said!” Luo Ting He looked up at him with a smile, “You also heard it, Qu’er! I didn’t force him in any way! You’ll be the witness and make sure that he won’t go back on his word.”

Yang Kai and Qu Hua Shang were stunned.

They initially thought that it was a terrible outcome, but they were not so certain about it now upon seeing Luo Ting He’s expression.

Qu Hua Shang quickly went over to stand behind Luo Ting He and began massaging her shoulders. In an obedient manner, she asked, “Martial Aunt, what was the reply from the Elders? Please tell us.”

Luo Ting He smiled and teased her, “Are you in a rush to get married? You’re already taking your man’s side when the matter isn’t even settled yet.”

A frank Qu Hua Shang replied, “To a woman, the most important thing is to find the right man. Don’t you agree?”

After giving it a thought, Luo Ting He nodded in agreement, “You have a point. Don’t worry. How could the matter not be settled when I was the one persuading them? Although the old farts had some scruples, I managed to win them over in the end.”

An elated Qu Hua Shang asked, “Are you serious?”

“Why would I lie to you about it?” Luo Ting He picked up a spirit fruit and stuffed it into her mouth before speaking in a muffled voice, “The main reason is that Yang Kai has shown enough sincerity by offering an incredible betrothal gift. For such a price, forget about you, those old farts would even agree to let him marry me.”

Of course, that was completely impossible, for Luo Ting He had a chance to ascend to the top Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm one day. Such a person wouldn’t just be a pillar of strength in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven in the future, but it’s very foundation. Regardless of what was offered, those from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven would never let her go.

Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling a slight headache, but he still said gratefully, “Many thanks for your assistance, Martial Aunt.”

Luo Ting He waved her hand, “There’s no need to thank me yet. Although the old farts have agreed to it, they still have a demand. If you can’t fulfill it, you won’t be able to bring Qu’er with you.”

“Please tell me, Martial Aunt.”

Luo Ting He went on to say with a smile, “In any case, this isn’t really a disadvantage to you. The decision makers have agreed to let you marry Qu’er, but there’s a caveat. With it being a buy-one-get-one-free deal, Yin-Yang Cave Heaven will actually be suffering a loss.”

Qu Hua Shang, who was giving her a massage, froze for a moment before coming to her senses, “Senior Sister Tao!”

Luo Ting He nodded, “En. It’s that brat Chen Xiu who messed everything up. He doesn’t deserve to be a Master after doing something so harmful to his Disciple.”

If Yang Kai hadn’t left his aura inside Tao Ling Wan’s Small Universe by lending her a hand when she was suffering from cultivation dissonance, there would have been room to maneuver. However, Tao Ling Wan’s life or death now hinged on Yang Kai, and no one could do anything to change that.

All this had happened because of Chen Xiu’s plan.

Even though his intention was to resolve the embarrassing situation that Yin-Yang Cave Heaven was in, and he was well-meaning in that regard, it only led to an even more embarrassing situation.

Worse yet, despite his wrongdoing, it was his Disciple who had to bear the consequences.

At that instant, Yang Kai didn’t know how to reply. He had been trying to avoid this problem as he wanted to settle the matter regarding Qu Hua Shang first; however, he hadn’t expected that those from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven wanted to resolve the issues pertaining to Qu Hua Shang and Tao Ling Wan at the same time.

Just then, Qu Hua Shang directly made a decision for him, “Deal!”

A speechless Yang Kai asked, “Don’t you have to ask for my opinion first?” He could still explain himself to Su Yan and the others if he brought Qu Hua Shang back; after all, they were aware of Qu Hua Shang’s existence and what had happened during the Dao Theory Assembly. However, how was he going to come up with an explanation if Tao Ling Wan tagged along?

Yu Ru Meng and Shan Qing Luo would probably skin him alive.

Qu Hua Shang pretended that she hadn’t heard him as she continued giving Luo Ting He a massage and said with a smile, “However, please tell the Ancestors that Senior Sister Tao is not some freebee. Junior Brother will also offer 1,000 Sixth-Order and 100 Seventh-Order sets of Yin and Yang Element materials as her betrothal gift. Senior Sister Tao and I will then marry him at the same time.”

Upon finishing her words, she turned to look at Yang Kai, “Can you do it?”

Yang Kai braced himself to reply in a voice filled with tragic resolve, “Good, no problem!”
