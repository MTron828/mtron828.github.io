Chapter 816, Looks Quite Similar

Moreover, these past two years, Saintess Nan, regardless of who it was or where they were, would directly try to kill them, as if the only thing remain in her heart was killing intent, but before that, all of them had only heard that the old Saintess of Nine Heavens Holy Land was a good person with a kind heart.

The difference between the two and the way her personality suddenly changed was just too drastic.

Also, several days ago, Saintess Nan attacking Nine Heavens Holy Land was a fact.

Some of the gathered masters were shaken by Yang Kai’s words; in the end, they weren’t eager to become enemies with Nine Heavens Holy Land.

“Boy, stop speaking nonsense!” Zhang Ao glared at Yang Kai, “You say that Saintess Nan is already dead? How can a dead person go around killing people? Do you think we’re all fools you can deceive with such an obvious lie?”

“That’s right, if she was really dead, how could she have done all that?”

“Then I ask you, why would the Holy Land want this to happen? Allowing Saintess Nan to go on a wanton slaughter, what advantage does that bring to the Holy Land?” Yang Kai asked.

Zhang Ao opened his mouth to speak but couldn’t think of anything to say.

Most of the forces here had come because they had suffered losses at Saintess Nan’s hands and wanted the Holy Land to give them justice. In truth, the only ones who really wanted to eliminate Nine Heavens Holy Land were the three forces led by Zhang Ao, and they were simply taking advantage of this opportunity to act.

“Boy, enough of your rubbish! What thing are you? You think you have the qualifications to speak with this old master,” Zhang Ao disdainfully snorted, “The only one here who is qualified to speak with this old master is Xu Hui. Xu Hui, have you gone senile in your old age? Actually allowing a snot nosed brat to speak for you, truly laughable!”

“I’m not qualified to speak with you?” Yang Kai grinned, “Sorry, I think I’m the most qualified to speak here.”

Zhang Ao frowned, not understanding what Yang Kai was talking about.

“I am the new Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land. Do you still want to say I lack the qualifications to speak to you?” Yang Kai said calmly as he looked down on Zhang Ao.

When this statement came out, everyone stared dumbfounded towards Yang Kai.

Even Xu Hui and the other Holy Land Elders wore looks of shock, but soon their eyes lit up as they gazed towards Yang Kai’s back, each of them silently shouting joyfully in their hearts.

He acknowledged it! He personally acknowledged it!

Yang Kai had actually acknowledged that he was the new Holy Master of the Holy Land in front of these thousands of people.

Xu Hui even felt the urge to throw his head back and laugh. During the past year, he had constantly been working hard to make Yang Kai feel a sense of belonging to Nine Heavens Holy Land, but Yang Kai had never relented, and although Xu Hui felt Yang Kai’s attitude had changed a bit after returning from the Monster Domain, until now everything had still just been fleeting.

But after declaring himself the new Holy Master in front of so many people, even if he wanted to change his mind in the future it wouldn’t be possible.

At this moment, all the masters from the Holy Land, including Xu Hui, felt a great weight lift from their hearts. The sense of relief that filled their souls made even the difficulties in front of them seem insignificant.

Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong, the two beautiful women, suddenly appeared even more radiant and spirited.

Vaguely, they seemed to see a great pillar which supported the Holy Land stand back up again, supporting the nine peaks.

“The new Holy Master?” Zhang Ao’s complexion suddenly became somewhat pale as he stared at Yang Kai in disbelief; War Temple’s Cao Guan also wore a frown as a cold light flashed across his eyes.

Wu Jie of Netherworld Sect simply grinned and let out a somewhat creepy laugh as he whispered to himself, “Interesting, we thought they were a bamboo basket incapable of carrying water... yet they already have a new Holy Master.”

These three forces had brought together and misled a great many masters not just to destroy Nine Heavens Holy Land but to occupy the foundation of the Holy Land, and what they most valued was the core inheritance of Nine Heavens Holy Land.

Who wouldn’t covet an inheritance which guaranteed a person could easily break through to the Third Order Saint Realm?

As long as they could overwhelm Nine Heavens Holy Land, capture An Ling’er, and join her to one of their Sects’ elite disciples, they would only need to spend some years to cultivate a top level powerhouse. At that time, their forces would be completely reborn and become existences no less powerful than Nine Heavens Holy Land.

So when they heard Yang Kai say this, whether it was Zhang Ao or Cao Guan, both of them couldn’t help feeling frustrated and angry, as if the treasure they had coveted had actually been snatched right from under their noses.

“Xu Hui, what he said... is it true?” Zhang Ao asked, his expression becoming gloomy.

Xu Hui took a step forward and with a solemn expression declared, “Yes, for more than half a year, my Holy Land has had a new Holy Master, but as these days have been quite busy, we had yet to make a public announcement. However, there is no need to hide this fact any longer.”

Listening to him, Zhang Ao felt a little disheartened.

It was no impossible for him to accomplish his biggest goal here. Even if he could lay claim to Nine Heavens Holy Land, he wouldn’t be able to acquire this mysterious inheritance.

Cao Guan saw his partner’s interest begin to fade and quickly passed a Divine Sense message to him, causing Zhang Ao’s look to brighten and his eyes to heat up as he snickered and stared towards Yang Kai.

Obviously he had found a new goal; as long as he can capture both Yang Kai and An Ling’er, this mysterious inheritance would fall into the palm of his hand.

Many people among the crowd were now whispering to each other, the young men all staring enviously towards Yang Kai because they knew becoming the Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land was the same as reaching the Heavens in a single leap. No matter what he used to be, or how terrible his aptitude was, he would definitely stand among the clouds in the future, overlooking the entire world.

This envy gradually transformed into anger as the gazes they directed towards Yang Kai became filled with hatred, as if they thought it was only alright for such good fortune to fall upon them rather than this brat from who knows where take advantage of it.

A few kilometers back from the front lines of this gathering of forces, two young women were staring at Yang Kai fixedly, one of them filled with doubt and curiosity, the other actually breathing somewhat rapidly as a faint trace of excitement filled her chest.

“Hey, Yun Xuan, is it just me or does this new Holy Master of the Nine Heavens Holy Land look like a certain person we once knew?” Ruan Xin Yu of Bold Independent Union whispered to Yun Xuan subtly, “See, doesn’t he look quite similar?”

“He does resemble him, but that can’t be right?” Yun Xuan bit her lip gently, “Back then, he should have died...”

“Who saw him die?” Ruan Xin Yu frowned, “We only saw him being taken away.”

“But... if he didn’t die, why didn’t he contact me after all this time?” Yun Xuan couldn’t help feeling somewhat lost, in her mind the figure of a young man she greatly missed surfacing and slowly overlapping with this new Holy Master in front of her, the two images almost exactly the same.

Her heart clenched as she began to shiver, could it really be him?

With a few kilometers separating them, Yun Xuan couldn’t see this new Holy Master clearly, so she wasn’t completely sure.

Ruan Xin Yu on the other hand just coldly snorted and said, “That little brat is surely just a careless womanizer. After playing with you, he abandoned you without a second thought, why would he come back to find you?”

“Don’t talk so loudly!” Yun Xuan hurriedly hushed her, glancing over nervous at the two middle-aged men standing nearby, lowering her voice and whispering, “Don’t let my father hear you, he still doesn’t know...”

Ruan Xin Yu curled her lips, “I think that person is absolutely him. How can there be two people so similar under the sun? Unless it’s his twin! He didn’t care one bit about you, yet you still want to defend him?”

“I’m not trying to defend him...” Yun Xuan glanced over at Yang Kai again, but the more she stared at him, the harder it became for her to peel her eyes away.

Whether it was his figure, his sound, or his demeanor, everything matched perfectly with the images in her memory, causing her heart to suddenly fill with a complicated mix of hope, sorrow, joy, and grief.

“Do you at least dare to come with me and confirm whether or not it’s him?” Ruan Xin Yu immediately felt a sense of indignation for her friend and proposed, “If we get a closer look, you should be able to tell, right?”

“Now?”

“Of course now!” Saying so, Ruan Xin Yu couldn’t help grabbing hold of Yun Xuan’s arm and dragging her forward.

“Xuan’er...” Yun Cheng, the Union Master of Bold Independent Union, called out suddenly, “What are you going to do?”

“Union Master, we’re just going to get a closer look at the excitement. We’ll be back soon,” Ruan Xin Yu answered before quickly flying off.

Yun Cheng shook his head before glancing over at middle-aged man standing next to him and asking, “Ji Yan, you’ve been staring at that so called new Holy Master with a thoughtful expression for a while now, did you notice something?”

Hearing this, Ji Yan quickly replied, “Union Master, do you still remember the major incident I reported to you a few years ago?”

“Several years ago?”

“The year when my Raging Flame City was destroyed, it was also the year when Union Master and the Young Lady finally made amends,” Ji Yan said.

“You mean that matter, of course I remember,” Yun Cheng gently nodded. A city under Bold Independent Union’s control was destroyed, causing them to suffer heavy losses, it was only natural that Yun Cheng but what made Yun Cheng would recall such an event; the only silver lining of that tragedy was that the daughter who had stubbornly refused to talk to him had finally returned home afterwards.

Ji Yan was Raging Flame City’s City Lord at the time and had accompanied Yun Xuan back to Bold Independent City to report on this event.

“Why bring that up now?” Yun Cheng asked, quite confused.

Ji Yan stared at Yang Kai for a moment before drawing a deep breath and whispering, “Union Master, if I am not mistaken, that new Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land was the young man who was taken away by the Coffin Carrying Man.”

“What?” Yun Cheng’s expression changed greatly, “Are you certain?”

Ji Yan nodded firmly, “Absolutely. Because he came to Raging Flame City with the Young Lady, my impression of him is quite clear. I think the Young Lady should have also noticed something and thus decided to get closer to make sure.”

“Didn’t you say he died?” Yun Cheng suddenly realized the seriousness of the matter. This was related to the mysterious Coffin Carrying Man, if news of this spread out, it would likely shake the world. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The Coffin Carrying Man had existed for countless years, and everyone wanted to unravel the secrets surrounding him, but no one had ever succeeded as they no one had ever discovered his hiding place.

If this new Holy Master was really the one who was caught in the past, he must know more about the Coffin Carrying Man’s secrets than anyone else in history, even where he was currently hiding.

“We all thought he was dead, but now it seems he’s not only alive, he has also been blessed with a great opportunity and succeeded the position of Nine Heavens Holy Land Holy Master.”

Yun Cheng’s face twitched unconsciously, feeling somewhat bitter in his heart.

Because this new Holy Master was quite possibly once a disciple of his Bold Independent Union.

“However... how could his strength have increased so fast?” Ji Yan was dumbstruck, “When I last saw him, he was only an Immortal Ascension Boundary Eighth Stage junior, but now, only four or five years later, he’s already become a Second Order Transcendent, the same as me. How did he do it? Young Lady having a liking for him wasn’t without cause it seems.”
