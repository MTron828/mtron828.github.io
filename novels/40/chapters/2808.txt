The one month period was up, yet Yang Kai was still stuck here.

[This is impossible! Lan Xun mentioned that the opening of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda can only remain open for one month, and the entrance will close after that… At that time, the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda will produce an irresistible force to expel all the cultivators inside it…]

In other words, Yang Kai and the others would be returned to Star Soul Palace regardless of where they were once the time was up. Nevertheless, Yang Kai had not felt the rejection of this world at all, even though three days had passed since the deadline.

For the past three days, he had tried various methods inside the house but couldn’t find a way to leave this place. After thinking about it, he believed that either there was a problem with the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda or his departure had been intercepted by this Sealed World.

The Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda was a pivotal part of Star Soul Palace’s foundation, a legacy item passed down for tens of thousands of years, so if something were to go wrong, it would have gone wrong a long time ago. It was practically impossible for Yang Kai to encounter such a problem by chance. Therefore, the possibility of the latter hypothesis was high.

[Is there something special about this Sealed World? Why did it forcefully keep me here?] Fortunately, he gradually calmed down after ruminating over the problem for three days. [The Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda is the treasure of Star Soul Palace, so now that I am trapped inside it, Star Soul Palace will surely make some effort to get me out. If the Elders are powerless, then the Great Emperor will have to take action himself. In any case, worrying about my situation is meaningless, so I might as well search for my own way out while waiting for help to come from the outside world.]

Yang Kai cleaned up slightly before moving to meet Ah Hu and the others, after which they left the village. The canyon was located tens of kilometres away from the village. Previously, it took Yang Kai a full day of pursuit to arrive, but although he was in no rush this time, he couldn’t afford to delay either. After all, the Ancient Barbarian Race would have trouble walking once the snowstorm covered the mountains.

Under his leadership, the group consisting of a hundred villagers finally arrived in front of the canyon before evening rolled around. All of a sudden, though, Yang Kai stopped in his tracks and raised his hand up high. The hundred villagers following behind him stopped in unison, like a well-trained army, and instantly fell silent. Unfortunately, they were out of breath after spending such a long time on the road.

Ah Hu came over and asked quietly, “What’s the matter?”

“Someone’s here!” Yang Kai replied.

Ah Hu’s expression changed, “Are you sure?”

Every one of the Ancient Barbarian Race villagers here was an expert in surviving in the forest, so they had sharp instincts and a natural aptitude for tracking and stealth. These instincts were so finely honed that they were almost on par with those of wild beasts. Despite Ah Hu not sensing anything out of the ordinary in this place, since Yang Kai had spoken with such confidence, he didn’t dare to take those words lightly. There were no footprints left in the snow, but they might have been covered by the light snowfall today.

Yang Kai tilted his head to the side, signalling to a woman in the crowd. Ah Hua immediately equipped her bow and arrows from her back, swiftly moved towards the walls of the canyon, and soon disappeared.

The group stood in place for some time before Ah Hua returned, walking against the bitterly cold wind with a solemn expression, “It’s true; there are people inside. I saw bonfires inside the canyon; however, it’s too dark for me to tell how many people are there.”

Ah Hu angrily said, “Somebody from another tribe must have discovered the dead beasts here! Ahh! If only we arrived a few days earlier!”

The members of the Ancient Barbarian Race did not coexist peacefully with other tribes and clans. Rather, there were often skirmishes between them, especially when it came to food. The more than three hundred beasts Yang Kai killed were inside the canyon, which constituted a large amount of rations; enough to feed an entire village throughout winter.

“I hope they are from the South Barbarian Clan. Then, we can at least negotiate with them. Wait here; I’ll check out the situation.” Ah Hu said, preparing to walk into the canyon.

The Blue South Village belonged to the South Barbarian Clan, so if they were all part of the South Barbarian Clan, then they might be able to talk things out. In the worst case, they just had to share half of the food with the other party.

“Wait!” Yang Kai stopped Ah Hu, “You don’t need to trouble yourself with that.”

In response, Ah Hu glanced at him curiously.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai took a breath and lifted his hand slightly. An ancient and somewhat grating tone came from his mouth, and the meagre strength in his body began to fluctuate. In the next moment, the air in front of him rippled suddenly, looking like ripples formed when a stone fell into a calm lake. As the ripples spread, a translucent image appeared in front of everyone. From the looks of it, the image was a direct mirror opposite of the entrance to the canyon. Under Yang Kai’s control, the image continued to move inward.

“It’s the Eagle Eye Spell!” Ah Hu’s eyes lit up. [This is the Village Chief’s Eagle Eye Spell!] This unusual Shamanic Spell allowed the caster to obtain an eagle-like vision and was great for scouting. [Didn’t Ah Niu just become a Shaman several days ago? I can’t believe he managed to learn such a sophisticated Shamanic Spell in such a short time. No wonder the Village Chief named Ah Niu as his successor and claimed that the future of the village will depend on him.]

Similarly, every one of the villagers standing behind Yang Kai was emotional for some reason, and their eyes were filled with admiration.

In the meantime, the Eagle Eye Spell continued to advance into the canyon silently.

Everywhere it went and everything it passed were clearly shown in the image. It wasn’t until Yang Kai directed the Eagle Eye Spell into the canyon that the lights from dozens of bonfires were transmitted to them. Seven or eight strong Ancient Barbarian men gathered around each bonfire while slabs of golden-brown beast meat were being roasted atop the bonfires and plenty of laughter and cheers could be heard.

Ah Hu and the rest of the villagers saw this and immediately became red-eyed at that sight. All that beast meat belonged to their Blue South Village! How dare this group of people come out of nowhere and claim it for their own?! The crime of stealing our food is absolutely irreconcilable!

Then, Ah Hua’s expression changed slightly as she whispered, “They are from the Raging Flame Clan!”

She had noticed the patterns tattooed on the faces of those Ancient Barbarian Race men.

“I can’t believe it’s the Raging Flame Clan!” Ah Hu’s expression became a little ugly too, “Why are those savages here?”

Yang Kai shot a look at Ah Hu while thinking, [In my eyes, you are no different from them. Don’t you feel ashamed to claim that they are savages?]

At that moment, a burly figure stood up suddenly from where he sat next to a bonfire. His sharp pair of eyes danced like flames as he looked directly at the Eagle Eye Spell and into the eyes of everyone in the Blue South Village. It felt as though this man was staring right at them, and it made them feel extremely uncomfortable.

“Hmph!” The burly man suddenly snorted coldly as he lifted the cane-like object in his hands and pointed at the air in front of him. In the next moment, the Eagle Eye Spell broke and the air in front of Yang Kai burst into flames.

“Huh… I was discovered…” Yang Kai frowned.

“That must have been their Shaman!” Ah Hu looked pale.

It was bad enough to meet the Raging Flame Clan in the wilderness, but to think that a powerful Shaman would be travelling together with them! This was incredibly bad news for the villagers. The Raging Flame Clan’s brutality and combativeness ranked among the top three among all the Ancient Barbarian Clans. They were second only to the Bone Devouring Clan and the Flowing Blood Clan.

“Let’s withdraw quickly, Ah Niu,” Ah Hu hurriedly said.

Although the villagers of the Blue South Village had excellent fighting power, Ah Hu and others did not have much confidence in fighting the people of the Raging Flame Clan. Moreover, they had been on the road for an entire day while the people of the Raging Flame Clan had been resting leisurely. There was a great difference between their current physical conditions.

Most importantly, Ah Niu was travelling with their group at the moment. As the hope of the village, nothing was allowed to happen to him; they could not tolerate any mistakes. Therefore, the smartest thing to do right now was to retreat. What did it matter if they had to give up some food so long as they could protect Ah Niu?

“It’s too late.” Yang Kai shrugged, lifting his eyes to look in the direction of the canyon. The group of villagers followed his gaze, and their hearts sank instantly.

More than a dozen figures holding bows in their hands had appeared on the cliffs on both sides of the canyon. Furthermore, their arrows were nocked and aimed at Yang Kai and the others.

Fortunately, the other party did not shoot immediately, seemingly wanting the villagers of the Blue South Village to retreat in the face of difficulty. Although the Raging Flame Clan had a love for battle, they were not as brutal and cruel as the Bone Devouring Clan.

If Yang Kai and the others had encountered the Bone Devouring Clan instead, those arrows would have rained down on them by now; after all, that clan even considered other Ancient Barbarian Clans as food! It was an outlier among the rest of the Ancient Barbarian Race, and if not for the powerful Shaman Saint protecting it, the rest of the Ancient Barbarian Race would have worked together to eliminate them by now.

Ah Hua and the other archers reacted very quickly. Noticing that they were being targeted from a distance, they immediately dispersed and readied their bows to counterattack at any time. Unfortunately, there was a huge gap between the number of people and their position. If a fight really broke out, Blue South Village would undoubtedly suffer heavy casualties.

“The other party is so… welcoming. En, let’s go and meet them!” Yang Kai grinned, suddenly lifting a finger and condensing a white light at his fingertips.

“It’s a Shaman!” Somebody exclaimed in surprise from the cliffs on the sides of the canyon.

In ancient times, the number of Shamans was very low, so any Shaman was a valuable asset to the Ancient Barbarian Race as a whole. Hence, the Spirit Archers of the Raging Flame Clan frowned when they saw Yang Kai displaying his Shaman powers. It was no big deal if several ordinary villagers were killed in a dispute, as countless clansmen died due to internal fighting among the Ancient Barbarian Race every year. However, the situation was different if a Shaman were to die at their hands. Such an act might enrage the Shaman Kings and Shaman Saints! Only a Shaman could kill another Shaman.

“I want to meet your leader!” Yang Kai shouted loudly, his voice echoing around the entrance of the canyon.

The people of the Raging Flame Clan did not dare to ignore a direct request from a Shaman. Thus, someone immediately rushed down the cliff and entered the canyon, seemingly to ask for instructions.

The archers on both sides of the cliff soon withdrew, one after another. Then, a tall figure walked out from the entrance of the canyon. Although he came out alone, he fearlessly approached Yang Kai and the others directly. At the same time, a sharp aura washed over them.

Ah Hu snorted coldly and stood beside Yang Kai, glaring fiercely at the Raging Flame Warrior. It felt as if two kings were present, and neither of them were willing to back down.

In response, Yang Kai stretched out his hand and patted Ah Hu on the shoulder, motioning for Ah Hu to stay calm. Then, he smiled at the other Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior and spoke, “Nice to meet you, friend from the Raging Flame Clan. I would like to meet your leader.”

Only then did the Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior shift his gaze away from Ah Hu. He lowered his head and glanced at Yang Kai, who was standing in front of him, a moment later exclaiming in surprise, “Are you their Shaman?”

“Yes!”

The Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior frowned, “Why are you so weak…”
