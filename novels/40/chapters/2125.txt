“From the information that you provided, the two Dao Source Realm kids have indeed brought the Bustling World Token. No doubt, the appearance of the Bustling World Token can be imitated by anyone, but the power in it... cannot be infused by any commoner,” Wen Zi Shan smiled and said. “Then again, who would want to imitate this kind of token...”

“How on Earth could these two possess the Bustling World Great Emperor’s Bustling World Token!?” Qiu Ran frowned.

Wen Zi Shan shrugged his shoulders and said, “Regarding that Sir’s behaviour... heh, it is unpredictable. So, it’s not surprising that both of them have the Bustling World Token. Who knows, one day, there might be a lot of beggars or prostitutes coming to Azure Sun Temple with Bustling World Tokens too!”

The crowd showed an indifferent look.

“You all have to believe me!” Wen Zi Shan said, “Back then, when this King established Azure Sun Temple in the early days, a group of prostitutes came to this King with a Bustling World Token and begged for money! Well, at that time, only Little Xue Ting was with me, while the rest of you were not here yet. That’s why you have no idea about it.”

“Who would have thought of such a thing!?” The crowd was shocked.

Qiu Ran was speechless and muttered, “How could the Bustling World Token fall into the hands of women like that?”

“How tricky!”

“How unpredictable!”

“Bustling World Great Emperor lives up to his name!”

Meanwhile, the young girl Chen Qian, who previously performed Soul Secret Technique against Deacon Tao, quietly hovered in mid-air. She broke her silence in a soft tone: “Back to our topic, why do I feel like the style of Sir Temple Master is kind of similar to the Great Emperor?”

Everyone pondered over her words. The more they thought about it, the more they agreed with it.

“Sir Temple Master has been chattering nonsense all day too!”

“And he also wears tasteless clothes!”

“Badly behaved too!”

“This King is here, and you criticized him in front of his face? Am I... deaf to you?” Wen Zi Shan said with a stern face.

Qiu Ran took a glance at him, cupped his fists, said, “Sir Temple Master, I heard that Sir Temple Master was adopted by the Bustling World Great Emperor during younger days, is it true?”

“Absolutely not!”

“I also heard that Bustling World Great Emperor had taught and instructed Sir...”

“By no stretch of the imagination!”

“What?” They were shocked, “Really? There was such a story between Sir Temple Master and Bustling World Great Emperor?”

“So, that’s how it is!”

“Now I understand why.”

Wen Zi Shan looked down at the people and spoke weakly, “What do you understand? Are you saying that this King being who he is now is because of that old thing? Nonsense! This King has no relationship with that old thing at all, needless to say about the rest.”

“Then why does the Bustling World Token appear in our Azure Sun Temple so often?” Qiu Ran questioned, “Including this time, it has already appeared twice in Azure Sun Temple.”

“I have never heard of any other great force receiving a Bustling World Token before!”

“Well, this King wants to know why they came to our Azure Sun Temple with a Bustling World Token. Send both of them in.” Wen Zi Shan turned serious at once.

Qiu Ran sighed deeply, realizing that his Sir Temple Master resembled the Bustling World Great Emperor even more.

But he was unambiguous. He waved his hand to open the temple gate and passed down the message.

Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang looked at each other outside the temple, both with a solemn look, and entered the temple together.

After they had set foot in the temple, the temple gate closed again.

The Emperor Realms were inside the temple. These people did not deliberately release their power, but their omnipresent pressure was not something that the two First-Order Dao Source Realms could resist. Yang Kai was slightly better, though he struggled to move, but at least he did not make a fool of himself.

However, Qin Zhao Yang was trembling. His clothes were soaked in his sweat. His wet feet were even leaving clear footprints all around the temple.

When the two approached, they cupped their fist and saluted around.

The rest just looked at them quietly. Wen Zi Shan waved his hand, emitting a formless wave of power that put Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang at ease.

“Many thanks to Temple Master Wen!” Yang Kai rushed to the altar and cupped his fists. It was obvious that the one seated on the throne and donning a symbolic purple shirt was none other than Azure Sun Temple’s Temple Master.

“After being verified by this Temple Master, the token that has been brought by you two is real!” Wen Zi Shan looked down at them with a stern voice. “Let this King ask you, what are you up to for bringing this token to our Azure Sun Temple?”

Yang Kai took a glance at Qin Zhao Yang, but realized he was a coward who dared not to open his mouth.

He had no choice but to answer, “In reply to Temple Master Wen, we came from Maplewood City. Twelve years ago, a Senior Expert who always comes and goes like a shadow, gave this token to Older Brother Qin, and instructed him to visit Azure Sun Temple twelve years later, in order to request Temple Master Wen to grant him a place in Four Seasons Realm!”

“Hmmm? Four Seasons Realm?” Wen Zi Shan was a little surprised, while the rest had an odd expression.

Everyone thought that they would probably ask for some special favour for bringing the Bustling World Token to Azure Sun Temple, but who could have guessed that they were just asking for a place in Four Seasons Realm?

Wen Zi Shan scanned through Qin Zhao Yang with his Divine Sense, said lightly, “This old man doesn’t seem like a talented person. Why would that old... that Sir allow him to enter Four Seasons Realm? Although Four Seasons Realm is not really some glorious Sealed World, entry is still limited, and only the elites from the various huge Sects and clans can enter. Give us a reason, why must this King fulfil your wish?”

Qin Zhao Yang took a deep breath, quickly said: “In reply to Sir, it’s for a grandchild of this old man! She suffers from severe illness since birth, and only one type of spirit fruit in Four Season Realm will be able to save her! Back then, that Sir saw this, and that’s why this Qin was given a token and was instructed to visit Azure Sun Temple twelve years later!”

“I see!” Wen Zi Shan nodded without further questions, “Since these words were given by that Sir, this Temple Master cannot reject. It is just a slot in Four Seasons Realm after all...”

After hearing this, Qin Zhao Yang was delighted.

He expected this trip to be painful at first. He was not sure if Azure Sun Temple would recognize and respect the token master. Even if they did, granting him a place in Four Seasons Realm might still be another story.

Throughout this trip, Qin Zhao Yang had been worried.

But everything went smoother than he expected. The thing that he longed after seemed to be within his reach! He was filled with lots of joy and surprise.

“However...” Wen Zi Shan changed the conversation, “This matter has always been taken care of by an Elder...”

He turned aside and said, “Little Xue Ting...”

As soon as the voice reached her ears, Gao Xue Ting glared at him.

“Ahem... Elder Gao!” Wen Zi Shan quickly corrected.

“Subordinate’s here!” Gao Xue Ting stepped forward and answered with a solemn look.

“You have heard what I just said, can you take care of this?” asked Wen Zi Shan.

Hearing this, Gao Xue Ting could not help but reveal a bitter look on her face.

“What’s the problem?” Wen Zi Shan found her expression strange.

Qin Zhao Yang started to get nervous.

Gao Xue Ting took a glance at Qin Zhao Yang, said, “Four Seasons Realm will be opened soon. The list of names allowed to enter has been set long ago, and those disciples have been informed as well. Some of them would not be satisfied if we revoked their slot!”

“It’s true...” Wen Zi Shan pondered, and muttered, “Getting into the Four Seasons Realm has always been their dream. It’s unfair if we randomly disqualified one of them, but on the other hand, that Sir’s will cannot be rejected either... Argh, this decision is hard to make!”

Gao Xue Ting said, “Actually, Subordinate has an idea!”

“Oh? Let’s hear it!” Wen Zi Shan’s eyes lit up.

Gao Xue Ting proposed, “This old man has just mentioned that he wanted to enter the Four Seasons Realm to obtain a type of spirit fruit in order to cure his grandchild’s disease. Here’s my question to this old man, what kind of spirit fruit in the Four Seasons Realm are you looking for? Do you mind telling us? If this is available in our Azure Sun Temple, there is no need for you to get into Four Seasons Realm, and risk your life. Forgive me for my honesty, but with your power...” She paused, and tried to think of a polite wording, but to no avail, “You might not come out alive!”

When Qin Zhao Yang heard this, he agreed, and immediately responded, “ Elder Gao, this old man would like to ask for a Tribulation Fruit!”

“Tribulation Fruit!” Qiu Ran frowned.

Gao Xue Ting’s face turned bitter again. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Wen Zi Shan set his sight on the young girl named Chen Qian, asked, “Elder Chen, since you have been in charge of our temple storehouse, do we have Tribulation Fruit in our vault?”

Chen Qian answered: “Allow subordinate to check it out!”

“How long will you take?”

“A quarter of an hour!”

Wen Zi Shan nodded and rested with his eyes closed.

Chen Qian took out a communication artifact and transmitted her Divine Sense into it. Apparently, this was her way of sending orders to the disciple below.

For a while, there was just dead silence in the temple.

Only the sound of Qin Zhao Yang’s racing heart could be heard while waiting for the result with extreme trepidation.

Yang Kai remained silent in his spot, but all of a sudden, he sensed something and turned aside to see what was happening.

Gao Xue Ting was watching him. She did not avoid eye contact when their eyes met but looked even more intently at him instead.

This gave Yang Kai a heart attack, feeling that nothing good would happen.

Most of those in the temple were Emperor Realms, so this scene instantly attracted the attention of others. The crowd started to look at Yang Kai with curiosity because they had no idea which part of him could grab Gao Xue Ting’s attention.

Even Wen Zi Shan peeked from his closed eyes and enjoyed watching all of this under his eyes.

“Elder Gao, what can I do for you?” Yang Kai felt uneasy for being stared at, especially by an Emperor Realm. It made him feel anxious, so he decided to break the silence to avoid embarrassment.

“Have I seen you somewhere before?” Gao Xue Ting asked, “I thought you looked familiar!”

“HAHAHAHA!”

Wen Zi Shan interjected with laughter before Yang Kai could answer her.

Gao Xue Ting frowned and gave him an offended look.
