The Old Ancestor asked again, “Then whose nest bred the Royal Lord Black Ink Nests?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “I don’t know either. According to the Black Ink Clan, a Royal Lord Black Ink Nest is the highest-grade Black Ink Nest.”

The Old Ancestor remained silent for a long time before finally adding, “There must be a source. If we can find this source, perhaps we can eliminate the Black Ink Clan once and for all.”

Yang Kai asked worriedly, “If that’s the case, doesn’t it mean there’s an even stronger Black Ink Clansman, stronger than even the Royal Lords?” Since that source could give birth to a High-Rank Black Ink Nest owned by a Royal Lord, it would naturally be guarded by an even stronger Black Ink Clansman. That was quite a terrifying prospect.

The Royal Lords were already on par with the Old Ancestors. If there really was someone even stronger, what kind of strength could they display?

“Perhaps.” The Old Ancestor couldn’t explain it either, “Right now, our understanding of the Black Ink Clan is still too limited.”

While speaking, she turned her head to look and saw that the three Territory Lords were still hot on their tails. More importantly, instead of opening up a gap, the distance between them had actually gotten shorter. A trace of murderous intent flashed across the Old Ancestor’s eyes as she muttered, “These three stalkers are a bit troublesome. I’m afraid we won’t be able to escape unless we take care of them. Do you have any good ideas?”

Yang Kai decisively shook his head, “I’m unable to take on a Territory Lord, but if it’s just escaping, it shouldn’t be a problem. That’s my forte.”

The Old Ancestor glanced at him before realization dawned upon her, “Right, you’re proficient in the Dao of Space, I forgot about that. But I want to kill them!”

Yang Kai promised upon hearing this, “I’ll help out however I can!”

The Old Ancestor nodded her acknowledgement as she stated, “We’ll act according to the situation, don’t force it!”

“Yes!” Yang Kai replied firmly.

Right then, they spotted an average-sized universe fragment floating up ahead. Who knows how long it had been drifting through the void? In the cover of the universe fragment, the Old Ancestor turned around and landed straight on the universe fragment. The next moment, she thrust her longsword out repeatedly while forming a set of hand seals with her free hand.

Yang Kai couldn’t understand what she was doing, but he knew that the Old Ancestor was probably setting up some kind of Array or trap.

She was done in the blink of an eye. Afterwards, the Old Ancestor bit her fingertip before flicking a drop of gemstone-like Blood Essence into the void. Immediately after doing this, she quickly concealed her aura.

Yang Kai understood the gist of what she was planning and hurriedly concealed his aura as well. Of course, since his cultivation was lacking compared to the Old Ancestor’s his concealment wasn’t as effective. Although the Old Ancestor was standing in front of him right now, if one didn’t use their naked eyes to observe her, they wouldn’t be able to perceive her at all. This showed just how exquisite her Concealing Technique was. Of course, this also had to do with her fantastic strength.

Just as she was finished, the three pursuing Territory Lords flew across the universe fragment.

They failed to spot the Old Ancestor ahead; however, they seemed to have noticed the universe fragment from the corner of their eyes and felt that there was something strange about it.

Mie Qiong, who was leading the group, turned his head. The next moment, he saw the Old Ancestor dressed in white standing alone on the universe fragment with her sword pointed at them with a solemn expression on her face.

Mie Qiong’s hair stood on end. He might not have any idea as to what the Old Ancestor was planning, but judging by her posture, he could tell that it was not anything good for them.

At the same time, Qing Lei and the other Territory Lord whom Yang Kai didn’t recognize also noticed this peculiarity.

The three Territory Lords had never imagined that the Human Race’s Old Ancestor, who they had been chasing all this time, would actually stop here and ambush them.

They had thought that the Old Ancestor was too seriously injured and unable to contend with the three of them, which was why they had chased after her so aggressively. All along the way, the three Territory Lords had been fantasizing about killing an Old Ancestor; after all, the death of such a powerhouse was a rare opportunity. They would have made an enormous contribution to the war if they really did kill her.

It wasn’t until this moment that the three Territory Lords realised that things were different from what they had imagined. The Human Old Ancestor wasn’t completely powerless.

Before they could react, a torrential World Force erupted from the Old Ancestor as she swung her sword.

The universe fragment exploded and was reduced to dust as a giant Yin-Yang Fish pattern appeared in the void, enveloping the three Territory Lords.

The Yin-Yang Fish was filled with endless murderous intent and, as it rotated, it seemed to transform into a giant millstone that crushed everything in its range. The three Territory Lords who were enveloped by it immediately began to bleed profusely as they howled in pain and anguish.

Immediately after, a surge of Black Ink Strength erupted from the Territory Lords. Naturally, they wouldn’t just sit back and wait for death. Each of them released a powerful burst of energy in an attempt to break free.

While they were struggling though, the Old Ancestor arrived before the three Territory Lords with her sword in hand.

No one saw when she had attacked, not even Yang Kai who was standing right next to her.

It wasn’t until a cold light flashed in front of the Territory Lord Yang Kai didn’t recognize and his giant head flew up into the void that Yang Kai came to his senses.

The Old Ancestor had decapitated a Territory Lord with one swing of her blade.

The Old Ancestor had already made her move, so how could Yang Kai stand idly by? His figure instantly teleported in front of Mie Qiong and attacked.

At this moment, Mie Qiong was preoccupied with resisting the grinding force of the Yin-Yang Fish and his entire body was covered in blood as his aura had greatly weakened in this short span.

When Yang Kai attacked Mei Qiong with his spear, the latter was unable to react and was stabbed through the chest by the Azure Dragon Spear. Although this injury was not light, it wasn’t enough to take his life.

On the other hand, the Old Ancestor swung her sword towards Qing Lei, after killing the first Territory Lord.

Qing Lei wasn’t weak though and managed to dodge the oncoming attack, preserving his life. Be that as it may, the sword light cut off one of his arms as a fountain of black blood spurted from his wound, causing him to stagger back, howling in pain.

But his howl was abruptly cut off as the Old Ancestor slashed again. This time, Qing Lei was unable to dodge and his huge body was split in two.

At the same time Qing Lei was killed, Yang Kai was also sent flying by Mie Qiong’s fist, breaking many of his bones.

Yang Kai somehow managed to stabilize himself and grit his teeth as he madly mobilized Space Principles, wrapping himself in spear light as he shot towards his enemy.

Mie Qiong let out a furious roar and ruthlessly thrust out palm. As the palm and spear clashed, Yang Kai felt as if he was struck by lightning and he could see stars circling around his eyes.

Right then, a look of horror flashed across Mie Qiong’s eyes. Yang Kai also spotted the Old Ancestor silently appearing behind Mie Qiong like a ghost. Immediately after, she swung her sword, sending a shocking sword wave down at Mei Qiong.

When the brilliant sword wave disappeared, the frozen Mie Qiong fell to pieces, literally, and scattered in all directions.

Yang Kai stared ahead in a daze, his face covered in blood and filth.

Dead!

Three Territory Lords had died in less than 10 breaths. He might have participated in the battle, but his contribution was minuscule. He had only been able to restrain Mie Qiong for a moment and had even been struck hard by the latter’s counterattack.

It wasn’t wrong to say that these three Territory Lords had all died at the hands of the Old Ancestor.

The fearsome Territory Lords, against whom Yang Kai was completely helpless, were like common chickens in front of the Old Ancestor, unable to fight back or even resist, easily killed in an instant.

Yang Kai got to witness the true strength of an Old Ancestor up close today.

Be that as it may, he was greatly puzzled by the current situation before him and immediately turned to the Old Ancestor.

The Old Ancestor put away her longsword and turned to him, worriedly asking after seeing his state, “How are your injuries?”

Yang Kai lightly coughed before replying, shaking his head, “It’s nothing serious, I can recover after a few days of rest, but Old Ancestor… I don’t understand something.”

The Old Ancestor indifferently asked, “You want to know why I let them chase me since I could have killed them at any point I wished?”

Yang Kai nodded his affirmation.

The Old Ancestor replied, “Because I only had this much strength left. If I killed them before, I wouldn’t have been able to return, but since I met you, I’ll be relying on you to take me back.”

An earnest and serious expression took over Yang Kai’s face, “I will not fail in the duty I have been entrusted with.”

The Old Ancestor suddenly clucked her tongue, “Damn it, I’m about to revert back into a child again.”

Yang Kai was confused, “Huh?”

The moment he was finished speaking, the Old Ancestor suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood as her aura rapidly weakened like a deflating balloon.

Only then did Yang Kai suddenly come to his senses. The Old Ancestor was wounded, and her injuries were not light either.

Furthermore, the Old Ancestor began to shrink with the weakening of her aura.

Originally, the Old Ancestor looked like a young woman in her early twenties, but under Yang Kai’s dumbfounded gaze, this young woman seemed to regress into a seven or eight-year-old kid in less than 20 breaths.

Her white clothes also shrank along with her figure, sticking close to her body. Obviously, this was not an ordinary piece of clothing, but a specially refined artifact.

Yang Kai’s eyes almost popped out, looking at the little girl the Old Ancestor had transformed into, “You…”

He was not just shocked by the Old Ancestor’s transformation, but also by her little girl persona.

It was the same little girl who had been pestering him in Yin-Yang Pass’ Marketplace! It was this little girl who had given him that ancient coin.

When he first met the Old Ancestor, Yang Kai found her a bit familiar, but he couldn’t remember where he had seen her before.

Now he finally understood that the Old Ancestor’s appearance was somewhat similar to that little girl’s. He had never imagined that the Old Ancestor herself was that little girl.

Suddenly, everything that Yang Kai had encountered back then which he failed to understand made sense to him.

Previously, he had been wondering why the Old Ancestor of Yin-Yang Pass hadn’t summoned him or given him any instructions before sending him on such an important mission to infiltrate the depths of the Black Ink Clan’s territory and find the Black Ink Disciple Artifact Refiners.

It wasn’t that the Old Ancestor hadn’t summoned him, but rather that she had been at his side the whole time!

The ancient coin’s origins also made sense now. How could a little girl who wasn’t even in the Open Heaven Realm steal such a precious thing from the Old Ancestor? At the time, Yang Kai had assumed the Old Ancestor had given it to her, but now it seemed that was not the case.

At this moment, Yang Kai couldn’t sense any trace of cultivation from this little girl. She was like an ordinary mortal who had never cultivated before. If Yang Kai hadn’t witnessed her transformation with his own eyes, he wouldn’t have believed that this person in front of him was actually the Yin-Yang Pass Old Ancestor!

[What the hell?] Yang Kai was more than a little confused.

“Don’t just stand there gawking, hurry up and run! Who knows when more Black Ink Clansmen might arrive to investigate.” The Old Ancestor’s face was pale and a bit of blood was trickling from the corner of her lips. Her bright eyes had gone grey and lost their shine and she looked extremely tired with her eyelids already starting to droop.
