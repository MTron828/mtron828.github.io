“Will an Emperor Grade Mid-Rank Artifact Armor satisfy Brother Yang’s needs?” Kang Si Ran smiled.

“Emperor Grade Mid-Rank!” Yang Kai’s expression lifted, “There’s an Emperor Grade Mid-Rank Artifact Armor for sale in the auction?”

Kang Si Ran nodded, “That’s right. The finale of the auction tomorrow is going to be this Emperor Grade Mid-Rank Artifact Armor!”

“Truly!” Yang Kai was pleasantly surprised. This time, he had primarily come to Violet Source Chamber of Commerce in order to buy Space Spirit Crystals and Space Spirit Jade, so that he could make preparations for arranging Space Arrays in the future, but his second reason was to find an appropriate Artifact Armor.

Yang Kai’s requirements were not that high, but he was still an Emperor after all. He was only thinking of looking for an Emperor Grade Artifact Armor, but he didn’t think an Emperor Grade Mid-Rank one would be available, which was much better than what he expected.

He didn’t want to end up with shredded clothes, or even winding up naked when he used his Dragon Transformation Secret Technique in the future.

“Is a private transaction possible?” Yang Kai asked.

Most of the items sold in an auction were brought in for sale by cultivators, but many were also found by the auction house itself. No matter which type it was, with the current long term cooperation that Yang Kai established with Violet Source Chamber of Commerce, he should be eligible to make a private transaction.

Kang Si Ran answered with regret, “Not this time, I’m afraid. It may be fine if it were any other item in the auction, but this Emperor Grade Mid-Rank Artifact Armor is the highlight of the auction, and it was advertised three months ago. There is no way President Luo would agree to sell it to you privately.”

“Is that so…” Yang Kai wasn’t too disappointed. Since it was already announced to be the finale of the auction, they definitely couldn’t sell it off privately, the reason being that it would be a huge blow to Violet Source Chamber of Commerce’s credibility, “No matter, I will just bid for it when the time comes.”

Kang Si Ran told him, “Please wait here for a moment, Brother Yang. I’ll go and prepare an invitation for you!”

With that said, he headed outside.

After a short wait, Kang Si Ran returned with a gold-stamped invitation, handing it to Yang Kai, “The auction will start at seven tomorrow evening. You should come early, Brother Yang. You may be able to find something you like at the auction.”

“Good,” Yang Kai accepted the invitation and stuffed it into his Space Ring.

An incense stick of time later, Yang Kai stepped out from the private room, leaving the Violet Source Chamber of Commerce branch.

Only after taking a casual stroll around Maplewood City, purchasing some supplies, and spending away Source Crystals like water, did Yang Kai return to the Qin Family.

The Qin Family was currently extremely busy as everyone was packing up their things. Even though they were a small family, they had lived and thrived in these lands for a few thousand years already. The Qin Family members were a little reluctant to leave this place so suddenly.

But under Qin Zhao Yang’s orders, they could only obey despite their reluctance, bringing away whatever they could.

Yang Kai went around the Qin Family, but he didn’t see Qin Zhao Yang at all.

On the other hand, Qin Yu had already exited her retreat, and when she saw Yang Kai, she walked over to him with a beaming smile, “Big Brother Yang!”

Yang Kai smiled and nodded, “It’s been a few years since we last saw each other. Your cultivation has improved a lot.”

He had discovered last time that Qin Yu was already a Second-Order Dao Source Realm. Her cultivation speed was extremely fast. It may have something to do with her World Tribulation Body. For a cultivator with this sort of aptitude, she would definitely be able to grow strong as long as she was given enough time and resources.

“It’s all thanks to Big Brother Yang.” With her hands clasped together, Qin Yu stood in front of Yang Kai, speaking gratefully, “Without Big Brother Yang, I would have died at eighteen. Big Brother Yang is my life’s saviour.”

“This is just your destiny. There’s no need to thank me.” Yang Kai smiled, “Where’s your grandfather?”

Qin Yu brushed her hair behind her ear as she answered, “Since we’re leaving soon, Grandpa is thinking of selling the deed for the Qin Family Residence. He should be on his way to the City Lord’s Mansion.” After a pause, she asked, “Big Brother Yang, are we really going to the Northern Territory?”

“That’s right.”

“I heard it’s perpetually cold in the Northern Territory, and that wind and snow cover the sky every day.”

Yang Kai smiled, “The rumours are greatly exaggerated. Though there are indeed places in the Northern Territory that are covered in snow and ice year-round, there are still many places that are beautiful and refreshing like a spring day. The place I will be bringing you all to is the latter kind. Once you’re there, you and the Qin Family will be able to develop better.”

Qin Yu’s beautiful eyes lit up and she couldn’t help but reveal a look of anticipation.

“You should go back to what you were doing. I’m going to rest for a while.” After saying that, Yang Kai headed towards the back hall.

Looking at his back, Qin Yu’s mouth opened, but ultimately, she just sighed.

Time passed quickly, and it wasn’t until dusk the next day that Yang Kai left his room.

Qin Yu was walking back and forth in front of his door, seeming preoccupied with something, but when she heard the noise, she looked over. Seeing Yang Kai, she quickly said, “Big Brother Yang, everyone is prepared!”

Qin Zhao Yang also came over from the distance and said solemnly, “Brother Yang, the Qin Family is ready. When are we leaving?”

Yang Kai said, “Leave at midnight and wait five hundred kilometres southeast of the city for another group of people who will be joining us!”

“Who?” Qin Zhao Yang was stunned.

“The Zhang Family,” Yang Kai replied.

Qin Zhao Yang nodded, “So, it is them.”

The Zhang Family seemed to have a good relationship with Yang Kai, a fact that Qin Zhao Yang knew about. When Yang Kai left back then, the Qin Family also took care of the Zhang Family for a time. Unfortunately, as time went on, the Qin Family found itself unable to even take care of themselves, so they naturally lost the ability to take care of others. Now, when he heard that the Zhang Family was leaving with them, Qin Zhao Yang couldn’t help but feel like they were brothers in adversity.

“Big Brother Yang, where are you going?” Qin Yu suddenly asked.

“To Violet Source Chamber of Commerce’s auction. There’s something that I wish to buy,” Yang Kai responded before he kicked the ground and flew off, only to suddenly reappear several tens of meters away as he turned back to Qin Yu, “Do you want to come along?”

Qin Yu’s look of anticipation turned into one of joy as her tender body flickered and she quickly caught up with him.

“Let’s go!” Yang Kai called out, using his Emperor Qi to wrap up Qin Yu before disappearing in a stream of light above the Qin Family.

The entrance to Violet Source Chamber of Commerce’s auction house was decorated with colourful lanterns and a big red carpet was rolled out on the ground as a bustling crowd gathered around.

Kang Si Ran and Gu Hong, the two Managers, were standing on either side of the entrance, welcoming guests with smiles on their faces, cupping their fists and exchanging pleasantries with them.

“Sect Master Le, I trust you’ve been well since we last met!”

An elderly man proudly walked over, and Gu Hong immediately went up to greet him.

Le Dong Zheng smiled and returned the greeting, “Manager Gu is too courteous. I heard many good things will be showing up in this auction, so I came to join in on the fun.”

Gu Hong said, “Sect Master Le jests. If you really decided to join in on the fun, then I’m afraid no one else will be able to buy anything.”

Le Dong Zheng chuckled before nodding, “This Old Master won’t hold you up, I’ll make myself comfortable.”

“Please forgive me for the lack of hospitality, Sect Master Le.” Gu Hong smiled and made a gesture with his hand. Immediately, a beautiful maidservant came over and led Le Dong Zheng towards the auction hall.

Whenever those with status and position arrived, there would be maidservants to lead the way for them, to show that they were different from the common folk.

“Brother Yang,” Kang Si Ran on the other side also cupped his fists to Yang Kai. Looking over, he glanced at Qin Yu and smiled, “Young Lady Qin is also here!”

Qin Yu naturally recognized him; after all, Kang Si Ran had been based in Maplewood City for half his lifetime.

Qin Yu smiled back, “Manager Kang!”

“No need to bother with me. I can just go in by myself.”

As soon as he finished that, Yang Kai suddenly felt a hateful gaze ahead of him. Looking over, Yang Kai saw that Le Dong Zheng was currently glaring coldly at him, his eyes extremely dark, as if Yang Kai had killed his father and taken his wife.

Yang Kai smiled back happily, not giving it a second thought.

Le Dong Zheng coldly snorted and turned away.

Even though their encounter was short, Kang Si Ran and Gu Hong saw the scene bright and clear. Eyes flickering, no one knew what thoughts came to Gu Hong’s mind, but he snickered quietly to himself.

Kang Si Ran on the other hand was worried and he quietly whispered, “Brother Yang, do you have some sort of grudge with Sect Master Le?”

“It’s just a little something,” Yang Kai touched his nose. He had killed three of his Third-Order Dao Source Realm Disciples, so this was by no means just a small grudge.

Kang Si Ran urged, “Then you should watch out around him. Le Dong Zheng is the Sect Master of Broken Mountain Sect and reached the Emperor Realm over a hundred years ago. There are even rumours that he is about to break through to the Second-Order Emperor Realm, so he shouldn’t be underestimated.”

Yang Kai cast him a reassuring smile, “No matter. I’ll be going in first.”

Kang Si Ran nodded and gestured to the maidservants behind him. Immediately, one of them came over, took the invitation from Yang Kai’s hand, and led him into the auction hall.

After walking through a bright and spacious corridor, they soon came to a private room.

When the door was opened, a spacious room appeared in front of Yang Kai. This room was decorated with utmost luxury, and at least twenty people could be accommodated without it feeling crowded. There was a huge transparent crystal window at the front of the room through which everything in the auction hall could be seen at a glance.

Only esteemed guests had the right to use one of these private rooms, and the maidservant clearly knew this, so her attitude was extremely humble and respectful.

“Sir, if there’s anything you need, just ask this maidservant.” The maidservant introduced some rules of the auction to Yang Kai before saying in a warm voice.

“There’s nothing we need. You can go out now. It’s enough with me here,” Qin Yu suddenly spoke up, driving out the maidservant like a fly.

The maidservant’s smile did not diminish, a sign of her good training, as she bowed politely, “Then this maidservant will go out first. This maidservant will be waiting outside the door.”

After saying that, she retreated and gently closed the door of the room behind her.

Qin Yu glanced at Yang Kai and found him looking at her with a light smile. Seeing this, she couldn’t help but blush and began evading his gaze.

“Let’s have a seat,” Yang Kai told her. Then, he found himself a seat and sat down, facing the auction stage outside, “If you see anything you like later, don’t hesitate to speak up.”

“I’ll just be watching for fun…” Qin Yu said quietly, but she saw that Yang Kai had already shut his eyes. She couldn’t help but pout as she found herself a chair to sit down on.

The room was silent for a while, which made Qin Yu feel a little uneasy. She had wanted to ask Yang Kai where he’d been these past few years, and what he’d been doing, but seeing Yang Kai have no interest in talking right now, she also couldn’t bring herself to disturb him.

Fortunately, the two did not have to wait long before the auction began.

A beautiful woman walked onto the stage, dressed in revealing clothes. A deep valley between two grand peaks was exposed to the outside air, while her long beautiful legs were only faintly hidden beneath a thin fabric dress. There was a charming look in her eyes, and before saying anything, she smiled, instantly rousing the atmosphere in the auction hall. Seeing this caused Qin Yu’s face to blush while she secretly scorned this woman.

Sneaking a peek at Yang Kai though, she found that his eyes were still closed, which made her feel a little better.
