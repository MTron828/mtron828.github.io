Inside the Wind and Cloud Pavilion, the Yin Yang Five Elements Everchanging Profound Sword Formation had been destroyed. Thus, hundreds of the cultivators that had formed the Sword Formation were revealed. It made the disciples who were watching from the sides cry out with shock. In particular, Yang Kai’s hideous appearance and huge body terrified them greatly.

[What kind of monster is that?!]

“You take the left; I’ll take the right!” Yang Kai swept a cold glance over his surroundings and yelled out instructions to Lin Yun’er.

Lin Yun’er said nothing and simply rushed forward with the iron wok floating above her head. Three Wind and Cloud Pavilion’s disciples gathered in one place didn’t even have the time to react before they exploded to bits from her punch.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai started moving too. Reaching out into the air, he somehow managed to grab the Third Elder in his hands even though the Third Elder was more than thirty metres away. Nobody knew how he managed to do that.

The Third Elder didn’t even have the time to say anything as a chill ran down from the top of his head to the tips of his toes. Then, he was squeezed by a great force until he exploded and followed in the footsteps of the Great Elder.

Afterwards, Yang Kai waved his hand again. This time, another Elder standing close to the Third Elder was sent flying, spitting blood in mid-air and dying before he even reached the ground. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Under the Dragon Transformation, the power hidden in Yang Kai’s Dragon Source was stimulated, allowing him to utilize immense strength, so how could mere First-Order Emperors be his opponents?

Yang Kai and Lin Yun’er mowed through the crowd, leaving a disaster in their wake. Both the disciples and the Elders of Wind and Cloud Pavilion suffered heavy casualties with nobody able to stand up against those two at all.

In just three breaths, more than half of the over hundred people were dead while the rest finally started fleeing in a panic as if they had just awoken from a dream.

In the face of these two monstrous opponents, they could not even muster up the slightest bit of courage to fight back, especially since their artifacts had been taken from them. It was more important to flee for their lives.

*Chi chi chi…*

One after another, Moon Blades flew out in all directions. None of the disciples of Wind and Cloud Pavilion who had contributed to the Sword Formation were spared. They screamed as they fell to the ground. Wherever the Moon Blades struck, a bloodbath ensued.

Lin Yun’er spun around in a circle. She had only killed a few dozen people, but looking around now, there was no corpse left. Only blood rained down from the sky.

The disciples of Wind and Cloud Pavilion watching from afar fell silent like crickets in the winter. Their complexions were ashen. [Just what kind of enemy did the Sect provoke? The entire elite force of the Sect, from the Great Elder all the way down to the Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters in the Third-Order Dao Source Realm are being wiped out! All of them are dying!]

Hua Xing was the only person left in the Sect that was an Emperor Realm Master. Throughout the entire history of the Sect, it had never suffered such severe damage as it had today. After this battle today, Wind and Cloud Pavilion would have difficulty restoring itself even if they managed to repel the enemy. Besides, could these two Monsters even be forced out of the Sect? Clearly the Sect was heading towards complete annihilation.

At that moment, Hua Xing roared in grief and rage, his anguished voice echoing across the sky, “Come out, Divine Beast!”

As soon as the words left his mouth, the expressions of many Wind and Cloud Pavilion’s disciples changed drastically as they looked even more terrified than when they watched Yang Kai and Lin Yun’er slaughtering their brethren.

“What did the Pavilion Master say?!”

“He wants to release the Divine Beast?!”

“Run! Why are you still standing there stupidly!?”

“If you don’t run now, it will be too late!”

The Wind and Cloud Pavilion’s disciples who had been watching from afar reacted as if a great enemy was about to appear and began fleeing helter-skelter, acting as though the Divine Beast was some sort of plague.

Some of the disciples that had just joined the Sect looked confused. Although they knew about the Divine Beast guarding the Sect, none of them had seen it before. They didn’t even know what that Divine Beast was. All they knew was that the Divine Beast was incredibly powerful; in no way inferior in strength compared to the Pavilion Master, Hua Xing.

When they saw their Seniors from the Sect fleeing for their lives though, they began to panic too. It didn’t matter what kind of being the Divine Beast was; it was by no means anything good.

Just after Hua Xing’s roar rang out, an imposing hostility suddenly appeared from somewhere deep within Wind and Cloud Pavilion. It felt as if a sleeping dragon had awoken, and the entire world shuddered in response.

“Hmm?” Yang Kai turned his head to look in the direction of the aura’s source. There was a faint scorching sensation burning throughout the blood in his body, as if some sort of force was pulling against him and made him eager to fight.

Lin Yun’er flew over to him, the shabby iron wok still floating above her head, her beautiful eyes glancing in that direction as she sniffed lightly, her beautiful eyes suddenly brightening.

*Huo…*

Another roar rang out again, and a huge figure flew out from that direction. It looked like some sort of beast that was covered in flames and struck a majestic image.

[Is that the Guardian Divine Beast of Wind and Cloud Pavilion?] Yang Kai raised an eyebrow as his fighting spirit grew even stronger. It couldn’t be helped; it was because he could feel a trace of a Divine Spirit’s aura from this Divine Beast. [I can’t believe that the Guardian Divine Beast of Wind and Cloud Pavilion is a Divine Spirit! Inconceivable!]

Soon, something else happened that shocked him even more. That Divine Beast did not fly straight at them and instead headed towards some of the fleeing Wind and Cloud Pavilion’s disciples. It was as swift as lightning as it rushed into the crowd and in the next moment, blood-curdling screams ringing out. They had obviously been bitten to death by the Divine Beast.

Hua Xing was utterly heartbroken. The Wind and Cloud Pavilion had kept a Guardian Divine Beast for thousands of years. Unfortunately, that Divine Beast was nothing more than an Ominous Beast, which was brought back by the tenth generation Sect Master of Wind and Cloud Pavilion. When the tenth Ancestor was still alive, that Divine Beast was relatively obedient; however, once he passed away, the ferocious nature of this Divine Beast was revealed.

Although it did not leave the Wind and Cloud Pavilion, it was not under anybody’s control either. Only the Pavilion Master of Wind and Cloud Pavilion of each generation could communicate with it a little.

Moreover, there would be a heavy price to pay every time it was brought out of the mountains. If they had time to prepare, they could have enough sacrifices on hand in advance to sate its appetite. Only then could they manage to ask it to repel the powerful enemies of the Sect. Having said that, they were completely unprepared this time around, and for that reason, the price they had to pay were the tragic deaths of their disciples.

Even when Wind and Cloud Pavilion was facing a huge crisis a few hundred years ago, the previous Pavilion Master had not brought the Divine Beast out of the mountains for this exact reason. Nonetheless, Hua Xing no longer had the leisure to care so much anymore with such a huge crisis before them.

The blood-curdling screams continued without stopping as Wind and Cloud Pavilion’s disciples were thrown to the ground and devoured by the Divine Beast, one after another.

“What the hell is that?” Yang Kai squinted as he looked over. It was too bad that the distance was too great so he couldn’t see clearly. All he knew was that the Divine Beast had yet to do anything to them and instead had taken down many of their enemies for them.

“It sure looks delicious!” Lin Yun’er sniffed even harder.

Yang Kai was rendered speechless by her words. [Why does this little girl only think about food?]

A quarter of an hour later, the Divine Beast seemed to have eaten its fill and finally ran through the air, rushing towards them, its hooves were covered in flames and its beastly eyes were burning with fire.

As it approached, Yang Kai finally had a clear glimpse of what the Divine Beast looked like. It had a Dragon Head, Deer Horns, Lion’s Eyes, a Tiger’s Back, a Bear’s Waist, Snake Scales, Horse Hooves, and a Cow’s Tail. It was extremely menacing and looked down on everyone present with clear disdain in its eyes.

“A Fire Qilin?” Yang Kai’s brow rose slightly. No wonder it had the aura of a Divine Spirit, it actually turned out to be a Fire Qilin! There were many types of Qilins, but all Qilins were Ancient Divine Spirits regardless of what species they were. The Dragon Clan blood flowing in Yang Kai’s veins also belonged to a Divine Spirit, and as both the Qilin and the Dragon Clan were considered superior beings among the Divine Spirits, their auras would naturally be attracted to each other.

“It only resembles a Fire Qilin,” Lin Yun’er seemed to have some knowledge on Divine Spirits though and her eyes were gleaming as she said, “It has a Qilin bloodline, but it’s not a pureblood.”

Yang Kai turned to glance at her with a speechless expression. “Yun’er… You’re drooling…”

She lifted a hand, wiped at the corner of her mouth, and excitedly proclaimed, “Leave this to me!” After saying that, she rushed forward.

“Be careful!” Yang Kai yelled after her. Although her strength was impressive, encountering an Ominous Beast with the blood of a Divine Spirit was still rather worrisome and he was certain she was not its opponent. Even so, she acted so confidently that Yang Kai couldn’t bear to discourage her; thus, he decided to be ready to react at a moment’s notice.

Both the human and the beast approached each other swiftly. The Fire Qilin descendent was clearly sentient, and when it saw Lin Yun’er rushing towards it, it roared furiously while at the same time, the flames on its body burned even more fiercely.

Lin Yun’er was unfazed by its reaction and continued to rush forward.

Opening its mouth, it shot out a large fireball that gave off an extremely terrifying heat; however, Lin Yun’er didn’t even flinch and instead used the iron wok to take on the attack.

The iron wok wasn’t that large, only about the size of a washbasin. Moreover, it was several times smaller than the fireball, but contrary to expectations, the fireball disappeared cleanly when it came into contact with the iron wok.

Yang Kai, who had been on the verge of moving, stopped in his tracks. His scorching gaze glanced at that black and shabby iron wok with a question in his heart: Just what was this thing!?

Meanwhile, Lin Yun’er had arrived right in front of the Qilin descendant. She kicked out with her feet, immediately jumped up, and swung the iron wok at its head.

In response, the Qilin descendant lifted its claws and swiped at the iron wok. The air surrounding the passage of its claws became distorted, forming irregular claw marks in the sky.

Forcibly twisted her body in mid-air, Lin Yun’er barely avoided the attack. Even so, she was slashed around her abdomen area. Blood gushed out immediately but she ignored it and slammed the iron wok down on the enemy’s head.

In the next moment, a miraculous scene occurred. The Ominous Beast, which could rival a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master in strength, and was also a Qilin descendant blessed by the Divine Spirit’s bloodlines suddenly yelped and swayed unsteadily. The iron wok now looked like it had become part of its head; furthermore, it released a terrifying suction force.

The humongous body of the Ominous Beast was drawn in by the inexplicable force, twisted, and distorted, then was soon sucked into the iron wok like a stream of water and vanished without a trace.

Yang Kai was stunned; Li Jiao was stunned; Hua Xing was stunned too! Even Lin Yun’er seemed slightly stunned as well, scratching her head as she wore a confused expression.

Despite being aware of the power of her treasure and having the confidence that it could deal with that Ominous Beast, she had not expected it to be so easy. She had been prepared to fight a tough battle against it and never imagined that it would actually end in one move.

She was a simple-minded person though, and excitedly taking back the iron wok without thinking too much about it, she brought out a lid from who knows where and placed it onto the iron wok with a resounding snap. Then, she glanced about with a huge smile, her expression becoming more and more delighted.

On the other hand, Li Jiao’s expression changed drastically. Even though he experienced all sorts of dangerous situations before, he couldn’t help shuddering at this moment. When Hua Xing called upon the Divine Beast of Wind and Cloud Pavilion, Li Jiao had taken the time to check out the Divine Beast’s strength. Even if he had fought it with all his strength, he was not confident he could win against it; however, such a terrifying existence had been defeated by a mere iron wok, in one move no less.

It was something he found simply incomprehensible.
