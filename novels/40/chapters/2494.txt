The old man boasted as if even Wen Zi Shan had to obey his orders.

Yang Kai snorted, “You speak as if you were the Bustling World Great Emperor!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

It seemed that Temple Master Wen Zi Shan was brought up by the Bustling World Great Emperor, so if anyone in this world could order him around at will, it would undoubtedly be that Great Emperor. However, the Bustling World Great Emperor was a man who was always wandering around the world, living a wilful life of leisure. He came and went without a trace, with no fixed place to stay, so no one knew where to find him, and any news regarding his whereabouts had been absent in the Star Boundary for a long time.

The old man widened his eyes and exclaimed, “Oh? How did you know?”

Yang Kai spat disdainfully, “It was sarcasm.”

Undoubtedly, the old swindler might be some hidden Master, since he knew so many secrets and so many people, even Yao Si, were respectful to him. He was by no means an ordinary person.

But Yang Kai would never believe that he was the Bustling World Great Emperor.

Because this place was the Shattered Star Sea!

The Shattered Star Sea was a place that only Dao Source Realm cultivators could enter, not Emperor Realm Masters. It was impossible for the Bustling World Great Emperor, who had a terrifying cultivation, to come here. If he forcefully broke through the world barriers to enter this place, the Shattered Star Sea would become unstable and collapse.

The old man smiled faintly, no longer paying attention to Yang Kai, instead turning to look at the remaining Dao Source Realm cultivators and sighing lightly, “Men die for wealth, birds die for food.”

The reason these cultivators had not left was obviously that they were hoping to get some benefits, especially now with the absence of strong competitors like the Emperor Realm Masters, they became more excited and eager to try.

After muttering for a while, the old man shouted loudly, “Since you all want the Space Ring so much… this Old Master will grant your wish.”

Everyone looked at him suspiciously after hearing this as they did not understand what he really meant.

Ignoring their confused looks, the old swindler strode over to the front of the black hole and formed a set of profound seals. In the next moment, his hand glowed brightly as it was about to make contact with the black hole.

“What is this old man… doing?”

“Is he planning to take out the Space Ring?”

“Is he really so strong? Sii… look! He is reaching out his hand.”

“What’s happening inside!? Ah… the light is too dazzling, I can’t see what’s happening!”

The area was buzzing with excitement as everyone’s eyes went round, staring at the old man’s actions.

Yang Kai was particularly dumbstruck.

Ever since the formation of the black hole, he had clearly felt fluctuating Space Principles from it. In other words, there was another bizarre space inside the black hole; however, this space was extremely unstable, and even someone like him, who was proficient in the Dao of Space, dared not simply break in.

Yang Kai never thought that this old man could plunge his hand into that space.

Was he proficient in the Dao of Space too? Yang Kai tried to sense what was happening, but he could not detect any kind of Space Principle fluctuations coming from the old swindler, causing his face to fill with confusion.

A while later, the old man suddenly bellowed and retracted his hand.

As the bright light dissipated, an archaic Space Ring was seen in his hand.

Everyone was in an uproar, staring at the ring with bloodshot eyes, the sounds of gulping echoing one after another.

When they looked back at the black hole, they saw nothing on the skeleton’s finger anymore.

“He really took out the ring!”

“Can this kind of thing be done?”

“It’s amazing! What’s in the ring?”

“Old man, hand over the Space Ring now and we can still spare your life!”

After the old man took out the Space Ring, the crowd boiled with excitement and everyone began to push their Source Qi while shouting, preparing to snatch the Space Ring at any time.

Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat on his forehead, and remarked, “Old man, you have created a problem for yourself. Let’s see how you handle this situation!”

Although the old man was strong and unfathomable, Yang Kai did not believe that he was capable enough to face a thousand Dao Source Realm cultivators. If they pounced on him together, the only thing he could do was to run.

The old man responded with a light smile, “They only have their eyes on this ring. If that’s the case, I will just give it to them.”

“Give it to them?” Yang Kai was stunned.

Before he could react, the old man swung his hand and tossed the Space Ring somewhere into the void as he shouted, “If you want it, grab it yourself!”

The old man must have used some unknown technique at that instant because the Space Ring burst into light and flew far away like a bolt of lightning.

“Old man, are you courting death? How dare you throw the ring away!?”

“Just you wait! This Young Master will settle this with you later after getting that Space Ring!”

“Don’t be so long-winded, quickly chase it! You’ll cultivate for a lifetime with ease if you get that ring!”

*Shua shua shua…*

The area radiated with streams of light as all the cultivators turned to chase after the Space Ring. In the blink of an eye, the thousand cultivators were all gone.

The old man looked at their receding figures and sighed, “This Old Master should have done this earlier.”

Next, he put on an annoyed look and turned to Yang Kai to ask, “Little brat, why didn’t you chase after it too? That’s a Great Emperor’s Space Ring. Surely countless Emperor Artifacts and precious treasures were inside of it. If you can obtain it, you will be able to break through to Emperor Realm in no time.”

He tried to persuade Yang Kai with his bewitching words, obviously wanting him to leave.

Yang Kai sneered, “Old man, like you said before, most items of value were destroyed long ago and only a few were leftover from the War of Emperors, so why should I chase after a ring that has nothing good in it?” After a pause, he pressed on with a sly smile, “Furthermore, the Space Ring is still here, and the one that you tossed away is just a fake. Why would I chase after a fake?”

The old man stared at Yang Kai with his widened eyes, “Oh? How did you see through my trick? It should be impossible for you to see through this Old Master’s technique!”

Yang Kai nodded, “Old man’s skill is truly amazing, but… since you didn’t even reach your hand into that black hole, how could you possibly take out the ring? What’s more, even though the skeleton and the ring seemed to be nearby, they are actually a world away from us. How could it be possible to obtain that ring by just stretching out your hand? What seems to be in front of us is just an illusion caused by the superimposition of space.”

The old man was surprised by Yang Kai’s explanation and asked, “You have a good eye. So, are you staying here for the ring?”

Yang Kai answered, “I just want to know about Ruo Xi’s Bloodline!”

“I really can’t tell you about it. You will eventually understand in the future.”

Yang Kai had no idea why the old man would definitely avoid the topic every time he mentioned Zhang Ruo Xi’s Bloodline.

“This Old Master has something to do now, and it is truly dangerous here so you should leave quickly. Your life doesn’t matter, but the two little girls in your arms should not be harmed!”

“Something to do? Like what?” Yang Kai looked at him quizzically.

But the old man had already rushed towards the black hole with a serious expression. Yang Kai wondered if it was an illusion, because he actually saw a trace of determination and distress in the old man’s eyes, like he was preparing for a grand mission that would require him to make a great sacrifice.

When he reached the front of the black hole, the old man performed a series of hand seals rapidly before palming towards its surface.

A ripple undulated from the black hole, as if an invisible door had been opened, and the old man flew straight through the door, entering the black hole.

The skeleton disappeared strangely together with the old man, who also vanished after the ripples faded. Yang Kai looked around, and saw only the black hole remaining in place.

A wave of different power, which was quite familiar to Yang Kai, suddenly came out from the black hole.

With a single thought, he hurriedly took out a jade slip from his Space Ring.

This was the jade slip that the Embodiment snatched from Wu Meng Chuan before he died. According to the Embodiment, Wu Meng Chuan seemingly wanted to destroy this jade slip, as if he was afraid of revealing the secrets in it.

There were many mysterious seals on this jade slip that Yang Kai tried to crack before, but to no avail.

However, at this moment, Yang Kai was astonished to find that the fluctuations coming from the black hole were exactly the same as the ones pulsing from this jade slip. It seemed like it was left behind by the same person.

A light burst from the jade slip as soon as Yang Kai took it out, and subsequently, the barriers sealing it resonated amazingly with the fluctuations coming from the black hole.

An extremely powerful suction abruptly came out from the black hole, trying to pull everything around it inside.

Yang Kai was startled and his face changed drastically as he tried to escape.

But what terrified him was that no matter how hard he tried, he could not move at all.

The black hole was like an ancient beast’s great maw, attempting to swallow him with a single bite.

After resisting for a few breaths of time, Yang Kai could not withstand it any longer. Before he was devoured, he threw Zhang Ruo Xi and Mo Xiao Qi, who were still unconscious, together with Liu Yan into the Sealed World Bead.

Just as Yang Kai finished securing their safety, his vision turned black, as if he had fallen into a bottomless abyss. There was no light around him, and there was no ground under his feet.

After an unknown amount of time, Yang Kai suddenly felt pain all over his body, and he felt like his feet were finally stepping on an object. Landing on the ground with a slam, he found himself in an inexplicable world.

In this world, there were no sun, moon, or stars, even the World Energy was exceedingly thin here. The whole world was presented in a quaint red.

Yang Kai looked around and saw bright red blood flowing across the ground under his feet. The blood was extremely fresh, exuded a pungent stench, and like ten thousand rivers flowing into the sea, was gathering slowly in a certain direction.

Countless mutilated corpses and bloody pieces of flesh could be seen all around the ground, making for a horrifying scene.

“These are…” Yang Kai observed his surroundings as he mumbled to himself with a darkened face, “The cultivators who died in the Source Sea?”

The fresh blood and mutilated corpses that he had just seen were obviously from the cultivators who had recently died outside, as the corpses were still fresh and showed no signs of decomposition.

“They have all been sucked into this place!” Yang Kai’s face turned ugly in befuddlement.
