Yang Kai had obtained a Flesh Incarnation Fruit in the ancient medicine garden last time when he saved Gao Xue Ting, so as long as he could gather the necessary adjuvants, Yang Kai would be able to refine the Flesh Incarnation Pill that would allow Tian Yan, who was in the Azure Sun Temple’s Divine Ascension Mirror, to form a physical body.

Although Tian Yan was only a Soul Avatar, he was a Master at the level of a Great Emperor. If he could obtain a physical body through the Flesh Incarnation Pill, then the Star Boundary would gain an additional Great Emperor.

Yang Kai was spending such a great deal of effort on this matter because Tian Yan was a good person who had taught him a Soul Secret Technique, Heaven Severing Slash, back in the Divine Ascension Mirror. There was also his promise to Tian Yan long ago. Besides, it was rare to have the opportunity for a Great Emperor to owe him a favour.

As long as he helped Tian Yan obtain a physical body, Tian Yan would naturally help him out if he had trouble in the future.

However… The Flesh Incarnation Pill was highly difficult to refine, and it also required many rare herbs. Eighty-one adjuvants were required, and all of them were Emperor Grade spirit medicines that were rare and difficult to find.

Although Yang Kai had many rare spirit medicines in his possession, he could barely put together half of the ones he needed and had no idea where to search for the rest.

He could only hope that the three Divine Venerables of the Ancient Lands could help him find the others. As long as all the herbs were gathered, he would be able to refine the Flesh Incarnation Pill and then return to Azure Sun Temple to see Tian Yan.

Yang Kai began looking forward to how things would be as he thought about this.

Another several days passed, and on this day, while Yang Kai was in the middle of performing Alchemy, he suddenly raised his head and glanced outside, as if he sensed something. He immediately called out, “Yao’er.”

Ji Yao hurriedly opened her eyes from her meditation and respectfully answered, “Yes.”

“A guest has arrived. Go tell them your Master is currently in a retreat and can’t be bothered. Mmm… accept what they’ve brought, and tell them that I’ll be leaving the Ancient Lands after my injuries are fully healed.”

“Yes!” Upon hearing this, Ji Yao hurriedly stood up and went down to the first floor.

Soon after, the sound of conversation could be heard from downstairs. Some moments later, Ji Yao returned and respectfully handed four Space Rings to Yang Kai, “Honoured Master, the three Divine Venerables wanted me to give these to you.”

Yang Kai nodded as he took the four Space Rings.

He randomly picked a ring and scanned it. Yang Kai couldn’t help but chuckle as he thought that the three Divine Venerables were paying a great deal of attention to detail.

The four Space Rings probably each contained items from a separate Divine Venerable. They were afraid that Yang Kai wouldn’t be able to tell which ring came from which person, so they even especially left their own auras on the rings so that they wouldn’t be mistaken as having come from another person.

This ring in Yang Kai’s hand was apparently Fan Wu’s contribution. It was unknown what presents were in the ring for him.

Yang Kai secretly looked forward to the results as he sent his Divine Sense into the ring to investigate.

He glanced inside and saw two mountainous piles of Source Crystals. One pile was larger than the other, with the larger pile being Mid-Rank Source Crystals, while the smaller pile consisted of High-Rank Source Crystals.

Yang Kai made some quick calculations and couldn’t help but laugh out loud. There were approximately three billion Mid-Rank Source Crystals, along with approximately fifty million High-Rank Source Crystals. Such a large amount of Source Crystals was an outstanding amount of wealth.

Even a top Sect would probably harm its very foundation if it had to bring out so many Source Crystals at once. It should be said that one High-Rank Source Crystal could be exchanged for one hundred Mid-Rank Source Crystals, and one Mid-Rank Source Crystal could be exchanged for one hundred Low-Rank Source Crystals.

Fifty million High-Rank Source Crystals didn’t sound like much, but when you exchanged them, that would be five billion Mid-Rank Source Crystals or five hundred billion Low-Rank Source Crystals.

That was a rather terrifying number.

Yang Kai had killed and robbed others for many years already, and although his accumulated wealth was significant, it was really nothing in comparison to Fan Wu’s enormous gift.

High-Rank Source Crystals were limited in number throughout the entire Star Boundary, which is why almost all exchanges, no matter the type, would use Low-Rank or Mid-Rank Source Crystals. High-Rank Source Crystals were mostly used for cultivation and breakthroughs by Masters.

Fan Wu had given Yang Kai fifty million High-Rank Source Crystals at once. This was more than enough for a major Sect to use for several years.

Next to the two piles of Source Crystals was a pile of Monster Beast Cores.

This was the Ancient Lands where Monster Beasts were incredibly common, so Monster Cores would be left behind when these Monster Beasts died.

Still, there weren’t that many Monster Cores, a mere hundred Twelfth-Order Monster Cores, while there were two thousand Eleventh-Order Monster Cores and thirty thousand Tenth-Order Monster Cores. However, there wasn’t even a single Monster Core that was less than Tenth-Order, as Fan Wu had figured that Yang Kai wouldn’t be interested in them and thus didn’t even bother giving him any.

This amount of Monster Cores would be an astonishing amount of wealth in anyone else’s hands, but to Yang Kai, who already possessed around a million Monster Cores, it wasn’t much.

Still, it likely hadn’t been easy for Fan Wu to obtain so many Monster Cores. One hundred Twelfth-Order Monster Cores was something that could only be obtained from the death of one hundred Monster Beasts’ equivalent in strength to Emperor Realm Human Masters.

The Four Great Divine Venerables had only been able to gather so many Monster Cores because they had ruled the Ancient Lands for countless millennia. If this was any Human Sect, bringing out one hundred Twelfth-Order Monster Cores would be unimaginable.

Yang Kai soon glanced over at another pile of items.

This pile was a pile of glowing spirit medicine all stacked together. There were even various spirit fruits of different colours that looked quite alluring.

Every spirit medicine and spirit fruit was Emperor Grade, not a single one being Dao Source Grade.

“I’ve made quite a profit!” Yang Kai wiped away some drool from his mouth as a green light seemed to flash from his eyes.

These spirit medicines numbered at least ten to twenty thousand, and at a glance, Yang Kai saw many of the adjuvants he needed to refine the Flesh Incarnation Pill.

This was truly a huge profit. Compared to the Source Crystals and Monster Cores, Yang Kai needed these spirit medicines more. All of these were more than enough to make any Alchemist go mad.

“But… That guy… How can he just casually pile up these precious spirit medicines so sloppily like this? It’s such a waste of the Heavens’ precious gifts,” Yang Kai cursed under his breath.

These spirit grasses and herbs hadn’t been preserved appropriately, and after some time passed, their medicinal efficacies would surely reduce.

Luckily, Yang Kai had his Sealed World Bead and the medicine garden within it. Yang Kai had previously organized his ancient medicine garden and expanded its area. The soil in the ancient medicine garden was extremely fertile and the best possible environment to raise spirit medicines in.

Considering all this, Yang Kai hurriedly tossed all the spirit medicines in the ring into the medicine garden of his Sealed World Bead. He wasn’t counting on being able to replant them and only hoped that they wouldn’t lose too much of their medicinal efficacies being stored in an appropriate environment.

There were too many things for Yang Kai to organize for the time being. He intended to properly sort through everything when he had some free time to see if he could find the herbs necessary for refining the Flesh Incarnation Fruit from among these spirit medicines.

That was everything in the Space Ring that Fan Wu gave him, but it really was a huge present.

Yang Kai was extremely satisfied.

He then immediately picked up the second ring and scanned it slightly. He confirmed that Cang Gou’s aura was on it, so this was undoubtedly his offering.

After scanning the ring carefully, Yang Kai discovered that Cang Gou’s present was similar to Fan Wu’s, probably because the two of them had discussed it beforehand. The number of Source Crystals, Monster Cores, and spirit medicines were almost identical.

Yang Kai wasn’t surprised by this.

He then picked up the third Space Ring, which came from Luan Feng’s.

As expected, Luan Feng’s present was about the same as the previous two presents.

Yang Kai started looking forward to seeing the final ring.

There wasn’t anyone’s aura upon this ring, but Yang Kai knew that this ring contained all of Shi Huo’s treasures.

Divine Spirit Shi Huo had lived in the Ancient Lands for tens of thousands of years, so Yang Kai was really interested in how much wealth had accumulated over all that time.

Despite his already high expectations, Yang Kai was stupefied when he really sent his Divine Sense into the ring.

He saw Source Crystals piled up like mountains, once again sorted into two categories; however, these two piles were more than ten times larger than the piles that Fan Wu and the others gave him.

In other words, there were at least thirty billion Mid-Rank Source Crystals, and five hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Even though Yang Kai had mentally prepared himself, this was still a truly awe-inducing sight.

The Monster Cores were also more than ten times the number that Fan Wu and the others gave him, with several thousand Twelfth-Order Monster Cores and several tens of thousands of Eleventh-Order Monster Cores. There were fewer Tenth-Order Monster Cores, as there were only a few tens of thousands of them.

There was also ten times the number of spirit medicines. Just looking at the pile of spirit medicines made Yang Kai want to jump for joy.

When adding all the wealth in the four Space Rings combined, just Mid-Rank Source Crystals alone would be over forty billion, while there were also some six hundred and fifty million High-Rank Source Crystals.

Yang Kai didn’t count the Monster Cores, since he already possessed around a million of those, so the Monster Cores that the Divine Venerables gave him could only be counted as an extra few.

However, there were more than one hundred thousand spirit medicines. It was an unbelievable amount of wealth. It was likely that only the Ancient Wild Lands could possibly produce so many spirit medicines, as no other place in the Star Boundary would have such rich, fertile soil that was completely untapped by human hands.

With Yang Kai’s current wealth, it was likely that only the Sects run by the Great Emperors were capable of being equal to him, but even they might not compare. This was because even though these Sects would have large coffers and many productive industries, they would also have many disciples and would need to spend a great deal on cultivation expenses every year.

In Shi Huo’s treasures, apart from Source Crystals, Monster Cores, and spirit medicines, there were also countless rare ores as well as random items that Yang Kai couldn’t identify. He figured they were things left behind from Shi Hou’s death, and it was likely that Fan Wu and the others had gathered everything and given it all to Yang Kai.

When comparing all of the presents, Fan Wu and the others had given Yang Kai approximately ten percent of their total wealth.

It was still a huge gift. If it wasn’t for Yang Kai being so close to Zhang Ruo Xi, none of them would be willing to part with ten percent of their net worth just to appease him.

Fan Wu and the others were helpless to do anything else.

Ever since Yang Kai started checking the contents of the four rings, he had been laughing like a fool as he checked the rings. He would check for a while then start laughing in a silly manner, and this would keep repeating itself…

Ji Yao felt really scared as she watched from the side. She didn’t know what was going on with her Honoured Master, but she didn’t dare to ask. She could only stand there with an uneasy expression.

Finally, she managed to wait until Yang Kai finished laughing like a drunken idiot and weakly spoke up, “Honoured Master…”

“Hmm?” Yang Kai suddenly came back to his senses as he realized how he had just debased himself. He hurriedly forced a stiff expression onto his face as he said, “Yao’er, go tell Lady Feng that your Master’s injuries are healed now, and that I will be leaving this place tomorrow. Tell her to rest assured.”

“Yes!” Ji Yao answered as she went downstairs again.
