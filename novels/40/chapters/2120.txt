In the void, the hiding Uncle Li looked in surprise at Yang Kai and whistled “This lad is quite... attentive.”

“Does Brother Yang know I’m here?” Mo Xiao Qi was also taken aback and she looked toward Yang Kai, who was waving his hand at her in greeting. She quickly tried to give him a reply, but her voice couldn’t reach Yang Kai.

The void had been confined by a powerful force and it had been isolated thoroughly.

Mo Xiao Qi couldn’t help but get anxious!

On the other side, Yang Kai laughed, “Mo Xiao Qi, it’s enough for you to see me. Go back to your family obediently. I hope we will meet again.”

“Huh...” Mo Xiao Qi nodded and said, “Okay!”

She had been dejected for a while because she couldn’t see Yang Kai one last time before leaving, yet upon hearing Yang Kai’s words, she got over her sorrow and laughed cheerfully.

Yang Kai turned his head to face the red-robed woman and said, “Aunty Feng...”

“Who is Aunty Feng and who are you calling?” The red-robed woman gazed at Yang Kai with a cold look plastered on her face.

“Senior...”

“If you dare to say so again...”

Yang Kai took a deep breath and said, “Miss... I already know why you have obstructed us here...”

“You think you’re clever?” The red-robed woman snorted coldly and interrupted Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was taken aback and he could only furrow his brows, “Since you don’t want to admit it... Then I can only...”

As he spoke, he suddenly faced the void and said warmly with an affectionate look plastered on his face, “Xiao Qi, go back home and wait for me. Once I prepare a betrothal gift, I’ll visit your home to ask for your hand.”

The red-robed woman’s face fell and she yelled, “Lad, you dare...”

But, she suddenly realized something midways and said through gnashed teeth, “You’re so cunning.”

At this moment, she had realized that Yang Kai’s words didn’t reach Mo Xiao Qi and he had said them only to her, while her reaction had clearly confirmed Yang Kai’s guess.

“That’s right, I’m Xiao Qi’s Aunty Feng,” the red-robed woman couldn’t continue acting dumb and she could only admit it. She glared at Yang Kai, “I don’t care about your origins nor your prospects. Xiao Qi isn’t a girl the likes of you can covet, don’t ever forget this.”

“Miss, you have come here just to admonish me for lusting over swan meat?” Yang Kai said calmly, “If that’s so, then why didn’t you say so early on.”

“At least, you know your place.” The red-robed woman snorted and said, “You’re quite sensible and I won’t bully you. But, don’t forget my words, if you dare to have any presumptuous thoughts about Xiao Qi, then I’ll make you regret being born in this world.”

“Miss, your threat is so... feeble.” Yang Kai chuckled. “But, you don’t have to worry, Xiao Qi and I are only friends...”

“That is for the best!” The red-robed woman nodded with satisfaction.

Yang Kai chuckled, “I prefer alluring mature women over such young girls, mature women such as... you. I really couldn’t help but fall for you.”

*Splurt*

In the void, Uncle Li splurted a mouthful of tea again and his jaw dropped in shock. After a long while, he came back to his senses and said, while wiping the sweat off his face, “She got teased... She really got teased...”

As he spoke, he couldn’t help but laugh loudly. “A lad wet behind the ears dared to tease Miss Jiu, if the Great Emperor hears of this, he’d have a good laugh.”

“Brother Yang, how can he say...” The face of Mo Xiao Qi opposite him got flushed, “He’s so shameless!”

“Do you like women such as me?” The red-robed woman’s expression turned strange and she observed Yang Kai with great interest. She said, “Those presumptuous words are enough of a reason for me to cut off your tongue.”

“But...” She suddenly smiled sweetly and looked at him coquettishly. She said in a silky voice, “I really like your honesty. If your cultivation base surpasses mine, then I may consider giving you a chance to court me.”

“Haha, then it’s a promise,” Yang Kai laughed and said.

The red-robed woman stared at him for a long while then said mockingly, “Conceited fool!”

As her voice fell, her body flickered and disappeared suddenly.

“Hey! Miss, you have destroyed my Flying Artifact, yet you just want to walk away? Aren’t you too shameless?” Yang Kai shouted at the void.

After his voice fell, a blue light suddenly shot toward him and it stopped in front of him.

Yang Kai observed the blue light for a while and discovered that it was a little wooden boat shrouded by light. It was a three-inch-long boat, emitting the energy ripples of a Dao Source Artifact.

“She has given me compensation for real?” Yang Kai was surprised, but still gladly accepted the wooden boat and put it in his Space Ring, then stood in the air and waited in silence.

After a long while, he suddenly shivered and beads of sweat seeped off his forehead and his clothes quickly got drenched in sweat. He couldn’t help but open his mouth and start gasping for breath, as if he was a fish that had just left water.

The confrontation with the red-robed woman hadn’t been dangerous, but it was still anything but peaceful.

After all, she was a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master and her cultivation base was above Yang Kai’s by many Realms. Even if Yang Kai opened the Golden Silver Seal in his belly, he might not have a good chance to escape from her. This was why he could only try risky moves.

Fortunately, he suddenly guessed her identity at a crucial juncture.

It hadn’t been hard for him to guess it. After all, he didn’t have any feud with the red-robed woman, yet this Third-Order Emperor Realm Master had come specially to make trouble for him. So, she obviously had different reasons behind this.

As Yang Kai mulled it over repeatedly, he could only think of Mo Xiao Qi. Prior to her departure, she left a jade slip and told Yang Kai that her Aunty Feng was coming for her.

Mo Xiao Qi was only a Third-Order Origin King. So, how could she escape from Aunty Feng? She would surely get caught and sent back home.

Moreover, Aunty Feng might have heard about Yang Kai from Mo Xiao Qi after catching her and that was why she had come especially for him to feel him out.

Yang Kai could understand the reason behind Aunty Feng’s actions. If that inexperienced and naive girl mentioned a stranger repeatedly, then she would surely have to go have a look at Yang Kai’s character and see whether he had deceived her.

As for what happened later? It was quite simple. After he learned of the woman’s identity, he realized that Mo Xiao Qi was likely hidden in the vicinity.

As for the red-robed woman, she would surely not kill him.

But, she had used some sort of Soul Secret Technique before leaving and Yang Kai had almost made a fool out of himself due to her brief seduction.

However, Aunty Feng had underestimated Yang Kai’s Spiritual Energy and he managed to draw help from the Soul Warming Lotus to get rid of her influence, or else, he would have made a fool out of himself in front of Mo Xiao Qi and she wouldn’t ever pay heed to him again.

“They should have left, right?” Yang Kai mumbled. He was quite feeble right now, but he still braced himself and went to check on Qin Zhao Yang.

After he checked him briefly, he ascertained that he was only unconscious and didn’t suffer any injuries. It looked like Aunty Feng had knocked him out on purpose to get a chance to talk to Yang Kai in private.

...

In the distance, Uncle Li cast a Great Divine Ability and travelled through the void with Mo Xiao Qi and Aunty Feng.

Mo Xiao Qi was sulking, but the two Emperor Realm Masters didn’t pay any heed to her.

Uncle Li was frequently casting glances at Aunty Feng, as if he had something to tell her.

“What’s on your mind? Just blurt it out, why are you casting stealthy glances at me?” Aunty Feng flew into a rage and glared at Uncle Li with her pretty eyes.

Uncle Li laughed sheepishly, “I’m only curious, how did the lad resist your Soul Suction Technique. How much power did you use? One-tenth... or half a tenth?”

Aunty Feng quieted for a while then said, “Two tenths!”

“Are you making fun of me?” Uncle Li’s eyes widened.

Aunty Feng said, “That brat’s Spiritual Energy is so strange. He’s only a First-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivator, yet his Spiritual Energy is on par with a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivator, and he’s also...”

“What else?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“It looks like he’s also protected by a strong Artifact... That artifact resisted most of my Soul Suction Technique’s might.”

“Even you can’t detect what kind of Artifact it is?”

“It’s within his Knowledge Sea and I can’t detect it unless I crack open his head and have a look at it.”

“Don’t bring up such scary matters, I’m still here,” Mo Xiao Qi cut into the discussion and reminded them of her existence.

“Moreover, that brat is...” Aunty Feng didn’t pay heed to Mo Xiao Qi and looked at Uncle Li with great interest. She chuckled and said, “His attainments in the Space Force are pretty high and he can even cast a black hole-like Secret Technique. I clearly remember that you weren’t able to achieve this feat in the past at his cultivation level.”

“What are you trying to say?” Uncle Li looked askance at her.

Aunty Feng smiled and said, “It isn’t easy to find a suitable candidate, why don’t you consider taking him in as your disciple? Honestly speaking, that brat is pretty good, and even the Star Boundary’s top sects couldn’t raise a person of his calibre.”

“Pah!” Uncle Li sneered, “What’s so good about having a disciple? If I take one, then I’ll have to waste time teaching him and I’ll still have to worry about him as he may have an early death at any moment... If he was a pretty young girl, then I may consider raising him, but it’s a pity... Tsk, tsk...”

“Then, that’s his loss,” Aunty Feng said with a smile.

“That’s right.” Mo Xiao Qi suddenly clapped and said, “Uncle Li, you and Brother Yang are both proficient in Space Force, why don’t you take him in as your disciple? He can inherit your mantle.”

“I refuse!” Uncle Li didn’t give this any consideration.

Mo Xiao Qi cast a glance at him then turned around and looked at Aunty Feng. She said, “Aunty Feng, when I was four years old, Uncle Li...”

“Hey, hey...” Uncle Li’s expression changed and he suddenly prayed and let out strange cries, “I suddenly think that taking in a disciple is a pretty good idea. If I’m in a good mood, I can teach him for a while, and if I’m in a bad mood, I can call him over and teach him a lesson. Taking care of a mischievous disciple would be a pleasant experience.”

“Uncle Li, are you serious?” Mo Xiao Qi looked at him excitedly.

“Huh...huh...” Uncle Li nodded solemnly, “Once I meet him again, I’ll take him as a disciple.”
