Yang Kai was just replying to Hei Yuan’s questions in a perfunctory manner, but it happened to cause the latter to have some misunderstandings. Certainly, he wouldn’t try to correct him.

“I saw you consuming a Spirit Pill in the previous battle to dispel the Black Ink Strength.”

“Yes!” Yang Kai nodded.

Hei Yuan leaned forward, “What kind of Spirit Pill is that? Show me.”

Yang Kai appeared to be in a dilemma, “Master, the pill is called the Purifying Black Ink Pill, which was newly invented by the Humans. Due to the difficulty in producing them though, I was only given one pill. I consumed it on the battlefield, so there are none left.”

“Purifying Black Ink Pill!” Hei Yuan felt his brow twitching, “When was it invented?”

After appearing to give it a thought, Yang Kai replied, “About 20 years ago.”

Hei Yuan gritted his teeth, “It must be thanks to these Purifying Black Ink Pills that the Humans have repeatedly fended off Black Ink Strength. Is that why there have not been any new Black Ink Disciples recently?”

“Yes.”

“Damn!” Hei Yuan was furious as he finally realised why there were no new Black Ink Disciples over the past 20 years. They had speculated that the Humans must have invented a way to defend against Black Ink Strength, but they had no idea what it was. If he hadn’t subdued this Human named Yang Kai by chance, they still wouldn’t have found out about it.

After blowing his top for a moment, he asked, “How difficult is it to make these Purifying Black Ink Pills?”

Since this was an important matter, Hei Yuan had to find out all the details possible and report them to the Royal Lord at a later time.

Yang Kai replied respectfully, “I know nothing about Alchemy, but I’ve heard some rumours that it is difficult to refine Purifying Black Ink Pills. Even the Alchemy Grandmasters wouldn’t always succeed in producing them, so the success rate is fairly low. Usually, a Squad would only be given one pill.”

Hei Yuan’s expression turned milder. Yang Kai’s statement verified what he had seen on the battlefield. There were a total of 3 Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in that Squad; however, other than Yang Kai, who consumed a Purifying Black Ink Pill to dispel the Black Ink Strength, the other Seventh-Order Humans didn’t take such pills even though they had been affected by Black Ink Strength as well.

After, they fled from the battlefield and disappeared.

This was good news for the Black Ink Clan as every Squad was only given a single Purifying Black Ink Pill. Hei Yuan was most worried that it would be easy to refine these pills and that all Humans would be given several of them. If that were to happen, the Black Ink Clan would suffer a huge setback if they were caught unprepared.

As he set his mind at ease, he went on to ask, “Has the Old Ancestor from Yin-Yang Pass recovered from her injuries?”

Yang Kai was startled for a moment. He wouldn’t have known that the Old Ancestor in Yin-Yang Pass was injured if Hei Yuan hadn’t asked, so how was he supposed to know the Old Ancestor’s condition?

Since the Old Ancestor was wounded, there was no way Mu Guang was in a better state. Yang Kai wondered when the two of them had fought against each other.

Hei Yuan nodded, “It has been about 100 years since the last great war. Regardless of how badly wounded she was, she must have recovered by now. I’m worried that another large battle will break out again soon.”

It wasn’t until this moment that Yang Kai found out it had been 100 years since the Old Ancestor of Yin-Yang Pass was wounded. In other words, there was a grand battle in the Yin-Yang Theatre 100 years ago. Even the Old Ancestor and the Royal Lord had exchanged moves at that time.

100 years had passed in the blink of an eye, and both Races had had enough time to recuperate, so war was now imminent.

However, the big battle in the resource harvesting area just recently would probably delay the all-out war by several years; after all, several powerhouses from both the Humans and Black Ink Clan were injured. It would take them some time to restore their strength.

Just then, a Feudal Lord entered the room. It was none other than Zha Gu who cupped his fist and said, “Sir Territory Lord, we’re about to arrive.”

Hei Yuan nodded and waved his hand at Yang Kai, “You can go back now.”

Yang Kai responded respectfully and left the cabin.

Upon returning to the deck, he looked into the distance and saw a huge universe fragment. It was so large that it was comparable to a whole Universe World.

The universe fragment was covered with a layer of darkness, which went to show that Black Ink Strength was abundant. By living in such an environment, the Black Ink Clansmen would see their powers rising quickly.

Yang Kai had lived in the Black Ink Clan’s domain for 2 years and followed the High-Rank Black Ink Clansman he belonged to into many different areas.

However, none of those places was comparable to this universe fragment.

Yang Kai soon realised that this universe fragment was directly owned by Hei Yuan, and the areas occupied by his subordinate Feudal Lords would form the Territory Lord’s territory.

The large ship continued heading towards the universe fragment. As the ship passed through the clouds of Black Ink Strength, it soon hovered above a large city.

The city was so vast that there was no end in sight. In the centre of the city was a gigantic Black Ink Nest that looked like a flower bud that was about to blossom. The Black Ink Nest seemed to be a living creature and every time it breathed, a lot of Black Ink Strength would be released.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes. Although he had seen a lot of Black Ink Nests before, the one before his eyes was undoubtedly the largest. Given enough resources, such a Black Ink Nest would be able to produce many Black Ink Clan soldiers in no time.

Black Ink Nests had always been the foundation that the Black Ink Clan relied on to survive. Black Ink Clansmen were born from the Black Ink Nests, and they also had to achieve breakthroughs inside the Black Ink Nests. If the Black Ink Nests were gone for good, the Black Ink Clan would be like a tree without roots or a river without a source.

For this reason, the Humans always tried to destroy Black Ink Nests so that they could cut the enemy off at its source.

Nevertheless, it wasn’t easy to carry out such plans. There was basically a Black Ink Nest in every Black Ink Clansman’s territory. Zhu Feng even had a small Black Ink Nest in his temporary hiding place.

There wouldn’t be enough Humans to destroy all of these Black Ink Nests, and it wouldn’t be useful if they only destroyed a few of them, for the Black Ink Clan could easily create new Black Ink Nests.

So far, the Humans still hadn’t figured out how the Black Ink Nests were born. Some people speculated that they were built by the Black Ink Clan, but this speculation was not logical because everyone who had seen a Black Ink Nest knew that this thing seemed to have a life of its own. Nothing the Humans had ever built was comparable to these Black Ink Nests.

There were also some people who speculated that the birth of Black Ink Nests was just like growing flowers. With a seed planted in the ground, it would grow into a new Black Ink Nest when it was well taken care of.

If this speculation was right though, what kind of seed was that? Where did it come from?

Obviously, no study could be conducted. Even the Old Ancestors were unable to figure out the secrets behind the Black Ink Nests; therefore, the Humans cast this idea away. Whenever they came across any Black Ink Nests, they would just destroy them.

Regardless, demolishing Black Ink Nests would mean immense losses for the Black Ink Clan.

The large ship directly landed in front of the gigantic Black Ink Nest. Some Black Ink Clansmen were already waiting for them. It was apparent that they had learned about Hei Yuan’s return just now.

Following Zha Gu’s lead, Yang Kai leapt off the deck and stood to the side.

The unfamiliar Human attracted the attention of many Black Ink Clansmen; however, there were already some Black Ink Disciples who resided in this place. Although many Black Ink Clansmen were curious, they soon looked away.

Hei Yuan’s figure appeared on the deck, but instead of leaving the ship, he waved his hand. As Black Ink Strength undulated, he shouted, “Wake up!”

Following his shout, powerful beings inside the large ship’s cabin started awakening.

Yang Kai’s expression changed as he realised that they were the Territory Lords who had been sound asleep in the large ship. Even though these auras were powerful, Yang Kai could feel that they were somewhat frail. It was obvious that they were all severely wounded.

These Territory Lords hadn’t recovered one bit following a long time of deep sleep; therefore, Hei Yuan directly brought them to the Black Ink Nest so that they could make use of its power to recuperate.

A moment later, some burly figures stepped out of the cabin and stood on the deck.

The Black Ink Clansmen below saluted them respectfully.

Yang Kai stole a glance and realised that these Territory Lords were all injured as they were soaked in blood. The most severely wounded one had half of his neck cut. Yang Kai wondered who the Army Commander was that had made such a ruthless move. Black blood was still leaking out of the wound on his neck and there was a mysterious force around the wound that was stopping it from healing.

This Territory Lord was especially unstable and seemed to be muddle-headed. It was as though he would soon lose his life if he wasn’t given immediate treatment.

Including Hei Yuan, there were a total of 6 Territory Lords on the large ship. The 5 Territory Lords who had just awakened nodded at Hei Yuan and silently dashed towards the Black Ink Nest, soon disappearing. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

After they were gone, Hei Yuan swept a glance over the rest, “While I am recuperating, all the affairs in the territory will be handled by Gui Liao.”

One of the Feudal Lords, who had been waiting for Hei Yuan’s return just now, bowed, “Yes.”

There was no doubt that this Feudal Lord was Gui Liao.

Hei Yuan then shuffled towards the Black Ink Nest, but he soon stopped in his tracks and turned his head to speak to Gui Liao, “He’s the new Black Ink Disciple I’ve taken on. Get him a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit later.”

A hint of surprise flashed through Gui Liao’s eyes as he turned to look at Yang Kai.

In fact, he had caught sight of Yang Kai the moment the latter leapt off the deck, but he didn’t pay much attention to him; after all, it wasn’t rare for them to capture Black Ink Disciples on the battlefields.

However, what the Territory Lord had said suggested that he valued this Black Ink Disciple highly. That was why Gui Liao was surprised.

It had to be noted that most of the Black Ink Disciples had suffered some damage in their Small Universes, so Profound Yin Spirit Fruits were needed in order to repair them.

Even though the Black Ink Clan had some reserves of Profound Yin Spirit Fruits, they were not rewards that could be given out easily.
