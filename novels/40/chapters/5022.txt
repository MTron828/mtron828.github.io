“Take him back and let him recuperate!” Cha Hu commanded.

Obeying his order, Feng Ying carried Yang Kai and returned to Dawning Light, placing him down in a quiet room in the ship’s cabin.

On the other side, the two Territory Lords who were fighting with Xie Xiu Ping and Lu An had similarly seen how their comrade had died at Cha Hu’s hands and were both shocked. How could they dare to linger here any longer? Both of them made a feint and then retreated.

Xie Xiu Ping and Lu An followed closely behind them. Despite knowing that there was no way there was anything they could do if the Territory Lords were fully intent on escaping, they still gave chase.

By the time Cha Hu finished checking Yang Kai’s condition and wanted to head over to provide support for Xiu Xiu Ping and Lu An, the two Eighth-Order Masters and the two Territory Lords were already nowhere to be seen.

Cha Hu coldly snorted before turning his gaze to the chaotic battlefield. Like a bolt of lightning, he charged straight in.

The Black Ink Clan Army was already on the verge of defeat and would not have held on much longer even without Cha Hu’s intervention, but now that an Eighth-Order Division Commander had joined the battle, how could they ever hope to hold on?

A large number of Black Ink Clansmen were killed, but a small number of them scattered when they saw that the odds were against them and escaped. After all, even the Territory Lords ran. Staying behind would only mean death for them.

Cha Hu led a chase after the enemy for half a day, killing some of them before returning.

And so the battle came to an end. On each Warship, the Human soldiers looked around at the severed limbs and remains of the Black Ink Clansmen scattered all over the void. Even though the Humans had sustained a lot of damage to their Warships and even lost over 100 Open Heaven Realm warriors, their casualties were almost negligible when compared to the Black Ink Clan’s losses.

This battle was a great victory for the Humans.

Cheers rang out as the Humans celebrated.

For Blue Sky Pass, this victory meant that Blue Sky Pass had finally secured this resource harvesting area, and for the next several dozen years they would be able to mine it in peace.

This victory had not come easy and many of them had spilled blood in order to achieve this result.

The battlefield was cleared up and the casualties were counted. Then, under the leadership of the Eighth-Order Masters, the Warships all headed back to the forward base.

By the time Yang Kai regained consciousness, several days had passed. When he opened his eyes, he could feel pain intense enough to cause him to sweat all over with just the slightest movement. His five viscera and six organs felt as if they were on fire.

“The Squad Leader is awake, go and inform the Division Commanders,” a voice could be heard saying. When he looked over, a familiar figure was reflected in Yang Kai’s hazy eyes.

When his vision cleared up, Yang Kai realized that it was Feng Ying.

With eyes full of concern and joy, Feng Ying asked anxiously, “Squad Leader, how do you feel?”

Yang Kai made a quick scan of his own condition before his brow furrowed and he asked, “Who are you?”

Feng Ying’s face paled instantly, “Squad Leader, it’s me, Feng Ying. Do you not recognize me?”

Yang Kai stared at her for a moment as if he were looking at a stranger.

Feng Ying was really panicking now. While she was at a loss as to what to do though, Yang Kai suddenly grinned, “I’m kidding, don’t take it too seriously.”

Feng Ying was stunned at first, but then she glared at him menacingly.

It was then that someone opened the door and entered. Cha Hu’s voice rang out, “Has Yang Boy awoken?” He had obviously rushed over as soon as he heard the news.

Yang Kai struggled to get up, but Cha Hu pressed him back down with his hand, “Your injuries are not light so you better lie still. How do you feel?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Feng Ying snorted before answering in a disgruntled tone, “He should be fine. He even has the strength to joke around with me.”

Puzzled, Cha Hu pressed his hand on Yang Kai’s wrist and scanned his body. After a while, he retracted his hand and said with some surprise, “As expected of someone with a Dragon Vein. Your vitality is as strong as expected.”

In fact, Yang Kai’s vitality had been faint, almost nonexistent, when he received the fierce blow from the Territory Lord that injured him so badly that he fell unconscious. He was in a state that was not far away from death.

If any other Seventh-Order Master were to sustain such injuries, there would have been at least a 70% chance that they would not have survived.

Yet, after just a few days, Yang Kai’s vitality was stronger and he had regained consciousness. Even though his aura was still weak, there was no longer any threat to his life.

Cha Hu had to sigh in admiration that sure enough, the restorative abilities of someone with a potent Dragon Vein were uniquely powerful, thinking to himself that as long as this boy did not suffer any immediately fatal injuries, then he would be able to recover back to health quickly.

“Division Commander Cha, how is the battle going?” Yang Kai asked with concern, his memory having cut off when he was attacking the fleeing Territory Lord. He had no idea what happened after that.

Cha Hu explained, “The Black Ink Clan only had four Territory Lords in this region. Zhu Feng was killed by you and Bai Yi, and on the battlefield several days ago, I killed another with your and Bai Yi’s help, so there were only two Territory Lords left. What other outcome could there be? They all fled after that, and we had almost annihilated all of the Black Ink Clansmen that were left. We won.”

Yang Kai breathed a sigh of relief, “That’s good to hear.”

Even though he had expected this result, it was still heartening to hear it with his own ears.

Cha Hu was silent for a moment before he said, “Yang Kai, I know you’re confident in your strength, but confident people often become conceited and make mistakes. You were lucky this time, but what about the next? Right now, you are a Squad Leader, and your choices affect more than your own personal safety. Oftentimes, you’ll find that your entire Squad’s lives are on the line, too, so do remember to be more careful in the future.”

“I will take that to heart,” Yang Kai accepted his criticism with an open mind.

Cha Hu did not care whether or not Yang Kai really accepted what he said either, he just patted his shoulder, “Rest well. We have already taken the resource harvesting area under our control so there won’t be any more major battles for the next few decades. Build up your strength as soon as possible so that you can kill even more of the Black Ink Clan in the future.”

“Yes!”

As soon as Cha Hu left, a large group of people crowded in from the outside, all of them with smiles on their faces, naturally it was Dawn Squad’s members.

Yang Kai swept a glance over them and discovered that besides him, there were 35 people, no more and no less, packing the relatively small room to the brim, and only then did he feel relieved.

During the previous battle with the Black Ink Clan, he had witnessed the ships of a number of Squads being blown apart. And, once one was without the shelter of their Warship, those under the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm would find it difficult to survive in such a chaotic melee. The Sixth-Order Masters fared slightly better, but if the Fifth-Order Masters did not promptly receive the help of nearby Squads, they would barely be able to hold out for a dozen breaths before dying.

Dawn’s Battleship was different of course. Dawning Light was much more powerful and sturdy than average, so there was no risk of it being destroyed in a battle like that. So, all of the Squad members were still fit and well.

However, it was inevitable that they would still suffer some minor injuries, especially Shen Ao and the other Seventh-Order Masters who went out to fight against the Black Ink Clan, all of whom were in different states of injury.

Dawn had been instrumental in the previous fight, especially during the killing of the Territory Lord at the end. It was Bai Yi and Yang Kai’s two strikes that enabled Cha Hu to deliver the killing blow.

The other Squads were all envious of such an achievement, yet they were unable to emulate it; after all, not every Seventh-Order Master had the same capabilities as those two.

Seeing the concerned eyes of everyone, Yang Kai reassured them, “I’m fine, I just need to rest for some time. Everyone should go and recuperate, too.”

The crowd then dispersed, leaving only Feng Ying behind.

Yang Kai looked at her and asked, “There’s a smile on Senior Sister’s lips. Has something good happened?”

Feng Ying could not help but laugh, “You could tell?”

“So, there is something good?” Yang Kai was stunned.

Feng Ying nodded, “Dawn contributed greatly in the last battle, so the Division Commanders have decided to award us with one of the most resource-rich harvesting points for us to freely mine. We can head there as soon as we finish recuperating.”

Yang Kai understood, “So, that’s how it is.”

The last battle was fought for control over a resource harvesting area, and since the Humans won, this stretch of territory naturally belonged to the Humans.

Now that the battle was over, the only thing left to do was to mine the resources, so it was natural that they had to determine which Squad was going to be mining which area. They could not just wander around randomly and snatch resources from each other.

In this way, the resources harvested by Dawn could also be handed over to Blue Sky Pass to be exchanged for Military Merits.

“The Division Commanders are thoughtful,” Yang Kai said.

“Rest well, Squad Leader. We will depart once you have recovered.”

“En!” Yang Kai had no objection.

After ten days, Yang Kai had mostly recovered, and the other Squad members were also basically done with healing themselves.

Yang Kai first went to Xu Bo Liang who was standing guard over the forward base to report in before leading Dawn towards the area that was allocated to them.

The area allocated to Dawn was about three days away from the forward base. Even though it was slightly far, it was rich in resources. As long as they concentrate on mining, then they would surely be able to accumulate a large batch of materials over the next several dozen years.

Patrols were of course still being made, as even though the Black Ink Clan was defeated in the last battle, there was no guarantee that there weren’t any fish that had slipped past the nets who would come to cause trouble.

Fortunately, their journey was uneventful. After suffering such a devastating defeat, it seemed that the Black Ink Clan really had completely pulled out of this resource-harvesting area.

Two days later, Yang Kai checked their location on the Universe Chart in his hand while standing on the deck, making sure that this was indeed the area allocated to Dawn before ordering Dawning Light to stop.

Standing on the deck, he looked up and saw a few dozen land masses of varying sizes in the void, each one of them a Universe World of their own.

If these Universe Worlds were in the 3,000 Worlds, this would definitely be a bustling place; however, this was the Black Ink Battlefield, and the Black Ink Clan consumed World Force as their food. The World Force of all Universe Worlds had already been sapped dry by the Black Ink Clan, and that was why all of these Universe Worlds were in shambles without a hint of vitality to be seen.

Even though there were no living beings here, and any World Force was also non-existent, the various resources born in these Universe Worlds were preserved after their death.

What the Human cultivators needed to do was to retrieve these resources from these dead Universe Worlds.

It was not only the Humans that were doing this though, but also the Black Ink Clan when they occupied the resource harvesting areas. They needed the resources to provide energy for the Black Ink Nests to breed more clansmen and produce more Black Ink Strength.

“This is an abundant place, as expected!” Yang Kai exclaimed in awe as he looked at the scene ahead.

Several dozen Universe Worlds sat before his eyes, and the resources contained in them would naturally not be few.
