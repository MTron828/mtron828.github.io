The person inside the palanquin was the star of the day, while the four Great Dragons that had appeared earlier were just the escorts.

Two Dragon girls were flying alongside the palanquin. One of them was Fu Ling, whose purple hair fluttered in the air. She was supposed to be guarding Dragon Blood Flowers, but since this was Fu Chi’s wedding day, she was summoned back to accompany the bride. There was nothing special about the other Dragon girl. Besides her outstanding beauty, she appeared just like any Human.

The two girls stood on either side of the palanquin with flower baskets in their hands. While they were coming over in the air, the flowers flew out of the baskets, which formed a splendid rainbow rain. The sight was stunning. It was no ordinary flower rain as flowers of all colours wafted through the air and dazzled the spectators.

This sight alone was eye-catching enough as the crowd thought that the Dragon Clan was indeed rich enough to employ different gimmicks in a wedding. No other clans in this world had the resources to do such things.

In just a short moment, the palanquin arrived at the palace. Those four Dragons stopped coming near as they hovered several dozen meters away from the palace. All the spectators shifted their attention to the palanquin. Fu Chi naturally was smiling.

This was a joyous event for Fu Chi because the Dragon girl inside the palanquin would be his on this day. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

*Shua Shua Shua…*

Right then, three figures appeared all of a sudden. The first person was a thin elderly man with red hair who appeared authoritative even though his expression was calm. There was no aura wafting from his body, but everyone could feel the sense of pressure he gave off. The kind of unspeakable pressure was much greater than those exuded from the four Great Dragons, who were still in their true forms.

Beside the elderly man was a silver-haired woman in an imperial dress with a cold expression. The aura wafting from her body sent chills down all of their spines. After taking a brief look at her, they hurriedly looked away as though they were afraid that they would be frozen if they kept looking.

The last person was a man who appeared to be between middle-aged and young. With a gentle smile on his face, he was standing there in an elegant manner.

Upon these people’s appearance, Fu Chi and the others turned solemn and bowed slightly, “Welcome, Elders!”

Dragon Clan members were only arrogant in front of other races. Faced with the Masters of the same race, they had to hang their heads low no matter how haughty they were.

Upon hearing how Fu Chi and the others addressed those three, the expressions on all 300 Human cultivators’ faces changed slightly as they lowered their heads and exclaimed in their hearts. [So, these are the Dragon Clan’s Three Elders! The Great Elder, Zhu Yan; the Second Elder, Fu Zhun, and the Fourth Elder, Zhu Kong!]

These three were the greatest authority on Dragon Island, especially the Great Elder and the Second Elder, who were both Tenth-Order Dragons. Basically, no one was a match for them on Dragon Island.

On the other hand, although Zhu Kong wasn’t a Tenth-Order Dragon, he was a Ninth-Order, so most Dragon Clan members were inferior to him as well.

It was said that there were four Elders on Dragon Island in the past. The Third-Elder was also a Ninth-Order Dragon, but for some reason, she didn’t attend the wedding on this day.

Nevertheless, this kind of secret was inaccessible to ordinary people. These 300 cultivators had always lived in Half-Dragon City, so they were not familiar with the internal affairs of Dragon Island.

At that moment, more than ten Dragon Clan members had gathered outside the palace. It could be said that all of the most powerful people on Dragon Island had gathered together. Besides a grand wedding that would happen roughly once every ten thousand years, it was rare for so many Dragon Clan members to appear in one place.

Zhu Yan’s expression was as calm as a still lake, while Fu Zhun’s expression remained eternally cold. Neither of them uttered a word. The only Elder with a smiling face was Zhu Kong, who nodded at Fu Chi and acknowledged, “Congratulations.”

Fu Chi replied respectfully, “Many thanks to all the Elders for attending. I shall always remember this day.”

Zhu Kong uttered, “After the wedding, both of you should treat each other politely and achieve lasting happiness.”

Fu Chi hurriedly replied, “Fourth Elder, please rest assured. I shall never mistreat Qing’er. We’ll give birth to a Dragon child quickly to sustain the bloodline.”

Zhu Kong smiled without saying anything.

With a frown, Fu Zhun ordered, “Enough nonsense. Help Zhu Qing out of the palanquin now.”

After receiving her order, all the Dragons wouldn’t dare to disobey her. The four Dragons separated to both sides in front of the palanquin, while Fu Ling and the other Dragon girl pulled the gauze open and said gently, “Big Sister Qing, it’s time to get out.”

Nevertheless, Zhu Qing remained seated in the palanquin.

Meekly, Fu Ling took a look at the Second Elder. Seeing that her expression was getting colder, Fu Ling persuaded Zhu Qing to get out, but to no avail. Her forehead became beaded with sweat because she was anxious.

Certainly, she knew that Zhu Qing wasn’t willing to marry Fu Chi. In fact, everyone on Dragon Island knew this. However, all the Elders were there, so it wasn’t up to Zhu Qing to refuse the wedding. If this matter wasn’t handled properly, the Dragon Clan would become the laughing stock for others.

The smile on Fu Chi’s face faded as he felt embarrassed.

On the other hand, Fu Zhun’s expression turned grim as she shot a glance at Zhu Yan, who had lowered his gaze and appeared unfazed.

Fu Zhun snorted in her heart, but just as she was preparing to drag Zhu Qing out of the palanquin herself, a figure flashed across her eyes.

All of a sudden, a young man appeared in front of the palanquin. Most people couldn’t see clearly how he appeared out of nowhere with only the Elders narrowing their eyes as they shifted their attention to him.

With a frown, Fu Zhun ordered, “Get him out of here!”

[What’s going on with this man? How could he jump out of nowhere and stand in front of the palanquin? Is he tired of living?]

Under normal circumstances, Fu Zhun would have killed him directly, but since it was Fu Chi’s wedding day, she didn’t want to see blood. That was why she suppressed her anger.

Just then, a loud Dragon Roar was heard, upon which a 200 meter long Red Dragon curled up its body and surrounded the palanquin. With its head held high, it narrowed its eyes and swept them across the crowd. After going into a protective posture, it blocked out the other three Dragons.

“Zhu Lie, what are you doing?” Fu Qi frowned and gazed at the Red Dragon which was clearly shielding the palanquin.

Opening his mouth, Zhu Lie spoke loudly, “I’m not doing anything. I just hope that all of you can wait a moment!”

Zhu Yan, who had been indifferent the entire time, finally raised his gaze, and upon seeing the figure that had arrived before the palanquin, he couldn’t help raising his brow.

On the other hand, disbelief was written all over Zhu Kong’s face. Although he had incredible cultivation, he was still stunned at the sight.

Standing in front of everyone, Yang Kai drew a deep breath and took a look at the woman in the palanquin whose head was covered with a red veil. After that, he extended his hand and said with a smile, “I’m here to fetch you.”

Upon hearing that, everyone broke into a commotion. All 300 Human cultivators stared at Yang Kai in shock as they lamented in their hearts, [What on Earth is he doing? How could he be so impudent in front of the whole Dragon Clan? He even said such a thing to a Dragon girl who was about to get married! He must be out of his mind!]

If such a thing happened in Human occupied territory, it basically meant that the man was trying to snatch the bride; however, they were now on Dragon Island, and it was the wedding day for two Dragon Clan members! This man must have gone mad. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have attempted to snatch the Dragon Clan’s bride!

The expressions of all Dragon Clan members turned stiff. Apparently, they were still reeling from the shock while Fu Chi was even worse off, as he still couldn’t fathom what was going on. Nevertheless, the next moment, his expression turned livid.

It was because after that Human finished his words, Zhu Qing, who hadn’t been willing to get out just now, shuddered and pulled the red veil on her head away. With disbelief written all over her face, she stared at that man and spoke in a shaking voice, “What are you doing here?”

She couldn’t believe her eyes, as she had never expected that Yang Kai would appear right in front of her at this very moment.

Gazing at the face she had been longing for every day, for a moment, she thought that she was dreaming. However, the man before her eyes seemed real, and his familiar aura suggested that this wasn’t a dream.

Yang Kai had really come to save her.

He appeared in front of all the Dragon Clan members fearlessly on a day that was supposed to be the most despair filled day of her life. The man before her eyes was just like the sun that had cast away the haze in her heart.

“Of course, I’m here to fetch you.” Yang Kai blinked at her.

With her eyes turning moist, Zhu Qing shook her head, “You shouldn’t have come.”

She was over the moon, but at the same time, she was worried about Yang Kai’s safety. If Yang Kai hadn’t come on this day, she would’ve been the only one who would suffer, but now that he was here, there was no way he could escape.

The Dragon Clan could never tolerate any form of humiliation. After this day, Yang Kai would become an enemy of the Dragon Clan. He didn’t even stand a chance of leaving this place alive.

“Is that so…” Yang Kai lowered his head and gave it a thought. Following that, he withdrew his hand and turned around, “Then I’ll take my leave now.”

“Don’t you dare!” Flustered, Zhu Qing stood up straight and pounced at him, grabbing his arm as she stared at him with widened eyes, “Don’t even think about leaving me behind!”

Yang Kai put on a grin, “It seems that you’re not willing to marry him. I’m relieved, then.”

As Zhu Qing wrapped her arm around his, her gaze turned dim as she muttered, “We’ll both die.”

“We already have a lot of happy memories together. Even if we have to die, we’ll die together. That’s not necessarily a bad thing.”

With her eyes welling up with tears, Zhu Qing snuggled up to him. In just a short moment, she managed to come round to the idea that since Yang Kai had come, it would be unrealistic to tell him to leave now. The only thing she could do now was face the Dragon Clan’s wrath with him.

Having made up her mind, she turned to look at her fellow clansmen, only to see how astounded they were.

There were not many things in this world that would shock a Dragon, but the incident on this day certainly counted as one of them. No one would have thought that someone had the guts to snatch a Dragon Clan bride, much less a mere Human. Moreover, Zhu Qing appeared very intimate with that Human.

At that instant, all the Dragon Clan members were dumbfounded, not to mention those Humans and Monsters whose jaws almost dropped to the ground.

Among the 300 cultivators, some of them were resentful of Yang Kai because, compared to how hardworking they were in the past month, Yang Kai didn’t contribute anything, which left them quite disgruntled. It wasn’t until this moment that they realized how bold Yang Kai was. They wondered how he could be so brazen, even having the guts to snatch the Dragon Clan’s bride. Compared to his action on this day, his loafing in the construction of the palace wasn’t even worth mentioning.

The world was never short of amazing events, but the incident on this day had really expanded their horizons.

At that moment, Fu Chi’s expression was grim. His bride was now linking arms with another man whom she appeared to be deeply in love with. Furthermore, they said that it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing for them to die together, which put Fu Chi in an embarrassing situation. After this incident, no matter how the problem was solved in the end, his reputation would be ruined.

Earlier, when Zhu Qing wasn’t willing to get out of the palanquin upon Fu Ling’s persuasion, it was already a huge embarrassment for him. On the contrary, Zhu Qing was willing to step out of the palanquin upon hearing that man’s words.
