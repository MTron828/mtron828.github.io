Upon a closer look, they were all shocked because the young man at the front was playfully looking at them.

Seeing that, all of them gasped. [How is that possible?]

They must have passed through the Void Corridor to go from a Star Field to the Ancestral Domain. The journey was extremely long, so it always caused some side effects for those who took it. The most notable effect was dizziness and discomfort in one’s Soul.

The time these drawbacks would last depended on their cultivation. If they were strong, then it would only take them a short time to recover. However, if they were weak, they would need a longer time.

Nevertheless, judging from the young man’s composure, he wasn’t suffering from any drawbacks at all.

[What’s going on?] All of them were dumbfounded.

Their expression turned weird after they scanned him with Divine Sense, because there were no aura fluctuations around him. If he was a cultivator, it was impossible that they couldn’t detect any aura from him. It was either because there was a huge gap between their cultivations, so the weaker one couldn’t sense it, or that he was using an artifact that concealed his cultivation.

However, it was unlikely that a cultivator coming from a Star Field would possess such an amazing artifact, and it was impossible that all of them couldn’t see through him.

[He’s such a strange guy.]

A moment later, He Yun Xiang and Yan Luo managed to pull themselves together. Upon seeing the sight around her, she turned pale as she hurriedly activated her Saint Qi and looked around vigilantly.

She had never expected that she would come across this situation right after she stepped into the Ancestral Domain. Moreover, the cultivation of all these cultivators around her was above Origin King Realm. Some of them even exuded an aura that horrified her.

[They’re all above the Origin King Realm! This is the aura specific to the realm that is above the Origin King Realm. It must be the Dao Source Realm that Sir had told me before. Have we reached the Ancestral Domain? If we haven’t, then why are there so many people in a realm above the Origin King Realm here? Why are they blocking our way? Are they going to rob us? However, we’re just cultivators from a Lower Star Field, so our possessions are probably not valuable to them. We’re not on the same level, so what’s the point of them snatching stuff from people who are in a lower realm?]

While she was vigilant, Yan Luo suddenly started moving and heading in a particular direction.

Seeing that, He Yun Xiang was stunned, while Yang Kai stared at him with narrowed eyes.

There were three people in the direction Yan Luo was moving, two men and one woman, standing on a small hill nearby. The young man at the front appeared handsome and carefree, and his aura was profound. The woman beside him, who appeared to be in her late twenties, was smiling elegantly. The last person was an old man who, despite his grey hair, had skin as smooth as that of a baby and a radiant glow on his face.

With an agitated expression, Yan Luo shuffled towards the hill and fell on one knee before uttering in a trembling voice, “Greetings, Old Ancestor! It has been many years since we last met!”

He Yun Xiang’s expression changed when she heard that, and she gazed dazedly at the old man. An idea flashed across her mind, upon which she realised who the old man was.

It was rumoured that an Old Ancestor from the Yan Family had embarked on a journey to the Ancestral Domain 500 years ago, but no one knew whether he had succeeded. Upon hearing how Yan Luo addressed the old man, she immediately figured out his identity.

He was the Yan Family’s Old Ancestor who had left Unending Star Field 500 years ago, Yan Ren Hao!

At that instant, He Yun Xiang felt that something was amiss. Yan Ren Hao was already the strongest Master in Unending Star Field 500 years ago, as he was at the top of Third-Order Origin King Realm. 500 years had passed, and he had been cultivating in the Ancestral Domain, so he must have reached a realm that was above Origin King Realm.

[It’s a trap! No wonder Yan Luo agreed to bring Yang Kai to the Ancestral Domain and wanted to tag along! It is because he knew that the Yan Family’s Old Ancestor would be waiting here.]

She wasn’t sure how the Yan Family members managed to contact Yan Ren Hao, but it was impossible that this old man would coincidentally appear in this place. Apparently, after they left Taiyi Star, someone from the Yan Family managed to send a message to their Old Ancestor.

Yan Ren Hao must be waiting in this place to receive Yan Luo.

[Damn it! Sir’s cultivation is indeed powerful, so he isn’t afraid of the Yan Family members on Taiyi Star, but is he a match for Yan Ren Hao? Moreover, Yan Ren Hao has two helpers with him. The woman is just a Third-Order Origin King Realm, so I can probably deal with her; however, that young man gives off a feeling that he’s even stronger than Yan Ren Hao. Can Sir defeat him?]

He Yun Xiang had thought about a lot of things in just a short moment. With a dark expression, she turned to look at Yang Kai, but seeing that he appeared calm and collected, she couldn’t help but be startled.

“Wonderful!” Yan Ren Hao guffawed as he stepped forward and helped Yan Luo up. After examining him, he clapped his shoulder and complimented him, “Very good indeed!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Naturally, he was glad that a Yan Family descendant had managed to come here. After him, no Yan Family members had managed to reach the Ancestral Domain. Although his power had increased significantly in this world, he was less carefree than when he was in Unending Star Field. So, he was very pleased with Yan Luo’s arrival. With the two of them working together, they might extend the Yan Family’s legacy in the Ancestral Domain.

“It is good that Old Ancestor is well as well,” Yan Luo said excitedly, “Your cultivation…”

Yan Ren Hao chuckled and waved his hand, “Let’s not talk about cultivation now. Come, let me introduce you to a Master.” He placed his hand on Yan Luo’s shoulder and brought him to meet the young man. Then, he introduced him, “This is my Senior Brother in Azure Sea Palace, Duan Mu Qi. Just call him Martial Uncle Duan Mu.”

“Azure Sea Palace…” When Yan Luo heard that, a glint flashed across his eyes as he fell into deep thought.

Although they could contact the Old Ancestor, they couldn’t communicate with him for a long time. In fact, they had only contacted him once 500 years ago. Therefore, they had no idea how Yan Ren Hao had been doing in the Ancestral Domain.

Upon that introduction, Yan Luo immediately understood that Yan Ren Hao had joined a great force called Azure Sea Palace in the Ancestral Domain. Moreover, judging from his attitude, he appeared respectful towards this man called Duan Mu Qi.

Yan Luo was very old himself, and he definitely looked much older than Duan Mu Qi. However, a cultivator could only command respect with his strength, not his age. Since Yan Luo’s cultivation was weaker than that of this young man, he had no choice but to be humble.

Not daring to appear disrespectful, he immediately bowed and said, “Junior Yan Luo of the Yan Family greets Martial Uncle Duan Mu!”

With a faint smile, Duan Mu Qi nodded his head, “Martial Nephew, you don’t have to be too formal with me. We’ll be one family from now on.”

Yan Ren Hao uttered, “Your Martial Uncle is one of the top ten cultivators in Azure Sea Palace. It was thanks to his recommendation in the past that I was able to join Azure Sea Palace. You’ll have to ask for more guidance from him in the future.”

“Yes.” Yan Luo straightened his face.

“This is your Martial Aunt, Chen Chui Ling,” Yan Ren Hao pointed at the woman and said.

Yan Luo thought to himself that the woman was just a Third-Order Origin King, which was the same as his own cultivation realm. If they got into a fight, it would be hard to tell who the winner would be. So, why was this woman now considered his Senior? He was basically the Overlord of Unending Star Field who stood above all others, so he had never been so humble to someone else before. Nevertheless, upon seeing how intimate she was with Duan Mu Qi, he immediately understood the reason behind it. So, he also bowed to her and greeted, “Greetings, Martial Aunt Chen.”

Chen Chui Ling replied with a smile, “Martial Nephew, you don’t have to be so formal with me either; after all, you are Senior Brother Yan’s Junior. After you join Azure Sea Palace, I’ll definitely take care of you. I haven’t managed to prepare anything for our first meeting, so just take this bottle of pills. They will be useful for your cultivation.”

“Uh…” Although Yan Luo was tempted, he felt embarrassed to take something from her since this was their first meeting. So, he turned to look at his Old Ancestor to ask for his opinion.

Yan Ren Hao uttered, “Your Martial Aunt is an Alchemist and these pills were all refined by her personally. Since she has offered them to you, just take them.”

“Many thanks, Martial Aunt Chen!” Yan Luo hurriedly thanked her and took the bottle with both hands as his heart was filled with excitement. He thought that it was the right decision to come to the Ancestral Domain, as he had obtained a bottle of pills not long after he arrived here. He wasn’t sure about the grade of the pills or their medicinal efficacies, but since they were made in the Ancestral Domain, they would undoubtedly be treasures to the current him.

As the other cultivators listened to their conversation, they realised the relationship between them. At that instant, they sighed secretly, knowing that they couldn’t snatch these people from Azure Sea Palace.

[His Old Ancestor belongs to Azure Sea Palace, so he’ll definitely join the same Sect as well. There’s no way he’ll choose to join another Sect. As for the two people with that Yan Luo fellow, they must be from the same Star Field.]

Upon learning about their relationship, they knew that these people wouldn’t consider other options, so they had lost interest in luring them in.

Normally, cultivators from the same Star Field would stick together, unless there were some grudges between them.

However, if they loathed each other, it was impossible that they would come to the Ancestral Domain together.

After these people from Azure Sea Palace were done with their small talk, Yan Ren Hao traded glances with Yan Luo before he pushed his Divine Sense.

The next moment, he looked at Yang Kai and He Yun Xiang with a smile before he uttered, “Since both of you have come with Yan Luo, why don’t you follow me to my Sect?”

There were too many people around this place. Even though he had intended to deal with Yang Kai, he wouldn’t choose to make a move in this place. Otherwise, the other great forces might find fault with him and criticize him. However, once they left this place and returned to Azure Sea Palace, he could do whatever he wanted to Yang Kai.

[Since you’ve dared to kill my family’s Elder and damaged our foundation, I’ll never let you off! Do you think you can do whatever you want because you have some meagre strength? You’re indeed just a frog at the bottom of the well, so don’t even think about leaping out of it for the rest of your life. However, I must make them follow me to Azure Sea Palace first…]

With a smile, Yan Luo added in, “Brother Yang, let’s go. It’s thanks to you that I’ve managed to come to the Ancestral Domain safely. Please give me a chance to repay you for this favour.”

He no longer appeared obsequious and cautious. His Old Ancestor was right behind him, and he had the support of Duan Mu Qi, so he wasn’t afraid of Yang Kai anymore. It was apparent to him that no matter how formidable Yang Kai was, it wasn’t possible that he could be stronger than his Old Ancestor and Duan Mu Qi.

[You oppressed us in the Yan Residence some time ago. Now, the situation is different, so I’ll let you have a taste of your own medicine.]

With a gloomy expression, He Yun Xiang glowered at Yan Luo.

Although what happened to the Yan Family was within Yang Kai’s calculations, the Yan Family members only had themselves to blame. If they had agreed to her initial suggestion, she believed that Yang Kai wouldn’t have treated them poorly. Instead, he would have rewarded them handsomely. However, those in the Yan Family were too arrogant and made the wrong decision, so they couldn’t blame others for their misfortunes.

Furthermore, Yang Kai had the power to destroy the Yan Family entirely, but he didn’t choose to do that. Unfortunately, as a result, he had fallen into the Yan Family’s trap in the end. Now that Yan Luo had someone supporting him, he appeared smug and haughty, which made He Yun Xiang despise him even more than before.
