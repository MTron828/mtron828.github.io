As soon as the words left Yang Kai’s mouth, several Ancient Barbarian Race Warriors immediately turned around with their stone spears and stone axes at the ready, watching him warily as a chill ran down their spines.

Although they had been concerned about the safety of their companion just now, they had remained alert of their surroundings. Even so, none of them had noticed anybody approaching them from behind. This was simply inconceivable. If this young man had malicious intentions, they would have all died by now; after all, this person was a Shaman Warrior!

The woman who seemed to be a Shaman shuddered slightly, but her reaction was not as intense as the rest of the Ancient Barbarian Race Warriors. She turned around and gestured with her hands to signal her companions not to be so nervous. Following that, she said, “I know he is poisoned. I’ve also been using the Detoxification Spell.”

“It’s not working,” Yang Kai tilted his head and looked at her. Pondering for a moment before asking, “Do you want me to help?”

“You?” She frowned with a look of distrust in her eyes. The Shaman Warrior in front of her was a stranger after all, who knows whether he was a good person or not? It was normal for disputes to occur between Shamans of different clans; even different villages. Besides, this boy seemed to only be a Low-Rank Shaman Warrior, so if even she, a High-Rank Shaman Warrior, was helpless, what abilities could he have to solve this issue?

Yang Kai simply shrugged and said, “I was just asking.”

“Which clan are you from?” The woman asked.

To which Yang Kai replied, “The South Barbarian Clan!” Pausing for a moment, he added, “You are from the Frost and Snow Clan, right?”

It was all thanks to the Village Chief cramming knowledge into his head before he left that Yang Kai could recognize the origins of these people. In this ancient world, some of the Ancient Barbarian Clans had distinct characteristics to tell them apart. For example, the people of the Raging Flame Clan had a tattoo of a burning flower drawn across their faces. That was the Green Lotus Sacred Flame, the emblem of the Raging Flame Clan.

Although the Frost and Snow Clan did not have any tattoos on their faces, the attribute shown when the woman cast her Shamanic Spell just now gave Yang Kai a clue. Not every Ancient Barbarian Clan had such distinct characteristics. For example, the South Barbarian Clan to which the Blue South Village belonged to, did not have such characteristics. That was why the woman failed to recognize his origins.

Having no intention of concealing her origins now that Yang Kai had seen through her, she nodded, “That’s right. We are from the Frost and Snow Clan. Can you detoxify him?”

“I can try.”

She furrowed her eyebrows in response. Although she did not believe this boy had the ability to do so, it couldn’t hurt to try everything at their disposal. She had used her Shamanic Spell to suppress her poisoned clansman’s wounds and cast a Detoxification Spell to remove the poison in his body; unfortunately, she could not remove the poison completely. The Bone Melting Poison of the Bone Melting Wolf was so strong that any remnant of the poison was enough to turn the strongest Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior into a puddle in time. If it was left alone, her clansman would die within three days, at the most! However, three days was not enough time for them to return to their clan.

“Please try!” She stepped aside.

Yang Kai stepped forward, only to be stopped by a warrior from the Frost and Snow Clan, “Madame…”

The woman raised her hand and stopped that man from continuing his sentence. Even so, the looks in the eyes of those Ancient Barbarian Race Warriors as they stared at Yang Kai were filled with obvious distrust.

Fortunately, Yang Kai was not bothered by their stares and walked straight to the injured Frost and Snow Clan clansman and crouched down. Studying the wounds carefully, he was secretly impressed. The injured man was only able to remain alert and silent despite losing an arm and being affected by a strong poison by virtue of his strong body and robust vitality. Otherwise, his wounds would have killed him ten times over by now. At the moment, his face was pale and slightly distorted because of the pain.

Yang Kai examined the injured man for a while, then he suddenly raised his hand and abruptly hit the Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior’s body several times. The strength of his hits was neither heavy nor light as his Qi surged into the warrior’s body. After several strikes, the Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior’s pale complexion flushed all of a sudden and he opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of black blood.

Yang Kai had been prepared, so he shifted out of the way. After that, he broke the ice that was sealing the wounds on that man’s broken arm without hesitation. Using both hands to grab that man by the shoulders, he pushed his Qi into the man’s body.

Under the watchful gazes of the Frost and Snow Clan clansmen, the body of that injured man suddenly shuddered violently. Following that, a roar rang out, one that sounded like the roar of an injured beast, guttural and terrifying. In the next moment, a large amount of blood spurted out of the broken arm. When the blood hit the ground, it melted several holes into the rock with hissing noises, illustrating just how powerful the poison was.

Blood spurted out without stopping for approximately three breaths. During this process, the rest of the Ancient Barbarian Race Warrior from the Frost and Snow Clan would have rushed forward to stop Yang Kai if not for the female Shaman Warrior holding them back.

Three breaths later, Yang Kai stopped, turned to the woman, and said, “Seal his wounds.”

When the woman heard those words, she raised her hand and a rush of icy air flowed towards the arm’s stump, freezing the wound in the blink of an eye.

The injured Ancient Barbarian Warrior was as pale as a sheet due to extensive blood loss, and the aura coming from his body was so weak that it could barely be detected; almost as if he was dead.

Once this was finished, Yang Kai stood up and took several steps back. The other Frost and Snow Warriors immediately rushed forward to check on the condition of their injured clansman. A moment later, one of the clansmen lifted his head and said, “He seems to be much better. It’s just that he lost too much blood.” Glancing at Yang Kai, his gaze became a little conflicted.

Only then did the female Shaman Warrior nod and turn to Yang Kai, “My name is Yu. What is your name?”

“Ah Niu!” Yang Kai replied with a smile.

“So, you are called Shaman Niu. I thank the Barbarian Gods for letting us meet here!” Yu, who had been cold all this while, finally revealed a smile.

Yang Kai simply waved his hand and said, “The poison has been removed from your companion, but it will still be bad if you just leave him alone. It’s best if you bring him back to your settlement for further treatment.”

“I understand. Please wait for a moment, Shaman Niu,” While Yu was speaking, she walked over to the other Warriors and issued some instructions to them in a low voice. After that, one of them picked up their injured companion and carried him out of the cave. From the looks of it, they seem to be bringing him back to their village for treatment.

Turning around again, Yu asked another one of the Ancient Barbarian Race Warriors to bring out some dried meat and water. Then, she personally handed them to Yang Kai, “This is as thanks for saving my clansman.”

“The Ancient Barbarian Race is all one family. You don’t need to be so polite, Shaman Yu,” Yang Kai grinned. Even so, he did not refuse her offer, accepting the dried meat and water from her before he began to eat heartily without any hesitation.

His bold and unrestrained attitude gave Yu a favourable impression of him and the initial repulsion and disdain she had from seeing his scrawny frame completely disappeared.

[The Ancient Barbarian Race is all one family! That’s an interesting statement!]

“I also used a Detoxification Spell, but why were the effects so much worse than yours?” Yu humbly asked. Before coming to this cave, she had given emergency treatment to her clansman, but that had not been enough to remove the poison in his body. Hence, she could only freeze the wound and ask him to eat some herbs in hopes that the medicinal efficacies could help detoxify the poison in him. Even so, she had been aware that there was little hope of success.

“Do you mean to ask why the effect of your Detoxification Spell is not as good as mine even though your realm is higher than mine?” Yang Kai naturally knew what she meant. Thus, he smilingly replied, “Sometimes, control is more important than power.”

Yu fell into deep thought for a long time upon hearing those words before she finally nodded, “Many thanks!”

Yang Kai finished eating the dried meat in his hands and drank some water before asking, “What are you doing outside in this freezing weather?”

Although the people of the Frost and Snow Clan were generally not afraid of the severe cold, they still did not go out without reason under normal circumstances. This was especially true during winter where wild beasts and Barbarian Beasts were unusually active because they were searching for food. The risk of venturing outside was far greater than normal during this season.

“What about you, Shaman Niu?” Yu did not answer his question and instead countered with her own.

“I came out to train!” He smiled widely.

Yu seemed taken aback by his words for a moment before a look of admiration appeared on her face and she explained, “We are here to collect herbs to use in the Sacrificial Offering held in the spring.

“Sacrificial Offering…” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows at those words. The Blue South Village was such a small community that he didn’t even know if they held any Sacrificial Offerings. However, Yang Kai was aware that Sacrificial Offerings were commonplace in ancient times. Even the great Shamans who were successful in their cultivation would often offer up Sacrificial Offerings. The objects of their Sacrificial Offerings were usually to the Heavens or to Totems of their clans, but it was mostly the latter.

Smiling slightly, Yang Kai commented, “From the looks of it, your progress has not been going smoothly.”

Yu nodded sadly, “The herbs we need are being guarded by several Bone Melting Wolves. We were ambushed by them.”

“Several?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, showing great interest in this topic, “How many were there?”

“Six. If it wasn’t for their numbers, with my strength, I would not have allowed them to hurt my clansmen.”

Yang Kai’s eyes flashed suddenly and after a moment, he sat down in a formal position and asked in a low voice, “Shaman Yu, would you like a powerful helper when you go and collect those herbs again?”

Gazing at him in astonishment, Yu’s eyes soon brightened in response. She had been thinking about asking if he would lend them a hand. Unfortunately, they were neither familiar with each other nor clansmen of the same clan. Moreover, there were no benefits she could offer him. Thus, it had been difficult for her to bring it up, much less expect him to offer to help on his own.

Although the words of this self-proclaimed ‘powerful helper’ left her feeling slightly speechless, she couldn’t care less about such trivial details as the presence of two Shamans was enough to ensure the safety of her clansmen.

“Shaman Niu, what are your conditions?” As delighted by his offer as Yu was, she did not lose her reasoning. A Shaman Warrior of the South Barbarian Clan that they had met by chance was offering his aid, so he definitely had something he wanted from them.

“Give me those Barbarian Beasts,” he smilingly replied.

Under normal circumstances, it would have been impossible for her to agree to this condition. Those herbs might be precious, but the Barbarian Beasts were of great value too. Moreover, they had several people with them, as well as a High-Rank Shaman Warrior while he was just a Low-Rank Shaman Warrior in comparison. Sharing two of the Barbarian Beasts with him would be a reasonable condition; however, he had rescued one of their clansmen just now, so she simply groaned and readily agreed, “Good. The Barbarian Beasts are yours, but the herbs belong to us!”

Since she had made her decision, the rest of the clansmen had no objections.

Standing up, Yang Kai said, “Since it’s an urgent matter, we should set off now.”

Yu frowned in response, “My clansmen have just gone through a battle today and need to rest for a day…”

An Ancient Barbarian’s body might be extremely strong, but she had blessed them with the Bloodlust Spell during their previous battle. Even if it had only lasted for a very short period, the Blood Essence they lost would still make them weaker. They were no longer at the peak of their abilities.

“There’s no need for that. You only need to come with me.” After saying that, Yang Kai took the lead and walked out of the cave while beckoning to Yu and the others.

The Ancient Barbarian Race Warriors looked at their leader hesitatingly, while Yu was also feeling very troubled and thought to herself. [Why is this Shaman Niu behaving so impulsively? How can he act so rashly on mere hearsay?]

Unfortunately, there was nothing else she could do at this point, so she could only lead her men and follow after Yang Kai.
