If she was not incredibly capable, there would have been no way for her to crack the Bewildering Array in such a short time. The difficulty between arranging an array and cracking one was very different. With the same achievements in the Dao of Spirit Arrays, cracking an array was undoubtedly a lot more troublesome than arranging one. However, given that Luan Bai Feng could crack the Bewildering Array of the Nine Heavenly Layers in just a stick worth of incense, she certainly had great attainments in the Dao of Spirit Arrays.

“Who is that woman?” Yang Kai mumbled softly.

“She should be the Black Prison’s Warden, Luan Bai Feng!” Yue He spoke next to him.

Yang Kai turned his head to look, “Why are you here? Heal your wounds quickly. There will be a tougher battle ahead.”

When Yue He, Mo Mei and the others rescued Lu Xue, Yun Xing Hua and the rest, most of them were injured on the way back, not to mention the destruction of her artifact had also caused backlash to Yue He’s Soul. This was why Yang Kai ordered Fan Wu Xin to lead the 300 Open Heaven Realm Masters into battle, so that Yue He and the others could recover from their injuries.

Yue He shook her head slowly, “I’m fine now. The Spirit Pills provided by Young Master are very effective.”

Yang Kai looked at her and saw that she didn’t appear to be distressed, so he did not insist. In order to let Yue He and the others recover in the shortest time possible, he had passed out the Spirit Pills that he brought back from the Blood Monster Divine Palace. These Spirit Pills were of exceptional grade and all had Pill Veins, so they naturally had potent medicinal efficacy.

“The Black Prison’s Warden?” Yang Kai raised his brow and vaguely recalled that there was such a great force in 3,000 Worlds, but he did not know much about the Black Prison.

Yue He continued, “The environment of the Black Prison is extremely hostile and is filled with countless Natural Spirit Arrays. Even a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master would not dare to enter the depths of the Black Prison recklessly, but Luan Bai Feng can roam within it like a fish in water. She is unique in her own way.” Yue He did not recognize Luan Bai Feng at the beginning, for they had never met before after all; however, there were not many such powerful female Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in the 3,000 Worlds. Furthermore, given that she had great attainments in the Dao of Spirit Arrays, Yue He could easily guess her identity.

Yang Kai nodded lightly, and grinned, “I really have to thank her this time!”

During their conversation, the enemy forces, including their hundred plus flight type artifacts, had charged towards Void Land at full speed. Across the endless void, Kong Feng stood on the deck of his ship and bellowed solemnly with fury burning in his eyes, “Yang Kai! Your death has come!”

Yang Kai withdrew his smiling face and replied furiously, “Old dog Kong Feng, my Void Land and your Heavenly Sword Union are irreconcilable!”

Kong Feng guffawed, “A beat dog still dares to bark wildly! Just watch how this Union Master wipes out your Void Land today!”

After saying so, he swung his hand, “Kill!”

The flight type artifacts of the Hundred Sect Alliance charged straight at Void Land, while the cultivators who survived the Bewildering Array also returned to their respective forces with lingering fear and boiling anger.

All of the sudden, the Hundred Sect Alliance morale rose to new heights.

Yang Kai looked flustered. He grabbed the Array Jade in his hand and roared, “Activate the array!”

When the words fell, a buzzing noise suddenly was emitted from the entire Spirit Province. The world trembled for a while and an umbrella artifact flew out from the depth of the earth, rose into the sky, and transformed into a light curtain that enveloped the entire Void Land.

It was the Defensive Grand Array of Nine Heavenly Layers with its Array Core, the Heavenly Net Umbrella!

Yang Kai invested a lot of resources into this Heavenly Net Umbrella. Through the Proprietress, he met Grandmaster Ma Fan and hired him to refine this Array Artifact for Void Land. It possessed incredibly strong protective strength. As soon as this array was activated, the entire Void Land became as solid as gold. The light barrier that wrapped around Void Land was extremely sturdy and for a moment, the Hundred Sect Alliance did not notice it and smashed head-long into it one after another, hindered from crossing to the other side.

Kong Feng laughed as he shouted, “Still acting stubborn even when your time is up? Do you think this Union Master cannot do anything about this tortoise shell? Break it for me!”

At Kong Feng’s command, nearly 10,000 cultivators from the Hundred Sect Alliance launched attack after attack, using their artifacts and Secret Techniques to bombard the light barrier. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

As the Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array was being arranged, Grandmaster Wu Liang introduced its many wonderful functions to Yang Kai. He once boasted that the Grand Array was sturdy enough to handle attacks from 10 peak Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters for ten days and ten nights without a problem. It could be seen that the Grand Array was truly powerful.

However, at this moment, far more than 10 Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters were attacking the Grand Array at the same time!

Although the Hundred Sect Alliance lost nearly 4,000 people in the Bewildering Array, with dozens of Open Heaven Realm Masters falling as well, they were not doomed yet. At this moment, their combined attacks shook the world.

Even though the power of those cultivators below the Open Heaven Realm was limited, there was a large number of them. Just like how many ants could bite an elephant to death, even if weak individual attacks could not play a decisive role, they could wear down the power of the Grand Array bit by bit.

Streams of light flew out all across the sky, turning into sharp and violent attacks, colliding on the light barrier of the Grand Array, sending ripples across its surface in all directions. The light of the Grand Array faded rapidly, but Void Land could do nothing about it.

Kong Feng sneered, “He’s running out of tricks.”

If it was not as a last resort, why would the Brat surnamed Yang activate his Defensive Grand Array? He obviously ran out of options. Earlier, Kong Feng was worried that Void Land might still have more cards up its sleeves, but when he saw Yang Kai activating the Defensive Grand Array, he was immediately relieved.

It seemed that he had overestimated the ability of this Grand Array. He looked down coldly, and saw Yang Kai clenching his fists, his eyes seemingly about to pop out of their sockets as the veins on his forehead throbbed violently. He looked angry and nervous, which further confirmed Kong Feng’s judgment.

Luan Bai Feng frowned slightly as she warned, “Union Master Kong, stay alert.”

Kong Feng raised his hand, “How can a trivial Void Land stand against the might of our Hundred Sect Alliance? Earlier, we suffered a loss because this Brat had the defender’s advantage. Junior Sister Luan, just wait for the good news. When this Defensive Array is broken, you may collect all the captives you want.”

Hearing this, Luan Bai Feng spoke no more and just nodded lightly. Her eyes lingered on Yue He and Mo Mei as she secretly pondered whether it would be worthwhile to try to capture these two Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. However, even if she wanted to do so, she did not have much confidence, unless... Luan Bai Feng looked at Yang Kai again, and licked her red lips, making for an alluring sight.

The light barrier of the Grand Array dimmed progressively as countless attacks rained down on it, forming endless indents. After a cup of tea’s time, cracks started to form on the light barrier of the Grand Array.

“Almost time...” Yang Kai mumbled to himself. If they continued to fight like this, the Heavenly Net Umbrella would probably be damaged. This artifact cost a fortune to refine, so Yang Kai was truly reluctant to lose it in this battle.

He turned to look at Yue He, and Yue He also looked at him at the same time. After exchanging looks, as if their hearts were connected, they nodded slightly at each other.

The next moment, Yang Kai stealthily performed a hand seal.

With a bang, the light barrier that shrouded the exterior of Void Land suddenly burst into pieces, turned into little fluorescent lights and disappeared.

The Hundred Sect Alliance, which had been attacking ferociously, were dumbstruck at first when they saw this phenomenon, but soon they let out a thunderous cheer.

Kong Feng pointed forward as he roared through his clenched jaws, “Kill!”

There was no obstacle ahead, so the 100 flight type artifacts charged into Void Land furiously. Under the command of Kong Feng, Heavenly Sword Union rushed straight towards Yang Kai’s location, obviously attempting to capture him first.

Looking at each other across the air, the panic and tension on Yang Kai’s face suddenly disappeared and was replaced by a smirk.

Kong Feng was stunned for a moment before a sense of crisis rose from the depth of his heart, as if something terrible was about to happen.

Luan Bai Feng, who stood beside him, was alarmed too and shouted, “Union Master Kong, be careful! It’s a trap!”

Nevertheless, even if they realized that there was a trap at this moment, they could not turn back. The Hundred Sect Alliance was diving recklessly towards Void Land, their formation in complete disarray; it was simply impossible to re-organize them in short order.

Kong Feng ground his teeth and World Force exploded from him as he personally steered his ship. The vessel immediately turned into a stream of light that shot forward.

At the same time, Yang Kai lifted his hand and the Array Jade floated in front of him. Yue He appeared beside him in a flash, and both of them formed a set of hand seals with solemn looks on their faces, sending streams of light into the Array Jade one after another.

After just three breaths of time, Yang Kai bellowed, “Start the array again!”

*Chi chi chi chi… *

The air crackled as tens of thousands streams of light overshadowing the world abruptly emerged from the depths of Void Land.

Each of these streams of light emitted wild energy fluctuations suffused with thick murderous intent.

Previously, Old Hong suffered a great loss in the Bewildering Array. The Heaven’s Border disciples he led all were all dead or critically injured, leaving only him alone trying to survive. He felt dreadfully humiliated, but when the Defensive Grand Array of Void Land was broken and a smooth path was revealed ahead, Old Hong was overjoyed, especially when he saw Yang Kai who was close in front of him, frustrated and panicking. At Kong Feng’s command, Old Hong was the first to rush forward driving Heaven’s Border’s ship, attempting to force Void Land to pay for his humiliation.

But as soon as the countless streams of light appeared in front of him, Old Hong could not help but freeze in shock. He looked up, and when he figured out what those streams of light were, his face instantly turned pale and his eyes almost popped out of its sockets.

“Turn back! Turn back now!” He exclaimed in a cracking voice.

Every stream of light was an artifact! Tens of thousands of the streams of light meant tens of thousands of artifacts!

It was the Offensive Grand Array of Nine Heavenly Layers!

The offensive functions of the Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array set up by Grandmaster Wu Liang consisted of three parts, and this was only the first.

Back then, Yang Kai had gained an enormous number of Space Rings in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. In addition to what he had obtained from Seven Wonders Land after that, he now possessed countless artifacts. These artifacts were mostly useless to him, but it was too much of a waste to discard them. He could certainly earn some fortune by selling them, but using them to arrange this Offensive Array was a better option.

Yang Kai naturally could not control tens of thousands of artifacts alone. Even Yue He, a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, was powerless to do so.

However, it was different with the support of the Grand Array.

Yue He had refined the Array Jade before; after all, Yang Kai would not always be in Void Land, so when he was away, Yue He had control over the Nine Heavenly Layers.

The Defensive Grand Array that Yang Kai triggered earlier functioned autonomously so it only needed to be activated, allowing him to do so himself; however, the Offensive Grand Array needed to be actively controlled, so he required Yue He’s assistance.
