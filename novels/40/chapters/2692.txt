“By the way, what about Chai Hu?” Yang Kai suddenly thought of someone.

Chai Hu was not from Heng Luo Star Field, but a native of Star Boundary.

However, he had a very close relationship with Gui Zu, Chi Yue, Ai Ou and the rest, and they had even become sworn siblings.

A total of five people came from Heng Luo Star Field with Yang Kai back then: Wu Dao, Gui Zu, Ai Ou, Chi Yue, and Gu Cang Yun.

Among them, Wu Dao was the strongest cultivator in the Star Field back then. Unfortunately, the Heavens were impartial, and Wu Dao’s life was taken in the World Energy Baptism when he attempted to break through to the Dao Source Realm, leaving the remaining four by themselves to struggle in Sky Crane City.

It was also at that time when the four of them met Chai Hu and received a lot of help from him. Later, their friendship deepened, eventually leading to an oath of brotherhood, with Gui Zu as the First Brother, Ai Ou as the Second, Gu Cang Yun the Third Brother, Chai Hu the Fourth Brother, and Chi Yue their Fifth Sister.

When Yang Kai was passing through Sky Crane City, he encountered the City Lord of the Sky Crane City, Luo Jin, who was compelling Chi Yue to marry him. At that time, Chai Hu took Luo Jin’s daughter Luo Bing, as a hostage in order to rescue Chi Yue, but his efforts fell short. If it was not for Yang Kai’s serendipitous presence, even Chai Hu would have found himself in serious trouble.

Later, Yang Kai raised a huge fuss in the City Lord’s Mansion of Sky Crane City, killing a lot of people, and ultimately rescuing his Seniors, bringing them to Thousand Leaves Sect where they had decided to remain temporarily.

At this moment, Yang Kai remembered Chai Hu.

Upon hearing Yang Kai’s question, Gui Zu cackled playfully, “Fourth Brother has gone off to pursue love!”

“With who?” Yang Kai was stunned.

Ai Ou answered with an equally cunning expression, “That little girl Luo Bing, do you remember?”

“Her?” Yang Kai was startled, unable to believe it.

Chai Hu kidnapped Luo Bing back then, and even if the two were not enemies, they should not have developed any good feelings between them, so it really did not make sense for the two of them to have developed an intimate relationship.

Ai Ou explained, “When Fourth Brother appeared to kidnap that girl, she happened to be encountering some dangerous circumstances, so even though he did so with ulterior motives, it could still be considered him saving her. It seems she is at least capable of distinguishing between gratitude and grudge. Unfortunately, her father died at your hands, while Fourth Brother is our sworn brother. That girl was unable to get past her grief and had hidden her feelings for Fourth Brother. She left two years ago, but Fourth Brother was worried and decided to follow after her, and we haven’t received any news from him since then.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Gu Cang Yun continued, “You can call it a blessing or a misfortune, but because of this, Fourth Brother has also avoided this disaster.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly. Since Chai Hu had not been in the Thousand Leaves Sect, he did not need to worry about anything. He only asked out of concern for Gui Zu and the others for he had no personal friendship with Chai Hu.

“Fifth Sister is still in the hands of that old bastard,” Ai Ou said with a dark face, “Who knows if she will be sent out for auction as well.”

“I hope so,” Gu Cang Yun turned his head and looked towards the stage. All of them were sent out, so in principle, Chi Yue should be sent out too.

Yang Kai, however, shook his head lightly, “If I was that person, I would definitely keep a hostage in my hand for leverage.”

The few of them were surprised.

At this moment, Hua Qing Si on stage spoke, “Dear guests, this concludes today’s auction, but please remain in your seats. All of you have travelled far and wide to attend this auction, and my Honoured Master has prepared a generous gift as thanks. We hope you will like it.”

“She really was held back,” Ai Ou’s face sank and became extremely ugly.

The auction was over, but Chi Yue was still nowhere to be seen; obviously, she was being kept as a hostage, just as Yang Kai had predicted.

Although the few of them had been held prisoner by that old thing, and even had their cultivations sealed, they had never understood why.

“Monster King, protect them!” Yang Kai commanded, then flickered out of room one in a flash, reappearing above the auction hall, peering towards the backstage.

There was no one there now; even Wu Ming had long since disappeared.

He signalled Hua Qing Si and said, “Sister Hua, go to room one.”

Ying Fei was there and could be of assistance if anything happened later…

Hua Qing Si nodded, leaping out and flying into room one, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

Down in the hall and in the private rooms, countless eyes focused on Yang Kai, all of them wondering what exactly this arrogant young man planned to do next.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense spread out like a tide as he shouted, “Old dog, you used this auction to force this Young Master to appear, and this Young Master has indeed come. You used this Young Master’s friends to stall for time to make your arrangements, so this Young Master agreed and played along with your script. Now that everything is prepared, why haven’t you shown yourself? Are you that scared?”

He shouted, but there was no response at all.

However, many cultivators looked at each other in the hall and started whispering among themselves, watching Yang Kai like he had lost his mind.

“Old dog, do you feel no shame for behaving in such a cowardly manner? No matter what, you are still an esteemed Elder of Star Soul Palace, why act so timid?” Yang Kai sneered, his tone filled with ridicule.

“What? An Elder of Star Soul Palace?”

“There’s an Elder of Star Soul Palace here?”

“What does he mean?”

Yang Kai’s words set off an explosion in the crowd.

Star Soul Palace was not just another Sect in the Southern Territory, but also a symbol of hegemony and invincibility; after all, it was the Sect of the Great Emperor that protected the Southern Territory.

It was rare to be able to meet an Elder of Star Soul Palace, as such a figure was not inferior in status to a Sect Master of other top Sects.

And based on what Yang Kai said, it seemed like he had grievances with this Star Soul Palace Elder…

Was this not… courting death?

Of all the people in the Southern Territory, this boy had to offend a Star Soul Palace Elder, even daring to cause a commotion with such shameless boasting and incessant chiding! He simply did not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth!

At that moment, many people looked at Yang Kai as if they were looking at a dead man.

How could he survive from offending a Star Soul Palace Elder?

“Hahahaha!” A burst of loud erratic laughter sent the crowd into anxiety. The complexion of many Emperor Realm Masters in the private rooms changed, clearly feeling their auras destabilized slightly by the man’s laughter. Their Emperor Qi rolled uncontrollably, horrifying them as they realized how terrifying an existence the one who laughed just now was.

Was that the supposed Star Soul Palace Elder? There were not many Elders in Star Soul Palace, but with nothing but a laugh to go on, no one could identify who this person was.

“I have long heard stories about Little Friend Yang, and today I have finally seen that they are not just stories.”

Yang Kai snorted coldly, “This Young Master doesn’t speak to faceless people, show yourself.”

There was a moment of silence before the voice replied, “Since Little Friend Yang insists on it, then I shall do as you wish.”

When the words fell, the world suddenly dimmed, and countless Spirit Array patterns flashed across the entire auction house. The array patterns quickly lit up, like sparks that could start a prairie fire, spreading out all at once.

In the next instant, everyone had an illusion that the world was turned upside down and that space was divided up.

An invisible pulling force seemed to be drawing them into an endless void.

“En? Eight Sides Yuan Shielding Array!” In room one, Patriarch Gong’s complexion darkened as he hurriedly took out a set of array flags and poured his Emperor Qi into them. He flung both of his arms and threw the flags into the void one by one.

The array banners quickly disappeared, and the chaotically swirling space in room one immediately stabilized.

“Gong Tai, you court death!” An angry voice shouted. It was the same mysterious voice from before, but this time it was mixed with a shocking violent force, seemingly irritated by Patriarch Gong’s actions.

The shockwave that blasted towards Gong Tai’s Knowledge Sea caused him an incredible headache, resulting in him spurting a mist of blood from his mouth as he fell to the ground.

Things had not finished yet though as a five-coloured burst of light shot into room one, condensing into a sharp blade that slashed directly towards Gong Tai.

This five-coloured light blade was the same one that had previously killed an Emperor Realm Master.

Gong Tai’s heart screamed in panic, the blood draining from his face as he watched the blade pierce towards him.

Just when the five-coloured light blade was about to hit him though, an eagle claw accompanied by a powerful screech appeared from the side and firmly grasped the advancing blade, crushing it instantly.

Gong Tai was panting, his face pale, relieved that someone had saved his life at this critical moment.

He looked to the side with lingering fear and saw Ying Fei nodding at him with assurance, “Don’t worry, no one can kill you as long as this King is here.”

Gong Tai got up and respectfully cupped his fists, “Many thanks, Sir Monster King.”

An Elder of Star Soul Palace wanted to kill him, while a Monster King saved his life. The irony of the situation was hard to even comprehend.

Ying Fei waved his hand, “It’s fine. What is this Eight Sides Yuan Shielding Array that you mentioned?”

Yang Kai and Gong Tai had chatted briefly when the former brought the latter back to room one, so Ying Fei knew that Gong Tai was a Spirit Array Grandmaster. If this wasn’t the case, Gong Tai would not have been able to recognize the newly activated Spirit Array at a glance while also taking action to counter it.

Gui Zu and the others turned to Gong Tai with curiosity.

Gong Tai sighed, “It’s a Spirit Array that segments a section of space into individual sections. I knew that there was a nested Spirit Array arranged here, but I did not expect one of the arrays to be Eight Sides Yuan Shielding Array.”

“A nested Spirit Array? What is the other Spirit Array?” Ying Fei frowned.

“The Five Elements Grand Sealing Array!” Gong Tai replied, “These two Spirit Arrays complement each other and enhance each other’s effects. The one who set up the arrays is really quite skilled.”

After a pause, he looked at Ying Fei, “May I ask Sir Monster King, what grievances does Little Brother Yang have with this Star Soul Palace Elder that the latter would not hesitate to plant two Grand Spirit Arrays just to trap him?”

Ying Fei’s face sank and replied, “You mean, this Spirit Array has the effect of trapping people?”

Gong Tai nodded, “Yes,” He explained, “The Five Elements Grand Sealing Array has the effect of isolating those inside of it from the outside world. Right now, this auction house has become an independent sealed world of sorts. As long as the Spirit Array is not broken, I am afraid that no one in here can leave. As for the Eight Sides Yuan Shielding Array, it can isolate everyone here into small independent spaces. If this Old Master had not acted fast enough just now, I’m afraid that all of us would have been separated.”

Ying Fei’s face changed drastically at his words, “This is bad!”

He turned to look outside, but there was no trace of Yang Kai. It was pitch black outside of room one, as if the entire room had sunken into The Void. Releasing his Divine Sense, Ying Fei failed to detect anyone else’s aura.

It was like the thousands of people in the auction house had simply disappeared.
