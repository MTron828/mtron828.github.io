*Hong… *

There was a terrible explosion, and the world was filled with a bright light; nothing could be seen in the blinding brilliance.

“Eh?” Duan Hong Chen, who was charging towards Wu Kuang, preparing to drag him to Hell, suddenly frowned, and an extremely uneasy feeling poured out from the depths of his heart.

Because Wu Kuang had blown up the Primordial Astral Wind right in front of him.

What was he planning?

Before he could think about it, the aftermath of the Heaven-destroying and Earth-shattering force hit him from all directions.

It was the impact from the destruction of the Primordial Astral Wind. Anything the devastating gust swept by was turned into nothingness, and no longer existed.

Cracking sounds came from every corner of this peculiar world that was on the verge of collapsing; it seemed that it would not last any longer.

“This is bad!” Duan Hong Chen seemed to have perceived something and quickly reached out to tap on the main points of his body. The process of self-destruction was immediately stopped.

*Huhuhu… *

He was tossed about by the wind like a lone boat on the verge of capsizing in a violent sea. Fortunately, the Divine Tree Bai Yi that had been guarding him provided a little protection; even so, his robes were ripped and his skin was torn into a bloody mess.

He managed to release his Divine Sense and clearly noticed that Wu Kuang’s skeleton was slowly falling apart under the devastating force of the Primordial Astral Wind explosion, gradually turning into dust.

On this day, the skeleton which belonged to the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor had been completely destroyed after hibernating for tens of thousands of years. In other words, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor Wu Kuang could no longer regain his original body.

But Duan Hong Chen did not rejoice, instead feeling that the situation was more serious than before.

*Hong long long… *

The sound of the sky and the earth splitting echoed loudly as this strange sealed world finally could no longer maintain itself in face of all the destructive power, and collapsed completely.

A huge black hole took shape, and it swallowed everything contained in this world in no more than ten breaths of time. Then with a slight tremor, it immediately disappeared. In the Void connected to the black hole, Yang Kai drifted along with the current, feeling lightheaded, his face filled with lingering fear.

Yang Kai, who had just broken through to the Emperor Realm, was rejoicing in his own strength and the transformation of Emperor Qi in his body, and did not expect that the aftermath of the battle between the two Great Emperors would completely demolish the sealed world.

He did not have time to escape from the catastrophe, so he was swallowed by the black hole into The Void.

Although he was far away from the battlefield, he still suffered serious injuries. After being swallowed into this place, it took a long time before he gradually recovered his senses, fear still etched on his face.

He did not know what exactly happened between the two Great Emperors as he was too focused on his own breakthrough, so the battle was concluded by the time he noticed something went wrong.

[What happened to the Bustling World Great Emperor? Is he dead or alive?]

Duan Hong Chen was closely connected to Azure Sun Temple; after all, Temple Master Wen Zi Shan was raised by Duan Hong Chen. Yang Kai was a disciple of the Azure Sun Temple, so it was only natural for Yang Kai to pay more attention to his situation.

Even if they had no involvement, the Bustling World Great Emperor had put his life on the line, cutting his own cultivation repeatedly over tens of thousands of years to search for Wu Kuang in the Shattered Star Sea. The selfless spirit he carried that cared for the common people was awe-inspiring.

The horrible power just now was most likely produced by the self-destruction of something or someone. Yang Kai immediately assumed that the Bustling World Great Emperor had chosen to self-destruct to die with Wu Kuang.

Yang Kai’s face darkened at this thought, believing that the Bustling World Great Emperor’s Soul was really gone.

He coughed up a few mouthfuls of blood, took out some healing pills from his Space Ring, and chomped on them like they were beans before sitting down cross-legged and releasing his Divine Sense to examine his own condition.

Yang Kai was startled at what he saw.

He noticed a pair of eyes gazing at him eerily, and the gaze did not come from the surroundings, but from within his own body.

His face changed drastically as he formed a hand seal and shouted, “Suppress!”

His Soul Avatar then appeared over his Knowledge Sea.

For some reason, a figure appeared alongside him in his Knowledge Sea, standing quietly above the tumbling fires, looking around in amusement, occasionally looking surprised.

Yang Kai looked at the figure, gritted his teeth, and shouted, “Wu Kuang!”

The figure turned slowly at the sound of his name, revealing the face of a middle-aged man. He looked neither angry nor excited, but his eyes glowed brightly with an air of natural majesty.

Although Yang Kai had never seen his face, he still recognised his identity at a glance.

Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, Wu Kuang!

Yang Kai’s heart sank. He did not even notice how the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor broke through the defences of his Knowledge Sea. If this intruder had not bothered to conceal himself, Yang Kai would most likely have never even noticed him.

Chills filled Yang Kai as his very Soul trembled.

Wu Kuang was also a Soul Avatar at the moment, but the strength of his Soul Avatar vastly exceeded Yang Kai’s, being so condensed that it almost seemed corporeal.

“Junior, how dare you address this King by his true name!” Wu Kuang snorted coldly, and an invisible assault was suddenly blasted towards Yang Kai.

The assault was obviously powered by his Soul, and its might was terrifying, causing Yang Kai’s complexion to change drastically. With a hurried wave of his hand, Yang Kai summoned up the flaming seawater below to form a protective barrier around him.

With a bang, the attack slammed into the wall of flames, creating a terrifying explosion that stirred Yang Kai’s entire Knowledge Sea into chaos that did not calm for a long time.

Yang Kai took a few steps back, his face steeled in vigilance as he stared ahead and quickly demanded, “Wu Kuang, get out of here, otherwise don’t blame this Young Master for being impolite to you!”

He felt extremely uneasy that Wu Kuang had appeared in his Knowledge Sea. It was not so much because of the secrets Yang Kai wanted to keep hidden; instead, he feared that Wu Kuang had ulterior motives.

“Impolite to me, is it?” Wu Kuang squinted at Yang Kai and sneered, “Interesting. I have not heard someone speak to me in such a manner for a long time, but since this King is here now, naturally I won’t leave easily.”

“What do you want?” Yang Kai looked at him coldly.

Wu Kuang chuckled, “Why are you asking when you already know? You are also an intelligent fellow, don’t you know the purpose of this King appearing here?”

Yang Kai’s face became extremely ugly at his words as his worst fears came true.

Wu Kuang continued, “This King’s body has been destroyed by that old fart, and without a body, no matter how strong I am, this King is just a wandering Soul. Junior, you have a good body, this King likes it very much. Give it to this King and you will witness the peak of the Martial Dao!”

Yang Kai gritted his teeth and glowered, “You want to seize my body?”

Wu Kuang snorted coldly, “Why not? Is it really such a bad thing? This King just needs a body. If you cooperate, this King would allow you to stay here without devouring your Soul, but if you don’t cooperate… this King doesn’t mind letting you experience the difference in our strength.”

Yang Kai sneered, “This is my Knowledge Sea, do you think it’s really okay for you to boast so shamelessly here!?”

Wu Kuang glanced at him in amazement, then slowly shook his head, “Stubborn as a mule!”

After speaking, he stopped paying attention to Yang Kai. Instead, he turned his head and looked around for a while, soon nodding in approval, “Junior, your Soul’s strength is indeed quite good, extraordinary compared to an ordinary Emperor Realm cultivator. It is even a mutated Conflagrated Knowledge Sea, so it could be said to meet the requirements of this King. Surprisingly, you could reach this stage with only such a cultivation…”

They seemed to have exchanged positions as Wu Kuang commented loudly on Yang Kai without caring for his feelings. Yang Kai wanted to attack him, but he did not dare to act rashly.

The usual tactics could not be used on a Monster who had lived for countless years. If the sneak attack failed, he would be at an even greater disadvantage.

As he continued to inspect the surroundings, Wu Kuang’s gaze hardened suddenly as he fixed his eyes in a certain direction, whispering, “That island…”

He was staring at the seven-coloured island floating in Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea incredulously, carefully studying it before calling out in alarm, “Soul Warming Lotus! It’s the Soul Warming Lotus!”

Wu Kuang had vast experience and knowledge, his title as the top Master of the Star Boundary not being undeserved, but even so, at this moment, he could not help feeling an upsurge of emotions looking at the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus as he muttered, “Junior, you actually have the Soul Warming Lotus!”

Yang Kai snorted coldly, “All this fuss over nothing!”

Wu Kuang grinned, “This King did not expect to see the Soul Warming Lotus here. This King explored countless Star Fields to find it but found nothing. I never thought I would see it today. What a waste of effort, searching far and wide to just find it here.”

Yang Kai snorted, “Why are you so happy? It’s not even yours!” He threw Wu Kuang a contemptuous look.

“It will be in a bit!” Wu Kuang brushed off Yang Kai’s mockery, now in a good mood. He looked at the Soul Warming Lotus greedily for a while before nodding, “Not bad. With this Soul Warming Lotus, this King will be able to integrate with your body perfectly. There is no need to worry about backlash at all and it won’t be a problem to restore to my peak in the future.” He seemed to have foreseen a bright future for himself, which put him into excellent spirits. While talking, he turned his head and looked around in search of more, his brow rising slightly as he looked up at the star-filled sky, “Junior, I didn’t expect you to have so many good things.”

Yang Kai’s brow twitched as he questioned him, “Do you know what this is?”

He was referring to the Star Chart that was skittered all over the sky of his Knowledge Sea. The Star Chart was obtained by Yang Kai long ago, and mapped out the position of each star in Heng Luo Star Field.

Yang Kai used the Star Chart above his Knowledge Sea to identify directions and chart courses while he was wandering in Heng Luo Star Field. Without this, he would have gotten lost in the vast Star Field multiple times. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Yang Kai could not help feeling inquisitive at Wu Kuang’s words at this moment.

Wu Kuang glanced at him with a smile and said meaningfully “You came to the Star Boundary from a lower Star Field, right?”

Yang Kai frowned, “That’s right.”

There was no need to deny it, so he readily admitted it.
