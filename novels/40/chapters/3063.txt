Just like that, an Eighth-Order Great Dragon had been crippled.

However, it wasn’t accurate to claim that he had been crippled, as Yang Kai had only plucked out one of his Dragon Scales. Strictly speaking, this kind of injury was practically nothing. Under a different circumstance, an Eighth-Order Dragon would be totally unaffected and still fully combat-capable.

Nevertheless, without the Dragon Temple’s Blessing, and under the influence of Yang Kai’s Dragon Pressure, he couldn’t even sustain his Great Dragon form, let alone battle against Yang Kai. Although he was fine, he had lost the ability to keep fighting.

All the Dragon Clan members widened their eyes in disbelief as they were stunned at Yang Kai’s incredible agility and ruthlessness.

While Yang Kai was making a move on the Eighth-Order Great Dragon, the hundreds of Humans and Fu Chi’s women finally came to their senses as they shrieked and ran for their lives.

An epic battle was about to take place, so they wouldn’t dare to remain. In the blink of an eye, there were no longer any bystanders in front of the palace. All those that were left had something to do with the matters on this day.

At that moment, Yang Kai had Zhu Qing, Zhu Lie, Jiu Feng, and Liu Yan on his side. They were all the power he had. On the other hand, there were still about a dozen from the Dragon Clan’s side, so there was a stark difference in numbers.

However, Yang Kai was able to carry himself in an overbearing manner, which made him stand out among so many people. The Dragon Clan members had been pressed by his presence to the point where they could hardly breathe.

“Hahahaha!” Jiu Feng guffawed, “Brat, you’ve done a great job. These arrogant guys are indeed in need of a lesson!”

Due to the incident more than ten years ago, Spirit Beast Island and Dragon Island had found themselves on opposing sides. Naturally, Jiu Feng was gleeful to see that the Dragon Clan had suffered a big setback and as such found Yang Kai more pleasing to the eye now. [No wonder the Young Lady cannot forget about him. He’s indeed not a weakling.]

At the same time, she was glad that she didn’t bring the Young Lady with her. [If that little girl saw how audacious Yang Kai was just now, she would certainly fall head over heels for him. She has just come of age, so she’s very likely to be enchanted by a man’s heroic act at this stage in her life.]

Yang Kai swept a glance over them and demanded, “I’ll ask this question one last time. Will you let Qing’er and me go?”

All the Dragon Clan members were silent as they glowered at him.

“Fine then! Come at me!” Yang Kai growled and let out a scorching breath as he stomped his feet on the ground with a loud thud. In an instant, the entire Spirit Island shook a little. Like a cannonball, his massive figure leapt into the air and pounced on the Dragon Clan members, which signalled the true start of the battle.

With a precedent prior to this, the Dragon Clan members knew what Yang Kai was planning on doing; therefore, they hurriedly roared and assumed their true forms.

At that instant, Dragons of various colours, red, white, green, and blue, flew towards the sky. The smallest Dragon had a 100-metre-long frame, while the largest was 200 metres long. These Great Dragons hovered in the sky as their Dragon Pressure radiated out, seemingly causing the Heavens and Earth to shake.

Before Yang Kai could even reach them, the dozen Great Dragons opened their mouths and shot out their Pureblood Dragon Breaths from above.

At that moment, scorching Dragon Fire, freezing Dragon Breath, emerald green Dragon Poison, jets of Dragon Water, and blades of Dragon Wind were all directed at Yang Kai in a Heaven-shaking, Earth-shattering display.

Yang Kai roared and began chanting in the abstruse Dragon Language. As he parted his lips, a beam of golden light hovered above his head and transformed into a shield. All the attacks landed on the golden shield with loud thuds and, within moments, the Dragon Breath attacks hit Yang Kai as the shield shattered.

Yang Kai fell from the sky just as fast as he had soared into the air, his towering figure landing on the island and opening a huge pit on the ground, sending dirt and sand hurtling into the air. There were many wounds on areas of his skin that were not covered in Dragon Scales.

Upon seeing that, the Dragons were elated, but just when they were about to seize the chance and continue attacking Yang Kai, they were shocked to see that he was climbing out of the pit with difficulty. His horrifying eyes now beamed with a red glare. He looked like an enraged beast that was about to gobble up all his opponents.

After taking a look at the sky, Yang Kai moved his body and disappeared from everyone’s sight.

Alarmed, the Dragons appeared flustered.

Just then, a figure flashed across their eyes as Yang Kai appeared somewhere near them. He extended his hand in an attempt to capture a one hundred metre long Dragon.

The Great Dragon was prepared, however, and immediately flew away upon sensing Yang Kai’s appearance. The other Dragon Clan members also dispersed in a cautious manner.

“Solidify!” Yang Kai yelled and pushed his Space Principles wildly, which then transformed into an invisible cage and engulfed the 100 metre long Dragon in it. The space around him had turned viscous and now had considerable binding power.

For a moment, the Great Dragon was unable to free himself. Recalling Yang Kai’s ruthless acts just now, he roared in fright and turned his head to bite Yang Kai. With his mouth open, it could be seen that his teeth were as sharp as blades, which was horrifying.

Without stopping, Yang Kai balled up his fist and landed it on the Great Dragon’s head. The fist was so forceful that the Great Dragon’s head was jerked to the side, and a large patch of the scales on his head were peeled off. At that moment, he was clearly dazed and disoriented.

Seizing the chance, Yang Kai immediately grabbed his Dragon Tail.

Before Yang Kai could use the same trick as before though, another Great Dragon pounced on him and went round his legs with his huge figure. It was as though a python was strangling its target. In just a short moment, he managed to confine Yang Kai to the same spot and bind his body.

Seeing that, the other Dragon Clan members rushed over to rescue the dazed Dragon.

Yang Kai had crippled one of their clansmen on this day, but they could dismiss that as him being caught off guard. However, if the same thing happened again, the Dragon Clan’s reputation would be ruined. The Dragon Clan members had gone all out to deal with Yang Kai, so they mustn’t let a Human strut around before their eyes.

Meanwhile, Zhu Qing and the others finally rushed over.

However, the Dragon Clan members seemed prepared for them. Someone gave an order in secret, upon which the dozen Dragons separated and launched themselves at Zhu Qing and the others to stop them.

“Big Sister Qing, please don’t make it difficult for me. I don’t want to go against you, but I have no choice.” A Purple Dragon stood in front of Zhu Qing and parted her lips. It seemed that she had been put in a tight spot. This Purple Dragon was none other than Fu Ling.

She was just a Sixth-Order Dragon, so she felt diffident when dealing with a Ninth-Order Dragon like Zhu Qing. If it weren’t because of the Dragon Temple’s Blessing, it would be impossible for her to be bold enough to block Zhu Qing’s way as the bloodline suppression alone was enough to render her powerless.

Beside Fu Ling was a Blue Dragon that was slightly longer. Upon hearing that, she went along with Fu Ling and uttered, “Big Sister Qing, please stop this.”

This Blue Dragon was the Dragon girl who held a flower basket and cast a flower rain alongside Fu Ling earlier. Her bloodline was one rank higher than that of Fu Ling, making her a Seventh-Order.

However, with the Dragon Temple’s Blessing, she could join forces with Fu Ling and battle against Zhu Qing for quite some time. They might even gain the upper hand.

With a stern expression, Zhu Qing demanded, “Get lost!”

The Seventh-Order Blue Dragon shook her head, “I’m afraid I can’t agree to that.”

Without uttering one more word, Zhu Qing roared and transformed into a 300 metre long Red Dragon. There seemed to be fire burning on her body, and her size was more than two times larger than Fu Ling. Seeing that, Fu Ling and the Blue Dragon couldn’t help gulping.

Although the Blue Dragon had heard that Zhu Qing had broken through to become a Ninth-Order Dragon, she thought it was just hearsay. It wasn’t until now that she realized the rumours were indeed right.

Before Zhu Qing, there were only two Ninth-Order Great Dragons on Dragon Island, who were the Third Elder and the Fourth Elder.

The Third Elder had been imprisoned in the Dragon Grave more than ten years ago, and no one knew whether she was still alive or not. On the other hand, the Fourth Elder was an amiable person, so the other Dragon Clan members didn’t feel much pressure when facing him.

It was then they came to the realization that there was a huge difference between a Ninth-Order Great Dragon and themselves. Even with the Dragon Temple’s Blessing, they still felt terrified when confronted by Zhu Qing’s true form.

Then, Zhu Qing’s Dragon form turned into a beam of red light and launched herself at Fu Ling and the Blue Dragon, the heat from her body warping space wherever she flew.

Fu Ling and the Blue Dragon immediately tried to intercept her.

Zhu Qing had been blocked and Zhu Lie wasn’t spared the same treatment.

He had turned into his Dragon form as he was now fighting with an Eighth-Order Great Dragon. As they attacked each other with claws, teeth, tail, and using Dragon Clan Secret Techniques, it was as though there were unresolvable grudges between them. In the blink of an eye, they shot into the sky and continued the intense fight.

On the other hand, Jiu Feng managed to hold her ground while dealing with two Dragons on her own. Her movement was swift as she darted around the place, causing the two Dragons to be infuriated.

That was a terrible feeling despite the fact that they were strong. Jiu Feng just wouldn’t fight with them head-on, as though she was trying to mess around with them, which was why they were incensed.

“Little girl, go away if you don’t want to die!”

At that moment, Fu Qi was facing Liu Yan alone. His hundred-metre-long frame stood in stark contrast with Liu Yan’s petite figure. He leaned his head, which was as large as a house, close to Liu Yan and growled. It wasn’t that Fu Qi was a sympathetic person, but he had his pride as a Dragon Clan member. It would be shameful for him to deal with a little girl who was about seven or eight years old.

However, he soon realized that he had made a huge mistake, because this soft-looking and adorable little girl possessed a power that was as great as that of his own. When a loud Phoenix Cry was heard, two beams of fire shot out from Liu Yan’s back. The flowing fire had transformed into a pair of wings on her back as it started crackling.

At the same time, Liu Yan’s petite figure swelled up and transformed, upon which a Fire Bird that was as large as Fu Chi came into existence.

The Fire Bird appeared elegant, but her eyes were filled with a sense of majesty like a Queen’s.

“You’re from the Phoenix Clan!” Fu Qi yelled as his pupils contracted. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Although he had figured that this little girl wasn’t as innocent as she appeared, he had never expected that she was a Phoenix Clan member. Dragons and Phoenixes were often grouped together, and they were equals in terms of power.

Among all the Divine Spirits, it was difficult to tell whether the Dragons or the Phoenixes were the stronger clan, but in comparison, the Phoenix Clan was even rarer than the Dragon Clan. At the very least, the Dragon Clan had their own Dragon Island and inheritance, while there had not been any news about the Phoenix Clan in a long time.

Luan Feng of the Ancient Wild Lands of the Eastern Territory couldn’t really be considered to be a true Phoenix Clan member; she was from a branch of the Phoenix Clan. Even Jiu Feng, who had come all the way here, couldn’t be regarded as a real Phoenix Clan member.

However, the one before Fu Qi’s eyes was a genuine Phoenix Clan member. He hurriedly focused his mind as he dared not to be complacent.

Silavin: Okay. So, to explain that last part. Jiu Feng and Luan Feng are not pure Phoenix. So, imagine their bloodline as something (another Divine Spirit) + Phoenix. Meanwhile, the fire, ice and etc Phoenixes are Phoenix + Phoenix.

If you think about it another way, it’s just a strong case of if you are from Alabama or not.
