“The headquarters of your Daybreak Pavilion is not worse than here. Why make such a fuss?” Senior Brother Kou squinted, his eyes flashing a faint light as he observed the shock on Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun’s faces.

Yang Kai turned his head and quickly said, “As I explained before, we are not from the Daybreak Pavilion. This is our first time here, but believe what you like!”

Senior Brother Kou nodded faintly and said nothing, just standing on the deck with his hands behind his back, enjoying the bit of wind he allowed past the ship’s barrier.

After reaching Blue Feather Sect’s sky, Senior Brother Kou tapped his foot lightly and the boat quickly descended to the ground.

Down below, many cultivators saw the ship approach, and when they noticed that it was Senior Brother Kou driving it, they cupped their fists in greeting.

Apparently, this Senior Brother Kou was quite famous in Blue Feather Sect, with many disciples recognizing him.

Some people directed curious looks towards Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun as they wondered how Senior Brother Kou had gone out and suddenly caught two people. Yang Kai vaguely heard them whispering about Daybreak Pavilion and it was clear that they suspected him and Liu Xian Yun of being spies.

[This Daybreak Pavilion and Blue Feather Sect definitely have many grievances between them!]

Yang Kai thought to himself.

At the same time, he and Liu Xian Yun were also secretly looking around at the surrounding cultivators and were shocked by what they saw.

There were about seventy or eighty people in the square around them, and half were Origin Kings. Third-Order Origin Kings were everywhere, with at least a dozen of them giving off a more intimidating aura than Yin Le Sheng.

If it were a battle in which Yin Le Sheng couldn’t use his Dao Source Grade Netherworld Darkness Shroud, Yang Kai was a hundred percent certain these dozens or so cultivators could defeat him.

Based on the information he obtained from Liu Xian Yun, Yang Kai immediately understood that these dozen or so people must have successfully transformed their Saint Qi into Source Qi but were unable to break through to the Dao Source Realm due to a lack of comprehension of Principles.

There was an almost insurmountable gap between the Origin King Realm and the Dao Source Realm, which was also the most basic reason why Senior Brother Kou was regarded with such awe.

This was the first Sect that Yang Kai had encountered since coming to the Star Boundary, so everything he saw shocked him.

Several dozen Origin Kings all gathered was a scene that would be absolutely impossible to encounter in the Star Field. Origin Kings were peak-level existences where Yang Kai had come from. Without even mentioning those old monsters who hid from the world and never showed their faces, most ordinary cultivators would not ever get a chance to meet even a First-Order Origin King.

But here, such masters were as common as weeds in the field, literally scattered around randomly.

And this was just the tip of the iceberg, who knew how many disciples this Blue Feather Sect had, or how many Origin King, Dao Source, and even Emperor Realm masters there were!

Among the seventy or eighty people, in addition to more than half which were Origin Kings, there were also some Origin Realm and Saint King Realm cultivators, but they were actually the minority.

Even in the Star Boundary, strength was not something that a cultivator could come to possess overnight. Although the cultivation environment here was countless times better than that of the Star Field, cultivators still had to advance steadily from the bottom, which was why it wasn’t surprising to see Saint Kings and Origin Realm masters walking about.

Just as Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun were immersing in their shock, Senior Brother Kou pointed to a cultivator who had been following him and said, “Cui Jing, send them both to the Bone Prison. I’ll report to Protector Bian to decide how to deal with them.”

“Send them to the Bone Prison?” The cultivator named Cui Jing was a little stunned, as if Senior Brother Kou handling Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun this way came as a surprise to him; however, he did not question his orders and simply nodded, “Yes!”

Saying so, he waved his hand at Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun and said with a cold face, “Get down, how long do you two want to stay on the boat?”

Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun sighed helplessly and could only jump off the ship.

“Follow me!” Cui Jing said before leading the way forward.

Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun followed reluctantly.

Both of them knew that it was useless to explain anything now. Since Senior Brother Kou did not trust them from the start, he definitely wouldn’t believe them now.

Fortunately, although their strength had been locked, they had not suffered any harm yet.

Passing along the road, it seemed they were travelling towards a certain mountain.

Halfway there, Yang Kai asked tentatively, “Dare I ask this friend, what is this Bone Prison?”

Cui Jing turned his head and snorted at Yang Kai, “Who is your friend?”

Yang Kai frowned but still cupped his fists and said, “Pardon this one’s offence. Senior Brother, could you explain to both of us what exactly this Bone Prison is?”

Yang Kai’s attitude made Cui Jing very satisfied, so he put on a kind face and said lightly, “Just like the name implies, it’s a prison where people are detained. Inside there... heh heh heh... well you’ll understand when we get there.”

The low, sullen laughter made Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun’s expressions slightly change as they subconsciously realized this Bone Prison was definitely not a good place to go.

The Bone Prison was indeed located under a certain mountain and had a number of Blue Feather Sect disciples guarding it. After Cui Jing handed over Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun to the disciples here, he left directly without sparing them a second glance.

The disciple who was now charged with Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun was also a Third-Order Origin King, and he had an extremely powerful aura. He was obviously not an affable individual.

After Cui Jing left, this man squinted his eyes and swept his gaze over Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun before frowning and cursing, “Damn that Cui Jing, every time he brings someone over, he always snatches their Space Ring first, not leaving any soup for Father here to drink.”

After grumbling for a while, he turned to Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun again and commanded, “Don’t even try to pretend, just hand over whatever you have left.”

“Huh?” Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun were confused.

“The artifacts you’ve refined, or are you going to tell Father here that Cui Jing snatched those too,” The Blue Feather Sect disciple sneered.

As soon as this remark came out, not only did Liu Xian Yun’s pretty face change, Yang Kai’s face also became unsightly.

A cultivator could refine artifacts into their bodies to summon whenever needed, this was common sense. Previously, Senior Brother Kou and his group had only forced Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun to surrender their Space Rings and had not mentioned their artifacts, seemingly leaving them a little leeway.

But as soon as they came to this Bone Prison, the cultivator guarding this place demanded they hand over their artifacts. Naturally, their expressions became ugly.

The artifacts a cultivator refined into their body were obviously their strongest and most precious, along with the ones they most commonly used. These artifacts had formed a deep connection with both their mind and Soul. If they were forcefully seized, they would suffer great harm!

Compared to Senior Brother Kou and his subordinates, Yang Kai suddenly felt that this man was far more wicked.

There were only three artifacts on Yang Kai’s body. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Verdant Dragon Bone Sword, Annihilation Thunder Bead, and Sealed World Bead, the last two being Emperor Artifacts. Yang Kai had not refined anything else into his body, but no matter which one it was, he could not surrender any of these three to others.

Although he did not know what kind of natal artifacts Liu Xian Yun possessed, Yang Kai was clear she wouldn’t give them up easily.

However, the other party seemed to have expected this and seeing Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun remain silent, he simply sneered, “You want me to take them by force? Woman, if you want to refuse, this Yan Xiu Ran may be able to accommodate you, after all, Father here knows how to show tender affection, heh heh heh...”

Saying so, an obscene look appeared on his face.

Liu Xian Yun naturally understood his intentions and immediately hid behind Yang Kai.

Yan Xiu Ran’s eyes became cold next as he squinted at Yang Kai and said, “The woman can say no, but you can’t!”

“I don’t have any artifacts on me,” Yang Kai quickly said.

Yan Xiu Ran coldly snorted, “You think you can deceive Father here with such an obvious lie? Since you refuse to cooperate, don’t blame Father for acting ruthlessly.”

Saying so, he quickly took off a small bag that was hanging on his waist.

This bag was quite small and exquisite and was currently bulging slightly, as if there was something alive inside, squirming about.

Yan Xiu Ran sneered, opened the bag, and poured something out of it.

After seeing the appearance of this thing, Liu Xian Yun could not help calling out in alarm.

It was a small snake, but it looked very different from a normal snake. Instead, it was pure white and looked like it had been carved from the finest jade.

Even with Yang Kai’s experience though, he could not recognize the name or purpose of this snake-like Monster Beast; however, since Yan Xiu Ran took out this Monster Beast at this time, obviously it played some role in snatching another cultivator’s artifacts.

Yan Xiu Ran also undoubtedly attached great importance to this small spirit snake and acted cautiously when he took it out.

Immediately, he stretched out his hand and grabbed Yang Kai directly in front of him before grinning, “Since you refuse a toast, you must drink a forfeit. Do your best not to scream.”

As soon as these words fell, his hand shook and the white spirit snake shot towards Yang Kai like an arrow from the string before impacting the back of Yang Kai’s hand.

A strange scene happened next. The white spirit snake bit Yang Kai’s skin, then, like smoke, entered into the wound before beginning to shuttle along Yang Kai’s meridians and physique.

In an instant, Yang Kai’s body trembled violently as an unbearable pain came from his muscles and meridians, causing his face to turn bright red.

If it weren’t for his strong willpower, Yang Kai would have cried out miserably.

“Brother Yang!” Liu Xian Yun called out; worried Yang Kai might encounter some kind of accident.

A low roar, like that of a wounded beast, burst from Yang Kai’s throat as he turned a scarlet gaze towards Yan Xiu Ran in front of him.

Yan Xiu Ran showed no fear as he simply laughed loudly, “Don’t worry, you won’t die. My Treasure Seizing Snake has no offensive ability, all it can do is take out artifacts from others’ bodies. After it takes away your artifacts, you can just heal yourself naturally.”

[It seems to be true...]

Yang Kai felt his heart clench. The purpose of this spirit snake was exactly the same as he had previously guessed, it was actually able to arbitrarily snatch other people’s artifacts. Realizing this, his heart sank.
