Chapter 898, Flying Heavens Shuttle

*Xiu xiu xiu...*

The sound of something slicing through the air rang out as the long shuttle seemed to break through the constraints of space and instantly move from one position to another.

After experimenting with it a few times, Yang Kai’s eyes gradually filled with light as he felt he had uncovered the mystery of this artifact.

Reaching out, the long shuttle returned to his hand again. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Yang Kai once again carefully examined it.

His Divine Sense wandering back and forth inside the long shuttle, Yang Kai carefully examined every minute detail of it.

The long shuttle was quite small, but when Yang Kai sent his Divine Sense into it, it felt as if he was probing a vast space with no end in sight.

As he probed around, some basic information flowed back from the long shuttle into Yang Kai’s mind.

Flying Heavens Shuttle...

This was apparently the name of this artifact. Simply inferring from its name, Yang Kai had basically confirmed that this long shuttle’s purpose was transportation.

In order words, this was a special flight type artifact.

There were many different types of artifacts which came in all kinds of varieties, but in general, artifacts could mainly be divided into three categories: Offensive, defensive, and auxiliary. Of course, there were some artifacts that fit into more than one of these categories; for example, Yang Kai’s Silver Leaf was both an offensive and defensive artifact.

Depending on what kind of energy was required to drive them, artifacts could also be divided into ordinary artifacts which consumed True Qi, or Soul type artifacts which were powered by one’s Spiritual Energy.

The latter’s value was generally much larger than the former’s and was also significantly more difficult to refine.

Amongst auxiliary type artifacts, there was a special classification which was dedicated to transportation: Flight type artifacts. In general, a flight type artifact could reach speeds much greater than an ordinary cultivator of the same grade.

Yang Kai had also encountered a lot of different flight type artifacts, some shaped like swords, some like birds, some like carriages, etc...

However, this was the first time he had encountered one shaped like a long shuttle.

At first glance, this long shuttle looked like a miniature boat.

Inside the Flying Heavens Shuttle, there was no trace of any offensive type Spirit Arrays, which meant it had no attack power, and while there was a defence type Spirit Array, its strength was difficult to determine just by observing.

Yang Kai continued to probe inside the shuttle.

After reaching a certain depth, Yang Kai discovered something unusual.

Deep inside the Flying Heavens Shuttle, there was an empty space surrounded by many twinkling points of light. When his consciousness floated at the centre of this space, Yang Kai almost felt like he had returned to the vast Starry Sky.

This empty space was like a miniaturized model of the Starry Sky that had been placed inside the Flying Heavens Shuttle.

There were also a number of small thin lines connecting various different points of light together.

Yang Kai’s brow furrowed slightly, not sure what this strange space was for.

Following along one of these connecting lines, Yang Kai felt more and more that the Flying Heavens Shuttle contained a small model of the Starry Sky inside it.

However, what made him feel unsatisfied was that the line he was tracing broke at a certain point. Apparently, after drifting through the Starry Sky for so long, the lines in this model had become damaged, so Yang Kai could not figure out what the endpoint of this path was.

Shaking his head, Yang Kai continued investigating the Flying Heavens Shuttle until he determined there was nothing else to discover inside it before taking back his Divine Sense.

Although this artifact had lost a great deal of its internal information, it was still able to play its most basic role after being nourished for so long.

Driven by his curiosity, Yang Kai immediately got up and left the Holy Master Court.

Pouring his True Qi into it, the Flying Heavens Shuttle expanded rapidly, eventually becoming several meters in length and quietly floating in front of Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded his head in satisfaction upon seeing this.

Since flight type artifacts were meant to carry people, it was impossible its true size was only as big as his palm. Yang Kai didn’t know which Artifact Refiner had created this artifact but it was clear they had included a profound Spirit Array that allowed its size to be manipulated.

However, several meters seemed to be the upper limit. Eyeballing it, Yang Kai estimated that this Flying Heavens Shuttle was capable of carrying seven or eight people max.

Sending a command with his Divine Sense, the Flying Heavens Shuttle shrank back down to about two meters in length and a transparent blue hue emerged to cover it, forming a kind of protective barrier.

Yang Kai leapt up onto the shuttle and sat down, the blue light screen expanding to just cover him, leaving no gaps, as if it was tailor-made for him.

Excitement filling his heart, Yang Kai fully pushed his True Qi.

A blue light flashed and in the next moment, Yang Kai and the Flying Heavens Shuttle disappeared.

Atop one of the nine peaks, the Great Commanders of the Ancient Demon Clan were in meditative cultivation. Recently, Yang Kai didn’t have anything for them to do, so after obtaining a lot of cultivation resources from Xu Hui, all of the leaders spent their time tirelessly trying to improve their strength.

Suddenly, Li Rong’s brow furrowed and she awoke from her meditation, her tender body flickering and in the next instant reappeared high up in the sky, her beautiful eyes staring suspiciously towards a distant point on the horizon.

Immediately, Han Fei and Hua Mo also appeared beside her.

“Was that Master’s aura just now?” Han Fei also stared towards the horizon and muttered.

“En, it seems Master has gone out,” Li Rong nodded lightly, “But this speed... it’s too fast.”

Just as she finished speaking these words, Li Rong’s brow furrowed, “He’s already left the range of my senses.”

Li Rong was a Second-Order Saint Realm master, so the range of her Divine Sense was several hundred kilometers, but from the time she detected Yang Kai’s aura until now, only three breaths of time had elapsed, yet in that short a time, he had already left the scope of her sensation.

Such speed was simply astonishing, far beyond anything she had ever even heard of before.

“What do you think Master is going out to do this time?” Hua Mo asked in confusion.

“I don’t know.”

“Should we follow and escort him...” Hua Mo asked hesitantly.

“We don’t even know where he is anymore, how are we supposed to follow him?” Li Rong smiled wryly, “Forget it, at that speed, I’m afraid no one in this world could catch up to him anyways.”

Listening to her say this, Han Fei and Hua Mo also relaxed. If no one could catch up to Yang Kai, naturally he wouldn’t be in any danger.

Just as the three Great Commanders noticed Yang Kai’s sudden departure, outside the nine peaks, a large number of the cultivators who had come to request Alchemy services from the Holy Land also noticed something and looked towards the sky.

A moment ago, a faint pale blue streak had passed over their heads but by the time they released their Divine Senses to investigate this phenomenon, the streak of light had already disappeared.

This discovery stunned everyone.

Among the cultivators present, there were a number of very powerful masters, yet in front of this strange blue streak, all of them were rendered helpless.

Their faces paling slightly, many of them wondered just which great powerhouse had used such a profound method to fly passed them.

However, none of them could find any clues.

Midair, Yang Kai’s face was filled with joy as he could hardly believe what he was currently experiencing.

The scenery beneath him was flowing past him like a raging river, receding behind him rapidly. The speed he was currently travelling at was simply indescribable; it was exaggerated to the point where even his eyes could not keep up with the changing landscape. Every time he tried to focus on some landmark or landform, it would disappear behind him in the next instant.

The speed of the Flying Heavens Shuttle greatly exceeded his expectations.

Yang Kai’s personal speed was not slow, and if he used his Wind and Thunder Wings, even a Second Order Saint may not be able to catch up to him.

But the speed he was traveling at right now far, far exceeded that, surpassing the limits of this world, almost as if he was constantly tearing space.

In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai crossed hundreds of kilometres.

What was most unbelievable to Yang Kai though, was that the True Qi he consumed in order to activate and operate the Heavens Flying Shuttle was very small, and because of the protection of the blue light screen, he was essentially unaffected by the wind, allowing him to sit, lie down, or even stand up without the slightest discomfort.

Feeling a great sense of joy in his heart, Yang Kai not only didn’t stop but instead continued pushing the Flying Heavens Shuttle faster and faster.

Gradually, as he became more and more familiar with this artifact, Yang Kai was able to manoeuvre it freely even while soaring forward at lightning-fast speeds.

Yang Kai was ecstatic.

Watching the world flow backwards beneath his feet filled him with a sense of unparalleled freedom.

It was only after about half a day that this sense of excitement gradually calmed down and Yang Kai slowed his flight speed.

Scanning his surroundings, Yang Kai saw a land of ice and snow off in the distance, a scenery that felt oddly familiar to him.

Staring at this landscape for a while, his brow began to furrow slightly.

A moment later, as he continued moving forward, a huge city appeared before him.

Seeing this city, Yang Kai’s expression became even more amazed.

Arriving at the city after an incense stick worth of time, Yang Kai saw many streets and buildings he was familiar with.

Grand Boulder City!

He had actually travelled all the way to Grand Boulder City, which was a few hundred thousand kilometres away from Nine Heavens Holy Land!

Yang Kai’s expression fluctuated between disbelief and shock.

When he had last left this place in order to bring the Ancient Demon Clan to Nine Heavens Holy Land, it had taken him two whole months to complete the journey.

Of course, with the large number of Ancient Demon clansmen, it was impossible to travel too quickly, but even if Yang Kai was alone and moved at maximum speed, it would still have taken him around twenty or thirty days to reach the nine peaks from here.

But now, it had only taken him less than a day to return from there!

Strictly speaking, about ten hours had passed since Yang Kai left the Holy Land.

There was absolutely no comparison between the two.

At this moment, Yang Kai recognized just how terrifying the speed of the Flying Heavens Shuttle was and just how precious this flight type artifact really was.

With this artifact, it would be extremely convenient for him to go anywhere he wanted to.

Taking the artifact back into his body, Yang Kai landed nearby the city gates and walked to the Alchemist Guild branch.

Du Wan was obviously still back in Nine Heavens Holy Land right now, so only Ye Xiong, Mi Na, and Wu’er were left here in Grand Boulder City.

All of them were quite surprised by Yang Kai’s sudden arrival but they still happily welcomed him.

Yang Kai didn’t spend much time in the Alchemist Guild, spending only about a day lecturing Wu’er and Mi Na about Alchemy before gifting them a few basic Spirit Arrays and taking his leave.

Next, he went to Soaring Heaven Sect.

Currently, Yang Kai was the Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land, so he had very little time for leisure, or to travel long distances. Since he had accidentally arrived here now though, naturally he had to pay a visit to his Martial Seniors and Ancestral Founder.

When Yang Kai arrived at Serene Resplendent Peak and walked inside, he immediately came across his Martial Aunt Fei Yu, sprawled out across a stone table, her face dyed red, her clothes in disarray, exposing a great deal of her smooth jade white skin, with several empty bottles scattered about.

Fei Yu’s cultivated a Water Attribute Secret Art, so she was not just drinking alcohol for fun but was actually refining the alcohol into her body to enhance the potency of her True Qi.

Yang Kai had long ago noticed this, but he still couldn’t help feeling a sense of helplessness about her alcoholism.
