“The Old Ancestor is wounded.” Before Yang Kai could inquire about the matter, Zhong Liang took the initiative to explain.

Yang Kai was taken aback! Someone with the title ‘Old Ancestor’ could only be a Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. How could a person like that be wounded!? In the next moment though, he quickly understood, “Was the Old Ancestor injured during the battle with the Black Ink Royal Lord?”

The only one who could harm an Old Ancestor was a Royal Lord from the Black Ink Clan. It would seem that the disturbance caused by the Old Ancestor’s attack that Yang Kai sensed previously when he was in the Black Ink Clan’s territory had belonged to the Old Ancestor of Blue Sky Pass.

Not long after the attack, the Royal Lord had led the Black Ink Clan army in pursuit of the Human army. He probably exchanged blows with the Old Ancestor at the time, which resulted in the Old Ancestor being injured in the process.

Zhong Liang nodded, “The Old Ancestor might be wounded, but that Royal Lord is in no better condition. We have no idea where the enemy’s leader is hiding to treat his wounds at the moment. For the time being, we will have to see who between them recovers first. That will determine the outcome of this battle!”

The strongest combatants on both sides had been injured and were busy recuperating; otherwise, their presence would definitely have been seen on the battlefield. In any case, the one who recovered first would obtain the absolute advantage. That was the reason why Zhong Liang could not be sure whether Yang Kai could gain an audience with the Old Ancestor right now. If this matter was not urgent, Zhong Liang would not have even considered disturbing the Old Ancestor at a time like this; after all, it was extremely important for the Old Ancestor to recover from his wounds. It was just that Yang Kai’s ability to purify Black Ink Strength was also extremely important, so they had to report this matter to the Old Ancestor as soon as possible.

There was a solitary mountain in the middle of Blue Sky Pass that towered high into the clouds. On top of the solitary mountain stood a majestic palace. That was the place where the Old Ancestor cultivated in retreat. He normally lived here in seclusion and rarely revealed himself without a reason.

Flight was not prohibited inside the Inner Sanctum, and it did not take long for Zhong Liang to guide Yang Kai to the palace located at the top of the solitary mountain. There were several figures standing guard outside the palace, and each one of them had a profound aura. Even the weakest among them was in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm. There was also an Eighth-Order Ancestor standing guard in the open, right before the doors, just in case an accident occurred.

Upon detecting movement, the Eighth-Order Ancestor, who had been sitting down cross-legged and resting with his eyes closed, opened his eyes slightly and stood up to block their path.

“Senior Brother Sun!” Zhong Liang stepped forward in greeting.

Senior Brother Sun nodded lightly. Glancing at Yang Kai who was following behind Zhong Liang curiously, he asked, “Junior Brother Zhong, what is so urgent for you to come here?”

As Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Ancestors, Senior Brother Sun believed that Zhong Liang knew better and would not come here at this time unless there was something important.

“I have something to report to the Old Ancestor!” Zhong Liang replied. Stepping forward, he secretly explained the situation in detail to Senior Brother Sun via transmission.

At first, Senior Brother Sun listened with an indifferent expression, but it didn’t take long before his eyes contracted in astonishment. He turned to stare at Yang Kai in shock and anxiously asked, “Is that possible!?”

Zhong Liang nodded solemnly, “Feng Ying told me herself. Besides, those hundreds of people have already entered the Inner Sanctum. The information is trustworthy.”

Senior Brother Sun frowned, “Didn’t you verify the truth with your own eyes?”

Zhong Liang asked, “How do we verify this matter?”

Senior Brother Sun pondered in silence for a moment, “Capture a Black Ink Disciple and bring them back.”

Zhong Liang stared at Senior Brother Sun with his mouth agape, seeming to ask ‘are you serious!?’ with his expression. Even if he was an Eighth-Order Master, it was not easy to capture a Black Ink Disciple alive on that chaotic battlefield.

Senior Brother Sun glared at Zhong Liang, “This is an important matter! It’s better to be careful! Go quickly!”

Helpless, Zhong Liang could only answer, “Fine fine, I’ll go.”

Yang Kai listened to the conversation from the side and vaguely guessed the contents of their conversation. Thus, he immediately cupped his fist and said, “There’s no need to go to so much trouble. If you wish to verify this matter, Senior, this disciple can show you at any time.”

Senior Brother Sun raised a brow at those words, “How will you do that?”

Zhong Liang slapped his forehead, “I forgot, he has Black Ink Strength suppressed and sealed inside his Small Universe!” Turning around, he explained the situation to Senior Brother Sun, “This brat is extremely blessed. He possesses a World Spring, so he does not fear becoming corrupted by Black Ink Strength. Moreover, he is bold and reckless. By suppressing and sealing Black Ink Strength in his Small Universe, he disguised himself as a Black Ink Disciple and lived among the Black Ink Clan for a few years!”

Senior Brother Sun stared at Yang Kai, so shocked that his mouth fell open slightly. This was absolutely astounding information. Even with a World Spring, it was crazy for anybody to suppress and seal Black Ink Strength inside their Small Universe. Not to mention, Yang Kai had disguised himself as a Black Ink Disciple and lived among the Black Ink Clan for several years… Someone who did this could no longer be described as courageous, only reckless would suffice! Nevertheless, this would indeed save them a lot of trouble.

Senior Brother Sun nodded at Yang Kai and said, “This is an important matter. It’s not that I don’t trust you, but I must verify the truth with my own eyes.”

Yang Kai nodded to indicate that he understood. Raising his hand, he opened the portal to his Small Universe and a mass of Black Ink Strength immediately poured out from within.

The Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in charge of protecting this place had no idea what was going on, so they were shocked to see the pitch-black Black Ink Strength. Thinking that a Black Ink Disciple had infiltrated this place, they instinctively pushed their World Force. It was fortunate that Senior Brother Sun stopped them in time.

Senior Brother Sun stared intently at Yang Kai’s movements and soon saw Yang Kai’s hands glowing with two different-coloured lights. When Yang Kai pressed his palms together, the two different-coloured lights transformed into a pure white light!

Zhong Liang raised his brow slightly at the sight. It was that same white light! He had personally witnessed the white light inflicting great harm on the Black Ink Territory Lord he fought earlier. There was no doubt that the Black Ink Territory Lord had shown a panicked expression when enveloped by the white light; however, what he witnessed from afar could not compare to the shock he experienced at this moment. Under his Divine Sense perception, he could tell that the white light was completely pure and flawless.

The white light loomed over the Black Ink Strength, then they came into contact with each other in the next moment. The thick Black Ink Strength quickly vaporized and vanished out of sight. Only the white light remained without disappearing!

The Seventh-Order Masters, who reacted as though they were facing a great enemy earlier, were now dumbfounded by what they just witnessed. Even Senior Brother Sun was shocked beyond words. A long while passed before he said, “Astonishing!”

Although the white light did not contain strong destructive power, it had the effect of purifying the Black Ink Strength. That alone was worthy of his high evaluation.

“Please wait here. I will inform the Old Ancestor of your arrival, but I cannot guarantee whether you will receive a response. The Old Ancestor is in the middle of recovery after all,” Senior Brother Sun said before he turned around and entered the palace.

Zhong Liang and Yang Kai waited patiently; meanwhile, the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters studied Yang Kai intently, as though they were trying to figure out something from his body.

The Black Ink Strength that Yang Kai brought out earlier had already been dispelled, but the white light continued to exist. Zhong Liang couldn’t help feeling curious. Reaching out to touch the light, he discovered that it actually gave off an extremely gentle and comforting feeling.

“Can this still be used?” Zhong Liang asked.

Yang Kai nodded in reply, “It should still be effective, but it won’t last for long.”

Zhong Liang smacked his lips, “That’s such a waste.”

He was tempted to capture a Black Ink Disciple and throw them into the white light. In that way, the Black Ink Strength in the Black Ink Disciple would be dispelled and the Black Ink Disciple would regain mental clarity.

Yang Kai had already noticed this issue some time ago. There were many times when Purifying Light went to waste. Even after dispelling Black Ink Strength from the bodies of the Black Ink Disciples, the effects of the Purifying Light would not dissipate completely depending on its initial intensity. It was obvious that the light could still be used, but he could only let it go to waste as there was nothing to use it on.

It had to be said that the Purifying Light was formed from the power of the Yellow and Blue Crystals; therefore, it was these precious Yin and Yang Element materials that were being wasted.

Not long afterward, Senior Brother Sun returned from inside the palace. Zhong Liang hurriedly looked over only to see Senior Brother Sun shaking his head slowly, “The Old Ancestor did not respond. He is probably at a critical juncture in his recovery.”

There was nothing Zhong Liang could do after hearing that statement; after all, he could not forcibly interrupt the Old Ancestor who was in the midst of healing. If anything were to happen to the Old Ancestor, he would not be able to bear the consequences.

Senior Brother Sun quickly followed up, “When the Old Ancestor comes out of retreat, I will inform him about this matter. In any case, Yang Kai is already in the Inner Sanctum. There’s no need to be anxious.”

Zhong Liang nodded, “That’s the only way.”

“But, what do you plan to do now?” Senior Brother Sun asked.

Naturally, Zhong Liang understood what Senior Brother Sun meant, “This matter cannot be concealed. In any case, it is not something that needs to be concealed either. I plan to announce this information to everyone. This is an uplifting piece of news, especially now that war has broken out. This information will allow the disciples to fight without worries, which will in turn boost their morale.”

Senior Brother Sun pondered for a while, “Good. The problem that has plagued us for so long has been resolved. This will certainly boost morale among the ranks. Do as you see fit.”

Zhong Liang replied, “Then, I will gather those old farts in the conference hall and announce this news to them.”

“Go ahead. I will inform the Old Ancestor about this matter as soon as possible. I’m sure the Old Ancestor will also agree with the plan.”

Zhong Liang cupped his fist and sent a Divine Sense transmission to remind Senior Brother Sun, “Senior Brother, the fact that this boy possesses the World Spring cannot be exposed.”

Senior Brother Sun understood, “Don’t worry. I will take care of it.”

Likewise, Senior Brother Sun understood what Zhong Liang was worried about. If it was revealed that Yang Kai possessed the World Spring, it would surely attract trouble.

Zhong Liang thanked Senior Brother Sun and quickly departed with Yang Kai. Along the way, he took out a communication device and sent out several messages. A short while later, a stream of light sped towards them. A figure was revealed when the stream of light came close. It turned out to be Feng Ying.

“Martial Uncle!” Feng Ying cupped her fist in greeting. It was apparent that she had been summoned by Zhong Liang.

Zhong Liang instructed, “Lead him to the Main Conference Hall and wait for me there. I’ll be there soon.”

“Yes!” She responded. Tilting her head to signal Yang Kai, she led him in a certain direction. On the other hand, Zhong Liang headed towards the outside of the great pass.

Along the way, Feng Ying asked, “Have you met the Old Ancestor?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “The Old Ancestor is recovering, so I didn’t manage to meet him.”

She was taken aback, “Is the Old Ancestor injured!?”

It had not been long since she returned, so she was not informed about the Old Ancestor’s injury.

“I heard Senior Zhong mention that the Royal Lord is in a similar condition. The Royal Lord is currently hiding somewhere to treat his wounds. At present, it all depends on who recovers first. The one who wins this race will hold the absolute advantage on the battlefield.”

Feng Ying nodded lightly. It was not the first time the Old Ancestor of Blue Sky Pass and the Royal Lord of this region had fought each other. Every time the Black Ink Clan launched an assault on Blue Sky Pass, the Royal Lord would step forward to keep the Old Ancestor in check. There was no other choice. The Royal Lord had to join the battle personally; otherwise, no amount of Black Ink Clansmen could ever hope to stop the Old Ancestor if he stood on the front lines.

“Why does Martial Uncle Zhong want you to go to the Main Conference Hall?” She inquired further.

Yang Kai answered, “He seems to believe that word of the Purifying Light will boost morale, so he plans to announce it to everyone.”

Feng Ying instantly understood, “It will certainly be beneficial. Besides, there’s nothing wrong with publicising this information. This matter cannot be hidden anyway. Everybody will know about it sooner or later.”

Yang Kai nodded. He had no intention of hiding this ability as it could restrain Black Ink Strength after all. If this ability could benefit his allies, then he would be happy to cooperate.

It did not take long for the pair to arrive outside a Grand Hall; however, they did not enter and simply waited outside. The hall was empty without a figure in sight, but after waiting for some time, a figure came towards them from a distance and soon landed not far away. The person who arrived was burly and had a head of dishevelled hair, like a raging wild lion.
