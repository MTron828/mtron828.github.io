Inside the hall, Yang Kai’s expression remained calm, but Yang Xiu Zhu and the other two masters from Star Emperor Mountain were extremely excited!

Since ten thousand years ago, when their ancestors had been cut off from Supreme Profound Sect by the Flowing Flame Sand Field, every generation of Star Emperor Mountain had dreamed of returning to their ancestral land. But with the impassible flame barriers of the Flowing Flame Sand Field baring their path, there was simply nothing they could do.

Yang Kai’s proposal had scratched the unscratchable itch Yang Xiu Zhu and the others had always felt.

If they belonged to some other great force, perhaps this offer would not have been of much interest to them. Their ancestors’ legacy belonged to their ancestors, ten thousand years had passed, their current Sect had developed well, and even their name had changed, so why worry about reclaiming their ancestral land?

However, for the people from Star Emperor Mountain, the situation was a little different.

Because of their ideals and beliefs, their very doctrine taught them to revere the Great Emperor above all else!

The Supreme Profound Sect was the Sect supported by the Great Emperor ten thousand years ago, the place where the Great Emperor lived. Star Emperor Mountain, which was founded afterwards, was not comparable to the Supreme Profound Sect.

That piece of land not only represented the heritage of their ancestors, but was the ultimate symbol of their devotion to the Great Emperor.

There was no Star Emperor Mountain cultivator who did not wish to return to their ancestral land to pay homage to the former residence of the Great Emperor!

Yang Kai’s proposal went straight to the hearts of Yang Xiu Zhu and the others and could even be said to be more attractive than the first one he made.

The first proposal was only aimed at the three of them, but this one was for all their Sect Brothers and Sisters.

The three of them looked at each other and clearly saw the intentions in the other’s eyes.

“En, now that Senior Ye is also High Heaven Sect’s Great Elder, and considering that you are descendants of Supreme Profound Sect, it is completely appropriate for you to enter and live there,” Yang Kai struck while the iron was hot.

“Are you not afraid that the guests will seize the role of host for themselves?” Yang Xiu Zhu looked at Yang Kai with gleaming eyes and asked straightforwardly.

“Senior jests, without even mentioning the fact that Great Elder is there, knowing the three Seniors’ conduct and character, Junior has great confidence you will not chase after fame and fortune in such a dishonest manner. There is nothing to worry about.”

“You’re certainly confident enough!” Yang Xiu Zhu nodded, “Fine, we old masters can agree to help you if these are your terms! But we must say in advance, if we and our fellow Star Emperor Mountain companions truly return to the ancestral land, we must request Sect Master Yang to divide a separate area for use to reside in. We will not be joining High Heaven Sect, please understand this, Sect Master Yang.”

“You won’t join?” Yang Kai’s brow twitched as he silently cursed this old dog for being so unamiable. Yang Kai had tried so hard to win them over, even bringing their ancestor into the discussion, because he was planning on ​​merging the many masters of Star Emperor Mountain into High Heaven Sect, but his intentions had clearly been seen through and cut off right from the start.

This made Yang Kai somewhat disgruntled.

A mountain cannot accommodate two tigers. Although Yang Kai was not worried about these people really having ill intentions towards High Heaven Sect, there being so many Origin Returning Realm masters from Star Emperor Mountain he could not control was not a scenario Yang Kai wanted to see.

If that were the case, it would be difficult to guarantee that there would be no friction and conflict between the two forces over time.

Thinking so, Yang Kai showed a look of regret, “Fine then, since Senior has made such a request, Junior naturally has no reason to refuse, but... it’s a pity!”

“What’s a pity?” Yang Xiu Zhu knew that Yang Kai was up to some kind of scheme, but he still couldn’t help feeling curious, so he asked suspiciously.

“It’s nothing,” Yang Kai chuckled, “I was just thinking that if you joined High Heaven Sect, in time, you may have an opportunity to see the Great Emperor, but if you insist on remaining separate...”

“What?” Yang Xiu Zhu was thoroughly shocked, while Lin Yu Rao and Chu Han Yi also showed looks of astonishment.

“Sect Master Yang, what do you mean by this?” Lin Yu Rao’s tender body leaned in slightly.

“Didn’t Great Elder tell you?” Yang Kai turned his head to Ye Xi Yun, keeping the three of them in suspense.

Ye Xi Yun slowly shook her head, understanding Yang Kai’s plan but not planning on spoiling it, simply smiling as she said, “This is a matter of utmost importance, this Queen didn’t dare to reveal it lightly.”

“En, fair enough, this kind of secret really cannot be casually divulged. The fewer people who know the better,” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

“Sect Master Yang, what you said just now... what do you mean?” Yang Xiu Zhu asked eagerly, an anxious expression filling his face, “Why does it sound like... the Great Emperor is now... in High Heaven Sect?”

When he spoke these words, even he found himself taken aback and quickly shook his head in disbelief. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Senior is correct, the Great Emperor is indeed in High Heaven Sect right now!” Yang Kai grinned.

“How can that be?” Yang Xiu Zhu and the others suddenly jumped out of their chairs, their bodies trembling and looks of pure shock covering their faces.

“Junior has no need to deceive you, but you can just ask Great Elder if you don’t believe me,” Yang Kai motioned.

The three instantly cast their eyes on Ye Xi Yun, who simply nodded lightly.

Yang Xiu Zhu was flabbergasted, the shock of this news hit him like a ten-thousand-ton hammer to his forehead, causing him to completely lose composure and become unresponsive for quite some time.

After all, the Great Emperor was a legendary figure from ancient history. Although Yang Xiu Zhu and the others always believed that the Great Emperor was still alive and sleeping in some secret place, that was just a belief, in the end.

When beliefs become reality, even those who believed in them would have doubts. This was only natural when confronting a situation where all one’s hopes, or fears, could become true.

“Do you have proof?” Lin Yu Rao called out haltingly, “Is there some way we can prove your words are true? Even with Great Elder as a guarantor, this is not a truth we can easily believe. We must ask Sect Master Yang to show us some evidence.”

Yang Xiu Zhu and Chu Han Yi also seemed to recover from their shock and nodded firmly.

“What kind of proof do you want?” Yang Kai laughed.

“Anything is fine. As long as you can prove that this matter is true... This old master and his companions will agree to join High Heaven Sect, without hesitation!” Yang Xiu Zhu burst out with a ferocious expression that declared he would not let Yang Kai go easily if he did not produce sufficient proof of his words.

If the Great Emperor was truly in High Heaven Sect, would there be any shame in joining it?

If this was so, even if Yang Kai was not trying to win them over, they would take the initiative to beg him for the opportunity to join!

“Without even mentioning if I have any proof, even if I do and I took it out, could you recognize it?” Yang Kai smiled contemptuously.

“Whether or not we can recognize and accept is a matter we have the ability to judge, but if Sect Master Yang is simply making wild claims, this old master will not be forgiving!”

Yang Kai brow furrowed slightly, not having expected things to develop in this way, and for a moment he felt somewhat helpless as he did not have anything. He couldn’t think of anything he could use as evidence to back up his claims.

However, in a flash of inspiration, Yang Kai thought of something and let out a laugh, “If that’s the case, then I may be able to satisfy you.”

Saying so, something suddenly appeared in the palm of his hand and he held it high.

A potent Emperor Pressure suddenly filled the hall.

Everyone’s expressions changed dramatically when they saw this object.

After gawking for a moment, Yang Xiu Zhu called out in alarm, “Star Emperor Token! An actual Star Emperor Token!”

It was not that he had never seen a Star Emperor Token before. Star Emperor Mountain possessed two Star Emperor Tokens in the past, one of which was enshrined in Star Emperor Mountain’s grand hall and was treated as a symbol of the Great Emperor for all Star Emperor Mountain cultivators paid homage to.

The other Star Emperor Token served as the status symbol of Star Emperor Mountain’s Sect Master and was passed down from one Sect Master to the next.

Of course, the latter Star Emperor Token was taken away by Ye Xi Yun when she was driven from Star Emperor Mountain and had now fallen into Yang Kai’s hands.

Yang Xiu Zhu had naturally visited the grand hall many times to worship the Great Emperor’s status symbol, so he was no stranger to Star Emperor Tokens.

However, the Star Emperor Tokens he had seen had all lost their power.

The piece in Yang Kai’s hand right now was complete, that is to say, the Divine Ability of the Great Emperor was still sealed within it, a legendary power great enough to easily kill an Origin King Realm master!

Yang Xiu Zhu’s eyes trembled violently.

Even Ye Xi Yun’s expression became solemn.

Both Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu’s eyes bulged as they stared.

None of them had imagined Yang Kai still possessed such a Heaven defying card!

With this token, he could easily wipe out Star Emperor Mountain and unify Shadowed Star.

Along with the shock they felt, Yang Xiu Zhu and the others became extremely frightened, as they could not help imaging what would happen if they had refused to help Yang Kai and forced him to use extreme measures. If he had decided to use this Star Emperor Token to deal with Star Emperor Mountain, it was likely that none of their two hundred Brothers and Sisters would have survived.

“This Star Emperor Token was handed to me personally by the Great Emperor, as for whether you believe me or not, it’s up to you. Yes, besides this thing, there are some secrets the Great Emperor told me that may serve as evidence to support my claim.”

“Please continue, Sect Master Yang!” Yang Xiu Zhu no longer dared to underestimate Yang Kai, even adopting a respectful tone and expression.

“The Great Emperor explained to me that the Flowing Flame Sand Field is nothing more than one of her Emperor Artifacts, the Three Blazing Flame Rings! I’m sure many of you elders have been to the Flowing Flame Sand Field before and know about its details. The three flame rings combined make up a single Emperor Artifact. As for the first Flame Area disappearing some time ago, it was all because the Great Emperor collected it.”

The jaws of everyone in the room dropped.

When had they heard such sensational secrets?

Even Ye Xi Yun did not know that the Flowing Flame Sand Field was actually made up of a single Emperor Artifact, and her eyes couldn’t help lighting up.

The existence of the Three Blazing Flame Rings was mentioned in Star Emperor Mountain’s ancient records and was rumoured to have been the artifact the Great Emperor most relied upon.

With the Great Emperor’s unfathomable abilities, it was not unimaginable that she could transform her artifact into one of Shadowed Star’s Forbidden Zones.

“Sect Master Yang means to say... the disappearance of the first layer Flame Area was because the Great Emperor personally collected that ring flame?” Yang Xiu Zhu asked with a trembling voice.

“En, this Sect Master witnessed it with his own eyes.” Yang Kai nodded.

Gasps sounded throughout the hall.

Everyone present fully understood just how terrifying that Flame Area was. When the Flowing Flame Sand Field closed, anyone who so much as stepped into the Flame Area would die, even if they were a peak Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master.

When the first layer Flame Area disappeared, all of Shadowed Star went into an uproar as no one could understand why the outermost layer of the Flowing Flame Sand Field would simply vanish. Almost coincidentally, High Heaven Sect became that region’s master a short time after.

Now, the people here had learned the truth of the matter from Yang Kai.

Despite how sensational this story was, it was difficult not to believe this story!

Even taking the entire Star Field into consideration, who else would have such immeasurable ability besides the Great Emperor?

At this moment, Yang Xiu Zhu and the others were about eighty percent convinced Yang Kai was telling the truth, the remaining twenty percent simply being a measure of natural cautious scepticism.

“Dare I ask... the relationship between Sect Master Yang and the Great Emperor...” Lin Yu Rao asked cautiously.

“Would you believe me if I told you she was a close female friend?” Yang Kai laughed.”

“Haha...” Yang Xiu Zhu’s face twitched as he let out a hollow laugh.
