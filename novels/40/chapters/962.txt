Chapter 963, Demon Eye Fusion

Inside Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea, something unexpected had occurred.

Just after he finished viewing Great Demon God’s memories of exploring the Starry Sky, a burst of energy suddenly flooded in.

His entire Knowledge Sea was whipped up into a storm and the Six Coloured Soul Warming Lotus island which was floating atop the water was tossed about, in danger of being submerged at any time.

Yang Kai focused his efforts on stabilizing his Knowledge Sea but was unable to calm the chaos.

This flood of energy was like a great burst of wind and lightning that tore up his Knowledge Sea, making him feel very uncomfortable.

The Demon Eye of Annihilation, which hovered just above his Knowledge Sea, suddenly emitted a strong suction and inhaled all the rampaging energy, dying his entire Knowledge Sea black in the next breath.

This was Yang Kai’s personal domain, where he was the absolute master. Whatever he ordered or imagined would be, whether it was changing the scenery or completely rearranging the layout.

But after the Demon Eye of Annihilation swallowed up this torrent of energy, Yang Kai discovered that he had actually lost control of his Knowledge Sea.

It was as if his Soul Avatar was falling through an abyss that went on forever, without any bottom to it, causing him a good deal of fear.

In this darkness, only the golden light emitted by the Demon Eye of Annihilation illuminated his view.

His Soul Avatar was shrouded in a golden hallow and gave him the terrifying impression that he had been swallowed by it.

The Demon Eye of Annihilation’s golden light restrained all forms of Spiritual Energy; there were many masters killed by Yang Kai whose remnant Souls had been drawn into this place and then purified by this golden light.

It had never harmed Yang Kai before.

But this time was different, Yang Kai faintly felt that if he didn’t do something quickly, he would meet the same fate as all those people, his Soul purified, leaving behind only a mass of pure Spiritual Energy.

If that came to pass, there was no way he would survive.

As he was going all out to resist, Yang Kai suddenly saw a six-coloured point of light in the darkness and hurriedly rushed over towards it! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

A moment later, his Soul Avatar set foot on the six-coloured island.

Atop this six coloured island, innumerable tiny Soul Devouring Insects were resting. After absorbing the energies in this place for so long, these Soul Devouring Insects seemed stronger than ever.

Yang Kai didn’t pay any attention to them and instead focused his Divine Sense, ordering the six coloured island to return to its original Soul Warming Lotus appearance, then wrapping his Soul Avatar up in its petals.

The rays of golden light continued to pour out, making the Demon Eye of Annihilation shine like a hot sun, evaporating the Spiritual Energy inside Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea, quickly drying it up.

An indescribable pain welled up from the innermost depths of his soul.

Yang Kai clenched his teeth and stimulated the power of the Soul Warming Lotus to continuously replenish the power he was losing from his Knowledge Sea.

Gradually, the pain grew faint, and Yang Kai was surprised to find that he had established a kind of connection with the Demon Eye of Annihilation which should originally have belonged to Great Demon God.

Since obtaining the Demon Eye of Annihilation, Yang Kai had been trying to refine it but had never had any success.

Although he could use the purification power of the Demon Eye of Annihilation, fundamentally, this single golden eye was a foreign object that coexisted in his Knowledge Sea, not something he truly owned and commanded.

It was completely different from the Six Coloured Soul Warming Lotus.

After experiencing this excruciating pain though, he had really connected with the Demon Eye of Annihilation; the power which had been evaporated from his Knowledge Sea had formed a bridge between him and the Demon Eye of Annihilation, joining the two together and finally allowing it to recognize him as its master.

Perceiving this, Yang Kai suddenly cheered up.

Continuously motivating the power of the Soul Warming Lotus, Yang Kai filled his Knowledge Sea with new seawater which was quickly evaporated and absorbed by the Demon Eye of Annihilation.

As time went by, the pain in his Soul became lighter and lighter, until it eventually disappeared altogether, replaced by a relaxed and uplifting feeling.

At that moment, Yang Kai felt that the Demon Eye of Annihilation had truly become his.

The Demon Eye of Annihilation, which had always been suspended midair, then turned into a streak of light that shot towards Yang Kai.

Surrounded by the petals of the Six Coloured Soul Warming Lotus, Yang Kai stared intently at the Demon Eye of Annihilation, allowing it to rush into his Soul Avatar and disappear without putting up any resistance.

The world suddenly became somewhat different, and a subtle type of joy rose inside his heart.

Back inside the white space, Yang Kai’s eyes shot open.

As an aching sensation spread from his left eye, Yang Kai noticed Meng Wu Ya and the others nearby staring at him with concern.

“Yang Kai, what happened?” Meng Wu Ya hurriedly asked.

As soon as these words came out though, Treasurer Meng let out a cry of surprise as he pointed to Yang Kai and said, “Your left eye...”

His left eye was no longer their original black and white, but had instead turned golden and was now emitting an endless aura of majesty. This eye gave off a feeling of indifference, as if it was overlooking all mortal beings, just like those of Great Demon God’s Soul Clone which Meng Wu Ya had met before.

Vaguely, an invisible vortex emerged from the golden eye that madly pulled at Meng Wu Ya’s Soul, seemingly wanting to swallow it whole, causing his Soul to rapidly become unstable.

Treasurer Meng’s complexion paled as he quickly removed his gaze and shouted, “Close your left eye!”

Yang Kai was also startled by this and soon realized what was happening, reaching out in the next instant to cover his left eye.

Yang Kai felt a hot and wet sensation on the palm of his hand and a faint smell of blood soon reached his nose.

Only now did Li Rong, Han Fei, and Old Demon let out a long breath, their eyes overflowing with shock and amazement.

“Young Master, what happened to your left eye?” Old Demon asked in a flurry, “The Soul of Old Servant was almost sucked away by it.”

“The Demon Eye of Annihilation! Great Demon God’s Demon Eye of Annihilation!” Zhang Yuan called out in alarm. Even though they were separated by quite a distance, when he had glanced over at Yang Kai a moment ago, he too felt his Soul being tugged at.

It was as if he had been personally facing Great Demon God, the pressure was as heavy as a mountain!

The four Demon Generals also looked deathly pale as they directed complicated looks towards Yang Kai.

Great Demon God possessed all kinds of Divine Abilities, one of which was embedded in his left eye and had the capability to release golden light which could erase an enemy’s Soul. Ancient records stated at the left eye of Great Demon God could see through all mysteries and secrets of the world while restraining the Soul of any it gazed upon.

Zhang Yuan had never imagined that after a few thousand years, the Demon Eye of Annihilation would reappear in this world.

What’s more, in the body of a human boy!

This made him quite depressed.

He couldn’t understand why this little brat Yang Kai was so lucky.

“I need to retreat here for a while!” Yang Kai declared as he covered his eye and wiped away the blood dripping from it.

Meng Wu Ya nodded. The golden eye was far too dangerous. If Yang Kai could not control it freely, anyone who got close to him in the future would be in extreme danger.

“You seclude yourself here, we’ll leave first. When you exit, we’ll discuss these matters again,” Meng Wu Ya said solemnly before turning to look at Zhang Yuan, “Do you have any problem with that?”

Zhang Yuan shook his head.

Yang Kai then summoned the Demon Mystic Tome, opened the exit, and let the others out first.

After they left, Yang Kai immediately immersed himself in studying the Demon Eye of Annihilation.

....

Time flew by and one month later, Demon Commander Zhang Yuan, the four Demon Generals, Meng Wu Ya, and the two Great Commanders were waiting anxiously.

During this last month, while Yang Kai was in retreat, they were essentially idle.

However, just now, they suddenly sensed Yang Kai’s aura appear and understand that he should have succeeded. All of them rushed to Zhang Yuan’s courtyard and stared at the entrance to the secret room.

After a short time, they heard the steady sound of footsteps.

A moment later, Yang Kai’s figure appeared before their eyes, and everyone unconsciously glanced towards his left eye while feeling a slight lingering fear. But they soon discovered that his eyes had both been restored to their normal state, becoming plain black and white.

“Succeeded?” Meng Wu Ya hurriedly asked.

“En,” Yang Kai gently nodded.

After a month of hard work, he was now able to summon and retract the Demon Eye of Annihilation at will. This single Divine Ability of Great Demon God’s had greatly enhanced his combat effectiveness.

“Since Holy Master Yang has exited, we should discuss the scenes we all witnessed,” Zhang Yuan didn’t want to go too deeply into the issue of the Demon Eye of Annihilation, his tone still containing traces of bitterness.

Everyone looked around at each other and nodded.

All of them had been mulling over this issue for the past month and were eager to discuss it now.

Inside a large hall, the Demon Race sat on one side of a large table while Yang Kai’s group sat on the opposite.

After a short silence, Zhang Yuan lightly coughed and stared the conversation, “I assume that everything this Senior witnessed in that space was also seen by all of you.”

Everyone nodded.

“Great Demon God did fall, not because he encountered some kind of accident in the Starry Sky, but rather to protect Tong Xuan Realm,” Zhang Yuan said with a sigh, “Sir Great Demon God is indeed worthy of respect!”

Meng Wu Ya snorted, “For a man who died thousands of years ago, there’s no need to speak such flatteries.”

Zhang Yuan stared at him indifferently, “This was a monumental achievement for Sir Great Demon God, no one can deny that. If he had not fought so selflessly in the past, this world would have already fallen to those alien invaders.”

“Say whatever you’d like,” Meng Wu Ya snorted again. Although he did not like the Demon Race, it was undeniable that Great Demon God’s actions had changed the fate of Tong Xuan Realm.

Unfortunately, the Bone Race had not actually died out. Although the message left by Great Demon God said that all the visitors from the Starry Sky had died, there must have been some from the Bone Race who had managed to escape Great Demon God’s sight and hide.

After thousands of years, they were now reviving.

“Thanks to Sir Great Demon God, we now know there is a realm above the Saint Realm, the Saint King Realm!” Zhang Yuan declared with emotion, “Sir Great Demon God also reached the Saint King Realm!”

It was precisely because he had achieved such a level of strength that even experts like Meng Wu Ya and Zhang Yuan could not crack the barriers and arrays left behind by Great Demon God.

The huge gap in strength had rendered them powerless.

“Among those alien invaders, there were also a number of Saint King powerhouses, but all of them were killed by Great Demon God during that war!”

“What I don’t understand is why Sir Great Demon God used all the Void Corridor across the world to set up a Grand Spirit Array to seal the entire Tong Xuan Realm,” Meng Ge asked curiously.

“Because he realized the danger those Starry Sky invaders posed!” Yang Kai said solemnly, “The method Great Demon God used in the past was more than just a seal, it was likely a kind of concealment array. Among those Starry Sky cultivators, there were multiple masters at the Saint King Realm, and Great Demon God knew that once he died, if such a master were to arrive in Tong Xuan Realm in the future, no one would be able to resist them. As such, he arranged that Grand Spirit Array to let Tong Xuan Realm fade out of sight from the Starry Sky. This way, if any Starry Sky cultivators passed nearby Tong Xuan Realm, they would be unable to sense it, creating a layer of protection for this world.”
