When Yang Kai tried to snatch the bride, all the Dragons were disdainful of him; when Yang Kai transformed into an 80-metre-long Half-Dragon, all the Dragon Clan members were amazed; when Yang Kai tore Fu Chi’s arms apart, all the Dragons were furious, as they couldn’t turn a blind eye to it after their fellow clansman was humiliated.

However, when this man and woman appeared, the expressions on all the Dragon Clan members’ faces changed drastically, as though they were faced with formidable enemies.

It was the same for the Fourth Elder. With a stern expression, he said through gritted teeth, “Jiu Feng! Li Wu Yi!”

The two Masters who had come over to this place through the Void Corridor were none other than Jiu Feng and Li Wu Yi from Spirit Beast Island. Putting Jiu Feng aside, Li Wu Yi was a Master of the Dao of Space who was widely known as the strongest in the Star Boundary below the Great Emperors. As such, it was no surprise he could bring a few people with him to shuttle the Void.

Judging from the expressions and attitude of the Dragon Clan members, it seemed that there were grudges between them. All the Dragon Clan members were gnashing their teeth together, as though they were ready to pounce on them and eat their flesh.

Yang Kai asked in shock, “Seniors, why are you here?”

With a faint smile, Li Wu Yi took a look at him, “One should never be ungrateful. Have you forgotten the favour I did you already?”

Not understanding what Li Wu Yi meant, Yang Kai appeared startled. However, he soon thought of something as his gaze brightened. Surprised, he asked, “Were you the one who left the Soul Clone behind?”

Li Wu Yi smiled faintly, “Good.”

“I see.” Finally understanding what had happened, Yang Kai cupped his fists, “Many thanks for your guidance, Senior.”

Previously, when Yang Kai and Li Jiao were trying to break into Dragon Island, they were trapped inside the Void Labyrinth, and they couldn’t find a way through it. It was only after a month of wandering aimlessly that they came across a degrading Soul Clone that guided them out of the labyrinth. If it weren’t because of that faint Soul Clone, they would have been trapped inside the labyrinth even now.

Yang Kai couldn’t figure out who was the one that had left behind that Soul Clone, but upon hearing what Li Wu Yi said, he finally knew that it was the latter’s doing. It was no wonder that he found the Soul Clone’s image familiar at that time.

Li Wu Yi waved his hand and replied, “It was the least I could do. Anyway, I have to thank you as well.”

“Thank me?” Yang Kai was puzzled.

Without explaining anything, Li Wu Yi turned to look at Zhu Kong and uttered, “Fourth Elder, it’s been more than ten years since we last met. It’s good that you still look so energetic.”

In response, Zhu Kong snorted. There hadn’t been much emotion on his face when Yang Kai tried to snatch the bribe and harmed a Dragon Clan member; however, facing Li Wu Yi now, he appeared wary and alert. Without replying to him directly, he simply asked, “Since you two are here, does that mean that person has come as well?”

Li Wu Yi replied with a light smile, “Why do you think the Great Elder and Second Elder had to go over there together?”

Although the Fourth Elder had figured the reason, his expression still dropped when his speculation was proven right.

“That person?” Yang Kai arched his brow. Although the conversation between Li Wu Yi and Zhu Kong sounded simple, a profound message was hidden in it. Then, when he recalled that the Great Elder and the Second Elder left in a hurry earlier, an inconceivable idea suddenly sprang to mind.

After that, he shifted his attention to the little girl.

Liu Yan quickly used her Divine Sense to speak directly into Yang Kai’s mind, “Martial Beast Great Emperor is here!”

Yang Kai was stunned for a moment before he turned elated. It was then he understood the reason Zhu Yan and Fu Zhun didn’t even have the time to deal with him. It was because the Martial Beast Great Emperor had arrived on Dragon Island. Faced with a Great Emperor, neither the Great Elder nor the Second Elder were confident of defeating him one on one, which was why they had to join forces to deal with him.

Puzzled, Yang Kai asked, “Why has Senior Martial Beast come to Dragon Island and even gone to the Dragon Grave?”

Liu Yan replied, “I don’t know the reason either, but this matter is clearly important to him.”

Although Liu Yan had been living on Spirit Beast Island for the past two years, she spent most of her time trying to integrate with the Phoenix True Fire. After she was reborn, she had been diligently cultivating the Phoenix Clan’s Secret Arts and Secret Techniques, so she wasn’t familiar with other matters on Spirit Beast Island.

This time, she got wind of the news and followed the other Masters to Dragon Island.

[Martial Beast Great Emperor… Dragon Grave… The incident more than ten years ago…] As these ideas flashed across Yang Kai’s mind, he realized that things were getting complicated. Nevertheless, the turn of events had put him in a favourable position now.

Initially, there were only four of them, so their collective power was still not enough for them to deal with the Dragon Clan. However, with the support of these people from Spirit Beast Island, the balance had been tilted in his favour.

Li Wu Yi and the others’ attitude suggested that they were the opponents of the Dragon Clan. Since Li Wu Yi was the Dragon Clan’s enemy, it essentially meant that he was Yang Kai’s ally.

After her initial outburst when she appeared, Jiu Feng had kept her silence. At that moment, she was darting her beautiful gaze around and scanning the surroundings. When she traded glances with Yang Kai, she even winked at him.

Although she appeared calm, she felt somewhat complicated in her heart.

She still recalled the first time she came across Yang Kai. At that time, he had just reached Dao Source Realm when she intercepted him on the way to Azure Sun Temple. In her eyes, he was just a Junior who had some decent luck, allowing him to cultivate the Dao of Space just like Li Wu Yi had. Nevertheless, at that point in time, she still could end his life with a wave of her hand.

However, only a few years later, she was no longer able to look at him in an aloof manner. His immense figure contained an unimaginable power, so naturally, she had to treat him as an equal now.

The speed at which Yang Kai had grown was incredible. It was the first time Jiu Feng saw the qualities of a Great Emperor in a First-Order Emperor Realm Master.

“Fourth Elder, you probably shouldn’t worry about it. Both of us have no right to interfere in the matter over there, so why don’t we take this opportunity and continue the unfinished battle more than ten years ago? What do you think?” Unlike the Fourth Elder, whose expression was solemn, Li Wu Yi kept a smile on his face as he appeared calm and collected.

Certainly, Zhu Kong understood that as well. Since he wasn’t a Tenth-Order Dragon, his power was significantly weaker than that of a Great Emperor. Although he was also an Elder of Dragon Island, his power paled when compared to that of the Great Elder and the Second Elder.

Indeed, he was of no help in the battle over there, which was the same case for Li Wu Yi and Jiu Feng. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have come here, as it would be better to help settle the decisive battle instead.

It was because Li Wu Yi and Jiu Feng understood their limitations that they decided not to stay there for too long.

As they spoke, a deafening rumble could be heard from the Dragon Grave again. Like arrows leaving the bows, the violent force spread across the entire horizon as the sea began to churn and the ground began to shake.

The battle over there had begun!

Yang Kai looked in that direction in excitement as he was eager to go over there.

That was a real battle between Great Emperor level powerhouses, something totally different from the battle between Duan Hong Chen and Wu Kuang that he had witnessed in the Shattered Star Sea in the past.

Although Duan Hong Chen and Wu Kuang were both Great Emperors in name, their powers had been significantly reduced at the time, so the battle was certainly not as stunning as the one on this day.

If he could just observe this battle and study its mysteries, it would be equivalent to years of secluded cultivation. At that instant, Yang Kai wished that he could install a pair of wings and fly over to have a look. Although it would be dangerous, he wouldn’t want to miss such a battle.

“Sir is indeed very impatient.” Li Wu Yi took a look in that direction and shook his head. Then, he turned his head and said, “Fourth Elder, if you think we should just take a seat and have a chat, I’m fine with that. I happen to have some bottles of wine with me, so you can have a taste.”

Zhu Kong stared fixedly at him, “Have you always been so verbose?”

Jiu Feng pressed her lips together and spoke up, “I told you to speak less and act more, but you just don’t listen to me. Don’t you remember the setbacks you suffered in the past? You’re like a leopard that never changes its spots!”

Feeling embarrassed, Li Wu Yi rubbed his nose and muttered, “It’d be best if we don’t have to resort to fighting. The Fourth Elder isn’t a pushover.”

Zhu Kong snorted, “Let’s see if you have the capability to defeat me!”

After trading glances, both of them made a move at the same time without any warning.

Li Wu Yi directly pressed his palm towards Zhu Kong as he pushed his Space Principles, upon which the Void engulfed the Fourth Elder.

With a stern expression, the Fourth Elder remained on the spot as a large Dragon’s illusory phantom emerged from his body and launched itself at the approaching Void wave with a roar.

There seemed to be a transparent layer or barrier within the Void which blocked the giant Dragon phantom; however, Li Wu Yi was also forced to hold out his palm as the Space Principles around him became turbulent.

Both of them appeared extremely solemn. While most of the spectators couldn’t grasp what was going on, a glint flashed across Yang Kai’s eyes as he observed Li Wu Yi’s use of Space Principles and compared it to his own. At that moment, he was learning a lot from Li Wu Yi. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ancient and abstruse syllables were heard as Zhu Kong began forming a set of hand seals in a hurried manner while he ignored Li Wu Yi’s attack. The speed at which the syllables were wafting from his mouth increased as they formed into a line.

“The Blessing Technique!” Yang Kai frowned as he realized what Secret Technique the Fourth Elder was using.

Without any hesitation, Yang Kai also began chanting in Dragon Language and forming hand seals.

Zhu Kong stared fixedly at him as a sense of surprise flashed across his eyes. Earlier, he had learned that Yang Kai was able to use the Dragon Clan’s Secret Techniques, and since that was the case, it meant that Yang Kai had obtained the Ancestral Dragon Source’s recognition and its inheritance.

However, Zhu Kong had never expected that Yang Kai could even communicate with the Dragon Temple.

There were two Restricted Areas on Dragon Island. One of them was the Dragon Grave, and the other was the Dragon Temple.

The Dragon Grave was where the Dragon Clan members were buried, while the Dragon Temple was where their ancestors’ spirits resided. These two places were the foundation on which the Dragon Clan was built, so they were absolutely indispensable.

In order to communicate with the Dragon Temple, it required more than just a bloodline that was strong and pure. It also required years of prayers and an important ceremony. On Dragon Island, only the Elders could communicate with the Dragon Temple.

The biggest advantage one could get from communicating with the Dragon Temple was the ability to employ the Dragon Clan’s Secret Technique quickly without the need for complicated procedures. Besides that, the Dragon Temple could also provide a kind of Blessing that could help the Dragon Clan members resist bloodline suppression.

Zhu Lie had told Yang Kai before that the Blessing from the Dragon Temple could significantly offset the effect of bloodline suppression. Hence, on Dragon Island, if the Dragon Clan members were well prepared, the suppression of Yang Kai’s Golden Divine Dragon Source on them would be reduced significantly.

There were two main reasons why Fu Chi was subdued by Zhu Qing so easily. Firstly, he was not on guard, as he had never expected that Zhu Qing had recovered her strength, and that she would make a move on him. Secondly, Fu Chi did not have the Dragon Temple’s Blessing prior to that.

However, at this moment, the Secret Technique the Fourth Elder was using was none other than the Blessing Technique. He understood full well that the Dragon Clan’s biggest advantage in this situation was their numerical superiority, but their downside was their bloodline.

Yang Kai alone was capable of suppressing all the Dragon Clan members’ bloodlines at the same time, rendering all of them unable to utilize their full power.
