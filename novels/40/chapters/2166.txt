“Dragon Aura...” Xiao Bai Yi exclaimed, feeling the aura of a True Dragon from where Yang Kai stood. Although this aura wasn’t very strong, the majesty it gave off caused one’s heart to tremble.

Before his words even fell, a golden True Dragon phantom suddenly appeared behind Yang Kai and slowly opened its giant pair of eyes to stare at Xiao Bai Yi.

Instantly, Xiao Bai Yi felt cold sweat drop down his face and he unconsciously retreated a few steps. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Brother Xiao Bai’s strength is profound, so I have to take this seriously as well... defend yourself well!” Yang Kai shouted as he slashed out with his sword. Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi overflowed from the slash and cut apart the lightning sea, revealing Yang Kai’s stalwart figure.

The Golden Dragon phantom behind Yang Kai roared to the Heavens, causing the world around him to tremble before its aura also poured into Yang Kai’s sword, enhancing the power of his slash.

At that moment, a thousand years seemed to flow by in an instant as the power of a True Dragon smashed the world itself.

Xiao Bai Yi’s forehead was drenched in cold sweat as he faced this seemingly unlimited pressure and was forced back once more; however, he quickly grit his teeth and stomped his feet to stand his ground, pushing his Source Qi violently to protect himself while simultaneously summoning a mirror-like defensive artifact to create a light curtain in front of himself.

*Hong...*

A golden light, containing a tyrannical power, slashed out, causing the entire space to tremble, as if the end of the world was nigh. Turbulent aura fluctuations continued for quite some time before finally subsiding.

Yang Kai’s eyes stared forward coldly.

A hundred meters away, Xiao Bai Yi stood mid-air, pale-faced. The light curtain of his mirror artifact which was protecting his body had already cracked in several places, and a moment after the dust settled, it shattered into countless fragments.

As his hand trembled violently, Xiao Bai Yi was barely able to keep his grip on his sword.

Looking out at the opponent in front of him, Xiao Bai Yi grit his teeth and shouted, “You’re just a First-Order Dao Source Realm... how could you possibly have such strength?”

Yang Kai replied indifferently, “Strength cannot be judged just by one’s cultivation, do you still not understand such a basic truth, Brother Xiao Bai?”

“I refuse to believe it!” Xiao Bai Yi roared as a violent aura suddenly broke out of his body. His Source Qi, which had just now depressed, erupted at this moment as he grabbed his sword with both hands and lifted it up high, “This will be the final clash. If you can take it, you win, if you can’t, you’ll die!”

Listening to him say this. Yang Kai couldn’t help turning serious as it was apparent Xiao Bai Yi was about to use his trump card. The ultimate technique of a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master could not possibly be simple.

Taking a breath, Yang Kai also began condensing his Source Qi.

With Xiao Bai Yi’s shout, his expression turned solemn as a look of absolute focus appeared on his face. Tightly gripping his sword, Xiao Bai Yi’s entire body began overflowing with radiant light.

An astonishing pressure burst forth as the surrounding space began to shake, like it would shatter at any moment.

The next moment, a low growl came out, “Heaven Sword, Broken Star!”

When these words fell, countless light clusters exploded in the sky before they crashed down, like a great meteor shower, intimidating and unavoidable.

Yang Kai’s eyes flashed a brilliant light seeing this attack, and instead of falling back to defend, he actually stepped in. Abandoning his sword, Yang Kai pushed his hands forward as he began pushing his Space Force to inspire the local Space Principles.

Countless pitch-black Moon Blades flew out to meet the falling lights, and together with a thunderous rumbling, black holes began appearing everywhere, exiling all the violent explosive energy from this clash to the Void, shaking the entire space to the point where it seemed ready to collapse.

Yang Kai’s eyes darted back and forth as this clash continued, searching for Xiao Bai Yi’s figure.

Suddenly, he narrowed his eyes, pushed his Source Qi, and palmed towards a certain spot.

*Pa...*

At the same time as a loud thud and two muffled snorts rang out, Yang Kai’s complexion paled as he was forced backwards a few steps while Xiao Bai Yi pale figure re-appeared up above. Falling to the stage unwillingly, Xiao Bai Yi’s aura and face were incredibly pale.

The sky-covering explosions had disappeared at this moment, leaving only a faint tension in the air after the battle subsided.

Xiao Bai Yi hit the stage heavily, but immediately did his best to stand up. Unfortunately, he was unsteady on his feet and had to use his sword as a crutch to prevent himself from falling over.

His exposed skin was cracked all over and blood was constantly flowing out from his wounds.

There was also a palm print on the chest.

This palm print was the only sign of the damage Yang Kai inflicted on him. As for the other wounds, they had nothing to do with Yang Kai!

Yang Kai stood in the air, looking down at the palm he had just used to attack. At this moment, his palm was dripping with blood from several fresh, painful puncture wounds. There was also a strange Principle Strength lingering around these wounds which was hindering his injuries from recovering.

Flicking the blood from his hand, Yang Kai pushed his Source Qi to disperse the lingering Principle Strength before he said lightly, “Brother Xiao Bai, your Heaven Sword seems to be a bit beyond your ability to control. Was it really necessary to go so far?”

Although Yang Kai didn’t know what kind of Secret Technique Xiao Bai Yi had studied, the last sword move he used was obviously not something he could currently withstand. Using this move forcefully would inevitably bring harm to him, and Xiao Bai Yi’s current bloodstained state was the best evidence of that.

“Hahahaha!” Although Xiao Bai Yi looked miserable at this moment, he couldn’t help laughing loudly, his laughter filled with a kind of hearty joy. There was no regret or unwillingness in his voice as he shouted, “Of course it is necessary! When facing an enemy, one should use everything at their disposal to decide who will die, and who will live. To achieve victory, what does some trivial backlash count for!”

Yang Kai nodded lightly, “Brother Xiao Bai has the heart of a Master, this Yang is impressed!”

Xiao Bai Yi shook his head slowly and said, “Unfortunately, I was still no match for you in the end... A First-Order Dao Source Realm... Haha...”

A wry smile on his face, Xiao Bai Yi’s voice was filled with a myriad of extremely complex emotions. Before today, he would never have thought that he would one day be defeated by an opponent at the First-Order Dao Source Realm. He was a genius amongst his peers, a favoured son of Heaven. In this world, there were few who could enter his eyes and be treated as equals.

But today’s battle had made him realize a simple truth. He was just a young man standing in a waist-deep river thinking he had swum across the sea... It was truly laughable.

“Yang Kai!” Xiao Bai Yi shouted, dropping his sword and straightening his back, “Do it!”

Saying so, he lifted his head to expose his neck, showing no intention to fight back.

After all, even his strongest move was easily resolved by Yang Kai, so he had no more will or energy to fight at this moment.

“I didn’t say I wanted to kill you.” Yang Kai chuckled, “Only you kept clamouring for a life or death fight, right?”

Xiao Bai Yi frowned at this and said, “If you want to move forward, you have no other choice, otherwise you and I may be trapped here forever!”

“Not necessarily!” Yang Kai denied his opinion.

What Yang Kai had said at the beginning was true, between him and Xiao Bai Yi there were no grievances nor grudges, so there was no reason for them to kill one another. What’s more... During his fight with Xiao Bai Yi, Yang Kai had never sensed any murderous intent from his opponent, only extreme fighting intent.

It was obvious that Xiao Bai Yi didn’t intend on killing him, his objective from the start had just been to fight Yang Kai!

This was the exact mindset a cultivator who pursued the peak of the Martial Dao should have.

As he spoke, Yang Kai turned his gaze around, trying to find a way out of this space.

However, the only thing here was the floating battle stage, beyond which was nothing but a black, boundless abyss.

“Could the exit be down there?” Yang Kai came to the edge of the platform and looked down, feeling a strange aura coming from below, one that caused his skin to crawl slightly. It was really uncertain what would happen if he were to jump down.

Yang Kai secretly decided to reserve jumping off as the last resort.

In truth, he had already thought of another way to leave this place.

According to what Xiao Bai Yi said, the exit from this place would only appear after one person died. In that case, as long as he put Xiao Bai Yi into the Sealed World Bead, the exit would probably appear.

However... Doing so would expose the secret of the Sealed World Bead.

Pushing his Space Force, Yang Kai thought about trying to teleport out of this place, but in the next moment, he shook his head.

Space Force could be used to teleport, but only inside of this space.

This place seemed to be a special sealed space, so Yang Kai wasn’t able to cross its boundaries and leave.

“You won’t find anything!” Seeing Yang Kai scurrying around, Xiao Bai Yi couldn’t help shouting, “I told you before, I’ve already searched this place carefully, and there is no exit at all. I’ve already lost, so don’t you think it’s about time to put an end to this?”

Yang Kai turned his head and looked at him, but just as he was about to say something, the whole battle stage began to hum.

Yang Kai’s expression changed dramatically as he quickly released his Divine Sense to survey the surroundings.

Xiao Bai Yi was also obviously taken aback, not sure what was going on.

But soon, a surprising scene occurred.

The three big characters which were floating high up above suddenly transformed into two rays of light, one big, one small. The small one shot towards Xiao Bai Yi and engulfed him before he could react; then, with a flicker, it disappeared.

At the same time, Xiao Bai Yi also disappeared!

The big ray of light transformed into a kind of light path that extended out from the edge of the battle stage into the darkness. At the end of this bridge, a closed door appeared; as for where this door led, it was impossible to tell.

Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling startled and frowned for a moment as he thought. After examining the light bridge for a time, he began to mutter, “This must be the way forward... and Brother Xiao Bai seems to have been sent out, so... the key was to have him admit defeat?”

Judging from the scene just now, it was only after Xiao Bai Yi surrendered that changes occurred, not only teleporting Xiao Bai Yi out but also providing a new path to follow.

Looking at it this way, it was clear what should be done next.
