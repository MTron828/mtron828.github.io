Somewhere in the Two Seasons Mountain Range, a strange tension hung in the air.

Both Luo Yuan and Wu Chang wore shocked expressions at this moment.

Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao were also staring dumbfounded at the scene before them.

Nearby, Lan Xun was also surprised as her eyes flashed brightly, while even Xiao Chen muttered in confusion, “What’s going on?”

Two rising stars, Luo Yuan and Wu Chang, had attacked Yang Kai at the same time, causing everyone to believe that Yang Kai would die. Wu Chang alone was not an ordinary Dao Source Realm cultivator, and regardless of whether Luo Yan was all bark and no bite, or he really had the strength to back up his arrogance, he was still a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator. Wu Chang also had a fierce reputation as a violent individual, so there was no one who met a good end when they were targeted by him.

And now, these two had attacked Yang Kai simultaneously without warning, leaving no way for him to avoid them at all.

Everyone was certain they would be witnessing the miserable scene of Yang Kai’s death...

But instead, it was Luo Yuan and Wu Chang, the sneak attackers, who were sent flying while Yang Kai showed no signs of injury.

[How did he do it?]

Recalling that moment, Yang Kai seemed to have just stood still without moving. Now though, his face had gone pale, and his expression was flustered as if he was quite frightened, his body trembling slightly and his forehead covered in sweat.

Although he looked a little embarrassed, he was completely unscathed.

“Little brat... what did you just do?” Xiao Chen couldn’t understand.

It was impossible for Luo Yuan and Wu Chang to be repelled for no reason. The only explanation was that Yang Kai had secretly used some amazing method to save himself, but no one had seen clearly what that method was.

Xiao Chen’s brow was furrowed tightly as he secretly felt that something was off about Yang Kai.

“Interesting...” Lan Xun’s beautiful eyes shined brightly as she stared at Yang Kai somewhat cheerfully.

Although she was only a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator herself, she was the Bright Moon Great Emperor’s precious gem and she had inherited his Special Constitution. Since she was a child, she had been fascinated with the strength of her father, so in terms of experience, insight, and vision, she stood above everyone else present.

Although she didn’t see too clearly what happened, she still had some understanding of what transpired.

Just now, when Luo Yuan and Wu Chang attacked and were about to hit Yang Kai, Lan Xun clearly saw his body turn illusory for a moment, like he had disappeared from this world.

At the same time, Wu Chang and Luo Yuan’s attacks lost their target.

Losing their target, the two attacks naturally collided with each other.

In other words, it was Wu Chang’s attack that pushed back Luo Yuan, and it was Luo Yuan’s attack that pushed back Wu Chang...

It was as if the two had fought each other!

[What a strange Secret Technique!] Lan Xun’s beautiful eyes lit up as she glanced over at Luo Yuan, silently thinking to herself, [He’s also a bit unusual, able to match Wu Chang in a single exchange. Since when did such a monster appear in the Eight Paths Sect? It seems that what Lord Father told me was right; never underestimate anyone. Even people from humble backgrounds could have a bright and lofty future. This Luo Yuan is the most obvious example... and now there’s also this strange guy. He is definitely not as cowardly as he makes himself look to be. Even his previous cowardly display must have been a pretence. Only these smelly men with muscles for brains could have really believed that this was his true personality... Ah right, what was his name again?]

All sorts of distracting thoughts flashed through Lan Xun’s mind. Believing that Yang Kai was pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger, she couldn’t help but cast an interested look at Yang Kai, who was still shivering midair, a playful expression soon appearing on her face as if she had already seen through him.

Finally, Wu Chang recovered from his shock and took a glance at Yang Kai before turning to Luo Yan and threatening, “Are you courting death?”

Even though he hadn’t clearly understood how Yang Kai had avoided his attack, after just a bit of thought, he was able to roughly figure out what had happened.

With his arrogant personality, which looked down on everyone else, he naturally blamed Luo Yuan for what just transpired! It was as though Luo Yuan had interfered with his good deed and allowed Yang Kai to use his Secret Technique to resolve his crisis.

“Me?” Yang Kai looked panicked and pointed at himself as he hurriedly asked, “Are you talking about me? I don’t want to die, please don’t kill me...”

While he was talking, he turned towards Xiao Bai Yi and called out, “Xiao Bai, please reason with Brother Wu Chang! Have him spare me, okay?”

Xiao Bai Yi glared at him and grit his teeth as he snapped, “I really want to rush over and kill you myself.”

Fortunately, Yang Kai was not a disciple of Azure Sun Temple, otherwise, Xiao Bai Yi really would find himself in an embarrassing position. It was nothing less than shameful for a Sect to have such a snivelling disciple. Xiao Bai Yi secretly hated that he hadn’t seen through Yang Kai’s true nature before, otherwise, he would never have agreed to give Xue Yi’s entry quota to Yang Kai.

Even Murong Xiao Xiao, who was standing next to him, cast a disapproving look at Yang Kai.

“Do you want to fight? I will give you a fight!” Luo Yuan’s gaze also crossed through Yang Kai and landed on Wu Chang, his voice filled with a faint eagerness, clearly indicating he was not afraid of Wu Chang. Actually, deep in his heart, he couldn’t wait to fight Wu Chang and prove his strength.

And so, oddly enough they both began to ignore Yang Kai entirely.

“Bold!” Wu Chang grinned, a look that could almost be described as happy appearing on his face, “It’s been a long time since I met an interesting guy like you!”

As he spoke, he actually licked his lips, like a hungry predator or a pervert that had suddenly encountered a naked beauty...

The eyes of the two met mid-air and sparks seemed to fly, causing the atmosphere to become tense.

Yang Kai was standing between the two of them, and although he was being ignored, he still had to bear the pressure from both of them, turning his face paler by the moment.

*Huhuhu...*

Even the swirling wind seemed to be contaminated with murderous intent, sending chills up the spines of the onlookers.

“Enough!”

Seeing that Luo Yuan and Wu Chang were about to fight, Lan Xun really couldn’t stand it anymore and after calling out lightly, she stepped forward and said, “Both of you are geniuses from my Southern Territory. In the future, you should not become so agitated over such minor matters. Before entering this Sealed World, Uncle Xiao had said he hoped everyone would put the overall situation first. Our opponents are not each other, but rather those from the other territories. Please give me some face and exchange weapons of war for gifts of jade and silk.”

Hearing this, Wu Chang and Luo Yuan frowned at the same time. They didn’t expect that Princess Lan Xun would come forward to mediate at this moment.

Although they were a little unhappy in their hearts, the two of them didn’t dare refuse Princess Lan Xun. It might be fine in the short term to offend Lan Xun here, but once the Four Seasons Realm closed and rumours began to spread, even their own Sects wouldn’t dare to shelter them from reprisals.

“Since the Princess has said so... the two of you should stop, otherwise this Xiao will become your enemy!” Xiao Chen also stood forward, fulfilling his role as the Princess’ protector.

“Lucky you!”

Wu Chang and Luo Yuan uttered these words at the same time before they withdrew their fighting intent.

Wu Chang glanced at Luo Yuan briefly before he spoke to Lan Xun, “Your Highness, this time, this Wu will give you face and not care about him, but if there is a next time... even if the Great Emperor himself was here, I will still kill this waste that does not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth!”

In his eyes, besides a few exceptions, everyone was a waste!

He didn’t even put the elite disciples of Azure Sun Temple or Orthodoxy Temple in his eyes, so how could he care about Luo Yuan from Eight Paths Sect? If it weren’t for Lan Xun’s interference, he wouldn’t have endured being provoked by such a nobody.

“I’ve heard about Heavenly Martial Holy Land’s Wu Chang for a long time now, but it seems all that’s strong about him is his tongue,” Luo Yuan was not someone who would take such provocation quietly, so he immediately levelled an insult of his own.

“Good, good,” Lan Xun also secretly felt a headache coming on. “If you really were fighting over some rare and precious treasure, I would not bother to stop you, but for a mere Star Seal... it’s not worth it. There are many more such Star Seals in the Four Seasons Realm, and there is plenty of time before this Sealed World closes, so everyone will have many opportunities to acquire them.”

While speaking, she also glanced at the back of Yang Kai’s hand and commented, “What’s more... this is just a trivial diamond Star Seal, it’s not worth fighting over.”

“What? Do Star Seals have different ranks?” Yang Kai immediately latched onto some information Lan Xun’s words revealed and asked in surprise.

“Why are you still running your mouth?” Xiao Chen glanced at him indifferently and sarcastically said, “You’ve just managed to survive a brush with death, so you should hurry up and run away with your tail tucked between your legs. What are you still doing here? Waiting for death?”

“Hehe...” The corners of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched in response as he wore an embarrassed expression.

He turned his gaze to Xiao Bai Yi as he wanted to ask about the specific situation of the Star Seals, but he couldn’t as Xiao Bai Yi directly turned his gaze away, refusing to communicate with him.

Yang Kai suddenly felt depressed.

But looking at Xiao Bai Yi acting like this, it was obvious he knew something; however, this information was probably of the same level of importance as the existence of the Flowing Time Temple, a secret of the Sect, so it wouldn’t be convenient for Xiao Bai Yi to reveal it.

To the side, Murong Xiao Xiao showed an apologetic expression to Yang Kai. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yang Kai understood and did not ask anything more.

“Good, now that this Star Seal has a master, please put its existence aside and no longer think about it,” Lan Xun’s words concluded this minor event, which could also be regarded as her covertly helping Yang Kai.

With these words said, as long as anyone cared about Lan Xun’s face and identity, they would no longer try to snatch Yang Kai’s Star Seal.

Although Wu Chang and Luo Yuan were warlike and rebellious, they still needed to give her face.

After her words were finished, Wu Chang and Luo Yuan glanced at each other across the air, their eyes meeting and conveying the same, silent message, [Don’t let me run into you again, or you will regret it!]

Immediately, the two snorted coldly before turning their backs to one another and preparing to leave.

But at that moment, a sudden change occurred.

From the depths of the Two Seasons Mountain Range, a strange shockwave erupted, bringing with it the sound of muffled thunder while shaking the earth below everyone’s feet.

Everyone’s complexion changed as they turned and looked around suspiciously, completely befuddled.

Things did not end there though and soon, an exclamation sounded out, “Look over there, up in the sky!”
