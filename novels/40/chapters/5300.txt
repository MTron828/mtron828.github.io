“Let him go!” The woman ordered Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gazed down at Ji Lao San, who was being held by him and grinned slightly, “Then you have to make sure he doesn’t bother me again.”

The woman gritted her teeth and replied, “Rest assured, he won’t bother you anymore.”

Yang Kai lowered his eyes, “The same mistake can’t be repeated thrice. I hope he remembers this lesson.”

Even though he spoke in a casual tone, the message was clear. Ji Lao San provoked him twice, but he simply subjugated him without hurting a single hair on his head. His patience, however, had a limit. If there was a third provocation, the response would undoubtedly be harsher.

Of course, Yang Kai wouldn’t kill him, but he could beat him to within an inch of his life. Those from the Dragon Clan had great vitality and could recover easily from almost any injury. As long as their Source and Dragon Bead were not harmed, any wound could be restored no matter how severe it was.

With the strange skill Yang Kai displayed previously, Ji Lao San would be powerless to fight back if Yang Kai really wanted to deal with him.

However, since when had the Dragon Clan ever been threatened in this way before?

As a result, as soon as Yang Kai said those words, a large number of Young Dragons and Grand Dragons became enraged, and it was impossible for the female Grand Dragon who was in front of Yang Kai to stay composed.

After a lengthy period of holding herself back, the female Grand Dragon clenched her teeth and murmured, “He will.”

Upon her reply, Yang Kai flashed a smile and tossed Ji Lao San towards her. When she grabbed him, she gave Yang Kai a threatening glare before turning and fleeing with Ji Lao San in her arms.

“Great Evolution Pass’ Yang Kai greets three Seniors,” Yang Kai said as he turned to face the three visibly older people at the gate.

He had no idea what rank these three held, but according to their Dragon Pressure, it was clear that they were the strongest present.

Two of them were old men while the last was an old woman. They most likely held high statuses in the Dragon Clan.

One of the old men nodded lightly and said, “The Dragon Clan is well aware of the intention behind your arrival here, but we need some time to prepare. You shall temporarily live in the No-Return Pass and wait patiently for us.”

[I don’t even know what I am here for, so how do you know? If you do know, you should let me know first!]

However, the old man obviously had no intention of explaining anything to Yang Kai and just left with the two others once he finished.

Once those three Seniors left, the rest of the Dragon Clan also left, with no plans to further interact with Yang Kai.

Then, he was left alone, perplexed.

The Dragon Clan’s alienation became clear too.

This trip to the No-Return Pass was filled with uncertainty since Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao didn’t explain anything to him before he set out. Furthermore, the Dragon Clan didn’t bother to tell him anything either when he arrived. Instead, he was simply told to wait.

[So, why am I waiting? For how long should I wait?] He had no answers.

This sense of being completely out of control was quite distressing.

Fortunately, Yang Kai was not a child. In a situation like this, his only course of action was to seek information from someone.

So, Yang Kai hurriedly turned back, fixing his eyes on the colourful-robed young woman who was preparing to leave and said, “Miss, please stay for a moment.”

The young woman stopped when she heard him and turned back with a smile,” Are you referring to me?”

Yang Kai then approached her quickly, nodded, and said, “I was impulsive just now. I hope Miss won’t mind.”

His courteous manner was now in stark contrast to the domineering man who had just subjugated Ji Lao San.

“What’s the matter?” The colourful-robed young woman asked as her eyes flickered with interest.

“I’m new here and I don’t know anything. I would like to seek some guidance from you,” Yang Kai replied, blushing.

The brows of the colourfully robed young woman became crescent-shaped, and she proudly twitched her brows at her partner, giving an impression of how she was expecting this.

Her companion, meanwhile, was unresponsive to her.

Yang Kai on the other hand pretended he didn’t notice.

“What do you wish to ask?” Inquired the colourfully robed young woman.

“I’m not sure what Miss can enlighten me on,” Yang Kai replied.

The colourful-robed young woman laughed, “You are so strange. Don’t you know what you want to know? It’s really unreasonable for you to ask me to enlighten you without at least describing what you want to learn.”

Yang Kai responded with a wry smile, “Please don’t blame me, Miss. Regarding the current visit in the No-Return Pass, I’m genuinely baffled. I’m not sure what I am supposed to be doing here.”

“Didn’t your Old Ancestor mention anything to you?” The woman asked curiously.

“Not at all.”

“In that case…” The woman tapped on her crimson lips and then proceeded to say, “En, I’m in a good mood today. Follow me.”

With that being said, she led the way and Yang Kai followed closely.

After a while, they eventually arrived beneath the enormous Parasol Tree. The three figures moved around, and soon came to a branch. The young woman simply waved her hand and a portal emerged in front of them.

“Space Principles?” Yang Kai asked with furrowed eyebrows.

Just like how the colourful-robed young woman reacted when she saw Yang Kai’s use of Space Principles previously, Yang Kai’s reaction now was arguably the same as hers was.

“Come in,” the woman said with a triumphant smile that suggested she had anticipated his reaction.

Yang Kai followed the woman and her companion into the portal. They soon arrived at a location with stunning mountains and rivers.

The view was as beautiful and refreshing as a spring day. The mountains were pristine, and the lakes were crystal clear, not to mention the gently flowing clouds and mist. It was truly a majestic view.

This was some kind of Sealed World.

Yang Kai was no stranger to the existence of Sealed Worlds; after all, the Small Universe of a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master was a Sealed World. The Universe Paradises and Universe Cave Heavens left behind after the death of High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters on the Black Ink Battlefield were also Sealed Worlds.

Yet this Sealed World gave him a different feeling.

This place seemed to still maintain the aura of the dawn of Chaos and the first division of the Heavens and Earth. The ancient aura was everywhere, giving Yang Kai the illusion of him entering a long-forgotten wilderness.

“These are the real Phoenix Nests.” The young woman’s words resonated in his ears, “The Nirvana Parasol Tree was there at the birth of the Phoenix Clan. There are as many Phoenix Nests on the Nirvana Parasol Tree as Phoenixes in this Universe. The Phoenix Nest is the root of every Phoenix, and this space is different from the outside world.”

Yang Kai instantly understood. It was no wonder the ancient aura was preserved here. It was because this aura was created by the Nirvana Parasol Tree itself, which had survived since long ago and remained pure and unspoiled like this.

[So these are Phoenix Nests!]

Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel ashamed for having assumed that the Phoenix Clan would physically build their nest on the Parasol Tree just like any other bird.

Yang Kai quietly reminded himself to avoid basing future decisions solely on the surface. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Then, he saw the young woman straighten her body and move right into a huge nest.

Yang Kai looked up at the sky and silently followed.

The three figures flew inside and sat down cross-legged.

Yang Kai took an inquisitive look around and soon realised that from the outside, it appeared to be a massive bird nest, but that once he entered, it was totally different.

Without time to investigate carefully, Yang Kai briefly cupped his fist, “Great Evolution Pass’ Yang Kai. How may I address the both of you?”

The woman gave a gentle smile and replied, “Huang Si Niang.”

Then, she pointed at her companion, “Feng Liu Lang!”

Yang Kai wasn’t certain how to deal with it because their names seemed to be a little too simple. In the Phoenix Clan, the males were surnamed Feng while the females were surnamed Huang, which made it concise and clear.

At least, it was convenient to address them this way.

He was too lazy to delve into the subject, but as he wanted to say something out of courtesy, Huang Si Niang continued, “Before you ask something, I have something to give you.”

Yang Kai was taken aback. He had just arrived and he was already receiving gifts? [Were those from the Phoenix Clan all this friendly?]

Immediately, he sat upright, and said solemnly, “I dare not reject anything from Seniors.”

While he may have previously addressed her as though they were on an equal footing, he was actually aware that this woman’s age was measured in tens of thousands of years. She could even be his ancestor.

Huang Si Niang smiled, “You’re really good at talking. Humans sure are sweet.”

Yang Kai placed his hand on his chest, “Everything I have said, I said from the bottom of my heart. I wonder what Senior would like to give me?”

“This,” While speaking, Huang Si Niang took out a long feather and handed it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai could tell it was extraordinary just by glancing at the flowing light of the long feather, which was the tail feather of a Phoenix.

[What did she give me this for?]

Seemingly noticing Yang Kai’s doubts, Huang Si Niang explained, “I lost the bet with Liu Lang just now, so this is the prize.”

Yang Kai instinctively felt something was wrong; after all, even if she lost the bet, why did the prize end up with him?

But now that it had been handed over, it wouldn’t do any good to reject it, especially when he had other requests for her. As Yang Kai received the feather, his body shook.

He didn’t perceive anything by just looking at the long feather’s flowing light, but once he held it, he at once understood that the long feather was covered with an exceedingly potent Space Principle fluctuation.

Although it was clear that he was holding the long feather in his palm, due to the fluctuations of Space Principles, it appeared to be both tangible and intangible at the same time, as if it could enter into the Void at any moment.

Ordinary people would have a tremendously difficult time just holding something like this, but fortunately, Yang Kai was also an expert in the Dao of Space. With just a little effort, the light flowing off the long feather suddenly took shape.

[This is wonderful!] Yang Kai felt that if he fully comprehended the secrets within this feather, it would help him improve his understanding of the Dao of Space.

Huang Si Niang and Feng Liu Lang exchanged glances, and both could see that the other was surprised to witness this scene.

They once saw Yang Kai use Space Principle and were aware of his mastery over the Dao of Space; however, now they felt as though they had underestimated him too much.

Yang Kai raised his head, “Si Niang is an expert in the Dao of Space?”

“Is there a problem with the highest-ranking members of the Phoenix Clan being experts in the Dao of Space?” Huang Si Niang covered her mouth and smiled.

“Are you saying that all the high-ranking members of the Phoenix Clan are experts in the Dao of Space?”

“You didn’t know?” She asked curiously.

Yang Kai blinked, “I was not informed of this.” Additionally, even though he had never seen a pure Phoenix Clan member, he was greeted by Qing Luan, Yuan Chu, and others in the Divine Spirit Ancestral Land. They could be considered a branch of the Phoenix Clan, but they didn’t look as though they were Masters of the Dao of Space.

Similarly, even with her Ice Phoenix Source, Su Yan showed no indications of mastering or even understanding the Dao of Space.

Thus, Yang Kai was really caught by surprise.

“Most Humans won’t know much about the Divine Spirits, but you’re from a Cave Heaven or Paradise, no? How could you not have known? Didn’t your Elders tell you about it?”

Yang Kai became a little speechless and replied, “I’m actually not from any of the Cave Heavens or Paradises.”
