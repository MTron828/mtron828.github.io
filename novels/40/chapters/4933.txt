Yang Kai’s yell caused the woman’s movements to pause slightly. It was precisely because of this momentary hesitation that B-2 and E-5 survived. Fresh blood splattered everywhere as both of them instantaneously suffered severe injuries and were forced to retreat; however, they were clearly unafraid of death and rushed forward again after being forced to retreat once.

The woman frowned slightly and murderous intent blazed brightly in her eyes. She had held back just now because of Yang Kai’s yell, but that did not mean she had lost her intention to kill B-2 and E-5.

Human Masters who became Black Ink Disciples after being corrupted by Black Ink Strength were destined to stand on the opposite side as the enemy, and there could be no mercy when dealing with the enemy. That was the lesson learned by the Human cultivators after innumerable years on the Black Ink Battlefield. It was a lesson they received in exchange for the blood of countless ancestors.

Before the woman could attack again though, Yang Kai rushed over in a flash. B-2 and E-5 were completely focused on the woman, so they were totally defenceless towards him. He easily approached them for that reason and knocked them down, rendering them unconscious rather than killing them. Unfortunately, due to the urgency of the situation, his attacks had been a bit too heavy so there was a high chance that they would need to recuperate for some time when they woke up.

The woman held her longsword in her grip. Watching the scene in front of her, a look of surprise flashed through her eyes. As a Black Ink Disciple, Yang Kai’s actions were undoubtedly puzzling; however, if she combined his actions with the words he shouted earlier, a vague speculation formed in her head, “Are you not corrupted by the Black Ink Strength?”

Holding B-2 in one hand and E-5 in the other, Yang Kai slowly shook his head, “I wanted to tell you when I met you for the first time, but I didn’t get the chance to speak.”

“You really have one of the Four Universe Pillars?” The woman raised her eyebrows.

“I have a World Spring!”

“Words are nothing without proof!” She did not lower her guard, and a sword wave continued to hum around the longsword in her hand.

Yang Kai nodded in acknowledgement and said, “Please see for yourself, Senior!”

While speaking, he opened the portal to his Small Universe. She took a deep look at him before she activated her Divine Sense and probed the interior of his Small Universe.

A short while later, she withdrew her Divine Sense, her eyes filled with astonishment. She had certainly seen a clear spring inside Yang Kai’s Small Universe, in addition to the mysterious power that flowed out of it which stabilised his Small Universe. Thanks to this power, his Small Universe was not only extremely firm, but also completely impervious to any external forces.

She also saw that his Small Universe had already transformed from immaterial to material, which was what surprised her the most; after all, the young man in front of her was clearly only in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm…

“Senior, do you also have one of the Four Universe Pillars?” Yang Kai inquired for verification.

If she did not have one of the Four Universe Pillars, then how was it possible for her to safely escape from the clutches of a Black Ink Territory Lord? The reason she had quietly endured the process and pretended to be corrupted by Black Ink Strength was that she had been running out of strength. If it was discovered that she had one of the Four Universe Pillars, she was bound to be killed on the spot; therefore, she waited until the Territory Lord departed and she recovered enough before she made her move.

Nu Yan’s death was simply collateral damage. He originally thought that staying behind to watch over her would be an easy task because he did not need to confront the Human Masters, but how could he have known that staying behind was actually the fastest way to die? If Nu Yan had known that his decision would result in such an outcome, he would never have agreed to stay beside this woman.

It was precisely because Yang Kai had such a guess that he shouted at the top of his voice when the woman made her move just now.

Unexpectedly though, she slowly shook her head, “I don’t have one of the Four Universe Pillars. The Four Universe Pillars are only given to the Eighth-Order Masters. I am not qualified enough to own one. Why else did you think that Territory Lord left without checking my Small Universe?”

There had never been a precedent of a Ninth-Order Old Ancestor becoming corrupted by Black Ink Strength, so there was no need for them to worry about it and thus no reason for them to have one of the Four Universe Pillars.

Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were the strongest fighting force below the Old Ancestors and also the commanders and leaders of the Human Race army on the Black Ink Battlefield. Hence, a treasure like the Four Universe Pillars would naturally be given to them so that they could be used to the fullest. More importantly, they had enough strength to defend themselves on the chaotic battlefield and would not be killed by accident, leading to the loss of the Four Universe Pillar they carried.

If treasures like the Four Universe Pillars were possessed by Sixth or Seventh-Order Masters, they would be lost if these Open Heaven Realm Masters perished on the battlefield.

The Black Ink Clan was also aware of this point. The Humans did not have many Four Universe Pillars in their possession, and these treasures were always possessed by Eighth-Order Masters. There was no exception to this rule. It was precisely for that reason that the Territory Lord had left with peace of mind after corrupting the woman with his Black Ink Strength and did not bother to check her Small Universe.

Yang Kai was surprised, “How did you resist the corruption of the Black Ink Strength then, Senior?”

When he asked this question, he immediately became vigilant. If this woman had been corrupted by the Black Ink Strength, then the situation in front of him would be very bad.

The woman was silent for a moment before she explained, “Somebody once planted a Secret Technique based on the Profound Fish inside my Small Universe. It can help me to resist the erosion of the Black Ink Strength once.”

The Profound Fish was one of the Four Universe Pillars. Yang Kai did not know what kind of Secret Technique she was referring to and had never heard that the Four Universe Pillars could be used to plant such Secret Techniques. However, this kind of technique would naturally be developed only on the Black Ink Battlefield so it wasn’t surprising for him not to know about it. In order to fight against the Black Ink Strength, it was not surprising for the Human Masters to create some novel sparks after painstakingly struggling with all their might for countless years.

“Senior, do you mean to say that the Secret Technique can protect you only once?”

She nodded.

“May I verify the truth?” Yang Kai asked in a grim voice.

She said nothing and just opened the portal to her Small Universe. At a time like this, she knew that it was a necessary gesture to gain Yang Kai’s trust. In any case, on the Black Ink Battlefield, it was very normal for one’s Small Universe to be investigated by others.

After a quick investigation, Yang Kai discovered that the woman’s Small Universe certainly did not contain any signs of being corrupted by the Black Ink Strength. There were also no signs of a Universe Pillar inside either. He couldn’t help feeling amazed by his discovery.

“We can’t stay here for long,” the woman said softly. Nu Yan’s corpse was suspended there in open view, so if any other Black Ink Clansmen passed by this place, the two of them would have a hard time explaining the situation. While speaking, she glanced at the two Black Ink Disciples in his hand, “You can’t save them. Just kill them.”

However, Yang Kai shook his head, “If it was just me, then I would not be able to save them. But, it’s different with you around, Senior. Please put them into your Small Universe for now.”

She frowned, “Impossible. They are Black Ink Disciples. If I place them in my Small Universe, I will be in trouble when they regain consciousness.”

“Please wait a moment, Senior!” After he said that, Yang Kai’s left and right hands suddenly glowed with dazzling light. When he pressed his palms together, the yellow and blue lights merged together to form a pure white light that enveloped both B-2 and E-5.

Sizzling sounds rang out and the expressions of the two unconscious men suddenly twisted in pain. Immediately after that, dense Black Ink Strength seeped out of their bodies and faded into nothingness. Their expressions gradually softened again as the Black Ink Strength dissipated from them.

Dismissing the remaining Purifying Light, Yang Kai nodded at the woman, “It’s fine now.”

The woman was flabbergasted by what she just witnessed. Although she had some speculations, she couldn’t help feeling incredulous. She took a large step forward and casually grabbed B-2’s wrist, then she carefully probed his condition. After a while, she stared at Yang Kai as though she was looking at a ghost, “What method did you use to dispel the Black Ink Strength?”

Such a method was completely unheard of and unseen before. She had been fighting the Black Ink Clan on the Black Ink Battlefield for some 3,000 years now, but she had never even heard of such a technique.

“I can’t explain in such a short time, but this is a unique ability that I have,” Yang Kai responded faintly.

She didn’t know what to say, mainly because Yang Kai had given her too much of a shock. Besides, she had the vague feeling that there would be a huge impact on the battle situation of this unchanging and eternal war if this method was spread.

In the past, the Black Ink Disciple corrupted by Black Ink Strength were destined to be mortal enemies. Any encounters between the Human Masters and Black Ink Disciples would only end with the death of one party or the other. However, there was now a method to restore order from chaos among the Black Ink Disciples! If this method was utilised properly, then the losses suffered by the Human Race would be significantly reduced!

Not only did he possess one of the Four Universe Pillars, but he also had the means to purify and dispel the Black Ink Strength; thus, she suddenly realised that she had picked up an immeasurable treasure. He would be a huge asset to the entire Black Ink Battlefield!

Upon confirming that all Black Ink Strength in B-2 and E-5 had been purified and dispelled, she did not hesitate to toss the two unconscious men into her Small Universe. Then, she grabbed Yang Kai by the arm, “Let’s go!”

Yang Kai did not resist and allowed her to lead him away.

Along the way, the woman would glance sideways at him from time to time. Finally, she could not suppress her curiosity any longer and asked, “Which Cave Heaven or Paradise did you come from? What is your name?”

Yang Kai was silent. In the end, he answered, “This Junior is called Yang Kai. I come from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven.”

He did not mean to deceive her, but he figured she might not know of Void Land. If he mentioned that name, he would only need to explain even more. He was a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master who was not from any of the Cave Heavens or Paradises after all. Why would he enter the Black Ink Battlefield for no reason? That was a valid point of suspicion and since this matter was related to the Void Corridor, he could not speak carelessly.

He had not forgotten Meng Qi’s warning. Aside from the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Old Ancestors, no matter who questioned him, he could not reveal the existence of the Void Corridor to anybody.

The woman did not seem to think that he was lying. The main reason was that she never expected anybody to lie about their background, so she nodded lightly and said, “Blue Sky Paradise, Feng Ying.”

“Blue Sky Paradise…” Yang Kai raised his brow lightly, “Senior, do you know Elder Mu Zhuo?”

Mu Zhuo was the foreign affairs envoy from Blue Sky Paradise and was the person in charge of their Dao Temple in the Star Boundary. Although Yang Kai was not close with him, they had interacted with each other on multiple occasions.

Due to the Star Boundary’s World Tree, Yang Kai was more or less acquainted with several Elders from each of the major Cave Heavens and Paradises even though his cultivation was low. He was also quite friendly with some of them. There were times when the value of something like personal connections was reflected in such situations.

“Mu Zhuo? He is my Junior Brother. Do you know him?” Feng Ying was a little surprised.

Yang Kai answered, “I’ve met him a few times.”

Upon hearing his answer, she was tempted to ask why a Yin-Yang Cave Heaven disciple would meet a Blue Sky Paradise Elder, let alone several times; however, she was not very familiar with the situation in the outside world after fighting on the Black Ink Battlefield for so long. It was meaningless to ask such questions, so she suppressed the curiosity in her heart.

On the other hand, Yang Kai suddenly looked around and realised that something was wrong. Taking out his Universe Chart, he checked his current position and the direction they were heading before exclaiming in astonishment, “Senior, aren’t we heading in the wrong direction?”
