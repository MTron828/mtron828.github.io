Lin Yun’er stuck her tongue out. She did not feel any remorse from being caught after running away from home and instead pouted, “Master, you’ve been following me all along.”

That person replied, “The world is a sinister place, but you are such a na?ve child. It’s only natural for me to watch over and protect you.”

She snorted angrily, “No wonder. So, the reason why I took that big guy down so easily yesterday is because you helped me from the shadows.”

Lin Yun’er might be simple-minded and na?ve, but she was no fool. She had been surprised at how much her ability had suddenly grown yesterday, but at this moment, she quickly understood the reason behind that change. It wasn’t that she had gotten stronger, but rather that her Master had secretly helped her. Otherwise, she could not have absorbed that Divine Spirit descendant in a single move.

When she pointed it out, that person simply smiled and did not deny her words.

“Where did Uncle Yang go?” She then asked.

He replied, “He is billions of thousands of kilometres away by now.” While speaking, he glanced at the Cross-Territory Space Array and secretly felt astonished. In his opinion, Yang Kai’s cultivation of the Dao of Space was already extremely impressive, especially since he could arrange an Array like this. No matter how fastidious he was, he could tell that that brat had a lot of promise. [He will accomplish many things in the future, but so what? How dare he actually try to abduct my Disciple?! I was being generous for Lin Yun’er’s sake by not breaking both his legs!]

“Ah! I need to go find Uncle Yang then!” She became anxious.

“Nonsense!” That person’s expression darkened, “You’ve spent quite a long time outside so it’s time for you to return with me. Don’t neglect your cultivation!”

“I don’t want to! I want to go and find Uncle Yang!” After saying that, she walked onto the Space Array on her own and tried to pour her Emperor Qi into it; however, the Array showed no signs of reacting even though she was trying so hard to activate it that her face was flushed from the effort.

When that person saw her actions, he felt as if a knife was twisting in his heart. [I struggled so hard to raise you and teach you for so many years. I even guided you to become an Emperor Realm Master. I can’t believe I lost to this Uncle Yang that popped out of nowhere! They say that girls are more outgoing, but isn’t this a little too much?!]

He did not have a good impression of Yang Kai in the first place, but now, his impression of Yang Kai became far worse. He was tempted to capture that boy from the other side of the Space Array and torture him to vent his anger.

Taking a deep breath, he suppressed the sorrow in his heart and smiled, “Disciple, let’s discuss something.”

“What?!” She glared at him furiously.

“Do you like that little brat with the surname ‘Yang’?”

“Uncle Yang is someone precious to me.”

“Do you want to find him?”

“Of course! Master, hurry up and come help me with this. I don’t know why this thing isn’t working.”

[Of course, it isn’t working. I secretly cut off the connection. It’d be weirder if it worked!] Naturally, those words could never be said out loud. If she ever heard those words, they would never have a future together anymore.

“I heard what that Uncle Yang of yours said just now. He has a Sect by the name of High Heaven Palace in the Northern Territory, right?” Pausing for a moment, he continued, “Let’s do this. Disciple, when you become a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, I’ll bring you to that High Heaven Palace in the Northern Territory to look for your Uncle Yang. At that time, you can stay there for however long you want to.”

As soon as she heard those words, her beautiful eyes lit up, “Really?!”

[My heart hurts even more now!] That person forced a smile and nodded gently, “When have I ever lied to you before?”

Lin Yun’er didn’t even bother to think about it and immediately jumped off the Space Array, grabbed her Master’s arm, and started flying forward.

“What are you doing?” He was surprised.

“I’m going back; what else? I have to hurry up and cultivate. Don’t worry, Master, I will surely reach the Third-Order Emperor Realm very soon.”

“En, it’s rare for you to be so motivated. Your Master is very happy. You really are my treasured disciple,” that person replied with a smile; however, the words left a bitter taste in his mouth. [Damn it! Why does it feel like I’ve lost instead?! It’s him! Hmm… That brat was called ‘Yang Kai’, right?! Just you wait!]

…..

“Greetings, Palace Master!”

“Palace Master has returned!

“Quick! Quickly go and inform the Head Manager!”

Several disciples standing guard beside the Space Array in High Heaven Palace were elated to see Yang Kai and clamoured with joy.

They had originally been disciples of Thousand Leaves Sect, but Yang Kai had later taken them into High Heaven Palace after the Thousand Leaves Sect was destroyed. Although they still wore the Thousand Leaves Sect’s emblem, their sense of belonging and identity to High Heaven Palace was growing stronger and stronger as time passed.

Today, all the disciples of Thousand Leaves Sect felt as if they were a part of High Heaven Palace. It was just too comfortable to cultivate here. Not only was the World Energy many times denser here than back at the Thousand Leaves Sect, but there was also no need to worry about cultivation resources. Moreover, the Head Manager did not treat them differently just because they were Thousand Leaves Sect’s disciples.

Only a short period had passed, but the cultivation of the Thousand Leaves Sect’s disciples had increased rapidly. Even the previous Sect Master of Thousand Leaves Sect, Ye Hen, had entered retreat to break through to the Emperor Realm. That was something they could never have imagined before this; however, everything had changed ever since they came to High Heaven Palace. Nowadays, if anybody were to claim that they were not High Heaven Palace’s disciples, they would surely fight those people to death.

Yang Kai wasn’t just the benefactor of Thousand Leaves Sect, he was also the Palace Master of High Heaven Palace. Even so, he rarely showed himself and hardly ever remained in High Heaven Palace for long. He spent most of the time travelling around outside the Sect. Even on the occasional trip home, he would usually leave again soon after staying for only a short while; therefore, Head Manager Hua Qing Si had issued an order a long time ago that she had to be notified as soon as possible whenever Yang Kai returned. That was also why these disciples guarding the array were so excited.

“Hm?” Li Jiao finally recovered from the side-effects of the cross-territory teleportation and looked around in surprise, “Where’s that little girl?”

She was standing next to him just now, so how did she vanish without a trace in the blink of an eye?

Yang Kai replied, “Her Master took her back, so she couldn’t follow us here.”

“Her Master?!” La Jiao’s expression changed considerably as he asked in a terrified voice, “Did that Senior… appear?”

Yang Kai glanced at Li Jiao and curiously asked, “Why do your words sound like you know who Yun’er’s Master is?”

Li Jiao’s expression cramped as he answered honestly, “I have a good guess.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai suddenly became interested, “Who is that person? Let’s hear it.”

He could guess that Lin Yun’er’s Master was by no means an ordinary person and most likely a Great Emperor; however, Yang Kai still did not know who he was. The Great Emperors he came into contact with were few and far between, but it was unlikely for them to have anything to do with her. Still, the fact that Li Jiao had an inkling of who it was surprised him.

Li Jiao pondered in silence for a while before saying, “How much do you know about that girl’s iron wok, Palace Master Yang?”

“It’s my first time seeing it, and I’ve never heard of it before.”

“I see.” Li Jiao nodded, “If you don’t know about that iron wok, then it’s understandable that you couldn’t figure it out, Palace Master Yang.”

“What kind of reputation does that iron wok have?”

Li Jiao solemnly continued, “I’m sure you felt it too, Palace Master Yang, that iron wok, Unlimited Return, is an Ancient Exotic Artifact. Moreover, it can absorb all the treasures in the world when used.”

Yang Kai gently nodded. He had seen the power of Unlimited Return. Lin Yun’er had relied on that strange power to collect hundreds of Artifacts from other people inside the Yin Yang Five Elements Everchanging Profound Sword Formation. It could even be said that the absorption of Divine Spirit’s descendent was not due to her ability but rather due to the Ancient Exotic Artifact’s power.

“As far as I know, that iron wok’s previous owner was the famous… Iron Blood Great Emperor!”

“Iron Blood Great Emperor?!” Yang Kai was shocked.

“That’s right. It is none other than Senior Iron Blood. No one knows how he obtained that Ancient Exotic Artifact, but everyone knows that it is in his possession; however, that story is something from several thousands of years ago. Still, who doesn’t know of Senior Iron Blood’s strength? He is an existence that ranks at the top among all the other Great Emperors. There is almost no one in this world who is his opponent, so he doesn’t have any need to use such treasures. Therefore, Unlimited Return has not surfaced for the past few millennia. Even so, those of the older generation in the Emperor Realm are no strangers to that Ancient Exotic Artifact. I am fairly certain that the iron wok in that girl’s possession is Unlimited Return!”

A strange look flashed in Yang Kai’s eyes, “In other words, Senior Iron Blood is Yun’er’s Master?”

“Yes, the possibility is very high!” Li Jiao nodded affirmatively, “Senior Iron Blood rarely shows himself, so very few people know him. Nevertheless, his cultivation route is very similar to that girl’s, primarily focused on physical techniques and body tempering.”

“En,” Yang Kai thought about it for a while before he continued, “What you say makes sense.”

[Yun’er’s Master is Iron Blood Great Emperor…] That was completely unexpected. It would seem that Yang Yan had taken Yun’er away with her back then so that she could entrust the little girl to Iron Blood Great Emperor. It also made sense for Yun’er’s cultivation to increase so quickly if she was taught by a Great Emperor directly. Rather, it would be much weirder if her cultivation failed to progress quickly under Iron Blood Great Emperor’s guidance considering her own inherent ability and her Tyrant Strength Body.

Yang Kai suddenly thought of something else. Prior to the battle between Heaven Devourer and Bustling World Great Emperor back in the Shattered Star Sea, Duan Hong Chen once casually mentioned that Iron Blood had taken in a good Disciple. Thinking back on it now, it seemed that the good Disciple mentioned back then was referring to Lin Yun’er.

Yang Kai felt happy for the little girl. She had found herself a good Master. With a Great Emperor backing her, who would dare to provoke her? Besides, judging from the words transmitted by Iron Blood Great Emperor just now, it would seem that she was also very important to her Master. It could even be said that he doted on and spoiled her, so much so that it led to some prejudice against Yang Kai.

At that thought, Yang Kai rubbed his nose and couldn’t help feeling rather wronged.

Meanwhile, Li Jiao was sweating profusely by the side. He swallowed nervously and asked fearfully, “Was Senior Iron Blood… following us?”

“Probably,” Yang Kai replied casually.

Li Jiao sweated even more profusely, feeling extremely anxious and guilty. Back when Yang Kai and Lin Yun’er had been trapped within the Formation at Wind and Cloud Pavilion, he had slacked in his battle with Hua Xing until the two of them broke out of the Formation. Only then did he go all out. Even if his act could fool the disciples of Wind and Cloud Pavilion, it certainly could not fool a Great Emperor.

Luckily, the Great Emperor seemed to disdain acting against him for such a petty display; otherwise, he would not have returned alive. The horror of narrowly avoiding the gates of Hell left Li Jiao feeling extremely uncomfortable all of a sudden and he declared, “Palace Master Yang, I should be going now since this matter has been settled. This trip has taken quite a long while and I’m worried about how my Sect is doing, so I would like to go back quickly. May…”

“Go ahead,” Yang Kai waved his hand dismissively.

“Then, I will take my leave!” Li Jiao reacted as if his dreams had come true and he hurriedly fled outside while secretly making a vow in his heart, [I have to watch out for fire, thieves, and Yang Kai! Regardless of the circumstances, I will never go on another trip with Palace Master Yang again! It’s too frightening!]
