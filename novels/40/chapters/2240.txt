But that was just a minor benefit. The key point was there were many Masters in the Divine Ascension Mirror, like Yi Quan, Bai Lu, Yuan Fei, Zhou Dian, Yuan Qing, Lian Yan... and even the Great Emperor in front of him, Tian Yan.

If he could refine a Flesh Incarnation Pill in the future, then Yang Kai would be able to summon a force that could sweep through the Star Boundary whenever he wanted!

Just the thought of it was enough to get Yang Kai’s blood pumping!

Tian Yan kept silent, but there was a meaningful smile on his face.

When Yang Kai saw his expression, he understood that he must have overheard his conversation with Grandma You and knew that he possessed the Soul Warming Lotus and what he was thinking about right now when he mentioned communicating with the Will of this World.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel awkward for a while.

After a short while, Tian Yan said, “It is not that this old master is unwilling to help you, but... your cultivation is too low. Unless this world takes the initiative to communicate with you, you will not be able to perceive it. It is impossible even if this old master tries to help you bridge the gap.”

“Does it require the power of an Emperor, the power to communicate with Principles directly?” Yang Kai pondered.

Even though a Dao Source Realm cultivator had insights into Principle Strength, they were at best able to invoke or borrow this power to assist them. On the other hand, an Emperor Realm Master was able to exert direct control over Principles. As for the World Force that was controlled by the Mirror Soul, that was the highest Principle in this world, so to communicate with it, one needed to have the corresponding cultivation.

“That’s right,” Tian Yan nodded his head.

“Then... That’s a shame.” Yang Kai sighed a long sigh.

Tian Yan said, “You have the Seven-Coloured Soul Warming Lotus, so you may still have a chance. However... your own strength must grow a bit more. If you can really subdue the Mirror Soul like that woman said and refine this world, then it may be a good thing for the inhabitants of this realm. This old master will wait in anticipation for such a day to come.”

Yang Kai raised his brows and cupped his fists, “Junior will definitely do his best!”

Tian Yan continued approvingly, “That day will come, but now, the first priority is to deal with these Soul Devouring Insects.”

“But Senior...” Yang Kai looked troubled, “If Senior can’t seal these Soul Devouring Insects, then Junior doesn’t dare to take them away!”

Tian Yan laughed, “Naturally, it is not possible with this old master’s power alone; however, if we can borrow the power of this world... It will naturally be fine to recreate the events of the past.”

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up when he heard this and said eagerly, “Then let’s not dally. Junior will leave it up to Senior.”

Tian Yan nodded lightly before suddenly sitting down cross-legged and entering a meditative state.

Yang Kai waited quietly in place. He knew that Tian Yan was trying to communicate with the Will of this World, the Divine Ascension Mirror’s Mirror Soul.

Tian Yan was a Great Emperor, so there should be a good chance of him achieving this.

In a flash, a Divine Sense as vast as an ocean spread out in all directions, flowing into the void, weaving in and out of the world itself.

Yang Kai felt as small as an ant before this pure and powerful Divine Sense and revealed a look of fascination as he stared in wonder.

This scene lasted for two whole hours.

Just when Yang Kai was starting to feel uncertain, Tian Yan suddenly opened his eyes with a flash of light and spoke, “Little Friend Yang, are you ready?”

At these words, Yang Kai livened up. He understood that Tian Yan had successfully borrowed the power of the World and quickly nodded, “Junior is prepared!”

Tian Yan followed up, “Since you have the Soul Warming Lotus, this Old Master will use it as the foundation to form a seal for these Soul Devouring Insects. But remember, though this Old Master has borrowed the World’s Strength and is supporting it with his own Spiritual Energy, this seal will only last for a short time once you leave this world. Before the deadline comes, you must deal with the Soul Devouring Insects properly, otherwise, the consequences will be unthinkable!”

“Junior will remember this!” Yang Kai nodded seriously.

The seal at the altar had remained indestructible for tens of thousands of years because it had been inside the Divine Ascension Mirror World this whole time, allowing the Mirror Soul to nourish and reinforce it with the World Force it controlled.

But if Yang Kai left here, the sealing power he took with him would be like a tree without roots, a river without a source. It was simply impossible for it to last long.

He had to subdue the Soul Devouring Insects before the seal was broken, or find a way to dispose of them!

Yang Kai made up his mind that if he ultimately could not succeed, he would exile these Soul Devouring Insects into the Void. With his mastery of the Dao of Space, creating a tear to the Void was a simple matter.

“Relax your mind!” Tian Yan shouted.

Yang Kai quickly sat upright and held his breath, concentrating.

In the next moment, he saw the dark altar suddenly melting away before his eyes and at the same time, a sharp buzzing sound emerged. As far as the eye could see, countless Soul Devouring Insects flew out from where the altar once stood.

Looking closely, these Soul Devouring Insects seemed even more violent and unruly than the ones Yang Kai possessed, and the aura they emitted was incomparably ferocious.

After all, these Soul Devouring Insects were once incredibly powerful. They had only become weakened after being sealed for ten thousand years. Even so, they were still much stronger than the ones Yang Kai himself possessed.

Yang Kai had no idea why, but once they were free, they all flew towards him as if something about him attracted them greatly.

Naturally, this scene caused Yang Kai’s scalp to tingle.

He was currently in his Soul Avatar form, so faced with this group of Soul Devouring Insects that were beyond his ability to control, there was no doubt he would be devoured in no time if he were to be surrounded by them. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Even his Conflagrated Knowledge Sea may not be able to restrain them.

But even though he was nervous, he didn’t avoid them.

At the critical moment, Tian Yan made his move.

Great Emperor level Spiritual Energy poured out, and at the same time, a bridge of light suddenly manifested, one end connecting to the distant unknown, and one end connecting to Tian Yan’s body.

The aura emanating from this bridge of light was so great and majestic that it seemed to be able to control everything between the Heavens and Earth.

And, as soon as this bridge appeared, the Soul Devouring Insects went silent for a moment, as if they were extremely afraid.

Tian Yan did not pause, his hands forming a series of seals as he merged his own strength with that coming from the light bridge, condensing a ball of light that slowly wrapped around the Soul Devouring Insects.

In less than ten breaths of time, only that ball of light remained in front of Yang Kai’s eyes.

And, once this was all over, the light around Tian Yan’s body had also grown a little dimmer, as if communicating with the Will of the World had been extremely draining to him.

But he remained indifferent with a solemn face, reaching out to Yang Kai.

In response to that motion, the ball of light flew towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai did not dodge, opening his mind to accept it.

A moment later, the ball of light melted into Yang Kai’s Soul Avatar, and it was brought into the Soul Warming Lotus under his guidance, where it stabilized.

Yang Kai looked inside himself and soon found the ball of light inside the Soul Warming Lotus’s petals contained countless Soul Devouring Insects sealed inside of it.

Even though they were sealed like this, Yang Kai could still sense a great threat from them, and he knew better than anyone that once the ball of light was broken, these Soul Devouring Insects would emerge and eat him from the inside out.

If that were to happen, no one would be able to save him.

“I’ll teach you a set of techniques now, familiarize yourself with them and strengthen the seal!” Tian Yan’s voice came after that.

Yang Kai nodded seriously.

Then, Tian Yan began teaching Yang Kai a sealing art in great detail.

Yang Kai learned it very quickly and mastered it in just under an hour, much to Tian Yan’s praise.

After strengthening the seal with this method, Yang Kai suddenly had a strange look on his face and looked up in a certain direction.

A few tens of thousands of kilometres from Misty Valley in the direction Yang Kai was looking was a small city with a small population.

When Yang Kai looked over, a little boy who looked only about seven or eight with a delicate, chubby, and silly-looking face also turned his head abruptly towards Misty Valley.

A short while later, the little boy’s face became very ugly as he muttered, “What a loss... Tian Yan, that old bastard, he really dragged this Little Master down with him this time. I shouldn’t have responded to him, what a terrible loss...”

He muttered like that for a while but no one paid him any attention.

At that time, a girl with two pigtails suddenly came up to him and yelled fiercely, “Little Fatty, what are you doing? Hurry up and go out of town with this Young Lady! If we go any later, we won’t be able to leave.”

This little girl was also about seven or eight and had a kind of innocent look to her face which quite contrasted with her arrogant way of speaking.

“You actually called me... Little Fatty!” The little boy was fuming and clenched his fair and tender fist as he barked back, “You little girl! Do you have any idea who this Little Master...”

*Peng...*

Before he could finish his sentence, the little girl had jumped up and sent a fist right down onto his head, causing his neck to shrink down and eyes to go red.

“Stop that!” He shouted.

In response, he got an angry dragon fist to the face...

A short while later, the little girl strutted towards the city gate, dragging the Little Fatty along by the hand as he wore a resentful expression on his face. If one saw his face, they would notice two black and blue eyes...

Back in Misty Valley, Tian Yan looked cheerfully at Yang Kai and said, “Little Friend Yang, have you noticed something?”

Only then did Yang Kai come back to his senses and looked in surprise at Tian Yan, “Senior, you knew all along?”

Tian Yan smiled, “Little Friend Yang possesses an astonishing treasure like the Soul Warming Lotus, and the seal from before contained a trace of this world’s power. With the help of the Soul Warming Lotus, Little Friend Yang will naturally be able to easily detect the location of that person!”

When he heard this, Yang Kai quickly cupped his fists and said, “Many thanks, Senior!”

Tian Yan waved his hand and said, “This is all I can do to help. If you really wish to become the Master of this world, you will need to work hard. That person... is not so easy to talk to.”

“Junior understands. If the opportunity comes, Junior will definitely give it a try!”

“This old master also wishes for that day to come. When that time arrives, perhaps this Old Master will also be able to break through the constraints here and go out to the outside world to have a look,” Tian Yan showed a longing expression.

He and Yi Quan basically had the same idea; that they wanted to see the outside world with their own eyes.

Only Yi Quan was interested in it in order to seek out a higher Martial Dao, while Tian Yan wished to achieve it purely out of interest.
