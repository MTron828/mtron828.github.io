Chapter 5500: Acknowledge Me as Your Master

Yang Kai didn’t place much importance on these concerns before, but he quickly performed a deeper investigation and realised that, just as the Old Tree had said, the World Tree clone in his Small Universe drew its nourishment from somewhere else, and the direction it drew nourishment from had a lot to do with the Universe Worlds he refined.

[So that’s how it is!]

The nourishment from the clone feedback was not created out of thin air but from the strength of many Universe Worlds! The prosperity of the Star Boundary was also due to the power drawn from other Universe Worlds.

“But, Old Tree, now that most of the Universe Worlds have been conquered by the Black Ink Clan, why don’t I feel a reduction in the incoming nourishment?” Yang Kai was a little puzzled.

If what the Old Tree claimed was true, only the 2,000 or so Universe Worlds that he refined among the rest remained intact whereas the rest were conquered by the Black Ink Clan. Most of the Universe Worlds conquered by the Black Ink Clan already had a Black Ink Nest planted on them, consuming their World Force clean. There were far fewer Universe Worlds now, which should have meant less nourishment from the World Tree clones.

However, Yang Kai did not feel that was the case; instead, the nourishment from the World Tree clone in his Small Universe remained the same as it was previously, and it was most likely the same for the Star Boundary.

Old Tree replied, “If you only need to nourish one World, input from only a few Universe Worlds is required, somewhere between 100 to 200. The Universe Worlds you saved far exceed that number.”

Understanding this, Yang Kai rejoiced. If he hadn’t saved all these Universe Worlds throughout these years, the nourishment from the World Tree clones would have vanished altogether after the Black Ink Clan had taken control of every Universe World. By that time, the Star Boundary would no longer deserve its title as an Open Heaven Realm Cradle, and even the clone in Yang Kai’s clone in his Small Universe might lose its power.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel a little frightened. Fortunately, he had been working hard to refine Universe Worlds these past 20 years, which led to this unexpected benefit. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Wu Kuang secretly asked Yang Kai, “How many Universe Worlds did you save throughout the years?”

“Around 2,000,” he simply replied.

After some silent calculation, Wu Kuang said again, “If that’s the case, it shouldn’t be a problem to have another 15 World Tree clones.”

According to the World Tree, it only required 100 to 200 Universe Worlds to share their power to nourish a Universe World, so if there were more than 2,000 left, it shouldn’t be a problem to have 15 more World Tree clones.

Realizing that, he hurriedly told Yang Kai, “Hey, Brat, I want one!”

Who in the Open Heaven Realm wouldn’t crave the mystical effects of a World Tree clone? Though Wu Kuang was proficient in the Heaven Devouring Battle Law and his cultivation had advanced rapidly and without problems throughout the years, he could sense some instabilities in his foundation. If he managed to acquire a World Tree clone to protect and sustain his Small Universe, all those potential problems would be solved.

It was precisely because of this consideration that after recognizing the World Tree, Wu Kuang anxiously wanted to refine it. However, due to him being relatively weaker than the other, he was beaten back by Old Tree.

Unfortunately, Yang Kai realized something and shook his head, “I’m afraid there won’t be that many.”

With a nod of approval for Yang Kai, the Old Tree remarked, “Indeed.”

Wu Kuang might be unclear about it, but Yang Kai and Old Tree knew clearly that though it only required 100 to 200 Universe Worlds to nourish a World Tree clone’s World, there was an issue.

There were currently two active clones out there, one in the Star Boundary and one in Yang Kai’s Small Universe; however, the latter required an immense number of Universe Worlds as time flowed significantly faster there than in the outside world.

Understanding this, Yang Kai respectfully asked, “Old Tree, how many more can you offer?”

After a moment of deep consideration, the Old Tree tapped the walking stick in his hand and sighed, “Only three more! Anything more than that will affect the strength of nourishment.”

Wu Kuang’s expression turned dark. If there are 15 more, he may be able to get one, but if it was just three, Yang Kai might not be willing.

After all, he wasn’t that close to Yang Kai.

Without trying to negotiate, as he knew it would be pointless, Yang Kai bowed and said while cupping his fist, “Old Tree, please give me three of your clones!”

The continuance of the World Tree was linked to the survival of 3,000 Worlds, so Yang Kai believed that at times like this, Old Tree would not be stingy. Three World Tree clones was likely the maximum he could offer.

The Old Tree gave a light nod, and the numerous roots on its lower body squirmed. Three of them eventually broke off and sprouted into three tiny saplings.

Just as Wu Kuang prepared to dash forward to snatch one, space around him froze and he became immobile. He knew clearly that it was Yang Kai’s doing. This Brat who manipulated Space Principles was stopping him, causing him to squirm and glare at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai naturally ignored him. After carefully putting the three clones into his Small Universe, he thanked the Old Tree.

The Old Tree waved his hand, “This old man can only do so much. The future of the 3,000 Worlds is in the hands of you Humans. If you win, I can continue to live; otherwise, I will inevitably perish as well.”

“Old Tree may rest assured, the Human Race will not be defeated. However, Junior may come visit you somewhat frequently in the future,” stated Yang Kai immediately.

Now that he could use the World Tree as a transit point to travel around the Great Territories, he would undoubtedly arrive here frequently in the future.

However, this method of travel had its limitations. After using the World Tree to travel back and forth many times, Yang Kai realised that, though this approach enabled him to connect to the World Tree at any moment and arrive at the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, he had to connect to a Universe World of a particular Great Territory if he wished to travel from the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary to that Great Territory as he needed to make use its World Will.

The reason he could travel across almost every Great Territory currently was even though most of the Universe Worlds were occupied by the Black Ink Clan, the Universe World’s Wills had yet to completely vanish. As long as the Universe Worlds still had some semblance of Will, it indicated that the World Tree was still linked to it.

But after some time, it would become difficult for Yang Kai to do this.

Even right now, he couldn’t go to the Black Ink Battlefield, because the Universe Worlds on the Black Ink Battlefield had been dead for many, many years, with their Wills all having been destroyed long ago.

The Old Tree nodded lightly, and without delay, his figure shook and his body returned to its majestic towering tree form again. Most of the fruits on the tree were sick and rotting, a worrying sight.

“By the way, Old Tree, this Junior wants to bring out all the Divine Spirits here since they have strong combat abilities,” Yang Kai made such a request.

There were no other sentient living beings in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary except for the Divine Spirits. These Divine Spirits’ strength were restricted by the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary as well so they weren’t very powerful; even once they departed from here, it would take many years before they completely familiarised themselves with the outside world’s Principles and slowly restored their true strength.

This was the case with Zhu Jiu Yin back then. She had power equivalent to an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, yet when she first left the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, she could at most display power similar to a Seventh-Order Master. After that, it took decades to slowly return to her peak.

There were quite a number of Divine Spirits in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, with Yang Kai having seen dozens of them back when he first came here. There were also a number who he had not met. Every single Divine Spirit here was like another High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master, so bringing them along would be of great help now that the Human Race was in a vulnerable state.

Additionally, these Divine Spirits had always wanted to escape from the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, so Yang Kai thought that they would also be willing to leave with him.

Old Tree replied, “If you wish, this Old Master has no objection, but do keep in mind that the ancestors of these Divine Spirits have histories of wicked deeds that put the 3,000 Worlds in jeopardy. The current generation is innocent of those crimes, but you should be careful.”

Yang Kai now understood why there were so many Divine Spirits gathered here. It was because these Divine Spirits’ ancestors had done something to threaten the stability of the 3,000 Worlds, therefore, the Old Tree imprisoned them here. However, he was not a merciless jailer and gave a chance for these Divine Spirits to escape this prison.

Each time the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary opened, the Divine Spirits could select a Bearer from among the Humans that were swept inside to engage in the Spirit Seizing War, and the Bearer that won would be able to leave the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary with the Divine Spirit that chose them.

Back then, Zhu Jiu Yin had chosen Yang Kai; otherwise, she would not have been able to escape the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary.

To the Human Race, the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary was a Sealed World that they yearned to enter, but to the native Divine Spirits, it was a prison.

Many Divine Spirits never got the chance to leave this place and simply passed away here; after all, the opening of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary was too rare.

“This Junior will tame them well.”

Saying so, he flashed and disappeared into thin air.

Wu Kuang, who was still left frozen in place, cursed Yang Kai furiously.

The next moment, a branch from the Old Tree flicked over and knocked Wu Kuang to the ground, causing the latter to explode in rage!

He had never suffered such humiliation in his entire life of cultivation, not even in the brutal battle with other Great Emperors in the Shattered Star Sea.

In a certain mountain valley, a Divine Spirit resembling an ox with a height of about 3,000 metres was sleeping soundly. It looked exactly like a mountain as it lay there, with white smoke puffing from its nostrils as it snored.

In the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, the Divine Spirits remained essentially inactive because there were no other sentient beings besides them on usual days. It was not until the opening of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary that Humans would flood in, making the atmosphere slightly livelier.

While this Divine Spirit was sleeping soundly, a voice sounded next to his ears, “Zhu Jian, recognize me as your Master, and I shall bring you along to leave the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. Are you willing?”

The next moment, Zhu Jian awoke, and as he opened his eyes, he saw a Human figure. He briefly felt lost for a moment before bursting with excitement.

[A Human!? Does that mean that the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary opened?]

Every opening of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary was an extremely rare opportunity for the Divine Spirits who were trapped here. The remaining Divine Spirits had been jealous of Zhu Jiu Yin for many years ever since she escaped from here last time.

Now that an unfamiliar Human had arrived and was standing right in front of him, Zhu Jian believed that his chance had finally come!

Rising slowly and purposefully releasing the pressure of a Divine Spirit, Zhu Jian looked down onto the tiny Human and laughed sarcastically, “You want me to accept you as my Master? Are you dreaming? Have you ever heard any Divine Spirit acknowledging any other as their Master?”

Yang Kai thought for a while before shaking his head, “No.”

The Divine Spirits had always been arrogant beings; how could it lower their heads for a mere Human?
