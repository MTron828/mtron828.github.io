“Red hair?” Hua Xing was a little puzzled by what Li Jiao said and he looked at Li Jiao questioningly as he shook his head, “She doesn’t have red hair. That little girl has black hair.”

Although he did not know why Li Jiao asked that question, he vaguely sensed that Li Jiao was scared of something.

[He has somebody he fears?] Hua Xing couldn’t help finding the very notion strange.

“Black hair…” Li Jiao breathed out a sigh of relief, [If the girl has black hair, then it’s definitely not Zhu Qing.]

Just in case, he carefully asked for more clarification, “What cultivation does that girl have?”

“First-Order Emperor Realm!”

He was startled by those words, “A mere First-Order Emperor Realm Master?”

[That’s definitely not Zhu Qing!] He was completely at ease now.

“That’s right. That’s why I feel so humiliated!” Hua Xing picked up another bottle of wine and gulped it down. Wiping at his mouth as he complained, “Brother Li, you know about my situation. Despite all the efforts I put in, I only have one son. I was expecting him to inherit my position in the future. W-Who would have thought…” At this point, he sounded choked up.

Li Jiao comforted, “To see one’s child die before oneself… It must be difficult for you, Brother Hua. You have my condolences.”

Hua Xing slammed his hands on the table and murderously vowed, “I have to avenge my son, 0therwise, I can’t call myself a man anymore!”

“This is a deep-seated hatred. It is only natural to take revenge,” Li Jiao hesitated for a moment before asking, “It’s just that I don’t quite understand… Wind and Cloud Pavilion is a top Sect in the Western Territory. Moreover, you are a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, Brother Hua, how can you be helpless against a little girl?”

Hua Xing shook his head and smiled bitterly, “You might not be aware, but that little girl’s strength is extremely unusual despite her seemingly low cultivation. Unfortunately, I underestimated her previously when I sent some of the Masters within the Sect to capture her; as a result, all of them died at her hands, even though some were Second-Order Emperors!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Oh? To think a little girl could fight so many Masters above her own realm!” Li Jiao raised his brow at those words, “It looks like this little girl is quite difficult to deal with.”

He suddenly thought of Yang Kai and solemnly said, “Not many people can fight against those in a higher realm by themselves, but as long as they don’t die early, they will surely become powerful in the future.”

Hua Xing said, “Wind and Cloud Pavilion’s face has taken a huge hit recently. Please help me, Brother Li!”

Li Jiao replied, “You are exaggerating, Brother Hua. That little girl might be strong enough to kill a Second-Order Emperor, but surely she can’t triumph against you if you take action personally. I know the extent of your strength very well and even though I want to help, taking revenge for your son should be done with your own hands… Only by doing so will you truly be able to soothe your anger.”

Upon hearing those words, Hua Xing smiled bitterly, “How can I not know that? Ever since my son was killed, I’ve been unable to rest at all. I can’t wait to rip that cheap slut apart and skin her alive! If I could take revenge with my own hands, I would track that bitch down this instant… it’s just…”

“What is it?” Li Jiao looked at Hua Xing curiously. He couldn’t figure out why Hua Xing would make this request of him.

“Haa… perhaps this will make you understand, Brother Li,” Hua Xing stretched out his hand as he spoke.

Li Jiao stuck out two fingers suspiciously and pressed them against Hua Xing’s wrist. A moment later his expression changed and he uttered in surprise, “You’re injured, Brother Hua? Who could have done this to you?”

Hua Xing replied dejectedly, “When news of my son’s death arrived, I was cultivating in retreat. The shock I received at the time nearly caused a dissonance in my cultivation. Although I managed to stabilize myself, I still suffered a serious backlash. If not for this injury, I would have personally taken action a long time ago. How could I possibly leave that whore alive and free knowing what she did?!”

“So that’s how it is!” Li Jiao nodded lightly, a touch of sympathy appearing on his face. [It’s not easy for Hua Xing either. He only has one son after all. It certainly is difficult to accept that his son was killed so suddenly.]

“That cheap slut is capable of killing a Second-Order Emperor; hence, her strength is certainly not low. I am not in my best condition at the moment, and if I act rashly… It’s fine if I succeed, but it will be a disaster if I were to fail.”

“You are right, Brother Hua,” Li Jiao pondered for a moment, “I understand what you are trying to say, Brother Hua. Rest assured, you can leave this to me. I will let that little girl know the consequences of her actions!”

The moment Hua Xing heard those words, he was overjoyed and stood up before bowing deeply, “Many thanks, Brother Li! With you personally taking action, that cheap slut won’t stand a chance no matter how talented she is!”

Li Jiao helped Hua Xing up with a smile, “I’ve been repeating this again and again, Brother Hua, I won’t stand idly by if you are in trouble. But… I don’t know that little girl’s current whereabouts.”

Hua Xing solemnly said, “I’ll be truthful with you, Brother Li. That slut is currently in Great Cloud City, just thirty kilometres away from Wind and Cloud Pavilion.”

“She dares to make her way here?” Li Jiao’s expression soured as he snorted, “Her courage isn’t small.”

Hua Xing said through gritted teeth, “That’s certainly the case. Her strength has gone to her head and she must believe she can look down on my Wind and Cloud Pavilion as a result! I’ll have to trouble you for this, Brother Li.”

Li Jiao said, “Since she is not that far away, why don’t we let her break into Wind and Cloud Pavilion before I make my move? I won’t let her escape.”

Hua Xing smiled bitterly, “If she succeeded in attacking Wind and Cloud Pavilion and breaking the Sect Defending Array, then…”

Li Jiao thought about it and immediately understood Hua Xing’s worries. Thus, he nodded and said, “That certainly wouldn’t look good. I was too careless in my thoughts. Good, I’ll head to Great Cloud City and capture her.”

“That’s exactly what I was hoping for. Many thanks, Brother Li.”

“This shouldn’t be delayed any longer; I’ll go now.” While speaking, Li Jiao stood up and walked outside.

“I’ll be waiting for good news from you, Brother Li!” Hua Xing saw Li Jiao off.

From the top of the mountain peak, Li Jiao soared into the air and flew off into the distance. When his figure disappeared from sight, the smile on Hua Xing’s face gradually vanished as he stood there frowning while deep in thought for a while. Afterwards, he coldly snorted and strode away.

In his opinion, making Li Jiao take action was enough to make this trip worthwhile. He couldn’t obtain any background information on that man and woman; however, judging from the way they dared to attack Wind and Cloud Pavilion so blatantly, it was clear that they had some sort of profound backing. If they really turned out to have strong backgrounds, then the blame for upsetting them will fall on Li Jiao. It will have nothing to do with Wind and Cloud Pavilion, so Hua Xing only needed to wait quietly for the news.

In Great Cloud City, the air was filled with the smell of blood. Ruins were scattered everywhere while the ground was covered in fresh bloodstains and torn limbs.

Great Cloud City was only thirty kilometres away from Wind and Cloud Pavilion and could be considered an important industry for the Sect as well as a hub of communication with the outside world. In other words, this city was the commercial heart of Wind and Cloud Pavilion.

Yang Kai and Lin Yun’er were travelling with a clear goal in mind. It was obvious that they planned to go straight to Wind and Cloud Pavilion. Therefore, it was only natural for Great Cloud City under Wind and Cloud Pavilion to take precautions against them.

Inside a certain palace, a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master led a team consisting of several hundred disciples. In addition, many other Emperor Realm Masters attracted by the reward were gathered as well. They had long since set up an impressive array and were waiting for their targets to walk right into their trap.

For that reason, Yang Kai and Lin Yun’er were noticed the moment they stepped into Great Cloud City, and a huge battle instantly broke out.

In just an hour, Great Cloud City was practically in ruins. Hundreds of disciples of Wind and Cloud Pavilion suffered heavy casualties, and even the Second-Order Emperor Realm Master leading the team had been blown away by a punch from Lin Yun’er.

With the Spirit Array broken, the rest scattered. The disciples of Wind and Cloud Pavilion that survived the battle hurriedly fled back to their headquarters while the Emperor Realm Masters, attracted by the bounty, were either dead or making a run for it. The entire Great Cloud City was a chaotic mess as everybody was thrown into panic.

On the way to the city, Li Jiao landed in front of a group of blood-stained Wind and Cloud Pavilion disciples that were currently fleeing.

“What happened here?” Li Jiao released his Emperor Pressure, suppressing the group of disciples so that they did not dare to take any rash actions.

“You are… Senior Li?” A First-Order Emperor Realm Master leading the group recognized Li Jiao and called out with joy.

“Who are you?” Li Jiao squinted at the man.

That First-Order Emperor Realm Master hurriedly cupped his fists and said, “Greetings Senior Li, I am Wind and Cloud Pavilion’s Ninth Elder, Cai Shi.”

“You know me?”

Cai Shi quickly replied, “I saw you once from afar when you came to the Sect a few days ago.”

“Oh. So, that was you.” Li Jiao had a vague impression of this man. He seemed to recall greeting this person back when he first arrived at Wind and Cloud Pavilion. Frowning, he asked, “Why are you in such terrible condition?”

Cai Shi blushed and said in embarrassment, “I am ashamed to say that the invaders were too powerful and I was not their opponent. The Sect’s Masters were all either killed or suffered heavy injuries.”

“That little girl is that strong?” Li Jiao raised his eyebrows.

Cai Shi replied, “The Second Elder died tragically at her hands. Moreover, the Nine Serenity Chain Spirit Array we arranged as a trap was destroyed in less than an hour.”

Li Jiao narrowed his eyes as he commented, “It looks like Wind and Cloud Pavilion has offended an incredibly powerful enemy this time.”

Cai Shi said, “I can only ask the Pavilion Master to take action now. I’m afraid he is the only one that can suppress her.”

Li Jiao raised his hand and said, “There’s no need to bother the Pavilion Master to take action. He has entrusted this matter to me. I will take care of that little girl.”

Cai Shi’s eyes lit up upon hearing this and couldn’t help asking, “Senior Li will be stepping in?”

“Why else would I come here?” Li Jiao replied proudly.

“Good good! With Senior Li here, that cheap slut will certainly be defeated!”

Li Jiao impatiently said, “Come with me. The faster we resolve this issue, the faster we can return.”

“Yes, of course! Please come this way, Senior Li!” Cai Shi excitedly replied, the terror on his face vanishing into thin air. He had heard from Hua Xing before that Li Jiao had a trace of the Dragon’s bloodline in him. Therefore, Hua Xing was no match for Li Jiao even though they were both Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters.

[With such a powerful Master taking action, things will become much easier!] Wind and Cloud Pavilion had suffered heavy losses, with even the Second Elder being killed; therefore, Cai Shi was worrying about how he was going to report the outcome of the battle upon his return. At that moment, Li Jiao had appeared like a hero to save them, so how could he not be overjoyed?

In his opinion, regardless of how strong the young man and woman in Great Cloud City were, they couldn’t win against Li Jiao. As long as they could capture and bring those two back, it should be enough to redeem themselves and salvage some of Wind and Cloud Pavilion’s face. Hence, he was extremely diligent and even took the initiative to lead the way.

It didn’t take long before the small group arrived at Great Cloud City again.

Li Jiao swept his Divine Sense over the city and upon seeing the destruction that had been wrought, he frowned involuntarily as he thought to himself, [These people from Wind and Cloud Pavilion are so useless. How could they be so helpless against one little girl? I wonder how Hua Xing taught his disciples… If this matter were to occur at Fire Dragon Palace, that little girl would have died several times over by now.]

“Where are they?” Li Jiao asked with a scowl as he could not sense the enemy’s aura.

Cai Shi replied, “They should be in the City Lord’s Mansion. They killed many people from the Sect previously before breaking into the City Lord’s Mansion. They are clearly looking to obtain some riches.”
