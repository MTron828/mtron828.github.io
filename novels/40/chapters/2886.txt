The bald Shaman King could not understand how the Sacred Treasure of the South Barbarian Clan appeared in the hands of this man named Shaman Niu.

The descent of the Black Brilliance destroyed several hundred thousand South Barbarian Clansmen, including all the South Barbarian Clan Shaman Kings who were alive at the time. It only made sense that the Sacred Treasure was lost or destroyed together with the death of those Shaman Kings, yet now it appeared right in front of his eyes.

[Could it be that this Shaman Niu had been on that battlefield?]

This idea was extinguished as soon as it appeared though because as far as the bald Shaman King knew, a highly authoritative and mighty Demon Saint, which was equivalent to the existence of a Shaman Saint, was present that day. If this Shaman Niu really took part in the battlefield, how could it be possible for him to come back alive?

It was somewhat different from the Bone Devouring Clan’s expectations that the South Barbarian Clan still had a Shaman King, and the Sacred Treasure still existed.

Led by the bald Shaman King, several Shaman Kings of the Bone Devouring Clan exchanged eye contact silently to communicate with each other and reached a consensus shortly after.

The bald Shaman King then spoke, “Shaman Niu, hand over the Sacred Treasure. Since you have taken refuge with the Demon Race, you are no longer a son of the Barbarian Gods.”

Yang Kai snorted, “Which eye of yours saw that we have taken refuge under the Demon Race?”

Shaman Chi barked sternly, “Do you still deny it? If you didn’t take refuge under the Demon Race, why are you still saving this Demon King?”

Yang Kai replied, “I told you, he is my subordinate, of course I had to save him!”

Shaman Chi smiled contemptuously, “Based on your words, do you mean that this Demon King was subdued by you?”

“Exactly!”

Shaman Chi burst out laughing, obviously not believing it. The other Shaman Kings also shook their heads slightly, thinking that Yang Kai was too shameless to make such an exaggerated boast! Before this, Yang Kai was just a Shaman Grandmaster, so how could he force a Demon King to submit? A Demon King was an existence that was equivalent to them, the Shaman Kings. They had the same arrogance and pride, so if they were in the same position, they would never succumb to the tyranny of a Demon Great General and would rather die honourably than live in shame.

“You have been demonised, and you are also transformed into a Demon!” The bald Shaman King sighed, “Fortunately, you are not deeply affected by the demonisation. If you hand over Sacred Treasure, the South Barbarian Clan may still be pardoned.”

“I would know if I had transformed into a Demon. Sir doesn’t need to worry, I am here today to take away the people from my Shaman Niu Clan. I hope Sirs can grant my request!”

Shaman Chi boomed sternly, “Spare the nonsense, this guy is delirious. He just wants to rescue this Demon King. Let me kill him and take back the Sacred Treasure!”

Shaman Chi lost his temper and took action in a flash. His Shaman Strength was already activated when he spoke and a huge skull suddenly appeared and quickly expanded to the size of a house, opening its mouth to bite at Yang Kai, attempting to swallow him.

The bald Shaman King and the others watched indifferently, none of them attempting to stop Shaman Chi or help him, all of them apparently silently approving of his actions.

Yang Kai had seen this skull before. Shaman Chi summoned the same Shaman Artifact when the two of them fought last time. It was extremely vicious and sinister, and its power now seemed to be much greater than previously.

Yang Kai welcomed the sinister aura that rushed right towards his face with squinted eyes.

The skull descended and swallowed him whole.

Shaman Chi was stunned, as he did not expect it to be so easy. Joy crept up his face but quickly turned into shock because in the next moment, an Earth-shaking sword light escaped through the seven orifices of the skull. The entire skull flew out and began wobbling about like a headless fly through the air, regardless of how Shaman Chi tried to control it. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Shaman Chi’s face changed drastically as he quickly changed his hand seal.

The skull opened its mouth wide, and Yang Kai and his sword were expelled in the form of a sword light. Whatever remained of the skull shrank rapidly at that point, greatly losing its spirituality.

Shaman Chi’s eyes were about to pop from their sockets in fury as his heart ached terribly. How could the strength of this Shaman Niu be so terrifying? He suffered a small loss the last time they clashed when he was a Low-Rank Shaman King and Yang Kai was a Low-Rank Shaman Grandmaster, but Shaman Chi thought he would be able to regain some of his dignity this time and never expected his opponent’s growth to be even greater than his own.

He was not Yang Kai’s opponent at all. Even though it was only a short confrontation, Shaman Chi was sure of it.

[Luckily I’m not alone…] Shaman Chi thought silently as he looked up.

On the other side, in front of Yang Kai stood the bald Shaman King, who seemed to have foreseen this coming, and intercepted him ahead of time. He raised his hand and a pitch-black lance blasted towards Yang Kai. The power of the lance was amazing and seemed to flip the Heavens and Earth upside down.

A mighty blow without reservations from a High-Rank Shaman King was naturally extremely terrifying.

As he struck, he bellowed, “Shaman Niu, you are the matchless prodigy of our Barbarian Race. By right you would have great achievements in the future, but it’s a pity that you had no self-respect and succumbed to the Demon Race. The Barbarian Race cannot forgive you, you must die here today.”

Yang Kai laughed heartily, “Many have wanted my life, and none of them have had good ends. Sir, you will be no exception!”

Saying so, he pointed the Myriads Sword forward, and a cold light flashed before the sword swung with the ferocity of a dragon.

The pitch-black energy lance was shattered by the sword strike and its remnants melted like snowflakes under the scorching sun.

The bald Shaman King remained calm and quickly reacted. With a single thought, his hand seal changed, and the shattered black energy suddenly shrank, immediately transforming into a cage that attempted to capture Yang Kai inside of it.

At the same time, apart from Shaman Chi, the other three Shaman Kings had also arrived, all of them looking ruthless, holding no reservations.

They were determined to finish off Yang Kai here, not only because Yang Kai and the Bone Devouring Clan had old grudges, but also because he possessed the South Barbarian Clan’s Sacred Treasure.

On top of that, the Shaman Niu Clan mingled with the Demon Race, so his death would not be worth pitying. Even if the entire Clan was slaughtered, the other Clans would not disapprove.

More than twenty thousand people from the Shaman Niu Clan gasped loudly. Yue and Lu, and the other Shamans were even more nervous and desperately wanted to assist Yang Kai, but unfortunately, they knew that they would not be much of a help with such a drastic difference in strength. They made up their minds that if anything happened to Sir Shaman Niu, they would immediately revolt and fight back, preferring to be killed by the people of Bone Devouring Clan than ending up as their food.

On the stage, in the face of the joint attack of the four Shaman Kings, Yang Kai remained calm. He swung the Myriads Sword in every direction in a seemingly chaotic, unorganized manner, but somehow the few swings completely shattered the Shamanic Spells of the other Shaman Kings, leaving only the cage of the bald Shaman King, in which he remained firmly bound.

Yang Kai’s body tensed at that moment as a majestic power erupted from within him. The formless black cage suddenly inflated several times its original size and began emitting a vague cracking sound, as if it might shatter at any time.

The bald Shaman King’s face changed slightly at this sight and no longer dared to hesitate, chanting an obscure incantation between his lips.

The other four Shaman Kings looked solemn and joined in the chanting together.

The voices of the five Shaman Kings quickly merged together into one voice, where none of its components could be distinguished from the others. Followed by the change of incantation, a gigantic unmatched skeletal hand appeared out of thin air. The skeletal hand was almost a hundred metres in size and grabbed downwards at a seemingly slow but actually fast speed towards Yang Kai.

The grip of this skeletal hand was so powerful that even the surrounding World Principles were trapped by it.

Yang Kai inexplicably felt himself being choked as his body bent as if a giant mountain was pressing down on his neck, making it impossible for him to stand straight.

He was amazed by what he saw. Although he did not know what Shamanic Spell this was, since it required five Shaman Kings working together to cast, it could not be ignored. Kicking Bao Qi, who was next to him, out of the stage, Yang Kai flickered to the side.

There was a loud bang, and the skeletal hand clutched the newly built stage, crushing it into powder.

Before Yang Kai could stand firm though, the huge skeletal hand already made a second attempt to capture him. Yang Kai’s face darkened, but just as he was considering testing the abilities of this skeletal hand by facing it head-on, he suddenly saw a visible scorching light radiating from its palm. The scorching light leapt across space in an instant and shot directly towards his chest.

Yang Kai hurriedly dodged again.

This repeated for the following consecutive attacks.

Yang Kai soon grew infuriated and shouted furiously, “Enough!”

Shaman Chi guffawed, “Flee, just continue to flee, let’s see how long more you can flee!”

“Shaman Chi, you court death!” Yang Kai glared at him coldly.

“You are having trouble fending for yourself, and you still have the time to threaten me?” Shaman Chi curled his lips disdainfully, “You’d best care for your own life first.”

“You already know why I must remain passive!” Yang Kai retorted coldly while evading the attacks of the chasing skeleton hand.

Shaman Chi chuckled, “Only someone incompetent would run. Everyone has the innate instinct to preserve his own life.”

“You’re wrong.” Yang Kai shook his head slightly, and said plainly, “I just don’t want Sir Shaman Saint to chase me down.”

“Why would Sir Shaman Saint chase you down?” Shaman Chi frowned.

Yang Kai grinned cunningly, showing his fangs, “If I killed all of you, do you think Sir Shaman Saint wouldn’t hunt me down?”

Shaman Chi froze for a moment, and then burst into laughter as if he heard some funny joke, “Just you alone? Do you want to kill all of us with only your pitiful strength? Shaman Niu, are you still dreaming?”

Yang Kai stopped talking to him and turned to the bald Shaman King, “All of you shouldn’t die at my hands. The Demon Race is still raging across this land, so your strength should be used to deal with those Demon Kings!”

“You don’t need to worry about the Demon Kings, we will take care of them. You, on the other hand, should surrender without a fight.” The bald Shaman King replied coldly.

Yang Kai sighed, and finally remarked with difficulty, “It’s not too late to stop now, otherwise… you will bear all the consequences!”

The bald Shaman King seemed to become maddened too and shouted, “This is the first time I have seen a person blurt out such preposterous words. I hope you are more capable than your words!” With a snort, he pushed his Shaman Strength even more fiercely, causing the giant skeletal hand’s might to increase again.

“Then have a look for yourself if I am capable or not!” Yang Kai suddenly stopped fleeing and stood his ground, his Myriads Sword lifted slightly.

The five Shaman Kings of Bone Devouring Clan were horrified at the sight of it, knowing that Yang Kai was really going to take this seriously, and immediately urged the giant skeletal hand to grab him.

The tiny figure and the huge skeletal hand created a very sharp visual contrast to every Barbarian who watched this scene, whether it was the clansmen of Bone Devouring Clan or the clansmen of the Shaman Niu Clan. At this moment, none of them were aware that they were holding their breaths, as they witnessed something exciting enough to be recorded in the annals of history.
