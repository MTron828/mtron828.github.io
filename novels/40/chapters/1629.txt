Chapter 1629, House Arrest

Ran Yun Ting was stunned.

Since she brought Su Yan back to Pure Ice Island nearly thirty years ago, she had never seen her smile. Today was a first.

This sudden blooming smile formed a diametrically opposite contrast to Su Yan’s cold aloofness, and combined with her flawless beauty, Ran Yun Ting was slightly dumbstruck for a moment.

In her heart, a sense of inferiority welled up uncontrollably.

Unfortunately, Ran Yun Ting soon dispelled these distracting thoughts and asked with a gloomy face, “You actually had a man? Since when?”

“Since a long time before I met Honoured Master.”

“Has your relationship with him ever been intimate?” Ran Yun Ting continued to ask.

Su Yan’s cheeks blushed slightly as she nodded.

Ran Yun Ting’s body trembled and she nearly lost her ability to stand, stumbling backwards a few steps as an obvious look of disappointment flashed across her eyes and she said in a pained voice, “Why didn’t you mention this earlier?”

“Honoured Master never asked,” Su Yan bit her red lips lightly.

Ran Yun Ting snapped back, “I didn’t ask because your aura was completely pure, so I assumed you still had your innocence! But since you have had intimate relations with a man, why is there no impurities in your aura?”

Once a woman experienced intimacy with a man, some Yang Essence which belonged to that man would inevitably remain in her body. This aura was more than enough to indicate a loss of innocence.

Su Yan’s aura, however, was still pure, so Ran Yun Ting never even dreamed she was no longer a virgin.

[Is it because of her Special Constitution?] It was also possible that Su Yan’s physique was not innate but one she acquired, and perhaps when this happened her aura had been purified.

“Such impropriety!” Ran Yun Ting grit her teeth and shouted.

“Disciple has disappointed Honoured Master,” Su Yan lowered her eyes.

“If I knew about this, I would never have allowed you to cultivate the Ice Jade Secret Art!” Ran Yun Ting was heartbroken as all her expectations for Su Yan turned into disappointment and she said with red eyes, “Do you know that after cultivating the Ice Jade Secret Art, once you encounter an emotional backlash, things will only get worse? Your current situation isn’t too serious, but if things are left as they are, you will eventually lose your entire cultivation and degenerate into a waste!”

“Disciple did not know!” Su Yan shook her head but showed no trace of fear.

When she came to Pure Ice Island and worshipped Ran Yun Ting as her Master, she had simply followed Ran Yun Ting’s instructions and cultivated whatever Secret Art she was given. How could she have raised any objections? It was only a few days ago, when she noticed a problem with her Secret Art, that any doubts came to her mind.

Ran Yun Ting’s expression darkened as she was aware of the seriousness of this problem, and although she was greatly disappointed in Su Yan’s concealment of her romantic history, in the end, she was still very optimistic about her Disciple. Anxiously, she said, “Su Yan, it’s not too late. Cut off your emotional ties immediately, otherwise, your cultivation will continue to regress, and you will eventually become an ordinary mortal. Once that happens, no one will be able to save you.”

“Cut my emotional ties?” Su Yan raised her head and looked at Ran Yun Ting, a strange light flashing across her beautiful eyes before she slowly but firmly shook her head. “Honoured Master, forgive me, but Disciple is unable to do this.”

“You...” Ran Yun Ting was infuriated as she pointing to Su Yan, unable to say a word.

Su Yan simply smiled again, “If I can see him again, even if Disciple degenerates into an ordinary mortal, she is willing.”

Ran Yun Ting became dazed as she stared at Su Yan blankly, “Are these your true feelings? Are you certain you won’t regret it?”

Su Yan nodded.

“Have you not realized that this is just you seeking temporary happiness at the expense of your future? If you really become an ordinary mortal, your life span will become less than a hundred years and it won’t be long before you become a withered old woman. When that happens, will that man of yours still have any interest in you? When that happens, it’s likely he will simply abandon you!”

Su Yan’s tender body trembled as a hint of fear flashed across her beautiful eyes.

When Ran Yun Ting saw this, she knew she had a chance and was just about to strike while the iron was hot, but before she could, that trace of fear in Su Yan’s eyes disappeared. Su Yan stretched out her hand, brushed her hair back behind her ear, and whispered, “If I can be together with him again, Disciple is still willing. When the time comes, Disciple will simply leave before she grows old, so she does not have to show him such an unsightly appearance.”

“Madness!” Ran Yun Ting’s chest heaved up and down violently.

She had never known that her disciple has such a stubborn, unreasonable side.

“Honoured Master, disciple wants to go out!” Su Yan quickly said.

“Do you want to go out to look for that man?” Ran Yun Ting looked at her coldly. Before, she thought Su Yan wanted to go out to seek for an opportunity to break through her current bottleneck, but now, how could she not understand her Disciple’s true intentions?

Obviously, Su Yan wanted to leave to seek out the person from that painting.

“Yes, please permit me, Honoured Master!” Su Yan did not try to deny it.

“In your dreams!” Ran Yun Ting coldly snorted, “From now on, you will remain in the Inner Island and not take one step outside. Master will find a way to solve your current difficulties for you, I hope you will not disappoint me any further.”

“Honoured Master!” Su Yan objected anxiously.

Ran Yun Ting just snorted and yelled sharply, “Come in!”

Two women with First-Order Origin Realm cultivations walked in immediately and politely cupped their fists, “What are Great Elder’s orders!”

“Bring Su Yan back to her residence and watch her carefully. If she dares to take a single step outside without my permission, I will hold both of you responsible!”

The two women looked at each other with stunned expressions, neither of them understanding what Su Yan could have done to anger Great Elder so greatly.

One had to know that Great Elder Ran had always been extremely proud of Su Yan and even bragged outside countless times that accepting Su Yan as her Disciple was the best decision she had ever made in her life.

Su Yan was definitely the greatest candidate to become the future pillar of Ice Heart Valley. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

But now, Ran Yun Ting had obviously become infuriated with Su Yan, to the point of putting her under house arrest.

What exactly had happened?

The two women did not dare to ask more and just glanced at Su Yan thoughtfully and said, “Junior Sister Su, please.”

“Honoured Master...” Su Yan looked at Ran Yun Ting beggingly, hoping she would change her mind.

“Take her!” Ran Yun Ting turned her back to Su Yan and screamed, as if she never wanted to see her again.

“Junior Sister Su, please don’t make things difficult for us,” Among the two girls, the taller woman frowned and urged impatiently.

Su Yan stared at Ran Yun Ting’s back and sighed softly, knowing that nothing would work. Bowing slightly, she turned around and walked out.

Soon, only Ran Yun Ting was left inside the ice room.

Staring at the portrait hanging on the ice wall with fiery eyes, she wanted nothing more than to cut up this man into a thousand pieces. Lifting her hand, she palmed forward mercilessly.

With a bang, the portrait instantly turned into dust.

“Little brat, you best not fall into the hands of this Queen, otherwise, I will definitely tear your corpse into ten thousand pieces!” Ran Yun Ting declared viciously.

As long as there was still a chance to rectify Su Yan’s situation, Ran Yun Ting wouldn’t hesitate to kill Yang Kai to dispel her disciple’s heart demon.

If Su Yan was unwilling to cut off her emotions, her Honoured Master would do it for her!

As long as this man died, Su Yan’s path forward would no longer be hindered, and she would not continue to suffer backlash from the Ice Jade Secret Art.

Perhaps she would be sad and disappointed for a while, but Ran Yun Ting believed that as time passed, Su Yan would only feel grateful and not resent her.

After thinking so, Ran Yun Ting quickly left her ice room and headed towards the ice peak where the Supreme Elder was in seclusion. She had to ask the Supreme Elder about this matter as she was not actually certain if this method would be effective. So long as Ran Yun Ting could get a nod from the Supreme Elder, she wouldn’t have any worries left.

The Inner Island of Pure Ice Island had many cross-crossing paths that lead in all directions.

Many female disciples of Ice Heart Valley were walking about the unique buildings carved from pure, crystal ice.

Su Yan walked along a certain ice road in despair, making her way back to her room step by step.

The two female responsible for guarding her followed closely behind while exchanging Divine Sense Messages with each other.

“Senior Sister Zhou, what mistake do you think Su Yan made to enrage Great Elder to this extent?” The shorter woman asked suspiciously.

The taller Senior Sister Zhou just coldly snorted, “Great Elder didn’t say, so how would I know? But no matter what happened, it certainly is no trivial matter. Otherwise, Great Elder would not put Su Yan under house arrest. Hmph, this little girl truly does not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth; since entering Ice Heart Valley, she has always had eyes atop her head, never putting us Senior Sisters in her eyes. Even if we met by chance, she would never offer greetings or display any kind of courtesy at all.”

“En, she’s relied completely on Great Elder’s favour to do as she pleases,” The petite woman snickered, “Now that she has offended Great Elder and fallen out of favour, let’s see if she dares act arrogant again in the future.”

“As her Senior Sisters, it’s time we teach her how to behave.”

The two looked at each other and smiled knowingly. They felt extremely happy right now, as if the sky had become brighter today.

As she was walking along though, Su Yan suddenly stopped, and her eyes brightened. Turning towards a certain direction, her figure flickered and flew off.

The expressions of the two women who had been following her changed dramatically as they thought Su Yan was trying to escape, but in the next moment, they saw her arrive in front of a few other Ice Heart Valley disciples.

“What now?” The woman surnamed Zhou showed an unhappy expression as she hurried over.

Nearby, a few Ice Heart Valley disciples who were talking in low voices wore confused looks on their faces. They did not understand why Su Yan had suddenly run over to them. The leader of this group, a woman with a powerful Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation, frowned slightly as she observed Sun Yan and asked, “Aren’t you Great Elder Ran’s Disciple, Su Yan?”

“She’s Su Yan?”

“I heard that she was only a Third-Order Saint when she first arrived here, but now, in less than thirty years, she’s almost reached the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm.”

“I also heard those rumours, so this is what she looks like.”

The several women walked up to and began looking towards Su Yan, as if this was the first time they had ever seen her.

“Yes,” Su Yan nodded. “Greetings, Senior Sisters!”

“En, do you have some business with us?” The lead woman asked.

“I just heard several Senior Sisters discussing... discussing the person in that portrait. Have you met him before?” Su Yan pointed to the portrait held by the leading woman.

“You mean this fellow?” The lead woman raised the portrait and laughed lightly. “I’ve indeed met him before.”

Su Yan’s eyes lit up and she asked urgently, “When did Senior Sister meet him, is he... is he well?”
