If Emperors stood at the peak of the Star Boundary, then Titled Emperors stood at the peak of Emperors.

This Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was definitely one such figure.

[Wu Meng Chuan is a descendant of a Titled Emperor?] Such a reality was really beyond Yang Kai’s expectations.

Judging from the title of this Great Emperor, it was obvious he also cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Law. Or rather, the Heaven Devouring Battle Law must be an inheritance passed down by Heaven Devouring Great Emperor.

Yang Kai was stunned!

Could a Titled Emperor’s cultivation technique be described as simply precious? This was a world-shaking treasure! If the news of its existence spread, it was likely that even Emperors would desperately try to snatch it.

Yang Kai suddenly felt quite uncomfortable. He now knew such a big secret, so would Wu Meng Chuan really just ignore his existence, or would he instead try to silence him permanently?

What’s more... why did he pass the Heaven Devouring Battle Law to him in the first place? This Secret Art was undoubtedly his most precious possession.

Yang Kai did not believe for a moment that Wu Meng Chuan was a kind and generous person. Judging from his current behaviour, this old man was as cruel and vicious as could be. Even his loyal subordinates who had followed him for years even after being imprisoned could be killed at will by him, so how could he be anything remotely resembling virtuous and magnanimous?

Considering all this, Yang Kai secretly became vigilant and decided to release his Monster Insect Queen immediately if something was wrong.

As if perceiving the change in Yang Kai’s demeanour, Wu Meng Chuan turned his head and gave Yang Kai a low laugh.

Yang Kai felt his hair stand on end.

Fortunately, Wu Meng Chuan did not seem to pay him any mind and just muttered in a low voice, “Hmph, if it wasn’t for one of you leaking this information, how could those four thieves have learnt that this old master is the descendant of Heaven Devouring Great Emperor? After mastering the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, how could this old master have wound up so miserable if not for your betrayal? This old master has no intention of trying to find the guilty party though. Once you all die, all of you will be absolved of your sins.”

Saying so, Wu Meng Chuan pushed his Heaven Devouring Battle Law even more fiercely.

Standing behind him, Yang Kai had to work extremely hard to resist the suction force that threatened to pull his Soul and essence out.

Today, he had learned so many secrets he had not yet had time to digest.

Inferring from Wu Meng Chuan’s words, he was probably sold out by one of his own subordinates, and as a result, the four Protectors came to learn of his true lineage and about the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, which lead them to betray and imprison him here in hopes of extracting the Heaven Devouring Battle Law from him.

Conspiracies and traps, together with sneak attacks, were likely involved as well.

However, Wu Meng Chuan obviously had not cooperated, otherwise, he definitely would not be alive today. He would have been killed by the four Protectors long ago.

Who would not covet the Secret Art of a Titled Emperor? It was understandable that when the four Protectors learned of this that they decided to attack Wu Meng Chuan; after all, each of them was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm master as well, so if the four of them all launched a sneak attack, their chances of success were quite high.

Just as many distracting thoughts flashed across Yang Kai’s mind, the screams in the surrounding cells subsided, and the vitality of those cultivators quickly dissipated.

Yang Kai turned his head to look around and found that the appearance of these people after they died was extremely pitiful, like withered husks that had decayed over hundreds of years. There was not a single trace of vitality left in any of them.

After devouring the vitality and life essence of so many people, Wu Meng Chuan had gone from looking like a decrepit old man to a handsome middle-aged man in his thirties or forties.

And judging from the violent fluctuations emerging from his body, his cultivation had already been restored to the Third-Order Dao Source Realm!

Turning his eyes, he grinned at Yang Kai and said, “Let’s go, this old master must wash this place in blood today. En, this old master smells the aura of an old acquaintance approaching, truly nostalgic!”

Saying so, he began walking outwards.

Wherever Wu Meng Chuan walked, the cultivators locked in cells adjacent to him would scream out as streams of their vitality were sucked up and swallowed by him. Those that were slightly weaker would die directly while those who had some strength would suffer longer as Wu Meng Chuan drained them dry.

Along the way, Wu Meng Chuan’s aura grew even more powerful and frightening.

Even Yang Kai felt a deep sense of fear towards the violent fluctuations coming from him and wondered if this Wu Meng Chuan would be able to consume so much energy or whether he would explode and die from it.

At that time, several figures quickly approached from the front. With such a huge disturbance, it was obvious something had gone wrong inside the Bone Prison, so a team of guards had come in to investigate. The leader of this group was none other than Yan Xiu Ran and behind him were the two guards who had been responsible for torturing Yang Kai during his last stay here.

Just after these three entered the Bone Prison, and before they even had time to figure out the situation, they were palmed dead by Wu Meng Chuan as he strolled towards the exit.

After their physiques burst into blood-mist, that very mist was quickly swallowed up by Wu Meng Chuan.

“Brother Yang...” Liu Xian Yun’s voice called out from the darkness.

Wu Meng Chuan’s eyes flashed coldly as he was about to attack Liu Xian Yun when Yang Kai hurriedly shouted, “Senior, she’s my friend!”

“Your friend?” Wu Meng Chuan looked at Liu Xian Yun coldly for a moment, seemingly hesitating, but after a short pause he nodded and said, “Fine, she’s too weak to be of any use to this old master anyways.”

“Many thanks for not killing her, Senior!” Yang Kai exhaled heavily.

If Wu Meng Chuan really attacked Liu Xian Yun just now, he would not be able to just sit back and watch and would be forced to fight.

Fortunately, that didn’t happen.

“Brother Yang, this Senior is...” Liu Xian Yun didn’t even realize how close she had come to the gates of death, but she understood that Wu Meng Chuan was not someone to trifle with. In that brief moment he had stared at her, Liu Xian Yuin had felt cold sweat drip from her forehead, making her unable to even breathe.

“This is Senior Wu,” Yang Kai casually explained before turning to Wu Meng Chuan and asking, “Can Senior help lift the seal on my friend?”

Although Yang Kai could also break the seal for Liu Xian Yun now, it would definitely take him some time, so it would be best if Wu Meng Chuan could help him.

Wu Meng Chuan didn’t speak when he heard this request and simply waved his hand, unlocking the seal on Liu Xian Yun’s body directly and allowing her to access her cultivation again.

“Kid, after you leave here, take your friend and run as far as you can,” Wu Meng Chuan suddenly said lightly.

“Hm?” Yang Kai was startled.

He had been wracking his brain trying to figure out how to escape from Wu Meng Chuan all this time; after all, he now knew the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, which was the very reason Wu Meng Chuan had been imprisoned back then.

He felt that Wu Meng Chuan would never allow him to leave with such a precious Secret Art in his possession.

However, this old man actually just encouraged him to run away.

There was definitely more to this situation than he realized! It was just that Yang Kai was unable to see through the fog. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“What’s wrong? Don’t you want to leave?” Wu Meng Chuan smiled lowly.

“That is not what I meant,” Yang Kai frowned and shook his head. “In that case, I will bid farewell to Senior.”

“Good, don’t die out there, this old master is looking forward to your growth, heh heh heh!” Wu Meng Chuan smiled strangely and strode forward.

Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun looked at each other and followed close behind.

Soon, the trio left the Bone Prison.

“Leave,” Wu Meng Chuan stood there with his hands folded behind his back as he stared in a certain direction. From that direction, a strong light was rushing over, and judging from the aura, Yang Kai was certain it was Miao Qi he had just met a while ago.

Yang Kai cupped his fists to Wu Meng Chuan, “Senior, take care!”

Saying so, he pulled Liu Xian Yun and left.

After Yang Kai left, Wu Meng Chuan turned his head and looked in the direction he flew off as a strange light flashed across his eyes and muttered under his breath, “The seed has been planted, now it’s just a matter of time before it sprouts. En, something to look forward to.”

After watching for a moment, he turned his head back and stared in the direction Miao Qi was coming from with a cold face and called out callously, “Miao Qi, come suffer death!”

Surrounded by the brilliant light, Miao Qi heard this voice and was shocked, hurriedly coming to a stop as he cried out in horror, “Wu Meng Chuan? How could you possibly have escaped?”

“Heh heh heh, this old master was truly trapped, but an honourable person helped set me free! This old master said that I would kill you thieves a thousand times over one day, and today this old master will make good on that promise.”

After experiencing a moment of panic, Miao Qi gradually calmed down and looked at Wu Meng Chuan coldly, “Hmph, you just escaped, and you think you can compete with this King? Don’t forget, you and I are both Third-Order Dao Source Realm masters!”

“Without being confident of victory, how could this old master move!” Wu Meng Chuan’s voice fell before suddenly he opened his mouth and spat out a small bottle-shaped artifact. From that bottle, blood seemed to flood out, covering everything in crimson red, making it seem as though the world had been submerged in a seal of blood.

“Blood Spirit Bottle! You really possess it!” Miao Qi’s scream of horror came from within the blood sea.

Wu Meng Chuan growled, “Indeed, this thing has always been on this old master. If it had been fully restored in the past, this old master would never have suffered defeat at the hands of you four. Miao Qi, Miao Qi, you look down on this old master too much. This old master is the descendant of the mighty Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, how could he not have one or two Emperor Artifacts on hand? In this sea of ​​blood and spirits, this old master is supreme. As for you, how much of your strength can you exert? This old master will crush all of your bones one by one, then drain all of your vitality bit by bit, before finally feasting on your Soul so you will never enter the cycle of reincarnation!”

Wu Meng Chuan’s hate-filled voice seemed like a curse to Miao Qi’s ears, making his face turn completely pale.

“Don’t worry, after killing you, I will go hunt down Zhu Jun Shan, Bian Yu Qing and Tong Cong too, so you all can die together!”

From the sea of ​​blood, Miao Qi’s panicked roar rang out.

The Blood Spirit Bottle was an Emperor Artifact left behind by Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, and although Wu Meng Chuan, as a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, could not display its full might, with the help of this Emperor Artifact, Miao Qi was naturally not his opponent so suffering defeat and death were only a matter of time.
