The place where Qian Tong was trapped that day was not too far from where he was now, so Yang Kai simply followed the path in his memories to leave the garden-like paradise he was currently in, then walked down a short thousand-metre corridor before successfully reaching a grand hall.

This was the place where Qian Tong had been trapped, and the Stone Monument was still standing right where Yang Kai last saw it.

Yang Kai had thought that no one else would have made it this deep into the Emperor Garden, but when he arrived here, he realized he was mistaken.

Not only had someone else made it here, there were a number of people who had.

A short distance in front of Yang Kai stood a group of seven people all staring in a particular direction. Each of these seven people exuded a powerful aura. There were men and women, old and young, with one youth who stood out from the rest.

This young man had a face seemingly carved from the finest jade, luscious red lips, and pearl white teeth. His skin was so flawless that it would make any woman jealous. At this moment, this young man was showing off a noble demeanour while holding a folding fan. He was the epitome of a Young Master from a great force who had brought his servants out for a stroll, looking completely relaxed and carefree.

Compared with him, everyone else from this group was eclipsed, and Yang Kai’s eyes could not help landing on him involuntarily.

The moment he saw this young man, Yang Kai could not help shrinking his neck and wishing he had never come to this place!

This was understandable though as this Young Master-like character was none other than the one-person Yang Kai tried to avoid like a viper, Xue Yue.

[Why is she here?!] Yang Kai could not help silently screaming to himself. Although there had been many twists and turns on his journey here, in general, things had gone smoothly for Yang Kai, but now to his chagrin, he had met Xue Yue in this place!

[What rotten luck!] After entering the main palace of the Emperor Garden, Yang Kai had obviously managed to throw this woman off his trail, but now it seemed enemies truly met often along narrow roads.

If Yang Kai had known that Xue Yue would be here, he would never have come. Unfortunately, inside the Emperor Garden’s main palace, Yang Kai could not extend his Divine Sense more than a hundred metres or so, making it impossible to scout out the situation in front of him in advance.

What made Yang Kai curious, however, was why Xue Yue had come this deep into this place?

After seeing this woman, Yang Kai quickly pulled Bi Luo and wanted to take her away quickly.

But Bi Luo refused to move and instead stared towards a certain spot, a look of pleasant surprise and relief filling her face as she called out loudly, “Mistress!”

As soon as she spoke these words, Bi Luo’s tender body flickered and flew forward, leaving behind a pleasant floral fragrance in her wake.

Yang Kai was stunned when he heard this and quickly turned his eyes to discover a woman in a red dress who was staring back at him.

When their four eyes suddenly met, these two suddenly froze up.

This young woman seemed to be innately blessed with irresistible charm, her image capable of driving men to madness, her beautiful shimmering eyes capable of enchanting any man’s mind, sending them into a spiral of desire they were incapable of extricating themselves from.

Her tender body was slim and graceful while her twin peaks were rich and bountiful; her fiery red dress completely incapable of disguising her seductive figure and instead further outlining it.

Upon seeing Yang Kai, this enchanting woman seemed to be struck with disbelief and her body unconsciously began to tremble.

“Qing Luo?” Yang Kai murmured.

Although Yang Kai knew that Shan Qing Luo had also entered the Emperor Garden after meeting Bi Luo, he never expected that his meeting with her would be so dramatic. Under any other circumstance, Yang Kai would be elated, but right now...

Yang Kai turned his head to the other side and sure enough found Xue Yue staring at him, her pair of beautiful eyes flashing a kind of rage that stemmed from a complicated feeling of love and hate.

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched as he realized that wanting to retreat now was impossible. Forgetting about the fact that Shan Qing Luo was here so he could not just leave, even if he tried to, Xue Yue would certainly not let him go. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Although he had not spent long together with this woman, Yang Kai knew she had an incredible desire for control, to the point where what she couldn’t subdue, she would destroy.

Since Yang Kai desired neither of these outcomes, he had decisively left Rainfall Star, causing the two of them to become enemies.

The situation right now was very delicate. Yang Kai could not tell exactly what had happened between Shan Qing Luo and Xue Yue’s group before he arrived here, but it was obvious they were on opposite sides. Shan Qing Luo was currently standing in front of the Stone Monument containing the Artifact Refining technique though, so she was probably the first to arrive here and had been studying it.

“Haha...” Yang Kai laughed dryly, “Third Young Master, such a coincidence, running into you here.”

“En, we meet again,” Xue Yue smiled towards Yang Kai. Although she had the image of a man right now, her smile still contained an enchanting style which was not much worse than Shan Qing Luo’s, “So I take it the one who followed this Young Master into the Emperor Garden was you after all, yes?”

“If I said it wasn’t, would Third Young Master believe me?” Yang Kai shrugged.

“What do you think?” Xue Yue ground her teeth lightly.

“Third Young Master, do you know this person?” An old man with a distinctive looking beard asked Xue Yue while directing a suspicious look towards Yang Kai.

“En, I know him, he’s an old friend,” Xue Yue’s lips curled upwards slightly, her words sounding so pointed it was obvious to everyone she had a grudge with Yang Kai.

The old man nodded slightly as his eyes filled with ill intentions. Regardless of where this boy came from, a trivial First-Order Origin Realm cultivator daring to offend the Third Young Master was destined to die without burial.

The old man did not put Yang Kai in his eyes at all and was simply waiting for his Third Young Master to order him to remove his head.

“Ahem...” Yang Kai lightly coughed before directing a slightly embarrassed look towards Xue Yue and saying, “Can Third Young Master wait a moment? I actually have another acquaintance here that I haven’t seen in many years and would like to say a few words to first.”

“Another acquaintance? You mean this enchantress?” Xue Yue’s eyes flashed with a strange light before letting out a laugh, “I never knew you actually had friends among the Monster Race, but no matter, be my guest!”

Saying so, Xue Yue opened her folding fan and gently fanned herself, seemingly completely at ease.

Yang Kai gently nodded and without using any kind of movement skill walked over towards Shan Qing Luo.

The Beguiling Demon Queen had yet to recover from her initial shock, or perhaps this unexpected reunion had caused her to lose the ability to respond; whatever the case, she stood on the spot, staring towards Yang Kai, her red lips opening a few times, as if she wanted to say something but didn’t dare to, lest she awaken from this dream and he disappeared from in front of her eyes again.

Her mood fluctuated wildly as she only became more and more lost.

At the same time, Bi Luo had already buried herself in Shan Qing Luo’s arms and was continuously shedding tears as if she had been extremely wronged.

Perhaps infected by Bi Luo’s mood, Shan Qing Luo’s beautiful eyes also gradually became somewhat moist.

With only a few dozen metres having originally separated them, it didn’t take long for Yang Kai to arrive in front of Shan Qing Luo, and as he got closer, her breathing gradually became more rapid and the trembling of her body became more obvious, her face and even her neck dying a deep shade of pink.

The sentiment that Yang Kai had inadvertently planted into her soul all those years ago suddenly exploded, making it impossible for her to remain calm in front of him. If there was anyone in this world who could so captivate her, it was undoubtedly Yang Kai.

Even when she saw the Red Moon Tribal Lord that day, she had not felt this helpless; at that time, even if the Red Moon Tribal Lord had been her enemy, at worst she would have died, but now, Shan Qing Luo felt as if her soul was about to melt. The dull sound of Yang Kai’s steps felt as if it was pounding on her heart, causing it to beat out of control.

“All these years... have you been well, Qing Luo?” Yang Kai finally asked the question he had been wanting to for so long.

He had always harboured some regret towards Shan Qing Luo in his heart; after all, since he left the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land to travel to Tong Xuan Realm, he had never been able to see her again, unlike Su Yan and Little Senior Sister.

He thought he would never see Shan Qing Luo again in his life.

He thought his path would forever be separated from this enchanting woman.

But fate was truly unpredictable and it somehow allowed the two of them to reunite out here in the vast Star Field.

A thousand words came to mind, making Yang Kai not know where to start.

Hearing this familiar voice she had dreamed about for nearly thirty years once more, Shan Qing Luo could no longer restrain her emotions and tears began silently dripping down her cheeks as she haltingly spoke, “Tell me, is this a dream?”

“It’s not!” Yang Kai smiled, reached out, and gently wiped her tears away.

Shan Qing Luo closed her eyes and took a deep breath before opening them again, but Yang Kai was still standing in front of her, his big, rough hand still caressing her cheek.

This feeling was undoubtedly real, without the slightest trace of illusion.

“Little bastard!” Shan Qing Luo grit her teeth and scolded before, in a burst of fragrant wind, leapt forward and plunged into Yang Kai’s arms.

With such a beauty surrendering to him, even though he was still in a critical situation, Yang Kai could not help feeling somewhat smug, especially when it was a woman like Shan Qing Luo. Once she showed any sign of weakness, the temptation she exuded was enough to destroy any man’s sense of reason.

But in the next moment, Yang Kai’s expression changed dramatically as his face twisted in pain.

This couldn’t be helped though as Shan Qing Luo at that moment had suddenly gone crazy and viciously pinched his waist and twisted with all her might while she clenched her free hand into a fist and pounded on Yang Kao’s chest, seemingly wanting to vent all of the grievances and longing she had suffered all these years.

To the eyes of onlookers, this was undoubtedly Shan Qing Luo flirting with Yang Kai, but only he knew how heavy-handed this devilish woman was being. Although she had not really hurt him, the pain he felt was quite real.

[This little enchantress...]

Yang Kai could not help feeling both dumbfounded and helpless.

Things had not ended yet. After silently beating him for a while, Shan Qing Luo actually lifted herself onto her tiptoes as her eyes flashed with endless bitterness, like an abandoned wife who was only seeing her philandering husband after several years, opened her mouth, and bit down on Yang Kai’s neck.

Everyone was dumbfounded!

The six Origin Realm masters surrounding Xue Yue all shook their heads one by one, muttering words like ‘scandalous’ and ‘highly improper’.

In front of everyone’s eyes, such shamelessness and immorality, this woman was indeed an enchantress, simply without any sense of propriety! And this little brat who was entangled with her was clearly not a good thing either, that much was clear at a glance. These masters could not help wondering how Young Master Xue Yue knew such a person.

Their Third Young Master had always had a discerning eye and would not make friends with any stray cat or dog, so this type of person should not be placed in his eyes.

“Enough!” Suddenly a loud voice rang out as Xue Yue was unable to watch anymore. If she were to allow these two to continue openly flirting like this, it was clear their actions would only become more excessive; how could Xue Yue tolerate such a display?
