“Obtain a share of Ice Heart Valley’s disciples?” Yang Kai’s eyes went wide with astonishment.

Fang Ming Hui leered, “The women of Ice Heart Valley are all cold beauties, clear as ice and pure as jade. Not only that, but they are all quite gifted. Anyone who can get hold of one or two will have no regrets for the rest of his life!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Ice Heart Valley had quite a reputation within the Northern Territory. To the cultivators from less impressive backgrounds, its female disciples were like goddesses, ones they could only ogle from afar, but could not come close to, afraid to defile them.

Throughout history, many men of the Northern Territory had viewed it as an immense honour to be able to marry a disciple of Ice Heart Valley.

However, only a small number of them were able to actually accomplish this feat. Now though, countless men from the Northern Territory had been driven into a frenzy by the Seeking Passion Sect’s Recruitment Order. The rewards were trivial compared to the chance to obtain one or two female disciples from Ice Heart Valley after it was defeated. It would be quite impressive to make them into servant girls, but even going as far as to take them as proper wives would not cause any embarrassment, as it would only make others envious.

“You’re all here for Ice Heart Valley’s disciples?” Yang Kai looked curiously at Fang Ming Hui, not expecting him to have such desires at his advanced age.

Fang Ming Hui gave a wry smile, “I dare not have any extravagant expectations. I only seek to get a few of the Seeking Passion Sect’s rewards, which the Fang Family would be able to enjoy for many years. If we can also become a Seeking Passion Sect’s official subordinate, that would naturally be the best result.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “How many people has the Seeking Passion Sect recruited already?”

“There are at least a hundred thousand, most comparable to my Fang Family’s disciples in terms of strength, but there are also a few Masters from second and third class Sects.”

“And you’re not afraid that Ice Heart Valley will come to seek revenge if they manage to recover someday?”

Fang Ming Hui shook his head, “Ice Heart Valley has no such chance anymore.”

“What makes you say that?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

“This lowly one does not know the exact details but…” Fang Ming Hui explained, “I only know that there are currently two Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters in the Seeking Passion Sect, and even though Ice Heart Valley’s Ancestral Founder Bing Yun is also a Third-Order Emperor, she is but one person. How can she stand against the Seeking Passion Sect like this? Ice Heart Valley has also suffered heavy losses over the last few years of conflict. Else, they would not have retreated within the valley and relied on their Sect Defending Array to barely survive. Besides…”

“Besides what?” asked Yang Kai.

Fang Ming Hui smiled slightly, “Ice Heart Valley won’t hold on for much longer. In half a month, or a month at most, they are bound to be defeated.”

Yang Kai snorted, “You’re merely in the Second-Order Dao Source Realm, how can you be so certain?”

Fang Ming Hui glanced around cautiously, then said in a low voice, “Sect Master Feng Xuan has invited Grandmaster Nanmen here, and he’s currently investigating how to break the Sect Defending Array. It probably won’t be long before he is able to crack it. Once Ice Heart Valley’s Sect Defending Array is destroyed, we will hit them with all we have. They will be completely helpless.”

Standing behind Yang Kai, Ji Yao and Shi Tian He’s expressions had been growing more and more concerned and both of them were now quite pale.

After all Fang Ming Hui’s chatter, he finally asked, “Sir, why don’t you join in as well? Seeking Passion Sect is currently still recruiting, and I’m sure they will welcome someone of your strength.”

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, “I can also apply?”

Fang Ming Hui nodded, “Naturally. You only need to go register at Ice Moon City and explain your background, and then, you’ll be able to serve the Seeking Passion Sect. Benefits are, of course, distributed according to contributions… That reminds me, Sir, I have not yet asked where you come from. If you have any connection to Ice Heart Valley, then the Seeking Passion Sect won’t be interested.”

Before Yang Kai could answer, Ji Yao had already taken a step forward and coldly declared, “This Queen is Ji Yao of Ice Heart Valley!”

At those words, the faces of everyone in Fang Ming Hui’s group paled, and they all started backing away.

The members of the Fang Family had never expected that they had been chatting for so long with someone actually belonging to Ice Heart Valley.

Wasn’t it common knowledge that everyone from Ice Heart Valley was hiding inside their Sect, too afraid to come out? And with the Sect Defending Array active, how did these people get out?

“Run!” Fang Ming Hui was a decisive man, and he knew that his words were sure to have upset these strangers. With that yell, he turned to flee.

The four Fang Family cultivators behind him were also quick to respond, each of them pushing their Source Qi desperately.

But before they could even take a step, a bone-chilling domain suddenly spread out.

*Kacha…*

With a soft sound, the ground was frozen over and it seemed like the whole place was being sealed by ice. The five of them were all stuck in place, unable to move.

“Leave him alive!” Yang Kai hurriedly shouted.

Ji Yao frowned, but still held back some of her strength. She froze the other four Fang Family cultivators into ice statues, leaving only Fang Ming Hui standing there stiffly, his lips blue from the cold and his teeth chattering as he pleaded pitifully, “Please spare my life, Sir, the Fang Family has not done anything to harm Ice Heart Valley directly after joining the Seeking Passion Sect’s forces! All we did was patrol the perimeter, we’ve never harmed any Ice Heart Valley disciples!”

Yang Kai tapped his forehead and knocked him out, then reached over and lifted him up. With a wave of his arm, he turned the four frozen Fang Family disciples into dust.

“Honoured Master, what did you spare his life for!?” Ji Yao’s eyes were icy as she looked at the unconscious Fang Ming Hui, unable to comprehend.

“I need him to convey what he just said to someone else. Perhaps we’ll be able to get some more information from him as well,” Yang Kai explained calmly, then added, “We’re returning to the valley!”

“Yes!” Ji Yao and Shi Tian He answered.

Channelling his Space Principles, Yang Kai wrapped the two women in his power and with a flicker, vanished from the spot.

They reappeared outside Ice Heart Valley’s Sect Defending Array. The array was extremely large and sturdy, looking like a translucent dome of light which enveloped all the vital areas of the Sect.

From afar, it looked as though there was a gigantic crystal bowl inverted upon the ground, and everything inside the dome of light was indistinct, unable to be clearly perceived.

A Sect Defending Array of this calibre was not something that could be easily broken. Though the Seeking Passion Sect was quite powerful, they could not break through by force, and could only hire an Array Master to handle it.

But the Source Crystal upkeep for keeping such a massive array functioning at full strength was also astronomical. Under normal circumstances, a Sect Defending Array would only be activated at full power when the Sect was in danger of extinction.

After spending a long time observing from the snowy mountain, Yang Kai had a good idea of the patrol schedule for this area. Thus, he did not alert anyone when he brought Ji Yao and Shi Tian He over.

“Yao’er, open the array!” Yang Kai scanned the area with his Divine Sense, keeping a close watch over their surroundings as he instructed Ji Yao.

“Yes!” Ji Yao nodded, and hurriedly retrieved a token from her Space Ring. She channelled her Emperor Qi into it and lightly waved it at the curtain of light before her.

A mystical light burst out and a small gap instantly opened in the array. Before the gap closed again, Yang Kai’s group had already slipped inside.

Ordinary people could not open the Sect Defending Array, but Ji Yao was Bing Yun’s Third Disciple, so she had a way to get through.

“Who goes there!?”

They had just entered when a feminine voice was heard, immediately followed by a flash of light from a blade. A petite form was concealed within the streak of light, which was bright and piercing as a comet.

Emperor Intent instantly expanded and the temperature plummeted from the approaching icy aura, causing Shi Tian He to shiver slightly.

“Seventh Junior Sister, is that you?”

Ji Yao was not even thinking of defending against the deadly attack coming towards her, only calling out with a trembling voice as she looked at the person within the streak of light.

“Huh?” A surprised cry was heard and the light quickly dispersed, revealing a petite and delicate figure.

The person landed on the ground, sword in hand, and looked carefully at these intruders.

“Seventh Junior Sister!” Ji Yao’s slender form was trembling a little as she called out.

“T… Third Senior Sister!” The petite figure was also instantly overcome with emotion, almost unable to believe her eyes, rubbing them vigorously, and looked again before confirming that the person before her really was her Third Senior Sister, Ji Yao, who had been missing for many years.

Both Senior and Junior Sisters were very emotional as they looked at each other before they sprinted forward and embraced one another.

“Third Senior Sister, you’ve finally returned! Where have you been all these years?” The petite girl threw herself into Ji Yao’s arms, sobbing.

Ji Yao’s eyes were also red-rimmed, but she tried to contain her emotions and gently patted the other girl’s hair, “I’m sorry I made you all worry.”

At that moment, many other Ice Heart Valley disciples had heard the commotion and came running. In an instant, there were hundreds of people gathered all around, each of them holding a sharp blade and full of battle intent, thinking that enemies must have broken in. When they saw their Seventh Martial Aunt tightly embracing an unknown woman though, they were all bewildered.

Upon hearing what the two said though, the confusion of the crowd was cleared.

“She’s our Third Martial Aunt!”

“What? She is Third Martial Aunt Ji Yao, who’s been missing for so many years?”

“Yes, it’s her! I’ve seen her portrait before in the Sect’s main hall, there’s no mistake!”

“To think Martial Aunt Ji Yao actually came back…”

“With our Sect in danger, it is our good fortune that Third Martial Aunt is back. Ancestral Founder will surely be delighted!”

“Finally, some good news for the valley!”

The crowd of women chattered incessantly like a flock of pretty birds, noisily conveying the joyful news.

“Junior Sister?” Another voice suddenly called out.

Amongst the crowd, a tall woman with refined features was staring in shock at Shi Tian He, who was standing behind Yang Kai.

“Junior Sister Tian He?” she exclaimed in astonishment.

At that cry, Shi Tian He looked over and her body trembled slightly as she tried to restrain her emotions, calling out haltingly, “Senior Sister Yu!”

Her expression was a little wary and timid, not entirely daring to face her Senior Sister Yu, as though she was a child who had gotten into trouble.

Yang Kai naturally heard this conversation and looked over curiously, soon recalling what Yan Dong had said earlier and instantly understanding that this tall woman was the Yu Dan he had spoken of.

Yu Dan strode over and stood before Shi Tian He, looking her over before smiling, “It has been many years since we last met, Junior Sister. You’ve lost weight, have you been mistreated during your years away?”

Shi Tian He’s eyes reddened and she shook her head, biting her lip, tears overflowing from her eyes.

“Now, now, don’t cry. Honoured Master has also been concerned for you all these years. It’s all good now that you’re back now,” as Yu Dan spoke, she gently wiped away Shi Tian He’s tears.

But her tears just kept falling and falling like a broken chain of pearls.
