Chapter 1445, Hidden Secluded Home

Since the Emperor Garden had opened to the entire Star Field, Su Yan would naturally be able to access it as well. However, Yang Kai wasn’t clear what her current cultivation was or whether she had enough qualifications to obtain an Emperor Jade to come here!

Although there were various uncertain factors, and the chances of the two of them meeting here could be said to be very small, that did not stop Yang Kai from hoping.

Because of the Yin-Yang Joyous Unification Art, he and Su Yan had formed a kind of intangible bond and could feel each other’s existence within a certain range, so if she was really here, it shouldn’t be difficult for Yang Kai to find her.

With his head filling with such thoughts, Yang Kai unconsciously wiped the ring on his finger and took out a crystal clear bead that radiated an icy cold aura.

Su Yan’s Ice Soul Bead! As long as she was alive, this bead would remain intact!

This Ice Soul Bead was given to him by Qian Yue, and even though it had been condensed many years ago, the aura which lingered about it still made Yang Kai nostalgic. Feeling the coolness of this bead on the palm of his hand, Yang Kai’s eyes softened gradually and his thoughts quickly became calm.

After storing this bead back into his Space Ring, Yang Kai let out a loud roar, like an awakening dragon, the sound echoing throughout the sky. After venting the last of his rampaging emotions, Yang Kai increased his speed as he shot towards the Emperor Garden’s main palace like lightning.

One day later, Yang Kai was still flying above the grassland, the surrounding scenery not having changed much at all, showing just how expansive this strange place was.

As he flew along, Yang Kai didn’t encounter any kind of danger. Although many cultivators had entered the Emperor Garden, they were scattered about this massive space so it was by no means crowded.

Atop this grassland, there were many strange Monster Beasts; however, they were clearly not affable, most of them either releasing potent Monster Qi to demonstrate their outstanding strength or display their incredible speed, making them all but impossible to catch up to.

Yang Kai did not intend to waste his time on these Monster Beasts, all he wanted to do was find someone to confirm he was going in the right direction.

Flying forward, Yang Kai constantly released his Divine Sense into his surroundings.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s figure came to a stop and a smile formed on his face. Up ahead, slightly to the left, he could clearly feel the aura of living people, and quite a number of them at that.

Wanting to ask for some directions, Yang Kai quickly changed direction and flew towards this unknown group.

After just a cup of tea worth of time, Yang Kai reached a location where he could see these people and couldn’t help showing a stunned and interested expression as he stared towards a certain spot.

The reason for this was because he noticed traces of a Spirit Array.

Where he was staring, Yang Kai saw a light barrier that was flickering somewhat, as if it was showing flaws after being attacked. The scenery around this light curtain was slightly distorted, not matching with the surrounding terrain.

An Illusion Array!

Yang Kai raised his brow and looked more carefully.

The terrain here was rather special. Although it was still part of the grassland, there was also a ring-shaped hill at this location. To the naked eye, the mountain valley formed inside the ring-shaped mountain appeared perfectly normal, filled with many trees but with no signs of precious spirit grasses.

However, all of this was clearly just camouflage, because when the barrier fluctuated, the scenery inside the mountain valley also changed.

[Could I really be this lucky?]

Yang Kai was amazed. He had heard Min Sha say a day ago that there were many hidden secluded homes on this grassland, but he hadn’t expected to actually encounter one so quickly.

This mountain valley was clearly a hidden secluded home! There was no doubt about this, otherwise, there would be no need to arrange an Illusion Array around it to confuse others’ prying eyes. Despite this though, it was discovered and was now being attacked.

At this moment, two different groups of people were gathered here, four people on one side, three on the other. Both groups were led by a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master while the rest were First- or Second-Order.

The group closer to the mountain valley was the smaller one, and it was composed entirely of women.

When Yang Kai swept his eyes over these three women, he couldn’t help raising his brow slightly, revealing a thoughtful look. These three women were all wearing the same white robes and were clearly from the same Sect. Each of them was quite beautiful, with even the oldest of them radiating a unique charm. The other two had different styles of beauty, each with their own strong points.

But what Yang Kai took note of was not their appearances, but their temperaments.

Cold, aloof, even somewhat arrogant, seemingly rejecting contact with others with the frigid aura they released from their bodies!

This temperament made Yang Kai feel somewhat nostalgic, as it was very similar to how Su Yan was.

On the other side, the group of four cultivators also seemed to be from the same Sect and were all wearing red robes that seemed to burn like fire! There were three men and one woman in this group and they were all staring at the three women opposite them with clear malicious intent.

Although Yang Kai had only just arrived, it didn’t take more than a glance for him to understand what was going on.

The three women must have discovered this hidden secluded home first, but as they were attacking the barrier here, they were spotted by this group of people who had come over to lay claim to it.

However, because the gap in number and strength of these two groups wasn’t very large, a kind of stalemate had formed, with no one willing to make the first move! Generally, when cultivators encountered situations like this, there were only two possible solutions. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The first option was for them to fight it out, with the victor obtaining all the benefits.

The other was for the two sides to negotiate an agreement and explore this hidden secluded home together before distributing any benefits they found inside.

Other than these, there was no third possibility.

Yang Kai observed this situation and felt that the first option was far more likely, because from the way these two parties glared at each other with obvious hatred in their eyes, it seemed they both knew enough about the other and had some kind of deep-seeded grudge between them.

It was also a mystery to Yang Kai which star these two groups came from.

This situation was quite interesting! Yang Kai couldn’t be happier. If these two groups joined forces, he would not be able to fish for any advantages here. Facing seven opponents, two of which were Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters, Yang Kai wasn’t arrogant enough to believe he could emerge victoriously. Taking a huge risk for a secret secluded home that may or may not have any substantial benefits inside was obviously not a reasonable choice.

However, if there were enough clear benefits, Yang Kai didn’t mind inserting himself into this situation to pick some advantages.

Although these three women gave Yang Kai a more relatable impression, he had only just arrived here and shared no friendship with them, so he naturally was not about to righteously appear and support them, he simply planned on staying out of things while waiting for these two groups to fight it out with each other.

To Yang Kai’s disappointment though, neither side seemed to have any intention to act, but his arrival actually created a turning point in this delicate situation.

When Yang Kai arrived, the seven people naturally noticed him, but after realizing this newcomer was just a First-Order Origin Realm cultivator, all of them relaxed, the leader of the flaming red-robed group even revealing a disdainful look.

This leader was a burly bald-headed man and looked extremely sturdy. When he saw that Yang Kai didn’t immediately withdraw and instead floated nearby, this bald-headed man could not help snorting coldly and shouting, “Boy, there’s nothing here that concerns you. If you don’t want to die, then scram.”

Hearing this threat, Yang Kai simply curled his lips slightly, not displaying any fear, instead becoming even calmer.

The woman who was leading the other group, however, raised her brow slightly, a hint of joy actually flashing across the depths of her beautiful eyes.

There were only three people on her side, and although her personal strength wasn’t much worse than the bald-headed man leading the other party, her group was still at a disadvantage in numbers. Seeing the burly bald-headed man threaten Yang Kai so bluntly, her thoughts flashed quickly as she considered how to win Yang Kai over to her side.

As long as Yang Kai joined them, the gap between their two groups would be evened out, and she wouldn’t have any more scruples about acting.

Although a First-Order Origin Realm cultivator couldn’t be considered very strong, they were still an Origin Realm cultivator! In this kind of critical moment, this boy could definitely be of some use.

Realizing all this in a flash, the young woman no longer hesitated and directed a cold glare towards the burly bald-headed man, “Kong Wen Dong, you’re far too arrogant! With this Queen here, do you think you can still harm the innocent?”

After saying so, she turned to Yang Kai and gently nodded, saying in a warm tone, “Little brother, don’t be afraid, as long as I am alive, you need not fear him!”

“Haha...” Yang Kai laughed dryly, feeling somewhat speechless.

This young woman’s intention to win him over could not be more obvious, and with his vision, Yang Kai obviously understood what she was planning. She needed his help, otherwise, she would not have spoken up to shelter an irrelevant outsider.

However, judging from the dialogue between the two parties, these people really did know each other and shared a deep enmity.

“Cheap slut!” The burly bald-headed man smiled contemptuously, “Do you have such ability? Actually saying this Kong is too arrogant, I’d say you’re the one who is acting arrogant here!”

Saying so, he turned to glare at Yang Kai and said fiercely, “Boy, I’ll warn you one last time, if you don’t want to die, hurry up and scram! Don’t think that this cheap slut will really protect you, if you dare interfere in my Brilliant Flame Sect and her Ice Heart Valley’s dispute, all that awaits you is a cruel death!”

[Brilliant Flame Sect, Ice Heart Valley...] Yang Kai raised his brow. Although he had not heard of these two great forces, just from their names it was clear they were incompatible.

Naturally, he didn’t put Kong Wen Dong’s threat in his eyes though. With his current strength, if someone wanted to kill him, they’d need to be at least an Origin King; no Origin Realm cultivator had such ability.

The young woman smiled even wider as she brushed her hair back and said carelessly, “Kong Wen Dong, it seems you’ve only grown more cowardly with age, are you only able to bark threats to others now? Little brother, you don’t need to be afraid of him, although his Brilliant Flame Sect isn’t weak, my Ice Heart Valley is not easy to bully either. If you can help this Mistress here, this Mistress can give you some benefits, what do you say?”

Listening to her say this, Kong Wen Dong frowned while Yang Kai showed an interested look. Putting on a look that screamed ‘men die for wealth as birds die for food’, he grinned and asked, “What kind of benefits?”

The young woman smiled brilliantly as she lightly replied, “Some pills and Saint Crystals?”

Yang Kai couldn’t help laughing as he slowly shook his head.

While pills and Saint Crystals may have a lot of appeal to other First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators, they meant nothing to Yang Kai.
