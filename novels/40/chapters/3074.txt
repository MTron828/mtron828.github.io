With a livid expression, Yang Kai stared at Zhu Yan and uttered, “What if I refuse?”

There were only two choices for him now. First, he would agree to Zhu Yan’s suggestion and follow him, but for all intents and purposes that meant they would be under surveillance. Second, he would fight with Zhu Yan now and settle the issue by force.

Nevertheless, Yang Kai didn’t think he would end up being the winner. He wasn’t even an equal match for Fu Zhun, not to mention that Zhu Yan, who was a rank above the Second Elder.

He was the Dragon Clan’s Great Elder, so even if Yang Kai used everything at his disposal, he would still not stand a chance against him.

Zhu Yan shook his head slowly, “You will agree. I’m your Senior, so I’m not willing to bully you.”

Frustrated, Yang Kai felt a bitter taste in his mouth. Anyway, Li Jiao had been taken away by Fu Zhun, so he didn’t think he should leave him behind. As his friend, he was supposed to go over there and see what the outcome would be. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Boy, just go with them. Mo Huang will take care of you.”

The corners of Mo Huang’s eyes twitched when he heard what Fu Xuan said.

Since she had said so, Yang Kai decided to agree. Nodding gently, he replied, “Many thanks, Third Elder. We’ll go over to have a look together, then.”

In response, Fu Xuan flashed a smile at him. Zhu Yan turned to look at Mo Huang and uttered, “Shouldn’t you make them stop now?”

Without saying anything, Mo Huang pushed out a fist in silence, upon which a layer of ripples was formed in the air as it spread to the front. The next moment, sounds of things breaking could be heard as two figures appeared out of nowhere all of a sudden. They were none other than Li Wu Yi and Zhu Kong. Both of them appeared to be fine. It wasn’t certain how they fought with each other just now, but no one could tell who the winner was by just looking at their appearances.

After the Space Divine Ability was broken, Li Wu Yi and Zhu Kong immediately widened their gap as they looked doubtfully at Mo Huang and Zhu Yan respectively, wondering what was going on outside the void.

“We’ll talk about it on our way there.” Zhu Yan turned around and leapt into the air. After a frown, Zhu Kong followed him.

“Let’s go,” Mo Huang uttered.

Just like this, all of them headed for that particular Spirit Island. On their way there, Zhu Kong and Li Wu Yi were informed of what just happened. Zhu Kong’s expression darkened as he had never expected that just one hour after he entered the Void, a Dragon had lost his life. Furthermore, the famous Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was involved in this matter.

Li Wu Yi appeared equally shocked as he continued chatting with Jiu Feng.

World Energy was abundant on this particular Spirit Island, while traces of the battle had been left behind, but those traces were mainly formed during the battle between Li Jiao and Fu Chi.

The other Dragon Clan members were already investigating this place. With an agonized expression, Li Jiao appeared fearful as he was surrounded by a few Dragon Clan members.

“Have you found anything?” Zhu Yan flew towards Fu Zhun and landed beside her.

“Fu Chi did indeed lose his life here.”

“Where’s Wu Kuang?”

“There’s no trace of him.”

Zhu Yan nodded. After slaying a Dragon, there was no way Wu Kuang would stay in the same place.

“Find him!” Zhu Yan snorted, as he was incensed. Earlier, he wasn’t really angry when Yang Kai tried to snatch the bride. He also wasn’t furious when Mo Huang broke into the Dragon Grave and brought Fu Xuan out of it. However, what Wu Kuang had done had obviously crossed the line for the Dragon Clan.

He who slew a Dragon must be killed in the cruellest way possible!

Fu Zhun nodded and parted her lips, upon which, the abstruse Dragon Language could be heard. As she rapidly performed different hand seals, it was apparent that she was using a Secret Technique to find Wu Kuang’s whereabouts through the traces left behind.

Fu Chi had passed away not long ago, so Wu Kuang couldn’t have fled from Dragon Island even with his incredible capabilities. In other words, he must be somewhere on Dragon Island, just concealing himself.

While Fu Zhun was using her Secret Technique to find where Wu Kuang was, Mo Huang didn’t just stand idly by.

There were many grudges between the Dragon Clan and him, and he even hoped that all the Dragon Clan members would go to Hell. However, since the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was involved in this, he couldn’t stay put and do nothing.

If the Heaven Devourer managed to flee from this place, the entire Star Boundary would be plunged into chaos. Although Spirit Beast Island would still be safe outwardly, Mo Huang couldn’t avoid his responsibilities. No one knew better than the Great Emperors about how horrendous Wu Kuang could be. His presence was like a plague that slowly consumed this world.

Just then, a small snowy white beast snuck out from Mo Huang’s sleeve. It looked like a combination of a mink and a fox, so it was hard to tell what species it was. The beast was only about the size of a palm, and its fur was a brilliant white. It was darting its gaze about at the moment, and after landing on the ground, it started sniffing around.

Zhu Yan didn’t try to stop it when he saw it. Instead, he decided to have a chat with Mo Huang, “Brother Mo, why do you think Wu Kuang would sneak into Dragon Island and kill a Dragon Clan member despite knowing that his identity would be exposed?”

They were battling against each other not long ago, but now they looked like they had been good friends for many years. The sudden change in attitude didn’t look strange. Instead, it was all quite natural.

Dispassionately, Mo Huang replied, “I’m not Wu Kuang, so how would I know what tricks he has up his sleeves? Great Elder, don’t you think you’re asking the wrong person?”

In fact, he did not understand what was going on either. Wu Kuang was an infamous man who was a common enemy of everyone in Star Boundary. Since he had managed to stay alive and even take control of Duan Hong Chen’s body, supposedly, he should have gone into hiding. Given the special characteristics of his Heaven Devouring Battle Law, it would only take him a few hundred years to restore his power to its peak. If he waited a few hundred years, he would become the most powerful person in the Star Boundary again. Unless a new Great Emperor War was launched, no one in this world would have the ability to deter him.

Zhu Yan nodded slightly and stopped talking. As they spoke, Yang Kai and the others finally arrived at this place. Seeing him, all the Dragon Clan members glowered at him, especially those who had fought with him before.

With seven Dragons going against one man, they were supposed to win the battle with ease and make Yang Kai concede defeat. Instead, Yang Kai managed to break their Blessings and battered all of them into an embarrassing state. Now that they met Yang Kai again, naturally, they all looked very hostile.

Yang Kai returned the glare, thinking that they shouldn’t be so arrogant since they had all been defeated by him. After trading aggressive glances for a while though, the Dragon Clan members gradually looked away.

Appearing smug, Yang Kai swept a glance over the other Dragon Clan members, only to see that Fu Xuan was gazing at him with a smile. Feeling embarrassed, he coughed and uttered, “I can feel that Wu Kuang is eagerly trying to restore his power.”

He had heard the conversation between Mo Huang and Zhu Yan just now, so what he had just uttered didn’t sound awkward.

“Certainly, he would want to increase his power quickly.” Zhu Yan nodded in agreement. Previously, Wu Kuang was the most powerful Master in the Star Boundary, so he always appeared haughty and aloof. He even managed to suppress all other Great Emperors. Now that his cultivation had dropped to such a low realm though, it was obvious he would be eager to restore himself.

Yang Kai uttered, “When Wu Kuang left the Shattered Star Sea with Senior Duan at that time, his cultivation was only First-Order Emperor Realm. When I came across him some time ago, he was already in the Second-Order Emperor Realm. However, in just one month, he managed to reach the Third-Order. The speed at which his cultivation improves is simply inconceivable. This time, he chose to kill a member of the Dragon Clan even if his identity got exposed. Maybe there’s something on Dragon Island that can help increase his power rapidly. For example… Fu Chi’s Dragon Source.”

A Dragon Source contained a lot of power, so it was certainly attractive to Wu Kuang. Zhu Yan’s expression changed when he heard that as a horrifying idea sprang into his mind and he suddenly raised his head and yelled., “The Dragon Grave!”

Mo Huang’s expression darkened, “He was trying to lure the tigers from the mountain.”

Wu Kuang’s actions would make sense if his target was indeed the Dragon Grave. The Dragon Grave was where the Source Strengths of all the deceased Dragon Clan members slumbered. If Wu Kuang could devour all the Source Strength inside the Dragon Grave, his cultivation would increase significantly. He already possessed the foundations of a Great Emperor, and he had even taken control of Duan Hong Chen’s body, so there were practically no bottlenecks in his cultivation.

Given the Heaven Devouring Battle Law’s special characteristics, he would be able to increase his power to an unbelievable point as long as he had enough resources. Even if this gambit wouldn’t allow him to reach the level of a Great Emperor, he would still be far stronger than a Third-Order Emperor by the end of it.

A Dragon’s Source was extremely precious as the power it contained was unbelievably immense. If Wu Kuang’s target was the Dragon Grave, it would be a major issue for the Dragon Clan.

The reason he exposed himself and even killed Fu Chi was to lure Zhu Yan, Fu Zhun and Mo Huang away from the Dragon Grave. After all, these incredibly powerful Masters were right in front of the Dragon Grave. Wu Kuang wasn’t a fool, so he wouldn’t show up in front of them. Now, everything fell into place.

Just then, Fu Zhun stopped casting her Secret Technique and looked in the Dragon Grave’s direction. At the same time, the weird little beast that was released by Mo Huang growled in the same direction.

Seeing that, all of them stopped hesitating and rushed over to the Dragon Grave. In an instant, beams of lights shot up into the sky in an overbearing and stunning manner. The sight would have shocked anyone who happened to see it.

The Dragon Grave was very far from their current location, and although they were all flying at full speed, it would still take an hour at least to reach their destination.

Even though Yang Kai appeared calm, he was secretly worried about Duan Hong Chen. He was now an Azure Sun Temple Elder, and there was a close relationship between Duan Hong Chen and the Temple. Hence, he was also somewhat related to Duan Hong Chen.

Moreover, Duan Hong Chen had helped him before. Yang Kai especially admired the fact that Duan Hong Chen decided to sacrifice himself by crippling his own cultivation over and over again just to break into the Shattered Star Sea.

Taking all these factors into consideration, he hoped that nothing would happen to Duan Hong Chen. However, it seemed that Duan Hong Chen had been completely suppressed by Wu Kuang as he couldn’t even control his own body now, which put him in an unfortunate spot.

Wu Kuang had already managed to achieve this even though he hadn’t regained his full power. If he could grow stronger, Duan Hong Chen would be doomed. Just like Wu Kuang had declared before, even the Bustling World Great Emperor would be devoured.

The fall of a Great Emperor would be a huge loss for the entire Star Boundary.

A moment later, the Dragon Grave finally came into their sight. It was a dim place that appeared as though it had been separated from the outside world, which was a depressing sight for anyone who saw it.

Zhu Yan and the others narrowed their eyes and looked dazedly at a spot in front of the Dragon Grave.

“Wu Kuang!”

There was a sturdy figure standing over there. Although there was no wind at the moment, his long robes were flapping in the air on their own. With a faint smile, he gazed at the people who were approaching him, his expression completely serene.

He was none other than Wu Kuang.

All the Dragon Clan members widened their eyes and stared at him. Although Wu Kuang, who was the most powerful Master in the history of the Star Boundary, had disappeared for countless years, all would still be terrified at the mention of his name. Rumours of him were so infamous and far-fetched that even the Dragon Clan members wondered if he really had three heads and six arms.
