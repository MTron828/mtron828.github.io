The expressions of the two Elders were grim. Right after Fu Zhun appeared, she swept a glance over Yang Kai and Jiu Feng before asking coldly, “Who was it?”

“Second Elder, we’re fine.” Fu Qi stepped forward and cupped his fists before replying to her.

Fu Ling hurriedly reported, “We’re fine as well.”

Fu Zhun frowned upon hearing that. Zhu Yan swept a glance over the Dragons and noted, “Fourth Elder and Fu Chi are not here.”

There were only a small number of Dragon Clan members, so it was easy for Zhu Yan to count them and find out who was missing.

Zhu Kong wasn’t there because he had been dragged into the Void by Li Wu Yi. Given Zhu Kong’s strength though, he wouldn’t be put in a disadvantageous position when going up against Li Wu Yi.

Then, the only possibility now was that Fu Chi had passed away. Zhu Yan’s expression darkened when he thought of this.

Fu Chi was an Eighth-Order Thunder Dragon, so he was quite highly ranked among the Dragons on Dragon Island. If he were the one who had passed away, the Dragon Clan would have suffered a great loss. Fu Chi had already been wounded by Yang Kai earlier, so his power must have dropped, still, on Dragon Island, who could have the capability to kill an Eighth-Order Thunder Dragon besides those already here?

That was what puzzled Zhu Yan.

After giving it a thought, Yang Kai cupped his fists and uttered, “Great Elder, there’s something I need to tell you.”

Zhu Yan wasn’t fond of Yang Kai because he was the one who had caused all these troubles. Although he had nothing to do with Mo Huang’s appearance, he was the one who had turned Dragon Island upside down. The reason they didn’t discover the fact that Mo Huang had broken into Dragon Island was because Yang Kai had distracted them. That was why Mo Huang had managed to barge into the Dragon Grave and break the Dragon Clan’s rules.

As a temperate man though, the Great Elder kept his emotions in check and nodded slightly upon hearing that, “What is it?”

With a serious expression, Yang Kai replied, “Wu Kuang might have come to Dragon Island!”

“Wu Kuang?” Zhu Yan frowned, “Which Wu Kuang?”

Yang Kai uttered, “Is there another Wu Kuang in this world?”

Zhu Yan turned pale in an instant, “You mean… the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor?”

Upon hearing that, everyone gulped as they turned to look at Yang Kai in shock, as though they were trying to figure out if he had gone mad. Not many people were aware of the name Wu Kuang, but the title Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was known to all.

Even Zhu Qing gazed at Yang Kai in disbelief.

Fu Zhun snarled, “Stop spouting nonsense! It has been tens of thousands of years since Wu Kuang died, so how is it possible that he’d appear on Dragon Island? How dare you lie to us!”

She was already resentful of Yang Kai prior to his appearance here today, and with a Dragon Clan member dead, she was in an extremely bad mood, so it was no wonder that she spoke harshly to him.

With a calm expression, Yang Kai replied, “Wu Kuang isn’t dead.”

Zhu Yan and Fu Zhun were startled upon hearing that. While Zhu Yan shook his head repeatedly, Fu Zhun snorted as she obviously didn’t believe him.

Yang Kai was exasperated at their attitude. He was just trying to tell them what he knew without any ulterior motives. He didn’t expect the Dragon Clan to be grateful to him, but they shouldn’t appear so disdainful.

Displeased by the two Elders’ attitude, Yang Kai stopped trying to explain himself. The Dragon who died had nothing to do with him anyway. His most important task at hand was to leave Dragon Island with Zhu Qing and the others without being stopped by Zhu Yan and Fu Zhun.

“Heh, he’s not spouting nonsense.” After a clear voice was heard speaking, a burly man suddenly landed on the ground with a pale woman in his embrace.

Pleasantly surprised, Zhu Qing looked at that woman and called out, “Third Elder!”

The other Dragons also stared at Fu Xuan with conflicted gazes as they greeted her.

Fu Xuan turned to look at Zhu Qing and nodded at her with a lethargic smile. After that, she shifted her attention to Yang Kai and sized him up. Yang Kai happened to be gazing at her as well, and when their eyes met, he couldn’t help but be startled.

[Mo Xiao Qi? Why is she here?]

But the next moment, Yang Kai realized that he was mistaken. Although this woman looked similar to Mo Xiao Qi, she had a very different air about her. This woman appeared more mature than Mo Xiao Qi. If Mo Xiao Qi was like a bud, then this woman was like a blooming flower who was more charming than Mo Xiao Qi.

Most importantly, this woman did not have a butterfly mark on her face.

The butterfly mark on Mo Xiao Qi’s face was a seal, not a birthmark like Yang Kai thought it was initially. It was a life-saving technique that the Martial Beast Great Emperor had cast on her. Some time ago in the Shattered Star Sea, after breaking the seal, Mo Xiao Qi almost went berserk. In the end, it was Zhang Ruo Xi’s blood that managed to return her to her senses by sealing the Divine Spirit which was implanted in her again.

Therefore, this woman wasn’t Mo Xiao Qi. Perhaps she was Mo Xiao Qi’s relative or even her Elder Sister; however, Yang Kai was puzzled upon hearing how Zhu Qing and the others addressed her, so he wondered about the nature of her relationship with Mo Xiao Qi.

What puzzled Yang Kai the most though was the way this woman was looking at him. It was as though she was examining and evaluating him.

“Is she the Dragon Clan’s Third Elder?” Yang Kai was too embarrassed to continue meeting eyes with her, so he looked away and spoke to Zhu Qing using Divine Sense.

“Yes.”

“Then the one holding her…”

“He is the Martial Beast Great Emperor, Mo Huang!”

Upon hearing her reply, Yang Kai was flabbergasted. He reckoned that this man must be very powerful when the latter arrived at this place just now, but he didn’t expect this man to be the Martial Beast Great Emperor. He had never met the Martial Beast Great Emperor before, so he didn’t know what the latter looked like. He had only tried to imagine the Martial Beast Great Emperor’s appearance through Mo Xiao Qi’s face. However, this man in front of his eyes was vastly different from his imagination.

[So, he’s the Martial Beast Great Emperor, the one who can control all beasts in this world. As soon as he gives the order, no beast will dare to disobey him. He’s one of the Ten Great Emperors!]

With this thought in mind, Yang Kai suddenly realized something. With an awkward expression, he spoke to Zhu Qing in her mind, “Has Senior Martial Beast come to Dragon Island because of the Third Elder?”

Zhu Qing replied, “Yes. In fact, their situation… is quite similar to ours.”

Yang Kai wiped away the cold sweat on his forehead and uttered, “Did the Third Elder get thrown into the Dragon Grave just because of this?”

Zhu Qing nodded and replied, “The main issue was that Third Elder conceived a child with Senior Martial Beast. Without that child, Second Elder wouldn’t have exiled her to the Dragon Grave; after all, she was a Ninth-Order Dragon. The Second Elder thought that there was still hope of her turning back, so she kept persuading her to break relations with Senior Martial Beast; however, after the child was born, everything became different.”

Yang Kai uttered, dazed, “So, Xiao Qi’s mother is a member of the Dragon Clan.”

Without the need to ask anything more, Yang Kai knew who the child of the Third Elder and Mo Huang was. There was only one Little Princess on Spirit Beast Island, the Martial Beast Great Emperor’s only daughter, Mo Xiao Qi. It was no wonder that this woman looked so similar to Mo Xiao Qi. They were mother and daughter, after all.

“What did you just say?” Zhu Qing turned to look at him.

With a serious expression, Yang Kai said, “Don’t worry. Even if we have a child of our own, I won’t let them send you into the Dragon Grave.”

Zhu Qing blushed and stopped pursuing the matter.

It was extremely difficult for a Human and a Dragon to bear a child of their own. The Martial Beast Great Emperor and Fu Xuan had been deeply in love with one another for more than a thousand years, but they had only managed to conceive Mo Xiao Qi in recent years, which went to show how difficult it was.

During those one thousand years, the other Dragon Clan members had always been against their relationship. However, since Martial Beast Great Emperor was involved, they couldn’t move too openly. They only made the final decision after Mo Xiao Qi was born.

At that time, the Dragon Clan went all out and stormed into Spirit Beast Island. Although Mo Huang wanted to resist, in order to settle the situation peacefully, Fu Xuan decided to follow her fellow clansmen back to Dragon Island. Naturally, Mo Huang had chased after them, but he was eventually forced out of Dragon Island since he was only one man.

After that, he had been constantly planning and waiting for the right moment to act.

While Zhu Qing and Yang Kai were communicating with each other in secret, Zhu Yan and Fu Zhun turned to stare at Mo Huang in shock, thinking that they must have heard it wrong. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Mo Huang sneered, “The Dragon Clan is really a conservative and self-centred bunch who never bother to learn about the outside world. That’s why you think that everyone would lie to you.”

“What do you mean?” Fu Zhun stared coldly at him.

Zhu Yan knitted his eyebrows together, “You mean, Wu Kuang is really still alive!?”

Mo Huang replied, “En, he’s been reborn.”

“What?” Zhu Yan and Fu Zhun turned ashen at the same time, while the other Dragon Clan members were astonished.

“How reliable is this news?” Zhu Yan stared solemnly at Mo Huang. If what the latter said was true, the world would go through a huge change soon. The Dragon Clan had participated in the Great Emperor War in the past, with Zhu Yan even being present personally. Only those who had dealt with Wu Kuang before knew how terrifying the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor truly could be.

Mo Huang went on to explain, “I spoke to him personally just over a year ago. How accurate do you think this news is?”

“You spoke with him?” Zhu Yan frowned as he didn’t understand what Mo Huang meant. As far as he was concerned, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor wasn’t one to sit down and chat. Moreover, there were supposed to be deep grudges between the Martial Beast Great Emperor and him. How was it possible that they could communicate peacefully with each other instead of fighting the moment they met?

In an impatient manner, Mo Huang uttered, “Wu Kuang’s situation is a little special. He’d been hiding in the Source Sea of the Shattered Star Sea in an attempt to collect Blood Essence and build a new body so that he could be reborn. In fact, he almost succeeded; however, at the most critical moment, Duan Hong Chen broke into that place and fought against him. Both of them were severely wounded in the end. Wu Kuang did not obtain a new body as he planned, but he did manage to occupy half of Duan Hong Chen’s body instead.”

“Duan Hong Chen is involved in this?”

Mo Huang explained, “After they left the Shattered Star Sea, Old Duan began looking for ways to seal Wu Kuang’s Soul. He went to Serene Soul Palace, but even that old man did not have a solution. After he left, they came to look for me on Spirit Beast Island. That was how I found out what happened.”

Spirit Beast Island and Serene Soul Palace were both in the Eastern Territory, so it wouldn’t take much time to travel between them.

“Even that person from Serene Soul Palace had no solution?” Zhu Yan was surprised.

Besides the Master of Serene Soul Palace, no one else could be said to have studied and understood the Soul as deeply or thoroughly. If even he couldn’t solve the problem Duan Hong Chen was facing, who else in this world could?

“En, Wu Kuang is very much still alive.” Mo Huang looked disdainfully at the two Elders, “All of you should go out more often and learn about the outside world.”

In reality, only a tiny number of people in this world knew what happened with Wu Kuang and Duan Hong Chen. So, even if the Dragon Clan members really left their island, they might not be able to get wind of this news.
