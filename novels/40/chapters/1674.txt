“You!” Fang Feng Qi recognized the young man standing in front of him at a glance, he was the one standing on the high platform just now. Fang Feng Qi’s expression twisted in anger as he continued to rush forward, threw out a punch, and shouted, “Scram!”

He only wanted to escape as quickly as possible, so how could he bear getting entangled with Yang Kai here? As such, he did not hold back.

A peculiar force lingered on Fang Feng Qi’s fist, turning it from ordinary at first glance to one that seemed to be launched from a powerful artifact in an instant. Atop Fang Feng Qi’s arm, hundreds of dark red hair-like needles suddenly grew.

These needles looked extremely odd and gave off an aura that made even Yang Kai feel uncomfortable. Covered in these needles, Fang Feng Qi’s punch increased in power dramatically.

Yang Kai frowned as a trace of suspicion flashed across his face.

[What kind of Martial Skill was this?]

He had never encountered a Martial Skill that could transform one’s own body, but this was not the end. Looking up, Yang Kai was shocked when he took another glance at Fang Feng Qi.

He surprisingly discovered that Fang Feng Qi’s entire image had changed dramatically. Before, he looked like a cold, malicious youth, but now, using some kind of strange Secret Technique, his face had become extremely distorted, with sharp fangs growing from his mouth and a rich Death Qi swirling around his form.

Thinking of the name ‘Corpse Spirit Religion’ again, Yang Kai’s mind flashed and he quickly guessed the origins of this Fang Feng Qi.

With an attack incoming, Yang Kai did not dare to neglect, waving his hand to release a Golden Blood Thread that shot out and wound itself around Fang Feng Qi’s outstretched arm before rapidly tightening.

Clearly visible scars appeared on Fang Feng Qi’s arm, but even with the sharpness of Yang Kai’s Golden Blood Thread, Fang Feng Qi’s arm could not be severed. From the wound, however, green coloured blood oozed that was filled with a nauseous aura that could kill an ordinary person with its scent alone!

[Poison!] Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed.

This green blood was not only poisonous but also extremely corrosive. The Golden Blood Thread wrapped around Fang Feng Qi’s arm flashed wildly as a sizzling sound rang out from it.

Fang Feng Qi roared, opened his mouth, and spat out a mass of green mist towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai coldly snorted as his figure flickered, disappearing from the place he stood only to re-appear directly above Fang Feng Qi’s head, the Verdant Dragon Bone Sword in his hand swinging down violently.

“Fool!” Fang Feng Qi sneered. In his opinion, this bladeless sword couldn’t hurt a hair on him, so not only did he not try to dodge, he instead threw another punch towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai twisted slightly to the side, avoiding Fang Feng Qi’s blow, before bringing the Dragon Bone Sword down directly onto the crown of Fang Feng Qi’s head.

The seemingly dull long sword instantly burst with unimaginable power as a faint dragon roar sounded from it. Shattering Fang Feng Qi’s defences as easily as crushing dry weeds, the Dragon Bone Sword smashed his head into his chest.

Fang Feng Qi’s eyes widened instantly as a look of utter shock filled his face. Only now did he realize how terrifying the Dragon Bone Sword was and exclaimed, “An Origin King Grade artifact!”

After receiving such a blow, he surprisingly had not died and instead was struggling violently, trying to escape from Yang Kai’s control.

Space Force burst forth and innumerable tiny Void Cracks as thin as hairs formed around Fang Feng Qi before immediately wrapping around him and slicing him from all directions.

*Xiu xiu xiu...*

Metallic scrapings sounds rang out endlessly as Fang Feng Qi’s physical body was extremely strong, somewhat able to withstand the cutting of these Void Cracks to a certain extent. Nevertheless, this was still not enough to resist Yang Kai’s violent offensive.

A series of scars quickly formed on him as his lost bits of physique were banished to The Void.

Green blood constantly flowed out from his wounds, seemingly contaminating the entire surrounding world.

“Don’t kill him yet!” Qian Tong’s voice suddenly came. He obviously also saw some problems, and standing atop the high platform, he stretched out his hand towards Fang Feng Qi, who was still struggling in vain, and completely suppressed him before dragging him over.

Yang Kai frowned at Fang Feng Qi as a trace of unease surged up in his heart.

At this moment, those onlookers also discovered the strangeness of Fang Feng Qi, and many with less courage turned their eyes away, not daring to look at him. Even those who were more mentally intrepid could not help showing looks of fear and panic as they observed Fang Feng Qi, unable to believe that such a strange person really existed in this world.

“Old dog, quickly release this King, otherwise, you will die without burial when the Religion Master learns of this!” Fang Feng Qi did not beg for mercy but instead chose to threaten Qian Tong.

Qian Tong scanned Fang Feng Qi’s body coldly with his eyes before immediately fixing his gaze on the latter’s abdomen. A moment later reaching out and slashing it open.

Even when Yang Kai used the Dragon Bone Sword to smash in his head, Fang Feng Qi didn’t show the slightest fear, but when Qian Tong did this, a terrified look filled his face and he exclaimed, “Old Dog, what are you trying to do?”

Qian Tong ignored him as he was completely focused on the wound on Fang Feng Qi’s abdomen.

There, he found a green bead about the size of that fingernail, but despite its small size, this green bead seemed to contain an amazing amount of energy.

“If this old master isn’t mistaken, destroying this little thing will result in your death, yes?” Qian Tong gave Fang Feng Qi a light look.

Fang Feng Qi’s face changed slightly as he grit his teeth without answering. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Yang Kai, suppress him first, this old master has some questions to ask him,” Qian Tong said.

Yang Kai nodded, stretched out his hand, and removed the Dragon Bone Sword which was still lodged in Fang Feng Qi’s head before using a dozen Golden Blood Threads to firmly tie up his figure.

As the chaos ended, Qian Tong stood atop the high platform, looked around, and shouted, “Everyone, this old master has been in secluded retreat for many years and only exited today. I am deeply saddened to hear about the tragedy that has befallen Shadowed Star, but please rest assured, Heavenly Fate City is still under the jurisdiction of my Shadow Moon Hall and none shall dare invade it again now that I am here. Soon, this old master will visit this Corpse Spirit Religion to seek justice for the fallen as well as to open a brighter future for Shadowed Star!”

The crowd down below roared joyfully as they chanted Qian Tong’s name and swarmed around the platform.

Over the past two years, Heavenly Fate City had been under the control of Corpse Spirit Religion, and everyone had lived in constant fear, worried they would not see the sun tomorrow. However, everything was alright now, Qian Tong had returned and had reached the Origin King Realm. With him protecting Heavenly Fate City, Heavenly Fate City would never again have to experience these disasters.

“Elder Qian! I beg of you to uphold justice! My little girl disappeared a month ago, but someone claims to have seen her inside the City Lord’s Mansion. Please allow this old man to search the City Lord’s Mansion to see if she is still alive.”

“My child also disappeared three months ago, he must be in the City Lord’s Mansion!”

“My daughter as well!”

.....

Qian Tong’s eyes showed a pained light as he waved his hand to calm the cries of the crowd before solemnly saying, “Everyone, please wait a moment, this old master will have some people search the City Lord’s Mansion immediately. If your children are still alive, you will definitely be reunited.”

“Many thanks, Elder Qian!”

“I will never forget it Elder Qian’s great kindness!”

Qian Tong sighed slightly before turning to look at Wei Gu Chang.

“Disciple will investigate immediately,” Wei Gu Chang understood what he needed to do and hurriedly flew off towards the City Lord’s Mansion with Dong Xuan’er.

Yang Kai thought about it for a moment before saying, “I’ll go too.”

Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang followed close behind.

At the City Lord’s Mansion, some cultivators who had joined Corpse Spirit Religion came out to intercept these invaders, but they were no match for Yang Kai and the others. Rushing inside, Yang Kai’s group killed off several hundred people while capturing one of them to extract some information which led them to the underground dungeon.

The dungeon was dark and damp but held at least a few hundred people inside its cells.

All of these people were children under five years old, or young and beautiful women.

Whether it was a child or a woman, their vitalities were quite faint, as if they had been repeatedly tortured. On top of that, all of them had obvious wounds on their arms.

Remembering what Fang Feng Qi had done to the young child on stage earlier, how could Yang Kai’s group not know what happened to these people?

“Despicable!” Su Yan was furious and quickly broke open the cells together with Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er to release the prisoners inside.

Xia Ning Chang stood by the exit of the prison to check the physical condition of each of these people one by one and gave them appropriate pills to help stabilize their conditions.

Walking further inside, Yang Kai and the others wore heavy expressions.

Once they reached the deepest depths of the dungeon, and the looks on Yang Kai and others’ faces became truly unsightly.

At the bottom of the dungeon, there were no living humans, only piles of bones. Judging from the size and shape of these remains, they all undoubtedly belonged to children and women, but they had clearly suffered inhumane torture before they died as their physiques were literally shaved clean before their bones were discarded here.

There were at least a few thousand broken remains here, forming a tall mountain.

In just Heavenly Fate City, such a tragedy had occurred after only two years, so what kind of situation was the rest of Shadowed Star in?

“Hateful!” Wei Gu Chang grit his teeth and shouted; his face extremely grim.

.....

The upheaval in Heavenly Fate City lasted for two days before gradually subsiding.

The women and children released from the dungeon were all reunited with their families, but many more had perished in the dungeon. The chaos of the last two years brought indelible pain to countless people in Heavenly Fate City.

Inside the City Lord’s Mansion, Qian Tong and the others wore heavy expressions, each of them glaring angrily at the subdued Fang Feng Qi, their eyes nearly spitting flames.

“Great Elder, let me kill him!” Wei Gu Chang shouted in rage as he stood up.

Qian Tong waved his hand, signalling Wei Gu Chang to wait before turning his attention to Fang Feng Qi and asking, “If this old master is correct, you come from Grand Burial Valley, right?”

Hearing his question, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed with a hint of clarity, agreeing with this speculation!

After all, he had made such a conclusion as well.

Grand Burial Valley was an incredibly special place on Shadowed Star and was rumoured to have been the headquarters of a great force that existed two thousand years ago called the Ancient Yang Sect. Unfortunately, that force had offended Star Emperor Mountain and was wiped out overnight, its headquarters levelled in retaliation.

There were dangers inside Grand Burial Valley, including countless Spirit Arrays and an extremely vicious group of special creatures, corpses who should have perished long ago but had instead been reanimated.
