“What the hell!” The Monster King was extremely shocked. He had never seen such a bizarre Secret Technique and he promptly tried to pull back. The Embodiment, on the other hand, grimly smiled before stretching his hand out and smacking it down on him.

But there was still a wide gap between their strengths, so the Embodiment could only helplessly watch the Monster King break free from the Heaven Devouring Domain and flee.

Meanwhile, the attack of the burly Great King was already about to reach Yang Kai.

“Don’t worry about me!” But then, Yang Kai shouted. Hearing this, the Embodiment, who was about to pull back its hand and help Yang Kai, instead pressed forward.

*Xiu…*

Suddenly, a streak of light flew over as a small bell appeared in Yang Kai’s hand. The bell was covered in rust and cracks, but the flowers, birds, beasts, mountains, and rivers carved on it were still distinctly visible.

Yang Kai stretched his hand out and lightly pushed the bell forward. His Emperor Qi surged as the small bell suddenly grew, reaching the height of an adult and blocking his front.

*Hou…*

The giant radiant illusory phantom happened to pounce at Yang Kai right at this moment, biting down hard on the big bell.

*Dang…*

A deafening knell that reverberated throughout the sky rang as a wave of ripples suddenly propagated outward with Yang Kai as the centre. The ripples seemed to contain extremely mysterious energy and all the creatures who heard the tolling, no matter whether it was Monster Kings or the Stone Spirit, all momentarily stagnated as they felt a sense of suppression bearing down on them.

The radiant giant tiger phantom was directly dispersed, reducing into a million specks of light before disappearing.

*Pu…*

The burly Great King spurted a mouthful of blood as he suddenly became listless and dispirited.

The giant tiger phantom was the full power blow activated using his Monster Core, so after having it scattered by the Mountains and Rivers Bell, the burly Great King had suffered a certain degree of backlash.

“The Mountains and Rivers Bell!” The burly Great King held his chest with one hand as he staggered back, the corners of his eyes madly twitching and he stared in a daze, unable to believe his eyes.

“The Mountains and Rivers Bell!?”

“That’s impossible!”

“Wasn’t it taken away by a Human a few tens of thousands of years ago? How can it appear here again?”

The crowd of Monster Race Masters were shocked as well while the Great Kings kept exclaiming; their eyes filled with surprise.

This couldn’t be helped though as the prestige of the Mountains and Rivers Bell was simply too big. In the beginning, it belonged to the Ancient Wild Lands, so as residents of the Ancient Lands, no one knew the horrors of the Mountains and Rivers Bell better than them.

In a flash, a look of fear appeared in the eyes of the Monster Kings.

They might not place any importance on a mere First-Order Emperor Realm Human, but if that Human had the Mountains and Rivers Bell and could control it as he wished, that was another matter.

No one wanted or had the guts to test the terrifying might of the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

With the bell in Yang Kai’s hand, the faces of the Monster Kings and Great Kings turned colder, but they also became more cautious with their movements.

Yang Kai raised the Mountains and Rivers Bell up high and shouted, “Follow me!”

The Stone Spirits finally reacted. Taking advantage of the chaos the Monster Kings had been thrown into, they rushed towards Yang Kai, gathering by his side.

“I will kill anyone who tries to stop us!” Yang Kai, holding the Myriads Sword with one hand and raising the Mountains and Rivers Bell with the other, aggressively shouted, turning to look towards a certain direction before flying to that side.

The Monster Kings hovering in that direction gawked at Yang Kai and the Mountains and Rivers Bell, dumbfounded, but seeing Yang Kai leading the Stone Spirits towards them, they were completely startled.

Before they could make way, Yang Kai had already lifted the Myriads Sword before hitting it hard on the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

*Dang…*

The resonating knell from the bell almost formed a visible shock wave, sweeping towards the Monster Kings blocking the road ahead, suppressing space itself everywhere it passed through.

The faces of the Monster Kings drastically changed as they hurled all kinds of curses at Yang Kai, but how could they dare to hesitate? They immediately dispersed, narrowly avoiding the oncoming shockwave.

Just as they retreated, Yang Kai, leading the group of Stone Spirits, rushed through the gap between them with an unbearable insolence, encountering no resistance.

Every Monster King’s face was extremely ugly, while the Great Kings’ expressions were so cold and gloomy that one could shave off a layer of frost from them.

Almost the entire high-end strength of the Ancient Lands’ Monster Race was gathered here, yet a puny Human was able to come and go as he liked. Once word about this got out, none of them would be able to lift their heads.

But Yang Kai was radiating an intense murderous intent that no one wanted to be the first to test. Who knows what the consequences of attacking the Mountains and Rivers Bell would be? The condition of the burly Great King wasn’t hidden from them; he was dispirited and constantly coughing blood, and this was obviously not just the effects of backlash from his technique being broken. If they really fought head-on with this bell, perhaps not even a dreg of them would remain.

The disarray in the Monster Race Masters allowed Yang Kai to take the Stone Spirit Clan safely out of their encirclement and he was just about to escape into the wild.

But right then, Yang Kai, who was leading the charge, suddenly had his pupils shrink as he blankly stared in a certain direction.

The Stone Spirits, who were closely following him, instinctively felt a dreadful feeling slowly rising in their hearts.

*Weng…*

The world suddenly shook as tiny little black spots appeared on the horizon.

In the blink of an eye, those tiny little black spots were already within visible distance. Meanwhile, four fearsome pressures came bearing down from the sky. With these four approaching Yang Kai and his group, they all felt as if ten thousand mountains were weighing down on him. Letting out a muffled groan, Yang Kai was having difficulty even breathing smoothly.

“Divine Spirits!” Yang Kai looked on at the four figures that had appeared over the horizon with bulging eyes, his face as gloomy as could be.

He only needed a little time to put the Stone Spirit Clan back into the Small Sealed World, then he could use his teleportation ability to easily escape from here.

However, before the four Divine Spirits, even a little time was a luxury he couldn’t afford.

Yang Kai’s figure suddenly came to a halt, along with the Stone Spirit Clan, their eyes filling with despair.

They knew that since the four Divine Venerables had returned, they would not be able to escape today.

Elder forced a bitter smile, “Little Brother, my Stone Spirit Clan has brought you a lot of trouble!”

Had he and Mu Na not tricked Yang Kai into bringing them to the Blood Gate, how could he be facing a catastrophe like this today? It was indeed true that they had brought a lot of trouble to Yang Kai, causing Elder to feel bogged down with guilt.

“Elder, it’s too early to say anything before we have reached a conclusion,” Yang Kai pursed his lips and shook his head, sweeping a gaze over the four Divine Venerables.

His stay in the Ancient Lands might not have been too long, but it wasn’t a short one either. During this stay, Yang Kai had often heard about the four Divine Venerables, the true overlords of the entire Ancient Wild Lands!

[Fan Wu, Luan Feng, Cang Guo, and Shi Huo…]

Four names flashed in Yang Kai’s heart as he swept his gaze over these four faces.

“Hm?” Luan Feng suddenly narrowed her eyes as she asked, sizing Yang Kai with a little surprise, “Kid, where has this Queen… seen you?”

[Kid…]

Yang Kai’s brow twitched; however, thinking about it for a moment, he realized that someone as strong as her, who had lived for who knows how many years, was quite qualified to address him as such.

Yang Kai wryly smiled and replied, “About ten years ago, Junior had the honour to catch a glimpse of Madam’s elegance on Clear Jade Mountain outside Maplewood City. I’m afraid Madam would not recall such an insignificant encounter.”

Naturally, everything he said had really happened. When he was escaping from Blue Feather Sect with Liu Xian Yun, heading towards Maplewood City, an infant Luan Feng had appeared in Clear Jade Mountain. Many cultivators came searching and hunted it, but in the end, the Luan Feng who stood before him now appeared and annihilated everyone with her World Extinguishing Black Flames.

At that time, it was Yang Kai’s first encounter with a Divine Spirit that was really alive. Back then, what he had seen was Luan Feng’s true form, but now she was in human form. However, in this world, there was only one Divine Spirit Luan Feng. Naturally, Yang Kai knew that this beautiful woman was that massive black bird that he had seen back then.

Hearing this, Luan Feng’s beautiful eyes flashed with a gleam before she lightly nodded, seemingly having some impression of him.

“Lady Feng, do you know him?” Fan Wu indifferently asked.

Luan Feng replied, smiling, “We just met once, that’s all. I didn’t expect that he could grow to this extent in just ten years. I guess his talent is pretty good. He might become a powerful figure in time.

“Hmph!” Cang Guo sneered and glared at Yang Kai with ill-intentions, “Only those who manage to grow up can be considered true Masters.”

“The Mountains and Rivers Bell is actually his. It seems that his opportunities weren’t small,” Fan Wu’s face turned cold, staring at the Mountains and Rivers Bell in Yang Kai’s hands.

The four of them were lured away by someone using the Mountains and Rivers Bell and were still somewhat annoyed by this. At this moment, they knew that the Mountains and Rivers Bell belonged to Yang Kai, so of course their faces wouldn’t look good as it was like Yang Kai had managed to trick all of them.

“Little brat, how do you want to die?” Shi Hou suddenly took a step forward as a near tangible pressure came rushing from the front. Even with the Mountains and Rivers Bell protecting him, Yang Kai still felt extremely uncomfortable.

[I’m afraid things won’t end well today,] Yang Kai felt bitter and astringent.

The Stone Spirit Elder interjected in a reverberating voice, “Sir Shi Hou, this Little Friend was kidnapped by this Elder and forced to act as he did. Today’s matter has nothing to do with him. If you can let him go, my Stone Spirit Clan’s fate will be entirely up to your discretion.”

Shi Huo sneered, “It’s too late for that. Over the years, this King has tried multiple times to make you submit to me, but you didn’t even consider my generous offer. Now, when you are at the end of your rope, you actually want to bargain with this King? You think that this King will agree?”

Elder’s face turned bitter, not knowing what to say. Stone Spirits were basically not good with words.

Shi Hou coldly shouted, “Today, your Stone Spirit Clan will either submit to me or be exterminated. As for this brat… since he dares to trick this King, even the Heavens won’t be able to save him!”

“Trick… when did that happen?” Elder looked confused. Apparently, he was unaware that Yang Kai had used the Mountains and Rivers Bell to concoct the plan of luring the tiger from the mountain. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The Divine Venerables had ruled the Ancient Lands for so many years, but today, they had been humiliatingly tricked by a Human using the Mountains and Rivers Bell. When this matter was brought up, their faces turned extremely ugly. If this Human was strong enough, there would be some room for discussion, but he turned out to be just a First-Order Emperor.

Shi Hou had no intention of explaining either. With his identity and status, he naturally disdained to explain too much and just arrogantly stated, “Submit or be destroyed, Elder, it’s your choice. You have ten breaths to decide!”

Elder stated in a heavy voice, “This Elder just said that as long as Sir can let this Little Friend go, my Stone Spirit Clan is willing to surrender!”

“You don’t have any say in this. You are not qualified to bargain with this King!” Shi Huo waved his hand, impatience covering his face.

The Elder looked at the other three Divine Venerables and bitterly asked, “Sirs and Madam, do you also have such intentions?”
