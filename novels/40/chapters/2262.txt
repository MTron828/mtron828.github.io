Gao Shan and Liu Shui were the Left and Right Protectors of Flying Saint Palace. Their cultivation and abilities were just below those of Palace Master Ning Bo Yang. If the two of them teamed up, they could even fight a few rounds with an ordinary Emperor Realm Master.

But right now, the confidence of these two old men had been crushed.

First, Luo Yuan from Eight Paths Sect had beaten them senseless and sent them scurrying like stray dogs despite it being two on one. Then, it was Yang Kai, who completely ignored their combined attack.

[What is happening with young people nowadays? It’s ridiculous that each and every one of them is acting so rampantly and have the skills to back up their arrogance.] Secretly, they could not help feeling old all of a sudden.

Seeing Ning Yuan Shu thrown out by Yang Kai towards the sound wave slash, the faces of Gao Shan and Liu Shui changed drastically. If Ning Yuan Shu died under their attack, there was no way they could explain themselves to Ning Bo Yang.

Following a shout, Liu Shui stored away his flute then used a profound Movement Skill to appear directly in front of Ning Yuan Shu. Using his bare back, Li Shui blocked the sound wave slash while simultaneously grabbing hold of Ning Yuan Shu.

*Pu... *

The slash hit Liu Shui’s body, causing him to stagger forward. It was obvious that he was injured as fresh blood began leaking from the corner of his mouth.

“You! You court death!” Liu Shui was enraged after he had suffered such a big loss and glared sharply at Yang Kai.

“Hahaha...” Yang Kai said nothing and just laughed wickedly.

“Not good, we need to bring the Young Palace Master out of here!” Gao Shan quickly bellowed.

Liu Shui was also aware that they should not remain here any longer as Luo Yuan would soon catch up. In the distance, Luo Yuan could be seen with his arms stretched up towards the Heavens, as if he was trying to lift them above his head, the surrounding clouds swirling about him as an unimaginable pressure radiated from his body.

The faces of all the cultivators present turned pale at this sight.

On the other side, Gao Shan and Liu Shui’s bodies flickered as they swiftly fled into the distance. When they left, they did not forget to leave some ruthless words behind though, “Little brat, I advise you to come to the palace to offer a humble apology and accept punishment, because you would not be able to escape from us even if you ran to the ends of the Earth!”

“If you have any guts, don’t run!” Yang Kai shouted, cupping his hands around his mouth.

Of course, Gao Shan and Liu Shui ignored him and disappeared.

The next moment, Luo Yuan’s figure suddenly appeared in front of everyone.

Looking closely at Luo Yuan, his current state gave everyone a chill. A rich and substantive energy formed a vortex swirling around his body, one that seemed to be disrupting the local World Principles. Everywhere he passed, space collapsed and numerous Void Cracks flitted about. Of course, this damage was being repaired as quickly as it was caused as more World Principles flooded in towards the area. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Many cultivators who came here immediately moved back and did not dare to get within a thousand-metre range of Luo Yuan.

Yang Kai’s expression turned solemn too as he stared at Luo Yuan indifferently.

Luo Yuan’s aura was at its peak right now, but he was also covered in blood from head to toe. It could be seen that during the previous battle with the two old men, Gao Shan and Liu Shui, Luo Yuan did not really have the upper hand. However, although his appearance was quite miserable right now, the fire in his eyes was still burning brightly.

“Senior Brother Luo...” The round-faced woman stuttered, feeling pained about Luo Yuan’s condition.

Luo Yuan did not turn his eyes to her but instead glanced at Yang Kai.

From that gaze, Yang Kai could see a strong fighting intent.

He hurriedly said, “Brother Luo, you shouldn’t do things half-heartedly and should always finish what you started. Those two ran just now, so shouldn’t you chase after them to settle this once and for all?”

While speaking, he pointed towards a certain direction for Luo Yuan.

Luo Yuan looked at him for a long while, then nodded slightly, “It won’t be too late to wait until your cultivation has improved a little before we battle.”

After that, Luo Yuan flew off to pursue Gao Shan and Liu Shui.

After he left, a number of gasps sounded as everyone breathed a sigh of relief, like a big rock had been lifted from their chests, all of them looking around, feeling lucky for having survived this calamity.

Among the crowd, there was one man, however, who was quietly trying to sneak away.

But before he could take a second step, he suddenly felt a chill down his back and his face drastically changed as he looked behind himself.

“Hu...” In front of his eyes was a short and sloppy fat man, with a rosy nose and a flushed face, breathing out a warm breath.

Zhuang Pan was caught off guard and inhaled most of that hot breath. His face could not help turning red as he took a few steps back with his mouth covered with his hands. There was an irritating sound coming from his throat and it seemed that he was about to retch, but luckily, his cultivation was still good enough for him to suppress that nausea.

The short fat man looked at him with a grin, then lifted his huge green bottle gourd and took a swig of it, finally ending with a loud burp.

“Drunkard...” Zhuang Pan’s face turned ugly while looking at him.

When he saw a man come out from behind Drunkard’s back, his face turned even uglier and the corner of his mouth twitched, “Sir City Lord!”

Duan Yuan Shan snorted coldly, “I’m surprised that you still remember this Duan is the City Lord here. How thoughtful of you, Deacon Zhuang.”

At this moment, Duan Yuan Shan felt unspeakable joy as if he could finally vent out all the resentment in him.

Zhuang Pan forced a smile and replied, “Sir City Lord, you must be joking. This Zhuang worked under Sir City Lord for several dozen years, how could he have forgotten this?”

“Really?” Duan Yuan Shan looked at him from the corner of his eyes and sneered, “But I saw that Deacon Zhuang had forgotten about this for the past few days.”

“There is no such thing.” Zhuang Pan denied and explained, “the things that happened a few days ago... I have my reasons...”

Just as he was still speaking, Qin Zhao Yang suddenly appeared beside Zhuang Pan with a flicker of his body, forming a triangle with Duan Yuan Shan and Drunkard, surrounding Zhuang Pan.

Zhuang Pan was just a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, so when he saw these three glaring at him unkindly, not knowing what they were going to do with him, he was so terrified his legs trembled and he yelled, “What do you want to do? Don’t forget that this Zhuang is not the Vice City Lord of Maplewood City anymore, but a Deacon of Flying Saint Palace!”

As soon as he said this, the three men frowned and showed a look of hesitation.

Zhuang Pan was nothing to them, and if they teamed up, he would definitely die here. Even if they were to each act alone, they would not be at a disadvantage here.

However, the current status of Zhuang Pan was the source of their fear.

A Deacon in Flying Saint Palace was nothing impressive, but it was also not a low position either; after all, it was still a post that represented Flying Saint Palace’s face. As such, if the three of them really killed Zhuang Pan in front of this crowd, word would soon spread to Flying Saint Palace.

Qin Zhao Yang had to protect the Qin Family, while Duan Yuan Shan and Drunkard still had to look after Maplewood City. If they really offended Flying Saint Palace due to this matter, their good days would come to an end.

Seeing the change of their expression, the cowardliness of Zhuang Pa was swept away and he laughed loudly with a grin, “City Lord Duan, I’m quite nervous having you three stare at me so menacingly. Could you please not be so fierce with your faces?”

His words were full of teasing and mocking, and it embarrassed the three of them.

While talking, Zhuang Pan took two steps forward, patted Drunkard’s big belly and made fun of him, “Drunk old man, you should cut back on the wine a bit. You used to be a handsome Young Lord in Maplewood City, but what have you become after all these years? If those women who admired you before saw you now, they would be so heartbroken.”

Drunkard remained silent, simply continuing to lift up his bottle as he took another mouthful of wine.

Zhuang Pan then cast his sight on Qin Zhao Yang, “Old Ghost Qin, isn’t it difficult to support the Qin Family on your own? Have you ever wondered what would happen if you were gone one day, what kind of fate would befall your Qin Family? What would happen to Qin Yu?”

As soon as he said this, Qin Zhao Yang’s face changed abruptly. Qin Yu was always Qin Zhao Yang’s biggest weakness and also his reverse scale, so Zhuang Pan’s words had clearly lit up the fire in him.

Zhuang Pan chuckled, “Those who know how to act according to the circumstances are the wisest. Why not consider joining Flying Saint Palace now? This Deacon may be able to recommend you.”

“Hmph!” Qin Zhao Yang heavily snorted.

“Can’t appreciate kindness!” The smiling face of Zhuang Pan darkened when he saw Qin Zhao Yang giving him that face, turning to Duan Yuan Shan next, “City Lord Duan, the purpose of this Zhuang accompanying Young Palace Master here to Maplewood City this time was to invite City Lord Duan to join Flying Saint Palace in order to complete a certain important matter. I wonder what City Lord Duan’s things of this?”

Maplewood City was a small city that was not rich in products or resources, so before now, none of the great forces had the intention to control this place; however, recently, the city had become a prize worth fighting over with the discovery of a Source Crystal lode and a number of Earth Veins nearby.

Duan Yuan Shan happened to be the City Lord of Maplewood City, so if he was willing to join Flying Saint Palace, Maplewood City would become a protectorate of Flying Saint Palace, allowing it to rightfully claim the Source Crystal lode and Earth Veins. For those other forces that wanted to harvest these resources, they would then have to weigh their own strength and confidence before contesting them.

After listening to Zhuang Pan’s question, Duan Yuan Shan kept quiet with a cold face.

Zhuang Pan sneered, “City Lord Duan, this opportunity is right in front of you, don’t let it slip through your fingertips... This Zhuang knows that City Lord Duan has spent his whole life cultivating, but has reached his limit at the Second-Order Dao Source Realm. Do you not want to go further? If you can obtain some guidance from Sir Palace Master, perhaps you would still have a chance to break through to the Third-Order.”

Hearing this, Duan Yuan Shan shivered and his eyes gleamed, but soon, he regained his calm expression and snorted coldly, “It is impossible for this Duan to join Flying Saint Palace.

Zhuang Pan jumped up in anger and reprimanded, “Duan Yuan Shan, don’t force me to get tough with you!”

“Go away and don’t show your face in Maplewood City ever again, otherwise don’t blame this Duan for being impolite with you.”

This was the limit to his patience. Duan Yuan Shan could not hold back his murderous intent and let Zhuang Pan leave in peace for much longer. Given Zhuang Pan’s previous desertion in the middle of the battle, Duan Yuan Shan killing him ten times over here and now would not be enough. Furthermore, this time, after Zhuang Pan returned to Maplewood City with Ning Yuan Shu, he had been taking advantage of the influence of others to constantly pressure and ridicule him and Drunkard.

If Zhuang Pan had not taken refuge in Flying Saint Palace, forcing Duan Yuan Shan to fear reprisals from the latter, how could he easily let such a villain posture like this in front of him?
