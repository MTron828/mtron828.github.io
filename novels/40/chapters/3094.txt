“I’ll be able to reach the realm above the Origin King Realm by taking this pill?” Yan Qing’s throat felt dry, as he hadn’t come across such a thing for years.

He Yun Xiang replied, “To be precise, you’ll have a chance. The pill is just an auxiliary, your own foundation is still the critical element.”

What she didn’t tell him was that one indeed would stand a chance to reach a realm above the Origin King Realm by taking this pill, but the prerequisite was that one took enough of them over a long period of time. Just one Source Condensing Pill wouldn’t help much.

It took a very long time for an Origin King Realm Master to transform their Saint Qi into Source Qi.

“How would I know if what you’ve said is true?” Yan Qing frowned. He was an old fox who had gone through the vicissitudes of life. After the initial shock, he had pulled himself together and started having doubts. [If this Source Condensing Pill is so powerful, why doesn’t this woman take it herself? Why has she chosen to entice me with it? Isn’t she afraid that I’ll take it from her by force?]

“I need something from the Yan Family, so it doesn’t benefit me one bit to lie to you,” He Yun Xiang said solemnly.

Yan Qing shook his head, “I won’t simply believe you for what you’ve said. If that’s the case, I want to examine this pill first.”

In response, He Yun Xiang smiled at him, “Sure.”

A beam of white light flashed across everyone’s eyes as Yan Qing took the Source Condensing Pill in his hand, but he still couldn’t believe it. [What’s wrong with this woman? Since this pill is so precious, why did she pass it to me so easily?]

“Madam, aren’t you afraid that I might seize this pill?” he asked.

“Will you?” He Yun Xiang questioned in shock, as though she was an inexperienced girl while thinking to herself, [You’ll have to be powerful enough if you want to seize it!]

“No,” Yan Qing shook his head. Everyone in this world did everything for their own interests. When faced with such a huge benefit, they would do anything to grab it. However, he didn’t understand why this woman was so confident and wondered if she was suffering from some mental illness.

With a smile, He Yun Xiang replied, “Is this pill good enough to be traded for the way to enter the Ancestral Domain?”

Yan Qing let out a breath, “Yes, but the prerequisite is that this pill is truly as good as you’ve described it to be. Wait a moment. I’ll get someone to examine it.”

“Please.” He Yun Xiang waved her hand gently.

Since this was an important matter, Yan Qing wouldn’t dare to dawdle. He immediately turned around and disappeared into the inner hall.

He Yun Xiang turned to look at Yang Kai and spoke to him using her Divine Sense, “The fish has taken the bait.”

With a calm expression, Yang Kai nodded.

He Yun Xiang went on to ask, “Sir, given your power, you could just force the Yan Family members to hand over the method to reach the Ancestral Domain to you. Why do you have to do all of this?”

The Source Condensing Pill was just bait, and they were now in the Yan Family’s base. An outsider with an unknown background was basically inviting the Yan Family members to snatch such a pill from her by taking it out. Since they were bound to suppress the Yan Family with their power anyways, she reckoned that they should just make a move straight away, thereby saving them some trouble.

That was how the Fierce Gale Pirates would do it. They would just snatch whatever they had their eye on. As the Head Manager of that pirate group, He Yun Xiang was a firm believer in that approach.

Yang Kai replied, “I have my own considerations.”

In fact, he just felt embarrassed to take action, using his strength to bully and oppress the weak. Given his Emperor Realm cultivation, him using force here would be akin to a full-grown man snatching candy from a bunch of toddlers. Nevertheless, if they were naughty children, he wouldn’t mind disciplining them.

In a secret room on the top of the twin summit, the Yan Family’s Patriarch, Yan Luo, was studying the Source Condensing Pill as his expression changed repeatedly. Meanwhile, Yan Qing was standing to the side as he kept licking his dry lips.

Moments later, he asked, “Patriarch, is this pill really so magical?”

Yan Luo gave it a thought and shook his head, “I’m not sure. Let’s wait for the Grandmasters to come over.”

Even the Patriarch couldn’t be sure about it. Yan Qing was surprised rather than shocked, as he thought, [This Source Condensing Pill is indeed something precious.]

A moment later, some people streamed into the room. Regardless of their cultivations, they all exuded the aromatic smell of pills. Apparently, they were the people who had spent most of their time with herbs and Spirit Pills. They were Alchemists.

In particular, these people in the room were Yan Family’s top Alchemists who were all Origin King Rank.

After they entered the secret room and greeted Yan Luo and Yan Qing, an old man in a robe at the front said, “Patriarch, why did you summon all of us to this place suddenly?”

“Please take a look at this pill,” Yan Luo passed the pill to him.

After the robed old man took the pill, the others shifted their attention to it as well. In an instant, they no longer appeared nonchalant as they widened their eyes and exclaimed, “What!?”

“What kind of Spirit pill is this?”

“Let me take a look.”

“Don’t snatch it!”

All these prestigious Alchemy Grandmasters completely lost their noble bearings in an instant, as though they were all bumpkins who had never seen the city before. All of their eyes were brimming with shock.

Moments later, the agitated robed old man stared at Yan Luo and asked, “Patriarch, how did you get this Spirit pill?”

“Can you make out what grade this pill is?” Yan Luo asked him a question instead of replying to him.

“I can’t, but I can guarantee that no one among us can produce this kind of Spirit Pill.”

The other Alchemists nodded in agreement. This Spirit Pill was beyond their knowledge and comprehension. They couldn’t even ascertain the ingredients that were used, let alone produce them.

The answer was pretty obvious now. Even Third-Order Origin Kings and Origin King Rank Alchemists couldn’t verify this Source Condensing Pill that had appeared out of nowhere. The only possibility was that this pill was indeed above the Origin King Grade.

Just when the robed old man wanted to ask something, Yan Luo waved his hand, “All of you may leave now.”

Although the Alchemy Grandmasters were reluctant to go, they wouldn’t dare to disobey him. After bowing, they turned around and left. Before leaving the room, they still looked longingly at the pill.

After they were gone, Yan Luo uttered dispassionately, “You said the woman called He Yun Xiang simply gave this pill to you?”

“Yes.”

“It seems that she has more than one pill.” Yan Luo started laughing all of a sudden.

Seeing that, Yan Qing immediately understood what the Patriarch was up to. Certainly, that idea had crossed his mind as well. Both of them basically shared the same thought. Hesitantly, he questioned, “Since she’s able to casually take out such a pill, she surely isn’t someone who can be oppressed easily. What if there’s someone powerful behind her?”

“It’s not possible. Also, don’t forget where we are.” Yan Luo shot him an impassive glance.

Yan Qing was startled for a moment before he nodded, “Good.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Then, he turned around and left the secret room. [She’s a woman without any background. Even if she’s killed here, no one will realize it.]

“Sir, it’s about to start.” Inside the main hall, He Yun Xiang looked at Yang Kai with a smile as sounds of some things breaking through the air could be heard. Like a large Dragon that was awakening, streams of powerful auras surrounded the main hall.

A person with a grim expression stepped out of the inner hall. He was none other than Yan Qing, who had left this place earlier.

He Yun Xiang asked, “Elder Yan Qing, what’s the result of your examination?”

Suddenly, Yan Qing bellowed, “How dare you take a fake Spirit Pill to fool us! How are you so brazen?”

He Yun Xiang appeared flabbergasted, “Elder Yan Qing, what do you mean that it’s a fake Spirit Pill?”

Yan Qing snorted, “I don’t know where you’ve gotten this pill from, but our Origin King Rank Alchemists have examined the pill and concluded that it’s totally useless. How dare you take this to trade for our top secret? Do you think we’re fools you can easily deceive?”

He Yun Xiang appeared terrified and pale as she said, “How is it possible that it’s a fake pill? It’s really useful for helping a cultivator to reach a realm that’s above the Origin King Realm. I would never dare to lie to you.”

In her heart, she found his behaviour laughable. Now, she could understand why Yang Kai had to go through such trouble. Even the Yan Family had to come up with an excuse before they would deal with her. Perhaps a reason was needed to cover up their wrongdoing.

[It’s just not as fun as when I was in the Fierce Gale Pirates. We could just kill and rob anyone as we pleased. It seems that I still need some time to get used to living on this side of the world.]

“Are you saying that our Origin King Rank Alchemists are inferior to you when it comes to their knowledge and insight?” Yan Qing snorted.

After a sigh, He Yun Xiang replied, “Since that’s the case, please return the pill to me and just forget about my request, then.”

Yan Qing sneered, “You want the pill back? I’ve already destroyed it.”

In an instant, He Yun Xiang’s eyes turned bloodshot, “How can you do this to me? That was a precious Spirit Pill. Even if you’ve failed to see its value, you shouldn’t have discarded it so carelessly!”

She appeared aggrieved and helpless. Anyone who saw her in such a state would feel sympathetic towards her.

[Is this woman really this foolish or is she just putting on an act?] Yan Qing was somewhat puzzled. [Has she just come out from a long time of closed-door cultivation? Given her strength, why can’t she see what’s going on? That’s right! That must be the case! That’s why I haven’t heard of a Third-Order Origin King Realm Master like her before! She must have gotten some incredible inheritance and been cultivating in seclusion somewhere!]

Yan Qing was shocked at this thought, and he no longer felt apprehensive.

“Forget it. It’s just a Spirit Pill, so it doesn’t matter that you’ve destroyed it. Since you’re so stone-hearted, I’ll take my leave now.” Appearing dejected, He Yun Xiang rose from the chair and wiped the corners of her eyes.

“Do you think you can come and go as you please from this place?” Yan Qing growled.

Flustered, He Yun Xiang asked, “What do you want, then?”

“You’ve tried to fool us in an attempt to steal our top secret. If we let you off, our reputation will be ruined. Lady He, you must remain behind.”

He Yun Xiang staggered backward and exclaimed, “You want to confine me?”

Since they had fallen out with each other, Yan Qing stopped hiding his intention as he said, “Lady He, if I were you, I would surrender without trying to resist. You appear weak, so I think you’ve just reached the Third-Order Origin King Realm. If you oppose me, I’m worried I might accidentally harm you.”

He was confident of capturing He Yun Xiang. Compared to her, he had been in the Third-Order Origin King Realm for a long time, so she was certainly no match for him. The arrangements outside the hall were just to make sure that she couldn’t escape.

He Yun Xiang snarled, “You’re so shameless. Why is there such a person like you in the Yan Family? I want to see Patriarch Yan and obtain justice from him.”

Yan Qing sneered, “He won’t meet you.”

Just when He Yun Xiang parted her lips in an attempt to say something more, Yang Kai got up all of a sudden. Seeing that, she immediately kept her mouth shut.

Yan Qing shot him a cold glance and frowned. Then, he swung his hand at him in a nonchalant manner, as though he was chasing a mosquito away.
