“Dealings? What kind of dealings?” Yang Kai’s face dimmed slightly.

He did have some admiration for Medicine Pill Valley. On top of that, he had received the inheritance of Gong Sun Mu, the Third Disciple of the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor, which more or less connected him to Medicine Pill Valley. Even without such a connection though, the mere presence of a Great Emperor would be enough for Yang Kai to take seriously.

But naturally, before that…

If the people of Medicine Pill Valley were all as arrogant and unruly as this young man, then they weren’t worth Yang Kai’s concern.

“You will naturally know when the time comes,” the young man responded impatiently.

Yang Kai frowned, “If you are from Medicine Pill Valley, then what have you come to my High Heaven Palace for?”

High Heaven Palace had just been founded and had no relation to Medicine Pill Valley whatsoever; so, Yang Kai was naturally surprised at this sudden visit.

“You think I wanted to come here?” The young man laughed scornfully and cupped his fists, bowing sideways to the air and saying aloud, “On my Honoured Master’s orders, I have come here to purchase Spirit Herbs!”

“Purchase Spirit Herbs?”

Yang Kai and Hua Qing Si looked at each other, both confused.

“This little brat isn’t sick in the head, is he? Coming here to my High Heaven Palace to buy herbs?” Yang Kai secretly communicated.

Hua Qing Si also couldn’t be sure, “There doesn’t seem to be a problem with his request, though he personally is a little irritating.”

“Maybe he does have some sort of problem with his head. Tsk tsk, how pitiful.”

“If he really were sick, then his identity may also be fake.”

“En. That’s possible!”

“Hey, what are the two of you… secretly talking about?” When the young man saw Yang Kai and Hua Qing Si remain silent for a long time, he swept a glance over at them only to discover that there were some Divine Senses fluctuations between them, indicating a secret conversation. Their eyes when they looked over at him also became odd, causing his anger to rise.

“Oh, nothing important,” Yang Kai grinned, “Then, dare I ask this little brother what he comes to buy from my High Heaven Palace?”

The young man flicked his wrist and a jade slip flew straight over.

With a thought, Yang Kai opened a small hole in the Sect Defending Array to allow the jade slip to pass through, grabbing it with his hand.

He probed it with his Divine Sense and was instantly surprised.

This jade slip contained a list of many different types of spirit medicines and spirits grasses. Many of those listed were even Emperor Grade herbs worth a lot of money.

The young man said, “A copy of this list was given to Seeking Passion Sect ten years ago by Honoured Master, informing them to collect them on our behalf. Now, the time allotted by Honoured Master has elapsed so I was ordered to come here to complete the purchase. Do you understand now?”

Yang Kai muttered, “Is this true?”

This young man was not sick in the head and really did come here to buy herbs. However, the herbs he wanted to buy were ones that Seeking Passion Sect had been tasked to collect. The spirit medicines on the list were numerous and of great value, but with Seeking Passion Sect’s connections and power, gathering them within ten years of time was completely possible.

Only, it was a pity that Seeking Passion Sect was destroyed by Yang Kai. As such, it now fell to Yang Kai to fulfil this order.

The young man followed up, “It’s not just Seeking Passion Sect. All top Sects in the Northern Territory have an agreement with us, and the medicine list is updated every ten years. Once time is up, our people from Medicine Pill Valley will come to collect them.”

“All top Sects?” Yang Kai was surprised.

But with some thought, it did make sense. Medicine Pill Valley would save much time and energy by doing this, and as this would forge ties with Wondrous Pill Great Emperor, the top Sects of the Northern Territory would happily comply. By doing this, they helped improve their relationship with Medicine Pill Valley, which put them in a favourable position if they ever needed to request Alchemy services.

The young man nodded, “That’s right. Since you are the one who destroyed the Seeking Passion Sect, then the spirit medicines they spent the past ten years collecting should be with you as well. Give them to me so I can bring them back to my Honoured Master!”

He spoke quite seriously and didn’t seem to be lying, so Yang Kai more or less believed him.

But to be on the safe side, he still said, “Wait here!”

Right now, he was a Palace Master and the other was just a little boy still wet behind the ears who didn’t even have anything on him to prove his identity, so Yang Kai couldn’t just do whatever this brat asked. If he were deceived by him, then that would be too humiliating.

So, Yang Kai figured it would be better to verify things first.

After he said that, he disappeared.

“What are y… Bastard!” The young man was furious. He thought the other party would immediately respectfully invite him in to rest once they heard that he was a disciple of Medicine Pill Valley, serving him the best food and drink. How could he have anticipated being left out in the cold, not even allowed through the front gates. Even the Sect Defending Array was left active, guarding against him like he was some kind of thief.

He couldn’t help but shout, “Good, good! Is this the hospitality of High Heaven Palace? Are you looking down on my Medicine Pill Valley? I will surely report this matter to Honoured Master once I return! Once that happens, don’t even dream about asking for a single pill from my Medicine Pill Valley in the future!”

Hua Qing Si hurriedly tried to appease him, “Please restrain your anger, Young Master, our Palace Master has always been hasty like this, but he does not mean to neglect you.”

Coming from a Great Emperor Sect herself, she knew that standing before the King of Hell was easy, but dealing with little devils was far more difficult. One couldn’t just look at this boy as a First-Order Dao Source Realm junior, for if he really did speak badly about High Heaven Palace when he returned to Medicine Pill Valley, it would cause real trouble.

As the Head Manager of High Heaven Palace, Hua Qing Si naturally wanted to make big things small, and make small things nothing.

“Does not mean to neglect me?” He pointed to the direction where Yang Kai left and complained, “Look at his attitude! How can a person like him become a Palace Master? I don’t think High Heaven Palace has any need to remain in the Northern Territory any longer!”

He was small, but his words were not. He made it sound as if he could kick High Heaven Palace completely out of the Northern Territory with just a few words.

Hua Qing Si was helpless, but she couldn’t retort either lest she add fuel to the fire. She could only watch silently as the young man threw a tantrum.

After going on for a while longer, the young man looked over, sweeping a few glances up and down Hua Qing Si before suddenly smiling, “Big Sister, what is your name?”

Hua Qing Si squeezed out a smile and told him her name.

The young man rubbed his palms together, “Qing Si, a good name! A wonderful name! In my opinion, this High Heaven Palace won’t last long. Big Sister shouldn’t remain here and suffer through its fall. Why not come back to Medicine Pill Valley with me?”

Hua Qing Si laughed, “I don’t know anything about Alchemy, what would I go to Medicine Pill Valley for?”

The young man grinned meaningfully, “Big Sister does not need to know about Alchemy, it’s fine as long as I know Alchemy. As a woman, Big Sister should know how to make the bed and other such tasks, right? If you follow me, I can guarantee that nobody will be able to kick you out of Medicine Pill Valley. After all, I’m a Dao Source Grade Low-Rank Alchemist. In time, there won’t be a problem even for me to advance to become an Emperor Alchemist. Tsk tsk, Elder Sister really is pretty.”

Make the bed…

Hua Qing Si grit her teeth and the smile on her face suddenly cooled. Regardless of anything else, she was still an Emperor Realm Master, but now a little brat at the First-Order Dao Source Realm was actually telling her to follow him and make his bed? What’s more, he was ogling her so unscrupulously with a sordid expression on his face.

If he were anyone else, Hua Qing Si would have gone up and gouged out his eyeballs by now, but since there was a possibility this brat came from Medicine Pill Valley, Hua Qing Si could only swallow her anger no matter how irritated she was.

But the fact that this person was a Dao Source Grade Low-Rank Alchemist did surprise Hua Qing Si somewhat, causing her to sigh in her heart that it was as expected for someone who came from Medicine Pill Valley to be able to achieve so much at such a young age.

“Big Sister should consider my offer well. Opportunities like this don’t come often. This Young Master has a discerning eye, and it’s not like just any woman can attract my attention,” the young man seemed to not sense her distaste in the slightest and went on feeling smug about himself.

Hua Qing Si responded indifferently, “It is this Big Sister’s blessing to receive Little Brother’s kindness, but I’m afraid I cannot accept your good intentions.”

This young brat whose hair hadn’t even sprouted down there yet actually dared to have thoughts about her! Even if she really wanted to find a man, she would find someone like Yang Kai. How could she possibly be with a little bastard like him?

The young man couldn’t help but snort coldly, “Can’t appreciate kindness!”

He had already invited her so sincerely, but this woman actually did not accept right away, it was simply unbelievable.

“Where’s that Yang whatever guy? Why isn’t he back yet?” The young man began to rush her with impatience after being refused by Hua Qing Si.

Hua Qing Si turned away, “Who knows?”

…..

“Huh? Why are you here?” Next to the Space Array, Yang Kai had just appeared when he saw a familiar figure.

Zhu Qing glared at Yang Kai with fire in her eyes, her great peaks heaving up and down as she snarled at him, “You’re avoiding me!”

“That’s not true!” Yang Kai sheepishly denied, “Why would I do that?”

“You’re definitely avoiding me!”

It had been several months and Zhu Qing failed to find a trace of Yang Kai this whole time. If she hadn’t been keeping watch next to the Space Array, she really would have thought that Yang Kai had fled somewhere. Now, her efforts paid off. She finally caught Yang Kai!

“I said I’m not! Why are you spouting so much nonsense?” Yang Kai waved her off impatiently, “Move aside, I need to go out.”

Without saying a word, Zhu Qing stood in front of him and said vigilantly, “Where are you going? I’ll come with you!”

“I’m going to Ice Heart Valley, and I’ll be returning right away,” Yang Kai glared at her, “Why do you want to follow me?”

“Didn’t you just go to Ice Heart Valley? Why are you going again?”

“Someone came, saying he wanted to buy herbs, I’m just going to Ice Heart Valley to ask whether this story is true or not… Damn it, what am I telling you this for?”

While they were talking though, a light suddenly emerged from the Space Array, followed by a blurred figure.

Someone had teleported in.

Yang Kai and Zhu Qing turned to look.

The figure was soon revealed and Ji Yao’s face emerged.

“Yao’er! Just the person I’m looking for. I was just about to head to Ice Heart Valley to ask about something.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Hold on, there’s something I have to tell you first,” Ji Yao walked down from the Space Array and said to Yang Kai.

“What is it?” Yang Kai was surprised.

“Medicine Pill Valley’s medicine collecting deadline is up. Disciples from Medicine Pill Valley are likely to come in the near future. Honoured Master has given me orders to inform you. If someone were to come, they must be treated with courtesy. You must never offend them. Give them whatever spirit medicines they ask for. You won’t suffer a loss with them.”

“Oh… So it really is true!” Yang Kai scratched his face.

Yang Kai had heard the boy say that Medicine Pill Valley had a cooperative relationship with the top Sects of the Northern Territory, so he immediately had the mind to head to Ice Heart Valley to ask. If it was true, then Ice Heart Valley would definitely know about it. That way, he would be able to confirm that boy’s identity.

But unexpectedly, Ji Yao teleported over before he could even go.

“Naturally it’s true. Right now, one of their disciples has visited Ice Heart Valley. What… What is that look on your face?”

“Oh, it’s nothing. Someone came to my side too,” Yang Kai laughed dryly.

“Where are they?” Ji Yao asked curiously.

“Still outside the main gate.”

Ji Yao glared at him, “What are you waiting for? Invite them in!”

“Right, I’ll go immediately…” Yang Kai turned around and headed back where he came from.

“Wait!” Anxious, Zhu Qing quickly chased after him.

Ji Yao frowned and also turned into a stream of light, quickly following them.
