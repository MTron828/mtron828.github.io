It was only for an instant, but Yang Kai felt as though he lost a layer of skin off his back. It went to show just how violent that gust of wind had been. The raging flow of air swept him off balance and blew him away into the distance. Unable to control his body, he was swept along by the wind with a horrified expression on his face.

He was a High-Rank Demon King; moreover, he had gained an opportunity in that ancient battlefield and spent dozens of years cultivating there. At this point, even a Pseudo-Great Emperor or a Half-Saint would not make him flinch. Nevertheless, he was helplessly being blown about by a gust of wind in this strange Starry Sky.

In the midst of the strong wind, the odd sound continued thundering in his ears. It was so deafening that Stars were dancing in his eyes from the noise. Forcing himself to stabilize his mind, he shouted, ‚ÄúDragon Transformation!‚Äù

In response, a Dragon Roar rang out and his body swelled rapidly, assuming his Half-Dragon Form.

Yang Kai had spent several dozen years cultivating intensively in that ancient battlefield. During that period, he had absorbed the Martial Truth of Flowing Time Great Emperor and the Great Demon God. That wasn‚Äôt all; the two extraordinary forces had also been polishing and purifying his body at all times. Combined with the fact that he had always maintained his Half-Dragon Form in the ancient battlefield, his Half-Dragon Form had been greatly tempered and enhanced without him realising. Similarly, the Golden Divine Dragon‚Äôs Source Strength in his body had also been developed significantly. As a result, his Half-Dragon Form was now 1,000 metres tall! At this length, it was enough to make all the Dragon Clan members in Dragon Island look up to him in admiration.

A clanging noise sounded in his ears as the wind blades hitting against his Dragon Scales created a sound similar to that of metal clashing against metal, sending a shower of sparks everywhere.

Despite assuming his Half-Dragon form, Yang Kai was still unable to stabilize his body completely. Although it was slightly better than before, the effects were still very limited.

[What the Hell is this wind!?] Gritting his teeth, Yang Kai somehow turned back to look. He wanted to see where the gust of wind was coming from; however, what he saw made his eyes widen in surprise and his brow twitch madly. He could barely believe what he was seeing, but even after rubbing his eyes and blinking furiously, he found that he had not seen wrongly.

There was a giant lying on his side behind Yang Kai. Yang Kai could not tell how tall the giant was, but it was as if he was looking at a rolling mountain range. In comparison, Yang Kai‚Äôs 1,000 metres Half-Dragon Form looked like an ant.

While the giant looked no different from an ordinary Human, his appearance was magnified countless times. In addition, the deafening sound he was hearing was not the sound of thunder, it was the giant snoring. Furthermore, the gust of wind that seemed to slice through Yang Kai‚Äôs flesh and bones was simply the breath exhaled through the giant‚Äôs mouth and nose. ùí©ewW ùíèovels updùíÇtes on nov/ùíÜl/b(i)ùíè(.)com

Yang Kai only had one thought come to mind when he saw this sight, [So enormous!]

[What the Hell is this thing!?] Yang Kai‚Äôs thoughts immediately descended into chaos as he nearly believed that he was dreaming.

Meanwhile, the powerful Astral Wind blew him a distance of several thousands of kilometres before gradually dying down. The deafening snoring stopped ringing in his ears at the same time.

Yang Kai‚Äôs complexion at this moment was terrible. He felt as though he had just finished fighting a desperate battle. His entire body was exhausted and sore, especially the area on his back that had been cut by the wind blades. He even felt that his Dragon Scales seemed to have become much weaker after the encounter.

[This big guy is just sleeping but his snoring contains so much power! What would it be like if he were to attack!? Even the entire Star Boundary won‚Äôt be able to take more than two or three punches from him!] The giant in front of Yang Kai‚Äôs eyes had vastly exceeded the limits of his understanding and even imagination, so he had a hard time calming down.

Without warning though, a great sense of crisis enveloped him. Yang Kai only pondered for a moment before his expression changed greatly as he shouted, ‚ÄúBad!‚Äù

Space Principles surged as he tried to leave this place immediately.

It was only natural for a sleeping person to inhale after exhaling, so if this giant‚Äôs exhalation had such destructive power, then what would his inhalation be like? Regardless of what it would be like, Yang Kai had no interest in sticking around to find out. Unfortunately, he was too close to the giant and it was too late for him to leave by the time he noticed this danger.

As expected, the sleeping giant breathed in. It felt as if a whale was sucking in water the moment he inhaled. Everything within a radius of ten thousand kilometres was pulled towards him by that sucking force. Even space itself seemed to be warping in response.

In the meantime, Yang Kai‚Äôs flickering figure solidified again, his Instantaneous Movement disrupted, terrifying him to the core. His body was involuntarily being pulled towards the giant. Even having been blown several thousand kilometres away when the giant exhaled just now, the giant‚Äôs inhalation instantly dragged Yang Kai back. He could only watch helplessly as he got closer and closer to the giant‚Äôs mouth. It was only a matter of moments before he was swallowed up by the giant. Yang Kai really didn‚Äôt know whether to laugh or cry at this situation.

[I finally managed to escape from the Void Crack and I haven‚Äôt even found out where the Star Boundary is located. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm about to get swallowed by a random giant that I happened to bump into! Dying in this manner is too miserable!] Although Yang Kai had no idea what would happen to him if he entered the giant‚Äôs stomach, he was certain that it would not end well for him.

At the critical moment when his life was hanging by a thin thread, Yang Kai opened his mouth and let out a furious roar. A Dragon Roar boomed out, shaking the entire world. At the same time, his Half-Dragon Form twisted and instead of rushing into the giant‚Äôs mouth, shot up towards the giant‚Äôs enormous nostrils. Yang Kai reached out his claws and grabbed a nose hair that was thicker than a mountain peak. Going along with the momentum, he swung himself towards the wall of the giant‚Äôs nose and punched out hard.

*Puchi‚Ä¶*

‚ÄúA‚Ä¶ A‚Ä¶ Achoo!‚Äù

A burst of air even more violent than previously exploded out. Yang Kai was swept away in confusion, his mind spinning dizzily. By the time he regained his footing, he was already out of the danger zone. Hence, he couldn‚Äôt help letting out a breath of relief as he thought to himself, [Thank goodness I have luck on my side. I can‚Äôt believe I managed to escape unscathed under those circumstances!]

Before he could rejoice though, he suddenly felt a stabbing feeling in his heart. He felt as if a thorn was piercing his back and instinctively turned around to look. The hair all over his body instantly stood on end as even his Dragon Scales covering him quivered in fright.

Yang Kai‚Äôs actions just now had probably disturbed the sleeping giant, and at some point in time, the giant had woken up and sat up cross-legged in the void. Although he had seemed very large even when lying down, he looked even more imposing now that he was sitting up; what‚Äôs more, he seemed quite unhappy. His mountain-like brows were furrowed deeply and he had a ferocious expression on his face, like a child who was rudely woken up from his sleep. In short, he looked extremely disgruntled.

[It‚Äôs a given that he is upset. If I was punched in the nose like that while I was asleep, I would react in the same manner too.]

Originally, Yang Kai had not paid much attention to the sleeping giant‚Äôs appearance, other than his enormous size, but now that the latter was sitting up, he noticed that the giant‚Äôs head was completely bald and shiny like the sun. However, Yang Kai was in no mood to pay attention to such trivial matters. As soon as he saw that the giant was awake, he refused to remain in this place and immediately sped off into the distance in a flash.

An existence like this was beyond his ability to face. Yang Kai had been extremely lucky to escape with his life just now and knew that if he did not escape, he would only be a sitting duck waiting for death to come. Besides, he still had no idea what that giant was. The only thing he could be sure of was that he could not afford to anger such a terrifying existence.

[Could that giant be some kind of sentient creature that lives in the Outer Universe? In that case, did I arrive in the Outer Universe after leaving the Void Crack?] Yang Kai couldn‚Äôt help feeling a bit speechless. [I was thinking about going to the Outer Universe one day when I killed Mo Sheng previously. I can‚Äôt believe my wish came true so quickly, but I haven‚Äôt even had the chance to look at the scenery yet before running into this extremely terrifying giant.]

After consecutively performing several Instantaneous Movements, Yang Kai lost track of how far he travelled. It wasn‚Äôt until he felt safe that he stopped and turned back to look, but at that instant, he was so frightened that he felt as though his Soul was about to escape from his body.

An incomparably enormous face was bearing down at him, a pair of eyes filled with anger and dissatisfaction glaring directly at him, air coming from those nostrils that seemed hot enough to melt the universe.

At this moment, the giant was holding one hand up with his palm facing upwards. Meanwhile, Yang Kai was standing in the middle of that gigantic palm. The giant‚Äôs five fingers stretched out in the surroundings were like five towering mountains that covered the entire world.

Shocked, Yang Kai tried to push his Space Principles once more. Even though his figure flashed, he couldn‚Äôt leave and remained stuck in place, causing his expression to change greatly as he shouted, ‚ÄúA universe in the palm of his hand!‚Äù

The giant‚Äôs palm was like a world in and of itself, even having its own Principles! He couldn‚Äôt even escape from the palm of this giant‚Äôs hand. It was beyond na?ve and foolish of him to believe he was safe just now!

A Divine Ability of this level was beyond the scope of Yang Kai‚Äôs comprehension. He did not know how many thousands of times stronger this giant‚Äôs cultivation was compared to his. In any case, he had the feeling that it was going to be impossible for him to escape from the giant‚Äôs grasp, so in his desperation, his fear turned into fury and he glared at the giant. He did not show any signs of weakness as he shouted, ‚ÄúYou bastard! What are you capturing me for!?‚Äù

He activated his Dragon Pressure with a furious roar and his shout came out as a Dragon Roar. After letting out that roar, Yang Kai instantly felt a little regretful because the giant looked very angry. If he had spoken nicely, he might have had some chance of surviving this crisis. [Why did I suddenly yell at him!? What if I made him mad!? I won‚Äôt even be able to fill the gaps between his teeth if he decides to eat me!]

Just when Yang Kai was drowning in anxiety, he saw the giant‚Äôs large eyeballs growing even larger. Two gigantic eyebrows raised slightly to reveal an expression of fright, almost as though the giant had seen something terrifying.

Yang Kai was stunned. The main reason was that the giant‚Äôs facial expression changed so quickly that it was difficult for him to accept; moreover, such a ferocious-looking giant actually looked frightened now. It was simply too incredulous to believe.

Taking advantage of this situation, Yang Kai decided to just go with the flow and shouted once more, ‚ÄúI asked you a question! Are you deaf!?‚Äù [I wonder if this guy understands what I‚Äôm saying.]

The fear on the giant‚Äôs face grew even more pronounced as he opened his mouth and timidly replied, ‚ÄúAh Da was sleeping!‚Äù

Seeing how large he was and how loud his snoring had been, it was hard to imagine that his voice was so soft when he spoke. At the very least, it did not make Yang Kai feel any sense of discomfort.

‚ÄúAh Da?‚Äù Yang Kai raised his eyebrows at those words, ‚ÄúIs that your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh Da was sleeping‚Ä¶‚Äù The giant repeated.

Yang Kai frowned, ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh Da was sleeping!‚Äù

Upon hearing those words, he became annoyed, ‚ÄúAre you stupid!?‚Äù

The giant‚Äôs reply was completely irrelevant to the question; hence, he couldn‚Äôt help seriously doubt whether there was something wrong with the giant‚Äôs head.

‚ÄúAh Da is not stupid! Ah Da was sleeping!‚Äù The giant glared at Yang Kai as if feeling a little angry. His expression became tight again.

‚ÄúAre you really stupid?‚Äù Yang Kai was astonished. With just a few words, he could already tell that this giant was somewhat mentally challenged. Why else would the giant be unable to answer such a simple question? Moreover, he kept repeating the same sentence over and over again. That clearly indicated that he was a little lacking in intelligence.

‚ÄúYou say Ah Da is stupid? Ah Da is not stupid!‚Äù The giant seemed to have gotten angry for real and he opened his mouth and let out a roar. The violent flow of air that erupted from his mouth immediately sent Yang Kai flying several thousand kilometres away, his arms flailing wildly in the wind.
