Yu Ru Meng looked at Su Yan, who just happened to look over at her, and then looked at all the others, their eyes filled with longing.

Having lived with them for over 1,000 years, Yu Ru Meng didn’t have to speak and only had to look into their eyes to know what they were thinking.

With a smile, she called out, “Senior, please!”

Bi Xi sighed, “Can’t you show an old man some mercy…”

Yu Ru Meng smiled and assured him, “It’s just a Soul Clone. I’ll get Husband to make it up to you if you suffer any damage.”

Bi Xi bargained, “I want to cultivate in the Dragon Pool. Help me convey my request to that boy.”

He had a Dragon Clan Bloodline and it was extremely strong, so if he could cultivate inside the Dragon Pool, it would be beneficial to him. However, it was a pity that only pureblood Dragon Clan Members could enter the Dragon Pool, so despite being a veteran Divine Spirit, the Dragon Clan wouldn’t allow Bi Xi in.

More importantly, Fu Guang was still healing inside the Dragon Pool and couldn’t be disturbed.

However, if Yang Kai spoke up for him, perhaps the Dragon Clan could make an exception. Also, Yang Kai had previously saved Ji Lao San’s life, and the Dragon Clan were beings that knew how to repay favours.

“Done,” Yu Ru Meng agreed straight away.

“Sit tight,” Bi Xi reminded them, and the Warship instantly turned into a ray of light and shot forward.

Division Commander Chen, who was overseeing this section of the Army, was shocked when he noticed this, but was too late to stop them as Bi Xi’s Soul Clone had already shot away. At first, he thought it was a Squad acting rashly and was about to reprimand them, but then he saw the female figures on the Warship. He moved his lips, but didn’t stop them because he could roughly guess their thoughts.

At the same time, Yang Kai sensed something and looked behind him to see a Warship speeding over. Yu Ru Meng stood proudly on the deck of the Warship with a group of alluring women behind her.

Yang Kai couldn’t hold in his laughter and stood upright while waiting for them.

Meanwhile, Six Arms had also noticed the incoming Warship and his eyes flashed as he raised his hand to stop the Black Ink Clan from taking any action.

They weren’t sure about the situation on that other Warship, but it didn’t seem like it was looking for trouble, so Six Arms didn’t want to start a dispute over something so minor.

A short time later, Bi Xi’s Soul Clone arrived beside Dawning Light and quietly stopped.

Standing on the Warship, Yu Ru Meng raised her chin daringly at Yang Kai.

In the past, when Yang Kai was fighting all on his own, they could only hide behind him because they weren’t strong enough to help their Husband and share his burdens.

But now, they were all Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters and were no longer burdens!

They didn’t want to stay behind anymore and worry every day because they were afraid they might receive bad news about their Husband. Even if they were to die, they would do so together!

“Follow close behind!” Yang Kai nodded lightly at Yu Ru Meng and the others before turning back to look at Six Arms and shouting, “Move out!”

Dawning Light moved forward with the Bi Xi Battleship closely behind. Yu Ru Meng and the others were in high spirits, while Luan Bai Feng was the only one shivering in fear.

[These women have all gone mad!] Even if they were willing to give up their lives for some smelly man, she wasn’t! She and Yang Kai had no feelings for each other, and her life was previously under Yang Kai’s control. It was only when Yang Kai decided to head to the Black Ink Battlefield and removed all names from the Loyalty List that Luan Bai Feng and Chen Tian Fei were able to get their freedom back.

Aboard the Bi Xi Battleship, Luan Bai Feng was so desperate to cry but was unable to shed any tears. If she left the Warship now, she would die, so she could only helplessly stay silent at the back while keeping her guard up.

As Dawning Light and the Bi Xi Battleship moved forward, the Black Ink Clan on both sides stared at them like a flock of hawks, numerous Divine Senses surging about as they communicated with each other.

Meanwhile, on the Human side, hundreds of thousands of Human soldiers remained ready for battle. The Warships had begun humming, prepared to charge at a moment’s notice.

In an instant, no matter whether it was the Humans or Black Ink Clan, both armies were ready for battle.

The Humans were worried that the Black Ink Clan would attack after surrounding Yang Kai and the others while the Black Ink Clan soldiers were just waiting for orders from the Territory Lords. Once the Territory Lords gave the signal, the Black Ink Clan would charge forward and tear the two Warships to pieces.

However, the Territory Lords didn’t make that call.

Under the exchange of Divine Senses, the Territory Lords found it difficult to come to a unanimous decision.

On the one hand, they thought this was a hard opportunity to come by. This might be their best chance to kill this Eighth-Order Human scourge.

Though the other faction didn’t deny this, they were worried about things on a deeper level.

The Humans weren’t idiots. After so many years of battling them, the Black Ink Clan had deeply experienced how deceitful and cunning Humans could be.

Since that Human wanted to pass through the Black Ink Clan Army so recklessly, how could he not have come prepared? Without mentioning the battle that would break out once the Black Ink Clan initiated an attack, would they really be able to kill that Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master if they attacked?

How could this Human have acted so boldly if he wasn’t confident about this matter? Or perhaps… this was what the Humans had planned.

At that moment, the Territory Lords were still arguing in secret. In the end, all the pressure rested on Six Arms’s shoulders because he was their leader in Profound Nether Territory. The other Territory Lords dared not to act rashly without his orders.

On the other hand, Six Arms was sweating profusely.

Several Territory Lords supported the idea of attacking and killing that Eighth-Order Master, so how could he not want to do the same? He had already secretly devised a plan earlier and was just waiting for that Human to head deeper into their ranks before making a move.

No matter what scheme the Humans had, that Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was the key, so the Black Ink Clan would have won half the battle if they had managed to kill him! Even if it meant they would have to suffer huge consequences, it would be worth it.

Such a strong Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was someone all Territory Lords were wary of.

However, just when Six Arms was about to give the order, he suddenly felt a huge sense of crisis wash over him, as if he would immediately die if he made a move!

The sense of danger made him break out in a cold sweat, and he hesitated to decide.

He had never felt time pass so slowly before.

It was as if each breath was a million years long.

Suddenly, the sense of crisis disappeared entirely. Six Arms raised his head in shock and saw that Yang Kai was almost at the end of the Black Ink Clan Army’s formation and was moving straight towards the Territory Gate.

Six Arms felt dismayed, as if he had lost all strength in his body, but he also felt frustrated and relieved at the same time.

It wouldn’t be suitable for them to attack now because they had lost their best opportunity.

At the same time, Wei Jun Yang, Ou Yang Lie, and the others also felt relieved.

Yang Kai and the others had passed the most dangerous area. Since the Black Ink Clan didn’t attack, there was a high possibility that they wouldn’t try anything now; however, they still couldn’t let their guard down because anything could happen before Yang Kai entered the Territory Gate.

Sometime later, Yang Kai had already arrived above the Black Ink Clan’s base camp. He looked down and saw numerous densely packed Low-Rank Black Ink Nests and more than a dozen Mid-Rank Black Ink Nests here. Also, he could make out large numbers of Black Ink Clansmen moving in and out of these nests.

If he made a move now, he could destroy a few Mid-Rank Black Ink Nests, but he didn’t want to cause any chaos because the main purpose of this trip was to pass through this region.

Instead of trying to destroy the Black Ink Nests here, it was better for him to think up a way to wipe out the High-Rank Nests at the No-Return Pass. As long as the High-Rank Black Ink Nests remained, there was no meaning in destroying the Black Ink Nests here and now as all that would do is set off another battle.

Without slowing down, the two Warships sped past the Black Ink Clan’s base camp and soon arrived at the Territory Gate.

There was a Territory Lord and a Black Ink Clan Army standing guard here!

Noticing Yang Kai’s arrival, the Territory Lord took a good look before waving his hand. Only then did the Black Ink Clan Army split apart. Though they were reluctant to accept what was happening, Six Arms and the others had compromised, so he didn’t want to cause any trouble either.

“Human, what is your name?”

Six Arms’ shout came from behind.

Even now, they didn’t even know what Yang Kai’s name was.

Dawning Light had already entered the Territory Gate, so Yang Kai didn’t turn around; however, his voice came from afar, “Profound Nether Army’s Yang Kai!”

“Yang Kai…” Six Arms muttered the name while engraving it in his heart.

Today’s events were a humiliation for the Black Ink Clan, and they had the right to know the name of the one responsible for their embarrassment.

From today onwards, they would spread that Human’s image and name to all the battlefields and remind the Black Ink Clansmen there to be wary of him!

This was how such an enemy Master should be treated!

A moment later, they were gone!

Under the Human Race Army’s watch, Yang Kai led two Warships through the Territory Gate and entered the neighbouring Great Territory.

Meanwhile, the Black Ink Clan didn’t move and just let them leave.

For a while, many were confused because this disastrous world indeed followed the principle of respecting the strong.

The Black Ink Clan had always been overbearing and unruly, but when facing an Army Commander who could kill three Territory Lords all on his own, they didn’t even dare to make a sound. Not only did they agree to such an absurd request, but they also made way and watched them leave without the slightest hindrance.

“The younger generation is indeed more daring!” Wei Jun Yang couldn’t help but sigh with emotion.

Back when they were at the Main Conference Hall, though Yang Kai had successfully persuaded him, he still knew that there was a huge risk to this plan. Any slight problem would have led to a war breaking out between the two sides, putting Yang Kai and those with him in a precarious position.

He wasn’t a fan of such risky moves.

However, this was Yang Kai’s first order after being appointed as the Army Commander, so he couldn’t undermine his authority by disagreeing. This was also why although he agreed to the plan, he also made preparations to save Yang Kai if anything happened.

As it turned out, his worries were all for nothing.

Yang Kai did manage to deter the Black Ink Clan and made them grant him an easement.

The moment Yang Kai led the two Warships through the Territory Gate, Wei Jun Yang had a feeling that he had passed his prime and failed to stifle his laughter.

He was old!

And he couldn’t deny it even if he didn’t want to.

He withdrew his thoughts and looked at the Black Ink Clan before announcing, “Six Arms, the Profound Nether Army’s Army Commander has left. If the Black Ink Clan wishes to start a battle, we Humans are willing to accept the challenge.”

Six Arms looked at Wei Jun Yang before coldly snorting.

[He left? Who knows if he’s really gone? Maybe he’s hiding just beyond the Territory Gate, waiting for us to start a battle so he can sneak up on us from behind.]

Moreover, Six Arms recalled that when Yang Kai appeared that day, he brought along a massive army of Small Stone Race soldiers that helped the Human Race Army attack the Black Ink Clan Army from both sides, causing them to suffer a huge loss.

He couldn’t see any signs of that Small Stone Race Army, so there was no telling where they might be hiding.

Humans were indeed treacherous and filled with ill intentions!Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
