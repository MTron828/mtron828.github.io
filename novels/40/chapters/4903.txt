Yang Kai realized that something was wrong as soon as he stepped into the palace. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The entire place was decorated as a chamber and there were a dozen couches inside. Atop each cough sat a graceful figure with an opaque phoenix coronet and red robes covering them.

Suddenly, the doors of the palace slammed shut.

[What is this?] Yang Kai was puzzled, but he finally understood that this was how Myriad Demons Heaven was going to make things difficult for him. The challenge had simply been inside this time, instead of outside.

Mo Sha’s voice suddenly rang out from nowhere, “Three chances for you to find the right bride. Take her away if you can find her. If not, heh…”

Nothing was said after the chuckle. That meant that if he could not find the right bride, then he also could not take her away.

Yang Kai smiled contemptuously, “I don’t need three chances, one is enough!”

He knew Yu Ru Meng so well after being with her for so many years and was confident that he could find her here with his eyes closed.

Mo Sha snickered, “Don’t be so cocky just yet!”

Yang Kai frowned and immediately took a closer look at those dressed up as brides and was stunned! Outwardly, there was almost no difference between the dozen brides. In terms of height or size, they were all identical!

He was surprised that Myriad Demons Heaven could find so many women of the same physical appearance to pull this off.

Yang Kai quickly composed himself when he realized that, since Myriad Demons Heaven had gone through all the trouble to set this up, it meant that this test was not going to be easy to overcome.

Yang Kai next tried to use his Divine Sense to probe the situation.

Unexpectedly though, all those brides were protected by some kind of strange power that prevented Yang Kai from detecting their cultivation.

[They’ve certainly prepared well enough!] Yang Kai thought that even if Myriad Demons Heaven could find a dozen women of similar height and features as Yu Ru Meng, there would always be some differences in their auras. Yu Ru Meng was in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, and could be distinguished easily by comparing the depth of these women’s cultivation. Yu Ru Meng’s aura should be able to stand out from the crowd.

Now that he had tried though, he realized that Myriad Demons Heaven had taken precautions against this method.

He clenched his fist lightly coughed, cupped his fist and greeted them, “Ru Meng!”

A dozen voices instantly replied, “Husband!”

Yang Kai gasped with his mouth wide open, dumbfounded! Although the brides’ replies were staggered, they all sounded exactly like Yu Ru Meng. It was as if they were all her clones.

Moreover, his original intention to greet the brides was to enable the real Yu Ru Meng to give him a hint, but he did not get anything from her.

When he thought about it, he remembered that Yu Ru Meng was so angry that she was ready to leave him to find someone else to marry, so now, even if he was ready to marry her, it was only natural that she was still upset with him and would not obediently cooperate.

Maybe this test right now was even devised personally by Yu Ru Meng.

Yang Kai realized that based on his understanding of her character, she might really be capable of doing such a thing. He suddenly felt a headache setting in.

After pondering for a moment, Yang Kai slowly walked to the nearest couch, lowered his body to take a closer look, and tried to use his nose to sniff.

The bride in front of him giggled softly, “Husband, they are all fake. You’d better not choose the wrong one. If you choose the wrong one, I will never forgive you!”

Yang Kai nodded confidently, “Rest assured, I will not choose wrongly!”

As he spoke, he came to the second couch and continued to observe and sniff.

It took a half cup of tea’s time to finish checking everyone. Then he appeared confident and smiled as he declared, “I think I know where you are!”

A soft laughter was heard, and Yu Ru Meng’s voice called out, “Since you know, then take me away.”

Yang Kai nodded, “I’ll take you away now!”

After he said that, he walked swiftly to the couch in the center, grabbed the bride in front of him by the arm and said, “You’re the one!”

The bride who was grabbed stumbled, and fell directly into Yang Kai’s arms, giggling happily.

Yang Kai suddenly realized something was amiss. He lifted the red veil only to see a bright-eyed young girl smiling in his arms, but she was not Yu Ru Meng. He totally did not know who she was.

“You…” Yang Kai’s jaw dropped, and quickly tried to let go.

The young girl laughed and said, “Martial Aunt Ru Meng was right. You really tried to find her by her scent, so Martial Aunt left some of her perfume on me!”

The cultivation of the young girl was Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. Although she was equal to Yu Ru Meng in terms of cultivation, since Yu Ru Meng was now Mo Sha’s Disciple, her status in Myriad Demons Heaven was significantly higher; thus, the young girl had to address her as Martial Aunt.

The young girl stuck to Yang Kai and would not back off. She looked up at him with doe eyes as she asked, “Martial Uncle, don’t you want to marry me? I would be so glad.”

“How highly improper!” Yang Kai pushed her aside gently before he began to stroke his chin and continued to look at the dozen or so Yu Ru Mengs in front of him, beginning to feel flustered.

After a while, he pleaded, “Ru Meng, stop this tantrum, be a good girl, and come away with me.”

No one responded to him.

Yang Kai, continued to reminisce openly about the time he spent with her in the Demon Realm, making them sound like the best days of his life when they were foolish and in love. He was trying to use this emotional card to force a reaction from her.

Suddenly, one bride’s body moved slightly.

Yang Kai immediately scurried over, grinned, and asked, “Is that you? Ru Meng?”

The person in front of him did not reply, but the voice of Mo Sha sounded again, “Brat, you only have one last chance, you better make good use of it!”

Yang Kai’s face froze.

Was the woman in front of him not her? He lifted the red veil and sure enough, the bride was not Yu Ru Meng. It was another unknown woman who looked at him cheekily with a smile.

Yang Kai asked curiously, “Why did you move just now?”

The woman replied with a giggle, “What’s wrong with me moving a little after sitting for such a long time?”

Yang Kai wanted to ask if she did that on purpose, but it was pointless. Two of the three chances had been wasted. Now he only had one last chance.

Mo Sha had already spoken, so if Yang Kai could not find the real Yu Ru Meng with this third selection, he wouldn’t get any more.

This caused him to feel as if he was carrying a mountain on his shoulders.

However, it was really difficult to find Ru Meng here. Although there were only a dozen brides in the hall, and Yang Kai had eliminated two of them, the rest still looked exactly the same as Yu Ru Meng in form and posture. He also could not detect her from the differences from their auras because they were protected by that inexplicable power.

Yang Kai frowned and began thinking hard.

There are indeed many people with similar features in the world, but it was impossible to have so many that look exactly the same, especially when they all came from Myriad Demons Heaven.

Yang Kai was originally surprised that Myriad Demons Heaven could find so many people with such a similar body shape and height to Yu Ru Meng, but now it seemed that there was something else going on here!

These brides should have used some Secret Technique to achieve this level of similarity.

In other words, as long as he found some flaw in this Secret Technique, he could identify which was the real Yu Ru Meng.

Yang Kai suddenly understood the purpose of Myriad Demons Heaven’s test.

However, at this point, he had no intention to hide anything. Since he would be going deep into the Void Corridor to re-seal it, it didn’t matter if this little secret of his was exposed.

With a slightly wry smile, Yang Kai immediately activated the golden Demon Eye of Annihilation, which could see through all illusions.

Immediately, he could see the dozen or so people in front of him had indeed changed. The original dozen women with identical features had now, under the gaze of his Demon Eye of Annihilation, changed in varying degrees. Some become taller, others shorter.

Only one person among them had not changed at all!

Yang Kai stepped forward, stretched out his hand, and called out warmly, “Ru Meng!”

The person in front of him rose up and placed her hand in his, and Yang Kai picked her up by the waist with swift movement!

The next moment, the soft flesh at his waist was fiercely pinched, and Yu Ru Meng’s voice sounded affectionately in his ears, “Consider yourself lucky!”

Yang Kai endured the pain with a happy smile.

When he walked out of the palace, Mo Sha appeared to have something on his mind, but did not say anything else.

After thanking him, the ship set sail again and rushed to the next Spirit Province.

The fourth stop was the site of Divine Medicine Cave Heaven.

Among the 36 Cave Heavens, there was a Divine Cauldron Cave Heaven and a Divine Medicine Cave Heaven, one for Artifact Refining and one for Alchemy.

The original Open Heaven Pill recipe was rumoured to have been devised by the forefathers of Divine Medicine Cave Heaven over the course of many years.

Most of the high-end Spirit Pills in the 3,000 Worlds also originated from Divine Medicine Cave Heaven.

Now that Yu Ru Meng had been accepted by Myriad Demons Heaven, Yang Kai thought, [Perhaps Little Senior Sister has now become a Disciple of Divine Medicine Heaven?]

Little Senior Sister was born with the Sacred Spirit Medicine Body and had a unique advantage in the Alchemic Dao, so her joining Divine Medicine Cave Heaven was perfect for her.

Yang Xue nodded from the side and said, “Exactly, Divine Medicine Heaven’s Purple Jade Divine Monarch, Zi Yu, has accepted Ning Chang as his Disciple.”

Yang Kai had gone through a lot of hardships to become a Son-in-Law of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, even spending a year in the Dao Theory Assembly facing down vicious criminals, but now, with these marriages, he had become related to many Cave Heavens and Paradises.

Each of the previous Cave Heavens and Paradises had tests of varying difficulty, and Divine Medicine Cave Heaven seemed to be no exception.

Outside the premises, two huge Alchemy Furnaces had been set up. It was obvious that this was a competition of Alchemy techniques.

Yang Kai did not know whether to laugh or cry. For him to compete in Alchemy with a Divine Medicine Cave Heaven’s disciple was more or less like a novice trying to show off meager skills before an expert.

Although he was also versed in the Alchemic Dao, the most recent time Yang Kai performed any real Alchemy was already hundreds of years ago when he was first refining the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill. Since he entered the 3,000 Worlds, Yang Kai had really not put much effort into his Alchemy studies.

It could be said that his mastery over the Alchemic Dao was only a little bit higher than when he left the Star Boundary. According to his own classification system, his Alchemic Dao had stagnated at the fourth level, Traversing a Familiar Path.

How could he compare to an opponent who specialized in Alchemy? A Divine Medicine Cave Heaven’s Open Heaven Realm Master, who had been immersed in the Alchemic Dao for centuries, if not millennia, would absolutely have higher attainments than him.

There was no comparison.

At the critical moment, it was Wondrous Pill Great Emperor who took up this task.

Wondrous Pill Great Emperor was a man whose Grand Dao was the Alchemic Dao, and after advancing to the Open Heaven Realm, his mastery over Alchemy had improved greatly.

Yang Kai did not know how good Wondrous Pill had become, but if he looked at the entire Void Land and High Heaven Palace party, he was the only one who could compete with Divine Medicine Cave Heaven in this field.

Furthermore, Xia Ning Chang was Wondrous Pill’s Disciple in all but name as well, so it made sense for him to take responsibility here.
