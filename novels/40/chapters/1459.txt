Chapter 1459, Arriving At The Ice Road Again

Hearing Yang Kai ask this, Bi Luo naturally understood what he was worried about and smiled slightly, “Because Mistress inherited the Source of a Heavenly Moon Demon Spider!”

“Heavenly Moon Demon Spider?” Yang Kai’s face changed slightly.

“Oh, you’ve heard of it?” Bi Luo also looked at him with some curiosity.

Yang Kai nodded lightly. The Heavenly Moon Demon Spider was one of the Ancient Divine Spirits, strictly speaking, it was an existence at the same rank as Dragons and Phoenixes but which was weaker or stronger was difficult to say; after all, no one living had witnessed a battle between Ancient Divine Spirits.

Yang Kai knew about the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider because of the relatively large amount of contact he had with Ancient Divine Spirits recently. Whether it was the Golden Dragon’s Remnant Soul he possessed or the Ice Phoenix Remnant Soul which belonged to Su Yan, both could be classified as Ancient Divine Spirits.

“How did Qing Luo obtain a Heavenly Moon Demon Spider’s Source?” Yang Kai frowned, but suddenly thinking of something, he asked, “Could it be the giant spider you met when you first arrived on Monster Emperor Star...”

“En, it was the corpse of a Heavenly Moon Demon Spider,” Bi Luo cast him an appreciative look, “Mistress spent a great deal of time examining and researching it yet ultimately couldn’t figure out what it was, but the reason Red Moon Tribal Lord decided to accept Mistress as her adopted daughter was for this reason. Why else would Red Moon Tribal Lord give Mistress so many benefits for no reason?”

“So that’s how it is!” Yang Kai nodded gently. If this was the case, then things made sense.

Shan Qing Luo possessing the strength of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider’s Source was because she had absorbed the mysterious energy from the body of a true Heavenly Moon Demon Spider, causing her bloodline to transform.

Yang Kai even suspected that Shan Qing Luo being able to reach Monster Emperor Star directly through that strange altar was related to the dead Heavenly Moon Demon Spider. The altar itself might have been created by that Heavenly Moon Demon Spider.

Shan Qing Luo’s lineage and her Poison Widow Body were probably inherited from it as well.

Everything was connected!

“Then where is your Mistress now? Did she enter the Emperor Garden as well?” Yang Kai asked urgently.

Hearing this question, Bi Luo’s expression immediately darkened and nodded, “We both entered this place, but I was separated from Mistress after arriving here, so I don’t know where she is now.”

Obtaining such a response, Yang Kai could not help but sigh.

“Seems you have a little bit of conscience,” Bi Luo pursed her lips upon seeing Yang Kai worried about Shan Qing Luo, thinking he was a bit more pleasing to the eye, “But you can rest assured, even if Mistress is alone she shouldn’t be in any danger, she’s already a Third-Order Origin Realm master and is almost invincible amongst cultivators in her realm.”

“She’s become that strong?” Yang Kai was taken aback.

Being invincible in the same realm wasn’t that surprising; after all, Shan Qing Luo now possessed the Source Strength of a Heavenly Moon Demon Spider so her strength no longer conformed to common sense; however, her cultivation reaching the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm was what truly shocked Yang Kai.

He believed that his own cultivation speed was incredibly quick, but he had not expected that Shan Qing Luo’s would be more exaggerated than his. However, this too wasn’t unacceptable after he thought about it carefully; after all, according to Bi Luo, when Shan Qing Luo absorbed the mysterious energy from the corpse of the Ancient Divine Spirit, she had broken through from the Second-Order Saint Realm to First-Order Origin Returning Realm directly in only a few years.

“Heh heh, if you don’t work harder, Mistress will certainly fall in love with someone else, you little bastard; no woman is willing to be with a man who can’t protect her,” Bi Luo’s quipped while taking pleasure in Yang Kai’s misfortune.

In the past, Shan Qing Luo’s cultivation had been higher than Yang Kai’s, but after so many years, not only had the gap not narrowed, it had instead expanded. This made Bi Luo subconsciously think that Yang Kai wasn’t worthy of her Mistress’s affection, and feel a complicated sense of smugness as well as pity towards Yang Kai mix with a tinge of disappointment.

“Mind your own business!” Yang Kai snorted. When he thought about that enchantress Shan Qing Luo, while feeling some pain in his heart, he did not feel any kind of fear. However, that woman’s charm was somewhat incomprehensible; Yang Kai was easily able to resist the temptations of other women, even when Yin Su Die used her Charm Technique on him he was able to casually ignore it, but when it came to Shan Qing Luo...

Yang Kai honestly was not sure he would be able to remain calm in front of her. If he were to accidentally be captivated, mind and body, by her, his upright reputation would instantly be ruined.

“Forget it, let’s not talk about this now. The Emperor Garden is so massive that it may not necessarily be possible for us to even meet,” Yang Kai seemed to be talking to Bi Luo, but also consoling himself. Although Shan Qing Luo had used a Secret Technique on him long ago called the Soul Seeking Seal which she could use to perceive his position, after so many years, even if he hadn’t deliberately tried to erase this Soul Seeking Seal, it had still almost disappeared.

It would probably be impossible for Shan Qing Luo to find him through this Soul Seeking Seal.

“En, in any case, after this Emperor Garden closes, I’ll be returned to Monster Emperor Star and tell Mistress all about your situation,” Bi Luo smiled lightly. Her Mistress had been worried about Yang Kai for so many years, so if she knew he was doing just fine and had already entered the Star Field, she would definitely be very happy, “Which Cultivation Star are you on now?”

“Shadowed Star, but you can’t travel there,” Yang Kai shook his head slowly before explaining Shadowed Star’s situation briefly. Bi Luo listened intently while preparing to report to Shan Qing Luo in detail.

“By the way, are you looking for an ice road?” After they finished catching up, Bi Luo suddenly seemed to remember something and turned to Yang Kai to ask.

“Yeah, have you seen it?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

“En, I came across something that might be what you’re seeking, but I can’t be certain,” Bi Luo said hesitantly. When she was being chased after by those four cultivators, she had not been able to choose which direction she ran and had once fled down a long corridor. Originally, she thought about entering this passageway to find a place to hide and throw off her pursuers, but after realizing how profound the chill was inside of it, she had given up on this idea and escaped. It was after that incident that she ran into the trio from Clear Sky Sect and dragged them into her predicament.

Listening to her description, Yang Kai was overjoyed and anxiously asked, “Do you remember the specific location?”

If the description Bi Luo gave was accurate, that place was certainly the ice road he was looking for.

“I should, I’ll take you there,” Bi Luo said as she stood up.

Although she was still feeling a little weak, her cultivation wasn’t low, so after such a period of rest and restoration. As long as she didn’t have to exert herself greatly, moving about shouldn’t be a problem, so Yang Kai didn’t try to stop her. Carefully releasing his Divine Sense to monitor their surroundings, Yang Kai followed Bi Luo.

Their destination was not too far, so it only took Yang Kai and Bi Luo less than half a day to arrive.

“This is it,” Looking at the familiar environment around him, Yang Kai showed a happy expression. Although the scenes inside the Emperor Garden’s main palace were not exactly the same as the last time he came, the differences were quite subtle.

Since that was the case, and because he had been here once before, how could Yang Kai not recognize this ice road?

Feeling the bitter chill which pulsed from the ice road, Bi Luo’s face turned pale. Even if she was at full strength, if she were to enter this place, she would definitely die, not to mention now that she was severely wounded.

“Should I wait for you outside?” Bi Luo asked.

“No, you should come with me!” Yang Kai shook his head. After crossing the ice road, he had to look for the Life Revitalizing Jade Cream, so he was not planning on coming back. As such, he would not feel assured leaving Bi Luo alone here.

“You want me to follow you in?” Bi Luo frowned, obviously feeling uneasy.

“Don’t worry, I’ve walked along this road once before so protecting your safety won’t be an issue,” Yang Kai grinned.

“Alright... I hope I won’t die without realizing why,” Bi Luo sighed helplessly. Although her words were filled with anxiety, she did not try to put up an argument, so it was quite obvious she deeply trusted Yang Kai.

“En, let’s go!” Yang Kai nodded before walking towards the ice road.

As soon as they stepped onto the ice road, frigid energy wrapped around them, making it seem as if even their souls would soon freeze. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Yang Kai did not panic though and instead pushed his Saint Qi to condense a flame halo around himself and Bi Luo, instantly isolating them from the surrounding cold. His burning hot Demonic Flames had a strong protective effect against the Ice Attribute Energy of this place.

“Oh? Has someone else been here already?” Yang Kai looked around and could not help but raise his brow in surprise.

This ice road showed clear signs of someone traversing it. Many of the surrounding icicles were damaged or destroyed while the frozen corpses which had been scattered about were also smashed, so it was clear that a battle had taken place here. From the lingering energy fluctuations, it seemed this fight had taken place recently as well.

Soon, Yang Kai even heard some faint explosions up ahead, indicating that someone was still fighting.

Yang Kai and Bi Luo exchanged a glance before silently concealing their auras and heading towards the place where the battle was taking place.

The deeper the pair went, the more terrible the cold became. Soon Yang Kai’s Saint Qi defence alone wasn’t enough to resist the chill, so with no other choice, he could only summon his Firebird Artifact Spirit and have it transform into a flame light curtain to protect him and Bi Luo.

“Is this an Artifact Spirit?” Bi Luo’s beautiful eyes widened in wonder, “You possess such a powerful Fire Attribute Artifact Spirit?”

At that moment, she could not help raising her evaluation of Yang Kai a bit.

“Shh...” Yang Kai shot her a glare before continuing to move forward.

Although he was deliberately concealing his aura, the energy fluctuations of the Firebird Artifact Spirit could not be covered up, so Yang Kai couldn’t be sure whether the people fighting up ahead would be able to detect them. Regardless, Yang Kai felt he and Bi Luo needed to act even more carefully now.

After the time it would take for an incense stick to burn, Yang Kai arrived at the periphery of the battlefield. Hiding behind a small ice pillar and secretly observing, Yang Kai saw two women wearing white dresses desperately fighting against a white rabbit-like beast.

This white rabbit looked quite small and exquisite, as if it was carved from pure, flawless white jade; however, every one of its actions affected the Ice Attribute Energy in the air. In other words, this white rabbit could control the chill here and use it to perform terrifying attacks.

The two women who were fighting against this rabbit had powerful cultivations at the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm and had clearly cultivated Ice Attribute Secret Arts, because the Martial Skills and artifact attacks they used all exuded a frigid aura. Fighting in this environment no doubt allowed them to exert greater strength for a longer period than they normally could.

But even so, these two women still could not gain the upper hand and instead were slowly being suppressed by the white rabbit, causing anxious looks to fill their faces.

As for what this white rabbit was, that was obvious.

[The World Spirit!] Yang Kai’s eyes lit up.
