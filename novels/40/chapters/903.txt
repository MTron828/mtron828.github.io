Chapter 904, Stone Platforms

“If we want to move on, we can only use those stone platforms,” Thunder Dragon Great Senior shifted his gaze and said.

There was no path leading left or right along the canyon, but suspended a short distance above the strange green sea there was a stone platform roughly three metres wide and three metres long. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

After the first platform there was a second, then a third, then a fourth, and so on, each one floating slightly higher than the last, almost like a staircase that stretched on without end.

Above the green sea, a strange, fierce wind blew, containing an ominous energy, causing everyone present to not dare try to fly.

“Do we go on?” Earth Splitting Divine Ox asked, somewhat uncertain if they should continue this exploration.

Although there was a way forward consisting of these stone platforms, no one could guarantee that there wouldn’t be more dangers ahead.

“This is already our second time here. Before this King can make clear what this place is, I won’t go back,” Thunder Dragon Great Senior said firmly before stepping onto the first stone platform.

Cai Die followed without hesitation.

“Kid, you follow Thunder Dragon closely, this Old Ox will bring up the rear!” Earth Splitting Divine Ox nodded to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded back and stepped onto the stone platforms with Li Rong.

Each stone platform was not too far apart from the next, easily reachable by simply lifting one’s foot, forming a path that seemed to lead straight up into the endless sky.

Thunder Dragon walked very slowly as he vigilantly observed his surroundings in case any unexpected danger suddenly appeared, acting extremely cautiously.

Initially, as they ascended the stone platforms, nothing happened, so the group couldn’t help relaxing somewhat.

However, after advancing forward a fair distance, the green sea down below suddenly seemed to boil and numerous floating faces rushed to the surface and began letting out terrifying howls

A moment later, the innumerable Soul-Spirit Bodies broke free from the shackles binding them to the green sea, and like predators smelling their prey, they surged towards Yang Kai’s group.

The disembodied howls and piercing cries mixed together with the whipping winds as the transparent Soul-Spirit Bodies flew towards the group of six from directions.

Everyone instantly went pale, not understanding how this had suddenly happened.

In the blink of an eye, the stone platforms the group of six were standing on were surrounded by the Soul-Spirit Bodies and wave after wave of potent Spiritual Energy attacks rained down on them.

Even Thunder Dragon and Earth Splitting Divine Ox couldn’t help feeling like their very will to live had been crushed, almost completely disabling them.

A great roar rang out and a blue arc of lightning flew out from Thunder Dragon Great Senior, quickly forming into a thin light curtain.

*Xiu xiu xiu...*

This lightning curtain flashed brilliantly as the torrent of Spiritual Energy blasts continued pelting it from the outside, a few moments later showing signs of cracking.

Earth Splitting Divine Ox quickly followed up, forming a second light barrier around them, cooperating with Thunder Dragon Great Senior to shield the group from this omni-directional attack.

Cai Die’s seven coloured wings fluttered, releasing numerous rays of light that shot through and pushed back the closest Soul Spirit Bodies.

Li Rong and Jin Ni also acted, both of them displaying their own powerful means.

However, the attacks released by the surrounding Soul Spirit Bodies did not decrease in the slightest, creating a tight encirclement that allowed for no escape.

“Run!” Thunder Dragon shouted, immediately increasing his pace, the other five following right behind him, each of them leaping up the stone platforms as fast as possible.

*Pu...*

Even though the light curtain created by the two Great Seniors was incredibly powerful, facing so many attacks, it still only lasted a few breaths before shattering, barely long enough for the group to advance three hundred meters.

The Soul Spirit Bodies that were flitting about became even more violent seeing this, swarming over like locusts descending upon a field.

These warped Souls, even though they had degenerated into mere beasts, seemed to understand the concept of bullying the weak while fearing the strong. Instinctually understanding that Thunder Dragon and the other Saints possessed tyrannical methods, they all began aiming their attacks towards Yang Kai who seemed the weakest and had yet to even fight back.

The transparent Soul-Spirit Bodies flew about randomly, and although most of them were blocked by the five Saints, a few of them still slipped through and rushed towards Yang Kai.

Not even slowing down, the Soul Spirit bodies plunged into Yang Kai’s body and disappeared.

“Master!” Li Rong’s beautiful face went pale as she desperately rushed towards Yang Kai, even forgetting about the Soul Spirit Bodies that were charging towards her.

A flash of lightning shot over from nearby, resolving Li Rong’s crisis, but failing to change the fate of Yang Kai who had been invaded by multiple Soul Spirit Bodies.

In an instant, Yang Kai’s expression became pained, his eyes turning bloodshot as he trembled uncontrollably.

Everyone present felt a cold chill grip their hearts, understanding he was being influenced by the thick resentment contained inside these Soul-Spirit Bodies. Each of these Soul-Spirit Bodies was formerly a master that had at least reached the Saint Realm. After spending countless years trapped inside the green sea, even though they had not been destroyed, their accumulated hatred and resentment was not something a cultivator of Yang Kai’s strength could resist.

Perhaps his Soul was already being obliterated while his body was being taken over.

Thunder Dragon was temporarily thrown into a state of shock, not knowing how to handle this situation.

A moment later though, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed brilliantly and then became tranquil once more, as if he had received some kind of extrication, his breathing becoming steady as he let out a sigh of relief, “What are you all gawking at, we need to keep moving!”

“You... are you alright?” Thunder Dragon asked in astonishment.

From the time the Soul Spirit Bodies crashed into Yang Kai’s body until he seemingly recovered, only a single breath had passed. Everything had happened so fast that no one was able to react. Most importantly though, Thunder Dragon couldn’t understand how Yang Kai was able to emerge from this crisis unscathed.

There had been multiple Soul Spirit Bodies that drilled into Yang Kai’s body just now, each one containing the full strength of a Saint Realm cultivator’s Soul.

“If we don’t get moving, none of us will be alright!” Yang Kai said solemnly.

Thunder Dragon also understood that now was not the time for questions and immediately focused, pushing his strength to its limits to open up a path ahead. With arcs of lightning swirling around his body, the Soul-Spirit Bodies did not dare approach rashly, allowing the group of six to continue rushing up the stone platforms.

Li Rong came up beside Yang Kai to assist him in resisting the attacks of the Soul-Spirit Bodies while quietly observing him, a moment later her beautiful eyes lit up, understanding why even after he had been invaded by so many resentful Souls he was safe and sound.

Inside his Knowledge Sea, there was Great Demon God’s Demon Eye of Annihilation!

The Demon Eye of Annihilation’s golden light was able to absolutely restrain all forms of Spiritual Energy, the Soul Spirit Bodies that had crashed into Yang Kai’s body might as well have been leaping to their deaths.

After this incident, the remaining Soul-Spirit Bodies seemed instinctually feel some kind of threat and didn’t dare to approach the group of six again, only surrounding them and wailing as if to vent their unwillingness.

Thunder Dragon and the other Monster Race masters were puzzled by this but weren’t about to complain about being able to easily pass through the stone platforms.

After roughly the time it would take a stick of incense to burn, the group of six finally saw the end of the stone platforms.

Stepping off the final stone platform, everyone couldn’t help showing a confused look.

Because the place they had arrived at was not the chaotic sky, but instead another field.

It was almost as if they had returned to where they had entered from, a barren land stretched out before them, but instead of a grey swirling sky above them, a myriad of strangely coloured lights flickered about.

These lights seemed to almost be within reach, yet they were impossible to grasp.

“This place is really strange!” Earth Splitting Divine Ox shook his head.

Thunder Dragon carefully released his Divine Sense, and upon not discovering any danger in their immediate surroundings he proposed, “Let’s take a break for a while.”

In order to pass the stone platforms, all of them had expended a great deal of power. In this crisis-ridden place, they could not afford to miss any chance to restore themselves to their peak.

Thunder Dragon Great Senior didn’t dare to act rashly here.

Of course, no one objected to this suggestion and all of them immediately sat down cross-legged to restore their physical and spiritual strength.

The two Great Seniors sat next to each other and began discussing something in whispered voices, occasionally glancing over towards Yang Kai as they spoke.

Although he was meditating with his eyes closed, their actions did not escape Yang Kai’s perception.

Opening his eyes and smiling wryly, Yang Kai took the initiative to ask, “Do two Great Seniors suspect that I’ve been taken over?”

Thunder Dragon frowned for a moment but decided to not hold back and nodded, “En, both Old Ox and I had such thoughts, but from the tone of your voice, it doesn’t seem like you’ve been supplanted by one of those Soul-Spirit Bodies.”

“Of course I haven’t,” Yang Kai nodded.

“What evidence can you show us to prove that?” Thunder Dragon asked solemnly, “Kid, this King really can’t figure out what method you could possibly possess to withstand the invasion of so many Soul Spirit Bodies, if you can’t prove to us somehow that you are who you say you are, then This King will have no choice but to seal your strength, I hope you can understand.”

“How does Great Senior propose I prove myself?” Yang Kai frowned, thinking that Thunder Dragon and the other’s concerns were reasonable so not taking any offence.

“Just show us something that can prove you are that body’s original owner.”

“There’s no need for that, I can guarantee that he is still who he claims to be! I won’t mistake the person I serve for an impersonator,” Li Rong suddenly declared.

Thunder Dragon and Earth Splitting Divine Ox exchanged a glance with one another before turning their eyes to Yang Kai then to Li Rong, a moment later the two of them nodding, “Good, we will believe in the lady’s vision for now. To be honest, we also do not hope your body was seized by another.”

“Two Great Seniors are well-intentioned, I understand,” Yang Kai gently nodded.

With the matter temporarily resolved, everyone continued to restore themselves.

After half a day, the group began exploring again.

After passing over the green sea, it seemed as if they had arrived in a completely different world.

From time to time, high up in the sky, a meteor-like ray of light would fly by quickly, appearing and disappearing before anyone could actually capture its image.

However, what surprised everyone was that even after a long time, forget about dangers, nothing even worth noting occurred.

Everyone slowly began to feel like they were walking on a never ending path, a loop that had no beginning or end.

This strange sensation caused everyone’s hear to sink.

Soon, the group of six lost track of time in this truly desolate wasteland where the scenery seemed to never change.

The one with the shortest temper, Earth Splitting Divine Ox, had long ago become impatient and spent all day grumbling.

Thunder Dragon Great Senior was also feeling some regret. If he had known that it would end up like this, he wouldn’t have insisted on exploring this place. However, even if he wanted to turn back, he couldn’t, so all he could do was move forward and hope they would eventually discovering something of interest.
