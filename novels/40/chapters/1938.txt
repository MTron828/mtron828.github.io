The more Yang Kai learned about the Star Boundary’s wonders, the more he realized how grand this world truly was and how small his existence was.

He felt a deep desire for greater power.

As the two were talking though, suddenly, Yang Kai’s expression turned extremely serious.

“What happened?” Liu Xian Yun looked at him with a puzzled expression, but in the next instant, her body became stiff as her pretty face turned to Yang Kai’s nervously.

Yang Kai put a finger up to his lips and gestured for her to stay silent.

But before Liu Xian Yun could even respond, a light flashed at the entrance of the cave and a figure suddenly appeared in front of them.

The two of them instinctively pushed their Saint Qi and flew back to take up defensive stances as they stared at this newcomer warily.

The visitor had no intention of hiding his presence though as he simply looked at Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun coldly and sneered, “You two little rats are quite vigilant.”

With the help of the dim light, Yang Kai could see the opponent’s face clearly.

He was a man who looked around thirty years old and was dressed in fine white robes, but that was of little consequence. What Yang Kai really cared about was this man’s aura, one that was unfathomably deep, far more so than Yin Le Sheng’s back in the Starlight Corridor and one that brought him great pressure.

[Dao Source Realm!]

As this thought flashed across Yang Kai’s mind, his face became more and more ugly.

Both he and Liu Xian Yun were peak level existences in their respective Star Fields, so after concealing themselves inside this cave to talk while completely withdrawing their auras, if it had been another Origin King it would have been impossible to notice them.

But if the other party was a Dao Source master, it was obvious he would be aware of their existence.

Yang Kai did not know exactly how powerful a Dao Source Realm cultivator was, only that this man was not someone he could compete with right now.

*Xiu xiu xiu...*

Several whooshing sounds came from outside as three more figures landed at the edge of the cave behind the first man to appear.

One of them asked, “Senior Brother Kou, what did you find?”

Another man said in surprise, “Hey, there really are two people hiding here. Senior Brother Kou’s senses are really amazing, actually able to find them here.”

The last person laughed, “Senior Brother Kou is a First-Order Dao Source Realm master while these two are just like us, how could they hide under Senior Brother Kou’s nose?”

The three men observed Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun mockingly after they entered the cave, the eyes of the person who spoke first flashing a meaningful light. Observing Yang Kai first, then Liu Xian Yun, a knowing grin appeared on his face, obviously thinking that these two were hiding in this small cave to do something shameful.

Although Liu Xian Yun looked embarrassed, she didn’t dare lash out.

Yang Kai also remained silent.

Without even mentioning the other party had three Third-Order Origin Kings, just the lead Dao Source master was more than he and Liu Xian Yun could handle now, so Yang Kai had to act discreetly. Fortunately, the other party had not immediately attacked, otherwise, he and Liu Xian Yun would have suffered disaster already.

The Senior Brother Kou who led this group gave Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun a cold look over as the light in his eyes became more and more contemptuous, snorting a moment later as he commented, “Seems like there is only some slight Source Qi in your bodies. Where are you two from and what are you plotting here in my Blue Feather Sect?”

“Blue Feather Sect?” Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun looked at each other as they both showed confused expressions.

Quickly though, the two of them speculated that they had inadvertently intruded into the territory of this so-called Blue Feather Sect and had now been discovered by its disciples. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Considering all this, Yang Kai tried to put on a relaxed expression as he cupped his fists and said, “Greetings friends, we didn’t know this was the site of your noble Sect and accidentally trespassed. If we have offended you in any way, please forgive us. You may rest assured; we will depart immediately!”

Saying so, Yang Kai winked at Liu Xian Yun.

Liu Xian Yun understood his intentions and tried to follow Yang Kai out.

The leading man surnamed Kou and the other three Origin Kings, however, stood at the entrance of the cave, motionless, showing no intention to give way.

The man surnamed Kou sneered and said, “Accidentally trespassed? You might be able to fool children with such lies, but you think you can deceive this Kou? I think it’s more likely you’re from Daybreak Pavilion!”

“Daybreak Pavilion?” Yang Kai frowned before shaking his head, “Sorry, I‘ve never heard of it.”

“Your acting skills aren’t bad,” One of the Origin Kings sneered and said. “Senior Brother Kou, don’t talk nonsense with them, let us just take them back with us and make them spit out the truth. Daring to trespass into my Blue Feather Sect’s site, these Daybreak Pavilion dogs simply don’t put us in their eyes.”

The man surnamed Kou also spoke with a cold expression, “Better to kill a thousand innocents than let off one guilty!”

Saying so, he stretched out his hand and formed a seal before pressing his palms towards Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun up ahead.

Two beams of light shot out and struck Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun’s chests before they could dodge.

The two were taken aback and hurriedly tried to resist, but to their amazement, they found that some kind of rope had at some point appeared on their bodies. These ropes were covered in dense runes that flashed lightly and completely suppressed them.

The more the two struggled, the firmer this Secret Technique’s binding became.

Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun’s complexions instantly became gloomy.

A casual move was enough to completely seal their fighting ability, making Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun fully realize how terrifying a Dao Source Realm master was.

After finishing this, the man surnamed Kou did not spare Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun a second glance and simply waved, “Take them!”

Saying so, he turned around and did not even give them an opportunity to argue.

Yang Kai was annoyed but knew that now was not the time to act rashly.

The three cultivators following the man surnamed Kou swarmed up and pushed Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun outwards.

Liu Xian Yun twisted her body and ground her teeth as she snapped, “Don’t touch me, I can walk myself!”

The previous cultivator who kept looking at Liu Xian Yun sneered and said, “The little lady here is quite grumpy, I like it! Let’s see how you stand up to some torture later.”

The other two showed an expression of wicked understanding hearing this.

This only frustrated Liu Xian Yun even more.

She was an overlord of the Grand Desolation Star Field, but after coming here, before she could even enjoy the sights and scenes of the Star Boundary, she had been taken prisoner. She had never encountered such an embarrassing situation in her life and found it simply unacceptable.

And listening to the way these three men were chatting, it seemed that after arriving at Blue Feather Sect, the ‘torture’ she would suffer would be...

Just imagining it caused Liu Xian Yun’s pretty face to pale as she instinctually turned to Yang Kai for help.

“Several friends, there seems to be a misunderstanding between us, could you listen to my explanation first?” Yang Kai calmly made a last-ditch attempt.

“Explanation? You can explain all you like once we’re back at the sect!” The man surnamed Kou snorted coldly.

“Yeah, first hand over your Space Rings if you want to avoid some immediate pain!”

Yang Kai glanced at Liu Xian Yun as he shook his head slowly, taking off his Space Ring and tossing it towards the nearest person.

There was not anything valuable in his Space Ring, just some everyday items he needed frequently. The real precious treasures were hidden inside his Sealed World Bead.

As such, surrendering his Space Ring did not cause Yang Kai much of a psychological burden.

On the other hand, Liu Xian Yun wore a look of intense struggle and unwillingness. If it were not for her strength being sealed right now, she would likely have gone all out to resist.

All her possessions were stored in her Space Ring, so how could she be willing to simply hand it over like this?

However, people under the eaves must bow their heads, so she could only reluctantly remove her ring like Yang Kai and throw it out.

Receiving the two Space Rings, the three Origin Kings did not try to inspect them at all and instead turned them over to their leader. Senior Brother Kou was very satisfied with their performance and simply put these Space Rings away.

A short time later, the group left the cave.

Senior Brother Kou waved his hand lightly and summoned a small shuttle which immediately enlarged to a ship engraved with dragons and phoenixes in the blink of an eye.

This ship was not very big, only having about two decks to it, but it was more than enough to accommodate their small number.

Senior Brother Kou casually leapt up, binding Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun with his own strength and landed lightly on the deck. The other three quickly followed.

Subsequently, Senior Brother Kou activated a Spirit Array on the ship and a light barrier surrounded it before it shot off with astonishing speed.

Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun both observed all of this in amazement, pure surprise and shock filling their eyes.

In their respective Star Fields, neither of them had ever encountered this type of flight artifact. They had only seen Star Shuttles and Starships.

Although this ship was not grand or magnificent like a Starship, its refinement was vastly superior, and it was incomparable to a mere Star Shuttle in terms of practicality.

It was a type of existence between a Star Shuttle and Starship that was incredibly well suited for rapid travel.

The man surnamed Kou and the others did not pay Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun any mind; after all, their strength was sealed so they posed no threat at all.

However, after seeing the expressions of the two, the Blue Feather Sect’s disciples could not help but laugh as they got together and whispered amongst themselves, pointing at Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun like they were mocking them.

The pair quickly became aware of this and could not help feeling embarrassed.

In their native Star Fields, they were undisputed masters, but after coming to the Star Boundary, they were now behaving like country bumpkins, it was indeed a bit shameful.

Senior Brother Kou, on the other hand, saw their reactions and frowned slightly, but he did not say much and simply focused on controlling the speed and direction of the small ship.

After flying for about half an hour, a mountain range came into view that had a dense cluster of buildings built around it. Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun knew that this was Blue Feather Sect’s headquarters right away. Regarding this Star Boundary Sect, the two were quite curious and could not help standing up from the deck to look around.

The next moment, the two shook on the spot.

As far as they could see, for many tens of thousands of kilometres, the mountains had palaces and pavilions dotting the landscape. Obviously, all of this belonged to Blue Feather Sect.

The Sect stood among the vast mountain range and had an incredibly rich World Energy aura floating about it. This kind of aura was extraordinary compared to any Star Field Sect. Even Yang Kai’s High Heaven Sect had no way to compare with this Blue Feather Sect, the two were simply of two different grades.
