Time flew by quickly.

In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed.

Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes and gradually stretched out his somewhat stiff body. A burst of popping sounds suddenly rang out and a seemingly endless pure energy burst forth from within him. His True Qi surged forth, bringing with it a wondrous and invigorating feeling.

True Element Boundary Fourth Stage!

These ten days of meditation along with the massive amount of pure energy he had obtained from Shan Qing Luo’s white silk chrysalis had allowed him in one fell swoop to break through.

Glancing around, Yang Kai saw the devilish woman lazily leaning against the wall directly opposite him. Her pair of beautiful eyes stared back at him with a complex look within them.

Yang Kai immediately jumped up in surprise, and his True Qi involuntarily circulated.

However, Shan Qing Luo simply laughed dryly, “If I wanted to kill you, you would have died long ago no matter how many lives you might have had.”

Yang Kai expression cramped up slightly, but thinking of how what she said was true, he relaxed immediately, laughing a bit wryly as he cupped his fists and said, “Thank you Elder Sister for not acting ruthlessly.”

Shan Qing Luo shook her head, “I never really wanted to kill you, capturing you was simply out of necessity.”

Between her words, she let out a hoarse cough, and her complexion became slightly pale.

“What happened to you?” Yang Kai frowned, feeling that this seductive woman now seemed much weaker than before, as if she had been seriously injured.

“Isn’t this all your doing!?” Shan Qing Luo grit her teeth as she glared miserably towards him.

“Me?” Yang Kai pointed to himself, his expression filled with confusion, unable to understand what she meant.

“What did you do to me?”

“I didn’t do anything.” Yang Kai responded somewhat dumbly.

“Then how did you siphon so much energy from me?” Shan Qing Luo ground her teeth in anger.

Yang Kai was stunned, thinking back on everything that had happened since he had been captured, wrinkling his brow as he said, “I fell into an illusion, encountered you, lay down with you, and then as we were together I started operating a certain Secret Art and shattered the illusion...”

Shan Qing Luo instantly blushed as she stared at him meaningfully, “With me?”

“En. You were extremely forward and bold.” Yang Kai nodded as he recalled Shan Qing Luo’s performance on the bed, unable to help to stop his blood from once again boiling up, “What a pity,” Yang Kai sighed, a depressed expression spread across his face.

“You little bastard!” Shan Qing Luo cursed lightly, her face now a bright crimson.

“Were you affected somehow?” Yang Kai frowned and asked.

“What do you think?” Shan Qing Luo’s breath quickened, her chest rose and fell so violently her proud peaks almost broke free from her red dress, “I was right on the cusp of breaking through when all of a sudden all of my energy was drained away by you... haha, would you call that not being affected?”

Yang Kai suddenly felt embarrassed and immediately apologized, “Is that so? I didn’t do it on purpose.”

“If you had, I would have killed you long ago.” Shan Qing Luo looked at him bitterly, “How could I have let you live until now?”

“Then did you manage to break through?” Yang Kai’s eyes flashed.

“No! Not only did I not break through, but I’ve also suffered a severe backlash from my Secret Art. I have no idea how long I’ll have to wait until my next opportunity to break through, and it’s all your fault!”

“How can you pin all the blame on me...” Yang Kai rubbed his nose, but upon hearing that her strength had suffered a massive hit, his demeanor suddenly became much more relaxed. Staring towards her with great meaning as he asked, “What is your current strength...”

“Equal to a True Element Boundary First Stage, are you satisfied now?” Shan Qing Luo snappily replied, a million kinds of anger filling her gaze.

“Haha! Oh really now!” Yang Kai laughed happily, his last trace of caution disappeared, and he completely relaxed his guard.

This seductive woman’s cultivation only being equivalent to a True Element Boundary First Stage meant her current strength was even lower than his own so he no longer had to worry so much about her.

Of course, although her current realm was lower than his, she was still an unparalleled master, so if they were really to fight, it was still uncertain who would ultimately win.

Fortunately, neither of them seemed to have any murderous intent at the moment, so there was no need to be overly tense.

“Haa... I can’t blame this all on you. If I hadn’t taken you captive, I never would have suffered this calamity! I brought this upon myself.” Shan Qing Luo quietly sighed.

Listening to her sincere admission, Yang Kai also felt some guilt and embarrassedly nodded, “Um... how should I say this... thank you for saving me back there.”

“So you do have some conscience you perverted brat.” Shan Qing Luo lightly laughed; it seems that this time’s failure had not caused any major impact to her confidence, her mood was not the slightest bit disturbed.

After chatting for a bit, Yang Kai suddenly stood up and said, “You take a rest, I’ll go find us something to eat.”

“Be careful out there...” Shan Qing Luo softly whispered.

Yang Kai looked back at her with astonishment, unsure of why this flirtatious woman was now suddenly so concerned about him, but he did not ponder long on this and quickly turned around and exited the cave.

After Yang Kai had left, Shan Qing Luo lightly sighed, an awkward expression filled her face as she placed her delicate white hands over her heart. Her face blushed a faint shade of pink, and she quickly asked herself, “This fluttering feeling within me... It couldn’t be...”

Shan Qing Luo had a special constitution which was related to her special cultivation technique. Although outwardly, she appeared flirtatious and seductive, for the rest of her life she would only be able to truly love one man, and she would only be able to truly be with him once.

Before then, the affection she would feel for him would continue to grow within her heart until the time was ripe and all she could think about was him; at that time, she would join herself with him.

And on that night, that man would die! At the same time, her Secret Art would reach the grand accomplishment stage.

Yang Kai’s previously presumptuous behaviour towards her, and more importantly his inadvertently entering into her Knowledge Sea, left behind a ray of his Divine Sense’s aura, which had subconsciously planted an unintended seed in her Soul.

It was a bud of love!

Her family line had an extremely sad and cruel fate, only having a single descendant per generation, and they were always women.

Every generation, these girls would experience this inhumane torture.

Shan Qing Luo had never forgotten her mother’s experience. Ever since she was born, all she could remember was how she had missed her father, the suffering and torment she constantly felt in her heart, and how she had ultimately died an unhappy death.

Because this feeling of love would only grow stronger the more time passed, leading her Secret Art to reach the grand accomplishment stage, Shan Qing Luo would have an intense and unforgettable passion engraved upon her soul.

One night together with her true love before he died at her hands!

What woman could accept this kind of fate?

And now, this ill fate had abruptly befallen her.

Biting her lip, Shan Qing Luo was at a loss, she had been caught completely by surprise and hadn’t had the slightest chance to prepare herself.

Originally, she had wanted to wait a few more years to find a suitable man to fall in love with, and then build a relationship with him. She had never expected to be thrust into this situation so suddenly and unexpectedly.

...

As a crackling sound burst out nearby and the scent of roasted meat wafted past her nose, Shan Qing Luo’s eyelashes fluttered slightly as she slowly opened her eyes.

Sitting a few meters in front of her was Yang Kai. He had raised a small fire and was carefully barbecuing some freshly caught game.

“You’re quite relaxed!” Yang Kai said with a light chuckled. When he had come back and discovered this young woman had actually fallen asleep, he couldn’t help being surprised.

“Why shouldn’t I relax, or were you planning on eating me too?” Shan Qing Luo smiled teasingly towards Yang Kai.

“Indeed! As long as you don’t mind.”

“I’m afraid you’re luck isn’t that good!” Shan Qing Luo laughed happily.

Soon after, the meat was fully cooked. Yang Kai tore off a piece and brought it over to Shan Qing Luo. Slowly tearing off a piece of the meat and delicately placing it into her mouth, she slowly and elegantly enjoyed her meal. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Kai, on the other hand, quickly stuffed his face with as much meat as he could fit.

“How savage...” Shan Qing Luo muttered as she glared at him.

However, Yang Kai just grinned meaningfully, continuing to scarf down his food while asking, “I’ve been meaning to ask you but, where is this place?”

“Do you not even know where you are?” Shan Qing Luo looked at him suspiciously. “Are you not a disciple of the Holy Land?”

“Holy Land? What is this ‘Holy Land’?” Yang Kai asked in confusion.

When they had first met, Shan Qing Luo had also asked him which Leader he was a disciple of. Now thinking about it, her question probably had some relationship with this Holy Land she spoke of.

Suddenly thinking of something, Yang Kai hastily asked, “Is this not the Great Han Dynasty?”

Shan Qing Luo suddenly burst out into laughter, “Are you really that foolish? Of course this is the Great Han Dynasty!”

Yang Kai let out a sigh, “I really am that confused. I came to this place completely by accident.”

Seeing that he did not seem to be lying to her, Shan Qing Luo seriously answered him, “This is the Grey Cloud Holy Land!”

“Grey Cloud Holy Land? The Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land!” Yang Kai was stunned, turning a shocked expression towards Shan Qing Luo.

“You really aren’t a disciple of the Holy Land!?” Shan Qing Luo’s beautiful face twisted somewhat, as she angrily shouted back, “What do you mean ‘Evil Land’, such an ugly name. What you call the devil’s path we call our way of life! We simply have a different way of thinking than your Great Families yet you see a need to divide the world up into such rigid ideologies, all that’s done is promote more conflict.”

“The Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land... Shan Qing Luo...” Yang Kai’s thoughts raced as she suddenly recalled something. Turning towards the seductive woman before him, his eyes tightly squinted, and he hesitantly asked, “Demon Queen Shan Qing Luo?”

The Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land had one Devil Lord and Six Great Evil Kings.

Thunderbolt Beast King, Tyrannical Force King, Profound Yin Ghost King, Beguiling Demon Queen, Lightning Flash Shadow King, Annihilating Poison King!

Because of the new Devil Lord’s rise and the special relationship he shared with him, Yang Kai had also learned as much as he could about the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land, including the names of the six Great Evil Kings.

And among the six Great Evil Kings, there was only one woman!

No doubt this Beguiling Demon Queen was none other than the Heavenly beauty Shan Qing Luo before him!

No wonder when he heard her name before it had been somewhat familiar.

Seeing Yang Kai so surprised, Shan Qing Luo couldn’t help giggling and leisurely said, “Indeed, it is this Queen! Why, are you frightened now?”

“Oh?” Yang Kai suddenly grinned and indifferently looked down at her, “Why should I be afraid? I was just caught off guard by the fact that the most seductive woman in the world was in front of me.”

Looking Shan Qing Luo up and down completely once more, Yang Kai couldn’t help but be amazed.

There were many rumors about just how enchanting the Beguiling Demon Queen was, and now that he had really met her, it seems that these rumors weren’t unfounded, but she truly was the very definition of seduction.

“Seen enough yet, you little bastard!?” Shan Qing Luo felt his aggressive fiery gaze sweep over every inch of her body and was extremely uncomfortable, so she flicked her wrist and tossed the piece of beast meat in her hand towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai hastily dodged, which caused her ‘attack’ to hit nothing but air, and grinned sheepishly before sitting down again and sunk into deep thought.

Apparently, when the void corridor had collapsed, he had actually been sent to the Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land. The distance between here and where Su Yan had been sent was extremely far, it was likely that he would not be able to reunite with her any time soon.

On top of that, since this was the Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land, there was no doubt a lot of Devil Path cultivators around. How was he supposed to leave here safely?

It seems he would have to take advantage of his newfound relationship with Shan Qing Luo. Using her identity and status it shouldn’t be difficult for him to leave the Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land.

Making up his mind, Yang Kai tore a piece of his barbecue and graciously handed it to the charming woman beside him.

Shan Qing Luo quickly turned her eyes away from his as she lightly muttered, “That thing is covered with your drool... I don’t want to eat it.”

“It’s not like my mouth has been over everything...” Yang Kai muttered, not trying to force her.

Shan Qing Luo’s breath suddenly became quicker, thinking back to when he had forced his lips onto hers, and she ground her teeth so hard they nearly broke.
