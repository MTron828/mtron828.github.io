When Yang Kai cast the seventh Shamanic Spell, the huge water giant burst apart. Yang Tai’s screams also came to a screeching halt and the turbulent sea regained its calm.

Yang Kai’s expression looked solemn as he released his Divine Sense and searched for Yang Tai.

But he found nothing. Yang Tai’s aura had disappeared without a trace in this Illusion Array and a short moment later, Yang Kai was surprised to find the Illusion Array’s Core. Yang Tai had escaped and was no longer here.

The truth was just as Yang Kai observed. At this moment, from a cloud of blue smoke, a figure suddenly appeared inside the rock cave. Yang Tai had emerged in a miserable state, doubled over and coughing violently, blood dripping from numerous wounds all over his body.

“Brother Yang, you… How…” Not far away, Gong Yue who was presiding over the Six Points One Centre Array was shocked to see Yang Tai’s condition, almost causing a fault to appear in the Spirit Array. Currently the Six Points One Centre Array had already been arranged, with Hua Yu Lu, Fang Zhuo, Wu Kuang Yi, and Chen Bing Ru all suspended mid-air with pale faces, set in special positions according to the array’s principles, seemingly having lost the power to resist. There was a small cut on each of their bodies as well that red blood was trickling out of, and under Gong Yue’s manipulations, this blood was all gathering towards the giant blood-coloured door.

The giant blood-colour door also seemed to have transformed into a bottomless pit. No matter how much blood was brought to it, it would devour all of it without leaving a single drop. Following the inflow of blood, the giant blood-coloured door began emitting a strange glow.

Gong Yue was a Second-Order Emperor, and his strength was not bad to begin with, so having caught his opponents off guard and with the help of numerous Array Plates, Hua Yu Lu and the others weren’t his opponents at all. In the time that Yang Kai and Yang Tai were locked in battle, all the others had been restrained and no longer had the power to fight back.

Gong Yue thought that Yang Tai wouldn’t need to use much effort to take down Yang Jiu, but when Yang Tai showed up in such a terrible state, he realized he was wrong.

[That Yang Jiu actually defeated Yang Tai inside the Illusion Array. He had such capability?]

“How is the progress?” Yang Tai ignored Gong Yue’s surprise and was also no longer as friendly as before. There was a look of impatience on his brows and at the moment, he acted just like a king standing high above others, questioning his subordinates.

Gong Yue frowned, “My side is fine, but with two fewer people, the speed of cracking the array is going to be very slow. I still need about an hour.”

When the trapped Hua Yu Lu and the others heard these words, their faces turned ashen.

Breaking the array with a blood sacrifice was not as simple as it seemed. Every time their blood was drawn away, they could feel excruciating pain as if their insides were being torn apart. The only reason they weren’t screaming was because they were under the restraint of this Spirit Array.

Hearing that this was going to last another hour, the four people were all feeling terrified and uneasy. If that were truly the case, then they may as well commit suicide so they wouldn’t have to suffer this way.

“An hour is too long!” Yang Tai shouted, turning back towards a cloud of blue smoke. Yang Jiu was trapped inside this fog bank, but he no longer dared to go in and fight him.

Honestly, Yang Jiu’s performance surprised Yang Tai, but he wasn’t too worried about him at first. Only after he began using those strange Secret Techniques did Yang Tai become terrified. It was as if he’d met his natural enemy, an existence he had even lost the courage to face.

“Use my blood!” Yang Tai took the initiative to step towards Hua Yu Lu and the others, occupying another position in the array in a flash. Then, with his finger as a knife, he cut a wound on his own wrist and blood immediately gushed out in a torrent.

“Brother Yang, you…” Gong Yue looked at Yang Tai in surprise. He had the instinctive idea that this man was not in the right state of mind at this moment.

This wasn’t anything like what they planned. Even though Yang Tai was supposed to be part of the Six Points One Centre Array, the most important sources for the blood sacrifice were supposed to be the other five. As long as they drained those five dry, it should be enough to break the array.

But things didn’t happen quite as they expected. Firstly, Yang Jiu was able to see through part of their scheme, resulting in some accidents. Now, they couldn’t even gather everyone to complete the array with, but Yang Tai actually decided not to be stingy with his own blood and asked to participate as well, as if vowing to break open the Spirit Array even if it cost him his life.

“What are you waiting for? Hurry up!” When he saw Gong Yue’s hesitation, Yang Tai couldn’t help but urge him on, his tone even seeming hostile.

Gong Yue frowned, “Brother Yang, what you said is truly behind this door, right?”

At this point, Gong Yue was even thinking of withdrawing, mainly because of how worrying Yang Tai’s performance was. He couldn’t help but wonder if this was all worth doing in the first place.

Yang Tai coldly snorted, “You also know how deep and profound that character is, so you must know its might. There are more characters like that behind that door. The greatest secrets of the Martial Dao are hidden there, and as long as the seal is broken, you can easily break through to the Third-Order Emperor Realm. When that time comes, who will dare to underestimate your Heavenly River Valley Gong Family? As for your Gong Family’s reputation, who will know what happened here if they’re all dead? This Old Master is on your side, so I will naturally not reveal what happened today.”

Gong Yue’s expression fluctuated several times before he finally made up his mind, “Good!”

The main reason he agreed to work with Yang Tai to deceive the others here was because of the power he had seen behind that ancient character. At his First-Order Emperor Realm cultivation, Yang Tai was able to exert the strength of a Second-Order Emperor, proving how astonishing the origins of that character were.

Even though the Gong Family was not a small force, they didn’t have a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master’s protection, so their status in the Southern Territory was a little awkward. Whenever the Gong Family was mentioned, anyone would think about Spirit Arrays, but nobody had any idea how much the Gong Family coveted great power, especially Gong Yue. He made the revitalization of the Gong Family his lifelong goal, but his Second-Order Emperor Realm cultivation was neither here nor there in terms of the hierarchy, so it was difficult for him to become the great trailblazer for his family.

Yang Tai assured him that he would be able to gain the secrets to advance into the Third-Order Emperor Realm after the Spirit Array was broken.

Interest aroused, Gong Yue joined hands with him.

Just as Yang Tai said, everyone here was going to die after the blood sacrifice, so who was going to know that the Gong Family’s former patriarch did something so despicable? So, the Gong Family’s reputation wouldn’t be affected.

At Yang Tai’s urging, the seals on Gong Yue’s hand changed. Yang Tai immediately let out a grunt as large amounts of blood began pouring out of the wound on his wrist like a fountain.

In order to ensure the Spirit Array could be broken faster, Gong Yue also increased the extraction of blood from the other four. All of a sudden, Hua Yu Lu and the others were all showing unbearable expressions of pain.

As blood flowed into it, the glow of the giant blood-coloured door became brighter and brighter.

Yang Tai lost a lot of blood, but he didn’t feel uncomfortable. Instead, he was exhilarated as he stared at the giant blood-coloured door without even moving his gaze for a moment.

It was at that instant that a noise suddenly sounded from the pale blue smoke, and Yang Kai’s figure appeared out of thin air.

Without Yang Tai hosting the array and with Gong Yue distracted with other matters, the Illusion Array created by the Array Plate was unable to withstand Yang Kai’s attacks. In just that short amount of time after Yang Tai escaped, Yang Kai was able to break free.

With a sweep of his Divine Sense, Yang Kai immediately understood the current situation.

Under Yang Tai’s panicked and fearful gaze, he waved the Myriads Sword in his hand, slashing down a shocking sword light that was aimed right at Gong Yue.

Gong Yue was the master of the Six Points One Centre Array, so the only way to stop it was to attack him.

Gong Yue was not surprised at all by this. Or rather, he had anticipated this situation ever since Yang Tai escaped from the Illusion Array. So, with a flick of his finger, another Array Plate was sent flying at Yang Kai.

As the former Patriarch of the Gong Family, and a Sect Master of a Spirit Array Sect, Gong Yue did not carry much on his body, but he did have quite a number of Array Plates at his disposal. Among these plates were Killing Arrays, Illusion Arrays, Trapping Arrays, etc.

The space was too narrow for Yang Kai to be able to dodge though, so despite having just escaped from one Spirit Array, he was quickly dragged into another.

When he saw this, Yang Tai cheered and laughed while the faces of Hua Yu Lu and the others paled even further.

They had no other hope now. Being restrained by the Six Points One Centre Array, they were unable to use their strength at all and even their freedom was under Gong Yue’s control. There was no way for them to break free with their own ability.

They could only put all their hopes on Yang Kai, but just as he showed them a glimmer of hope, they were let down again. Some expectation had just emerged, and it had all shattered immediately. They were done for now, they all thought.

“How long can you keep him trapped?” Yang Tai asked Gong Yue.

Gong Yue frowned, “Thirty breaths…”

Yang Tai seemed to be dissatisfied with this, but he knew too that there was no way around it. If Gong Yue were to host these Array Plates personally, then he should be able to trap Yang Jiu for a longer amount of time, but right now, Gong Yue didn’t have the spare hands to do so. Being able to trap Yang Jiu for thirty breaths of time with a masterless Spirit Array was already the limit.

Ten breaths later though, the Spirit Array suddenly shattered, and Yang Kai’s figure reappeared.

“What?” Gong Yue was shocked.

He had just announced that the Spirit Array could trap Yang Kai for thirty breaths of time, which was already an overestimation of the opponent’s strength, but it turned out that after just ten breaths of time, the array was broken. Just how powerful was this Yang Jiu?

“He’s back!” Yang Tai called out to remind Gong Yue to toss out another Array Plate.

After eating such a loss, Yang Kai was much more careful now. In a flash, he put some distance between Gong Yue and himself, shouting, “Old Patriarch Gong, regardless of whether or not you’re doing this willingly or were deceived, you must know one thing! Yang Tai has been corrupted by Demon Qi and underwent demonification! Your acts now are akin to assisting a tyrant to oppress the innocent. This will not bring any kind of glory to your Gong Family. It’s not too late for you to stop now!”

“You smelly brat, what sort of nonsense are you spouting? When did this Old Master become demonified?” Yang Tai retorted, and as he was worrying that Gong Yue would be affected by these slanderous lies, he also quickly urged, “Brother Gong, don’t listen to him! The most important thing is to take him down as soon as possible!”

Yang Kai’s body suddenly disappeared in a flash before his voice began sounding from all directions, “Ancient Demons are sealed behind that giant blood-coloured door. Yang Tai intends to let them out. You may not know how terrifying the Demon Race is, but you definitely won’t want to know. Gong Yue, are you sure you want to be this sinner’s accomplice?”

“This Ancient Cave Mansion has been around for at least tens of thousands of years, if not hundreds of thousands. How could any Demon be sealed inside? This brat is lying! Not to mention that even if Demons were sealed here, they would have died long ago! Brother Gong, the ultimate secret of the Martial Dao lies behind that door. Don’t believe that little brat. Open the door, then you and I can share in the benefits!”
