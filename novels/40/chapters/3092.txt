The Starship stopped somewhere in the Starry Sky. It would still take them half a day to reach Taiyi Star. After the cabin door opened, Yang Kai cupped his fists and said to Lu Huai Shuang, “Miss Lu, farewell.”

“Sir, farewell. Please stay safe.” Lu Huai Shuang performed a salute to him in an elegant manner. The top cultivators from the Lu Family behind her cupped their fists to bid Yang Kai farewell as well. She didn’t make him stay nor tell him they would meet again, because she knew that the reason he chose to part ways with her here was that he didn’t want to drag the Lu Family into this mess.

Taiyi Star was the Yan Family’s base, so the forces they commanded on the Star were vast with countless informants lurking in every corner. Yang Kai’s visit this time would surely turn into a conflict with them, and if the Yan Family looked into the matter, they would find out that he came to this Star with the Lu Family. By then, the Lu Family would be implicated.

Both Lu Huai Shuang and Yang Kai understood this. With this thought in mind, she heaved a sigh secretly. If it weren’t because she had to protect her family, she was more than willing to deliver him to that place directly. Their destination was the same anyway.

However, she had a huge family behind her, so she had to be careful in everything she did. Therefore, she was grateful that he was sensitive and considerate. If he insisted on reaching the destination with the Lu Family’s people, she couldn’t possibly reject him.

Instead, he decided to make the Starship stop when they were still some distance away from Taiyi Star to make a clean break with them. After the departure, they might not even meet again in the future.

Certainly, she hoped to see him again in the future. By then, she would stand before him with a higher cultivation realm.

Yang Kai turned his head and hinted at He Yun Xiang, who immediately summoned her own Star Shuttle. After they stepped on it together, the shuttle transformed into a beam of light and shot towards the Star Field.

Star Shuttles were a commonly used flight type artifact in the Star Field. Yang Kai had used one himself back when he was in Heng Luo Star Field; however, they were no longer useful after he entered Star Boundary.

He Yun Xiang’s Star Shuttle was an Origin King Grade artifact, but although its speed was quite fast, it still took them more than half a day to reach the periphery of Taiyi Star.

It was a huge azure sphere that looked like a giant eye in this boundless Star Field. It radiated a mesmerizing glow and was encircled by a layer of faint aura mist.

Yang Kai knew that it was the World Energy of Taiyi Star.

This Yan Family’s base indeed lived up to its name. Taiyi Star was one of the best Cultivation Stars Yang Kai had ever seen. In the entire Heng Luo Star Field, only Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce’s Home Star, Water Moon Star, was comparable to it.

“Sir, should we go directly to the Yan Residence?” He Yun Xiang asked as she controlled her Star Shuttle.

Yang Kai was standing right behind her, and despite him not using any energy, his figure was as stable as a mountain. No matter how fast the shuttle was, he remained unmoving, as though roots had grown beneath his feet.

“Yes, go there directly.”

“Good.” He Yun Xiang nodded as she was moved by his confidence.

Yang Kai was someone in a realm that was above the Origin King Realm, so he was practically unrivalled in this Star Field; therefore, the Yan Family was certainly no match for him. If the Yan Family’s people caved into him and told him the way to enter the Ancestral Domain, then it was all good. However, if they were obstinate, He Yun Xiang could already envision the kind of calamity this mighty family in Unending Star Field would suffer.

They had only met each other a short time ago, so she still didn’t understand Yang Kai’s temperament or personality well. However, she could feel that the Master she had sided with was an easy-going man. He wasn’t someone who would oppress the weak with his power.

This was the kind of demeanour a Master should have. Those who loved to oppress and make others submit to them were usually diffident about themselves.

So, the best way to communicate with someone like Yang Kai was to be totally honest with him. One might even get some rewards in return.

[Hopefully, the Yan Family will know what to do.]

He Yun Xiang had been to Taiyi Star several times before; after all, this was the best Cultivation Star in this Star Field. Although she was the Head Manager of the Fierce Gale Pirates that everyone despised, no one had seen her real face before, so to enter Taiyi Star safely, she just needed to revert back to her original appearance.

Hence, she was already familiar with the route to get into Taiyi Star. After circling around the Star in the opposite direction for a moment, she flew the shuttle towards the surface.

After they passed through a layer of clouds, the view of the ground came into sight.

“It seems that we’ve come to a remote area.” He Yun Xiang appeared slightly embarrassed as she observed the surroundings.

“It’s alright.”

After they continued flying in the air for four hours, a massive city finally came into their sight.

“That’s the Yan Family’s base.”

When they were about to reach the city, they landed on the ground and walked forward. Any sizable city wouldn’t allow any cultivator to fly into it directly because it would make it hard for them to manage the city. Only some people with special status were allowed to do that.

Yang Kai was already used to such customs, so he was fine with it.

The city wall was more than a hundred metres tall and its gates were wide open. A hideous head that looked like a ferocious ghost was hung below the gate, its eyes gleaming with a crimson glow. Its wide open mouth was the entrance to the city. All the cultivators who entered the city seemed to have been swallowed by this ferocious ghost as they disappeared into its mouth.

Whenever a cultivator passed through, the ghost’s crimson eyes would glint, as though it was examining something.

Many cultivators were waiting at the gate. He Yun Xiang asked for Yang Kai’s opinion and then lined up at the back of the line with him.

An incense stick later, it was their turn to enter the city. Yang Kai suddenly felt a stream of energy sweeping over his body, which felt like he had been inspected by Divine Sense, but he knew that it was something different. At that instant, he realized that it was the Secret Technique embedded in the ghost sculpture’s eyes. It didn’t have any ill intention as it was just making a record.

It was already the middle of the night, but the city was still hustling and bustling, as though it was a living creature. All the households in the city still had their lights on. Even the narrowest alley was illuminated by the lights around it.

Countless cultivators streamed along the streets and rubbed shoulders with each other.

The streets were designed in an intricate manner, and every street was lined with two rows of shops, so the city appeared very lively. All the shops came in different shapes as well. Some of them appeared exotic and pleasing to the eyes. There was also a tower with several dozen floors that looked like a huge pillar in this bustling city.

In the middle of the city was a mountain with two summits. It was so high that it almost reached the clouds. The two summits were perfectly symmetrical, as though they were made from the same mould. Yang Kai raised his head and saw that many buildings had been built from the bottom through to the top of the mountain like a ladder. The lights over there were especially bright. The rows of palaces appeared imposing and magnificent.

“That’s where the Yan Family’s clansmen live. Besides the Masters that have been stationed in other places, all Yan Family members live there,” He Yun Xiang pointed at the mountain and explained. A moment later, she asked, “Sir, are you going there now or…”

“I was just looking around. Let’s go there now.” Yang Kai replied.

“Sir, this way please,” He Yun Xiang uttered and led the way.

Although the city was massive, He Yun Xiang could walk around pretty quickly, as she was in the Third-Order Origin King Realm. On the other hand, Yang Kai didn’t exude an aura, but his movements were still remarkably quick.

Two hours later, they reached the bottom of the double summit.

“Outsiders are not allowed past this point. This is where those from the Yan Family live.”

There was a guard who was responsible for blocking outsiders from entering the compound. The guard was in the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, which was just a step away from the Origin King Realm. He could already be considered a Master in this Star Field, but in this Yan Family base, he could only serve as a guard, which went to show how firm and robust the Yan Family’s heritage was.

Although his tone sounded polite, his expression appeared aloof. The way he swept a glance over Yang Kai was slightly disdainful because he didn’t sense any energy fluctuations coming from him, so he thought that the latter was just an ordinary person.

Nevertheless, he was startled at He Yun Xiang’s Origin King aura. Although he couldn’t determine her cultivation accurately, he was certain that she was in the Origin King Realm. Moreover, she was beautiful and charming, so he immediately started having licentious thoughts about her.

A strikingly beautiful Origin King Realm Master like her was rare.

If he were in the outside world, given his cultivation, he would not dare to size up an Origin King so wantonly. Nevertheless, he was now standing outside the Yan Residence, and he was also a Yan Family disciple, so although he was in a lower realm than her, he still brazenly swept his eyes over her figure and admired her beauty. He thought that if he could sleep with such a woman for one night, he would have no more regrets even if he had to die.

The other Yan Family’s guards around the place also looked at her and drooled over her body.

He Yun Xiang’s face fell when she saw that. She was now a Third-Order Origin King, one of the few peak level masters in this Star Field. So what if they were from the Yan Family? Weaker cultivators should show due respect to a Master like her.

If she had come here on her own, she would’ve swallowed her anger; however, she was now under Yang Kai’s wing, so her actions would affect his reputation, which was why she couldn’t tolerate their presumptuous behaviour.

As such, she swiftly released her Third-Order Origin King aura, causing the Yan Family’s guard, who had been ogling her, to turn pale. After he staggered backwards more than ten steps, he barely managed to stop himself from falling on his butt. With his hand pressed against his chest, he was still reeling from the shock as for a moment, he felt as though he was about to leave for the other world.

That was an Origin King’s pressure! Moreover, it wasn’t just any ordinary Origin King Realm Pressure. The guard reckoned that this beautiful woman must at least be a Second-Order Origin King.

A myriad of expressions came over him as he gritted his teeth and choked down his displeasure. Although he was a Yan Family disciple, this woman’s cultivation was shockingly powerful. The Yan Family wouldn’t choose to offend such a Master over such a trivial matter.

No longer daring to be arrogant, he cupped his fists with a solemn expression, “Madam, may I know your name and what you are here for?”

He was starkly different from his earlier haughty self.

He Yun Xiang uttered dispassionately, “I’m here to see the Yan Family’s Patriarch. Please inform him of my visit.”

“You want to see the Patriarch?” The guard was shocked as he shook his head, “I’m afraid I cannot help you with this.”

The Yan Family’s Patriarch was the Overlord of this Star Field, so not just anyone had the right to meet him. Although the woman before the guard’s eyes was an Origin King, there was a vast difference in strength and status between Origin Kings. She might not necessarily be worthy of meeting their Patriarch.

“I just want to visit Patriarch Yan. Please lend us a hand.”

The person shook his head again, “It’s not that I’m not willing to help, but…” He paused for a moment, “Madam, have you met our Patriarch before?”

If they were old acquaintances, then there wouldn’t be a problem. He would be more than willing to inform the Patriarch about it. Maybe this charming woman was the Patriarch’s mistress in the outside world.

“I’ve always admired him, but I haven’t had the chance to meet him before.”

“Then…”

“Please…” As He Yun Xiang spoke, she flicked a Space Ring towards the guard.
