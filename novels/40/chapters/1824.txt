“Bastard, I will kill you!” Mu Wu scowled and shouted in anger. A pulse of Saint Qi spread around him as he released his Origin King Realm Domain, pushing it towards Yang Kai. At the same time, he left a streak of light as he appeared right above Yang Kai’s head.

He was well aware of how strong the people of Shrouded Heaven Mansion were. Naturally, his son couldn’t be killed by them, no matter what. The only way he would die was that his cultivation was suppressed by the kid before him; he was the man behind his son’s brutal killing.

Mu Wo simply couldn’t let his son’s killer live, he would either destroy him or die trying! Even if the sect master feared Yang Kai, he could not stand the sight of him!

He clapped his hands and pushed them forward as a pulse of energy shot out from his hands and transformed into a cross-cut visible to the naked eyes, pressing down on Yang Kai like an unstoppable avalanche. It seemed as if it would split Yang Kai into two.

“That’s it!?” Yang Kai spat disdainfully as a look of disdain appeared on his face.

He could already tell Mu Wu’s next course of action just by looking at his body movements. Mu Wu might be a First-Order Origin King, but his real combat power was worse than any Origin King Realm expert Yang Hai had encountered.

This gap was mainly in the refinement of Saint Qi as well as the power of his Domain.

And it shouldn’t be that surprising, as the Spirit Devouring Sect cultivators mainly depended on refining and absorbing the Spirit Devouring Crystals for cultivation, it was just a shortcut. Unfortunately, there was no shortcut for cultivating Martial Dao. The price of their rapid growth was an unstable foundation.

The cultivators of Spirit Devouring Sect might be able to cultivate to the Second-Order or even Third-Order Origin King Realm with the help of Spirit Devouring Crystals, but their real combat power was definitely much lower than the cultivators of the same level.

The same was true for Mu Wu, his Saint Qi was heterogeneous and his Domain wasn’t perfect either.

The cross energy slash might appear to have unparalleled momentum but to Yang Kai, it was full of flaws.

The next moment, he bent his waist and took a horse stance as he sent a punch to greet the oncoming attack.

A streak of fist energy swished through the air, hitting right at the centre of the cross energy slash.

CRACK... A feeble and crisp sound immediately rang in Mu Wu’s ear, shaking him up. His eyes almost popped out in shock as a look of horror took over his face.

Much to his shock and dismay, his Domain was shattered by the opposite party’s punch, and the same could be said for his cross energy slash; it was extremely weak and fragile.

[So strong!] Mu Wu immediately came to realize that he was not Yang Kai’s opponent.

Just as this thought flashed in his mind, the streaking fist energy smashed through all his barriers, hitting him hard in the chest.

Puff... Mu Wu was immediately sent flying, spurting a mouthful of blood.

“What!?”

“Sect Master actually...”

“Impossible! My eyes must be playing tricks!”

The Origin Returning Realm masters of the Spirit Devouring Sect immediately cried in surprise. They turned pale. They immediately rubbed their eyes in succession, wondering whether they were seeing correctly.

An Origin King Realm master had always been synonymous with a top expert of the Star Field. But to their shock, their Sect Master, an Origin King Realm expert, was sent flying at the very start of the confrontation with this young man. They could hardly accept this fact.

Mu Wu too was shuddering in his heart. Just one punch had cooled him down. He immediately started thinking of escaping the very moment he came to realize that he wasn’t Yang Kai’s opponent.

However... a flash of white light suddenly blinded his eyes as the source of his terror appeared before him out of nowhere, standing nose to nose with him.

“Demon Eye!” Yang Kai gently uttered two words as his left pupil constricted in the next moment, turning into a long and narrow vertical pupil. Immediately after, a dazzling golden glow filled with majesty bloomed from the long vertical pupil.

Mu Wu lost consciousness at that moment. In his mind, all he could see was a terrifying eye hovering in the sky, gazing down at him coldly. He didn’t dare to make a rash move. Even his Soul was shaken up.

And Yang Kai, taking advantage of his loss of consciousness, made his move.

He promptly punched right into Mu Wu’s Dantian, pouring his surging Saint Qi into Mu Wu’s body. His Saint Qi coursed through Mu Wu’s meridians and body and destroyed his meridians in an instant, as if he was stabbed by a thousand swords.

The Origin King Realm aura around Mu Wu instantly started weakening.

In just three breaths, the Spirit Devouring Sect Master’s cultivation was abolished by Yang Kai.

Bam... Mu Wu crashed straight into a ground and lay still on the ground like a dead fish.

The few Origin Returning Realm cultivators of the Spirit Devouring Sect in the depths of the core gulped a mouthful of saliva. Everything happened just too fast. It was so fast that their Sect Mast was crippled before they even had the chance to react.

Now that they realized their own situation, all of their faces turned ugly. They looked at Yang Kai standing by Mu Wu as if they were looking at a demon. Their faces were filled with shock and horror.

[If this young man can cripple Sect Master in three breaths then killing us would be a matter of lifting his finger.]

The Demon Eye of Annihilation in Yang Kai’s left eye was still active. Next, Yang Kai bent over and lifted Mu Wu, raised him to his eye level and stared straight into his eyes. His Divine Sense surged as he spoke in a deep and reverberating voice, “If you don’t want to die, tell me the method to arrange the Spirit Devouring Array?”

Even though Yang Kai had seen the Hexagonal Array, he couldn’t find out anything. He wasn’t that proficient in Spirit Arrays. Therefore, if he wanted to know how to arrange it, he had to start with Mu Wu.

Mu Wu was the Sect Master of the Spirit Devouring Sect. It was well within reason that he knew the method to arrange the Spirit Array.

How could Mu Wu, whose cultivation was completely abolished, be able to resist the might of Demon Eye of Annihilation? Under the suppression of Yang Kai’s Divine Sense, a lifeless look immediately appeared in his eyes as he blurted out subconsciously, “The Spirit Devouring Array was given to my Mu Family by that Sir, and Sir said that I can’t tell anyone about it!”

“Sir!?” Yang Kai furrowed his brow; he was a little surprised. All he wanted was to understand the working principle of the Spirit Devouring Array from Mu Wu and let Yang Yan study it to see if it could be improved after he returned to Shadowed Star. But how could he have known that it would involve some mysterious ‘Sir’?

[It seems to be a very big secret...] Yang Kai thought to himself.

Suddenly, he had a very bad feeling.

Right then, a glimmer of intelligent gleam flickered in Mu Wu’s lifeless eyes as he shouted aloud, “Sir, save me!”

Yang Kai’s expression immediately changed. Just as he was about to withdraw, a bright beam of light shot out of Mu Wu’s eyes, shooting straight towards Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea.

“Damn it!” Yang Kai was shocked. He flung Mu Wu away and closed his eyes as his Soul Avatar manifested in his Knowledge Sea.

Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea appeared quite calm but Yang Kai immediately noticed a ball of unusual energy.

That ball of energy was floating in his Knowledge Sea, twisting and changing. Yang Kai felt a completely strange aura from that energy. This aura definitely didn’t belong to Mu Wu.

The energy wasn’t that strong but Yang Kai felt a huge threat from it.

“Soul Warming Lotus! You actually have a Soul Warming Lotus!” A husky scream suddenly reverberated from that ball of energy. Judging by the voice, Yang Kai could tell that it belonged to a man but he couldn’t tell the opposite party’s age. In the next moment, that ball of energy transformed into a man wearing Changshan.

(Ash: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changshan)

His face appeared blurry and Yang Kai couldn’t see it clearly.

At this moment, the man’s attention was completely occupied by the seven colours island in Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea. There was a vague crazy look in his eyes.

“Hahaha, you have already evolved it into Seven Colored Soul Warming Lotus, just a one step away from the Supreme Soul Warming Lotus. What a surprise! What a pleasant surprise! Who would have thought that there would be such a precious heaven and earth treasure in this Star Field! It looks like that this King didn’t waste his Yuan Qi by coming here, it was well worth it!”

That person didn’t seem to care about Yang Kai at all. His eyes were completely glued on the Soul Warming Lotus; he was very excited.

His figure jolted again as he stared blankly at the sky above the Knowledge Sea. An even crazier look flickered in his eyes as he shouted in excitement, “Star Chart, it’s actually the Star Chart of this Star Field. Hahaha, I have really been wearing out the iron shoes just to find it in my backyard. Lady Luck is on my side! Lady Luck is on my side! Hahaha!”

“Your Excellency, who are you? You are not Mu Wu!?” Yang Kai glared at him coldly. Although this guy was giving Yang Kai a feeling of threat, they were in the world of his Knowledge Sea. He was the master of this world. Therefore, he wasn’t that afraid.

That man, on the other hand, just glanced at Yang Kai indifferently before his gaze turned colder.

Under this gaze, Yang Kai felt like an ant being stared at by a giant dragon, as if he was just an insignificant being in this man’s eyes.

Yang Kai was completely shaken up!

Yang Kai’s Martial Dao Will was extremely firm and resilient. All the enemies he had faced along his journey were far stronger than him. He was currently an Origin King Realm cultivator. Even a Third-Order Origin King couldn’t give him a feeling of inferiority.

[But this man...]

Yang Kai composed himself, dispelling the feeling of inferiority in his heart before speaking in a cold voice, “Your Excellency must be that Sir mentioned by Mu Wu.”

The opposite party raised his brow as he said with a shadow of a smile lingering on his face, “Kid, this King is surprised to see a talented young kid like you in this Star Field, who not only has good cultivation but also good disposition at such a young age. Kid, you will surely become a great tool in time. Yes, this King is that Sir mentioned by Mu Wu.”

“So to say, you attached a ray of your Divine Sense to Mu Wu to prevent Mu Wu from revealing the secret of Spirit Devouring Array. Once he wants to tell the secret, you will show up to stop him, am I right!?”

“What a smart lad, you are worth teaching!”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. Yang Kai had some inkling of an idea about this man’s origin from the man’s self-talk and the brief conversation with him. After a while, he suddenly raised his head and asked with a smile, “Can I ask you a question Sir, have you heard of someone called... Insect Emperor?”

The man’s figure suddenly quivered upon hearing these words. A look of surprise appeared in his eyes as he cried in surprise, “A trivial ant like you actually know the existence of Sir Insect Emperor!? It seems there is more to you than meets the eyes!”

“Hehe, I understand, you too are from that place!”

“So you know about the Star Boundary!?” That man gazed at Yang Kai with even more surprise and disbelief. “Who are you?”

He finally looked squarely at Yang Kai.

“So that place is called Star Boundary...” Yang Kai appeared to have been struck with a realization. At the same time, a look of yearning appeared on his face.

“You don’t know!?” The figure frowned. He couldn’t figure out why Yang Kai knew about the Insect Emperor but had never heard of the Star Boundary. He suddenly grew a little upset by the fact that he was disturbed by Yang Kai. He flung his hand and threatened, “Kid, I don’t care where you have heard about Sir Insect Emperor but since you saw this King, I can’t let you go! This King gives you two choices: either die or surrender to this King. If you offer the Soul Warming Lotus with both your hands, this King might just consider letting you live.”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com
