Moreover, it should be Lu Huai Shuang’s room, which was the best room on this Starship.

Most women would avoid getting too intimate with a man. Normally, no matter how much a woman respected her guest, she couldn’t let him stay in her room as that would undoubtedly draw criticism.

However, given Yang Kai’s strength, he was more than just a guest. Lu Huai Shuang thought that she could only show enough respect for him by letting him stay in her room. Even though he had molested her before, she wouldn’t dare to grow resentful of him.

Sheng Yao shot her a meaningful glance with a faint smile on his face.

Seeing that, Lu Huai Shuang started blushing. She didn’t have any ulterior motives when she decided to let Yang Kai stay in her room; however, it was still embarrassing for her to do so, especially when this man was just around her age. In a gentle voice, she asked, “Senior, are you fine with this room? If you don’t like it, I can prepare you a different one.”

“No, this is good enough.” Yang Kai nodded as he didn’t find anything inappropriate about it. It was just a resting place for him, so it didn’t matter whether or not it was a woman’s room.

“I’m glad you like it.” For some reason, Lu Huai Shuang heaved a sigh of relief, as her expectation was becoming reality. Shocked by this thought, she hurriedly said, “Senior, please rest for now. I must attend to other matters now but will return as soon as they are completed.”

“Good,” Yang Kai waved his hand.

It was only then that Lu Huai Shuang turned around and left. Before she did so though, she shot a glance at Sheng Yao, as she didn’t like this unwelcome guest. However, he had claimed to be in Yang Kai’s service now, so it was inappropriate for her to chase him away, which was why she only shot him a glare as a warning.

After the door was closed, Yang Kai walked around the room as he picked up a number of things and then put them down repeatedly, as though he was curious about everything in this room.

On the other hand, Sheng Yao followed him around like a tail.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai turned around, which almost caused Sheng Yao to crash into him. Sheng Yao immediately stepped aside and looked at him with an apprehensive expression, only to see that Yang Kai was staring back at him with a grin, “Are you going to follow me into the bath as well?”

The corners of Sheng Yao’s eyes twitched as he lowered his head, “I wouldn’t dare. I’ll leave now. Please just call if you need anything. I’ll be waiting outside the room.”

Upon finishing his words, he dashed out of the room and closed the door, then he waited respectfully outside. All of a sudden, he put on a helpless smile.

Sheng Yao had always thought that his disguise was perfect, as even his sworn Brothers in the Fierce Gale Pirates, who had drunk wine and had fun with women with him over the years, had never been able to see through him. However, he knew that his disguise was useless in front of Yang Kai.

Yang Kai had probably seen through him in a single glance, but he just didn’t bother to point it out.

Then, Sheng Yao recalled what Yang Kai had done to Lu Huai Shuang earlier. As he thought about his own wish, a glint of determination flashed across his eyes. Then, he nodded and performed a hand seal, upon which his body went through a huge transformation.

Yang Kai had taken off his clothes and was leaning against the bathtub. With his arms spread on the edges, he appeared relaxed. His muscles were well-built and balanced. If any woman saw him in his naked state, they would probably scream in surprise.

He was in a Lower Star Field now, and although he had come to the Unending Star Field, which was an unfamiliar place to him, he had reached his goal at the very least.

When he was founding High Heaven Palace, he thought to himself that he would bring his friends and relatives on Shadowed Star over to the Star Boundary one day. Although he had been trying hard to increase his cultivation over the years, he hadn’t had a chance or managed to find a way to return to his native Star Field.

Nevertheless, he had a chance now. Although he was now in Unending Star Field, it didn’t mean that he had no chance to return to Heng Luo Star Field. He knew that all Star Fields were separate from each other, but some Star Fields were interconnected. Maybe there were some ways or routes to travel to other Star Fields from this Unending Star Field.

Thus, he made up his mind. His primary goal was to return to Heng Luo Star Field, while his secondary goal was to find out Wu Kuang’s whereabouts. He had a feeling that Wu Kuang might be in Unending Star Field as well, and if that was the case, he could try to look for him. Wu Kuang was an old monster with vast experience, so he must know how to travel between Star Fields.

After Yang Kai was done with the bath, he put on his clothes and combed his hair. Then, he summoned his Sealed World Bead. Bracing himself, he cautiously circulated his Emperor Qi and entered the Small Sealed World.

Inside a quaint house in the Small Sealed World, Liu Yan, who was in a lotus position, opened her eyes suddenly and left the house. At the same time, the Embodiment showed up as well. Upon trading glances, they knew what was on each other’s minds.

Li Jiao, Lu San Niang and her daughter were having a good laugh when they saw them. Li Jiao couldn’t help but ask, “Sister Liu Yan, what’s happening?”

“Master is coming,” Liu Yan’s gaze brightened as she looked in a particular direction.

Upon hearing that, Li Jiao was startled for a moment before he looked in the same direction with a surprised gaze.

On the other side, Yang Kai appeared elusive, but he soon reached the house and flashed a smile at them, “It seems all of you are here.”

Liu Yan was standing there as she spread her arms at him.

Yang Kai shot her a stare, “What are you doing?”

“I want a hug!”

Yang Kai uttered, “Are you kidding me? Your age seems to have grown in reverse.” Upon finishing his words though, he still walked up to her and lifted her off her feet, as though he was carrying a baby.

Sitting on his arm, Liu Yan appeared satisfied as her hair hung loose on her shoulders. Previously, she hadn’t seen Yang Kai for a long time as she had been cultivating on Spirit Beast Island. When she finally met Yang Kai on Dragon Island, she didn’t have the chance to spend some quality time with him. Now that her wish had been granted, she fiddled with his ear with both hands in a presumptuous manner, as though she had just obtained a new toy.

Yang Kai kept shaking his head, but she was relentless, so he had no choice but to give in to her in the end.

“Brother Yang.” Li Jiao bowed to him, “I’ll never forget what you’ve done for me. If you need any help in the future, just ask, I’ll never reject.”

Lu San Niang approached them as well and bowed deeply, “Brother Yang, many thanks for helping obtain justice for me.” As she spoke, her eyes turned moist.

Lu Yu Qin hurriedly uttered, “Many thanks, Uncle Yang.”

She had never been fond of her Dragon Father. During this period of time, she had heard a lot from her mother about what happened in the past. In her eyes, Li Jiao was her father, while Fu Chi was the evilest person in the world.

Yang Kai reached out his hands and helped them up before replying, “It was Brother Li, not me, who got your revenge for you, so you don’t have to thank me.”

Embarrassed, Li Jiao added, “I wasn’t powerful enough for that. If you didn’t help me, I wouldn’t have stood a chance to retaliate against Fu Chi.”

Although he wasn’t the one who killed Fu Chi in the end, he had contributed significantly to his death. However, if it weren’t because Yang Kai had gotten the Blessing from the Dragon Temple for him prior to that, he wouldn’t have even had a chance to stand before Fu Chi.

Taking that into consideration, he was eternally grateful to Yang Kai. He was able to get the fury off his chest for what had happened on Dragon Island, and he could look forward to the future now. In fact, he had made up his mind that after he returned to Fire Dragon Palace, he would treat Lu San Niang and her daughter, as well as his other women much better.

After a casual chat, the Embodiment suddenly asked, “Have you come across any trouble?”

He was Yang Kai’s Soul Clone in the body of a Stone Spirit, so he could share Yang Kai’s memories if he wanted to, which was why he could sense that something was troubling him.

“En, you’re right.” Yang Kai nodded and spoke, “Have a seat first.”

Then, he waved his hand, upon which some wooden chairs and a table flew out of the house. These things were crafted by those from the Tong Xuan Realm who had left them here. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

After they were all seated, Yang Kai moved his arms to seat Liu Yan in the chair beside him, but she wouldn’t agree to it. Left with no choice, he put her on his lap and draped one arm around her.

In just a short while, Yang Kai filled them in on what happened in the Dragon Temple. All of them were stunned upon learning that Wu Kuang had fled from the place by breaking through the Void and descending to a Lower Star Field.

Nevertheless, they were more shocked by the fact that Yang Kai had chased after him to an unfamiliar Star Field, Unending Star Field.

“The thing is…” Yang Kai put on a solemn expression, “Every Lower Star Field has its own World Principles that will repel any being that is stronger than an Origin King. So, besides Yu Qin, all of you can’t walk around safely outside of here. If you go out, you’ll be repelled by the Heavenly Way.”

Liu Yan asked, “What about you, Master?”

Yang Kai was in the Emperor Realm, and since Lower Star Fields would even repel people in the Dao Source Realm, nothing needed to be said about someone in an even higher realm.

“I was repelled as well.” Yang Kai rubbed his nose, “Before I came to this Star Field, I tried my best to suppress my own cultivation and aura; however, after I entered this place, I was still struck by Heavenly Lightning.”

The Heavenly Lightning was how World Principles repelled him. Fortunately, he had suppressed half of his cultivation already. Otherwise, the punishment would have been more severe. Although it was just a Lower Star Field, the power of World Principles could never be underestimated. If he was constantly targeted by the Heavenly Way, he couldn’t possibly stay safe in this Star Field.

“I… also stumbled.”

*Pu…* Liu Yan burst into a fit of giggles, as it was hard to imagine how a First-Order Emperor Realm Master would stumble. The others could barely suppress their laughter as well.

Yang Kai reached out to knock on her forehead, upon which she hurriedly covered her head and pouted.

“So, Brother Li, Sister San Niang, both of you should stay here for now as we can’t return to the Star Boundary for a while. Don’t worry. After I finish handling my own matters, I’ll bring you all back.”

Li Jiao nodded and replied, “It’s fine. Since you’re able to come, I’m sure you can leave this place as well. Is there anything we can help with? Given your cultivation, it’s impossible that you’ll come across any dangers in a Lower Star Field; however, since there are so many of us here, we can probably lend you a hand.”

Yang Kai said with a smile, “If you want to help me, then suppress your cultivation first.”

“Alright.” Li Jiao nodded.

“I want to help as well!” Liu Yan uttered.

“Good.”

In response, Liu Yan flashed a sweet smile at him.

Yang Kai had a feeling that she had changed a lot since their reunion.

…

“Where’s Lu An?” In another room, after Lu Huai Shuang was done with her chores, she asked Lu Bing this question.

Noticing the coldness in her voice, Lu Bing was shocked as he asked doubtfully, “What’s wrong with him?”

Lu Huai Shuang replied, “He was the one who revealed our location to the Fierce Gale Pirates and those He Family bastards.”
