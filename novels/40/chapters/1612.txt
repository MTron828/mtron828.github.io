Luo Hai already regarded the Origin Essence Crystal as something in his pocket!

However, he had the capital to back up such self-confidence as he was the Star Master of Green Mountains Star. As long as Yang Kai was still on Green Mountains Star, he could never escape his control.

When the time came, all he had to do was find this boy and ask him to hand over the Origin Essence Crystal; afterwards, he would give him some benefits and everyone would be satisfied.

If this boy wanted, Luo Hai was even prepared to accept him as a disciple!

This was the greatest honour and opportunity that one asked for.

Luo Hai had not been so excited in many years and was almost unable to keep up appearances! If not for him worrying about the other Origin Kings inside the stone pavilion seeing some kind of flaw, he would have already burst into laughter.

“Sir Luo Hai, the Blood Prison will close in ten days, right?” The old woman surnamed Lei suddenly asked.

“En,” Luo Hai nodded, “There is only ten days left, after which, the Domain inside the Blood Prison will erupt and force those little fellows out.”

“Haha, I wonder what kind of gains they’ll have this time. By the way, is that little Second-Order Origin Realm boy safe and sound?”

When Yang Kai was asked about, everyone opened their eyes and looked at Luo Hai, apparently quite concerned with the former’s condition.

“There’s no problem, this King can sense he’s still alive. You don’t have to worry about his safety.”

“Great, as long as he can walk out alive, this old lady will invite him to join Sword Union immediately!” The old woman was overjoyed.

“This boy has a boundless future. Although there are always some Second-Order Origin Returning Realm Juniors who don’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth and enter the Blood Prison, none ever survive while most fall within a few days. If he can emerge safely, his future will certainly be bright!”

“This old master can’t wait to see this little boy and find out what kind of background he has.”

“En, looking at his performance, the Star Field must have a place for him in the future.”

Everyone was speaking extremely highly of Yang Kai while Luo Hai simply smiled without interrupting. Only he understood how much more extraordinary Yang Kai was than everyone had thought.

.....

Inside the cave on Monster Mountain, Yang Kai had completely immersed himself in his comprehension and had lost track of the passage of time.

At a certain point, however, he frowned slightly and opened his eyes.

He noticed a faint change in the atmosphere of the Blood Prison as well as a trace of Domain suddenly appearing where he was on Monster Mountain.

Before coming here, Chi Yue had said that once the aura inside the Blood Prison changes, he must leave immediately, otherwise he would die without burial.

When this kind of change occurred, within five days, the entire Blood Prison would become a Restricted Area that no one could set foot into, filled with chaotic Domains that would not subside again until a thousand years later.

[It is time to leave!]

Slowly getting up and inspecting his gains, Yang Kai grinned widely.

He felt that his understanding of Shi had become much deeper and he was only one step away from the grand accomplishment stage. This step seemed very close but also far away, as if there was some kind of shackle holding him back from reaching it.

However, this wasn’t a big deal. After absorbing the remnant Spiritual Energy of Mad Crocodile Monster King, as long as he thoroughly digested the insights it contained, it wouldn’t be difficult for Yang Kai to reach the grand accomplishment stage in Shi.

Also, as soon as he broke through to the Origin King Realm, forming his own Domain would undoubtedly be easier.

This kind of benefit was something beyond Yang Kai’s reach until now and could only be realized once he reached the Origin King Realm.

Walking out of the cave, Yang Kai took a moment to orient himself before he shot off in a flash of light.

Two days later, in a small valley, Yang Kai appeared leisurely.

“Boy, you’re here!” A figure suddenly flashed from the side and landed in front of Yang Kai, looking at him with a smile.

“Senior Ba He!” Yang Kai turned and nodded to him.

“Brat, I thought you’d died after we didn’t hear from you for so long!” Yu Xiong appeared suddenly and greeted Yang Kai grimly, looking him up and down to see if he was missing any arms or legs.

“Yang Kai!” Shan Qing Luo smiled winningly and landed directly beside him, taking his arm.

Xue Sun appeared immediately after Shan Qing Luo, but only nodded faintly to Yang Kai without much expression.

“Seems like you’re all here,” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

“Did you accomplish that task Adoptive Mother gave you?” Yu Xiong walked over to Yang Kai and asked curiously.

Yang Kai stretched out his hand and wiped his Space Ring, taking out a round crystal-like object and tossed it to Yu Xiong.

Yu Xiong caught it nervously and carefully observed it.

In an instant, everyone’s eyes were drawn to this pure crystal, their eyes growing extremely hot.

“This is... an Origin Essence Crystal?” Ba He gulped hard as he stared at the Origin Essence Crystal without blinking. Even the most indifferent Xue Sun had her breathing turn rapid.

“It’s not fake, right?” Yu Xiong looked up at Yang Kai.

“What do you think?” Yang Kai snickered.

“Doesn’t look like it!” Yu Xiong shook his head then hurriedly took out a jade box from his Space Ring before carefully storing the Origin Essence Crystal into it and putting it away. He then turned to look at Yang Kai with a somewhat complex expression and said, “Little brat, you’re certainly decisive enough. En, this is the second half of the Monster Transformation Secret Art that Adoptive Mother gave me to hold onto.”

Saying so, he tossed something that looked like an ancient book towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai caught it then began flipping through it quickly. After confirming that there were no problems with it, he nodded and said, “I’ve completed the task assigned to me by Senior Chi Yue, now that I’ve handed that thing over to you, it has nothing to do with me anymore.”

“Don’t worry,” Yu Xiong grinned, “With so many of us, we aren’t afraid we will lose it.”

Yang Kai didn’t say anymore on this subject and instead turned to look at Shan Qing Luo and whispered, “Come with me, I have something to say to you.”

“Okay,” Shan Qing Luo nodded and walked off a short distance with Yang Kai.

As if realizing what was about to happen, Shan Qing Luo’s mood suddenly became a little depressed.

Everything around her suddenly lost colour and became bleak.

Yang Kai and Shan Qing Luo stared at each other as a reluctant atmosphere filled the space between them.

After a long silence, Yang Kai sighed and asked, “I met some guys before that seemed to have fought with you. One of them even said he hurt you, are you alright?”

“I’m fine, my Saint Qi was only disturbed a bit by his attack, he didn’t even cause a minor wound,” Shan Qing Luo slowly shook her head. “Are they dead?”

After having met Yang Kai, it would be strange if that group was still alive.

“En.”

“You’re much stronger than me now. When we were back in the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land before, I was the one protecting you,” Shan Qing Luo laughed lightly.

It had only been a few dozen years, yet the fledgling boy she met that day had already walked ahead of her, and that was even after she obtained the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider’s Source.

“Back then... things were quite good,” Yang Kai’s eyes showed a look of remembrance and his smile became ambiguous.

Shan Qing Luo clearly understood what he was referring to and gave him an amorous look.

“Are you going back to Monster Emperor Star?” Yang Kai asked suddenly.

“Adoptive Mother has been very good to me, I can’t just leave her like this,” Shan Qing Luo’s expression instantly saddened, “Moreover, I don’t want to burden you in the future. I am now a Half-Monster Race, and Monster Emperor Star is the most suitable place for me to cultivate. If I leave with you, I will only become a burden to you later, I don’t want that!”

Yang Kai made her feel a great sense of pressure, and if she wanted to walk beside him from now on, she could not settle for temporary satisfaction. Shan Qing Luo knew this better than anyone else.

Yang Kai nodded slightly to express his understanding.

He had considered all of this long ago, so when Shan Qing Luo said it out loud, he wasn’t surprised at all.

“What about you? Are you leaving?”

“En,” Yang Kai smiled lightly, “I picked up the people from the Central Capital and Tong Xuan Realm and will be taking them to a Cultivation Star called Shadowed Star, which is very remote. If there is a chance, I will come to Monster Emperor Star again to see you.”

Shan Qing Luo bit her red lips and clenched her fist tightly, a layer of mist forming across her eyes as she said faintly, “When we last separated, we didn’t even get to say goodbye and it took thirty years for us to reunite. I don’t even know how long we will be apart this time.”

Yang Kai reached out, took her delicate hand, and placed it over his heart as he brought her into his embrace.

Shan Qing Luo looked up and her beautiful eyes blossomed with an amazing brilliance.

Blushing, she held Yang Kai’s hand and also placed it over her heart.

‘You are in my heart, and I am in yours’, such words were left unspoken because there was no need to say them out loud...

Standing up on her tiptoes, Shan Qing Luo closed her eyes tightly as her long eyelashes quivered and she pressed her red lips towards Yang Kai.

“Ah youth...” Not far away, Ba He waxed nostalgically as he crossed his arms and turned his eyes towards the sky.

“Seems my future brother-in-law has been decided,” Yu Xiong grinned as he winked towards Xue Sun.

Xue Sun’s face and neck blushed red as she quickly lowered her gaze and stared at the ground as if trying to find an ant.

Yang Kai’s blood began to boil and his breathing became rapid as he tasted the sweetness and beauty of Shan Qing Luo. Although the Beguiling Demon Queen had charms which could enchant any living creature, this was actually her first time engaging in such an act. So, naturally, she was not Yang Kai’s opponent.

Soon, Shan Qing Luo felt embarrassed with her defeat. Her whole being felt like she was floating on the clouds while her body seemed to no longer belong to herself.

Suddenly, Yang Kai let out a yelp and pulled his mouth back.

Shan Qing Luo took this opportunity to escape from his wicked clutches and withdrew a few steps back, a half-full expression remaining on her face as she clenched her teeth and stared towards Yang Kai.

“Why did you bite me?” Yang Kai asked, aggrieved.

“To commemorate the occasion, and to make sure you don’t forget about me even when we’re apart!” Shan Qing Luo giggled and smiled as tears fell from her eyes and she whispered, “Go now, if you don’t... I’m afraid I won’t be able to let you leave.”

She seemed to have made an extremely difficult decision, and her tender body was trembling slightly. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yang Kai licked his lips and nodded, “Take care of yourself!”

Saying so, he took out a Space Ring and handed it to Shan Qing Luo, “Take this as well, but don’t show its content to anyone.”

“What’s inside?” Shan Qing Luo looked at him suspiciously.

“You’ll understand soon enough,” Yang Kai grinned, not making things clear before turning towards where Ba He and the others were waiting and shouting, “You should all depart now, there’s no need to wait for Xue Lian and the rest of them.”

As soon as he left these words, Space Force wrapped Yang Kai and in the blink of an eye, he disappeared.

Shan Qing Luo opened her mouth, but she didn’t say anything in the end.
