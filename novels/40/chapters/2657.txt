The headquarters of Seeking Passion Sect covered a vast stretch of land, so it took Yang Kai, Ji Yao, and the three Monster Kings two days of wandering around before they finished a completely cursory inspection.

The more Yang Kai observed this place, the more satisfied he was with it.

Previously, he only mentioned that this place might possess the richest World Energy density in the Northern Territory due to the lofty status of the Seeking Passion Great Emperor; but now, it seemed that his unintentional words might actually be true.

Because, the cultivation environment here was much better than the Azure Sun Temple’s.

Azure Sun Temple was also a top Sect, and in terms of status and strength, it was almost on par with the Seeking Passion Sect, but it was slightly worse off in terms of cultivation environment.

Perhaps, only those Sects founded by Great Emperors could compete with the Seeking Passion Sect.

With such a foundation, including so many ready-made buildings and the heritage left behind by the Seeking Passion Sect for tens of thousands of years, Yang Kai was feeling more and more reluctant to give this place up and had begun silently making plans for it in the future.

He checked every nook and cranny of this place, but found nothing valuable.

In the end, under the lead of Ji Yao, the few of them came to a certain large peak.

Ji Yao had visited the Seeking Passion Sect several times with Bing Yun millennia ago, so she knew that this peak was the most highly restricted area of the Seeking Passion Sect. If Seeking Passion Sect had a storehouse to keep its wealth, it must be hidden on this peak.

When Yang Kai and the others arrived, they saw the peak was enveloped by an extremely solid light curtain.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up; he was not shocked but delighted instead.

The light curtain was still intact, which meant that no one had broken it since it was activated. If anything valuable was stored here, it would still be here as the disciples who fled the Seeking Passion Sect would not have been able to enter.

The several Monster Kings wanted to break the Spirit Array with their brute strength, but Yang Kai stopped them. Rummaging in his Space Ring, he soon took out several extraordinary looking tokens and tested them by pouring his Emperor Qi into them one by one.

In just a short time, one of the tokens lit up, and its radiance shot to the light curtain, causing a gap to appear in it.

These tokens were looted by Yang Kai from the Space Rings of the top Masters from the Seeking Passion Sect. Since this particular token could open the restriction here, it must have belonged to Sect Master Feng Xuan.

“Let’s go in and see what good things are inside.” Yang Kai was jovial and took the lead.

There was a magnificent and extraordinary temple on top of the mountain.

The group of five entered the temple and saw that the decorations were quite old and traditional, well worn with time.

Yang Kai scanned this place with his Divine Sense and found nothing special about it, but after pondering for a while, he instructed, “Let’s split up and search, just call out if any of you found anything suspicious.”

“Yes!” The three Monster Kings immediately went into action.

However, Ji Yao did not leave, instead just choosing to follow Yang Kai around.

“Do you really want to establish a Sect here?”

Ji Yao abruptly asked after they had walked for a while.

The three Monster Kings, while intelligent, weren’t all that perceptive, so they did not really pay attention to Yang Kai’s facial expressions the last few days, but Ji Yao had been observing silently and found that Yang Kai was really moved by that idea and wanted to establish a Sect here.

“Somewhat,” Yang Kai turned back to Ji Yao, “Why?” He grinned as he asked.

Ji Yao shook her head lightly, “Nothing. But if you want to establish a Sect here, it’s a good choice.”

“You think so too?”

Ji Yao pressed on, “Both Seeking Passion Sect and our Ice Heart Valley are in the Northern Territory, so if you settle down here, your Sect and Ice Heart Valley can watch out for each other. On top of that, you are qualified to engage in such an endeavour.”

Although Yang Kai only had a First-Order Emperor Realm cultivation, Ji Yao knew that he was on a completely different level compared to any other ordinary First-Order Emperor; even she would be no match for him if she fought against him one on one. In this world, only Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters could challenge him equally.

If Yang Kai were not qualified to establish a Sect, most Sects in this world would not be qualified to exist.

Yang Kai beamed, “I had the same thought too, but I don’t have a full plan yet, and even if I did, there would be a lot of trouble implementing it.”

Ji Yao smiled lightly, “That shouldn’t be a problem. You can discuss this with Honoured Master and I’m certain she will provide whatever assistance you need. Ice Heart Valley will also help in any way it can.”

Yang Kai nodded, “I’m not in a rush, I was just thinking about it. I will definitely ask Senior Bing Yun for advice when the time comes.”

Ji Yao nodded with a glimmer of expectation in her heart.

Yang Kai had a close relationship with Ice Heart Valley and had a deep connection with her Honoured Master, Bing Yun. Once he was truly rooted to this place left by the Seeking Passion Sect, his Sect and Ice Heart Valley could support one another. With two giants forming a close alliance, who would dare to provoke them? Ice Heart Valley would never be besieged like it just was again.

The main reason why Ice Heart Valley suffered this disaster this time was that it had always been too content with its circumstances and had too little communication with the outside world, leading to it having no real allies.

“But you have to think carefully about the name of this Sect. You can’t just continue to use the name Seeking Passion Sect, right?” Ji Yao suggested.

Yang Kai smiled lightly and nodded, “I have my own ideas about that.”

He had already long thought about the name of the Sect he would found.

At that moment, an eagle’s cry suddenly came from a certain direction. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Yang Kai turned that way and commented, “Ying Fei seems to have found something, let’s go and take a look.”

Ji Yao nodded in agreement.

A short while later, the pair arrived at an escarpment. The escarpment stood unimpressively on the mountain peak, but it had caught Ying Fei’s attention. He looked at it curiously and examined it by patting and touching here and there from time to time.

Seeing the arrival of Yang Kai, Ying Fei hurriedly said, “Young Master Yang, there’s something odd about this place.”

Yang Kai scanned the escarpment with his Divine Sense and nodded, “Indeed, there is something strange.”

Although this escarpment did not look awe-inspiring, it was actually covered in a highly covert restriction.

If it were Yang Kai who came here first, he might have carelessly missed it; however, Ying Fei’s true form was that of a giant eagle, so not only was his speed astonishing, his vision was also incredibly sharp. As such, he could spot something was off with just a glance.

“I wonder if those tokens could open this restriction too?” Ying Fei postulated.

“We won’t know if we don’t try,” Yang Kai smiled lightly. He took out the tokens he plundered from the Seeking Passion Sect’s Elders again and began testing them one by one.

As Yang Kai worked on this, Xi Lei and Xie Wu Wei arrived. After knowing the situation, they all looked interested and thought to themselves that this should be the storehouse of Seeking Passion Sect, or its hidden Treasury.

It was natural that the wealth stored by a top Sect, which had tens of thousands of years of heritage, would make them excited.

It turned out that the tokens Yang Kai seized were really useful. One of the tokens resonated with the restriction here and a mysterious beam of light flashed from it before the escarpment in front abruptly opened in a rumble, revealing a dark tunnel that led into the middle of the mountain.

Then, a glimpse of light suddenly came out of the tunnel. The light was like a prairie fire, shining brighter and brighter, extending all the way to illuminate the tunnel.

“Let’s go!” Yang Kai vigilantly looked around while taking the lead to enter the tunnel.

The rest hurriedly kept up with him.

The escarpment closed again as they entered the tunnel, but the tunnel itself remained bright thanks to a number of light crystals embedded in the walls.

The group descended some unknown distance before arriving at a huge underground cave.

After getting a clear view of the situation in the cave, Xie Wu Wei took a deep breath and remarked excitedly, “It’s really a hidden Treasury!”

He was not the only one to gasp, as the other two Monster Kings and Yang Kai were also excited. Nevertheless, Ji Yao still looked indifferent, as if wealth was just dirt to her. She had cultivated Ice Attribute Secret Arts her whole life, so she almost always remained calm and cold.

Inside the cave were all kinds of Low-Rank, Mid-Rank, and High-Rank Source Crystals, all piled up in hills in front of them. Their numbers were simply countless.

Yang Kai looked over and was almost dazzled by the light reflected by those Source Crystals.

Although he ripped off hundreds of millions of Source Crystals in the Ancient Wild Lands, the number of Source Crystals here could only be more than that.

This wasn’t a surprise though as this was the accumulated wealth of the Seeking Passion Sect over the past few tens of thousands of years, not something an ordinary Sect could compare to.

Since Yang Kai had the intention to establish a Sect here, the more resources he had on hand, the better. When he was capable of bringing his friends and family over from Shadowed Star, he would need to have enough cultivation resources to share with them.

Behind the Source Crystals, there were many wooden racks on which were packed countless boxes, including wooden boxes, jade boxes, metal boxes, and so on and so forth.

Yang Kai led the others to the wooden shelves, took some samples to investigate, and soon found that the contents of these boxes were almost the same as what he had guessed. They were all rare herbs, each of which was extremely precious and with long medicinal ages.

The Monster Kings were not interested in the herbs because the Ancient Wild Lands were abundant with such things. The Ancient Wild Lands was perhaps the place with the most spirit medicines in the Star Boundary.

Therefore, they paid no more attention after a few glances.

On the other side, there were also many wooden shelves, on which were not all kinds of boxes but rather tens of thousands of jade bottles.

After investigating, Yang Kai found that these bottles were filled with refined Spirit Pills of different grades, and they were all needed by cultivators for cultivation.

Moving further into the cave, the group came across ancient books and jade slips containing Secret Arts and Techniques belonging to the Seeking Passion Sect.

Yang Kai was impressed by these things, because they were all treasures left by the Seeking Passion Sect for tens of thousands of years, and they would be useful to the disciples if he ever established a Sect.

At what seemed to be the end of the cave were a tremendous number of artifacts. The lowest quality artifacts were Dao Source Grade, and there were even a few hundred brightly shining Emperor Grade Artifacts among them.

The energy fluctuation released from all the artifacts accumulated in one place was truly astounding.
