One man and one beast flew quickly through the forests of the Heavenly Monster Mountain.

The Purple Squirrel led the way as Yang Kai followed closely after.

After the Purple Squirrel interacted with Yang Kai for a while and ascertained that he had no malicious intentions towards it, the squirrel no longer seemed to be afraid of him. In fact, the squirrel didn’t even try to escape, stopping along the way as it led him forward to ensure Yang Kai didn’t get lost.

It was obvious that the Purple Squirrel was going down a specific path as, along the way, they didn’t encounter any other Monster Beasts. It was unknown what type of ability the Purple Squirrel was using to avoid them.

An hour later, the man and beast arrived at a mountain valley.

The mountain valley was surrounded by tall peaks on all four sides and would be very difficult to find without being familiar with the area.

The Purple Squirrel arrived at a place near the entrance of the mountain valley before it suddenly stopped going forward. It waited for Yang Kai to arrive and then used its paw to point at the mountain valley before grasping its own neck with its paws as it acted as if it had trouble breathing and rolled its eyes before it collapsed on the ground.

“Hmm?” Yang Kai furrowed his eyebrows. “You mean to say that there’s something to watch out for in that mountain valley...”

The Purple Squirrel jumped back up again and nodded at Yang Kai.

“Let me see!” As Yang Kai spoke, he glanced towards the mountain valley for only a moment before he instantly understood what danger the Purple Squirrel was referring to.

This mountain valley was actually filled with dense green poisonous mist. This mist was identical in colour and form to the mist the large python had sprayed out earlier. However, the venomous clouds here took up far too big of an area, to the point where they covered everything in the mountain valley. It was impossible to see what was inside.

“I’m really curious...” Yang Kai smiled as he glanced at the Purple Squirrel, “Just what method did you use before to steal a spirit fruit from here...”

Since this mountain valley was covered in poison fog at all times, with the Purple Squirrel’s strength only being at the Ninth-Order, it should have been impossible for it to even enter, not to mention steal a spirit fruit.

However, the fact of the matter was that the Purple Squirrel stole a spirit fruit which caused the python to keep chasing it all the way until it reached Yang Kai.

Yet, the Purple Squirrel blinked and looked at him in confusion in response to Yang Kai’s question.

This time, it seemed that it didn’t understand...

“Stop acting ignorant!” Yang Kai coldly snorted, but he didn’t pry. Instead, he waved his sleeve and sent the Soul Devouring Demon Insects into the mountain valley.

The Purple Squirrel waited with an expectant look when it saw this.

It had witnessed quite clearly from the sidelines before how these Soul Devouring Demon Insects had devoured the poison fog before, so it knew that the green clouds in the mountain valley here would pose no problem.

As long as the venomous clouds were dispelled, it would be easy to obtain the spirit fruits inside!

What happened next was just as the squirrel expected. Everywhere that the pitch-black insect cloud passed by, the dense venomous clouds disappeared at a rate that was visible to the naked eye. The Soul Devouring Demon Insects swallowed all of Poisonous Spiritual Energy and used it to strengthen themselves.

In just one hour, all of the poison mist in the mountain valley was completely eliminated.

The Soul Devouring Demon Insects also seemed to benefit significantly from consuming this large amount of poison and happily buzzed as they returned to Yang Kai’s sleeve.

“Let’s go!” Yang Kai told the Purple Squirrel as he stepped into the mountain valley like it was his own backyard.

The Purple Squirrel also acted all grand and tough thanks to Yang Kai as it sauntered arrogantly into the mountain valley with its small legs...

“That must be the spirit fruit tree...” Yang Kai went directly to the central part of the mountain valley and soon found a lush fruit tree that was about as tall as a regular man.

Yang Kai had already noticed this fruit tree when he was observing from the mountain valley’s entrance, but he hadn’t dared to enter because the insect cloud hadn’t finished clearing away the poison yet.

The fruit tree shone with an unusual halo and there were also traces of a large being moving around the tree, which had likely been left behind by the dead python.

Yang Kai’s eyes instantly lit up when he scanned the fruit tree.

He discovered that there were five spirit fruits identical to the one that the Purple Squirrel gave him earlier on this tree.

As a Dao Source Grade Alchemist who had also obtained the inheritance of Gong Sun Mu, an Emperor Grade Alchemist, Yang Kai was even able to recognize the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus, yet he was completely clueless as to the identify these spirit fruits.

He could only conclude that this spirit fruit was a unique product of the Divine Ascension Mirror World, and that the outside world had never seen such a thing before.

Still, the spirit fruit’s effect was incredibly strong and was especially suitable for a cultivator like Yang Kai who was training here from the outside world.

He didn’t waste any time as he immediately took a fruit from the fruit tree and tossed it into his mouth and chewed.

Not only did his body’s discomfort significantly diminish, it also felt like his Spiritual Energy improved somewhat.

“Not bad at all!” Yang Kai took another spirit fruit and gobbled it up.

*Gudong...*

A sound came from the side.

Yang Kai glanced over diagonally and saw the Purple Squirrel half kneeling by his foot. Its eyes were round as it pitifully looked at Yang Kai. It was obviously the squirrel who had made the gulping sound just now.

“Even if you look at me with such sincerity...” Yang Kai tossed a third spirit fruit into his mouth as he spoke unclearly with his mouth full, “I don’t have any extra to give to you!”

The Purple Squirrel’s eyes instantly darkened as it lowered its head in a depressed manner.

“Ai...” Yang Kai sighed deeply, “Fine, I’ll give you one.”

As he spoke, he took the last two fruits from the tree and ate one before handing the other to the Purple Squirrel.

The Purple Squirrel instantly became energetic as its eyes lit up. It stood up straight and raised its paws to accept the fruit before carefully sniffing it a few times. It had a happy and satisfied expression as it then stuffed it into its stomach pouch and hid it like a treasure. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Yang Kai just ate four spirit fruits plus the one from the Purple Squirrel, so the discomfort in his body had disappeared completely. He even had a mysterious feeling as if he had just been reborn.

He glanced at the Purple Squirrel and chuckled, “Heh heh.”

The Purple Squirrel immediately covered its pouch with its paws as it vigilantly looked at Yang Kai, as if it was afraid that he would go back on his word.

“What type of person do you take me for?” Yang Kai coldly snorted with a serious expression, “Don’t look down on me little brat, how could I possibly take back something that I have already given away?”

The Purple Squirrel glanced at him, seeming to understand yet also not.

“Little guy...” Yang Kai was all smiles again as he looked at the squirrel, “Are you familiar with this territory?”

The Purple Squirrel fell silent after hearing this before it nodded.

“Then you lead the way. If we find something good again, let’s do like before and I’ll split some with you, okay?” Yang Kai had a friendly expression as he spoke alluringly. He even used an attitude of incitement as he patted the Purple Squirrel’s stomach pouch. “As long as you cooperate with me, I’ll fill up your pouch sooner or later.”

The Purple Squirrel’s eyes lit up after it heard this and instantly became excited, chattering away while nodding its head like a chicken pecking at rice.

Before Yang Kai could even issue any commands, the squirrel voluntarily ran forth and led the way.

Yang Kai arched his brow and followed closely after.

The Purple Squirrel was indeed quite familiar with the Heavenly Monster Mountains and seemed to know what places had good things hidden away; unfortunately, most of those treasures were being guarded by some powerful Monster Beasts just like with the python. The Purple Squirrel couldn’t possibly afford to antagonize these beasts, so it could only helplessly look at the treasures from a distance.

But with the powerful Yang Kai as its protector, it didn’t have to worry anymore.

It simply needed to take Yang Kai to the treasure’s location and let Yang Kai fight and kill the Monster Beast guarding the treasure. After that was the fun part of dividing the spoils...

Yang Kai meant what he said, and every time he obtained something good, he would give a portion to the Purple Squirrel. As for how much he gave, that varied from moment to moment.

In just two short days, Yang Kai and the Purple Squirrel swept countless Monster Beast nests within a ten thousand kilometre radius. Yang Kai obtained countless spirit fruits and Monster Beast Soul Sources, reaping tremendous benefits.

The spirit fruits that grew in the Divine Ascension Mirror World were basically all items that were useful for cultivating Spiritual Energy.

However, some were also harmful. Yang Kai accidentally ate one and ended up feeling quite dizzy. It took him some time to recover from his shock and if it wasn’t for him having a precious treasure like the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus in his body, that one spirit fruit alone likely would have killed him.

After all this, Yang Kai absorbed a lot of Soul Sources and his Soul Avatar once again started to feel discomfort.

This condition didn’t affect him too much, but it did mean that Yang Kai was no longer able to continue absorbing Soul Sources.

Compared to Yang Kai, the Soul Devouring Demon Insects had grown more as they devoured vast amounts of Spiritual Energy. Ever since they entered the Divine Ascension Mirror World less than ten days ago, the Soul Devouring Demon Insects had almost doubled in strength.

Yang Kai also faintly sensed that his Soul Devouring Demon Insects seemed to be evolving in some unknown direction. He could sense quite clearly that the Soul Devouring Demon Insects had become ever more vicious, cruel, and rebellious, sometimes even ignoring his orders.

He didn’t know if this was a good or bad thing.

Meanwhile, the Purple Squirrel’s stomach pouch was basically completely full.

The little guy was quite strange. Even though it obtained many good things, it never ate them, seemingly more interested in adding to its collection as it kept stuffing the spirit fruits Yang Kai gave it into its pouch.

Finally... its pouch became completely full.

The squirrel wasn’t large to begin with, so how large could its pouch possibly be?

Yang Kai finally had a great reason to take all the gains for himself.

The Purple Squirrel didn’t seem to mind as it continued to work hard and lead the way. It helped Yang Kai to sweep through the Heavenly Monster Mountains without missing anything.

Two days later, Yang Kai silently stood in front of the entrance to a cave as the Purple Squirrel crouched on his shoulder.

After being together for these two days, the Purple Squirrel no longer feared Yang Kai and even became somewhat friendly with him.

Currently, the man and beast had focused expressions as they listened intently to the sounds from this cave.
