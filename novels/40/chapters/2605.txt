“Sir Yang’s Divine Ability is truly wondrous and inscrutable. I’ve truly learned much today,” Fan Wu praised, and not just as a means of flattery, as he truly did feel this way.

It was impossible to not be impressed with how Yang Kai had made such a large Stone Spirit vanish with apparently such little effort.

Fan Wu felt that he personally had no such ability.

The three Divine Venerables were astonished by Yang Kai just from this alone.

They thought about it some more and figured that with Yang Kai already having such astonishing cultivation at his young age, and being highly skilled in the Dao of Space Force, it was possible he might even become a Great Emperor in the future. Even if he couldn’t become a Great Emperor, becoming a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master would definitely not be a problem for him at all. What was a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master who was a Master in the Dao of Space? Even if such a person wasn’t a Great Emperor, he would still be one of the top Masters within the Emperor Realm. Yang Kai also had the Mountains and Rivers Bell, and the Heaven’s Order descendant was deeply attached to him…

The three Divine Venerables reassessed Yang Kai at this moment and discovered that this youth secretly contained enormous and unimaginable potential, which helped to open up their way of thinking.

Fan Wu cupped his fists, “Sir Yang, now that things are finished here, how about you come to my place to rest for a while?”

After Fan Wu realized the potential within Yang Kai, he no longer disliked the idea of Yang Kai staying in the Ancient Lands. Instead, he even started acting as a warm and welcoming host.

Cang Gou and Luan Feng had evidently noticed this as well, so right after Fan Wu finished speaking, Cang Gou added, “This one’s palace also welcomes Sir Yang. If Sir Yang doesn’t mind…”

Luan Feng immediately interrupted him, “This Queen would also like to invite Sir Yang to her palace. I’m just afraid that Sir Yang won’t agree.”

Cang Gou felt really aggrieved because he didn’t get to finish his sentence. He couldn’t help but glare at Luan Feng as an obviously depressed expression appeared on his face.

Yang Kai was all smiles as he looked at the three, he clearly knew what they were thinking. He secretly chuckled coldly in his mind while wondering if they would still be so passionate if they learned about his true intentions in a bit. He pondered for a bit before saying, “Since all three of you are inviting me so warmly, this Young Master would appear impolite if he refused. I wonder which of your three palaces is the closest to this location?”

He didn’t have much of a relationship with any of these three Divine Venerables. The only one that was easier on his eyes was Luan Feng, since she was a woman who had some natural advantages in this area. Yang Kai also had a slightly better opinion of her compared to the other two because of Ruo Xi’s matter.

Still, it didn’t matter where he went right now, as the important part was after he went.

Luan Feng’s pretty eyes lit up, “The closest location is this Queen’s palace.”

Cang Gou instantly became unhappy, “It’s just around a hundred thousand kilometres closer than this King’s palace. You call that close!?”

Yang Kai waved his hand, “Since we’re closest to Lady Feng’s palace, then this Young Master shall go rest at her palace. Cough cough… my injuries haven’t healed yet, so it’s not convenient for me to travel long distances.” As he spoke, he actually began to cough violently as he spat Golden Blood everywhere like it was rain.

The three Divine Venerables were astonished as Luan Feng exclaimed, “Sir Yang, what’s wrong!?”

The Third Disciple’s beautiful face changed expressions as she was also standing nearby. She hurriedly went over to support Yang Kai as she concernedly muttered, “Honoured Master…”

Yang Kai held his chest as he made an expression that it was difficult for him to speak, “Shi Huo attacked me too viciously, so this Young Master was seriously injured and likely won’t recover within a short period of time.”

Fan Wu and the others were really surprised as they thought in unison, [Didn’t that Heaven’s Order descendant give you a ten-thousand-year-old Phoenix Blood Fruit? With such a supreme healing medicine, what type of injury would possibly be unrestorable? Additionally, you were clearly fine earlier, so why would you suddenly be spitting blood?] They all had strange expressions because they didn’t know what Yang Kai was trying to do.

*Cough cough…*

Yang Kai had a pale expression as he panted, “I hear that the Ancient Lands contain a lot of spirit medicines with long medicinal ages. If I can obtain some to consume, they’ll definitely help this Young Master’s injuries. Sigh, it’s such a pity that this Young Master is currently injured and doesn’t have the strength to go search.”

Fan Wu’s expression darkened as he instantly understood what Yang Kai wanted. His mouth slightly twitched as he said, “Sir Yang, rest assured, this King will have his subordinate Monster Kings search for those spirit medicines so that I can personally present them to you. I hope that Sir Yang can hold on for a while longer.”

After Fan Wu said this, he surreptitiously glared at Cang Gou and transmitted a secret message.

Cang Gou instantly realized what was going on, so he hurriedly added, “This King will naturally work his hardest for Sir Yang’s sake.”

“That’s good, that’s good,” Yang Kai wiped away the fresh blood at the corner of his mouth. He leaned half his body on the Third Disciple as he said, “Apart from these spirit medicine and spirit fruits, if there are also some High-Rank Source Crystals or rare treasures… This Young Master’s injuries will probably be restored even quicker.”

[What do Source Crystals and rare treasures have to do with your injuries?] Fan Wu and the others really wanted to ask this out loud to Yang Kai. How was this not blatant extortion?

“You three can rest assured, once this Young Master’s injuries are fully healed, he shall leave the Ancient Lands. I won’t trouble you for too long,” Yang Kai forced himself to smile harmlessly as he spoke with an expression filled with weakness.

Fan Wu’s eyes twitched violently as he said insincerely, “Sir Yang is being too polite. With Sir Yang’s status, it’s alright no matter how long you stay in the Ancient Lands.”

“Ah, right,” Yang Kai acted as if he suddenly thought about something as he said, “Since Shi Huo is dead, all the treasures he plundered over the years are obviously useless to him now. I need to trouble you three to go to his palace, carefully make an inventory of everything, and then bring it over to me. By rights, all of that should belong to Ruo Xi. I will temporarily hold onto it and pass it to her after she comes out of the Blood Gate.”

After he said this, Fan Wu and the others felt as if blood was dripping from their hearts; however, they didn’t dare to say anything against this since Yang Kai brought the Heaven’s Order descendant into the matter.

Fan Wu answered, “Sir Yang is correct. Shi Huo indeed plundered many good things over the years. This King shall soon bring people over to make an inventory of those items before delivering everything to Sir.” After he said this, he glanced at Luan Feng and said, “Lady Feng, please take good care of Sir Yang.”

Luan Feng nodded, “I understand.” She then turned to look at Yang Kai, “Sir Yang, this Queen shall take you back to her palace now.”

Yang Kai nodded in agreement.

Luan Feng immediately circulated her Qi to envelop Yang Kai and the Third Disciple before flying off.

Before they left, Yang Kai even waved towards Fan Wu and Cang Gou, “This Young Master shall be waiting for good news from you two. Please do your best regarding this matter.”

Fan Wu and Cang Gou currently had smiles that looked even worse than if they were crying as they cupped their fists in unison as a respectful goodbye.

Once Yang Kai and the others completely vanished from their vision, Fan Wu’s expression suddenly collapsed as he shook his head and smiled bitterly, “It’s easy to invite a Deity, but difficult to make one leave.”

Cang Gou glanced at him and commented, “Shi Huo’s belongings… Are we really going to give everything to him? Shi Huo collected a significant amount of wealth over the years.”

Fan Wu glanced at him dispassionately while asking, “Is treasure more important, or is your life more important?”

Cang Gou answered, “It’s not like he knows how much wealth Shi Huo has collected. He’s a First-Order Emperor Realm, so he’ll probably laugh his teeth off if we give him just a little. Can he really handle that many good things?”

Fan Wu coldly snorted, “He might not know, but you think Lady Feng wouldn’t know? All he has to do is ask her. What if Lady Feng leaks the information to him? How are you and I going to explain?”

Cang Gou frowned, “Lady Feng isn’t the type to say that much, is she?”

Fan Wu sighed, “He keeps pressuring us with that Heaven’s Order descendant. He’s asking for Shi Huo’s legacy by using the Heaven’s Order descendant’s name. It’s likely that Lady Feng won’t dare to deceive him.”

Cang Gou also heavily sighed when he heard this as pain filled his expression.

…..

Tall mountains loomed as clouds spread across a realm that seemed straight out of a fairy tale. At the peak of a certain mountain was a grand and magnificent palace around which mythical beasts and birds frolicked, making it appear like a paradise.

This was Luan Feng’s palace.

As the palace of one of the Four Great Divine Venerables, this place naturally possessed a Peak-Rank Earth Vein, making the ambient World Energy astonishingly rich.

Luan Feng softly landed together with Yang Kai and the Third Disciple, after which Yang Kai’s eyes flashed with surprise as he looked all around and secretly exclaimed to himself.

When they landed, a few beautiful women in maidservant attire immediately came up to greet them. There were two rows and eight maidservants in total, and they all possessed dense Monster Qi, making it evident that they were powerful members of the Monster Race.

Yang Kai scanned them with his Divine Sense and found that the eight maidservants were surprisingly all Low-Rank Twelfth-Order, equivalent to First-Order Emperors.

The maidservants came forward and bowed in unison, “Greetings, Mistress!”

Luan Feng waved her hand and had them rise. She then pointed to Yang Kai, “This Sir Yang is this Queen’s Honoured Guest who will be staying at my Phoenix Nest Palace for some time. Tell the others that if you see Sir Yang, it is as if you’re seeing this Queen. No one is to show him the slightest disrespect.”

When the eight maidservants heard this, they all had looks of astonishment on their faces, but they still responded quickly and in unison, after which they secretly began to observe Yang Kai.

Their beautiful eyes glanced over and found that Yang Kai was actually a Human, which gave them quite the shock. They wondered just who he could be that their Divine Venerable would value him so greatly. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Seeing him was like seeing the Divine Venerable. This was an incredible honour.

As they spoke, a precocious little girl of about seven or eight suddenly appeared behind them. This little girl had a pink and perfect appearance and somewhat resembled Luan Feng. She had two cute braids, and she immediately rushed over to pounce into Luan Feng’s arms. She kept pushing her little head around, which caused Luan Feng’s voluptuous peaks to distort and change shape.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but gulp when he saw this.

Luan Feng’s face became bright red due to her chest being pushed around like this. She noticed Yang Kai’s strange gaze as well, so she hurriedly held the little girl in her arms and angrily scolded, “Ling’er, stop playing around. I have a guest today, so I’ll play with you later.”

She smiled apologetically to Yang Kai after she said this, “My daughter is a little spoiled. I hope Sir Yang doesn’t mind.”

“I don’t mind. I don’t mind at all.” Yang Kai swept his eyes over this girl named Ling’er and exclaimed in realization, “Lady Feng, is she your daughter that I previously met on Clear Jade Mountain?”

“Indeed!” Lady Feng put Ling’er down and patted her head with obvious love.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but exclaim how wondrous things were.

Yang Kai had met this girl named Ling’er before back at Clear Jade Mountain when the little Luan Feng revealed itself. He never expected that she would actually be able to take Human form after only a few years and that her cultivation would be this high, reaching the Mid-Rank Eleventh-Order.

However, this Ling’er was the descendant of a Divine Spirit, so it wasn’t strange that she would have such an astonishing growth rate.

Yang Kai suddenly became rather curious as he looked at the little girl.

[Giving birth obviously required a man and a woman, so how had Luan Feng given birth to her daughter? There probably wasn’t a male Luan Feng in this world, right?]

[Could it be… That she got together with one of her subordinate Monster Kings?] Yang Kai’s expression instantly became strange when he thought about this.
