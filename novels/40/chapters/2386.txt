Only after hearing what she said did Yang Kai understand that these people Sang De chose were all extremely strong without relying on any backers. No wonder he needed five years to prepare for this. It seemed there weren’t many people who were able to meet his requirements.

“Whether he has the qualifications or not, this Old Master has tested personally. If you have any problems with this, you can get off the ship now!” Sang De grunted.

She Lan’s teeth could almost break with how hard she was gritting them. She knew that she would definitely suffer if she fell out with Sang De now. After thinking about it, she suddenly smiled coldly, “What about after we’re done here?”

Sang De said indifferently, “What you do after this is your business, but before that, you better watch yourselves!”

She Lan nodded heavily, “Fine, I’ll just wait.”

As she spoke, she got a vicious glare at Yang Kai, “Little brat, you better apologize to me while you can or I’ll show you what I can do to you.”

Yang Kai turned around, showing She Lan the back of his head.

She Lan was so pissed that she could almost gnash her teeth broken.

If this woman was not so shameless, then Yang Kai wouldn’t have been so rude to her; after all, they were going to be working together. But this woman had not the slightest bit of self-respect, so if Yang Kai was polite to her, then she might really latch onto him.

Yang Kai wasn’t interested in her at all.

“Huh, what’s that ship doing?” Chen Fei suddenly frowned and looked towards Clear Sky City. He quickly said, “They’re not coming towards us, are they?”

“That’s the City Lord’s Mansion’s sea ship!” Man Kuai’s face also turned serious when he saw the flag on the sea ship.

“From the direction they’re going, it seems they’re really aiming for us.” She Lan wasn’t in the mood to keep wrestling over petty matters with Yang Kai anymore. Her pretty face sank and she turned around, shouting, “Did one of you leak any information?!”

At these words, Sang De’s face changed and anger sprang from his eyes, sweeping his gaze over the faces of Yang Kai and the others one by one.

“It’s not my fault.” Chen Fei was the first to clear himself from the matter, “This Chen is used to being alone. I have no habit of leaking secrets.”

“Me neither,” Man Kuai said.

She Lan sneered, “It’s not the two of you, and it’s not this Mistress either. It’s even more impossible for it to be Grandmaster. The only possibility is...”

While speaking, her beautiful eyes turned towards Yang Kai, sneering.

Yang Kai shrugged, “It was me!”

When they saw him admitting it so readily, She Lan and the others were all taken aback. Following that, their bodies flashed and they surrounded Yang Kai, Source Qi was condensing as they prepared to strike at any moment.

She Lan said, “If you can’t give us a reasonable explanation now, then the ocean is going to be your burial ground.”

Sang De’s face was also grim as he looked coldly at Yang Kai, appearing greatly dissatisfied. It had only been three days since he sought out Yang Kai to cooperate with them, but he didn’t expect him to sell them out so quickly. Naturally, he was furious.

Yang Kai tilted his head and looked at Sang De, “The man captaining that ship is Yu Le Ping! I need not say anything more, do I, Grandmaster?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Upon hearing this, the frown on Sang De’s face gradually relaxed, “So, you didn’t leak anything? He’s just here for revenge?”

Yang Kai had a fight with Yu Le Ping in front of Sang De’s home last time, a matter which Sang De was well aware of. Now that he knew who it was that was coming after him, how could Sang De not be clear about the situation?

It was not that someone had leaked any information, but rather, Yu Le Ping had chased after Yang Kai in order to get revenge for last time.

“You have grievances with Yu Le Ping?” Chen Fei also stopped being hostile at him and asked suspiciously.

Naturally, they knew about Yu Le Ping. He was a Master from the City Lord’s Mansion and a Third-Order Dao Source Realm that was considered someone with some power on the island.

“It’s just a trivial matter...” Yang Kai grinned meaningfully, “I broke one of his arms a few days ago in front of the Grandmaster’s door. Who knew he could be so vindictive!”

“Broke his arm!?” Upon hearing this, the faces of She Lan and the others changed.

Yu Le Ping was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master. In terms of cultivation, he was about as strong as anyone here, but Yang Kai still managed to break his arm. It was obvious that his strength was much greater than that of Yu Le Ping’s.

In other words, they should not be underestimating the true strength of this nameless Yang Kai.

In an instant, the gazes of She Lan and the others became serious when they looked at Yang Kai, especially She Lan. She did not take Yang Kai seriously before, but now, she had to re-examine whether it was in her best interest to fall out with him.

“Grandmaster, what should we do now?” Man Kuai looked at Sang De with a frown, “We can’t just hand Brother Yang over, can we?”

Sang De pondered for a moment before he made a decision, “Pretend we never saw them. Keep going!”

As he said that, he made a seal with his hands and pushed his Source Qi, speeding up the ship.

When they saw this, everyone knew what he was planning. Sang De obviously wanted to lure Yu Le Ping and his crew towards the depths of the sea and then kill them!

All the people he invited were Third-Order Dao Source Realms. Even though they were small in number, all of them were top Masters in the Dao Source Realm, so even if Yu Le Ping really dared to chase after them, things may not go as he expected.

As soon as the ship accelerated, the people from the City Lord’s Mansion seemed to have noticed and also sped up to catch them.

A day later, the two ships were already several tens of thousands of kilometres away from Clear Sky Island.

Since half a day ago, the sea ship chasing them from behind had been constantly waving their flags, seemingly ordering Sang De and the others to stop, but Sang De did not pay it any heed and just pretended not to have seen it, pushing forward at full speed.

Only when they were far away enough from Clear Sky Island did Sang De slowly slow down the ship and stop.

An hour later, the City Lord’s Mansion’s ship finally got close to them. Yu Le Ping was standing on the deck which was almost dripping with gloom.

Once the two ships got closer to each other, Yu Le Ping flew directly onto Sang De’s ship along with many of the City Lord’s Mansion’s cultivators, counting roughly fifteen. There were still a few others who remained on their own deck.

“Are you blind? Did you not see this King’s orders for you to stop your ship?” Yu Le Ping was shouting angrily as soon as he got on.

“So, it is Sir Yu.” She Lan walked up to him while flaunting her slender waist. Pretty face smiling, she said, “Sir Yu, what brought you out to sea? If I had known that Sir Yu would be following us, then this Mistress would not have left.”

“She Lan!” Yu Le Ping seemed to know She Lan, so when he saw her on this ship, he couldn’t help but frown and put some distance between them. He obviously knew that She Lan was a woman not to be messed with. She was simply a venomous snake! Anyone who got involved with her wouldn’t have a good ending.

“Sir, are you here for me?” She Lan was still putting on her coquettish play and giggling, “Sir, if you want this Mistress then just say the word, why chase so hard?”

Yu Le Ping’s face was covered in black lines as he said in disgust, “None of your damn business!”

As he spoke, he swept his gaze over at Yang Kai with a fierce smile, but he soon froze when he saw the two people next to Yang Kai and he asked suspiciously, “Chen Fei, Man Kuai?”

Sang De used an artifact to change his appearance, so he wasn’t able to recognize him.

“How did you people end up together?” Yu Le Ping was confused.

Whether it be She Lan, Chen Fei, or Man Kuai, all of them were well-known figures on Clear Sky Island because of their strength. They had always been solitary Masters who never joined any great force. Such people were rare on the island.

But these lone wolves actually appeared on the same boat, so obviously something was wrong here.

But soon, Yu Le Ping seemed to have realized something and his eyes shone, “What are you doing at sea together?”

She Lan and these men wouldn’t make a move if there was nothing to be gained, so if they were brought together, there was definitely a bigger story behind their actions. Likely, they had discovered some kind of precious treasure and were out here together to collect it.

Thinking of this possibility, Yu Le Ping’s heart became fiery with enthusiasm. He came here chasing after Yang Kai but he did not expect to inadvertently uncover this secret plan. Didn’t that mean that he could also share in their harvest? If it’s a treasure that could catch these people’s attention, then it must be useful for him as well.

“I got bored on the island so I came out to look at the sea, admiring the boundless view. Does this concern you, sir?” She Lan chuckled.

Yu Le Ping’s face was grim, “Do you think I am a fool or are you treating me as one?”

The faces of the cultivators from the City Lord’s Mansion who followed Yu Le Ping here turned grim as well, eyes glowing fiercely and glaring at She Lan and the others. All of them were under the protection of the City Lord’s Mansion and were used to putting on airs on Clear Sky Island, so they didn’t treat She Lan and the others seriously.

“This King suspects that you have come out to sea to do something against Clear Sky Island’s interests. All of you will go back with me now and be investigated. Those who disobey will be killed without mercy!” Yu Le Ping waved his hand and shouted.

“It seems like... Sir Yu is a fool.” She Lan pursed her lips and giggled.

Yu Le Ping’s face sank and he shouted, “How dare you insult me?!”

She Lan said, “This Mistress is just speaking the truth. If you are not a fool, then why would you jump onto another person’s ship?”

Man Kuai also coldly snorted from the side, “Do you think this is Clear Sky Island?”

Yu Le Ping’s face changed when he heard these words as he finally realized that his situation wasn’t good. He had been used to throwing his weight around on Clear Sky Island and everyone was always afraid of him there, so he unconsciously brought that domineering air out to sea, thinking that no one would dare to disobey him and not give him face.

But now, it seems that wasn’t the case at all. Without the protection of the City Lord’s Mansion, he was nothing more than a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator.

Even if something happened out here in the empty sea, nobody would know about it.

Noticing the ill-will in Man Kuai’s eyes, Yu Le Ping was shocked and he quickly said, “Wait! This King only came for this little brat!” He pointed a hand at Yang Kai, “This King has a grudge with him. If you hand him to me, I will return to Clear Sky Island immediately!”

She Lan sighed and shook her head, “Sir Yu, you are so silly and naive. I can’t even bear to hurt you anymore.”
