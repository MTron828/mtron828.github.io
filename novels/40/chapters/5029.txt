This plant was similar to a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit Tree at first glance, but upon closer look, one would realise they were not the same. Instead, it was a different kind of Spirit Fruit Tree.

The manual given to Yang Kai by Bai Yi had a detailed comparison between the two fruit trees, so he could instantly tell the difference.

Although the fruits were not Profound Yin Spirit Fruits, they were very rare as well, so he carefully picked the fruits and transferred the tree to the medicine garden in his Small Universe.

Since long ago, Yang Kai had planted a lot of precious Spirit Herbs inside his personal medicine garden. With the help of Mu Zhu and Mu Lu, who were from the Wood Spirit Clan, the Spirit Herbs in the medicine garden flourished.

Additionally, the flow of time in his Small Universe was four times faster than in the outside world, so the Spirit Herbs in the medicine garden matured much more rapidly.

After the fruit tree was moved to his medicine garden, it would not have any trouble surviving with the two Wood Spirits tending to it; however, Yang Kai was not able to determine when the tree would bear fruits again.

As he continued exploring the Sealed World, Yang Kai found even more Spirit Herbs. He would move the plants into his Small Universe if he was able to do so, and for the ones that couldn’t be transplanted, he would carefully pick their fruits or flowers.

A few days later, he had gained quite a harvest.

He believed that Bai Yi had also acquired a large number of valuable items. The environment in this Sealed World seemed quite suitable for the growth of Spirit Herbs. It was difficult to find Sealed Worlds that were so full of precious Spirit Medicines like this one.

When Yang Kai was looking around one day, he suddenly felt World Force undulating in a place that was several dozen kilometres away from him. The next moment, a deafening noise was heard.

His expression changed as he manipulated Space Principles and disappeared from the spot.

When he reappeared, he was already beside Bai Yi.

He immediately released his Divine Sense to inspect the surroundings, but he couldn’t detect any danger. Staring at the young woman, he asked, “What’s going on?”

Bai Yi frowned and pointed at the dense forest in front of her, “As I was exploring this area, I think I triggered some kind of restriction.”

The noise he had heard just now was the result of Bai Yi activating her World Force in order to protect herself.

“A restriction?” Yang Kai was shocked.

It had been a few days since they entered this Sealed World. Not only were they safe, but they had also acquired a lot of valuable Spirit Herbs. While Yang Kai didn’t come across any danger, Bai Yi accidentally triggered a restriction.

A restriction could either be man-made or naturally formed. It wouldn’t have mattered if it was the latter; however, if it was the former, the speculation Cha Hu had about the origin of the Sealed Worlds on the Black Ink Battlefield would basically be confirmed.

Yang Kai quickly looked in the same direction and saw a dense forest. Nevertheless, the sight before his eyes was somewhat surreal as an almost indiscernible ripple spread across the forest.

There was indeed a restriction here! However, the restriction was so ancient that it no longer functioned smoothly. Following Bai Yi’s attack, a weakness in the restriction was revealed. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Kai slowly closed his eyes, and when he reopened them, his left pupil had turned golden. The golden light radiating from his eye was majestic, and it was able to see through all the falsities in the world.

The Demon Eye of Annihilation from Myriad Demons Cave Heaven was most useful in this kind of situation.

With the help of the Demon Eye of Annihilation, the sight before his eyes changed into something else entirely and Yang Kai couldn’t help exclaiming in excitement.

Bai Yi quickly asked, “Have you found anything, Senior Brother?”

Yang Kai nodded gently, “There are dilapidated Illusion and Killing Arrays here. They’re both clearly man-made.”

As he spoke, he extended his hand and World Force billowed from his palm into the forest in a regular pattern.

The person who set up these Arrays was quite skilful at his craft. If the Illusion Array and Killing Array had still been intact, Yang Kai wouldn’t have been able to notice a weakness in them even after using his Demon Eye of Annihilation, let alone have a chance to crack them.

However, the restriction left behind here was too dated. Even though it was still operating, its power had been greatly reduced.

Weaknesses were everywhere as Yang Kai scanned this restriction with the Demon Eye of Annihilation. Once he found these weaknesses, he could easily expand them despite not being an expert in Dao of Spirit Arrays.

Barely a cup of tea later, the dense forest in front of them shattered and disappeared into nothingness.

The sight was replaced by a medicine garden where there were countless rare plants.

They could see more than ten Profound Yin Spirit Fruit Trees at first glance, red Profound Yin Spirit Fruits hanging from their branches.

Yang Kai and Bai Yi were pleasantly surprised.

They exchanged glances as they couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

The herbs in this medicine garden easily numbered ten times what Yang Kai had obtained over the past few days, and that was not even counting the extremely rare Profound Yin Spirit Fruit Trees.

One gigantic tree stood tall in the middle of the medicine garden, making it especially conspicuous. This gigantic tree also gave off a sense of familiarity to Yang Kai for some reason.

“Senior Brother, could this be an Illusion Array as well?” Bai Yi asked in a dazed state.

Yang Kai burst into laughter, “We’ll find out if this is an Illusion Array soon enough.”

They then stepped into the medicine garden. The longer they explored it, the more joyful they became. Certainly, everything in this medicine garden was real, not illusory. All these Spirit Herbs had extremely high medicinal ages which gave them potent medicinal efficacies. Even though most of the herbs had already been recorded in the manual made by the Alchemists from the Inner Sanctum, there were still some that were unknown.

In other words, these herbs had never been found on the Black Ink Battlefield before. Even the Alchemists of Blue Sky Pass were not aware of their existence.

These were the ancient herbs that only existed in this medicine garden and could never be found in the outside world.

After some quick calculations, the pair realised that there were several thousand Spirit Herbs that they could or could not recognise. They had found more than 20 Profound Yin Spirit Fruit Trees alone, each of them having between 3 to 8 ripe fruits.

There were also a number of empty spots in the garden which Yang Kai figured had originally been herbs; however, they had died out after a long period of negligence.

A sense of regret overwhelmed Yang Kai. He had no idea what those dead Spirit Herbs were, but everything in this medicine garden was rare and precious, so it was a shame that they were gone.

Finally, he stood in front of the huge tree in the middle of the medicine garden and looked up in a dazed state.

Bai Yi appeared beside him and said, “Senior Brother, it seems that the Sealed Worlds on the Black Ink Battlefield were really formed from the ancient Great Experts’ Small Universes after their death.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Yes, and this particular Sealed World we’re in was left behind by an Alchemist.”

“How do you know?” Bai Yi was puzzled.

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “Only an Alchemist would spend so much time and energy to grow such a large medicine garden in their Small Universe.”

He came to this conclusion after considering his own experiences. The average cultivator who knew nothing about the Alchemic Dao wouldn’t know how to nurture Spirit Herbs properly. Yang Kai had Mu Zhu and Mu Lu to help him out, and he had studied the Alchemic Dao in the past, which was why he still had a medicine garden in his Small Universe.

The average cultivator would have killed these rare herbs if he really transplanted them to their Small Universe without knowing how to care for them.

Since this Sealed World was left behind by an Alchemist, the environment was naturally suitable for the growth of Spirit Herbs. That was the reason they had gained quite a lot of rewards as they explored this place.

However, their previous gains were nothing compared to the precious herbs in this medicine garden.

This medicine garden was the biggest prize.

“This Alchemist truly treasured his medicine garden. He might have set them up himself or employed someone to arrange powerful Arrays around this medicine garden to protect it; however, since he was an Alchemist, he probably knew little about fighting. After he was killed in a battle, his Small Universe must have collapsed. This medicine garden was saved with the restriction’s protection. We just happened to come across it and gain all the benefits.”

Upon hearing that, Bai Yi nodded, “You have a point, Senior Brother.” She then gazed at the gigantic tree, “Can you recognise this tree?”

She was curious about why Yang Kai had been standing in front of this giant tree for a long time now.

Yang Kai’s face twitched as he nodded, “Yes.”

“What tree is it?”

Yang Kai let out a breath, “You’ve probably heard of it, but you don’t recognise it because you have never seen it before. It’s a World Tree!”

Upon hearing that, Bai Yi was astonished, “The World Tree? Did you just say it’s the World Tree?” She suddenly recalled something, “Wait a moment, Senior Brother. It’s said that the World Tree is hidden in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. There was a Senior from Divine Feather Paradise who entered the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary before and heard stories about the World Tree, but he never saw it in person. Could the rumours be false?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “The World Tree is indeed hidden in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. The rumours that Senior of yours heard weren’t false. I’ve been to the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary and had the chance to see the World Tree.”

“Then, the one in front of us…” Bai Yi was puzzled. The World Tree was a one-of-a-kind existence. Since it was still in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, why would it appear in this place?

Yang Kai patted the thick trunk of the World Tree, “It’s certainly not the Mother tree. It’s just a clone of the World Tree. Obviously, the owner of this Sealed World was lucky enough to have obtained a root from the World Tree and then planted it in his Small Universe. It has grown to such a scale over the years.”

“A clone?”

“Yes, a clone!” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly, “In the past, I had the luck to acquire a root from the World Tree. At that time, my homeland was on the brink of collapse, so I planted the World Tree’s root there to ensure its survival. Moreover, with the existence of the World Tree’s clone, my homeland became the most important Universe World in the 3,000 Worlds. The Cave Heavens and Paradises all send many of their young and talented disciples there to be nurtured by it.”

“Why is that?” Bai Yi was perplexed.

Yang Kai explained, “It’s natural that you don’t know about it, Junior Sister. Although the World Tree in my homeland is just a clone, the people living there can reap immense benefits from the tree’s nourishment. By cultivating in that special environment from a young age, one’s innate talent can be increased and they can more easily condense a firmer Dao Seal. Now, there are a lot of people in my homeland who are capable of directly ascending to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. There are even quite a number who can directly make it to the Seventh Order.”
