Chapter 1776, Shocking Gui Zu

“By the way, Yang Boy,” While waiting for the Seven Coloured Radiant Light to retreat, Gui Zu casually asked, “This old master noticed you have quite a deep knowledge of spirit medicines and herbs. Have you studied Alchemy, perhaps?”

Although the pair had only harvested Divine Nirvana Fruits and a Demon Melting Iris so far, Yang Kai had been able to quickly identify these herbs, how to properly preserve them, and which pills could be refined from them, speaking about all of it clearly and confidently. Naturally, Gui Zu would become suspicious.

“En!” Yang Kai nodded, not trying to deny it.

“Oh?” Gui Zu looked at Yang Kai in amazement, “In this short thirty or forty year period, you managed to grow from the Saint Realm all the way to the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm. That was surprising enough for this old master, but now you say you also had time to study Alchemy? Are you not afraid you will delay your cultivation by pursuing too many diverse fields?”

Yang Kai chuckled and replied, “My original intention of studying Alchemy was as an auxiliary to my cultivation, the pursuit of the peak of the Martial Dao has always been my priority.”

“Very good,” Gui Zu looked at him approvingly, “Alchemy, Artifact Refining, arranging Spirit Arrays, although each of these fields is of great importance, none are comparable to the Martial Dao. Cultivation should always be one’s priority, everything else can only serve as supplementals to it.”

Regarding Gui Zu’s opinion, Yang Kai naturally nodded in agreement.

“En, but that being said, if you can achieve something in any of these three domains, it is still a remarkable accomplishment,” Gui Zu was satisfied with Yang Kai’s attitude, smiled, and asked curiously, “Do you mind telling this old master what grade of pills you can refine now?”

Hearing his question, Yang Kai thought about it seriously before solemnly replying, “Since it is Senior asking, this Junior won’t conceal anything. En, this Junior can be regarded as an Origin King Grade Alchemist and can refine Origin King Grade Spirit Pills!”

As soon as these words were spoken, Gui Zu’s body shook violently as he stared straight at Yang Kai without speaking for quite some time.

“Senior?” Yang Kai gave a dry laugh when he saw the reaction he was expecting from Gui Zu. After all, how many Origin King Grade Alchemists were there in the entire Star Field? Which of those Alchemists was not grey-haired and extremely famous? At Yang Kai’s age, it should have simply been impossible to become an Origin King Grade Alchemist.

Gui Zu was silent for a long time before taking a deep breath and asking in a shaky voice, “Are you making a joke?”

He thought Yang Kai was playing a prank on him at first, but after observing him for some time and not seeing the slightest signs that Yang Kai was joking, he began to suspect that perhaps... he might be telling the truth.

“No!” Yang Kai shook his head.

“You’re really an Origin King Grade Alchemist!?” Gui Zu exclaimed and after speaking, immediately swept his eyes around, as if he was afraid someone might have heard him shout just now.

“How could this Junior joke about such a matter? En, although I have only refined a few Origin King Grade Spirit Pills, I have indeed refined some. According to the Star Field’s method of classifying Alchemists, this Junior should be regarded as an Origin King Grade Alchemist.”

Gui Zu took another deep breath as he stared at Yang Kai like some strange monster.

Yang Kai was not old, he possessed such high cultivation, and now he also seemed to be an Origin King Grade Alchemist! How did he do it? Even if he began cultivating in his mother’s womb, it should have been impossible to achieve this, right? Only if he had somehow managed to split himself into a dozen clones that could cultivate independently would something this absurdity be possible.

Gui Zu absolutely could not understand!

“There are very few people who know I am an Origin King Grade Alchemist. Besides my women and family, only Senior knows, so I hope Senior can keep it a secret for me,” Yang Kai grinned.

Yang Kai usually concealed his identity as an Alchemist because he lacked strength and had to worry about others trying to take advantage of him.

But now that his strength had reached such a height, exposing his identity as an Alchemist would not cause him any trouble; on the contrary, being known as an Origin King Grade Alchemist would bring huge benefits, so Yang Kai didn’t intend to hide it from his acquaintances if they asked.

Hearing this, Gui Zu nodded and said in a serious tone, “This old master knows what he should do, he won’t spread such information about. What’s more, this old master doesn’t have any associates, so how could he do something as dull as bragging to strangers about another’s accomplishments? However... Kid, why did you just tell this old master the truth? Aren’t you afraid this old master would act against you? You should know just how attractive an Origin King Grade Alchemist is to people like this old master. If one can capture such an Alchemist and force them to refine pills for them, improving one’s strength becomes easy.”

“Haha, Senior is not such a person,” Yang Kai touched his nose. “If I wasn’t confident in Senior’s character, I wouldn’t have told the truth. Besides, between offending an Origin King Grade Alchemist and befriending one, Senior surely understands which is the wiser choice. Even if you were to capture me and force me to perform Alchemy for you, you would constantly need to worry about poison being hidden in the pills I refined for you.”

Saying so, Yang Kai grinned at Gui Zu.

He had chosen to tell the truth to Gui Zu after some consideration, not on a whim.

Gui Zu stared at Yang Kai deeply for a long time before suddenly bursting into laughter, “Hahaha! This old master is deeply honoured. En, I never expected that a little brat this old master almost completely wrote off in the past would not only have such profound cultivation but also become an Origin King Grade Alchemist! If this kind of matter were to spread, it would only be giving this old master face.”

“Senior surely jests,” Yang Kai said modestly.

“En, then regarding that Great Nirvana Pill and Demon Vanquishing Pill you mentioned before, can you refine them?” Gui Zu asked nervously.

The Great Nirvana Pill could improve his cultivation while the Demon Vanquishing Pill could suppress his heart demons, both of which were of great use to him. He originally planned to go out to find an Origin King Grade Alchemist in the Star Field to request Alchemy from.

But this would undoubtedly cost him a huge price and would likely take many years; after all, which of these Alchemy Grandmasters wasn’t highly sought after? These were not masters one could simply take raw materials to and then expect a pill from, everything depended on the other party’s schedule.

Due to Gui Zu’s unique circumstances, he was not familiar with all the procedures around such things, but he at least understood common sense. With his cultivation, he may have to agree to some harsh conditions such as helping a certain Alchemy Grandmaster kill someone or take a huge risk to obtain some precious material before the other party would even consider accepting his request for Alchemy.

Even an Origin King like him may not necessarily be able to bear the price that these Grandmasters demanded.

But now, there was an Origin King Grade Alchemist in front of him, and one he had a good relationship with.

Gui Zu was so happy he wanted to shout!

He secretly rejoiced in his heart that he had not killed Yang Kai back then and even offered him thanks for his life-saving grace, forging a kind of friendship with him. Fortunately, in the Severed World this time, he had been genial with Yang Kai at every turn!

Gui Zu suddenly felt that befriending Yang Kai was the wisest decision he had ever made in his life.

“The Great Nirvana Pill and Demon Vanquishing Pill are both Origin King Grade Spirit Pills, so neither is easy to refine, but as long as you can obtain the other ingredients, I should be able to give it a try,” Yang Kai thought about it carefully before nodding.

“What chance do you have to succeed?” Gui Zu hurriedly asked.

“At least sixty percent.”

“Sixty percent!” Gui Zu drew a sharp breath as he realized he was still underestimating Yang Kai. Origin King Grade Spirit Pills were extremely difficult to refine, and the failure rate was surprisingly high. Even most famous Alchemy Grandmasters would not dare guarantee a sixty percent success rate.

Yang Kai was also not the kind to idly boast. Gui Zu was well acquainted with this boy’s stable temperament, so he did not doubt him. Since Yang Kai said he had a sixty percent chance to succeed, he meant sixty percent.

“But...” Yang Kai suddenly laughed.

“But what,” Gui Zu’s heart tightened once more. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“If Senior wants to refine the Great Nirvana Pill and Demon Vanquishing Pill, this Junior can recommend another person, she has far more exquisite skill in Alchemy. If she takes action, the success rate will be higher.”

*Si...*

Gui Zu audibly inhaled as he stared at Yang Kai incredulously, “Do you know another Origin King Grade Alchemist? Right, you should have been taught by some famous Grandmaster, could it be you’re referring to your Honoured Master?”

As Gui Zu spoke, his eyes flashed with brilliant light.

Yang Kai’s Honoured Master was definitely an Origin King Grade Alchemist, and definitely superior to Yang Kai. Gui Zu definitely wanted to befriend such a person. As long as he could form a friendship with such a Grandmaster, he would be able to ask for high-grade pills at any point in the future. At that point, how could he not benefit enormously?

Gui Zu had secretly made up his mind that after this trip to the Severed World, he needed to visit Yang Kai’s Honoured Master.

How many Origin King Grade masters wanted to meet with such an Alchemy Grandmaster but had no way to, yet now Gui Zu had a chance to meet two! Gui Zu almost felt his heart burst from his chest.

“No,” Yang Kai shook his head, “The person I’m referring to is my Senior Sister!”

He was speaking about Xia Ning Chang!

Although her Alchemy skills were not as good as his when Yang Kai brought Xia Ning Chang out from Tong Xuan Realm, he was confident that her Alchemy skills had already surpassed his after practising for so many years with the near-unlimited supply of herbs High Heaven Sect provided her, as well as the True Alchemy Enlightenment Scripture guiding her, and the Special Constitution that allowed her to comprehend everything about Alchemy.

“Your Senior Sister is also an Origin King Grade Alchemist?” Gui Zu was shocked.

Didn’t that mean... that there were three Alchemy Grandmasters at this level in one single group? How Heaven defying was that!?

Gui Zu hardly dared to imagine what kind of Sect could possess three Origin King Grade Alchemists! With such powerful support, how could this Sect ever lack for high-grade pills?

If this kind of news were to spread, Gui Zu was certain it would set off great waves across the entire Star Field. Even giants such as the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, Purple Star, and Sword Union would definitely send people to win over the Sect Yang Kai belonged to.

After all, even these three great forces did not all have their own Origin King Grade Alchemist! Among the three, only Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce and Purple Star had one each, while Sword Union did not have one in its employ.
