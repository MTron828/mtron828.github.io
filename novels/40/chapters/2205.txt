Qiong Qi had seen something in Zhang Ruo Xi that Yang Kai didn’t know about...

There was also the Space Spirit Jade. Why had it only reacted to Zhang Ruo Xi? And what was the scene that had flashed before his eyes back when the jade activated?

Zhang Ruo Xi didn’t know about her situation either, so Yang Kai couldn’t find out by asking her.

How could he possibly underestimate someone filled with such profound secrets that even Qiong Qi was willing to save and protect her?

Yang Kai could only hope that Zhang Ruo Xi’s strength would quickly rise. Perhaps she would figure her secrets out on her own once she became strong enough.

Since Zhang Ruo Xi was cultivating, Yang Kai didn’t disturb her. Instead, he flashed straight over to Hua Qing Si’s building.

He didn’t make a sound when he appeared, but it seemed like Hua Qing Si sensed something and slightly furrowed her dainty brow. Opening her beautiful eyes, she couldn’t help glaring at Yang Kai slightly while saying, “You should say something when you arrive. You almost scared me to death.”

“I didn’t know that you were such a scaredy-cat,” Yang Kai smiled widely.

“The Four Seasons Realm... has it closed?” Hua Qing Si asked contemplatively.

“En.” Yang Kai nodded.

“How was your harvest?”

“Okay.”

Hua Qing Si couldn’t help but spit disdainfully as she spoke, “It’s obvious that you’re not telling the truth. Did you get something good?”

Yang Kai smiled, “En, something.”

As he spoke, he took out a round, white, and flawless Spirit Pill and held it between two fingers.

“That’s...” Hua Qing Si focused with her pretty eyes upon the Spirit Pill with a blank look of confusion.

Although she didn’t recognize the Spirit Pill or what it was used for, she instinctively felt that something was amazing about it and that it was highly likely to be an incredibly rare item.

“Do you want it?” Yang Kai’s mouth arched upwards in a subtle grin as he spoke.

“With our current relationship, and the condition where you can kill me at any time, plus with this Spirit Pill’s colour and scent, I don’t think that it’s poison or that it’s anything bad for me because there’s no need for you to do such a thing. In that case, this Spirit Pill must really be useful for me, right?” Hua Qing Si began to carefully analyze the situation instead of immediately answering Yang Kai’s question, “I’m already a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, which is only a step away from the Emperor Realm. There are very few Spirit Pills in the world that will be highly useful to me, and... I’ve never seen or even heard of this type of Spirit Pill in your hand right now...”

Hua Qing Si’s beautiful eyes gradually lit up as she spoke, “The only explanation then is that this Spirit Pill is the type that only exists in legend...” She couldn’t help but begin to breathe rapidly, “I want it! I want it, hurry and give it to me!”

However, Yang Kai didn’t immediately give it to her, instead just looking over her with a teasing expression before muttering aloud, “Is it really good for a woman to say such words?”

“Go to hell!” Hua Qing Si’s face became red from the teasing as she glared at Yang Kai while gritting her teeth, “Are you giving it to me or not?”

Yang Kai smiled slightly and refrained from teasing her further before tossing the Spirit Pill over.

Hua Qing Si happily caught the pill. She first put it right in front of her eyes to carefully observe it, but she still couldn’t tell anything about it, so then she went up to sniff it and even used her pink tongue to gently lick it...

“Is there a need for this...?” Yang Kai had dark lines appearing on his forehead as he watched, “Can’t you just directly eat it?”

“Just what kind of Spirit Pill is this?” Hua Qing Si raised her head and asked.

“Extraordinary Treasure Pill!”

Hua Qing Si immediately froze upon hearing this as her beautiful eyes began to violently tremble while she stared at Yang Kai in disbelief.

“You know what it is?” Yang Kai was rather surprised as he looked at her.

Back in the Four Seasons Realm, many cultivators hadn’t known about the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus and Extraordinary Treasure Pill. It was only thanks to Lan Xun’s explanation that everyone realized how precious they were.

However, it was obvious from Hua Qing Si’s reaction that she knew what it was.

“Of course I know about it...” Hua Qing Si answered as if it was natural while her voice trembled slightly, “This is the extremely famous... Extraordinary Treasure Pill, which might not appear even once in ten thousand years!”

She wasn’t exaggerating about this.

Although the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus might appear every once in a while, it was extremely difficult to get an Extraordinary Treasure Pill, because the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus’s medicinal effects would disappear unless it was eaten or made into a pill within three hours.

Two conditions must be met in order for an Extraordinary Treasure Pill to be created.

The appearance of an Extraordinary Treasure Lotus!

At the same time, a highly skilled Alchemist must also be nearby!

It was highly difficult for both conditions to be met simultaneously, to the extent where it wouldn’t happen even once in ten thousand years. Even if it happened, the Alchemist present still needed to have the necessary adjuvants on hand and not fail in the refinement.

Such mishaps had indeed happened in history before. An Alchemist had been under too much pressure when creating the Extraordinary Treasure Pill, which then led to a failure in refinement.

It could thus be seen that Extraordinary Treasure Pills were both precious and difficult to obtain.

“You really are quite knowledgeable,” Yang Kai smiled widely.

“Where did you obtain this? The Flowing Time Temple actually had something like this?” Hua Qing Si was still truly shocked and was unable to restore her emotions to normal for quite some time.

“I refined it myself,” Yang Kai replied casually.

“You’re also an alchemist?” Hua Qing Si’s expression instantly became rather strange.

“What? I can’t be?” Yang Kai answered with some displeasure before urging her, “Why are you still holding it? Hurry up and eat it. You’re currently at the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, so perhaps you can break through to the Emperor Realm soon after swallowing it.”

“You’re really giving this to me?” Although Hua Qing Si was asking this, her hand clenched really tightly to the Extraordinary Treasure Pill.

“Why would I take this out if I wasn’t giving it to you?” Yang Kai laughed at her silly question before thinking about it a bit and deciding to explain, “Let me put it this way, you gave me your Soul Brand and now I don’t need to fear you betraying me or exposing my secrets. That means the stronger you are, the more useful you are to me, so I also want you to reach the Emperor Realm as quickly as possible so that later, when I travel around the world, if someone I don’t like appears, I can let you out to bite them.”

“Am I a dog...?” At first, Hua Qing Si’s pretty face showed her gratitude, but the more she listened, the colder her expression became, almost to the point that it frosted over.

“Stop wasting time and just eat it already!” Yang Kai coldly snorted.

“I finally understand what kind of person you are!” Hua Qing Si gave him a sidelong glance as she chuckled meaningfully, “You have a sharp tongue but a soft heart. You want to apologize for all the terrible things you’ve done to me, but you’re afraid your image will break down and you’ll lose your dominant status if you just come out and say so, so you spout vicious lines to disguise your intent instead.”

“Keep talking and I’ll strip you naked and toss you outside!” Yang Kai snapped at her threateningly, as he became angry out of embarrassment.

“Go ahead!” A faint red blush appeared on Hua Qing Si’s face, but she refused to act weak and even stuck out her chest and talked back to Yang Kai, “If you dare to do that, then I’ll announce to the whole world that I’m your woman, and watch just how much of a cuckold you become!”

“So vicious?” Yang Kai went pale with astonishment. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Hehehe!” Hua Qing Si laughed happily, “If you’re afraid, then obediently call me Elder Sister, and I might magnanimously show mercy and spare you!”

“Fine, you win!” Yang Kai retorted angrily before clenching his teeth and exiting the Sealed World Bead.

He was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to take it anymore if he had to keep dealing with this crazy woman.

“Don’t go, I’m not done talking yet!” Hua Qing Si hurriedly called out to him, but there was no reaction.

Quite a while later, she finally licked her red lips and glanced at the Extraordinary Treasure Pill in her hand as she mumbled to herself, “Now that I look back, if it wasn’t for me witnessing a few of his secrets back then, I wouldn’t have fallen to this current situation... but, it was also because of falling here that I managed to get this Extraordinary Treasure Pill. Fortune and misfortune really do go hand in hand. Forget it, for this one Spirit Pill alone, what does it matter if he imprisons me here for a hundred years?”

She suddenly smiled slightly as she said this.

Although she was now a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, she had no confidence she would be able to break through to the Emperor Realm any time soon. Cultivation completely relied on solid accumulation over time that came from gradual improvement.

But, until now, she had never managed to grasp the method to break through her bottleneck and touch the Emperor Realm’s secrets. Back at Star Soul Palace, she had also taken the chance to ask some of the Masters in the palace, but none of them were able to give her a satisfactory answer or guide her down a well-lit path.

She secretly felt that if she didn’t receive any special opportunity in this lifetime, it would be impossible for her to reach the Emperor Realm.

But now, this incredibly rare chance had suddenly dropped onto her lap.

It was natural for Hua Qing Si to feel excited inside.

She knew of the Extraordinary Treasure Pill precisely because she felt there was no hope for her to reach the Emperor Realm on her own, leading her to study many ancient books in Star Soul Palace while hoping to find some method to help herself.

All of the ancient books she studied, however, had mentioned the ‘Extraordinary Treasure Pill‘!

According to those ancient books, this was a Spirit Pill that could all but guarantee one broke through to the Emperor Realm as long their aptitude and effort weren’t too lacking.

What cultivator would possibly lack aptitude after cultivating to Third-Order Dao Source Realm though, so saying it was a certainty wasn’t an exaggeration.

For instance, someone like Xia Sheng or Wu Chang might rise to Emperor Realm within five, or even two to three years after eating this pill. Someone with slightly worse aptitude might take ten or twenty years... but what did it matter even if it took a hundred years?

It was worth waiting any amount of time as long as one could reach the Emperor Realm.

This was a tremendous gift.

Hua Qing Si thought she would be a lowly servant to Yang Kai for life after being forced to surrender her Soul Brand, never having expected that he would give her such a precious Spirit Pill like this.

His generosity and openness were beyond her expectations.

After some thought, Hua Qing Si no longer hesitated as immediately stuffed the Extraordinary Treasure Pill into her mouth.

Since she already knew about the Extraordinary Treasure Pill, she naturally knew that the sooner one ate it, the better.

After she ate the Spirit Pill, she immediately sat down cross-legged and silently began to cultivate to refine the medicinal efficacies.

At the same time, Yang Kai appeared with a wretched look on his face in the palace on Soaring Swallow Peak, grumbling and cursing under his breath in frustration.

Back when he refined that furnace of Extraordinary Treasure Pills, unlike what he told the crowd, he hadn’t refined just four pills, but five!

Back during the Pill Tribulation, Liu Yan had taken all the Extraordinary Treasure Pills and hid them inside the Sealed World Bead. After the Pill Tribulation was dispersed, and before everyone regained their senses, Yang Kai had secretly put four pills back without anyone noticing.
