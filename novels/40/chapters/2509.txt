After merging with the entire Small Sealed World, Yang Kai’s presumptions were confirmed.

The Small Sealed World was extremely eager to use the imprisoned World Force to repair its broken parts; this was the will of the Small Sealed World.

It was like the instinctive reaction of an injured person at the sight of a healing pill.

Yang Kai was delighted but kept his composure, his expression as tranquil as an ancient well as he closed his eyes tightly while his hands were constantly performing mysterious seals.

He did not even know what these seals were at first as his body was acting on instinct at the moment, merely allowing the Small Sealed World’s will to guide his actions.

He blasted a series of imprints towards the imprisoned World Force hovering above, and soon, the cloud of light was thoroughly surrounded by a strange set of runic patterns.

At the same time, the struggling World Force seemed to have resigned itself to its fate and stopped struggling.

At a certain moment, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes and yelled in a low voice, “Release!”

With this shout, the imprisoned World Force abruptly exploded, turning into smaller streams of light, like a firework explosion, extremely dazzling. It broke down into countless points of light, flying to every corner of the Small Sealed World.

The streams of light scattered, seeping into the Small Sealed World and disappearing one after another.

The broken Small Sealed World buzzed in enthusiasm, as if it had been greatly nourished.

The damaged parts of the world stopped collapsing, the ground and sky separated again, and the chaos calmed.

As time passed, the ravines on the ground closed up, and the devastation began to reverse. An inexplicable trace of inspiring vitality danced around the lifeless Small Sealed World.

The large amount of Shattered Source Strength that had been devoured from the Source Sea before seemed to have undergone some wonderful transformation and was now quickly merging into the Small Sealed World, turning into strands of clear World Principles, strengthening the foundation of the Small Sealed World.

The wind rose, the clouds gathered and rubbed together to create the sound of thunder as lightning flashed and rain began to fall, urging buds to grow.

The Small Sealed World seemed to have resurrected and was now filled with overflowing vitality. Even the exotic flowers and plants growing in the medicine garden were beginning to sway in vigour.

It was unknown how much time this entire process took.

When the dust settled, Yang Kai suddenly felt that his mind was cut off from the Small Sealed World, and he woke up from that wondrous feeling.

Looking around, the Small Sealed World seemed to still be the same, but the bleakness was gone; instead, it seemed to have evolved for the better. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Yang Kai could clearly sense that the World Principles in the Small Sealed World were more complete. Although it could not be compared to a true world, it was much better than before.

[Could the World Force have allowed the Small Sealed World to evolve?] Yang Kai raised his brow in delight.

Yang Kai had always known that his Small Sealed World was not perfect, but he did not know how to enhance it to bring it closer to perfection. However, Yang Kai seemed to have discovered some useful information after this experience.

If just a stream of World Force could cause such big changes to the Small Sealed World, to the point where even the World Principles had improved so much, would it be possible to continue to improve the Small Sealed World if more World Force was taken in?

By that time, this place would turn into a cultivation paradise, where World Energy Baptisms would be possible even if one reached the peak of the Dao Source Realm and needed to break through to the Emperor Realm.

However, World Force was incredibly hard to come by and could not even be sensed before reaching the Great Emperor Realm, so Yang Kai could only lament at his own limitations with his current First-Order Emperor Realm cultivation.

However, Yang Kai was still very excited about this newly discovered solution.

He thoroughly inspected the Small Sealed World again and found that it was indeed free from hidden dangers, and was even better than before. Yang Kai was really relieved.

Liu Yan’s condition was still unknown, however.

With a thought, he escaped from the Small Sealed World and returned to the outside world.

“Big Brother Yang.”

Mo Xiao Qi’s voice reached his ear as soon as he reappeared.

Yang Kai turned to the source of the voice and found that both Mo Xiao Qi and Zhang Ruo Xi had awoken and looked to be in good condition, free of any lingering negative effects.

With a slight smile, Yang Kai acknowledged, “You’re up.”

“Big Brother Yang, are we in the Purple Mountain Range? Did the Shattered Star Sea close? What happened after that? Who reapplied the Divine Soul Seal? I didn’t hurt you, right?” She launched a torrent of questions, looking quite anxious and uneasy.

It seemed that she knew the release of the Divine Soul Seal was related to her losing her consciousness, but she had no impression of what happened after that.

Yang Kai glanced at the Embodiment standing not far away in bewilderment, “Why didn’t you explain to her?”

The Embodiment shrugged, “They just woke up, I haven’t had the time to.”

Yang Kai nodded, and briefly recited the happenings after her rampage. Of course, he did not dare to mention the battle between Duan Hong Chen and Wu Kuang as that was too terrifying an incident to be mentioned casually. In the end, he could only say he was not sure why the Shattered Star Sea suddenly closed.

Mo Xiao Qi patted her chest in fear as she listened and sighed, “I’m glad that I didn’t hurt any of you, otherwise Xiao Qi wouldn’t know how to face you again.”

Yang Kai cautioned solemnly, “Don’t release the seal casually in the future, the power of that Divine Spirit is just too terrifying, and you wouldn’t be able to control it with your current strength.”

Mo Xiao Qi nodded in remorse, “En.”

Zhang Ruo Xi interjected at the brief moment of silence, “Sir, what’s happening to Big Sister Liu Yan? Why is her aura so weak?” She glanced anxiously in the direction of Liu Yan.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to investigate the situation, and found that there had not been many changes to the Phoenix Egg since he left, so he consoled quickly, “This is her opportunity, don’t worry.”

He glanced at Zhang Ruo Xi solemnly as he spoke.

Yang Kai went through too many shocking and extraordinary experiences in the Shattered Star Sea, whether it was the Mountains and Rivers Bell or the Phoenix True Fire, or the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, who had come back from the dead, or the Bustling World Great Emperor who cut his own cultivation dozens of times over the past few tens of thousands of years. All these experiences were extraordinary.

However, what puzzled him the most was Zhang Ruo Xi.

All Duan Hong Chen needed was a drop of Zhang Ruo Xi’s Blood Essence to reapply Mo Xiao Qi’s Divine Soul Seal, and his particular caution towards Zhang Ruo Xi had made Yang Kai extremely concerned.

The Bustling World Great Emperor had instructed Yang Kai to nurture Zhang Ruo Xi well, because at her peak, she would be even more dangerous and terrifying than Wu Kuang, and may cause a calamity to the Star Boundary if she ever fell to the wicked path.

Yang Kai would just assume that Duan Hong Chen was an alarmist and his claims about Zhang Ruo Xi were exaggerated since he did not know Duan Hong Chen’s true identity.

But there was no reason for a person who disregarded his own life for the Star Boundary’s future to cause Yang Kai needless fear.

What Bloodline Power did this little girl from the Zhang Family possess that Duan Hong Chen was so concerned about? On top of that, the Divine Spirit Qiong Qi even gifted her the Pink Clouds Phoenix Robe when they visited the Flowing Time Temple.

No ordinary person could have this kind of honour. Anyone who encountered a beast-like Qiong Qi would be swallowed by it. Who would have expected that one could receive a defensive Emperor Artifact from it?

It also seemed that only descendants from the Zhang Family could activate the strange Space Spirit Jade.

Speaking of the Space Spirit Jade, Yang Kai suddenly felt that it was time to give it to Zhang Ruo Xi; after all, it was a treasure passed down by the ancestors of the Zhang Family. She was not strong enough to unlock the secrets in the Space Spirit Jade back then, but she was now a Third-Order Dao Source Realm, so unravelling the secrets of the Space Spirit Jade should not be a problem.

Yang Kai did not really care about the secrets hidden in the Space Spirit Jade, but… perhaps, it may solve the mystery of Zhang Ruo Xi’s Bloodline Power. Yang Kai could not help feeling a little eager at that thought.

The more Duan Hong Chen hid, the more it piqued Yang Kai’s interest to understand Zhang Ruo Xi’s bloodline.

“Sir… Why are you staring at me?” Zhang Ruo Xi lowered her head, blushing slightly at Yang Kai’s scorching stare, as if he was about to devour her.

Yang Kai grinned and commented, “Ruo Xi has grown up to be a lady.”

Compared to the first time he met Zhang Ruo Xi, she had indeed grown a lot, and she was with Yang Kai during the best of her young years, so it was safe to say that Yang Kai had watched her mature.

This reminded him of Lin Yun’er, the little girl who travelled to the Star Boundary with Yang Yan. She was still young when she left, but by now, she should be almost as old as Zhang Ruo Xi.

He remembered that Yang Yan mentioned that Lin Yun’er was the perfect candidate to inherit the mantle of her friend. He wondered about the whereabouts of this little girl after so many years.

As well as Yang Yan. It was strange that Yang Kai had not heard any news regarding Yang Yan ever since he arrived at Star Boundary. Yang Yan’s whereabouts should not be unknown since she should also be one of the strongest Masters in this world.

Zhang Ruo Xi blushed deeply, a distinctive brilliance flashing across her shy eyes.

Mo Xiao Qi joined in excitedly, “What about me? I’m not a little girl anymore either.”

“En, en,” Yang Kai nodded quickly, withdrawing himself from his memories.

“Big Brother Yang, where are you going next? Can you take me with you?” Mo Xiao Qi beamed at Yang Kai, looking extremely eager.

Yang Kai chuckled lightly, “It’s okay for me to bring you along, but… Aren’t you worried that your Aunty Feng might come for you? Aunty Feng doesn’t seem to like you running around.”

Mo Xiao Qi wrinkled her nose and snorted, “I was confined to the island to cultivate when she took me back the last time. It was so boring. Now that I’m finally out again, I won’t go back so easily! Besides, we just came out of Shattered Star Sea, Aunty Feng definitely can’t find me here. I will go back when I have enough fun.”

“Does Sir Martial Beast know how wilful you are?” Yang Kai smiled at her.

Mo Xiao Qi stuck out her tongue mischievously, “Big Brother Yang, you found out?”

Yang Kai snickered, “You must have had a good background to have such strong cultivation at a young age. You are proficient in taming Monster Beasts, you claim to be born in the Eastern Territory, and you also mention the word ‘island’ from time to time. I would be a fool if I still didn’t figure it out.”
