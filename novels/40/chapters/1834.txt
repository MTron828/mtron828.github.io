Yang Yan’s sorrowful expression was definitely not fake and even the fluctuations emanating from her Soul Avatar were extremely unstable, showing her mood was quite unsettled.

Yang Kai suddenly became a little curious, wondering what the relationship between her and the owner of the Sealed World Bead was.

“Enough, let us not mention him anymore. In any case, he has been missing for so long I already figured he had died. I’ll deal with what that person left in your Knowledge Sea first,” Yang Yan said after a while before sitting down cross-legged with a solemn expression, forming a series of seals with her hands as she swept her beautiful eyes across the sea down below.

A thread of Divine Sense that was visible to the naked eye rushed out from her fingertips, transformed into a snake-like appearance, and dove into the sea.

Yang Kai stood by and watched silently.

His Knowledge Sea was calm at first, but soon, the sea of flames began to become restless and at a certain location, large bubbles appeared.

Yang Kai turned his attention to that side and suddenly found that there was a triangle mark he had never seen before there, one which was vague and misty, nearly making it invisible.

The snake-like thread of Yang Yan’s Divine Sense was swimming around this mark and as it moved, the mark became clearer and clearer.

After the mark was completely revealed, Yang Yan took back the spirit snake.

Relaxing, Yang Yan explained, “It’s the simplest form of Soul Tracing Mark, but even so, you can’t get rid of it nor would you have been able to find it.”

“You can’t get rid of it?” Yang Kai was astonished.

“I can, I just chose not to,” Yang Yan slowly got up and spoke.

Yang Kai looked at her thoughtfully, “Casting a long line to catch a big fish?”

“Exactly,” Yang Yan smiled coldly, “After ten thousand years of silence, it seems like some from the Star Boundary are becoming restless again. This is a good opportunity to teach them a lesson they won’t soon forget. After this Queen returns to the Star Boundary, she’ll hang the head of whoever dared to come here above the Star Gate and see who else dares to come down and covet the Star Field’s Principles again.”

Yang Kai quietly wiped the non-existent cold sweat from his forehead, almost feeling sad for this pitiful fellow, but he quickly said, “Whatever you need, I’ll cooperate with you.”

“You don’t need to do anything in particular, he’ll come to you. Just go about your life, I will monitor you secretly,” Yang Yan said before suddenly stretching out her finger and condense a ball of light at its tip before sending it to Yang Kai’s Soul Avatar, “This is the Secret Technique to block off your Knowledge Sea, take some time to cultivate it.”

Yang Kai nodded seriously before closing his eyes to comprehend this new Secret Technique.

His Knowledge Sea had supreme treasures like the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus and the Star Field Star Chart. If he went to the Star Boundary in the future, it was inevitable that these things would be discovered by some master if he took no precautions, so Yang Kai diligently cultivated this Secret Technique to seal off his Knowledge Sea.

Seeing him like this, Yang Yan did not say any more, simply leaving him to his studies while she erected a number of powerful barriers around his Knowledge Sea before taking her leave.

One day later, Yang Kai opened his eyes as a faint trace of exhaustion filled his face.

The Secret Technique that Yang Yan handed to him to seal his Knowledge Sea was extremely profound, and he had consumed a great deal of his Spiritual Energy to comprehend it; however, although he was quite tired, his harvest had been rich, so he felt full of energy.

Yang Yan and Lin Yun’er had disappeared from the Hundred Flowers Pavilion, and when Yang Kai released his Divine Sense, he was unable to perceive their existence, having no clue where they had gone.

Only Gui Zu was now sitting directly opposite Yang Kai, wearing a solemn expression on his face, seemingly pondering something.

“Elder!” Yang Kai greeted him.

Gui Zu came out of his reverie and looked over towards Yang Kai to ask, “Sect Master, that Senior... who was she? Why does this old master feel as weak and vulnerable as a three-year-old child in front of her?”

Gui Zu was truly shocked.

After reaching the Second-Order Origin King Realm, he had thought that despite the world being vast, there was not anyone left who he needed to truly fear, but soon after arriving at High Heaven Sect, he had met Yang Yan and been tossed about by her ruthlessly, making him lose a great deal of confidence.

Although he had gained some benefits from the experience, Gui Zu really couldn’t accept this profound feeling of weakness.

“If I told you she is the Starry Sky Great Emperor, would you believe me?” Yang Kai smiled back at Gui Zu.

Gui Zu’s jaw dropped so far a melon could be stuffed into it as he stared at Yang Kai in shock, his eyes trembling violently.

“Hahaha... didn’t Supreme Elder want to refine some Origin King Grade Spirit Pills? You can go to Pill Treasure Peak to find my Little Senior Sister, she will refine whatever you want,” Yang Kai laughed before getting up and leaving leisurely.

Gui Zu sat alone for quite some time, unable to recover.

Only after a long silence did he pound the table with his fist and curse, “Damn brat, daring to play tricks on this old master! The Great Emperor is just a legend, how could she really appear here all of a sudden? What’s more, as a woman... This old master is not a naïve character, how could he have been fooled so easily? Never mind, those pills are more important now!”

Regardless of the true origins of that woman named Yang Yan, Gui Zu knew that she was definitely not someone he could provoke, and after having suffered two complete losses at her hand, Gui Zu no longer dared act self-righteous.

The Martial Dao was endless, and one needed to always strive to improve themself...

Inside First Heavenly Palace, Yang Kai sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes tightly.

Calming himself, Yang Kai spread out his Divine Sense and integrated it into Shadowed Star’s aura. As long as he wanted to, he could even feel the wind or grass anywhere on Shadowed Star now.

It was as if he and the Cultivation Star had merged into one, the two indistinguishable from one another.

The World Principles which had felt vague before had now become clearer, and his grasp of Shadowed Star’s power was much stronger than before.

“Is it because I broke through to the Origin King Realm?” Yang Kai muttered thoughtfully, “It should be, the Origin King Realm and Origin Returning Realm are two completely different Great Realms, after all. As my strength improves, there are bound to be some changes... oh? The World Principles seem to have changed a little...”

Yang Kai suddenly noticed something unusual and began to investigate. After a long time, he was slightly surprised, “The World Principles here are no longer disordered and have become flawless? ​​Is this also a result of my breakthrough? It being impossible to reach the Origin King Realm on Shadowed Star was a direct result of the imperfect World Principles disrupted by the battle between Yang Yan and the Insect Emperor. My breakthrough seems to have altered this situation though... If the flaws in the World Principles have been repaired now, does that mean Shadowed Star will no longer reject Origin Kings? Right, I have not noticed Shadowed Star rejecting me at all since I returned, but I’m also its Star Master, so I can’t use myself as proof. En, I can use Supreme Elder to give it a try.”

Thinking this way, he quickly found where Gui Zu was.

Currently, there were only two Origin Kings on Shadowed Star: him and Gui Zu. Yang Kai was Shadowed Star’s Star Master and would not be rejected by the star, so he could only experiment on Gui Zu.

At this moment, inside a grand palace on Pill Treasure Peak, a strong pill fragrance filled the air.

Gui Zu sat cross-legged on the ground while carefully explaining his own experiences and comprehensions on the Martial Dao and Heavenly Way.

Su Yan sat opposite Gui Zu, in front of the Ten Thousand Year Ice Jade Pedestal, her whole body exuding a deep chill and her hands resting on her knees lightly, listening attentively.

Next to her, Little Senior Sister was also listening very seriously, but her hands never stopped moving, continuously taking out Origin King Grade herbs and extracting medicinal liquid from them.

With her Sacred Spirit Medicine Body, Alchemy was like eating or drinking to Little Senior Sister, an all but instinctive behaviour, so while she listened to Gui Zu’s cultivation experiences, she was not distracted when performing Alchemy.

From time to time, a Spirit Pill would be completed and placed into a pre-prepared jade bottle by Xia Ning Chang.

Gui Zu was delighted and motivated every time he saw this happen.

Suddenly, Gui Zu frowned and turned his head to look around, his expression suspicious.

At that moment, he felt someone spying on him.

Shocked, he immediately and mistakenly thought that Yang Yan was observing him; after all, the only one who should be able to spy on him without revealing their location was Yang Yan.

Not daring to be negligent, Gui Zu became more focused on explaining the many difficulties and intricacies of cultivation, a faint trace of sweat leaking from his forehead as he did.

Fortunately, this feeling disappeared after a while, allowing Gui Zu to breathe a sigh of relief.

“There really is no sense of rejection,” Inside First Heavenly Palace, Yang Kai smiled happily. He had just tried to mobilize the World Principles to apply some pressure to Gui Zu, but found that they didn’t reject his presence.

The perfection of its World Principles was a massive breakthrough for Shadowed Star.

This meant that the World Principles on Shadowed Star would no longer suppress cultivators and restrict them from breaking through to the Origin King Realm. At the same time, they would not repel Origin Kings anymore, like when Qian Tong had been struck by lightning or burned by Earth Fire.

In the future, Shadowed Star would now just allow Origin Kings to rise, it also would not force these masters to leave.

In this way, it would save all the Origin Returning Realm masters of Shadowed Star from having to travel to other Cultivation Stars to make breakthroughs.

It seemed he would need to send word to Azure Tree Star and let Ye Xi Yun, Qian Tong, and all the others know about the good news.

Shadowed Star’s Principles had been repaired thanks to his breakthrough, but the World Principles of the Sealed World Bead were still incomplete, a fact that made Yang Kai feel quite helpless. These incomplete World Principles meant that breakthroughs could not be made inside.

However, this was an artifact left behind by the previous Star Field Guardian, so Yang Kai certainly had not uncovered all of its secrets yet.

For the next six months, Yang Kai remained on Shadowed Star.

He had just broken through to the Origin King Realm not long ago, and although thanks to his Embodiment inadvertently refining the entire floating continent, allowing his realm to rise to the peak of the First-Order, Yang Kai had yet to carefully consolidate his cultivation.

Over the past six months, besides consolidating his realm, Yang Kai also cultivated the Secret Technique to seal off his Knowledge Sea.

After half a year, he had reached the minor accomplishment stage and his entire Knowledge Sea was now shrouded by the invisible layer that seemed to blend and cooperate with the barriers left behind by Yang Yan. With his current cultivation, it was likely there was no one in the entire Star Field now who could invade his Knowledge Sea.

This way, the secrets in his Knowledge Sea were safe.

Today, Yang Kai was enjoying some family time and completing his filial duties by accompanying his parents on the mountain where they lived.

Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang were also present. Some time ago, the two women had been in retreat and had some gains, their auras now fluctuating somewhat, as if they were on the verge of a breakthrough.

As such, Yang Kai pulled them out to relax for a while, since breakthroughs were not something to be anxiously pursued.

Their son was a dragon among men and their two daughters-in-law were great beauties, making Yang Ying Feng and Dong Su Zhu feel as if their lives had been worth living. Dong Su Zhu also kept urging Yang Kai to hold a proper wedding ceremony soon, causing his two Senior Sisters to become both excited and shy.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s brows furrowed, and he quickly released his Divine Sense, the next moment his expression becoming solemn as he said, “Mother, Father, wait here a while. I’ll be right back.”

Saying so, he gave a wink to Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang, to which both of them nodded in understanding.

Yang Kai’s figure then flickered and disappeared.
