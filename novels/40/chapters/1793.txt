“En, this is indeed the Immortal Tree, and that drop of Immortal Source Liquid on that leaf belongs to this old master. It was an agreement between Ni Guang and Zi Long just now. They each took a drop. Yang Kai, this old master has no way to get that Immortal Source Liquid from the Seven Coloured Radiant Light. Do you have a solution?” Gui Zu turned to Yang Kai and asked.

Although Yang Kai was only a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, Gui Zu always felt astonished by his myriad of abilities, so at this critical time, he could only ask Yang Kai.

After all, what if this boy had a way?

Yang Kai really did have a way. He had already experimented with this method when collecting the Heavenly Infant Grass before, discovering that the Stone Puppet could move about inside the Seven Coloured Radiant Light. Although it was also affected to a certain extent, the impact was not too great.

So, when Gui Zu asked, Yang Kai couldn’t help grinning, “Of course I have one!”

“Quickly, stop him! We absolutely cannot let him act!” Zi Long’s face changed drastically as he pointed in the direction of Yang Kai and shouted. Since Yang Kai appeared, Zi Long’s expression had turned extremely ugly, and now seeing him stand and communicate with Gui Zu, he immediately realized that the situation was not good.

The puppets brought by him and Ni Guang had already been damaged and could not be used again, so while they had no way to penetrate the Seven Coloured Radiant Light, the stone man Yang Kai previously showed him had become the key existence that could determine ownership of the Immortal Tree.

So, when Zi Long saw that Yang Kai intended to act, he couldn’t hold his silence anymore and called out to Ni Guang, “Brother Ni, we need to set aside our grievances for the moment. We need to cooperate to stop this brat; he has a rare treasure in his hand that can withstand the Seven Coloured Radiant Light.”

“What?” Ni Guang was taken aback and turned to look at Yang Kai.

Although he was not very familiar with Yang Kai, he had at least travelled with him for several days, but during that time, he hadn’t noticed anything particularly special about Yang Kai. Now that Zi Long was calling out so anxiously though, Ni Guang could not help feeling surprised, wondering just what kind of rare treasure Yang Kai possessed that could withstand the Seven Coloured Radiant Light.

After all, he and Zi Long had brought puppets which were especially refined for this task, and whether it was Purple Star or Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, they only managed to create one such puppet.

However, even those two puppets could not remain inside the Seven Coloured Radiant Light for too long, and although some of the damage they suffered was due to mutual attacks, the biggest reason was the Radiant Light’s suppression.

The Seven Coloured Radiant Light’s pressure was simply too terrifying.

Could this rare treasure in Yang Kai’s hand be stronger than their two puppets?

“Brother Ni, do you want to watch this treasure fall into the hands of another? Why don’t you and I join forces and seize that treasure from him first? Then, we can use it to obtain the Immortal Tree. After we obtain it, we can share it equally!” Zi Long spoke out loud and extremely quickly, showing no scruples about Yang Kai hearing him.

Ni Guang frowned and glanced towards Xue Yue.

He needed to ask Xue Yue for her opinion.

Xue Yue slowly shook her head with a serious expression on her face.

Ni Guang understood and said lightly, “Brother Zi, your proposal is somewhat inappropriate, so forgive this Ni for not being able to agree.”

“Fool!” Zi Long was incensed. In this situation, he wanted to obtain the Immortal Tree and could only rely on the stone man in Yang Kai’s possession, but it was obvious at a glance that Yang Kai and Gui Zu were working together. Gui Zu was a master on Zi Long’s level, so his only option was to draw Ni Guang into the fight, but Ni Guang had refused!

Didn’t Ni Guang realize that if the situation continued like this, he would lose all hope of obtaining the Immortal Tree?

The Divine Bird leaving its nest was a rare opportunity, and if this chance was missed, the Immortal Tree would surely slip through his fingers, and he would never be able to obtain an immortal and indestructible body.

Zi Long quickly became as anxious as an ant on a hot wok...

“Jie Jie...” Gui Zu cackled wickedly as the black Qi outside his body churned, showcasing his displeasure, “You’re the Sect Master of Purple Star? One truly cannot know a person until they meet them personally. Your performance here really disappoints this old master. Hmph, if you wish to deal with my Sect’s Sect Master, you’ll have to pass this old master first!”

Saying so, a wailing howl rang out from Gui Zu’s figure, causing everyone nearby to shudder. With a wave of his hand, Gui Zu summoned his Ten Thousand Soul Banner and transformed it into a giant ghastly face that seemed able to swallow the world itself and floated it above his head.

The ghost head exuded a strong, cold aura, and its giant mouth opened and closed menacingly, occasionally revealing a terrifying darkness inside of it, like a bottomless abyss.

Zi Long’s expression could not help darkening.

“Uncle Ni, we should support Yang Kai as well,” Xue Yue said softly.

Ni Guang was taken aback but soon nodded, wrapping his Saint Qi around Xue Yue and flying over towards Yang Kai and Gui Zu’s side.

When he first entered the Severed World, Ni Guang had a bad impression of Gui Zu, feeling that the latter was a vicious and troublesome individual who cultivated some kind of evil Secret Art. But just now, when Xu Wei was attacking Xue Yue, Gui Zu had intervened to help her, a fact Ni Guang had not missed.

As such, Ni Guang felt incredibly grateful to Gui Zu. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

So, he did not reject Xue Yue’s proposal. He did not know what the relationship between Xue Yue and Yang Kai was, but since Xue Yue had spoken, it was obvious she wanted to support him in this matter.

After landing, Ni Guang nodded lightly to Gui Zu, the latter simply responding with a chuckle.

The two Second-Order Origin Kings had instantly formed a kind of alliance.

Zi Long’s face turned even uglier.

Standing there, he stared coldly at Gui Zu and Ni Guang, his heart unsettled.

Zi Long knew that this Immortal Tree would slip through his grasp if nothing changed. With two Second-Order Origin Kings, the other party had absolute superiority.

But even so... he could not make it that easy for them!

Zi Long quickly composed himself and sent a Divine Sense Message to Xu Wei. After Xu Wei heard it, he quickly raised his head and beckoned to Kong Fa who was standing not far away, “Brother Kong, come here!”

Kong Fa’s eyes narrowed as he glanced over at Zi Long with a worried look.

Xu Wei chuckled, “Brother Kong, this Xu wouldn’t harm you, you can rest assured and come over.”

Kong Fa pondered for a moment before nodding and quickly walking over.

Xu Wei turned his attention to Meng Tong next.

But before he could speak, Meng Tong grinned meaningfully, “This Meng will take his leave first. May we meet again if there is a chance!”

Saying so, he turned around and left at an extremely fast speed.

He obviously did not want to get drawn into this muddy water; after all, the situation was quite tense right now, with the top masters opposing one another and two factions clearly forming. Meng Tong had managed to reach the Origin King Realm without any help from a powerful great force and had entered the Severed World simply to search for some opportunities. Getting caught up in this precarious fight was clearly not something he was interested in.

So, he made a decisive decision and immediately left.

He was the first to come and was the first to leave. It could be seen that Meng Tong was an extremely cautious individual and it was not just luck that he managed to reach the Origin King Realm.

“Coward!” Zi Long coldly snorted, rather scornful of Meng Tong’s timidity.

With Meng Tong gone, Zi Long only had two First-Order Origin Kings, Xu Wei and Kong Fa, on his side, while the other side had two Second-Order Origin Kings. Although there was technically one more Origin King on his side, Zi Long did not think he had the advantage.

The key to everything was Yang Kai!

As long as he could capture Yang Kai and snatch his rare treasure, victory would be his!

“Interesting.” Seeing Zi Long’s movements, Gui Zu gave a gloomy smile, “Yang Kai, act freely. With this old master here, no one can touch a hair on your head!”

“Yang Kai, don’t worry, Uncle Ni will also support you,” Xue Yue said as she stood next to him.

Ni Guang heard this and nodded without hesitation, “En.”

Since Xue Yue had already declared so, how could he refuse? While verbally agreeing, he muttered secretly in his heart that the relationship between Xue Yue and Yang Kai was much closer than he first imagined.

If that weren’t the case, Xue Yue wouldn’t have offered his support.

“Then, I’ll have to trouble you two!” Yang Kai laughed loudly then without any delay summoned his Embodiment.

As soon as the golden stone puppet Embodiment appeared, it attracted everyone’s attention.

Zi Long, Xu Wei, and Zi Dong had already seen Yang Kai’s Embodiment before, so they knew that Yang Kai would definitely use this rare treasure to try to obtain the Immortal Tree, but it was the first time that Gui Zu, Ni Guang, and the others saw it.

Everyone seemed a little surprised.

None of them knew what the Stone Puppet was.

Yang Kai sat down cross-legged and sent his Soul Clone into the Embodiment before controlling it to walk towards the Immortal Tree.

“In your dreams!” Zi Long could not contain his anxiety and shouted as he stepped forward, releasing the terrifying coercion of an Origin Kings towards Yang Kai.

“Hahaha, Brother Zi, this Ni would like to exchange pointers with you!” Ni Guang laughed and took a step forward to meet the pressure with own.

*Hong...*

The ground cracked as the invisible pressure from two Second-Order Origin Kings collided, causing the surrounding space to tremble for a moment.

The two snorted at the same time and their bodies shook slightly.

In this confrontation, they came out evenly matched.

Ni Guang’s eyes brightened as a burning fighting intent flashed across them. On the other side, Zi Long ground his teeth and shouted, “Ni Guang, are you willing to see the Immortal Tree taken away by an outsider? It’s not too late to collaborate with me to obtain it!”

Ni Guang curled his lips into a grin, “Join hands with you? Stop sleep talking. Even if I cannot get the Immortal Tree for the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, your Purple Star shouldn’t even dream of obtaining it.”

“Fine! You’ve forced my hand,” Zi Long was angry and his entire body burst with dazzling purple light. This purple light was so dense that it almost seemed tangible. At the same time, a crashing sound rang out from Zi Long’s figure, like a raging ocean.

“Purple Qi Eternal River Secret Art!” Ni Guang’s face sank as he realized that Zi Long had really become impatient and was planning on seriously fighting him. As such, Ni Guang did not dare hold back and also pushed his Secret Art to the limit. A golden aura burst from his body, one that was both majestic and imposing.

The surrounding aura became turbulent as the Domains of two Origin Kings crashed against one another...

With a loud roar, Zi Long transformed into a streak of purple light and rushed straight towards Ni Guang.

Ni Guang released a similar growl as his figure flickered and shot out like a blast of golden lightning to meet the enemy.

The world shook as the purple and golden lights collided mid-air and powerful Saint Qi explosions filled the sky.
