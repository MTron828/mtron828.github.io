“Just you wait. One day, I’m going to make you pay for this!”

Yang Kai’s expression was gloomy as he muttered seemingly to himself. Meanwhile, Li Jiao silently hid in a corner like a cicada in winter. For some reason, Yang Kai’s temper suddenly became extremely bad one month after they set off from the Northern Territory. His expression was so cold and dark that it felt like his face was covered in a layer of frost. Moreover, he constantly cursed at somebody under his breath.

Yang Kai’s behaviour caused Li Jiao to be on edge all the time. [I didn’t do anything to upset him recently, so why is he acting like this all of a sudden?]

Fortunately, Yang Kai did not lash out at Li Jiao even though he was in a bad mood. Nevertheless, Li Jiao behaved very carefully around Yang Kai, lest he caused the building resentment in the other to suddenly erupt.

There was no doubt that Yang Kai was in a bad mood; however, it wasn’t because of Li Jiao but Luan Feng! [It’s all because that damn woman destroyed the Space Array I previously arranged in the Ancient Wild Lands. Otherwise, I could have gone directly from High Heaven Palace to the Ancient Wild Lands, then headed towards the East Sea!]

Although the distance between these two locations was not small, it was still infinitely better than the distance between the Northern and Eastern Territories. It was because Luan Feng destroyed his Space Array that he now had to fly all the way to the Eastern Territory. Even if the journey went smoothly, it still took a great deal of time!

For that reason, Yang Kai felt extremely upset and annoyed and vowed to himself that he was going to make Luan Feng pay for this. It was simply too frustrating otherwise!

The Flowing Clouds Shuttle travelled very quickly with Yang Kai and Li Jiao taking turns steering.

Whenever Yang Kai was free, he would sit down cross-legged to cultivate. His cultivation might have hit a bottleneck, but it didn’t prevent him from cultivating the Dragon Transformation Secret Art. At present, he became forty-five metres tall after his Dragon Transformation. Besides, cultivating the Dragon Transformation Secret Art could greatly help the Golden Divine Dragon’s Source integrate with his body and increase the power of his Dragon Transformation.

Once in a while, he also contemplated the Dao of Space. The Space Divine Abilities he currently wielded were essentially the fruits of his comprehension of the Dao of Space, each of them strong in their own way. Thus, it would be of great help to him if he could gain more insight into the Dao of Space.

This trip to Dragon Island was rather impulsive, but it was also the result of careful consideration. Yang Kai knew that he still had a long way to go in his cultivation, and if things went sour, they might get dragged into a conflict on Dragon Island. [Entering Dragon Island with my current strength spells certain death. Still, Zhu Qing is on that island. I can’t just sit around and do nothing.]

What Zhu Lie mentioned to him in the Revolving World echoed in his ears. He did not know what Zhu Qing might have encountered after she returned to Dragon Island, but it was obvious that the outcome would not be good.

A True Dragon was involved in an intimate relationship with a Human. Yang Kai didn’t even need to think to know that Dragon Island would never allow for something like that. If Zhu Qing gave in and decided to end their relationship because she failed to stand up against the pressure, he would have to reluctantly accept; however, if she refused to give in to the pressure, she would surely have to suffer.

[Will Zhu Qing be willing to sever our relationship?] Yang Kai never even bothered to consider this question because he knew what she would choose without even needing to think about it.

Time passed, and the days went by peacefully. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Yang Kai had not made much progress in the Dragon Transformation Secret Art. He had not been cultivating that Secret Art for long after all. It was all thanks to the Dragon Blood Pill and Zhu Qing’s pure Primordial Yin that he could achieve a height of forty-five metres. If he wanted to improve that Secret Art even further, then he would need time, a lot of it actually.

Finally, the duo arrived at the East Sea. Standing above the vast and boundless waters, it seemed like the blue sky was cloudless for tens of thousands of kilometres.

Even with the assistance of the Flowing Clouds Shuttle, it took Yang Kai and Li Jiao two months to arrive from the Northern Territory. That went to show just how far apart the major territories in Star Boundary were.

Upon arriving at the East Sea, Li Jiao took over control of the Flowing Clouds Shuttle. Yang Kai had no idea where Dragon Island was, whereas Li Jiao was the one who knew the approximate location.

It was understandable. Just as Yang Kai had guessed, Li Jiao was a Dragonborn with the blood of the Dragon Clan in him; therefore, he had a special attachment towards Dragon Island. Even the fact that he had never been to Dragon Island before did not hinder these feelings from growing in him. Li Jiao desperately wanted to visit Dragon Island; however, he was aware that his meagre bloodline did not qualify him to enter.

Still, five hundred years ago, Li Jiao had searched the East Sea for a very long time to find Dragon Island. He spent a full three years looking for clues, but was only able to gain a general idea of its location.

According to Li Jiao, back then, he inadvertently followed somebody into a coastal region, but unfortunately, the person he had been following, who seemed to be part of the Dragon Clan, mysteriously disappeared after entering that place.

This discovery made him very excited and he later searched the area for a long time only to fail to obtain any other clues. Thus, he could only give up on his endeavour. It wasn’t until Yang Kai came looking for him that the suppressed desire in his heart burst out again. For that reason, he had chased after Yang Kai so boldly.

“Back then, I lost sight of that guy in this region.” The Flowing Clouds Shuttle had been put away and above the vast and borderless sea, Li Jiao stretched out his hand and drew a circle in front of him as he explained to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai glanced left and right. Frowning, he asked. “Are you sure this is the place? There’s nothing here that you can use as reference.”

Li Jiao said. “Although there is nothing here to use as reference, I will never forget this place. I have always kept the image of this place in my heart.”

Yang Kai nodded. [If he is that confident, then it’s probably the right place.] “This area is vast, at least tens of thousands of kilometres across. Moreover, we have no clues whatsoever.”

“Should we just forget about it then?” Li Jiao looked at Yang Kai timidly. Throughout the entire journey, he had been extremely excited; he wanted to enter Dragon Island and explore that place; however, now that he had arrived at this place again, he was getting cold feet. He was scared, but he wasn’t scared of dying. He was afraid as to whether he had the courage to enter Dragon Island if they actually managed to find it. It was a question he asked himself constantly but could not answer.

“Brother Li, you can go back if you want to, but I’m going to continue searching.” Saying so, Yang Kai flew off.

Li Jiao stood there and hesitated for a moment before shouting, “Let’s search separately!” After saying that, he began flying in the opposite direction.

Yang Kai spread his Divine Sense around like a tide in the sea, carefully exploring every inch of this place. He even flew slowly, lest he missed anything.

Dragon Island’s location was so mysterious that no one knew where it was. In his opinion, that must be the work of an impressive Spirit Array which completely concealed all the traces of Dragon Island from the world.

[If Dragon Island is being concealed by a Spirit Array, then there will surely be traces of its existence.] As long as he could locate that Spirit Array, the location of Dragon Island would be revealed too. Yang Kai might not know much about Spirit Arrays, but he did know that all of them gave off fluctuations. Everything would fall into place once he detected the fluctuating energy of a Spirit Array.

One day, two days, three days…

Yang Kai expanded the search scope little by little but found nothing despite turning the coastal area spanning tens of thousands of kilometres upside down. During this period, he met up with Li Jiao several times. Unfortunately, Li Jiao had no results to show either.

Ten days later, they had doubled the scope of the search. One month later, the search scope doubled again.

Yang Kai’s expression gradually became extremely ugly. [Don’t tell me I’ll have to return home empty-handed without even locating Dragon Island? That would be the world’s biggest joke.]

When he met with Li Jiao again, he frowned and asked, “Are you sure Dragon Island is in this coastal area?”

“Of course, I’m certain,” Li Jiao nodded repeatedly. A long while later, he suddenly seemed to realize something. “Palace Master Yang, are you doubting me? You can’t wrong me like this; I’m innocent! Besides, what good will it do me to lie to you?”

“I’m not doubting you. It’s just that so many years have passed and the surrounding scenery in this vast sea is homogenous. It’s inevitable if you recall the place wrongly.”

“Impossible!” Li Jiao denied vehemently, “It’s impossible for me to get it wrong! It’s definitely this place! There’s no doubt about it!”

Yang Kai couldn’t say anything anymore after seeing Li Jiao’s reaction. He nodded slightly and looked out into the distance. [Should I go to Spirit Beast Island? Although Martial Beast Great Emperor and Dragon Island are on bad terms with each other, it shouldn’t be a problem for Martial Beast Great Emperor to provide some directions, right?]

“Haa… Dragon Island is so mysterious and hard to locate… If only we had a Dragon Island Token…” Li Jiao sighed.

Yang Kai abruptly turned his head to look at Li Jiao.

“What is it?” Li Jiao exclaimed in surprise.

Yang Kai said, “Can the Dragon Island Token locate Dragon Island?”

Li Jiao replied, “I think so. The Dragon Island Token is something the Dragon Island issued to others after all. Those who hold one of the Dragon Island Tokens can ask Dragon Island to fulfil one of their wishes as long as it is within the Dragon Clan’s abilities. However, the Dragon Clan rarely appears in public. If somebody obtained the Dragon Island Token, they would have to come to Dragon Island to make their wish, right? But, how do they get into Dragon Island? Naturally, they can only rely on the Dragon Island Token to do so.” Then, Li Jiao sighed, “Unfortunately, only a few Dragon Island Tokens exist. Besides, I heard Dragon Island took most of them back, so finding a Dragon Island Token now is more difficult than ascending to the Heavens.”

Yang Kai let out a long sigh. He raised his head and patted Li Jiao on the shoulder with a sorrowful expression.

Li Jiao was shocked. “What’s wrong, Palace Master?!”

Yang Kai lifted his head and forced out a smile that looked even worse than if he had cried. Gritting his teeth, he growled. “Why didn’t you mention something so important sooner!?”

Li Jiao felt a sharp pain in his shoulder, as if his arm was about to be crushed. [Why is Yang Kai going crazy all of a sudden!?]

“You didn’t ask.”

He had only mentioned it off-handedly; he did not expect Yang Kai to react so strongly to his words.

“A Dragon Island Token, right?” Yang Kai released his grip and took something out, “I have one right here!”

“Huh?” Li Jiao was dumbfounded; he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he shouted, “Why didn’t you take that out earlier?!”

“How was I supposed to know it would be of use here?!”

The two of them looked at each other, both feeling a little speechless and close to tears. They had worked so hard trying to locate Dragon Island for the past month with no results to show for it, only to learn that the key to solving the puzzle had been in their hands all along.

“Is this really a Dragon Island Token?” Li Jiao asked in disbelief. He had just mentioned how rare Dragon Island Tokens were. As far as he knew, only a handful of them even existed. Moreover, most of them had been retrieved by the Dragon Clan. Thus, he could not believe that Yang Kai could pull one out of his pockets.

Upon a closer look, the Dragon Island Token was simple and unpretentious. It was made out of unknown materials that were neither metal nor wood. On one side, a life-like Great Dragon had been carved into it while the character ‘Dragon’ had been engraved on the other side.

Li Jiao felt a little out of sorts. [This… Really seems to be a genuine Dragon Island Token! It’s not much different from the records I have seen in ancient books!]

“Are you sure this is useful?” Yang Kai asked, looking at Li Jiao.

Li Jiao was uncertain, “Probably?”

He had no way to be sure; after all, he had never used this before. Still, it was just as he had said. The location of Dragon Island was hidden and the Dragon Clan had not shown themselves for a long time now. If anybody obtained a Dragon Island Token and wanted to get to Dragon Island, they would most likely need to use the Dragon Island Token to find the location of Dragon Island. After all, it’s not as if the Dragon Clan was going to guide them there.
