The sight of four Emperor Realm Masters flying at them all at once was quite terrifying.

Shi Tian He, who had been fixed in place by Yang Kai, had a sudden feeling of heaviness come over her body, as though several mountains were suddenly pressing down at the centre of her chest, making it impossible for her to breathe.

In the next instant, the four men’s attacks were upon them.

*Hong hong hong…*

Shi Tian He’s heart almost leapt out of her chest from the sound, and she thought her death was certain, but when she looked again, she found that she had somehow mysteriously appeared at a different location, and those four people’s attacks had not hurt her!

Yang Kai was still in front of her, waving his hands casually.

A gigantic, pitch-black Moon Blade formed, pulsating with terrifying waves of power. It was like the scythe of the reaper, biding its time until it could harvest the lives of all in existence.

With a slicing sound, the Moon Blade flew outwards, straight at the four Emperor Realm Masters.

“This is bad!” Yan Dong shouted, his face turning pale.

After the failure of the last attack, he had realised that he and his companions had greatly underestimated Yang Kai’s strength. Although this youth was also a First-Order Emperor like them, he was shockingly fast. Such incredible speed was enough to make him almost impossible to defeat in battle.

Just as Yang Dong looked up, he saw the gigantic Moon Blade flying towards them, and was so terrified he immediately retreated backwards.

“Quick, dodge!” He yelled to the others.

He was quick to notice and swift to dodge, but the three Profound Thunder Pavilion Elders were not as agile. They were still wondering what had just happened, as they had not seen Yang Kai make any movements, yet he had suddenly vanished.

By the time they heard Yan Dong warning, the Moon Blade was already upon them.

The three Elders all cried out as they pushed their Emperor Qi and Principle Strengths to defend themselves.

*Chi chi chi chi…*

Despite their efforts though, all they met was a sight that filled them with despair.

Everywhere the Moon Blade passed over, it left desolation in its wake, tearing apart their Emperor Qi and Principles like they were paper as it cut towards them.

*Pu…*

With only a soft sound, the pitch-black Moon Blade sliced through the chest of the foremost Elder before it continued onwards to the second Elder without weakening in the slightest.

The second Elder did not survive either as he was swiftly bisected by the Moon Blade.

By now though, the last middle-aged Elder had managed to shift his posture just enough so that the Moon Blade only cut through his shoulder.

In that instant, Yan Dong’s eyes bulged as he stared in horror at the two Profound Thunder Pavilion Elders, who had been cut in half by the Moon Blade, not even daring to blink.

With a loud splatter, the two Elders’ bodies suddenly split in two, sending blood and guts scattering in the air. At the same time, a horrible scream was heard, startling Yan Dong who hurriedly turned to its source.

He saw that the third Elder’s arm had been severed at the shoulder, with blood spraying out like a fountain from the wound. From the open wound, he could vaguely see the Elder’s heart beating in his chest. It was a critical injury.

*Siii…*

Yan Dong drew in a breath of cold air, and his clothes were instantly soaked in sweat. Turning his head creakily, he stared at Yang Kai in terror and nervously asked, “Who… who are you!?”

With one move, only one move, this young man had instantly killed two First-Order Emperor Realm Elders of Profound Thunder Pavilion while heavily wounding another.

How was a First-Order Emperor capable of such a thing? Was he even Human?

Yan Dong was truly scared now. If it hadn’t been for Yang Kai voluntarily channelling his power and showing his First-Order Emperor Realm cultivation earlier, he would’ve thought that Yang Kai was a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master hiding his true strength.

Standing behind Yang Kai, Shi Tian He was also bewildered and couldn’t help gulping nervously.

At that moment, she suddenly noticed that the force that had been binding her had disappeared, and she had regained her freedom of movement.

Yang Kai smiled widely and said, “You don’t even know who I am, yet you come and seek trouble with me. It seems like City Lord Yan doesn’t know how to write the word ‘death’.”

“Death…” Yan Dong’s eyes narrowed as he cast a glance at the two deceased Elders of Profound Thunder Pavilion. Then, he looked at Bai Yu, who was barely able to defend himself and didn’t seem like he could hold on much longer. Realizing his situation, Yan Dong grit his teeth and whirled around, turning into a flash of light as he hurriedly fled. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He did not dare to stay any longer. His opponent was able to instantly kill two Emperor Realm Masters that had comparable strength to himself, so it would obviously be easy for Yang Kai to take his life as well. If Yang Dong stayed any longer, he was sure to die.

However, faced with his opponent’s frightening speed, Yan Dong did not have much confidence in his ability to escape.

Thus, even as he fled, he cast an anxious glance behind him, only to see that Yang Kai was still standing there, seemingly not intending to pursue him.

The speed of an Emperor Realm Master was great, so in the blink of an eye, Yan Dong had vanished out of sight.

Only then did he start panting heavily, his face full of terror from what had just happened while at the same time he felt relieved to have survived such an ordeal.

He didn’t know why Yang Kai did not pursue him, but since he was allowed to escape, he did not intend to waste this opportunity.

After flying forward for several dozen breaths more, Yan Dong finally regained some sense of security. Regardless of how fast that youth was, since he had shown no signs of pursuit even until now, it meant that Yan Dong was safe.

Before he could finish that thought though, Yan Dong’s steps faltered as he stared grimly at a spot not far ahead of him.

The space before him rippled, as though the air was the surface of a pond after a rock had been thrown into it. Immediately afterwards, waves of some strange energy emanated from the centre of those ripples.

His vision blurred for a moment, but soon, Yang Dong saw a figure appear before him like some terrifying apparition.

*Deng deng deng deng…*

Yan Dong backed away in terror, looking like he had just seen a ghost in broad daylight as he stared at Yang Kai, muttering incoherently, “Y-Y-You… H-H-How did you…”

As he fumbled his words, Yan Dong suddenly seemed to think of something and shouted grimly, “A Spatial Technique!”

He had heard in the past that cultivators who cultivated the Dao of Space and had profound understanding of Space Principles were able to do fantastical things like moving instantly across vast distances, but that had been merely hearsay to him while the Dao of Space was not something an ordinary genius could cultivate. After all, the Dao of Space was one of the most esoteric Daos of all, and people with no innate talent for it could not even begin to comprehend it even if they spent their entire lives trying.

In the entire Star Boundary, there was only one Master who had an extremely deep comprehension of the Dao of Space, and he was said to be the strongest Master below the Great Emperors.

That man was the famed Li Wu Yi of the Eastern Territory’s Spirit Beast Island.

Yan Dong could never have imagined that he would run into an opponent who was proficient in the Dao of Space, and with abilities quite comparable to those of Li Wu Yi.

Yang Kai had not allowed him to escape. Rather, he had confidence in being able to stop Yan Dong with his ability. No matter how Yan Dong tried to run, he could not escape from Yang Kai’s grasp.

“City Lord Yan is quite perceptive,” Yang Kai chuckled, a light grin plastered on his face.

Yan Dong’s face darkened, and he growled through gritted teeth, “I’ve not given up yet!”

He knew he could not escape, and seeing from how he had slaughtered the Profound Thunder Pavilion Elders earlier, Yang Kai was unlikely to let him go even if he begged for mercy. His only hope for survival was to go all out with Yang Kai and pray he could win.

Yan Dong was a decisive man, so at those words, he drew forth all his strength and summoned a sword into his hand. The gleam of the sword’s edge was dazzlingly bright. Man and blade moved as one, slashing towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, casually lifting his hand to deliver a palm strike.

As his Emperor Qi surged, the blade’s gleaming light was instantly extinguished, and the palm landed squarely upon Yan Dong’s chest.

*Pu…*

Blood sprayed from Yan Dong’s mouth as he flew backwards and fell onto the ground, smashing a deep pit where he landed.

Crawling out of the pit with much difficulty, Yan Dong looked at Yang Kai with a trembling gaze as the latter gradually descended from the sky, “Aren’t you only a First-Order Emperor?” Yang Dong screamed, “Just who are you?”

How could a First-Order Emperor Realm Master injure him so heavily with just a light palm? How could a First-Order Emperor Realm Master kill two Elders from Profound Thunder Pavilion and injure a third with one move?

Yan Dong was almost certain that Yang Kai had concealed his cultivation so he could toy with them.

It was laughable that they had all thought Ji Yao was the more powerful of the two, but ended up kicking an even thicker iron plate instead.

“Why don’t you guess?” Yang Kai blinked at him as another pitch-black Moon Blade appeared in his hand, though it was not as large as the previous one.

Sensing the waves of power hidden in that Moon Blade, Yan Dong’s face turned ashen. This blade was made of concentrated Space Principles, and he was powerless to defend himself against it.

“Wait…” Yan Dong hurriedly yelled. Since he could not defeat Yang Kai, the only option left was to beg for mercy.

Yang Kai had no intention of letting him speak, however, and with a flick of his wrist, the Moon Blade flew out.

With a soft sound, the Moon Blade cut through Yan Dong’s body. The City Lord’s eyes went wide as he fell to the ground, his body splitting in two as it collapsed.

Yang Kai waved his hand and took the Space Ring from Yan Dong, then turned and disappeared without a trace.

When he reappeared, he was once more standing beside Shi Tian He.

Hearing the sounds of battle still, Yang Kai looked over and saw that Ji Yao and Bai Yu were still locked in a life or death struggle. Bai Yu was in quite a bad state, his hair was dishevelled while his body was covered in bloody wounds. However, due to the effect of Ji Yao’s ice-cold domain, his blood froze the moment it spilled.

Bai Yu’s hair had also turned white with frost while his movements had become sluggish.

It was evident that his mastery of Principles was vastly inferior to Ji Yao’s, and it was only a matter of time before he was defeated and killed.

“Senior, these are the Space Rings of those three,” seeing Yang Kai return, Shi Tian He respectfully handed over the three Space Rings.

The heavily wounded Profound Thunder Pavilion Elder from earlier was already dead, as Yang Kai had quickly taken his life before pursuing Yan Dong to finish things off.

The pungent stench of blood permeated the area, and the ground was covered in a dark crimson.

“En,” Yang Kai nodded and accepted the three Space Rings, putting them with the one he had obtained from Yan Dong just now. He did a quick check and found that these fellows had been quite wealthy, especially Yan Dong, who had a sizable amount of Source Crystals in his Space Ring, as well as some precious treasures.

“Senior…” Shi Tian He called out anxiously. Ever since Yang Kai had demonstrated his terrifying power, she looked at him quite differently, with none of the ease from before but rather with respect and awe, “Just… Who are you?”

“Me? My name is Yang Kai,” he replied with a grin.
