Yang Kai had thought that his little provocation wouldn’t have much of an effect; after all, his strength had been exposed, so no matter how stupid the Black Ink Clan was, they wouldn’t fall for it again and again.

The Black Ink Clan might have even laid some kind of ambush here for him. Furthermore, the Territory Lords might also make a move.

But contrary to his expectation, his provocation actually succeeded this time as well! A few Feudal Lords rushed out from the universe fragment with their troops and chased after him.

Just like last time, when Yang Kai reached a suitable position, he turned around and began fighting with the 2,000 or so Black Ink Clansmen.

Nonetheless, he never lowered his guard. According to his estimate, a Territory Lord should be hiding nearby, waiting for an opportunity to deliver a fatal blow to him. So, he had to be on guard against possible sneak attacks from tricky directions.

Just as Yang Kai was luring Feudal Lords’ troops away, the 200,000-strong Black Ink Clan Army hiding in the Black Ink Clouds on the universe fragment split into three forces under various Territory Lords, rushing towards Dawning Light’s location from different directions. The Black Ink Clan was planning to launch a surprise attack on the enemy forces.

The Black Ink Clan had a total of four armies prepared to besiege Blue Sky Pass with nearly 1 million soldiers in total. This was just one of those four armies.

Although it was not yet time for them to act, the temptation of the Humans lying in ambush on the universe fragment was simply too great.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Not to mention anything else, that one person among the ambushers was sufficient for these Territory Lords to take some risks. Furthermore, after their recent discussion, they had come to the conclusion that there would not be that many Humans lying in ambush as this place was quite far from Blue Sky Pass. 200,000 Black Ink Clansmen and over a dozen Territory Lords would be more than enough to squash them. So, according to them, there wasn’t much risk involved.

They could still move together with the three other armies after eliminating these Humans.

“Wu Ying, are you sure Zhong Liang is also there?” Along the way, one of the Territory Lords asked.

The one called Wu Ying was the Territory Lord who had volunteered to investigate the Human Race’s ambush. Hearing this, he immediately gnashed his teeth as he rebuked, “How could I mistake Zhong Liang’s aura? That old dog severely wounded me back then. I almost lost my life. I would recognize him even if he is reduced to ashes!”

The Territory Lord, who had just asked the question, nodded and continued, “Good. In that case, we’ve caught a big fish this time. Zhong Liang is the Army Commander of the Western Army and holds a high position. If he dies, the morale of Blue Sky Pass will definitely plummet. Perhaps we can capture Blue Sky Pass this time.”

Wu Ying fiercely stated, “I want to kill him myself!”

“Don’t worry, you will get your chance!”

…

[Something’s wrong!]

Yang Kai keenly felt this during the battle. This was the third time he had lured the snakes out of their hole. The first time he had done so, he had managed to kill hundreds of Black Ink Clansmen. The Feudal Lord troops were simply unable to escape from him.

The second time, he was unable to kill all of them as there were just too many and he had no choice but to let a portion of them go.

The third time, he was able to lure the same number as he had lured the second time. At first, he had thought that a Territory Lord was hiding nearby, waiting for an opportunity to sneak attack him, but after killing so many Black Ink Clansmen and deliberately showing a few flaws, he still didn’t encounter any sneak attacks. He didn’t even notice the aura of any Territory Lords.

Was there no Territory Lord here from the start?

This wasn’t the most puzzling thing though. What made Yang Kai even more confused was that these Black Ink Clansmen were actually fighting him to the death!

This was very unusual. The Black Ink Clansmen here were clearly in a panic after witnessing their fellow comrades being mercilessly slaughtered and ordinarily, this would be the time for them to escape, but not a single one of them fled.

After some time, Yang Kai managed to kill nearly half of the 2,000 Black Ink Clansmen. If the remaining half didn’t flee, they would be wiped out sooner or later.

Yang Kai faintly felt that he had fallen into some kind of trap, but he could not worry about it at this point. Since there was no Territory Lord hiding nearby, he simply started a bloodbath!

After another hour or two, only 100 or so Black Ink Clan soldiers remained. These Black Ink Clan soldiers were extremely terrified and moved as far away from Yang Kai as possible whenever he approached. Nonetheless, none of them showed any intention of escaping.

Suddenly, a boiling Sword Intent appeared not far behind Yang Kai. The next moment, a sword cry reverberated through the void as a figure clad in sword aura came rushing in, shredding every Black Ink Clan soldier in its path into pieces.

The sword aura suddenly split into several directions before converging the next moment, killing or injuring most of the Black Ink Clansmen.

When the figure wrapped in sword aura rushed towards the last Feudal Lord, Yang Kai hurriedly shouted, “Keep him alive!”

Yang Kai had deliberately not killed this Feudal Lord, so how could he allow someone else to kill him?

Fortunately, Feng Ying’s reaction was extremely fast. She immediately changed directions and slaughtered the remaining small fries after Yang Kai’s shout. By the time she turned around, Yang Kai had already used Space Principles to imprison the wounded Feudal Lord.

“Why are you here?” Yang Kai turned to Feng Ying.

Feng Ying instead asked back, “Why can’t your Space Beacon transmit messages in reverse? Martial Uncle Zhong Liang asked me to ask you about the situation here, but since I couldn’t reach you, I had no choice but to come here personally.”

Yang Kai was stunned, “You sent me a message? I kept the Space Beacon in my Space Ring, so naturally you couldn’t reach me.”

After sending the last message, he had put away the Space Beacon because he was afraid that someone would send him a message, which would expose his whereabouts. He had never thought that Dawn Squad would really want to contact him.

“Did something happen?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

Feng Ying shook her head, “Nothing like that. What about here?”

Yang Kai replied, furrowing his brow, “It’s a bit strange.”

Saying so, he turned to the imprisoned Feudal Lord and asked, “What are you plotting?”

The Feudal Lord was imprisoned and unable to move. He had been beaten black and blue by Yang Kai, and if it weren’t for Yang Kai intentionally keeping him alive to extract information, he would not have survived till now. Although he was captured though, he just sneered and kept his mouth shut.

“If you tell me, I’ll give you a quick death, otherwise I’ll make you suffer a fate worse than death!” Yang Kai warned.

The Feudal Lord turned away his head. The expression on his face said that he was prepared to die.

Yang Kai pushed his spear into the Feudal Lord’s chest, gently stabbing it in, avoiding his vitals. The Black Ink Clansman’s face twisted in pain as he roared, “Black Ink Eternal!”

Yang Kai frowned. It had been a long time since he had heard these words. Judging by the Feudal Lord’s attitude, it was impossible to get anything from him. This Feudal Lord knew that he would not survive, so he stubbornly kept his mouth shut.

What’s more, he had no idea about the higher-ups’ plans. He was just following orders to restrain Yang Kai here at all costs.

Yang Kai tried several other methods, but the Feudal Lord still remained silent. Yang Kai knew that he could not get anything from him and decided to finish him off.

Although he could not get anything, the Feudal Lord’s reaction gave him an eerie feeling. These Black Ink Clansmen clearly knew that they were no match for Yang Kai, but they had still chosen to fight to the death, seemingly stalling for time.

Right then, Yang Kai seemed to have realized something and immediately shouted, “Damn it!”

Saying so, his figure flickered as he disappeared from the spot.

Feng Ying anxiously shouted, “Squad Leader!” But Yang Kai had already disappeared from sight. All she could do now was follow the residual fluctuations of Space Principles and chase after him.

Yang Kai soon arrived at the periphery of the universe fragment where the Black Ink Clan army was stationed. The universe fragment was still shrouded in Black Ink Clouds, making it impossible to see the situation inside.

When he first saw these clouds, he found it a bit strange. Why would the Black Ink Clan waste so much effort to create these Black Ink Clouds? But if they were using it to conceal the movements of their army, it would make sense.

If his guess was correct, then this universe fragment was probably empty!

The Territory Lords had sent 2,000 Black Ink Clansmen to occupy him, while covertly mobilizing their forces. The Black Ink Clan was not stupid.

Although he had some guesses, Yang Kai still wanted to personally verify them, so he dove straight into the Black Ink Clouds.

The facts proved that his guess was right, there really wasn’t a single Black Ink Clansman on this universe fragment. The 200,000-strong Army stationed here had disappeared. Presumably, the Black Ink Clan Army had set out just after he left.

[Is it because they had discovered a Human scout and wanted to take Blue Sky Pass by surprise?]

[Fortunately, things are not that bad. I can instantly return to Dawning Light and report this back to Blue Sky Pass.]

Just as Yang Kai flew out of the universe fragment in a hurry, he ran into Feng Ying who was chasing after him.

Yang Kai hurriedly ordered, “Quickly return to Dawning Light, the Black Ink Clan army has already set out.”

Saying so, Yang Kai took out his Space Beacon and activated it, disappearing the next moment.

Feng Ying didn’t even have time to say anything before Yang Kai had disappeared on her again. She immediately stomped her foot in anger, “That impulsive bastard!”

Left with no choice, she could only activate the Universe Transference Law and return to Dawning Light as well.

On the universe fragment where Dawning Light was concealed, Yang Kai’s figure suddenly appeared next to Miao Fei Ping. The moment he appeared, he hurriedly shouted, “Fei Ping, quickly return to Blue Sky Pass and inform the Army Commanders that the Black Ink Clan’s 200,000-strong Army has started moving… Eh? Martial Uncle Zhong, why are you here? What’s everyone doing here?”

Yang Kai’s face was filled with shock, staring at the figures around him. He was unable to comprehend what was happening.

Zhong Liang asked, furrowing his brow, “You didn’t meet Feng Ying?”

“I met her, she should be back soon,” Yang Kai subconsciously replied.

While they were talking, Feng Ying walked out from Dawning Light’s cabin, obviously having teleported back through the Universe Array; however, she arrived a few breaths later than Yang Kai.

“What’s going on?” Upon looking around, Yang Kai noticed that there were 8,000 people on this universe fragment, preparing for battle. Although everyone was silent, there was a murderous aura lingering in the air. This sight caught Yang Kai by surprise, “Is this… the entire Western Army?”

Feng Ying explained, angrily glaring at him, “When Martial Uncle learned that there were 200,000 Black Ink Clansmen gathered here, he led the Western Army here to ambush them. He plans to eliminate one of the Black Ink Clan Armies before the battle to reduce the pressure on the Great Pass.”

“Why didn’t you tell me this?” Yang Kai looked at her.

Feng Ying rebuked him with a glare, “Did you give me a chance to speak?”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but scratch his nose in embarrassment. It was a mess caused by him.

Zhong Liang asked, “Is there any movement on the Black Ink Clan’s side?”

Yang Kai quickly reported, “I don’t know where the Black Ink Clan Army has gone, but this Junior’s actions must have made them cautious. The Black Ink Clan used Black Ink Clouds to conceal their movements. I don’t know their current location.”
