Xia Ning Chang looked at Yang Kai in total surprise.

She had never thought that even stars were born, aged, weakened, then eventually died. Yang Kai’s words undoubtedly gave her a great shock.

However, since it was her Junior Brother, she naturally believed him.

Thinking of Tong Xuan Realm completely losing its vitality and collapsing into a silent wasteland, Xia Ning Chang’s tender body couldn’t help shiver. She couldn’t imagine just how many would suffer and die if Tong Xuan Realm were really to suffer such a fate.

She suddenly felt extremely forlorn.

“Junior Brother, do you have a way to reinvigorate it?” Xia Ning Chang suddenly asked.

Yang Kai turned his head to her and gently nodded.

“How? Junior Brother, please teach me!” Xia Ning Chang bit her red lips and said eagerly.

“You are the key,” Yang Kai took a deep breath, “Although a Star Source has its own life, it does not possess sentience and is instead a kind of massive gathering of profundities. It choosing you was originally to absorb you, after which Tong Xuan Realm could replenish itself somewhat and delay its approaching death, but if this is handled well, not only will we be able to fully rejuvenate Tong Xuan Realm, but Little Senior Sister will also gain enormous benefits.”

Xia Ning Chang was again shocked.

Yang Kai turned his head away from her and towards the massive grey flames down below.

A Star Source! Since he entered the Star Field, he had often heard about such things, but he had never truly witnessed one before.

Whether the mass of energy in the depths of the floating continent was its Star Source or not remained to be verified.

It could be said that the massive grey fireball in front of him was the first Star Source he had seen!

This was a Heaven-sent opportunity!

The power of a Star Source was extremely terrifying, and anyone who wanted to even approach it had to take a huge risk. It was for this reason that even Origin Kings didn’t dare get close to a Cultivation Star’s Source at will.

Star Sources were also incredibly difficult to refine, and if one was not careful in the process, they would suffer backlash from the full power of a star and instantly die.

Throughout the ages, many Origin King Realm masters had been born in the Star Field who later died while trying to refine a Star Source.

In the current Star Field, there were countless Cultivation Stars; however, there were only a handful of masters who had refined a Star Source and become a true Star Master.

There was no Origin King who treated their own life casually. Many would rather spend their lives cultivating desperately rather than rushing to refine a Star Source.

But now, such an opportunity lay in front of Xia Ning Chang.

Compared with other Cultivation Star Sources, Tong Xuan Realm’s was undoubtedly old and dying.

Because of this, when Xia Ning Chang was possessed by this Source, she would occasionally feel lethargic, lazy, and aged.

It wasn’t because she had become old, but rather that the Star Source was approaching its death!

This Star Source itself had chosen Xia Ning Chang and allowed her to partially refine it.

Although Xia Ning Chang was only a Second-Order Saint King and lacked in terms of cultivation, if she had enough perseverance and courage, she may be able to fully refine this ageing Star Source. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Even Yang Kai was a little envious of this opportunity!

Although there were no doubt some dangers, the arrow had already been shot from its bow so there was no turning back.

The Star Source was already closely connected with Xia Ning Chang, and if it were to perish, Xia Ning Chang would inevitably follow it to the grave. Only by completely refining it would both have a chance to survive.

In the future, as Xia Ning Chang grew and became stronger, this mass of grey flames would also have an opportunity to re-ignite and rejuvenate Tong Xuan Realm with vitality.

Of course, the premise was that Xia Ning Chang became strong enough!

After Yang Kai explained the truth of the matter and what was at stake, Xia Ning Chang nodded without hesitation, “I’m willing to refine it!”

Yang Kai was slightly taken aback at first, but soon smiled and nodded, “Alright, in fact, Little Senior Sister doesn’t need to worry too much. Since it has already chosen you, it must have already decided that you were compatible. Little Senior Sister only needs to work hard to let it fully accept and integrate with you. Once you succeed, you will no longer be separable, and you will become the Star Master of Tong Xuan Realm, the supreme ruler of this star, its destiny and glory will be yours to determine!”

“En,” Xia Ning Chang is nodded heavily, not overwhelmed by the glorious prospects described by Yang Kai but instead asking seriously, “But how exactly should I refine it?”

“Come here, I’ll pass you a special Secret Art for refining Star Sources,” Yang Kai smiled lightly before pulling Xia Ning Chang to sit down nearby.

After Xia Ning Chang let go of her Knowledge Sea defences, Yang Kai sent his Soul Avatar into her Knowledge Sea and began to teach her a profound and mysterious Secret Art.

Star Refining Art!

This was something Yang Kai obtained from the Emperor Garden.

Yang Kai had thought he would have to wait until he needed to refine a Star Source before using this particular Secret Art, but now it had unexpectedly benefited Xia Ning Chang.

This Secret Art had been hidden inside a Stone Monument.

That day, Yang Kai and Shan Qing Luo had encountered Xue Yue in the Emperor Garden and, as a result of their battle, the Stone Monument was destroyed. A stone tablet had emerged from the debris of the Stone Monument with three ancient words inscribed on it.

Xue Yue seemed to value this stone tablet greatly and practically begged Yang Kai to give it to her.

Yang Kai had almost complied.

But in the end, Xue Yue had missed the opportunity to obtain the stone tablet because the Emperor Garden had suddenly closed.

After returning to High Heaven Sect, Yang Kai had studied this stone tablet carefully and realized that it contained a Secret Art called the Star Refining Art. The three ancient words on the stone tablet were the name of this Secret Art.

This Secret Art only had one use: to refine Star Sources. It had been passed down by the Starry Sky Great Emperor and was incredibly profound and mysterious.

Xia Ning Chang using it to refine this Star Source would absolutely yield twice the result with half the effort.

Passing this Secret Art to Xia Ning Chang was simple and only took Yang Kai about half a cup of tea’s time to complete. Not only had he given her the Secret Art itself, he had also passed her all of his own relevant experiences and enlightenments.

Withdrawing his Soul Avatar from her Knowledge Sea, Yang Kai waited quietly.

Xia Ning Chang needed time to understand this Star Refining Art.

The sun set and the moon rose as time silently passed by inside the cave.

After a full month, Xia Ning Chang suddenly opened her beautiful eyes and exhaled gently, her pretty face seeming a little tired but a glow of excitement still filling her expression.

“Junior Brother, I’m ready.”

“Let’s start then,” Yang Kai looked at her with firm eyes.

Xia Ning Chang nodded slightly, got up, and walked towards the crevice.

When she came to the edge of the abyss, she stared down at the mass of grey flames which leapt up from below and her mouth began moving slightly, seemingly communicating with the Star Source, “If by giving you my life, I could reignite you and save the star from death, I would be willing, but if not, please accept me, merge with me, and allow me to stand together with you. I will work hard to cultivate, become stronger as soon as possible, and restore your vitality!”

The huge grey flame below remained motionless, seemingly not reacting at all.

But soon, there was a loud sizzling as the grey flame flickered from side to side, as if it were a giant flower bud that was slowly blooming, allowing Xia Ning Chang inside.

A smile appeared on Xia Ning Chang’s face and she called out softly, “Thank you!”

As soon as these words fell, she jumped down.

Yang Kai’s face changed dramatically.

The situation had developed far faster than he had expected. He hadn’t realized that Little Senior Sister would act so decisively.

By the time he reacted, it was already too late to stop her.

Rushing to the edge of the abyss and looking down, Yang Kai saw that the massive grey flame had actually closed up again, sealing Little Senior Sister inside.

An indescribable force suddenly rushed up from below and threw Yang Kai out towards the distant rock face.

Even if this Star Source was waning and severely weakened, it was still not something Yang Kai could approach easily.

It obviously did not want Yang Kai to interfere with the process.

Yang Kai got up from the ground, his face gloomy, but fortunately he could still feel Little Senior Sister’s aura down below.

And so, he began an extremely nervous wait.

There was nothing he could do to interfere now; he could only wait for the results to appear.

Suddenly, a mystical aura began to defuse through the underground abyss, one that soothed Yang Kai’s irritable mood.

Frowning slightly, he immersed himself in sensing this aura.

Faintly, he seemed to be able to comprehend something.

Hastily closing his eyes, Yang Kai began to investigate carefully.

In the vast Star Field, amidst the endless darkness, there was nothing, not even light. This seemed to be an extremely ancient age, one that was impossible to trace.

Yang Kai looked around but could not see anything, not even himself.

Time passed little by little in this desolate loneliness.

He didn’t know how many hundreds of thousands of years passed, but all of a sudden, one day, amidst the dark and boundless Star Field, a little light suddenly appeared. This light was small at first, but it soon spread out like fire across a prairie.

The entire Star Field became turbulent from this massive shockwave of energy.

Millions of large or small meteorites flew about before gathering together and merging under the influence of some kind of magical force.

Many grains of sand would eventually build a tower, and gradually, a star appeared in the Star Field.

This was a newly born star, without any energy fluctuations, and still engulfed in darkness. It drifted along like a helpless child wandering the vast Star Field without any destination, even forgetting where it originally came from.

Millions of years passed, and finally, this wandering star arrived at a massive Sun Star and for the first time felt a gentle light full of warmth.

It stopped here and began to orbit around this Sun Star.

Gradually, life began to sprout on its surface as green plants and flowers pushed up from the ground.

After millions of years of evolution, finally, sentient creatures began to appear on this star. They were ancient creatures belonging to the oldest of races.

They eagerly learnt, grew, and became stronger as they lived.

They branched out and soon split into different races.

Human Race, Monster Race, Demon Race, and many other strange races.

No longer satisfied with the life they currently had, these races began to fight for various resources, discovered ways to make themselves stronger, and eventually began to cultivate.

Some races perished while others rose and became stronger.

Silavin: Hey guys, I just read a few comments and this has been coming up over and over again.

‘What happened to Yang Kai’s Demonic Transformation?’

It has merged with his Yang Qi to form the Demonic Black Flame.

To be fair, it is logical to think he is still able to use it. But, then again, he also does not use Yang Qi anymore. So, we could think of it that the two Qis within his body has fully merged, which created the Demonic Black Flame.
