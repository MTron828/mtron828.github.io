“Senior Sister, I’m sleepy,” Yang Kai muttered under his breath.

“Get some rest. You’ll see me again when you open your eyes.” Qu Hua Shang pulled him closer to her embrace.

In the meantime, Yu Xiang Die and Chen Xiu were waiting patiently outside the Samsara Pavilion. This place was where hearts were trained, not where one would cultivate. Therefore, even though the Samsara Pavilion was amazing, it didn’t have the same advantage as Small Source Worlds in which time would pass by quicker.

The speed at which time flowed in the Samsara Worlds and the outside world was the same.

It had been three months since Yang Kai entered the Samsara Pavilion, and no one knew what was going on with him inside. It wasn’t certain if he shattered Qu Hua Shang’s Heart Barrier or had even found her.

Certainly, they were worried, but as outsiders, their worries were meaningless. It all hinged on Yang Kai’s own capabilities.

It was because of this matter that Yu Xiang Die and Chen Xiu, who had been fellow Brother and Sister for thousands of years, got into a conflict. Presently, they were dozens of metres apart as they sat on empty clearings and waited patiently.

Just then, a figure stepped out of the shopping district just outside of the Samsara Pavilion.

Sensing something, Chen Xiu immediately opened his eyes and glanced at that person. Following that, he let out a breath almost imperceptibly.

Yu Xiang Die noticed the person as well. There was a surprised expression on her face as she watched Tao Ling Wan coming over.

This couldn’t be helped, as Tao Ling Wan came out too soon!

No one had ever managed to leave the Samsara Pavilion so soon after entering it; however, Yu Xiang Die recalled something as she narrowed her eyes and put on a smug smile.

“Honoured Master!” Tao Ling Wan walked up to Chen Xiu and saluted him in an elegant manner.

Chen Xiu examined her to make sure that she was completely fine and healthy. He parted his lips in an attempt to express his concern, but he was not able to say anything. In the end, he just nodded, “I’m glad that you’re back.”

“I’m sorry for worrying you.” Tao Ling Wan hung her head low.

Yu Xiang Die approached her and asked, “Did you meet Yang Boy?”

Tao Ling Wan nodded gently.

“How was it?”

After giving it a thought, Tao Ling Wan replied, “I believe he must have helped Junior Sister Qu restore her memory.”

Yu Xiang Die’s eyes brightened when she heard that. Then, she let out a breath, “That’s good. That’s good.”

Chen Xiu asked, “Did you see him?”

Tao Ling Wan nodded her head, “Yes.”

Chen Xiu stopped asking further. Since Yang Kai had helped Qu Hua Shang restore her memory, it meant that he had broken her Heart Barrier; hence, he had succeeded in this life. On the other hand, Feng Cheng Si had not managed to achieve his goal even though it had been eight or so years since he entered the Samsara Pavilion.

Although Chen Xiu had already expected it, he was still disappointed upon learning the outcome.

As they spoke, Feng Cheng Si stepped out of the Samsara Pavilion and saluted Chen Xiu and Yu Xiang Die.

Like a friendly Senior, Yu Xiang Die patted the young man’s shoulder and comforted him by saying, “Sincerity can never be forced. You must not think that you’re inferior to the other party just because you’ve lost this competition. You’re a Core Disciple of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven after all, and a bright future is ahead of you. However, love is not something which one can control at will.”

Feng Cheng Si obediently saluted her, “Many thanks for your teaching, Martial Aunt.”

A gleeful Yu Xiang Die then shot Chen Xiu a glance and mocked, “So what if you’ve done everything you can to set others up? Look at the outcome now. You’re the one who has suffered a setback in the end. I suggest that you stop being so short-sighted, Senior Brother.”

A dispassionate Chen Xiu glanced at her, “Wan’er is my Disciple as well as a member of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven.”

Yu Xiang Die batted her eyes and suddenly said through clenched teeth, “It’s basically a buy-one-get-one-free deal. We have made a loss!”

Tao Ling Wan started blushing furiously. She found it hard to deal with Yu Xiang Die, who could be unrestrained in her words sometimes, and when she thought of the fact that she had to face Qu Hua Shang in the future, she couldn’t help feeling guilty.

Although she was just executing her Honoured Master’s orders, she was the one who had acted in the end.

After struggling internally for a bit, Yu Xiang Die made up her mind, “Senior Brother, be prepared. When that brat exits the Samsara Pavilion, we’ll let him marry Xiao Hua Shang and Wan’er.”

Chen Xiu arched his brow, “How are they going to get married?”

Yu Xiang Die snorted, “Of course he has to get married into Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. No Core Disciple has ever left the Sect after getting married.”

There was finally a smile on Chen Xiu’s usually stern-looking face. He nodded and said, “That’s wonderful! You should stay here then. I’ll tell the higher-ups about it and let them make a decision.”

Yu Xiang Die bowed her head, after which Chen Xiu left the place with his Disciples. The conflict between them was resolved after they came to an agreement.

…

Some heavy things seemed to have pressed against Yang Kai’s body as he realised that it was pitch-black around him.

He tried his best to break free from this situation but to no avail; he even found it increasingly difficult to breathe.

For a moment, he thought that he was going to lose his life here and now.

After falling off the cliff alongside Qu Hua Shang, he moved on to the next life; however, he had not the foggiest idea about the situation in this place. As soon as he opened his eyes, he realised that he was buried beneath some things. The sounds of people wailing and dying could faintly be heard, but they soon quieted down.

Just then, a ray of light came into his sight as the heavy things on his figure were taken away.

He got to his feet with difficulty and immediately examined his body.

When he was beneath the heavy objects, Yang Kai already felt that something was off, and upon first examination, he realised what was wrong.

Presently, he was just a boy around twelve or thirteen years old. It was no wonder that he didn’t have much strength as his body had shrunk.

[What the!?] Yang Kai secretly cursed. The reason he entered this Samsara World was to break Qu Hua Shang’s Heart Barrier. In order to do that, he had to win her heart.

How was such a young brat supposed to do that? Did he have to grow up first?

At this moment, he was standing on some debris. It was apparent that he was pressed under a collapsed house just now.

He caught a whiff of a pleasant scent as a figure came into his sight. Looking up, he instantly saw the familiar face.

The words ‘Senior Sister Qu’ almost spurted out of his mouth.

Presently, Qu Hua Shang was just standing in front of him. She was clad in tight-fitting clothes with a sword at her waist. She tapped the dust off his shoulder and asked gently, “Are you alright, little one?”

[Little one…] Yang Kai’s brow twitched.

“Where are your parents?” Qu Hua Shang asked.

Yang Kai didn’t know how to reply to her.

Thinking that he was still reeling from the shock, Qu Hua Shang hesitated for a bit before letting out a sigh. Then, she bent her back and took his hand, “Don’t be afraid. You should follow me from now on. I’ll protect you.”

Yang Kai had the urge to curse.

This would definitely be a life that he would never want to look back on. He could already imagine that when he and Qu Hua Shang got out of the Samsara Pavilion, she would certainly tease him whenever she remembered this.

However, there was nothing he could do at this moment. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

With that said, he felt fortunate that he saw Qu Hua Shang as soon as he opened his eyes. He could grow up by her side and slowly get closer to her heart.

All of a sudden, he recalled what Meng Ru said to him when she carried him up and jumped off the cliff.

“I’m sorry for what happened in this life. Let me protect you in the next!”

Her wish had been granted. In this life, it would be her turn to protect him.

The Samsara Pavilion was indeed an amazing place where sincerity was of utmost importance. When Meng Ru jumped off the cliff, she must have had a strong desire to protect Yang Kai in the next life, which was why her wish was granted after the reincarnation.

In this life, Qu Hua Shang was one of the brightest disciples in a major Sect. Not only was she talented and powerful, she was also beautiful. She had countless admirers within the Sect, and even the rising stars from other Sects had heard of her.

There was never a lack of people who proposed marriage to her, which made Yang Kai feel apprehensive as he was worried that the Sect’s Elders would pressure her to accept one of those proposals.

Fortunately, she was an important figure in the Sect, so she had a say in this matter. If she didn’t agree, no one could force her.

After Yang Kai was brought back to the Sect, he became a disciple and started cultivating under her tutelage.

They rapidly became closer to each other. In this life, Qu Hua Shang was like a Master or Elder Sister to him.

As time passed, Yang Kai grew up to be an adult. Unfortunately, in this life, his aptitude was terrible. Regardless of how hard he cultivated, he was still much weaker than Qu Hua Shang.

Perhaps it had something to do with Meng Ru’s last wish. He reckoned that he would really have to be protected by Qu Hua Shang in his life.

Additionally, since he was an adult now, he realised that she started looking at him with a different kind of gaze, which was filled with a sense of longing.

This made him feel secretly pleased.

As she continued to protect and take care of him, her love for the man became increasingly conspicuous; however, due to the difference between their age and seniority, she wouldn’t dare to cross the boundary.

Upon that realisation, Yang Kai decided to take the initiative to pursue her. She would always blush and feel her heart pounding against her chest whenever he approached her.

When he turned twenty years old, there was finally a breakthrough in their relationship.

Following Yang Kai’s years of pursuit, she finally cast away the worries in her heart and accepted the man, who was ten years younger than she was and who she had saved all those years ago.

The Heart Barrier was shattered, and Qu Hua Shang once again recovered her memory.

There wasn’t really any difficulty to speak of in this life, it just took Yang Kai a lot of time to win her heart. With that said, he once again experienced the abstrusity of the Samsara Pavilion this time.

As one’s memory was repeatedly sealed, they could realise their true heart and train it more effectively.

This was true for both Yang Kai and Qu Hua Shang.

Every reincarnation and success meant a new start.

For the first three lives, it wasn’t difficult for Yang Kai. Be it Meng Ru in the first life, his Senior Sister in the second life, or the Little Sister in the neighbouring village in the third life, he could immediately find Qu Hua Shang and start taking action.

As long as he could find her, the rest wouldn’t be hard. That was because her Heart Barriers had something to do with him, so he had a natural advantage when it came to breaking them.

However, after the third life, the difficulty began to increase.

In the fourth life, it took him half a year before he found Qu Hua Shang, and during that period of time, he came across a lot of danger and almost lost his life.
