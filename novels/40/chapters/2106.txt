Yang Kai had handed over some instructions to Liu Yan then hid in the Sealed World Bead...

Liu Yan’s identity was quite special and she couldn’t travel around. That’s why he just asked her to stay in the Zhang family’s residence outside the city. He had no better choice!

In Yang Kai’s short moment of sobriety, he considered many matters.

His situation was very precarious. He might have lost his mind and turned into a real demon, and if he hadn’t hidden in the Sealed World Bead and stayed outside and ran amok, then Chen Wen Hao and his companions would have caught his trail and slew him.

Moreover, he lusted for the slaughter of all living beings in that bloodthirsty state, and if he ended up venturing into Maplewood City, he would have slaughtered everyone in the city; that’s why he had to stay in the Small Sealed World.

...

Inside the Sealed World Bead, Yang Kai’s consciousness was currently quite muddled. If the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus in his Knowledge Sea didn’t protect the last strand of his consciousness, he would have already been engulfed by that great power and would have lost any sense of self.

At this moment, the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus was fighting ceaselessly against the Ancient Great Demon’s Demon Sense, and they were evenly matched, while Yang Kai didn’t have any solution to reverse this situation.

If it was just an issue within his Knowledge Sea’s, then it would have been fine, as he wouldn’t end up losing his sense of self thanks to the potent Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus. Unfortunately, an unimaginable amount of pure Demon Qi had accumulated in his body. His body had absorbed the Demon Qi which engulfed tens of thousand miles, and it had even absorbed the Demonic Beings’ Demon Qi!

The Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus was quite potent, but its effects were limited to his soul and it couldn’t provide any help to his fleshly body.

If he couldn’t solve his body’s issue, then he would sooner or later fall into the Ancient Great Demon Dao.

Repressed and muffled roars were echoing ceaselessly, and even the Small Sealed World was affected by Yang Kai’s emotions, its World Energy descended into chaos.

...

Hua Qing Si’s face was pale, and she was hiding next to the Embodiment’s foot, as its thick and large thigh served as a natural shelter, while her pretty eyes were staring at the source of the noise.

She had a powerful cultivation base at the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, yet in the face of the Energy Ripples created by Yang Kai, she felt like a little boat among giant waves, which would be toppled at any moment.

The Embodiment’s expression was grave, and his worry was apparent in his bright eyes, but it didn’t have any countermeasure.

Gradually, the roars turned louder, and it seemed like Yang Kai started obeying his instinct and he started destroying everything in sight in the Small Sealed World. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

A storm of sand and rubble arose, while the land cracked open, the mountains quacked ceaselessly and broken rocks tumbled around.

At a certain moment, the ceaseless roars suddenly came to a stop and the havoc in the land had also come to an end.

Hua Qing Si observed him with her senses for a moment then asked with great difficulty, “What... happened over there?”

The Embodiment squinted his eyes, as if his gaze was able to penetrate the void, then said in a deep voice, “It looks like he came back to his senses for now.”

“If I seek him now and ask him to let me out... What’ll be the outcome?” Hua Qing Si couldn’t bear spending her days in fear here and a ridiculous idea sprang to her mind.

“You can give it a try,” The Embodiment cast a glance at her then looked back at a distant location and exclaimed in surprise.

Soon after, his eyes lit up and he said, “That’s right, that thing may be effective against him.”

“What thing?” Hua Qing Si asked in surprise.

The Embodiment didn’t pay heed to her, and she could only pout in response.

...

On the other side, Yang Kai drew help from his Knowledge Sea’s power to recover his sobriety for a moment and he rushed toward the medicine garden.

In his last moment of clarity, he had already realized where the issue lied, and it was precisely the abundant Demon Qi in his body. If he couldn’t solve the Demon Qi’s issue, then he would never get rid of the Ancient Great Demon’s Demon Sense plaguing him.

He had suddenly recalled the Immortal Tree planted in the medicine garden.

That Immortal Tree was indestructible as everlasting as the world itself. It had lived from ancient times to the present.

If he could find a way to fuse it with his body, then he wouldn’t just get the legendary Undying Body, he would also get the Immortal Tree’s power and would be able to contend against the Demon Qi in his body and quell it.

Yang Kai had already refined the Sealed World Bead and he could control the Small Sealed World with his thoughts.

With a mere thought, he arrived into the medicine garden and sat cross-legged in front of the Immortal Tree. He started circulating his Secret Art and tried to absorb the Immortal Tree’s power.

When he had just gotten the Immortal Tree, he had once tried to refine it, yet couldn’t find any way to achieve this feat and had to give up in the end.

At that time, he was a First-Order Origin King, and the reason behind his failure might have been his low cultivation base.

At this moment, he had already reached the First-Order Dao Source Realm, and his cultivation base was higher than last time by a whole Great Realm, so he should give it another try.

But, he quickly discovered that despite his First-Order Dao Source Realm’s cultivation base, he still wasn’t able to absorb the Immortal Tree’s power. The Immortal Tree had taken root in the medicine garden, and it wasn’t really tall, but the astonishing Life Force emitted by it filled the whole Small Sealed World with abundant vitality. Sadly, he still couldn’t absorb and use even a strand of its Life Force.

Yang Kai’s gaze turned gloomy and a wisp of despair welled up in his heart.

Usually, such a weak emotion wouldn’t have been anything serious, but he was now plagued by an Ancient Demon Sense. His despair had been spread out by the Ancient Demon Sense and the whole Small Sealed World’s ambience turned heavy. Even Hua Qing Si, who was in a distant region, was engulfed by despair and a heartbroken expression appeared on her pretty face. She looked quite pitiful!

She had been affected by his emotions and she felt like she saw herself stranded in this strange dimension for life and she stayed here until she grew old then died.

Even on her deathbed, only this huge rock was accompanying her.

She quickly stretched her hand to wipe the corner of her eye and she found out that her finger ended up moist.

“Alas!” The Embodiment let out a heavy sigh.

“Why am I suddenly so heartbroken?” Hua Qing Si raised her head to look at the Embodiment while wiping her eyes ceaselessly. Her tears were flowing out none stop and she could only wipe them one time after the other fruitlessly.

The Embodiment stretched his large hand which wasn’t any smaller than a large door and patted Hua Qing Si’s head.

The beauty’s body was pushed down, and she said in an adorable voice, “I’m so sad! Why did I end up crying so much... Huh? It’s so annoying, my tears won’t stop...”

As she spoke, her eyes had already turned red and swollen like a peach.

“Huh...” The Embodiment exclaimed in surprise once again and he suddenly stood up. His eyes gazed at a distant region, and his eyes trembled intensely as if he had just seen an inconceivable matter. He couldn’t help but cry out, “This is...”

In the medicine garden, Yang Kai was still sitting down cross-legged in front of the Immortal Tree and trying to absorb its power to no avail, yet he ended up absorbing a different power.

The Golden-Silver Tree near the Immortal Tree shook lightly and shone with two different radiances: Extremely pure gold and silver radiance.

The golden and silver radiances weren’t any different than spirits dancing in the wind and they turned into innumerable specks of light, butterfly-like specks of light that revolved around Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was taken aback!

After he had killed the Wood Spirit, he got a seed and planted it, and it had grown into the Golden-Silver Tree.

At that time, the seed had also been both golden and silver and each colour occupied half of the seed surface, but Yang Kai had no idea what kind of seed it was.

However, the Wood Spirit had lived for a long time, and it should have been an Ancient Exotic Ancient Tree that had gained sentience. In other words, that said seed was an Exotic Ancient Tree’s seed.

Originally, he planned to study it slowly, but at this moment, the Golden-Silver Tree released a mysterious power and he was taken aback by it.

While Yang Kai was still in a trance, the golden and silver light specks flew into his body and disappeared.

Yang Kai was surprised and he revealed a bitter smile.

He had no idea about the effect of the golden and silver light specks and he didn’t know whether they would pose any threat to him, but his body had already been engulfed by the abundant Demon Qi and he didn’t mind getting something else. In any case, he was already in trouble.

So, Yang Kai just lowered his guard and allowed them to enter his body.

In the next moment, his body shook and his eyes widened up and shone with bright light.

It looked like the Demon Qi billowing on the surface of his body was restrained by something and it let out a roar, then drilled into his body through his pores.

In a short while, Yang Kai’s body was revealed again.

Meanwhile, the Demon Qi inside his body had been compressed by an unknown force and it gathered in a certain region of his body.

Even though the Demon Qi was pretty terrifying, that mysterious force wasn’t a pushover and it was very powerful. It had driven out the Demon Qi like it was herding sheep and pushed it into his belly.

Soon after, a burning pain transmitted from his belly and he let out a pained cry in spite of himself, but that burning pain quickly turned into a bone-chilling cold.

He couldn’t refrain from shivering, and he felt like even his bloodstream was frozen.

But, before he could get used to this change, it changed back into a burning pain, then cold, and so on.

He didn’t know how long this cycle lasted, and it was only after he had been tormented for so long that a golden and silver light suddenly emanated from his belly.

Yang Kai’s body shook and he faintly realized something. He pulled open his clothes and took a look. He could see two golden and silver lights moving around in his belly like little fish.

Moreover, as they moved around, a mysterious and abstruse pattern was gradually formed, as if it had been imprinted there.

After a moment, the golden and silver light flickered brightly then disappeared. As for Yang Kai, he let out a miserable scream then dropped down unconscious.

A light breeze blew over, and the Small Sealed World regained its calm.

...

In a distant region, the Embodiment was mumbling, “What’s that?”

“What’s what?” Hua Qing Si had already gotten over that boundless sadness and she rubbed her eyes, as she said coyly, “Did that guy die?”

The Embodiment cast a glance at her and said with a smile, “I’ll have to disappoint you, he’s still living well.”

“Damn!” Hua Qing Si gnashed her teeth, “He has made me cry like a little girl.” Her shame was apparent on her face and she said resentfully, “I’ll surely avenge this humiliation.”

After she spoke, she turned into the Embodiment and said, “Big Stone, you’ll help me, won’t you?”

“Huh? Do you have any feasible plan for carrying out your revenge?” The Embodiment gazed at her with great interest.

Hua Qing Si revealed a smile, and as her beautiful hair fluttered in the wind, she looked like the quintessence of beauty, and this said beauty said, “A hero can’t escape a beauty’s honey trap.”

Upon hearing this, the Embodiment nodded and commended her.
