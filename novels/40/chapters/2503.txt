Both Duan Hong Chen and Wu Kuang turned a deaf ear to Yang Kai.

“Hey, I’m talking to the both of you,” Yang Kai looked at the two angrily, “Can you give some reaction?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Wu Kuang only replied coldly, “This King will leave here immediately if you get rid of him!”

Duan Hong Chen bellowed, “How embarrassing it is for you to say such things to deceive children. Wu Kuang, you’re even more shameless than before!” He spurned Wu Kuang fiercely, and then looked straight at Yang Kait, “Boy, bear with it. The two of us are going to fight to the death right here, right now. You can only consider yourself unlucky if your Soul gets stamped out because of this, but if you can survive by some chance, you will benefit infinitely!”

Yang Kai sighed in surrender, “Fine. Go ahead and do your best, Senior Hong Chen. This Junior will take care of himself.”

Duan Hong Chen laughed with great excitement, “Boy, with your affirmation, this Old Master will go all out!”

As the words fell, he performed a hand seal and palmed towards Wu Kuang.

Wu Kuang’s face changed drastically as he snarled, “Are you being serious?”

“Do you think I am playing with you?” Duan Hong Chen responded coldly.

“This King is furious now! Duan Hong Chen, don’t think you will be able to leave this place alive, because this King will extinguish your Soul even if he has to risk inflicting serious injuries on himself!”

Even the most docile person would lose their temper after being hounded so persistently, let alone the famous Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. He was forced into a corner by Duan Hong Chen time and time again, and it did not stop even when his Soul escaped to this place. Wu Kuang had to give his all in such a dire situation.

The two had already begun battling each other as they spoke, and in an instant, Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea started tumbling, setting off huge waves as the two figures combated back and forth across the ocean of flames.

This was a battle of Souls, far more perilous than an ordinary life or death battle.

The tactics used by the two Great Emperors were all Soul Techniques, and visible rings of halos surfaced into sight whenever their Divine Senses collided.

Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea was completely vulnerable.

As soon as Duan Hong Chen made his first move, Yang Kai had already zoomed to the centre of the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus island, spurring its power with all his strength to protect him.

No matter how well he protected himself, though, it was impossible for him to feel at ease when the Soul Avatars of two Great Emperors were fighting in his Knowledge Sea. He was literally their battlefield, and all he could rely on now was the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus.

This was a Supreme Treasure that nourished his Soul, and it was so valuable that even the great Heaven Devouring Great Emperor had searched for it across countless Star Fields in the past.

Yang Kai was guarded by a layer of impregnable seven coloured light, with the fallout from the attacks of the two Great Emperors only managing to cause ripples on its barrier, leaving Yang Kai unscathed.

Noticing this, Yang Kai finally calmed down. He was truly afraid that the Soul Warming Lotus would not be effective, leaving him in deep trouble.

But even with the protection of the Soul Warming Lotus, Yang Kai still had a head-splitting headache. His Soul Avatar trembled restlessly, as if every inch of his body was being torn apart.

Every attack by Duan Hong Chen and Wu Kuang was like slashes from a sharp blade on his Soul, inevitably inflicting some trauma to him.

This was where the marvellous effects of the Soul Warming Lotus came in. Whenever the tearing pain hit Yang Kai, a gentle force would follow and spread throughout his body, like invisible soft hands, gently healing Yang Kai’s pain, allowing him to settle down within a short period of time.

Gradually, Yang Kai got used to this feeling.

He no longer felt much pain and instead began to focus his attention on the two Great Emperors.

Every movement of these two was imprinted in his mind clearly.

Yang Kai absolutely would not be able to do this if it happened somewhere else; but inside his Knowledge Sea, everything was within his perception, and no matter how fast Wu Kuang and Duan Hong Chen exchanged attacks, or how fierce their techniques were, he could sense everything clearly.

Yang Kai was constantly amazed as he gazed fixedly at this battle.

Because the two Great Emperors were constantly displaying mysterious Soul Techniques and wondrous uses of their Spiritual Energy.

It was no wonder Duan Hong Chen had said earlier that if he could survive by chance, he would benefit infinitely. This was what he meant.

In this situation, when none of the Secret Techniques used by the two Great Emperors could escape Yang Kai’s observation, he could freely comprehend the mysteries behind these techniques. This was far more efficient than being carefully taught by a Master, allowing Yang Kai to obtain great enlightenment.

It was as if the two Great Emperors were trying their best to pass down to Yang Kai their various Divine Abilities, allowing him to soak up all their comprehensions and knowledge without the slightest concealment.

After observing for a while, Yang Kai was deeply shocked as he realized just how great the disparity in the understanding of the use of Spiritual Energy was between him and these two Great Emperors.

For example, with the amount of power Yang Kai would need to smash a giant rock, the two Great Emperors would be able to split a mountain. This was the difference.

Yang Kai was exhilarated as he found that this rare opportunity gave him a very high starting point. Even if he had not broken through to the Emperor Realm and was still just a Third-Order Dao Source Realm, after witnessing this battle, his strength would be at least several times greater than before.

If Spiritual Energy could have such a magical effect, so could Qi.

He suddenly opened his mouth to yell, “Senior Hong Chen, there’s no need to hold back, Junior is fine!”

After watching for a while, he found that Duan Hong Chen had fallen into an unfavourable position, being completely suppressed by Wu Kuang, and was forced back constantly.

Duan Hong Chen’s Spiritual Energy was not inferior to Wu Kuang’s, but Duan Hong Chen was still somewhat cautious about causing damage to Yang Kai, so he dared not use too much power.

Regardless of the boldness in his statement earlier, he was still a person who cared for the common people, so, naturally, he would take Yang Kai’s well being into consideration.

Hearing this, Duan Hong Chen stole a glance at Yang Kai in the midst of battle. His eyes lit up when he saw the island transformed from the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus and laughed in relief, “Good, there will be no possible consequences that could hold back this Old Master now!”

Seeing the body of Soul Warming Lotus at a glance, he knew that it was protecting Yang Kai firmly, making it so that he suffered no permanent effects from the battle between the two Great Emperors, regardless of how fierce it was.

When his words fell, his momentum surged and he immediately met Wu Kuang’s attack equally without restraint.

Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea was further disturbed by the increasingly violent impact and techniques, but his Soul Avatar was guarded by the Soul Warming Lotus and would not suffer serious injuries no matter what happened to his Knowledge Sea.

Yang Kai gradually immersed his consciousness in studying the mysterious Soul Techniques and the utilizations of Spiritual Energy, unable to extricate himself. He felt like there was a new door slowly being pushed open before his eyes, allowing him to see a glimmer of dazzling light inside.

The battle between the two Great Emperors was getting more intense, with both sides suffering from multiple injuries, yet the luminosity of their Soul Avatars still flashed wildly, both holding a fair chance of winning in the end.

This was a battle of life and death, and neither side planned to stop without seeing the other dead.

As time passed, the power displayed by the two gradually weakened due to overconsumption and severe injuries.

The tumbling Knowledge Sea began to calm down, no longer rioting about madly.

After what seemed like a long time, Yang Kai, who was still lost in his comprehension, suddenly heard a low voice reach his ear, “Boy!”

Yang Kai was shocked and broke out from his trance.

He looked up fixedly in a daze.

He was unaware of when the battle between the two Great Emperors had stopped, but now the two Soul Avatars were interlocked by a kind of technique that pinned one another in place.

The radiance of the two Soul Avatars was dim and their auras were so faint that they looked as if they could be snuffed out at any time.

Duan Hong Chen looked solemn, while Wu Kuang had a gloomy expression, but neither was willing to let go.

“How can I help you, Senior?” Yang Kai asked solemnly.

“Attack us with your strongest Soul Technique, one that could extinguish our Souls,” Duan Hong Chen bellowed through gritted teeth.

Yang Kai’s face changed slightly.

Wu Kuang looked cold and stole a glance at Yang Kai before disdainfully snorting, “Duan Hong Chen, have you gone senile? What secret technique could a trivial newly promoted Emperor possess that could hurt us?”

Duan Hong Chen grinned in reply, “This boy is no ordinary person, you will know what the consequences from underestimating him will be soon enough.”

Wu Kuang responded superciliously, “Then this King will wait and see.”

Duan Hong Chen growled, “What are you still waiting for? This old thing is waiting for you to show your skills, broaden his horizons!”

“Senior…” Yang Kai hesitated.

Duan Hong Chen burst out shouting before he could finish, “If Wu Kuang is reborn, the tragedy of tens of thousands of years ago will repeat. This Old Master has waited tens of thousands of years for today’s opportunity and was always prepared to risk his life to see it through! It is impossible to have such an opportunity again, do not disappoint this Old Master!”

He used a Secret Technique when he was shouting, causing his determined voice to ring like a bell in the morning and a drum in the evening, oscillating in Yang Kai’s ears, agitating him.

Their eyes met, and Yang Kai clearly saw the plea in Duan Hong Chen’s eyes and felt the determination in his heart.

Yang Kai stood in awe and slowly got up from the Soul Warming Lotus before walking over step by step towards the two of them.

Yang Kai inquired solemnly as he stopped above them, “Does Senior want Junior to pass on any message to Temple Master Wen?”

Duan Hong Chen grinned and replied carefreely, “No, he knows what this Old Master has been doing all these years!”

Yang Kai nodded before bowing, saying with a deep, grieving voice, “Then may Senior… go in peace!”

Duan Hong Chen closed his eyes with a faint smile.

Wu Kuang looked at Yang Kai coldly but remained silent, simply staring at him disdainfully, obviously doubtful that Yang Kai could really kill him.

“Sabre!” Yang Kai roared, his eyes shining brightly. He stretched out his hand, and a sabre immediately materialised, one that emitted a strange buzz, seemingly sensing the restlessness in its master’s heart.
