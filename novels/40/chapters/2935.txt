Offending the Dragon Clan was no joke. The Dragon Clan was proud and always proclaimed themselves the leaders of the myriad spirits. If they had known that the visitor was a Dragon Clan member, none of the Emperors present would have rushed in like that. But this Red Dragon charged over at such a sensitive time without so much as an introduction, so who would be able to curb their instinct to react?

Attacking a member of the Dragon Clan was equivalent to humiliating them, which was definitely a big problem. Fortunately, whether the visitor was friend or foe was unknown to them earlier, so they held back a little when they attacked and did not go all out. Otherwise, if they wounded this Dragon Clan member, then everyone present would have to suffer.

“You have the guts to act but not the guts to admit it?” The Red Dragon roared, “You lowly ants. All of you will die!”

At these words, the faces of many Emperor Realm Masters changed dramatically. A Dragon wasn’t easy to deal with, and an enraged Dragon was even harder to reason with. It was true that over a hundred Emperor Realm Masters did not need to fear a single Dragon if they joined hands, but so what if they beat him? He had Dragon Island behind him. If Dragon Island really was provoked, then the entire Star Boundary would be thrown into chaos, the result of which would be hundreds to thousands of times more serious than the resurrection of the Demon Spirits.

The Red Dragon was obviously truly incensed. As soon as he was done shouting, he was just about to strike. Wen Zi Shan’s expression turned solemn, and he decided that even if he had to offend Dragon Island, he could not allow so many Emperor Realm Masters to die here in Azure Sun Temple. He secretly connected with the temple’s Sect Defending Array, ready to make a move at the slightest danger.

“Wait!” Lei Hong shouted and stood out.

“Old thing, you also attacked me earlier!” The Red Dragon hovered in the sky, its huge body providing a strong visual impact and mental pressure on everyone. Now, it suddenly bent its body down, and its dragon head was less than ten metres away from Lei Hong, its dragon eyes even bigger than small huts staring at him with hostility.

Everyone was sweating for Lei Hong.

Lei Hong, however, just cupped his fists and spoke, “May I ask if this venerable one is from… the legendary Dragon Island from the Eastern Sea?”

“So what if I am?” The Red Dragon puffed out hot air from its nostrils. Lei Hong’s body was glowing, and his hair was a little burnt from the scorching earlier.

“So it’s true…” Lei Hong suddenly had a look of realization and smiled, “There are rumours that Dragon Island is located somewhere on the Eastern Sea, and that Great Dragons could be found on the island. None have ever seen them, but even so, the fame of Dragon Island was still as great as that of the Great Emperors’ Sects. It is truly fortunate that this one had the opportunity to witness this today.”

It was rare to see the Great Elder of Star Soul Palace shower flattery on another so openly. All the Emperor Realm Masters were dumbfounded when they heard this.

But these words had a miraculous effect.

Everyone could clearly feel that the Red Dragon’s anger subsided a lot, and his huge dragon head moved away from Lei Hong slightly. Nodding aloofly, he said in a powerful voice, “Heh, seems like you still have some knowledge, Old Thing, to know the prestige of our Dragon Island. But of course, who in this world knows not of my Dragon Island’s name? How can a trivial Great Emperor Sect compare?”

Lei Hong laughed dryly. Even though he didn’t feel too pleased about this Dragon’s words, he couldn’t show it on his face.

After all, he was the Great Elder of a Great Emperor’s Sect, so the word ‘trivial’ uttered by the Red Dragon naturally caused him discomfort. However, he knew deeply the nature of the Dragon Clan, so he did not dwell on the matter lest he add fuel to the fire.

On the other hand, it was as if the Red Dragon had his itch scratched and he began boasting about himself, “My Dragon Clan is just not willing to compete with you lowly ants for fame and fortune. Otherwise, if my Dragon Island’s elites step out, then it doesn’t matter what Great Emperor this or Great Emperor that, all of them have to step aside! Do you believe that I can drown you all with a mouthful of spittle?”

The more he spoke, the more outrageous his words became, drawing frowns from all the Emperor Realm Masters. Lei Hong saw this and quickly interrupted him, “The Dragon Clan has not shown itself for so long, so it is the first time we have set our eyes upon its members. That is why we were unable to recognize this venerable one during his approach. We thought that an enemy had come, and that was why we acted hastily. Everything was just a misunderstanding.”

“Yes, yes! We were all too impulsive just now. Please do not mind it, Sir!”

“If Sir had shown Sir’s true form earlier, then we would not have attacked you.”

“It is truly a blessing to be able to see the true form of a Great Dragon today.”

“…”

The group of people clamoured on. Everyone could see that though the Red Dragon was grumpy and hard to get along with, it seemed to have soft ears and his anger could easily be quenched just by a few good words. This was also a common problem of those that were overly proud. Since they were so proud, they naturally did not wish to bother too much with people who are overly humble.

For a while, the crowd was not stingy with singing their praises.

Listening to them eased the mind and body of the Great Dragon. His anger which was just like a volcano that was about to erupt earlier had now dissipated, and he let out a soft grunt, “Forget it. I can’t be bothered to deal with you lot either. We can just forget about what happened just now. But next time, you better open your eyes and take a good look before you act.”

All of them breathed out sighs of relief while Wen Zi Shan also dispersed the energy he gathered and shot Lei Hong a grateful look.

Many things happened at the temple and he himself had been injured in the Divine Ascension Mirror World. His mind was occupied with all sorts of troubles now, so if Lei Hong had not dealt with the situation in a timely and proper manner, Wen Zhi Shan would probably be embroiled in even more problems now. If the Emperor Realm Masters were to get into a conflict with the Red Dragon, then it didn’t matter who won or lost in the end as Azure Sun Temple was bound to suffer.

Lei Hong smiled in response, indicating that he didn’t have to worry about it.

Wen Zi Shan cupped his fists to the sky next, “Since Venerable One is from Dragon Island, may I ask which Sir of Dragon Island this venerable one is?”

“This Dragon is Zhu Lie!” The Red Dragon shook his head and flicked his tail proudly, voice travelling a hundred kilometres.

“So it is Sir Zhu Lie. En, this Wen wonders what Sir is doing here at my Azure Sun Temple?”

“I’m looking for someone!” Zhu Lie’s body writhed and he moved his dragon head over the crowd, scanning the group with his dragon eyes, “Who here is Yang Kai?”

Yang Kai was still watching a good show when he suddenly heard the guy called Zhu lie call out his name, so he couldn’t help but be stunned.

Over a hundred pairs of eyes turned to him in unison, with all the Emperor Realm Masters standing nearby Yang Kai quickly backing away, as if standing near him would give them bad luck.

Wen Zi Shan was also stunned.

For a Great Dragon to come out here to Azure Sun Temple, he thought it was the resurgence of the Demon Spirits that attracted him. Even though the Dragon Clan boasted about being the leader of the myriad spirits and thought too highly of themselves, they were indeed a powerful race with countless millennia of inheritance. If anyone in this world were to know best about the Demon Race and the Demon Spirits, then it had to be the Dragon Clan.

But who knew that this guy was actually here for Yang Kai and not the Demon Spirits.

He looked at Yang Kai curiously and discovered that Yang Kai also had a bewildered expression on his face.

“You’re Yang Kai?” Without needing anyone to identify him, just the gaze and attitude of the Emperor Realm Masters around him was enough for Zhu Lie to recognize the target of his trip. He then ordered without room for negotiation, “Come with me.”

“Where to?” Yang Kai frowned. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“To Dragon Island!” Zhu Lie answered impatiently.

Everyone sucked in a breath. Even if they were all Emperors, they still couldn’t remain calm when they heard this sentence. It was definitely an honour for one to be able to step foot on Dragon Island in one’s lifetime. But looking at Zhu Lie’s attitude, they were all worried that it could only be disastrous if Yang Kai really went.

None of them knew how Yang Kai had offended Dragon Island and the Dragon Clan.

But Yang Kai seemed to have understood something, frowning as he asked, “Did Zhu Qing ask you to come?”

“She is not qualified to give me orders!” Zhu Lie coldly snorted, a flash of disdain emerging in his eyes.

“Then who was it that gave you the order?” Yang Kai asked.

Zhu Lie snapped his tail impatiently, shaking the clouds within a hundred kilometres as he gave a booming response, “You do not need to know that. You just have to follow me back to Dragon Island.”

Yang Kai smiled and said, “I do wish to visit Dragon Island, but not right now. There are still some things I must deal with here. So, this Brother Zhu Lie, may I please trouble you to go back and tell the one above you that I will pay them a visit when I’m free? No need to send anyone out to invite me.”

Yang Kai had suddenly become wary about Dragon Island and the Dragon Clan.

Previously, Zhu Qing had also invited him to Dragon Island many times. In the beginning, Yang Kai thought it was just because of the Dragon Island Token he possessed, as well as the few dragon artifacts that he refined, but now, it seems like things weren’t that simple.

Zhu Qing had not returned since leaving for the Northern Territory’s Frozen Earth, and he heard no news of her either. Then, Dragon Island’s side even sent out another Dragon Clan member to take him to Dragon Island.

Yang Kai figured that it might have something to do with the Golden Divine Dragon’s Source he carried. It seemed he had underestimated its attraction to the Dragon Clan. So, before he was able to figure things out, there was no way he was going to step foot on Dragon Island. Otherwise, he may not even know what he would be facing. What’s more, the Demon Spirits had only just escaped from their seal, and as a participant in this matter, he could not leave here.

Zhu Lie’s dragon eyes rounded and he looked at Yang Kai in astonishment for a while before quickly asking, “Human, did you just reject me?”

His anger that had subsided showed signs of surging up again, and both Lei Hong and Wen Zi Shan’s faces changed slightly.

Before Yang Kai could answer, Zhu Lie had already flown into a rage, “How dare you! This Dragon came here personally and you dare refuse me? You court death!”

He tumbled in mid-air, and an indescribably killing intent suddenly filled a hundred-kilometre radius.

Yang Kai’s face turned serious as he responded, “I believe I made myself very clear. You can either return to Dragon Island and convey my words, or I will beat you back there.”

When the many Emperor Realm Masters heard this, they all turned pale in shock as they stared at Yang Kai. They felt that the audacity of this guy was simply ridiculous. To think a trivial First-Order Emperor Realm cultivator would dare speak to a Dragon in such a way.

Wen Zi Shan, Gao Xue Ting, and the others also reacted as if they were meeting Yang Kai for the first time, all of them dumbfounded.

No one had ever dared to talk to a Dragon like that as anyone who did was dead by now.

Lei Hong was also constantly trying to signal to Yang Kai with his eyes, telling him to ease up a little; after all, it wasn’t easy for him to calm Zhu Lie’s anger earlier. Yang Kai’s words were definitely going to stir him up again.

Even he, as the Great Elder of Star Soul Palace, was able to make allowances here. Yang Kai was merely a High-Rank Guest Elder of Azure Sun Temple, so whether it be cultivation or position, he was far inferior to him, so what would it matter if he softened his words a little?

But it was already too late.

Zhu Lie’s anger was rekindled and became several times more vigorous than before. A Heaven-shattering laugh broke out from his mouth as he shouted, “Puny ant, how dare you provoke a member of the Dragon Clan! You really do not know the immensity of Heaven and…”

But he did not finish his sentence because Yang Kai’s figure had already teleported in front of him.

His tiny figure looked insignificant compared to the Dragon’s two hundred-metre-long body.
