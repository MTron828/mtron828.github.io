One day later, Profound Yang Mountain came into their sight from a distance.

Zhou Ya breathed a sigh of relief as she patted Yun Fei Bai’s back and gently said, “Hang in there, Second Brother. We’ll reach home soon.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Yun Fei Bai nodded his head, his face still as pale as a white sheet.

He had been trying to stop his wound from worsening while returning to the Sect; however, Golden Crow’s True Fire was indeed incredible. The dark flame that was burning in his chest made him feel unbearable pain.

All of a sudden, Geng Qing looked forward and sported a doubtful expression, “Who is that?”

There was a figure standing like a dead tree on a mountain peak in front of them as he gazed silently at them. As their eyes met, the figure curled his lips into a scornful smile and pointed his spear towards them before yelling, “You’re too slow. Do you know how long I’ve been waiting here?”

The colour drained from Zhou Ya’s face, “It’s him!”

Geng Qing was stunned, “Why is he here? How dare he get in front of us?”

They had been moving at full speed, and even though Yang Kai was a Master of the Dao of Space, he shouldn’t have been ahead of them. Moreover, they had ordered several dozen subordinates to stop him. Had he broken through the defence of several dozen people on his own?

Furthermore, this place was very near Profound Yang Mountain. Once they got into a fight here, the Head Mountain Lord would be able to lend them a hand within moments. When the Four Great Mountain Lords joined forces, no one in the Shadowless Cave Heaven was a match for them.

Therefore, how could Yang Kai have the guts to intercept them here?

While Geng Qing was still lost in his thoughts, he saw Yang Kai coming at them with his spear as the latter bellowed, “Yun Fei Bai, suffer death!”

They were unable to describe how amazing the attack was, as it ignored the obstacles of space and seemed to shatter the world around it. Although it was an attack that was aimed at Yun Fei Bai, Zhou Ya and Geng Qing felt as though they had been targeted as well.

The three Mountain Lords were dumbstruck. Zhou Ya immediately wielded her sword while Geng Qing used his most powerful Divine Abilities. Ignoring his own injury, Yun Fei Bai roared and summoned a scroll, on which the characters started moving and turned into beams of Sword Qi before they shot out.

*Hong hong hong…*

Explosive sounds were heard as halos of light filled the sky. The three Mountain Lords were forced backward as their eyes trembled.

“How is that possible?” Zhou Ya exclaimed.

Although the three of them had joined forces, they were almost unable to parry the young man’s strike. All of them were in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, so how was it possible that this young man was so much stronger than them? When the young man suddenly awakened and lashed out outside of Twin Spirit Island some time ago, she didn’t directly confront him as she simply launched a long range attack before dragging Yun Fei Bai away, so she hadn’t been able to properly gauge his strength.

It wasn’t until they traded moves now that she realised how horrifying Yang Kai was. His World Force was clearly far denser and more vigorous than hers.

After the attack, Yang Kai didn’t stop as he unleashed his Supreme Limitless Spear Art to the extreme. Like a waterfall, the spear shadows rained down and engulfed the three Mountain Lords, each shadow containing a terrifying World Force within it.

Certainly, Yun Fei Bai and the others wouldn’t dare to be negligent as they were extremely on edge already. Although they had tried their best, they still found it difficult to parry the bombardment of attacks. Every strike was as violent as lightning, and the rich Dragon Pressure that filled the air around them was disrupting their focus.

Previously, the Azure Dragon Spear was just a sharp weapon in Yang Kai’s hands; however, since his ascension to the Open Heaven Realm, he was able to bring out its true power.

During his breakthrough, Yang Kai merged his Small Sealed World with his Small Universe. His Small Sealed World had a rich heritage to begin with, and he had further enhanced it with remnants of the Blood Monster Cave Heaven. As such, he managed to greatly enhance the background of his Small Universe, allowing him to fight against seasoned Open Heaven Realm Masters from the outset.

However, without the Azure Dragon Spear, he couldn’t possibly battle against three powerful Masters on his own; after all, their thousands of years of accumulation were not just for show.

The reason the Proprietress was able to achieve that was that she had made use of the Blood Monster Battle Dress.

In a battle between Open Heaven Realm Masters, the heritages of their Small Universes mattered the most.

The barrage of attacks dazzled Yang Kai’s opponents. Zhou Ya and Geng Qing were in a better state as they were still relatively un-injured. On the other hand, Yun Fei Bai was in a horrible state. He had been burned by Golden Crow’s True Fire to begin with, which caused his strength to plunge significantly, and presently, half of Yang Kai’s attacks were targeted at him. If Geng Qing and Zhou Ya hadn’t gone all out to protect him, he would’ve been killed by Yang Kai already.

Despite that, he was still in a perilous situation. The young man kept targeting him, as though he was determined to end his life, which caused him to groan in pain.

After barely more than ten breaths of intense battle, the mountains around them had been completely destroyed. The air was filled with dust and debris and the World itself seemed to have turned pale.

The black Golden Crow’s True Fire burning on the tip of Azure Dragon Spear made the three Mountain Lords extremely wary. After what had happened to Yun Fei Bai, Geng Qing and Zhou Ya wouldn’t dare to come into contact with Golden Crow’s True Fire, so their movements were rather restricted.

The space around them seemed to have become viscous as well. It was apparent that the young man had used a Space Secret Technique while attacking them.

“Who dares fight outside Profound Yang Mountain?!” A stern voice was suddenly heard coming from Profound Yang Mountain, then a gigantic figure that seemed able to cover the entire sky rose from the central peak. With a pair of grim-looking eyes, he stared at the people in battle.

Yun Fei Bai, who was warding off Yang Kai’s attacks with difficulty, yelled pitifully, “Big Brother, save me!”

The giant eyes narrowed, and when the person realised what was going on, his expression turned furious as he bellowed, “How impudent, boy!”

After he finished speaking, the figure shrunk before a ray of light shot out of Profound Yang Mountain. It was apparent that the Head Mountain Lord, Mao Zhe, was trying to come to their rescue upon realising what was happening.

Geng Qing and Zhou Ya were elated. The three of them were unable to fend off Yang Kai’s attacks; however, things would be different if Mao Zhe joined them; after all, they were fully aware of how powerful their Big Brother was.

With the spear in his hand, Yang Kai took a glance in the direction of Profound Yang Mountain and snorted, then he swept his weapon across the air to force back Geng Qing and the others. Following that, his figure flickered and he appeared right in front of Yun Fei Bai, who was still spitting blood.

A flustered Yun Fei Bai immediately tried to retreat.

Yang Kai stared coldly at him and silently used Near Distant Horizon. At that instant, the space around them extended infinitely. Even time seemed to have stopped flowing as people’s thoughts became jumbled.

Yun Fei Bai was horrified to learn that he was unable to widen the gap with Yang Kai regardless of how hard he tried. He could only watch as Yang Kai came at him with his spear.

Faced with this spear thrust, he felt the aura of death engulfing him. He roared as the scroll in his grip shone brightly and all the Sword Qi it could unleash condensed together and clashed with the Azure Dragon Spear.

Since Geng Qing and Zhou Ya were assisting their Second Brother from the side, they were also affected by the disturbance of Near Distant Horizon and Time Principles. Although they were able to break through it after just a moment, what came into their sight was the life and death clash between Yang Kai and Yun Fei Bai.

“Boy! You dare?!” The Head Mountain Lord was heard roaring from a distance.

An unfazed Yang Kai infused more power into his Azure Dragon Spear and a deafening Dragon Roar reverberated across the sky, causing the condensed Sword Qi to shatter.

Following a whoosh, the sound of flesh being pierced rang out.

Geng Qing and Zhou Ya became rooted to the spots as they looked dazedly forward. Head Mountain Lord Mao Zhe landed in front of them with a livid expression.

Just 3,000 metres in front of them, Yang Kai was holding a spear with one hand as he remained in an aggressive posture. In front of him, Yun Fei Bai widened his eyes with fury as he froze in place. He was unable to move because the spear had pierced through his forehead and stuck out from the back of his head.

The robust defence of a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master became as thin as paper when confronted with the Azure Dragon Spear.

The black Golden Crow’s True Fire was still burning on the tip of the spear and like a million snakes, expanded from Yun Fei Bai’s forehead to the rest of his body.

Time seemed to have stopped flowing at that moment.

Yun Fei Bai’s eyes darted around erratically. Although he was lethally injured, he didn’t immediately lose his life, which went to show how potent the vitality of a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was. However, his face kept twitching due to the excruciating pain.

In front of him, Yang Kai’s clothes were all ragged. There were countless wounds on his body that criss-crossed one another. Every wound was left with very pure Sword Qi, and the largest wound showed that he was almost cut in two through his chest.

His entire figure was dyed gold due to his golden blood.

The final desperate attack of a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was no joke. If it weren’t because Yang Kai had a sturdy defence as a Half-Dragon, he would’ve been cut into countless pieces.

As Mao Zhe watched the sight silently, he narrowed his eyes and said, “Junior Brother, if you have any demands, just name them. This Monarch won’t turn you down as long as he can fulfill it.”

He called Yang Kai ‘boy before he arrived at this place, but upon seeing that Yun Fei Bai’s life was in his hands, he politely called him ‘Junior Brother’.

Yang Kai turned his head and flashed a smile at him, “Can I really make any demand?”

Mao Zhe replied dispassionately, “As long as it doesn’t cross the line, anything is acceptable.”

“What if I want you to trade his life for yours? Can you do that?”

A hint of fury flashed across Mao Zhe’s eyes, “You’re funny, Junior Brother. Please think it through. The person you’re trying to kill is the Second Mountain Lord of Profound Yang Mountain. If you kill him, you will be our enemy, and all of us will never let you off. However, if you release him, you’ll be our most honoured guest.”

“Are you trying to threaten me?” Yang Kai arched his brow.

Mao Zhe impassively replied, “I’m just speaking the truth.”

“Why do you keep spouting nonsense? My only goal here is to kill!” Yang Kai suddenly roared and gripped his spear, surging his World Force into it. Yun Fei Bai widened his eyes, and before he could react, his head exploded.

The headless corpse convulsed as blood spurted out from his neck before collapsing to the ground.

Geng Qing and Zhou Ya were stunned.

Their Second Brother was killed right in front of them! Although Mao Zhe had come to their aid, Yun Fei Bai’s head was still exploded and he died a horrible death. It had been thousands of years since they met, and it never crossed their minds that they would part ways for good on this day. At that instant, they still couldn’t believe what had just happened.

This place was just several hundred kilometres away from Profound Yang Mountain. They were practically home.

All of a sudden, they started to suspect that Yang Kai had deliberately decided to intercept them here; otherwise, he could’ve chosen another, more convenient location.

The only reason he would do this though was to lure the Head Mountain Lord out of Profound Yang Mountain!

As they turned their heads, they saw Mao Zhe sporting a livid expression. His narrowed eyes gleamed with a dangerous glow as he ordered coldly, “Kill!”
