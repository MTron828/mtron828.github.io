Upon finishing his words, Yang Kai fished out a Sixth-Order Blue Crystal.

The shop hand, who was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, took the crystal and examined it, then appeared elated, “It’s enough.”

Yang Kai nodded and beckoned to the little girl before bringing her out of the restaurant. The shop hand said hospitably, “Please come again.”

[I’ll be a fool if I come again!] Yang Kai thought. The things in this Marketplace were ordinary but extremely costly. Sixth-Order Yin and Yang Element materials were worth approximately 40 million Open Heaven Pills, but he squandered them away in barely half a day.

He reckoned that this place should be renamed as ‘Black Market’.

The little girl still followed him closely. Yang Kai turned around to gaze at her and look around. Suddenly thinking of something, he took out the hairpin from his Space Ring and fixed it on her hair.

She was already truly adorable, and even though the hairpin wasn’t an artifact, it was finely made. They perfectly matched each other.

The little girl was evidently startled.

Yang Kai said with a smile, “It’s a gift.”

He then turned around and waved his hand, “I’ll go back now. You should head home early so that your parents won’t have to worry about you.”

This time, the little girl didn’t tail him. While standing in the same spot, she just touched the hairpin and watched him leave.

Yang Kai headed straight to his resting place. When he recalled his experiences in the Marketplace, he couldn’t help but grin wryly. After emptying his mind, he sat down with his legs crossed and started cultivating.

One day later, he suddenly heard a clear voice calling out to him from outside the courtyard, “Yang Kai! Yang Kai!”

Yang Kai frowned and stored the materials he hadn’t fully refined. After opening the courtyard’s door, he saw the little girl that he came across the day before in the Marketplace. She was standing outside his courtyard with a smile. The hairpin that he gave her the day before was still in her hair.

A puzzled Yang Kai asked, “How did you find me?”

There was a smug smile on the little girl’s face, “I asked around. It wasn’t hard to find out where you live.”

It was apparent that she had also found out his name by asking around. Yang Kai couldn’t help but think that this little girl was truly clever.

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai asked curiously as he had no idea why she had come all the way here to see him.

“Let’s go to the steamed stuffed bun shop!” The little girl said firmly.

Yang Kai rubbed his forehead, “You want me to foot the bill, right?”

“Hehe…” The little girl appeared bashful as her intentions were seen through. However, she soon cast the bashfulness away as the foodie in her got the better of her. She grabbed his hand and pulled him away, “Let’s go. You have nothing to do anyway.”

A speechless Yang Kai refuted, “What do you mean I have nothing to do? I was cultivating when you disturbed me.”

“There’s no hurry to cultivate. I’m hungry.”

Despite her petite figure, she was full of strength; Yang Kai also wouldn’t really dare to resist her so he was gradually pulled towards the Marketplace.

When they arrived at Lin’s Steamed Bun Restaurant, she ordered 10 baskets of steamed stuffed buns, just like she had done the day before. While the little girl wolfed down the food, Yang Kai waited patiently by the side.

The same thing happened every day for the next few days.

Yang Kai felt helpless as he wondered who were the ones who had given birth to such a reckless little girl. He wanted to tell her parents what was going on, but to his dismay, when he asked the little girl to bring him to see her parents, she started sobbing and said that they passed away a long time ago.

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai didn’t dare to keep asking lest her sorrowful memories were stirred up. If the little girl really started bawling her eyes out, he wouldn’t know how to appease her.

This little girl was seven or eight years old, and she was only in the Origin King Realm. She must have been born in Yin-Yang Pass, but her parents passed away a long time ago. How was she going to survive in this place?

Yang Kai consoled himself by thinking that he would just keep her company for the time being as she was truly pitiful.

For the next few days, the little girl would bring Yang Kai to the steamed stuffed bun shop in the Marketplace so that he would pay for her meal. They got along pretty well.

One day, Yang Kai was seated in Lin’s Steamed Bun Restaurant while the little girl scarfed down the food, the same as the past few days. It wouldn’t take the little girl a long time to finish having 10 baskets of steamed stuffed buns. After that, Yang Kai would fish out a Sixth-Order Yellow or Blue Crystal to pay for the meal.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s expression changed as he turned to look out of the restaurant, where he saw four people shuffling inside.

His eyes brightened as he rose from the chair and greeted them, “Senior Tang!”

The person at the front was none other than Tang Qiu whom Yang Kai had been waiting for. It was apparent that he had just returned from outside and hadn’t even had time to clean himself up. It seemed that he had fought against some formidable enemies, so his aura was a little unstable.

Behind him was Xu Ling Gong, who was followed by Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue. Just like Yang Kai had speculated, the four of them had headed out together, which was why he couldn’t contact any one of them.

Yang Kai then greeted Xu Ling Gong and his two Disciples, who all nodded in response.

Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue were still in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, but their auras had become far deeper. It was obvious that they had grown in strength after fighting against the Black Ink Clan since their arrival in Yin-Yang Pass.

“I came to this place because I was told that you’re here,” Tang Qiu explained.

Yang Kai replied, “I decided to take a stroll since I had nothing to do. Senior, since you’re back, you could have just told someone to summon me. Why did you come all the way here?”

Tang Qiu waved his hand, “I’m sorry for making you wait. I was held up because I came across an accident when I was on my way back.”

“It’s fine. Have a seat, please.” Yang Kai extended his hand.

Tang Qiu nodded, then sat together with Xu Ling Gong.

As soon as they sat down though, they shot out of their chairs as if there were some sharp stick that poked their butts. They stared dazedly at the petite figure behind the baskets of steamed stuffed buns.

Since the little girl was seated behind the baskets that had been piled up, Tang Qiu and Xu Ling Gong hadn’t noticed her presence before.

“S-She…” Tang Qiu stammered.

Yang Kai explained, “I came across this little girl a few days ago. She’s quite pitiful as her parents passed away a long time ago, and there’s no one to take care of her. Since she loves the steamed stuffed buns here, I bring her to this place every day.”

“Ah… er… en! I see!” Tang Qiu came to his senses and sent a signal to Xu Ling Gong with his eyes. Then, he slowly took a seat.

Qing Kui, who was standing behind Xu Ling Gong, coughed, “Honoured Master, I’m going to take a little stroll.”

An absent-minded Xu Ling Gong replied, “En, go ahead.”

“I’ll tag along!” Su Ying Xue quickly said.

After offering an apology, they left the restaurant together.

In the steamed stuffed bun shop, four figures, three adults and one little girl, were seated at the table. Yang Kai looked at Tang Qiu and Xu Ling Gong with a frown, “It seems that both of you are badly injured.”

Yang Kai could feel that there was something wrong with both Tang Qiu and Xu Ling Gong. Their solemn expressions suggested that they were trying to suppress something, as though they were anxious or in pain somehow.

“We’re fine,” Tang Qiu replied casually.

“Yes, we’re fine.” Xu Ling Gong nodded repeatedly.

“That’s good.” Yang Kai nodded, then brought up a serious topic, “What’s going on with the Black Ink Clan?”

“Black Ink Clan?” Tang Qiu appeared perplexed, as though he didn’t hear Yang Kai clearly. Nevertheless, he soon regained his senses, “Oh, the Black Ink Clan… I was about to discuss it with you.”

Yang Kai frowned as he had a feeling that something really was wrong with Tang Qiu. The latter appeared to be completely distracted. He was the one who told Yang Kai to come over to find out who made the Warships for the Black Ink Clan, but he appeared puzzled at this moment when the topic was brought up.

The little girl, who had been eating her steamed stuffed buns in silence, suddenly gazed at Tang Qiu and asked with a smile, “Would you like some buns?”

Tang Qiu was unable to respond immediately as he appeared to have been caught off guard.

Yang Kai directly knocked on the little girl’s head and chastised her by saying, “Don’t interrupt us. We’re having a discussion here!”

“Impudence!” Tang Qiu landed a slap on the table that caused it to collapse. The baskets and the freshly made steamed stuffed buns all fell to the ground.

Yang Kai was stunned.

Tang Qiu was dumbfounded as well.

On the other hand, Xu Ling Gong hung his head low and remained unmoving.

The little girl grabbed a steamed stuffed bun in each hand. Her cheeks were bulging as she soon gulped down the food.

“Senior, you…” Yang Kai scowled at Tang Qiu.

Tang Qiu hesitated for a bit before saying in a muffled voice, “The impudence of the Black Ink Clan!”

Yang Kai broke into laughter, “What happened to you on the way back?”

The shop hand hurriedly came over. While cleaning the things up, he said, “Please calm down, everyone. Do not fight here.”

The little girl glared at Tang Qiu, “Give my steamed stuffed buns back!”

“Right away!” Tang Qiu nodded repeatedly, then said to the shop hand, “Give us more steamed stuffed buns!”

“Alright, please give me a moment,” the shop hand replied.

Since the table was broken, they had to move to another one. Fortunately, there were not a lot of customers in the restaurant right now. Apart from them, there were only a few other diners; hence, there were still some vacant seats.

New steamed stuffed buns were soon served. Yang Kai was waiting for Tang Qiu to talk about what was going on with the Black Ink Clan, but the latter actually started stuffing the buns into his face, even ordering Xu Ling Gong to do the same.

Therefore, apart from Yang Kai, who sported a half-dumbstruck expression, the little girl, Tang Qiu, and Xu Ling Gong were gulping down the food together. While they were enjoying the food, Tang Qiu and Xu Ling Gong kept saying that the steamed stuffed buns were delicious.

Yang Kai was dumbfounded at the scene before him. Those who had no idea what was going on might think that they had been starving for a long time.

The little girl’s appetite seemed to be enhanced as the two men fought over the food. Soon, more and more baskets were piled up. The speed at which the owners made the steamed stuffed buns could no longer keep pace with them as they would finish having the food too quickly.

Unable to take it anymore, Yang Kai said tactfully, “Senior, about the Black Ink Clan…”

“I’ll tell you about the Black Ink Clan at a later time,” Tang Qiu replied in a muffled voice.

Yang Kai looked away as he could no longer bear to keep watching them.

In just half a day, they finished having 100 baskets of steamed stuffed buns and the owners of Lin’s Steamed Bun Restaurant had to close the shop early.

The little girl leaned against the chair and stroked her belly. With a pleased expression, she belched and said, “I’m full!”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but smile, “You’re finally full for once.”

“En, I’m stuffed. I need to head home and get some sleep,” The little girl rose from the chair and skipped out of the shop. It was apparent that she was in a joyful mood.

After she was gone, Tang Qiu got up as well, “I’ll head back now. Yang Kai, look for me tomorrow.”

“Yes,” Yang Kai replied.

Xu Ling Gong patted Yang Kai’s shoulder and gazed at him. After hesitating for a bit, he warned, “Be careful!”

Yang Kai was perplexed upon hearing that, but before he could ask any questions, Xu Ling Gong had left with his hands folded behind his back.
