Chapter 891, Shimmering Moon Grass

World Spirit Treasures were extremely rare and difficult to come across. Many cultivators would live their entire lives never seeing one.

Because these strange treasures already possessed a certain amount of sentience, they were closer to living creatures than mere plants or objects, which allowed them to understand how to avoid danger by running or hiding.

As he observed the crowd’s reaction, Xu Hui chuckled and said, “You can rest assured that my Holy Land will not force any of you to hand over your valuable treasures for free. The Holy Master has said that no matter what grade of World Spirit Treasure it is, as long as anyone is willing to part with it, the Holy Land’s Alchemy Grandmaster will refine three pills for them for free. Additionally, for those who choose to sell their World Spirit Treasures, they will be allowed to skip the line and have their pills refined immediately, and the Holy Land will also guarantee a successful refinement.”

Following this announcement, the crowd fell silent for a moment before a great uproar began.

In exchange of Alchemy services, the reward demanded by the Grandmaster of Nine Heavens Holy Land, while not excessive, was also not cheap. One had to prepare enough Crystal Stones or herbs to match the value of the materials used to refine the pill they requested.

This kind of price was something that could be afforded by most people.

Although Saint Grade materials were difficult to find, most masters who need them in the first place were not lacking Crystal Stones.

However, three pills worth of reward was indeed a great sum of money and more than enough to attract the attention of the crowd.

Someone in the line soon called out, “Great Elder, are there any limits on the grades of those three free refinements?”

Xu Hui smiled and shook his head, “There are no limits, it is even possible to request for three Saint Grade Mid-Rank pills!”

“Your noble Sect’s Grandmaster is indeed bold!” The man exclaimed, everyone else around him sharing his shock.

Although until now no one had actually asked to refine a Saint Grade Mid-Rank pill, it could be inferred from how Xu Hui was speaking that the Holy Land’s Alchemy Grandmaster had full confidence in refining this level of pill.

“So, if you possess any World Spirit Treasures, please don’t conceal them; after all, this is a rare opportunity!” Xu Hui grinned and persuaded.

He didn’t know if there was anyone among this group that had a World Spirit Treasure, or even why Yang Kai wanted with such objects, but none of that really mattered. Since it was an order from the Holy Master, all Xu Hui had to do was carry it out.

At the end of the line, among a group of newly arrived customers, after hesitating for a moment, someone finally called out, “Great Elder, is there no limit on what kind of World Spirit Treasure it is?”

“Yes,” Xu Hui nodded , turning his attention to the man who just spoke.

The man wore a half awkward half-serious look and asked, “What if I only need to refine a single pill?”

“The two remaining opportunities will be recorded by my Holy Land so that whenever you wish to use them, you only need to come here in order to redeem them.”

“In that case...” The man’s expression became slightly anxious as he carefully took out a jade box from his Universe Bag and handed it over to Xu Hui, “Will this do, Great Elder?”

As he asked, a nervous and excited look filled his face.

This man was no more than thirty years old and his strength was quite low, only reaching the Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary. With such a cultivation, the pill this man came here to request was definitely Spirit Grade Top-Rank.

Such a cultivator would normally not even be able to speak with a famous figure like Xu Hui, so it was only natural he would be somewhat excited.

Xu Hui raised his brow and accepted the jade box.

The man quickly said, “Great Elder must be careful, this thing runs quite fast. If you relax your guard it will definitely try to slip away. This humble one only managed to obtain it by chance a number of years ago, and to my embarrassment, I still do not even know what it is.”

“It’s fine!” Xu Hui smiled confidently, his powerful Divine Sense wrapping up the jade box, leaving no gap for whatever was contained within to escape through.

Many people stretched their necks to see exactly what this World Spirit Treasure was.

Even Luo Sheng and Meng Tian Fei both couldn’t help leaning in slightly.

The moment the jade box was opened, a faint yet soothing glow, similar to the gentle rays of the moon, blossomed.

As if detecting that the box had been opened, whatever was inside darted out, leaving behind a streak of pale white light.

Xu Hui chuckled lightly as he saw this.

With Xu Hui’s Divine Sense surrounding it, the light was only able to flit about inside a small range, appearing as though it was quite anxious.

After a while, the gentle light gradually condensed and a three-leafed spirit grass appeared.

This spirit grass exuded a weak energy fluctuation as well as a faint vitality. Its body seemed to be comprised of a kind of white jade, giving it a delicate, almost crystal-like appearance.

The three leaves looked supple and fresh, as if they had only recently been moistened by the morning dew.

“It really is a World Spirit Treasure!” Xu Hui’s eyes lit up as he gently nodded.

Xu Hui could tell at a glance that this spirit grass was indeed a World Spirit Treasure because it already possessed a faint consciousness.

“Does anyone know what World Spirit Treasure this is?” Xu Hui asked the crowd.

Most people shook their heads but one man let out a chuckle and replied, “Great Elder, this is a stalk of Shimmering Moon Grass. By absorbing the essence of the moon over many years it managed to give birth to a consciousness. Although it is classified as a World Spirit Treasure, it is apparently not mature. With only three leaves, I’m afraid it has no practical use. If it was allowed to grow for another hundred years or so, to the point where it had five leaves, its value would increase many folds.”

“Oh? This friend appears to be quite familiar with this,” Xu Hui turned a smile towards the man who spoke.

“Not at all! This humble one was quite interested in spirit grasses and spirit medicines and thirty years ago even aimed to become an Alchemist. Unfortunately, my aptitude was lacking and I was unable to step onto that path, instead choosing to pursue the Martial Dao.”

“I see!” Xu Hui nodded. An Alchemist’s understanding of spirit grasses spirit medicines was indeed deeper than most, so although this man failed to become an Alchemist in the end, his knowledge of herbs would not be comparable to that of ordinary people.

“Then... is this acceptable?” The owner of the Shimmering Moon Grass scratched his head nervously.

With someone coming out and declaring that this Shimmering Moon Grass did not have much practical value, he couldn’t help growing more anxious.

The promised reward was actually refining three pills! Could this Shimmering Moon Grass possibly be worth that much?

“Yes!” To his surprise though, Xu Hui smiled and nodded, “This old master said that no matter what grade or value it has, as long as it is a genuine World Spirit Treasure, we will exchange for it! Good, this old master will accept this Shimmering Moon Grass. Little brother, please come with me so the Grandmaster can help fulfil your Alchemy request!”

“Yes!” The man shouted, overjoyed.

He had only arrived here today. If he was forced to wait, it would be at least six or seven days before his turn arrived and he would have to pay an amount of Crystal Stones equal to the worth of the pill he wanted to refine upon receiving it.

Yet now, for a trivial Shimmering Moon Grass that he had absolutely no use for, he not only got to skip the queue, the Grandmaster would also refine three pills of any grade for him for free!

This meant that as long as he found the appropriate materials in the future, all he had to do was come to Nine Heavens Holy Land and he would be able to instantly acquire two Saint Pills.

If his luck was particularly good, the pills he requested might even be formed with Pill Veins. Taking such pills could even have a life-altering effect on his future.

Fantasizing about such things, this young man couldn’t help feeling that glorious tomorrow had opened up before him.

“Wait!” Suddenly, someone from the lineup of customers called out.

Xu Hui frowned as he turned his eyes towards the speaker, discovering that the other party was actually a Saint Realm master and unavoidably asking, “What advice does this friend have?”

“This one wouldn’t dare!” The Saint Realm master laughed, “I’d simply like Great Elder to wait a moment while I have a word with this little brother.”

Xu Hui looked at him for a moment before nodding lightly, “Please make it quick, the Holy Master is still waiting for this old master to report.”

“Many thanks, Great Elder!” The man quickly thanked him before walking over to the Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary cultivator and speaking to him.

This Saint Realm master deliberately lowered his voice, causing everyone else around him to become suspicious, wondering just what was being discussed.

The owner of the Shimmering Moon Grass was quite nervous being called out to by such a powerhouse at first, but after hearing what this Saint Realm master said, he immediately became excited and began nodding repeatedly.

Seeing this, many among the spectating crowd quickly guessed what the two men were talking about.

A moment later, the Saint Realm master and the owner of the Shimmering Moon Grass finished speaking, seemingly having reached an agreement both of them were happy with.

Before Xu Hui could even ask the young man to follow him into Nine Heavens Holy Land, several other Saints rushed out and began speaking to him.

The scene immediately became noisy.

The owner of the Shimmering Moon Grass was now facing a dilemma. None of these Saints was a character he could afford to offend so, in a bout of desperation, he simply shouted, “Several Seniors, please make a bid, the spots will go to the highest offers!”

Hearing this, the few Saints gathered around immediately began making offers, none of them willing to let the others snatch up such a good opportunity.

Xu Hui didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, suddenly understanding what the owner of the Shimmering Moon Grass was doing.

The Holy Land had promised to help him refine three pills of any grade for free.

Inspired by the first Saint who spoke to him, the young man decided to simply sell all three of these opportunities.

Three opportunities meant three different rewards, far more benefits than he could acquire by simply asking for his own pill to be refined.

Slowly shaking his head, Xu Hui did not intervene. The Holy Land had given him this opportunity, so how he used it was up to him.

A moment later, the Shimmering Moon Grass’s owner ran over and said with a big smile, “I apologise for making Great Elder wait so long, let’s go in.”

Xu Hui smiled back at him, “Were the benefits they offered you to your satisfaction?”

The man nodded vigorously, “Very much so! But... is this also alright?”

“Of course there’s no problem. The Holy Land only gave you these three chances. How you choose to use them is your own business.”

“Great! I’m so glad!” So many great benefits falling from the sky into his lap had made this young man somewhat dizzy.

These Saint Realm masters were reluctant to wait in line outside with everyone else, and the benefits they offered to the young man were not worth more than the Saint Pill they wanted to refine.

This was the same as giving the owner of the Shimmering Moon Grass the reward they had prepared for the Holy Land in exchange for that low level World Spirit Treasure.

For the Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary cultivator, this was simply the biggest opportunity of his life.

After leading this young man to the reception room and collecting the three sets of materials he had brought with him, Xu Hui immediately flew over to the Holy Master Court.

Inside one of the palace rooms filled with a rich pill fragrance, Yang Kai was sitting in meditation in front of a small pill furnace.

Xu Hui entered and explained the story.

Yang Kai gently nodded, accepting the herbs as well as the Shimmering Moon Grass before saying, “I’ll call for you when the refining is complete.”

“Yes!”

After Xu Hui left, Yang Kai put the Shimmering Moon Grass into the Black Book space before sinking his own consciousness inside it too.

A wisp of moonlight appeared inside the Black Book space and began acting somewhat panic-stricken, trying to find a safe haven to take refuge.

The Divine Tree looked at this newcomer curiously, its Divine Sense locked onto it as it observed carefully.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
