“Isn’t it President Hua?” Just as Hua You Meng was lost in her own thoughts, a voice suddenly called out from the side. After hearing this voice though, Hua You Meng could not help frowning as she turned her head toward its source. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Not far away, a man who seemed to be about thirty years old walked straight toward the pair, a lewd smile on his face as his two eyes constantly swept over the sensitive parts of Hua You Meng’s body.

This man was dressed in luxurious clothes and had overall good looks, but his narrow eyes gave him an insidious air. When he stared at her like this, Hua You Meng suddenly felt uncomfortable.

Behind this man, there are two Origin Returning Realm cultivators with cold expressions on their faces, obviously guards.

“Jiang Chao!” Hua You Meng’s beautiful eyes could not help flashing with a light of disgust and fear, but soon, she thought that she was not alone now and was being accompanied by Yang Kai, so she quickly restored her indifference.

“Haha, meeting President Hua here by chance. This must be fate,” Jiang Chao didn’t seem to notice Hua You Meng’s revulsion and spoke to her with great enthusiasm.

“President Jiang surely jests. You and I are both Presidents of our respective chambers of commerce. As the saying goes, your closest peers are also your rivals, there is certainly no fate between you and me,” Hua You Meng said coldly.

“Rivals?” Jiang Chao didn’t pay her insults any mind and simply grinned widely, “I prefer the saying that one is most intimate with their rivals. If that’s the case, this Young Lord would very much like to be President Hua’s rival.”

Hearing this blatant innuendo in his words, Hua You Meng could not help her pretty face from sinking as she snapped, “President Jiang, please show some propriety!”

“Haha, why need does this Young Lord have to show propriety in front of you? We will soon become one family after all.” Jiang Chao laughed, “By the way, have you considered the proposal I made to you six months ago? This Young Lord’s patience is running a bit thin. President Hua suddenly left Purple Star City half a year ago, making it impossible for this Young Lord to find you, but now that we’ve encountered one another again, I hope you can give this Young Lord an answer.”

Hua You Meng’s expression was extremely ugly as she ground her teeth and glared at him.

Jiang Chao saw this but simply sneered, “President Hua, you should know well that your little chamber of commerce is incapable of accomplishing anything significant on its own, yes? Since that is the case, it would be best to merge it with this Young Lord’s Saint Yuan Chamber of Commerce. Under this Young Lord’s leadership, what worry will you have about being able to develop in the future? If it were not for President Hua being a woman, with such small shoulders to carry such a heavy burden, do you think this Young Lord would offer you such a big opportunity? This Young Lord always shows tender affection and simply cannot bear to watch a beauty suffer.”

“President Jiang, I already gave you an explicit answer last time. My Five Paths Chamber of Commerce will never merge with your Saint Yuan Chamber of Commerce. Please give up and never bother me again,” Hua You Meng finished speaking and quickly turned to Yang Kai. “Let’s go.”

“Go?” Jiang Chao’s narrow eyes narrowed further as he moved quickly to block Hua You Meng’s path, “You think you can just leave? Since we have met today, don’t even think of leaving without giving me a satisfactory answer. Today, you have to agree to my proposal, even if you don’t agree!”

“You can’t stop me!” Hua You Meng exclaimed, “This is Purple Star City...”

“Ha!” Jiang Chao sneered, “So what if it is Purple Star City? President Hua seems to be misunderstanding this Young Lord’s previous courtesy for weakness. Have you forgotten about my identity? This Young Lord truly has not done anything yet, but even if he did, so what? What’s more... This Young Lord has heard that your Five Paths Chamber of Commerce made some trouble at the city gate yesterday. Although this Young Lord does not know why nothing has happened to you yet, if this Young Lord were to seize you and hand you over to the guards, surely he would be rewarded rather than punished.”

Hearing him mention his identity, Hua You Meng seemed to have remembered something and her pretty face could not help paling slightly, looking quite fearful.

Seeing her hesitancy, Jiang Chao sneered, “President Hua, don’t refuse a toast only to drink a loss. This Young Lord only has so much patience. Give me a satisfactory answer now and we will still be one family. If not...”

Hua You Meng looked helpless and had no choice but to turn to Yang Kai imploringly.

Yang Kai sighed, knowing that he would not be able to stay out of this matter anymore and took a step forward, patting Hua You Meng’s shoulder before having her step back behind him. Looking at Jiang Chao in front of him, Yang Kai suddenly chuckled, “Friend, did you forget to bring something when you went out today?”

Jiang Chao looked Yang Kai over with his slit eyes and spat fiercely, “Where did you come from little brat? You dare speak to this Young Lord?”

Seeing Hua You Meng’s docile and submissive appearance towards Yang Kai, he suddenly felt flames of jealousy burning in his heart, so he didn’t choose to be polite.

“You dare to call yourself ‘Young Lord’ in front of me, it seems you really forgot something when you went out today,” Yang Kai smiled.

Jiang Chao coldly spat, “Boy, why don’t you tell me what this Young Lord forgot!”

Yang Kai lifted his hand lightly, and before Jiang Chao could even react, Yang Kai tapped his finger on his forehead, smiled, and said, “Didn’t this friend forget his brain when he went out?”

Jiang Chao stumbled back several steps as a look of horror appeared on his face. He was a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, yet he could not even resist a light tap on his forehead, showing just how great the gap in strength between him and his opponent was. Given that, if the other party had any murderous intent just now, wouldn’t he already be dead?

Thinking so, Jiang Chao suddenly broke out into a cold sweat while simultaneously becoming angry out of shame and shouting, “Bastard, you dare mock me?”

Yang Kai laughed heartily and shook his head, “If you really brought your brain with you, how could you not understand the reason why we are still doing fine after beating someone up at the city gate yesterday?”

“What? Why is that?” Jiang Chao was confused by Yang Kai’s words.

“So, it turns out that friend didn’t go out without his brain but instead has a pig’s brain!” Yang Kai showed a sudden look of understanding.

*Puchi...*

Hua You Meng heard this and could not stop herself from laughing, but quickly realizing she was acting inappropriately, she hurriedly covered her red lips with her delicate hand.

“Impudence!” Jiang Chao was furious and his Saint Qi unconsciously burst forth as he charged forward, wanting to beat Yang Kai up.

The expressions of the two cultivators who had been following him changed drastically when they saw this and they both hurried forward to grab him, one of them seeming to realize something and quickly whispering into Jiang Chao’s ear.

Jiang Chao snorted and shouted angrily, “Has some kind of background? Even if he does, could it be stronger than this Young Lord’s? This Young Lord is a member of the Jiang Family! My Grandfather is Purple Star’s Eighth Elder! Whose background could be bigger than mine?”

Yang Kai took a look at Hua You Meng in amazement, “Is Purple Star’s Eighth Elder from his Jiang Family?”

“En, Elder Jiang Chang Feng is one of his Jiang Family’s Ancestors,” Hua You Meng nodded solemnly. Because of this, she was helpless regarding Jiang Chao’s harassment. Although Jiang Chao and the Eighth Elder were separated by many generations, possibly only meeting a few times a year and making them practically strangers, he could still walk sideways in Purple Star City with such a background.

Jiang Chao had taken an interest in Five Paths Chamber of Commerce and Hua You Meng personally for more than just a day or two, and if it were not for Hua You Meng actively avoiding him, it was difficult to say how things would have ended up already.

“Boy, are you scared?” Jiang Chao looked at Yang Kai triumphantly, “Kneel down and admit your mistakes now and this Young Lord may spare you, otherwise...”

“Otherwise?” Yang Kai looked at Jiang Chao with a smile, without any fear.

“Ignorant boy!” Jiang Chao raged and his anger overcame his hesitation, waving his hand as he commanded, “Take him for me!”

The two cultivators behind him hesitated, knowing that Yang Kai was not someone they should provoke, but since Jiang Chao had given an order, they had no choice but to obey. With a flicker, the two of them rushed towards Yang Kai one after another.

Both of these guards were Third-Order Origin Realm masters, and their personal strength was quite good, so although they were unable to figure out Yang Kai’s depths, they thought that the other side wouldn’t be able to resist when they teamed up.

But reality was destined to surprise them. Just as they rushed out towards Yang Kai, before they could even use any of their methods, they saw Yang Kai grin at them and simply wave his hands lightly.

This action was carefree and casual, as if he was driving away an annoying fly.

However, these two light slaps caused them to be simultaneously involved in a vortex of power they could not break away from.

“This is...”

“Not good!” The two yelled at the same time as they madly pushed their Saint Qi to resist, but in front of the powerful vortices, their Saint Qi was as vulnerable as weak as paper and was instantly shredded.

Two screams rang out as the two guards were thrown to the left and right respectively, smashing the shop walls on either side of the street and leaving behind gaping holes.

Suddenly, much cursing and scolding sounded from the nearby shops as many cultivators rushed out of the damaged buildings, searching for the one who dared stir up trouble in Purple Star City.

Jiang Chao standing stunned, his slit eyes bulging wide as he drew a sharp break and stared at Yang Kai in amazement, instantly understanding something and calling out in alarm, “Origin King Realm!?”

Although his two guards were not masters that stood at the apex of Origin Realm, they were definitely not weak, but the two of them had been defeated swiftly with just a light slap to the air. Only an Origin King would be able to accomplish this.

This simple-looking young man, who was definitely less handsome than him, was actually an Origin King? And he had just cursed him as a bastard?

Jiang Chao’s teeth began to chatter as he stared at Yang Kai in horror, feeling like the light smile on the other party’s face now looked quite terrifying.

He wanted to escape, but was shocked to discover that he couldn’t even circulate his Saint Qi at all. His feet seemed to be fixed in place and he was only able to watch as Yang Kai stepped towards him slowly.

The aura of death which began to shroud him caused Jiang Chao to shiver in fright!

“Who dares act dissolute in Purple Star City!” An angry shout suddenly came from far away and a group of guards flew out of the crowd, instantly surrounding the place where Yang Kai and Jiang Chao stood, glaring at the two troublemakers with gloomy faces.

“Purple Star City expressly forbids fighting and killing! If anyone dares disobey, their cultivation will be wasted, and they will be thrown into the Frozen Prison or immediately killed. Commander Lu has publicly proclaimed this several times, yet there seems to be some who still don’t take it seriously. This Vice Commander is here to ensure that those who refuse to obey Purple Star City’s laws... ah... So, it was Sir here... Qu Zheng greets Sir!”
