After listening to Kang Si Ran’s explanation, Yang Kai understood the gist of the matter.

The Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda was a supreme treasure of Star Soul Palace and was famous across the Star Boundary.

This was not only because it was a powerful Emperor Artifact, but also because it was extremely special. The Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda’s internal Self-Contained World was similar to his Sealed World Bead, but it was far more complete than the Sealed World Bead.

It was rumoured that the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda belonged to Bright Moon Great Emperor, the master of Star Soul Palace, but this Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda already existed in some form before Bright Moon Great Emperor became famous.

Only after it was acquired by Bright Moon Great Emperor and further refined and improved did it become what it was today.

The space inside the pagoda was said to be an ancient battlefield, one which had many scattered ancient treasures and extinct spirit grasses as well as various sealed regions to explore. Now, the pagoda was situated inside Star Soul Palace and was one of the most coveted experience zones for Star Soul Palace disciples.

As long as they met certain requirements, disciples of Star Soul Palace could enter the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda for life experience.

Inside, they could hone their cultivation, improve their fighting skills, and study the mysteries of the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao.

Although the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda had existed for countless years, and after so many years, countless cultivators had entered it for life experience and to search for opportunities, the number of treasures inside had only increased with time.

The reason was simple: Entering came with risk. Many of Star Soul Palace’s disciples had fallen inside, leaving behind their Space Rings as well as their artifacts, enriching the bounty of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda and becoming treasures for others to seek.

The Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda was divided into five layers, with the first and second being for Origin Kings to explore, the third and fourth layers for Dao Source cultivators, and the highest fifth layer being for Emperors to gain experience and pursue the Dao.

Inside the pagoda, there were not only ancient hidden artifacts and spirit grasses that had matured for countless years, but there were even fragments of World Principles and Star Sources.

This was because it was a shattered ancient battlefield. In ancient times countless powerful cultivators had fought and died inside, leaving behind shattered World Principles and Star Sources.

Though neither of these were complete, they still contained much power and many insights which if obtained and comprehended by cultivators would be of huge benefit.

After cultivating to the peak of the Origin King Realm, the next step was the Dao Source Realm where one would begin to comprehend Principle Strength. However, Dao Source Realm cultivators could only stimulate and borrow Principle Strength from the world around them. In order to truly use Principle Strength, the laws of the world, one needed to reach the Emperor Realm, and even then, some simple manipulation of Principle Strength was the most that could be achieved.

In the Star Boundary, countless Origin Kings had finished the conversion of their Saint Qi into Source Qi, but only a few could break through to the Dao Source Realm because the biggest hurdle was their inability to perceive and comprehend World Principles.

This was the reason why cultivators who were Star Masters were so highly coveted in the Star Boundary.

For example, Yang Kai had already experienced Shadowed Star’s World Principles back when he was just an Origin Returning Realm master, and although those were just the World Principles of a Cultivation Star rule, incomparable to the Principles of the Star Boundary, just the experience was enough to give him a significant edge in comprehension. Because he had this experience, Yang Kai would not face much of a bottleneck when breaking through to the Dao Source Realm in the future and would even have an advantage when trying to reach the Emperor Realm.

However, this kind of advantage was not just admired and appreciated, it also inspired great envy, and sometimes even murder and robbery! Netherworld Sect’s Yin Le Sheng was the best example.

As such, Yang Kai did not reveal the secret of him being a Star Master.

“Having said all that, Alchemist Yang should understand that the opening of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda is a great opportunity, yes?” Kang Si Ran asked with a beaming face.

“En, I understand. If this is the case, then the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda is indeed a good place to explore,” Yang Kai nodded.

“There’s more as well,” Kang Si Ran smiled slightly, “Alchemist Yang should know that the current Maplewood City is currently a big mix of dragons and snakes, with countless representatives of big and small forces present. So, with Sir Star Envoy opening the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, how could those top great forces not show due respect?”

“Shopkeeper Kang means...” Yang Kai was shocked as he suddenly thought of a possibility.

“Heh heh heh... Alchemist Yang, Heavenly Martial Holy Land, Orthodoxy Temple, Azure Sun Temple, and many other great forces have all brought out some precious treasures to add to the pagoda. Not only were there some rare pills, there were also powerful Secret Arts, Secret Techniques, and even some Dao Source Grade artifacts!”

Yang Kai’s eyes lit hearing this.

If this was really the case, then all of Maplewood City would certainly be stirred up.

Normally, cultivators who were not born into power trying to obtain any advantage from the various great forces would be more difficult than ascending to the Heavens, but this time, such a good opportunity had appeared, with countless rare treasures hidden inside the pagoda just waiting for someone to find them! How could the various cultivators not rush out to seize this chance?

“Heavenly Martial Holy Land even took out three Dao Source Fruits as a part of their contribution!” Kang Si Ran’s expression suddenly became excited as his voice trembled, “Alchemist Yang, you are an Alchemist, so you must know the role of Dao Source Fruits better than anyone.”

“The Dao Source Fruit used to refine Dao Source Pills?” Yang Kai called out in alarm.

“Indeed!” Kang Si Ran couldn’t restrain the shaking of his hands as his tea cup even sprinkled out some water, “Only a few great forces in the Star Boundary can grow Dao Source Fruits, and in the Southern Territory, only Heavenly Martial Holy Land is capable of this, even Star Soul Palace does not have Dao Source Fruit trees. What’s more, only six Dao Source Fruits mature every ten years, yet Heavenly Martial Holy Land actually brought out three for this event, a massive sacrifice on their part.”

“Does Shopkeeper Kang want one of those Dao Source Fruits?” Yang Kai saw that his fanatical expression was and had a guess.

“Of course this old master wants one!” Kang Si Ran smiled bitterly, “Alchemist Yang, this old master has been stuck at the peak of the Third-Order Origin King Realm for more than two hundred years already. This old master knows his aptitude is poor, and unless he has some kind of great fortuitous encounter, reaching the Dao Source Realm in this lifetime will be impossible; however, if this old master can obtain a Dao Source Fruit... this old master can also make an attempt! Whether this old master ultimately succeeds or not, at least he will have a chance!”

Although Kang Si Ran was the shopkeeper of Spirit Pill Plaza, and technically a member of Violet Source Chamber of Commerce, because his strength and status were low, there was no way he could obtain a precious resource like a Dao Source Pill internally.

Each Dao Source Pill represented a great opportunity to create a Dao Source Realm cultivator, so Violet Source Chamber of Commerce would obviously not arbitrarily grant them to its subordinates. One would need to make a corresponding contribution or pay an appropriate price first.

Kang Si Ran had managed Spirit Pill Plaza in Maplewood City for two hundred years, and while he had some small achievements during this period, they were nowhere near enough to trade for a Dao Source Pill.

Yang Kai could thus understand Kang Si Ran’s excitement.

Because one Dao Source Fruit could refine a single furnace of Dao Source Pills, and there is a limit of each furnace to produce nine pills, as long as Kang Si Ran could obtain a single Dao Source Fruit, as long as he found a Grandmaster to refine it, he could at least obtain one or two Dao Source Pills.

Once he broke through to the Dao Source Realm, his status in Violet Source Chamber of Commerce would be completely different and there would be no need for him to remain in a small place like Maplewood City.

Without even mentioning Kang Si Ran’s desires, Yang Kai also wanted those Dao Source Pills.

Once he finished the transformation of his Saint Qi into Source Qi and was able to touch upon the secrets of Principle Strength, he would be eligible to break through to the Dao Source Realm, so a Dao Source Pill would greatly increase his chance of successfully breaking through.

“Alchemist Yang, do you want to enter the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda?” Kang Si Ran calmed down and asked Yang Kai.

“Such a grand event, I certainly don’t want to miss it,” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

“Very good, very good!” Kang Si Ran laughed, “If we miss this opportunity, it will be impossible to enter the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda in this lifetime.”

“But Shopkeeper Kang... If what you said is true, then this experience will likely be extremely dangerous. You and I are both Third-Order Origin Kings, so there is no worry facing other Origin Kings, but if we were to encounter a Dao Source Realm master...”

“Haha, Alchemist Yang need not worry about that,” Kang Si Ran smiled and waved. “The Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda is not so easy to open. Sir Star Envoy has extended a great kindness to our Maplewood City cultivators, but how could he possibly completely open the pagoda? This time, only the first two layers will be opened, so only Origin Kings and below will be able to enter. There won’t be any Dao Source Realm cultivators inside.”

“Is that so?” Yang Kai was surprised.

But when he thought about it for a bit, he understood.

The Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda was a powerful Emperor Artifact, so even opening it once would definitely require a significant price. Even if it was a Star Envoy of Star Soul Palace, no matter who he was, it would be impossible to completely open the pagoda.

If he did, the loss to Star Soul Palace would be too great.

However, this was just the situation Yang Kai wanted to see.

As long as there were no Dao Source cultivators, he didn’t need to fear anything. When the time came, he would only need to worry about the native dangers inside the pagoda.

“En, this is why this old master was so anxious in summoning Alchemist Yang over, I wanted to inform you about this before the official announcement. Right now, only those who followed Sir Star Envoy to Clear Jade Mountain know about this. Now that Alchemist Yang has received this news though, he can make appropriate preparations.”

“Many thanks for your consideration, Shopkeeper Kang,” Yang Kai said gratefully.

“Alchemist Yang need not be so polite. Without you, Spirit Pill Plaza might not even exist, this is simply this old master returning the favour.”

“In that case, this Yang will take his leave first. I really do need to go back and prepare,” Yang Kai spoke and stood up.

“Then this old master will await your arrival three days from now,” Kang Si Ran cupped his fists slightly. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Yang Kai nodded and left Spirit Pill Plaza.

Upon returning to his secluded home, Yang Kai took out the herbs he had collected from the Small Sealed World medicine garden before he immediately began to refine some Spirit Pills.

Although it was only cultivators at the Origin King Realm and below who would be entering, and Yang Kai was not worried he would encounter powerful enemies, having some Spirit Pills ready was only prudent. If something dangerous happened, it could mean the difference between victory and defeat, life and death.

With the pile of herbs beside him, Yang Kai began refining one furnace after another, soon immersing himself in his work.
