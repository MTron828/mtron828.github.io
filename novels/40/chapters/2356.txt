“Were you two the ones who were stirring up trouble in Endless Treasures Pavilion earlier?” Pang Guang went straight to the point and coldly questioned Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun. He had clearly learned of the appearances of the troublemakers through some unknown means.

Liu Xian Yun’s pretty face paled and she did not dare to answer.

She was only a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator and she had just broken through recently. Her realm wasn’t even consolidated yet. Naturally, facing an Emperor Realm Master felt as stressful as if a mountain was piled on top of her.

But Yang Kai was calm and unperturbed, only giving Pang Guang a simple glance.

Compared to Qiu Ze, Pang Guang’s aura was undoubtedly stronger and more powerful. He was very clearly stronger than Qiu Ze, but his power was limited. With Yang Kai’s strengths and means, there was no need for him to fear him.

When neither of them answered, Pang Guang bellowed at once, “You dare stay silent when this King questions you?”

His Emperor Pressure suddenly poured out, filling the entire teahouse. The faces of the other cultivators who were still drinking tea changed, going completely stiff. The murderous intent that was as dense as if it was material instantly sent shivers down their spines when it seeped into their skin and bones. They cursed Yang Kai for not knowing the immensity of Heaven and Earth, acting so wantonly in front of the City Lord and even dragging them into it. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

With a gentle wave of Yang Kai’s hand though, it was as if a sharp sword had cut through the dim sky and the Emperor Pressure enveloping him and Liu Xian Yun dissipated instantly, feeling as if the clouds had cleared to reveal clear skies.

Pang Guang was shocked. Only then did he begin re-examining Yang Kai.

He could clearly sense that Yang Kai was only at the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, but then how could he disperse his Emperor Pressure with just a wave of his hand? Even though it was just one move, Pang Guang didn’t dare to underestimate Yang Kai anymore. He knew that if this young man could make a big mess of his Endless Treasures Pavilion and had the guts to sit here, it meant he probably had something to rely on.

[Does this guy come from some top Sect? If not, how could he have such heritage?]

He had heard that the elite disciples of those top Sects had the strength to fight above their realm. If this young man really did come from one of those top Sects, then things were going to be tricky today.

At that moment, Pang Guang suddenly felt some uncertainty well up in his heart. For a City Lord to have an establishment under his name be turned upside down with his subordinates killed or injured, where was he going to put his face if the other party wouldn’t give him a satisfactory answer?

But if this man had a strong background, he may not necessarily be able to provoke him. Don’t look at how Pang Guang lorded over Marsh City, he really wasn’t anything in the eyes of those top Sects. If anything happened, those people could just send one of their Elders over and they would be able to destroy him several dozen to a hundred times over.

As he was still thinking about how he was going to solve today’s problem without offending too many people while still maintaining his reputation, he suddenly sensed something different around him.

Shocked, he turned his head around, only to see that an elderly man had somehow appeared beside him at some point. This old man had a head of white hair but he looked quite hale and hearty. Dressed in grey linen robes, the man looked completely inconspicuous.

[When did this old thing appear?]

Pang Guang was astonished. He was only thinking about Yang Kai earlier and completely did not notice when this elderly man appeared. And, this man’s face was also extremely unfamiliar to him. He had clearly never met this person before.

Yang Kai was also taken aback by the old man’s sudden appearance.

Pang Guang was distracted earlier and didn’t pay much attention to the old man’s sudden appearance, but Yang Kai saw the whole thing.

This elderly man appeared completely without warning, as if he simply materialized out of thin air in the blink of an eye.

Yang Kai steadied his thoughts and quietly released his Divine Sense to check the old man’s cultivation. Much to his surprise, it was like his Divine Sense was trying to probe an endless ocean, sinking in and disappearing without a trace.

This old man... turned out to be an even more powerful Emperor Realm Master than Pang Guang. At the very least, he had to be a Second-Order Emperor, but most likely he was a Third-Order Emperor.

Such a Master existed in Marsh City? Yang Kai was thoroughly shocked. He quietly glanced at Pang Guang. If these two were on the same side, then things would be tricky. He originally thought that Pang Guang was the only one to be wary of in Marsh City, that’s why Yang Kai wasn’t afraid at all. But now that an even more powerful old man had appeared, Yang Kai was already beginning to consider how he was going to get out of here safely.

But after taking a glance at him, Yang Kai felt reassured. That was because Pang Guang also had a suspicious look on his face at the moment. He clearly did not know this elderly man.

As a City Lord, he actually did not realize what sorts of hidden dragons and crouching tigers were hiding under his own territory. It had to be said that Pang Guang was truly a failure as a City Lord.

The elderly man had a burning gaze at the moment, as if he had discovered something of great interest, and smiled at Yang Kai, “This Old Master is Yao Chang Jun, the owner of this teahouse. How should I address you, Little Brother?”

He had an amiable look on his face as if he were an easily approachable Senior, but Yang Kai could instinctively feel a dangerous aura coming from him.

Before Yang Kai could say anything, Pang Guang coldly snorted and said, “This City Lord has something to discuss with this young man. Unrelated people should excuse themselves now.”

He had a commanding look on his face, as if he didn’t put Yao Chang Jun in his eyes at all.

As soon as his words came out, Yang Kai’s expression turned odd instantly.

But very soon, he understood. He guessed that Pang Guang probably did not know Yao Chang Jun’s depths. Otherwise, he would not dare talk to him like this. And, after his previous attempts to shake Yang Kai with his prestige failed miserably, Yao Chang Jun also did not even look at him after he showed up, so Pang Guang was probably acting out of anger without thinking right now.

Yang Kai not putting him in his eyes was one thing, but how dare a trivial owner of a teahouse under his jurisdiction not show him respect?

As a City Lord, how could Pang Guang bear this?

“You want this Old Master to excuse himself?” Yao Chang Jun grinned meaningfully and looked at Pang Guang with interest, “Are you sure of that?”

Only now did Pang Guang realize that something was wrong and quickly released his Divine Sense to check Yao Chang Jun’s cultivation, but it was already too late. The latter had already struck a palm towards Pang Guang and coldly snorted, “A trivial First-Order Emperor dares act so presumptuous in front of this Old Master? Scram!”

The Qi rumbled in his palm like a vortex of stars, harbouring tremendous power.

When he released his Qi, it seemed to shake both Heaven and Earth.

Pang Guang’s face changed dramatically. There was no way he still didn’t know his foolish self had just provoked someone he shouldn’t have. Terrified, he quickly retreated backwards, shock apparent in his voice, “Senior, mercy!”

But no matter how he tried to dodge it, the old man’s palm still hit him square in the chest. Following a loud bang, Pang Guang’s entire body flew backwards like a sack, destroying several dozen buildings along the way before he landed miserably on the ground, coughing out a mouthful of blood.

The rowdy cultivators on the third floor of the Delightful Pleasures Teahouse were all dead silent.

All their eyes were so wide they threatened to pop out of their sockets at this sight.

Marsh City’s City Lord, a First-Order Emperor Realm Master, Sir Pang Guang, was actually sent flying by an unknown old man!

And what’s more, this old man was the owner of the Delightful Pleasures Teahouse!

If they had not seen it with their own eyes, then they never would have believed it.

It turned out the real master behind Marsh City was not the City Lord at the front, but the hidden owner of this teahouse!

How high was this teahouse owner’s cultivation to be able to send Pang Guang flying with one hit? Second-Order Emperor Realm? Third-Order?

Everyone was shocked beyond words. When some of them thought back to how they used to go crazy in this teahouse and deliberately made things difficult for the shop-hands, they suddenly became morbidly ill all over. A cold chill went down from the tops of their heads to the soles of their feet as if they had fallen into a freezing blizzard.

Only now did they realize that Delightful Pleasures Teahouse was definitely not a place where they could act wild and unrestrained. With the cultivation of the owner, if he really did want to take their lives, even Pang Guang wouldn’t dare to make any noise. The reason why they were fine was clearly that the owner didn’t care.

[We will never dare cause trouble here again!] Each of the cultivators vowed in their hearts.

“Now we can talk.” After slapping Pang Guang away, Yao Chang Jun sat in front of Yang Kai with a smile, face looking calm and relaxed as if he was just slapping away a fly.

Liu Xian Yun was completely dumbfounded. Her face was drained of colour and her teeth chattering. She originally thought that they had just offended Pang Guang, but now she didn’t expect an even more powerful Master to jump out.

“What does Senior wish to talk to me about?” Yang Kai frowned and asked. From the moves he showed just now, this Yao Chang Jun was clearly not as amiable as he may seem on the surface; rather, he seemed to be an old monster subject to shifting moods.

How could Yang Kai dare to treat such a person lightly?

While speaking, Yang Kai silently slipped the jade box into his robe.

But obviously, his actions could not be hidden from Yao Chang Jun’s eyes. With just a reach of his hands, the owner of Delightful Pleasures Teahouse was able to make the box in Yang Kai’s hand fly into his own.

Yang Kai’s face sank immediately. He knew that Yao Chang Jun had likely sensed the aura of the Pristine Soul Heavenly Restoration Lotus, and that’s why he appeared. A peerless treasure like this was definitely of great use to any cultivator.

Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to snatch away his things in such a way.

If he had known this would happen, then Yang Kai would not have opened the seal of the jade box here. Only, who would have thought that an old monster would be hidden inside this teahouse? Yang Kai sighed in his heart and could only hope that Yao Chang Jun had no idea about the secrets behind the Pristine Soul Heavenly Restoration Lotus.

“Let’s talk about this,” Yao Chang Jun grinned meaningfully, with a ‘don’t play slick in front of me, boy’ look on his face. While speaking, he gently opened a crack on the jade box and his face suddenly turned solemn, as if the jade box contained something extremely precious and important to him.

A faint fragrance wafted out from the jade box, and a look of astonishment emerged in Yao Chang Jun’s eyes, causing him to rejoice, “As expected, it’s this! This Old Master has waited two hundred years for this day, it was not in vain! Hahahaha.”

Yao Chang Jun’s face beamed instantly.

From how Yao Chang Jun was talking, there was no way Yang Kai wouldn’t know that he recognized the Pristine Soul Heavenly Restoration Lotus. What’s more, this old man kept his identity hidden and opened a teahouse here, surprisingly just for the sake of this treasure, and he even waited more than two hundred years!

“Boy, tell this Old Master, where did you find this?” After confirming that the jade box did indeed contain the Pristine Soul Heavenly Restoration Lotus, Yao Chang Jun suddenly became eager. The warmth from just now was long gone, on the contrary, his voice was now dark, very likely hinting to Yang Kai that he would show no mercy if he dared hide the truth from him.
