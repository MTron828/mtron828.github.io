Logically, if Yang Kai had any special relationship with Spirit Beast Island, he would know how to get there instead of asking for their help.

With this thought in mind, Qian Xiu Ying gazed at Lan He and said with a smile, “Don’t worry, Little He. I’m sure he’s a lucky person, so the two top Sects might not be able to harm him.”

Lan He lifted her head to look at her, “Martial Aunt, you mean…”

Qian Xiu Ying explained, “Those proficient in the Dao of Space are unmatched when it comes to escaping and tracking. Even if he’s no match for the two top Sects, he can still flee. Have you heard the rumour? In the past, Senior Li Wu Yi had somehow offended Flower Shadow Great Emperor and was hunted down by her, but in the end, he relied on his Space Divine Ability to escape from death’s door. You have to understand that Great Emperors are the most powerful Masters in this world. Although Senior Li Wu Yi is touted to be second only to the Great Emperors, there is still a clear difference between them. The fact that he was able to escape from Flower Shadow Great Emperor’s grasp shows just how amazing Space Divine Abilities are. Although this Yang Kai might not be as skilful as Senior Li Wu Yi, he must be able to keep himself safe.”

Upon hearing that, Lan He couldn’t help but recall that Yang Kai had showcased his instantaneous movement before. Suddenly, she found Qian Xiu Ying’s words to be sensible, as that Space Divine Ability was truly incredible. Yang Kai was able to move thousands of kilometres in the blink of an eye, so those from Netherworld Sect and Brahma Holy Land really might not be able to touch him.

With this thought in mind, Lan He could set her mind at ease a little, but the guilt she felt in her heart did not subside.

Upon reaching the side hall, Lan He didn’t enter because she was too embarrassed to face Yang Kai. So, she just waited outside with a dejected expression.

Seeing this, Tang Sheng and Qian Xiu Ying didn’t force her and let her stay outside.

When Yang Kai, who was inside the hall, noticed that a man and a woman were walking toward him, he immediately rose from the chair and turned to look at them, after which he was able to identify them.

On the way to this place, Lan He had told him about the situation in Heavenly Wolf Valley, so he knew that there were only two Second-Order Emperor Realm Masters in this Sect. The two people before his eyes must be the aforementioned Valley Master Tang Sheng and his wife Qian Xiu Ying.

The two were a perfectly matched couple, and as a guest, Yang Kai had to show enough respect, so he immediately cupped his fists and uttered, “Yang Kai greets Valley Master Tang, Vice Valley Master Qian. Please forgive my sudden intrusion without invitation.”

Tang Sheng guffawed at such forthright behaviour which was very different from the elegant fa?ade most youths put up. Nodding, he walked over and said, “Young Master Yang, you don’t have to be overly polite with us. You are Little He’s saviour, which makes you Heavenly Wolf Valley’s honoured guest. There is nothing you need apologise for.”

Qian Xiu Ying also cupped her fists with a smiling face, “Greetings, Young Master Yang.”

Yang Kai was startled for a moment. Although the married couple appeared hospitable, their words gave him a feeling that they were trying to keep a certain distance from him. Then, he realised that he wasn’t close to Lan He, and it was the first time he met this couple, so he stopped minding it. However, when he looked out the hall and didn’t see Lan He, he felt that something was off.

“Have a seat, please.” Tang Sheng gestured at him as he and Qian Xiu Ying took the main seats before he called out, “Bring us some tea!”

Following that, a maidservant entered the place to get everything prepared.

Tang Sheng put on a polite smile and looked fixedly at Yang Kai, “I hear that Young Master Yang comes from the Southern Territory, yes?”

Yang Kai nodded, “In a certain sense.”

The married couple traded glances before Tang Sheng asked again, “Where does Young Master Yang reside now then? This Yang can see that you are a Second-Order Emperor, and with such cultivation at your age, the place you come from must be quite extraordinary.”

Yang Kai replied with a faint smile, “I’m a High-Rank Guest Elder of Azure Sun Temple.”

He didn’t tell them that he was the Palace Master of High Heaven Palace in the Northern Territory; after all, the couple was convinced that he was from the Southern Territory, so if he told them that he was a Palace Master in the Northern Territory, it would seem like he was inflating his own importance.

“Azure Sun Temple!” Tang Sheng was startled, “Do you mean the Azure Sun Temple that is one of the top three Sects in the Southern Territory?”

Yang Kai nodded, “There is only one Azure Sun Temple in the Southern Territory.”

Tang Sheng sighed, “This Tang has long heard about how famous Azure Sun Temple is. The three top Sects of Southern Territory, Azure Sun Temple, Orthodoxy Temple and Heavenly Martial Holy Land are each as powerful as the three top Sects in the Eastern Territory. All of them are the top forces in this world. Our little Heavenly Wolf Valley is simply not comparable to them at all.”

Yang Kai replied politely, “Valley Master, you need not be overly humble. Heavenly Wolf Valley is doing well and both you and Vice Valley Master Qian possess formidable power. I am certain your Sect will one day find itself among the top of the world.”

Tang Sheng guffawed, “Many thanks for your kind words.” He paused for a moment, “By the way, when I was young, I had set a goal to travel around all four territories in the Star Boundary one day. However, I was bogged down by many things, so I couldn’t realise my dream. In fact, I’ve never even stepped out of Eastern Territory before, so I feel a little embarrassed. Since you’re from the Southern Territory, can you tell me about the differences between there and here?”

Qian Xiu Ying also looked curiously at Yang Kai, seemingly very interested in hearing about this topic.

Yang Kai was startled for a moment. However, since he had a favour to ask of this pair, he decided to satisfy their curiosity. In fact, he had been to all four territories in the Star Boundary, and he had experienced the different cultures and customs of each one. Although he was much younger than Tang Sheng and Qian Xiu Ying, he did have more knowledge and experience than them when it came to such matters. At that moment, he started narrating his past experiences to them, which engrossed them in his stories as if they were able to go through his experiences for themselves. At the same time, they kept asking the young man many questions.

A long time later, Yang Kai could feel that his throat was dry, but the couple still seemed interested in finding out more. However, they didn’t seem to have the intention of talking about the Faith Token from Spirit Beast Island, which made him slightly frustrated.

He knew that Lan He must have told them his purpose of visit, so he wondered what they were up to by asking about Southern Territory instead of discussing the token.

Finding a break in the conversation, Yang Kai decided to take the initiative, “Forgive me for being forward, but this Yang has come here today because I have a favour to ask of you.”

Upon hearing this, Tang Sheng heaved a sigh, “Young Master Yang, I already know what your request is, as Little He told me about it; however, I’m afraid that I must disappoint you.”

Yang Kai was stunned, “You mean…”

With a bitter smile, Tang Sheng explained, “Long ago, our Ancestral Founders indeed obtained a Howling Moon Heavenly Wolf’s descendant, but it wasn’t a pureblood descendant and only possessed a faint bloodline from its ancestors, so it was nothing special. Somehow, those from Spirit Beast Island got the news and sent a Beast Seeker to our valley to obtain that Monster Beast and give us some compensation. All this is true; however, regarding the Faith Token, that is actually just a fabricated story.”

“A fabricated story?” Yang Kai was stunned. [How does one even think to fabricate such a story?]

Tang Sheng went on to say, “En, this story was specifically made up and spread far and wide to add a layer of invisible protection for our Sect so that the other great forces would be wary of us. Since this all happened thousands of years ago, those from Spirit Beast Island certainly have learned of it by now, but it is also true that they brought away our Monster Beast, and what was done did not harm their reputation. Given their power, Spirit Beast Island apparently didn’t want to bother making things difficult for my Valley. However, this Tang never expected that one day it would draw Young Master Yang here on false pretences. For this, I am truly sorry.”

Upon hearing his explanation, Yang Kai smiled helplessly. Earlier, he thought that luck was on his side, but he hadn’t expected that the Faith Token turned out to be a made-up story. Since he had found out about the truth, there was nothing else he could say. Realising something at that moment, he asked, “Is Sister Lan afraid to meet me because of this?”

After a sigh, Qian Xiu Ying explained, “Little He feels that she has broken her word to you and was too embarrassed to meet you.”

Yang Kai burst into laughter, “There’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Sister Lan is thinking too much.”

Qian Xiu Ying went on to say, “Little He has always been an honest and upright girl. Over the years, she never forgot the fact that you had saved her life; therefore, after she bumped into you in the Eastern Territory, she wanted to repay that favour any way she could. However, she was never informed about the truth of this matter, so she really believed we had that Faith Token and brought you to this place as a result.”

Tang Sheng said, “It is all this Tang’s fault. At that time, our Ancestors simply wished to add a layer of protection for our Sect, but I didn’t expect that Little He would be hurt because of this one day. Please don’t blame her.”

A solemn Yang Kai replied, “I won’t.”

If Lan He hadn’t warned him, he wouldn’t have even been aware that he had been targeted by Brahma Holy Land and Netherworld Sect.

Qian Xiu Ying suggested, “If you really want to head to Spirit Beast Island, you can walk around Seaside City. You might get a clue from there.”

Yang Kai nodded and thought that if he really couldn’t find the way to get there, he would just forget about it. His main reason for coming to the Eastern Territory was to head to Dragon Island, so going to Spirit Beast Island was optional.

Then, he recalled that Liu Yan had lived on Spirit Beast Island for a long time; however, she might not know the island’s location. That was because when Jiu Feng brought her away, she was still a Phoenix egg, and after that, she went directly to Dragon Island before following Yang Kai to the Lower Star Field.

Just then, Tang Sheng suddenly frowned and took out a communication artifact from his Space Ring. As his expression changed, he turned to look at Qian Xiu Ying.

Yang Kai observed his expression and could guess that he must have received an important message, so with a smile, he said, “If something has happened, please attend to it first. This Yang can see himself out on his own. If I have some free time in the future, I will certainly come here to pay you a visit again.”

Rising from his chair, Tang Sheng replied, “Please forgive this Tang’s lack of hospitality, but there is indeed something of importance that requires immediate attention. Since that’s the case, I won’t be overly polite and take my leave now.”

After he finished speaking, he left the hall with Qian Xiu Ying.

Yang Kai turned to look at their figures and touched his chin as a meaningful glint flashed across his eyes.

He wasn’t a fool. Although what Tang Sheng had said was logical and reasonable, his actions made Yang Kai feel that something was off. Yang Kai didn’t dare to judge whether they really had that Faith Token, but he was certain that they didn’t welcome him. Otherwise, the couple wouldn’t have left together. Even though there was an urgent matter, only one person was needed to handle it, so why would both of them leave together?

Furthermore, they didn’t even try to persuade Yang Kai to stay for a few days more. After he said that he would leave on his own, he could even feel that they were secretly breathing sighs of relief.

It was apparent that they were worried that Yang Kai would attract trouble to their Sect.
