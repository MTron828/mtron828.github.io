“You are not qualified.” Kai Yang roared, burning one drop of his Yang liquid he made his body turn into a fireball, radiating burning hot waves of Yang Qi.

While speaking Kai Yang moved towards Yuan Lang, sending out a fist attack. A dull thumping sound was heard before Kai Yang staggered due to backlash. But Yuan Lang on the other hand, with a startled cry, was sent flying.

Retreating three steps, Kai Yang fell into the attack range of the surrounding three people. These three attacked Kai Yang one after another, Kai Yang dodged the attack from a master of separation and reunion boundary while exposing his back to only the weakest disciple in the Blood Group.

Kai Yang’s double palm attack, which contained a huge strength, was directed towards the chest of the person who was the most vigilant, senior brother Cai.

He was also the person who reminded Yuan Lang a moment ago not to be rash and saved him from Kai Yang’s trap.

Of the four people who were led by him, his strength was naturally the highest. Even if his strength was sealed he was still at the Qi transforming boundary second level. Therefore Kai Yang decided to strike to kill him first. As long as he was killed, the other three weren’t that big of a threat to him.

In a single breath, Kai Yang was able to deal with four different people simultaneously.

Senior brother Cai saw that Kai Yang had abandoned all pretense of defense and was instead targeting him, this made his brows wrinkle. Although he didn’t know what Kai Yang was thinking, in his heart he had a bad premonition.

In his palm attack, Kai Yang had surely hid some sort of profound technique.

Drawing back, he also made his decision quickly. Although he didn’t believe that Kai Yang could injure him, it was always better to play it safe. While drawing back he simultaneously raised both of his hands in a defensive position in front of Kai Yang, wanting to probe his strength.

Their palms had not even come in contact with each other yet he discovered that the corner of Kai Yang’s mouth was carrying a cold, ruthless and sinister smile.

It doesn’t look good. I fell into a trap!

In the next instant, he saw Kai Yang’s palms increasing in speed and moving forward while avoiding his own palms with a fearless determination, targeting his chest.

These two palms would without a doubt hit him, but at the same time his own attack would also hit Kai Yang in return. Is it that you want both of us to be injured simultaneously?

This thought had not even properly formed when Kai Yang’s palms also changed, his hands suddenly began to burn and became blood red, looking like a palm covered in burning fluid with a very hot temperature.

He could not dodge. The eyes of senior Cai contained ruthlessness. This attack of Kai Yang’s contained a drop of Yang liquid, after this attack either you die or I will.

Senior brother Cai was after all a master of the separation and reunion boundary, although his strength was sealed and his current strength gave Senior brother Cai a feeling like playing with bamboo fencing, but the quality of his world Qi is higher than Kai Yang’s wasn’t it?

Two bumping sound were transmitted simultaneously.

Senior brother Cai’s palm hit Kai Yang at the same time that Kai Yang’s double palm hit his own chest.

In a moment, World Qi was transmitted to Senior brother Cai’s chest and it felt like his skin is melting.

This boy’s World Qi is very pure. Senior brother Cai was shocked; if not for his cultivation being higher he could have died by the might of his palm alone.

Before this shock had even subsided, he once again felt Kai Yang’s palms transmitting a boiling hot World Qi.

Along with this hot World Qi which was being transmitted into his chest, he felt a severe pain; there was a slight feeling of his body being penetrated. This World Qi was even causing his internal organs to be burnt.

“Get away from me.” Senior Cai was enraged; Kai Yang was no longer able to keep his attack going and was thrown flying backwards like a rag bag upside down.

Without enough time to react Kai Yang could only lower his body but was unable to dodge the attacks of other members of the Blood Group. A sword pierced his shoulder directly and his shoulder started to bleed, creating a hole that was visible on his shoulder.

This attack hadn’t even ended, taking advantage of his injury another master of the separation and reunion boundary who was finally able to find an opportunity, kicked Kai Yang in his lower ribs ruthlessly.

Kai Yang had dodged his attack a moment ago which made him feel a little shame. So after finding such an opportunity he was obviously going to be ruthless.

At this moment a small bottle suddenly fell from Kai Yang’s chest pocket to the ground.

In mid air Kai Yang spurted out a mouthful of blood and his legs staggered when he fell to the ground. His eyes contained some anxiety when looking towards the bottle that had fallen from his pocket. But he didn’t dare to go forward and pick it up. Concentrating his energy on his feet, with lightning speed he submerged himself into the jungle for the first time.

Yuan Lang, seeing his expression hurried to pick up that small bottle.

Kai Yang’s laughter was transmitted from a distance, “Ha, Blood Group separation and reunion boundary masters are just mediocre.”

How would he run now? The Blood Group people looked at each other in blank dismay. They came to this place because of Kai Yang’s howl. While he called them to come to find him, after that moment required to howl he could have simply run away, but he didn’t and instead he waited for them to arrive, while speaking to them his tone had even been quite arrogant. At that moment they thought that Kai Yang had a ace hidden up his sleeve but at this moment he unexpectedly ran away.

Didn’t this mean he is just a dog knew how to bark but can’t bite? After hearing his talk they had thought he surely had an ace, but now looking at the direction he escaped to they can only snort contemptuously.

“Let’s go after him, he was seriously injured just now and he wouldn’t be able to run for long.” Yuan Lang said while bitterly shaking his hands. He was only able to exchange one blow with him, he had not thought that Kai Yang’s fist could contain such power. After recovering from his last attack when he returned to join the fight, unexpectedly the fight had ended.

After three breaths of time, they staggered forward with a dumb expression.

After saying this, Yuan Lang then immediately started pursuing Kai Yang, the others also hurried to follow.

Before they could even run a few steps, from behind them they heard the sound of something heavy falling to the ground. It surprised them, turning back when they looked down they were surprised to see that their Senior brother Cai was unexpectedly on the ground, his back facing upward, motionless.

“Senior Brother are you alright?” Yuan Lang asked alarmed, but he didn’t get any response. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“What happened?” the lowest strength disciple asked uncertainly.

A moment ago senior brother Cai exchanged a blow with Kai Yang, getting wounded silently. It wasn’t possible that he had been seriously injured in that exchange, right?

“Something is wrong.” The third person’s brows wrinkled, he hurriedly moved forward towards the body of senior brother Cai and suddenly called out in alarm.

He suddenly gasped “ah” in astonishment.

“How is he?” Yuan Lang asked while also moving forward, looking at the body of their senior brother he became dumfounded.

Because looking at the body he noticed his senior brother’s flesh at that moment was red, the blood under his skin was boiling, both his eyes had burst, he was dead in the same pathetic way Nu Lang had died.

At this moment senior brother Cai was not breathing, his chest contained finger sized holes, from which red blood was flowing out.

“It’s so hot!” exclaimed the disciple who was holding the body of his senior brother as he hurried to put his corpse down.

When the body came into contact with ground, it burst open and hot blood burst out, scattering over the ground and forming a transparent blood fog.

The remaining three people were fully drenched in blood, that blood also contained a burning hot World Qi.

The three of them became horrified. They were unable to imagine how the strongest amongst them, their brother Cai, could die such a horrible death.

When did this happen? Did it happen when Kai Yang punched him?

The three people were standing in the same place looking dumb. They were looking at the ground where the body of their senior brother was lying with a horrified expression.

Four masters from the Blood Group were trying to cope with Kai Yang together, but unexpectedly instead of him it was one of them who was killed. But he was also injured by a sword and a foot kick and his arms were also severely injured, but even with all these injuries he was unexpectedly able to run away from them.
