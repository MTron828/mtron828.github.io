Yang Xue shook her head, “I’ve never heard of her.”

Yang Kai replied, “Perhaps you missed each other.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Had she not just advanced to the Eighth-Order and urgently needed to consolidate her cultivation, Luo Ting He would not have left Black Territory in such a hurry; after all, the Black Ink Clansman problem had just popped up. As a Yin-Yang Cave Heaven Ancestor, it was her bounden duty to take care of it.

When she was leaving, Yang Kai asked her to take his Third Disciple, Xu Yi, with her to the Star Boundary.

Xu Yi had cultivated in his Small Universe for many years and had a solid foundation. Now that he had achieved a certain level of competence in cultivation, it was time for him to go to the Star Boundary and enjoy the benefits of the World Tree.

If it was any later, it would be too late.

Yang Kai was unable to take him to the Star Boundary personally, so he had asked Luo Ting He to take him with her.

However, when Luo Ting He left, High Heaven Palace’s group happened to have already set out for Black Territory, so it was quite natural for them to have missed each other.

During the hundreds of years he had been away from High Heaven Palace, a large number of Open Heaven Realm Masters had appeared in the Sect. Among them, Yang Xue, Mo Xiao Qi, and Lin Yun’er had advanced straight to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. Also, the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters who had advanced previously, such as the Great Emperors, spared nothing to cultivate, owing to which, their foundation had greatly strengthened.

What’s more, because of the Good Fortune Divine Furnace, Yang Kai had reached an agreement with the Cave Heavens and Paradises that High Heaven Palace would also have the chance to enter their Small Source Worlds for training.

Almost every High Heaven Palace and Void Land Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, who entered the Small Source World, had obtained great benefits.

Coupled with the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Proprietress, Yang Kai’s forces could be said to have greatly increased.

At a large piece of land where those from the Cave Heavens and Paradises gathered, there was a huge hall where the various Ancestors were discussing official matters.

At this moment, almost every representative Ancestor from the Cave Heavens and Paradises was present, sitting or standing. There were nearly 100 of them in total.

Many Ancestors happened to be expressing their opinions at the same time, which sounded very noisy. Nonetheless, each Ancestor could clearly hear every word spoken in the hall. Some among them even began to simultaneously converse with several people.

Among them, Liu Mu’s voice was the loudest. He had come straight here after having just returned from the Chaotic Dead Territory with Yang Kai. As a member of the battle faction, he was naturally doing everything he could to persuade the Ancestors who disagreed with him.

“The Burning Light and Serene Glimmer have bestowed a technique to Yang Boy. It could be said that after obtaining that technique, it will be as easy as flipping his hand to purify the Black Ink Strength. With such a method in our grasp, we’ll be like tigers with wings! What are you old farts still so afraid of? Let’s drag that Black Ink Clansman out and fight them to the death! If we leave them alive, we will always have a hidden danger looming in the darkness!”

Many people were moved by his words, but some still insisted on their own opinions.

Liu Mu had a violent temper and couldn’t wait to beat all those who opposed him and force them into submission.

However, their worries were just and reasonable; after all, Yang Kai had only purified some weak Black Ink Disciples, and he himself was just a Sixth-Order Master. If he really ran into the Black Ink Clansman here, it was hard to say if his new technique would have any effect.

Liu Mu argued till his throat went dry, and the persistence and stubbornness of the others made him furious.

After a few more words of disagreement, Liu Mu flicked his sleeve and left.

This was not the first time this had happened. The last time they had quarreled, Liu Mu had followed Yang Kai to the Chaotic Dead Territory, so none of the Ancestors stopped him.

“A bunch of old farts!” An indignant Liu Mu looked toward the deepest part of the Black Prison as a crazed light flashed across his eyes.

[Since these people are suspicious of Yang Boy’s purification methods, they will be convinced once they see how effective it is.]

Liu Mu decided to take a huge risk; otherwise, he had no idea how long they would take to reach a decision if they continued arguing like this.

He thus flew off, his figure transforming into a streak of light as he flew toward the depths of Black Territory.

Half a day later, he easily arrived at the central part of Black Territory, where the Black Ink Clansman was imprisoned.

If he continued ahead, he would be inside the Super Array’s killing zone. Although Liu Mu was strong, he was not proficient in the Dao of Spirit Arrays, so he did not dare to rashly advance.

Now that he was here, he could clearly feel his Small Universe’s foundation being rapidly being depleted under the effect of the Super Array.

“What a damned place!” Liu Mu cursed silently. Even he wouldn’t be able to last for more than a few days in this kind of place. By then, every bit of his Small Universe’s foundation, which he had accumulated over thousands of years, would be sucked away.

For a moment, he was filled with admiration for the ancient Great Experts who had arranged this Super Array in Black Territory. In this era, even if the 108 Cave Heavens and Paradises joined forces, they might not be able to set up such a Super Array.

Staring straight ahead, Liu Mu manifested his Small Universe behind him without any hesitation and roared, “Don’t you want to escape? Here’s your chance! Come!”

His Small Universe was completely defenseless. Furthermore, his Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm aura was extremely rich. Such an aura was like the smell of blood in the sea, which could draw sharks from thousands of kilometers away, let alone the Black Ink Clansman that was so close!

Liu Mu had prepared for any unforeseen circumstances, but he hadn’t expected his opponent to act so quickly.

Before he could even finish speaking, a black light shot out from the depths of the Black Prison and crashed into his Small Universe.

It was as if the Black Ink Clansman had been waiting for his arrival.

The moment the black light fell into his Small Universe, Liu Mu noticed the true form of the black light.

Black Ink Insect!

As an Eighth-Order Ancestor of Golden Antelope Paradise, Liu Mu naturally knew what the Black Ink Insect was. He might not have seen one before, but he understood everything once it entered his Small Universe.

This was the most direct and effective way for the Black Ink Clan to transform people into Black Ink Disciples.

Liu Mu quickly withdrew his Small Universe before turning around and fleeing, his figure moving as fast as lightning. Meanwhile, the Black Ink Insect exploded inside his Small Universe and transformed into extremely pure Black Ink Essence.

As the Black Ink Essence started contaminating his Small Universe, it looked as if a drop of ink had been sprinkled onto a sheet of white paper, and this drop of black ink was rapidly spreading out.

Liu Mu’s complexion changed slightly as he realized he had overestimated his ability to resist the Black Ink Insect and had also underestimated the abilities of the Black Ink Clansman.

His original plan had to be changed slightly!

Yang Kai was discussing some matters with the Proprietress about her advancement to the Seventh-Order when Yu Ru Meng rushed over to inform him that something had happened to Liu Mu.

Yu Ru Meng pushed open the door and entered with a solemn expression, “Husband, news just came from the Cave Heavens and Paradises, something has happened to Six Wood Divine Monarch and they want you to go take a look.”

Yang Kai was slightly taken aback, “What happened to Senior Liu Mu?”

Yu Ru Meng shook her head. She had only received news from the Cave Heavens and Paradises; no one had told her what had happened.

Yang Kai quickly got up and left, meeting an Eighth-Order Ancestor who was waiting outside High Heaven Palace’s camp.

Yang Kai didn’t recognize this person, nor did he know which Cave Heaven or Paradise the man belonged to, so he simply cupped his fist and greeted the opposite party.

“Follow me!” The Eighth-Order Ancestor stated before turning around and shooting off into the void.

Yang Kai followed closely behind as the two of them quickly disappeared into the distance.

On the way over, the Eighth-Order Ancestor reported, “Liu Mu has been corrupted by the Black Ink!”

Yang Kai’s first reaction was that it was impossible. He had returned with Liu Mu from the Chaotic Dead Territory just recently. If Liu Mu had been corrupted by the Black Ink, Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan would surely have noticed it.

[Neither Big Brother Huang nor Big Sister Lan said anything, which means that when we left the Chaotic Dead Territory, Liu Mu was still perfectly fine. We didn’t encounter any Black Ink Disciples or Black Ink Strength on the way back. On top of that, Liu Mu is an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so how could he be so easily corrupted?]

The Eighth-Order Ancestor explained, “There’s no need to doubt it, you’ll understand once you see for yourself.”

Yang Kai suppressed his doubts, but worries still weighed on his heart.

Half an hour later, Yang Kai saw a Universe World sprawled out across the void up ahead. Although this Universe World was a physical entity, it was not a real Universe World, but rather the completely manifested Small Universe of a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master.

Even though he was still far away, Yang Kai could feel the aura of Liu Mu from the Small Universe.

[This should be Liu Mu’s Small Universe!]

However, what entered his eyes next caused his pupils to contract.

This Small Universe World was filled with the billowing energy of the Black Ink Essence. Its evil aura was quite apparent.

Furthermore, there were eight huge pillars over the Small Universe, nailing its eight corners in place, immobilizing it at that spot.

A figure was sitting cross-legged in the middle of the Small Universe World. It was none other than Liu Mu. He happened to be forming mysterious hand seals while chanting something. Yang Kai was too far away to hear what he was saying, but the situation was clear. Liu Mu had really been corrupted by the Black Ink!

If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, Yang Kai wouldn’t have believed it.

[How did this happen?]

Quite a few people were standing at the periphery of this Small Universe, staring at Liu Mu with solemn expressions.

Each of these figures exuded the aura of the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

Everyone turned their head upon sensing someone’s arrival, and when they saw it was Yang Kai, all of them lightly nodded at him.

Yang Kai cupped his fist and bowed before stopping just outside Liu Mu’s Small Universe. Furrowing his brow, he looked around for a moment before asking, “What happened? How did Senior Liu Mu get corrupted? Did the Black Ink Clansman make a move, or did some fish slip through the net?”

The Eighth-Order Master who led Yang Kai here shook his head as he replied, “Neither. It was Liu Mu who took the initiative to let the Black Ink Clan turn him.”

“He took the initiative himself?” Yang Kai was stunned, “Why would Senior Liu Mu do that?”

The Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master fell silent for a moment before replying, “He probably wants to prove something to us.”

Yang Kai didn’t know what Liu Mu was trying to prove, but the fact that he had taken the initiative to seek out the Black Ink Clansman was no small matter.

An Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master being transformed into a Black Ink Disciple was an extremely dangerous matter. If he were to secretly hide, who knew how many people would suffer?

Fortunately, it seemed Liu Mu had no intention of hiding.

“Although Liu Mu’s actions were somewhat rash, he should have a great deal of trust in you, which is why he did what he did. While he was still in control of himself, he used a Secret Technique to seal himself and manifest his Small Universe, explaining this scene.”
