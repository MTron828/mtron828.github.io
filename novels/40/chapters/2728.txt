Inside High Heaven Palace’s reception hall, both guests and hosts were seated.

Ji Ying’s face looked a bit displeased because Yang Kai sat at the head of the table, putting him below him.

This had never happened before. He had always been treated as the Guest of Honour in any Sect in the Northern Territory, and the head seat was always reserved for him. That was the case for his visit to Fire Dragon Palace just now as well.

If this happened at any other time, Ji Ying would not have cared too much, as a guest should suit the convenience of the host after all. No matter how noble his status was, he was still an outsider in another’s home. In any case, seating order was a mere formality, not something worth bickering over.

But he already had a preconceived impression of High Heaven Palace and Yang Kai, further strengthening his idea that Yang Kai did not show him any regard.

On the other hand, Yang Kai didn’t think about this issue at all. He was the host, so it was only natural that he should sit at the front and entertain his guests.

Turning his eyes over, he chuckled, “What a coincidence that Grandmaster Ji has arrived with two other Sect Masters.”

Ji Ying quickly said, “It was no coincidence. This Ji came with Palace Master Li and Sect Master Mi acting as escorts.”

Yang Kai was curious, “Grandmaster Ji is a highly respected man, and with Medicine Pill Valley’s renowned name in the Northern Territory, there can’t possibly be someone with no eyes who would dare to stir up trouble with Grandmaster Ji, right? I also heard that the Northern Territory was a very peaceful place.”

Li Jiao coldly snorted, “Things were indeed peaceful in the past, but recently… it has not been so.”

There were insinuations laced in his words, and there was no way Yang Kai wouldn’t notice this. Li Jiao was pointedly saying that High Heaven Palace’s founding and rise in the Northern Territory had robbed it of its tranquillity.

As if he didn’t understand the hidden meaning in these words though, Yang Kai turned to Li Xuan who was standing behind Ji Ying and smiled, “Little Brother, we meet again so soon.”

Li Xuan’s face paled and he yelped, “What… What do you want! I’m warning you, don’t mess around!”

Half of it was just pretend, but half of it was actual fear. After what he suffered at Yang Kai’s hand last time, facing him still made his heart jump.

Yang Kai snickered, “Little Brother is such a joker. It seems like this Palace Master’s hospitality was lacking last time, causing Little Brother to have some complaints. If Little Brother is free, then why not stay here as a guest for a while. This Palace Master will definitely make you feel at home!”

Li Xuan answered back angrily, “Who wants to be your guest!”

With his Honoured Master here, Li Xuan was much bolder than before and did not grovel like last time.

Zhu Qing and Hua Qing Si came over with tea at that moment and proceeded to serve everyone.

Hua Qing Si’s attitude was still acceptable, but Zhu Qing ruthlessly tossed the cups onto the table, spilling tea all over the place. Yang Kai was furious and struck the table, “What are you doing! What happened to courtesy… I’m talking to you, come back here!”

But there was no sign of Zhu Qing as she left immediately after ‘serving’ the tea.

Yang Kai shouted for a while before helplessly saying, “Grandmaster Ji, please do not blame her for her behaviour. This girl has a bit of an unruly personality. This Palace Master will certainly lecture her properly after this.”

Ji Ying was indifferent, “It’s just a small matter, don’t worry about it.”

Yang Kai smiled, “Grandmaster Ji is magnanimous. Now then, I wonder what Grandmaster Ji has come to my High Heaven Palace for?”

Mi Qi slammed the table and stood up, sneering, “Palace Master Yang, why ask when you already know the answer? Don’t you know perfectly well what you did several days ago?”

Yang Kai glanced at him from the corner of his eye, “This Palace Master is not sure what he has done to rile up Sect Master Mi. This should be our first meeting, so this Palace Master should not have any grudges with your Full Sky Sect either.”

Mi Qi grunted, “This King and Palace Master Li are here today in order to seek justice for Martial Nephew Li. Palace Master Yang, you should know that your misdeeds will catch up to you someday when you commit too many, so please be more self-aware; otherwise, you may lead your High Heaven Palace to ruin.”

Li Jiao also nodded at the side, “Brother Mi is right.”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, “So to say, the two of you have come to my High Heaven Palace to cause trouble? But I don’t even know what my High Heaven Palace has done to offend you.”

Mi Qi said, “The one you have offended is neither Brother Li nor I, but Medicine Pill Valley! Medicine Pill Valley is the Northern Territory’s holy land, so offending them is equal to offending the entire Northern Territory! As someone from the Northern Territory, naturally we can’t just stand by and do nothing!”

Yang Kai was surprised, “When have I offended Medicine Pill Valley?”

Ji Ying’s face was dark as he spat, “My poor disciple is in such a state and Palace Master Yang still wants to quibble?”

Yang Kai turned to look at him, then he swept a glance at Li Xuan’s sullen cheek, seemingly only coming to his senses then as he exclaimed, “Oh, so that’s how it is!”

Ji Ying looked expressionlessly at him, “Palace Master Yang, you’re not going to tell me that you weren’t the one who hit my disciple, are you?”

“No, that’s right, I hit him,” Yang Kai nodded and admitted it.

Ji Ying was furious, barking through gritted teeth, “Palace Master Yang is an Emperor Realm Master, yet he deems to bully the weak? Why would you humiliate my disciple like this? Do you have no regard for my Medicine Pill Valley at all?!”

“Such impudence, Yang Kai!”

“Grandmaster Ji, we must not let this matter pass, otherwise Medicine Pill Valley will be brought to shame if word were to spread!”

Li Jiao and Mi Qi both shouted angrily, as if they were the ones who were beaten and not Li Xuan. They couldn’t wait to inflame Ji Ying’s anger in order to give Yang Kai a taste of his own medicine.

“What else do you have to say for yourself?” Ji Ying looked grimly at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai raised a brow, “Should I not teach the child a lesson if he has done wrong?”

“Done wrong!” A hint of anger flashed past Ji Ying’s face, “My disciple has always been a sensible and good child. What kind of wrong has he done to deserve such a punishment from Palace Master Yang?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Yang Kai eyed Li Xuan with a smile, saying after some thought, “I wish to know exactly what your good disciple has told you, Grandmaster Ji.”

Ji Ying coldly snorted and ordered, “Xuan’er, tell me in detail what happened to you that day! Don’t be afraid, Master will stand up for you!”

“This…” Li Xuan was a little hesitant; after all, what he told Ji Ying was a pile of lies. Now that Yang Kai was here, Li Xuan really didn’t have the guts to confront him.

But if he didn’t speak now, he would look guilty, and his attempt to slander would be exposed. Knowing his Honoured Master’s temperament, Li Xuan knew he might not be forgiven for such deception if he was exposed, but if his Honoured Master was willing to believe his words, then it wouldn’t matter what he said.

With such thoughts, a cruel light flashed past Li Xuan’s eyes as he steeled himself.

“This is what happened…”

Li Xuan may not have been very old, but he was quite articulate. In his elaboration, he came to High Heaven Palace on Ji Ying’s orders to buy Spirit Herbs, yet he was stopped outside their gates and forced to wait bitterly for several days before someone finally came to ask what he wanted. After learning his purpose, he was beaten up directly. Not only was he wounded, but he was also robbed of all the Source Crystals he was given to buy spirit herbs with.

As he spoke, it was as if he was recalling what happened that day. Li Xuan’s face went pale and his body trembled, even wiping tears from his eyes, whether true or faked, filling his listeners with grief and indignation. In the end, his speech became clearer and clearer and his voice louder and louder. His back also straightened up as if what he said really happened to him.

Ji Ying’s face was getting uglier and uglier, but Mi Qi and Li Jiao were both feeling pleased inside. They knew that the worse Li Xuan’s experience was, the bigger the trouble there would be for High Heaven Palace and Yang Kai.

“Look at what you’ve done!”

Once Li Xuan finished speaking, Mi Qi immediately jumped out and pointed at Yang Kai in a rage, “The strong bullying the weak! As an Emperor Realm Master, not only did you lay hands on a Dao Source Realm Junior, you even shamelessly robbed him! You are simply a disgrace to all cultivators in our Northern Territory!”

Yang Kai ignored him and instead looked at Li Xuan with a smile, “Are you sure there’s nothing else you want to add?”

Li Xuan’s body trembled, and he quickly hid behind Ji Ying.

“Palace Master Yang, are you threatening my disciple?” Ji Ying looked coldly at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai shrugged, “It’s not a threat, just a question.”

“So, that means you’re admitting it?”

Yang Kai frowned and looked firmly at Ji Ying, “Grandmaster Ji, do you truly believe what your disciple said?”

Ji Ying snorted, “My disciple has been under my tutelage for ten years. I watched him grow up and know his nature very well. He is definitely not the type of person to make something out of nothing.”

Yang Kai shrugged again, “In that case, nothing I say would have any meaning.”

Ji Ying grunted, “Do you have a different story to tell?”

“No, no… I just think that Grandmaster Ji’s eyes are not very good when it comes to picking disciples.”

Ji Ying narrowed his eyes, “If there is anything you want to say in your defence, I can give it a listen. But if not… then this High Heaven Palace has no need to exist anymore. You must also return with me to Medicine Pill Valley to receive punishment!”

To be able to decide the fate of a top Sect with just mere words, only a Legacy Disciple of Wondrous Pill Great Emperors had such rights.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, “I am not guilty of anything!”

Ji Ying said, “Showing no regard for my Honoured Master, Wondrous Pill Great Emperor, and looking down on all the Alchemists in this world are your greatest sins!”

Yang Kai raised his voice, “If all disciples of the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor are as rotten as you are, and as cunning as Li Xuan, then this Palace Master really does not have any regard for him. And what of Medicine Pill Valley? Your so-called holy land is clearly nothing more than a cesspool of wanton wastes and degenerates!”

Ji Ying’s face changed dramatically, “Impudence!”

Yang Kai looked at him with disdain, “I’m impudent, and so what? Come and bite me if you have the ability to do so!”

“You…” Ji Ying pointed his finger at Yang Kai. He really wanted to go up and bite him to death, but despite having Second-Order Emperor Realm cultivation, he was ultimately an Alchemist. He had very little experience fighting people, so he could not take that risk.

Eyes sweeping to the side, Mi Qi and Li Jiao understood and both pushed their Emperor Qi in preparation to pounce.

At that moment, three astonishing Monster Qi auras suddenly erupted. Three figures flickered in from outside the hall, standing in front of Mi Qi and Li Jiao.

“You want to make a move? Try it if you dare!” Xi Lei cracked his fists as he looked darkly at the men before him.

Mi Qi and Li Jiao were both shocked and instantly froze in place, both feeling on edge.

Even though they knew that there were Monster Race Masters in High Heaven Palace, and that these Masters were involved in the destruction of Seeking Passion Sect, they never thought that there would actually be three Monster Kings here!

In a two against three, they had no chance of winning. Not to mention, there was still that girl called Qing’er among their ranks.

That woman was able to send Mi Qi flying with a single punch, so her strength could only be greater than these three Monster Kings!

This place was a dragon cave and tiger den all in one!

Where did High heaven Palace find all these incredible Masters? With this level of heritage, they were almost on par with a Great Emperor Sect, only lacking a Great Emperor to assume command.

Ji Ying felt chills over his body at that moment. How many years had it been since he last encountered such danger? The Monster Qi rolling over him was almost suffocating, but he was still the disciple of a Great Emperor after all and his mental strength and cultivation were not just for show. Though his expression turned grave, he did not panic.
