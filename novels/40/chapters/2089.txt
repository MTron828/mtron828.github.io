After hearing her words, Duan Yuan Shan’s expression turned blank in shock. Looking at Qin Yu, he said, “Doesn’t this mean that you don’t possess the complete Seven Points Black Tortoise Array?”

He could not help but reveal a sliver of disappointment on his face; after all, without an extraordinary Spirit Array like that, there was simply no one among the Dao Source Realm, other than those who gave no regard about their lives, who would dare intrude into the Demon Qi’s domain.

“I have an Array, but it isn’t quite the same as the original.” Qin Yu replied with a faint smile.

“What do you mean?” asked Duan Yuan Shan.

“My Qin Family’s ancestor can be considered as a rather extraordinary genius. Although he had only managed to learn a seventh of the original Spirit Array, through the frequent practice with his fellow sect brothers, he had managed to gain a certain amount of knowledge regarding the other sections of the Array. After the decimation of the Black Tortoise Sect, my ancestor fled to the Southern Territory. Spending a lot of effort in the latter half of his life, he managed to rely on his abilities and knowledge of the Spirit Array to restore the Seven Points Black Tortoise Array to its complete form. However, my ancestor also mentioned that with his abilities, the Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array that he restored was just an inferior product, and could never match up to the original version.

“What realm... did your Qin Family ancestor reach?” Duan Yuan Shan asked.

“Second-Order Emperor!” Qin Yu replied pridefully.

Duan Yuan Shan instantly sucked in a mouthful of cold air.

The Second-Order Emperor realm! Even within a great sect like the Black Tortoise Sect, he would have been considered an elite, and might even have held a position of responsibility such as a deacon.

However, despite having a powerful Second-Order Emperor cultivation realm, he was still unable to restore the Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array to its original version, showing just how profoundly strong this Spirit Array was.

“Although this isn’t the original version of the Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array, I feel that it should be more than adequate for the situation we are facing. Furthermore... it’s easier to master, and if you only focus on the defence and ignore the minor details, it should be more than enough.”

Hearing her words, Duan Yuan Shuan took a deep breath. “If that’s the case, I will need to inform Brother Qin before we proceed.”

In any case, Qin Zhao Yang was the head of the Qin Family. If they really needed to use the Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array, they would require his permission before they could use it. After all, this Spirit Array was probably the Qin Family’s greatest treasure.

If not for the desperate situation they were in, who would be willing to share a Spirit Array like this with the masses?

“Please rest assured, Uncle Duan. I’ve already informed Old Ancestor about this matter. He’s on his way here!” Qin Yu replied.

As she said those words, she seemed to sense something as she turned her head with a faint smile. “He’s here.”

With a solemn look on his face, Qin Zhao Yang flew over from the distance. Landing before Yang Kai and Duan Yuan Shan, he cupped his hands towards them.

Sparing the small talk, Duan Yuan Shan cut straight to the issue. “Brother Qin, there’s no need for me to talk anymore about the current situation; I believe that Yu’er has already told you everything. At this moment, we need to utilise your Qin Family’s Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array. Will you accede?”

“Since this matter concerns the survival of Maplewood City, it’s obviously not possible for our Qin Family to stay out of this. I agree with the matter,” Qin Zhao Yang quickly replied.

“Eh?” Duan Yuan Shan gawked in surprise to Qin Yuan Shan’s reply while a look of astonishment appeared on his face, as if he wasn’t expecting Qin Zhao Yang to reply in such a straightforward manner. All of the negotiation tactics he had prepared were now in vain.

Having quite a few interactions with Qin Zhao Yang, Duan Yuan Shan knew that he wasn’t some narrow-minded person. Nevertheless, he was also not an easy person to deal with, especially when it concerned the treasure of the Qin Family.

He had originally expected Qin Zhao Yang to come up with some excuse to avoid responsibility.

After thinking for a moment, Duan Yuan Shan gave a bitter laugh. “Brother Qin, if you have any requests, please do tell. If it isn’t too overboard, this Duan will definitely accept.”

Qin Zhao Yang grinned meaningfully and replied, “Are you treating me as an outsider, City Lord Duan? Everyone’s living together in Maplewood City. Since Maplewood City’s in trouble, our Qin Family is naturally duty-bound to provide assistance...”

“If you continue with your nonsense, there’s nothing further to discuss.”

“Since City Lord Sir’s this sincere, this old man is going to make a slightly difficult request,” A look of helplessness appeared on Qin Zhao Yang’s face, as though he was feeling the grief and misery a girl being forced into prostitution. Seeing this, Duan Yuan Shan suddenly felt the urge to give Qin Zhao Yong a good beating.

“After this disaster, this old master wants to take over all of the Jiang Family’s businesses!” Qin Zhao Yang quickly replied with a stern look on his face.

Duan Yuan Shan abruptly narrowed his eyes, “Isn’t your appetite too big, Brother Qin? Aren’t you afraid of becoming bloated?”

Other than the City Lord’s Mansion, which possessed the greatest authority and might, the Jiang Family’s forces were the most numerous among the aristocratic families in Maplewood City. Furthermore, they were also the strongest aristocratic family in Maplewood City.

With the entirety of the Jiang Family’s top forces being completely decimated by their own actions and turning into demons, all of their businesses and resources have naturally become ownerless things.

At this moment, with Maplewood City being surrounded by Demon Qi and demonic creatures, the patriarchs and old ancestors of the other aristocratic families did not have the mental capacity to spare a thought about fighting over the Jiang Family’s valuables, as they were putting in all of their effort to defend against the demonic onslaught. However, once that danger was over, they might really start to fight over it.

Anyone who was able to obtain such a large family business would be able to increase their strength within a short amount of time.

There is no such thing as an eternal enemy or friend in this world, only eternal benefits!

The businesses left behind by the Jiang Family were also coveted by the City Lord’s Mansion.

However, right now, Qin Zhao Yang was planning to devour all of them. Even though he was already prepared for Qin Zhao Yang to claim a lion’s share, Duan Yuan Shan was somewhat unable to accept this.

Without talking about his personal reluctance to agree to this request, even the various aristocratic families present in Maplewood City would not bend over and accept this.

Hearing that, Qin Zhao Yang laughed. “So what if my appetite is too big? Isn’t City Lord Duan going to protect our Qin Family from the fallout?”

“You’re even planning to get the City Lord’s Mansion involved in this?” A look of misery instantly appeared on Duan Yuan Shan’s face.

Qin Zhao Yang chuckled in response. “What are you talking about, City Lord Duan? Our Qin Family is in decline right now, so I just wish to rely on the City Lord’s Mansion’s might and fame, that’s all. In any case, without City Lord Duan’s permission, our Qin Family also won’t be able to devour these riches.”

“You old fart...” Duan Yuan Shan cursed.

“How could you say that? Being the lord of a city, don’t you understand the virtue of respecting the old and cherishing the young?” Qin Zhao Yang rolled his eyes, before turning towards Yang Kai, “Little brother Yang, Sir City Lord scolded me just now, and you’ve heard it loud and clear. This old master’s very angry, so angry that my life’s shortened by ten years! I’ll make sure to pursue this matter with him!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“You two continue chatting! I’ll take my leave first!” Seeing this, Yang Kai hastily made his exit.

These two were tearing at each other’s faces right now, and he did not want to get caught up in the mess. He was merely a passing traveller in Maplewood City...

“Haha, I’m just joking, I’m just joking...” Qin Zhao Yang grabbed Yang Kai’s arm. “Please don’t be so hasty to leave. If we really want to form the Seven Points Black Tortoise Array, we need little brother’s help to do so!”

“I’m also needed?” Yang Kai frowned.

Qin Zhao Yang smiled. “Just a moment ago, Yu’er should have mentioned it, that the Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array requires seven people to act together in order to unleash the might of the Divine Spirit, Black Tortoise. There aren’t enough Dao Source Realm masters in Maplewood City, so little brother’s assistance is naturally required.”

Yang Kai gave it a thought before nodding. “ Okay, count me in.”

He was also extremely interested in the Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array. If he could learn such an extraordinary Spirit Array, he would come out of this situation with a net gain.

Seeing Yang Kai agree, a look of delight flashed across Qin Zhao Yang’s face. Looking back at Duan Yuan Shan, he said, “City Lord Sir, there’s no problem over at this Qin’s side. However, what’s the progress in your considerations?”

A solemn look appeared on Duan Yuan Shan’s face as he quickly replied. “Brother Qin, although my City Lord’s Mansion is the number one force in Maplewood City, you should know that those few old fellows aren’t good to provoke. Your suggestion is going to piss off a lot of people...”

“Sir City Lord’s capabilities are matchless, you possess strength that towers over the masses, and have powerful connections. How can you be afraid of those few old fellows?” Qin Zhao Yang laughed in response, before shaking his head and continuing, “This old master doesn’t believe that you can’t achieve it!”

Duan Yuan Shan’s eyes narrowed before he growled, “Fine, I’ll do as you say!”

“My pleasure,” Qin Zhao Yang chuckled heartily. “Since that’s the case, I’ll need City Lord Sir to find seven people and let this old master and Yu’er teach them the formations for the Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array.”

“I’ll give you an answer after an hour!” Duan Yuan Shan quickly replied.

Qin Zhao Yang nodded and turned to shoot a look at Yang Kai, before flying off with them.

Not long after, the three of them returned to the section of the city walls that Qin Zhao Yang was in charge of defending.

A solemn look suddenly appeared on Qin Zhao Yang’s face as he handed a jade slip to Yang Kai. “Little brother Yang, please destroy this immediately after looking through and comprehending the information present within. You can consult Yu’er on anything that you’re not sure about. Although her cultivation realm is far inferior to yours, she might be able to give an explanation or two on the Dao of Spirit Arrays.”

Yang Kai’s expression immediately changed. Receiving the jade slip, he replied, “I’ve already had first-hand experience of Sister Qin’s proficiency in Spirit Array techniques.”

After saying that, he sent his Divine Sense into the jade slip. After a cursory sweep across the information, his expression changed slightly, before he raised his head to send a look of doubt towards Qin Zhao Yang. “Old Sir Qin, this is...”

The Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array required seven people to join hands in order to properly execute it. In the past, for the sake of preventing this secret Spirit Array from being shared openly with the public, the Black Tortoise Sect had only taught each disciple a portion of the Spirit Array’s formations. Only when seven people collaborated would they be able to form the complete Spirit Array.

Yang Kai had assumed that Qin Zhao Yang had given him one of the seven portions. However, after the cursory look, he discovered that the information recorded in the jade slip was actually the formation method of the complete Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array.

Obviously, this wasn’t the original version of the Spirit Array, but the one the Qin Family’s old ancestor had comprehended.

Even so, this was still one of the best Spirit Arrays.

However, Yang Kai wasn’t able to understand why Qin Zhao Yang would do such a thing.

With a smile, Qin Zhao Yang said, “You don’t have to think too much about it, Little Brother Yang. Currently, with Maplewood City facing a disaster. If we aren’t able to survive this, Maplewood City will be finished, and my Qin Family will definitely be wiped out. When that happens, the Seven Points Black Tortoise Array might get lost in the rivers of time. I’ve handed it to you in the hope that you might be able to preserve it. After all, this is something that my Qin Family’s old ancestor spent half his life to comprehend. This old master isn’t willing to let it get buried along with our Qin Family.”

“If this city can’t hold on anymore, I might not be able to escape either.” Yang Kai quickly said.

“Don’t be modest, little brother.” Qin Zhao Yang gave an ambiguous laugh. “With your capabilities, you should be able to escape Maplewood City whenever you wish. Although I don’t know why you have chosen to stay, since you’re willing to stay and defend this city, you definitely have your reasons for doing so. This old master has handed you this thing, and I only have one request.”

Yang Kai’s expression changed as he asked, “What request?”

“If Little Brother Yang really wants to leave Maplewood City, please take Yu’er along with you and ensure her safety!” Qin Zhao Yang’s expression turned into a solemn one, while his voice contained an earnest plea.
