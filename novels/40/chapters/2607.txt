As Yang Kai’s shout echoed in the hall, Tian Long and the other six maidservants all looked at each other and thought that this was useless because his Disciple had likely gone insane…

But to their surprise, a small sound suddenly came from behind a pillar right after Yang Kai finished speaking. This was followed by a dirty head peeking out from behind. The eyes were the only part that shone on this woman’s face.

“Honoured Master, what are you doing here?” It seemed as if the Third Disciple had been spooked as she hurriedly ran out from behind the pillar.

Yang Kai glared at her coldly and acted authoritatively, but soon he couldn’t help but avert his eyes as he didn’t even know where to look.

From what he saw, the Third Disciple had actually been stripped completely naked. The white parts and black patch on her body were really attention-grabbing. It had been hard to tell when she was wearing her tattered clothes, but now that she was naked, the Third Disciple’s curvaceous figure was fully exposed for him to see. Some parts of her white skin almost blinded Yang Kai’s eyes!

However, the Third Disciple didn’t feel anything was wrong at all and directly came over and stood right in front of Yang Kai with an anxious expression on her face.

“Um…” Yang Kai scratched his chin and glanced up at the ceiling as he spoke with an awkward tone, “I heard that you were playing pranks again, so your Master came to take a look.”

The Third Disciple nervously replied, “Honoured Master, don’t be angry. I was just playing with them.”

“Ha…” Yang Kai hurriedly waved his hand, “Since you’ve had your fun now, hurry and go wash up.”

“Yes!” The Third Disciple answered as her tender body flashed and landed in the giant pool, sending water splashing everywhere.

Yang Kai secretly heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that the Third Disciple’s consciousness still recognized him as her Honoured Master, which saved him a lot of trouble.

Tian Long and the other maidservants all stood to the side with strange expressions. They didn’t know what was going on between this strange Master and Disciple pairing. Since they were Master and Disciple, why was this disciple completely naked in front of her Master? Was there some type of unspeakable relationship between the two of them?

That would be against all common morality! The maidservants all felt their hearts jump as they thought about this.

“Hurry and go wash her, I’ll wait outside!” Yang Kai felt so awkward that he couldn’t even maintain his expression and immediately tried to run outside this place of controversy after he spoke.

However, Tian Long hurriedly interceded, “Sir Yang, what should we do if your Disciple becomes like that again after you leave?”

This was the same situation as before. Everything was fine when the maidservants took the Third Disciple from Yang Kai, but then the Third Disciple instantly went insane, followed by her being restored to normal when Yang Kai arrived.

Tian Long was really afraid of this happening again. The Third Disciple was a woman, after all. It wasn’t a big deal if her Master saw her body, but what if she ran outside and someone else saw her naked? That would make it hard for her to live.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow slightly as he asked helplessly, “What should we do then?”

Tian Long smiled, “Your Disciple seems to be very respectful of you. Sir Yang, how about you wait here? I doubt that your Disciple will raise a fuss again with Sir Yang present.”

Yang Kai fell silent for a while. Although he knew this wasn’t exactly for the best, he didn’t have any better ideas. He could only nod and tell Tian Long and the other maidservants to be as quick as possible.

Yang Kai sat down cross-legged with his back facing the pool, taking out two High-Rank Source Crystals as he focused on cultivating.

He soon heard the sounds of water from behind his back, along with the Third Disciple’s giggling. He couldn’t help but imagine and fantasize about various things.

It was one hour later when Yang Kai was finally woken up by the sound of ‘Honoured Master.’ He opened his eyes and saw an attractive woman standing before him. She had a brow that seemed straight out of a painting, cascading black hair, red lips, and pearl white teeth. She had incredible beauty, and perhaps because she had just bathed, her white face even contained a hint of redness that gave off an alluring light.

Her light green dress fit her perfectly and accentuated her curves exquisitely. A faint pleasant fragrance wafted in his direction.

She appeared somewhere in her late twenties, as if she was a young woman; however, this definitely wasn’t her real age. It was simply that Ice Heart Valley’s Secret Arts focused on purity and helped maintain one’s youthful appearance.

“Third Disciple?” Yang Kai arched his brow and felt truly surprised. He never expected that the Third Disciple would be so pleasing to look at after some slight clean up. Her previous dirty appearance couldn’t be seen at all.

“Honoured Master!” The Third Disciple bowed respectfully to him.

“En,” Yang Kai nodded lightly and stood up from the ground as he waved his sleeve, “Follow me.”

The Third Disciple obediently followed after him without saying a word.

Due to the previous incident, Yang Kai no longer dared to allow the Third Disciple to be alone anywhere, as he was afraid that her consciousness would become chaotic again. As long as he was in front of her to help suppress things, she would at least maintain lucidity.

Yang Kai took the Third Disciple with him back to the building he was living in. He then went to the second floor and told her to cultivate by herself before he took out the Black Jade Furnace and the various herbs he gathered previously.

He used his Emperor Qi to warm the Black Jade Furnace as his Spiritual Energy flowed in alongside it. He made use of his Conflagrated Knowledge Sea to help adjust the flames’ strength.

Yang Kai then tossed numerous herbs into the flames in an orderly fashion in order to refine medicinal liquid.

The Third Disciple kept watching blankly from the side, her mind filled with questions, but she didn’t dare to ask for fear of bothering Yang Kai.

After about an hour passed, Yang Kai suddenly made a seal with his hands.

Moments later, he slapped the Black Jade Furnace, causing the lid to fly up along with several Spirit Pills. Yang Kai caught the Spirit Pills in a jade bottle that he had previously prepared.

Yang Kai frowned slightly when he saw the quality of the Spirit Pills that he refined.

This furnace of Spirit Pills had only produced five pills. Not only were there no Pill Veins, but even the overall quality wasn’t that good.

For Yang Kai, even though he had successfully refined a furnace of Spirit Pills, this was far from the results that he desired.

Still, Yang Kai quickly understood. These were Emperor Grade Spirit Pills, after all. Although he had risen to become an Emperor Grade Alchemist long ago, he had been running around back and forth for the past several years with no time at all to quietly focus on refining pills. This made his Alchemy techniques somewhat rusty.

As long as he had enough resources to practice with, Yang Kai was confident that he was capable of creating good quality Spirit Pills.

Yang Kai put away the five Spirit Pills, cleaned out the burnt residue from the Black Jade Furnace, and began refining a new batch of pills.

Half a day later, when Yang Kai received another six Emperor Grade Spirit Pills, the Third Disciple could no longer bear just watching from the side as she asked with astonishment in her voice, “Honoured Master, when did you learn Alchemy?”

Her expression was filled with confusion and surprise, since, from what she could recall, her Honoured Master had never come into contact with the Alchemic Dao before. But, judging from the current situation, not only did her Honoured Master know Alchemy, all the pills her Master created were Emperor Grade Spirit Pills!

In other words, her Honoured Master was actually an Emperor Grade Alchemist! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

How many Emperor Grade Alchemists would there even be in the entire Star Boundary? Every single Emperor Alchemist would be an incredibly venerated existence. Only the top Sects and forces would be lucky enough to have one under their patronage.

Ice Heart Valley had previously invited an Emperor Alchemist to become their Sect’s Foreign Elder and spent many resources every year to keep them. Ice Heart Valley would satisfy all of that Foreign Elder’s requests.

But ever since her Honoured Master suddenly vanished, Ice Heart Valley weakened, and that Foreign Elder left for a better position elsewhere.

This meant that if Ice Heart Valley wanted Emperor Grade Spirit pills now, they would have to either spend a large amount of Source Crystals to purchase them, or find another Sect’s Emperor Grade Alchemist to refine pills for them. Not only was this extremely inconvenient, but the expenses were tremendous.

However, her Honoured Master was actually now an Emperor Alchemist! The Third Disciple was naturally astounded.

Hearing this, Yang Kai smiled slightly as he explained “Your Master had some opportunities during the years outside.”

“Oh,” the Third Disciple believed him as she nodded silently.

Yang Kai tossed more herbs into the pill furnace as he told her, “Third Disciple, properly focus on your cultivation. Your Master shall give you some pills when they’re done.”

“Many thanks, Honoured Master,” the Third Disciple hurriedly replied, but then furrowed her eyebrows as she inquired, “Honoured Master, why do you keep calling me Third Disciple?”

Yang Kai paused in his movements for a second, but soon he restored himself to normal, “You are my Third Disciple, so what else would I call you apart from Third Disciple?”

Yang Kai thought, [I don’t even know your name, so what else am I supposed to call you?]

The Third Disciple pouted, “Honoured Master, you always called me Yao’er before; after all, Disciple’s full name is Ji Yao.”

Yang Kai chuckled dryly, “Perhaps your Master hasn’t seen you for so long that I forgot how I used to address you. I’ll just call you Yao’er from now on then.”

Third Disciple giggled, “Honoured Master really knows how to joke around.”

“Alright, continue cultivating. Your Master is still busy, so don’t bother me.”

“Yes!”

After saying that, she really did obediently close her eyes, sit down, and begin to cultivate.

Yang Kai secretly glanced at her and inwardly sighed. It was unknown when this Ji Yao would be restored to normal, or if she would want to take revenge on him when she remembered what happened today.

Pretending to be Bing Yun and taking advantage of her was still fine, since there was a reason for it, but it likely wouldn’t be that easy to deal with the matter of seeing her completely naked, since this was about a woman’s honour.

Yang Kai felt a chill despite not being cold as he thought about what the future held, but he hurriedly focused again and continued with his Alchemy.

Time passed.

Yang Kai stayed in the Phoenix Nest Palace for about ten days, during which time he was almost always immersed in Alchemy.

Just as he previously expected, as he invested a large number of resources into practising, the Emperor Grade Spirit Pills he refined continued to improve in quality and quantity. During this time, he even produced about six Spirit Pills with Pill Veins, which was a pleasant surprise for him.

He had excellent amplitude for Alchemy, and had also once caused the advent of the Grand Alchemic Dao Tone back at Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce’s Water Moon Star. He received the teachings of Alchemy from the Heavenly Way itself and was able to catch a glimpse of the Grand Alchemic Dao.

He had a Heaven-sent advantage in Alchemy talent at this current point. When it came to this profession, only Little Senior Sister Xia Ning Chang’s Sacred Spirit Medicine Body was comparable.

He refined a large number of Spirit Pills of various types over the past ten days, but a large majority of them were auxiliaries for cultivation.

Yang Kai gave some pills to Ji Yao, secretly hoping when her sanity was fully restored in the future she would be willing to make big things small and make small things nothing out of consideration for this gift.

Ji Yao was naturally overjoyed to be ‘rewarded’ and kept thanking Yang Kai so much that he felt quite guilty, but he didn’t dare to show his feelings on his face at all.

Another five days passed. Yang Kai’s pill success rate for Emperor Grade Spirit Pills was almost perfected by this point and almost every time that he refined a batch, he would receive nine pills with their quality near the peak possible. There was also a great increase in the number of Spirit Pills that were refined with Pill Veins.

With such technique and familiarity, creating the Flesh Incarnation Pill would no longer be a problem.
