*Xiu xiu xiu...*

At the entrance to the main hall, the remaining seven people all used their own methods to rush forward. As the saying goes, those who arrive first get the best bargains; Gong Wen Shan had already rushed in, so no one remaining wanted to be left far behind.

In the blink of an eye, everyone had already rushed into the hall and were now sweeping their eyes around.

In front of everyone was a brilliant glow that was mixed with a rich aura, a clear sign that precious treasures were present and just waiting to be claimed.

*Hong long long...*

Just after everyone came in, the crack through which they entered made a muffled sound and shut.

Everyone was slightly startled, but soon they adjusted and stopped paying attention to this. Instead, they raised their eyes and swept them around the hall to inspect the situation.

As far as they could see, at the far right of the hall, there is a circular light gate. From this light gate, Space Principle fluctuations could clearly be felt, but where this portal led, no one could tell.

Three hundred metres in front of everyone, at the head of the hall, there was a high platform.

On this high platform, several items of different shapes were quietly sitting.

“This is...” After seeing the few things on the high platform, everyone was shocked and desire began filling their eyes.

There weren’t many things, only five.

A black lacquered oval shield that had dragons and phoenixes embossed on its surface and mysterious runes constantly pulsing around it.

A single cherry-sized droplet that looked like a drop of water...

A seven-coloured glowing mass that seemed like a mix between steam and water...

A pill that looked like a Spirit Pill but was clearly not...

And a fiery red coloured longan sized bead...

There were a total of five treasures, all of them placed atop the high platform and each covered by the semi-circular light curtain.

Everyone’s eyes swept over the five treasures one by one before finally landing on a sixth semicircular light curtain that was... empty. Clearly, something had been here before, but now it was gone.

In other words, there were originally six treasures on this high platform, but at this moment, only five were left. It was a complete mystery where this last treasure had gone.

*Gump...*

Kong Qi gulped hard as he stared at the dark oval shield and said grimly, “This is a Pseudo-Emperor Artifact, right? I can feel traces of Emperor Pressure from it!”

Everyone was equally stunned to see such treasures hidden in the depths of the Flowing Time Temple. For a moment, everyone’s enthusiasm grew to new heights as they stared at these five treasures, all of them barely able to hold themselves back.

Although all of them wanted to rush up and seize these treasures, no one dared to move.

Because everyone knew that since there were eight people here, and only five treasures, which was clearly not enough for everyone, once someone made the first move, they would likely become everyone’s target. When two fists can’t block four strikes, the first person to stick out would likely be eliminated.

Even someone as strong and arrogant as Luo Yuan had to suppress himself while constantly monitoring the others around him.

“Your Highness, you are very knowledgeable. Do you know what these are?” Gong Wen Shan asked as he turned to Lan Xun suddenly.

Lan Xun’s beautiful eyes filled with a kind of soft brilliance as she smiled and said, “I recognize a few...”

“Please enlighten us, Your Highness!” Gong Wen Shan said sincerely.

Lan Xun lightly nodded before pointing to the dark oval shield and saying, “Brother Kong is right, this is probably a Pseudo-Emperor Artifact.”

“Pseudo-Emperor Artifact, what’s that?” Yang Kai asked without any hesitation.

As soon as he said this, everyone cast him a weird look, seemingly wondering why he didn’t even know something so obvious.

Bian Yu Qing was the only one who understood why Yang Kai was so ignorant and uninformed him; after all, she knew he was from a low-level Star Field, so she took the initiative to kindly explain, “Not all Emperor Artifacts are refined as Emperor Artifacts. You should know this, yes?”

Yang Kai nodded lightly. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Most Emperor Artifacts were not originally refined as Emperor Artifacts and instead were the result of artifacts being nurtured for many years by powerful cultivators. When such a cultivator broke through to the Emperor Realm, they could use their own comprehensions of the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao to infuse Emperor Intent into such an artifact and possibly refine it into an Emperor Artifact.

“Some Emperors are unable to succeed when they temper their own artifacts. There are various reasons for this, but that doesn’t mean that the artifact’s power is completely lost; in fact, most often these artifacts receive a significant increase in power. Artifacts refined under such circumstances are known as Pseudo-Emperor Artifacts, surpassing the level of a Dao Source Grade artifact, but failing to reach the Emperor Grade. They are semi-finished products!” Bian Yu Qing said softly with a solemn expression, “Excellent Pseudo-Emperor Artifacts are not inferior to the ordinary Emperor Artifacts, while some Pseudo-Emperor Artifacts are only slightly better than Dao Source Grade.”

“So that’s how it is!” Yang Kai nodded in understanding.

Bian Yu Qing continued, “But... this is a defensive artifact, so even if it’s only a Pseudo-Emperor Artifact, it is still a rare treasure! This shield’s value is certainly far greater than an ordinary Dao Source Grade High-Rank artifact! If someone can obtain this shield and refine it, most likely no one below the Emperor Realm will be able to break their defences!”

“It really sounds like a treasure!” Yang Kai echoed as his gaze became slightly hotter.

Although Yang Kai already had a large number of Emperor Artifacts, none of them were defensive types. If he could obtain this shield, he could make up for his own shortcomings and when he encountered a strong enemy, he would be able to resist for a while longer.

“Your Highness, please continue!” Kong Qi glared at Yang Kai from the side, seemingly blaming him for his ignorance for interfering with Lan Xun’s explanation.

Lan Xun didn’t mind, however, and simply smiled and pointed to the cherry-sized drop of water, “If I am not mistaken, this should be a drop of the legendary Supreme Divine Water!”

*Si...*

A sharp breath sounded as everyone reacted in shock.

“As I had guessed, it really is the Supreme Divine Water...” Gong Wen Shan’s expression flickered as he seemingly had such a guess before but was uncertain. Hearing Lan Xun’s words, he was able to confirm his speculations.

Murong Xiao Xiao was also shocked as she muttered, “The Supreme Divine Water which allows spirit herbs to rapidly mature with just a single drop?”

“Indeed!” Lan Xun smiled and nodded, possibly showing consideration for Yang Kai again as she took the initiative to explain, “With a drop of Supreme Divine Water, one can increase the maturity of any spirit grass or spirit medicines by thousands, if not ten thousand years in just a single month.”

Yang Kai gulped hard as he asked, “What Princess means to say is that... as long as this drop is sprinkled onto a spirit grass or medicine, that spirit medicine’s medicinal age will reach ten thousand years in just a single month?”

“Exactly!” Lan Xun nodded and said lightly, “Although Supreme Divine Water is not among the Three Great Divine Waters, in terms of efficacy and function, it is sometimes much more precious than them. When I was young, I was fortunate enough to see a few drops of Supreme Divine Water, which is why I can recognize it now.”

If someone else had said that they saw a few drops of Supreme Divine Water when they were a child, others might be sceptical, but coming from Lan Xun, the story was different. With her status and background, she would certainly not tell such a boring lie. If she said she had seen it before, it was basically certain she had.

Yang Kai’s heart rate suddenly accelerated.

With so much Heavy Earth in the medicine garden inside his Sealed World Bead, herbs would mature a hundred times faster than normal. So after one year, herbs planted in it would have medicinal ages of a hundred years.

However, this drop of Supreme Divine Water could actually increase the medicinal age of a spirit medicine to ten thousand years in a month!

The gap was clear and obvious...

If this drop of Supreme Divine Water could be absorbed by the gold and silver tree, wouldn’t its sealing power also increase many times over? With so much sealing power, Yang Kai could lift the seal on his dantian anytime or anywhere to fight powerful enemies without worry.

At that time, he would only need to re-seal the Demon Qi and Demon Spirit with the power of the Firmament Tree.

“Supreme Divine Water is the source of all spirit waters, so its role is not just that. For a cultivator who cultivates Water Attribute Secret Arts or who possesses a Water Attribute Special Constitution, the benefits are incalculable, and... it can also be refined into a Water Attribute artifact. It has endless uses!” Lan Xun continued her explanation.

Gong Wen Shan breathed out slowly as he cupped his fists and said, “Many thanks for sharing your wisdom, Your Highness!”

“Hmph, the Princess is explaining to you out of pure goodwill, there’s no need for you to offer pointless flattery!” Xiao Chen snorted coldly from the side.

No one paid any attention to him...

Lan Xun pointed to the seven coloured flowing light treasure and said, “I don’t believe I need to say anything about this. Doesn’t everyone already recognize it?”

Kong Qi’s brow twitched as he said roughly, “It’s an Emperor Aura...”

“It’s definitely an Emperor Aura!” Gong Wen Shan seemed to also know what it was and said solemnly.

Lan Xun smiled lightly and nodded, “Yes, this is an Emperor Aura! If one possesses it, they can integrate it into their own precious artifact, and there is a good chance an Emperor Artifact will be born with time!”

Emperor Auras were the key to refining Emperor Artifacts. An Emperor only needed to merge this Emperor Aura with their own artifact and if everything went well, they would obtain a new Emperor Artifact. Even if something went wrong, a Pseudo-Emperor Artifact would at least be created!

Generally, when an Emperor Realm Master wanted to refine their artifact into an Emperor Artifact, they would directly pour their own Emperor Intent into it. Emperor Auras, which contained the essence of an Emperor Realm Master’s Emperor Intent, were rarely created.

Emperor Auras could not be condensed into a physical entity outside an Emperor’s body by ordinary Emperor Realm Masters. Even someone as strong as Xiao Chen’s father, the Silver Star Envoy Xiao Yu Yang, did not have such ability.

Only a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master could achieve this!

Condensing an Emperor Aura would result in a great loss to any Emperor Realm Master, one that would take hundreds of years of hard cultivation to make up for. Therefore, under normal circumstances, no Third-Order Emperor would condense an Emperor Aura and place it outside.

But this Flowing Time Temple actually had one such treasure!

There was a fundamental difference between this thing and the pitch-black shield. The black shield was already fully formed, and as a Pseudo-Emperor Artifact, there was no possibility for it to be further refined into an Emperor Artifact. However, this Emperor Aura represented infinite possibilities, all that was required was time, effort, and luck. It was really quite difficult to judge which of these two was more valuable.

If one preferred immediate worth, they would choose the dark shield; after all, a defensive Pseudo-Emperor Artifact was extremely precious and valuable.

If one had the ambition to refine their own Emperor Artifact, however, they would undoubtedly prefer the Emperor Aura.
