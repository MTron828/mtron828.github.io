Settling on their course of action, senior brother Xie suddenly turned towards Yuan Lang: “Senior brother Yuan, just as Kai Yang was leaving, he seemed to have taken out something. Do you know what that thing may be?”

Surprised, Yuan Lang smiled: “Junior brother Xie really observes things down to the smallest detail.”

As he said this, he also opened up his hand to reveal a small bottle within the palm of his hand. “It should have been a bottle of pills.”

“May I take a look?” Junior brother Xie asked, as he smiled slightly. Kai Yang and that female both possessed high levelled artifacts, so their statuses weren’t ordinary. When that bottle had accidentally fallen out, Kai Yang clearly showed his reluctance to part with it. Any reluctance on Kai Yang’s part hinted that these pills would be worth quite a decent amount.

Due to this, junior brother Xie didn’t want Yuan Lang to hog all the benefits. Since all of them had participated in the battle, naturally they should all receive their share.

“You can!” Yuan Lang knew what his junior brother Xie was thinking, so he wouldn’t try to monopolize this spoil of war. Replying, he opened the bottle up to look inside. Upon looking inside, he let out a cry of bewilderment.

“I think they are Yang attributed pills!” Traces of happiness could be seen on Yuan Lang’s face.

Junior brother Xie and junior brother Wu became excited: “Are you serious?”

“Once you see you’ll understand.” Saying this, he tipped out some of the pills and gave them to the other two disciples.

“They really are Yang attributed pills!” That junior brother Wu became really ecstatic. As he held the pill within his hand, he immediately felt the chilling cold disperse around him by a lot. It even reached the point that he no longer needed to waste World Qi to restrict the invasion of the Yin Qi into his body. This pill was the ultimate nemesis of the Yin Qi within the valley.

No wonder Kai Yang wasn’t willing to part with them. In this type of evil environment, the most important thing was Yang attributed pills. Once he lost this advantage of his, he would definitely regret it.

Shaking the bottle a bit, Yuan Lang announced: “Since we have shared the pills between us already, my junior brothers, there may even be some profound mysterious hidden within them. So you shouldn’t just eat them to defend against the cold. On that note, I shall take my leave.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Afterall, this was something that Kai Yang had left behind. What if there was poison inside? Although they weren’t as calculating as their senior brother Cai, they still weren’t stupid enough to eat something their enemy left behind.

Finishing his warning, Yuan Lang flourished his arms and disappeared.

Shortly afterwards, both people stashed the pills within their bosoms and each went their respective ways to search for Kai Yang.

Kai Yang was licking his wounds, stealthily hiding in the dense foliage at the top of a tree. Suppressing his presence as much as he could, he surveyed the surrounding area.

His current situation wasn’t very good. After the large battle with the five disciples from Storm House, his body had suffered some wounds. Coupled with the ferocious attack from the four Blood Group disciples, his injuries had become even more severe.

The most serious one was probably the sword cut on his shoulder; it should have reached his bones. This caused Kai Yang’s left arm to feel weak and it numbed his sense of touch.

In order to avoid being followed by those remaining disciples from the Blood Group, Kai Yang had used his Yang Liquid to burn his injuries, cauterizing the wounds and preventing further bleeding.

Even though willpower and special methods allowed him to stay in peak condition, at the end of the day, he was still only an initial element fourth stage practitioner. Under the stress of numerous large battles, his stamina and mental energy had been greatly sapped. If it weren’t for his immense willpower, he would have long since collapsed.

Recalling the savage battle that had occurred, Kai Yang couldn’t help but let out a grim chuckle.

That senior brother Cai was worthy of being a powerhouse at the separation and reunion boundary. Even if more than half of his strength had been sealed away, Kai Yang still had to expend ten drops of Yang Liquid in order to break his defences and deliver a fatal blow.

But this was all worth it! Although using ten drops of Yang Liquid was challenging, it was still worth it! It had allowed him to take the life of a separation and reunion boundary master.

In this tense environment, Kai Yang’s mind was as clear as ever. He knew that if he lost even one fight, not only would he lose his life, but Xia Ning Chang would also lose her life.

With such great stakes, how could Kai Yang dare to relax for even a moment?

In the Blood Group, apart from Long Hui and that extremely high levelled person, there were only three people left. But their cultivations weren’t as high as senior Cai’s had been. If it were one on one, Kia Yang had nothing to fear, but if they teamed up, then things would take a turn for the worse.

Know yourself, know thy enemy, only then will you emerge victorious in every battle! Kai Yang must know the three’s plan of attack and their location. Only then would he have a chance of winning.

(TLN: This is one of the more famous [I guess] From Sun-Tzu’s Art of War. If you like Xianxia and Wuxia, you should try reading it. “War is a grave affair of state.”)

That’s why before he left, he purposely left one of his pill bottles behind. You could say that one of the more important goals of that battle was to leave behind that pill bottle, the other being to kill the disciple called Cai. Both goals were completed without a single hitch.

The discarded bottle contained, Black Yang Blood Pills. Just a few days prior, he had found some Black Yang Blood flowers, they had then been refined by Xia Ning Chang.

At the time, his dantian still had plenty of Yang Liquid, and they were hurrying on their way to the valley so Kai Yang didn’t take any. Unexpectedly, they had come in handy at such a time.

Sometimes, even if one didn’t eat the pills, they would be unable to evade trouble. This time, Kai Yang was going to teach them that even if they had placed the pills within their clothes, trouble could still appear.

He believed that his plan would succeed. Afterall, this was the gathering place of the Nine Yin Dew Crystals, a place Yin Qi was naturally attracted to. So if Yang attributed pills were to suddenly appear, it wouldn’t be hard to imagine what one would do with them.

So long as they kept the Black Yang Blood Pills on them, he could use the Origin of Yang to probe his surroundings and sense for their whereabouts. Because of this, all of their movements were within the palm of his hand.

After waiting for a while, the Origin of Yang within his chest area started to have a reaction. Kai Yang’s expression became cold, he immediately took a few deep breaths and tried to calm his rising heart rate.

Before long, someone had appeared below a nearby tree. Looking down, Kai Yang’s brow wrinkled.

How come there was only one person?

Waiting a bit longer, in a nearby place, someone else hurriedly rushed over.

Following that, a third person arrived at the place that Kai Yang was hiding. Looking down, Kai Yang found out that it was actually the Blood Group disciple with the lowest cultivation.

This person looked around in all directions before scurrying off again.

‘Strange, why did these three people separate?’ His brows wrinkling, Kai Yang couldn’t think of a reason for them doing so.

Unbeknownst to him, those three were treating him like an arrow at the end of its flight. Moreover, since they believed he possessed a high levelled weapon-type artifact, they wanted to test out their like luck and see who would obtain it.

It was no wonder those three would think like that. If it were any other initial element staged practitioner, the amount of World Qi within their bodies wouldn’t be a lot. So after that battle, with the exhaustion of large amounts of World Qi, one shouldn’t have much left. But Kai Yang wasn’t the same. The amount of World Qi he possessed was far more than ordinary practitioners.

Not to mention the amount of Yang Liquid he had stored within his dantian! Before he had left, he had stored a forty complete drops of Yang Liquid. So even if he used up the Qi within his meridians, it didn’t matter because one drop was enough to replenish all of his World Qi. Allowing him to once again become as ferocious as a tiger.

In other words, as long as he had Yang Liquid in reserve and his mental and physical strength could keep up, Kia Yang would be an untiring battle robot.

If that senior brother Cai was still alive, given his cautious nature, he wouldn’t allow his group to separate and give Kai Yang a chance to retaliate. But previously, with his serious wounds, Kai Yang had killed him, leaving Yuan Lang in command. Naturally Yuan Lang wouldn’t think that deeply.

Although Kai Yang couldn’t figure the reason why they had split up, the current situation was far better than the one he had imagined. So how would he grasp this opportunity?

p.s. 2/3 of three. Thanks for all the suuuuppppooorrrrtttttt
