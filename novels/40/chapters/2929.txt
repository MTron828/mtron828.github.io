The scene of nearly ten Emperor Realm Masters joining forces, including several Second-Order Emperors, was spectacular. The light from all the Secret Techniques and Divine Abilities was dazzling, and the might of their Emperor Artifacts were unbridled, throwing the surrounding World Energy into chaos.

Feng Ming also reacted in time and a light burst forth from his Flying Thunder Spear, exploding directly in front of him.

All of their attacks poured into that huge mouth, but it was just like a stone sinking into the sea, causing no reaction at all.

Mouth closing, the little puppy swallowed Feng Ming into its belly.

*Si…*

There were sounds of people gasping, and everyone could feel their scalp tingling as they looked at the little beast with shocked faces. Their eyes had gone so wide that they were nearly coming out of their heads.

Yang Kai was also stunned.

He had seen that little puppy twice before. The first time was when all the Elders of Azure Sun Temple had gotten drunk, and the second was while he was arranging his hidden Space Array. Other than the fact that the Demon Qi inside his dantian moved a little the second time he saw it, there was nothing else special about this puppy.

But now, he realized he was clearly mistaken.

This little puppy had likely inherited the bloodline of some exotic ancient beast. Otherwise, it couldn’t have such a strange ability. It managed to swallow a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master in one gulp, and even if Feng Ming had underestimated his opponent and been caught off guard, this was still a shocking development.

After swallowing Feng Ming, that gigantic mouth disappeared, and the little puppy went back to its original size; however, it still retained a violent and aggressive stance.

With what happened to Feng Ming as a precedent, how could the others dare to step forward so easily? Every Emperor present fell back while using their long-range Divine Abilities to attack.

The giant mouth appeared again, swallowing the attacks of the many Emperor Realm Masters. The giant mouth was just like a bottomless pit swallowing up everything cleanly no matter how many things were thrown into it.

Gong Yue remained hiding behind the black puppy, constantly forming seals with his hands, seemingly commanding the beast to fight with his enemies. Despite facing off against so many Masters, Gong Yue didn’t fall into a disadvantage in the slightest.

There were several times when Yang Kai thought of teleporting to Gong Yue’s position and catching him that way, but Gong Yue seemed to have anticipated his plans in advance and stopped him.

The Divine Sense of all the Emperor Realm Masters surged, but even after some quick exchanges, nobody was able to figure out what sort of bloodline this little black puppy had inherited. Its ability to devour everything was unheard of, and nobody dared to take any risks on an untrodden path lest they end up in the same situation as Feng Ming.

There indeed existed many powerful beasts in ancient times, among them many Divine Spirits who were the strongest of all. Each of these Divine Spirits had the ability to move mountains and overturn the seas, but no one here had heard of an ability as strange as the one this black puppy presented.

During the midst of the battle, a thought flashed across Yang Kai’s mind as he muttered, “A Demon Beast?”

Gong Yue, who had been sitting behind the black puppy and using it as a shield, smirked, “You really are different from the rest. You know quite a lot. Indeed, this little beast carries a faint bloodline of the Abyssal Returner. It’s neither pure nor rich, but it is still an astonishing coincidence. If you wish to kill this Old Master, then you must pass it first.”

“Abyssal Returner?”

The Emperor Realm Masters were all somewhat taken aback as none of them had ever heard of such a beast before. Even Elder Chen Qian, who was most familiar with the history books, came up empty.

But undeniably, this black puppy with its trace of Abyssal Returner bloodline was Heaven-defyingly strong. Under Gong Yue’s command, it was able to literally take a bite out of the Void each time it snapped its jaws. The entire world was just like a delicious cake in front of it, and each bite left a mark that was unable to heal even after a long time.

After several attempts to fight the puppy, Spirit Sword Peak was filled with Void Tears. Everywhere you looked, it was as if numerous inkblots were accidentally spilled over a beautiful landscape painting. Each one of those holes exuded a chaotic aura of nothingness which, while seemingly empty, held a great deal of lethality, so everyone had to mind their surroundings so as not to fall into danger.

Only Yang Kai moved freely like a fish swimming in water. Through the field of Void Tears, he leapt about while looking for opportunities to get by the Abyssal Returner and attack Gong Yue directly. There were several times where he nearly succeeded, but the Abyssal Returner would always snap right back at him, forcing him to temporarily retreat.

“We can’t delay this any longer. I’m worried Brother Feng won’t hold out.” Chen Wen Hao shouted and declared with a solemn expression, “The moon waxes only to wane, and the water surges only to overflow! Everyone, please lend me your power!”

At the end of his sentence, a dazzling light suddenly emitted from his Flowing Water Sword. As his Emperor Pressure spread out, it was as if his whole person had become an all-conquering sword, radiating a stinging Sword Intent.

The World Energy within a radius of a few dozen kilometres all began to gather towards the Flowing Water Sword.

Everyone’s eyes lit up at his words, and prepared their own skills.

Gong Yue’s brow wrinkled slightly, but his hands kept moving.

With nearly ten Emperor Realm Masters exerting their full strength, it was as if the entire Azure Sun Temple was thrown into turmoil. With Spirit Sword Peak as its centre, it felt like a huge vortex had appeared in the area, drawing in all the World Energy within a thousand kilometres radius. All sorts of fierce and surging Divine Abilities were brewing and taking shape.

“Endless Sword Dao!” Chen Wen Hao was the first to strike. As his Flowing Water Sword cut towards the front, it brought with it a storm of World Energy that was visible to the naked eye. Within that huge wave, countless sword lights were constantly devouring and spitting out everything in its path, seemingly able to destroy all in its way.

“Life or Death Seal, One Seal to Discern Life or Death!”

“Nine Sun’s Radiant Shine!”

“Yin Yang Inversion, Shatter the Universe!”

“Time Flows on Infinitely, Like a Mighty Stream, Like an Unending Dream!”

…

Many Divine Abilities shot out together, causing the sky to shatter and the world to invert, speeding forward in a rumble. With so many Emperor Realm Masters working together, even a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master would have their corpse ripped into ten thousand pieces if they tried to obstruct them.

Gong Yue’s expression turned solemn as the seals on his hands changed even faster.

There was a roar that shook the world. The Abyssal Returner’s body remained unchanged, but its mouth suddenly opened larger than all the previous times. It now seemed big enough to swallow half a mountain, and the darkness it displayed seemed as if it was connected to another world.

When their powerful attacks landed in its mouth, a ripple that was visible to the naked eye splashed out, but those soon disappeared.

In just three breaths, the Abyssal Returner swallowed up all of their attacks and closed its mouth at once. Its third-of-a-metre long body was now swaying in mid-air as if it were drunk, and its body was giving off an unstable glow.

The hearts of the nearly ten Emperor Realm Masters sank dramatically as all their faces turned ugly. Even Chen Wen Hao’s confidence was very shaken.

He asked everyone to join hands in hopes that he could use this method to swell the Abyssal Returner to bursting, but just as he said, the moon waxes only to wane, and the water surges only to overflow. Even though the Abyssal Returner’s ability to seemingly devour all creation was profound and mysterious, there had to be a limit. As long as it reached that limit, they would be able to defeat it.

But this time, even under their joint efforts, they failed to do anything to it, which was far from his expectations.

“Again! It can’t hold out any longer!” Yang Kai’s shout suddenly rang out in everyone’s ears.

As if they had all found their courage, the Masters once again raised their spirits and sent out their Divine Abilities.

A few moments later, there was a rumble. The Abyssal Returner opened its mouth wide again, but things were a little different this time. The Abyssal Returner seemed to be showing an extremely pained expression, a discovery that excited everyone. They felt that they were not far away from victory.

And as expected, when the Abyssal Returner opened its mouth this time, it was unable to swallow all the attacks. After absorbing half of them, it suddenly shut its mouth, and the rest of the attacks brushed past its body, the furious force of it cutting it into a bloody mess and leaving not a single part unharmed.

Its physical body did not seem to be that strong. It was only its special Innate Divine Ability that was tricky to deal with.

It staggered with its mouth tightly closed. Its stomach was constantly squirming as if something was brewing inside of it.

“It would be impolite if I did not reciprocate, so you should take this Old Master’s moves too!” Gong Yue said with a profound smile on his face. Then, he extended his right hand in front of his chest. Interlocking his thumb and ring finger, his other three fingers pointing up. As he spoke, he moved his wrist forward.

Everyone was greatly alarmed as an aura of death had inexplicably enveloped them. This type of feeling sent chills through many of them, making their hands and feet go cold.

The Abyssal Returner suddenly opened its mouth, and a dazzling light spewed out from its maw with a familiar aura.

“This…” Chen Wen Hao exclaimed with a stunned expression of horror.

What the Abyssal Returner spat out turned out to be the Divine Abilities that they cast before. Only this time, the target was not the enemy, but them.

Nobody expected the Abyssal Returner to have such a strange ability. Not only could it swallow a person’s attacks, but it could also spit them back out intact.

The group was instantly thrown into misfortune.

For the sake of ending the battle quickly, the Emperors had used their most powerful Divine Abilities, unleashing them without reservation. All of a sudden, though, their attacks had become a sharp weapon in the enemy’s hands, and the sudden change in the situation put everyone at a loss.

The swarm of attacks came so suddenly that nobody could react. All of them could only hastily gather their Emperor Qi to protect themselves.

At the critical moment, Yang Kai flew forward and instantly arrived above the group, Space Principles fluctuating as he slammed down a palm.

Without any warning, he and the other Emperor Realm Masters suddenly disappeared without a trace.

The powerful Divine Abilities hit nothing but air, collapsing space as they flew forward before crashing into the big and small mountain peaks in the distance. The entire Azure Sun Temple was shaken by the impact and everyone began to panic. Countless disciples were looking in worry towards the collapsed peaks, not knowing what had happened.

They had never encountered anything like this since the founding of the temple.

Thousands of metres away, some figures suddenly appeared from the Void. It was Yang Kai and the others, each of them with a look of lingering fear on their faces. Yang Kai was also pale-faced and trembling violently.

The amount of energy consumed when he tried to forcibly use his Space Principles on the others without their cooperation was immense, especially with this many Masters. This single move emptied his reserves entirely.

Currently, it took all his energy to even stand.

“Instantaneous movement!” Gong Yue’s gaze turned dark. He turned his head towards the distance and his face was twitching slightly, hatred filling his eyes. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He was obviously blaming Yang Kai for ruining his good deed. If Yang Kai had not interfered just now, then that sudden attack would have been enough to kill or injure at least half of the Emperor Realm Masters present.

But due to Yang Kai’s presence, that group was able to escape this crisis unscathed.
