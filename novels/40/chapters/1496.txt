Chapter 1496, Pure Spirit Qi

After a few days, Yang Kai had some gains; artifacts, pills, Secret Arts, Secret Techniques, and more.

However, compared to his trip to the Emperor Garden, this kind of harvest could only be described as pitiful, not giving Yang Kai the slightest satisfaction.

Still, it was better than nothing. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

One day though, after entering the depths of a particular palace, he did not leave for several days. The Heaven Battling Union and Thunder Typhoon Sect cultivators who had been monitoring his activities were at a loss seeing this, not understanding what Yang Kai had found or encountered.

Inside that palace, in a certain hidden underground room, Yang Kai was sitting cross-legged, circulating his Secret Art to absorb the nearby World Energy greedily.

In this hidden secret room, the World Energy aura was so dense it was visible to the naked eye, and there were even wisps of white silk threads lingering about. As Yang Kai breathed in, these pure white silk threads seemed to be attracted to him and quickly poured into his body.

As time passed, the number of these silk threads slowly decreased.

Pure Spirit Qi!

Yang Kai had never expected to have such an encounter in this place.

It was rumoured that there was a unique form of World Energy that could be directly absorbed by cultivators without the need to refine it with a Secret Art, instantly enhancing the cultivation realm and strength of the cultivator.

This was Pure Spirit Qi, and it had an indescribable effect on any cultivator, providing countless times more benefits than cultivating in the highest quality Earth Vein.

But Pure Spirit Qi was extremely rare and difficult to find. Even if it did manage to form in this world, it would quickly disperse and simply become part of the ambient World Energy unless it was specially stored.

This Ancient Sect Ruin was located above an excellent quality Earth Vein, and occasionally one or two strands of Pure Spirit Qi would be formed from it. This secret underground room was equipped with many profound Spirit Arrays that Yang Kai could not decipher, but there was a good chance they were explicitly designed to trap and preserve this Pure Spirit Qi.

One or two years of accumulation would not result in anything noticeable, and even the gathering of a hundred, or a thousand years would still be quite thin.

However, the accumulation of ten thousand years was quite shocking.

When Yang Kai opened the door of this room, he almost thought he saw an illusion as the Pure Spirit Qi inside had become so dense it was nearly solidified and tangible.

This unexpected discovery greatly excited Yang Kai, and after figuring out that this was really the rumoured Pure Spirit Qi, how could he hesitate? Closing the door to this secret room, Yang Kai immediately sat down and began to absorb everything he could.

Generally speaking, this kind of secret room where Pure Spirit Qi was being accumulated would only be opened once every few hundred years and was not meant for general cultivation. After all, although Pure Spirit Qi was extremely rare and valuable, it was simply too potent to increase one’s strength with.

It was mainly used to allow a cultivator who had encountered a bottleneck to break through.

Good steel was required to forge a quality blade.

When a cultivator broke through, the stronger the surrounding World Energy, the easier time they would have, and with Pure Spirit Qi as a catalyst, any cultivator could increase their chances and reduce the risk of breaking through.

But right now, this precious existence was being inhaled, strengthening his cultivation little by little. It was not an exaggeration to say that so much potent Pure Spirit Qi was enough to support the breakthrough of hundreds of cultivators.

It only took Yang Kai three days to absorb seventy percent of the Pure Spirit Qi in this room.

His own Saint Qi had become more and more powerful, and his realm had risen steadily to the peak of the First-Order Origin Realm!

However, at this moment, Yang Kai vaguely felt a layer of shackles impeding his progress, a bottleneck of sorts.

If it were any other cultivator, once they encountered this kind of impediment, they would need to calm their mind and spend time comprehending the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao, spending a great deal of time to break through this bottleneck.

But Yang Kai was different. He had absorbed the Soul Remnants of many cultivators in realms higher than his own, so his comprehension of the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao far exceeded his own realm. All he lacked at this moment was a certain degree of mental tempering.

Yet as long as he was willing, Yang Kai could still force himself to break through and arrive at the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm!

Yang Kai was not so eager for quick success though.

It hadn’t been long since he broke through to the First-Order Origin Returning Realm. Although Yang Kai had successfully condensed his Shi with the help of the Emperor Pressure emanating from the Emperor Garden, if he were to break through again so quickly, it would very likely cause some hidden dangers.

So, after pondering for a moment, Yang Kai decided against refining the remaining Pure Spirit Qi; nevertheless, just leaving it here would be too wasteful. After considering for a while, Yang Kai took out his communication artifact and poured his Divine Sense into it, wanting to contact Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu.

He planned to let the two of them absorb the remaining Pure Spirit Qi.

But to Yang Kai’s disappointment, Qian Tong did not respond!

This was somewhat strange. Although this Ancient Sect Ruin was not small, it wasn’t so big that these communication artifacts couldn’t reach each other. What happened to Qian Tong? Why did he respond to his message?

This development was not too surprising, though. Since this was the ruins of an Ancient Sect, there would no doubt be some locations that were isolated from the outside world. Perhaps Qian Tong was current inside some kind of shielded building.

Unable to contact Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, and unable to bear just leaving this valuable Pure Spirit Qi behind, Yang Kai scratched his head for a while, uncertain of what to do.

However, after a while, his eyes lit up as he thought of an idea. Waving his hand, a fiery red light flew out of his body, spread its wings out, and transformed into a strange-looking bird.

Firebird Artifact Spirit!

Although it had no physical form, it possessed a high degree of sentience, so it shouldn’t be a problem for it to absorb the Pure Spirit Qi here; after all, it was even capable of refining the Sun’s True Fire.

Sure enough, after the Firebird flew out, it immediately cried out happily, opened its beak wide, and began sucking away the Pure Spirit Qi like a great whale.

The number of pure white silk threads of Pure Spirit Qi decreased at a rate visible to the naked eye.

.....

Outside the palace, more than twenty Origin Returning Realm masters from Heaven Battling Union and Thunder Typhoon Sect had gathered.

This place was quiet and remote, making it a perfect location for them to act without worrying about being seen by outsiders.

Although using such a luxurious lineup to deal with a First-Order Origin Returning Realm felt like overkill, since the other party was skilled in the use of Space Force, Qu Zheng and Fang Peng did not dare act carelessly.

Now there is only one problem, one that left them all at a loss.

Yang Kai would not come out!

They were regularly using their Divine Senses to explore the inside of the palace, but they couldn’t detect his aura. However, according to a report from a master from Heaven Battling Union, he had seen Yang Kai enter this palace with his own eyes.

“Brother Qu, the little brat hasn’t run, has he?” Fang Peng asked impatiently.

“Brother Fang wouldn’t be questioning how this Qu handles his subordinates?” Qu Zheng asked in annoyance; he too wished he could rush inside and personally drag Yang Kai out.

“This Fang didn’t have such intentions, but Brother Qu also knows that little brat cultivates Space Force. Perhaps he noticed someone was watching him and quietly escaped,” Fang Peng frowned.

“Brother Fang’s worries too much. Although Deacon Jia is only a Second-Order Origin Realm cultivator, he has a unique concealment technique. If he wants to conceal himself to monitor someone, forget this little brat, even this Union Master is not certain he would notice. Since Deacon Jia said that brat is inside, he is definitely inside.”

“Subordinate is willing to use his head as a guarantee that the little brat is still inside this palace!” A dozen metres away, an old man with a white goatee quickly declared with complete confidence.

“Fine. If that’s the case, then we’ll continue to wait, but with so many of us gathered here now, that little brat must have noticed already. Perhaps he does not dare to come out,” Fang Peng snickered.

“That is no longer a matter he can decide,” Qu Zheng sneered.

Just as these words were spoken, a life aura appeared inside the palace, causing everyone’s eyes to light up. Using their Divine Senses to investigate, they quickly confirmed this life aura belonged to Yang Kai.

Soon, Yang Kai’s figure appeared from the main entrance of the palace, his brow furrowed slightly as if he was surprised, but he did not show any signs of anxiety as he stepped forward.

“He came out!” Fang Peng muttered in a low voice.

“Finally, at last!” Qu Zheng sneered, his eyes flashing a cold light, “It saves this Union Master from having to go in and drag him out.”

Yang Kai strode forward, his hands crossed behind his back calmly, the surprise on his face already replaced with extreme indifference. Not only did he not panic, but he did not even show any intention of trying to avoid the crowd outside, stepping out and glancing around as he grinned, “Quite a number.”

“Yang Kai!” Qu Chang Feng snapped his folding fan closed as he called out with a grin, “You’ve made this Young Master wait!”

“Heaven Battling Union, Thunder Typhoon Sect...” Yang Kai nodded lightly, with a smile on his face, “Good, good, so many of you waiting here must be to kill me, yes?”

“You think we need so many people to kill you? Yang Kai, don’t act so arrogant, you’re not qualified,” Qu Chang Feng laughed.

“Really? Then why are so many of you gathered here?”

“To prevent you from running away.”

“So that’s how it is!” A look of understanding appeared on Yang Kai’s face, “I was wondering why Elder Liang had been so accommodating before, so it was all to prepare for this moment. En, this is a good place to silence witnesses. Can I ask why? Although there are some grievances between us, they are far from warranting such a dramatic response, right?”

“Do you think this Young Master will tell you?” Qu Chang Feng smiled contemptuously.

“It doesn’t matter if you talk or not, I can guess. It’s all for the Starship, right?” Yang Kai coldly snorted.

The only thing that could move Heaven Battling Union and Thunder Typhoon Sect to dispatch so many people for him was the Origin King Grade Starship.

This wasn’t just an ordinary Starship; it was also hope for all the masters on Shadowed Star to break through to the Origin King Realm.

Yang Kai frowned slightly as he secretly blamed himself for underestimating the allure of his Starship. He had not considered just how much turbulence the appearance of an Origin King Grade Starship would bring to Shadowed Star, but seeing this scene, he finally understood.

“Seems you’re not completely ignorant!” Qu Chang Feng did not try to deny it. Although Heaven Battling Union and Thunder Typhoon Sect had indeed been ordered by Star Emperor Mountain to work together and seize Yang Kai this time, when all was said and done, this really was all about the Origin King Grade Starship.
