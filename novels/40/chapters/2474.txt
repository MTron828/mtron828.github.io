The reduction in size of the Source Sea caused many cultivators to fight to regain territory. In no time, the scene at the edge of Source Sea turned chaotic.

Although this situation had not spread to the inner depths yet, as time went by, those cultivators who were originally in the deeper part of the Source Sea would definitely encounter similar situations, unable to avoid the inevitable.

At the same time, on a Shattered Star located far away from the Source Sea.

It seemed that a great battle had broken out here, and the frigid Star was filled with chaotic energy fluctuations of turbulent power that refused to subside even after a long time.

A man and a woman laid on the ground, bound by an unknown Secret Technique. Although they were not dead, they were immobilised and both of them were staring at a middle-aged man standing not far in front of them.

The middle-aged man was burly and had a daunting look, with an extremely discomforting aura permeating from his body, his eyes filled with a shuddering shimmer.

There were also some deep wounds on his body where his flesh had been carved out, revealing white pearly bones underneath. Blood gushed from these wounds, giving him an added degree of menace.

However, the middle-aged man did not seem to feel any pain at all. Not only that, he even seemed to enjoy this sensation very much, with a grin plastered on his face.

“Who… who are you?” The man lying on the ground exclaimed, his face white with panic.

The middle-aged man glanced sideways at him and muttered, “Why would a dying person want to know so much?”

“You, you want to kill us?” The man was shocked when he heard this, then refuted angrily, “My Junior Sister and I have no grievances against you. Why do you want to do this?”

The two of them were absorbing Source Strength here quietly and did not expect this middle-aged man to suddenly fall from the sky and attack them without saying a word.

As the middle-aged man was outnumbered, the two were confident in their victory and met his challenge head-on.

But to their great shock, this lone man was not an enemy they could match.

Although this middle-aged man only had a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation and had not broken through to the Emperor Realm, his strength had long exceeded the level of the Dao Source Realm. He knocked them down to the ground easily. The Senior Brother was still rattled by the strange Secret Technique this man used, which completely immobilised him and his Junior Sister.

“You misunderstand!” The middle-aged man smiled cunningly, making the hairs on their bodies stand on end, “This King is not going to ‘kill’ you!”

“Not going to kill us…” The pretty woman relaxed when she heard him, forcing a smile onto her face as she pleaded phonily, “This Sir, as long as you don’t kill us, we will be willing to compromise anything.”

Her companion’s eyeballs bulged when he heard her words, and looked at her in shock, muttering, “Junior Sister, you… “

It seemed like he had seen his Junior Sister’s true colours for the first time and a sharp pain pricked his heart; he had never thought that she would say such a thing to a complete stranger.

“Willing to compromise…” The middle-aged man smiled faintly while his eyes slightly shifted to the woman.

The woman forced a smile, “Sir, as long as you don’t kill me, I am willing to do anything!”

The Senior Brother who was listening to the side almost spat a mouthful of blood in rage, though he dared not say a word.

The middle-aged man gave a wicked smile, “What if I want to eat you?”

The Senior Brother’s face paled upon hearing this. This middle-aged man simply had no bottom line, but neither of them were in a position to bargain. The only choice here was to bow down. It was not unacceptable if his Junior Sister could save the both of them by selling her body and looks; after all, their lives were the most important, and everything would be meaningless if they died.

Thinking so, the Senior Brother grit his teeth, closed his eyes, and blocked out his senses from the scene which he had no control over.

“Eat me…” A hint of shame appeared on the woman’s face, and she stuttered, “Please be gentle.”

A light glimmered in the middle-aged man’s eyes as he became extremely excited, and nodded, “Don’t worry, this King may not look like it, but this King is a gentle person.”

He stepped towards the woman as he spoke.

Seeing this, the woman hurriedly stopped him, “Please not here… Can we go to a more private place?”

Although she was willing to sacrifice herself to survive, she still felt embarrassed to commit such an act in front of her Senior Brother, and therefore requested for the middle-aged man to take her somewhere secluded to conclude their deal.

The middle-aged man only chuckled in reply, “It’s the same everywhere.”

He seemed to have some perverted fetish that the following had to be done in front of the Senior Brother. The woman understood, and could not help but glance at her Senior Brother worriedly, only to find that he had turned his head to a side with his eyes closed, his body shaking in fury.

The woman knew that her Senior Brother was deeply distressed, but their lives were at stake, so she had no choice but to grit her teeth and submit.

The middle-aged man walked up to her and looked down condescendingly, without hiding his fiery gaze in the slightest, as if he wanted to melt the woman with his gaze.

The woman was trembling, knowing that by now, it was useless to say anything.

“Close your eyes, child, don’t look.” The middle-aged man ordered faintly.

The woman let out a breath and closed her eyes obediently, but she felt odd in her heart. Although she looked young, she was not a child anymore, and she understood the affairs between men and women well. This man really did seem to have some strange fetishes.

The middle-aged man stretched out his hand and drew her in, wrapping his arms around her tender waist and hugging her tightly.

The woman struggled to breathe for a moment and could not help moaning.

She clearly felt the middle-aged man’s increasingly rapid breathing. His hot breath on her neck caused her to feel weak and her cheeks flushed.

But at that moment, she suddenly heard a voice that horrified her.

“Heaven Devouring Battle Law!”

In an instant, she felt a sudden pain on her neck, as if she had been bitten by a beast. The woman’s beautiful face turned pale as she quickly opened her eyes and turned her head to look.

Quite contrary to what she had been expecting, the middle-aged man’s eyes had turned red and he had bitten into her neck, gulping mouthfuls of her blood.

Not only that, the middle-aged man seemed to have used a mysterious Secret Art that was rapidly draining away her vitality and cultivation.

“Ah!” The woman yelled in fright, realizing that the middle-aged man did not mean to eat her metaphorically.

He meant to eat her literally!

“Senior Brother, save me!” She screamed in panic.

The Senior Brother, who had his eyes closed to endure the humiliation in his heart, noticed the abnormality and was horrified when he quickly turned his head to look.

The middle-aged man’s mouth was smeared with blood as he bit down on his Junior Sister’s long and white neck, his throat gulping rapidly while devouring her blood.

The Junior Sister’s graceful face aged so rapidly that it was visible to the naked eye, even her hair began turning grey.

“Senior Brother… help me!” The woman pleaded again.

The Senior Brother laid stiffened and shocked on the ground, unable to respond. He stared at the horrible scene in befuddlement, chills running all over his body.

“Senior… brother!” In the span of only five breaths, the woman was now looking haggard, wilted, and surrounded by Death Qi. After spitting out these last two words with difficulty, her eyes turned cloudy, and all traces of vitality slipped away.

She died.

With a wave of his hand, the middle-aged man pushed her corpse aside and lifted his hand to wipe the corners of his mouth. He took a deep breath, revealing a satisfied look.

The horrifying wounds on his body healed almost instantly and in the blink of an eye, his skin had become as smooth as a newborn baby’s.

“This, this…” The Senior Brother was stunned by the scene, still baffled by what he just saw.

He panicked when he noticed the middle-aged man had cast his gaze on him again, “Sir, please spare my life, please I beg you!”

The sight of his Junior Sister’s tragic death kept flashing before his eyes, and he knew he did not want to follow in her footsteps.

The middle-aged man snorted coldly and stretched out a hand from a distance as he bellowed, “Heaven Devouring Battle Law!”

A terrifying suction originated from his palm as he operated this wicked art. As if struck by lightning, the Senior Brother who was lying on the ground could not help shrieking loudly. The vitality and essence in his body escaped from his control and rushed towards the middle-aged man who was absorbing all of it.

“If you kill me, my Eldest Senior Brother won’t let you go! My Eldest Senior Brother has already broken through to the Emperor Realm!” The man lying on the ground yelled in an attempt to save himself, hoping this news would cause this monster to back down.

But the middle-aged man simply sneered, “An Emperor? So what? This King hasn’t eaten anyone in the Emperor Realm yet, but if your Eldest Senior Brother really comes to avenge you, this King won’t mind sending him to meet you.”

“You… madman! Madman I say! You will die a miserable death!” The man, looking grief-stricken as if bereft of both of his parents, gritted his teeth and cursed impertinently, but his voice gradually weakened as his fate mirrored that of his Junior Sister.

Two Star Seals flew out from the two corpses, imprinting on the back of the middle-aged man’s hand.

The middle-aged man possessed the same seven-pointed Star Seal as Yang Kai. In fact, its light was even brighter than that of Yang Kai’s, seemingly on the verge of being promoted to an eight-pointed Star Seal. It could be seen from this that this man had killed many people in the Shattered Star Sea.

After killing these two, the middle-aged man stood in silence and savoured the moment. Suddenly though, his expression was filled with hostility, raising his arms as he screamed towards the Heavens. Rather than joy, he was now filled with madness after the bloodlust.

The howling finally subsided after a long time but his face remained gloomy as he clenched his teeth and cursed, “This damn bottleneck! Why can’t this King break through to the Emperor Realm yet!? Seven hundred years! This King has been working hard for seven hundred years, so why can’t he break through!? The Heavens are so unfair, I refuse to accept this!”

He cursed for a while, but then suddenly rebuked angrily, “A bunch of trash, none could withstand the backlash of this Secret Art, none of you ever managed to use the Heaven defying gift this King gave you! Wastes!”

He slipped into a frenzy in his screams, wielding his strength recklessly as he destroyed everything around him.
