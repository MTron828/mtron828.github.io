Without hesitation, Yang Kai stimulated his Dragon Source and transformed into a 70,000-metre Ancient Dragon. He then swiped his Dragon Claw in a particular direction.

Over there, a Royal Lord was staggering while exchanging moves with an equally sleepy Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Unlike the violent fight earlier, they now looked like two kids haphazardly slapping at each other.

Yang Kai directly grasped the Royal Lord in his claw and clenched.

The Royal Lord’s figure was huge, but while he was in Yang Kai’s claw, only his head was shown outside the iron grip.

The Royal Lord struggled hard but couldn’t get out of the trap. As he felt intense pressure from all directions, his bones cracked and his dark blood gushed out of his body.

“You’re pretty tough,” Yang Kai grumbled; after all, this was a powerful Royal Lord. Yang Kai was unable to squeeze him to death and hadn’t even managed to severely injure him. At most, he had slightly wounded the Royal Lord.

As a sharp pain shot through him, this Royal Lord showed signs of regaining his senses.

Instantly, Yang Kai felt an immense force of resistance coming from his grip and his claw was forced to expand as the Royal Lord was about to free himself.

At the critical moment though, a flash of sword light repeatedly cut across the Royal Lord’s throat.

His head was sent flying away and dark blood spurted out of his neck as his vitality swiftly drained away.

The Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master struggled to keep himself awake as he smugly lifted his sword and said to Yang Kai, “Kid, you’re still too weak.”

Yang Kai refuted through clenched teeth, “You’d better not fall asleep, Senior.”

This person was none other than the Ninth-Order Old Ancestor from Blue Sky Pass, so Yang Kai was naturally familiar with him.

The Old Ancestor had been tangled up with the Royal Lord for a long time, with neither side able to deal critical damage to the other party, but with Yang Kai’s help, the Old Ancestor finally managed to kill his opponent.

Hearing Yang Kai’s mockery, the Old Ancestor did his best to stay awake as he retorted, “Why would I fall asleep? Are you mocking me?”

Saying so, he turned into a sword light and dashed towards the battle between a nearby Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master and a Royal Lord.

Yang Kai shook his head and charged towards the vast battlefield.

Presently, both the Humans and the Black Ink Clansmen, regardless of their cultivation, had been affected by Mu’s Soul Technique and their combat effectiveness plummeted while Yang Kai was safe and sound with the Soul Warming Lotus’ protection.

As he let out a Dragon Breath, his Dragon Form zigzagged across the battlefield. He wielded his Dragon Tail and easily slaughtered countless Black Ink Clansmen along the way.

As the Royal Lord saw the claws closing in on him, he felt his face twitching. He wanted to dodge, but he realised that the Space around him had become viscous. Unable to escape, he was grasped by Yang Kai with both claws, leaving only his head exposed outside the grip.

The Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master’s eyes brightened when he saw this and immediately launched a series of Divine Abilities.

Upon impact, the Dragon Scales on Yang Kai’s claws were blown off and his skin started bleeding. He was in so much pain that he roared at the top of his lungs.

…..

Above the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, Mu’s colossal figure shone even more brightly, as though she was radiating the last gleam of light in her life. She was singing a song in a language no one could understand.

No one knew what the lyrics meant, but as they listened to it, they realised they could barely keep themselves awake.

While still singing, Mu suddenly turned to Cang and said, “Thanks for everything.”

Cang let out a sigh. At this point, he finally figured out what Mu’s plan was. He replied, “Don’t mention it. I’m finally able to feel relieved. It’s a shame that you passed away so early.”

Mu’s talent was unfathomable. Among the 10 of them back then, even though she was the only woman, none of the other nine were comparable to her.

If not for the fact that she passed away so early on, given her intelligence and skill, she may very well have come up with a real solution to the problem.

Mu replied with a smile, “The moment we were chosen back then, the outcome was determined. There’s nothing to feel regretful about. We’ve done our best, and the rest is beyond our control.”

All of a sudden, she turned to the battlefield, her eyes reflecting the 70,000-metre Ancient Dragon, “Is he also a chosen one?”

Cang nodded.

A glint flashed across Mu’s eyes, “He’s not bad.”

Despite her seemingly perfunctory remark, Cang knew that she had acknowledged Yang Kai to be a capable youth.

“All of you are so noisy…” Mo muttered under its breath from the darkness, as though it was talking in its sleep. It seemed to have returned to millions of years ago when it was taking a nap on Mu’s lap, but it was helplessly disturbed by the discussion among them, “You’re making it hard for me to fall asleep.”

Mu said gently, “We’ll be quiet.” Then, she turned to Cang, “We’re still not there yet. I need to borrow some power.”

Cang nodded solemnly, “I’ve been waiting for this moment.” Saying so, he performed a different hand seal and yelled, “Take my body and strengthen the restriction!”

Following that, all the power in his body dissipated as he assimilated his very essence into the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. The restriction was originally invisible and intangible, but after it absorbed Cang’s power, the barrier became obvious to all.

The barrier covered a radius of hundreds of millions of kilometres and didn’t seem to have an end to it, while inside was only endless darkness.

Cang’s aura gradually withered and eventually disappeared. Even his figure turned into motes of light and dissipated.

Above the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, Mu’s figure solidified to the point where one could almost see her unrivalled beauty.

She turned to look at the void with her dark gaze, as if she was trying to take in the entire universe. The next instant, she leaped into the darkness.

“I can finally have a good sleep…” Mo muttered from the darkness, which shook all of a sudden. There seemed to be an ominous monster hidden within the darkness that turned over in its sleep, and a hush fell abruptly.

The void trembled as though it was mourning for the death of these powerful beings.

The moment Mu leaped into the darkness, all the Humans and Black Ink Clansmen, who had been affected earlier, snapped back to their senses in an instant.

The battlefield, which had become calm due to Mu’s Soul Technique, turned violent instantly.

However, everyone sensitively detected that two powerful beings’ Wills were missing. One of them was Mo, and the other was Cang.

With that said, there was now another powerful Will.

In the darkness, the enormous creature was still prying open the edges of the gap with half of his body having been revealed. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Even though it hadn’t fully revealed itself, even half of his body was enough to give off indescribable pressure.

Mu’s Soul Secret Technique had a huge impact on this giant as well and it had stopped moving earlier; however, the moment Mu leapt into the darkness, the influence of her Secret Technique disappeared. As though having received an order, the giant struggled even harder to get out of the darkness.

But it was too late. Cang had sacrificed himself to strengthen the restriction, and Mu had used a trump card she had left behind years ago. Not only had Mo fallen asleep, but the gap of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction was closing rapidly as well.

Regardless of how hard the giant tried, he was unable to stop the gap from closing. In just three breaths of time, the wide gap was shut.

However, the giant still hadn’t fully crawled out of the gap. The Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction was like a razor-sharp blade that cut across the giant’s waist, splitting him in half.

No black blood streamed out of his body, only Black Ink Strength gushed out of his wounds. The dark giant roared in pain as his voice spread across the universe.

Yang Kai took a glance at the giant and became startled, “A Giant Spirit God?”

Earlier, he had been assisting the Ninth-Order Masters to kill the Royal Lords, so he didn’t have time to look at the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. Now, he was stunned by what he saw.

The dark giant was actually a Giant Spirit God!

[Were Giant Spirit Gods created by Mo? No!] Yang Kai soon dismissed the idea, for the creature was not a real Giant Spirit God. He believed that it was a creature that Mo had created based on the Giant Spirit Gods. The giant had the size and appearance of a Giant Spirit God, and perhaps even the power of one, but he certainly wasn’t a member of the amiable Giant Spirit God Clan.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but recall the Black Ink Giant Spirit God that he came across in the Black Ink Sealing Land in the Divine Spirit Ancestral Land.

Back then, he thought that a Giant Spirit God had been corrupted by Black Ink Strength. Now, it seemed to him that it wasn’t the case. Perhaps that Black Ink Giant Spirit God was also created by Mo.

At the thought of this, Yang Kai felt a crawling sensation on his scalp.

Giant Spirit Gods were incredibly powerful beings that even the Divine Spirits were no match for. He had also personally witnessed a Giant Spirit God’s power. In the past, Ah Er brought him to barge into the Chaotic Dead Territory, but despite being surrounded by mortal danger, Ah Er was completely at ease.

The Chaotic Dead Territory was a place where even Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were unable to remain for long.

In other words, Giant Spirit Gods were more powerful than Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. Perhaps they were as strong as Cang and the other Martial Ancestors.

The Heavens didn’t give the Giant Spirit God Clan a very high level of intelligence, but with that said, they were gifted with unrivalled powers.

Now, Yang Kai wondered how powerful this Black Giant Spirit God was.

What made him relax slightly was that the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction had cut this giant figure in half, causing his strength to plummet.

On the battlefield, more auras soon disappeared for good.

In the short moment when Mu’s Secret Technique had affected the entire battlefield, Yang Kai had helped the Ninth-Oder Open Heaven Realm Masters kill five Royal Lords.

Initially, after five Royal Lords were killed, there supposedly would be another five Royal Lords who would step out of the darkness to make up for the losses; nevertheless, the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction had been closed, and Mo was now sound asleep. There wouldn’t be any new Royal Lords.

In the battles between the Ninth-Order Masters and the Royal Lords, the Humans had gained the upper hand and as time passed, this advantage would be increasingly enhanced until the Black Ink Clan were no longer able to resist.

If not for the Black Ink Giant Spirit God’s appearance, the Humans would be guaranteed to win this war.

However, with the Black Ink Giant Spirit God’s existence, no one could tell what the outcome would be.

Following a roar, the Black Ink Giant Spirit God stuck out a hand and grasped somewhere on the battlefield. Faced with the giant hand, both the Human Warships and Black Ink Clansmen found it hard to dodge.

Warships exploded apart, and before the Humans could even flee, they were vaporized by the impact. It was the same case for the Black Ink Clansmen. Without any Warships to protect them, they were killed even before the Humans.

The hand then swept across the void, and although it seemed sluggish, that was only because it was too colossal.

Space itself was torn apart wherever the hand swatted.
