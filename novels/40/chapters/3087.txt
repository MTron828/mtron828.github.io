Lu An was her First Uncle, who didn’t dare to look Lu Huai Shuang in the eyes.

Things were pretty obvious. Lu Huai Shuang wasn’t blind, so she didn’t need to ask anything to have found out the truth. She didn’t punish him earlier because she had more pressing matters to attend to at the time. Now that she was free, she certainly wouldn’t let this traitor off.

No act of betrayal in the Lu Family could be tolerated.

Lu Bing was shocked upon hearing that, “Him? No way!”

He and Lu An were cousins. Just one month ago, they sat together to drink wine and chat, so he couldn’t believe that Lu An had betrayed the Lu Family. However, he knew that Lu Huai Shuang wouldn’t willfully accuse someone. Since she had said so, she must have obtained solid evidence. With a solemn expression, he uttered, “I’ll take a look.”

Then, he turned around and left, but he soon returned with a livid expression, “Lu An has fled!”

He had searched around the entire Starship, but Lu An was nowhere in sight. The other cultivators from the Lu Family also told him that they hadn’t seen Lu An for quite some time.

“Just as I expected,” Lu Huai Shuang wasn’t surprised at all. If she were Lu An, she would have fled as well. Traitors were always more contemptible than enemies. If he hadn’t fled, he would’ve been punished in the harshest way.

At the same time, she secretly heaved a sigh of relief. If Lu An hadn’t fled, she wouldn’t know how to deal with him. Kill him? But he was her Elder as well as her Uncle. If she really executed him, some people might be disappointed and think that she was too stone-hearted.

Since he had run away, it had actually spared her some trouble. Just like those from the He Family who managed to escape, he wouldn’t be able to live a rich life on this Dead Star that was devoid of any World Energy, even if he survived. That was why she didn’t have the intention of hunting him down, as leaving him here was the harshest punishment for him.

“Why did he betray us?” Lu Bing was distressed.

“He was either after benefits or the enemy found a way to blackmail him,” Lu Huai Shuang uttered dispassionately and waved her hand. “Forget it. Keep this matter to yourself, I don’t want to arouse any unnecessary suspicions.”

“Understood.” Lu Bing nodded, “But, Lu An still has some relatives on Morning Sun Star. How should we explain it to them if they ask about it?”

“Third Uncle, you’ll have to come up with an explanation.” Lu Huai Shuang stared at him. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lu Bing bowed his head, “Alright. Just leave it to me.” He paused for a moment, “By the way, what should we do about the He Family’s Starship?”

Suddenly, Lu Huai Shuang lifted her head and said, “Don’t do anything to the Starship before we get that person’s permission.” Although they were the ones who killed all the He Family’s men and the Origin King Grade Starship was supposed to be their prize, Yang Kai had actually made the biggest contribution.

So, he practically had his name labelled on the Origin King Grade Starship, even though it was invisible.

Lu Bing uttered, “I understand what you mean. That’s why I’ve told our fellow clansmen not to enter the Starship. However, I don’t think that person would be interested in a Starship. Why don’t you… Ask him what he thinks about it?”

Although the Lu Family was one of the two rulers on Morning Sun Star, they only had one Origin King Grade Starship with them. If they could obtain another for free, their strategic strength would increase markedly. An Origin King Grade Starship was one of the sharpest weapons in the Star Field and had many uses. If they wanted to deal with the remaining He Family members after they returned to Morning Sun Star, this Starship’s power was indispensable.

Lu Huai Shuang rubbed her temples. Whenever she thought about that person, she would recall the incident where he molested her when they were about to descend the mountain. She could still vividly remember his touch on her chest, so her expression appeared awkward now.

[He told me it wasn’t intentional but… hah…]

“Have you found out about his background?” Lu Bing asked.

Lu Huai Shuang shook her head, “I only know that he’s not from Unending Star Field.”

Lu Bing’s figure shook when he heard that, “He’s not from Unending Star Field?”

Suddenly recalling something, he exclaimed, “Then he…”

Lu Huai Shuang dipped her head, “Yes, I suspect that he came from ‘that’ place as well.”

“No wonder.” Lu Bing fell into his thoughts, “Even the Head Manager of Fierce Gale Pirates is willing to become his servant. If he’s really from that place, then Sheng Yao gained a great bargain. Sheng Yao must have realized that as well, right?”

Lu Huai Shuang replied with a smile, “Someone like him is good at avoiding disaster while pursuing good fortunes. If there are no benefits, why would he be so servile to someone else?”

With a solemn expression, Lu Bing added, “Then we have to make sure to be on good terms with him, and we mustn’t let Sheng Yao get the opportunity before us. Alright, we’d better find out his preferences, but we don’t know what he likes. Anyway, men are mostly after money, power and women. Maybe we can start with women. We have a few beauties aboard the ship this time.”

“I’ll think about it,” Lu Huai Shuang nodded indifferently.

Realizing that she wanted to be alone, Lu Bing said, “I’ll take my leave now. Please inform me if you have any news.”

While Lu Huai Shuang was seated on a chair, a myriad of expressions came over her. After pondering over it for a long time, she still couldn’t figure out anything. In the end, she decided to visit that person and take things from there.

Whether or not she could strike up a relationship with him, she had to familiarize herself with him first. Sheng Yao had been following him around since the beginning, and if he managed to gain Yang Kai’s favour first, then the Lu Family would be excluded.

This was a huge opportunity, so Lu Huai Shuang wouldn’t want it to slip through her fingers.

…

While Lu Huai Shuang’s light steps could be heard, she slowly emerged from the corridor, but when she reached her former room, she was shocked by the person who appeared there and shouted, “Who are you?”

There was a woman, whose figure was curvy and sexy, standing in front of her room. Her peaks were so grand that they looked like they would burst out of her robes at any moment. She was clad in a tight-fitting light purple long dress, and a silk sash in the same colour had been wrapped around her waist, which perfectly outlined her willowy body. She even had her back arched slightly in a conspicuous curve, which lifted her bottom and made it look even more alluring.

Her silky smooth hair hung loosely over her shoulders, and her watery eyes were so lively that it was as though they were sparkling.

Even though they were both women, Lu Huai Shuang still felt her heart throbbing when she saw this woman.

[This woman is a seductress!]

Of course, her charm would have been even greater if not for the threatening aura of a Second-Order Origin King coming from her.

At this moment, Lu Huai Shuang wasn’t in the mood to appreciate that woman’s beauty though. Anyone would be alarmed when they realized that such an unfamiliar Master had suddenly appeared on their own Starship.

A cold glint flashed across Lu Huai Shuang’s sword as she pointed her weapon at the woman, her expression bitingly cold. Although she had a lower cultivation, she might still stand a chance of defeating her if they fought as this was her Starship and she had support.

To her surprise, faced with such direct hostility, the woman remained unfazed. She was holding a box of rouge with one hand and putting on some make-up with her other while looking at the mirror in the box. Her expression appeared serious.

Then, she stopped what she was doing and said in a frustrated manner, “I haven’t done this for years, so I’m not used to it anymore. Little Sister Shuang, can you help me put on some eye shadow?”

[Little Sister Shuang?] Li Huai Shuang frowned, “Do I know you?”

She was certain that she had never met such a mature and seductive woman before, so she felt doubtful about the way she was addressed.

The woman replied with a smile, “We just met not long ago. Do you not recognize me anymore?”

“What are you…” Lu Huai Shuang became a little impatient, but she soon gawked in shock as a possibility sprung into her mind.

The woman suddenly spoke in a completely different tone, “How about if I speak like this?”

“You’re Sheng Yao?” Lu Huai Shuang couldn’t believe her eyes as her jaw dropped as though two invisible fingers had been stuffed into her mouth.

The infamous Head Manager of Fierce Gale Pirates in Unending Star Field had turned into an alluring and fair-skinned lady with a curvy figure. At that instant, Lu Huai Shuang felt that her understanding of the world had been turned upside down, and her mind had gone blank.

“Hahaha…” the Head Manager broke into a fit of giggles as her chest swung wildly, threatening to leap right out of her dress.

Lu Huai Shuang still found it inconceivable, but the person standing in front of her at this moment was a Second-Order Origin King, so there really was no other candidate other than Fierce Gale Pirates’ Head Manager.

“How… why…” Lu Huai Shuang didn’t know what to say, as she was gripped by conflicted feelings.

The Head Manager suddenly turned serious and put on a sorrowful expression, “We’re both women and leaders of our respective forces, so I’m sure you understand the reason behind it.”

Lu Huai Shuang was startled for a moment before she comprehended. When she took over the Lu Family, she was criticized by almost everyone. It wasn’t that her cultivation wasn’t powerful enough as she was an Origin King, so no one in the Lu Family was stronger than she. She was criticized mainly because she was a woman.

Only after a number of hard-won battles where she had managed to destroy countless opponents and save the Lu Family from a series of crises did her position as Matriarch of the Lu Family become secure.

Now though, she could no longer be willful, as she had to be mindful of her language and mannerism at all times. It was as though men were naturally in a more advantageous position than women, which she felt was incredibly unfair. All men in the world were born from their mothers, so how could they look down on women? Both men and women were Humans, so why was there a disparity between the two?

The situation was already so bad in the Lu Family, so there was no need to even mention one like the Fierce Gale Pirates where the wickedest and most ferocious Star Pirates in the entire Star Field had gathered.

The Head Manager uttered, “If those brats ever found out that I’m not only a woman, but a beautiful one at that, do you think I could still manage them? My sworn Brothers alone would not hesitate to attack me with obscene intent.”

Understanding the situation she was in, Lu Huai Shuang nodded. Ma Chao Qun and Ge Ming could drink wine and have fun with women with Sheng Yao, but the prerequisite was that Sheng Yao was a fellow man just like them. If Sheng Yao turned back into her female form, her two sworn Brothers would undoubtedly develop covetous thoughts about her.

For some reason, Lu Huai Shuang could sympathize with this woman. In a way, they were in similar situations. They were both beautiful women who were the leaders of their respective forces, so they were restricted in many ways.

“Sheng Yao isn’t your name, right?” Lu Huai Shuang uttered. No woman would bear such a masculine name.

The Head Manager covered her mouth and giggled, “It’s just an alias I came up with randomly.”

“How should I call you from now on?”

“He Yun Xiang,” she smiled and replied, “I was born in a poor family, so my name is somewhat tacky.”

Lu Huai Shuang nodded slightly and then frowned. With an awkward expression, she asked, “I heard that every night you sleep with 100 women?”

[Since she’s a woman, how did she manage to do it? However, this rumour is probably not unfounded.]

Still covering her mouth, He Yun Xiang chuckled, “Little Sister Shuang, you’re quite the gossip,” then, a glint flashed across her eyes, “If you want to find out, you can try it with me one day.”

Lu Huai Shuang’s expression immediately turned grim as she replied in an awkward tone, “No need.”

At that instant, she regretted asking her this question. [I must be out of my mind!]
