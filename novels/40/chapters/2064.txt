After a brief discussion, the man in white immediately went inside the cave and stood on an Array. Then, he took out a few Source Crystals and placed them inside the grooves around the Array before forming a hand seal, starting up the Array.

The next moment, the man in white soon disappeared followed by a thrum and faint Space Force fluctuations.

Seeing this, the other Jiang Family cultivator, who was guarding this place, withdrew his gaze and closed his eyes again, meditating.

After about the time it takes for an incense to burn, a small beast suddenly landed on a small mound three kilometres away from the cave. And hot on its tail, Mo Xiao Qi and Yang Kai’s figures appeared.

The little beast lightly sniffed toward the front and immediately after, started squeaking.

Mo Xiao Qi furrowed her black brow before she turned to Yang Kai and said with some hesitation, “Big Brother Yang, Xiao Fu said that Ruo Xi’a aura has disappeared in that cave.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s face turned cold. He promptly spread his Divine Sense to that side.

After a short white, he cried in surprise, “Space Array!?”

“There is a Space Array in there?” Mo Xiao Qi looked at Yang Kai in surprise, hearing this.

Yang Kai nodded and answered, “There is! Furthermore, it seems to have been used just recently. There are some Space Force fluctuations lingering around it. Also, there is a First-Order Origin King cultivator on the lookout inside the cave... I guess we are at the right place.”

“So, shall we break in?” Mo Xiao Qi inquired.

“Of course!” Yang Kai nodded his agreement. But right then, his expression suddenly changed as he shouted, “Dammit, Ruo Xi might be in danger!”

It suddenly struck him that he had just inquired with the Jiang Family about Ruo Qi. And someone here has used the Space Array. It was quite likely that it had something to do with the Jiang Family. Perhaps the upper echelon of the Jiang Family had sent a message to silence Zhang Ruo Xi.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai suddenly became anxious. He didn’t care about hiding anymore. With a jolt, his figure instantly shot towards the cave.

The Jiang Family cultivator inside the cave was extremely sensitive. The moment Yang Kai made a move, he sensed it and opened his eyes, and when he saw a streak of light shooting over at an astonishing speed, his expression couldn’t help but drastically change.

He promptly circulated his Saint Qi and stood up, looking ahead with an ugly look on his face.

And when Yang Kai’s aura came bearing down on him, the Jiang Family cultivator’s face immediately turned pale. He cried in horror, “Dao Source Realm!”

He was just a First-Order Origin King cultivator who had just formed his own Domain. How could he stand against a Dao Source Realm master?

Just as he cried out, Yang Kai had already arrived before him and lightly smacked his palm on his chest. The man suddenly felt a tremendous force assailing him as he was sent flying, spewing blood. By the time he crashed on the ground, he was already unconscious!

Yang Kai hadn’t killed him. After all, he still had to figure out the connection between Zhang Ruo Xi and the Jiang Family so he couldn’t bear to kill someone rashly.

However, the opposite party would remain unconscious for several days under his palm strike, which would be enough for him to find out everything clearly.

After landing, Yang Kai immediately cast his gaze on the Space Array inside the cave.

Mo Xiao Qi had also arrived by now.

After a while, Yang Kai couldn’t help exclaim in surprise.

“Big Brother, what did you find?” asked Mo Xiao Qi.

“This Array wasn’t set up by the Jiang Family, and neither was it arranged recently. It seemed to be quite old.” Yang Kai furrowed his brow.

The Space Array inside the cave was old and blotched. Obviously, it was laid a long time ago. However, as it was hidden inside this barren mountain’s cave, it was unlikely to be discovered.

Heaven knows how the Jiang Family came to learn about this place and where it led to.

“Is there any secret here?” Mo Xiao Qi immediately became interested. Her pair of beautiful eyes glimmered with a strange gleam as she kept looking at the Array.

“Let’s check it out later.” Yang Kai was worried about Zhang Ruo Xi’s safety and had no intention of careful investigation. Next, he arrived on the Array with a flicker as Mo Xiao Qi nodded and stepped on it as well.

Yang Kai immediately prompted the Space Force in his body and poured it into the Array.

In the next moment, the Array started humming as the two disappeared with a flash of light.

Suddenly, Yang Kai and Mo Xiao Qi appeared in a dark and humid area deep under the ground; how deep, no one knew.

However, before they could check their surroundings, they heard someone shouting, “Who are you? You actually dared to break into my Jiang Family’s secret land!”

Immediately after the shout, two violent attacks flew toward Yang Kai and Mo Xiao Qi from left and right, without any explanation. And judging by the fluctuations caused when they attacked, these two were actually Third-Order Origin King cultivators!

Yang Kai’s gaze turned colder as he shouted aloud, without even looking at the oncoming attacks, “Solidify!”

The next moment, the Space Principles fluctuated as the surrounding space suddenly solidified as if it had received some kind of order.

The next moment, the two attacks that were just about to strike Yang Kai and Mo Xiao Qi strangely disappeared into thin air as two figures appeared, left and right.

The two seemed to have never expected their attacks to be dealt with in such an unbelievable way. Both of them were stupefied for a while.

However, the man on the left immediately reacted as he cried in shock, “Principles! Dao Source Realm master!”

While speaking, his feet kicked the ground as his figure flew toward the rear. Surprisingly, he immediately thought of fleeing after seeing things turn bad.

But how could Yang Kai let his wish come true? Immediately, a Golden Blood Thread flew out from his fingertip with the flick of his wrist, directly tying up that man.

That man started sweating buckets, sensing the sharp aura emanating from the Golden Blood Thread. How could he dare to make any strange movements? He was more afraid of inadvertently getting cut into several pieces. He stood straight and looked at Yang Kai in horror.

The other man also stood in his place with a dumbfounded look on his face.

After all, Mo Xiao Qi was standing before him with a sharp dagger in her hand. The dagger was radiating a cold glow and happened to be pointed at his chest.

Obviously, in the momentary lapse in the man’s concentration, Mo Xiao Qi had already subdued him with lightning-fast means!

Yang Kai glanced over the two with a cold look on his face.

The man on the left asked in a trembling voice, “Who are you? Why do you break into my Jiang Family’s private land and attack us!”

“You don’t need to know who I am! And I’m here to find someone. If you obediently cooperate, perhaps I will let you live!” Yang Kai’s tone turned colder, staring at him.

“To find someone!” That man immediately furrowed his brow after hearing this. He nervously looked at Yang Kai and asked with difficulty as a drop of sweat trickled down his forehead, “I wonder who is Your Excellency looking for?”

“Is there a girl named Zhang Ruo Xi here?” asked Yang Kai.

The two Origin King Realm cultivators of the Jiang Family looked at each other before the man who had spoken earlier, justified himself with a bitter smile, “We are just ordered to guard the entrance. We have no idea about the name of those people...”

“Big Brother Yang, you don’t need to ask anything. Xiao Fu has smelled Sister Ruo Xi’s aura, she is here!” Suddenly, Mo Xiao Qi interrupted in excitement.

Yang Kai quickly looked over and noticed the Heaven Escaping Bat squeaking around toward a direction with glittering eyes, as if it had really found something.

“I’ll leave the things here to you, let me borrow Xiao Fu!” Having finished speaking, Yang Kai poked a few times toward the two Third-Order Origin King cultivators, pouring his Source Qi into their bodies. Immediately, the two let out a muffled groan as blood trickled down the corner of their lips.

Having done this, Yang Kai beckoned to the bat as the little beast immediately flew ahead.

“Big Brother Yan, be careful. There is something strange about this place!” Mo Xiao Qi exhorted from behind.

Yang Kai nodded his acknowledgement but he didn’t slow down.

While flying along the way, Yang Kai had the time to carefully inspect the surroundings.

He was inside an underground mine. The mine had numerous branches and forked roads. From time to time, he could hear clanking noises coming from the other end of the fork. Apparently, someone appeared to be mining something.

However, the places Yang Kai passed by had been mined already, leaving only pieces of rocks behind.

Following the little beast, Yang Kai soon entered a forked road.

Yang Kai immediately sensed the aura of many living beings inside that forked road.

After a short while, Yang Kai saw many people knocking on the walls of the dimly lit mine tunnel as broken pieces of rocks fell on the ground.

What surprised Yang Kai was the fact that everyone in here had the cultivation of Saint King Realm or lower. There wasn’t a single Origin Returning Realm Master.

All of them had their hands and feet cuffed with special bracelets and anklets, which would rattle every time they moved. They were simply unable to hide their whereabouts.

Perhaps they noticed something, all the people mining the ore turned their heads together, looking at Yang Kai.

A desolate feeling gripped Yang Kai’s heart, noticing their listless gazes. Heaven knows how long they have been kept here, let alone how long they had been mining here. Each of these cultivators appeared extremely exhausted and haggard. Only a few among them retained a little of their spirits.

There were even a few decomposing corpses lying on the ground nearby, filling the air of an already poorly circulated mine with a foul smell.

Yang Kai promptly halted his footsteps and asked, looking around, “Which one of you is the leader? Stand out and speak up!”

All those cultivators hesitatingly looked at each other after hearing this. A look of fear appeared in the eyes of most of them. They seemed to be afraid of standing out.

After a long time, a young-looking cultivator stood up. He appeared to be no older than thirty years. His tattered clothes were unable to hide his robust body. Although his aura seemed a little weaker, it was a lot better than the others.

The man, standing not too far away from Yang Kai, cupped his fists and introduced himself, “This one is Zhou Kang. May I ask what instruction Senior has for me!”

Yang Kai seemed to be about the same age as him, but his cultivation was much higher than him. So naturally, he believed Yang Kai to be an old monster, who had lived for hundreds of years. He didn’t think that there was anything wrong in addressing Yang Kai as a Senior.

“Who are you guys, why are you all here?” Yang Kai asked in a deep voice. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Zhou Kang couldn’t help but gaze at Yang Kai in surprise after hearing this. Suddenly, he appeared to have thought of something as he exclaimed in excitement, “Senior isn’t a member of the Jiang Family?”
