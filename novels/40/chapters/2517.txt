The Monster Beast was in a berserk state when Yang Kai and Zhang Ruo Xi appeared. With its mouth wide open, it charged towards a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator. Either the First-Order Source Realm cultivator was running out of steam or he was not watching, but he did not manage to dodge the Monster Beast in time. With a scream, a chunk of his abdomen was chomped off, and blood spurted out of his wound uncontrollably.

At that moment, Yang Kai’s face hardened and he swung a out fist.

With a punch, the once majestic Monster Beast suddenly wailed, a hole appearing on its robust body, blood and intestines pouring out of it. The Monster Beast died instantly.

The cultivator who was still held in the mouth of the Monster Beast had not regained his senses from the shock, and continued to struggle and scream miserably.

However, the other two Dao Source Realm Masters noticed. They lifted their heads and looked towards Yang Kai before turning back to the dead Monster Beast. They shuddered in their hearts, realizing that they had met a powerful Master.

Although Yang Kai looked young, he was undoubtedly an Emperor Realm Master if he was able to kill a Monster Beast at the peak of the Eleventh-Order with just a punch.

The two of them did not dare hesitate. They cupped their fists with solemn faces and just when they were about to thank Yang Kai, he interrupted them, “Which direction is Earth City?”

They were stunned. One of them, a man who was wearing a purple robe, hurriedly pointed to a direction, “Sir, fly five thousand kilometres towards that direction, and you will reach Earth City.”

Although he could not figure Yang Kai’s real age, since he was an Emperor Realm Master, it was only right to address him as Sir.

Yang Kai took a look in the direction he pointed to, then teleported. He and Zhang Ruo Xi disappeared out of sight of the group in the blink of an eye.

After a long time, someone asked in a low voice, “Was… was I hallucinating? Were there two people here just now?”

“Senior Brother, you did not hallucinate, I saw them too. He killed the Green Tiger Turtle and saved Martial Uncle Xiao.”

“Ah, Martial Uncle Xiao is injured. Quickly take out some Spirit Pills!”

“Hold on, Martial Uncle Xiao. Please don’t die.”

A group of inexperienced youths gathered around their ‘Martial Uncle Xiao’ who was bitten by the Green Tiger Turtle and dealt with his injury hurriedly, while the two Dao Source Realm Masters remained standing on the spot, feeling befuddled, staring at the place where Yang Kai disappeared for a long time.

They had no idea how Yang Kai arrived, or how he left. Their eyes were fixed on Yang Kai the whole time he was here, but he still strangely vanished from their sights.

If it were not for the fresh corpse of the Green Tiger Turtle here, they would think that it was just a dream.

After all, that was an Emperor! A peak Master revered by all in the Star Boundary.

Once upon a time, they were fired up in enthusiasm and believed that they could one day catch a glimpse of the mysteries of the Emperor Realm. Unfortunately, due to the restraints of poor aptitude and resources, they could only roam around the Second-Order Dao Source Realm. As they grew older, the passion in their heart had extinguished, leaving a mindset of simply muddling along for the rest of their lives.

They turned around and glanced at those young people in their Sect, thinking that they were just as high-spirited as they once were in their youth, but after several dozen or a hundred years, how many of them would still be alive? Even if they were still alive, would the young stop striving just like they did?

……

Yang Kai pushed his Emperor Qi, injecting it into his wooden boat to fly at a far greater speed than before.

“This token is a disciple token of Azure Sun Temple. In addition to representing the identity of a disciple of Azure Sun Temple, it can also be used as a communication artifact. I just received a request for help from a disciple of Azure Sun Temple,” Yang Kai explained to Zhang Ruo Xi while standing on the boat. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ever since meeting Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao in the Source Sea, Yang Kai had kept the Azure Sun Golden Token on his person so he could sense messages from the pair at any time, but he did not receive any back then.

Nevertheless, Yang Kai did not throw it back to his Space Ring. He just continued to keep it with him since it did not affect his movement.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai actually received a request for help from a disciple of Azure Sun Temple in this remote Eastern Territory.

It was a short message, with just a single sentence.

‘Earth City, Azure Sun Pavilion, requesting help!’

It was obvious that only a disciple of Azure Sun Temple could send this message to Yang Kai’s Golden Token, but there were two questions that troubled him. One, how did this disciple come to the Eastern Territory? And two, what danger had he gotten into?

Azure Sun Temple was a Sect from the Southern Territory, more than a billion kilometres from here.

Yang Kai naturally could not just sit back and ignore a request for aid though; therefore, he quickly found someone to inquire about the location of Earth City.

It was also his first time coming to the Eastern Territory, so it was natural that he did not know where this Earth City was. Fortunately, there was a group of people nearby and Yang Kai immediately teleported there to ask for directions.

“I don’t know what’s going on there, but if there’s a fight, take care of yourself,” Yang Kai gave a warning.

Earth City no doubt had Masters guarding it, so even though Yang Kai was already an Emperor, he was not arrogant enough to look down on everyone in the world. If he really needed to fight with someone, he may not be able to take care of Zhang Ruo Xi.

As such, he was taking the time now to instruct her clearly, so that she would act according to the circumstances later.

“Understood,” Zhang Ruo Xi nodded heavily, “Sir, just do what you need to, Ruo Xi won’t be a burden to you.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly and further accelerated his speed anxiously.

Earth City was located in the central region of the Eastern Territory and was one of the most important cities in the whole Eastern Territory, far more flourishing than Purple Mountain City. The surrounding vast territory and abundant resources of Earth City attracted many cultivators to settle down here.

The visits of numerous cultivators brought increasing prosperity to this city.

The City Lord of Earth City, Zu Hong, was a First-Order Emperor Realm Master and had many capable subordinates under him. Ever since he took charge of Earth City fifty years ago, he had been keeping the entire city in good order until now.

The city was bound with strict laws; as such, not many people dared to commit crimes there.

Zu Hong had even set nine thousand nine hundred and eighty-one rules in Earth City. Anyone who dared to violate them would be punished equally, ranging from public flogging to a death sentence. His ruthless spirit and just attitude gained him the love of the people.

At this moment, in front of a shop called Azure Sun Pavilion in Earth City, was a group of cultivators dressed in city guard uniforms, blocking off access. There was also a Dao Source Realm cultivator sitting in a nearby teahouse, enjoying his drink leisurely. He was constantly inspecting everyone who passed by the shop, his eyes sharp like a falcon.

Whispers spread around the citizens, discussing what bad deed the Azure Sun Pavilion could have done to cause the people from the City Lord’s Mansion to surround it.

Azure Sun Pavilion was just a small shop that did not sell anything special. They mostly resold Spirit Pills and artifacts collected from others, so they did not really gain a lot of profits and just barely maintained their business.

Everyone who had visited the Azure Sun Pavilion knew that other than a shopkeeper, there were only two other attendants in the shop. These two shop-hands were notoriously unmotivated, and even when there were customers in the shop, they would just continue to sleep on the desk and took no initiative in serving them.

Over time, cultivators who became familiar with their service stopped going to Azure Sun Pavilion.

If it were not surrounded by the cultivators of the City Lord’s Mansion, perhaps most of the people would not have even remembered its existence.

No one knew what Azure Sun Pavilion had done, but it would definitely suffer from being surrounded by the guards. Every cultivator who walked past the shop would stay a good distance away from it like they were avoiding snakes and scorpions, worried about being stung by bad luck if they got too near.

Just then, a man and a woman from the crowd suddenly walked out, straight towards Azure Sun Pavilion.

Both the man and the woman looked young. The man had a tall and strong body, dressed like an ordinary youth. His steps were steady, and even though he was not very handsome, he had a rugged, resolute look to him. The woman on the other hand looked beautiful and gentle, following closely behind the young man. Her age was even younger and she seemed to be in her early twenties.

Because Azure Sun Pavilion was surrounded by guards, no one was seen walking in the area of several tens of meters from the entrance, so when the man and the woman walked straight towards the shop, they immediately attracted a lot of attention.

The Dao Source Realm cultivator, who was sipping his tea in a nearby teahouse, squinted, his eyes flashing with a brilliant light as he carefully examined the pair.

He silently released his Divine Sense, but it was bizarre that he could not inspect their cultivation.

The Dao Source Realm cultivator’s face instantly turned solemn.

He was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master, so the reasons for him to be unable to sense this pair’s cultivation were either they were Emperor Realm Masters, or they possessed some kind of artifact that could keep their cultivation hidden.

Such a pair would certainly not be Emperor Realm Masters. In that case, they must have some unique artifact.

[They must not have simple backgrounds to possess such artifacts, just who are they? Why are they interested in Azure Sun Pavilion?]

While he was still pondering, the young pair arrived in front of the guards. The young man simply glanced around at these people, however, and shouted, “What are you doing? A good dog doesn’t block the path. Quickly, make way!”

When the words fell, the surrounding cultivators were taken aback.

[How dare this young man humiliate the guards? Does he not fear death?]

Everyone seemed to be able to foresee that this man would be thrown into the city prison to suffer. Horrified, they simultaneously moved a little further away from the shop.

The few guards who were blocking off Azure Sun Pavilion were infuriated and threw a burning gaze at the young man in unison. The head of the guards snorted coldly, “Pay attention to your words. It’s a crime to insult the guards.”

The young man seemed amused by this response and grinned, “Is it a crime to scold someone? Don’t tell me you have never scolded anyone.”

The head of the guards reprimanded, “According to the law established by the City Lord, I can take you away at any time, put you in prison, and give you eighty whips.”

“Is it that serious?” The young man was startled, his face pale.

The head guard looked at him in disdain, snorted coldly, “Are you scared now?”
