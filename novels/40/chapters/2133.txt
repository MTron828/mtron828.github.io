“However, because of the emergence of the Star Seal, the Four Seasons Realm will be much more dangerous than the previous years, so in addition to the search for the Star Seal, it is more important for you to ensure your own safety! You are all the Sect’s future. Any deaths will be a loss for the Sect, so this Queen wants each and every one of you to put in your best effort!”

“Yes, many thanks to Elder Gao!” The disciples replied in unison.

“Elder Gao, what exactly does the Star Seal look like?” Xiao Bai Yi asked.

“The Star Seal is formless, and you will be branded with a pattern on your body when you obtain it. If you really do have the opportunity to obtain it, you will naturally know it.”

“Disciple understands!” Xiao Bai Yi nodded.

“Also, the Star Seal can be transferred. If any of you obtains the Star Seal, it can be transferred to the Sect. Of course, in return for getting the Star Seal, you will be eligible to enter the Shattered Star Sea in the future!”

Everyone was breathing in excitement.

“Then... what happens if a disciple gets two or more?” Xiao Bai Yi asked again.

Gao Xue Ting said, “Keep one for yourself, and give the rest to the Sect, and the Sect will reward you correspondingly!”

She turned her head towards Yang Kai at this point, said, “Same goes for you!”

“Me?” Yang Kai looked alarmed.

“Of course!” Gao Xue Ting nodded gently, “Although you’re not a disciple of the Azure Sun Temple, you are going into the Four Seasons Realm using one of our slots, so you would have to abide by the rules.”

“Okay then,” Yang Kai obeyed helplessly, as there was no way he could defy her anyway. The officials of Azure Sun Temple would most likely fully examine him when he exited the Four Seasons Realm to ensure he did not keep any extra Star Seals on his own.

“This is the only extra instruction I have for you, there’s nothing else. You’re dismissed.” Gao Xue Ting finished and returned to the front of the ship with her back facing everyone, as still as a statue. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Outside of the ship, Xia Sheng managed to catch up to them, maintaining a parallel level with the ship. He had a pitiful expression, mouthing at them soundlessly. It seems like he was begging for mercy.

Gao Xue Ting did not even glance at him.

Xia Sheng looked at Xiao Bai Yi in exasperation, begging for him for help.

Xiao Bai Yi decisively turned his head in the opposite direction.

On the boat, Yang Kai frowned, pondering.

He was considering whether he should request some information about the Four Seasons Realm from Gao Xue Ting.

However, her mood seemed to be very unstable due to the previous incident, so Yang Kai did not want to have any contact with her in case she found out anything.

Just when he was hesitating, someone poked him quietly.

He looked around and found a woman with red lips looking at him.

She looked about twenty years old, but her actual age was far greater than that. She had a tall and slender figure, with fair skin and delicate features, her long hair moved with the breeze.

“How can I help you, miss?” Yang Kai asked curiously.

“I don’t think you have this. Here!” The woman handed him a jade slip as she spoke.

Yang Kai raised his brows and reached out to take it. He scanned the object with Divine Sense, and was delighted when he found out the content recorded in the jade slip, “This is...”

The contents recorded in the jade slip was the information of the Four Seasons Realm.

Azure Sun Temple was very familiar with the internal situation of the Four Seasons Realm as it would dispatch disciples into the Four Seasons Realm every time it opened. The information recorded in the jade slip included not only the locations of dangerous barriers but also detailed information of various Monster Beasts in the Four Seasons Realm.

Yang Kai did not expect someone to give him just what he needed while he was hesitating to ask Gao Xue Ting for it.

His favour towards this woman had greatly increased, as she had given him just what he needed most. It was a gift better than anything else he could have wanted.

She probably guessed that he did not have such a thing, and decided to give him one.

It was easy to tell that she was very kind-hearted.

“Many thanks, miss, how should I address you?” Yang Kai thanked her sincerely, and it was only polite to ask for her name in return for such a kind gesture.

“Murong Xiao Xiao!”

Yang Kai nodded, and when he was about to speak again, Xiao Bai Yi suddenly said, “Xiao Xiao, don’t waste your time with an outsider.”

Murong Xiao Xiao stuck her tongue out at Yang Kai, but did not speak further so as not to disobey Xiao Bai Yi.

Yang Kai said, “This Yang will remember your kindness, miss.”

“It’s nothing,” Murong Xiao Xiao smiled slightly, not caring.

“Brother Xiao Bai!” Yang Kai turned towards Xiao Bai Yi.

“Who are you calling!” Xiao Bai Yi turned cold.

“Brother Xiao...” Yang Kai corrected. “Although I’m not a disciple of the Azure Sun Temple, we’re considered companions now that we’re going to the Four Seasons Realm together...”

“Who wants to be your companion?” Xiao Bai Yi said dismissively, “You will soon pay for taking away Xue Yi’s slot!”

“Brother Xiao, do you really have to...?” Yang Kai shook his head and sighed, “You’ll never know if there will be a time in the Four Seasons Realm that you will need my help.”

“You?” Xiao Bai Yi snorted coldly, “You won’t be able to provide any help if ever there is something that this Xiao can’t handle.”

“I have nothing to say if you insist.” Yang Kai smiled bitterly and shook his head.

By the looks of it, Xiao Bai Yi had added him to his hate list, so Yang Kai assumed that he and Xue Yi must have had a good relationship, and as a Senior Brother to Xue Yi, he would not be giving Yang Kai a good time.

It would be extremely odd if he was on good terms with Yang Kai.

It was only understandable.

Gao Xue Ting did not involve herself in the clashes between the Dao Source Realms but continued to navigate the ship on her usual spot.

Five days passed.

That day, a giant mountain valley appeared ahead of the ship.

The silhouettes of a large crowd could be seen on the mountain valley, gathered in groups waiting for something.

From this distance, they could sense the aura of a few Emperor Realm Masters.

Upon perceiving this, Yang Kai was shocked that they had arrived at their destination.

The information provided by Qin Zhao Yang and the jade slip given by Murong Xiao Xiao regarding the entrance to the Four Seasons Realm was similar; it was in an unnamed, inconspicuous mountain valley. The mountain valley was ordinary and had no reason for anyone to stop by. However, there would be a congregation of strong auras before the opening of the Four Seasons Realm. After the level of the aura had reached a certain level, the entrance of the Sealed World would open and last for thirty-three days.

The entrance would be sealed after thirty-three days, and no one would be able to exit the Four Seasons Realm after that.

Those cultivators residing in the mountain valley should be cultivators who had arrived in advance.

The Azure Sun Temple group seemed to be relatively late because all the places on the mountain valley with good landscape and strong aura were already occupied by others.

The cultivators on the mountain valley looked up and stiffened at the sight of the ship that was slowly moving towards the mountain valley.

Azure Sun Temple was, after all, the top Sect in the Southern Territory, and the ship alone exhibited authority with its identity.

From the information recorded in the jade slip, Yang Kai learned that top Sects such as Azure Sun Temple, Heavenly Martial Holy Land, Orthodoxy Temple, Violet Source Chamber of Commerce and Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce, each had twenty slots to enter the Four Seasons Realm. Whereas Star Soul Palace, the Southern Territory strongest Sect has forty slots, which was twice as much as Azure Sun Temple.

The other lower rank Sects had approximately ten slots.

Some Sects only had a few slots.

As for how these slots were distributed, Yang Kai was not sure, but surely it had been carefully calculated and coordinated.

Judging from the four to five hundred bodies gathered below, the Southern Territory consisted of many Sects.

Gao Xue Ting merely looked down for a while and found a spot to anchor the ship.

She put the ship away when all the disciples had disembarked.

“Rest here and don’t cause any trouble. This Queen needs to discuss something with the other Sirs.” She left without waiting.

Everyone seemed to have looked forward to this a long time ago, so they were well prepared in advance. They pulled out their tents from their Space Ring and began setting up.

“Huh...” Someone gasped, and suddenly a person landed from the sky, and crashed into the ground, creating a big crater like a meteorite.

Yang Kai fixed his eyes on the crash site and found that it was Xia Sheng who had been deliberately ignored by Gao Xue Ting during the whole journey.

It was indeed quite admirable that he kept up with everyone by relying on his Source Qi alone for five days, and reached this place at the same time as everyone.

He was panting, but there was no sign of exhaustion.

“I... made it!” Xia Sheng, looking faint and weak, stared at Xiao Bai Yi sadly and said, “Xiao Bai, you’re too heartless!”

A vein on Xiao Bai Yi’s forehead jumped, but he made the clever decision to not respond to him.

“Brother Yang, you didn’t help me either! I had to fly all the way here on my own!” Xia Sheng put his hands on his knees, rolled his eyes at Yang Kai, and said “How are we supposed to conquer and dominate the world together if you’re so cold to me?”

Yang Kai said helplessly, “I’m just an outsider, it’s none of my business!”

“Forget it, forget it, you guys are all unreliable!” Xia Sheng sighed, waved his hand and sat on the ground, feeling rejuvenated, like a dying fish that had returned to the water.

Yang Kai gave him a last look, ignored him, looked for a quiet place and sat down crossed leg.

It was clear that there was still a little time before the opening of the Four Seasons Realm. There were many masters here, and Yang Kai did not feel like wandering around to cause any trouble, so he decided to rest together with the rest of the Azure Sun Temple disciples.
