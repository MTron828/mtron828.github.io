“You’re finally back! Where are my Spirit Herbs?”

Outside the mountain gate, the young man barked through gritted teeth as soon as he saw Yang Kai return.

Yang Kai laughed awkwardly, “There were too many different kinds of herbs on the list, so I couldn’t finish getting everything prepared immediately. Little Brother, please come in and have a rest first. I’ll get you the Spirit Herbs you need right away.”

As he spoke, he opened the Sect Defending Array and shot a look at Hua Qing Si.

Hua Qing Si understood and gestured inside, “Little Brother, this way please!”

“Hmph!” The young man coldly snorted and sailed his ship into High Heaven Palace as he looked down at Yang Kai, “I’m warning you, don’t try any tricks with me. Whether it’s the year or quantity, there can be no mistakes on the Spirit Herbs written on the list; otherwise, you’ll never be able to get away with it!”

“Yes, of course!” Yang Kai nodded impatiently.

Even though this matter had nothing to do with High Heaven Palace, everything from the Seeking Passion Sect was indeed in his hands right now. Since they want to buy it, then he might as well just sell it to them, counting it as forming good relations with Medicine Pill Valley.

“Good…” The young man was just about to say something when his eyes widened and he stared straight at the two beautiful figures that suddenly appeared behind Yang Kai. His eyes lit up instantly and he quickly got off the ship, flying behind Yang Kai after a few steps in the air. He looked at Ji Yao and Zhu Qing with a smile on his face as he glanced between them, eyes finally settling on Zhu Qing’s body. As respectfully as possible, he asked, “This humble one is Li Xuan, may I ask Big Sister for your name?”

Flowers of joy were blooming inside his heart. His Master wouldn’t let him visit Ice Heart Palace and instead sent him to High Heaven Palace. He didn’t expect to see so many beauties in this damned place either. One after another, the beauties flowed in. A simply dazzling sight to behold.

Especially this particular Big Sister. Her figure was… tsk tsk…

He was originally a little chagrined at his Master’s decision to send his Senior Brother to Ice Heart Valley, allowing him to enjoy the charming company of all those beauties, but now, he had no more complaints. Even though Ice Heart Valley had many women, they were not necessarily as outstanding as these three.

Yang Kai’s body jolted as he felt goosebumps all over, he really hadn’t been able to tell that he was such a perverted fellow! Already such a menace at this age, he would surely become an insatiable tyrant when he grew older.

Zhu Qing did not utter a single word and was instead staring firmly at Yang Kai with her beautiful eyes, as if worried that he would disappear again.

But that did not annoy the young man. Instead, he was still acting bashful and called out, “Big Sister, I’m talking to you.”

Only then did Zhu Qing turn her eyes to him and spat a single word, “Scram!”

As soon as this word left her mouth, the boy’s face turned beet red.

[This isn’t good…] Yang Kai thought. One could tell at a glance this boy called Li Xuan wasn’t a decent person, but he carried the identity of a Medicine Pill Valley disciple. What Zhu Qing said might possibly end up making him angry. Just as Yang Kai was thinking about how he was going to remedy the situation, he heard Li Xuan take a deep breath and an intoxicated expression emerged on his face. His heart captured by lust, he mused, “Yes, wonderful… Big Sister, more please!”

Cold sweat dripped down Yang Kai’s face as Ji Yao and Hua Qing Si also wore strange expressions on their faces.

“I told you to scram! Didn’t you hear me? You think I won’t hit you?” Zhu Qing’s eyes went cold.

The young man covered his chest, his entire person appearing to have obtained great satisfaction. Even his breathing was growing rough. He couldn’t help but stagger back a few steps, his already crimson red face turning even redder.

“Is this little brat into ‘that’?” Yang Kai looked at Hua Qing Si in astonishment while sending his voice to her.

“How would I know?” Hua Qing Si rolled her eyes at him.

Yang Kai clicked his tongue, “Sure enough, once the forest grows big, one will see all kinds of birds flying about…”

Coming back to himself, he instructed out loud Hua Qing Si, “Sister Hua, bring this Little Brother to have a rest. I’ll go and sort out the herbs.”

“Yes,” Hua Qing Si nodded and gestured her hand at Li Xuan again, “Little Brother, this way please!”

“No, no, no!” Li Xuan raised his hand at Hua Qing Si, his eyes like leeches biting firmly onto Zhu Qing’s skin, “I don’t want you! I want this Big Sister to take care of me!”

Hua Qing Si’s face turned cold and she cursed him in her heart, [This little brat was just trying to take me back with him to serve in his bedchambers, but now I’m not even good enough to attend to him anymore? What? Aren’t they just breasts… big, giant breasts!]

“You court death!” Zhu Qing glared at him coldly.

Li Xuan still wore a sunny smile on his face, “If Big Sister can bear to see me die, then Little Brother will die for you to see.”

This boy wasn’t that old, and yet he already had quite the glib tongue, but he had no idea that Zhu Qing really did have the intention to kill him right now. Don’t even mention being a mere disciple of Medicine Pill Valley, Zhu Qing had the guts to kill him even if he was the Legacy Disciple of Wondrous Pill Great Emperor.

“I’ll grant your wish!” Zhu Qing coldly snorted and was really going to make a move as soon as she said that.

Yang Kai jumped in fright and quickly shouted, “What are you doing?!”

Shifting over, he stood in front of Zhu Qing.

“Move,” Zhu Qing looked at him with irritation.

“Hm, you even dare lose your temper with me?” Yang Kai glared at her.

Zhu Qing turned down her imposingness instantly and frowned, “Excuse me!”

Yang Kai whispered, “You can’t kill him!”

Zhu Qing said disdainfully, “Who can’t I kill?”

“Anyway, you can’t kill him. He’s from Medicine Pill Valley. I’ll be in trouble if he’s dead. How about this? Just put up with him for now, and if you can’t stand it, just ignore him.”

“He has such indecent thoughts towards me and you want me to tolerate him?” Zhu Qing looked at Yang Kai with an aggrieved expression.

“He’s just got a foul mouth is all, it’s not like you’re losing anything from it. Last time, even I… ahem…”

He thought to himself, [I’ve already done that to you and I don’t see you trying to kill me. Is my charm really that great?]

Zhu Qing’s cheeks turned red and she turned away, “Whatever the case, he doesn’t deserve my attention.”

“Fine, fine. Just think of it as a favour. All you have to do is stand here while I sort out the herbs, then we’ll drive him away once that’s over.”

“Make it quick,” Zhu Qing said unhappily.

“Qing’er is the best,” Yang Kai said to flatter her and quickly left.

Zhu Qing’s face turned red again, a sight that caused Li Xuan’s heart to race. He wouldn’t want anything more than to hold hands with her and grow old together with her.

After arriving at a deserted place, Yang Kai took out the jade slip that Li Xuan handed him and then compared them one by one with the things in his Space Ring.

After destroying Seeking Passion Sect, he took away all of their treasures. If the Seeking Passion Sect really had been collecting herbs for Medicine Pill Valley, then Yang Kai should be able to find them quickly.

And in fact, Yang Kai really did find them.

One by one, piece by piece, whether the age or species, it was all correct. There were even extras of some.

Over a thousand types of herbs, with several at the Emperor Grade, were all present. Yang Kai was a little reluctant to hand such a treasure trove over though; after all, he was an Alchemist himself, so these herbs were useful to him.

But he was a rich man now, so these Spirit Herbs didn’t matter to him all that much. At least he would be able to save some trouble by handing them over to Medicine Pill Valley.

Ji Yao said it too. Medicine Pill Valley wouldn’t let him suffer a loss, meaning they would probably buy them at a fair market price.

But that only made sense. For a place with a reputation as big as Medicine Pill Valley, and with Wondrous Pill Great Emperor’s name at stake, it was naturally impossible for them to bully the weak and cheat them out of Source Crystals.

In less than half an hour, Yang Kai sorted out all the herbs.

Just as he was about to hand them over and drive Li Xuan away, his communication artifact suddenly buzzed.

Yang Kai frowned. After grumbling a little, he took out the communication artifact and poured his Divine Sense into it. In the next moment, his face changed.

Space Principles flashed and he instantly disappeared. By the time he reappeared, he was already at the main gate.

Looking over, he saw that young man called Li Xuan now sitting on the ground with a horrified look on his face, hand holding his cheek. On that clean cheek was a clear five-finger mark and his mouth was leaking blood.

Zhu Qing was standing not far from him, releasing a cold murderous intent that enveloped the brat, causing him to tremble.

Only in this sudden life or death crisis did Li Xuan realize that his status as a Medicine Pill Valley disciple wasn’t effective in the slightest here. With an aura of death close at hand, he had chills running all over his body.

Ji Yao was standing there indifferently, looking at Li Xuan without the slightest bit of sympathy on her face.

Hua Qing Si was holding her communication artifact, unsure what to do.

Yang Kai’s appearance sizzled out Zhu Qing’s anger instantly. Only then did the Dragon Girl remember what Yang Kai told her before and her expression couldn’t help but become uneasy.

“What happened?” Yang Kai glanced coldly at Li Xuan before asking Zhu Qing.

Zhu Qing’s red lips quivered, but she didn’t utter a single word.

“Sister Hua, you explain,” Yang Kai turned his head towards Hua Qing Si.

Hua Qing Si sighed, “This little bastard tried to take advantage of Young Lady Qing. After Young Lady Qing avoided him, he became even bolder and tried to seize her directly. Young Lady Qing was overcome with anger and… taught him a small lesson.”

As a woman, Hua Qing Si wanted to praise Zhu Qing for her actions. She even felt that it wasn’t enough. Even if he wasn’t killed, his cultivation should be crippled, but as the Head Manager of the High Heaven Sect, Hua Qing Si knew how much trouble Zhu Qing’s slap would bring to their Sect, and she couldn’t help feeling worried.

“He tried to take advantage of her?” Yang Kai raised a brow.

“Nonsense, that’s not true!” Li Xuan yelled. Somehow, he found his spine and stood up, “This is slander! She is an Emperor Realm Master while I am only at First-Order Dao Source Realm. How would I have the ability to take advantage of her!”

“So, you do know that you’re at First-Order Dao Source Realm?” Yang Kai looked at him in surprise. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

This little brat had been throwing his weight around as soon as he appeared, acting all haughty as if he was a Great Emperor rather than just a lowly Dao Source Realm.

Li Xuan wiped away the blood away from his mouth and glared furiously at Yang Kai, bellowing, “This woman laid her hand on me for no reason at all! As a disciple of Medicine Pill Valley, hitting my face is no different from hitting Medicine Pill Valley’s face! You are the Palace Master of High Heaven Palace, so you better compensate me! Otherwise, I won’t let you off so easily!”

“You want me to compensate you?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes at him, “How?”

Li Xuan had a cruel look in his eyes and turned to look at Zhu Qing, “I want you to waste this bitch’s cultivation and then hand her to me for punishment!”

The disparity in their strength was too great, but if her cultivation was crippled, then there would be nothing to be afraid of. He swore in his heart that he had to show this woman the fate of daring to go against him.

Yang Kai turned to look at Zhu Qing, “You really hit him?”

Zhu Qing looked gloomy, “I could not endure it… I’m sorry!”
